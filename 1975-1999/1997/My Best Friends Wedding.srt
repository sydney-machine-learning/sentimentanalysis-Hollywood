1
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:29,867
Ready? Okay.

2
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:32,103
Wishing and hoping

3
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:34,705
And thinking and praying

4
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,774
Planning and dreaming

5
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:40,277
Each night of his charms

6
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:45,282
That won't get you
into his arms

7
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:48,319
So if you're looking
to find love

8
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:53,457
That you can share

9
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:55,059
All you've got to do

10
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,294
Is hold him and kiss him

11
00:00:57,294 --> 00:01:01,731
And love him
and show him that you care

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,872
Show him that you care
just for him

13
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:11,976
Do the things
that he likes to do

14
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:16,913
Wear your hair
just for him

15
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:20,951
'Cause you won't get him

16
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:24,421
Thinking and praying
Wishing and hoping

17
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,158
Just wishing and hoping

18
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:29,660
And thinking and praying

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,166
Planning and dreaming
his kisses will start

20
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:39,102
That won't get you
into his heart

21
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:43,507
So if you're thinking
of how great

22
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:47,637
True love is

23
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:54,518
And squeeze him
and love him

24
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:58,189
Just do it
and after you do

25
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,124
You will be his

26
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:28,779
Two and two, menu !
Brian, 22, immediately!

27
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,447
Guillermo!

28
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,783
Two pigeons! Right away!

29
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:35,149
''V. I.P.''
Very important table right here!

30
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:43,482
Give me two grain!

31
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:47,898
- I'll take that polenta!
- All right, Chef.

32
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,900
- This is the one I'm waiting for!
- Yes, sir.

33
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,737
I need that special meat now.
Pastry, get ready. It's coming at you.

34
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:56,473
I will kill your family it you don't
get this right. I need this perfect.

35
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,497
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:18,495
I'm writing it up as...

37
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:20,831
inventive and...

38
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,264
confident.

39
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:31,932
- Did the chap from Newsday ever call?
- I'll check my machine.

40
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:36,013
Is this a real interview
or some cute guy...

41
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:38,015
- you're setting me up with?
- Please, Julianne.

42
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,851
I don't send you men anymore.
You have no idea what to do with them.

43
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:45,189
it’s Michael.
Jules, it must be months, huh?

44
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:51,028
l can't wait to talk to you.
I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.

45
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:55,032
Call me. 4:00 in the morning,
whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.

46
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:59,203
- Who called? Man of the moment?
- No, the opposite.

47
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:03,140
It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal.
Sounds desperate to talk to me.

48
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,677
The wandering sportswriter.
Remind me about that one.

49
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,178
Sophomore year at Brown...

50
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:11,882
we had this one hot month.

51
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:15,886
But you know me.
I got restless.

52
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:19,556
So I get up the nerve
to break his heart...

53
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:21,547
and he gives me this look.

54
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,229
Then he said, ''The thing
that makes me want to cry is...

55
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,565
I'm losing the best friend
I ever had.''

56
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:32,403
At that moment,
I knew I tell the same way.

57
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:36,407
So I cried for maybe
the third time in my entire life...

58
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,075
kissed him...

59
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:40,839
and we've been best friends
ever since.

60
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,343
We've seen each other
through everything:

61
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,252
losing jobs...

62
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:50,754
losing parents, losing lovers.

63
00:05:50,754 --> 00:05:53,690
We've traveled all over.

64
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,427
The best times of my life, maybe.

65
00:05:56,427 --> 00:06:00,597
Drinking and talking,
even if it's just over the phone.

66
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:04,034
Go on. This is so moving.
Kindred spirits?

67
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:07,697
He's nothing Like me.
He's Like you actually, only straight.

68
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:12,576
I remember this one night
in Tucson six years ago.

69
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:15,612
He takes a razor out
of this little shaving kit...

70
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:18,615
cuts his finger, takes my hand,
does the same to me.

71
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:21,952
- I'm gonna be sick.
- He says, ''Swear when we're 28...

72
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:24,922
if we've never married,
we marry each other.''

73
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:27,658
We never talked about it again.

74
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:31,462
I don't know
what made me think of that.

75
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:34,659
You're about to be 28
in three weeks, right?

76
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:40,003
- How old is he?
- You think?

77
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:42,801
Desperate to talk.

78
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,748
Cheers.

79
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:58,287
''Digital Answering System''
''Play''

80
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:06,262
''Red''

81
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:17,508
- Good evening. The Drake Hotel.
- I'm calling for Michael O'Neal...

82
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:20,602
- but since it's so late--
- One moment, please.

83
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:24,446
Hello?

84
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:29,853
You've been enrolled
in the Obscene caller of the Month Club.

85
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:32,856
Hey, beautiful.
it’s so great to hear your voice.

86
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:36,193
l miss you. I've been
calling you for over a month.

87
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:38,028
I've been on a book tour.

88
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:41,198
- I figured you were out of town.
- My machine eats all my messages.

89
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:43,534
Or you're just averaging 30 days
to return a call.

90
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:48,372
- it’s less when it's you.
- I have to ask you something important.

91
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:50,374
lf you turn me down,
l don't know what I'll do.

92
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:54,470
It I could just tell you
one thing first.

93
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,550
This is probably going
to hand you...

94
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,553
the biggest laugh
of your adult life...

95
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:05,389
but I was thinking about you,
and I was remembering...

96
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,394
this unbelievably insane night
we spent in Tucson...

97
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:13,230
like a thousand years ago.

98
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,566
- You probably won't remember this--
- Are you kidding?

99
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,569
l think about that night
all the time.

100
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,571
You do?

101
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:23,907
But it's not why I called.

102
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:25,409
It's not.

103
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,503
l called because I met someone.

104
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,583
That's great.

105
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:37,754
You haven't really seen anybody
since that dingbat Jenny Lee, have you?

106
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:39,423
You don't understand.

107
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,426
I've never felt this way
about anybody.

108
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:46,263
- She's all wrong for me.
- That's a good start.

109
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,432
She's a junior
at the University of Chicago.

110
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:51,602
She's 20. Her name's Kim.
You're gonna love her. She's beautiful.

111
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:55,439
Her dad is this billionaire. He owns
the White Sox and some cable empire.

112
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,108
I've always been uncomfortable
around rich people.

113
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:01,778
- Sure.
- But they're not like that.

114
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:06,283
They're such wonderful people.
Salt of the earth.

115
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,547
So you've met her parents?

116
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:13,787
Jules, we're getting married
this Sunday.

117
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,226
- Hello?
- Michael--

118
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,466
It's Wednesday night.

119
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,635
How can you possibly
be getting married on Sunday?

120
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,303
Actually, it starts tomorrow.

121
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:29,306
it’s a four-day wedding
with all the traditional events...

122
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:33,810
and 10 million people
flying in from all over the world.

123
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,981
Aren't you working this weekend?
Is that responsible?

124
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:43,487
The Sox are at home and Sports is
letting me do a profile on Frank Thomas.

125
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:45,656
Wait.
What do you mean, irresponsible?

126
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:48,250
Taking off a weekend
to get married?

127
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,253
Jules, I'm scared.

128
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:58,001
- Maybe we should talk about this.
- I need you.

129
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,338
lf you can't come and hold my hand,
I'll never get through this.

130
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,272
Please come.

131
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:08,879
l can 't wait for you
to meet her.

132
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,849
''United Airlines''
Listen, Jules.

133
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:14,851
Let's stop for a drink.
You can take a later flight.

134
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:18,689
I'm a busy girl. I've got four days
to break up a wedding...

135
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:22,793
steal the bride's fellow,
and I haven't one clue how to do it.

136
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,529
He adored me
for nine goddamn years.

137
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:29,232
- I can see why.
- She has known him for five seconds.

138
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:32,703
Plus, she's got billions of dollars,
and she's apparently perfect.

139
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:37,140
So don't go feeling all sorry
for Miss Preteen Illinois.

140
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:42,979
l can't lose him, George.
I'm going to bring him back.

141
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,216
You give your hand to me

142
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:49,052
You give your hand to me

143
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:51,520
And then you say hello

144
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,892
l can hardly speak

145
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:59,396
My heart is beating so

146
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:03,066
And anyone can tell

147
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:06,236
You think you know me well

148
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:09,603
But you don't know me

149
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:16,580
No, you don't know the one

150
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,250
Who dreams of you at night

151
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,587
Wants to kiss your lips

152
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:26,590
Wants to hold you tight

153
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,926
l am just a friend

154
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:33,597
That's all I've ever been

155
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:37,363
- Can you believe I'm gonna do this?
- Not hardly.

156
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:55,719
This just makes everything
so perfect.

157
00:11:55,719 --> 00:12:00,247
Since I've met Michael, all I've heard
is ''Julianne this'' and ''Julianne that.''

158
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:03,092
I've never had a sister.

159
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:13,570
I have this monstrous favor
to ask you.

160
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,305
- Excuse me?
- My best friend...

161
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:20,811
shattered her pelvis line dancing
in Abilene over spring break.

162
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,279
- Be my maid of honor?
- What?

163
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:29,619
Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid
or someone you've known longer?

164
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:33,156
My bridesmaids are my only two
female relatives under the age of 40...

165
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:37,160
debutante sisters from Nashville
who are basically vengeful sluts.

166
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,457
My exit!

167
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,934
I have tour days
to make you my new best friend.

168
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,994
It's time for you
to force yourself to get personal.

169
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:03,687
- Do you like the color?
- I think it's beautiful.

170
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,689
- Isn't that perfect for her?
- absolutely.

171
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:08,692
This is going to be tighter.
You don't want those things to fall out.

172
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:11,895
- It's beautiful.
- I'm not hurting you.

173
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:16,800
I don't want her to trip,
so I'll take this up a tiny bit.

174
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,166
Would you rather the daffodil?

175
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:25,041
I thought the bridesmaids
all wore the same dress.

176
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:29,068
Not you. You wouldn't be comfortable
unless you were distinctive.

177
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,017
What else did he tell you?

178
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:37,053
You hate weddings.
You never go.

179
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,556
You're not up
for anything conventional...

180
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:43,492
or anything that's assumed
to be a female priority...

181
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:49,065
including marriage
or romance or even--

182
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,657
Love?

183
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,405
Michael and I were a wrong tip
right from the start.

184
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:58,074
He said that too.

185
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:02,412
I thought I was like you,
and proud to be...

186
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:05,615
until I met rumpled,
smelly, old Michael.

187
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:08,084
Then I found I was just
a sentimental schmuck...

188
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:11,755
like all those flighty nitwits
I'd always pitied.

189
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,746
It's funny, huh?

190
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:17,685
l need a cigarette.

191
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,438
George, how do you think I feel?

192
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:31,107
all she does is talk
about her and Michael's future.

193
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:36,079
- She's just so dreamy.
- Jules, pull yourself together.

194
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,309
I don't know if I can do it.

195
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:42,786
You want me to turn around
or something?

196
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:46,552
Not the person I was expecting.

197
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:52,220
I've seen you
a lot more naked than that.

198
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:58,901
Things are different now.

199
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,573
I guess so.

200
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:12,649
You look really good...

201
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,947
without your clothes on.

202
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,262
She's toast.

203
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:31,425
''Caution 2-Way Traffic''
''Exit''

204
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,842
- Where is the honeymoon exactly?
- It depends.

205
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:42,345
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento,
we could start there.
''Chicago Hilton And Towers''

206
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:44,848
Or Phoenix. Or depending
on the Indiana-Cleveland game--

207
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:46,516
Garden spots, all.

208
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:49,686
A swing of maybe 40 degrees Fahrenheit
represents a packing challenge...

209
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:53,523
but there's tine food and cocktails
at a choice of Embassy Suites.

210
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:57,660
it’s his career. I'm supportive.
I've been everywhere.

211
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,798
I want to be with the man I love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.

212
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:07,771
He's lucky. One woman in a billion
could put up with his shit.

213
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:11,007
The guy's a one-man festival
of idiosyncratic--

214
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,676
You've been introduced
to the symphonic range--

215
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:16,880
Of his snoring?
He says it's worse than ever.

216
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,178
You know that snarfle one?

217
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:25,981
Now it's got this phlegm-rattling thing
happening behind it.

218
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:35,065
Earplugs work.

219
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:38,268
- What about--
- Cigars in bed? I broke him of that.

220
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:41,204
The bathroom's a swamp.
He wears Reeboks to dinner.

221
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:45,008
He likes action movies.
He reads over my Shoulder.

222
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,943
He loves karaoke bars...

223
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:49,245
- and I can't carry a tune.
- Really?

224
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,748
He sucks soup
through his front teeth.

225
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:55,081
That's a trademark move.
Don't touch that one.

226
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,354
But he sure can kiss.

227
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:05,186
It's been a while.
I'm just gonna take your word on that.

228
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:15,105
After two weeks
of cataloging all his faults...

229
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:18,040
I made a command decision
that changed my life.

230
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:24,647
I threw the list away.

231
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:26,983
He's not a balance sheet.
He's Michael.

232
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:29,085
Loving him means
loving all of him.

233
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,887
Do you get nervous
in confined spaces?

234
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,956
It's sweet of you
to want to be protective...

235
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:36,759
but nothing ever could give me
one moment's pause about this marriage.

236
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:40,991
- Do you become hysterical in confined--
- Except one.

237
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:44,434
You. You're always
in his mind....

238
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,769
this perfect creature
he loved for years.

239
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:49,806
perfection can get wearing
after awhile.

240
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:52,642
I'm not kidding. I had to face up
to my competitive drives.

241
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,978
believe me, I've got them.

242
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:58,314
Am I gonna be jealous of you
for the rest of my life?

243
00:17:58,314 --> 00:18:00,450
- Our paths will keep crossing.
- Space. of course.

244
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,985
- He'll always talk about you.
- It's only natural.

245
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:05,155
The answer was so simple.

246
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:08,158
I was gonna predict that.

247
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:09,591
You win.

248
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:13,861
I've missed a step.

249
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:18,001
He's got you on a pedestal...

250
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,969
and me in his arms.

251
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:31,881
My God, it's the bride
and the woman she'll never live up to.

252
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:34,684
- Are you okay, honey?
- That would be us.

253
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:37,353
Did she say the wrong thing again?
That is so in character.

254
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:39,522
- I'm Julianne Potter.
- We'd be the vengeful sluts.

255
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:43,693
- You can just call us eager.
- Have you sized up the groomsmen?

256
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:47,697
- As maid of honor, you get first pick.
- Don't pick the short, hairy, tat one.

257
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:50,200
- He's mine.
- Kimmy's a virgin.

258
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,635
Is this Michael's Julianne?

259
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:55,205
I'm Isabelle Wallace.

260
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:58,003
My handsome new son
scarcely did you justice.

261
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:02,712
My husband says
to scoot you to the ballpark...

262
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:04,814
so you can hang with Michael.

263
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:07,884
But first you have to meet
a lot of really old women.

264
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:11,149
That is, it you've absorbed
enough profanity.

265
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,703
Who ordered a beer?

266
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:31,541
- Let me help you with that.
- You unwittingly imply I'm clumsy.

267
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,244
Sorry. I was confusing you
with somebody I used to know.

268
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:37,380
Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Eric
from Sport magazine.

269
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,382
- Nice to meet you.
- They kindly gave me a job.

270
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:42,018
- Hi, there.
- How do you do?

271
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:45,288
And this is Walter,
my father-in-Law.

272
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:47,757
Future father-in-Law.
''Comiskey''

273
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:49,259
Thank you.

274
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,887
If he gives you any grief,
come see me.

275
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:57,267
- And this guy you know.
- Papa Joe.

276
00:19:57,267 --> 00:20:02,772
I told him to make you best man,
but he had to go with his baby brother.

277
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:05,441
Best-looking guy
in any room.

278
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,378
- Great to see you.
- That will do.

279
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:11,614
- Scotty, that will do.
- Sorry.

280
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,284
Remember, it is the duty
of the best man...

281
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:17,587
to dance
with the maid of honor.

282
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:20,123
Dance? You can't dance.

283
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:25,060
- When did you Learn to dance?
- I've got moves you've never seen.

284
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:28,327
You're an impostor.

285
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,302
What did you do
with my best friend?

286
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:35,805
''Chicago Tribune"
I'm still your best friend.

287
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:38,467
You just haven't seen me
for awhile.

288
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:47,417
Some people might find
that kind of perfection boring...

289
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:50,653
- day after day, year after year.
- That's what I thought at first.

290
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:52,822
How can you like someone
that perfect?

291
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:56,492
No potential
for long-range Likeability.

292
00:20:56,492 --> 00:21:00,330
But then, she does have
a few good traits.

293
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,831
- All right.
- Such as?

294
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:04,133
They got him.

295
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,669
When I hug her,
even in public...

296
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:09,505
I don't have to let go
right away.

297
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:12,008
She lets me hold her
as long as I want.

298
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:16,012
- Batting second, the shortstop--
- What?

299
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:19,182
- Nothing.
- I forgot.

300
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:21,884
You and that yucky love stuff.

301
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:24,020
You always get like that
when it gets sentimental.

302
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,215
I do not.

303
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,827
When we were--
When you and I were--

304
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:32,954
- When we were--
- Together?

305
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,135
Did I, when--

306
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:43,172
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

307
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:46,232
You pulled away when I tried
to hug you in public.

308
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:54,283
I've changed.

309
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:56,808
I mean, I'm not the girl
that I once was.

310
00:21:58,154 --> 00:21:59,756
Really?

311
00:21:59,756 --> 00:22:02,691
Any relationship over two weeks
I should know about?

312
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,026
This is not about longevity.

313
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:09,932
This is about...

314
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:12,335
being comfortable...

315
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:14,326
with the yucky love stuff.

316
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,275
all right.

317
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,766
And I am.

318
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:28,251
And it's wisdom born of pain

319
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:30,753
Yes, I've paid the price

320
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:33,689
But look how much I've gained

321
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:35,925
- If I have to
- Karaoke!

322
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,760
- I can do anything
- Where did you find this place?

323
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,263
The doorman told me.
And you are singing the song.

324
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:44,767
l am strong
l am invincible

325
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:48,362
l am woman

326
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:56,378
I didn't realize
this was a karaoke bar.

327
00:22:57,447 --> 00:22:59,749
This is so great.
My two best girls.

328
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:02,952
- You folks thirsty?
- Margarita.

329
00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:04,787
- Blended, no salt.
- She wants it straight up.

330
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,456
- You?
- Amstel Light.

331
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:08,458
Two words for you.

332
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,560
Margarita.

333
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,221
Vespa.

334
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:15,229
Florence.

335
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,968
Me hanging on in the rain.

336
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:21,937
- I love Florence.
- And the guy with the thing.

337
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,675
Where was my pass?

338
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:28,644
- ''No, the pier is for fishing!''
- ''French kissing?''

339
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:32,080
- ''Fishing!''
- I've always loved Florence.

340
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:38,086
You Should take her there.
She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.

341
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,260
''If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento''?

342
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,162
You're off the road in September, and
when does tall quarter start for you?

343
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:56,298
I'm not coming back senior year.

344
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:04,380
Don't architects find a degree
sort of an asset?

345
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,684
I travel every week. Got college ball,
motor sports, training camps.

346
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:11,687
I think the most important thing
is for us to be together.

347
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:16,559
Say, Pinky, I wanna hear you sing.
Come on.

348
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,823
Kimmy hates to sing.
She hates it.

349
00:24:22,832 --> 00:24:24,901
all right, folks.
Everybody...

350
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:29,472
my bride-to-be here
is about to kick some ass on--

351
00:24:29,472 --> 00:24:31,741
What?
It will be fun.

352
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:34,410
No, she doesn't want to, Michael.
Leave her alone.

353
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,380
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen...

354
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,417
Please give it up for the dazzling
vocal stylings...

355
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:43,749
of Miss Kimberly Wallace!

356
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:49,817
Come on.

357
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:09,245
l just don 't know what to do
with myself

358
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:13,716
Don't know just what to do
with myself

359
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:17,887
I'm so used to doing

360
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:20,256
Everything for you

361
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:25,928
- You suck!
- Planning everything for two

362
00:25:25,928 --> 00:25:29,932
And now that we're through

363
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,734
l just don't know

364
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:36,539
What to do with my time

365
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,108
I'm so lonesome for you

366
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:41,243
It's a crime

367
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:44,906
Going to a movie

368
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:17,647
lf your new love

369
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:20,316
Ever turns you down

370
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:22,451
Come back

371
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:27,650
I will be around
just waiting for you

372
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:33,588
l just don 't know what to do

373
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,924
Like a summer rose

374
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:43,271
It needs the sun and the rain

375
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:50,846
l need your sweet love

376
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:56,148
l need your sweet love to ease

377
00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:04,622
All the pain

378
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:13,357
That was just terrible!

379
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:25,881
''Steakhouse'' ''Park'' ''Taxi''
- You won't be lonely without us?
- Desperately.

380
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:28,884
- Maybe we don't have to go.
- Your grandmother's dinner?

381
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:32,555
As bride-to-be,
she's got you on a technicality.

382
00:27:32,555 --> 00:27:37,893
I'd baby-sit you, but my loyalty
is to the bride in her time of need.

383
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:42,398
- It's not really a time of need.
- If you're sure.

384
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,562
- ''Sure''?
- I'll stay with Michael it you're sure.

385
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:52,836
- Call me later?
- of course.

386
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:59,506
- Bye.
- Have fun.

387
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:14,597
Were you pretty shocked
when I told you?

388
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:16,531
Shocked? No.

389
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,270
A little.

390
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,706
A lot.
I tell oft the bed.

391
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:28,811
That explains the thump.

392
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:31,041
You like her, don't you?

393
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:36,452
- I do.
- That's enthusiastic.

394
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:39,888
I mean, she's--
She's great.

395
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:47,129
She seriously
can't sing a note.

396
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:52,101
But to make that kind
of sacrifice--

397
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:57,173
- What? Leaving school?
- all of it.

398
00:28:57,173 --> 00:29:00,810
Putting her career on hold
to follow you around in this dumb job...

399
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,646
where you travel 52 weeks a year...

400
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:07,149
to places
like College Station, Texas.

401
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:11,287
- ''Dumb job''?
- It's not a grown-up job.

402
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:13,856
My job never bothered you before.

403
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,927
It doesn't bother me now,
but I'm not Kimmy.

404
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:23,490
Her father owns the Sox
and cable sports.

405
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:29,171
I'm just surprised
it hasn't come up, that's all.

406
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,763
What?

407
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,643
The corner office with a view.

408
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:37,513
You in a nice blue suit.

409
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:41,851
Permanent Chicago address,
somewhat close to Mom and Dad.

410
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:43,519
Never.

411
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,181
She would never even think of that.

412
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:49,390
You don't know her.

413
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,202
- But Michael loves his job.
- Sure.

414
00:30:00,202 --> 00:30:03,372
Bad games, bad pay,
bad towns, bad flights...

415
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:05,875
bad hotels, real bad food...

416
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:08,043
homeless, rootless, lonely...

417
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:10,379
your copy makes it
in one issue out of tour.

418
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,381
What's not to love?

419
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:16,218
Why would he trade that for running,
say, a piece of the public relations...

420
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:20,055
at a powerful complex conglomerate
like your father's?

421
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:24,355
- That's what my father and I discussed.
- I'm not surprised.

422
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:29,231
So do you think
he'd really accept?

423
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:30,900
Michael?
A job like that?

424
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,570
It would be the greatest thing
that ever happened to him.

425
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,072
Present company excepted.

426
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:41,944
This is what we do:
We make your dad a coconspirator.

427
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:43,946
Michael does a favor for Walter.

428
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:46,582
Walter's reorganizing
his public relations...

429
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:49,084
and needs a brilliant guy
that he's close to...

430
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,587
that he can completely trust.

431
00:30:51,587 --> 00:30:54,590
Then you beg.
'Michael, please do this for Daddy.

432
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,082
It's only six months.
It would mean so much to me. "

433
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:04,861
- He'll see right through it.
- Only if he wants to.

434
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:07,269
At the end of six months...

435
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,072
he will be happy...

436
00:31:10,072 --> 00:31:11,874
settled...

437
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:13,603
successful.

438
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,723
Wow.

439
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:33,462
You look beautiful.
Do you have a date later?

440
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:34,895
Never can tell.

441
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:39,826
Just the way you look tonight
Remember?

442
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,769
Okay, kid, you're up.

443
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,744
It's really my father
who needs the favor.

444
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:04,827
He's reorganizing some
of the divisions of the company.

445
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:08,194
Public relations
is a real problem area for him.

446
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:14,295
It would only be
six months maybe.

447
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:20,342
- Or three or four.
- You knew about this?

448
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:24,335
I think you ought to Listen to her.
it’s her life too.

449
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,052
You gonna tell me
that Walter thought this one up?

450
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:34,189
Why don't you start
by being honest one second.

451
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:36,525
I am being honest.

452
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:40,029
all of a sudden I'm supposed
to drop out of school...

453
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:42,131
forget my family,
forget my career...

454
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:46,702
- forget the things I had planned?
- Forgive me for screwing up your plans.

455
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:49,538
Glad I heard this
before it's too Late.

456
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:52,808
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What am I supposed to do with my life?

457
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:56,045
I work in a low-paying,
zero-respect job...

458
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:59,173
which, unfortunately,
I happen to love.

459
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:07,222
- It sounds like a great opportunity.
- Does it really?

460
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:10,726
How come you never took
some sellout establishment job?

461
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:13,228
I'll tell you why,
because that isn't you.

462
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:15,898
- And it's not me either.
- lf that's the way you feel--

463
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:19,701
Damn straight that's how I feel !
Just come out and say it.

464
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:23,205
My job's not good enough.
I'm not good enough.

465
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:27,505
- I never said that!
- Yes, you did.

466
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,047
Great, Kim.

467
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:36,074
Two days before our wedding, you Lay
this on me. I'm supposed to roll over?

468
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:42,591
Fine. I'm an insensitive.
sexist asshole.

469
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:44,422
You're better oft without me.

470
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:51,066
You are so right.
l was so wrong.

471
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:54,470
We settled this, and I reneged.
That just wasn't fair.

472
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,108
You have to forgive me and forget
this happened or I'll just die.

473
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:00,541
Please.

474
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:07,479
I'm sorry.

475
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:35,310
George and Werner are not in.

476
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,646
Brevity is the order of the day.

477
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:39,948
George, answer this, damn it

478
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:43,485
I'm in a meltdown here!
She double-crossed me!

479
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:47,823
The little twerp groveled
She's so wrong for him.

480
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:52,661
Michael and I are the same person:
self-absorbed and vaguely loveable.

481
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:55,164
We deserve each other.
I'm running out of time.

482
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:58,967
I'm completely out of sneaky ideas.
l have come to the end...

483
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,836
of my rapidly fraying rope!

484
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:03,430
You have got to think of something!

485
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:11,438
- Coffee, anyone?
- That would be wonderful.

486
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:17,178
''The Drake''

487
00:35:48,483 --> 00:35:51,887
This is very Marcel Marceau.

488
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:56,558
Now, relax. We don't want your face
coming off with it, do we?

489
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,458
What a hideous room.

490
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:02,827
Death by a mini-bar.
How glamorous.

491
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:09,571
You flew all the way here.
You hate to fly.

492
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:13,709
I have to go back this evening.
We have a family thing in the Hamptons.

493
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:15,643
You're butting in.

494
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:20,382
What I mean when I say
she's annoyingly perfect...

495
00:36:20,382 --> 00:36:23,252
is that there is nothing annoying
about her perfection.

496
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:28,223
It is vulnerable and endearing.
And that is annoying as shit.

497
00:36:28,223 --> 00:36:30,225
You like her.

498
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,352
It I didn't have to hate her,
I'd adore her.

499
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:36,331
This is my whole life's happiness.

500
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:38,265
I have to be ruthless.

501
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:42,104
He was in love with me
every day for nine years.

502
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:44,106
I can make him happier
than she can.

503
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:46,275
I am breaking her heart
in the short run...

504
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,944
but really doing her
a gigantic favor.

505
00:36:48,944 --> 00:36:53,711
She would be so miserable tagging along
after this insensitive doofus.

506
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:05,294
Do you really love him...

507
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:07,462
or is this just about winning?

508
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:08,895
Seriously.

509
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:16,805
In the beginning,
it was mostly this prior claim.

510
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:18,898
He belonged to me.

511
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,314
But now, when I'm with him...

512
00:37:25,314 --> 00:37:29,151
he's just so wonderful.

513
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:33,655
How come I never knew that
when I could have had him?

514
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:37,250
It's amazing the clarity that comes
with psychotic jealousy.

515
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:42,331
George, believe me...

516
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:45,167
if he was feeling
what I'm feeling...

517
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,836
then he would know how I feel.

518
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:50,339
It's horrible.

519
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,931
What?

520
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,942
Just tell him you love him.

521
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:02,851
tell him you've loved him
for nine years...

522
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:05,445
but you were afraid of love.

523
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:10,192
Tell him you were afraid of love,
afraid of needing.

524
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:13,028
- Needing what?
- To belong to someone.

525
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:15,197
We all are, sweetheart.

526
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:17,866
I'm sorry about that.

527
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:23,438
Tell him this is the worst, cruelest,
dumbest moment to do this to him...

528
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:25,374
but there it is.

529
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:27,467
He's got to choose.

530
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,880
tell him the actual truth?

531
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,817
Maybe not the actual truth.

532
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:39,446
Highlights.

533
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,029
Arms at your sides, Please.

534
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:02,744
- Good morning.
- I have to talk to you.

535
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:06,415
- You don't like the suit?
- That's not what I have to talk about.

536
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,679
One thing first.
Excuse me.

537
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:18,760
- Guard this with your life.
- What is it?

538
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,263
- The ring.
- Why are you giving it to me?

539
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:24,266
- I don't trust Scotty with it.
- I don't think--

540
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,101
Please.

541
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:28,603
You're practically
the best man anyway.

542
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:31,697
- Thank you.
- Open it.

543
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:34,742
will she like it?

544
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:44,553
- What did you want to talk about?
- What?

545
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:46,111
You wanted to talk
about something?

546
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,596
We've known each other
a long time, right? Twenty years?

547
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:57,799
Not that long, but a long time.

548
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:59,801
And in that time...

549
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:04,329
we've grown close.

550
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:08,143
Very close.
Do you know what I mean?

551
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:10,771
- I think so.
- Good. So do I.

552
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,074
So sometimes--

553
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,118
could you excuse us?

554
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:25,026
Sometimes...

555
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:27,662
people think...

556
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:30,332
they know how they feel
about each other...

557
00:40:30,332 --> 00:40:31,765
but they don't...

558
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:34,802
until...

559
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:37,828
until they do.

560
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:41,107
I have a point.

561
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:44,946
- Am I getting to it?
- Why don't you?

562
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:48,177
Whatever it is you have to say
can't be that big a deal.

563
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,684
''A big deal'' is a relative term.

564
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:12,406
Who's that guy?

565
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:18,246
It's George. I've told you
about George. He's my editor.

566
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:20,510
What's he doing here?
You working this weekend?

567
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:27,814
- He's here to be with me.
- Why?

568
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:34,396
Because he's my friend.
He's my good friend.

569
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:35,988
My best friend these days.

570
00:41:39,568 --> 00:41:41,729
You've been busy.

571
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:47,872
So all of this
has been about George?

572
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,932
I'm speechless.

573
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:12,934
That's Jules.

574
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:14,436
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

575
00:42:14,436 --> 00:42:16,471
What?

576
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:20,271
I told him, puppy. If we're engaged,
we Shouldn't be ashamed of it.

577
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,281
He's racing back to New York.
He just came in for a few hours...

578
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:28,545
to fuck me.

579
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:35,923
Takes a few hours.

580
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,226
God.

581
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:45,300
Give me your ring.
Give it to me!

582
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,970
When you ask a girl to marry you,
you have to give an engagement ring.

583
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,140
I can't believe you're doing this to me.
I've come all this way to help you.

584
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,735
- You're insane!
- For one day find me irresistible.

585
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,652
Stop it.

586
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:11,788
Is something wrong?

587
00:43:14,162 --> 00:43:17,766
I guess it's just the way
you've always talked about George.

588
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:21,302
It always seemed...

589
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:24,005
seemed like--

590
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:27,942
- It sounded like George was--
- Gay?

591
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,432
Actually, yes.

592
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,807
Common misconception.

593
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:37,886
It is.

594
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:43,381
George likes to pretend
that he's gay.

595
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,888
And why would you do that?

596
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,536
I find it attracts women.

597
00:43:54,536 --> 00:43:57,138
Indeed.
Worked for me.

598
00:43:57,138 --> 00:43:58,628
Big time.

599
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:04,872
Right.

600
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:12,819
Oh, my God.
Race you to the altar.

601
00:44:14,055 --> 00:44:16,124
- Underplay.
- Got it.

602
00:44:16,124 --> 00:44:18,226
I'm Jules' fiance, George.

603
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:22,564
Just in town for a quick pre-conjugal
visit, it you catch my drift.

604
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:23,997
I do.

605
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:27,736
- You're going to humiliate me.
- Only if I can.

606
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:30,371
Just one thing.
Stay away from--

607
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:32,999
George! Oh, my God!

608
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:39,748
- I don't know why I'm so carried away.
- Me neither.

609
00:44:39,748 --> 00:44:41,181
It's so--

610
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,919
Against God's plan?

611
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:47,889
No! It's just wonderful !

612
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:50,187
It's so wonderful!

613
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:55,695
Mom!

614
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:03,104
- What?
- You have to meet George.

615
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:05,607
You must be
Kimmy's little sister.

616
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:09,210
Julianne's fiance.
They're going to be married.

617
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,446
- What's going on?
- Julianne's getting married.

618
00:45:11,446 --> 00:45:13,982
- Why didn't you tell us?
- There hasn't been time.

619
00:45:13,982 --> 00:45:17,452
I wanted to. I wanted
to shout it from the rooftops...

620
00:45:17,452 --> 00:45:21,122
but Jules said,
''No, Pumpkin, no.

621
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:22,624
This is Kimmy's day.

622
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:25,058
Let's not take the attention
away from Kimmy.

623
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:28,129
Dear, sweet...

624
00:45:28,129 --> 00:45:30,757
adorable,
chocolate-covered Kimmy.''

625
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:34,402
Those were her very words.

626
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:36,404
I think I'm gonna cry.

627
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:38,306
Me too.

628
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:41,142
This is so sweet of you
to come to our rehearsal.

629
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:43,278
I insist you stay for lunch.

630
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:45,246
- No, absolutely--
- Love to.

631
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:48,917
Love the bag, love the shoes,
love everything. Love to.

632
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:52,910
- Darling, what about your flight?
- Canceled.

633
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,997
I can tell you this now,
but I was very worried about you.

634
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:04,666
About me?

635
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:07,602
All those stories that Michael told me
were hilarious...

636
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:11,639
but all those broken relationships,
all those men.

637
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:14,976
It must have hurt going through so many
guys and never finding the right one.

638
00:46:14,976 --> 00:46:18,707
She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensy little me.

639
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:23,214
And the man of your dreams
was always there.

640
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:28,349
She's talking about me.

641
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,859
Yes, Darling?

642
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:35,196
- How did you and Julianne meet?
- George is my editor.

643
00:46:35,196 --> 00:46:37,532
But, Poopy,
we met a long time before that.

644
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:41,302
Actually,
it's a very romantic story.

645
00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:44,372
would you like to tell it,
Sweet Pea?

646
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:46,966
- It's private.
- Not anymore.

647
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:51,713
I first met Julianne...

648
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,977
in a mental institution.

649
00:46:55,383 --> 00:46:57,719
Julianne was there visiting
some French chef...

650
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,888
she'd sent insane
with a bad review...

651
00:46:59,888 --> 00:47:02,356
and I was there
visiting Dionne Warwick.

652
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:06,261
He thought he was Dionne Warwick.

653
00:47:06,261 --> 00:47:10,431
- Who is Dionne Warwick?
- Sacrilege, darling.

654
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:12,100
She's Whitney Houston's aunt.

655
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,402
She's very good
on the Psychic Friends Network.

656
00:47:14,402 --> 00:47:19,271
- Isn't she?
- Do you know the way to San Jose

657
00:47:25,413 --> 00:47:28,583
There I was with Dionne.
His real name, by the way, is Jerry.

658
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:32,086
We were having a sing-along,
then suddenly...

659
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:35,924
breezing through the doors
from the shock therapy room...

660
00:47:35,924 --> 00:47:37,592
I saw her.

661
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:40,220
A vision in pink.

662
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,099
- You don't wear pink.
- She does.

663
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:47,602
Sometimes she does wear pink.

664
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:50,371
- You do.
- I do.

665
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:52,640
l said to Dionne...

666
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,077
''Dionne, who is this vision?

667
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:59,948
Surely, she must be the understudy
to some fabulous Broadway star.

668
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:02,450
Look at her skin.
Who does her hair?''

669
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:05,353
- In that moment, I knew.
- We don't all need to know--

670
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:06,786
We do!

671
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:14,128
- I'm very curious.
- They do.

672
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:16,631
I knew...

673
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:19,300
that someday
we'd end up like this:

674
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,136
like some glittering...

675
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:25,936
Doris Day-Rock Hudson
extravaganza.

676
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:29,077
l said to Dionne...

677
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:32,480
''Dionne, I'm in love.

678
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,316
Could this siren love me?

679
00:48:35,316 --> 00:48:38,152
Are the gods that kind?''

680
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:43,590
And Dionne turned to me,
opened her lovely eyes and said...

681
00:48:50,198 --> 00:48:51,756
What did she say?

682
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:56,329
The moment I wake up

683
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,377
Before I put on my makeup

684
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:05,642
I say a little prayer for you

685
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:10,183
While combing my hair now

686
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:14,789
While wondering
what dress to wear now

687
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:18,359
I say a little prayer for you

688
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,963
Forever and ever
you'll stay in my heart

689
00:49:21,963 --> 00:49:23,631
And I will love you

690
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:26,534
Forever and ever
We never will part

691
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:28,036
Oh, how I love you

692
00:49:28,036 --> 00:49:31,039
Together forever
That's how it must be

693
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,075
To live without you
would only mean

694
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:36,811
Heartbreak for me

695
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:38,972
Go, Granddaddy!

696
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:43,373
l run for the bus, dear

697
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:47,852
While riding
l think of us, dear

698
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,221
At work I just take time

699
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,492
And all through
my coffee break time

700
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:23,521
My darling, believe me

701
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:30,459
For me there is no one but you

702
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:35,069
- Please love me too
- Answer his prayer

703
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:38,106
- And I'm in love with you
- Answer his prayer now

704
00:50:38,106 --> 00:50:40,199
Answer my prayer, baby

705
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:44,036
Say you love me too

706
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:10,436
all right, now!

707
00:51:12,473 --> 00:51:15,143
- Heartbreak for you, actually.
- You've made your point.

708
00:51:15,143 --> 00:51:20,513
Get on your plane. I'll call at the turn
of the century when I've forgiven you.

709
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:26,320
- It never would have worked out.
- Because it was dishonest.

710
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,810
Different temperaments.

711
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:33,692
Look, tell him you love him.

712
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:36,930
Bite the bullet.

713
00:51:48,176 --> 00:51:50,011
What will he do?

714
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:51,945
''Be Careful
Watch Your Step''

715
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:01,856
He'll choose Kim.

716
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:04,792
You'll stand beside her
at the wedding...

717
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,955
kiss him good-bye
and go home.

718
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,290
That's what you came here to do.

719
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:15,468
So do it.

720
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:35,056
George isn't my fiance, Michael.

721
00:52:35,056 --> 00:52:36,857
It's been over for ages...

722
00:52:36,857 --> 00:52:39,060
but he can't accept it.

723
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,896
I'd built you up so much...

724
00:52:41,896 --> 00:52:45,166
l couldn't let him lose face
in front of you.

725
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:50,661
He could never stack up to the one man
I measure everyone against.

726
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:58,845
This is strange.

727
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:02,917
I gotta tell you, when you--

728
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:06,011
When you told me that you were
marrying George...

729
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:11,616
I got this really strange--

730
00:53:14,595 --> 00:53:16,529
You were jealous?

731
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:24,197
Crazy jealous.

732
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:27,740
I'm sorry.

733
00:53:34,382 --> 00:53:37,579
Can we maybe spend some time alone
this afternoon?

734
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:43,579
would that be ail right?

735
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:15,790
I've been thinking a lot
the Last couple of days, about us.

736
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,587
Have you?

737
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:24,760
- There are a lot of memories.
- It's more than that.

738
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:31,260
It's kind of embarrassing
to say it this way, but...

739
00:54:32,807 --> 00:54:35,910
you've sort of been,
you know...

740
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,572
the woman in my life.

741
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:43,551
You've been the man in mine.

742
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:46,620
And I was thinking
this could be our last time...

743
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,612
alone together, you know?

744
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:54,762
Except for that hot affair
we'll have twice a year.

745
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:56,696
Except for that.

746
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:09,176
I mean, you commit
to this wedding...

747
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:13,881
and then it seems
like there's this momentum...

748
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:16,441
and then you forget
you chose it.

749
00:55:22,189 --> 00:55:24,425
You and I didn't--

750
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:28,896
In our relationships
with other people...

751
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:33,333
we didn't use
the word love a lot, did we?

752
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:39,540
Kimmy says
it you love someone...

753
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,109
you say it.

754
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:44,270
You say it right then,
out loud.

755
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:49,683
Otherwise,
the moment just--

756
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,617
Passes you by.

757
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:16,109
We don't even have a song.

758
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:21,438
Kimmy and I don't have a song.

759
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,885
Do you think that's a bad sign?

760
00:56:28,622 --> 00:56:30,724
Someday

761
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:33,727
When I'm awfully low

762
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,096
And the world is cold

763
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:40,658
l will feel a glow
just thinking of you

764
00:56:42,536 --> 00:56:47,667
And the way you look tonight

765
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,811
Is your dance card tilled?

766
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:54,181
I'd have to check.
I keep it on Powerbook these days.

767
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:56,115
Is that right?

768
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,255
With each word

769
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:04,247
Your tenderness grows

770
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:09,652
Tearing my fears apart

771
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:16,704
With each laugh
that wrinkles your nose

772
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:20,538
Touches my foolish heart

773
00:57:59,346 --> 00:58:00,779
Excuse me.

774
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:07,555
- I thought Michael was picking me up.
- I said I'd drop you at the stag.

775
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:10,724
He's got a lot to do.
I'm the unofficial best man.

776
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:13,294
Of course.

777
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:18,299
Kim said when Michael turned the job
down that there was no friction.

778
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:20,434
Friction? No.

779
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,269
Good.

780
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:25,072
I haven't caused a problem,
have I?

781
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:27,404
You haven't. Nobody has.

782
00:58:29,076 --> 00:58:31,879
Listen,
you're just a little bit early.

783
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:33,881
Actually, I needed
to make some phone calls.

784
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:36,650
- Is it possible to use your office?
- of course.

785
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,175
- At the end of the hall on the left.
- Thank you.

786
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,952
Take your time.

787
00:58:50,764 --> 00:58:52,698
E-mall.

788
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:57,234
''File'' ''New Letter'' ''Open'' ''Close''
New letter.

789
00:59:03,777 --> 00:59:08,382
To: Eric Isaacson...

790
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:14,321
''Mall Out''
Senior editor, Sport Magazine.

791
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:18,087
From: Walter Wallace.

792
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,964
You can do this. It's easy.
Just do it fast, get it over with.

793
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:25,898
It's like it never happened.

794
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:31,105
Eric, I need a favor.

795
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:35,409
My daughter's
every happiness...

796
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:37,244
is in your hands.

797
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:41,215
I have offered Mike O'Neal...

798
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:43,917
my new son-in-Law...

799
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,720
a great opportunity...

800
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,922
in my company.

801
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:52,426
To his own detriment...

802
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:54,428
Michael will not...

803
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:58,432
accept our offer...

804
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:02,266
while he works for you.

805
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:30,431
My daughter joins me
in this plea...

806
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:34,101
for your cooperation.

807
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:38,338
With gratitude, Walter.

808
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:40,306
''Do You Wish To Send?''
''Yes'' ''No''

809
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:44,569
Why would I send this?
He'd get tired.

810
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:49,010
''Save For Later'' ''Delete''

811
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:54,286
Save for later.

812
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:01,261
It's not like I'm sending it.

813
01:01:01,261 --> 01:01:04,231
I'm just saving it
for a few hours...

814
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:07,101
till we come back here and...

815
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:08,936
Michael can see it.

816
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:11,268
Perfectly harmless.

817
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:52,177
''Wallace Company''

818
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:07,094
Send out this, this,
not this, this.

819
01:02:07,094 --> 01:02:09,062
That's it.

820
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:13,600
I'm holding tour or five e-malls
I wrote over lunch. Send those too.

821
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,004
- Yes, sir.
- Bye.

822
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:18,904
all set?

823
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,910
I can't believe this!
Did you try every key?

824
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,312
It's no big deal.
She just gave us the wrong keys.

825
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:29,283
There's got to be a janitor
or a guard...

826
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:32,853
or a cleaning woman
or, you know, some kind of--

827
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:37,658
Somebody has to be in this building!
I need a brick.

828
01:02:37,658 --> 01:02:39,956
What's the big deal
about getting this tile tonight?

829
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,797
- I'm up against a deadline.
- Me too.

830
01:02:43,797 --> 01:02:46,733
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- That's my point!

831
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:49,169
Everybody will be busy
with more important things...

832
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:51,738
and this is really my last chance.

833
01:02:51,738 --> 01:02:54,775
If I could just get up to Walter's
office, they're by the computer.

834
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,111
Then I could just e-mail
those figures right out now!

835
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,880
Tomorrow's Sunday.

836
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,949
Nobody's doing business.

837
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:06,477
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
Walter will walk you right up there.

838
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:09,722
Give it up, kid.

839
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:12,724
Can't win them all.

840
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,173
Good night.

841
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:40,449
This thing mean
that much to you?

842
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:45,192
We'll use the phone
in your room.

843
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:47,527
Walter's probably not even asleep.

844
01:03:47,527 --> 01:03:50,530
- I'll drive you up there.
- Thank you !

845
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,834
We'll get the right key,
and we'll go back to the office.

846
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:56,603
If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow,
you'd better be there.

847
01:03:56,603 --> 01:03:58,505
I'll be there.

848
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:03,677
These are all from Eric.
This fax is from Eric too.

849
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:06,246
My wedding. You'd think my boss
would leave me alone.

850
01:04:06,246 --> 01:04:08,180
Maybe it's Congratulations.

851
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:20,688
What is it?

852
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:30,604
''Mike, I can't believe I'm doing this to
you on the night before your wedding...

853
01:04:30,604 --> 01:04:34,908
but I think you need
and deserve...

854
01:04:34,908 --> 01:04:36,842
to know what
you're marrying into.

855
01:04:41,148 --> 01:04:44,709
I received the following e-mall
this afternoon:

856
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:49,878
'Eric, I need a favor.
My daughter's every--'''

857
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:54,461
Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.

858
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:56,997
- Is anything wrong?
- No, I'm just tired.

859
01:04:56,997 --> 01:04:59,693
Please put her on.
Thanks.

860
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:05,170
could you give me a minute?

861
01:05:06,974 --> 01:05:08,407
Please?

862
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:59,121
Excuse me, miss.
Are you locked out?

863
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:05,797
Just stepped out.
It's a no-smoking room.

864
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:10,404
It's a nonsmoking floor too.

865
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:14,207
Maybe you could go down
to the lobby.

866
01:06:14,207 --> 01:06:16,232
Why don't you have me arrested?

867
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:20,113
I mean it.

868
01:06:20,113 --> 01:06:23,810
I am a dangerous, criminal person.

869
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,814
I do bad things
to honest people.

870
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:33,960
You can make a citizen's arrest.
I wouldn't struggle.

871
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,451
It'd be like getting AI Capone
on tax evasion.

872
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:47,168
Can I help you, miss?

873
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:54,640
Do you smoke, Richard?

874
01:06:55,382 --> 01:06:57,951
Yes, I do, but--

875
01:06:57,951 --> 01:06:59,748
It's a nonsmoking floor.

876
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:04,923
But you know what?

877
01:07:26,913 --> 01:07:32,249
You know,
my grandmother always said...

878
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:37,323
''This too shall pass.''

879
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:42,160
Thanks, Richard.

880
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:10,991
l want you to quit this shit.

881
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:12,424
It'll kill you.

882
01:08:16,963 --> 01:08:18,396
What happened?

883
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,803
It's over.
She denied it.

884
01:08:23,803 --> 01:08:26,740
She said
I was crazy and paranoid.

885
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:29,776
A bad combination.

886
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:31,311
There's a big...

887
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:35,015
brunch tomorrow morning
at her parents' house.

888
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:37,779
She said,
''How could I call it oft?

889
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:42,077
What am I supposed
to tell everyone?''

890
01:08:43,857 --> 01:08:46,189
It's for the best.
It really is.

891
01:08:47,027 --> 01:08:48,961
She was right.

892
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:53,132
I am crazy...

893
01:08:55,635 --> 01:08:58,126
to tall for someone
I hardly knew.

894
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:05,343
I'm so glad you're here.

895
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:15,750
Have you still got that ring?

896
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,000
I tried it on,
and it won't come off.

897
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:12,536
Why don't we take a walk
or have some food sent up?

898
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:17,651
I just want to be alone.

899
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:19,986
Is that okay?

900
01:10:19,986 --> 01:10:21,419
Sure.

901
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:29,663
Maybe I'll go back to New York
for awhile and hang with you.

902
01:10:29,663 --> 01:10:34,467
Eric will understand.
Or we could go somewhere...

903
01:10:34,467 --> 01:10:35,900
if you want.

904
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,066
''If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento--''

905
01:10:41,508 --> 01:10:43,442
I've never been to Texas.

906
01:11:32,525 --> 01:11:34,459
''Brown''

907
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,813
You what?

908
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,495
- Can I try that?
- Sure.

909
01:12:30,283 --> 01:12:32,342
- Excuse me.
- Good Luck.

910
01:12:35,488 --> 01:12:37,791
So this is your basic
call-off-the-wedding party?

911
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:41,494
I came here to confront everybody.
I won't slink away like some coward.

912
01:12:41,494 --> 01:12:44,264
Besides, she hasn't told anyone.
l don't know what I'm supposed to do.

913
01:12:44,264 --> 01:12:48,360
There is a wedding at 6:00.

914
01:12:55,141 --> 01:13:00,340
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?

915
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:07,143
I made a decision.
It's over.

916
01:13:09,055 --> 01:13:10,989
I'll go tell them.

917
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:17,255
First,
do you think she's all right?

918
01:13:18,198 --> 01:13:20,393
could you
check on her for me?

919
01:13:24,304 --> 01:13:27,296
These are the most beautiful flowers
I've ever seen.

920
01:13:31,044 --> 01:13:32,477
How is he?

921
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:37,917
He's sort of wondering...

922
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:41,216
why you haven't told your parents
that the wedding's oft.

923
01:13:42,856 --> 01:13:46,626
I don't know. I'm still hoping
for a miracle, I suppose.

924
01:13:46,626 --> 01:13:50,196
How could he think that
my father and I would do such a thing?

925
01:13:50,196 --> 01:13:53,290
I only minored in psych,
you understand, but...

926
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:58,238
maybe Michael couldn't commit
to this marriage...

927
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:00,974
so he created...

928
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:02,475
a delusion...

929
01:14:02,475 --> 01:14:05,445
produced an unconscious,
psychosomatic...

930
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,379
manifestation of--

931
01:14:10,116 --> 01:14:11,708
I'm better with food.

932
01:14:14,254 --> 01:14:18,892
You're Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.

933
01:14:18,892 --> 01:14:22,295
You order...

934
01:14:22,295 --> 01:14:24,388
crème brulee for dessert.

935
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:28,301
It's beautiful. It's sweet.

936
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:32,038
It's irritatingly perfect.

937
01:14:32,038 --> 01:14:34,707
Suddenly, Michael realizes...

938
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:37,443
he doesn't want crème brulee.

939
01:14:37,443 --> 01:14:42,278
- He wants something else.
- What does he want?

940
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:47,314
- Jell-O.
- ''Jell-O''?

941
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:52,892
- Why Jell-O?
- He's comfortable with Jell-O.

942
01:14:52,892 --> 01:14:56,195
Jell-O makes him comfortable.

943
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:58,398
I realize
compared to crème brulee...

944
01:14:58,398 --> 01:15:01,367
it's Jell-O,
but maybe that's what he needs.

945
01:15:03,403 --> 01:15:04,961
I could be Jell-O.

946
01:15:06,606 --> 01:15:09,275
Crème brulee
can never be Jell-O.

947
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:12,045
You could never be Jell-O.

948
01:15:12,045 --> 01:15:15,315
- I have to be Jell-O.
- You'll never be Jell-O.

949
01:15:15,315 --> 01:15:20,520
Tell your parents. lf you're waiting
for that ''do you take this man'' part...

950
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,715
- it's considered poor form.
- I love him.

951
01:15:23,923 --> 01:15:26,326
Whatever delusions
I drove Michael to...

952
01:15:26,326 --> 01:15:28,328
there's truth
at the heart of it.

953
01:15:28,328 --> 01:15:31,664
I want him to work
for my father.

954
01:15:31,664 --> 01:15:34,827
I want to stay in school,
and I want a life of my own.

955
01:15:36,035 --> 01:15:39,801
Please, tell him it's my fault
and I love him.

956
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,538
You're the only person
that I trust.

957
01:15:49,616 --> 01:15:52,346
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

958
01:16:05,465 --> 01:16:07,667
How is she?

959
01:16:07,667 --> 01:16:11,034
- Knock it off!
- Yes, sir!

960
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:15,441
- I asked you--
- She admits that it's her fault.

961
01:16:15,441 --> 01:16:18,069
Totally, completely,
inexcusably her fault.

962
01:16:21,481 --> 01:16:23,449
Do you think
she still loves me?

963
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:30,490
Love is a strong word...

964
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:33,059
and I don't know that
I'm necessarily qualified--

965
01:16:33,059 --> 01:16:37,163
I guess I wouldn't be totally oft base
it I said that, in her way...

966
01:16:37,163 --> 01:16:39,961
she does possess
strong feelings--

967
01:16:45,705 --> 01:16:47,639
Sure, she does.

968
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:50,543
She's crazy about you.

969
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:54,570
You fill up my senses

970
01:16:55,548 --> 01:16:59,211
Like a night in the forest

971
01:17:00,653 --> 01:17:06,059
Like the mountains
in springtime

972
01:17:06,059 --> 01:17:08,728
Like a walk in the rain

973
01:17:08,728 --> 01:17:11,060
Tell her I'll marry her
at 6:00...

974
01:17:12,131 --> 01:17:14,065
it she'll still have me.

975
01:17:16,302 --> 01:17:18,133
Please.

976
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:24,210
Like a sleepy blue ocean

977
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:27,202
I'll be right back.

978
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:36,679
Come love me again

979
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,834
What did he say?

980
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:56,941
He said...

981
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,913
''Marry me.''

982
01:18:06,552 --> 01:18:10,156
Thank God you were here.

983
01:18:10,156 --> 01:18:12,358
I got so contused.

984
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:13,791
It happens.

985
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:16,394
Got a minute?

986
01:18:18,431 --> 01:18:19,864
What's up?

987
01:18:31,577 --> 01:18:34,847
I have to say this quick or I'll
just have this massive coronary...

988
01:18:34,847 --> 01:18:37,984
and then you'll never hear it,
and you have to.

989
01:18:37,984 --> 01:18:42,955
This is, by far, the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.

990
01:18:42,955 --> 01:18:48,361
So dumb, in fact, that I can't.
But I'm gonna.

991
01:18:48,361 --> 01:18:49,885
What's wrong?

992
01:18:57,603 --> 01:19:01,140
I love you.
I've loved you for nine years.

993
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:05,545
I've just been too arrogant
and scared to realize it.

994
01:19:05,545 --> 01:19:07,780
Now I'm just scared.

995
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:11,651
I realize this comes
at a very inopportune time...

996
01:19:11,651 --> 01:19:15,747
but I really have this gigantic
favor to ask of you.

997
01:19:18,124 --> 01:19:21,027
Choose me. Marry me.

998
01:19:21,027 --> 01:19:24,019
Let me make you happy.

999
01:19:25,231 --> 01:19:27,600
That sounds like three favors,
doesn't it?

1000
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,033
But--

1001
01:20:09,342 --> 01:20:12,140
- Lovely together.
- Aren't they?

1002
01:20:15,915 --> 01:20:19,817
That's our maid of honor.
She's from New York.

''Floral Design/Special Events''
Michael, wait!

1004
01:20:38,571 --> 01:20:40,664
Please! You'll never catch her!

1005
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,012
Doesn't anybody
leave their car unlocked?

1006
01:20:46,012 --> 01:20:49,081
Nobody trusts anybody anymore?

1007
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:51,117
A good Samaritan.

''Auto Memory Storing''
There's just

1009
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:55,788
Too little of

1011
01:20:57,823 --> 01:20:59,492
Come back here!

''Shy tendrils of russet pleasure...

1013
01:21:03,262 --> 01:21:06,595
began their unbidden journey.

1014
01:21:07,633 --> 01:21:09,135
She moaned.

The tonnage of years of anguish,
sacrifice, mingling with--''

1016
01:21:13,706 --> 01:21:16,142
It is not going well !

1017
01:21:16,142 --> 01:21:20,413
This is what comes of telling the truth
or even part of it!

1018
01:21:20,413 --> 01:21:23,649
- Getting what you deserve isn't fair.
- Where are you?

1019
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:28,321
I have stolen a bread van, and I'm
chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue!

1020
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:30,756
This is all your fault!
I told him the truth !

1021
01:21:30,756 --> 01:21:32,758
I said that I loved him,
and I kissed him.

1022
01:21:32,758 --> 01:21:35,428
- This is what's happened!
- Jules, a question.

1023
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:38,664
When you kissed Michael,
did he kiss you back?

1024
01:21:38,664 --> 01:21:40,666
What do you mean?
We were lip to lip!

1025
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:44,762
Was there anything there leading you
to believe this chase will end happily?

1026
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:48,040
That's beside the point.
We were interrupted.

1027
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,776
- Who interrupted you?
- Kimmy! She ruined everything!

1028
01:21:50,776 --> 01:21:53,279
And Michael started chasing her
before he could answer me.

1029
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:54,914
Michael's chasing Kimmy?

1030
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:56,782
You're chasing Michael?

1031
01:21:56,782 --> 01:21:59,852
Who's chasing you?
Nobody. Get it?

1032
01:21:59,852 --> 01:22:01,420
There's your answer: Kimmy.

1033
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,723
Jules, you are not the one!

1034
01:22:03,723 --> 01:22:07,860
Now, for God's sake,
the wedding is at 6:00 p.m.

1035
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,318
You have a small, but distinct, window
of opportunity to do the right thing.

1036
01:22:30,116 --> 01:22:32,050
''Exit'' ''Canal St.''

1037
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,163
all aboard!

1038
01:22:52,705 --> 01:22:54,138
Excuse me.

1039
01:23:53,065 --> 01:23:55,501
I have a confession to make.

1040
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:57,867
Another confession.

1041
01:24:03,042 --> 01:24:07,877
Besides that I love you,
this is even worse.

1042
01:24:14,653 --> 01:24:18,589
The e-mall that Walter sent
to your boss--

1043
01:24:23,329 --> 01:24:25,320
I wrote that.

1044
01:24:28,434 --> 01:24:31,198
I'm the bad guy.

1045
01:24:32,204 --> 01:24:33,706
Are you crazy?

1046
01:24:33,706 --> 01:24:36,903
Are you completely insane?

1047
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:41,705
l mean, Jules,
how could you do that?

1048
01:24:43,182 --> 01:24:47,219
It wasn't supposed
to get sent.

1049
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:49,517
I just wanted you
to get mad at Kimmy.

1050
01:24:52,892 --> 01:24:54,325
God.

1051
01:24:57,196 --> 01:25:00,633
I have done nothing
but underhanded, despicable...

1052
01:25:00,633 --> 01:25:04,899
not even terribly imaginative things
since I got here.

1053
01:25:13,078 --> 01:25:17,947
I was just trying to win you...

1054
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:21,810
to win you back.

1055
01:25:22,888 --> 01:25:25,288
But that doesn't excuse
any of it.

1056
01:25:26,659 --> 01:25:28,149
I'm pond scum.

1057
01:25:30,863 --> 01:25:32,498
Lower, actually.

1058
01:25:32,498 --> 01:25:36,902
I'm like the fungus that feeds
on pond scum.

1059
01:25:36,902 --> 01:25:38,426
Lower.

1060
01:25:41,173 --> 01:25:44,176
The pus that infects the mucus...

1061
01:25:44,176 --> 01:25:48,112
that cruds up the fungus
that feeds on the pond scum.

1062
01:25:56,288 --> 01:25:58,483
On the other hand...

1063
01:26:01,293 --> 01:26:02,726
thank you...

1064
01:26:04,563 --> 01:26:06,758
for loving me that much.

1065
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,535
That way...

1066
01:26:09,535 --> 01:26:11,469
it's pretty flattering.

1067
01:26:13,005 --> 01:26:15,940
Except it makes me fungus.

1068
01:26:16,742 --> 01:26:20,508
That part I knew.

1069
01:26:30,823 --> 01:26:32,256
God.

1070
01:26:36,095 --> 01:26:38,529
I'm glad you didn't get
on that train.

1071
01:26:41,467 --> 01:26:43,628
I came here looking for her.

1072
01:26:46,105 --> 01:26:50,405
- Why would she be here?
- This is where I proposed.

1073
01:26:53,512 --> 01:26:57,549
l had to cover a game in Milwaukee,
and she saw me off.

1074
01:26:57,549 --> 01:27:01,212
The train was starting
to leave and...

1075
01:27:03,055 --> 01:27:06,218
I jumped up on the step
and I held the handle...

1076
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:10,062
and without...

1077
01:27:10,062 --> 01:27:13,429
a thought in my head,
I just shouted, ''Marry me.''

1078
01:27:15,701 --> 01:27:21,401
The train was pulling out,
and she just suddenly screamed, ''Yes!''

1079
01:27:23,575 --> 01:27:25,099
Just once.

1080
01:27:26,845 --> 01:27:28,779
And blew me a kiss.

1081
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:43,261
It would've been
a nice wedding.

1082
01:27:45,698 --> 01:27:48,734
You can't believe
that you've lost her.

1083
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:53,505
You will find her, and you'll look
into her eyes and see all that love.

1084
01:27:53,505 --> 01:27:58,377
I just hope that it's soon.
Or else I'd hate to be you at 6:00.

1085
01:27:58,377 --> 01:28:00,346
Just wait.

1086
01:28:00,346 --> 01:28:02,181
We'll split up.

1087
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:05,851
You will go to every romantic place
the two of you have...

1088
01:28:05,851 --> 01:28:11,256
and I will go someplace brilliant,
and we'll find her.

1089
01:28:11,256 --> 01:28:13,747
We will find her.

1090
01:28:17,429 --> 01:28:19,798
Wallace egregious residence,
Mandy speaking.

1091
01:28:19,798 --> 01:28:22,234
it’s Jules.
Have you gotten a call from Kimmy?

1092
01:28:22,234 --> 01:28:25,404
She slipped out, the little monkey,
during the commotion.

1093
01:28:25,404 --> 01:28:27,339
''Commotion''?

1094
01:28:27,339 --> 01:28:31,610
My sister was licking an ice sculpture,
and her tongue froze right to it.

1095
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,012
And that's a commotion?

1096
01:28:34,012 --> 01:28:36,014
It's a sculpture of the David.

1097
01:28:36,014 --> 01:28:37,950
So Kimmy would be--

1098
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:41,320
She's probably with Michael
doing the nasty.

1099
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,256
Either that or crying in her nachos
down at Comiskey Park.

1100
01:28:44,256 --> 01:28:46,291
- Excuse me?
- I had this crank call...

1101
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:48,627
from some guy who says he saw her
in the luxury box.

1102
01:28:48,627 --> 01:28:51,697
- Right.
- What would a bride be doing--

1103
01:28:51,697 --> 01:28:53,699
Can you bring my dress
to the church?

1104
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:56,435
I have to pick something up
for the ceremony.

1105
01:28:56,435 --> 01:28:58,835
Don't forget to shave now.

1106
01:29:00,773 --> 01:29:03,008
Here we go.
Here's the hair dryer.

1107
01:29:03,008 --> 01:29:05,077
There we go.

1108
01:29:05,077 --> 01:29:09,013
It's going to be okay.
Please, no pictures.

1109
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:14,284
''Federal Express''

1110
01:29:27,132 --> 01:29:29,601
I know you're in here.
The guard saw you come in.

1111
01:29:29,601 --> 01:29:32,365
Just leave me alone,
you bitch!

1112
01:29:39,011 --> 01:29:41,914
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1113
01:29:41,914 --> 01:29:44,349
- Cat fight!
- You came here...

1114
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:48,287
pretending to be my friend,
and I made you my maid of honor!

1115
01:29:48,287 --> 01:29:51,957
Who asked you to do that?
You knew me what, eight minutes?

1116
01:29:51,957 --> 01:29:54,626
Michael trusted you,
so I trusted you.

1117
01:29:54,626 --> 01:29:58,363
You wanted to keep me close.
You didn't trust me for a second.

1118
01:29:58,363 --> 01:30:00,833
- I was right!
- of course you were right.

1119
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:03,936
- But that's not my fault.
- You kissed him!

1120
01:30:03,936 --> 01:30:05,938
- At my parents' house!
- That's cold.

1121
01:30:05,938 --> 01:30:07,539
On my wedding day!

1122
01:30:07,539 --> 01:30:09,341
- Bitch.
- Tramp.

1123
01:30:09,341 --> 01:30:11,343
Shut up!

1124
01:30:11,343 --> 01:30:13,779
Now I love this man,
and there is no way...

1125
01:30:13,779 --> 01:30:19,274
I'm going to give him up to some
two-faced, big-haired food critic!

1126
01:30:22,888 --> 01:30:25,624
all right.
Okay, all right!

1127
01:30:25,624 --> 01:30:27,057
I kissed him.

1128
01:30:28,527 --> 01:30:31,928
I tried to steal him.

1129
01:30:36,268 --> 01:30:37,701
I lost.

1130
01:30:43,308 --> 01:30:47,904
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.

1131
01:30:54,953 --> 01:30:58,445
I haven't done much that I'm proud of
the last three days.

1132
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:05,163
I'd like to take you
to the church...

1133
01:31:05,163 --> 01:31:08,133
so you can walk down
that aisle...

1134
01:31:08,133 --> 01:31:10,624
and marry the man
of our dreams.

1135
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:14,796
Because he sure wants
to marry you.

1136
01:33:08,086 --> 01:33:12,958
So raise our glasses and wish Mike
and Kim every happiness...

1137
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:15,290
for a long and happy life
together...

1138
01:33:16,595 --> 01:33:19,723
filled with happiness.

1139
01:33:22,768 --> 01:33:26,101
- I guess that's it.
- To the bride and groom.

1140
01:33:32,878 --> 01:33:35,972
Now let's hear from the maid of honor,
the lovely Julianne.

1141
01:33:46,425 --> 01:33:48,791
I had the strangest dream.

1142
01:33:50,529 --> 01:33:55,228
I dreamt that some psychopath was
trying to break the two of you up.

1143
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:05,635
Luckily, I woke up and I see...

1144
01:34:07,345 --> 01:34:11,281
that the world
is just as it Should be...

1145
01:34:14,653 --> 01:34:16,985
for my best friend...

1146
01:34:18,523 --> 01:34:20,650
has won the best woman.

1147
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:33,734
I didn't get you a gift.

1148
01:34:35,941 --> 01:34:37,209
However,
this is on loan...

1149
01:34:37,209 --> 01:34:40,645
However,
this is on loan...

1150
01:34:43,281 --> 01:34:46,478
until you two
find your song.

1151
01:34:50,689 --> 01:34:53,920
Someday

1152
01:34:55,894 --> 01:34:59,057
When I'm awfully low

1153
01:35:00,265 --> 01:35:03,291
When the world is cold

1154
01:35:04,903 --> 01:35:08,240
l will feel a glow

1155
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:14,012
Just thinking of you

1156
01:35:14,012 --> 01:35:17,971
And the way you look

1157
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:20,540
Tonight

1158
01:35:22,287 --> 01:35:27,247
Oh, but you're lovely

1159
01:35:29,294 --> 01:35:32,161
With your smile so warm

1160
01:35:34,533 --> 01:35:37,730
And your cheeks so soft

1161
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:42,874
There is nothing for me

1162
01:35:42,874 --> 01:35:47,208
But to love you

1163
01:35:48,613 --> 01:35:51,844
Just the way you look

1164
01:35:52,818 --> 01:35:54,718
Tonight

1165
01:36:07,499 --> 01:36:10,400
- It's mine!
- I don't think so!

1166
01:36:14,472 --> 01:36:16,064
I got it!

1167
01:36:45,303 --> 01:36:46,827
Bye.

1168
01:37:34,786 --> 01:37:37,188
Hey, gorgeous,
having a good time?

1169
01:37:37,188 --> 01:37:40,492
Not particularly,
but I did what I came to do.

1170
01:37:40,492 --> 01:37:42,694
What? You split them up?

1171
01:37:42,694 --> 01:37:44,562
No, I said good-bye.

1172
01:37:44,562 --> 01:37:47,232
Good girl.
I'm proud of you.

1173
01:37:47,232 --> 01:37:49,601
Be prouder still
if you were dancing.

1174
01:37:49,601 --> 01:37:51,836
I have big plans for dancing.

1175
01:37:51,836 --> 01:37:55,807
Just give me 30, 35 years.

1176
01:37:55,807 --> 01:37:57,609
The misery...

1177
01:37:57,609 --> 01:37:59,144
the exquisite tragedy.

1178
01:37:59,144 --> 01:38:02,113
The Susan Hayward of it all.

1179
01:38:02,113 --> 01:38:05,717
l can picture you there sitting alone
at your table in your lavender gown.

1180
01:38:05,717 --> 01:38:07,285
Did I tell you
my gown was Lavender?

1181
01:38:07,285 --> 01:38:10,422
Hair swept up.
Haven't touched your cake.

1182
01:38:10,422 --> 01:38:14,793
Probably drumming your fingernails
on the white linen tablecloth...

1183
01:38:14,793 --> 01:38:16,962
the way you do when you're
really feeling down.

1184
01:38:16,962 --> 01:38:20,465
Perhaps looking at those nails thinking:
''I should've stopped...

1185
01:38:20,465 --> 01:38:24,102
my evil plotting to have that manicure,
but it's too late now. "

1186
01:38:24,102 --> 01:38:27,806
I didn't tell you
my dress was lavender.

1187
01:38:27,806 --> 01:38:29,874
Suddenly, a familiar song.

1188
01:38:29,874 --> 01:38:33,241
The moment I wake up

1189
01:38:34,946 --> 01:38:37,972
And you're off your chair
in one, exquisite movement...

1190
01:38:40,685 --> 01:38:43,922
wondering, searching,
sniffing the wind...

1191
01:38:43,922 --> 01:38:46,424
like a dapple deer.

1192
01:38:46,424 --> 01:38:48,560
Has God heard your little prayer?

1193
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,196
Will Cinderella dance again?

1194
01:38:51,196 --> 01:38:55,394
And then, suddenly,
the crowds part...

1195
01:38:57,102 --> 01:38:58,535
and there he is:

1196
01:38:59,871 --> 01:39:02,974
sleek, stylish...

1197
01:39:02,974 --> 01:39:05,744
radiant with charisma.

1198
01:39:05,744 --> 01:39:08,880
Bizarrely,
he's on the telephone.

1199
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,440
But then, so are you.

1200
01:39:13,918 --> 01:39:15,943
And he comes towards you...

1201
01:39:17,222 --> 01:39:19,156

Bond. Jane Bond.
