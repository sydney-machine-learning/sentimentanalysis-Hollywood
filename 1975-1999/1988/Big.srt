00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,390
<i>"You are standing
in the cavern of the evil wizard.</i>

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,650
<i>All around you are the carcasses
of slain ice dwarfs. "</i>

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,070
Melt- Melt wizard.

4
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,620
<i>"What do you want
to melt him with?"</i>

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,040
What do you think
I want to melt him with?

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>I told you to take out the garbage!
Just a second!</i>

7
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,750
Throw thermal-

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,840
<i>Josh! Didn't you hear what
your mother said? One minute!</i>

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,470
<i>Joshua Baskin!</i>

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,810
<i>"Your hesitancy
has cost you dearly.</i>

11
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,060
"The wizard,
sensing your apprehension,

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,600
"unleashes a fatal bolt
from the ice scepter.

13
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,360
<i>With luck, you will thaw
in several million years. "</i>

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,320
Great.

15
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,410
<i>Come on, Josh. It's starting
to stink up the place.</i>

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, okay, okay.

17
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,050
Take the garbage out.
Every day, take the garbage out. There!

18
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,510
The teams are being led into the field,
and the crowds are going crazy! Yeah! Yeah!

19
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,930
And wait a minute. It's the Yankees'
star pitcher coming out of the bullpen.

20
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,680
Look at him! And the crowds
are cheering. They're going crazy!

21
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,140
They're screaming! Is Billy
there? Okay. In the back.

22
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,730
Rick Rhoden is on the mound
for the Yankees.

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,860
He looks into the catcher's mitt,
shakes off the first signal,

24
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,400
<i>takes the turn.</i>

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,070
He wipes the sweat off his brow,
leans back and fires.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,160
<i>Yeah! Good-bye,
Mr. Spalding!</i>

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
Here, here. Wait.

28
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,840
Got it, need it,
need it, got it.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,250
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey!

30
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,800
You ever go by Simpson's desk
when she's grading papers or somethin'?

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,550
She leaned over,
you can see right down her shirt.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,890
No.
Swear to God.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,390
Bra? No, no. She's got one
of those undershirt things.

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,270
So if you get real close to the board,

35
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,820
you can see all the way down
to her flowers.

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,820
Whoa!

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,530
Yeah. Give me your gum.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,990
Need it, got it, got
it, need it. Hey, hey.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,830
<i>- Give me a dollar! Give me-
- Oh, my God. It's Cynthia.</i>

40
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,420
How did a geek like Freddie Benson
get a sister like that?

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Beats me.

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,300
<i>- I mean, imagine having a boyfriend like that.
- Hi, Josh.</i>

43
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,350
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. It's Billy.

44
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,390
Come on!
Don't start.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,310
He says hi!

46
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,020
- Come on, Miss Cheapo. A quarter! A quarter.
- Unbelievable!

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,570
God. She likes you. I know she
likes you. I'll find out, okay?

48
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,240
# Shimmy, shimmy, koko bop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock #

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,870
# Shimmy, shimmy, koko bop
Shimmy, shimmy rock #

50
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,490
# I met a girlfriend
A Triscuit #

51
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,250
# She said a Triscuit
a biscuit #

52
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,710
# Ice cream soda pop
vanilla on the top #

53
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,290
# Ooh, Shalida walkin' down
the street 10 times a week #

54
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,960
# I meant it, I said it
I stole my mama's credit #

55
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,010
# I'm cool, I'm hot Sock you in
the stomach three more times ##

56
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,510
Don't forget to call
me after supper. Okay.

57
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,470
Remember about Cynthia.
Don't worry!

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,690
I'm as interested
as you are.

59
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,690
This isn't fair.

60
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,440
<i>Buddy, we've been
talkin' about this for months.</i>

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,570
You knew this was gonna happen
when Rachel got older.

62
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,240
- Why can't she stay in your room?
- Because.

63
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,660
<i>Bein' part of a family
means sharing responsibilities.</i>

64
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,370
Great. But do I have to share my room?

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,250
<i>I'm a person.
I am not your maid.</i>

66
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,500
Can any of you appreciate that?

67
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,340
<i>You waltz in here like
it's some kind of a resort-</i>

68
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,300
<i>lounging around, waiting
for your dinner to be cooked,</i>

69
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,810
<i>your clothes to be ironed.</i>

70
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,600
<i>What about me, huh? Have you ever
once thought about how I feel?</i>

71
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,320
Do you know what it's like to work
eight hours and come home to this?

72
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,190
<i>Every single day?</i>

73
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,570
None of you
ever offer to help me!

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
<i>Why?</i>

75
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,500
I can't do it alone anymore.

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,460
Just can't.

77
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,630
<i>And if you tell them anything
that goes on in this room,</i>

78
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,630
well, you'll be sorry.

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
So, will you tell me?

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,430
- You're in.
- What do you mean, I'm in?

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,810
- Cynthia Benson.
- What about her?

82
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,780
You ready for this?
She doesn't like Barry anymore.

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,530
- So?
- So what do you mean, "so"? That's it. She's available.

84
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,410
<i>Billy, it doesn't mean-
Josh.</i>

85
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,330
Hey, it's after midnight.

86
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,380
<i>Now, say good night to Billy.
Good night, Billy. I gotta go.</i>

87
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,090
Good night, Mrs. Baskin!

88
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,920
Sweet dreams.

89
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>All right. Come on.</i>

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,440
<i>One dollar. Come on, kid.</i>

91
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,860
<i>Watch this. Need some help
with the hammer?</i>

92
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,440
<i>Okay. I'm ready.
Here I go. Here I go.</i>

93
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,660
<i>I get one more try. One more try.</i>

94
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,280
Okay, honey.
Big smile. Big smile.

95
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,120
Go! Go! Go!
Good. Good.

96
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh, "wimpy"!
Better luck next time.

97
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,170
Let me get one more try? Please?
Come on! I can't live with "wimpy. "

98
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,800
Mommy! Make it stop!

99
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,590
<i>You sure you want to
go on this thing, son?</i>

100
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,470
Yeah. No, no. I don't
know about this one, Bob.

101
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,440
<i>No, this looks too scary.
It's okay.</i>

102
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,940
Oh, my God.
See? I told you.

103
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,610
<i>He doesn't want to go on it.</i>

104
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,860
Son, you don't have to go on this
thing if you don't feel like it.

105
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,660
No, no. It's just that I-
I want to go on myself.

106
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,870
You do?
Yeah.

107
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,580
I think it's something
- Yeah, I think it's something I should do.

108
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,120
Great. Why don't we meet you
at the Ferris wheel?

109
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,170
Half hour.

110
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,340
Excuse me.
Hey!

111
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,130
What are you doing?
Come on, man.

112
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,970
Watch it.

113
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,720
Sal threw up on the other ride.

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,440
It was disgusting.

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,360
Josh?

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,530
Oh. Hi.
Hi.

117
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,820
Have you been on this before?

118
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,410
<i>This?
Yeah.</i>

119
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,570
- Yes.
- Is it scary?

120
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,250
- Yes.
- Are you here alone?

121
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,500
Yes.

122
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,170
Look. Aren't those
your parents?

123
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,260
<i>Where?
Right over there.</i>

124
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,420
Honey! Smile!

125
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,930
Why, yes.

126
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,100
Hey, who's this?
This is Josh Baskin.

127
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,220
How you doin'?
This is Derek.

128
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,350
<i>- He drives.
Next.</i>

129
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,360
<i>Go ahead.
Yo, next!</i>

130
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,570
<i>Go ahead.
Yo, next!</i>

131
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,650
<i>Whoa! Read this sign.</i>

132
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,200
"You must be at least this big
to ride this ride. " What? Oh.

133
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,990
Hey, I don't make
the rules, kid.

134
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,200
Next! Next!

135
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,750
Well, it's a stupid rule.

136
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,540
<i>Look, why don't you
try the Kiddie Whip?</i>

137
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,170
<i>Yeah, it's about time.
You. You.</i>

138
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,760
See you, Josh.
No problem. Step up.

139
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,810
Hey, watch it, kid! Hey.
Come on, you guys. Let's go.

140
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,760
"Drop 25 cents here. "

141
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,400
Come on!

142
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,910
<i>Work! Work!</i>

143
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,890
Neat!

144
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,440
Make my wish. Right.

145
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,780
I wish I were big.

146
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
"Your wish is granted. "

147
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,040
<i>Somebody's gonna get you!</i>

148
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,960
<i>Come on. Go! Come on!</i>

149
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,150
<i>What's the matter?</i>

150
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,360
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

151
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,490
No.

152
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,410
<i>Honey, you'll wake up
your brother.</i>

153
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,580
Shh. Come on. Come on.
You sleep with us.

154
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,050
Easy, doggie! Easy!
Don't make me do it.

155
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,050
I'm only part-time. Sorry.

156
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,840
Josh!

157
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,060
Josh!

158
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,650
<i>Josh!
What?</i>

159
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,270
<i>It's 7:30. Are you up?</i>

160
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,570
<i>Come on, sleepyhead! You're gonna miss
the bus, and I can't drive you today.</i>

161
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,470
What does he do
in his sleep?

162
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,700
<i>Honey? I put out
some clean clothes.</i>

163
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,200
Bring down your dungarees
and stuff for the laundry, okay?

164
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,830
- Okay.
- You getting a cold, Josh?

165
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,000
<i>No. Fine.</i>

166
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,710
He's got a cold.

167
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,840
Now Rachel's gonna get a cold, I'm gonna
get a cold, his father's gonna get a cold.

168
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,400
Oh, my God.

169
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,110
<i>Breakfast is ready, Josh.
Be right there!</i>

170
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,880
<i>Josh! Hurry up!
Your eggs are getting cold.</i>

171
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,300
Hold this. Hold this. Good.
Now, can you keep it a secret?

172
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,590
Yeah. Keep it a secret.

173
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Bring down Rachel
with you, all right?

174
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,940
Okay.

175
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,270
Come on. Come on.

176
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,650
Oh, yeah. Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

177
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,860
You want orange juice or-

178
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,280
What about your breakfast?

179
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,430
# Pardon me, boys Is that
the Chattanooga choo-choo #

180
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,100
<i># Track 29 #</i>

181
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,850
# Choo, choo, choo #

182
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,190
Don't. Please, don't! Don't!
Please! Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

183
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,950
No!
It's me.

184
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,450
It's Josh. Mom! Mom.
Stop it! Oh, God!

185
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,910
I made a wish last night.
Oh, please, stop!

186
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,080
I turned into a grown-up. I made
this wish on the machine. Go away!

187
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,170
It turned me into a grown-up.
Last night at the carnival. No! No!

188
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,130
My birthday's November 3.
Mom, I got a "B" on my history test.

189
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,130
<i>Here, take the purse. You can have
anything that's in it! Go away!</i>

190
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,930
M- M-M-My baseball team
is called the Dukes!

191
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,680
Uh, I made this for you.
Who are you calling?

192
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,810
I have a birthmark
behind my left knee!

193
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,360
- You bastard. What did you do to my son?
- I am your son, Mom.

194
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,780
- Where is my child? Where is my son?
- Oh, Ma! Ma! Ma!

195
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,110
Police!

196
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,070
Hands up!

197
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,700
<i>Hands up on defense!</i>

198
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,870
<i>Come on! All the way.
All the way.</i>

199
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,330
<i>It's all yours!
All right, stop!</i>

200
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,670
I'm open! Here! I'm open!

201
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,050
<i>Shoot it! Yeah!</i>

202
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,310
<i>Gentlemen, this period is over.
- You stink, Kopecki!</i>

203
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,230
<i>- Get back to the locker rooms and get on to your next class.
- Billy, you stink!</i>

204
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,270
Wash shirts and shorts.

205
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,610
<i>Billy, do us both a favor.</i>

206
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,360
<i>Put the balls in the equipment closet
and you practice your layup.</i>

207
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,570
<i>Horowitz, pick up that shirt
or I'll make you eat it. It stinks!</i>

208
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,370
<i>Let's go, gentlemen.
Hey, let's go now.</i>

209
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,530
Billy.
Yeah?

210
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,830
What?
It's me.

211
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,630
- It's Josh.
- Coach Barnes!

212
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,250
No! Wait a minute! Wait
a minute! Coach Barnes!

213
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,670
Billy, shut up! I'm your best
friend! Please, you gotta believe me.

214
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,010
Don't hurt me. I'll prove
it to you. Billy, please!

215
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,100
<i>Look, I'm not gonna hurt you!
Help! Help!</i>

216
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,720
Goddamn it,
Billy Francis Kopecki!

217
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,890
Look, I know I don't look
like myself, okay?

218
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,900
<i>But something really strange happened,
and I'm really scared! I need your help!</i>

219
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,520
<i>You're my best friend!
I can prove it to you.</i>

220
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,320
Um\E2\80 Oh! # The space
goes down, down, baby #

221
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,490
<i># Down, down the roller coaster

<i># Sweet, sweet Don't let me

# Shimmy, shimmy, rock Shimmy,

224
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,330
<i># I met a girlfriend

225
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,500
<i># She said a Triscuit
a biscuit #</i>

226
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,090
# Ice cream soda pop

230
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Josh?

231
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,770
You look terrible.

232
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,820
I know.

233
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,700
He had on a blue, uh, sweatshirt
with a hood on it...

234
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,700
that said "Giants"
across the front.

235
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,990
He-He ran in here.
He ran into the kitchen.

236
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,790
He followed me a-around
that pillar there,

237
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,750
and when I got into the kitchen, he turned
around and he pulled down his pants...

238
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
and he exposed his heinie.

239
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,300
I- I can't. I can't.

240
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,770
<i>I was in the house making gravy,
and I heard this commotion.</i>

241
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,140
<i>That's right.
We're at the scene right now.</i>

242
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,310
<i>We've talked to the mother.
She's pretty hysterical.</i>

243
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,020
<i>She's not making
any sense at all.</i>

244
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,690
<i>There's no ransom note,
no prints. There's no nothin'.</i>

245
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,780
<i>I'll tell you what\E2\80
file a report, be on the safe side.</i>

246
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,030
Shut up!
Bet he ran away.

247
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,240
Wish I could.
Want me to pack your bags?

248
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,750
It's me.

249
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,130
You couldn't wish
for a million dollars?

250
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Take that off. Don't worry.
I got it all figured out.

251
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,630
Go to the city,
lay low for a couple days,

252
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,510
find that Zoltar thing,
make your wish.

253
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,510
You'll be home by Thursday.

254
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,890
It grew all over.

255
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,140
- Hmm.
- Why can't I just tell them what happened?

256
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,650
You did, and your mom
tried to kill you.

257
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,110
I'm gonna get in one awful lot
of trouble because of this.

258
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,200
<i>They'll probably be so happy to see you,
you'll probably get a new bike out of it.</i>

259
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,570
Come on. Let's get going.
Oh!

260
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,590
Excuse me.

261
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,250
Thanks.

262
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,260
<i>She's a problem.</i>

263
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,260
<i>This is the time of day when
she gets cranky and she cries.</i>

264
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,260
She does it every day.

265
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,600
I'm not supposed to go to
New York without my folks.

266
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,520
You'll be all right. Here.

267
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,020
Where did you get that?
My father's sock drawer.

268
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,070
You stole it?
It's his emergency fund.

269
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,480
Fine! Fine. Fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

270
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,480
Kill the bitch. Kill her with
a knife. Kill her with a knife!

271
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,690
Kill the bitch. Kill the bitch.
Kill her with a knife.

272
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,190
Put it in. Bitch!
Kill the bitch!

273
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,360
Kill her!

274
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,910
<i>You lookin' for some fun tonight,
sweet thing? No, thank you.</i>

275
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,710
Hey, man. Spare some
change? No, not really.

276
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,880
Hey, this looks okay.

277
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,920
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

278
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,380
St. James, Josh.
It's religious.

279
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,100
<i>Stay out there all night,
all day and all night again?</i>

280
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,320
Hi.
Hi.

281
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,320
Uh, we would like
a hotel room, please.

282
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,330
17.50 a night for the room,
$ 10 deposit for the sheets.

283
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,750
Mm-hmm.

284
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
You go straight
to the top of the stairs.

285
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,670
The last door on the right,
next to the bathroom.

286
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,890
Wait a second.
I'll show you.

287
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
It smells bad.
Shh.

288
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,480
Have a pleasant stay.
Thanks.

289
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,900
<i>Hey, Angel! Get out
of that bathroom now!</i>

290
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,110
<i>He's in that bathroom
all night.</i>

291
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,280
<i>I don't want
to stay here by myself.</i>

292
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,990
<i>I can't help it, Josh.
I gotta be home by 10:00.</i>

293
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,660
Look, I'll cut classes tomorrow.

294
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,420
We'll find that Zoltar thing
before you know it, okay?

295
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,010
Just one night. All right?

296
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,880
<i>All right.
Good.</i>

297
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,510
- What if I can't sleep?
- It's probably better if you don't.

298
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,310
See you in the morning.

299
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,100
Well, you know, like, what time? 8:30.

300
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,070
I'd use the chain, if I were you.

301
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,610
<i>All right. Come on out.
Open the door.</i>

302
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,780
<i>Stay away from here.</i>

303
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,830
<i>If you don't have the money,
don't show us your face over here!</i>

304
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,890
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

305
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,150
<i>Get out! Watch the money! Give me that!</i>

306
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,650
Mom. Mom.

307
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,230
<i>You really think
we'll find it today?</i>

308
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,780
It's a big city, Josh. I bet
there's a million Zoltar machines.

309
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,030
Well, where should we
start first?

310
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,830
I don't know. Oh, let-
Let's try the next street.

311
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,040
I told you, it's not a
video game. Then what is it?

312
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,290
Well, it's not a video game.

313
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,550
<i>This one's got a number on it.
Does yours?</i>

314
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,170
No. Wait. Here's one. What are
you doing? What are you doing?

315
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,390
What are you doing?
Do you have Zoltar?

316
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,350
No, I told you, I looked back
in the back. I've got Powerhouse-

317
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,850
We really need Zoltar.
I haven't got it.

318
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,400
What did the guy at the arcade
say? They have to license them.

319
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,110
And where are we?
Uh, the licensing bureau.

320
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,820
Right. So all we gotta do is get a list
of all the carnivals, then track it down.

321
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,780
Will you quit
your moping now?

322
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,910
<i>I'm not mopin'.
Can I help you?</i>

323
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,830
<i>- Yes. We would like a list of all carnivals and fairs.
- And arcades.</i>

324
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,040
Yeah.
Carnivals and fairs.

325
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,330
Try Consumer Affairs down
the hall, Room 111. Thank you.

326
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,590
Fill this out in triplicate.
Five dollar filing charge.

327
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,090
- See?
- One month to process. You get it in six weeks.

328
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,970
- Six weeks?
- Sometimes longer, but you could get lucky.

329
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,930
Next, please!

330
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,350
<i>Fill this out in triplicate.</i>

331
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,440
I'm gonna be 30 years old
for the rest of my life.

332
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,280
Would you come on?
We'll figure something out.

333
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,490
By the way, you may be
older than that.

334
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,620
So now what?

335
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,830
I'll come and see you
every day after school. How?

336
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,420
I'll tell them I made
the basketball team.

337
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,800
I won't have nothin' to do.
You can get a job.

338
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,630
Can't get a job. Why? Can't
be any different than school.

339
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,970
What are you good at? I
don't know. Making spitballs?

340
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,890
<i>How 'bout a delivery man?
I don't know how to drive.</i>

341
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,060
Yeah, right.

342
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,100
Cardiological technician.
Civil engineer.

343
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,230
You're not gonna eat
your cherry? Go ahead.

344
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,610
Clerical transcriber.
Billy.

345
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,400
Yeah.

346
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,540
Gross. God, that's gross!
Check, please.

347
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,580
- Go to the next column.
- Collection agent. Company clerk.

349
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,090
What? Computer operator. Read that one.

350
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,550
- Josh, will you quit with your stupid computers!
- Just read it.

- Toys!

Well, it's\E2\80 It's an old system,

Miss?

362
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,760
<i>You look good.</i>

363
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,850
MacMillan Toys!
There it is!

364
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,150
MacMillan Toys.
May I help you?

365
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,520
I'll connect you. Are
these the applications?

366
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,480
<i>Yes. Just have a seat. I'll
call your name. What's next?</i>

367
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,110
There.
Previous employment.

368
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Your paper route.
I don't think I can put that.

369
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,910
Neighborhood circulation director? Yeah!

370
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,580
<i>Yes. Hold on just a moment, please.</i>

371
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,040
<i>What's he got?</i>

372
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,260
Hey, don't worry about it.

373
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,630
Um, Social Security number?

374
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,260
32-17-25.

375
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,890
What is that?
It's my locker combination.

376
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,600
Great.
Mr. Baskin?

377
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,270
Mr. Baskin?
Y- Yes. Yes.

378
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,480
The personnel director
will see you now.

379
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,910
<i>Uh, your son can wait out here.</i>

380
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,450
Yeah, okay.
Son, you should sit down.

381
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,330
And don't give the lady
any trouble now. Sure, Dad.

382
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,170
This way.

383
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,380
<i>Don't forget-
look him in the eye!</i>

384
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,140
There's a couple of numbers
missing on your Social Security.

385
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,270
Oh. Oh, 12.

386
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,070
012.

387
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,610
- It says here you've got four years' experience.
- Yes.

388
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,490
<i>All on computers.
Yes.</i>

389
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,540
Where did you go to school?

390
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,750
It was- It was called
George Washington.

391
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,090
Oh, G.W. My brother-in-law
got his doctorate there.

392
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,970
- Did you pledge?
- Yes, every morning.

393
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,060
It happened again. David, the
girl is absolutely useless.

394
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,560
You have got to give me someone who
knows what she is doing. Excuse me.

395
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,360
I'm not getting any of my mail.
Nothing has been filed.

396
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,570
Ever since she got engaged,
my life has been a disaster.

397
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,780
Well, you know, she came
so highly recommended.

398
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,910
She spent the last three months writing
down her married name. Mrs. Judy Hicks.

399
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,490
Mrs. Donald Hicks.
Mrs. Judy Mitchellson Hicks.

400
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,160
Sometimes with a hyphen,
sometimes without a hyphen.

401
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,710
Sometimes she spells
the hyphen.

402
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,800
Well, I really don't know where I
can put her. Put her on unemployment.

403
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,510
- When can you start?
- Soon.

404
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,730
<i>MacMillan Toys. I'll transfer.</i>

405
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,810
Brent.
Susan.

406
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,440
Where's Mildred?
She's out sick.

407
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,030
Again.

408
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,450
<i>And it's easy to clean.</i>

409
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,200
<i>That's very important,
that you're easy to clean.</i>

410
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,200
<i>Open that one.</i>

411
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,620
What's so-
What's the joke?

412
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,790
Is it a small?
Oh, Miss Lawrence.

413
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,800
See, when she opens
her shower presents,

414
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,170
everything she says she'll say on her
wedding night, only she doesn't know it.

415
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,890
So, when we read the list to her
- Who's answering my phone?

416
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,180
Oh, it's pink.

417
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,220
Oh. I'll get it.

418
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,890
Oh, I needed towels.
Thank you very much.

419
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,110
Paul Davenport's office.

420
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,280
Can I help you? Susan
Lawrence. Is he in?

421
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,780
Of course.
Thank you.

422
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,490
Susan.
Paul.

423
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
If I don't have a man tonight,
I'm absolutely going-

424
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,000
Mr. MacMillan's on line two.
Yeah, I'll hold.

425
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,670
<i>An automatic switch-on-</i>

426
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,730
These are the preliminary voice
runs on Princess Gwendolyn.

427
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,100
All comments should be directed to
Jack Taylor no later than Thursday.

428
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,110
One day, I'll find my prince.

429
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,230
<i>Alternate version number one:</i>

430
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,030
One day, my prince will come.

431
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,150
<i>Alternate version number two:</i>

432
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,320
I want you to steal all the money
from Mummy's purse...

433
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,870
<i>and buy all my accessories.</i>

434
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,870
<i>The more you buy me,
the more I'll love you.</i>

435
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,080
Just kidding, Susan.

436
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,550
Tra-la. Tra-la.

437
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,520
I thought we'd start you off
on last week's preschool orders.

438
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,190
It should take a few days. Give you
a chance to find your way around.

439
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,030
Do you smoke?
Well, just that once, but\E2\80

440
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,780
Only on breaks,
and in the coffee room.

441
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,950
Most of that's pretty
straightforward stuff.

442
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,990
You have any questions,
come to me. Good luck.

443
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,830
Bye.

444
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,810

445
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,100

Psst.

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,940
Squirmy Hermie.

448
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,230
Psst!

449
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,450
Hey. Psst. Hey.
I'm Scott Brennen.

450
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,530
Uh, I-I'm Josh Baskin.

451
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,290
Listen, what are you trying
to do, get us all fired?

452
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,580
Huh? Gotta slow down. Pace yourself.

453
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,540
- Slowly. Slowly. Slow.
- Sorry.

454
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,460
- Today's my first day.
- I know.

455
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,720
So, how long have you
worked here? Five years.

456
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,720
Work stinks,
but the fringe benefits are great.

457
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,980
See that girl over there
in the red?

458
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,150
<i>Say hi to her,
and she's yours.</i>

459
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:00,030
She'll wrap her legs around you so
tight, you'll be begging for mercy.

460
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,820
Well, I'll stay away
from her then.

461
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,540
Excuse me.

462
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,750
Yeah. Brennen.
I gave it to you yesterday.

463
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,920
<i>Oh, here it is.</i>

464
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,670
<i>I don't have time to xerox it.
Let the new guy do it.</i>

465
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,920
Yeah. It-

466
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,010
<i>We still- We haven't
shipped it out yet.</i>

467
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,140
You gotta be quiet.
People are tryin' to work here.

468
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,140
Hey, wait!
They can't think.

469
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,850
We're gonna go in the other room
and see some toys. Come on.

470
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,230
Come on, you guys.
Stay together.

471
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,940
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

472
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,110
Trouble.

473
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,570
We're pregnant?

474
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,120
Huggy Bear took a nosedive.

475
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,120
<i>That's not possible.</i>

476
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,540
Look at these figures, Paul.
Third-quarter profits off 40%.

477
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,710
Pre-orders down 55.

478
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,920
I'm not talking about one toy.
I'm talking about the whole goddamn line:

479
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,090
<i>Huggy Bear Mama,
Huggy Bear Papa.</i>

480
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,130
Goddamn Baby's off 60%.

481
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,470
You must feel awful.

482
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,980
I must feel awful?
You must.

483
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Paul, uh-

484
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,030
Paul, I- I think we
must feel awful.

485
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,150
Well, yeah. I feel bad too.

486
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,740
This whole line was your idea.

487
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,740
I think that if you just march right in
and talk with MacMillan-

488
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,620
It's not my fault.

489
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,750
Honey, are we trying to fix this thing
or are we tryin' to place blame?

490
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,000
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go
in there with you while you talk to him.

491
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,800
Thank you.

492
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,630
Yeah.

493
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,180
I taught him
everything he knows.

494
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,230
<i>Mm-hmm. Right up.</i>

495
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,230
<i>Hi, this is Matthew

496
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,690
Yeah, well, I live
right over by the river.

497
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,770
<i>And I just need
to confirm your address.</i>

498
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,280
You ever seen Brooklyn
by dawn?

499
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,110
Hey, hey. Does it sound
like I'm beggin'? I am.

500
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,830
Hello?

501
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,040
Uh\E2\80

502
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,420
Hello?
Hello.

503
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,050
Mrs. Baskin?
Yes?

504
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,380
How are you?
Who is this?

505
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,810
I just wanted you
to know that, uh,

506
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,640
Josh is all right,
and he's okay and everything.

507
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,810
You have my boy?

508
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,810
Yeah, and y-you're gonna
get him back just the way he was.

509
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,650
Look, I swear to God,
if you do anything to him,

510
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,650
if you touch one hair
on his head,

511
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,910
I will spend the rest of my life
making sure you suffer.

512
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,120
Wow. Thanks.

513
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,700
Let me talk to Josh. Oh, he
can't come to the phone right now.

514
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,170
Why not? Why not?
What did you do to him?

515
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,000
I didn't do anything to him.
I think he's a terrific kid.

516
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,920
I want proof that he's all right.

517
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,090
Uh, all right.

518
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,720
Um, a-ask me something
th-that- that only he would know.

519
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,930
Then I'll ask him for you, and
that way you'll know that he's okay.

520
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,230
Ask him what I used to sing to him
when he was a little boy.

521
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,280
Isn't there something else that
you'd rather ask him? Ask him.

522
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,660
I got it. I got it.

523
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,130
# Memories #

524
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,800
# Light the corner of my mind #

525
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,630
# Misty watercolored memories #

526
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,840
# Of the way we were #

527
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,470
# Scattered pictures ##
Oh!

528
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,440
Look, you're gonna
see him again really soon.

529
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,940
I promise.
I cross my heart and hope to-

530
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,730
Uh, we'll talk about this later.

531
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,320
That's total bullshit, Paul!
But, sir, the favorability rating-

532
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,240
Let's not lie to ourselves. If a kid
likes a toy, it sells. That's all.

533
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,660
But every bit of research
and focus testing shows-

534
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,080
It worked in research. It worked in the
testing. It just didn't work with the kids.

535
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,670
Oh, sorry. Why don't you watch
where the hell you're going!

536
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,840
- Are you okay?
- I am fine.

537
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,800
You could kill somebody
running around here like that!

538
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,720
Paul, a boss should get knocked
on his ass once in a while.

539
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,350
<i>It's good for him. I don't know,
sir. You should see a doctor.</i>

540
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,510
<i>For crying out loud, Paul,
I'm fine! I'm fine!</i>

541
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,600
<i>- Sorry, sir. Sorry.
- Where were you going anyway, son?</i>

542
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,230
Um, I was, uh-

543
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,480
I was going to the Xerox room
'cause they needed these by 5:00.

544
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,440
Oh! That's good.
Nothing wrong with a little hustle.

545
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,320
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

546
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,700
Right, Paul?

547
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,080
It's good to see
a little hustle for a change.

548
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,410
What did he mean?

549
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,880
I hustle. Uh, sir? Sir!

550
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,410
Get down! Get down!
Get out of the area!

551
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,160
<i>He's got my money. Get 'im!</i>

Hello.

Uh, is this the Baskin residence? Yes.

587
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,110
Hi.
Who's this?

588
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,610
We're conducting a, uh-

589
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,610
a consumer s-survey
and we were wondering...

590
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:27,700
what kind of medicine...
you would give to your family.

591
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,000
For what?
For a stomachache.

592
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,420
Pepto-Bismol.

593
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,330
How-How often do you give
that? Every four hours.

594
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,300
I gotta go.

595
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,380
Every four hours.

596
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,380
Okay.

597
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,430
Thank you.

<i>Look at him!</i>

619
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,360
You work for me, don't you? Yes.

620
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,030
I thought so.
What, are you here with your kids?

621
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,200
No.

622
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,870
I got the last!
Did not.

623
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,040
I was just looking around.
Oh.

624
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:20,540
Me too. I come here
every Saturday.

625
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,090
You can't see this
on a marketing report.

626
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,880
What's a marketing report?

627
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,510
<i>Come on! It's my turn!</i>

628
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,600
Exactly. Come on.

629
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,640
What do you think of that?

630
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,810
The Championship Hockey?
Yeah.

631
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,980
Oh, I love it. Only that-
Only what?

632
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,400
Well, the pieces don't move.
What do you mean?

633
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,990
Well, on the old set, you could
slide the men up and down the ice.

634
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,330
Now all they do is spin around.

635
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,580
It's more like real hockey the
old way. Why'd they change it?

636
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,790
I don't know.

637
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,040
<i>See, the Starfighters are good because
you can change all the pieces you want.</i>

638
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,420
But I never liked
the Galacticons.

639
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,590
You only get one robot, and
they don't come with a vehicle.

640
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,380
I see. Plus, you can't take
'em underwater. If you do-

641
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,230
Neat.

642
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,910
Okay, uh,
let's check out the-

643
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,550
- Piano lessons?
- Three years.

644
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,550
Me too.
Every day after school.

645
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,780
Hey, hey!

646
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,210
# Madly #

647
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,470
What department did you say
you were in? I'm in Computers.

648
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,640
Computers?
Yeah. Yeah.

649
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,310
You just saved me
a trip to the gym, son.

650
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,020
According to the marketability studies,
this thing should go straight through the roof.

651
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,360
Hey! Hey! Watch it, fella. Sorry. Sorry.

652
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,320
<i>Vice president in charge
of product development.</i>

653
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,700
Vice president?
He's only been here a week!

654
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,200
And he came
from Data Processing.

655
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,120
He's out of his mind.
The old man has finally lost it.

656
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,920
Did you know he gave him
Bob's old office? Bob's-

657
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,040
Bob's office
is bigger than my office!

658
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,090
There's gotta be a reason. Things like
this don't happen unless there's a reason.

659
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,630
That means if the president dies,
you get to take over?

660
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,890
No. They got a hundred of 'em.
Are we ready? Yes, Mr. Baskin.

661
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,010
Come on in.

662
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,100
Look at this place. It's bigger
than the principal's office!

663
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,020
How would you know? Remember
that explosion in science?

664
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,310
Oh, yeah.
Truckapillar!

665
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,980
59.95.

666
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,860
- You know that only costs 10 bucks to make?
- Get outta here!

667
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,700
- What is this?
- Oh. They just put this in here. It doesn't mean anything.

668
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,910
So, what do they make you do
for all this?

669
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,630
Well, I play with all of this stuff, and
then I go in and tell 'em what I think.

670
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:37,090
- That's it?
- Yeah.

671
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,630
- And they pay you for that?
- Yeah.

672
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,180
Suckers!

673
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,680
Thank you, Miss Patterson.

674
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,680
Hey, Miss Patterson, could you
call Media and have them send up...

675
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,350
the video of the Giants-Broncos Super Bowl and
have them edit out the commercials and stuff?

676
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,690
Yes, Mr. Baskin.
Thanks.

677
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:59,780
- Miss Patterson.
- You're the luckiest guy I know.

678
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,160
Boom!

679
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,410
- Great.
- Mr. Davenport.

680
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,500
Try taking
some of the padding out.

681
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,750
Projected sales are gonna go
through the roof. Those test scores-

682
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,340
Whoa! Oh\E2\80 You know, this is
an office, not a playground.

683
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,380
Kill somebody-

684
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,100
Did you check Mattel?
Nothing.

685
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,770
<i>Time now to check
the day's business news.</i>

686
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,980
Coleco?
Zero.

687
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,440
He can't come from nowhere, Susan.
He has to come from somewhere.

688
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,770
<i>How 'bout Hasbro? Yes. And
Fisher-Price and Worlds of Wonder.</i>

689
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,740
<i>- I have called everywhere. Nobody's ever heard of him.
- This is just terrific!</i>

690
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,660
<i>It's not my fault.
Shh!</i>

691
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,530
- Today's arrests bring the
current total to 18- - I know him.

692
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,790
<i>Those under indictment include
five senior vice presidents\E2\80</i>

693
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,580
Now they're arresting businessmen? The new
American crime, tryin' to earn a living?

694
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,920
<i>...the most coveted position on Wall Street
- Baskin!</i>

695
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,760
<i>Susan, he has to come
from somewhere.</i>

696
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,010
<i>Let's face it, Paul. The guy comes
from Data Processing.</i>

697
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,930
<i>Terrific. That's just terrific.
This is just terrific!</i>

698
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,180
You're being paranoid, Paul.

699
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,850
<i>These tests were conducted
over a six-month period...</i>

700
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:19,900
<i>using a double-blind format of
eight overlapping demographic groups.</i>

701
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,030
<i>Every region of the country
was sampled.</i>

702
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:27,370
<i>The focus testing
showed a solid base...</i>

703
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,080
<i>in the nine-to-11-year-old
bracket,</i>

704
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,460
<i>with a possible carryover
into the 12-year-olds.</i>

705
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:41,550
<i>When you consider that Go Bots and
Transformers pull 37% market share\E2\80</i>

706
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,760
I'm sorry.

707
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,880
<i>and that we are targeting
the same area,</i>

708
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,550
<i>I think that we should see
one-quarter of that,</i>

709
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,720
and that is one-fifth of the total
revenue from all of last year.

710
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,770
<i>Excellent, Paul. Thank you. Thank you.</i>

711
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,110
<i>Any questions?</i>

712
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,400
No.
Not from me.

713
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,950
<i>Yes?</i>

714
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,700
- Yes?
- I don't get it.

715
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,950
What, exactly, don't you get?

716
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,040
It turns from a building
into a robot. Right?

717
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,340
Precisely.

718
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,090
Well, what's fun about that?

719
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,390
<i>Well, if you had read
your industry breakdown,</i>

720
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:34,180
you would see that our success
in the action figure area...

721
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:38,060
has climbed from 27% to 45%
in the last two years.

722
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,230
<i>There. That might help.</i>

723
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,480
Oh.

724
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,990
- Yes?
- I-I still don't get it.

725
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,330
What?

726
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:59,830
What don't you get, Josh? There's a
million robots that turn into something.

727
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,340
This is a building that turns into a robot.
What's fun about playing with a building?

728
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,840
<i>- That's not any fun.
- This is a skyscraper.</i>

729
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,840
Well, couldn't it be,
like, a robot that turns into,

730
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,850
like, a bug or something?

731
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,180
<i>A bug?
Yeah.</i>

732
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:20,480
<i>- A prehistoric insect with claws that could pick up a car.
- Interesting.</i>

733
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,650
A prehistoric Transformer?
Interesting.

734
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,900
- So the robot turns into a bug?
- Uh, gentlemen-

735
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,280
<i>You've got
a very good idea here!</i>

736
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,780
The robot
turns into a bug!

737
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,950
<i>This is a great idea!
Wh-</i>

738
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,660
Different sizes
- Susan, we could do ladybugs!

739
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,830
<i>You could have him wreck
buildings. Transformers for girls!</i>

740
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,330
A building is inert. A bug, it moves,
it's got all kinds of possibilities.

741
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,960
This doesn't just happen.
This guy- This doesn't happen.

742
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:51,090
He doesn't just come to a
meeting and say "bugs. " Uh-

743
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,300
Well done, Josh. Well done.

744
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,560
Oh-ho! He is vicious!

745
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,360
He's not vicious. Don't kid
yourself. That man is a killer.

746
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,860
All he said was,
he didn't get it.

747
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:11,030
"I don't get it. I don't get it.
Let's make it a bug!"

748
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,450
He was going for the throat,
trying to eviscerate me.

749
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:18,240
Did you see the look
on MacMillan's face?

750
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,040
Mm-hmm.

751
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,330
<i>It's quite a unique space.</i>

752
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,500
<i>The lines are so clean, and you don't
get any of that partition quality.</i>

753
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:32,050
It has 50-foot ceilings,
all hardwood floors,

754
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:35,430
ample closet space,
a modern kitchen,

755
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:40,390
<i>a brand-new bathroom
with a jet-stream Jacuzzi.</i>

756
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,940
We'll take it!

757
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,280
Baskin! Rental delivery!

758
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,820
Come out. Come out.

759
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,290
<i>Hey! What, are you nuts?
So close.</i>

760
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:07,960
<i>Dear Mom and Dad:</i>

761
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,800
<i>They said...</i>

762
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,300
<i>that I could write you...</i>

763
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,760
<i>and let you know I was okay.</i>

764
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,100
Whoa! Check it out!

765
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,810
<i>So far they're treating me fine.</i>

766
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,480
<i>I got enough to eat-
Two!</i>

767
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,150
<i>and am perfectly safe.</i>

768
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,280
<i># I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause
I'm workin' for a livin' # Rebound!</i>

769
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,740
<i>They say I'll get out of here-
Two!</i>

770
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,660
<i>in about a month.</i>

771
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,910
<i># Whoa-ohh
Takin' what they're givin' #</i>

772
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,380
<i># Whoa-ohh Workin' for a
livin' ## In the meantime,</i>

773
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,840
<i>it's a lot like camp.</i>

774
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,090
<i>I watch TV-</i>

775
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,260
I got it! I got it! I got it! Hooray!

776
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:04,270
<i>and even get outside...</i>

777
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,140
<i>once in a while.</i>

778
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,270
<i>I know...</i>

779
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,820
<i>you miss me,</i>

780
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,650
<i>but try not to worry.</i>

781
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,530
<i>I think...</i>

782
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,320
<i>this experience...</i>

783
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:21,410
<i>might even be good for me.
Knocked him out!</i>

784
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,330
<i>I love you very much...</i>

785
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,670
<i>and I know...</i>

786
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,170
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

787
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,340
<i>Your son,</i>

788
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,470
<i>Joshua.</i>

789
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:41,180
<i>P.S.</i>

790
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,600
<i>Give Rachel a kiss
from her big brother.</i>

791
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,190
Hey.
Oh, hey. Hey.

792
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,940
Sorry I'm late. The computers
were down for, like, 45 minutes.

793
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,900
There was nothing
I could do about it.

794
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,900
What is this?
It's a letter to my mom.

795
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,240
She's gonna feel- This is
terrible! No. You don't mail it-

796
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,580
You're gonna get her all screamin' and cryin'
- No, I'm not.

797
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,790
It's just a letter
to say I'm okay and stuff.

798
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,790
Come on.
Why can't I go with you?

799
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,380
Bill
- I told you, Billy. It's only for people in the company, so you can't.

800
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,920
I could be your assistant.
Billy!

801
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,510
Fine. Fine.
Just go to your fancy party...

802
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,970
while I stay at home by my mailbox
and wait for your stupid carnival list.

803
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,770
It's just this once, okay?
Sure.

804
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,900
Yes. That's a beautiful fit.

805
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,230
Here, Paul. Take this,
go over to the mirror,

806
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,400
put the hat on
and look at yourself.

807
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,490
What color would you call this?

808
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,910
<i>Can I help you? Yeah.
I'd like to rent a tuxedo.</i>

809
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:47,240
Uh, I see. Is-Is-Is there
any particular occasion?

810
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,500
Yeah. His company
is havin' a party.

811
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,170
Uh, well, then you probably
want something simple.

812
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:56,130
Maybe a nice black, uh,
with a p-p-p...

813
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,260
Whoa! Check it out.

814
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,260
Oh, wow. Feel that. What
do you think? I like it.

815
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,300
Look at these.

816
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:06,470
Uh, usually this type of tuxedo
is popular with students-

817
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,730
senior proms, juvenile dress-ups and
maybe a fancy p- Look at this one.

818
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,770
Ooh. What kind of tuxedo is this?

819
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,400
That's not a tuxedo!
That's a morning coat.

820
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,530
Well, what do you call this?
Ugly.

821
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,030
Oh, hey. I've got it.

822
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,370
Excuse me.
I'll be right back. Oy.

823
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:29,500
<i>I really wanna go home.</i>

824
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:34,130
<i>Maybe we got off on the
wrong foot. Let's start again.</i>

825
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,170
Hey, smell my neck.

826
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,340
Mm-mmm.

827
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,340
I was hopin' for a raise, sir. A raise.

828
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,720
Just-Just-Just a little one.
All right, a little one.

829
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,970
Kim. Have a good time.
I'll see what I can do.

830
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,350
Okay. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir. All right.

831
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,560
<i>Come on, George. You can't sell to
the parents. You sell to the kids.</i>

832
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,560
I disagree.

833
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:59,070
Listen. You hit 'em at 7:00 in the
morning while their folks are still asleep.

834
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,490
Then you get 'em good
and jacked up for three hours...

835
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,360
so that by 10:00,
they're rippin' the house apart.

836
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,620
It's timing, George. Timing.

837
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,540
You want that parent
to wake up...

838
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:15,210
listening to Little Jennifer
screaming, "Puppy Pal, Puppy Pal. "

839
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,420
It's very beautiful and I'm having a
lovely time. I'm delighted, Miss Patterson.

840
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:25,800
It's much better than last year.
I just wanted to tell you that.

841
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,140
How are you gents
doing here?

842
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:32,020
Double up on the scotch,
will you? Right away, sir.

843
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,480
<i>Here you are, sir.</i>

844
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,230
Susan.
Love your tux.

845
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,940
I think it's the same
as the maître d's.

846
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:50,700
Yeah. Have you decided what
you're doing on the Danbury line?

847
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,950
No, I haven't.

848
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,710
Well, uh, I think if you got
everyone's input up front,

849
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,340
I mean, right from
the beginning, you can-

850
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,170
Susan, have a drink.
What?

851
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:07,050
Have a couple of drinks.
It's a party.

852
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,350
It's a party.

853
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,810
Look at this!

854
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,160
Oh, God!

855
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,960
Josh! I'm glad
you could make it.

856
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,420
Bet he gets another raise.

857
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,130
<i>Now, that's
what I call a tuxedo.</i>

858
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,260
I rented it. This is a real bow
tie though. I tied it myself.

859
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:53,600
That's why I was late.
No, you're not late at all.

860
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,480
Let me show you around. There's Miss
Patterson. Hi. There's a guy from the meeting!

861
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:04,110
<i>- Would you like a drink\E2\80 uh, champagne, glass of wine?
- No, just some milk.</i>

862
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,280
Why not?
You on the wagon?

863
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,280
No, I'm at a party.

864
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,410
It works on your hips.

865
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,000
You need a whole other exercise
for your thighs. It's true.

866
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,250
Hi.

867
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,690
Let me grab
a plate here.

868
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:45,150
Excuse me.
This looks good.

869
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:48,780
...from the I.R.S. tells me
that I can't amortize like that,

870
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,200
s- so I show him the schedule,

871
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,200
and then he says, "It's not
accepted accounting procedure. "

872
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,290
I say, "You little pissant. "

873
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,080
Try a little bit of, uh-

874
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,880
That looks good.
Yeah.

875
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,470
Want to get a load of that guy.
He's a little overdressed.

876
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:19,180
Look, my feet really hurt.
Yeah? You want me to rub 'em?

877
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,480
You know, most people, they
don't know how to rub feet.

878
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,810
Think it's in the thumbs.
It's the knuckles.

879
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,400
Now put some eucalyptus
oil on- Just-Just dance.

880
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,820
It's great.
Oh, it's great.

881
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,820
I'm having a really good time.
I'm really excited about this.

882
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,830
Ignore him. Just ignore him.
I don't know him.

883
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:43,080
The guy's a goddamn knock-off
artist. What do you mean?

884
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:47,420
Amphibian?
He takes 10,000 G.I. Joes,

885
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:52,840
slaps some gills on 'em, webs
their feet, packages 'em in seaweed.

886
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:57,300
There's not supposed to be
pieces in mousse. Carrot.

887
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,960
Give me a break.
But the toy sold, Paul.

888
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,000
Excuse me.

889
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,590
Hi.
Hi.

890
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,260
All the same people having
all the same discussion.

891
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,890
It's like they cloned
some party in 1983...

892
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:47,730
and kept spinning it out
again and again and again.

893
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:51,110
I loved your ideas
on the Squeezy Doll line.

894
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,110
Thanks.

895
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:56,320
They were so... incisive.

896
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,160
"Incisive. "

897
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:02,790
It's beluga.

898
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:05,330
MacMillan orders it
every year.

899
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,460
Sidle up to him
and then ask for a raise.

900
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,560
Gesundheit.

901
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,810
You all right?

902
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,140
You okay?

903
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,690
<i>You want a glass of water?</i>

904
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:35,070
<i>Want something to drink? Could
I have a milk shake or something?</i>

905
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,160
I got a car outside.
You wanna get outta here?

906
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,120
- Uh-huh.
- Let's go.

907
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,500
Watch it!

908
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:51,540
<i>Did you see that?</i>

909
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,670
I'm not really
a big one for parties.

910
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,630
I like things that are
a little more... intimate.

911
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,890
Wow! Is this your car?

912
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,560
Well, it's the company's car.

913
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,230
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen! Yes, sir.

914
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,270
Sir.

915
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,990
Just seeing someone
in the office,

916
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,120
you don't really get
a chance to know them.

917
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,210
Just being with you here,
I really get a sense of-

918
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,500
of who you are.

919
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,670
You gonna eat these fries? No, no.

920
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,300
<i>Hey, mister, you want some of
these fries? No. No, thank you.</i>

921
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,140
See, it's hard,
in a business situation-

922
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:48,770
I mean, there's this invisible
line, and- and even if-

923
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:52,020
even if you're
attracted to someone-

924
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,900
You're gonna call
someone before-

925
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,480
No.

926
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:01,200
Uh, I mean,
at this point in my life-

927
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,910
Don't-

928
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:07,910
<i>Don't play with the ra-
Leave the, uh... Don't-</i>

929
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,330
I'm really vulnerable right now,
you know, and I-

930
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:15,460
I mean,
I love my job.

931
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,670
And-

932
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,970
And I-
Ejector seat!

933
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,260
<i># Hot in the city #</i>

934
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,550
<i># Hot in the city tonight #</i>

935
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:29,100
<i># All right #
This is great!</i>

936
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,650
<i># Hot in the city Hot in the
city tonight # Hey, come on up.</i>

937
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:38,030
<i># Tonight #
# Right ##</i>

938
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:48,410
That was my apartment.
Really?

939
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah. Love to see where you live.

940
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,800
Have you always
lived alone?

941
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,590
No, not always.
Oh.

942
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,680
Is it just recently, or-

943
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:12,140
Yeah. Give yourself a
couple of days. It'll pass.

944
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:15,690
Oh. They said it was
gonna take six weeks.

945
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,770
Well, it can be painful, but...

946
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,900
<i>that's what they invented
Xanax for, right?</i>

947
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:24,110
Watch your step.

948
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,490
Thank you.

949
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,000
I'm not sure
we should do this yet.

950
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,420
- Do what?
- Well-

951
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:41,420
I mean, I like you, and I
- I wanna spend the night with you.

952
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,180
Do you mean sleep over?

953
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,350
Well, is- Yeah.

954
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,560
Okay.
But I get to be on top.

955
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:17,790
You live here?
Yeah.

956
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,090
<i>- It's nice, isn't it?
# Sending you forget-me-nots #</i>

957
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,630
<i>Yeah.
# To help you to remember #</i>

958
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,640
You, uh\E2\80 You want a soda? Huh?

959
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,680
Soda? You want one? Yeah, sure.

960
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,940
<i>I rigged this up so you
don't need any quarters.</i>

961
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,110
Aah! No. No. Don't.
What?

962
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,780
The glue is not dry yet.

963
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,150
Sorry. It's okay.
Sorry.

964
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,530
You didn't break it.

965
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,660
You wanna play pinball?

966
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,790
No. You don't need quarters
for this either. It's free.

967
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,420
No, thank you.
Okay.

968
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,590
- Is that a trampoline?
- Yeah. You wanna try it?

969
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:09,930
- No.
- You should. It's really fun.

970
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:13,810
<i>It's simple too. Come on. You'll like it.
And it's really easy too.</i>

971
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:16,640
Do you have some wine, maybe
- Take off your shoes.

972
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,940
Oh, maybe
for a few minutes.

973
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,520
<i>It's easy. All right.</i>

974
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,400
<i># It's not hard to believe I
want you and I need you Come on ##</i>

975
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,820
It's really simple. Let me
just get my big balls off here.

976
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:33,740
- No, really, I-I- I'll watch.
- It's fun. I'll do it with you.

977
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:36,700
Up.
Excellent. All right.

978
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,870
<i>Help me up?
Sure!</i>

979
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,080
Okay.

980
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,670
- Okay. Jump.
- You want me to jump.

981
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,090
Yeah. Just jump.

982
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,850
There. Now can I have
a drink? No, no, no.

983
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:58,480
Look, really jump. Stand
there and get air. Go ahead.

984
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,730
Get some air between you
and the tramp... oline.

985
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,980
There.

986
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:08,650
Oh, come on. I'll do it with you,
to show you how it goes.

987
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,820
Ready? Come on. Jump.
See? That's all it is.

988
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,950
That's all there is to it. Good.

989
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,370
There you go.
There you go. Yeah.

990
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,290
It's easy. Anybody could do this.

991
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,420
Whoo!

992
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,520
Whoa!
How'd you do that?

993
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:45,020
Good!

994
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:50,940
Okay. I'm attacking China
from Mongolia.

995
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,740
Why do you smoke?
Oh.

996
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,990
That's, uh-
I lose two.

997
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,160
Mmm, yeah.
Okay.

998
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,380
Oh. Hi.

999
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,590
Here.
What?

1000
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,880
Pick one.

1001
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,890
That one.
Okay, try it again.

1002
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,600
That one.

1003
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:08,270
It's for you. It's a
glow-in-the-dark compass ring.

1004
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,650
<i>So you won't get lost.</i>

1005
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,920
<i>Good night.</i>

1006
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,940
<i>Jones Industrial Average-</i>

1007
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:57,200
<i>Have fun last night?</i>

1008
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,450
Sure. Yeah.

1009
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,280
Yeah.
Yeah, you left pretty quick.

1010
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,620
Gave him a ride home, Paul.

1011
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,750
- Oh. Did he enjoy it?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1012
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,210
<i>Ah, that's me\E2\80
Mr. Ridiculous.</i>

1013
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:12,500
Just a silly old guy.

1014
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:16,090
<i>Short-term credit conditions.
Yields fell slightly-</i>

1015
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,720
I don't feel like
going out tonight.

1016
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,890
What do you mean? They're
your friends. I know.

1017
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:26,680
Leave it! Leave it!

1018
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,850
<i>- # Hot in the city tonight #
- Would you quit it!</i>

1019
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:33,980
Do you have to play with everything?

1020
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,370
<i>Baskin?</i>

1021
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:56,090
Wouldn't you rather play
basketball? I know how to play that.

1022
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,840
We could be a team for
the MacMillan Company. No!

1023
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,470
I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give
it a try. My best sport's video hockey.

1024
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,930
That isn't a sport. Well, it
takes eye-to-hand coordination.

1025
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,020
It's not a sport if you don't sweat. What
about golf? You don't sweat, and that's a sport.

1026
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,730
And you're not sitting there
letting some machine do all the work.

1027
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:14,190
What about car racing?
Shut up, Baskin!

1028
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,780
What are the rules again?
I told you.

1029
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:21,740
Over the line on the serve. Yellow
is out-of-bounds. Play to 21. Ready?

1030
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,660
<i>Sorry. Sorry.
One-nothin'.</i>

1031
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:28,290
- Hold it.
- Get it! Get it! Get it! Attaboy.

1032
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:31,210
Okay. You ready? All right. Yeah.

1033
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,290
<i>Ho ho! Nice try!
That was in.</i>

1034
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:39,920
<i>Two-zip. Just made it two-zip.
Ready? Okay, here we go.</i>

1035
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,640
Oh!
It's in. Good. Point.

1036
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,480
<i>Whoa! What's the matter-</i>

1037
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,650
Wait a minute.
Time out. Time!

1038
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,990
- Backhand!
- Whoa!

1039
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,820
Yes!

1040
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,950
19-18. Uh, that was under the line.

1041
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,370
- What?
- You said it had to be over the line on a serve.

1042
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:16,080
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you said it had to be over the line on a serve.

1043
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:19,500
No, I did not!
Now, give me the goddamn ball!

1044
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:21,710
Well, that's cheating.

1045
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,010
Give me the goddamn ball, will ya? No!

1046
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:26,890
Give me the ball, you
little shit. It's my serve.

1047
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:31,060
Give me the goddamn ball! I
never said that! Yes, you did.

1048
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:35,520
Give me the\E2\80
Give me the ball.

1049
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,150
Give me the ball!

1050
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:41,150
<i>Give me the- Give
me the- This is new.</i>

1051
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,110
Come here.
Give me the ball.

1052
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,740
You're a cheater!
Give me the-

1053
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,950
<i>I do not cheat!
He cheats!</i>

1054
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:54,410
Give me the ball!

1055
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:00,590
Give- Give me the-
Give me the-

1056
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:05,380
Give me the ball! All right, let's
take it over. We'll take it over! Ow!

1057
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,010
He didn't have to punch me.

1058
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,430
I know.

1059
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,600
He's scared of you. Ohh.

1060
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:20,060
You don't play his game. I tried
to play his game. He beat me up.

1061
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:25,070
If he's scared of me,
then why did he punch me?

1062
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:29,660
He punched you
because he's scared of you.

1063
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,950
I don't get it.
It's just the way he is.

1064
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,580
Everything's a fight with him.

1065
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,920
Everyone's an enemy.

1066
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,500
It's not just a job for him.
It's a war.

1067
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:50,680
How come you're so nice?

1068
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,730
What? You work as hard as he
does, and you're not like that.

1069
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:58,020
You don't know me that well.

1070
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,400
Yes, I do.

1071
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:05,320
<i>You're one of
the nicest people I've met.</i>

1072
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,160
How do you do it?

1073
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:33,260
On the fast break. What a job.
Let's get this done.

1074
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:35,260
It's in the corner-
Oh. Go Knicks.

1075
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:38,060
Oh! Heartbreak!
He lost it.

1076
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:43,560
Must need a new center.
Good night.

1077
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:11,340
<i>Come in.</i>

1078
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,600
<i>Hey, Josh.
Hi.</i>

1079
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,520
<i>What time is it?</i>

1080
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,150
It's 10:00 or somethin'.
Mmm.

1081
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:25,440
<i>What are you
doin' here so late?</i>

1082
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,940
I finished up
on the Astro Blaster.

1083
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:32,110
So? What do you think?

1084
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,370
It's okay.

1085
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:40,080
<i>I know what you mean.</i>

1086
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:44,880
Astro Blaster, Laser Might-
They're all the goddamn same.

1087
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,960
Wasn't always that way.

1088
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:56,100
I remember
there was this duck once.

1089
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,470
You mean, like,
a- a rubber duck for the bath?

1090
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,850
No, no, no. Just a...

1091
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,940
little, wooden, quacky duck.

1092
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:11,400
And a string on the bottom and you pulled
him forward, he'd waddle from side to side.

1093
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:13,610
And I realized...

1094
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:20,200
if you put the head on a hinge,
just a little wooden dowel,

1095
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:27,000
then the beak would peck at the ground
when it pulls forward.

1096
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:30,800
See? Oh.

1097
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:35,470
Just- I had an idea.

1098
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,350
Look at this.
Come over here.

1099
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,600
You know what this is?

1100
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:50,360
It's a report on how to expand the heavy
adventure market past the 12-year-old cutoff point.

1101
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,610
- You can't do that. It doesn't work.
- Why not?

1102
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,030
Y- You can't keep a kid
from growing up.

1103
01:21:56,110 --> 01:22:00,870
<i>All a 13-year-old boy wants
is a 13-year-old girl.</i>

1104
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:04,910
<i>And I sure don't know
how to build one of those.</i>

1105
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:26,940
What's this?
What does it look like?

1106
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:30,730
Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two
neckties and your exercise tape.

1107
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:33,150
Susan
- And I want my keys back.

1108
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,570
Sure.

1109
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:43,450
It was just some scratches, honey.
He'll get over it.

1110
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,290
<i>It has nothing to do with him.
Oh, what is this, then?</i>

1111
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:48,580
Your one big moment
of redemption?

1112
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,670
Yeah. Yeah,
that sounds good to me.

1113
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,550
<i>Come on, Susan.
He's just another link in the chain.</i>

1114
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,470
<i>First it was Tom Caulfield.
Then Handlen.</i>

1115
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:01,100
Then Golding. Then me.
Am I missing somebody?

1116
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,640
It's not like that anymore.

1117
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,850
What is so special about Baskin?

1118
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,020
He's a grown-up.

1119
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,940
Susan-

1120
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,860
I can't believe
you brought up Golding.

1121
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:18,820
Can't believe you slept with him.

1122
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,460
Oh!

1123
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:31,130
<i>Catch. Catch the dough. Catch!</i>

1124
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:33,540
A little piece of dough over there!

1125
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:36,550
Here it come! Throw me
the dough. Right here.

1126
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:38,260
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

1127
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,510
Oh, my God!
Got him!

1128
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:47,100
<i>He's really good!</i>

1129
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:51,650
# Happy birthday to you #

1130
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,690
<i>Surprise!</i>

1131
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,940

<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

1137
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,510
You!
Hey.

1138
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:20,840
What are you gonna
wish for this time?

1139
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:32,440
I know what we can do. We can get
some beers and some dirty magazines-

1140
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,320
I can't, Billy. What? Of course
you can. It's your birthday.

1141
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,070
I have to go somewhere.
Where? Where?

1142
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:41,650
Um,

1143
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,910
well, I have to
go meet somebody and-

1144
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:50,410
So I got all night.
Yeah, I know, but, see, I-I just\E2\80

1145
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:54,250
Well, I can't right now.
But I'll call you. All right?

1146
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,630
Okay? I'll give you a call.

1147
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:02,090
<i>Thanks again, Billy!
It was fun!</i>

1148
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,140
Yeah. Fun.

1149
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:10,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

1150
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,650
- Do you want to come in?
- Sure.

1151
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,330
Sit down.

1152
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,270
Wanna go?
Yeah! Yeah.

1153
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:55,730
Okay.

1154
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,090
Wanna go again?

1155
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,600
How come you have
all these points?

1156
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,890
'Cause I'm just tappin' 'em.
You don't have to kill 'em.

1157
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:43,650
Rick Rhoden, on the mound.

1158
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:48,200
He takes the curve.

1159
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,160
Here's the windup
and the pitch.

1160
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,120
<i>Pick a prize.</i>

1161
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,210
<i>So they have these cars
that you can actually drive,</i>

1162
01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:00,840
except they're on this rail,
so you can't get off the road-

1163
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,630
You have a really big
gob of mustard right-

1164
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:05,630
<i>What?
Mustard.</i>

1165
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,010
- Where?
- Right there.

1166
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:14,930
- Is it gone?
- Well\E2\80

1167
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,100
Here.

1168
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,900
- That gone?
- Yeah.

1169
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:30,200
Listen.

1170
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,660
Oh, the music?

1171
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,830
Wanna dance?

1172
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,040
Dance?

1173
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:45,170
We don't have to if you
don't want to. Okay. Okay.

1174
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,590
All right.
Okay.

1175
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,220
Are you cold?
Mm-mmm.

1176
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:58,930
We could get some hot
chocolate, you know. Mm-mmm.

1177
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:01,060
You can wear my jacket
if you want.

1178
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,610
Come on. It'll be fun. I'm scared.

1179
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:08,320
What are you worried about? You're
with me, right? All right. You're on.

1180
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:29,510
Oh, I haven't done this
in a long time.

1181
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:42,060
What were you like
when you were younger?

1182
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:47,570
Oh, well,
I wasn't much different.

1183
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:50,320
I believe that about you.

1184
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:03,330
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

1185
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,340
It's crazy.

1186
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,550
In my car,

1187
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:15,300
lying in bed.

1188
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:22,060
I've just never gone out
with someone like you.

1189
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:27,440
With all the other men,
there was so much to hide.

1190
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,610
I feel like I can tell you anything.

1191
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:39,790
Susan? Susan?

1192
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:46,330
There's something
I think I should tell you.

1193
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,840
What?

1194
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:05,750
You want the light on?

1195
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:56,840
Good morning. Hey, Brent!
How are you? Good morning!

1196
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:59,220
<i>Hi, everybody!
Hi, Josh!</i>

1197
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,470
Josh. My man!

1198
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:04,680
<i>Good morning.
Good morning.</i>

1199
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:08,680
<i>Good morning, sir. I'd like some
coffee, please, Miss Patterson.</i>

1200
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,440
But you don't drink coffee.

1201
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,770
And, uh, make it black.

1202
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,780
It was a dream, honey.

1203
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:21,030
Atlantic City was beautiful
and Donald was so romantic-

1204
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:25,120
I know I'm late with this,
but congratulations, Mrs. Hicks.

1205
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:31,750
Barbara, you are not going
to believe this. Hold on.

1206
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,970
You know, you two should come to
Vermont. It is so pretty up there now.

1207
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:45,140
<i>We spent our anniversary
there. All you did was watch TV.</i>

1208
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:49,730
<i>I popped popcorn too. He
likes that intellectual stuff.</i>

1209
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:53,230
<i>Anybody happen to see that great
documentary about Columbus...</i>

1210
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,520
<i>on PBS the other night?</i>

1211
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:57,770
<i>Mm-mmm.
Uh, no. Was it good?</i>

1212
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:00,780
<i>I had no idea he had a fourth
ship. Yeah. The Santa Cristina.</i>

1213
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:04,240
<i>That's right. He only had
that on his second trip though.</i>

1214
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,160
- You saw it too.
- No.

1215
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:11,540
<i>But I-I used to... study, you
know, the stuff, so- Really?</i>

1216
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:15,920
Dad, I need some help with
my alge- Uh, not now, Adam.

1217
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,130
<i>- Yeah, Dad, you said-
- Adam, we have guests.</i>

1218
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:23,510
<i>He's had the roughest time with
algebra. We've tried tutors, everything.</i>

1219
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,640
<i>Mom! With algebra? I
used to study that too.</i>

1220
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,850
<i>Isn't that nice?</i>

1221
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,430
<i>Okay, look. Forget all the X's
and Y's stuff...</i>

1222
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,560
<i>'cause that was invented
by some teacher that hates kids.</i>

1223
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:35,560
All right.
Let's imagine that Larry Bird...

1224
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:38,570
is gonna score 10 points in
a quarter, okay? Yeah, okay.

1225
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:42,240
<i>- So how many points is he gonna score in
the entire game? - That's easy- 40 points.</i>

1226
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:45,610
<i>Exactly. That's algebra.
Righ- It is?</i>

1227
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:51,120
Yeah. See? Okay, one quarter is to 10
points that he scores in a quarter...

1228
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,460
<i>just as four-</i>

1229
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,710
You're right.
He's wonderful.

1230
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,170
<i>I know.
Ohh!</i>

1231
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:01,760
You can do this for earned run averages, field
goal percentages, whatever. That's pretty cool.

1232
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,880
<i>I don't wanna hear it anymore.</i>

1233
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:07,840
<i>You constantly bring
- What's home? This is my house.</i>

1234
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:10,930
<i>What's home? Fine.
It's your house, you pay for it.</i>

1235
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,270
<i>Billy, are you on the phone?
I'm doin' it.</i>

1236
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,730
<i>Hey, Billy, get off the
phone. Listen to your mother.</i>

1237
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:25,900
Mmm.
He's never done this before.

1238
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:30,080
Kind of like a sweepstakes. Get the
art department on the phone. Get them!

1239
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:33,830
Send out for some
sandwiches. Cajun or deli?

1240
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:36,500
Maybe next year, right?
Next year.

1241
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:40,130
<i>- You can do it. I know you can.
- I cannot plan a whole line.</i>

1242
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:43,760
Why? Nobody knows more about toys
in this entire company than you.

1243
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,840
Susan, that means marketing
and strategy and stuff.

1244
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:49,260
All he wants is a proposal. I can't-

1245
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,810
<i>You come up with the ideas, and
I'll handle the marketing. Excuse me.</i>

1246
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:55,600
But it\E2\80 Come on. It'll be neat.

1247
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,810
Oh, I- I don't know.

1248
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:02,610
I don't have any ideas for new toys
or anything. You've got great ideas.

1249
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:20,630
Cute. Can you walk the dog?

1250
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:26,010
Forget how to knock?
Oh, I'm sorry.

1251
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:41,310
<i>Hey! Hey, you guys!
Wait up for me!</i>

1252
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:55,790
"Department of Consumer Affairs"?

1253
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:01,080
Yeah, buddy! It came!

1254
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:05,460
<i>- He gives too much homework. What'd you get on the test?
- I got a "C."</i>

1255
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:12,340
<i>Do you have, like,
Sports Illustrated? Sure.</i>

1256
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:19,730
Here.
Two and a quarter, kid.

1257
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:27,440
<i>Hey. I got it. Oh, all
right. Comic books. Daredevil.</i>

1258
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:30,820
<i>Change.
Say, what's that one?</i>

1259
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:34,120
Trade. Yeah. This one's
got Billy in the coal mine.

1260
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,450
Think I've read this one.

1261
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:38,830
<i>I'll trade you for X-Factor.</i>

1262
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:44,750
It won't be like these, where
you just follow the story along.

1263
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:50,090
You would actually make a whole different
story appear just by pressing these buttons.

1264
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:52,720
An electronic comic book?
That's amazing.

1265
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,970
Yeah, a living comic book.
It's gonna be different every time.

1266
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,390
This is incredible.
You're brilliant.

1267
01:36:58,470 --> 01:37:03,400
If you liked one, you could see it
over and over and over again.

1268
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:06,150
You're-
You're wonderful.

1269
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:08,570
Do you really like it?

1270
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,490
Really?
Really.

1271
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:18,740
You think Mac'll like it?
I think he'll love it.

1272
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:24,580
We could do sports comic books, where, like,
if he's going to steal second or something.

1273
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:28,250
<i>We could have sports books-
baseball, football.</i>

1274
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,880
It would work for almost
any sport there is- hockey!

1275
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:35,390
- Wh-What is it we're doing?
- Huh?

1276
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:40,560
W- What's going on here?

1277
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,310
Well, you know, we're-

1278
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,320
<i>Something wrong?</i>

1279
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:52,070
You don't like it?
No! No!

1280
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:54,280
It's\E2\80

1281
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:59,080
I mean, if it's an affair,
that's one thing.

1282
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:02,910
<i>But if it's-</i>

1283
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,750
i- if it's s-something else-

1284
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,550
Not that we have to know
right now. We don't.

1285
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:15,260
But if we think that it could
turn into something else, well-

1286
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:22,640
How do you feel
about all this?

1287
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:27,100
How do I feel about what?

1288
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:32,650
How do you-
How do you f-feel about me?

1289
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:52,880
What is that supposed to mean?

1290
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,390
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Mr. Baskin
is still in conference.

1291
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,440
Yeah? Well, tell him
I called again.

1292
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:13,230
Kopecki. K-O-P-

1293
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,740
E- K-E.
Yes, I can spell, young man.

1294
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,950
Yeah, right. Well,
tell him it's important.

1295
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:19,910
Good-bye.

1296
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:22,200
Each page would be
made out of six panels.

1297
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:27,040
There will be 30 pages per electronic
comic book, with a choice every two pages-

1298
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,420
No, choice
every three pages.

1299
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:33,460
But ours will also be in color.
Did I say that? Yes, Mr. Baskin.

1300
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,720
Ours- Did I say- I didn't say that
right. Yes. Well, whatever. Anyway-

1301
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,390
Do you have the list of
story line options? Maybe.

1302
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:46,310
Can I see them?

1303
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,270
Maybe.

1304
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:50,310
What was that? That sound. What? What?

1305
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,480
That. What are you doing?

1306
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:55,570
What is it?
Let me see your hand.

1307
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:57,570
Did you make this?
No, Petey made it. Here.

1308
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,700
What does it do? Put your hand right
there. Just put your hand right there.

1309
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:02,700
Put your hand. Okay. Watch.

1310
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,780
Put your hand on it.
What does it do?

1311
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:08,910
That's incredible.

1312
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,170
That's great.

1313
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,840
I don't get how it works. Well, you
need another person for it to work.

1314
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,430
Although maybe it will work
with a dog. I don't know.

1315
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:25,060
All right.
Let's get back to work.

1316
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:27,520
Do you want some coffee?
Sure?

1317
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,520
Uh-huh.

1318
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,990
Susan.
Oh, hi.

1319
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:50,160
You working late again?
Yeah. Well, we were just\E2\80

1320
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:53,170
I get
- got some coffee. You know, you're looking good these days.

1321
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:55,460
No.
Oh, yeah. You are.

1322
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:58,130
Oh.
I'm happy for you.

1323
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:01,970
Oh. Happy for both of you. I really am.

1324
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:07,140
<i>Night.
Night, darlin'.</i>

1325
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:22,900
<i>It's your house?
The deed's in my name.</i>

1326
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:27,080
<i>I don't care who you raised.
Did you raise gerbils and dogs?</i>

1327
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,490
<i>My tone is plenty civil.</i>

1328
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:32,460
<i>My tone is plenty civil. Who's
putting the food on your plate?</i>

1329
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:34,920
<i>It's my house.
It's my house. I keep the house.</i>

1330
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,500
<i>You keep sayin' that,
but the deed's in my name.</i>

1331
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:43,590
Well, Jenny was saying that
there was a problem-

1332
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,720
Hi.

1333
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:51,270
Well, Wednesday would be
better than Thursday.

1334
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:54,850
<i>Mr. Baskin can't be
- I have a key example right here.</i>

1335
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:58,400
<i>Where you been? I've been
trying to reach you forever.</i>

1336
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,730
I'm in the middle of something,
okay? That's the list.

1337
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:03,900
All you gotta do is call.
Can you give me a minute?

1338
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:06,740
- Yes.
- What are you talking about? This is it. This is the list.

1339
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:11,370
- Would you come back at lunch?
I'm busy right now- Hello? - Busy?

1340
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:14,040
- Billy!
- Are you outta your mind?

1341
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,290
Jesus, Billy. Miss Patterson, get
them on the phone and apologize for me?

1342
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,330
This is what we've been
waiting for.

1343
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:22,380
I got work to do. Can't you understand
that? I got a deadline to meet. God!

1344
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:27,510
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- Hey!

1345
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,010
Hey, you're Josh Baskin! Remember?
You broke your arm on my roof!

1346
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:34,310
You hid in my basement when Robert
Tyson was about to rip your head off!

1347
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:37,310
You don't get it, do you?
This is important!

1348
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:44,900
I'm your best friend. What's
more important than that, huh?

1349
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:51,240
And I'm three months older
than you are, asshole.

1350
01:42:57,580 --> 01:43:01,040
Stupid stuff.

1351
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:04,090
Some friend.
I don't need him.

1352
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,800
Stupid jacket.

1353
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:17,770
<i>Josh?</i>

1354
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,900
Josh!

1355
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:28,990
Oh. Hi, Mrs. Baskin.

1356
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:42,340
<i>Hi ya.</i>

1357
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:45,170
I was just looking
around in here.

1358
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,590
Hmm.

1359
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:50,930
- Your hair's getting longer.
- I got it cut yesterday.

1360
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:53,140
Oh.

1361
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:58,430
He had a birthday.

1362
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,980
Yeah, I- I know.

1363
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:07,150
I got him this anyway.

1364
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,590
Pete Rose.
Yeah.

1365
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:26,210
They have these special shops
where they do that.

1366
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:31,180
<i>You know, if you want,
you can keep it until- until he-</i>

1367
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:34,970
He'll be coming back real soon.

1368
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:46,230
Everything's gonna be okay.

1369
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:43,460
<i>"You are standing in the cavern
of the evil wizard.</i>

1370
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:47,540
<i>All around you are the carcasses
of slain ice dwarfs. "</i>

1371
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:55,640
Melt wizard.

1372
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,350
<i>"What do you want
to melt him with?"</i>

1373
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,940
<i>Throw thermal pod.</i>

1374
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:17,740
<i>Race you to the corner!
No!</i>

1375
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:19,870
Why not?

1376
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:22,410
You always win.
I'll let you win.

1377
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,940
Spreading leaves!

1378
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:50,860
<i>Greg! Time for dinner!</i>

1379
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:53,280
<i>Wait! Just five more minutes!</i>

1380
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,900
Mrs. Kaplan, in just
a little bit to your right.

1381
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:00,070
Your right. Your right.

1382
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:04,370
Mrs. Kaplan knows her right
and her left. Isn't that great?

1383
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:07,920
Let's have some smiles.
This is a joyous occasion.

1384
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,130
<i>No, no, no, just\E2\80</i>

1385
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:19,590
Where are we going? Where
do you guys wanna go?

1386
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:27,100
<i>Thanks, mister!</i>

1387
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,310
Got it. I got it. Got it.

1388
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,570
Hit a couple more!
All right.

1389
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:05,640
Where you been?
It's kind of late.

1390
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:08,940
Oh, I was- was out.

1391
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,480
Out where?

1392
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:14,690
Just... took a walk.

1393
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:22,070
Josh, what's wrong?

1394
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,210
What is it?

1395
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:38,050
I haven't told you something because I
didn't think that you were gonna believe me.

1396
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:42,010
And even if you did believe me, I didn't
think that you were gonna like me anymore, so-

1397
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:44,760
Oh, honey, come here.
You can tell me anything.

1398
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:47,350
What?

1399
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:56,400
Susan, I'm not
what you think I am.

1400
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,280
Uh, what do you mean?

1401
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:04,990
Before I met you,
I was in Little League.

1402
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,700
<i>Um, I was in Little League,
and I rode my bike to school,</i>

1403
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:12,330
and I played with my friends
and hung out with them and-

1404
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:16,290
Josh, what are you\E2\80
What are you talking about?

1405
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,920
I want to go home.

1406
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:24,430
I miss my family, Susan,
and I want to go home.

1407
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:27,260
- Oh, my God. You're married.
- No.

1408
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:32,810
This was too good to be true. There had
to be something. Susan, I'm not married.

1409
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,190
<i>You're not?
No.</i>

1410
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:40,360
- I'm a child.
- What?

1411
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:43,530
I'm a child, Susan,

1412
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:48,200
<i>and I'm- I'm not ready
for all of this.</i>

1413
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:52,080
Oh, that's fine.
That is- That's just great.

1414
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:55,880
You see, what happened
- No, I understand. "I'm not ready to make a commitment.

1415
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,050
<i>I'm not ready to accept the
responsibility. " No, you don't understand.</i>

1416
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:02,050
- I'm 13 years old.
- Oh, and who isn't?

1417
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:05,680
You think that there isn't
a frightened kid inside of me too?

1418
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,640
No, I mean I really am 13.

1419
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:13,140
I went to bed one night and I was a kid,
woke up the next morning, I was a grown-up.

1420
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:18,360
Oh, right. And just yesterday I was a schoolgirl
with pigtails. Why are you doing this, Josh?

1421
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,400
- There was this carnival in New Jersey.
- Please.

1422
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:24,820
I made a wish on a machine called
the Zoltar machine. Oh, stop it.

1423
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:28,450
It was a Zoltar machine. It had this
bobbing head, and it looked like a devil.

1424
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:32,120
If you got a quarter in the devil's
mouth, you could make a wish, and I did.

1425
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,330
So I made a wish to be big.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1426
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,960
I changed into a grown-up,
when I'm really just a kid.

1427
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,750
Fine, Josh, you're a kid.

1428
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:47,130
Look, I really don't know what it is
that you're trying to tell me,

1429
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:50,640
but we have a very big presentation
to give tomorrow,

1430
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:53,560
so I'm gonna get some sleep.

1431
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:23,770
Hello?

1432
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:26,650
Yeah, do you have
a Zoltar machine?

1433
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:30,200
Nope. Never heard of it.
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

1434
01:52:41,330 --> 01:52:43,790
Wait. I need a paper.

1435
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,840
Would you get me
some gum?

1436
01:52:55,810 --> 01:52:57,520
Thank you.

1437
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:23,710
These are the notes, in
case you want 'em. Thank you.

1438
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,720
Well, should get the cards set up
before everyone comes in.

1439
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:38,390
Okay.

1440
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:50,820
Hello?

1441
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:53,320
Yeah, do you have a Zoltar
machine? Got one right here.

1442
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:55,360
You do?
Yeah.

1443
01:53:55,450 --> 01:53:58,450
Yeah! Yeah, thanks.
That's great!

1444
01:53:59,490 --> 01:54:01,450
Yeah!

1445
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:11,210
<i>MacMillan Toys. I'll transfer.</i>

1446
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:34,240
Right there.
Sea Point Park, New York.

1447
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,700
Well?

1448
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:44,620
Yes?

1449
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:47,250
They're waiting for you,
Mr. Baskin.

1450
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:58,970
- Thanks.
- See you around.

1451
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:12,020
There's this flat screen on the
inside with, uh, with pictures on it,

1452
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:15,780
and you read it, and you have to make a
choice of what the character's gonna do.

1453
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:21,160
<i>If he's gonna fight the dragon,
you push one of the buttons- Uh-</i>

1454
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:27,410
- Paul?
- I don't get it.

1455
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:29,420
<i>Well-
Paul, stop it.</i>

1456
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,500
<i>It's a comic book that-</i>

1457
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:34,920
See, there's a computer chip inside
which stores the choices.

1458
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:38,840
So, when you reach the end of the
page, you decide where the story goes.

1459
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:41,180
<i>That's the point.
Terrific, Susan.</i>

1460
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:44,270
<i>The kid makes his
own decision.</i>

1461
01:55:44,350 --> 01:55:46,890
<i>This is really possible?
- Yeah.</i>

1462
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:50,350
In fact, it's a very simple program.
Isn't that right?

1463
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:56,320
<i>So what happens when
you run out of choices?</i>

1464
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,820
<i>That's the great thing. You can
just sell different adventures.</i>

1465
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:03,530
<i>Just pop in a brand-new disk,
and you get a whole new set of options.</i>

1466
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:07,370
<i>- We could market this on
a comic book rack. - Mm-hmm.</i>

1467
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:11,710
<i>I'll be right back. How
much would the unit cost?</i>

1468
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:16,800
<i>Our initial figure is around seven-</i>

1469
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:21,340
<i>Around seven dollars,</i>

1470
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:27,270
with a retail cost
of about $ 18.95.

1471
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:32,520
<i>You expect a kid to pay
$19 for a comic book?</i>

1472
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:34,980
I think a kid-

1473
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,870
Will you excuse me?

1474
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:46,830
<i>- What's going on?
Let 'em be.</i>

1475
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:53,460
Josh?

1476
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:56,300
Josh?
Oh.

1477
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:12,310
More. Will you take me to
Sea Point Park, New York?

1478
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:15,400
Get in.
Sea Point Park? Josh!

1479
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,480
Hey! Not so fast!
Sorry. Here.

1480
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:20,150
Josh! Josh!

1481
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,490
<i>See you back home!</i>

1482
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:26,160
Yeah!

1483
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:30,410
Excuse me. Do you know him?
You know Josh? Yeah. Yeah.

1484
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:33,870
Look, you have to tell me
where he went. Who are you?

1485
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,670
I'm- I'm his girlfriend.

1486
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:41,800
Ew.

1487
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:45,890
Billy Kopecki. You have to tell
me where he went. Where did he go?

1488
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:48,760
Please tell me.

1489
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:50,930
Tell me!

1490
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:14,370
It's tough to find a
cab out here. Thanks.

1491
01:59:47,550 --> 01:59:49,680
Work, damn it!

1492
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:05,730
I wish I was a kid again.

1493
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,300
Josh?
Susan.

1494
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:29,260
You know, you don't
walk out on somebody.

1495
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:32,850
You don't just get up and leave
and- and- and walk out like that.

1496
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:36,930
You don't do that. I know.
I know. I'm really sorry.

1497
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:40,310
I'm really sorry, but I
didn't know what to do.

1498
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,190
I didn't know
what to say.

1499
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:05,170
Oh, God.

1500
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:08,170
You got your wish.

1501
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:11,010
I tried to tell you.
I didn't listen.

1502
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:15,220
I guess I didn't hear you, or
- or want to, or\E2\80 I tried to tell you last night.

1503
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:18,970
How would I have
- Even if I did listen, how would I know? I've been thinking about this.

1504
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:21,140
Why would I know that?
I've been trying\E2\80

1505
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:24,150
I've been thinking about it, and there's
a million reasons for me to go home,

1506
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:27,480
but there's only one reason
for me to stay.

1507
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:31,570
What- What reason is that?

1508
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:36,530
Well, you.

1509
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:40,700
Oh, come on. Come on.

1510
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:43,960
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1511
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:51,880
So, uh, what\E2\80
what are you, 15, 16?

1512
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:57,430
I'm- I'm 13.

1513
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,640
Mm-hmm.

1514
02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:05,810
Well, that explains it.

1515
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:20,160
Maybe you could come with me.

1516
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,500
No.

1517
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:29,290
No, I-
Why not?

1518
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:32,420
I've\E2\80 I've been there before.

1519
02:02:34,590 --> 02:02:38,550
<i>It's hard enough the first time.</i>

1520
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:41,890
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1521
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:46,270
<i>No, you don't know
what I mean.</i>

1522
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:56,820
Come on.
I'll drive you home.

1523
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:06,500
I'm sorry.
No, I'll be okay.

1524
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:08,580
You'll be fine.

1525
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:11,290
Ten years, who knows?

1526
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:15,300
Maybe you should
hold on to my number.

1527
02:03:34,150 --> 02:03:36,280
So this is where you live.

1528
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:41,780
Which one is it?
The one right there.

1529
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:44,790
<i>Oh. It's nice.</i>

1530
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:52,590
I'm gonna miss you.

1531
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:55,090
I'm gonna miss you too.

1532
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:03,430
You won't even remember me.
Oh, yes, I will.

1533
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,780
Bye.

1534
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,680
Ma?

1535
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:12,930
<i>Ma, it's me.
Josh?</i>

1536
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:16,060
<i>Josh?Josh!</i>

1537
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:19,610
<i>Oh, my God!
Oh, thank God you're home!</i>

1538
02:06:19,690 --> 02:06:23,150
<i>Oh, Ma, I missed you all so much.</i>

1539
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:35,710
I'm just not good enough.
What are you talking about?

1540
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:39,290
You've been hitting the ball over the
fence almost every time in stickball.

1541
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:41,420
You just gotta get used
to a fatter bat.

1542
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:46,260
You really think I could do it? Yeah.

1543
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:48,390
Come on. We'll hit
some after supper.

1544
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:50,560
Okay, I'll call for you.
