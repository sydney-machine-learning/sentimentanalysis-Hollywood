1
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,590
Look, it's Ganesh!
It's a sign from heaven.

2
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,863
<i>Good-bye, little chicks</i>
<i>we are leaving the sticks</i>

3
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,333
<i>We are catching the train</i>
<i>at a quarter to 6:00</i>

4
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,963
<i>So if anyone should drop around</i>

5
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,008
<i>Won't you please tell them</i>
<i>that we can be found</i>

6
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,705
<i>On the boardwalk in Atlantic City</i>

7
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,509
<i>We will walk in a dream</i>

8
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,177
<i>On the boardwalk in Atlantic City</i>

9
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,710
<i>Life will be peaches and cream</i>

10
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,020
<i>There where there's</i>
<i>saltwater air</i>

11
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,756
<i>Brings out the lady's charms</i>

12
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,799
<i>There on the rolling chair</i>

13
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,926
<i>He'll roll right into your arms</i>

14
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,242
Excuse me, ma'am.
You can't bring those bags in here.

15
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,380
- Oh, we're looking for Sally.
- It's a hotel policy.

16
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,981
She's a really great girl
who works here.

17
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,532
Oh, Christ!

18
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:49,137
Hi. Oh, wow,
it's really good to see you.

19
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,336
I don't want you here.
Get your asses out of here.

20
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,004
When do you finish?

21
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,878
You're not staying with me.

22
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,382
Look, Sally, we've got money.

23
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,718
Great. You're in a hotel.
Check in.

24
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,553
We will have money.

25
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,702
- Can you spell me for an hour?
- Yeah, sure.

26
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,037
- Who are they?
- My husband and my sister.

27
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,047
We drove across Utah.

28
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:14,525
You'd really love
those waterfalls there, Sally!

29
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,528
And then Colorado.

30
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:21,260
Did we ever meet some beautiful
Indians that live on a commune.

31
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,360
Did they have
some dynamite mushrooms!

32
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,928
Do you know
even the cows were wrecked?

33
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,668
Then we got lost
in Louisiana.

34
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,418
Lou, you're late again.
Peppy's very nervous.

35
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,515
Peppy knows he's got
an appointment.

36
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,390
I'm ringing this bell
like Charles Laughton...

37
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,555
in <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame:</i>

38
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,727
You want that from me? To become
a hunchback ringing for you?

39
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,735
You want hash and eggs?

40
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,136
I am nobody's hunchback.
You work for me, Lou!

41
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,937
The cigarettes you put
in your mouth, I pay for.

42
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,202
I ring this bell
and you get down here.

43
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,080
- You got no ketchup.
- Why the hell don't you get some?

44
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,081
- Don't come where I work!
- I came to see you!

45
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,622
I don't want you following me
or any more of your surprises.

46
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,715
What's going on in there?

47
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,420
Dave, leave her alone.
Don't rough her up.

48
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,986
If she doesn't want us,
we can go somewhere else.

49
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,259
It's okay, Chrissie.

50
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,494
Why don't you do
some deep breathing?

51
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,298
Yeah, okay.

52
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,964
He's really a wonderful man, Sally.

53
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,338
Why did you do it?
Running away with her...

54
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,540
humiliating me like that?

55
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,314
If you're gonna knock 'em up, pick
somebody who can care of herself.

56
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,287
What do you want me to say...
I'm sorry?

57
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,517
These things happen.

58
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,023
I want you out of here.

59
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,529
I need you.

60
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,396
I don't want you here.

61
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,561
What about Chrissie?
She needs you.

62
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,902
I'm not taking care
of either of you this time.

63
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,569
Are you seeing someone?

64
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,341
Yes, someone.

65
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,053
You screwed me up in Vegas
so I couldn't get a job.

66
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,198
This is what I've decided.

67
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,201
After I die, I'm gonna
have Peppy buried in my arms.

68
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,396
Do you think I trust you
to take care of him?

69
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,669
You're not gonna get one nickel
to take care of him after I'm gone.

70
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,540
Give me a kiss, Peppy.

71
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,636
Little ass kisser!

72
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,546
What are you saying?

73
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,845
I said we need more dog food.

74
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,548
- Did you cut the coupons?
- Yes, I cut the coupons.

75
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,716
Shoo! Come on now, Peppy.

76
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,485
There were 11 money-saver coupons
in the paper.

77
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,225
There's 11 money-saving coupons
in there now.

78
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,733
Here, you want to count them?

79
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,464
I can't even move my hands anymore.

80
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,541
- I'll rub your fingers for you.
- No, you stay away from me!

81
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,943
Last time you shoved my arthritis
clear up to my elbow.

82
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,082
Let me get going. It's late.

83
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,120
- I'll need five more dollars.
- Five more? You want cigarettes?

84
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,127
You steal cigarettes.

85
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,129
You're the big-time thief...

86
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,495
Mr. Mastermind...

87
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,091
Mr. Ten-Most-Wanted.

88
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,034
That's enough!

89
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,506
Nothing's enough.

90
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,017
Shit!

91
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,959
I always wanted shoes with...

92
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,728
clear plastic heels
you could see through with...

93
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,826
live goldfish swimming in them.

94
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,668
Wouldn't that be swift?

95
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,844
Have to walk so delicate.

96
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,373
You're like King Midas in reverse.
I don't want you touching my stuff.

97
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,310
You owe me.

98
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,914
Get out!

99
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,647
Who got you out
of fucking Saskatchewan?

100
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,089
If not for me, you'd be home making
jam, putting out for lumberjacks.

101
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,717
Get out!

102
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,092
You smell, you know that?

103
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,529
Like a can of rotten tuna fish.

104
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,698
I don't think you smell
of tuna fish.

105
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,300
Are you mad at me
for going off with Dave?

106
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:17,113
I think of this baby as being ours.
Dave and mine and yours.

107
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,725
Dave's got a much higher developed
soul than either you or me.

108
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,320
I've hardly been reincarnated
at all, but Dave...

109
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,991
he can remember all the way back
to ancient Egypt...

110
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,535
building the pyramids
and all of that.

111
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,094
He's had some really hard lives.

112
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,539
I think he's due for
a real big break in this one.

113
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,349
You can stay here tonight.

114
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,849
Thanks.

115
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,851
I am not gonna get upset!

116
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,237
Hi, Peppy.

117
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,245
- Grace says the usual.
- I know what to give Peppy.

118
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,837
Come on, baby.

119
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,316
- A dollar on 123.
- Right.

120
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:58,015
Going out of business, Lou. No sense
playing the numbers anymore.

121
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,217
Ida Cohen, with the six parakeets...

122
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,887
won $400 on eight quarters
at the casino.

123
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,555
Got anything for me?

124
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,873
- What have you got for me today?
- Got this 421.

125
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,573
4-2-1.

126
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,377
Six bits.

127
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,428
Lou! 496.

128
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,201
Fifty cents.
Make me a winner, man!

129
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,939
Sadie.

130
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,604
- 3-2-1.
- Wish me luck today, Lou.

131
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,977
I will.
Good number, 321.

132
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,396
Place your bets.

133
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,825
No more bets.

134
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,280
- You looked!
- You spilled your drink!

135
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,944
No, you took your eyes up.
You allowed me to distract you!

136
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,279
Everyone, listen to me.

137
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,725
The players are coming
to the casino in teams.

138
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,729
One sits here,
one sits there.

139
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,731
The cards are good.

140
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,097
The player at the first base
spills his drink.

141
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,635
Your eye moves.

142
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,899
The player at the third base
triples his bets.

143
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,308
They have a million clever ways
of trying to cheat you.

144
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,077
Focus!

145
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,117
Concentrate! Concentrate.

146
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,321
Go ahead.

147
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,827
Darling, you were late.

148
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,338
Family.

149
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,502
Did you like the music?

150
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,808
Marvelous music...
"Norma Casta Diva."

151
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,849
The chaste goddess
worshipping the moon.

152
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,110
Yeah, I'm beginning to like it.

153
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,314
Dignity, passion, size.

154
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,925
Can I lay a hard ten
on a soft three?

155
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,245
Yep.

156
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,906
Yeah, okay. Bye.

157
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,012
- Forty-eight dollars and six bits.
- You're down this week.

158
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,420
Everybody's broke.
I got any winners?

159
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,051
Better not have.
I can't afford fucking winners.

160
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,562
Freddy, how 'bout a double sawbuck
for the case? It's a real beauty.

161
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,073
How am I supposed to fit my Cuban
Monte Cristos in this piece of shit?

162
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,007
Where are you coming from?

163
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,617
- Do you know a Fred O'Reilly?
- Fred's right over there.

164
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,881
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

165
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,993
Hi, you Fred O'Reilly?

166
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,495
Yeah. Who are you?

167
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:03,399
Something new, huh?
Let me see. Very nice.

168
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,835
- I won $300 at the casino.
- Casino.

169
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,463
Hey, Queenie.

170
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,656
Hey, man, I need a little space
around here.

171
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,925
Come on!
I got business!

172
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,630
Let's take a look.

173
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,944
There you go.

174
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,054
Very nice.

175
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,694
Very nice indeed.

176
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,172
There's been a slight dry spell
around here.

177
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,335
Dry spell's over.
White Christmas, perfect timing.

178
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,403
A friend called this a.m.
Could I help him?

179
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,711
Had to say no.

180
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,547
- Where'd you get this?
- I found it in a phone booth.

181
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,077
- In Philadelphia?
- How did you know?

182
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,351
I'll help your friend.

183
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,191
Not looking like that, you won't.

184
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:45,131
This is a family town.
Better get yourself cleaned up.

185
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,297
A nice leisure suit, powder blue.

186
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:53,166
- You don't need a tie.
- Maybe you could advance me.

187
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,443
You know, $200? $300?
You know I'm good for it.

188
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,849
This is a very tight town.

189
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,650
I only do business with the people
I do business with.

190
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,055
The people I do business with
find out I do business...

191
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,094
with the people
I don't do business with...

192
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,564
I can't do business with you.

193
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,964
But Boomer in Vegas said...

194
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,197
I don't do business
with Boomer in Vegas.

195
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,573
You look like a fire sale.

196
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,905
Look...

197
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,638
I've been on the road six weeks.

198
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,011
You clean me up,
I'm a fuckin' Prince Charles.

199
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,580
You won't help me?
Look, I'm cutting you in!

200
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,095
I sure would like
to help my friend.

201
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,672
But remember,
I don't do business with you.

202
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,614
Shit!

203
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,420
You got a phone?

204
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,322
Telephone is upstairs.

205
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:19,126
Wait a minute. Let him use
the bar phone. I know the kid.

206
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,765
Find the place
you were looking for?

207
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,935
We live in the same building.

208
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,811
That's why I'm talking to you,
because we live in the same...

209
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,216
Yeah, Fred gave me your number.

210
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,289
Hey, Bob! Beer.

211
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,349
Cold one this time.

212
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,361
Okay, I'll be there.

213
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,599
- Your friend wants to do business.
- They'll bust you in the lobby.

214
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:06,542
You look like a training poster
from the narc squad.

215
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,044
Powder blue leisure suit.

216
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,446
Hey, Lou. I want you to run
an errand for me.

217
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,484
I'm booked up.

218
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,353
Who's the old guy?

219
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:21,017
You mean Lou? He used to run numbers
for the dinosaurs.

220
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,636
Hey, why did you leave?

221
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:36,231
Back there we started talking.
I had other things on my mind.

222
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,072
I was just trying to be friendly
so piss off!

223
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:45,672
Listen, I hear you're very big
in circles around here.

224
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,217
Where'd you hear that?

225
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,879
Vegas. Las Vegas.

226
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,225
You heard about me in Vegas?

227
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,558
Oh, yeah! The man to know!

228
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,893
Let me understand something, kid.

229
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,300
You're talking about
Las Vegas, Nevada?

230
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,099
Right, yeah.

231
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,572
That I was the man to know?

232
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,404
Lou, right?

233
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,111
Class dismissed.

234
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,557
Come on, Peppy.

235
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,057
Come on, you little mutt.

236
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,666
This ain't my dog.
Belongs to the lady downstairs.

237
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,398
I'm more of a German shepherd type
of guy. Isn't that right, Peppy?

238
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,497
Doin' the old lady a favor.

239
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,937
There's the building.

240
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,107
A shame you never saw it
in the old days, a real work of art.

241
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,117
They're gonna tear it down now
and build a casino.

242
00:25:56,321 --> 00:26:00,485
Lou, could I borrow your apartment?

243
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,992
My apartment?

244
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,325
Yeah, just for an hour. There's
a hundred bucks in it for you.

245
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,661
- A hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

246
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,666
Let me tell you something, kiddo.

247
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,532
My room ain't exactly
the royal suite of Mr. Casanova.

248
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,936
No, no, it's not for a girl.

249
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,201
It's technical, business.

250
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,470
Who was it told you about me
in Vegas?

251
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,949
Well, you know, it was in a crowd
of people, your name popped up.

252
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,746
Tall fella?

253
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,117
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

254
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,848
Harry Gropke.

255
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,691
Harry went to Vegas, I think.
It must have been Harry.

256
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,526
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Harry.

257
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,966
You know something?
I've known Harry for 30 years.

258
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,095
- I haven't seen him in 25.
- Yeah?

259
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:51,868
<i>I adore attractive,</i>
<i>well-groomed educated women:</i>

260
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,839
<i>You mean, making the church scene?</i>

261
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,815
<i>Forget it, Reverend:</i>
<i>I'm not resting!</i>

262
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,425
Here we are.

263
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,757
No strangers in here!

264
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,390
Dave's staying upstairs. He's from
Las Vegas. Friend of Harry Gropke's.

265
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,833
- I've got business to discuss.
- Not now, Grace. Later.

266
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:21,599
Where's Cookie's silver cigarette
case? It was here by my bed.

267
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,972
- I see you got a scale.
- Weight Watchers. Measures food.

268
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,635
Get it for me.

269
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:31,546
Lou, you get back here. You've got
to push the blood back in my feet.

270
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,550
I'll be right back.

271
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,912
Lou, come back!

272
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,660
Come in, come in.

273
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,942
Would you close the blinds?

274
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,585
I need a tablespoon.

275
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,257
That's great. Thanks.

276
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,498
Italian baby laxative.

277
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,833
That's what it is.

278
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,886
You like magic?

279
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,855
Pass your hand over the scale.

280
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,626
What?

281
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,031
Come on! Go on! Do it.

282
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,236
That's $2,000.

283
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,470
Two thousand dollars?

284
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,210
Okay, say abracadabra.

285
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,215
- Come on.
- Come on, say it!

286
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,911
Abracadabra.

287
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,189
That's $4,000.

288
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,341
Could you stash this
for me somewhere?

289
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,043
- Jeez, I don't know.
- It's only for a couple hours.

290
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,350
Look, you know the streets here.
Could you walk me?

291
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,621
I can't leave Grace.

292
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,061
Are you afraid?

293
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,156
I've got a medical problem with her.

294
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,463
- Are you a doctor?
- Doctor?

295
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:08,996
There's something wrong with
the feet. The blood don't flow good.

296
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,735
Why don't you tell me?
Come on.

297
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,974
- Wait a minute.
- Chrissie, I got a job for ya!

298
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,675
Got your fingers warmed up?

299
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,689
This is not Grand Central Station.
What's wrong with you today?

300
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:29,386
These people are going to help you.
Come on, Peppy, you're in the way.

301
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,087
You're fired, Lou.

302
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,630
Dave, this lady's got a
million things wrong with her.

303
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,859
Get her out of here.

304
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:40,769
This lady is almost a qualified
therapist in Nevada and Oklahoma.

305
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,969
She trained in Saskatchewan, Canada,
in the art of Korean foot massage.

306
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:48,308
If you leave me alone with her,
I'm gonna kill you, Lou.

307
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,645
Will you listen for just once?
This is not medicine.

308
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:56,448
I'm still a very important woman
in this town.

309
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,490
I'm Cookie Pinza's widow.

310
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,291
He used to deliver coffee
for Cookie.

311
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,266
He's my servant.

312
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:13,430
Do you know that your whole body
ends at the bottom of your feet?

313
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,439
You think I am just poking
your feet.

314
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:21,501
Well, when I touch this spot,
this is where your spine is.

315
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:25,845
When I touch this spot,
this is where your tummy is.

316
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,817
You work for that Grace?

317
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,479
I help her out.

318
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,682
She pays you?

319
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:37,592
You're her fancy man?
Are you servicing her?

320
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,391
Every now and then.

321
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,592
Wow. To be your age
and still working at it.

322
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,659
Mr. Stud! Mr. John!

323
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,400
Well, I keep myself in trim.

324
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,568
Monte Carlo!

325
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:56,978
The old casino is very, very slow
and old-fashioned.

326
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,949
Rococo elegance. But the new casino
is just like Vegas.

327
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,212
Really?

328
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:05,985
The croupiers are French, but the
dealers are American from Vegas.

329
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:12,488
You get your license to learn how to
deal and the world opens up to you.

330
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:20,130
It's not just cards, you know.
It's your future.

331
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,339
I want you to concentrate.

332
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,537
I hate you going back
to that oyster bar.

333
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,876
The world should be your oyster.

334
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,879
Well, I've got so much to learn.
I don't know how to count in French.

335
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,045
I know...

336
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,458
Do you think you could teach me?

337
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,553
Better than that.

338
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,430
If you'd only stop being afraid.

339
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,098
Deal with courage.

340
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,371
You're a little pearl
produced by that oyster bar.

341
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,413
Say that in French.

342
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,632
The name Capone
mean anything to you?

343
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,173
Al Capone? The Godfather?

344
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,142
Lucky Luciano, Dutch Schultz,
Meyer Lansky.

345
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,145
Do you know them?

346
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,875
You work for the people
who work for the people.

347
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,474
I was taken a shine to.

348
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:44,180
Pardon me, but you don't exactly
look like the "King of the Mobs."

349
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:50,022
Well, a few wrong turns,
wrong affections, some mistakes.

350
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,926
It's all shit now.

351
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,399
It's a shame you never saw
Atlantic City when it had floy floy.

352
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,596
Remember the song, "Flatfoot Floogie
with the Floy Floy"?

353
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,765
Hep cat and zoot suit.
That was the floogie part.

354
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,832
The floy floy.

355
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,140
That was something special.

356
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,579
Atlantic City had floy floy coming
out of its ears in those days.

357
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,282
Now it's all so goddamn legal.

358
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,719
Howard Johnson running a casino.

359
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,986
Tutti-frutti ice cream
and craps don't mix.

360
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,393
The only difference between
Christianity and Hare Krishna is...

361
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,397
Hare Krishna is real.

362
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:31,162
If Jesus was alive today,
he'd be very much into Hare Krishna.

363
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,032
- Chrissie!
- Yeah?

364
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,334
Do my sinuses again.

365
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,378
- What language is that?
- French.

366
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,109
Is it hard, French?

367
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,981
It's the language of
international diplomacy.

368
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,660
It's nice, French.

369
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,695
Your husband's a real cutie!

370
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,697
He's leaving tomorrow.

371
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,071
Have you seen my wallet?

372
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,407
I can't find my wallet.

373
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,088
We go this way.

374
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,124
Yes, it used to be beautiful...

375
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:32,959
what with the rackets,
the whoring, guns.

376
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,021
Sometimes...

377
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,330
Sometimes things would happen,
I'd have to kill a few people.

378
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:42,498
I'd feel bad for a while, but I'd
jump into the ocean, swim way out.

379
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:46,134
Come back in feeling nice and clean,
start all over again.

380
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,144
I never seen the Atlantic Ocean
till just now.

381
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,682
The Atlantic Ocean
was something then.

382
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,451
Yeah, you should've seen
the Atlantic Ocean in those days.

383
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,050
Come on.

384
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,559
There's your hotel.

385
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,863
I could like it here.
You can breathe.

386
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,167
They used to call Atlantic City
the lungs of Philadelphia.

387
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,501
We stay long enough, we could be
the nose of Philadelphia.

388
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,679
- What room?
- 307.

389
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,818
Look, you go up alone.

390
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,656
What do you mean?

391
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,162
Just hand him this.
I'll wait outside.

392
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,994
Ain't you comin' with me?

393
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,695
I can't. Not the way I'm dressed.
I mean, you look sharp.

394
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,704
You ain't trying to set me up.

395
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:51,299
I'm trusting you.
I left a fortune in your apartment.

396
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,311
Look, you just give him
the package.

397
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,213
You wait for an envelope with the
money. There's another 100 for ya.

398
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,808
Can't you do it?

399
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,822
You better get yourself
some new clothes.

400
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,262
Tomorrow. Floy floy.

401
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,429
- 307?
- Right.

402
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,560
I'll be up on the boardwalk.

403
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,159
I got a...

404
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,036
I've got a package from Dave.

405
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,980
What, is medicare dealing now?
Come on in.

406
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,994
Everybody in?

407
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,922
Pair of fives.

408
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,939
Fella here wants to talk to you.

409
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,034
Hey, man, what's going on?

410
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,687
We'd like you to keep it going
if you don't mind.

411
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,790
There's a lot of other people
we gotta see first.

412
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,591
The whole East Coast
is like the Sahara Desert.

413
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,996
Every source is dried up.
You old "kocker" you.

414
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,432
Tell me.
Where'd you get this stuff?

415
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,992
Medicare.

416
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,234
All right. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you.

417
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,903
I'm trying to hold a game together.
I'm calling everywhere.

418
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,673
Four G's.

419
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,882
I know. Four G's.

420
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,145
Tomorrow, huh?

421
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,585
Lou Paschall?

422
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,125
Buddy. Buddy O'Brien!

423
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,357
That's me!
You're lookin' great, Lou.

424
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,023
How you doin'?

425
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,567
Fine. I'm doin' perfect.

426
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,833
It's good to see you, Buddy.
Oh, here. There we are.

427
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,501
Hey, hey, not from you, I don't.

428
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:56,239
Go on, take it.
It's a good time for me.

429
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,140
Get in the chair.
I'll give you a shine.

430
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,265
- It's a long time.
- Yeah.

431
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,131
Remember the day
Nucky Johnson sent us...

432
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,003
to buy 100 boxes of rubbers
for the party?

433
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,877
The look the guy gave us!

434
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,846
A hundred boxes of rubbers
for two guys.

435
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,940
He couldn't get over it.

436
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,013
Buddy, you live too much
in the past.

437
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,488
Yeah. But them were the days.

438
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,735
Mrs. Matthews?

439
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,236
Yes.

440
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:31,066
Great! Where did you find it?

441
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,376
<i>I have a vision of the future:</i>

442
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,350
This glorious island
of Atlantic City...

443
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:45,286
shining like a beacon whose light
was nearly extinguished.

444
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,383
If it wasn't for the casinos,
we'd have been dead a long time ago.

445
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,055
And so I accept with great pleasure
this check from all the casinos.

446
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,294
- Thank you, Mr. Goulet.
- You're welcome, Doctor.

447
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,598
I want to thank the people
whose money I had for a while.

448
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,298
Last night I was lucky at the tables
but on the way home...

449
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:07,140
on the boardwalk,
I was mugged by my own croupier!

450
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:30,031
<i>Just flew into town tonight</i>

451
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,501
<i>Lady Luck was on our flight</i>

452
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,504
<i>Had a bite to eat</i>

453
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,802
<i>At Geno's down the street</i>

454
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,675
<i>And now this welcome sight</i>

455
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,306
<i>Glad to see you're born again</i>

456
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:49,079
<i>Atlantic City, my old friend</i>

457
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,087
<i>Be there when I bet on ten</i>

458
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,290
You're not planning
on leaving town, are you?

459
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,726
I want to make it here. I really
like this town. I wanna be a dealer.

460
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,321
I think Atlantic City's
the greatest.

461
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,559
- Mrs. Matthews, you...
- What?

462
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,568
You can claim the body tomorrow.

463
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,366
I don't want the body!

464
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:13,204
<i>And now you're here to stay</i>

465
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:16,804
<i>Remember how they put you down</i>

466
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,976
<i>There's not an empty room in town</i>

467
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,020
<i>They're coming here</i>
<i>from miles around</i>

468
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,386
<i>You sure came through</i>

469
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:33,419
<i>I'm glad to see you're born again</i>

470
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,692
Saskatchewan. Area code 306...

471
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:45,238
- To Mr. Or Mrs. Peter Matthews.
- <i>You're back upon the map again</i>

472
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,072
Sally Matthews.

473
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,204
<i>You sure came through</i>

474
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,272
What do you mean they won't accept
the charges? It's about their son.

475
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,080
Hello? Dave's dead. Hello!

476
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,629
- I heard about Dave. I'm sorry.
- Who are...

477
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,097
We live in the same building.
Next door.

478
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,569
Come on, I'll walk you home.

479
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,541
I don't know what to do about his
body. I tried calling his parents.

480
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,544
They wouldn't even accept
the charges.

481
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,343
- They've got to know.
- I don't have any money.

482
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,444
Don't worry about it.
Come on.

483
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,463
I can't. I, I...

484
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,131
Hello? Mr. Matthews?

485
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,508
I was a friend of your son Dave.

486
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,980
My name... My name is Lou.

487
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:03,748
I'm sorry to have to tell you.
There's been a very bad accident.

488
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,351
Can I take your order?

489
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,793
Just some water, please.

490
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,206
The news didn't exactly break their
hearts, but at least they know.

491
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:34,381
I've been thinking about
the burial and disposal.

492
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,012
You're gonna need help.

493
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,989
I hate to bring this up, but...

494
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,322
when something like this happens...

495
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,418
there's certain things
you've got to do.

496
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:47,429
And you're new in this town.

497
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,256
Christ!

498
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,703
Remember, I'm Lou Paschall
if there's anything you need.

499
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,506
I know your name from the mailbox.
I got a piece of your mail once.

500
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,639
- I slipped it under your door.
- Oh, was that you?

501
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,117
It was just junk mail,
but I appreciate what you did.

502
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,019
Coupons for paper towels.
You saved me money.

503
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:17,217
- I'm Sally Matthews.
- I know.

504
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,024
Thanks very much
for everything, really.

505
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,758
It's okay.

506
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,695
God, I don't know
what to say to my sister.

507
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:36,506
Look, your sister is downstairs
baby-sitting Grace... Mrs. Pinza.

508
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,481
Why don't you go to bed, get
some rest, tell her in the morning?

509
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,574
Young girls are strong.

510
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,483
Yeah.

511
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,817
Good night.

512
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,379
Good night.

513
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,699
Jesus.

514
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,093
You can go upstairs now.

515
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,465
All right, all right.

516
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,895
Your sister is back.

517
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,192
What's got into you?

518
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,031
Shit!

519
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,332
- Where are my oysters?
- Relax.

520
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,464
Well, at least you got
your wallet back.

521
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,034
Last night I dreamt I came here
and Dave's body was on the ice.

522
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,575
- Sign this.
- What is it?

523
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,710
It's for your husband.
Sign here and here.

524
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,516
- But what...
- Believe me, it's all right.

525
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:56,548
And put down the address,
the family address in Canada.

526
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,595
- What did you do to your hand?
- Nothing.

527
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,958
- What time do you get off?
- 12:00.

528
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,368
Terrific. I'll see you.

529
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,438
Holy shit!

530
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,565
Santa Claus is looking real hot.
Come on in.

531
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:49,840
Everybody, hold it. Let's have
a little applause for Santa Claus.

532
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:52,981
Gentlemen.

533
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:57,341
Go ahead.
Compliments of the house.

534
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:02,357
Hey, Pops, what planet
do you come from?

535
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:07,124
I want to do something for ya.
Here, take my watch. Go ahead.

536
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,761
You don't want it? Take my wife!
Take my life! Take anything!

537
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,702
Just cut out the bullshit,
let me have the money.

538
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,443
You're all right, Pops.

539
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,219
Not bad. Not bad.

540
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:39,355
Couple of inches off the sleeves,
a little off the skirt...

541
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,397
and you'll look just fine.

542
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:43,932
For the tailor.

543
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,993
Double sawbuck?
Hey, thanks a lot!

544
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,131
Listen, when things start going good
for me, I'll make it up to you.

545
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,274
A dozen oysters, please.

546
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,944
- Hi.
- I took care of Dave.

547
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,386
The forms you signed, they were
releases to send the body to Canada.

548
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:11,086
You were busy, and the arrangements,
mail, the plane, it's a lot of work.

549
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:14,062
You paid to have his body
flown to Canada?

550
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,893
I hope you don't mind.

551
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:20,629
- The money! Must've been expensive.
- Forget the money. I'm a neighbor.

552
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,106
Why are you doing all this?

553
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,234
It's nothing!
Sinatra gives wings to hospitals.

554
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,710
We all do what we can.

555
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,339
- It's 12:00.
- Yeah?

556
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,406
I'll wait for you.

557
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,183
There's four extra in there.

558
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:44,454
They're really strict here. They
count the shells. I'm not kidding.

559
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:47,655
I don't really want these, honey.
We're going to lunch.

560
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,630
Hey, thanks!

561
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,936
New casino.

562
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:05,276
Burger King casinos. McDonald's
casinos. Pizzeria casinos. Jesus!

563
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,010
Where I work they rake in
over a million bucks a day.

564
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,075
- Really?
- Yeah.

565
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,523
You like the casinos?
You go to them?

566
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,221
No. No, I don't like them.

567
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:22,321
They're too wholesome for me.

568
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:26,528
I mean nuns, for Christ sake,
standing in line. Boy Scout troops.

569
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:29,936
People blowing their...
their welfare checks.

570
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,736
It's too much nickel-and-diming.

571
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,438
All that money you carry around,
that's no nickel-and-diming.

572
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,572
It quiets the nerves.

573
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:44,320
Why do you live in the same dump
I do when you could afford a palace?

574
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,820
Well, I...

575
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:50,050
To tell you the truth,
I stay there for Grace.

576
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:54,756
When they tear it down, I'll take
Grace someplace and head to Miami.

577
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,264
You like Miami?

578
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,926
I'm thinking of going to Monaco.

579
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:00,594
Oh, Monaco!

580
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,434
That's the place with that Kelly
girl from Philadelphia. She's queen.

581
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:07,670
Yeah, they have a casino there,
very elegant.

582
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,110
No women dealers yet,
but I'm hoping.

583
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:14,582
Only now I'm learning about music
and I'm gonna start reading books.

584
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:19,281
Developing some style. Learning new
languages because I want to travel.

585
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,290
You thinking of leaving
Atlantic City?

586
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,792
Not for a couple of years.
I've got to develop my blackjack.

587
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:28,160
I'm gonna deal my way to Europe,
to Monte Carlo.

588
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:31,358
A regular Princess Grace!

589
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,244
- Catch of the day?
- No fish!

590
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:47,943
No clams, no mussels, no oysters,
no shrimp! I want meat!

591
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,951
Lamb chops and pork chops
and liver.

592
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:53,147
Bring us a menu.
And, waiter...

593
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,814
more wine... the same.

594
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,418
I don't want anything that swims.

595
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:02,623
- Cigarette?
- Yeah. Oh, no. They're too strong.

596
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,690
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

597
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,762
It's nice to have money
to have things.

598
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:17,009
This belonged to Grace's husband,
Cookie Pinza, a personal friend.

599
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,844
Puligny-Montrachet 1966.

600
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,982
Smell.

601
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,816
Okay?

602
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,446
I'll do it.

603
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,159
Teach me stuff.

604
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,831
Like what?

605
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,834
What you know.

606
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:42,462
- You want information or wisdom?
- Both.

607
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,638
I'll think about it.

608
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:51,078
The smartest man in the world was
on a quiz show winning everything.

609
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,513
You know how they finally
tripped him up?

610
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:57,781
He knew everything under the sun
except his Social Security number.

611
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,822
He could have had the world.

612
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,413
What's yours?

613
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,461
I don't have
a Social Security number.

614
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,860
Everybody's got
a Social Security number.

615
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,023
You pay income tax?

616
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,094
You still got your fingerprints?

617
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:18,800
- Well, sure.
- Let me see. Oh, my God!

618
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,070
- You don't have any fingerprints!
- What are you talking about?

619
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,738
I got fingerprints.
I got lines...

620
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,950
You wanna go back to Saskatchewan?

621
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,821
I mean for the funeral.

622
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:39,862
Look, I haven't been back there
for ten years.

623
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:43,558
I'll stake you to a round-trip.
You can come right back.

624
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,066
Thank you.

625
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,872
Then you should send a tribute.
Make a nice impression.

626
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,806
Let me tell you, never let them
badmouth you at a funeral.

627
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:58,639
Miss, I want these roses,
all of them.

628
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,148
- All of them?
- Yes.

629
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:04,175
Make a nice big wreath, hmm?
A card?

630
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:06,915
- Just over there.
- Thank you.

631
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,854
How many are there?

632
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,587
Six dozen.
Would you like them sent?

633
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:14,824
Yeah.
To Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

634
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,127
"Moose Jaw"?

635
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,794
It's near Medicine Hat.

636
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,340
"Business prevents my being with
you on this sad occasion. Sally."

637
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,844
Okay?

638
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:34,013
And miss, send flowers...
nice ones...

639
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,143
"To Dave from Lou and the boys
in Atlantic City."

640
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,881
- You got that?
- Yes.

641
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:40,547
Keep the change.

642
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,091
- Thank you.
- Shall we go?

643
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,026
This is going to be the biggest
social event in Moose Jaw in years.

644
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:51,465
I've got to go.

645
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,900
- I hope I didn't...
- No, no, no.

646
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,030
I've got friends waiting.
I should have told you.

647
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:01,440
We're fixing up this house
I'm moving to... a new place.

648
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,871
Can I see you later?

649
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,416
I've got a class.

650
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,418
Well, it was a nice lunch.

651
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,351
Yeah. Thank you.

652
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,252
- Thanks.
- See you.

653
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,336
Why did they have to kill him?

654
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,346
Let's get away from here.

655
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,949
- Dave was a nice boy.
- He was a shit!

656
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,149
But you married him.

657
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,250
Look, you would marry anybody too
to get out of Saskatchewan.

658
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,493
Don't be mad at me.

659
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,900
I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you.

660
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,736
It's just...

661
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,503
I'm late and everything.

662
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,011
You want to go to your friends?
Come on, I'll take you.

663
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,316
Okay, stop right here.
This is the place.

664
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,753
See that kid on the roof?
He's in my class.

665
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,920
Come on in.

666
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,696
- Hi, Sally.
- I know I'm late.

667
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:33,458
Bernie?
I'm sorry I'm late, really.

668
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,505
I know I'm over two hours late.
Forgive me, okay?

669
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:40,440
Lou, Bernie. Bernie, Lou.

670
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:43,535
Come see my room.
It's great.

671
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,216
This Bernie...
you living with him?

672
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,947
There's ten of us living here.
We're all dealers, would-be dealers.

673
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:56,219
- Bernie's baccarat.
- Fancy game with the shoe, huh?

674
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,920
- Very elegant, Bernie.
- I'm elegant too.

675
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,155
Oh, that's Agnes.
She's roulette.

676
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,810
You learn never to split a ten.
A ten is dynamite with a two card...

677
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:19,041
but after that
it can be your tragic flaw.

678
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,606
But it's not just
dealing the cards.

679
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:26,178
You have to know how to surrender
and how to wash the deck...

680
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:30,988
when to burn it, how to pluck chips,
share the box, stuff like that.

681
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,756
- When do you take your test?
- Three weeks.

682
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,923
- I'll be making $20,000 a year.
- No kidding.

683
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,433
Yeah. 30,000 with tips
if I'm really good.

684
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,437
Hey. I'm gonna hang on to you.

685
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:44,972
Be a gigolo.

686
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,943
What about Grace?

687
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,672
She came down here during the war...
beauty contest.

688
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,716
Oh, for Miss America?

689
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:59,812
Nothing like that.
More like Miss Pinball Machine.

690
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:03,347
She came, she needed protection.
I protected her.

691
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,587
She was this teenager.

692
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,061
You protected her for 40 years?

693
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,121
Well, she got married
along the way...

694
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,793
Cookie Pinza.

695
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,166
But I don't want
to talk about Grace.

696
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,942
Do you love her?

697
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,913
I watch you.

698
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,809
The place where we live...
I watch you.

699
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,213
- Through my window?
- You saw me?

700
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,553
I figured maybe
somebody was there.

701
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,323
Did you know it was me?

702
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:46,164
You were just this guy
across the way.

703
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,066
Why do you use lemons?

704
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,834
The fish smell.
I'm embarrassed.

705
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:58,778
I thought maybe it was for some
other reasons I didn't understand.

706
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:04,315
I even went to a supermarket
to look at lemons.

707
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:09,683
It's just to get the smell off.
It's nothing weird.

708
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,629
What do you do
when you watch me?

709
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,635
I look at you.

710
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:25,197
You take off your blouse,
then you run the water.

711
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:29,108
Then you take a bottle of gold
perfume and put it on the sink.

712
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,548
Then you slice the lemons.

713
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,278
You open a box of blue soap.

714
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,550
You run your hands under the water
to feel the temperature.

715
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,417
Then you take the soap
in your hands and...

716
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:18,118
Are you Dave Matthews' wife?

717
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:21,156
Look, are you a cop? I told you guys
I don't know anything about him.

718
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,953
- Let's have a look in the bag.
- What are you talking about?

719
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:27,223
- The lady said...
- Let go of him!

720
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,401
Hey, you. Relax, old man.

721
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,734
This is none of your business.
You don't want to get hurt.

722
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,460
Are you all right?

723
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,700
Maybe you should go lie down.

724
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,938
I don't wanna lie down.

725
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,910
I didn't protect you.

726
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:05,216
Where the hell have you been?
Men were tearing the place apart.

727
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,626
You go out,
you don't even tell me you're going.

728
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,599
You okay?

729
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:15,361
What the hell are you wearing?

730
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,806
That girl buying your clothes now?

731
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:22,776
Miss, I warn you,
stay away from him.

732
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,813
Oh, Christ.

733
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:28,679
- Did he let that happen to you?
- I'm all right.

734
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,719
You shut up, Grace,
you goddamned old lady.

735
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:34,449
If I'm an old lady,
what does that make you?

736
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,117
I'm her lover!

737
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:40,719
You wanna know his nickname
in the old days? "Numb Nuts."

738
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,494
Men had names like "Legs"
and "Bullets" and "Cookie."

739
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,130
His was "Numb Nuts"!

740
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,469
Lou, open this door.

741
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:59,776
- I know you're hiding in there.
- Chrissie? Chrissie!

742
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:03,579
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't protect her.

743
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,779
What's your life worth?

744
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,448
Cookie had more manhood
in his toupee...

745
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,015
than you've got in your fat frame.

746
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,395
Open this door!

747
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:29,243
Chrissie, are you okay?

748
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,404
Chrissie, look.
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

749
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,109
It's me. Chrissie. Okay, look.
It's gonna be okay.

750
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:41,452
Lou, open the door, please.
I'm sorry.

751
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,491
You're a wonderful man.

752
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:47,256
Sometimes I forget to tell you
how much I love you.

753
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,966
Chrissie, listen to me.
You're all right. You're okay.

754
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,527
Just take it easy.
You're going to be fine.

755
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,095
You're all right.
That's it. Come on.

756
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:01,665
- Oh, my God.
- Why didn't you call the police?

757
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:05,180
My husband, Cookie Pinza,
said never call the police.

758
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,934
Honey, it's not the first time,
let me tell you.

759
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,837
When a bad element from New York
had my husband killed...

760
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:07,842
on the boardwalk,
Lou ran away.

761
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:11,778
He ran away then...

762
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,781
so he runs away now.

763
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,082
What did they want?

764
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,720
What are they looking for?

765
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,124
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.

766
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:29,255
- Don't give me that shit.
- She's a good girl!

767
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,356
Why did you come here?

768
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:36,899
To sell some dope.
We needed money for the baby.

769
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,871
There's nothing wrong with dope.
Dope belongs to the whole world.

770
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,714
Where did he get it?

771
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:50,274
Some people told us
about a drop in Philadelphia.

772
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,650
Philadelphia's a nice place.

773
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,155
What did he do with the money?

774
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,419
I don't know where the money is.

775
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,654
He went out with that old man.

776
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,760
- Dave went out with Lou?
- They took my scale.

777
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,629
Hey, I want to talk to...

778
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,499
Hey, Pops, what...

779
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:46,371
This is the last batch.
Five G's. Take it or leave it.

780
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:53,107
Pops, I'm a little tapped right now.
I can give you four G's...

781
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,115
give you the rest later,
all right?

782
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:02,320
I'll take it.

783
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,619
Call Fred at the Club Harlem.

784
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:11,131
Tell him you're dealing
with Lou Paschall... that's me.

785
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,168
Tell him to tell those hoods
to leave the women alone.

786
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,397
What they're looking for,
I got.

787
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:28,178
Lou, I'm gettin' compliments
on the suit, Lou.

788
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,480
You look sharp, Buddy,
real sharp.

789
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,233
In three weeks,
you'll become dealers...

790
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,872
and you'll learn a painful truth:

791
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,003
Everybody hates you.

792
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,706
You stand in the way
of a million dollars...

793
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,274
the player hates you.

794
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:08,016
You know enough to cheat
the casino... the casino hates you.

795
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:12,959
The TV camera over your head
tapes your every move...

796
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,724
and yet you are alone.

797
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,664
The players, the floor manager...

798
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:22,067
the eye in the sky...
they all watch you.

799
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,968
You're alone.

800
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,644
Mr. Shapiro wants to see you.

801
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,777
Mrs. Matthews, how you doin'?

802
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,080
Come on in.

803
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,282
Come on.

804
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,257
How are ya?

805
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,851
Sit here. Go on.

806
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,597
Your husband had a record.

807
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,862
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in eight months.

808
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:57,928
I know that, and I understand that,
and this is very unfair, but he...

809
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,236
I don't even know why he was here.

810
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:03,277
I know that, and you know that,
but they don't know that.

811
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,142
- "They"?
- The SEC...

812
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:08,080
the Gambling Commission,
the tax people... they don't know it.

813
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:15,021
We just can't afford to have people
with your connections working here.

814
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,923
I'm gonna tell you something.
I feel you have misled us, Sally.

815
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,927
Sally, right?

816
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:23,260
Mr. Shapiro, please. I've only got
three weeks of class left, I need...

817
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:27,461
Look, I am entirely on your side
in this situation...

818
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,471
but this is a very important job...

819
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,531
and I feel that I just have
to let you go.

820
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,167
I'm sorry.

821
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,273
Would it have made any difference
if we hadn't been married?

822
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,316
Marriage is not the point here.

823
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:46,218
We have to be very careful
of our people and who they know.

824
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:51,487
If this guy loved you, he would have
shown up sooner or later. You know?

825
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,790
So love is the point here.

826
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,460
Yeah.

827
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,534
- They fired me.
- What?

828
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:06,403
Six weeks of classes down the tubes,
just like that.

829
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:11,206
- Can you loan me 50 bucks?
- I don't have it.

830
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:13,042
I thought we were friends.

831
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:17,882
Listen, I saw your sugar daddy
down there at the tables.

832
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:23,182
- Really?
- Borrow from friends with bucks.

833
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:31,961
Twenty.

834
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,402
Push.

835
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:45,742
Can we talk to you?
I really think we should talk.

836
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:48,408
Sir, please don't bother
the players.

837
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,618
You're selling something
I believe belongs to us.

838
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:59,819
I'd like return of the item and
the money you received for the item.

839
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,056
Hey, man, there's
a game going on here.

840
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:06,157
And I'd like to know
how the connections were made.

841
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:10,261
Kid got my name in Vegas.
Harry Gropke sent him to me.

842
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,205
When you come to Atlantic City,
I'm the man to see.

843
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,904
Come on. We know who you are.
You're nothing, mister.

844
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,310
Hey, there's a game
going on here.

845
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:22,282
Sir, you can't disturb
the players.

846
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,284
I think we should
continue this outside.

847
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:26,445
- No.
- Let's go.

848
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:39,059
You're playing with Dave's money.
I'm owed it.

849
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:41,568
Madam, please. If you're not playing
you'll have to leave the table.

850
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,400
- Sit down and be quiet.
- You're buying me roses.

851
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:47,498
I'm fired from my job, I'm supposed
to sit here like some Vegas bimbo.

852
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,601
Mister, I got hoods
beating the shit out of me.

853
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,579
If I'm beat up for money and drugs,
I want the money and drugs on me.

854
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,414
Don't touch the suit.

855
01:20:56,484 --> 01:21:00,045
- You're like Dave gone senile.
- Madam, you'll have to go.

856
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:04,148
- Look, I trusted you.
- I'll take care of her.

857
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:06,820
Look, he took my money.
Make him give me back my money!

858
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,125
But I want my money!

859
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,131
You see that man over there?

860
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,292
- Where?
- In the blue suit?

861
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:17,828
- So?
- He only wants a blonde next to him.

862
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,498
What do you mean?

863
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:21,940
No, strictly for luck.
Nothing will happen.

864
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,945
If he loses, he'll be
too depressed to do anything.

865
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,948
If he wins,
he'll just talk about it.

866
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,054
- You pimp!
- What?

867
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:36,113
- What do you think I am?
- I was trying to help you!

868
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,887
Help me? You're trying to whore me.
Get your hands off me.

869
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,394
- You'll have to leave the casino.
- Leave me alone!

870
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,829
If you're gonna arrest somebody,
arrest that guy down there.

871
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,197
He's the one pushing drugs.
Leave me alone!

872
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,293
Somebody get my money back.
That guy took my money.

873
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:52,363
Let go of me!
Get me my money back!

874
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,374
This woman is not allowed
in the casino.

875
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,569
I don't want to be in the casino.
I want my money.

876
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,079
You let these punks in here,
you won't let me in here?

877
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:02,708
This guy beat me up.
He wrecked my house. Let go of me!

878
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,809
- Come on!
- I'm very, very sorry, sir.

879
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:07,013
This woman has just been fired.
She's very upset.

880
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:10,319
On behalf of the hotel,
I'd like to give you reservations...

881
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:14,590
for the Camelot Room,
also the Superstar Room.

882
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,591
Get your hands off of me!
Let go of me!

883
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,862
Let go!
I can walk out by myself.

884
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:24,895
Get your hands off of me!
Will you get your hands...

885
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:28,204
Let go of me!
Let go!

886
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:34,211
Let go! Are you happy?
Okay? I'm out!

887
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,418
Shit!

888
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,484
Hey, stop! Wait!

889
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:53,393
Where did he just go?

890
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,336
Thank you.

891
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,321
I need your help.

892
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,891
My father, he's escaped.

893
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:32,303
He's on your bus. He's the old guy
with the white hat and trench coat.

894
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:35,935
- He's not right in the head.
- What do you want me to do?

895
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,538
Could you please get him off
the bus? He needs his medication.

896
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,014
- Yeah. Leave it to me.
- Thank you.

897
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:48,919
We made a little mistake.
We've oversold the bus.

898
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,959
So one of you is gonna have
to get off.

899
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,692
You were the last person
to buy a ticket, sir.

900
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:58,733
- Come on, old man. Come on, sir.
- What?

901
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,928
We've oversold the bus, sir.
I'm afraid you have to get off.

902
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:04,233
You got plenty of seats.

903
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,138
Yeah, but they're reserved.
I'm sorry. Come on, sir.

904
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,641
Jeez, I mean...

905
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,974
- We got a schedule, sir.
- Is there another bus?

906
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,140
There's another bus coming
right behind, sir.

907
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:18,709
Can't hold up all these people.
That's it. Come on, sir.

908
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:21,381
- Your daughter will care for you.
- I got no daughter.

909
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:24,755
- Let's not be naughty.
- Come on, Pops.

910
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,987
This woman is not my daughter.

911
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:31,089
I talked to Jimmy and the kids.
You can have your own room and TV.

912
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:35,227
And Jimmy won't play his stereo loud
if you won't smoke in the closet.

913
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:38,563
I made love to this woman today.

914
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,164
Daddy, please!

915
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:43,267
I held her in my arms,
and I made her happy.

916
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,278
- Let's not be naughty.
- It's gonna be okay.

917
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:48,076
It's gonna be all right.
We'll take good care of him.

918
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:51,710
I'm dangerous!
People come to me from Las Vegas.

919
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:54,584
I know Bugsy Siegel.
I was his cellmate.

920
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:58,251
I want that money.
It belongs to me.

921
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:03,694
You have money. I've seen it.
Don't give me that shit.

922
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:07,132
- Listen, I don't have it.
- Give it to me.

923
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,912
Hey, old man.

924
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,276
Hey, foxy grandpa.

925
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:30,848
It's over now. I want the money.
You know what I'm talking about.

926
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,688
Give me the money.

927
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,218
Give me the money now.

928
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,821
You bitch!

929
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:41,596
You slapped me! You slapped me,
you stupid bitch!

930
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:44,229
The money. Money, money!

931
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,159
Come on, get outta here.

932
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:16,097
Get in the car!

933
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,933
I can't believe I did it.

934
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,026
Am I bleeding?
Did he cut me?

935
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:54,268
I can't believe I did it. I really
did it! Did you see me do it?

936
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:55,934
I'm all right.

937
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:59,411
When I saw that knife on you,
I pulled the trigger. Bam, bam!

938
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,608
- Did you see the look on his face?
- Get rid of that gun.

939
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:07,417
- I protected you.
- Stop pointing... Get rid of it.

940
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:20,632
- How much?
- A quarter. Can't you read?

941
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:24,832
Lady, it's the first time I've been
out of Atlantic City in 20 years.

942
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:28,732
A thousand dollar bill?

943
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,437
I'm sorry.

944
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:34,043
- Here.
- Here's a hundred.

945
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,050
I'll lend you the quarter.

946
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,915
Thank you, madam.

947
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,893
A room for me and my mother.

948
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:57,096
And we want some drinks.
Bourbon, Coke.

949
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:02,969
No, wait. Make that champagne,
peanuts, crackers.

950
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:05,239
The expensive kind.
The French kind.

951
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:07,747
Got it?

952
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:16,080

<i>We'll have more from Atlantic City</i>

978
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:38,734
Is this the stomach?

979
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:41,138
Is this the baby?

980
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:42,938
It feels nice.

981
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,572
I came here during the war.

982
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:51,413
Betty Grable look-alike contest.

983
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:56,446
The boardwalk filled with hundreds
of Betty Grable look-alikes...

984
01:29:56,524 --> 01:30:00,119
from all over America
selling war bonds.

985
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:06,698
<i>On the boardwalk</i>
<i>in Atlantic City</i>

986
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:09,999
<i>Life will be peaches and cream</i>

987
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,869
You never went back home?

988
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,103
I met some boys. Lou.

989
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:20,341
Cookie Pinza,
who I later married.

990
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,145
Atlantic City became my home.

991
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:30,886
You oughta fly home.

992
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:34,995
I'll treat you to the ticket.

993
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,156
You will?

994
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,463
If you can get a seat belt
around that.

995
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:47,133
I never use seat belts.
I don't believe in gravity.

996
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:53,002
We both lost our men
through a shooting.

997
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,173
I don't mind that Dave's dead.

998
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:58,844
It just means he'll be
reincarnated sooner, that's all.

999
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:03,254
You mean Cookie's coming back?

1000
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:06,259
Sure! Everything comes back.

1001
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:11,790
You know,
you look after people good.

1002
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:17,797
I never had to look after anybody.

1003
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,333
I was a princess!

1004
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:40,359
I like that...
making the news.

1005
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:51,795
Who was Bugsy Siegel?

1006
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,803
The meanest, the coldest.

1007
01:31:56,878 --> 01:32:00,405
- And he was your cellmate?
- I gotta be honest.

1008
01:32:00,481 --> 01:32:02,676
- I was in the slammer on a D & D.
- What's that?

1009
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,718
D & D. Drunk and disorderly.

1010
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:08,186
They brought Bugsy in for ten
minutes on the way to Leavenworth.

1011
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,918
Man, was he pissed off.

1012
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:12,983
He didn't even know me.

1013
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:16,063
And that's all?

1014
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:22,197
I never killed anybody in my life.

You saw it.

1017

Yeah, I saw it.

Some champagne?

You got all those young guys.
Bernie.

1020
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:54,263
You could still see them.

1021
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:56,326
I'm an old man.

1022
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:02,832
Is this a proposal?

1023
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:09,477

like I did?

1024

1025
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,883
Yes.

1026
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:14,979
They got nice weather in Florida.

1027

1028
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:20,153

down there.

I'll buy you new clothes.
I'll show you off.

1030

1031
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:28,457
You know. Just let the boys see
how well I turned out.
