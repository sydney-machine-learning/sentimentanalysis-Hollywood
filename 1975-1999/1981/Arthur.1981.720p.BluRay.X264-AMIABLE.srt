Arthur. I demand
that you take this money.

1347

I want a decision, and I want it now.

I can't tell you what a lousy wedding
that was, Bitterman.

- Bitterman, goodbye. Thank you.
- I'm going.

01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:29,805
Goodbye, sir.
It was a pleasure working for you.

1352
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,820
Chauffeurs rarely get to laugh.
Thank you.

1353

- Goodbye, Bitterman.
- Goodbye, miss.

01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,953
Arthur, I'm going.
Open that door, Rockland.

- Ever been on a yacht?
- No. Is it wonderful?

1356

It doesn't suck.

1357

Arthur, I shall never offer you
this money again.

1358

I wish you luck in your poverty.

What...? What happened?

- Oh, I turned her down.
- Oh.

1362
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:28,249
Well, she invited us for dinner, and I said
we're having a tuna fish sandwich.

1363
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:30,413
So I turned her down.

1364
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:33,415
I took the money. I mean, I'm not crazy.

Bitterman,
do you wanna double your salary?

1367
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:39,836
- Yes, sir.
- Then open that door.

1368

- Right away.
- Is that funny?

Where to, sir?

1371
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,728
The park, Bitterman.
Drive through the park.

1372
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:51,523
You know how I love the park.
