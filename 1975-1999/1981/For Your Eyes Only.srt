1
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,252
Mr. Bond, Mr. Bond,
I'm so glad I caught you.

2
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:16,839
Your office called. They're sending
a helicopter to pick you up.

3
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,674
Some sort of emergency.

4
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,843
It usually is.
Thank you.

5
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,470
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond.

6
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:49,265
Don't concern yourself
with the pilot.

7
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:51,475
One of my less useful people.

8
00:02:57,064 --> 00:03:00,568
You are now flying
Remote Control Airways.

9
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:32,808
Think twice, 007.
It's a long way down.

10
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:12,807
I've looked forward
to this moment, Mr. Bond.

11
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,977
I intend to enjoy it
to the full.

12
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,850
Really, have you no respect
for the dead?

13
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,105
Good-bye, Mr. Bond.

14
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:04,233
I trust you had a pleasant...
fright.

15
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:26,088
You are fading
from my picture, Mr. Bond.

16
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:30,426
But the end
cannot be far away.

17
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,254
Mr. Bond! Mr. Bond!

18
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,676
We can do a deal!

19
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,639
I'll buy you a delicatessen
in stainless steel.

20
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,350
Please!

21
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,269
All right, keep your hair on.

22
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:24,480
Put me down!
Put me down!

23
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,983
Oh, you want to get off?

24
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,529
Mr. Bond!

25
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,598
For your eyes only

26
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,935
Can see me through the night

27
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:07,356
For your eyes only

28
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,860
I never need to hide

29
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:15,907
You can see so much in me

30
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:19,118
So much in me that's new

31
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,293
I never felt till I looked at you

32
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:32,798
For your eyes only

33
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,635
Only for you

34
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,470
You'll see what no one else can see

35
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,473
Now I'm breakin' free

36
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,476
For your eyes only

37
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,021
Only for you

38
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,149
The love I know you need in me

39
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,110
The fantasy you freed in me

40
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:57,114
Only for you

41
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,755
For your eyes only

42
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:15,883
The nights are never cold

43
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:20,972
You really know me

44
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:24,517
That's all I need to know

45
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,564
Maybe I'm an open book

46
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:33,067
Because I know you're mine

47
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:41,200
But you won't need
to read between the lines

48
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:46,831
For your eyes only

49
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,500
Only for you

50
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,419
You'll see what no one else can see
'cause now I'm breakin' free

51
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:58,175
For your eyes only

52
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,845
Only for you

53
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:04,098
The passions that collide in me

54
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:06,893
The wild, abandoned side of me

55
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:10,980
Only for you

56
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:16,944
For your eyes only

57
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:24,011
Afternoon.
How's it looking topside?

58
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:27,014
Beautiful day.
Just bringing the nets in.

59
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,016
Fish for supper again.

60
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:43,406
Decode of Russian satellite data, sir,
on British and American ship positions.

61
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,950
- Verify and advise Admiralty.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,788
- Afternoon, sir.
- Oh, hello, Mac.

63
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,333
My watch.

64
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:41,005
Where the hell
did that come from?

65
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:49,138
- What the devil's going on here?
- An unidentified object closing fast.

66
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:09,033
Destruct ATAC system.

67
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:51,701
- Yes?
- First Sea Lord and Vice Admiral, sir.

68
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,327
Send them in.

69
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,042
Shocking news, Minister.

70
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,671
I'm afraid we've lost our electronic
surveillance ship, the St. Georges.

71
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:06,007
We had a routine message
at 1600 hours yesterday...

72
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,634
then nothing.

73
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,511
We sighted floating debris
this morning.

74
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:14,182
My God, Jack.
How deep is the water there?

75
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:17,226
Not deep enough, I'm afraid.

76
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:23,065
Yes, Comrade Secretary.
Off Albania.

77
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,695
The suspected British spy ship
which we have been monitoring.

78
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,115
It suggests that there is a chance
of obtaining...

79
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,117
the ATAC transmitter.

80
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:38,581
Oh, of course, comrade.
There will be no direct involvement...

81
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:42,084
but if it comes on the market,
we should not lose...

82
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,587
such a remarkable opportunity.

83
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:51,260
With that in mind, I've already
contacted our usual friend in Greece.

84
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:43,312
Down you go. Go on.

85
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,815
Down you go.

86
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,823
Give us a kiss.
Give us a kiss.

87
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:56,617
I'll give you a nut.
Here you are. Go on.

88
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,957
Come on.

89
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,169
- Your packages, senorita.
- Oh, thank you.

90
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,551
Melina!

91
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,820
- Thank you, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.

92
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,199
Welcome home, Melina, my darling.

93
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,242
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

94
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:41,245
Your call from Athens
was such a pleasant surprise.

95
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,248
I was lucky to find you.
You left Crete so suddenly.

96
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:47,919
Ah, yes, I wanted to come back here
and start work on the temple again.

97
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:51,255
- You between jobs?
- Only for a few days.

98
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:55,468
- I'll lend a hand if you want.
- Darling, it's beautiful. Thank you.

99
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:58,554
That's for you,
and pistachios for Max.

100
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,802
James.

101
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:23,097
Moneypenny,
a feast for my eyes.

102
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,099
What about the rest of you?

103
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,643
Well, I was going to get
around to that.

104
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,479
You'd better go in.
M's on leave...

105
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,648
and the minister's arrived here
with the chief of staff...

106
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,859
and wants to see you immediately.

107
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,486
- I'll be right back.
- I can hardly wait.

108
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,907
Oh, haven't you forgotten something?

109
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,242
Oh. Well, as M's away...

110
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,084
Ah, there you are, 007.

111
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,253
Minister, Chief of Staff.

112
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,923
Are you aware
of our ATAC system, 007?

113
00:17:57,006 --> 00:18:00,593
ATAC, sir? Automatic Targeting
Attack Communicator.

114
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:03,095
Uses an ultra-low frequency coded
transmitter...

115
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,057
to order our submarines
to launch ballistic missiles.

116
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,560
Five days ago, our spy ship,
St. Georges was sunk...

117
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,062
in the Ionian Sea.

118
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:13,356
She was equipped with ATAC.

119
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:15,608
Now, if that transmitter
were to fall into the wrong hands...

120
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,569
it would render our entire
Polaris fleet useless.

121
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,573
- Every order could be countermanded.
- Worse.

122
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:26,369
Our own submarines could be ordered
to attack our own cities.

123
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:29,872
Have we begun
a salvage operation, Minister?

124
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:32,917
An official operation
was out of the question.

125
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,419
The St. Georges was off
the Albanian coast.

126
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:36,921
We asked Sir Timothy Havelock...

127
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:39,549
the marine archaeologist,
to secretly locate the wreck.

128
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:42,426
Before he could send in his report,
he and his wife were killed...

129
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:45,555
by a Cuban hit man,
Hector Gonzales.

130
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:48,641
The Greek police were able
to identify Gonzales...

131
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,936
from a description given to them
by Melina, Sir Havelock's daughter.

132
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:56,566
Operation Undertow.
The information's all here.

133
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,235
Now, Gonzales is at a villa
near Madrid.

134
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,612
Isolate him and apply
the necessary pressure...

135
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:04,699
to find out who hired him.

136
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:37,018
A Walther PPK...

137
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:40,521
standard issue,
British Secret Service.

138
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,023
License to kill.

139
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:45,610
Or be killed.

140
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,862
Take him away.

141
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:06,107
Whoever you are, you've outstayed
your welcome. Come on.

142
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:40,183
- Well, I hope you have a car.
- This way.

143
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,369
Hurry.

144
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:15,218
- Who are you?
- He killed my parents.

145
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:18,846
The Havelocks?
I'm sorry.

146
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:27,355
How did you know
where Gonzales was?

147
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:30,775
Through a detective agency.
What were you doing there?

148
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:35,238
I'm afraid we're being
out-horsepowered.

149
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,129
Excuse me.

150
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:06,602
Take the low road.

151
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:11,065
Not that low.

152
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,831
You don't mind
if I drive, do you?

153
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:46,744
Go backwards. Forwards.
Quickly.

154
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:51,475
I love a drive in the country,
don't you?

155
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,817
Hold tight.

156
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:28,346
Oh, by the way, we haven't been
properly introduced, Melina.

157
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:31,933
My name is Bond, James Bond.

158
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:40,525
Olympic has a flight at 11:00.

159
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:46,322
It should be safe to go
to the airport now.

160
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:55,748
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, really.

161
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,293
Are you going back
to your father's ship?

162
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:03,631
Yes, I'm continuing his work,
but this business is still unfinished.

163
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:06,676
- What business?
- The man who paid Gonzales.

164
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:10,513
The Chinese have a saying:

165
00:29:10,555 --> 00:29:15,518
"Before setting out on revenge,
you first dig two graves. "

166
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:18,020
I don't expect you to understand.

167
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:21,858
You're English,
but I'm half Greek.

168
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,610
And Greek women, like Electra...

169
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:27,572
always avenge their loved ones.

170
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:30,575
I must go.

171
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:41,711
You were meant to question Gonzales,
not let Miss Havelock perforate him.

172
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:43,212
I quite agree, sir.

173
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:47,383
We'll have to tell the prime minister
Operation Undertow is dead in the water.

174
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,552
She'll have our guts
for garters.

175
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:52,096
If you care to look again...

176
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,265
at page two, paragraph four
of my report, sir...

177
00:29:54,348 --> 00:29:57,351
you will note that I saw someone
paying off Gonzales.

178
00:29:57,435 --> 00:30:00,646
Now, assuming that that was
for Havelock's murder...

179
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,356
then there's still
a glimmer of hope.

180
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,900
I don't follow.

181
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,444
If we could identify that someone...

182
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:08,446
Why don't you try
the identigraph?

183
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:13,576
- Yes, sir.
- Get cracking, 007.

184
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,329
Minister.

185
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,920
Hello, Q.
Smithers, how's the arm?

186
00:30:24,003 --> 00:30:25,963
Coming along very nicely,
thank you, sir.

187
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:30,259
Oh, that'll come in handy.

188
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:32,261
What are you doing here, 007?

189
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:34,639
- Identigraph, Q.
- This way.

190
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:49,278
- Stinging in the rain?
- That's not funny, 007.

191
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:53,115
I see you managed to get the Lotus
back together again.

192
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:57,286
I disregard these jibes
about our equipment, 007.

193
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,539
I don't suppose you find it funny
in the field.

194
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,040
Indeed, I don't.

195
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:11,634
This 3-D Visual Identigraph
is still in the experimental stage.

196
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:14,929
Now, once we get
a composite of the man...

197
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:18,307
we can find a match by patching
into the photographic files...

198
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,311
of the Surety, Interpol,
CIA, the Mossad.

199
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:27,275
And the West German police.
You've told me so already five times.

200
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,445
Thank you, 007.
Right.

201
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:36,200
Now describe the person
you wish to identify...

202
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:38,244
and I'll program the information.

203
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:42,206
Male Caucasian,
late thirties.

204
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:46,878
Hair: Fine, light brown.

205
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:51,048
That's it.

206
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,885
- Parted in the middle.
- Wait a minute.

207
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:56,470
- Right.
- Eyes.

208
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:58,681
- A little smaller.
- Uh-huh.

209
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:02,476
Blue. A little grayer.

210
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,646
That's it. You have it.
Now, nose.

211
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:11,194
- A nose, not a banana, Q.
- I'm sorry.

212
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:12,904
Stop.

213
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:14,864
Lips fuller.

214
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:16,407
Mm-hmm. Oops.

215
00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:21,829
No, no, mouth wider.
Good.

216
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,501
Thank you.

217
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:30,004
Thank you, Sharon.

218
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:33,007
- You can go. I'll lock up.
- Okay.

219
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:38,763
I reckon we're almost there, Q,
apart from glasses.

220
00:32:38,804 --> 00:32:40,181
Steel-rimmed.

221
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:42,558
- Yeah.
- Octagonal.

222
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,227
Octagonal.

223
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:49,565
That's him.
That's our man.

224
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:53,110
Right. I'll try
and get a match.

225
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,210
Yes.

226
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:12,129
The man we want is
Emile Leopold Locque...

227
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:14,757
an enforcer
in the Brussels underworld.

228
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:16,300
He's been convicted
of several...

229
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,427
particularly brutal murders.

230
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:20,721
He escaped from Namur Prison...

231
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:22,932
by strangling his psychiatrist.

232
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:26,727
He has worked for drug syndicates
in Marseilles and Hong Kong.

233
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:29,438
Now reported working
for Greek smugglers.

234
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,942
The Italian Secret Service think
that he is, at this moment, in Cortina.

235
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:36,988
I'll instruct Ferrara, our man
in northern Italy, to contact you there.

236
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:41,284
- Yes, sir.
- And 007, try not to muck it up again.

237
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,911
I'll do my best, sir.

238
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:46,873
I'll leave you to lock up.
Let me out, will you?

239
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:27,890
The snow this year
is better at Innsbruck.

240
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:30,518
But not at St. Moritz.

241
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:34,522
- Ferrara.
- Bond. James.

242
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:36,524
Luigi.

243
00:35:36,607 --> 00:35:39,235
I presume London has briefed you.

244
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:42,572
If Locque's in Cortina,
we'll find him.

245
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:46,534
I have a reliable Greek contact here,
an Anglophile.

246
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:49,662
He helped us out last year
on a smuggling operation.

247
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:52,832
- What's he doing in Cortina?
- He...

248
00:35:56,794 --> 00:36:00,381
Spends a few months a year here
at his chalet.

249
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:04,719
He's in shipping, insurance,
oil exploration.

250
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:06,762
Knows everything going on.

251
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:08,848
Very reliable.

252
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:12,560
The British gave him the King's Medal
for resistance fighting during the war.

253
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,437
Yes, but can I meet him?

254
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,608
I've set it up. He is waiting for us
at the Olympic ice rink.

255
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:43,007
- Kristatos. Ari Kristatos.
- Bond. James Bond.

256
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,092
Would you care to join me
in some gluhwein?

257
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:47,261
That's a very good idea.
Thank you.

258
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:52,266
Well, gentlemen,
how can I help you?

259
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,977
We'd like some information.

260
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,529
My protege.
A sure winner...

261
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,030
in the next Olympics.

262
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:08,533
She's completely absorbed
in her skating...

263
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,826
but innocent in the ways
of the world.

264
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,287
The day she wins the gold medal...

265
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:16,290
will be the greatest in my life.

266
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,176
Bibi, here are some
new admirers for you.

267
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,346
Mr. Bond, Mr. Ferrara,
Bibi Dahl...

268
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:34,183
and her coach, Jacoba Brink,
once a world-class skater herself.

269
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:35,852
I've seen Miss Brink skate.

270
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:38,896
I think the world will soon be seeing
a great deal of your skating too.

271
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:40,898
Only if she works harder.

272
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:42,733
- Much harder.
- Oh, Uncle Ari.

273
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:44,735
Can I stop now?
I'm pooped.

274
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:47,530
That's for Miss Brink to decide.

275
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:50,408
Come, Bibi,
another half hour of practice.

276
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:52,702
Uncle Ari, will you take me
to the biathlon?

277
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:55,246
Bibi, you know I have to work
this afternoon.

278
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,878
Bibi wants to know
if you would escort her, Mr. Bond.

279
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,880
- I don't think...
- I would feel better...

280
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,882
if there were someone with her.

281
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:11,762
I'd be delighted.
I'm staying at the Miramonti.

282
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:13,389
Great!

283
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:17,518
How can I help?

284
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,729
- Do you know this man?
- Yes. Locque.

285
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,565
Columbo's right hand.

286
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:25,026
Milos Columbo.
His name came up in connection...

287
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:27,278
with a smuggling operation
last year.

288
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:32,450
That's the least of his offenses.
Drugs, white slavery, contract murder.

289
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:36,078
In the Greek underworld,
he in known as "the Dove. "

290
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:37,747
A very sick joke.

291
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,125
- Where is this Dove?
- Somewhere in Greece, I would guess.

292
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,961
Once we were like brothers.
Now he hates me.

293
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:46,422
We fought together
in the Greek resistance...

294
00:38:46,464 --> 00:38:48,966
then against the Communists.

295
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:51,135
After that,
he took a different path.

296
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:57,725
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Kristatos.

297
00:38:57,808 --> 00:38:59,560
My pleasure.
I leave for Corfu soon.

298
00:38:59,644 --> 00:39:02,438
If I get any more information,
I will call Ferrara.

299
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:17,203
What do you think, Luigi?
Does this "Dove" Columbo...

300
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,205
have the resources
to mount a salvage operation?

301
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:23,960
Oh, definitely. He runs a fleet of
intercoastal freighters in the Aegean.

302
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:27,171
I'll ring my office in Milano.
They may have more on him.

303
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,017
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

304
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:57,660
Is this the one you mean?

305
00:39:57,702 --> 00:40:01,664
Thank you. I'll take it.
Deliver it to the Hotel Cristalo.

306
00:40:11,215 --> 00:40:13,176
I beg your pardon.

307
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:18,389
- May I help you?
- Yes, give me a dozen lilies.

308
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:19,682
Will you?

309
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:28,232
I'll pick them up later.

310
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,992
Come on, quickly.

311
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:56,469
Send them to the funeral,
will you?

312
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:04,894
Slow down. Would you mind telling me
what the devil you're doing in Cortina?

313
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:08,481
- Your telegram.
- What telegram?

314
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:11,984
It said you found the man
and to meet you here today.

315
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:13,444
I didn't send it.

316
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:14,946
Now, get in.

317
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:18,950
The station, please.

318
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:23,246
- Are we leaving?
- Not "we. " You. And now.

319
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:25,790
You don't tell me
what to do.

320
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:44,517
Did you find the man
who hired Gonzales?

321
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:47,270
I'm working on it.

322
00:41:47,311 --> 00:41:49,272
He's here, isn't he?

323
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:53,734
That's why you're here.
Driver, stop! Go back!

324
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,865
- I'm staying.
- So you can put an arrow in his back?

325
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:02,076
You do that, and we'll never find out
who or what is behind all this.

326
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,830
It was my parents they killed,
not yours. Let me out. Driver, stop!

327
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,752
Melina, look at me.

328
00:42:11,836 --> 00:42:14,463
You were lucky once,
but they are onto you now.

329
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:17,967
The telegram, the motorcycles
back there. They prove it.

330
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:21,345
- Let me handle this.
- You? How are you involved?

331
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:25,433
All I can tell you is it's something
of vital interest to both our countries.

332
00:42:25,516 --> 00:42:28,436
More important than my parents?

333
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:32,398
Your father was part of it.

334
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,400
He thought it important enough
to risk his life.

335
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:37,028
Now, Melina, please trust me.

336
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:39,197
Go back to the Triaina and wait.

337
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,033
Let me find out what I can here,
then I'll come straight to Corfu.

338
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:44,035
- I promise you.
- Okay.

339
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:47,955
I'll go back and wait,
but not for long.

340
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,540
It won't be, I swear.

341
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:41,926
Don't they have showers
at the ice rink?

342
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:43,928
How did you get in here?

343
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:45,763
One of the porters is a fan.

344
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:51,185
He'll do anything for me,
and I'll do anything for you.

345
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,272
Well, I'm exceedingly
flattered, Bibi...

346
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:56,107
but you're in training.

347
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,111
That's a laugh. Everybody knows
it builds up muscle tone.

348
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:05,241
How about building up a little more
muscle tone by putting on your clothes?

349
00:44:07,535 --> 00:44:08,953
Don't you like me?

350
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:13,499
I think you're wonderful, Bibi...

351
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:17,003
but I don't think your Uncle Ari
would approve.

352
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:20,173
Him? He thinks
I'm still a virgin.

353
00:44:21,716 --> 00:44:27,263
Yes, well, you get your clothes on,
and I'll buy you an ice cream.

354
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:36,814
Shall we?

355
00:44:42,904 --> 00:44:45,114
Don't you ever come up for air?

356
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:48,784
That's why I'll get the gold medal...
breath control.

357
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:51,787
Yes, well, you can't lose.

358
00:45:21,317 --> 00:45:23,277
And now, Erich Kriegler...

359
00:45:23,361 --> 00:45:26,239
last year's East European champion.

360
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:35,498
There's Erich Kriegler.

361
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,458
The East German champion?

362
00:45:39,043 --> 00:45:40,753
Isn't he beautiful?

363
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:42,880
You know something, Bibi?
You're fickle.

364
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:46,259
Hey, Erich!

365
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,762
Come on, let's go watch him shoot.

366
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,461
We'll have a drink
at the finish.

367
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:26,674
Well, Bibi, I'm afraid
I have to leave you.

368
00:46:26,757 --> 00:46:30,136
- No, James, stay with me.
- I have an appointment.

369
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:35,308
Will you come and say good-bye to me
at the practice rink later?

370
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:37,602
Please, James, we're going back
to Greece soon.

371
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:39,604
All right, but if I can't make it...

372
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:41,939
all I can say is
don't grow up any more.

373
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:45,401
- Huh?
- The opposite sex won't survive it.

374
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,201
Won't take long.

375
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:58,371
- Don't play with any of the switches.
- Right.

376
00:56:13,845 --> 00:56:15,805
What took you so long?

377
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:17,640
I took the scenic route.

378
00:56:19,016 --> 00:56:22,144
Tell me more about your boyfriend,
Erich Kriegler.

379
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:26,440
He doesn't smoke, he only eats health
foods and he won't even talk to girls.

380
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:29,777
James, you're jealous.

381
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:34,991
Of course. What else can you tell me
about my rival for your affections?

382
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:38,494
They say he's a defector
from East Germany.

383
00:56:38,536 --> 00:56:41,247
It is time
for your rubdown.

384
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:53,176
I could eat you up alive.

385
00:56:55,887 --> 00:56:59,807
Farewell, Mr. Bond,
but not good-bye.

386
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,954
I'll be finished around 6:00.
Meet me here.

387
00:58:47,206 --> 00:58:49,167
How did you know I was here?

388
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:52,503
I radio telephoned the Triaina,
and they told me you were coming ashore.

389
00:58:52,587 --> 00:58:55,464
I have to go shopping for the crew.
Come with me, we can talk.

390
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:56,632
Why not?

391
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:21,657
Thank you.

392
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,458
I think you may need that.

393
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,861
My father loved the view
from here.

394
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:03,241
- I can see why.
- We came here often.

395
01:00:03,324 --> 01:00:05,576
- Is Corfu your home?
- No.

396
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:09,163
My real home's always been
the Triaina, the Greek islands...

397
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:13,292
Turkey, North Africa...
wherever my father's work took us.

398
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,381
Did he leave any notes?
They could help us.

399
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:20,883
No, I don't think so.

400
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:24,720
To tell you the truth...

401
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:28,140
I haven't had the courage
to go into his study since.

402
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:31,811
Try not to think about it now.

403
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,730
I'm meeting a man tonight
at the casino who may give us a lead.

404
01:01:06,888 --> 01:01:09,265
You're perspiring, Bunky.

405
01:01:10,558 --> 01:01:11,976
Contessa.

406
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:25,489
500,000.

407
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:28,826
Only half?
Where's your courage, Bunky?

408
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:32,788
Courage is no match
for an unfriendly shoe, Countess.

409
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,293
Bravo, Bunky.

410
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:45,593
Lucky night.

411
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:06,614
The odds favor standing pat.

412
01:02:06,697 --> 01:02:08,491
If you play the odds.

413
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:20,378
Would you cash these in
for me, please?

414
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:22,880
Thank you. Excuse me.

415
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:43,484
Aperitif, please?

416
01:02:43,568 --> 01:02:45,486
Ouzo for me, please.

417
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,824
And a whiskey.

418
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:52,660
And to eat?

419
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:57,665
I'll have the prawns,
salad and Bourdetto.

420
01:02:57,748 --> 01:02:59,876
An excellent choice.
I'll have the same.

421
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:03,671
May I suggest a white wine
from my home place?

422
01:03:03,754 --> 01:03:07,675
If you'll forgive me, that's
a little too scented for my palate.

423
01:03:07,758 --> 01:03:10,803
I prefer the Theotaki Aspro.

424
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,142
After our last meeting,
I am asking myself...

425
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:19,270
why you want to know about Locque,
Columbo's man.

426
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:23,900
I know Columbo runs heroin
to be refined here...

427
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:25,860
before it's sent to England.

428
01:03:25,943 --> 01:03:28,112
So I think I see the answer.

429
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:31,115
You're from the British Narcotics Board.

430
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:33,409
Am I right?

431
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:35,161
Go on.

432
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,291
I wish you luck, my friend.

433
01:03:40,374 --> 01:03:43,377
But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.

434
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:47,673
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.

435
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,300
Find some different way.

436
01:03:49,383 --> 01:03:52,678
You may have to kill him.

437
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,598
Does this discourage you?

438
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,478
- Just tell me where he is.
- Over there.

439
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:02,063
With the woman in blue.

440
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:09,111
We ignore each other,
but I wanted you to see him.

441
01:04:09,195 --> 01:04:10,988
He is a secret partner
in this casino.

442
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:13,324
But we are perfectly safe.

443
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:16,410
He will do nothing in his own place.

444
01:04:16,494 --> 01:04:18,788
And the countess?

445
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,833
Lisl, an Austrian.

446
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:25,461
Expensive mistress.
She sometimes shills for the house.

447
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:28,172
She bets with other people's money.

448
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:53,322
But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.

449
01:04:53,364 --> 01:04:56,993
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.

450
01:04:57,034 --> 01:04:59,537
You must find a different way.

451
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,540
You may have to kill him.

452
01:05:02,623 --> 01:05:07,211
Does this discourage you?

453
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,213
Just tell me where he is.

454
01:05:23,477 --> 01:05:26,856
You are a disgusting man.
How dare you talk to me like that?

455
01:05:26,898 --> 01:05:31,110
I will speak to you any way I please.
Sit down.

456
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:33,571
You're making a spectacle
of yourself.

457
01:05:34,906 --> 01:05:35,865
Get out!

458
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:39,243
Nothing would please me more.

459
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:50,713
- This may be an opportunity.
- This may be a trap.

460
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:52,965
If you play the odds.

461
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:56,511
As you wish. Take my car.
I'll play a little chemin.

462
01:05:56,594 --> 01:05:59,180
Ask the chauffeur
to come back for me.

463
01:06:09,524 --> 01:06:11,442
Allow me.

464
01:06:11,526 --> 01:06:13,402
May I drive you home?

465
01:06:13,486 --> 01:06:16,030
No, thank you.
I'll take a taxi.

466
01:06:16,113 --> 01:06:18,032
No courage?

467
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:21,077
Seriously, you may have a job
finding one.

468
01:06:22,328 --> 01:06:25,289
Well, you look like a gentleman.

469
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:26,791
Why not?

470
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:37,635
I am the Countess Lisl Von Schlaf.

471
01:06:37,718 --> 01:06:39,720
My name is Bond.

472
01:06:39,804 --> 01:06:44,100
I'm writing a novel
about Greek smugglers. Know any?

473
01:06:44,183 --> 01:06:47,436
Smugglers? How would I know
any smugglers?

474
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,774
I would think that
a lady in your position...

475
01:06:51,816 --> 01:06:53,901
would get to know many things.

476
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:55,486
I'd be most grateful.

477
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:57,321
How grateful?

478
01:06:57,405 --> 01:06:58,614
Very.

479
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:01,742
I adore grateful men.

480
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:35,026
May I call you tomorrow, Countess?

481
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:38,446
I'm a night person. I have
champagne and oysters in the fridge.

482
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:40,448
Why not come in for a bite?

483
01:07:44,368 --> 01:07:47,580
I won't need you anymore tonight.

484
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,359
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.

485
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:23,699
Whoops!

486
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:26,285
Me nightie's slipping.

487
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,287
So is your accent, Countess.

488
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,834
- Manchester?
- Close.

489
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:35,378
Liverpool.

490
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:37,171
It was an amusing performance...

491
01:08:37,255 --> 01:08:40,591
between you and the owner of this.

492
01:08:40,675 --> 01:08:42,885
What exactly did Columbo whisper to you?

493
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:46,931
That you're a spy.
To find out more about you.

494
01:08:48,099 --> 01:08:49,517
And have you?

495
01:08:51,477 --> 01:08:53,396
Have I ever.

496
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:23,009
When you're ready to leave,
you can take my car.

497
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:26,012
That sounds like a dismissal.

498
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,431
I was looking forward to breakfast.

499
01:10:09,222 --> 01:10:10,973
Lisl, come back!

500
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,550
Get in... Ooh!

501
01:10:58,271 --> 01:11:00,314
Goodbye, Countess.

502
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:07,446
What...

503
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:53,201
- What should I do with you?
- You cannot just arrest him.

504
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,453
You must find a different way.

505
01:11:55,536 --> 01:11:58,039
You may have to kill him.

506
01:11:58,122 --> 01:12:00,291
- Does this discourage you?
- Huh?

507
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:03,252
Just tell me where he is.

508
01:12:03,294 --> 01:12:08,341
I'm here, Mr. Bond
of the British Secret Service.

509
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,259
But I'll tell you...

510
01:12:10,343 --> 01:12:12,762
it is Kristatos you want, not me.

511
01:12:12,803 --> 01:12:15,932
He told you about himself.

512
01:12:16,015 --> 01:12:19,560
He's the one
with the powerful connections.

513
01:12:19,644 --> 01:12:21,771
Locque works for him,
not for me.

514
01:12:21,854 --> 01:12:25,983
I smuggle, yes.
I smuggle gold, diamonds...

515
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:27,818
cigarettes, pistachio nuts...

516
01:12:27,902 --> 01:12:30,488
but no heroin.

517
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,950
Sit down.
That I leave to him...

518
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:37,411
when he is not too busy
working for Russia...

519
01:12:37,495 --> 01:12:39,205
against my country and yours.

520
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,123
My country awarded him the King's Medal.

521
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:44,961
Yes, I know.
But other people died for it.

522
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:47,922
During the fighting in Crete,
he was a double agent.

523
01:12:50,675 --> 01:12:53,427
King's Medal.

524
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,973
I would laugh
if my heart was not so heavy...

525
01:12:57,056 --> 01:12:58,766
about my poor Lisl.

526
01:13:00,852 --> 01:13:03,855
What does Kristatos gain
by setting you up?

527
01:13:03,938 --> 01:13:07,400
Well, I know too much about him.

528
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:10,027
He wants me out of the way.

529
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:15,741
By using a British agent
to do his dirty work for him...

530
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:18,077
your government might
give him another medal.

531
01:13:18,953 --> 01:13:22,874
- Why should I believe you?
- I'll prove it to you tonight.

532
01:13:22,957 --> 01:13:25,668
We'll go together to his warehouse...

533
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:29,088
in Albania, okay?

534
01:13:29,964 --> 01:13:32,341
If I don't report in by morning...

535
01:13:32,383 --> 01:13:36,470
not only my people, but the entire Greek
police will be down on you...

536
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:37,930
like a load of bricks.

537
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,849
Don't worry.

538
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:43,352
By tomorrow,
we'll be good friends.

539
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,732
Let us drink to that.

540
01:13:47,815 --> 01:13:50,151
I'll wait till tomorrow.

541
01:14:01,454 --> 01:14:04,165
You may need this.

542
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,460
I'm a good judge of men.

543
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:12,507
Mr. Bond, you have
what the Greeks call tha'ros.

544
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,133
Guts.

545
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:17,553
So have you, Mr. Columbo.

546
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,188
Cheers.

547
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,919
Santos' drug store.

548
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:30,186
Watch it.

549
01:16:46,077 --> 01:16:47,703
J.I.M. Diving equipment...

550
01:16:47,787 --> 01:16:50,748
for salvage work
at depths of over 300 feet.

551
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:08,266
- Raw opium.
- An old smuggler's trick.

552
01:17:08,349 --> 01:17:10,893
Kristatos knows them all.

553
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:56,230
Get your men out of here.

554
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,732
Now.

555
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:03,733
You left this with Ferrara,
I believe.

556
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:23,211
Had no head for heights.

557
01:21:53,259 --> 01:21:56,971
Where did the St. Georges sink?

558
01:21:57,013 --> 01:22:00,016
We can't be sure for certain.
We know it was in this vicinity.

559
01:22:00,057 --> 01:22:03,853
Your father was
using the temple as a front.

560
01:22:03,895 --> 01:22:06,147
Kristatos killed your father...

561
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:09,066
so he wouldn't find
the St. Georges before he did.

562
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:13,821
Kristatos.
How can I help?

563
01:22:13,905 --> 01:22:17,241
Where does your father
keep his daily log?

564
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:19,160
Daily log.

565
01:22:19,202 --> 01:22:23,831
Father and he were pals for 30 years.
He repeats everything.

566
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:29,921
- Give us a kiss.
- What's his name?

567
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:32,340
Max.

568
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:33,841
Thank you.

569
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:37,178
Hello.

570
01:22:40,973 --> 01:22:42,892
It's all shorthand.

571
01:22:42,934 --> 01:22:46,938
He used a special kind.
Only I could decipher it.

572
01:22:51,108 --> 01:22:54,070
He made several surveys in Neptune.

573
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:56,447
- What's Neptune?
- Our two-man submarine.

574
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:01,786
He saw a diving bell here.

575
01:23:01,869 --> 01:23:03,204
Diving bell?

576
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:07,083
Oil exploration. Kristatos.

577
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:13,130
Three days later,
he sighted a wreck in the same area.

578
01:23:14,215 --> 01:23:16,092
And?

579
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:17,885
That was his last entry.

580
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:20,930
The day he was killed.

581
01:23:20,972 --> 01:23:26,310
Air would be useless at this depth.
We need a mixture of oxygen and helium.

582
01:23:26,394 --> 01:23:28,354
I have the necessary equipment.

583
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,941
The less people that know,
the better.

584
01:23:32,984 --> 01:23:35,987
I'll give the crew shore leave
except for the mate and two others.

585
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:37,864
Let's go.

586
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:07,495
584 feet.

587
01:25:07,537 --> 01:25:13,292
An oxygen-helium mix will give us
eight minutes. We'll have to work fast.

588
01:25:13,376 --> 01:25:16,671
Wouldn't the crew have destroyed
the transmitter?

589
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:19,257
Only if they'd had the chance
to set the explosive timer.

590
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:54,333
We have a visitor below.

591
01:26:01,674 --> 01:26:04,719
Conserve your gas supply.
Speak only when necessary.

592
01:26:56,562 --> 01:26:58,606
I hope he was dining alone.

593
01:27:23,673 --> 01:27:25,299
Go back to the sub.

594
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:27,176
No, no. I'm staying.

595
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:40,481
That should be the command cabin.

596
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:04,172
Eureka!

597
01:28:13,472 --> 01:28:15,057
"Main destruct timer...

598
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:18,436
under lever right of ATAC housing,
dualled...

599
01:28:18,519 --> 01:28:23,232
by ring main circuit
through anti-handling charger. "

600
01:28:23,316 --> 01:28:25,776
The destruct timer's set
at one minute.

601
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:28,488
For some reason,
the lever wasn't pulled.

602
01:28:34,827 --> 01:28:37,538
The transmitter
with a thermite charge.

603
01:28:54,013 --> 01:28:56,057
Hold these.

604
01:28:57,558 --> 01:28:59,310
"To bypass trembler switch...

605
01:28:59,393 --> 01:29:02,772
cut wires in following procedure. "

606
01:29:04,398 --> 01:29:05,650
Cutters.

607
01:29:25,628 --> 01:29:26,963
Screwdriver.

608
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:46,607
That's it.
Let's get out of here.

609
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:13,509
James, help!

610
01:30:51,005 --> 01:30:53,841
- James, I won't make it.
- We both will.

611
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,431
Get to the sub.
I'll stall him.

612
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:24,594
Try and close the CO2.

613
01:34:24,677 --> 01:34:26,429
I'm trying.

614
01:35:55,768 --> 01:35:59,564
Careful, James.
It's 5,000 years old.

615
01:36:38,352 --> 01:36:39,979
Thank you, Mr. Bond.

616
01:36:40,062 --> 01:36:42,398
You have saved us
the trouble of disarming it.

617
01:36:42,482 --> 01:36:46,027
Apostis, take that.

618
01:36:48,154 --> 01:36:49,864
Where are my men?

619
01:36:49,947 --> 01:36:52,033
You will be joining them.

620
01:36:52,116 --> 01:36:54,619
Let the girl go.

621
01:36:54,702 --> 01:36:56,829
We'll double
whatever you're getting.

622
01:36:56,913 --> 01:37:00,082
I never go back on a deal.

623
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:03,044
It would be bad
for my reputation.

624
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:22,897
I will deliver it
and return with the money.

625
01:37:22,939 --> 01:37:28,528
The voice of the KGB. Our agreement
was that I designate the meeting place.

626
01:37:28,611 --> 01:37:31,948
After they pay,
I will give them the transmitter.

627
01:37:31,989 --> 01:37:35,201
It must not be let out of your sight.

628
01:37:35,284 --> 01:37:38,913
Nor mine. Where are we going?

629
01:37:38,955 --> 01:37:40,998
We will take the ATAC
to St. Cyril's.

630
01:37:41,082 --> 01:37:44,585
St. Cyril's.
I'll arrange the pickup.

631
01:37:51,092 --> 01:37:56,597
Bind that wound.
We don't want blood in the water yet.

632
01:37:56,681 --> 01:37:58,057
Murderer.

633
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:02,228
You have shot your last bolt,
Miss Havelock.

634
01:38:06,649 --> 01:38:08,776
Leave their legs free.

635
01:38:08,818 --> 01:38:09,986
They'll make appetizing bait.

636
01:38:19,996 --> 01:38:21,873
I didn't think it
would end like this.

637
01:38:21,956 --> 01:38:23,958
We're not dead yet.

638
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:52,028
Hold tight.

639
01:39:17,345 --> 01:39:19,555
Turn around. We go again.

640
01:39:24,894 --> 01:39:26,312
Take a deep breath.

641
01:40:22,743 --> 01:40:24,120
Again. Hurry.

642
01:41:13,503 --> 01:41:15,546
Help!

643
01:41:17,465 --> 01:41:18,799
Aw, leave him.

644
01:41:21,928 --> 01:41:24,347
Turn. Run them down.

645
01:41:41,572 --> 01:41:42,782
Follow me.

646
01:42:26,576 --> 01:42:31,414
Ahh. The sharks have them.
Make port.

647
01:42:54,103 --> 01:42:55,605
Thank you.

648
01:42:55,688 --> 01:42:57,106
Hello.

649
01:43:00,276 --> 01:43:03,905
- Give us a kiss.
- Max, not now.

650
01:43:03,988 --> 01:43:06,741
Kristatos is still alive.

651
01:43:06,782 --> 01:43:10,453
And probably headed
to Moscow or Havana by now.

652
01:43:10,536 --> 01:43:12,580
We'll never get him.

653
01:43:12,663 --> 01:43:14,123
Or the ATAC.

654
01:43:14,165 --> 01:43:16,125
ATAC to St. Cyril's.

655
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:33,911
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

656
01:44:33,995 --> 01:44:37,331
That's putting it mildly, 007.

657
01:44:37,373 --> 01:44:40,835
Your signal sent Whitehall into shock.

658
01:44:40,877 --> 01:44:43,880
So far we have managed to locate...

659
01:44:43,963 --> 01:44:48,092
439 St. Cyril's in Greece.

660
01:44:48,176 --> 01:44:52,305
Heaven only knows to which one
Kristatos took the ATAC.

661
01:44:52,388 --> 01:44:55,850
I know a well-informed person
to contact about that, Q.

662
01:45:09,864 --> 01:45:13,117
St. Cyril's, where we used to hide
from the Germans.

663
01:45:13,201 --> 01:45:17,872
Only Kristatos would make an abandoned
monastery his personal retreat.

664
01:45:19,457 --> 01:45:22,001
My friend, I've been studying
this place...

665
01:45:22,084 --> 01:45:23,961
for just such an occasion.

666
01:45:25,254 --> 01:45:26,923
We'll split here, huh?

667
01:45:27,006 --> 01:45:31,135
Your best approach is on the right face,
away from the building.

668
01:45:31,219 --> 01:45:33,346
Then you will have to make towards
the shed on the left...

669
01:45:33,429 --> 01:45:36,974
which houses the basket
and the electronic winch.

670
01:45:37,058 --> 01:45:39,811
It can be operated
only from the shed.

671
01:45:39,894 --> 01:45:41,646
Good luck.

672
01:45:51,739 --> 01:45:53,366
Should have brought more people.

673
01:45:53,449 --> 01:45:56,410
- James is counting on surprise.
- But we are only five men.

674
01:45:56,494 --> 01:45:58,120
And one woman.

675
01:46:50,006 --> 01:46:51,966
Eighteen...

676
01:46:52,008 --> 01:46:53,551
nineteen...

677
01:46:53,634 --> 01:46:55,803
twenty.

678
01:46:55,845 --> 01:46:57,263
Fifty more.

679
01:46:57,346 --> 01:47:01,684
That's the pits! I'm supposed to
be skating in Oslo, in Innsbruck.

680
01:47:01,767 --> 01:47:03,519
Why are we in this creepy place?

681
01:47:03,603 --> 01:47:08,024
Our plans are changed. We are
going to live in Cuba for a few months.

682
01:47:08,107 --> 01:47:11,194
- Cuba!
- You can skate without distractions.

683
01:47:11,277 --> 01:47:12,528
I'll be your audience.

684
01:47:12,612 --> 01:47:17,033
What a drag.
I want to win the gold medal.

685
01:47:17,116 --> 01:47:18,201
We all want that.

686
01:47:19,076 --> 01:47:20,578
I know what you want.

687
01:47:20,661 --> 01:47:23,748
But you're too old for me.
I'm splitting.

688
01:47:24,665 --> 01:47:29,545
- You have poisoned her against me!
- Don't blow your top, Ari.

689
01:47:29,629 --> 01:47:33,341
- Leave her alone.
- I will deal with you...

690
01:47:33,382 --> 01:47:36,344
as I deal with everyone who betrays me.

691
01:47:45,603 --> 01:47:47,688
Bibi...

692
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:49,690
you're so young.

693
01:47:51,234 --> 01:47:53,402
You must have a sponsor.

694
01:47:53,486 --> 01:47:55,404
I'll find another one.

695
01:47:55,446 --> 01:47:57,198
Go outside and check the guards.

696
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,368
Let me know when the helicopter arrives.

697
01:53:14,599 --> 01:53:16,767
One of Kristatos' killers.

698
01:55:59,972 --> 01:56:01,390
- Aah!
- Shut him up.

699
01:56:06,687 --> 01:56:08,648
Get the door.

700
01:56:13,736 --> 01:56:17,114
Come on, George. Let's go.

701
01:56:18,908 --> 01:56:21,953
Hurry, unless you want me
to go without you.

702
01:56:22,036 --> 01:56:24,539
You know,
I will never leave you.

703
01:56:27,875 --> 01:56:30,670
Your general is late.

704
01:56:30,711 --> 01:56:33,256
Only bad weather would delay him.

705
01:56:47,436 --> 01:56:49,564
Cover the windows.

706
01:56:49,647 --> 01:56:51,732
Let's go.

707
01:56:51,816 --> 01:56:53,860
He's all right. Leave him.

708
01:57:01,617 --> 01:57:03,327
He's all right.

709
01:57:03,411 --> 01:57:05,204
Back!

710
01:57:13,629 --> 01:57:15,214
Okay. Let's go.

711
01:57:16,382 --> 01:57:19,010
I'll be with you.

712
01:57:19,093 --> 01:57:20,052
Sorry.

713
01:57:32,565 --> 01:57:34,984
Cover the door!

714
01:57:35,067 --> 01:57:37,862
Where's Kristatos?
And keep your voice down.

715
01:57:37,945 --> 01:57:41,407
We are leaving him.
He mustn't know until we're gone.

716
01:57:41,449 --> 01:57:43,075
We'll help you if you help us.

717
01:57:45,786 --> 01:57:47,205
Come.

718
01:57:58,549 --> 01:58:00,259
Where are the guards?

719
01:58:00,343 --> 01:58:02,094
That way.

720
01:58:02,136 --> 01:58:04,096
Wait here.

721
01:58:53,771 --> 01:58:55,690
Move!

722
01:58:58,651 --> 01:59:02,238
- Where's Kristatos?
- The other side of the courtyard.

723
01:59:02,321 --> 01:59:04,824
You better stay here.

724
01:59:13,166 --> 01:59:15,793
What have you done to Brink?

725
01:59:15,877 --> 01:59:18,379
- Go back to your room!
- You can go to hell!

726
01:59:51,245 --> 01:59:53,581
Drop it.

727
02:01:15,788 --> 02:01:17,540
- Where's Kristatos?
- He's left with the ATAC.

728
02:01:29,719 --> 02:01:31,804
You're going to pay for it.

729
02:01:31,846 --> 02:01:34,682
You're not as fast
as you used to be.

730
02:01:47,195 --> 02:01:49,322
No, Melina,
that's not the answer.

731
02:01:50,698 --> 02:01:52,283
We'll turn him over
to the Greek police.

732
02:01:52,366 --> 02:01:54,327
Out of my way, James.

733
02:01:55,244 --> 02:01:57,205
All right...

734
02:01:57,246 --> 02:01:59,832
but be prepared to dig
those two graves.

735
02:02:37,286 --> 02:02:39,622
That's detente, comrade.

736
02:02:39,705 --> 02:02:42,416
You don't have it.
I don't have it.

737
02:03:15,908 --> 02:03:18,494
It seems as though Bibi
has a new sponsor.

738
02:03:29,005 --> 02:03:30,715
- How's it going?
- I've patched through...

739
02:03:30,798 --> 02:03:33,050
a high security line
to the satellite.

740
02:03:33,134 --> 02:03:34,802
We can try Bond now.

741
02:03:34,886 --> 02:03:36,929
Good. Are you through to Number 10?

742
02:03:36,971 --> 02:03:39,098
Standing by, sir.

743
02:03:43,144 --> 02:03:44,854
You know what I'd like?

744
02:03:46,439 --> 02:03:48,691
I can't imagine.

745
02:03:48,774 --> 02:03:50,943
A moonlight swim.

746
02:03:55,156 --> 02:03:56,782
007, are you there?

747
02:04:07,084 --> 02:04:08,628
Bond, are you there?

748
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:13,633
For your eyes only, darling.

749
02:04:19,514 --> 02:04:22,099
- He's there.
- Patch in the prime minister.

750
02:04:26,270 --> 02:04:28,189
I'll get it, Denis.

751
02:04:31,067 --> 02:04:32,151
Hello.

752
02:04:32,235 --> 02:04:34,403
Mr. Bond on the line,
Prime Minister.

753
02:04:34,487 --> 02:04:36,572
Ah, Mr. Bond...

754
02:04:36,656 --> 02:04:40,993
I wanted to call you personally
to say how pleased...

755
02:04:41,035 --> 02:04:44,622
we all are that your mission
was a success, thank you.

756
02:04:44,705 --> 02:04:46,040
Thank you, thank you.

757
02:04:46,082 --> 02:04:50,670
Don't thank me, Mr. Bond.
Your courage and resourcefulness...

758
02:04:50,711 --> 02:04:53,214
are a credit to the nation.

759
02:04:53,297 --> 02:04:56,092
Denis and I look forward
to meeting you.

760
02:04:56,175 --> 02:04:57,844
Meanwhile, if there is anything
I can do for you...

761
02:04:57,927 --> 02:05:00,555
Give us a kiss, give us a kiss.

762
02:05:00,638 --> 02:05:03,683
Well, really, Mr. Bond.

763
02:05:03,724 --> 02:05:06,352
I think we're having
a little trouble with the line, madam.

764
02:05:07,395 --> 02:05:10,690
You idiot.
Get on to him.

765
02:05:10,731 --> 02:05:13,442
007. 007.
