1
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,702
Here they come.

2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,114
Hi.

3
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,348
Hi, Kate.

4
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,783
Hi, Anne.

5
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,420
Here, let me take that.
I'll get that out of your way.

6
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,687
- Kate?
- Hi, babe.

7
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,357
Oh, look at this.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,459
No, don't do that.
It's for tomorrow.

9
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,128
Well,
for him there's no tomorrow.

10
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,463
Jack, control yourself.
Please.

11
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:03,431
Hey, what are you doing?

12
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,100
I waited 20 minutes in
line for that. Come on.

13
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,236
All right. Give me
some of that. Come on.

14
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,871
Are we all here?

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,706
Yeah. Let's go.

16
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,657
Hey!

17
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,694
The guy is
going away for a weekend

18
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,164
and he's bringing
his whole wardrobe.

19
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,467
Be careful.

20
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,172
Don't worry
about the eggplants.

21
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,839
I got five of them.

22
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,175
You got five eggplants?

23
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,776
What do you mean,
the baby ones?

24
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,512
Baby ones?
They're like salamis.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,847
13 eggplants.

26
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,816
Isn't that kind of a lot?

27
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,186
You can never have
too many eggplants.

28
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,687
-Hi, how are you?
-Hi.

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,222
Claudia's at her studio.

30
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,457
Turn left on Christopher,
right on Hudson.

31
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,594
Hey,
what happened to the bread?

32
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,796
What is this,
you started without me?

33
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,201
Need help?

34
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,668
I'm okay.

35
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,437
Hi, Claudia.

36
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,439
Hi.

37
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,540
Hi, Claudia.

38
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,342
You brought your work.

39
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,344
I stopped my work
for the weekend.

40
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,179
Danny, please.
You're a dentist.

41
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,280
Do you hear this?

42
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,916
I can sculpt a bicuspid
that would fool God himself,

43
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,851
but I'm just a dentist.

44
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,416
Do we...
Do we have any ginger?

45
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,586
I got two pounds of
ginger and a pound of garlic.

46
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,788
Anne,
didn't you have a tree there?

47
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,291
- Yeah, but we just...
- We had to cut it down.

48
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,493
I miss it. You could
see it from the bedroom.

49
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,860
Hey, we have locks, right?

50
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,463
Two locks.
A big lock and a little lock.

51
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,265
Oh, I love those flowers.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,667
I forgot my cleaver.

53
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,669
That's all right,
I got a cleaver.

54
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,004
Would you believe this?

55
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,573
They've been organizing
this one meal for two weeks?

56
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,008
I believe it.

57
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,678
God, look at that.

58
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,014
Wait a minute.
Look at this.
How did you trace this?

59
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,317
What do you do,
throw them up in the air?

60
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,651
I took a piece of glass

61
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,686
put the vegetables on
the glass, and I got...

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,788
Wait.
That's... That one I want.

63
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,524
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?

64
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,891
Is this the way this goes?

65
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,992
Yes.

66
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,361
It looks like a face.

67
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,729
It does looks like a face.

68
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,431
The nose, the eyes, the ears.

69
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,533
Did you try
the Pegasus Gallery in SoHo?

70
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,568
Yes. I just...
I can't believe that man.

71
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,539
I just... I told him
that I had been working

72
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,308
on this series of
pictures for three years,

73
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,677
and do you know what he said?

74
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,079
He said, "Three years
photographing vegetables?

75
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,549
"Don't you think that's
a little constipated?"

76
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,684
Do you believe that?

77
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,354
Well, that all
depends on the vegetables.

78
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,392
What you
gonna do with the cover?

79
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,960
Take it off.
Please take it off.

80
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,563
The chili pepper's cooking.
They have to be charred.

81
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,997
Okay. It will be charred.

82
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,666
Oh, come on.

83
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,439
Cook or laugh, what is this?

84
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,342
Well, do something with it.
Pour water on it.

85
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,411
Pour water on hot oil.
You're kidding, right?

86
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,580
My eyes are tearing.
I can't see what I'm doing.

87
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,748
We're gonna have
chopped knuckles
and hot garlic sauce.

88
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:15,949
-Here, here.
-I really can't see.

89
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,586
Wait. Come here, come here.
How is that? Is that better?

90
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,753
Oh, terrific.

91
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,655
You rubbed it in real good.
I'm blind.

92
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,724
The oil's not hot enough.

93
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,726
Then why have I
lost my eyesight?

94
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,960
It's not hot enough.

95
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,731
You cannot cook Chinese food
unless the oil is 480 degrees.

96
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,367
-Oh, damn.
-It's a scientific fact.

97
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,768
Did Einstein say that?

98
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,838
Newton. Isaac Newton.
The inventor of Mu Shu Pork.

99
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,542
-Hey, Anne?
-Mmm-hmm?

100
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,444
The magazine is doing a piece

101
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,480
on the top 10
executives in the country.

102
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,549
How would you like to
photograph them for us?

103
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,884
Oh, God,
I'd love to be in Fortune.

104
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,887
When do you need them?

105
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,022
By July.

106
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,626
You mean of this year?

107
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,761
Anne,
that's two months from now.

108
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,963
Yes, dear, I know that.

109
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,698
I just...

110
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:05,899
I don't work that fast.

111
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,503
Anne, how are you ever
going to get published?

112
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,704
You have to move.

113
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,872
What's the matter with you?

114
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,043
Just do a story on
the top 10
broccoli in the country.

115
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,911
Chicken salad.
You got the rice things?

116
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,682
Do it now
and they'll all be
ready at the same time.

118
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,484
I've got this timed
out scientifically.

119
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,585
Yes, sir.

120
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,653
Watch this.
Watch this. You ready?

121
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,954
Yeah. Watch out.

122
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,422
Watch this. Here we go.

123
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,925
Isn't that beautiful?

124
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,527
That's incredible.

125
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,795
Okay. First course.

126
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,737
And Chinese beer.

127
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,506
Bravo!

128
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,607
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

129
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,709
Thank you.

130
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,143
Did you leave out the MSG?

131
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,979
No MSG.
Grab your sticks and eat.

132
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,547
Here's some rice.
Pass it around.

133
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,516
Wait, wait.
Start with the appetizers.

134
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,084
That's the chicken salad.

135
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,954
Oh, my God, Danny.
That's fantastic.

136
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,856
Wait. Pass it around!

137
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,559
Danny's my genius!

138
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,695
The shrimp is incredible.

139
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,963
Okay. I have a toast.

140
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,700
Toast. To Nick and Anne.

141
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,934
Yeah.

142
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,104
And to this dinner
which is wonderful.

143
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,640
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

144
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,744
And to the reason
we're here tonight.

145
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,979
Not just to
celebrate your anniversary,

146
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,916
but to that deeper thing
that brings us
all close together.

147
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,020
To what bonds us, and...

148
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,789
And makes us huddle against
the cold winds of divorce

149
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,058
that have blown through
the lives of our friends.

150
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,126
Oh, that's lovely.

151
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,228
- Really nice.
- Nice, nice.

152
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,496
Thanks, Jack.

153
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,597
May I say something?

154
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,732
Yes.

155
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,266
I just wanna say that I...

156
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,002
That was the most
depressing goddamn toast

157
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,638
that I have ever
heard in my life.

158
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:52,840
Why? Why?

159
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,141
What's wrong with that?

160
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,275
He got to the heart of it.

161
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,944
He faced it.
He told us his fears.

162
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,579
That's why we're here.

163
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,280
That's why I'm in analysis,
you know.

164
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,616
It's not why
I'm eating dinner.

165
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,984
Well, I think he's right.

166
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,553
That's what
brought us together.

167
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,821
I don't get this close
with all my patients.

168
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,623
We didn't meet through you.

169
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,858
-Sure we did!
-Oh!

170
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,059
We did! We did!

171
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,460
Didn't I do some
legal work for you?

172
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,296
Then we all got to
know one another,
started going out together.

173
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,566
No. I remember going
over your statement.

174
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,934
We did not meet
through the men at all.

175
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,236
No. They think everything
revolves around them.

176
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,706
Anne is absolutely right.

177
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:26,674
You and I,

178
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,242
we met at a women's
photographers exhibition

179
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,312
and then Anne and I
met Claudia at an art gallery.

180
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,182
You didn't get at their teeth
until months later.

181
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,050
Uh, we met seven years ago.

182
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,052
It was the third week...
Thank you.

183
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,754
The third week in July.

184
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:45,258
And my first appointment
with Danny was,
uh, for a filling.

185
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,061
It was, uh, September 8,

186
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,665
and it was a Wednesday.

187
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,100
How can you remember that?

188
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,335
Oh, uh,
I remember things like that

189
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,938
because I feel
they're important.

190
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:01,041
Look, the point is
what brings us together.

191
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,843
- Right. That's the point.
- Right?

192
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,044
That's the point.

193
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,214
We owe the depth, breadth
and height of this friendship

194
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,950
to the world's
most ancient emotions,

195
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,120
fear and panic.

196
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,023
Am I right? Am I right?

197
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,357
-I love you.
-Am I right?

198
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,292
Listen, I spent
three hours buying this

199
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,361
and four hours chopping
it into little pieces.

200
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,764
I'm not just gonna eat it,
I'm gonna make love to it.

201
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,265
You keep talking.
I'll eat yours.

202
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,869
Wait. Come on. Cut it out.

203
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,208
Come on,
he's down in the orchard.

204
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,210
I... I can't get this
damn fender straightened.

205
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,311
I'll see you down there.

206
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,713
Yeah.

207
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,300
Hey, you look great.

208
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,002
Don't get too close.
Watch your foot.

209
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,036
Come on. I'll race you.

210
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,739
I'm going fast enough.
I just wanna dry my hair.

211
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,808
Come on.
We'll see who gets
to the house first.

212
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,043
Let's just see if
we can get there.
How about that?

213
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,211
Hey, you want a helmet?

214
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,313
Of course I want a helmet.

215
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,285
Oh, that's better.
That's nice.

216
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,790
Hey, Danny!

217
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,758
Hey! You wanna race?

218
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,893
No.

219
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,728
Come on.
Let's race a little.

220
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,429
Look,
leave me alone, will you?

221
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,131
You look great on that thing.

222
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,933
Come on.
What do you say?

223
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,068
I don't wanna race!

224
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,037
Good. You ready?

225
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,338
Go!

226
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,947
Go, Danny. Go! Go! Go!

227
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,688
Whoa!

228
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,423
Watch out! Watch out!

229
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,332
I won!

230
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,938
I won!
I did it! I did it! I won!

231
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,340
I won! I won!

232
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,475
What happened?
Are you all right?

233
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,244
Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?

234
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,747
I am the greatest!

235
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,315
The sexy dentist won!

236
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,851
I won!

237
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,454
Danny, you're wonderful!
I love you!

238
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,232
Hey, how about
Indian food next time?

239
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,434
We can...
We can make our
own mango chutney,

240
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,203
we can fry a little chapati.

241
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,373
How about Indonesian?
We could do
a whole rice table.

242
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,875
Oh, yeah. That will be great.

243
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,076
I'd love that.

244
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,779
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- I think I got it.

245
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:52,846
What?

246
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,981
It's 1:00.

247
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,315
Homemade pasta...

248
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,383
Yeah?

249
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,985
...Florentine chicken...

250
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,452
Mmm-hmm.

251
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,354
...on a...
On a bed of spinach.

252
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,722
Oh, yeah.

253
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:08,295
And a hot antipasto of mussels
in marinara sauce.
How about that?

254
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,830
Is that good?

255
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,833
Danny, please. I'm Italian.

256
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,068
Oh, you don't think
we can do it, huh?

257
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,537
Didn't we make
a great Chinese
meal last night?

258
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,973
Yeah. Well,
look, we're not Chinese.
You know?

259
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,209
By us it was Chinese.
What do we know?

260
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,345
Danny, please. She's Italian.

261
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,313
Yeah.

262
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,548
I can make a better
sauce than your mother.

263
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,017
My poor mother has arthritis.

264
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,952
Of course you make
a better sauce than her.

265
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,553
Before her arthritis.

266
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,025
Will you guys shut up?
You're depressing the birds.

267
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,160
How's your leg?

268
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,394
Oh, fine.

269
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,431
I've been banged up so many
times I hardly even notice it.

270
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,567
In college he played
football with a broken wrist

271
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,438
and then two big
guys picked him
up and threw him on his head

272
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,473
and he was
unconscious for three hours.

273
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,943
Those were the days.

274
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,180
Hey. Hey.

275
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,549
Listen to the water
lapping against
the sides of the boat.

276
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,321
To be with
friends sipping wine,

277
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,190
this is what it
is to be happy.

278
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:13,460
This,
and being incredibly rich.

279
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,135
I'm a lifetime member
of Equitable's
Million Dollar Roundtable.

280
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,470
Give me some cheese, will you?

281
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,906
I'm one of the most
successful estate
planners in New York.

282
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,474
But that's nothing
compared to this.

283
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,043
Nick, please.
I wish that you would relax.

284
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,179
Please. He's always selling.

285
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,947
What are you talking about?

286
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,582
You're an estate planner?

287
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,017
You're an insurance salesman.

288
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,618
I don't plan estates?

289
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm not on
the Million Dollar Roundtable?

290
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,858
Oh. Do you know what you get
for being in
the Million Dollar Roundtable?

291
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:45,993
-What?
-What?

292
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,095
A plastic
statue and a weekend,

293
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,464
a weekend
at the La Cucaracha
Hotel in Puerto Rico.

294
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,338
What are you doing?

295
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,606
I'm gonna make a toast.

296
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,041
Again? Not another one?

297
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,110
Here's to us.

298
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,078
Here's to apple trees,

299
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,447
to cheese...

300
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,515
Here's to cheese?

301
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,219
...and wine and
friends and laughter,

302
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,587
and life itself.

303
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,656
That's beautiful. Sit down.

304
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,292
Carefully.

305
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,129
Oh, shit.

306
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,096
What, again?

307
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,198
I don't want to let
this afternoon disappear

308
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,134
without something
to remember it by.

309
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,369
Some memorial of our
affection for one another.

310
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,437
Yeah. Terrific.

311
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,305
But just don't
wave your arms, okay?

312
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,243
This is for all of you
so that we'll
never forget this day.

313
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,577
Yeah.

314
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,453
I don't believe it!

315
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,421
What are you
doing in the lake?

316
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:53,426
All right. I accept that
gesture from my friend.

317
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,129
He's not gonna be
alone in doing it.

318
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:02,069
My only regret is that
I'm not wearing my $500 suit.

319
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,212
I'll just jump
in with my bread.

320
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,021
Hey, uh...

321
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,388
Hey.

322
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,391
You all right?

323
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,559
Sure.

324
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,262
You look distracted.

325
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,697
I'm okay.

326
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,103
You know,

327
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,073
I think we're close enough to
say anything to each other.

328
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,543
Really. Anything.

329
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,021
You and Kate happy?

330
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:31,591
Yeah. Very.

331
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,362
I mean, happy.

332
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,198
Can you honestly say
you're really happy?

333
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,302
Yeah, but not every minute.

334
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,639
It comes in waves.

335
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,777
At times you hit lows
and you can't stand
things about each other.

336
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,813
Like the way her
teeth click when she eats.

337
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,316
The way I smell my sweatshirt
before I put it on.

338
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,785
Sometimes we drive
each other crazy.

339
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,489
And then there are times

340
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,626
we go through a period
like the one we're in now.

341
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,729
It comes over us
like an unexpected wave,
puppy love.

342
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:11,831
I can't wait to see her.

343
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,734
And then when I'm with her
my heart beats faster.

344
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,838
I'd expect it with
somebody who's a stranger,

345
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,174
but not somebody I've
spent half my life with.

346
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,276
It's wonderful.

347
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,677
I wish I could feel that.

348
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,514
Oh, you will. It'll come back.
Just give it time.

349
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,216
No. I've never felt it.

350
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,227
I shouldn't have married Anne.

351
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,864
I was crazy as a kid.

352
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,201
I figured
she'd be some kind
of stability for me.

353
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,340
Well, she certainly is stable.

354
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,444
I mean, she's a decent woman,
she's a good mother,

355
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,113
but she doesn't do anything.

356
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,815
Doesn't think anything.

357
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,719
I've never heard one
stimulating idea come out of
her mouth ever.

358
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,489
When she took up photography,

359
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,692
I thought, finally
she's gonna do something.

360
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,662
She spent three years
photographing vegetables.

361
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,499
She's not just stable,
she's inert.

362
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,601
So work on it with her.
Talk to her about it.

363
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,804
Jack, I've tried for 20 years.
I get nothing.

364
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,876
Do you know how painful it is
to want to love someone?

365
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:35,182
You've no idea how
lonely I've been.

366
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,423
Look at her. Look at her.

367
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,196
She gets
obsessed with things.

368
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,398
She'll pace up and
down all day long

369
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,500
with the same thought,
turning it over and over

370
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,567
in her head.

371
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,669
She remembers the day
she got her tooth filled.

372
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,206
Can you remember that?

373
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,309
Christ. I can barely remember
the first time I got laid.

374
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,413
I come home from
a day's selling,

375
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,914
she wants to
talk about her work.

376
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,350
Fine. You know
what she talks about?

377
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,751
Vegetables.

378
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,554
For a year and a half
we talked about zucchini.

379
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,556
Then for a year,
green peppers.

380
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,657
That was a nice change.

381
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,463
Last night was
the end of 21 years.

382
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,566
And that's enough.

383
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,601
Today's the beginning
of a new life for me.

384
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,370
What?

385
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,439
That's it. It's over.

386
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,976
You can't just quit.
What... What are you...

387
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,612
What are you talking about?
What's the matter with you?

388
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,315
I want to make a new start.
I want a new family.

389
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,683
What about your old family?

390
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,853
Lisa's 18.
She can handle this.

391
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,489
I want a woman I
can be excited by.

392
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,660
You've got
somebody else, don't you?

393
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,027
You got somebody
waiting in the wings.

394
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,265
No, I don't. I swear I don't
have anybody
waiting in the wings.

395
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,267
Why are you making
this so difficult for me?

396
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,235
I thought I could
tell you anything.

397
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,377
How can you
just throw her away
after 21 years like this?

398
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,512
I mean, what is she
supposed to do now?

399
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,350
Oh, boy.

400
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,023
I thought if I told you,
you'd be happy for me.

401
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,826
I even had this fantasy that
you'd handle the divorce.

402
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,930
That I would
handle the divorce?

403
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,567
In the first place,
I'm not a divorce lawyer,

404
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,470
and if I were,
I'd probably represent Anne.

405
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,406
I can't believe
you would do this.

406
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,041
Jack, please.

407
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,312
This is the hardest thing
I've ever gone
through in my life.

408
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,483
All right. I'm sorry.

409
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,258
Oh, God.
Nick, this is awful. Jesus.

410
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,071
Come on, let's go.

411
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,043
Want some more of these?

412
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,045
Oh, yes.
Thank you. Good, good.

413
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,916
You know,
beans are very
much misunderstood.

414
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,520
They have a complex
set of amino acids.

415
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:31,358
If you eat beans
together with rice,
you never have to eat meat.

416
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,560
Danny loves to
talk about beans.

417
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,962
Go ahead, sweetheart. Talk.

418
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,665
It's the combination that
counts.
Here, you want some of these?

419
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:39,599
Yeah, I do.

420
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,568
You know, I've been
thinking about that.

421
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,769
About what?

422
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,804
Photographing
vegetables in combinations,

423
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,507
not just one at a time.
You know?

424
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,612
I'm not sure yet.

425
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,984
Hey, I did some research
on sailboats for the summer.

426
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,085
That's great.

427
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,052
Already?

428
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,622
We only talked about
it a couple of days ago.

429
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,891
I got it in here someplace.
Here it is.

430
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,459
Nick,
you ought to check this out.

431
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,727
You're
the sailor in the group.

432
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,529
Where did you
get all this stuff?

433
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:10,863
Called a couple
of boat brokers.

434
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,098
- No kidding.
- Let me see one.

435
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,701
We can rent one in St. Thomas
and sail around the islands

436
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,903
and fly home.
The whole thing
will take two weeks.

437
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,971
This woman's fantastic.

438
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,573
Nick, isn't this beautiful?

439
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,908
I'd just love a boat.

440
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,476
Oh, is that the galley?

441
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,611
Yes.

442
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,678
And you know what?

443
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,947
I think it looks... It
looks a little small to me.

444
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,048
Gorgeous.

445
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,216
Yeah, right.

446
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:33,152
Oh, I...
I think we'll manage
very well, don't you?

447
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,688
Oh, I think it's beautiful.

448
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,356
Oh, look at that.

449
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,386
Can't you sleep?

450
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,158
Nick is getting a divorce.

451
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,564
How do you know?

452
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,966
He told me yesterday when
we were getting firewood.

453
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,636
Jeez.

454
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,806
Is there somebody else?

455
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,678
He says there isn't.

456
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:35,181
Why does he have to leave her?
Why can't they fight it out?

457
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,125
Hold me?

458
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,800
Good morning.

459
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,708
You got up early.

460
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,176
Oh, God.
It's gorgeous down there.

461
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,178
-Yeah?
-There's this enormous turtle.

462
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,980
You didn't try to
ride him, did you?

463
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,283
Ride a turtle that big?
Are you kidding?

464
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,051
I was thinking of it,
but I got scared.

465
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,853
Oh. Good morning.

466
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,059
Hey,
could you sleep last night?

467
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:30,029
Not very well.
What is it with them?

468
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,199
I don't know, boy.

469
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,701
Oh,
I thought I smelled coffee.

470
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:35,935
Good morning, Danny.

471
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,937
Thank you.
Good morning. How are you?

472
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,273
It's great.

473
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:44,276
Oh, my God. Daylight.

474
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,647
Claudia thinks she's seasick.

475
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,815
Are you?

476
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,016
No.

477
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,151
I'm just trying out
this new green makeup.

478
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,120
Claudia, you're not nauseated.

479
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,088
Danny, how come
you're allowed to have

480
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,957
all these
psychosomatic illnesses,

481
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,660
but when I throw up
into my tote bag at
2:00 in the morning,

482
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,729
it's just my imagination?

483
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,865
Did anyone sleep last night?

484
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,035
You're kidding, right?

485
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,705
With all those mating calls
coming from
the master bedroom?

486
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,806
All night long.

487
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,241
I mean, who could have guessed

488
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:16,976
that it would
be so distressing

489
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,611
to listen to
other people humping?

490
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:19,712
Hi, gang.

491
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,047
-Good morning.
-Morning.

492
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,251
What a morning!

493
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,622
Oh, boy, smell that air. Huh?

494
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,990
Yeah.

495
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,025
Now, this is how
the whole world should live.

496
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,126
Uh-huh?

497
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,628
I slept like
a baby last night.

498
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:36,763
Wasn't that a great night?

499
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,331
Oh, yeah. It was great. Yeah.

500
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,034
Wasn't it peaceful
bobbing around on
the water like that?

501
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,403
Yeah, well, some parts of the
boat bobbed more than others.

502
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,240
Hey, honey, throw on
your suit and come on up!

503
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,608
Coffee's on.

504
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,080
- Hi!
- Good morning.

505
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,381
Good morning.

506
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,750
Did anybody hear anything
about the weather?

507
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,852
Oh, yeah, did you
listen to the radio yet?

508
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,187
Yeah,
it's supposed to be clear.

509
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,656
What do you
say after breakfast,
we head for St. Croix?

510
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,425
Wait a minute.
You wanna move the boat?

511
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,161
Come on,
once you get used to it

512
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,430
you'll be
the most intrepid
sailor of the bunch.

513
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,165
I don't see how
we're gonna go anywhere

514
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,901
unless we can
get the anchor up.

515
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,736
-Well, we'll just pull it up.
-Pull it up?

516
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,805
Isn't that why we had
to stay here last night,

517
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,873
because we couldn't
pull the anchor up?

518
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:24,343
Nah, if the three
of us give it a yank,
it'll come up. Come on.

519
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:29,181
You boys go pull on
your anchor for a while.
We'll be back here.

520
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,251
If that anchor comes up
out of the water,
there is no God.

521
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,022
Nick just amazes me.

522
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,290
I mean, he's so accomplished.

523
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,427
He can sail.
He knows how to choose wines.

524
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,062
Do you know that
he's just about

525
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,297
the most successful
estate planner in New York?

526
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,432
Is that so?

527
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,566
Yeah.

528
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,903
He's a life member in
the Million Dollar Roundtable.

529
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:53,005
I hear they send you
to Puerto Rico for that.

530
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,941
Oh, yeah.
He goes all over the place.

531
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,778
We met on my flight to L.A.

532
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:02,214
I sat with him
for an hour after
the dinner service and...

533
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,416
God,
I had just never met anybody

534
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,786
who knew so much
about actuarial tables.

535
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,087
He's a charmer.

536
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,756
Yeah.

537
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,960
How about Danny?
Has he been sailing long?

538
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,230
No.

539
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,967
Well, how about Jack?

540
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,503
Jack saw Two
Years Before
The Mast  when he was 12.

541
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,973
One, two, heave ho!

542
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,908
Come on.
We're not gonna make it.

543
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,777
This is like
pulling a building.

544
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,912
Okay. Come on.
Danny, watch your foot.

545
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,113
Watch out. Watch out.

546
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,414
It's stuck on something.

547
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,483
There's a big plant
down there or something.

548
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,518
I'll run her over.
Tell me when it's vertical.

549
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,888
-You're gonna what?
-I'm gonna
start up the engine.

550
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,190
You tell me when this rope
is straight up and down, okay?

551
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,225
Do you know what
the hell he's talking about?

552
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,397
Hey.

553
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,531
What?

554
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,800
Maybe we
shouldn't go anywhere.

555
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,535
Everybody's worried
that we don't know
what we're doing.

556
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,537
I know what I'm doing.

557
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,507
Hey, your nose is getting red.
You better put
something on it.

558
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,943
Well, I just think that
if anybody's nervous about it

559
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,812
we should stop
and talk about...

560
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,514
What is this?

561
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:10,950
I don't know. Open it up.

562
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,351
Oh, my God.

563
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,791
Shalimar?

564
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,894
Oh, my God.

565
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,396
You are the sweetest man.

566
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,868
Look at this.

567
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:33,806
He's given me a present
every single day
since we left St. Thomas.

568
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,508
You could make me
fall in love with
you pretty easily.

569
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,812
You mean it could get worse?

570
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,315
Excuse me.

571
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,986
Okay. I'm gonna move
her up. Tell me when.

572
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,393
More, more, more.

573
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,829
More, more.

574
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,799
More, more, more, more...

575
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,369
Hold it.

576
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,273
Thank you.

577
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,076
You don't have to worry about
the anchor anymore.

578
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,210
Come here.

579
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,244
You want us down there?

580
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,612
Yes.

581
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,981
At that end of the boat?

582
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,850
Come here and ready this sail.

583
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,385
Come on, Ollie.

584
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:23,089
They're really gonna move it.

585
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,957
I doubt it.

586
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,225
Okay,
what do you want us to do?

587
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,393
I want you to
raise the mizzen.

588
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,527
I'll close the lid.

589
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,262
Close the lid,
we'll kill ourselves.

590
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,363
Close the hatch.

591
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,631
Where will I stand?

592
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,867
Right there.
Just pull on the rope
like we did yesterday.

593
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,268
-I got it. I got it.
-Like yesterday.

594
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:37,970
Okay.
I got the ribbons out here.

595
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,305
- Ribbons?
- The gaskets.

596
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,406
I'm pulling the ropes.

597
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,874
-Okay.
-Okay?

598
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,245
There she goes!

599
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,016
Jack!

600
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,217
Oh, my God!

601
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,318
Here. Grab that.

602
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,321
Are you all right?

603
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,989
What the hell are
you trying to do?

604
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,391
Here, take this line.

605
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,260
Oh, my God. The boat's moving.

606
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,361
What? What?

607
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,495
Turn the wheel.

608
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,297
Not on my boat.
Don't touch anything!

609
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,033
Turn the wheel.

610
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,438
Jesus Christ!

611
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,474
You go ahead, folks.
I'll catch up.

612
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,309
What's that?
I think we're stuck.

613
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:19,145
She's gone aground.
We're on a sandbar.

614
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,046
On the ground?

615
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,914
We're stuck.
Yeah. Look at that.

616
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,182
Oh, shit.

617
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,684
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

618
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,086
Sorry.

619
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,157
I'll just get
these into the water.

620
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,558
Oh, Jesus! They're so dirty.

621
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,692
Look, my lettuce water.

622
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,694
I gotta clean them.

623
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,933
Oh, now, wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute, No salt, okay?

624
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,101
Just put the salt

625
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,436
on the sides
of whoever wants to
poison themselves.

626
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,938
He doesn't eat salt.

627
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,073
Salt is bad for you?

628
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:49,708
I haven't used salt
or mucus
products for three years

629
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,477
and I feel just great.

630
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,112
Who eats mucus?

631
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,480
He means cheese and milk.

632
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,216
Danny, say what you mean,
will you please?

633
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,584
You're talking to humans here.

634
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,320
Don't worry about it, Danny.
This recipe
doesn't call for mucus.

635
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,588
- Excuse me.
- Got a knife?

636
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,123
Where's a knife?

637
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,092
Excuse me.

638
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,061
I think I'm gonna
die from the sun.

639
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,330
Why does my nose
always have to bother me?

640
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,731
Here,
Danny, let me get in here.

641
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,202
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

642
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,336
Here you go. You put this...

643
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,570
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What?

644
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,607
You're not gonna put
that green,
thorny thing on my nose.

645
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,076
For God's sakes.
You take the jelly out of it.

646
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,478
It's an aloe plant.
It'll make it just fine.

647
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,314
What?

648
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,482
You stabbed me
with that
goddamn Hawaiian plant.

649
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,617
Be careful.

650
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,185
I'm sorry.
It's crowded in here.

651
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,387
Excuse me.
Would you excuse me, please?

652
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,489
I'm doing the best I can.

653
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,358
Well,
don't put it in my lettuce.

654
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,993
Okay.

655
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:45,597
Jack and Kate owe Nick and me
$123 each for provisions,

656
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,600
except for the wine and beer
which Nick brought,

657
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,537
which everybody
owes him $47 each for.

658
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,040
Why don't we just subtract
the $47 from the $123?

659
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:57,576
No, no, no, no, no.
That's gonna screw it up.

660
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,012
I've worked this
out very carefully.

661
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:03,649
And I'd just like to
tell you that we are now

662
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:07,653
$350 over budget each.

663
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,021
All right, all right.

664
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,489
I don't see any trip
to St. Croix

665
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,124
unless we have
a meeting first.

666
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,560
I don't picture us seeing
St. Croix unless it floats by.

667
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,673
I can't believe
he brought her.

668
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,541
How could he do that to Anne?

669
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,677
How could he do it to us?

670
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,280
But she's really nice,
you know.

671
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:35,347
I mean, I like her.

672
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,283
She's wonderful.

673
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,750
I can't even enjoy hating her.

674
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,786
Who the hell needs that?

675
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,723
Danny is driving me crazy.

676
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,558
He has to be
the expert on everything.

677
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:47,793
What's the matter with him?

678
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,428
He's very needy. That's all.

679
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,297
Needy?

680
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:55,434
He's hypochondriacal,
stingy, bossy, selfish,

681
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,805
compulsive and paranoid.

682
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,707
He's the Muhammad
Ali of mental illness.

683
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,309
Shh. Quiet.

684
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:12,718
Look, if they don't want me
to keep the finances, I won't.

685
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,720
But there's
something wrong with them.

686
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,456
These people are vicious.
They're ill.

687
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,359
We're traveling with
a group of ill people.

688
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:24,330
I just can't believe
that he would bring
her on the boat with us.

689
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,466
Every time I
make a suggestion,

690
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:30,436
every time I say something
they're ignorant of,

691
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,438
do you see the way
they look at each other?

692
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,340
They discuss me
behind my back.

693
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,875
I mean, she walks around
with that hanky on her hips

694
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,478
that's supposed to
be a bathing suit.

695
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,113
Oh, God.

696
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,515
I get so depressed
every time I look at her.

697
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:48,220
These people are vicious.
Vicious and ill.

698
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,864
I don't believe it.
They're at it again.

699
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,437
They never stop.

700
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:08,540
Those two are
gonna kill themselves.

701
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,228
They're driving me crazy.

702
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,533
Talk about something else.

703
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,668
Something serious and complex.

704
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:38,570
We won't even...
We won't even notice it.

705
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:39,738
All right. Okay.

706
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,273
- Something serious.
Okay, go ahead.

707
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:42,674
Something serious and complex.

708
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,810
Tell me about
the Simmons suit.

709
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,278
The, uh, Simmons suit.

710
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,413
The Simmons suit.

711
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,580
Yeah. Okay.

712
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,385
The Simmons suit.

713
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:55,687
Well, it all depends how
the judge interprets...

714
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,256
...the, uh,

715
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,225
environmental impact study.

716
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,662
Oh, yes.

717
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,981
Part of
the problem with inflation

718
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,285
is that the production
of goods and services...

719
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:27,686
...per man hour of work

720
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,688
is falling at
a rate of 3% a year.

721
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,790
What is she doing to him?

722
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,559
You're not listening.

723
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,294
Now, will you just listen?

724
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:39,665
If productivity falls 3%,
then wages have to fall 3%.

725
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,999
Are you listening?

726
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,472
Then the cost of
production rises.

727
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,384
What goes up must come down.

728
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,694
So...

729
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,761
Again.

730
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,597
Oh, no, not again!

731
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,906
I can't take anymore of this.

732
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,834
Do you want some breakfast?

733
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:53,505
I'm too sleepy to eat.
Those people are killing me.

734
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:56,642
I'm gonna make some coffee
and see if I can wake up.

735
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:59,845
Maybe if I lie in the sun
I can go back to sleep.

736
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,693
Oh, my God.

737
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,501
What?

738
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,438
Down here. Quick.

739
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,008
Oh, my God.

740
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,543
Is the coffee ready?

741
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:33,979
I can't get my eyes
open this morning.

742
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,548
Maybe this'll
get your eyes open.

743
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,887
They're swimming
already?
Where do they get the energy?

744
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,088
Keep looking at them.

745
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,391
What am I supposed to see?

746
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,927
A-ha.

747
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,402
What's the matter?
Is everybody sick?

748
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,904
Come here, come on.

749
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:05,477
Oh, my God.

750
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,948
You know, when you
really think about it,

751
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,784
there isn't
anything sexual about it.

752
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,720
It's natural.

753
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:19,024
People go to their
doctor's offices,
they take off their clothes,

754
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,892
it doesn't mean a thing.

755
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:23,795
Meanwhile, he hasn't
taken his eyes off
her for a second.

756
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,065
I almost got you.

757
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,500
Hi!

758
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,635
Hi!

759
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,537
-Hi.
-Hi.

760
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,008
Oh, they're swimming over.

761
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,444
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh, Lord.

762
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,145
Just act casual.

763
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,080
What you mean, like you?

764
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,482
I'm gonna make breakfast.

765
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,083
I don't wanna look
at my friends naked.

766
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,486
It makes it hard
to have dinner
with them later.

767
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,521
Yeah. I'm gonna go
sit in the shade.

768
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,390
And I think,
maybe, I'll read a book.

769
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:58,063
Okay, Danny, we've
all got something to do.

770
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,998
What's everybody
getting so crazy about?

771
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,600
You can't see anything.

772
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,134
Then what are you
standing there for?

773
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,804
He's hoping she'll turn over
and do the backstroke.

774
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:09,441
I was just enjoying
their playfulness.

775
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:10,976
They're like
a couple of porpoises.

776
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,912
It's a pure animal pleasure
of having fun, that's all.

777
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,915
Danny, will you,
for Christ's sake, sit down?

778
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:22,821
What's the matter
with this woman?

779
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,456
Huh! Shit.

780
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,833
Hold it. Okay, hold it there.

781
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,035
Now give me a hand with this.

782
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,605
Okay. Here we go.

783
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,776
- Okay, Danny, start the winch.
- Crank it up.

784
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,115
Okay.

785
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,550
That's it.

786
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,719
Kate, make sure
that tail line is taut.

787
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:56,688
All right,
come on, keep going. Heave!

788
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,726
Keep cranking.
Keep cranking.

789
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:01,927
All right, Ginny,

790
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,929
I wanna put a little
more pressure on it.

791
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,163
Hoist that sail.

792
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,732
Okay!

793
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,069
That's it.

794
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,804
-Danny.
-Yeah?

795
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:13,872
That's it, darling.

796
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,741
Now put a little
muscle into it.

797
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,015
Haul it away.
That's it.
That's it. That's it.

798
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,618
That's it!

799
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,521
Yeah, yeah. It's working!

800
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,722
-Terrific!
-It's working!

801
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,130
Yes! Yes!

802
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,672
Where the hell are they going?

803
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:48,173
Hey, wait for us!

804
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,042
Claudia! Claudia, back it up!

805
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,310
We're headed out to sea!

806
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,079
Isn't this terrific?

807
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,881
Put it in reverse!

808
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:39,057
Okay, tell me when.

809
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,259
Good, good. Thank you.
Thanks, honey.

810
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,964
Why do you think we
love this boat so much?

811
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,599
I don't know.

812
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:52,904
Do you know why I think
we like this boat so much?

813
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:53,972
-I knew it.
-What?

814
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,340
I knew it.

815
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:58,209
He only asked us so he could
tell us his theory.

816
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,144
Oh, come on.

817
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,179
Go ahead. Go ahead,
sweetheart, tell us.

818
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,248
Why do we love
this boat so much?

819
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:06,852
Because it represents
our primeval
desire to control water.

820
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,586
Ah. See?

821
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,122
No, think about it.

822
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,959
All our beginnings are wet.

823
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:18,897
Sloshing around in the womb,
baptism,

824
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,400
first life that came from
the warm soup of the ocean.

825
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,937
From the moment
we rose from
the slime as alligators,

826
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,373
we've been trying for
dominion over water.

827
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,010
You know?

828
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,845
Mmm-hmm?

829
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:39,017
Jack loves ideas
and he can do so
much with them.

830
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,653
I have seen him take
one idea at a dinner party

831
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:43,755
and bring the conversation
of a dozen people

832
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,090
to a complete halt.

833
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:49,360
Ladies and gentlemen.
Clams Casino.

834
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:53,431
Oh, my God. I love them.

835
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,768
I have this insatiable need
to have
dominance over the clam.

836
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:57,903
Take forks.

837
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:58,870
It so happens

838
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:02,173
that Venus rose from
the sea on a clam shell.

839
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:05,010
Sexuality was born in wetness.

840
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,778
It's easier that way.

841
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,217
Hey.

842
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,019
Mine's all closed up.

843
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,821
How'd that happen?

844
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:17,155
-I don't know.
-Open it.

845
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:21,659
Lodge your finger in it.
Right.

846
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:26,331
Oh, Nick.

847
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,333
That must be some clam.

848
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,403
Look what he gave me.

849
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,940
What a guy.

850
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:36,474
I'm beginning
to feel left out.

851
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,679
Hmm. You got something, too?

852
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:43,949
Sand!

853
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:45,817
-Oh!
-Oh, Jack.

854
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:49,187
That's all right.

855
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,825
I'm gonna go down
below for a few minutes.

856
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:03,301
I think I'll see
if she's all right.

857
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:11,009
Do you think
they're gonna do it again?

858
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:16,147
You know,

859
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,850
I'm real pissed off at him
for what he did to Anne,

860
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,218
but I have to tell you,

861
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,088
I get a funny feeling

862
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,456
watching two people
who are that much in love.

863
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:30,028
How do you
suppose we lost that?

864
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,798
We didn't.

865
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,801
Just 'cause they're bumping
into
the furniture and we're not,

866
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,769
that doesn't mean
that we've lost interest.

867
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:41,039
Is he still thoughtful?

868
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,542
Yes, Jack is thoughtful.

869
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,444
Does he observe good
bathroom etiquette?

870
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,745
Like what?

871
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:50,415
Well, like does he
leave the seat up or
does he put it down?

872
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:53,018
It's funny how people tend to
forget little
things like that.

873
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:55,353
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're not talking about me.

874
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,889
-I always put the seat down.
-Sure, after I yelled at you.

875
00:45:57,923 --> 00:45:59,557
Do you know how
many times in the dark

876
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,927
I've fallen that extra
inch onto the porcelain?

877
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,796
Anyway, I don't find
them all that adorable.

878
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,932
They're making
this trip very difficult.

879
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:09,000
They're not even on this trip.

880
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:11,569
They walk around
mooning all the time
making goo-goo eyes.

881
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,940
My God, if one of them farts,
the other thinks
it's Guy Lombardo.

882
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,576
I think it's kind of nice.

883
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,445
I don't know. I...

884
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:24,349
I want us all to
feel like we did before.

885
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:25,483
Hmm.

886
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:29,320
I wanna feel like them.

887
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,133
God, I love that woman.
She just kills me.

888
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:58,984
Honey?

889
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:11,963
What?

890
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:15,967
It's not the same anymore.
Everybody's different.

891
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,168
Have you noticed that?

892
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,603
Yeah.

893
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,238
What is it?
Is it me or something?

894
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,606
-No.
-Are you sure?

895
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,041
You're not doing anything.

896
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:24,842
You're a little
jealous of Nick.

897
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:26,644
No, I'm not.

898
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,778
Sure you are.

899
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:30,148
I'm not. What are you...
What are you talking about?

900
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:33,251
Look, honey,
it's only natural.

901
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:36,521
Look, she's a beautiful,
young, adoring woman, right?

902
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,822
Yeah.

903
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,258
And she believes
every single thing he
tells her about himself.

904
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,360
Now, it's only natural
for you to want that.

905
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,462
Well, but I... I'm jealous?

906
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,164
-You preen for her.
-I do not.

907
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,365
You do, too.

908
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,134
-I don't.
-Jack.

909
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,668
Come on. You walk around here

910
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,938
you're holding in your
stomach all the time.

911
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:55,073
You... You shave.
You comb your hair.

912
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,542
Well, I...
No, I think you've
misinterpreted something.

913
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,510
-No, now, excuse me, I...
-Look, forget it.

914
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,046
Enjoy your fantasies.

915
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,948
I don't have any
fantasies about her.

916
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:05,350
-Yeah?
-Well, no serious fantasies.

917
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,187
Well, you know, for somebody
who likes to get to
the heart of things,

918
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,290
you have this incredible knack

919
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,559
for denying your own feelings.

920
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:17,095
-You wish I were
jealous of him.
-Why?

921
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,264
'Cause that would alleviate
what you feel about her.

922
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,566
-Hey, you're getting angry.
-No, no, no. I'm not. No.

923
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,669
If you're angry,
would you do me
a favor and just be angry?

924
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:26,071
I am not angry.

925
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:27,272
Don't start
with the analyzing.

926
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,373
I am not angry!

927
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:32,177
And you're not clenching
your teeth either, right?

928
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,179
Okay, all right,
that's a problem I have.

929
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:36,514
Sometimes when I get angry,
I... I analyze.

930
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,416
You certainly do.

931
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,951
You know why I do that?

932
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:42,153
I don't care why!

933
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:44,322
Look, you got a little
hate going there, right?

934
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:47,392
-Admit it.
-I am not angry
and I don't hate,

935
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,294
so just shut up
about that, okay?

936
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,198
Come on, shut up.

937
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,101
Stop.

938
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,070
Will you slow down?

939
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,671
Do you know
where the brake is?

940
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,306
We got plenty of time.

941
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,409
You don't understand
the soul of a car like this.

942
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,810
It was born for speed.

943
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,545
I'm in complete control.

944
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,314
What are we
cramped up in here for?

945
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,083
We could've used
their station wagon.

946
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:20,485
A station wagon is a car.

947
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,421
A Mercedes is a thoroughbred.

948
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,589
Every so often,

949
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:27,092
it needs to be taken out
on the open road
and challenged.

950
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,559
-Want some?
-Yeah, I'd love a bite.

951
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:29,694
-Don't eat!
-What?

952
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,196
-Don't eat!
-Why?

953
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:32,697
The crumbs go down
in the upholstery.

954
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,265
You'll never get it out.

955
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:36,601
The car will look like
the bottom of a bird cage.

956
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,835
Isn't that crazy?

957
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,204
I'm starving.

958
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:40,471
One loaf of French bread

959
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:43,174
and the resale
value goes down $500.

960
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:46,511
You wanna
eat a $500 sandwich,
it's up to you.

961
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,746
How about if I just
eat the insides for $1?

962
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:07,332
Can you make it?

963
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:09,134
Claudia,
once we find our kids,

964
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,601
why don't you and
Danny drop us off?

965
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:12,470
Then you can go
see Mike at Wesley.

966
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,539
We'll see him tomorrow.
It's Saturday night.

967
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,474
He's probably out
trying to get laid.

968
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:20,111
What makes you think
your son's always
doing something sexual?

969
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:21,746
Please, I'm Italian.

970
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,314
Hi! There she is!

971
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:25,816
Bethie!

972
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,385
Hi, guys.

973
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:28,653
Hi!

974
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,222
God, you look great.

975
00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:32,357
Hi!

976
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,524
-Hello, honey.
-Hi.

977
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:35,360
-Hello.
-Hi.

978
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:36,861
Lisa's down there somewhere.

979
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:38,163
Where?

980
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,664
Down there.
Come on, I'll show you.

981
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,766
Guess what?
I got an "A" in History.

982
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,403
And this teacher
is such a jerk,
you wouldn't believe it.

983
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,472
He wouldn't even tell
us what to write about.

984
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:49,507
I had to figure
the whole thing out by myself.

985
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,210
You don't think he was trying
to get you to think for
yourself, do you?

986
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,778
No, Mom, no.
This guy is really a jerk.

987
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,781
If the jerks had their own
country,
this guy would be president.

988
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,318
There she is. Lisa! Lis!

989
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,220
I'll... I'll go get her.
Hold on, will you?

990
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:03,254
Wait right there.

991
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,322
Okay.

992
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,823
Oh, God, she's wonderful.

993
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,426
That kid sure
takes a real bite out of life.

994
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:11,329
Hiya, babe.

995
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:12,497
Hi, Dad.

996
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,632
Hi. You look great.

997
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,567
Hi, Lisa.

998
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:17,702
Hi.

999
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,470
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hi.

1000
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:20,605
It's good to see you again.

1001
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,673
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hi.

1002
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:23,941
Doesn't she look good?

1003
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,810
Oh, you look terrific.
Just great.

1004
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,245
Thanks.

1005
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,814
Oh, I have a present for you.

1006
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:30,948
Right.

1007
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,751
Yeah.
I'll... I'll go get it. Okay?

1008
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:36,421
So, you're getting enough
sleep,
and food and everything?

1009
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:37,555
You look just great.

1010
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:38,823
Thanks.

1011
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,291
Can you have
lunch with us now?

1012
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:42,293
We're gonna have
lunch at the Inn, okay?

1013
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,229
-Sure.
-You got a ride
over there, right?

1014
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:45,730
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with Beth in her car.

1015
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,565
-You know the way?
-Yeah, yeah, of course.

1016
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:50,601
There's a return slip,
if it's the wrong
size or anything.

1017
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:51,736
Thank you.

1018
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:52,837
See you later, Lisa.

1019
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,939
Okay, we'll see you later.
Bye-bye.

1020
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,307
See you later, girls.

1021
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:57,975
Bye-bye.

1022
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,710
Oh, boy, does she look great.

1023
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:01,846
You don't think she
looked a little depressed?

1024
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:02,913
Who? You mean Lisa?

1025
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:03,848
Yeah, Lisa.

1026
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,950
No, no, no, no.
She has a slow metabolism.

1027
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,486
That's up. She's up today.

1028
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,588
Maybe you should
have a talk with her.

1029
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:11,956
What's the matter
with you people?

1030
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,724
I tell you,
the kid is a survivor.

1031
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,693
Just a little talk.

1032
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,595
It'll make her
feel so much better.

1033
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:20,965
Okay.

1034
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,449
Do you lock it now or what?

1035
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:40,351
-You wanna hang
onto your purse?
-No.

1036
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:41,886
Got your purse.

1037
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,860
This is...

1038
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:51,896
Did you know Anne
is here this weekend?

1039
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,831
-Anne is here?
-Oh, no.

1040
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,433
-Are you sure?
-Beth told me.

1041
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,034
My God, how did that happen?

1042
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,305
Anne's grown up.
She can take it.

1043
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:02,273
What makes you think we can?

1044
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:03,908
Did you know she was coming?

1045
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,476
When I talked to her Tuesday,

1046
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,512
she said she was gonna
work it out with Nick.

1047
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:09,714
I called her when we said
we were coming up here

1048
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:10,981
just so this wouldn't happen.

1049
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,283
Well, I don't understand.

1050
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:14,519
Nick, you didn't tell her
you were coming
up here with Ginny

1051
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:15,886
and she didn't tell you?

1052
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,523
I don't know. She might have
mentioned she
was thinking of it.

1053
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:21,526
She never does what she says
she's gonna do.
She's very unreliable.

1054
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:23,027
I don't even listen
to her half the time.

1055
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,296
That might be a small
problem right there.

1056
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,332
You know,
I don't wanna talk her down

1057
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,066
but she is unreliable.

1058
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,001
I mean, Nick has
made three appointments

1059
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:33,971
to meet her down at
his lawyer's office
and she's never shown up.

1060
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,440
She hasn't even called.

1061
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:36,807
Now, wait a minute.

1062
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:40,077
No offense, Ginny,
but 21 years ago Nick
said he would be there

1063
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,714
on the other side of the bed
every morning and
for the last six months

1064
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:46,884
he hasn't kept his
appointment, either!

1065
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,653
Okay, uh, look...
Look, let's calm down.

1066
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:51,322
It's not all that bad.
It's just
a little embarrassing.

1067
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:52,957
I don't see what
the big problem is.

1068
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,426
We're all adults.

1069
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,328
We'll just say "Hello,"
and, uh...

1070
00:54:57,362 --> 00:54:59,430
Have a nervous breakdown.

1071
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,801
Ginny, I'm sorry.

1072
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:07,004
The... The... This...
There is a lot of
strain on the situation

1073
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,573
and I get
passionate sometimes.

1074
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:09,907
That's okay.

1075
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,711
I know you're just
trying to be
fair to everybody.

1076
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,481
You're the one I
wanted to make cry.

1077
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,818
Why do you have to
open up your mouth again?

1078
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,920
-Danny, it's over
and done with, please.
-Come on.

1079
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:24,755
Let's have a nice
quiet time, just once.

1080
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:27,458
-We're gonna have...
-All right,
let's get a move on.

1081
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,827
Shh. Please, not now.

1082
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,497
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

1083
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,365
-You sure?
-I'm okay.

1084
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,736
Do you have a reservation
for Callan, please?

1085
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,638
You're all registered,
Mr. Callan.

1086
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,441
I'm all registered?

1087
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,510
Mrs. Callan checked
in a few minutes ago.

1088
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,782
Everything all right?

1089
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:53,451
Oh, yeah,
everything's terrific.

1090
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:54,619
Do we have our rooms?

1091
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,753
Wait a minute.

1092
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:58,589
Uh, could I see you over here
for a minute, please?

1093
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:00,891
Could I see you over here
for a minute, please?

1094
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:02,026
What's the matter?

1095
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,630
As far
as I can make out,

1096
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:08,466
Anne has just
checked into our room.

1097
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,435
-Oh, no, I knew it.
-Oh, my God.

1098
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,404
Look, we can just
go someplace else.

1099
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:14,705
On Parents' Weekend,

1100
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,874
everything's booked
within 50 miles of here.

1101
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:18,843
Well,
then I'll sleep in the car.

1102
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,679
I could sit up all
night in the diner.

1103
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,949
Maybe the earth will
just open up and swallow me.

1104
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,453
Hi, everybody.

1105
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:29,520
Hi.

1106
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:31,856
Hi.

1107
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:32,957
Hi. How are you?

1108
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,024
I'm fine.

1109
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,193
Oh, that's a nice kiss.

1110
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,095
This is wonderful.

1111
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,431
You look gorgeous.

1112
00:56:40,465 --> 00:56:41,932
Thank you.

1113
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,934
It's great to see you.

1114
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,604
Uh, hi.

1115
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,712
-Did you see Lisa?
-No, I haven't yet.

1116
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,714
-Oh, she looks terrific.
-She does?

1117
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,783
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, good. I miss her.

1118
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:04,855
Hi. I'm Ginny.

1119
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,024
Oh, this is Ginny Newley.

1120
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:09,594
How do you do? I...
We've spoken on the phone,
I believe.

1121
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:11,428
Yes, I... I think we have.

1122
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,099
Okay,
I got that taken care of.

1123
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,503
Oh, hi, Anne, how are you?

1124
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,971
Fine, Nick, I'm fine.
How are you?

1125
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,507
I'm fine.

1126
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,244
Well, now that we
all know we're fine,

1127
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,514
is there anything else
we ought to talk about?

1128
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:33,250
Jack, don't, uh...
Don't try to get to
the heart of things,

1129
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,720
just let it lay there.

1130
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:37,888
Why are we all pretending
we're not embarrassed?

1131
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,890
Why don't we just
say how we feel?

1132
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,494
I feel, uh, like I wish you
would just sort of shut up.

1133
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:47,765
Okay.

1134
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,534
Lisa's on her way over here.

1135
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,068
I'm gonna have
lunch with her, okay?

1136
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:54,739
Okay. I'll...
I'll have dinner with her.

1137
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:57,241
-Fine.
-Fine.

1138
00:57:57,274 --> 00:57:59,109
More fine, good. That's great.

1139
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:01,812
Hmm.

1140
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:04,815
Listen, it's lovely to
see you all. It really is.

1141
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:06,584
Okay, goodbye.

1142
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:08,285
-Talk to you later, honey.
-Take care.

1143
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,020
It was very nice to meet you.

1144
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,922
Of course.
Thank you, Miss Newley.

1145
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,730
See, what was wrong with that?

1146
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,166
Claudia, come on.

1147
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:24,201
Do you have my room?
Dr. Zimmer?

1148
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,904
There won't be any more
Zimmers coming in, will there?

1149
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,673
Better not be.

1150
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,643
Anne?
Hold on. Wait a second, huh?

1151
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,812
Anne.

1152
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,748
God, that must've been
murder for you in there.

1153
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:38,816
I'll get used to it.

1154
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,719
Shall we talk? I have
a feeling we should talk.

1155
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:44,689
Well, uh...

1156
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:51,061
Actually I have the feeling

1157
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,097
that, um,
you're all deserting me.

1158
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,198
Deserting you?

1159
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:55,933
Yes.

1160
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:59,069
You had that,
uh, party on Labor Day,

1161
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:01,238
and you asked Nick but not me.

1162
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,874
Anne! That's
because he was with her.

1163
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:06,677
We couldn't invite you
both to the same party.

1164
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:08,078
We would've been
nervous wrecks.

1165
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,314
Anne, we love you.

1166
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:13,083
Uh, look, next week why
don't we have dinner?

1167
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:15,352
We'll...
We'll go see a movie. Huh?

1168
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,154
Good, I would like that.

1169
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:18,989
You know,
you're right, it's true.

1170
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,958
We've talked to you on
the phone a few times

1171
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,960
but in the last
couple of months,

1172
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,262
we have let you
drift out of our lives.

1173
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,865
Has it been really tough?

1174
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,669
Not bad.

1175
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:35,005
Actually,
um, it's been pure shit.

1176
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,275
But it could be worse.

1177
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:39,844
How do you get
through the day?

1178
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:41,111
I work.

1179
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:44,214
But I tend to, uh, lose track.

1180
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:47,317
I get on the bus and I
forget where I'm going

1181
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,887
and I watch the streets go by

1182
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,122
and I just hope to God

1183
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:54,959
that one of them will
remind me what I'm there for.

1184
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:58,328
Oh,
it's not as bad as all that.

1185
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:02,366
I've been trying to
get out of my rut.

1186
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:06,003
I am thinking

1187
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,873
about, uh,
uh, going to Czechoslovakia.

1188
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:11,041
Why?

1189
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:14,745
Because I've never wanted
to go to Czechoslovakia.

1190
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:17,147
And
it's something new,

1191
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:21,318
and I'm trying very hard,
you know, to be less,
uh, what, uh, compulsive.

1192
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,888
To be a little bit
more spontaneous.

1193
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:26,891
Last week, I bought a snake.

1194
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,194
You bought a snake?

1195
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:33,764
It felt kind of
strange at first, but, uh,

1196
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,033
once you get used
to him, he's lovely.
He's lovely.

1197
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,267
He's a nice pet.

1198
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,436
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1199
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:43,307
He's disgusting to start with
because he eats mice alive.

1200
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,746
You've really been through
the wringer, haven't you?

1201
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:53,183
Uh, I'm all right.
I really am all right.

1202
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:56,821
In fact, in some ways I think
I'm stronger than ever.

1203
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,323
The only thing is that

1204
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:02,059
every time I think about
going to Czechoslovakia

1205
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,028
I, uh... I start to cry.

1206
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:05,963
God, oh!

1207
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,937
I'll...
I'll stop by for Lisa later.

1208
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,706
And we're gonna
call you Monday
for dinner, okay?

1209
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,941
-Okay.
-Anne?

1210
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:18,075
What?

1211
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,409
Will you call
me at the office?

1212
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:21,812
Because I think I can
get an assignment for you.

1213
01:01:22,947 --> 01:01:24,014
I love you.

1214
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,217
Do me a favor

1215
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,954
and don't tell Nick
about the snake, all right?

1216
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,088
No.

1217
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:32,990
He thinks I'm crazy as it is.

1218
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,699
I'll tell you what.

1219
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,435
To hell with Nick.

1220
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:48,438
Tell him, uh, it's
a goddamn boa constrictor.

1221
01:01:57,782 --> 01:01:59,249
I don't understand him.

1222
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:00,985
How could he do that to her?

1223
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:03,387
He's got a long
history of doing that to her.

1224
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,091
He's been having affairs
with other women all along.
Dozens!

1225
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:08,325
Oh, you're kidding.

1226
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:11,228
How could you not know?

1227
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,497
They even slept at
your apartment once.

1228
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:14,531
Where was I?

1229
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,067
You gave him your keys
so he could feed your cat

1230
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:20,971
and water your plants
when you went
away for the weekend.

1231
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:23,273
Didn't you notice the funny
look on the cat's face

1232
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:24,842
when you came home?

1233
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,276
That son of a bitch.

1234
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:29,213
He told you all this?

1235
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,015
He told me some of it.

1236
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,417
Some of it came out
when he was under gas.

1237
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,852
I don't know.

1238
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:35,820
Jeez!

1239
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:38,255
I've lost all my
illusions about that guy.

1240
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:41,025
Every time I think about him
I get angry and depressed.

1241
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:42,492
I just can't
believe that of him.

1242
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:45,029
Ah, maybe it's
this time of the year.

1243
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:46,897
Always hated autumn.

1244
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:48,432
Everybody says
it's so beautiful

1245
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:51,501
but for me it's just...
Just another time of death.

1246
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,570
I always get
psoriasis in autumn.

1247
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,506
Danny, believe me,
you're not gonna
die from psoriasis.

1248
01:02:58,408 --> 01:02:59,509
What's that supposed to mean?

1249
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:02,479
I'm just trying
to comfort you.
Don't get paranoid.

1250
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:05,582
How come everyone
thinks I'm paranoid?

1251
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,918
You discuss this
behind my back, don't you?

1252
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:09,586
Danny, relax, would you?

1253
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,023
Come on, come on, I'm sorry.

1254
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:15,559
If you could just realize
what a terrific person you are

1255
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:17,928
you wouldn't think
everybody was out to get you.

1256
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:19,263
Don't try to analyze me, okay?

1257
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,530
First of all,
I'm not your patient.

1258
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:21,932
Second of all,
you're not a doctor.

1259
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,200
I'm just trying to help.

1260
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,202
Well, you're not helping,
you're patronizing me.

1261
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,336
-So cut it out, okay?
-Okay. Okay.

1262
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,872
Don't...
Don't get so overwrought.

1263
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,173
What can I do for you?

1264
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,541
Well, first of all,
you can take your
arm off my shoulder

1265
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:33,310
and stick it up your ass.

1266
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:42,052
Look, sweetheart,
I know what
you're going through.

1267
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:44,088
My parents separated
when I was a kid, too.

1268
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:45,990
I hated them for it.

1269
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,359
I promised myself
that when I grew up

1270
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:53,497
I'd remember what it was like
and never do
that to one of mine.

1271
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:57,367
Trouble is, now I see
it from the other side.

1272
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:00,004
But you've very
mature for your age.
You're resilient.

1273
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:03,607
This will pass
and in no time you'll
be singing and laughing.

1274
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,210
Believe me,
you're gonna be laughing.

1275
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:16,086
Look, your entire world
doesn't revolve around me.

1276
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,055
You've got your
own life to live.

1277
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,124
You've made some friends
at your dorm, right?

1278
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:21,491
Not really.

1279
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,260
Most of
the people I've met here

1280
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,995
have a peculiar
idea of a good time.

1281
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,896
Like what?

1282
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:30,234
They get drunk and
piss off the balconies.

1283
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,039
What about the girls?

1284
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:37,041
I'm talking about the girls.

1285
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,644
You're kidding me, right?

1286
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:42,212
I'm kidding you?

1287
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:44,114
You think it's a joke
to have to walk home

1288
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:46,516
on a clear night
with an umbrella?

1289
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:51,989
Haven't you got
any friends here?

1290
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,157
They don't interest me.

1291
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:55,459
Oh, come on.
There must be somebody.

1292
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,027
Hey!

1293
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,164
What about that
kid from, uh, Ohio?

1294
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,199
Yeah, Marilyn Oupenski.

1295
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,968
-Yeah.
-She was great.

1296
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:06,470
She was a lot like me.
A lot like me.

1297
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,306
Her parents made her go home.

1298
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:10,941
Why?

1299
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:13,077
She tried to
swallow a bottle of pills.

1300
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:16,513
Why didn't you tell me?

1301
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:17,714
What for?

1302
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,584
Lisa, if the one person
you identify
with in this place

1303
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,519
happens to swallow
a bottle of pills

1304
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:24,388
don't you think I'd
be mildly interested?

1305
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,323
You keep making
all these decisions

1306
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,158
that affect my life
without asking me.

1307
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:29,926
That doesn't
seem to bother you.

1308
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:34,531
You know what this is?
This is emotional blackmail.

1309
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:37,467
I'm trying to appeal
to your sense of
intelligence and maturity,

1310
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:40,971
you sit there like the
Bride of Frankenstein
talking about suicide.

1311
01:05:50,014 --> 01:05:51,681
Come on, sweetheart.

1312
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:55,986
You're not as morose as
all that and you know it.

1313
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,422
You got a great big smile
down there somewhere

1314
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,124
and you just won't let it out.

1315
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,692
Come on, give in.

1316
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:06,363
Let's have a nice big smile.

1317
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:10,100
I know you got one in there.

1318
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:13,270
I can see it sitting there,
dying to come out.

1319
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,174
Here it comes.

1320
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:20,510
I can see it curling up
at the corner of your mouth.

1321
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,246
Come on, here it comes.

1322
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,680
Here comes the smile.

1323
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,549
Smile, God damn it!

1324
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,456
All right, don't.

1325
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,528
I think you
should apologize to her.

1326
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,629
For what?

1327
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,398
I got excited,
I spoke my mind,

1328
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,533
I said I was sorry and
it's over and done with.

1329
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:45,569
I don't understand
how you can hurt someone

1330
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:49,406
as guileless and
vulnerable as Ginny.

1331
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:51,708
She sure took on a lot
of mystical qualities

1332
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,810
once you saw her
swimming naked.

1333
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,279
How can you say that?

1334
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:57,381
-I just say what I think.
-Mmm-hmm.

1335
01:06:57,414 --> 01:06:59,616
Well,
maybe that's the problem.

1336
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:02,819
Why do you always have to say
what you think?

1337
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,056
You think your thoughts
should just fall
down from your brain

1338
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,292
onto your tongue
like a gumball machine!

1339
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,760
Danny, I am not gonna
start watching what I think

1340
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:13,163
or what I feel! I am Italian!

1341
01:07:13,197 --> 01:07:14,198
I know you're Italian!

1342
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,633
I don't wanna hear anymore
how you're Italian!

1343
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,202
Wait. Wait, here.

1344
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20,704
Wait. Just wait, wait, wait.

1345
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:24,040
Hello out there!
This woman is Italian!

1346
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,110
All right!

1347
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:29,813
You no longer have to announce
your ethnic
origin in this state!

1348
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:32,516
Everybody in Connecticut
knows you're Italian!

1349
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,184
And when we cross the border,

1350
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:36,453
I'll take out an ad
in the New York Times.

1351
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,329
What's with him?

1352
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:46,830
I don't know.

1353
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:49,466
What's with you?

1354
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,370
I'm sorry. I just feel
very let down by you.

1355
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,771
Why? What have I done to you?

1356
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,207
What is your idea of a close
intimate friendship?

1357
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:58,475
What does that mean to you?

1358
01:07:58,508 --> 01:07:59,743
I don't understand.

1359
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,411
I've hurt you in some way?

1360
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:04,414
I happen to know you betrayed
your wife dozens of times.

1361
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:10,487
If I did,
that's what I did to her.
What did I do to you?

1362
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,356
You didn't tell either of us.

1363
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:14,124
Hey, wait a minute.

1364
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:16,226
Let's take you one at a time.

1365
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,295
You can understand my
not telling her, right?

1366
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:20,364
I can't understand you
saying on the one hand

1367
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:21,931
that you could
tell me anything.

1368
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:25,635
And on the other hand not
telling me a goddamn thing
except what suits you.

1369
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:27,837
I feel as
betrayed as she does.

1370
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:31,908
Jack, all I've ever gotten
from you is judgment
and disapproval.

1371
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,610
You expect me to
come and tell you

1372
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:35,845
every time I've had an affair
with a hatcheck girl?

1373
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,614
That's who you were
having affairs with?

1374
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:38,715
Hatcheck girls?

1375
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:40,217
No!

1376
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,919
They were all intelligent,
worthy women. The top
people in their field.

1377
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,188
I can't tell you
all their names,

1378
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:47,291
but two of them were
Margaret Thatcher
and Indira Gandhi.

1379
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:48,925
When you wanna talk
intelligently, I'll talk.

1380
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,760
Otherwise, forget it.

1381
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,564
When did you get this?

1382
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:55,932
Couple of weeks ago.

1383
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,501
Do you have any
good friends here?

1384
01:08:57,534 --> 01:08:59,569
Mmm-hmm, I like this.

1385
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:00,937
Who are your friends?

1386
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,272
People.

1387
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:03,307
Good.

1388
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:05,775
What about Lisa?

1389
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,477
Forget it.

1390
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:08,678
When you were in high school

1391
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:11,281
you used to be on the phone
with her almost every night.

1392
01:09:11,315 --> 01:09:12,416
Not anymore.

1393
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:13,717
What's the problem?

1394
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,453
She's such a bitch sometimes!

1395
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,389
She... She just gets...
I don't know.

1396
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:22,559
She says she'll
meet me someplace and
she doesn't show up.

1397
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:25,862
Sometimes she'll just
sit there for
an hour without talking.

1398
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,299
It's like she's trying
to test me and see
how much shit I'll take.

1399
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,735
-She probably is.
-I hate it!

1400
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,171
Hey, babe, come here.

1401
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:40,944
What if, uh...

1402
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,749
What if you just accepted her
for what she is, huh?

1403
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:47,251
I do.

1404
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,219
Trouble is,
what she is, is a bitch.

1405
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:50,587
Oh.

1406
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,456
When she acts like that,
maybe you...

1407
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:53,923
Maybe you could
just laugh at her.

1408
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,992
You know, like she was
a character in a story.

1409
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,994
-Mom, that's impossible.
-Why?

1410
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,797
Because it is. Forget it.
Change the subject.

1411
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,267
Okay.

1412
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:06,470
What other
friends do you have?

1413
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:10,274
Oh, stop it! Be quiet!
Time to stop talking now!

1414
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:12,876
I'm closing off your breath!
Here we go!

1415
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,478
This is so good.

1416
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,946
Mmm, I hope this is homemade.

1417
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,417
Just look at all
those calories.

1418
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,520
-Do you want a bite?
-Oh, God,
I got too much in my mouth.

1419
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:25,622
Thank you.

1420
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,457
You are such a slob.

1421
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:30,460
Okay. That's $23 from Nick,

1422
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:33,263
$24.50 from Jack
and $16 for me.

1423
01:10:33,297 --> 01:10:35,365
But let's split it three ways.

1424
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,367
Then why tell us
what everybody spent?

1425
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,769
Because if there's
a discrepancy in
anyone's share,

1426
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:41,671
it will benefit
everyone to know about it.

1427
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:44,374
How can I know what my share
was unless I
compulsively added up

1428
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:45,809
my bill the whole
time I was eating?

1429
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:48,512
Oh, now I'm compulsive.

1430
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:50,280
Ten minutes ago,
I was paranoid.

1431
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:51,815
Give me the check,
I'll pay it.

1432
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:56,286
I'm sorry. I'm not a member of
the Million Dollar Roundtable.

1433
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,688
You want the check?
Here, you got it.

1434
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:01,057
Come on,
you're a successful dentist.

1435
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,326
That's right.

1436
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,494
And this is
a checkup and cleaning.

1437
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:06,663
Takes me a long
time to scrape, polish,

1438
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:08,031
and poke in
order to make this.

1439
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,966
Hey, Danny, calm down.

1440
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,301
Please don't tell
me to calm down.

1441
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:14,438
This is the second time today
somebody's told
me to calm down.

1442
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:16,540
I'm sorry, it's only my first.

1443
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:18,708
If he wants to keep the books,
let him keep the books.

1444
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:19,976
I don't want to
keep the books.

1445
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,411
I'll pay the check.

1446
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,812
Again, I am not upset.

1447
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:23,913
Don't get upset.

1448
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:25,682
I told you, I was not upset.

1449
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,950
Here, you want the check,
take the check.

1450
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,686
I don't want the check.
I'm not upset.

1451
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,421
Don't get him upset, will you?

1452
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,657
I didn't get him upset!
You got him upset.

1453
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,492
I told you, I'm not upset.

1454
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,327
This is ridiculous.
Why do you...

1455
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:37,714
Oh, God.

1456
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:42,452
Oh, God.

1457
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,456
It really took
off a lot of skin.

1458
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,895
What are you doing?

1459
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,831
I've been out in the cold
all day and my skin is dry.

1460
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,968
I wonder if they have
any ice down the hall.

1461
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:01,137
Gee, I don't know.
Why don't you go see?

1462
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,140
Are you mad at me?

1463
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,208
You got it.

1464
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:09,245
You picked a hell of
a time to get irrational.

1465
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,115
Oh, I'm not irrational.
Rational people get angry!

1466
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:14,518
Irrational people
pretend they don't.

1467
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:16,119
Okay,
just stop it right there!

1468
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:18,822
I have a very bad temper!
Don't make me use it!

1469
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,089
Use it.

1470
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:23,026
I don't happen to think
there's anything
wrong with anger.

1471
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:25,228
I'm going to be
very calm about this.

1472
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:26,630
Why do you resent me?

1473
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:28,632
Because when you
fight you get calm.

1474
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:30,033
You don't like that?

1475
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:32,268
It drives me nuts.

1476
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,971
I also don't
like having to
guess your every need

1477
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:36,773
when you don't give
a damn about mine.

1478
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,274
I don't like that a lot!

1479
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,910
What needs do you have
that I don't
give a damn about?

1480
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:44,280
Don't you ever feel
like going
someplace alone with me?

1481
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,683
You want to take
a vacation without them?

1482
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:49,886
I have this perverse desire
to be married to
one person at a time.

1483
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,621
I don't know, it excites me!

1484
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:53,523
I thought...
I thought you liked them.

1485
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:57,694
I adore them,
but it's getting
so I can't breathe!

1486
01:14:57,727 --> 01:15:00,163
Anne doesn't know
how lucky she is to be out!

1487
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:01,765
You know,

1488
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:03,867
Danny probably
has his ear pressed

1489
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,869
to that door listening
to everything you're saying.

1490
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:08,938
Danny dear,

1491
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:11,541
please don't be offended.
You know how fond I am of you

1492
01:15:11,575 --> 01:15:14,177
but I think your
Mercedes sucks.

1493
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,045
You the one who
organizes these trips.

1494
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:17,781
And I hate it.

1495
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,749
Doesn't it ever occur
to you that sometimes

1496
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:21,651
I'd like to be
the one with the sore knee?

1497
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,086
No.

1498
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,689
You handle everything
like three of the most
efficient people I know!

1499
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:27,190
Uh, nobody can do what you do.

1500
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:29,025
My God, you're perfect.

1501
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:30,927
How dare you call me that?

1502
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,596
-How dare I call you perfect?
-Yes.

1503
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:33,897
Yes, isn't that what I heard?

1504
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,600
What's wrong with perfect?
How can you get
upset about that?

1505
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:40,737
Because when I'm perfect,
I cease to exist!

1506
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:43,072
You... You don't
have to hug me when...
When I'm low.

1507
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:45,775
You don't have to cheer me up
with a bunch of $2 daffodils.
Nothing!

1508
01:15:45,809 --> 01:15:47,577
I don't surprise
you with daffodils?

1509
01:15:47,611 --> 01:15:49,345
You know I do. You know I do.

1510
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,014
When you feel like it!

1511
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:54,317
When it makes you feel good,
but not when I need them!

1512
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:57,721
Goddamn it!
I'm standing here bleeding!

1513
01:15:57,754 --> 01:16:00,690
Blood is running down my leg
and we're talking
about daffodils!

1514
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:03,259
Because I also resent you
for hurting yourself.

1515
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,327
Oh, oh, oh.

1516
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,229
And that's not irrational,
huh?

1517
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:08,732
You think I like to see
you so jealous of Nick

1518
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:10,333
that you feel you
have to tackle him?

1519
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:12,669
You think that
makes me feel good?

1520
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:17,240
I think we should get
to the heart of this.

1521
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:18,808
The heart of this

1522
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:21,611
is that you wish you
had some blonde nymph

1523
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:23,012
adoring you like he does.

1524
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:24,748
So go on! Go find one!

1525
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:28,251
Christ, how long you going
to hang on to these fantasies?

1526
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:31,020
The reality is you're married
to a middle-aged woman

1527
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:33,222
with a good sense of
humor and dry skin!

1528
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:36,826
And if you don't like it,
then go find yourself a nymph.

1529
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,828
Just do me
the courtesy of telling me.

1530
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:41,297
In other words,
and I mean this in
the most loving way,

1531
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,199
shit, or get off the pot!

1532
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,939
Katherine,
I'm sorry to say this.

1533
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:52,008
What? Say it!

1534
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,943
You're making me furious.

1535
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:56,913
You're furious now?

1536
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,214
I'm enraged.

1537
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,984
How can you tell?
I can't see the difference!

1538
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:03,853
Maybe you could learn
to stamp your
foot as a signal.

1539
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:05,221
Look, try this!

1540
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,292
Will you shut up?

1541
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,227
You know how
that voice carries?

1542
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,296
When you're mad at me,
I expect to see it.

1543
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,764
I don't want to
have to read about it

1544
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:17,033
two years from now
in your goddamn diary!

1545
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,780
You know how our good times
together come in waves?

1546
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:33,817
Right now I would say
we were in a very deep trough.

1547
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:57,974
Hi, guys.

1548
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:00,176
How you doing?

1549
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:01,210
Great.

1550
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:04,213
God, is Nick sore.

1551
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,849
Poor guy.

1552
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:09,318
He just loves to be babied.

1553
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:12,822
Think that's enough?

1554
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:13,957
Well, see you tomorrow.

1555
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,124
Hurry up!

1556
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:17,727
I'm coming! Bye.

1557
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:28,471
Good night.

1558
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:02,465
Jack! What do you say?

1559
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:13,536
Come on! Come on!

1560
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:27,483
Oh, shit!

1561
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,025
Wait right out there.

1562
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:43,426
The doctor wants
us to wait outside.

1563
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:44,760
He really amazes me.

1564
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,362
You need some
help or anything?

1565
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,764
- We'll see you
in five minutes.
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1566
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,100
You all right, babe?
I'll see you around.

1567
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:52,701
What's this? Crutches!

1568
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:54,370
Crutches are havoc.

1569
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:56,505
What's that?

1570
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:57,673
What?

1571
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,475
That. The limping stuff?
What is it?

1572
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,244
I got a blister.

1573
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:04,247
Excuse me.

1574
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,348
Doctor?

1575
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:06,282
Ginny, I don't...

1576
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,184
Could you look at
his leg, too, please?

1577
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:09,552
Sure.
After we're finished here.

1578
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,087
He can hop right
up on the table.

1579
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,388
There's nothing wrong with me!

1580
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:15,024
You landed awful hard once.
I saw you.

1581
01:23:15,058 --> 01:23:16,125
Nick, I saw it, too.

1582
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,161
- We saw it! Don't be brave.
- I saw that, too.

1583
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,795
All right.
All right. All right.

1584
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,298
You want to take an X-ray
of my foot, go right ahead.

1585
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,766
-Take my picture.
-Which one?

1586
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,686
I'll tell
you what the funniest
sight in the world was.

1587
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,421
It was you going on that jump.

1588
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:47,156
You looked like
a dying turkey.

1589
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:53,762
The arms and
the legs started to go.
I thought I would die!

1590
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:57,533
Listen, the thing to
do is take the boat

1591
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:59,402
from Southampton
when you're traveling.

1592
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:00,603
Oh, yeah?

1593
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:02,571
And take...

1594
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:05,308
It's climbing
a quarter of a degree an hour.

1595
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:08,111
I'm not going out
in that cold anymore.

1596
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:12,081
That's exactly half of us
felled by disaster
on our first day.

1597
01:24:12,115 --> 01:24:14,683
So what do you
suppose we should do now?

1598
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:17,086
How about if we talk?

1599
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,722
Talk?

1600
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:23,192
Ever since we saw the kids up
at school,
we've been walking on eggs.

1601
01:24:23,226 --> 01:24:24,860
-I'm gonna get some coffee.
-What do you mean?

1602
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:28,364
We have dinner,
we talk about the
kids, we talk about the news,

1603
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,399
but we...
We don't really talk.

1604
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,535
About what?

1605
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,537
About us.

1606
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,473
You're gonna jump all over me,
but I think we
should clear the air.

1607
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:40,276
Oh, no!

1608
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:43,446
Please, some of us
aren't feeling too well,
do you mind?

1609
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:46,215
I think we should
sit down for a while
and hash this thing out.

1610
01:24:46,249 --> 01:24:48,417
I'd rather have
my teeth drilled.

1611
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:50,753
What do you want to open up
a big can of worms for?

1612
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:52,821
Because I thought it
was worth it. Forget it.

1613
01:24:54,557 --> 01:24:55,624
All right!

1614
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:57,293
Okay, that's it.

1615
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:04,633
Did you see this?

1616
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:05,801
I saw it.

1617
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:08,504
Anne's got pictures in it.

1618
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:10,273
Yeah.

1619
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:13,376
She's making friends,
she's working,
she's never been better.

1620
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:16,312
And you'll notice,
these are pictures of people,

1621
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:17,613
not kumquats.

1622
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:20,283
I saw it.

1623
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,785
Hey, guys,

1624
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:25,288
why don't we have some fun?

1625
01:25:25,321 --> 01:25:28,624
You know that roadhouse,
about 15 miles from here?

1626
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:29,558
Yeah?

1627
01:25:29,592 --> 01:25:31,827
They're gotta have
music tonight, right?

1628
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,330
I mean, we can't all dance,

1629
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,732
but we could sit
and have a beer,
listen to the music.

1630
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:39,268
Here we go.
I'd like to get out of here.

1631
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:42,505
I think that's a swell idea.

1632
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:44,873
I'm not
against having a good time.

1633
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:47,276
Let's have fun.

1634
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:50,279
Don't hurt yourself laughing.

1635
01:25:50,313 --> 01:25:52,915
When are you
going to forgive me
for marrying Ginny, ever?

1636
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,350
You can do anything you want.

1637
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:55,384
Oh, thanks.

1638
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:57,553
Where's the warmth
you're always talking about?

1639
01:25:57,586 --> 01:25:58,921
You're as cold as that
frozen lake out there.

1640
01:25:58,954 --> 01:26:02,191
Listen, I adore Ginny.
I have nothing but
the deepest affection

1641
01:26:02,225 --> 01:26:03,326
for both of you.

1642
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:04,660
But you won't forgive me?

1643
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:06,262
Is this man crazy or what?

1644
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:08,231
No, he's not crazy.

1645
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:10,433
You want us to
level with one another?

1646
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:12,568
The truth is
we're all mad at you.

1647
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:15,304
We love Ginny but we're upset
because Anne isn't here.

1648
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:16,705
Maybe they're mad
at you, but I'm not.

1649
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:18,441
Well, good.

1650
01:26:18,474 --> 01:26:20,843
As long as we're
all honest and open.

1651
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:23,712
Is this the fun part?
Are we having fun yet?

1652
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:28,751
Ow!

1653
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:31,720
Damn it!

1654
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,753
What can I get you, folks?

1655
01:27:04,787 --> 01:27:06,589
Beer for me.

1656
01:27:06,622 --> 01:27:08,691
And I'll have a J&B
on the rocks, too.

1657
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:14,863
Great band.

1658
01:27:16,632 --> 01:27:18,434
You know, I always
wondered what happened

1659
01:27:18,467 --> 01:27:20,035
to the old Glen
Miller arrangement.

1660
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,776
So you don't
think I'm honest, huh?

1661
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,446
Okay, Jack, forget it.
I'm sorry I said it.

1662
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:31,747
No,
come on, say what you think.

1663
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,482
-Do you really want me to?
-Yeah.

1664
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:39,888
Well, I think sometimes
you are a little cold.

1665
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:41,890
There's a little
part of you always, uh,

1666
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:44,993
that hangs back and judges.

1667
01:27:45,027 --> 01:27:47,396
You always want to get
to the bottom of things,

1668
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,598
but only so long as
you can make the rules.

1669
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:51,634
Mmm-hmm. I see.

1670
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,471
That's all right, it's human.

1671
01:27:55,504 --> 01:27:57,706
Okay, fine, I'm human.
I don't mind being human.

1672
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,675
As long as we
realize you're human, too.

1673
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:00,909
Yeah, I'm human.

1674
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:02,545
As long as we realize that

1675
01:28:02,578 --> 01:28:05,414
it's also human to be
the world's foremost authority

1676
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:07,316
on everything
from who ordered
the roast beef at lunch

1677
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:10,419
to the nervous
system of the newt.

1678
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:13,422
To be so completely obsessed
with your own body

1679
01:28:13,456 --> 01:28:15,758
that you take
your temperature
at the dinner table!

1680
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,793
Look, I think maybe
you better just cool it.

1681
01:28:17,826 --> 01:28:19,094
No,
it's all right, don't worry.

1682
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,563
You're going a little too far.

1683
01:28:20,596 --> 01:28:22,365
No, it's all right.

1684
01:28:23,466 --> 01:28:25,701
Let me tell you something,
Jack.

1685
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:27,770
I'm 10 years
older than you, right?

1686
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,873
All right, I just hope
that when you
get to be my age,

1687
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:33,842
you don't smell
the foul breath of
death and disintegration

1688
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:37,413
hanging over your shoulder
the way I find it
hanging over mine.

1689
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:41,617
I mean, I go to sleep at night
on an ache so bad

1690
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,387
that it simply
will not go away.

1691
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,556
I wake up in the middle
of the night sweating,

1692
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:51,126
hearing my own bones decaying.

1693
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,129
I have shifted into
a state of entropy

1694
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,765
that's
progressing geometrically.

1695
01:28:56,799 --> 01:28:59,668
You see, "entropy,"

1696
01:28:59,702 --> 01:29:01,904
"progressing geometrically."

1697
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:03,672
You...
You talk like a bad textbook.

1698
01:29:03,706 --> 01:29:05,374
Why don't you
just speak English?

1699
01:29:05,408 --> 01:29:08,911
Goddamn it! I just
told you my deepest fear!

1700
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:11,580
Why can't you
listen to what I'm saying

1701
01:29:11,614 --> 01:29:13,782
instead of how I'm saying it?

1702
01:29:13,816 --> 01:29:18,487
I mean, do you have
any idea, any idea,

1703
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:20,656
what it is to be
afraid of death?

1704
01:29:21,924 --> 01:29:23,892
I can't eat my
bowl of cereal anymore

1705
01:29:23,926 --> 01:29:26,762
because I have
an irrational fear of milk.

1706
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:28,831
I stand there in hallways...

1707
01:29:32,935 --> 01:29:38,140
I stand there in hallways
afraid to press
strange elevator buttons.

1708
01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:41,844
I almost threw away my
jockey shorts because
I have this fear of elastic.

1709
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,783
Don't laugh at him.

1710
01:29:47,816 --> 01:29:50,586
Go on, go on, what?

1711
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:53,689
Laugh, good.
I'm a fool, right?

1712
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,524
No, Danny.

1713
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:57,092
I'm a collection
of eccentricities.

1714
01:29:59,828 --> 01:30:03,065
You think because I'm quirky,
I don't hurt?

1715
01:30:03,098 --> 01:30:05,501
-No.
-Well, you have it wrong.

1716
01:30:06,602 --> 01:30:08,837
I'm quirky because I hurt.

1717
01:30:10,473 --> 01:30:12,007
Oh, Danny, I'm sorry.

1718
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,609
All right.

1719
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:16,679
Come on.

1720
01:30:16,712 --> 01:30:18,981
Are you really
afraid of your underwear?

1721
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:25,821
I'm dying, she's laughing.

1722
01:30:25,854 --> 01:30:27,856
We're not laughing, Danny.
Honest.

1723
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:29,592
We are.

1724
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:32,227
Forget it. Forget it.
Let's listen to the music.

1725
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,831
No, it's all right. Forget it.

1726
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:37,966
Okay, come on.
Danny, let's dance.

1727
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,867
Come on.

1728
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:41,003
No, thanks.
No. I don't want to dance.

1729
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:42,938
Danny!

1730
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:44,172
-Dance.
-Come on.

1731
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:45,841
Go ahead, dance. Go on, dance.

1732
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:48,677
Go boogie.

1733
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,815
I'm having one hell of a time.

1734
01:30:55,618 --> 01:30:56,985
All right!

1735
01:30:57,986 --> 01:31:00,523
* In the night

1736
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:06,729
* Strangers in the night

1737
01:31:24,046 --> 01:31:25,247
Fire.

1738
01:31:26,181 --> 01:31:27,883
I'm dying for some coffee.

1739
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:28,917
Oh, get us some coffee.

1740
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:30,919
Coffee! Hello!

1741
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:32,254
Anybody home?

1742
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:34,890
-You want some coffee?
-Coffee!

1743
01:31:34,923 --> 01:31:37,059
Come on, give us
a little smile. Come on.

1744
01:31:37,092 --> 01:31:38,293
-You want some coffee?
-Coffee!

1745
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:39,862
That's nice.

1746
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:44,232
You trying to
get us thrown out?

1747
01:31:44,266 --> 01:31:45,901
There's nobody here.

1748
01:31:45,934 --> 01:31:48,036
I bet we're the only
people in this building.

1749
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:49,638
Throw me the newspaper.

1750
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:51,674
Want some coffee?

1751
01:31:51,707 --> 01:31:53,642
Who wants coffee?
You want coffee?

1752
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:56,178
Danny wants coffee.

1753
01:31:57,846 --> 01:31:59,615
Danny needs some coffee.

1754
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,930
What? What?

1755
01:32:19,101 --> 01:32:20,669
Oh, God.

1756
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,009
I think Danny's upset.

1757
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:30,112
Oh, he'll be all right.

1758
01:32:30,145 --> 01:32:34,316
We've been joking
around all night and
he hasn't joined in.

1759
01:32:34,349 --> 01:32:37,586
I think he's hurt.
I think maybe we
owe him an apology.

1760
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,688
What,
because I laughed at him?

1761
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:42,691
Well, yeah.

1762
01:32:45,828 --> 01:32:48,296
Look, Ginny,

1763
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:51,667
when people have been
friends as long as we have,

1764
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:56,905
it's not such a terrible thing
to kid somebody
out of a depression.

1765
01:32:56,939 --> 01:33:00,242
So don't get upset
about what you
don't understand.

1766
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,318
I've just about had
it with you people.

1767
01:33:11,053 --> 01:33:13,255
What's the matter?

1768
01:33:13,288 --> 01:33:15,724
I'll tell you what's
the matter. I'm mad.

1769
01:33:15,758 --> 01:33:17,726
Ginny?

1770
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,994
I fall in love with this man,

1771
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:21,263
and all of a sudden,
in addition to him

1772
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:23,866
I've got four
constant companions!

1773
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:25,934
I have to work out
a new relationship

1774
01:33:25,968 --> 01:33:27,936
with somebody who
is going through

1775
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,706
the worst period of his life,
only I can't do it alone,

1776
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:33,041
I've got to do it in
front of four other people!

1777
01:33:33,075 --> 01:33:36,044
And it's not as if my
privacy was invaded,

1778
01:33:36,078 --> 01:33:38,180
you all have let me
know every single day

1779
01:33:38,213 --> 01:33:40,615
that I have been
intruding on your territory!

1780
01:33:43,886 --> 01:33:46,855
Let me tell you something.
As far as I'm concerned,

1781
01:33:46,889 --> 01:33:50,325
you're all demanding and
unforgiving,
every single one of you.

1782
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,061
Everybody is sweet
and warm and simple,

1783
01:33:53,095 --> 01:33:54,663
but everybody ignores me.

1784
01:33:54,697 --> 01:33:57,165
I'm like a leper.

1785
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:00,068
I'm... I'm a blank spot
where Anne used to be.

1786
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,745
I'm going to go
take a run in the snow.

1787
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:17,085
I hope she'll be
all right out there.

1788
01:34:19,955 --> 01:34:21,456
Wish I hadn't said that.

1789
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:22,891
What happened?

1790
01:34:23,926 --> 01:34:26,161
Ginny! Ginny!

1791
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:27,229
I'm going after her!

1792
01:34:27,262 --> 01:34:28,463
Nick!

1793
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,798
You got a broken ankle.

1794
01:34:29,832 --> 01:34:31,366
She might fall
down in the dark.

1795
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:34,436
So what? She fell down
in the daylight,
she didn't hurt herself.

1796
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:36,271
Yeah, well, in the dark
she might hurt herself.

1797
01:34:36,304 --> 01:34:37,806
Nick,
come on, she'll be all right.
Rest your foot.

1798
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,943
Look,
I'm not going to run the risk
of her falling down out there.

1799
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:43,779
- Why not?
- Because she's pregnant.

1800
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:46,815
Because she's pregnant?

1801
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:48,984
Watch this.

1802
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:50,853
Here's some real
heartwarming acceptance.

1803
01:34:50,886 --> 01:34:54,122
You're 43 years old,
you're going to
start having babies?

1804
01:34:54,156 --> 01:34:56,291
I don't believe this.

1805
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:57,659
I have to check
everything with you?

1806
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:01,730
As a matter of fact,
I told you I wanted
to start a new family.

1807
01:35:01,764 --> 01:35:03,365
With babies?

1808
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:05,000
With what? Airedales?

1809
01:35:06,134 --> 01:35:08,003
Look, do what you want.

1810
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:11,106
Oh, thanks very much.
I really appreciate that.

1811
01:35:11,139 --> 01:35:12,875
Fellows, come on back inside.

1812
01:35:12,908 --> 01:35:14,109
It's freezing out here.

1813
01:35:14,142 --> 01:35:16,044
Come on, you can't go
after her like that.

1814
01:35:16,078 --> 01:35:17,279
-Come on.
-Come on.

1815
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:20,148
Nick, please! Come on.

1816
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,795
It's
starting to get light out.
Where the hell is she?

1817
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,965
You know,

1818
01:35:38,433 --> 01:35:41,236
when she ran out of
here I started to think of

1819
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:43,538
all the friends
we've had over the years

1820
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,507
who've jogged
out of our lives.

1821
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,944
All the ones who've, uh,

1822
01:35:48,977 --> 01:35:52,881
who've been inconvenient
to stay friendly
with and it scares me.

1823
01:35:55,918 --> 01:35:59,287
They move to another state
or they've gotten a divorce

1824
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:03,458
or else we've just gotten
friendly enough with them

1825
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:06,161
to realize they're
kind of a pain in the ass

1826
01:36:06,194 --> 01:36:08,530
and pretty soon we
never see them again.

1827
01:36:10,465 --> 01:36:12,400
I'll tell you something, Jack.

1828
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:16,371
I don't want to be
one of two people

1829
01:36:16,404 --> 01:36:19,007
alone in the world
at the end of my life.

1830
01:36:21,309 --> 01:36:23,078
I want to have friends.

1831
01:36:26,548 --> 01:36:28,450
When I get old,

1832
01:36:29,484 --> 01:36:32,020
I'd like you all
to still be there.

1833
01:36:39,928 --> 01:36:42,197
Okay?

1834
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:44,232
Why can't we just let them be?

1835
01:36:46,001 --> 01:36:48,536
In other words,
I'm the problem?

1836
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:50,072
I have to have
everything my way.

1837
01:36:50,105 --> 01:36:52,340
I'm unforgiving and cold
and judgmental, right?

1838
01:36:52,374 --> 01:36:53,475
Right.

1839
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:54,609
Right.

1840
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,411
We're talking about me?

1841
01:36:56,444 --> 01:37:00,215
Jack, you know
those probing questions
you ask all the time?

1842
01:37:00,248 --> 01:37:04,386
You're the only one who ever
answers them. Everybody
dances to your tune!

1843
01:37:04,419 --> 01:37:06,054
That makes me
sound like a tyrant.

1844
01:37:06,088 --> 01:37:07,489
Well, so what?

1845
01:37:07,522 --> 01:37:10,225
I am not a tyrant,
God damn it!

1846
01:37:12,227 --> 01:37:14,096
No matter what kind of
crap I get from people,

1847
01:37:14,129 --> 01:37:16,531
all I ever give
back is a smile.

1848
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:21,603
I never give a response that's
anything but fair and
rational and cheerful!

1849
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,272
Be careful! Be careful!

1850
01:37:24,306 --> 01:37:26,441
Why don't you
let your anger
out once in a while?

1851
01:37:26,474 --> 01:37:29,077
You want anger?
There! How's that?

1852
01:37:30,412 --> 01:37:31,947
Is that angry
enough for you? Here.

1853
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,315
How about that?

1854
01:37:35,117 --> 01:37:38,520
Is that angry enough for you?
Now is that angry enough?

1855
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:40,388
Here, how about this?

1856
01:37:40,422 --> 01:37:42,090
What the hell you doing?

1857
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:44,126
You know what I
expect from you.

1858
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,128
I expect closeness

1859
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:49,131
and warmth and
unconditional acceptance.

1860
01:37:49,164 --> 01:37:53,035
And all I get from you is
secretiveness and
neurosis and a lot of...

1861
01:37:53,068 --> 01:37:54,970
-God damn it!
-Jesus Christ!

1862
01:37:55,003 --> 01:37:55,971
Put it down!

1863
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:58,974
I'm not paying for this!
This is your expense!

1864
01:37:59,007 --> 01:38:00,542
Yeah, bet your life!

1865
01:38:00,575 --> 01:38:02,044
All right, stop that!

1866
01:38:02,077 --> 01:38:03,278
Is that angry
enough for you, huh?

1867
01:38:03,311 --> 01:38:05,380
Stop that!
All right, stop it!

1868
01:38:05,413 --> 01:38:07,916
Stop it! That's enough!
That's all, stop it!

1869
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,451
Come on! Settle down!

1870
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,388
Come here. Sit down.

1871
01:38:13,421 --> 01:38:16,358
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

1872
01:38:29,604 --> 01:38:32,440
I wonder what other people do
on their vacations?

1873
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,412
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1874
01:38:39,681 --> 01:38:41,616
Jesus, look what I did.

1875
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:43,551
So you freaked out a little.

1876
01:38:44,219 --> 01:38:46,388
So what?

1877
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,090
I lost complete
control of myself.

1878
01:38:48,123 --> 01:38:50,658
Jack, nobody cares.

1879
01:38:52,094 --> 01:38:53,495
-Hey.
-What?

1880
01:38:55,397 --> 01:38:58,466
You're not the best
little boy in the world.

1881
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:02,504
I hate to break this to you,
but you're not
the worst little boy, either.

1882
01:39:08,143 --> 01:39:11,079
You know,
sometimes when you
say things like that,

1883
01:39:13,115 --> 01:39:14,716
I really hate you.

1884
01:39:14,749 --> 01:39:16,384
Thank you.

1885
01:39:17,652 --> 01:39:20,088
You know,
sometimes I hate you.

1886
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:30,098
Nick, what are you doing?

1887
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:31,366
I'm gonna go find her.

1888
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:34,102
Wait a minute. You stay.

1889
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:35,203
I'll go find her.

1890
01:39:35,237 --> 01:39:36,371
No, I can do it.

1891
01:39:36,404 --> 01:39:39,007
Nick, look, please. I want to.

1892
01:39:39,674 --> 01:39:41,343
Let me go, please.

1893
01:39:43,111 --> 01:39:44,312
Thanks, but I can do it.

1894
01:39:44,346 --> 01:39:46,114
No, I'll do it.

1895
01:39:46,148 --> 01:39:47,382
No, I'll do it!

1896
01:39:47,415 --> 01:39:48,583
Look,
you sit down and wait for me.

1897
01:39:48,616 --> 01:39:49,851
-I'll be right back!
-Don't do me any favors.

1898
01:39:49,884 --> 01:39:52,154
-Will you get out of my way?
-Where you gonna
go on that foot?

1899
01:39:52,187 --> 01:39:54,556
Jack! Don't be ridiculous!

1900
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:55,790
He's got a broken ankle!

1901
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,259
And you've got
a torn ligament.

1902
01:39:57,292 --> 01:39:59,594
You guys wouldn't get
10 feet in that snow.

1903
01:39:59,627 --> 01:40:01,029
I'd get farther than he can.

1904
01:40:01,063 --> 01:40:02,230
I can get farther
than both of you.

1905
01:40:02,264 --> 01:40:05,033
What do you guys
think a pregnant woman is?
An invalid?

1906
01:40:05,067 --> 01:40:06,334
I'll be back in two minutes.

1907
01:40:06,368 --> 01:40:07,802
You better start
fixing up this place.

1908
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,572
That moose is going
to cost a fortune.

1909
01:40:16,311 --> 01:40:20,182
Ginny! Don't move,
I'll be right there!

1910
01:40:20,215 --> 01:40:21,716
Stay right there!

1911
01:40:32,627 --> 01:40:34,062
Oh!

1912
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,468
Hey, wait! Help me!

1913
01:40:41,503 --> 01:40:42,704
Help me!

1914
01:40:42,737 --> 01:40:45,073
Run to the lodge! Go get help!

1915
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:46,541
I can't get out!

1916
01:40:49,144 --> 01:40:51,279
Run! Go faster, faster!

1917
01:40:53,481 --> 01:40:55,350
Help! Help!

1918
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:04,759
Are you all right?

1919
01:41:06,428 --> 01:41:09,231
Danny went through the
ice and he can't get out!

1920
01:41:22,877 --> 01:41:25,180
-Jack!
-Please help.

1921
01:41:25,213 --> 01:41:26,214
Hurry up!

1922
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:53,375
Help! Help!

1923
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:02,684
Quick!

1924
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:10,525
Jack, don't go too far out!

1925
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,596
Okay. Danny!

1926
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:15,797
Lift up your arms!

1927
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:16,864
This side.

1928
01:42:16,898 --> 01:42:18,333
Wait a minute.

1929
01:42:18,366 --> 01:42:19,434
Ready here!

1930
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:21,569
Get your arm around that!
Get it under your elbow!

1931
01:42:21,603 --> 01:42:22,870
God damn it, lift your arm up!

1932
01:42:22,904 --> 01:42:23,938
Danny, get it around!

1933
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,440
Okay, hold onto the rope.

1934
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:26,574
I got the blanket.

1935
01:42:26,608 --> 01:42:27,775
Okay, go!

1936
01:42:27,809 --> 01:42:29,277
Back it up.

1937
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:30,945
Okay, go back. Go ahead.

1938
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,247
Go back slowly.

1939
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,281
Easy! Easy! Easy!

1940
01:42:33,315 --> 01:42:35,583
-Pull the rope!
-Easy.

1941
01:42:35,617 --> 01:42:36,884
That's it, Danny.

1942
01:42:36,918 --> 01:42:39,621
Go on, keep going!

1943
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:41,689
Keep going!

1944
01:42:41,723 --> 01:42:43,325
All right, hold it!

1945
01:42:47,595 --> 01:42:49,531
Danny!

1946
01:42:49,564 --> 01:42:50,832
Danny!

1947
01:42:50,865 --> 01:42:52,534
Danny? How is he?

1948
01:42:52,567 --> 01:42:54,569
-Danny!
-Don't say that!

1949
01:42:54,602 --> 01:42:55,637
Danny?

1950
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,440
Danny?

1951
01:42:58,473 --> 01:42:59,774
Breathe, honey!

1952
01:42:59,807 --> 01:43:01,976
Little more!
Rub... Rub his legs.

1953
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:04,612
Come on. Come on, sweetheart.

1954
01:43:11,453 --> 01:43:12,787
Thank God!

1955
01:43:14,756 --> 01:43:16,658
Danny, are you all right?

1956
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,793
Are you all right, honey?

1957
01:43:18,826 --> 01:43:20,495
You almost drowned.

1958
01:43:21,496 --> 01:43:22,797
Keep covered up.

1959
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,767
Thanks, I'm okay.
I'm okay. Thank you.

1960
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,835
I almost died, and thank you.

1961
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:29,637
Get him up!

1962
01:43:36,378 --> 01:43:39,681
Oh, my God! My Mercedes!

1963
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:53,561
How could you drive
my Mercedes on thin ice?

1964
01:43:53,595 --> 01:43:54,662
Oh!

1965
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:57,499
Danny, come on, get up.

1966
01:43:57,532 --> 01:43:58,766
Come on.

1967
01:44:01,969 --> 01:44:03,037
Oh, God!

1968
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,539
Get off the blanket.

1969
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:07,375
It was brand new!

1970
01:44:07,409 --> 01:44:10,044
In three years,
I could have gotten
twice what I paid for it!

1971
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:12,914
Danny, Danny, we'll get
someone to fish
it out for you.

1972
01:44:12,947 --> 01:44:15,983
What the hell am I going to do
with a rusty Mercedes?

1973
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:17,352
It's gone!

1974
01:44:17,385 --> 01:44:18,486
It's gone.

1975
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,455
It sank like a stone.

1976
01:44:20,488 --> 01:44:21,656
Danny!

1977
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:24,626
You are alive.
You have your life.

1978
01:44:24,659 --> 01:44:27,429
You have us and we
love you, so shut up!

1979
01:44:27,462 --> 01:44:28,430
Come on, Dan.

1980
01:44:28,463 --> 01:44:30,332
Get inside. You're
going to freeze to death.

1981
01:44:30,365 --> 01:44:32,800
Get into
the lodge and get warm.

1982
01:44:32,834 --> 01:44:34,536
Sorry.
I just got a little crazy.

1983
01:44:34,569 --> 01:44:37,572
I'm sorry.
What do I care about the car.

1984
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:38,973
It's you I care about.

1985
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:40,742
Let's go! Come on!

1986
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:42,710
To hell with the car,
thank you.

1987
01:44:43,711 --> 01:44:46,681
Oh, my God, you sank my car!

1988
01:44:46,714 --> 01:44:47,882
Get back.

1989
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:49,417
Get back to
the lodge and shut up!

1990
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:51,953
All right, I'm okay.
To hell with the car.

1991
01:44:51,986 --> 01:44:53,421
It's you I love.

1992
01:44:53,455 --> 01:44:55,022
Come on, let's go.

1993
01:44:55,823 --> 01:44:57,058
Come on, let's go.

1994
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:01,062
Why'd you have to
take it on the ice?

1995
01:45:01,095 --> 01:45:02,697
Will you shut up,
for Christ's sake!

1996
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:04,832
We just saved
your goddamn life!

1997
01:45:04,866 --> 01:45:07,435
What were you trying to
rescue me for, anyway?

1998
01:45:07,469 --> 01:45:08,570
I was fine!

1999
01:45:08,603 --> 01:45:12,039
I'm sick of
this macho bullshit!

2000
01:45:12,073 --> 01:45:13,741
No more stunts, okay?

2001
01:45:13,775 --> 01:45:14,876
Okay, yeah.

2002
01:45:14,909 --> 01:45:17,579
You guys really piss
me off, you know that?

2003
01:45:17,612 --> 01:45:18,846
Yeah, we heard you.

2004
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,748
It's gone.
I'll never see it again.

2005
01:45:20,782 --> 01:45:21,949
Please, Danny.

2006
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:23,918
I say we come
back here next winter.

2007
01:45:23,951 --> 01:45:26,388
Will you listen to me.
Follow this...
