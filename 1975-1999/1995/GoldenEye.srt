1
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,989
I beg your pardon.
I forgot to knock.

2
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,517
I’m alone.

3
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,411
Aren’t we all?

4
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,304
- You’re late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

5
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,967
Ready to save the world again?

6
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,223
After you, 006.

7
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:25,226
James, for England.

8
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:26,640
For England, Alec.

9
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:11,890
It’s too easy.

10
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:14,392
Half of everything is luck, James.

11
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:17,610
And the other half?

12
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,044
Fate.

13
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,954
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes, check.

14
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,089
Fire!

15
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,863
Closing time, James!
Last call!

16
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,707
Buy me a pint.

17
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,687
This is Colonel Ourumov! Come out
with your hands above your heads!

18
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,081
How original.

19
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:28,904
Shut the door, Alec!
There’s a draft!

20
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,158
Alec?

21
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:50,305
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

22
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:52,467
Finish the job, James!
Blow them all to hell!

23
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,108
You have ten seconds.

24
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:57,906
Ten...

25
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:01,228
nine... eight...

26
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,354
seven... six...

27
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:07,362
five...

28
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,995
four... three... two--

29
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,626
For England, James!

30
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,824
Hold your fire!
You’ll blow the gas tanks!

31
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,839
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands above your--

32
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,407
Wait!

33
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,576
You can’t win.

34
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:34,767
Get out there! Move!
Move it!

35
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,884
Hold your fire!

36
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,318
Wait!

37
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:48,558
James, is it really necessary
to drive quite so fast?

38
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,304
More often than you’d think.

39
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:04,272
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but--

40
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,222
- Who’s that?
- The next girl.

41
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:19,223
James, stop this! Stop it!
I know what you’re doing.

42
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,264
Really?
What’s that, dear?

43
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:24,371
You are just trying to show off
the size of your, your--

44
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,238
- Engine?
- Ego.

45
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:30,595
We’re having a pleasant drive, and
you’ve got to bring psychology into it.

46
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:32,852
I was just sent here
to evaluate you.

47
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,846
Let’s try and put that
behind us, shall we?

48
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:11,816
Ladies first.

49
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:31,147
- James, I want you to stop this car.
- Really?

50
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,025
Stop this car at once!

51
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:45,276
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

52
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,949
James, you’re incorrigible.

53
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,981
What am I going to do with you?

54
00:16:56,941 --> 00:17:00,654
Well, let’s toast your evaluation,
shall we?

55
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:09,295
A very thorough evaluation.

56
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:05,219
Madame wins.

57
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:14,331
Bet, Mademoiselle? No?

58
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:17,456
Monsieur?

59
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:20,260
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

60
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:21,877
No players?

61
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,920
It appears we share the same passions.
Three, anyway.

62
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,987
I count two.

63
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,677
Motoring and baccarat.

64
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:55,648
Seven. Madame wins.

65
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:59,436
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

66
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:01,500
One rises to meet a challenge.

67
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:40,883
Madame stands with five.

68
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,980
Six. Madame loses.

69
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,684
Enjoy it while it lasts.

70
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,887
The very words I live by.

71
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,272
And what words do you live by?

72
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,178
The trick is to quit
while you’re still ahead.

73
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:10,755
That’s one trick I’ve never learned.
Perhaps you’ll show me how it’s done.

74
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:15,041
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

75
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,651
And for you?

76
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,356
The same.

77
00:20:19,362 --> 00:20:21,378
How do you take it?

78
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:24,799
Straight up, with a twist.

79
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,440
Thank you, Mr.--?

80
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,663
The name’s Bond.
James Bond.

81
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,073
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

82
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,312
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.

83
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,830
Your accent, Georgian?

84
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,998
Very good, Mr. Bond.

85
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:47,060
- You’ve been to Russia?
- Not recently.

86
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:49,900
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

87
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:54,737
It’s very different now,
a land of opportunity.

88
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,686
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

89
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,892
No, not quite.
That belongs to a friend.

90
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,565
A tip for your friend:

91
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:07,566
The French registration plates for this
year’s model start with the letter ’L.’

92
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:09,489
Even the counterfeit ones.

93
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:14,269
Oh. And what rank
do you hold...

94
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:18,245
with the Motor Vehicles Department,
Mr. Bond?

95
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,881
Commander.

96
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:23,562
- Shall we go?
- This one is an Admiral.

97
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:27,406
I like a woman
who enjoys pulling rank.

98
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,096
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.

99
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:34,288
The pleasure, I’m sure,
was all mine.

100
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:03,908
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

101
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:08,602
Identification confirmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.

102
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:12,718
Current suspected links to the
Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg.

103
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:16,061
Yacht Manticore is leased to
a known Janus corporate front.

104
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:19,111
M authorizes you
to observe Miss Onatopp...

105
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:23,924
but stipulates no contact
without prior approval.

106
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,167
End transmission. Moneypenny.
Good night, James.

107
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,877
I trust you’ll stay
’on-a-topp’ of things.

108
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:16,225
Xenia, I can’t breathe!

109
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:27,554
Yes! Yes!

110
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,836
My respects, Admiral.

111
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:42,576
Delighted to have you aboard,
Mademoiselle.

112
00:25:44,662 --> 00:25:47,580
Ladies and gentlemen...

113
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:51,730
please take your seats on the upper deck
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

114
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:27,209
What you are about
to see in operation...

115
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:30,013
is Europe’s answer
to the electronic battlefield:

116
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,683
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

117
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:37,534
Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger
not only uses stealth technology...

118
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:39,591
it is the only helicopter
to be hardened against...

119
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,727
all forms of
electronic interference...

120
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:44,455
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

121
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:57,538
I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.

122
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:59,928
I think I’ve gone to heaven.

123
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,367
Not yet.

124
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:12,190
Now please welcome the pilots.

125
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,828
Lieutenant Commander
Bernard Jaubert...

126
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:19,831
and Lieutenant Francois Brouse.

127
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:28,995
Select Mir.

128
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:31,797
Autographic projection.

129
00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:37,520
Compute possible intercept
with second stage geo-sat two.

130
00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:47,335
Anna.

131
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:54,042
He wouldn’t know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

132
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:57,844
Boris.

133
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,307
- Boris!
- What?

134
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,946
I thought I’d post it
on the Internet, no?

135
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:10,664
- What’s the password?
- I made it easy this time.

136
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:13,883
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht for brains.

137
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:18,549
All right, all right,
I’ll give you a hint.

138
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:23,119
They’re right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

139
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:26,724
You’re such a geek.

140
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:30,330
Yes, I’m in!

141
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,503
You’ve hacked into
the U.S. Department of Justice.

142
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:42,598
Do you know what will happen
if they trace it here?

143
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,288
The Chief of Computers
will call me a genius...

144
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:49,770
move me to Moscow and give me
a million bucks hard currency.

145
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,199
I think not.

146
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:58,019
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They’ll never detect me.

147
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,824
- You were saying, slug-head?
- Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko!

148
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,466
Spiked them!

149
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:09,654
Come on, Boris, just hang up.

150
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,487
No way! I spiked them!

151
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:17,216
All right, what’s the password?

152
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,326
I’m not going to tell you.

153
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:22,305
Okay, let me guess.

154
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:24,992
It’s not in front of me?

155
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:28,844
You sit on it,
but you can’t take it with you.

156
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:36,973
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever’s tracing me...

157
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,303
and jams their modem
so they can’t hang up.

158
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:44,156
Now the hunted
becomes the hunter.

159
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:50,864
Better luck next time...

160
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:52,650
slug-heads!

161
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:54,843
Bang! Gone!

162
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:57,136
I am invincible!

163
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:05,281
Was it good for you, too?

164
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:08,034
I’m getting some coffee.

165
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:10,011
I’m going for a cigarette.

166
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:17,512
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov...

167
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:20,127
head of Space Division.

168
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:33,574
- General, if I’d known--
- You’d have been ready.

169
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,131
This is an unscheduled test of the
Severnaya facility. War simulation.

170
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,379
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

171
00:32:41,313 --> 00:32:44,088
Two operational satellites, sir:
Petya and Mischa...

172
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,205
both in 90-minute earth orbit
at 100 kilometers.

173
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:51,281
Good. Here is the
authorization code.

174
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,353
Now, the GoldenEye and today’s access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

175
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:58,414
I am timing you.

176
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,093
Good.
Thank you, Major.

177
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:11,492
On my count.

178
00:34:11,498 --> 00:34:14,866
Three... two... one.

179
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,554
Set target: Severnaya.

180
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,160
Arm the weapon.

181
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:04,393
Check it!

182
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:20,790
Their best response time is 19 minutes.
They’ll be late.

183
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:58,732
It’s clean.
I had to ventilate someone.

184
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,556
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

185
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:41,904
M will meet you in the situation room.
I’m to take you straight in.

186
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:44,339
I’ve never seen you after hours,
Moneypenny. Lovely.

187
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:47,744
- Thank you, James.
- Out on a professional assignment?

188
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,204
Dressing to kill?

189
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,950
I know you’ll
find this crushing, 007...

190
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:55,697
but I don’t sit at home every night
praying for an international incident...

191
00:36:55,615 --> 00:36:59,434
so I can run down here all dressed up
to impress James Bond.

192
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:02,721
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theater together.

193
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:05,325
Moneypenny, I’m devastated.

194
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,865
What would I ever do without you?

195
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:11,539
As far as I can remember, James,
you’ve never had me.

196
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,714
Hope springs eternal.

197
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,383
You know, this sort of behavior
could qualify as sexual harassment.

198
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,984
Really?
What’s the penalty for that?

199
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,005
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendos.

200
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,729
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist.

201
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:37,312
You first.

202
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,719
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What’s up?

203
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:47,239
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call...

204
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,899
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya.

205
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:52,403
Look what the satellite picked up.

206
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:58,697
We found a match:
your missing Tiger.

207
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,107
In the middle of Northern Russia.

208
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:03,093
It seems your hunch
was right, 007.

209
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,139
It’s too bad the evil Queen of Numbers
wouldn’t let you play it.

210
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:13,740
- You were saying?
- No, I was just--

211
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:17,994
Good. Because if I want sarcasm,
Mr. Tanner, I’ll talk to my children.

212
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:21,709
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

213
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:25,206
The Prime Minister’s
waiting for an update.

214
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:28,287
Proceed with your briefing,
Mr. Tanner.

215
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:29,729
Thank you.

216
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:34,658
After the distress signal,
your helicopter took off...

217
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:37,279
and the Russians scrambled
these three MIGs here to intercept it.

218
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:39,912
What do you think the Russians
are using the base for?

219
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:42,832
Well, at one point we suspected
Severnaya might be the ground station...

220
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:46,814
for a secret space-based weapons program
called GoldenEye, but--

221
00:38:46,718 --> 00:38:48,735
Our statistical analysis
saw they had...

222
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,081
neither the finance
nor technology to implement it.

223
00:38:51,056 --> 00:38:53,487
Numbers were never
my strong suit.

224
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:56,460
Are these pictures live?

225
00:38:57,662 --> 00:39:01,445
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

226
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:27,423
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

227
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:32,342
What the bloody hell was that?

228
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:01,576
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

229
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:06,972
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

230
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,164
Boris!

231
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,427
Boris!

232
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,208
Thanks.

233
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:27,225
Our satellite is knocked out.

234
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,951
So are two of the Americans.

235
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:35,255
We have another
coming into range...

236
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:36,645
now.

237
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:41,015
Good God.

238
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:44,875
Two of the MIGs are down.

239
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,707
And it looks like
the third went into the dish.

240
00:43:47,663 --> 00:43:49,715
What do you think?

241
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:51,572
No lights.

242
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:54,413
Not one single electric light on
in a 30-mile radius.

243
00:43:55,704 --> 00:43:57,198
E.M.P.?

244
00:43:57,205 --> 00:43:59,494
- That explains the MIGs and satellites.
- And the blackout.

245
00:43:59,474 --> 00:44:01,550
Electromagnetic Pulse:

246
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:04,353
a first-strike satellite weapon
developed by the--

247
00:44:04,312 --> 00:44:06,981
The Americans and Soviets
during the Cold War.

248
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:10,945
I’ve read the brief.
Discovered after Hiroshima.

249
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,626
Set off a nuclear device
in the upper atmosphere.

250
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:15,176
Creates a pulse...

251
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:18,486
a radiation surge that destroys
everything with an electronic circuit.

252
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:21,271
The idea being to knock out
the enemy’s communications...

253
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:24,074
before he, she, or they
could retaliate.

254
00:44:25,264 --> 00:44:27,731
So, GoldenEye exists.

255
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:29,806
Yes.

256
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,373
- Could this be an accident?
- No.

257
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,210
The helicopter.

258
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:37,432
If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

259
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:40,780
Setting off the blast was the ideal way
to wipe out any trace of the crime.

260
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:43,037
The Janus group?

261
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,611
It may have been involved
with the helicopter.

262
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,528
I know the Russian
failsafe systems.

263
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,025
You don’t just walk in
and ask for the keys to the bomb.

264
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,350
You need the access codes.

265
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,378
It had to be an insider.

266
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,807
And at least one person
probably knows who it is.

267
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:39,145
Very well, sir.
Thank you. Good night.

268
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:42,517
The Prime Minister’s
talked to Moscow.

269
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:46,013
They’re saying it was an accident
during a routine training exercise.

270
00:45:45,939 --> 00:45:49,308
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

271
00:45:49,242 --> 00:45:51,495
What else do we know about
the Janus syndicate?

272
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:54,633
Topflight arms dealers,
headquartered in St. Petersburg.

273
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,806
The first outfit to restock
the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

274
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,261
The head man’s unreliably described.
No photographs.

275
00:46:01,187 --> 00:46:04,448
The woman, Onatopp...

276
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,785
is our only confirmed contact.

277
00:46:06,758 --> 00:46:10,471
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

278
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:14,179
- Your predecessor kept cognac in the--
- I prefer bourbon.

279
00:46:14,766 --> 00:46:16,260
- Ice?
- Yes.

280
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,236
We’ve pulled the files on
anyone who might have had access...

281
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:30,200
or authority at Severnaya.

282
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:33,408
The top name on the list is
an old friend of yours, I understand.

283
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,544
Ourumov.

284
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:41,128
They made him a General.

285
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,686
He sees himself as
the next Iron Man of Russia.

286
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:47,300
So our political analysts rule him out.
He doesn’t fit the profile of a traitor.

287
00:46:47,229 --> 00:46:50,384
Are these the same analysts
who said that GoldenEye couldn’t exist?

288
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,138
Who said the helicopter
posed no immediate threat...

289
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:56,639
and wasn’t worth following?

290
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:01,100
You don’t like me, Bond.
You don’t like my methods.

291
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:02,987
You think I’m an accountant...

292
00:47:02,977 --> 00:47:05,610
a ’bean counter,’ more interested
in my numbers than your instincts.

293
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,117
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

294
00:47:08,082 --> 00:47:12,008
Because I think you’re a sexist,
misogynist dinosaur.

295
00:47:11,919 --> 00:47:14,136
A relic of the Cold War...

296
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,037
whose boyish charms,
though wasted on me, obviously appeal...

297
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,836
to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.

298
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:23,126
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.

299
00:47:23,062 --> 00:47:26,989
If you think for one moment I don’t have
the balls to send a man out to die...

300
00:47:26,899 --> 00:47:29,496
your instincts are dead wrong.

301
00:47:29,468 --> 00:47:32,528
I’ve no compunction about
sending you to your death.

302
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:36,599
But I won’t do it on a whim, even with
your cavalier attitude towards life.

303
00:47:40,645 --> 00:47:42,757
I want you to find GoldenEye.

304
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:46,460
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

305
00:47:46,384 --> 00:47:48,815
And if you should come across Ourumov,
guilty or not...

306
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:51,905
I don’t want you running off
on some kind of vendetta.

307
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:54,287
Avenging Alec Trevelyan
will not bring him back.

308
00:47:54,258 --> 00:47:56,725
- You didn’t get him killed.
- Neither did you.

309
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:58,910
Don’t make it personal.

310
00:48:00,062 --> 00:48:01,556
Never.

311
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:05,906
Bond.

312
00:48:09,405 --> 00:48:10,721
Come back alive.

313
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:53,961
Good morning, General Ourumov.

314
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:58,535
Defense Minister Mishkin,
gentlemen.

315
00:48:59,352 --> 00:49:02,163
Please deliver your report.

316
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:08,183
As this Council is aware,
72 hours ago...

317
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:11,803
a secret weapon system code-named
GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya.

318
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,197
As head of Space Division...

319
00:49:14,165 --> 00:49:17,083
I personally undertook
the investigation.

320
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:21,861
I have concluded this crime
was committed by Siberian separatists...

321
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:24,408
seeking to create
political unrest.

322
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:27,392
Regrettably,
the peaceful work...

323
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,915
and much-needed hard currency
earnings of Severnaya...

324
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:33,034
have been set back
by several years.

325
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:34,999
Therefore,
I tender my resignation.

326
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:41,834
It seems the Council does not
want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

327
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:45,304
Merely your loyal assurance that
there are no other GoldenEye satellites.

328
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:47,339
I can give you that assurance,
Defense Minister.

329
00:49:47,328 --> 00:49:50,626
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

330
00:49:53,901 --> 00:49:58,100
I was aware only of the one,
Boris Grishenko.

331
00:49:58,006 --> 00:50:01,126
There was a girl also
whose body was not among the dead.

332
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:03,400
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova,
a level-two programmer.

333
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:07,117
I will investigate immediately,
Defense Minister.

334
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,476
It would seem presumptuous,
General...

335
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:12,675
to blame this incident
on Siberian separatists...

336
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,166
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

337
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:18,402
Do you agree?

338
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:21,789
Yes, Defense Minister.

339
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:24,050
Thank you for
bringing it to my attention.

340
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:27,526
That will be all.

341
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,035
Morning, Q.
Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

342
00:50:47,986 --> 00:50:49,053
Hunting!

343
00:50:50,888 --> 00:50:53,735
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

344
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,644
First, your new car, BMW.

345
00:50:56,593 --> 00:51:00,720
Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar...

346
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:02,433
self-destruct system...

347
00:51:02,432 --> 00:51:06,038
and naturally,
all the usual refinements.

348
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:09,573
Now, this I’m
particularly proud of.

349
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:13,051
Behind the headlights,
Stinger missiles.

350
00:51:12,974 --> 00:51:16,379
Excellent. Just the thing for unwinding
after a rough day at the office.

351
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:18,707
Need I remind you, 007...

352
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,076
that you have a license to kill...

353
00:51:21,049 --> 00:51:24,239
not to break the traffic laws.

354
00:51:24,186 --> 00:51:26,262
- I wouldn’t think of it.
- Good.

355
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:28,791
Right. Let’s get on
to more practical matters.

356
00:51:28,757 --> 00:51:31,639
A typical leather belt.

357
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:35,555
Male, size 34, buckle notch.

358
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:40,557
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

359
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:42,609
Good. A typical leather belt.

360
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:44,441
Q, I’m familiar with that device.

361
00:51:44,437 --> 00:51:49,229
Not one with a 75-foot rappelling cord
built into the buckle.

362
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:52,513
Fire, and out shoots a piton...

363
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:56,334
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

364
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:59,759
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

365
00:51:59,685 --> 00:52:02,283
It’s tested for one, 007.

366
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:09,233
Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.

367
00:52:11,697 --> 00:52:14,922
X-ray document scanner.

368
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:18,021
A pen.
This is a Class Four grenade.

369
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,753
Three clicks
arms the four-second fuse.

370
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,341
Another three disarms it.

371
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:30,081
How long did you say the fuse was?

372
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:32,157
Oh, grow up, 007!

373
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,165
They always said the pen
was mightier than the sword.

374
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,926
Thanks to me, they were right.

375
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:41,085
Look, let’s ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

376
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,422
Here we are.
Sorry about this, Fred.

377
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:45,503
One... two... three.

378
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:53,682
Don’t say it.

379
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:55,684
The writing’s on the wall?

380
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,721
Along with the rest of him.

381
00:52:58,806 --> 00:53:02,447
Now, 007, do please try
and return some of--

382
00:53:05,113 --> 00:53:08,754
Do please try and return some of
this equipment in pristine order.

383
00:53:08,682 --> 00:53:11,986
Don’t touch that!
It’s my lunch.

384
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:39,952
In London,
April’s a spring month.

385
00:53:39,945 --> 00:53:43,041
Oh, yeah?
And what are you, the weatherman?

386
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,862
For crying out loud,
another stiff-assed Brit...

387
00:53:45,816 --> 00:53:48,770
with your secret codes
and your passwords.

388
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,743
One of these days you guys
are going to learn just to drop it.

389
00:53:51,689 --> 00:53:54,050
Come on, my car’s over there.

390
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:11,289
- After you.
- Thank you.

391
00:54:14,143 --> 00:54:16,575
Like you said, drop it.

392
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,621
In London,
April’s a spring month...

393
00:54:18,614 --> 00:54:20,690
whereas in St. Petersburg
we’re freezing our butts off!

394
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:22,758
Now, is that close enough
for government work?

395
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,905
No. Show me the rose.

396
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:28,181
Please, no.

397
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:30,407
All right, all right, all right!

398
00:54:42,903 --> 00:54:45,821
- Muffy?
- Third wife.

399
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:49,377
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

400
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:51,455
- That’s a nice move.
- Nice car.

401
00:54:51,445 --> 00:54:53,318
This baby hasn’t let me down yet.

402
00:54:53,312 --> 00:54:55,945
She’s an ugly little bitch,
but she gets you there.

403
00:54:55,915 --> 00:54:58,548
Hey, Bond, you do any gardening?

404
00:55:15,432 --> 00:55:17,449
Hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

405
00:55:18,603 --> 00:55:21,794
- What do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

406
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:25,557
No one’s ever seen him.
But the man’s connected up the kazoo.

407
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:28,536
KGB, military.
Screwdriver.

408
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:34,382
Rumor has it, he lives on one of
those old Soviet missile trains...

409
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:38,554
that armored stuff they ran around
the country so we couldn’t target them.

410
00:55:38,454 --> 00:55:40,636
Want to hand me
that hammer, Jimbo?

411
00:55:42,024 --> 00:55:44,799
No, the bigger one.
The sledge.

412
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,137
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don’t find this guy. He finds you.

413
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,150
Hell, it’s all Russian Mafia.

414
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,741
The best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

415
00:55:59,975 --> 00:56:02,892
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy.

416
00:56:02,843 --> 00:56:05,725
A tough mother. Got a limp on
his right leg. Name’s Zukovsky.

417
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,606
- Valentin Dimiterveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah. You know him?

418
00:56:09,517 --> 00:56:11,948
I gave him the limp.

419
00:56:36,808 --> 00:56:38,124
Yes?

420
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:41,225
Are these all you have?

421
00:56:41,213 --> 00:56:44,238
How many do you want?

422
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:47,373
Twenty-four for the American school,
eleven for the Swedish.

423
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:50,235
IBM compatible
with 500 meg. hard drives...

424
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:53,770
CD ROM and 14.4 modems.

425
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,086
- Will you pay dollars?
- Of course.

426
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:58,420
If madame would require
a demonstration, I could--

427
00:56:58,396 --> 00:57:02,215
Madame requires one demonstration model
and a quiet place to test it.

428
00:57:17,213 --> 00:57:18,352
Natalya.

429
00:57:33,895 --> 00:57:36,291
Is everything satisfactory?

430
00:57:36,263 --> 00:57:38,588
Everything except the interruption.

431
00:57:51,912 --> 00:57:53,988
Now let me get you straight, Jimmy.

432
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,179
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

433
00:57:58,084 --> 00:58:01,109
And now you want Valentin Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

434
00:58:01,053 --> 00:58:02,582
Yes.

435
00:58:02,587 --> 00:58:04,948
Well, what are you going to do?
Appeal to his heart?

436
00:58:04,924 --> 00:58:06,868
No, his wallet.

437
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,440
Oh, that might work.
Okay, show time.

438
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:18,995
Valentin operates out of
building number 23 there.

439
00:58:18,936 --> 00:58:20,809
Are you sure
you want to do this?

440
00:58:20,804 --> 00:58:24,066
Last guy who dropped in uninvited
went home airfreight...

441
00:58:24,008 --> 00:58:26,155
in very small boxes.

442
00:58:27,177 --> 00:58:29,715
Make sure they
send me home first-class.

443
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:26,656
Natalya, it’s me!
It’s Boris!

444
00:59:26,632 --> 00:59:29,170
It’s Boris! It’s Boris!
Hello.

445
00:59:34,306 --> 00:59:36,903
Another morning shot to hell.

446
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:42,082
Free market economy.
I swear it will be the end of me.

447
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:50,925
Walther PPK,
7.65 millimeter.

448
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,664
Only three men I know
use such a gun.

449
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:56,197
I believe I’ve killed
two of them.

450
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,819
Lucky me.

451
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,011
I think not.

452
01:00:25,086 --> 01:00:26,960
James Bond.

453
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:31,414
Charming, sophisticated
secret agent.

454
01:00:33,227 --> 01:00:35,243
Shaken but not stirred.

455
01:00:36,397 --> 01:00:40,287
I see you haven’t lost your
delicate sense of humor, Valentin, huh?

456
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,046
Or your need for an audience.

457
01:00:43,003 --> 01:00:45,019
Who’s strangling the cat?

458
01:00:46,106 --> 01:00:47,600
Strangling a cat?

459
01:00:53,178 --> 01:00:55,431
That is Irina, my mistress.

460
01:00:57,181 --> 01:00:58,949
A very talented girl.

461
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:02,986
Irina! Take a hike!

462
01:01:07,558 --> 01:01:09,396
So, Mr. Bond...

463
01:01:09,394 --> 01:01:12,727
what is it that brings you
to my neighborhood, hmm?

464
01:01:12,663 --> 01:01:14,775
Still working for MI6...

465
01:01:14,765 --> 01:01:17,541
or have you decided
to join the 21st century?

466
01:01:18,436 --> 01:01:20,452
I hear the new M is a lady.

467
01:01:20,437 --> 01:01:23,035
I want you to do me a favor.

468
01:01:25,574 --> 01:01:28,492
He wants me to do him a favor!

469
01:01:30,012 --> 01:01:32,645
My knee aches...

470
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:36,886
every single day,
twice as bad when it is cold.

471
01:01:36,786 --> 01:01:40,225
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country, hmm?

472
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:41,709
Tell him, Dimitri!

473
01:01:41,724 --> 01:01:44,120
- Well, it depends--
- Silence!

474
01:01:44,093 --> 01:01:48,090
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

475
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:51,222
Someone of your stature must’ve realized
the skill was not to hit your knee...

476
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,012
but to...
miss the rest of you.

477
01:01:55,803 --> 01:01:57,535
So why did you not kill me?

478
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,055
Call it professional courtesy.

479
01:02:02,142 --> 01:02:05,783
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

480
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:10,408
Kirov’s funeral parlor,
4:00 this afternoon.

481
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:15,856
Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

482
01:02:15,788 --> 01:02:19,393
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money’s exchanged...

483
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:21,862
their man drives the hearse out.

484
01:02:21,828 --> 01:02:24,709
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

485
01:02:24,664 --> 01:02:27,060
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

486
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:29,527
Your money.

487
01:02:30,769 --> 01:02:33,758
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

488
01:02:33,704 --> 01:02:37,144
I want you to set me up...
with Janus.

489
01:02:37,943 --> 01:02:40,445
What has he done to deserve you?

490
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:43,081
- Stole a helicopter.
- I have six.

491
01:02:43,047 --> 01:02:45,123
Three. None that fly.

492
01:02:45,116 --> 01:02:46,919
Who’s counting?

493
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:49,312
These are not just criminals,
Valentin, they’re traitors.

494
01:02:49,285 --> 01:02:52,061
They used the chopper
to steal a nuclear weapon.

495
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:55,117
Killed a lot of
innocent Russians doing it.

496
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:57,763
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

497
01:02:58,762 --> 01:03:02,475
This Janus, I’ve never met the man,
but I know he’s a Lienz Cossack.

498
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:06,182
Group that worked for the Nazis
against the Russians, Second World War.

499
01:03:06,101 --> 01:03:08,734
You know your history, Mr. Bond.
At the end of the war...

500
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:12,417
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria...

501
01:03:12,341 --> 01:03:16,860
believing they’d join your government
and wage war against the communists.

502
01:03:16,744 --> 01:03:18,761
But, the British betrayed them...

503
01:03:18,746 --> 01:03:22,601
sent them promptly back to Stalin
who promptly had them all shot--

504
01:03:22,517 --> 01:03:25,186
women, children, families.

505
01:03:26,154 --> 01:03:28,098
Not exactly our finest hour.

506
01:03:29,756 --> 01:03:33,789
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

507
01:03:33,693 --> 01:03:37,168
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I’m asking about the chopper.

508
01:03:37,097 --> 01:03:39,635
You’re going to meet me tonight
at the Grand Hotel Europe.

509
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,489
And then, you and I are even
and he owes me one?

510
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:45,742
Precisely.

511
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:50,724
You don’t need the gun,
Commander.

512
01:04:50,664 --> 01:04:54,069
That depends on your definition
of ’safe sex.’

513
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,136
That’s close enough.

514
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:04,504
Not for what I have in mind.

515
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:31,150
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

516
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,680
You think you can break me?

517
01:06:00,864 --> 01:06:02,631
Yes! Yes!

518
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:03,770
Yes!

519
01:06:09,872 --> 01:06:11,604
No, no, no.

520
01:06:13,074 --> 01:06:15,292
No more foreplay.

521
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:18,695
Take me to Janus.

522
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,194
- This is it?
- Yes.

523
01:06:37,898 --> 01:06:43,497
Well, I must say,
I’ve had a lovely evening. You?

524
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:45,969
Well, once again,
the pleasure was all yours.

525
01:06:45,938 --> 01:06:47,954
You’ll understand
if I don’t call.

526
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,513
I won’t lose sleep over it.

527
01:06:52,912 --> 01:06:54,750
Sweet dreams.

528
01:08:07,113 --> 01:08:08,773
Hello, James.

529
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:34,117
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

530
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:38,679
No longer just an anonymous star
on the memorial wall at MI6.

531
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,762
What’s the matter, James?
No glib remark?

532
01:08:42,717 --> 01:08:44,484
No pithy comeback?

533
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,936
Why?

534
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:52,634
Hilarious question,
particularly from you.

535
01:08:53,227 --> 01:08:55,243
Did you ever ask why?

536
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:59,463
Why we toppled all those dictators,
undermined all those regimes?

537
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:03,114
Only to come home: ’Well done, good job.
But sorry, old boy.

538
01:09:03,036 --> 01:09:05,990
Everything you risked your life
and limb for has changed.’

539
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:09,937
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you’d say that.

540
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:13,876
James Bond,
Her Majesty’s loyal terrier...

541
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:16,104
defender of the
so-called ’faith.’

542
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:18,619
Oh, please, James, put it away.

543
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:22,399
It’s insulting to think I haven’t
anticipated your every move.

544
01:09:25,639 --> 01:09:27,228
Yes.

545
01:09:28,943 --> 01:09:32,003
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust?

546
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,897
What a quaint idea.

547
01:09:35,816 --> 01:09:39,920
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

548
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,746
Once again, your faith is misplaced.
They knew.

549
01:09:43,656 --> 01:09:46,325
We’re both orphans, James.

550
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:50,419
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident...

551
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:54,184
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin’s execution squads.

552
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:59,155
But my father couldn’t let himself,
or my mother, live with the shame of it.

553
01:10:00,773 --> 01:10:04,414
MI6 figured I was
too young to remember.

554
01:10:04,343 --> 01:10:07,083
And in one of life’s
little ironies...

555
01:10:07,044 --> 01:10:10,448
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal...

556
01:10:10,382 --> 01:10:13,786
caused the father
to kill himself and his wife.

557
01:10:13,718 --> 01:10:15,865
Hence, Janus.

558
01:10:16,953 --> 01:10:19,456
The two-faced Roman god
come to life.

559
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:23,278
It wasn’t God who gave me this face,
it was you...

560
01:10:23,193 --> 01:10:26,254
setting the timers for three minutes
instead of six.

561
01:10:26,196 --> 01:10:28,213
Am I supposed
to feel sorry for you?

562
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:31,709
No. You’re supposed
to die for me.

563
01:10:34,537 --> 01:10:36,340
Oh, by the way...

564
01:10:36,338 --> 01:10:39,434
I did think of asking you
to join my little scheme...

565
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,044
but somehow I knew...

566
01:10:42,011 --> 01:10:47,218
007’s loyalty was always to the mission,
never to his friend.

567
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,369
Closing time, James.
Last call.

568
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:09,235
For England, James.

569
01:11:09,268 --> 01:11:11,415
Wake up!

570
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:12,899
Mister!

571
01:11:14,174 --> 01:11:16,392
Wake up, please!

572
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,557
- Wake up!
- I’m here.

573
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:20,976
- I’m here!
- Hurry!

574
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:23,520
Hurry up! Come out!

575
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,535
Pull yourself together!
We’re going to die!

576
01:11:28,788 --> 01:11:31,113
Do something!
Get us out of here!

577
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:34,565
I’m a little tied up--
Never mind.

578
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:55,956
The things that we do
for ’frequent flyer’ mileage.

579
01:12:58,069 --> 01:13:00,287
Here, let me help you.

580
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:02,347
That’s it, mind your head.

581
01:13:10,748 --> 01:13:13,036
Let me go!

582
01:13:56,824 --> 01:13:58,840
Who are you?

583
01:14:00,294 --> 01:14:03,413
Listen, I’m on your side.
I’m here to help you.

584
01:14:03,363 --> 01:14:04,857
- I don’t know anything.
- I don’t believe you.

585
01:14:04,865 --> 01:14:06,881
- I don’t care what you believe.
- Look!

586
01:14:06,866 --> 01:14:10,057
They might be back for us any minute.
You either take your chances with me...

587
01:14:10,003 --> 01:14:12,363
or your fellow countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya.

588
01:14:12,338 --> 01:14:15,327
I’ve never been to Severnaya.

589
01:14:15,274 --> 01:14:19,722
Your watch has.
Frozen by the GoldenEye blast.

590
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,944
And I’m willing to bet you’re the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

591
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:27,623
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

592
01:14:27,586 --> 01:14:30,183
And the more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

593
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:33,760
- But I don’t know anything!
- Then let’s start with what you do know.

594
01:14:44,068 --> 01:14:46,179
My name is Natalya Simonova.

595
01:14:47,504 --> 01:14:51,252
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until--

596
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:52,941
Go on.

597
01:14:54,511 --> 01:14:57,879
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

598
01:14:57,814 --> 01:14:59,830
No. I don’t know who that is.

599
01:14:59,815 --> 01:15:02,591
Who was the insider?
Who was the traitor?

600
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:04,983
Boris.
Boris Grishenko.

601
01:15:04,954 --> 01:15:09,117
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

602
01:15:09,024 --> 01:15:12,393
- There was no one else?
- No.

603
01:15:13,962 --> 01:15:16,038
They’re going to kill me,
aren’t they?

604
01:15:17,732 --> 01:15:19,226
Trust me.

605
01:15:21,702 --> 01:15:25,700
Trust you?
I don’t even know your name.

606
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:29,340
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

607
01:15:29,308 --> 01:15:30,802
Sit.

608
01:15:37,484 --> 01:15:40,224
I’m Defense Minister
Dimitri Mishkin.

609
01:15:40,186 --> 01:15:43,626
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

610
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:45,738
What, no small talk?

611
01:15:45,725 --> 01:15:49,473
No chitchat?
That’s the trouble with the world today.

612
01:15:49,395 --> 01:15:54,187
No one takes the time to do a sinister
interrogation anymore. It’s a lost art.

613
01:15:54,066 --> 01:15:57,090
Your sense of humor doesn’t slay me,
Commander. I’m sorry.

614
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:59,360
- Where is the GoldenEye?
- I assumed you had it.

615
01:15:59,336 --> 01:16:03,155
I have an English spy, a Severnaya
programmer and the helicopter they took.

616
01:16:03,074 --> 01:16:05,055
That’s what some traitor in your
government wanted it to look like.

617
01:16:05,043 --> 01:16:07,889
- Who was behind the attack on Severnaya?
- Who had the authorization codes?

618
01:16:07,845 --> 01:16:10,585
Russia may have changed, but the
penalty for terrorism is still death!

619
01:16:10,548 --> 01:16:14,925
- And what’s the penalty for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it!

620
01:16:14,818 --> 01:16:17,878
You’re like boys with toys.

621
01:16:22,259 --> 01:16:25,899
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

622
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:28,189
I saw him do it.

623
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:32,031
Are you certain it was Ourumov?

624
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,377
Yes. He killed everyone
and stole the GoldenEye.

625
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:40,188
And why would he do that?

626
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:43,945
There is another satellite.

627
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:48,998
Another GoldenEye?

628
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:51,934
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

629
01:16:53,354 --> 01:16:56,865
You were saying something about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?

630
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:00,960
Defense Minister, I must protest!

631
01:17:00,927 --> 01:17:03,987
This is my investigation.
You are out of order.

632
01:17:05,732 --> 01:17:08,686
From what I am hearing,
it is you who’s out of order!

633
01:17:09,903 --> 01:17:11,705
- I have seen this gun before.
- Put it down.

634
01:17:11,704 --> 01:17:13,542
- In the hand of our enemy.
- Put it down, General!

635
01:17:13,539 --> 01:17:16,694
Do you even know who
the enemy is, Dimitri?

636
01:17:16,642 --> 01:17:18,374
- Do you?
- Guard!

637
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:27,707
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...

638
01:17:28,854 --> 01:17:32,886
murdered by a British agent,
James Bond.

639
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,593
Himself shot while
trying to escape. Guards!

640
01:17:51,374 --> 01:17:52,869
Come on!

641
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:34,903
They’re in the archives!

642
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:41,615
Down!

643
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:35,723
Spread out!
Cover the other side!

644
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:37,331
Trust me.

645
01:20:13,873 --> 01:20:15,427
Go now!

646
01:20:45,736 --> 01:20:47,230
Faster!

647
01:21:07,656 --> 01:21:08,795
Damn it!

648
01:21:15,931 --> 01:21:17,354
Down the alley!

649
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:20,469
Use the bumper!
That’s what it’s for!

650
01:23:56,678 --> 01:23:58,551
What was that?

651
01:24:34,946 --> 01:24:36,262
Go left!

652
01:25:17,352 --> 01:25:19,120
Get out!

653
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:15,405
Either you’ve brought me
the perfect gift, General Ourumov...

654
01:26:15,339 --> 01:26:17,415
or you’ve made me
a very unhappy man.

655
01:26:17,408 --> 01:26:19,981
Mishkin got to them
before I could.

656
01:26:21,345 --> 01:26:24,014
Bond is alive?

657
01:26:23,981 --> 01:26:25,475
He escaped.

658
01:26:25,483 --> 01:26:28,887
Good for Bond.
Bad for you.

659
01:26:32,123 --> 01:26:34,448
Take a seat, my dear.

660
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:54,378
You know, James and I
shared everything.

661
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:59,093
Absolutely everything.

662
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,567
To the victor go the spoils.

663
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:17,060
You’ll like it where we’re going.

664
01:27:23,703 --> 01:27:26,241
You may even learn to like me.

665
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,552
Stay with her.

666
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:44,660
Bond.

667
01:27:44,689 --> 01:27:47,049
Only Bond.

668
01:27:47,024 --> 01:27:49,313
He’s going to derail us.

669
01:27:50,227 --> 01:27:51,366
Full speed!

670
01:27:52,763 --> 01:27:54,423
Full speed! Ram him!

671
01:28:59,758 --> 01:29:02,296
Why can’t you just be
a good boy and die?

672
01:29:02,261 --> 01:29:04,514
You first.

673
01:29:04,496 --> 01:29:07,616
You... second.

674
01:29:07,566 --> 01:29:08,953
Up!

675
01:29:12,737 --> 01:29:16,414
Situation analysis: hopeless.

676
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:20,887
You have no backup,
no escape route.

677
01:29:20,811 --> 01:29:23,587
And I have the only
bargaining chip.

678
01:29:23,547 --> 01:29:25,279
Where is she?

679
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:28,473
Oh, yes.
Your fatal weakness.

680
01:29:29,686 --> 01:29:32,011
Ourumov, bring her in.

681
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,066
Lovely girl.

682
01:29:36,059 --> 01:29:39,736
Tastes like...
like strawberries.

683
01:29:39,662 --> 01:29:41,714
- I wouldn’t know.
- I would.

684
01:29:50,305 --> 01:29:52,250
So, back where we started, James.

685
01:29:53,308 --> 01:29:56,154
Your friend or the mission.

686
01:29:56,111 --> 01:29:58,851
Drop the gun.
I’ll let her live.

687
01:30:02,416 --> 01:30:06,864
Ourumov, what has this
Cossack promised you?

688
01:30:08,122 --> 01:30:11,597
You knew, didn’t you?
He’s a Lienz Cossack.

689
01:30:11,525 --> 01:30:14,858
- It’s in the past.
- He’ll betray you!

690
01:30:14,795 --> 01:30:18,234
- Just like everyone else.
- Is this true?

691
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:23,135
What’s true is that in 48 hours
you and I will have more money than God.

692
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:25,575
And Mr. Bond here will have
a small memorial service...

693
01:30:26,606 --> 01:30:30,246
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

694
01:30:32,111 --> 01:30:35,621
So, what’s the choice, James?

695
01:30:35,547 --> 01:30:39,889
Two targets.
Time enough for one shot.

696
01:30:39,784 --> 01:30:41,801
The girl, or the mission?

697
01:30:41,786 --> 01:30:45,084
Kill her.
She means nothing to me.

698
01:30:48,259 --> 01:30:50,726
See you in hell, James.

699
01:31:01,003 --> 01:31:03,020
One-inch armor plating.

700
01:31:03,005 --> 01:31:05,472
I’m fine,
thank you very much!

701
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,157
- Boris, yes!
- What are you doing?

702
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:16,550
Boris is on-line,
backing up his files.

703
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:19,508
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they’re going.

704
01:31:22,157 --> 01:31:24,518
But don’t stand there!
Get us out of here!

705
01:31:25,493 --> 01:31:26,632
Yes, sir.

706
01:31:44,511 --> 01:31:47,049
Good luck with the floor, James.

707
01:31:47,013 --> 01:31:50,903
I set the timers for six minutes--
the same six minutes you gave me.

708
01:31:51,785 --> 01:31:54,382
It was the least
I could do for a friend.

709
01:31:56,255 --> 01:31:59,861
- What does that mean?
- We’ve got three minutes.

710
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:34,748
What else do you call your butt?

711
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,011
- What?
- It’s Boris’ password.

712
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:40,112
He plays word games: ’What I sit on,
but I don’t take it with me.’

713
01:32:40,063 --> 01:32:43,123
- Chair.
- Like I said.

714
01:32:47,303 --> 01:32:48,797
Thirty seconds.

715
01:32:48,804 --> 01:32:52,315
He’s not in Russia, Germany,
Paris, London, Madrid.

716
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:53,735
Twenty-five seconds.

717
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:55,994
New York, Toronto, Chicago,
San Francisco.

718
01:32:55,977 --> 01:32:57,566
Twenty seconds!

719
01:32:57,579 --> 01:32:59,867
Mexico City, Rio, Miami.

720
01:33:05,118 --> 01:33:07,063
- Come on!
- Wait!

721
01:33:07,054 --> 01:33:09,627
He’s in Cuba, Havana. No.

722
01:33:10,757 --> 01:33:11,824
Now!

723
01:33:31,644 --> 01:33:35,285
Do you destroy every vehicle
you get into?

724
01:33:35,214 --> 01:33:37,431
Standard operating procedure.

725
01:33:39,117 --> 01:33:41,442
’Boys with toys.’

726
01:33:44,189 --> 01:33:48,115
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

727
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,790
Our trip?

728
01:33:50,794 --> 01:33:53,391
Do you know how
to disarm the weapon?

729
01:33:55,633 --> 01:33:59,867
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you’re talking about disarming.

730
01:34:01,571 --> 01:34:04,905
So, tell me.

731
01:34:04,841 --> 01:34:08,316
Are there any other
standard operating procedures...

732
01:34:08,244 --> 01:34:11,304
I should be aware of, Commander?

733
01:34:16,018 --> 01:34:17,963
Thousands.

734
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:21,013
But I only pay them...

735
01:34:20,956 --> 01:34:22,865
lip service.

736
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:49,834
My whole life, I dreamed about
coming to the Caribbean.

737
01:34:49,748 --> 01:34:51,931
It’s so beautiful.

738
01:34:51,918 --> 01:34:54,551
Not another human being in sight.

739
01:35:07,031 --> 01:35:10,151
What is it with you
and moving vehicles?

740
01:35:35,025 --> 01:35:36,578
Yo, Jimbo!

741
01:35:36,592 --> 01:35:40,269
Brought a little gift from
old what’s-his-name, uh, T, Z--?

742
01:35:40,196 --> 01:35:41,963
- Q.
- Yeah.

743
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,712
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

744
01:35:45,635 --> 01:35:47,331
I am not here.

745
01:35:47,335 --> 01:35:50,490
The CIA has no knowledge, no
involvement, absolutely nothing to do...

746
01:35:50,438 --> 01:35:52,940
with your insertion into Cuba,
if you catch my drift.

747
01:35:52,907 --> 01:35:55,232
Yes, I do, perfectly.

748
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:57,535
Borrowed the plane from
a friend of mine in the DEA.

749
01:35:57,512 --> 01:36:00,288
Now, the Coast Guard
and the FAA are both in the loop.

750
01:36:00,248 --> 01:36:03,202
You’re cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

751
01:36:03,151 --> 01:36:05,582
Here’s the latest Sat-Int
from Langley.

752
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:09,680
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

753
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,022
- Who’s that?
- Natalya Siminova.

754
01:36:11,991 --> 01:36:13,485
Natalya Simonova.

755
01:36:13,494 --> 01:36:15,782
Russian Minister of Transportation.

756
01:36:18,364 --> 01:36:21,068
Did you check her out?

757
01:36:21,034 --> 01:36:23,667
- Head to toe.
- Right.

758
01:36:25,505 --> 01:36:28,731
So, you’re looking for a dish
the size of a football field, huh?

759
01:36:28,674 --> 01:36:32,352
Doesn’t exist. You can’t light a cigar
in Cuba without us seeing it.

760
01:36:32,277 --> 01:36:33,700
I know it’s there.

761
01:36:33,712 --> 01:36:36,903
It’s a duplicate of Severnaya, like your
secret transmitters in New Zealand.

762
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:40,980
I’ve never been to New Zealand.
How’d she know about that?

763
01:36:40,951 --> 01:36:42,267
What if I need backup?

764
01:36:42,286 --> 01:36:44,647
Get on the radio.
I’ll send in the Marines.

765
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:49,103
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

766
01:36:49,093 --> 01:36:51,631
- Cuba’s 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade.

767
01:36:55,865 --> 01:36:59,091
Just one thing: Don’t push
any of the buttons on that car.

768
01:36:59,035 --> 01:37:03,068
- I was going to go bombing around in it.
- Exactly.

769
01:37:02,972 --> 01:37:07,563
Yo, James, I got faith.
But be careful. He knows you’re coming.

770
01:38:12,337 --> 01:38:14,970
He was your friend, Trevelyan?

771
01:38:16,907 --> 01:38:20,027
And now he’s your enemy
and you will kill him.

772
01:38:21,845 --> 01:38:25,143
It is that simple?

773
01:38:25,082 --> 01:38:28,107
In a word, yes.

774
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:30,268
Unless he kills you first.

775
01:38:30,254 --> 01:38:32,542
- Natalya--
- You think I’m impressed?

776
01:38:32,523 --> 01:38:35,998
All of you with your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

777
01:38:35,925 --> 01:38:38,557
So you can be a hero?

778
01:38:39,762 --> 01:38:42,158
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya, listen to me.

779
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:45,392
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

780
01:38:47,302 --> 01:38:49,662
It’s what keeps me alive.

781
01:38:51,207 --> 01:38:52,178
No.

782
01:38:53,074 --> 01:38:55,090
It’s what keeps you alone.

783
01:39:33,846 --> 01:39:35,340
James?

784
01:39:37,448 --> 01:39:38,942
Yes?

785
01:39:45,923 --> 01:39:49,149
On the train...

786
01:39:49,092 --> 01:39:53,778
when you told him to kill me
and I meant nothing to you...

787
01:39:53,663 --> 01:39:55,680
did you mean it?

788
01:39:57,701 --> 01:39:59,290
Yes.

789
01:40:00,303 --> 01:40:04,016
Basic rule:
always call their bluff.

790
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:09,871
No.

791
01:40:43,076 --> 01:40:47,453
Turn ten degrees south,
bearing one-eight-four.

792
01:40:47,346 --> 01:40:49,078
Yes, sir.

793
01:41:13,939 --> 01:41:16,856
Nothing.
There is nothing here.

794
01:41:18,043 --> 01:41:20,225
Let’s make another pass.

795
01:41:32,622 --> 01:41:35,504
Maybe Wade was right.
There is no dish.

796
01:42:34,113 --> 01:42:35,773
Natalya.

797
01:43:36,071 --> 01:43:41,112
This time, Mr. Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

798
01:43:59,892 --> 01:44:01,967
Wait for your turn.

799
01:44:36,025 --> 01:44:38,295
She always did enjoy
a good squeeze.

800
01:44:49,138 --> 01:44:51,914
Is the satellite in range?

801
01:44:51,874 --> 01:44:53,985
- Six minutes.
- Prepare the dish.

802
01:44:53,975 --> 01:44:58,043
No! It’s too early.
I am not ready.

803
01:44:57,945 --> 01:44:59,570
Do it!

804
01:45:29,842 --> 01:45:31,609
No wonder we couldn’t see it.

805
01:45:42,454 --> 01:45:44,114
Come on.

806
01:45:59,769 --> 01:46:02,580
The world’s greatest cash card.

807
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:06,051
It had better not be rejected.

808
01:47:10,436 --> 01:47:13,555
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir.

809
01:47:18,943 --> 01:47:21,054
Kill him!

810
01:47:21,045 --> 01:47:23,227
The man just won’t take a hint.

811
01:47:24,681 --> 01:47:28,809
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

812
01:47:41,465 --> 01:47:44,205
He’s getting ready
to signal the satellite.

813
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:47,286
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna--

814
01:48:18,798 --> 01:48:21,087
Antenna in position.

815
01:48:24,537 --> 01:48:26,090
On my count.

816
01:48:27,239 --> 01:48:30,264
Three... two... one.

817
01:48:59,436 --> 01:49:01,547
God save the Queen.

818
01:49:20,389 --> 01:49:22,464
The mainframe computer.

819
01:49:22,457 --> 01:49:23,773
Don’t move.

820
01:50:50,305 --> 01:50:53,531
James!
What an unpleasant surprise.

821
01:50:53,475 --> 01:50:55,657
- We aim to please.
- Where’s the girl?

822
01:50:56,945 --> 01:50:58,048
Find her!

823
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:09,367
So, how is old Q?

824
01:51:09,323 --> 01:51:11,611
Up to his usual tricks?

825
01:51:11,592 --> 01:51:13,251
The watch.

826
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:20,707
A new model.

827
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:23,202
Still press here, do I?

828
01:51:39,484 --> 01:51:42,153
Interesting setup, Alec.

829
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:45,595
You break into the Bank of England
via computer...

830
01:51:45,523 --> 01:51:48,369
and then transfer
the money electronically...

831
01:51:48,325 --> 01:51:51,206
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye...

832
01:51:51,162 --> 01:51:54,423
which erases any record
of the transactions.

833
01:51:55,399 --> 01:51:58,353
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

834
01:51:58,302 --> 01:52:01,421
But it still boils down
to petty theft.

835
01:52:02,405 --> 01:52:05,075
In the end,
you’re just a bank robber.

836
01:52:05,041 --> 01:52:07,923
Nothing more
than a common thief.

837
01:52:17,352 --> 01:52:20,305
You always did have
a small mind, James.

838
01:52:20,254 --> 01:52:22,401
It’s not just
erasing bank records.

839
01:52:22,391 --> 01:52:25,272
It’s everything on every computer
in Greater London:

840
01:52:25,227 --> 01:52:29,877
tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries...

841
01:52:29,764 --> 01:52:32,681
criminal records.

842
01:52:32,632 --> 01:52:35,372
In 16 minutes and 43 sec--

843
01:52:35,336 --> 01:52:39,499
No, 42 seconds-- the United Kingdom
will reenter the Stone Age.

844
01:52:39,406 --> 01:52:42,039
A worldwide financial meltdown.

845
01:52:42,008 --> 01:52:47,250
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

846
01:52:47,113 --> 01:52:50,826
Oh, please, James.
Spare me the Freud.

847
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:54,190
I might as well ask you if all the vodka
martinis ever silence the screams...

848
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:56,029
of all the men you’ve killed.

849
01:52:59,325 --> 01:53:02,694
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms
of all those willing women...

850
01:53:02,628 --> 01:53:05,889
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

851
01:53:07,866 --> 01:53:11,471
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal...

852
01:53:11,402 --> 01:53:14,426
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

853
01:53:16,808 --> 01:53:19,761
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya!

854
01:53:54,376 --> 01:53:57,981
Don’t ever do that again!

855
01:53:57,912 --> 01:54:00,130
This is not one of
your games, Boris.

856
01:54:00,114 --> 01:54:03,755
Real people will die!
You pathetic little worm.

857
01:54:05,519 --> 01:54:07,951
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

858
01:54:07,922 --> 01:54:12,299
She’s a moron.
A second-level programmer.

859
01:54:12,192 --> 01:54:16,190
She works on
the guidance system.

860
01:54:16,095 --> 01:54:19,843
She doesn’t even have access
to the firing codes.

861
01:54:23,336 --> 01:54:25,696
Retrorockets firing!

862
01:54:43,355 --> 01:54:45,466
What the hell’s happening?

863
01:54:45,456 --> 01:54:49,454
We will have reentry in...
12 minutes!

864
01:54:51,629 --> 01:54:54,404
- It will burn up over the Atlantic.
- Deal with it!

865
01:54:55,266 --> 01:54:57,839
She changed the access codes!

866
01:54:58,735 --> 01:55:00,752
Well, then she can fix it.

867
01:55:04,274 --> 01:55:08,164
Go ahead, shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

868
01:55:09,211 --> 01:55:10,835
I can do it!

869
01:55:10,847 --> 01:55:13,278
- I can break her codes.
- Then get on with it!

870
01:55:42,376 --> 01:55:43,965
Tell him, now!

871
01:55:45,512 --> 01:55:49,367
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!

872
01:56:05,096 --> 01:56:07,836
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

873
01:56:07,799 --> 01:56:09,294
Possibly?

874
01:56:10,402 --> 01:56:12,869
We have to destroy
the transmitter.

875
01:56:12,836 --> 01:56:16,869
By the way,
I’m fine, thank you very much.

876
01:56:44,467 --> 01:56:46,411
Do you know how
to use one of these?

877
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:51,267
Yes.

878
01:56:51,273 --> 01:56:53,598
Good.
Stay out of sight.

879
01:57:08,389 --> 01:57:10,891
- How long?
- Two minutes. One minute.

880
01:57:10,858 --> 01:57:13,146
- Guard!
- I’m fixing it!

881
01:57:14,128 --> 01:57:16,725
If he moves, kill him.

882
01:58:38,571 --> 01:58:41,869
Yes! I am invincible!

883
02:00:52,361 --> 02:00:56,703
You know, James...
I was always better.

884
02:01:14,348 --> 02:01:15,842
Alpha One to Gunship.

885
02:01:16,917 --> 02:01:19,490
Alpha One to Gunship!

886
02:02:19,809 --> 02:02:21,920
Speak to me!

887
02:02:56,743 --> 02:02:59,139
For England, James?

888
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:02,073
No.

889
02:03:02,048 --> 02:03:03,542
For me.

890
02:04:22,723 --> 02:04:25,355
Yes! I am invincible!

891
02:04:50,081 --> 02:04:52,619
James! James!

892
02:04:52,584 --> 02:04:54,600
Are you all right?

893
02:04:57,789 --> 02:04:59,971
Yes, I’m fine, thank you.

894
02:05:09,966 --> 02:05:13,121
Suppose someone is watching?

895
02:05:13,069 --> 02:05:16,438
No. There’s no one
within 25 miles, believe me.

896
02:05:17,373 --> 02:05:18,867
Yo, Jimbo!

897
02:05:28,617 --> 02:05:32,851
Is this supposed to be your idea of, uh,
coming through in a clinch?

898
02:05:34,489 --> 02:05:38,593
It’s tobacco plants.
I said I’d be here, huh?

899
02:05:38,493 --> 02:05:40,569
Yo! Marines!

900
02:05:51,205 --> 02:05:55,081
Maybe you two would like to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

901
02:05:57,576 --> 02:05:59,901
- You ready?
- I’m not going on a helicopter with you.

902
02:05:59,877 --> 02:06:03,281
No plane, no train,
nothing that moves.

903
02:06:03,215 --> 02:06:06,584
Darling, what could
possible go wrong, eh?
