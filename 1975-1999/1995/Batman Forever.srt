1
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,806
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?

2
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:55,975
I'll get drive-through.

3
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:40,770
You're counting on the Winged Avenger
to deliver you from evil...

4
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,606
...aren't you, my friend?

5
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:45,817
Are you going to kill me?

6
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,571
Maybe, maybe not.
We're of two minds on the subject.

7
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:53,784
Are you a gambling man?

8
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:56,871
Let's say we flip for it?

9
00:02:57,955 --> 00:03:01,042
One man is born a hero,
his brother a coward.

10
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,045
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

11
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:08,299
...holy men are martyred,
and junkies grow legion.

12
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,259
Why?

13
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:13,012
Why, why, why, why, why?

14
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,348
Luck!

15
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,392
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah...

16
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:21,437
...clueless luck!

17
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:26,400
The random toss...

18
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:29,570
...is the only true justice.

19
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:32,407
Let's see what justice has in store...

20
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,910
...for you.

21
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,167
It's like the touch of God.

22
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:44,086
Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:49,591
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.

24
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:51,635
In your case, beer and pizza.

25
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:53,720
Out of here, guys!

26
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,849
-But you said you'd let me live!
-Too true!

27
00:03:57,182 --> 00:04:00,853
And so you shall! Nothing's better
than live bait to trap a bat.

28
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,620
Hot entrance.

29
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,372
Two-Face?

30
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:20,623
Two guards are dead.

31
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:23,126
He's holding a third hostage.
Didn't see this one coming.

32
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,627
We should have.

33
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:26,462
The Second Bank of Gotham--

34
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,798
Second anniversary
of the day I captured him.

35
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,383
How could he resist?

36
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,885
I'm Chase Meridian.

37
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:36,431
I asked her to come here to consult
on the case. She specializes in--

38
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,976
Abnormal psychology,
multiple personalities. I read your work.

39
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,186
Insightful.

40
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:42,896
Naive, but insightful.

41
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:46,816
I'm flattered. Not every girl
makes a superhero's night table.

42
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:48,401
Can we reason with him?

43
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:51,404
-He's got innocent people up there.
-It won't do any good.

44
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:54,158
-He'll slaughter them without a thought.
-Agreed.

45
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:57,870
A trauma powerful enough to create
an alternate personality leaves one--

46
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:00,915
In a world where normal rules
of right and wrong no longer apply.

47
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:01,999
Exactly.

48
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,250
Like you.

49
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:08,506
I could write a hell of a paper on a man
who dresses like a flying rodent.

50
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,301
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

51
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,095
Really? I didn't know that.

52
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,223
You are interesting.

53
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,435
And call me Chase.

54
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:27,107
By the way, do you have a first name,
or do I call you Bats?

55
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,367
Let's start this party with a bang!

56
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,379
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!

57
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,506
Kill the Bat!

58
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,269
Blast him!

59
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,534
Open sesame.

60
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:23,018
It's a trap!

61
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,764
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!

62
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:06,646
When we open that safe,
we'll have everything we ever wanted:

63
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:11,234
Enough cash to rain down upon
fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.

64
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,362
And, of course...

65
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,239
...you, my boy, dead!

66
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,911
It's boiling acid!

67
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:27,042
For your dying pleasure, we are serving
the acid that made us the men we are!

68
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:28,085
No!

69
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,214
-Hold on.
-Yes!

70
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,468
Haul away!

71
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:38,679
Yes! Haul away!

72
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:46,562
-Give me your hand.
-Don't let go!

73
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:53,945
I must borrow this.

74
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,242
That's my hearing aid!

75
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,577
Thanks.

76
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,875
Wow! My shoes are melting!

77
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,345
No more!

78
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:35,112
Hang on.

79
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,447
Hang on?

80
00:09:58,302 --> 00:09:59,637
Get him down.

81
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,097
Get him down.

82
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,058
Take it easy with him.

83
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:06,644
You'll be all right. Just stay calm.

84
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:20,450
This'll fix him!

85
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:28,458
Hang on, Batty!

86
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,689
Let's see.

87
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:52,441
Yes!

88
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:55,820
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, happy day!

89
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,782
Farewell forever to that...

90
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,993
...pointy-eared night rat!

91
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:05,705
Face!

92
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,190
You need help. Give it up.

93
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,424
Have the good taste to die!

94
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,219
See you!

95
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,680
Despite a valiant effort
last night by Batman...

96
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,726
...Harvey Two-Face is still at large
and extremely dangerous.

97
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,227
In other news today...

98
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,564
...billionaire Bruce Wayne extended
his profit-sharing program...

99
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:57,570
...to the employees of the successful
electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.

100
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,624
Mr. Wayne.

101
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:14,003
Your inspections are
a departmental highlight.

102
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,547
Oh, my God, it's him.

103
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,134
I am a winner. I am a winner.

104
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,761
I am a winner.

105
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,679
I am a winner.

106
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,351
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

107
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,603
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

108
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:34,107
Perhaps we should get to R & D
as soon as possible.

109
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,652
Mister...?

110
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,196
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

111
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:42,866
No, that's my name. And you are?

112
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,493
Nygma.

113
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,661
Edward.

114
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:48,330
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

115
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:50,791
Just like I tell everyone.

116
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:55,796
We've never actually met, but your name
was on the hiring slip. I have it.

117
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,632
I need that hand back.

118
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,343
Oh, yes, of course.

119
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:03,011
I'm sorry.

120
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:04,847
It's just that...

121
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:07,641
...you're my idol.

122
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:08,767
Back to work.

123
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:11,812
And some people have been trying
to keep us apart.

124
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,064
Back to work.

125
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:15,441
It's okay.

126
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,569
What's on your mind?

127
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:19,070
Precisely.

128
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,155
What's on all our minds?

129
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,157
Brain waves.

130
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,080
The future...

131
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:31,332
...of Wayne Enterprises...

132
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,043
...is brain waves.

133
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,589
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.

134
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:40,758
-I terminated his project today.
-It's okay.

135
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,176
I have it!

136
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:53,354
My invention...

137
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:57,026
...beams any TV signal directly
into the human brain.

138
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,197
By stimulating neurons,
manipulating brain waves...

139
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,118
...this device makes the audience
feel like they're inside the show.

140
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,206
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

141
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:13,167
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?

142
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:17,630
Yes.

143
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:19,673
But...

144
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,927
...someone like you would never need it.

145
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,137
Someone so...

146
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,640
...intelligent, witty and...

147
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,226
...charming.

148
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:35,357
I need a bit of additional funding
for human trials. Let me show you, please!

149
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:36,650
Now, listen...

150
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,819
...l want a full set of technical schematics
on this, okay?

151
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,405
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

152
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,741
Look at us! Two of a kind!

153
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,870
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.

154
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:51,081
That's not...

155
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:53,333
...going to be good for me.

156
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:55,919
I need an answer now.

157
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:58,588
I think I deserve it.

158
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:01,508
I'm sorry, then the answer is no.

159
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,011
Tampering with people's brain waves...

160
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,763
...mind manipulation...

161
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:10,100
...it just raises too many questions.

162
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,768
Sorry.

163
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:15,314
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.

164
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,774
All right, everyone!

165
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,192
Back to work!

166
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:20,403
We'll discuss this later!

167
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:27,285
You were supposed to understand.

168
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,708
I'll make you understand.

169
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,797
Lock.

170
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:47,430
Chair.

171
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:58,692
I saw the signal.

172
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,027
All is ready.

173
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:41,861
Commissioner?

174
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:43,196
He's at home.

175
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,533
I sent the signal.

176
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,952
What's wrong?

177
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,124
Last night at the bank I noticed
something about Two-Face:

178
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,292
His coin.

179
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,545
It's his Achilles' heel.

180
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,213
It can be exploited.

181
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,506
I know.

182
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,633
You called me for this?

183
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,718
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

184
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:09,305
I wish I could say that my interest
in you was...

185
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:11,224
...purely professional.

186
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,643
Are you trying to get under my cape?

187
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:16,689
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

188
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:19,525
It's the car, right? Chicks love it.

189
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:23,404
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

190
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:26,323
In grade school: guys with earrings.

191
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:29,243
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

192
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,412
Now...

193
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:36,625
...black rubber.

194
00:18:37,418 --> 00:18:39,670
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

195
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:45,551
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

196
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,428
We all wear masks.

197
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:50,139
My life's an open book. You read?

198
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:53,684
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

199
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:57,814
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...

200
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:01,193
...you bring your scarred psyche.

201
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,988
Direct, aren't you?

202
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:06,489
You like strong women.

203
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:08,366
I've done my homework.

204
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:11,453
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

205
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:14,956
I haven't had much luck with women.

206
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,084
Maybe you just haven't met
the right woman.

207
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:25,508
I saw the signal.

208
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:27,469
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

209
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,888
False alarm.

210
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,098
Are you sure?

211
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:52,078
Women.

212
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,839
Now I've got it!

213
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,929
"Too many questions.
There's too many questions.

214
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:11,556
"Too many...."

215
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,600
I'll show you it works!

216
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,145
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:21,441
I told you this project is terminated!
I'm calling Security!

218
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:29,700
Caffeine will kill you!

219
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,707
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

220
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,375
What are you doing?

221
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:39,626
Untie me!

222
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,169
This won't hurt.

223
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,630
At least, I don't think it will.

224
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,425
What are you doing?

225
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:49,303
You touch that switch and--

226
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:50,345
This?

227
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:07,614
Losing resolution.

228
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:09,407
More power!

229
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:34,557
Edward Nygma...

230
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:35,808
...come on down!

231
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,978
You're the next contestant on...

232
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,647
...Brain Drain!

233
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:45,236
I'll take what's inside
thick skull number one!

234
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:47,446
What have we got for him?

235
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,908
Oh, Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough!

236
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:53,619
And a breakdown? Maybe!

237
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:56,664
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

238
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:58,832
No, several geniuses.

239
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,043
A gaggle, a swarm...

240
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,796
...a flock of freaking Freuds!

241
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:07,091
Riddle me this, Fred.

242
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:09,802
What is everything to someone...

243
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:12,054
...and nothing to everyone else?

244
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:14,223
Your mind, baby!

245
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:17,269
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

246
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,646
"I'm sucking up your IQ

247
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:22,858
"Vacuuming your cortex

248
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,818
"Feeding off your brain"

249
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,345
What a rush!

250
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,224
What the hell just happened?

251
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:01,022
A very surprising side effect.

252
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:04,775
While you were mesmerized
by my 3-D TV...

253
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,738
...l utilized your neural energy
to grow smarter.

254
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:10,781
Bruce Wayne was right!

255
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:14,327
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

256
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:17,038
It is brain manipulation!

257
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,540
I'm reporting you to the FCC!

258
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:22,335
The human experimentation board!
The AMl!

259
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:23,794
And the police!

260
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:25,880
You are going up on charges...

261
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:27,715
...to court, to jail...

262
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:31,010
...and then to a mental institution
for the rest of your life!

263
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:34,096
But, first and foremost,
Nygma, you are fired!

264
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:36,265
Do you hear me? Fired!

265
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:43,774
I don't think so.

266
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:58,789
Help!

267
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:04,419
Hang on!

268
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:10,300
Babe!

269
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,302
You are fired!

270
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:14,471
Or should I say...

271
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,641
...terminated?

272
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,898
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

273
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,613
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

274
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,491
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

275
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:40,206
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?

276
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:44,043
My work raises too many questions?

277
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:47,005
Why hasn't anybody...

278
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:50,884
...put you in your place?

279
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,305
Harvey Dent,
once Gotham's District Attorney...

280
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:59,018
...was horribly scarred
by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.

281
00:24:59,184 --> 00:25:01,478
Although Batman tried to save him...

282
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:05,774
...Dent's left-brain damage
turned him into a violent criminal...

283
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:09,278
...who blamed Batman
and who has vowed to destroy him.

284
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:13,073
Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,
repeat, extremely dangerous.

285
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:14,992
That was the Commissioner.

286
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,287
There's been an accident
at Wayne Enterprises.

287
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:21,415
Horrible way to die.

288
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:23,834
The surveillance cameras are down here.

289
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:28,130
We'll dredge the river, but with
that current, I doubt we'll find the body.

290
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:32,801
Why?

291
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:34,345
Oh, why?

292
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:39,184
I just can't believe it.

293
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:42,187
Two years working in the same office.

294
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:44,940
He was like my father...

295
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,441
...my brother...

296
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:49,027
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

297
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:51,196
Get a grip, Edward.

298
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:55,158
I found this in my cubicle.

299
00:25:55,242 --> 00:25:59,704
You'll find the handwriting matches his,
as does the sentence structure.

300
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,211
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

301
00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:09,172
The memories....

302
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,718
This is last night's security log.

303
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:15,720
There's Stickley.

304
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:23,437
Pretty cut and dry.

305
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:31,487
Yes, definitely suicide.

306
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,075
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.

307
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:44,292
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.

308
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,169
Suicide's not covered
by our corporate insurance policy.

309
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,921
I know. Full benefits.

310
00:26:49,088 --> 00:26:53,092
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

311
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,344
I'll let you know. What's this?

312
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:57,347
I don't know.

313
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:59,266
I didn't see anyone.

314
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:11,445
"If you look at the numbers on my face...

315
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,947
"...you won't find 13 anyplace."

316
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:15,741
That's hideous.

317
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:17,492
What does it mean?

318
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:19,036
It's a riddle.

319
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,246
"Numbers on my face...13."

320
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,665
One through twelve.

321
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,459
The answer is a clock.

322
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:27,794
Who would send you a riddle?

323
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,630
That, Maggie...

324
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:31,340
...is the riddle.

325
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,345
Guess what I did today?

326
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:46,041
Wayne Manor.

327
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,511
See you soon.

328
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:31,046
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

329
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:03,871
I...guess I'm early.

330
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:07,583
I have an appointment.

331
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,210
I'm Bruce Wayne.

332
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:10,962
Good.

333
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:13,756
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.

334
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,675
I'm sorry.

335
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,182
You...sounded like you were in...

336
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:29,022
...you know, trouble.

337
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:34,027
I prefer healthy expressions of violence
as opposed to breaking in.

338
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:36,446
So...

339
00:30:36,822 --> 00:30:38,740
...how can I help you?

340
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:44,413
Someone's been sending me love letters.

341
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:47,374
One at my office and one at my home.

342
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:52,838
Commissioner Gordon thought
you might give me your opinion.

343
00:30:58,051 --> 00:30:59,304
A clock.

344
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,471
Clock.

345
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,311
"Tear one off and scratch my head.

346
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:10,523
"What once was red is black instead."

347
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:14,152
A match.

348
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:21,868
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

349
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,494
"Wacko?"

350
00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:25,830
Is that a technical term?

351
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:28,958
Patient may suffer from obsession...

352
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:33,171
...with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?

353
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:35,256
So, what you're saying is...

354
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,258
...this guy's a total wacko.

355
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,636
Exactly.

356
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,097
He's obsessed with you.

357
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:45,184
His only escape may be
to purge the fixation.

358
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,020
To kill me.

359
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,899
I think you understand obsession
better than you let on.

360
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,695
You like bats?

361
00:31:57,821 --> 00:31:59,782
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

362
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:01,325
An inkblot.

363
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,202
People see what they want.

364
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:06,830
The question is: do you like bats?

365
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,418
Still playing with dolls?

366
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:15,047
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

367
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:18,552
Some cultures believe she protects you
from bad dreams.

368
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:21,471
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

369
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,852
You look so sad.

370
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:30,730
Do you need one?

371
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:33,441
Me? No. Why would l?

372
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,780
You're not exactly what you seem,
are you?

373
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:42,409
What is it you really came here for?

374
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:46,413
Yikes, time's up.

375
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,292
That's usually my line.

376
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,544
I'd love to stay here chatting--

377
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:54,004
Would you?

378
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,214
I'm not so sure.

379
00:32:56,923 --> 00:32:59,468
I must get you out of those clothes.

380
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:01,804
Excuse me?

381
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:03,890
And into a black dress.

382
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:06,767
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?

383
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:27,371
Ladies and gentlemen...

384
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:30,791
...boys and girls of all ages...

385
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:33,628
...welcome to the greatest show on earth!

386
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:36,631
Who is this beautiful young woman
you're with?

387
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:38,216
Dr. Chase Meridian.

388
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,384
A doctor?

389
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,220
What kind of doctor?

390
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,555
...for Gotham Children's Hospital.

391
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,350
Let's thank our largest single donor:

392
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:48,727
Bruce Wayne!

393
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,940
Ladies and gentlemen...

394
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,734
...70 feet above the ground...

395
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:59,321
...performing feats
of unimaginable aerial skill...

396
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:01,949
...the Flying Graysons!

397
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:57,380
Listen...

398
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:01,260
...l'm going rock climbing this weekend.
Would you like to join me?

399
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:03,762
I'd like to.

400
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:06,807
I love climbing. I really love it.

401
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:08,100
But?

402
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,311
I've met someone.

403
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:14,023
That's fast work. You just moved here.

404
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:15,900
You could say he just...

405
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:18,444
...dropped out of the sky and...

406
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:19,987
...bang!

407
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:23,282
I think he felt it too.

408
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:24,617
He sure did.

409
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:25,743
What?

410
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:28,829
Who wouldn't?

411
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:31,248
Now...

412
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,043
...Richard...

413
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,629
...the youngest Flying Grayson...

414
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:39,674
...will perform the awe-inspiring...

415
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:41,134
...death drop...

416
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:44,554
...without the safety...

417
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:45,847
...of a net!

418
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:06,243
Let's go.

419
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:07,869
You'll be okay.

420
00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:44,198
Ladies...

421
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,033
...and gentlemen!

422
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:50,872
Now, the new management
of the circus invites you to forget...

423
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:53,374
...this good, wholesome fun...

424
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:56,252
...andjoin us in a celebration
of absolute chaos...

425
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:58,170
...and truejesters!

426
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:00,549
Bring it on!

427
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:02,092
Now!

428
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:16,023
Tonight, a new act for your...

429
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:20,110
...personal amazement.
We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top. "

430
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:24,406
Let us direct your attention to the ring.

431
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:28,577
Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...

432
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,872
...that's two hundred sticks of TNT.

433
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,209
And in our innocent hand...

434
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:37,294
...a radio detonator.

435
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:39,755
What do you want?

436
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:41,549
Want, Mr. Mayor?

437
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,635
One simple thing: Batman.

438
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,762
Bruised, broken, bleeding...

439
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,639
...in a word: dead!

440
00:37:52,143 --> 00:37:53,394
Batman.

441
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,605
Who do we have before us?

442
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:57,357
Gotham's finest...

443
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,858
...well-to-do...

444
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:00,068
...influential.

445
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:02,528
Surely one ofyou knows who Batman is.

446
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:06,199
Hell, odds are one ofyou pasty-faced twits
is Batman!

447
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:09,118
You have two minutes.

448
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:16,960
Harvey!

449
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,128
I'm Batman!

450
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,525
We can stop them.

451
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,901
Go out on the rigging.

452
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,735
Be careful.

453
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,028
Don't worry.

454
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,674
Go to work, boys!

455
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,323
Our kind of day.

456
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,250
Reach for it! Stop it!

457
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,467
Oh, my God.

458
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:28,281
It's good you took him in.
He hasn't anyone now.

459
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:32,076
He's filled out papers all day.
He hasn't slept or eaten.

460
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:45,674
Welcome, Master Grayson.

461
00:41:45,758 --> 00:41:46,926
I'm Alfred.

462
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:48,969
How're you doing, Al?

463
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:54,808
There's a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

464
00:41:57,144 --> 00:41:59,063
Okay, I'm out of here.

465
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:02,066
Excuse me?

466
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:04,401
Telling that cop I'd stay here...

467
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,780
...saved me a lot
of social-service interviews.

468
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:10,658
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

469
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,409
Take it easy.

470
00:42:23,964 --> 00:42:27,842
Where will you go? The circus
must be halfway to Metropolis.

471
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:29,636
Get a fix on Two-Face.

472
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:31,304
Then I'll kill him.

473
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:34,474
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

474
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:36,226
It'll make it worse.

475
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:38,353
Spare me the sermons, all right?

476
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:41,690
I don't need your advice or your charity.

477
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:44,651
Nice bike.

478
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:47,279
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

479
00:42:49,823 --> 00:42:51,825
You're almost on empty.

480
00:42:51,992 --> 00:42:55,370
Fill it up in the garage.
There's no gas station for miles.

481
00:43:03,212 --> 00:43:04,797
The pump's over here.

482
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:07,508
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

483
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:18,269
That's a 1917 Harley.

484
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:19,228
Yep.

485
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,106
Indian Classic, fully restored.

486
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,942
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

487
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:27,153
They only made a hundred.

488
00:43:27,236 --> 00:43:30,031
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.

489
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:31,908
You've got two.

490
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:33,659
That one doesn't run.

491
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,495
The throttle sticks on this one.

492
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:39,081
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

493
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,501
...these need a lot of work.

494
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:43,837
If someone were to fix them up...

495
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,631
...they could keep one.

496
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:48,717
Anyway...

497
00:43:48,884 --> 00:43:50,427
...have a nice trip.

498
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:52,846
You'll land on your feet.

499
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,518
Is the young master leaving?

500
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,937
Pity.

501
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:03,941
I'll just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

502
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:09,238
Hey, Al, wait up.

503
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:04,356
Master Bruce?

504
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:11,529
Just like my parents.

505
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,032
It's happening again.

506
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:18,536
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

507
00:46:20,455 --> 00:46:21,873
I killed them.

508
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,960
What did you say?

509
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:25,461
He killed them.

510
00:46:25,544 --> 00:46:26,754
Two-Face.

511
00:46:27,046 --> 00:46:29,298
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

512
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:30,716
No, no.

513
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:33,302
You said, "I killed them."

514
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:47,400
Take care of the kid.

515
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:49,068
Certainly, sir.

516
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,079
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

517
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,497
No.

518
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:04,084
Thanks, I won't be staying long.

519
00:47:07,254 --> 00:47:08,922
Is this a robin?

520
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:15,804
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

521
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:19,349
My father said I was his hero.

522
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:22,811
I flew in like a robin.

523
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:27,524
Some hero I turned out to be.

524
00:47:28,442 --> 00:47:30,569
But your father was right.

525
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:33,030
You are a hero. I can tell.

526
00:47:40,203 --> 00:47:43,541
Throw this away, will you?
I won't need it anymore.

527
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:48,671
I think I'll just put it in here.

528
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:57,263
Broken wings mend in time.

529
00:47:58,848 --> 00:48:01,142
One day Robin will fly again.

530
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:02,852
I promise.

531
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:26,771
We'll drive.

532
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:01,577
The Puzzler?

533
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,542
The Gamester?

534
00:51:14,716 --> 00:51:16,134
Captain Kill?

535
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:22,015
Question Mark Man?

536
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:42,577
Thank you. Thank you so much.

537
00:51:56,508 --> 00:51:59,303
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

538
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:02,890
...is driving us insane!

539
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:07,937
Don't worry, baby.

540
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:11,398
You'll kill him soon.

541
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:17,571
Besides...

542
00:52:17,947 --> 00:52:19,865
...l made your favorite:

543
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,992
Sparkling champagne and...

544
00:52:22,534 --> 00:52:26,039
...yummy poached salmon
with little quail eggs and...

545
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:28,416
...a creamy...

546
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,751
...dreamy...

547
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:31,795
...lemon souffle.

548
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:34,464
No, I made your favorite:

549
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:37,050
A charred heart of black boar...

550
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:39,844
...a side of raw donkey meat...

551
00:52:41,221 --> 00:52:44,724
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

552
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:47,394
Perfect!

553
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:49,396
Ladies, you spoil us!

554
00:52:49,563 --> 00:52:52,524
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

555
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:54,526
What?

556
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:56,236
I hope you made extra.

557
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,238
Who the hell are you?

558
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:00,824
Just a friend.

559
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:02,784
But you can call me...

560
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:05,037
...The Riddler.

561
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:11,294
I'll call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us? Talk!

562
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,965
But then if I talked, what would keep you
from slaying me, O Segregated One?

563
00:53:16,132 --> 00:53:19,635
That's never going to heal
if you don't stop picking.

564
00:53:21,137 --> 00:53:23,431
Let's see if you bleed green.

565
00:53:24,932 --> 00:53:26,976
It's not me you want to kill.

566
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:31,731
That's just too easy for someone
as powerful as you and...

567
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:33,316
...you.

568
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,401
But Batman...

569
00:53:36,986 --> 00:53:38,988
...there's a challenge.

570
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:41,824
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

571
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:47,331
But have you thought it through? A few
bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

572
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,666
Wet hands.

573
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,794
Post-homicidal depression.

574
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,967
Why not humiliate him first?

575
00:53:59,092 --> 00:53:59,885
Yeah.

576
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:03,513
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is
at his weakest...

577
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:05,307
...crush him!

578
00:54:07,684 --> 00:54:09,186
I see that...

579
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:11,772
...sparkle in your left eye.

580
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:15,108
I can help you get Batman.

581
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,863
That is, if you'll...

582
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:22,824
...spare my life for just a few moments.

583
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,672
Thank you.

584
00:54:36,381 --> 00:54:40,885
I love what you've done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.

585
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,013
Beautiful.

586
00:54:44,138 --> 00:54:46,391
It's so dark and Gothic and...

587
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:48,977
...disgustingly decadent.

588
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:53,147
Yet so bright and chipper and...

589
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:56,568
...conservative.

590
00:55:00,572 --> 00:55:02,031
It's so you!

591
00:55:03,032 --> 00:55:04,702
And yet, so you!

592
00:55:07,246 --> 00:55:10,833
Very few people are both a summer
and a winter, but...

593
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:14,044
...but you pull it off nicely.

594
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,090
What's the point?

595
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:23,512
Has anyone ever told you, you have
a serious impulse-control problem?

596
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:27,016
This is the point.

597
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:41,780
This is how I found you.

598
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:43,949
Let me demonstrate.

599
00:55:49,956 --> 00:55:52,250
This is your brain on The Box.

600
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:54,377
This is my brain on The Box.

601
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:56,880
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

602
00:55:56,963 --> 00:55:58,214
I'll have more.

603
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:02,052
There's more. But only the first one's free.

604
00:56:03,136 --> 00:56:04,763
Here's the bargain:

605
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,599
You'll help me steal production capital...

606
00:56:07,766 --> 00:56:10,602
...so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

607
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:14,439
...and become Gotham's cleverest,
carbon-based life form!

608
00:56:15,815 --> 00:56:17,484
And in return....

609
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:21,780
Is everybody paying attention?

610
00:56:21,988 --> 00:56:24,867
I will help you solve the greatest riddle
of all.

611
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:27,078
The mother of all riddles:

612
00:56:28,621 --> 00:56:29,956
Who is...

613
00:56:30,456 --> 00:56:31,832
...Batman?

614
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:36,003
You broke into our hideout.

615
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:38,798
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

616
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:41,634
We should crush your bones into powder.

617
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,095
But you pose an interesting proposition.

618
00:56:44,178 --> 00:56:48,474
Therefore, heads: we accept,
and tails: we blow your damn head off.

619
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,450
Here's a good one.

620
00:57:05,534 --> 00:57:06,952
No, no, no!

621
00:57:07,828 --> 00:57:09,663
There is a good one.

622
00:57:11,164 --> 00:57:15,210
-Leave that. I'll attend to it.
-I'm not used to being waited on.

623
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:41,904
Don't shoot me!

624
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:44,489
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

625
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:50,371
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

626
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,833
It's dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...

627
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,627
...and assert yourself.

628
00:57:57,253 --> 00:57:59,505
That looks fun. Let me try.

629
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:03,551
Ball up the fist, reach way back...
assert yourself.

630
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:11,643
One hundred thousand,
two hundred and twenty.

631
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,561
One hundred and....

632
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:15,230
I lost count!

633
00:58:17,106 --> 00:58:21,527
Last night another robbery,
perpetrated by the Green-Suited Menace...

634
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:25,324
...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,
with no sign of Batman.

635
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,244
Teamed with Two-Face,
this new criminal's pattern...

636
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:32,665
...of marking his crimes with puzzles
has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.

637
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,460
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

638
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:39,129
That was with the morning mail.

639
00:58:41,215 --> 00:58:43,175
"The eight of us go forth, not back.

640
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:45,886
"To protect our king from the foe's attack."

641
00:58:47,263 --> 00:58:48,222
Chess pawns.

642
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:49,390
Clock.

643
00:58:49,598 --> 00:58:50,307
Matches.

644
00:58:50,391 --> 00:58:52,226
All physical, man-made objects.

645
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:54,436
Small in size, light in weight.

646
00:58:54,728 --> 00:58:56,105
What's the connection?

647
00:58:56,188 --> 00:58:59,900
With all due respect,
that's why they call him The Riddler.

648
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,154
May I help you?

649
00:59:04,572 --> 00:59:06,825
Why is this the only locked door?

650
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:09,077
What's back there?

651
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:11,371
Master Wayne's dead wives.

652
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:14,749
The silver closet. On your way.

653
00:59:18,336 --> 00:59:20,922
Now, you can be part of the action!

654
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:26,970
Nygma Tech brings thejoy
of 3-D entertainment into your home!

655
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:30,098
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...

656
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:32,267
...my vision.

657
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:36,187
The Box in every home in America...

658
00:59:36,688 --> 00:59:38,481
...and one day, the world!

659
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,943
In local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...

660
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,487
...has become the rage of Gotham.

661
00:59:44,696 --> 00:59:48,784
Rioting occurred last night
at electronic stores that were sold out.

662
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,914
There is hardly a home
without the Nygma Tech Box.

663
00:59:53,664 --> 00:59:56,751
Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites
into zombies.

664
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:58,669
But Edward Nygmajust shrugs.

665
00:59:58,753 --> 01:00:01,756
"That's what they said
when TV was invented. "

666
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:46,176
Master Dick!

667
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:48,845
Up here.

668
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,932
Just checking, young sir.

669
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:23,464
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

670
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:54,622
I have something for you. It's on the table.

671
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:56,749
I hope you like it.

672
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:09,720
Call it clinical intuition.

673
01:02:10,596 --> 01:02:13,057
I thought your dreams needed changing.

674
01:02:16,226 --> 01:02:18,604
My parents were murdered before me...

675
01:02:18,812 --> 01:02:20,481
...when I was a kid.

676
01:02:23,484 --> 01:02:24,818
I don't...

677
01:02:25,361 --> 01:02:28,281
...remember a lot of what happened, but...

678
01:02:29,824 --> 01:02:32,994
...what I do comes to me in my dreams.
Flashes.

679
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:37,624
There's a new element now, though,
I haven't seen before.

680
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,001
It's a red leather book.

681
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:43,255
Something else....

682
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:46,299
My dreams come to me
when I'm awake now.

683
01:02:47,634 --> 01:02:50,637
Bruce, you're describing
repressed memories.

684
01:02:51,429 --> 01:02:54,891
Images of a forgotten pain
that's trying to surface.

685
01:02:57,978 --> 01:02:59,771
I'll be right back.

686
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:24,130
Is it possible there's an aspect
of your parents' death you haven't faced?

687
01:03:24,297 --> 01:03:26,632
You were so young when it happened.

688
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,261
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

689
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:35,224
This goes way beyond taking
your work home, doesn't it?

690
01:03:38,477 --> 01:03:39,604
All right.

691
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:43,566
I think he's fascinating.

692
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:45,484
Clinically.

693
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:47,696
Why does a man do this?

694
01:03:48,906 --> 01:03:51,408
It's as if he's cursed to pay a penance.

695
01:03:51,575 --> 01:03:55,704
What crime could he have committed
to deserve a life of nightly torture?

696
01:03:56,914 --> 01:03:58,582
It's more than just...

697
01:03:59,499 --> 01:04:02,294
...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

698
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:04,963
Bruce, are you jealous?

699
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:06,798
No.

700
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:10,093
I can't be jealous of Batman.

701
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:14,473
I want to be close,
but you won't let me near.

702
01:04:16,308 --> 01:04:18,393
What are you protecting me from?

703
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,480
Do you want to know me?

704
01:04:22,314 --> 01:04:24,274
Do you want to know who I am?

705
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:27,445
I guess...

706
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:30,198
...we're all two people.

707
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:34,661
The one in daylight,
and the one we keep in shadow.

708
01:04:35,954 --> 01:04:37,205
Rage...

709
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:38,831
...violence...

710
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,209
...passion.

711
01:04:45,463 --> 01:04:46,673
Excuse me.

712
01:04:48,341 --> 01:04:49,509
I'm busy.

713
01:04:49,676 --> 01:04:53,846
I'm sorry to bother you.
I have some distressing news about Dick.

714
01:04:54,305 --> 01:04:55,390
Is he okay?

715
01:04:55,473 --> 01:04:58,393
I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.

716
01:04:59,435 --> 01:05:00,687
He ran away?

717
01:05:00,979 --> 01:05:03,106
Actually, he took the car.

718
01:05:04,357 --> 01:05:05,858
He boosted the Jag?

719
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:07,486
Not the Jaguar.

720
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,029
The other car.

721
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,239
The Bentley?

722
01:05:10,322 --> 01:05:11,490
No, sir.

723
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,200
The other car.

724
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:47,736
Come for a little ride
in my love machine, babies?

725
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:54,743
It's Batman!

726
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,536
Open up, Batman.

727
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,205
Wait!

728
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,832
That's not Batman!

729
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,292
What do you mean?

730
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,919
That's Batboy!

731
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:06,254
It ain't the Bat!

732
01:06:29,528 --> 01:06:30,947
Let her go!

733
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,373
Who the hell are you?

734
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:42,083
I'm Batman.

735
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:46,587
I forgot my suit, all right?

736
01:07:26,795 --> 01:07:28,297
Come on, run!

737
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:30,882
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

738
01:07:33,302 --> 01:07:34,052
Go!

739
01:07:34,136 --> 01:07:35,887
Thanks, you saved my life!

740
01:07:36,138 --> 01:07:39,141
I could definitely get
into this superhero gig.

741
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:04,542
Batman!

742
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:19,599
Bastard!

743
01:08:19,974 --> 01:08:21,684
It should've been you!

744
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:25,480
If you had told Two-Face who you were
at the circus...

745
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:27,691
...they'd still be alive!

746
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,865
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life
for your family, he would have.

747
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:43,958
All I can think about every day
is getting Two-Face.

748
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:47,044
He took my whole life.

749
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:51,257
When I was out there tonight...

750
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,592
...l imagined it was him I was fighting...

751
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:55,844
...even when I was fighting you...

752
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:58,764
...and the pain went away.

753
01:09:00,224 --> 01:09:01,725
Do you understand?

754
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:03,185
Yes, I do.

755
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:04,603
Good.

756
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:07,022
You must help me find him.

757
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:09,150
When we do...

758
01:09:09,401 --> 01:09:11,361
...l'm the one who kills him.

759
01:09:12,737 --> 01:09:15,240
So, you're willing to take a life?

760
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:17,951
As long as it's Two-Face.

761
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:23,206
Then it will happen this way:

762
01:09:24,416 --> 01:09:25,959
You make the kill.

763
01:09:27,419 --> 01:09:30,547
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey,
it grows.

764
01:09:30,714 --> 01:09:34,551
So you run into the night
to find another face, and another...

765
01:09:35,093 --> 01:09:36,511
...and another...

766
01:09:37,304 --> 01:09:40,724
...until one terrible morning
you wake up and realize...

767
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:43,560
...that revenge has become
your whole life...

768
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,812
...and you won't know why.

769
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:48,899
You can't understand.

770
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,777
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

771
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:54,614
Yes, they were.

772
01:09:55,823 --> 01:09:57,325
We're the same.

773
01:09:57,742 --> 01:10:01,704
If we're the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.

774
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:05,541
No.

775
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,293
I can't.

776
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:10,087
You still have a choice.

777
01:10:10,838 --> 01:10:12,048
Look, Bruce...

778
01:10:12,256 --> 01:10:15,176
...l'm a part of this, whether you like it
or not.

779
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:37,074
Tonight all of Gotham society
has turned out for Edward Nygma's...

780
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:40,410
...gala unveiling of his New lmproved Box.

781
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,788
Thanks, Al.

782
01:10:42,955 --> 01:10:44,039
My pleasure, sir.

783
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:46,750
They'll be dining
and dancing the night away...

784
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,836
...on the glamorous roof
of the Ritz Gotham.

785
01:11:01,014 --> 01:11:04,643
What's it like to have your face
on the cover of every magazine?

786
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:10,275
Edward, how does it feel to be
the city's newest, most-eligible bachelor?

787
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:12,694
Gotham must know!

788
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:15,488
There's Bruce Wayne!

789
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:17,490
Brucie!

790
01:11:18,992 --> 01:11:21,119
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

791
01:11:22,704 --> 01:11:24,998
How come you don't look so good
in that suit?

792
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:27,417
Shut up. You're here to work!

793
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:29,294
How's my mole?

794
01:11:29,377 --> 01:11:30,545
Fine.

795
01:11:31,004 --> 01:11:34,007
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech
takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

796
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,427
Nygma Tech stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises two to one.

797
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,929
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

798
01:11:41,389 --> 01:11:42,974
Bruce, old man.

799
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:48,397
The press wonders what it's like
to be outsold, outclassed, out-coifed and...

800
01:11:49,148 --> 01:11:51,317
...generally outdone in every way.

801
01:11:52,151 --> 01:11:54,236
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

802
01:11:54,695 --> 01:11:56,739
Great party. Nice suit.

803
01:11:57,364 --> 01:11:58,782
Wit. Good.

804
01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:01,452
And you are?

805
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,453
Chase.

806
01:12:04,204 --> 01:12:06,916
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

807
01:12:09,877 --> 01:12:11,629
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

808
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,674
You can call me anything you want.

809
01:12:17,551 --> 01:12:19,261
Ladies and gentlemen...

810
01:12:19,595 --> 01:12:21,138
...the future!

811
01:12:21,597 --> 01:12:25,893
My New lmproved Box offers
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

812
01:12:46,206 --> 01:12:48,833
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

813
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,587
How do you create these images, hon?

814
01:12:53,129 --> 01:12:55,715
That, my dear, is my little secret.

815
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:05,225
Fully-interactive holographs.

816
01:13:05,392 --> 01:13:08,813
Only a high-frequency carrier wave,
beamed into the brain...

817
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,648
...could create such images.

818
01:13:10,731 --> 01:13:12,775
And you wish you thought of it.

819
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:15,152
Don't be a sore loser.

820
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:17,488
Step inside. Give it a try.

821
01:13:19,907 --> 01:13:23,578
If you can introduce images into the mind,
what stops you from...

822
01:13:23,744 --> 01:13:26,163
...extracting images out of the mind?

823
01:13:28,082 --> 01:13:30,668
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

824
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:35,506
Shall we dance?

825
01:13:56,695 --> 01:13:58,405
Naughty, naughty.

826
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:00,866
Looking for something?

827
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:03,910
I was just wondering how you turn it off.

828
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:08,624
Clever.

829
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:10,626
Thanks.

830
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,127
My pleasure.

831
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,159
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.

832
01:14:44,577 --> 01:14:45,787
Relax.

833
01:14:48,164 --> 01:14:49,749
Tell me your...

834
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:51,918
...dreams.

835
01:14:53,586 --> 01:14:54,921
Tell me...

836
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:56,839
...your fantasies.

837
01:14:58,508 --> 01:15:00,385
Tell me your secrets.

838
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:04,347
Tell me...

839
01:15:05,515 --> 01:15:07,267
...your deepest...

840
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,851
...darkest...

841
01:15:09,186 --> 01:15:10,521
...fears.

842
01:15:41,218 --> 01:15:42,553
Relax, folks!

843
01:15:42,803 --> 01:15:45,889
It's only an old-fashioned, low-tech stickup!

844
01:15:46,223 --> 01:15:48,225
We're interested in the basics:

845
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,937
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

846
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:55,567
Hand them over nice and quietly,
and no one will be hurt!

847
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:02,324
Emergency, Alfred.

848
01:16:03,074 --> 01:16:04,367
Yes, sir.

849
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:08,079
Be calm, everybody!

850
01:16:08,246 --> 01:16:09,664
Just stay calm!

851
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:11,207
Excuse me!

852
01:16:14,586 --> 01:16:17,589
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?

853
01:16:18,381 --> 01:16:21,092
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver Batman.

854
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,261
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

855
01:16:23,386 --> 01:16:25,513
Patience, hell! We want him dead!

856
01:16:25,597 --> 01:16:29,309
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem!

857
01:16:29,393 --> 01:16:31,938
You could have let me in on the caper.

858
01:16:32,104 --> 01:16:36,275
We could have organized it, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights!

859
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:52,291
Your entrance was good, his was better.

860
01:17:00,633 --> 01:17:01,884
The difference?

861
01:17:01,968 --> 01:17:03,427
Showmanship!

862
01:17:10,978 --> 01:17:12,396
Emergency, Alfred.

863
01:17:12,521 --> 01:17:13,939
Oh, sir....

864
01:17:14,398 --> 01:17:16,400
I could be fired for this.

865
01:17:17,442 --> 01:17:20,362
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

866
01:17:32,249 --> 01:17:34,501
All right, boys! Phase Two!

867
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:40,549
My place, midnight.

868
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,959
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

869
01:19:27,826 --> 01:19:29,536
Why can't you just die?

870
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,674
Hi.

871
01:20:30,599 --> 01:20:32,225
What were you doing?

872
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:35,187
You got a real gratitude problem,
you know that?

873
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,856
I need a name. Batboy? Knight Wing?

874
01:20:38,398 --> 01:20:40,567
What's a good sidekick name?

875
01:20:40,776 --> 01:20:42,861
"Dick Grayson, college student."

876
01:20:42,945 --> 01:20:44,071
Screw you!

877
01:20:44,237 --> 01:20:46,281
I saved your life. You owe me.

878
01:20:46,448 --> 01:20:48,700
You're going to get yourself killed.

879
01:20:48,909 --> 01:20:50,160
I'm your new partner.

880
01:20:50,243 --> 01:20:51,286
No!

881
01:20:51,912 --> 01:20:56,458
Whenever you go out at night, I'll be
watching. Where Batman goes, I'll go.

882
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:58,502
How will you stop me?

883
01:20:59,169 --> 01:21:00,712
I can stop you.

884
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,344
Hang this next to the Batsuit...

885
01:21:07,427 --> 01:21:08,971
...where it belongs.

886
01:21:13,476 --> 01:21:15,478
You're encouraging him.

887
01:21:16,646 --> 01:21:20,316
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

888
01:21:20,608 --> 01:21:22,318
They need guidance.

889
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:28,116
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

890
01:21:35,748 --> 01:21:38,501
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

891
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:42,130
Perhaps the lady is just
what the doctor ordered.

892
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,424
She seems lovely and wise.

893
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,343
I've never been in love before.

894
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:49,596
Go to her.

895
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:52,808
Tell her how you feel.

896
01:21:53,017 --> 01:21:55,561
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

897
01:21:56,353 --> 01:21:57,688
Let her decide.

898
01:22:51,743 --> 01:22:53,078
I'm sorry.

899
01:22:55,205 --> 01:22:57,040
I can't believe this.

900
01:22:57,832 --> 01:23:01,044
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

901
01:23:01,378 --> 01:23:02,837
Your eyes...

902
01:23:03,755 --> 01:23:05,257
...your lips...

903
01:23:06,758 --> 01:23:08,134
...your body.

904
01:23:10,303 --> 01:23:12,181
Now I have you and...

905
01:23:13,891 --> 01:23:16,560
...l'm wishing you were somebody else.

906
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:24,735
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

907
01:23:26,862 --> 01:23:28,572
I've met someone.

908
01:23:34,328 --> 01:23:35,705
He's not you.

909
01:23:38,124 --> 01:23:40,209
I hope you can understand.

910
01:23:45,548 --> 01:23:47,049
I understand.

911
01:23:52,139 --> 01:23:53,348
Well....

912
01:24:15,495 --> 01:24:17,497
That's just what I said.

913
01:24:18,248 --> 01:24:20,876
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

914
01:24:21,668 --> 01:24:23,670
How to map the human mind.

915
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,549
Would you like to see
what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

916
01:24:41,397 --> 01:24:42,982
Riddle me this:

917
01:24:43,858 --> 01:24:45,610
What kind of man...

918
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:47,862
...has bats on the brain?

919
01:24:51,616 --> 01:24:54,285
-Go ahead. You can say it.
-You're a genius.

920
01:24:54,452 --> 01:24:55,787
Oh, stop.

921
01:24:59,415 --> 01:25:01,417
So, from this day on...

922
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,795
...Batman is no more.

923
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:07,715
You can't just quit.

924
01:25:07,882 --> 01:25:11,219
There's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.

925
01:25:11,302 --> 01:25:14,890
I've dedicated my life to helping strangers
I've never met.

926
01:25:15,432 --> 01:25:17,351
Faces I've never seen.

927
01:25:17,726 --> 01:25:18,894
Well...

928
01:25:19,436 --> 01:25:21,939
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

929
01:25:22,815 --> 01:25:25,734
You can't tell me what to do
with the rest of my life.

930
01:25:25,818 --> 01:25:28,904
My dad told me that every man goes
his own way.

931
01:25:29,029 --> 01:25:31,073
My way goes to Two-Face.

932
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:33,158
You must help me.

933
01:25:33,742 --> 01:25:35,744
And if you do find Harvey...

934
01:25:35,995 --> 01:25:37,496
...and then you kill him...

935
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:38,831
...what next?

936
01:25:42,668 --> 01:25:43,752
Exactly.

937
01:25:44,503 --> 01:25:46,797
Then you'd be alone, like me.

938
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:51,594
No, you must let this go.

939
01:25:52,053 --> 01:25:53,847
Listen to me, I'm your friend.

940
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:56,516
I don't need a friend, I need a partner.

941
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,685
Two-Face has got to pay.

942
01:26:00,186 --> 01:26:01,271
Please.

943
01:26:03,523 --> 01:26:06,985
Chase is coming for dinner.
I'm going to tell her...

944
01:26:07,944 --> 01:26:09,195
...everything.

945
01:26:11,489 --> 01:26:13,366
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

946
01:26:28,506 --> 01:26:30,425
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

947
01:26:31,384 --> 01:26:32,720
Happy Halloween.

948
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,639
Happy Halloween to you.

949
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:13,512
I asked you here tonight because
there's something I wanted to tell you.

950
01:27:14,346 --> 01:27:16,682
I wanted to tell you something too.

951
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:18,433
What I wanted--

952
01:27:19,559 --> 01:27:21,270
Go ahead, you first.

953
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:27,734
Trick or treat!

954
01:27:29,695 --> 01:27:31,822
All my life I have been...

955
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:35,033
...attracted to a certain kind of man.

956
01:27:35,158 --> 01:27:36,451
The wrong kind.

957
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:39,329
Look at what I do for a living.

958
01:27:42,582 --> 01:27:43,959
And since...

959
01:27:44,167 --> 01:27:46,211
...since I met you, I....

960
01:27:48,714 --> 01:27:50,007
Oh, God.

961
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,302
Why am I so nervous?

962
01:28:00,184 --> 01:28:03,980
Don't eat too much tonight
or you'll be sick in your beds.

963
01:28:35,429 --> 01:28:37,097
Happy Halloween!

964
01:28:51,111 --> 01:28:52,529
What's wrong?

965
01:28:53,656 --> 01:28:55,074
It's happening again.

966
01:28:55,157 --> 01:28:56,450
Flashes.

967
01:28:57,159 --> 01:28:58,786
My parents' death.

968
01:28:59,954 --> 01:29:02,456
Your memories are trying
to break through.

969
01:29:02,539 --> 01:29:04,500
I want to tell you something.

970
01:29:04,625 --> 01:29:06,543
Something I've never told anyone.

971
01:29:06,627 --> 01:29:07,920
It's all right.

972
01:29:08,128 --> 01:29:09,922
It's all right. I'm here.

973
01:29:16,179 --> 01:29:17,514
I'm here.

974
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,187
The night of my parents' wake...

975
01:29:24,896 --> 01:29:27,399
...the priest's words gave no comfort.

976
01:29:29,192 --> 01:29:30,568
Of course.

977
01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:33,989
There, on my father's desk...

978
01:29:34,155 --> 01:29:35,824
...the red book.

979
01:29:36,074 --> 01:29:37,534
Hisjournal.

980
01:29:37,909 --> 01:29:39,995
He'd written in it every day.

981
01:29:40,829 --> 01:29:43,206
But now he'd never write in it again.

982
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:45,917
At that moment I knew...

983
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:48,169
...my life would never be the same.

984
01:29:55,011 --> 01:29:57,305
I raced out into the storm...

985
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,932
...trying to outrun the rage.

986
01:30:00,099 --> 01:30:01,267
The pain.

987
01:30:02,226 --> 01:30:03,686
Then I fell.

988
01:30:05,605 --> 01:30:07,189
I fell forever.

989
01:30:09,233 --> 01:30:11,235
The cave was monstrous.

990
01:30:12,528 --> 01:30:14,905
It must have been there for centuries.

991
01:30:17,033 --> 01:30:18,242
And there...

992
01:30:19,035 --> 01:30:20,786
...deep in the shadows...

993
01:30:22,246 --> 01:30:23,539
...l saw....

994
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:28,002
It was coming toward me.

995
01:30:28,794 --> 01:30:31,631
I was scared at first, but only at first.

996
01:30:33,216 --> 01:30:35,886
The figure in the dark was my destiny.

997
01:30:37,137 --> 01:30:39,348
It would change my life forever.

998
01:30:41,558 --> 01:30:46,146
I would use its image to strike terror
into the hearts of those who did evil.

999
01:30:46,271 --> 01:30:50,692
I would ensure what happened to me
would never happen to anyone else.

1000
01:30:51,818 --> 01:30:53,654
I would have my revenge.

1001
01:30:57,491 --> 01:30:59,743
What are you trying to tell me?

1002
01:31:02,162 --> 01:31:03,246
I'm....

1003
01:31:38,116 --> 01:31:39,701
Twick or tweet!

1004
01:31:46,874 --> 01:31:48,084
Trick.

1005
01:31:55,217 --> 01:31:56,719
Remember the plan?

1006
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:58,637
Seize and capture.

1007
01:31:59,346 --> 01:32:00,472
No killing.

1008
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:02,641
That goes double for you.

1009
01:32:05,352 --> 01:32:07,354
If I was a superhero...

1010
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:10,149
...where would I hide?

1011
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:16,447
Spank me.

1012
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,879
Intruder alert! lntruder alert!

1013
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,093
Intruder alert! lntruder alert!

1014
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:38,595
Shut up!

1015
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:51,316
Now, that's impressive!

1016
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:11,002
It's always risky introducing
a tamed animal into the wild.

1017
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:28,980
They may have trouble adapting
to their new environment.

1018
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:09,229
Somebody tell the fat lady...

1019
01:34:09,396 --> 01:34:11,189
...she's on in five.

1020
01:34:29,499 --> 01:34:30,792
"Joygasm! "

1021
01:34:53,691 --> 01:34:55,193
Get the girl!

1022
01:35:06,579 --> 01:35:08,164
Don't kill him.

1023
01:35:10,124 --> 01:35:11,751
If you kill him...

1024
01:35:20,594 --> 01:35:22,388
...he won't learn nothing.

1025
01:35:57,799 --> 01:35:59,301
Master Bruce!

1026
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:08,977
How are you, young man?

1027
01:36:10,353 --> 01:36:13,315
You haven't called me that for a long time.

1028
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:15,442
Old habits die hard.

1029
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:17,777
Are you all right?

1030
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:19,821
Where's Chase?

1031
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:22,157
I'm afraid they've taken her.

1032
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:24,534
Master Dick has run away.

1033
01:36:25,201 --> 01:36:27,120
The cave has been destroyed.

1034
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:30,165
And there's another riddle.

1035
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:42,678
I'm coming, my sweet.

1036
01:36:47,516 --> 01:36:48,893
Like the jacket?

1037
01:36:49,226 --> 01:36:51,228
It keeps me safe when I'm...

1038
01:36:51,395 --> 01:36:53,189
...jogging at night.

1039
01:36:54,106 --> 01:36:55,816
Batman will come for me.

1040
01:36:57,109 --> 01:36:58,361
Batman?

1041
01:36:59,528 --> 01:37:01,197
Batman, you say?

1042
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:03,991
Coming for you?

1043
01:37:07,411 --> 01:37:08,621
I'm...

1044
01:37:09,246 --> 01:37:10,706
...counting on it.

1045
01:37:15,712 --> 01:37:18,382
What is that? Where's it coming from?

1046
01:37:19,591 --> 01:37:20,550
There!

1047
01:37:20,884 --> 01:37:22,594
Who's doing that?

1048
01:37:22,928 --> 01:37:24,388
The Riddler!

1049
01:37:25,514 --> 01:37:28,600
"We're five little items of an everyday sort.

1050
01:37:30,268 --> 01:37:32,854
"You'll find us all in a tennis court."

1051
01:37:33,355 --> 01:37:34,439
In....

1052
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,066
A-E-l-O-U.

1053
01:37:37,276 --> 01:37:38,277
Vowels.

1054
01:37:38,443 --> 01:37:40,112
Not entirely unclever, sir.

1055
01:37:40,195 --> 01:37:42,948
But what do a clock, a match,
chess pawns...

1056
01:37:43,031 --> 01:37:46,451
...and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?

1057
01:37:46,618 --> 01:37:49,788
Every riddle contains a number
and they arrived in this order:

1058
01:37:49,871 --> 01:37:51,290
13, 1, 8...

1059
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:53,458
...and 5.

1060
01:37:53,542 --> 01:37:55,128
13, 1, 8 and 5.

1061
01:37:56,462 --> 01:37:57,463
Meaning?

1062
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:59,340
Letters of the alphabet?

1063
01:37:59,632 --> 01:38:01,426
Of course, 13 is M.

1064
01:38:01,718 --> 01:38:04,721
1 would be A, 8 would be H
and 5 would be E.

1065
01:38:05,388 --> 01:38:06,681
M-A-H-E.

1066
01:38:08,224 --> 01:38:10,226
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

1067
01:38:11,561 --> 01:38:12,854
18 is R.

1068
01:38:14,063 --> 01:38:15,189
M-R-E.

1069
01:38:17,734 --> 01:38:18,901
How about...

1070
01:38:18,985 --> 01:38:20,403
..."Mr. E"?

1071
01:38:20,653 --> 01:38:22,822
-Mystery?
-Another name for mystery?

1072
01:38:22,905 --> 01:38:23,906
Enigma.

1073
01:38:24,407 --> 01:38:25,908
Mr. E. Nygma.

1074
01:38:26,659 --> 01:38:27,994
Edward Nygma.

1075
01:38:28,411 --> 01:38:32,415
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

1076
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:36,045
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

1077
01:38:36,754 --> 01:38:38,797
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

1078
01:38:39,006 --> 01:38:43,802
All except the prototype with the sonar
modifications. But it's not tested.

1079
01:38:44,678 --> 01:38:46,388
Tonight's a good night.

1080
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:00,736
What do you suggest? By sea...

1081
01:39:02,363 --> 01:39:03,822
...or by air?

1082
01:39:08,827 --> 01:39:10,037
Why not both?

1083
01:39:19,047 --> 01:39:20,465
Who's your tailor?

1084
01:39:20,548 --> 01:39:22,592
I took the liberty, sir.

1085
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:26,513
"R?"

1086
01:39:26,805 --> 01:39:28,473
What's that stand for?

1087
01:39:30,392 --> 01:39:31,393
Robin.

1088
01:39:32,852 --> 01:39:35,730
Riddler and Two-Face can make
a pretty lethal combination.

1089
01:39:35,814 --> 01:39:37,399
You could use a hand.

1090
01:39:37,649 --> 01:39:39,734
Two against two are better odds.

1091
01:39:40,318 --> 01:39:42,654
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

1092
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,573
"A man's got to go his own way."

1093
01:39:45,865 --> 01:39:47,575
A friend taught me that.

1094
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:49,995
Not just a friend.

1095
01:39:52,497 --> 01:39:53,873
A partner.

1096
01:40:27,116 --> 01:40:28,784
He's not coming.

1097
01:40:29,368 --> 01:40:30,870
Shut it down.

1098
01:40:41,131 --> 01:40:43,467
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1099
01:40:49,556 --> 01:40:50,849
Hey, go!

1100
01:41:22,382 --> 01:41:23,549
A-14.

1101
01:41:29,263 --> 01:41:30,014
Hit!

1102
01:41:30,098 --> 01:41:31,057
Sweet!

1103
01:41:31,891 --> 01:41:32,850
B-12.

1104
01:41:36,854 --> 01:41:37,897
Hit!

1105
01:41:38,398 --> 01:41:39,941
My favorite vitamin.

1106
01:41:49,909 --> 01:41:51,786
That sinking feeling.

1107
01:41:51,995 --> 01:41:53,329
I like this game.

1108
01:41:53,413 --> 01:41:54,539
C-9.

1109
01:42:05,467 --> 01:42:07,469
You sunk my battleship!

1110
01:42:08,304 --> 01:42:09,596
Who, me?

1111
01:42:34,246 --> 01:42:35,874
This is your captain speaking.

1112
01:42:35,957 --> 01:42:40,045
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.

1113
01:42:47,844 --> 01:42:49,220
I got him!

1114
01:42:56,061 --> 01:42:58,772
I hope they can find the little black box.

1115
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:45,111
Now...

1116
01:43:47,113 --> 01:43:49,156
...the real game begins.

1117
01:43:56,915 --> 01:43:58,709
Holy rusted metal, Batman!

1118
01:44:00,752 --> 01:44:02,504
The ground, it's all metal.

1119
01:44:02,587 --> 01:44:04,673
It's full of holes: holey.

1120
01:44:10,012 --> 01:44:11,179
Wait!

1121
01:44:13,432 --> 01:44:15,434
The whole island's moving!

1122
01:45:01,564 --> 01:45:03,149
Looking for us?

1123
01:45:07,987 --> 01:45:09,697
That was for my mother!

1124
01:45:10,114 --> 01:45:11,240
My father!

1125
01:45:14,118 --> 01:45:15,328
My brother!

1126
01:45:16,497 --> 01:45:18,123
And this is for me!

1127
01:45:49,738 --> 01:45:51,907
Finally, justice is served!

1128
01:45:53,409 --> 01:45:54,827
Let us die!

1129
01:46:03,628 --> 01:46:06,256
You're a man after our own heart, son!

1130
01:46:06,548 --> 01:46:08,383
I'll see you in hell!

1131
01:46:14,556 --> 01:46:16,391
I'd rather see you in jail!

1132
01:46:20,729 --> 01:46:22,772
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

1133
01:46:23,398 --> 01:46:25,108
The Bat's taught you well.

1134
01:46:25,191 --> 01:46:26,276
Noble.

1135
01:46:26,443 --> 01:46:27,777
Stupid...

1136
01:46:28,403 --> 01:46:29,779
...but noble.

1137
01:47:14,325 --> 01:47:15,910
Riddle me this.

1138
01:47:16,452 --> 01:47:18,038
Riddle me that.

1139
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:20,874
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

1140
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,710
No more tricks, Edward.

1141
01:47:24,127 --> 01:47:25,712
Very well, then.

1142
01:47:30,467 --> 01:47:32,010
Let's get real.

1143
01:47:32,469 --> 01:47:34,888
Release Chase. This is between you
and me.

1144
01:47:34,972 --> 01:47:36,056
And me...

1145
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:37,557
...and me!

1146
01:47:40,644 --> 01:47:45,482
You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and
now you've devised a way to read minds.

1147
01:47:47,734 --> 01:47:49,027
You betcha!

1148
01:47:49,277 --> 01:47:53,407
Soon my little Box will be
on countless TV's around the world...

1149
01:47:54,157 --> 01:47:56,743
...feeding me credit-card numbers...

1150
01:47:56,868 --> 01:47:58,538
...bank codes...

1151
01:47:58,746 --> 01:48:00,540
...sexual fantasies...

1152
01:48:00,748 --> 01:48:02,834
...and little white lies.

1153
01:48:03,501 --> 01:48:05,545
Into my head they'll go.

1154
01:48:05,878 --> 01:48:07,797
Victory is inevitable.

1155
01:48:08,673 --> 01:48:10,758
For if knowledge is power...

1156
01:48:11,843 --> 01:48:13,511
...then a god...

1157
01:48:13,678 --> 01:48:14,679
...am...

1158
01:48:15,763 --> 01:48:16,889
...l!

1159
01:48:23,521 --> 01:48:26,316
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

1160
01:48:29,694 --> 01:48:32,530
By the way, I've seen your mind. Freak!

1161
01:48:33,323 --> 01:48:35,283
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!

1162
01:48:35,366 --> 01:48:38,495
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

1163
01:48:39,872 --> 01:48:41,540
We'll find out today!

1164
01:48:42,791 --> 01:48:45,544
But first, let's meet our contestants.

1165
01:48:46,587 --> 01:48:48,297
Behind curtain...

1166
01:48:49,214 --> 01:48:50,883
...number one...

1167
01:48:54,094 --> 01:48:57,222
...the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian!

1168
01:48:58,557 --> 01:49:00,184
She enjoys hiking, manicures...

1169
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:03,854
...and foolishly hopes to be the love
of Bruce's life.

1170
01:49:09,818 --> 01:49:11,737
Behind curtain number two...

1171
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:17,284
..."Fatman's" one and only partner.

1172
01:49:17,744 --> 01:49:19,704
This acrobat turned orphan...

1173
01:49:19,829 --> 01:49:23,500
...likes Saturday-morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

1174
01:49:23,625 --> 01:49:25,752
...bare-naked with a girl.

1175
01:49:29,422 --> 01:49:31,633
And below these contestants...

1176
01:49:31,841 --> 01:49:33,843
...my personal favorite:

1177
01:49:34,094 --> 01:49:35,679
A watery grave.

1178
01:49:38,306 --> 01:49:40,016
Just one little touch...

1179
01:49:40,433 --> 01:49:43,603
...and five seconds later
these two players are...

1180
01:49:43,853 --> 01:49:45,939
...gull feed on the rocks below.

1181
01:49:48,858 --> 01:49:51,027
Not enough time to save them both.

1182
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:57,284
Which one will it be, Batman?

1183
01:49:57,450 --> 01:49:58,786
Bruce's love?

1184
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:01,747
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

1185
01:50:04,667 --> 01:50:07,795
There is no way for me to save them
or myself.

1186
01:50:08,421 --> 01:50:10,756
It's all one giant death-trap.

1187
01:50:11,173 --> 01:50:12,341
Judges?

1188
01:50:13,634 --> 01:50:16,387
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

1189
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:18,222
But thank you for playing.

1190
01:50:18,306 --> 01:50:19,223
Wait!

1191
01:50:20,683 --> 01:50:22,101
I have a riddle for you.

1192
01:50:22,184 --> 01:50:23,352
For me?

1193
01:50:25,187 --> 01:50:26,439
Really?

1194
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:30,943
Tell me.

1195
01:50:34,655 --> 01:50:36,240
I see without seeing.

1196
01:50:37,033 --> 01:50:39,911
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

1197
01:50:41,663 --> 01:50:42,789
What am l?

1198
01:50:44,207 --> 01:50:45,459
Please!

1199
01:50:46,168 --> 01:50:48,253
You're as blind as a bat!

1200
01:50:49,046 --> 01:50:50,088
Exactly.

1201
01:51:27,251 --> 01:51:28,503
Bummer!

1202
01:52:33,027 --> 01:52:34,153
Thanks.

1203
01:52:48,251 --> 01:52:50,170
All those heroics for nothing.

1204
01:52:50,253 --> 01:52:53,048
No more riddles, no more curtains one
and two.

1205
01:52:53,256 --> 01:52:55,050
Just plain curtains!

1206
01:52:57,093 --> 01:52:59,179
Aren't you forgetting something?

1207
01:52:59,346 --> 01:53:00,513
Your coin.

1208
01:53:02,432 --> 01:53:04,267
You're always of two minds.

1209
01:53:05,644 --> 01:53:07,646
Yes, of course. You're right.

1210
01:53:08,271 --> 01:53:10,857
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

1211
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:13,109
You've always been a good friend.

1212
01:53:59,825 --> 01:54:00,951
Why?

1213
01:54:02,119 --> 01:54:03,495
Why can't I...

1214
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,080
...kill you?

1215
01:54:08,583 --> 01:54:10,377
Too many questions.

1216
01:54:10,919 --> 01:54:12,504
Too many questions.

1217
01:54:13,338 --> 01:54:14,631
Poor Edward.

1218
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:17,342
I had to save them both.

1219
01:54:17,843 --> 01:54:20,595
You see, I'm both Bruce Wayne
and Batman.

1220
01:54:21,346 --> 01:54:23,265
Not because I have to be.

1221
01:54:23,432 --> 01:54:24,599
Now...

1222
01:54:25,142 --> 01:54:27,144
...because I choose to be.

1223
01:54:50,627 --> 01:54:54,881
Thank you for responding to my request
for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

1224
01:54:55,256 --> 01:54:56,507
Edward Nygma...

1225
01:54:56,674 --> 01:55:00,511
...has been screaming for hours
that he knows the true identity...

1226
01:55:00,678 --> 01:55:02,180
...of Batman.

1227
01:55:15,943 --> 01:55:17,111
Edward?

1228
01:55:17,945 --> 01:55:19,114
Who...

1229
01:55:19,657 --> 01:55:20,991
...is it?

1230
01:55:23,786 --> 01:55:25,913
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

1231
01:55:27,498 --> 01:55:29,083
Do you remember me?

1232
01:55:31,043 --> 01:55:32,753
How could I forget?

1233
01:55:34,546 --> 01:55:36,465
Dr. Burton tells me...

1234
01:55:37,633 --> 01:55:39,551
...you know who Batman is.

1235
01:55:40,552 --> 01:55:43,555
I can't tell you if you don't say, "please."

1236
01:55:44,974 --> 01:55:46,558
Edward, please.

1237
01:55:46,767 --> 01:55:48,310
Who is Batman?

1238
01:55:51,063 --> 01:55:52,272
I'm...

1239
01:55:52,648 --> 01:55:54,024
...Batman.

1240
01:56:20,343 --> 01:56:22,178
Your secret is safe.

1241
01:56:22,345 --> 01:56:24,431
He is definitely a wacko.

1242
01:56:25,682 --> 01:56:26,808
"Wacko?"

1243
01:56:27,017 --> 01:56:28,768
Is that a technical term?

1244
01:56:29,436 --> 01:56:30,520
Listen...

1245
01:56:34,107 --> 01:56:36,276
...I won't need this anymore.

1246
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,408
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

1247
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:00,968
Don't work too late.
