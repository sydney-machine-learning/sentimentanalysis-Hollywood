1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,785
<i>It's hard to remember now,</i>

2
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:46,454
<i>but Europe was like this in 1944.</i>

3
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:55,547
<i>The Second World War was in its fifth year
and still going Hitler's way.</i>

4
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:59,301
<i>German troops controlled most of Europe.</i>

5
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:03,179
<i>D-day changed all that.</i>

6
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:09,436
<i>D-day, June 6th, 1944.</i>

7
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,812
<i>When the allied forces,</i>

8
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:13,356
<i>under their commander,
General Eisenhower,</i>

9
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:16,192
<i>landed on the northern coast of France.</i>

10
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:20,030
<i>By July, they were able
to begin their own offensive.</i>

11
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:23,033
<i>By August, Paris was liberated.</i>

12
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:27,662
<i>Everywhere the Germans retreated.</i>

13
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,375
<i>But with the allied victories
came problems.</i>

14
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,378
<i>Supplies still had to be
driven from Normandy,</i>

15
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,213
<i>over 400 miles away,</i>

16
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:39,507
<i>and became dangerously short.</i>

17
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,344
<i>The allied advance began
to come to a halt.</i>

18
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:47,891
<i>Another problem facing
Eisenhower was this.</i>

19
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,352
<i>His two most famous generals,</i>

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,855
<i>Patton, who was in the south,
and Montgomery in the north,</i>

21
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:56,232
<i>disliked each other intensely.</i>

22
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,528
<i>Their long-standing rivalry
had never been more fierce.</i>

23
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:04,574
<i>There simply were not enough
supplies for both armies.</i>

24
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,911
<i>Each wanted to be the one
to defeat the Germans.</i>

25
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,830
<i>Each wanted to beat the other to Berlin.</i>

26
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,958
<i>In September 1944,</i>

27
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:17,170
<i>Montgomery devised
a new and spectacular plan</i>

28
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,839
<i>given the code name Market Garden.</i>

29
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:23,635
<i>Eisenhower,
under great pressure from his superiors,</i>

30
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:25,845
<i>finally sided with Montgomery,</i>

31
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:29,265
<i>and operation Market Garden
became a reality.</i>

32
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,935
<i>The plan,</i>

33
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,689
<i>like so many plans
in so many wars before it,</i>

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,109
<i>was meant to end the fighting
by Christmas</i>

35
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:42,404
<i>and bring the boys back home.</i>

36
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,171
Shh!

37
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:34,260
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.

38
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,102
The Germans have collapsed.

39
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,943
Then the war is over?

40
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,612
Soon.

41
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,198
But what is that noise?

42
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,035
Panic.

43
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,150
<i><b>FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!</b></i>

44
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:11,816
You may begin.

45
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:15,820
May I first be permitted to say,
and I think I speak for all of us...

46
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:19,323
how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...

47
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:22,326
that you have been reappointed
commander of our forces in the West.

48
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,287
Speeches are for victory celebrations.

49
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,707
Let's get to the point. Air power?

50
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,834
Air power, Field Marshal?

51
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,627
Briefly, please.

52
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:35,673
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?

53
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,091
Also minimal.

54
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,093
Tanks... troops... replacements?

55
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:40,887
- Minimal.
- Morale?

56
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,149
Nonexistent.

57
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,653
What do you think we should do?

58
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,240
End the war, you fools.

59
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,578
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.

60
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,580
We have such confidence in you.

61
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:10,583
Everyone knows you never lost a battle.

62
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:14,754
I'm still young. Give me time.

63
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,384
The first thing we must do...

64
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:25,807
is to turn this rabble
into something like an army.

65
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:33,523
Anything at all on when
they plan to invade Holland?

66
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:37,276
They seem to have paused in Belgium.

67
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,403
Most likely supply problems.

68
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:42,240
Otherwise we can't imagine why.

69
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,122
I think it's because we're retreating...

70
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,374
faster than they can advance.

71
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,616
How many vehicles in the past hour?

72
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,952
Fifty-four.

73
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,829
And for the same hour yesterday?

74
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,915
Ninety-eight.

75
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:37,128
Last week your mother and I
could have captured Holland alone.

76
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:41,174
Already the panic has stopped.

77
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:45,094
It isn't over yet,
and those idiots don't realize it.

78
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,681
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.

79
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:50,683
I was nine when they got here.

80
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,227
Next month I'll be 14.
I ought to know something.

81
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,526
Father, the Allies will come.

82
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:04,780
But when?

83
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,581
I've just got back to England
from Brussels

84
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:17,543
where I had a meeting this morning
with Field Marshal Montgomery.

85
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,296
There was an earlier one
with General Eisenhower.

86
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,548
They both feel, as I do,

87
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,177
that when the Field Marshal's
plan has succeeded,

88
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,679
we shall be able to
end the war by Christmas,

89
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:30,640
in less than 100 days.

90
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:36,520
Actually, the plan's really very simple.

91
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,733
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles

92
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,902
and drop them behind enemy lines.

93
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,782
It'll be the largest
airborne operation ever mounted.

94
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:52,370
Quite frankly,

95
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,289
this kind of thing's
never been attempted before.

96
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:58,626
Just where is this all gonna take place?

97
00:11:58,709 --> 00:11:59,752
Holland.

98
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:00,920
And when?

99
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,672
I'm coming to that now.

100
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,340
Right.

101
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:08,427
The ground forces.

102
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:11,764
XXX Corps, commanded
by General Horrocks, 20,000 vehicles.

103
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:14,809
And this, as you know,
is the German frontline there.

104
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:18,062
Now, we're going to lay
a carpet, as it were,

105
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:21,399
of airborne troops
over which XXX Corps can pass.

106
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,442
We shall seize the bridges,

107
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,319
it's all a question of bridges,

108
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,154
with thunderclap surprise

109
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:30,032
and hold them until they can be secured.

110
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,827
Now, first of all,

111
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:36,539
General Maxwell Taylor, Eindhoven.

112
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,792
You take and hold the bridges there

113
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,294
With the 101 st.

114
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,297
General Gavin,

115
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:47,842
with your 82nd, you get Nijmegen.

116
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,803
You'll take and hold the bridges.

117
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:53,723
And, Roy, you get the prize, Arnhem,

118
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:55,850
Arnhem bridge,

119
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,436
and you hold it.

120
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:00,396
For how long?

121
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:03,232
Well, Monty assures me that XXX Corps

122
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:07,737
will do the 63 miles in two days.

123
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,489
63 miles in two days.

124
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,533
Yeah. They ought to
be able to handle that.

125
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:15,161
Oh, I'm sorry. General Sosabowski.

126
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:18,456
You go with
your Polish brigade with Roy Urquhart.

127
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:19,749
I'm so sorry.

128
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,251
Roy,

129
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:28,090
when you've secured your bridge
and XXX Corps have got across it,

130
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,675
we can turn east,

131
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,439
right into the industrial
heart of Germany,

132
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,314
the Ruhr.

133
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:34,946
Once we control their factories,

134
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,099
there's not very much
they can do about it.

135
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,851
And that is the plan.

136
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,271
And we go next Sunday.

137
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,939
Seven days?

138
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,524
Why not?

139
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,778
The sooner we go, the better.
We've got them on the run.

140
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:54,700
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?

141
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,954
- I've said nothing.
- Precisely.

142
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,415
Your silences are thunderous.

143
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,004
General Browning, I...

144
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:10,049
I am 3 Pole,

145
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,676
considered by some to be smart.

146
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,137
If that is so,

147
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,307
it makes me member
of a true minority group.

148
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:22,770
Minority groups are
more comfortable in silence.

149
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:23,979
Oh, really?

150
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,233
I should have thought the opposite
was true. But you do disapprove.

151
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,734
I am thrilled that your great

152
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,905
Field Marshal Montgomery
has devised such a plan.

153
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,071
And I promise you,

154
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,240
I will be properly ecstatic if it works.

155
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,409
- When it works.
- Of course.

156
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,203
- When it works.
- Thank you.

157
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,583
Well, now let's get down to the details.

158
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,146
<i>Firstly, of course,
we should have to have a high level...</i>

159
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:50,163
From which direction will their
attack come, and who will command?

160
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,133
Montgomery or Patton?

161
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:55,511
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.

162
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,347
He is their best.

163
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,308
Patton will lead the assault.

164
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,978
I would prefer Montgomery...

165
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,148
but even Eisenhower isn't that stupid.

166
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:15,197
Bittrich's Panzer troops
need some rest...

167
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,451
if they're to stop Patton.

168
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,704
We should pull them back somewhere safe.

169
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:24,498
Safe, quiet, out of the way. But where?

170
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,251
Arnhem?

171
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,048
Arnhem.

172
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,677
- I'll be in touch.
- That'll be fine.

173
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,638
General, be safe.

174
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,017
Why the emergency meeting?

175
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,603
Just keeping me abreast
of the little changes.

176
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,146
How big are the little changes?

177
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:50,441
I'll answer with typical
British understatement. Gigantic.

178
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,651
For example, they can't
get us all in at once.

179
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:55,321
Too many men, too much equipment,
not enough planes.

180
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:57,839
It's going to take
three days to get the men into Arnhem,

181
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:59,533
Poles and the British.

182
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,160
How about us?

183
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:04,461
We'll be all right. Aside from the fact
that we're parachuting in daylight,

184
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:06,081
we have nothing to worry about.

185
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,585
Daylight? Has it ever been tried before?

186
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,670
Not in a major drop.

187
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,581
You think there might be
a reason for that?

188
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:14,926
Let's hope not.

189
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:16,342
What do you think?

190
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:19,720
It'll be all right. It's a no-moon period
anyway. We have to go in daylight.

191
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:22,556
It doesn't matter.
Just so they get us over the target area.

192
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,467
Half a mile away,
three quarters of a mile,

193
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:25,468
I'll settle for that.

194
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,561
I don't want to hear anything else.

195
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:29,438
Is there anything else?

196
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,774
Well, you're my Dutch adviser, Harry.

197
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,734
I forgot to tell you something?

198
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,820
Only that the Germans first tried to take
Nijmegen Bridge themselves

199
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,698
back in 1940 and got slaughtered.

200
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:46,664
Go back!

201
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,793
Go back!

202
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,380
Do as I say!

203
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:58,342
But my friend lives down the road.

204
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,304
It's my birthday
and she has a present for me.

205
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:04,932
Please let me through.

206
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,234
All right. Be quick.

207
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,177
Are your sure about the colors?

208
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,791
I'm sure, Father. Believe me.

209
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:35,212
Model?

210
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,592
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?

211
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:43,012
The British will have an explanation.

212
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,014
Did you pass on
the message about the tanks?

213
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,058
Of course. But Model is
something more important.

214
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,021
You're a good boy and a wonderful spy.

215
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,398
Now go and help your mother with supper.

216
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,237
Sir?

217
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,156
Yes, Fuller?

218
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,965
We've got some information on tanks, sir.

219
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:04,750
What?

220
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,862
Dutch underground reports
from the Arnhem area.

221
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,287
Established their strength?

222
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,240
- No, sir, but I've got some men in...
- Have they been identified?

223
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,367
Not by our intelligence.

224
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,752
So it's the same rumors as before, right?

225
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,962
- I believe these rumors, sir.
- Why?

226
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,007
The general consensus
of opinion is that our opposition

227
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,801
will consist entirely
of Hitler Youth or old men on bicycles.

228
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,595
I don't really know why, sir.

229
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:27,348
Perhaps because no one
in intelligence does.

230
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:31,143
I just want to be sure our airborne carpet
consists of live troops,

231
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:32,603
not dead ones.

232
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,523
I know everybody thinks
I'm overanxious, sir,

233
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,501
but I would like to order another

234
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:40,277
low-level reconnaissance of the area.

235
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:43,155
If that's all right with you, sir.

236
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,367
Very well.

237
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,161
- All right, Wilson.
- Sir.

238
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:50,329
Very well.

239
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,415
- Oh, Fuller. Fuller.
- Yeah. Sir?

240
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,211
I wouldn't be too concerned about
what people think of you.

241
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:00,673
You happen to be somewhat
brighter than most of us.

242
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,300
Tends to make us nervous.

243
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,232
Naturally we'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements, sir,

244
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,234
but please keep in mind

245
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:23,278
the one factor which is
crippling all our plans.

246
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,572
It may seem improbable to you,

247
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,784
but we are desperately short
of transport aircraft.

248
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,119
I am aware of that.

249
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,594
In fact, I'm surprised
that nobody mentioned it to Monty

250
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,415
when he dreamed up this operation.

251
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,751
I need drop zones
as close as possible to the bridge.

252
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,878
Now clearly this area's no use at all.

253
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,840
Can't have my chaps
landing on the top of chimneys, but...

254
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:44,800
Now this looks inviting here.

255
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:47,386
- What's the terrain like?
- Sorry, sir.

256
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:51,265
All our reports indicate that this terrain
here is too soft for glider landings.

257
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,218
You see the nose digs in
first on touchdown,

258
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:54,781
the whole thing goes ass over tip.

259
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,008
Total write-off.

260
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:57,521
All right.

261
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:00,357
- What about there?
- No. I'm afraid not, sir.

262
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:03,485
You see, after the drop,
when we bank for our return,

263
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,572
we run into a whole lot of flak and
rubbish from this Jerry air field

264
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,240
up here at Deelen.

265
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,452
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere.

266
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,747
Oh, yes, hopefully, sir,

267
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:16,582
but, as I was saying,

268
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:19,752
we cannot afford
to lose a single aircraft.

269
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,336
That is the problem.

270
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:24,923
My problem is
I don't just need drop zones.

271
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,010
I need drop zones I can hold and defend.

272
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,597
The rest of my division
arrives with the second drop

273
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,099
and General Sosabowski's
Polish brigade with the third.

274
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,476
I understand, sir.

275
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,936
But we really think
we found the right place.

276
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,106
It's large enough
for your needs, it's flat and firm,

277
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:43,233
and also easily defended.

278
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,824
Well, where the hell is it?

279
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,628
Well, it's not actually
on this photograph, but,

280
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,907
it should be... Excuse me, sir.

281
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,285
It would be, about here, I think.

282
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,165
That could be 10 miles from the bridge.

283
00:20:58,248 --> 00:20:59,814
No, just under eight, actually, sir.

284
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:02,076
If you'd like to have a look at this.

285
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,382
You see, the terrain is easy to traverse.

286
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:11,220
All our information substantiates that...

287
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:13,597
Yes, sir?

288
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,726
Just making sure whose side you're on.

289
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,530
Now a drop zone eight miles
from Arnhem Bridge

290
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:14,032
might be thought by some
to present problems.

291
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:15,826
My God. He can't mean it.

292
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,246
I'm afraid he does.
He must know what he's doing.

293
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:21,123
That's more than I know.

294
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:23,208
Why should he have
the corner of the market?

295
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,377
...cannot under
any stretch of the imagination

296
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,462
be considered ideal,

297
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:31,383
but the gliders will be bringing in
a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps

298
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:34,177
specially fitted with
twin Vickers machine guns.

299
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:36,263
Now the instant we land,

300
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:39,099
they will race ahead
to the bridge and hold it

301
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,352
until the other battalions arrive on foot.

302
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:45,260
And they'll be quick enough to secure
both ends of Arnhem Bridge?

303
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,148
Most certainly.

304
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,817
Good, good.
Now if you all know where I shall be.

305
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,278
My headquarters will be
in the center with 82nd.

306
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:53,989
Now just you remember
that we're all totally interlocked.

307
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,283
This is a bottom to top operation.

308
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,620
101st pass XXX Corps on to 82nd.

309
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:02,039
82nd pass them on to British Airborne.

310
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,084
If any one group fails,
it's total failure for us all.

311
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:09,671
All we need now

312
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,132
are three days of clear skies.

313
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:14,259
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

314
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,971
Only the weather can stop us now.

315
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:19,848
Weather!

316
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:27,147
General Browning, what of the Germans?

317
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:31,036
Don't you think that since we know that
Arnhem is so crucial to their safety,

318
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,194
they might know that, too?

319
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,570
Now, look here.

320
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:38,408
The few troops
in the area are second class.

321
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,661
They're not frontline caliber,

322
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:41,870
not at all.

323
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:43,622
Do you understand?

324
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:45,697
I think you ought to
have a little more faith

325
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,707
in Montgomery's
intelligence reports, you know.

326
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,252
He's done pretty well
for us in last three or four years.

327
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,381
I will tell you the extent of my faith.

328
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:55,926
I am thinking of asking
for a letter from you

329
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,804
stating that I was forced
to act under your orders

330
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,806
in case my men are massacred.

331
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,017
I see.

332
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:08,146
Yes, I do see.

333
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:14,236
Do you wish such a letter?

334
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,863
No.

335
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:19,866
No, of course not.

336
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:22,077
In the case of massacre,

337
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,663
what difference would it make?

338
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,843
- You mean you don't believe me, sir?
- Well, clearly not.

339
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:40,470
All right, boys.
NAAFI's up. Take your break.

340
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:43,807
God almighty.

341
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,350
Sorry about that, sir.

342
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:46,685
But what, then?

343
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:49,187
I just don't believe
these damn radios are strong enough

344
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:52,065
to carry the eight miles
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

345
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:54,236
Don't happen to have
any cigarettes, do you, sir?

346
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:56,319
- No.
- They're perfectly okay.

347
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:58,613
I've used them God knows how many times.

348
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,158
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.

349
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:04,411
Well, I didn't have
any problems with them in the desert.

350
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,829
Yes, I know.

351
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,373
You see, Cole, what bothers me,

352
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,959
what genuinely and truly
has me more than a bit disturbed,

353
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,878
is that Holland being half underwater,

354
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:16,131
is somewhat soggier
than most deserts you're apt to find.

355
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,468
Tends to have a lot more trees.

356
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,596
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

357
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:27,008
Shouldn't you tell the General if you're
so certain about it, sir?

358
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:29,020
If I were, believe me, I would.

359
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,063
What if they really don't work?

360
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,689
Well, what difference will it make?

361
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:35,317
The General will be
on the bridge himself by nightfall.

362
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,314
He won't have to make contact
with the bridge

363
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:38,236
if he's on it.

364
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,529
Will he, sir?

365
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:41,490
Well,

366
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,744
if anyone rocks the boat,
it's not gonna be me.

367
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,293
The regular projector chap's at lunch,
sir.

368
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:54,586
I'll have it in a moment.

369
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:56,061
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.

370
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,073
Don't worry. I don't eat lunch.

371
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:00,050
Damn!

372
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,260
Nearly there, sir.

373
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:05,013
It's really worth your time, sir,
believe me.

374
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,183
There.

375
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,561
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
Can't see any tanks.

376
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:14,981
Wait a moment, sir.
It's a lot clearer in the next picture.

377
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,983
If I can just...

378
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:19,319
Now.

379
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,366
Next.

380
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:27,160
Yes, sir. I've had this one enlarged.

381
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:53,145
Yes. I...

382
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:55,605
I shouldn't worry about them.

383
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:00,652
But, sir, you see that they are tanks.

384
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:03,738
I doubt if they're fully serviceable.

385
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,199
- Still got guns.
- So have we.

386
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:11,413
Sir, if they weren't serviceable,

387
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,833
why would they try to conceal them?

388
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:16,710
Normal routine, Fuller.

389
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:20,195
But, sir, we keep getting reports
from the Dutch underground.

390
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,498
I've read them

391
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,842
and so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

392
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,677
Now look here,

393
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:30,158
there have been thousands of photographs
from this sortie and from all the others.

394
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,295
How many of them have shown tanks?

395
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,935
Just these, sir.

396
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,188
And you seriously consider
asking us to cancel

397
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:38,690
the biggest operation mounted since D-day

398
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:41,484
because of three photographs?

399
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,366
No, sir.

400
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,536
Sixteen consecutive drops
have been canceled in the last few months

401
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,371
for one reason or another.

402
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:56,082
But this time, the party's on

403
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,960
and no one is going to call it off.

404
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,464
Is that fully understood?

405
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:04,925
Yes, sir.

406
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,866
Thank you, Waddy.

407
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,162
Thank you, gentlemen!

408
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,458
Do sit down, gentlemen. Please sit down.

409
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,546
Look after these for me.

410
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:51,179
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

411
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:54,975
Gentlemen,

412
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:58,144
this is a story
that you will tell your grandchildren

413
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:00,188
and mightily bored they'll be.

414
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:04,651
The plan is called
operation Market Garden.

415
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:06,653
Market is the airborne element

416
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:09,197
and Garden, the ground forces. That's us.

417
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,368
Now, this is our position
on the Belgium border here.

418
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:19,040
Tomorrow, three airborne
divisions will begin landing in Holland.

419
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,571
35,000 men taking off from 24 airfields

420
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:25,501
in troop-carrying planes
or towed-in gliders.

421
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,176
The American 101st here,
around Eindhoven.

422
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:35,056
The American 82nd here,
south of Nijmegen.

423
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,018
And our own 1st airborne boys

424
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:41,104
and a Polish brigade here, at Arnhem,

425
00:29:42,022 --> 00:29:45,608
64 miles behind enemy lines.

426
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:51,823
Now, their job is to take and hold

427
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:54,659
all the bridges in these three areas.

428
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:57,954
Our job is to punch a hole

429
00:29:58,204 --> 00:30:00,498
through the German frontline here,

430
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,294
and then drive like hell up this road,

431
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:07,756
linking up with each
airborne division on the way.

432
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,677
Speed is the vital factor.

433
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,932
The plan is to
reach Eindhoven in two to three hours,

434
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,602
and Arnhem in two to three days.

435
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:24,105
That, gentlemen, is the prize.

436
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,316
The bridge over the Rhine,

437
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,944
the last bridge between us and Germany.

438
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:33,365
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours
tomorrow afternoon.

439
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:36,618
The Irish guards,
under the command of Colonel Vandeleur,

440
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,827
will take the lead.

441
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:39,371
Christ, not us again.

442
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:40,846
What do you say to that, J.O.E.?

443
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:43,275
Oh, delighted, sir. Truly delighted.

444
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,461
I've selected you to lead us

445
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,964
not only because of
your extraordinary fighting ability,

446
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,633
but also because

447
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:54,803
in the unlikely event
that the Germans ever get you,

448
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,596
they will assume from your attire

449
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,419
that they've captured a wretched peasant

450
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:00,681
and immediately send you on your way.

451
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,981
Now, maintaining the speed of our advance

452
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,234
will no doubt be tough going

453
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:11,152
as it's a single highway,

454
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,071
but no matter what,

455
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:16,032
we must reach those 1st airborne boys

456
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,784
in 48 hours.

457
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,911
Now, gentlemen,

458
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,985
I'm not saying that
this will be the easiest party

459
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:24,509
that we've ever attended,

460
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,627
but I still wouldn't miss it
for the world.

461
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:30,422
I like to think of this

462
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:33,508
as one of those American western films.

463
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:38,012
The paratroops,
lacking substantial equipment,

464
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:39,848
always short of food,

465
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:42,434
these are the besieged homesteaders.

466
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:46,020
The Germans, well, naturally,
they're the bad guys.

467
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:48,106
And XXX Corps,

468
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:51,401
we, my friends, are the cavalry

469
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,611
on the way to the rescue!

470
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,590
Oh, do you want me to
pack that as well, sir?

471
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:15,967
Ah, no, thank you, Wicks, I'll carry it.

472
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,677
Sir.

473
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:20,301
You haven't forgotten
my golf clubs, have you?

474
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:23,016
Well, they'll be coming later
in the staff car, sir.

475
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:24,184
And, what about...

476
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:26,519
Sorry, sir.

477
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,147
What about my dinner jacket?

478
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,401
Are you sure you'll be needing that, sir?

479
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,320
Well, let's hope so.

480
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,200
Why don't you quit that?

481
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:43,328
Chock-full of vitamins.

482
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:46,206
Here, Eddie, have a little strength.

483
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,254
Hey, where'd you put that?

484
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,798
Oh, damn it, Eddie, give it back.

485
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:57,008
All right.

486
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,093
There you are.

487
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,805
I wish you hadn't done that.

488
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,019
See, my problem is I'm not totally crazy

489
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:09,812
about the prospect of dying.

490
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:11,105
So don't die.

491
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:15,708
Drinking that garbage isn't
gonna keep you alive, is it?

492
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,010
Well, what is?

493
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:18,821
What is? Well,

494
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:21,533
not getting shot.

495
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,618
What can guarantee that?

496
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:24,994
Nothing.

497
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:26,454
For sure.

498
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:31,251
You will.

499
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,670
I Will, What?

500
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,380
You tell me, Eddie.

501
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,298
You tell me I won't die.

502
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,218
All right, you won't die.

503
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:42,262
No, no. Guarantee me.

504
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,473
I want you to guarantee me I won't die.

505
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:53,147
I guarantee you.

506
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:08,037
Come on.

507
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,124
Let's get some food in you.

508
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,835
- Come on.
- I wasn't kidding.

509
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:20,174
Hey, Eddie!

510
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:22,677
Were you kidding?

511
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,346
Major Fuller.

512
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,683
My name is Sims.

513
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:30,852
Mind 3 bit of company?

514
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,521
Of course not, sir.

515
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,983
Busy times.

516
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:39,986
You must be exhausted.

517
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,825
Are you exhausted?

518
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:48,161
Who isn't?

519
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:53,875
Well, we've been getting reports from
a number of your friends.

520
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,173
They're worried about you.

521
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:57,712
They think perhaps you need a rest.

522
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:03,343
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?

523
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:08,056
Is it because I rocked the boat?

524
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,309
I'm a doctor.

525
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,187
I'm only concerned with your health.

526
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:19,025
I think perhaps
you ought to take a bit of sick leave.

527
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:21,861
But why?

528
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,741
I'm not ill or anything.

529
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,287
I haven't done anything wrong.

530
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:33,206
Of course not.

531
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,083
You're just a little tired.

532
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:38,670
Yes.

533
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:41,255
I am tired.

534
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:48,680
I think, perhaps, we might go.

535
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,017
Can't it be stopped?

536
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,603
No.

537
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,524
I don't want to be left behind.

538
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:00,775
Please.

539
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:04,362
It's out of my hands, laddie.

540
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,002
I didn't want to miss the party.

541
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,892
Come on. Move it, buddy.

542
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,310
That's the way.

543
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,739
Come on, move yourselves! Move!

544
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,033
Come on, get up there. Move on down.

545
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:20,373
Home, sweet home.

546
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,629
Yes, when you think
we only had seven days

547
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:28,936
to get everything organized,
it's quite a...

548
00:38:28,947 --> 00:38:29,934
Bloody miracle.

549
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,718
It took six months
to set up the D-day drop.

550
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,929
That was only half as big as this.

551
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,015
How do you feel?

552
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,018
Fine. I'll feel even better
when we're in Holland.

553
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:43,469
Do you remember a few months back

554
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:45,439
when I was first appointed
to this command?

555
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,350
I told you I had never jumped but thought
I ought to give it a go.

556
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,193
Mmm-hmm.

557
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:50,538
Well, you did me a big favor.

558
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:51,946
Oh, really? What?

559
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,574
You said, "Roy, you're far too old"

560
00:38:54,657 --> 00:38:56,659
"for that kind of thing
and much too large."

561
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:58,160
Did I?

562
00:38:58,244 --> 00:38:59,662
What was the favor?

563
00:38:59,745 --> 00:39:02,790
Well, I didn't quite
tell you everything at the time

564
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,378
but I'm prone to airsickness.

565
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,046
Good gracious!

566
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,631
What, every flight?

567
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,926
Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?

568
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:46,667
All right,
get that goddamn fleet out of here!

569
00:41:55,671 --> 00:42:00,176
<i>Who would true valor see</i>

570
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:04,638
<i>Let him come hither</i>

571
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,685
<i>One here will constant be</i>

572
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:13,064
Come <i>Wind,</i> come <i>weather</i>

573
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:19,445
<i>There's no discouragement</i>

574
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:29,413
His first avowed intent

575
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:34,543
To be a pilgrim

576
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:55,356
Soon be home, Harry.

577
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:05,241
Better than the desert, eh, sir?

578
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:06,534
What was that?

579
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:09,078
Easier than walking, sir.

580
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:13,374
If you say so, Hancock.

581
00:43:28,347 --> 00:43:29,890
Yeah. Fine, sir.

582
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,797
And the artillery should
be able to clear the way pretty well.

583
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,981
Your initial advance.

584
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:40,234
Yes, we'll move off
as soon as their barrage has got going.

585
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,278
Yes, that's absolutely fine. Fine.

586
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:44,822
Just follow behind it as close as we can.

587
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:46,282
But you know J.O.E.,

588
00:43:46,365 --> 00:43:49,493
this isn't gonna be the pushover
that everybody seems to thinks it is.

589
00:43:49,577 --> 00:43:51,203
No, I didn't think so.

590
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,080
Morning, Alan.

591
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,469
Your sleeping beauties know
there's a war on, do they?

592
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:56,709
Absolutely, sir.

593
00:43:56,792 --> 00:44:00,045
Is it true that the Germans have put more
troops into the line ahead of us?

594
00:44:00,129 --> 00:44:03,632
Yes, they obviously don't intend
to just let us walk in the front door.

595
00:44:03,716 --> 00:44:07,386
Hello, Bob, hope that's not my funeral
they're going to!

596
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,598
And I'm still desperately worried about

597
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,600
having to throw everything up this road,

598
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,059
but there's no alternative.

599
00:44:14,143 --> 00:44:15,665
- Morning, Tom!
- Good morning, sir.

600
00:44:15,675 --> 00:44:18,387
So I've decided to run
the road like a railway.

601
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:21,859
Nobody, repeat, nobody will
be allowed to put any vehicle

602
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:23,777
on that road without my permission.

603
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,070
Including me?

604
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,364
- Good luck to you, sir!
- You, too!

605
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:29,325
Especially you, J.O.E.

606
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:31,827
- Morning, Derek!
- Morning, sir.

607
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:34,455
Glad to see
somebody knows where we're going!

608
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:42,087
Time, J.O.E., that's the killer.

609
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,466
We can't afford to drop behind schedule.

610
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:49,970
So, for God's sake,
keep your tanks on the move.

611
00:45:00,272 --> 00:45:01,690
Good God almighty!

612
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:04,443
That's just the 101 st.

613
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:07,738
The other two groups
are on the northern route.

614
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:10,491
H-Hour in 90 minutes.

615
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:13,911
- I'd better be going, sir.
- Right you are, J.O.E.

616
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:16,497
Any last minute changes, Bob?

617
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,916
Yes, sir.
If the advance runs into difficulty,

618
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,086
we're to call in the air force
with purple smoke.

619
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:23,420
First class and good luck, J.O.E.!

620
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:24,755
Thank you, sir.

621
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:27,049
Do you think you'll be able to manage it?

622
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:29,885
I've got nothing else planned
for this afternoon.

623
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,373
I told you,
you should've had the bloody thing out.

624
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,892
What the hell's that?

625
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:01,769
It's flak.

626
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:10,694
General Bittrich!

627
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,696
I'm in here, Matthias.

628
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:29,296
Fantastic, isn't it?

629
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:32,716
Just once to have such power in my hands.

630
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:43,143
Red on.

631
00:50:25,597 --> 00:50:28,076
If there's no more opposition
than this on the river road,

632
00:50:28,086 --> 00:50:29,393
we shall be all right.

633
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:31,562
Where the hell do you think you're going?

634
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:33,397
"A" company over here!

635
00:50:45,826 --> 00:50:47,286
"B" company to me!

636
00:50:47,953 --> 00:50:50,330
"A" company over there!

637
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,128
Hurry up.

638
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:11,977
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshall, but...

639
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,771
British paratroopers have landed...

640
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:17,524
three kilometers from here.

641
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:21,194
Why should they do that?

642
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,406
There is nothing important here.

643
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:31,204
Me! I am important.

644
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:33,915
They must all be coming
just to capture me.

645
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:35,751
Call my chauffeur and car.

646
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:39,463
Evacuate the headquarters.

647
00:51:39,546 --> 00:51:41,381
And don't forget my cigars.

648
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,364
Oh, my God!

649
00:52:20,087 --> 00:52:21,254
General!

650
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,547
You all right?

651
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:23,757
Yeah.

652
00:52:56,957 --> 00:52:58,041
Okay, you guys,

653
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,919
come on, gather your stuff,
and move, move, move!

654
00:53:07,342 --> 00:53:09,803
"C" company, form by the yellow smoke!

655
00:53:12,305 --> 00:53:13,432
This is it, Jim.

656
00:53:13,515 --> 00:53:14,683
Okay, sir.

657
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:20,689
You okay?

658
00:53:21,148 --> 00:53:22,858
Right. Let's go.

659
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:28,321
Then keep trying.

660
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,991
There must be someone there!

661
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,538
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.

662
00:53:36,621 --> 00:53:39,249
They say thousands of troops
are dropping all over Holland.

663
00:53:39,332 --> 00:53:42,627
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.

664
00:53:42,711 --> 00:53:45,922
I can't get through to his headquarters.

665
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:49,009
A strong force has landed
south of Nijmegen.

666
00:53:50,802 --> 00:53:52,929
Nijmegen? They're after the bridge.

667
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:58,226
That doesn't matter.

668
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:01,730
Perhaps they've landed
in the Field Marshal's soup.

669
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,318
Yes, you'd like that,
wouldn't you? Now listen.

670
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:08,612
I'll take care of Arnhem.

671
00:54:08,695 --> 00:54:12,115
You get to Nijmegen as fast as you can.

672
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,117
Take anything that'll move...

673
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:18,038
every man that can walk,
and hold the bridge.

674
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:22,542
No! Field Marshal Model!

675
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:27,589
Nothing must cross it. Is that clear?

676
00:54:27,672 --> 00:54:30,634
You must hold that bridge
under any circumstance.

677
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:33,512
- Understood?
- Clear.

678
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,889
Ryan and Rossi, come with me.

679
00:54:36,598 --> 00:54:38,225
Cover the right flank.

680
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:46,817
How far away is headquarters?

681
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,610
Half a mile, maybe more.

682
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:16,494
Brigadier Lathbury's just left, sir.

683
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,427
Johnny Frost and the second battalion are
already on the river road.

684
00:55:19,437 --> 00:55:20,237
Good.

685
00:55:20,392 --> 00:55:21,768
Thank you, Baker.

686
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:23,760
Any news of Freddie Gough's
jeep squadron?

687
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,857
Well, it's unconfirmed...

688
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:26,027
It's rather bad luck, sir,

689
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:28,900
considering how few gliders
we lost on the way in.

690
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:34,144
Well, it appears that a lot
of the special jeeps failed to arrive

691
00:55:34,154 --> 00:55:36,700
and those that did have been
badly shot up in an ambush.

692
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:39,953
So no one's going to
get to Arnhem Bridge except on foot.

693
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,329
Splendid.

694
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,838
They must be from the lunatic asylum, sir.

695
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,382
It's located on the far side of the wood.

696
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:55,218
They escaped when
it was bombed this morning.

697
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:03,810
Do you think they know
something we don't?

698
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:20,827
All guns commence firing!

699
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:35,842
Get moving. Get moving.

700
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:37,385
Driver, advance!

701
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,303
Message received. Thank you. Out.

702
00:59:51,412 --> 00:59:53,039
Start the purple!

703
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,292
Start the purple!

704
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:58,670
Take cover!

705
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:45,258
Fire!

706
01:01:56,454 --> 01:01:58,873
Come on, get the wounded down the line!

707
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:05,380
Get that wreck off the road!

708
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,305
J.O.E., how the hell...

709
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:19,727
How the hell do they expect us
to keep to schedule on a road like this?

710
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,688
You don't know the worst.

711
01:02:22,188 --> 01:02:23,898
This bit we're on now...

712
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,233
Yes?

713
01:02:26,526 --> 01:02:28,152
It's the wide part.

714
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,016
Peter, General's coming in.

715
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:42,185
How's it going now?

716
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:43,519
Not too well, sir.

717
01:03:43,603 --> 01:03:46,189
We haven't been able to make contact
with General Browning,

718
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:47,857
XXX Corps, or England.

719
01:03:49,317 --> 01:03:51,235
So no one knows we've arrived safely?

720
01:03:51,319 --> 01:03:53,112
Not as far as we know, sir.

721
01:03:55,114 --> 01:03:56,366
What about those VHF sets?

722
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:57,492
Well, sir,

723
01:03:57,575 --> 01:04:01,120
it appears the sets have been delivered
with the wrong crystals.

724
01:04:01,454 --> 01:04:02,914
So they're quite useless?

725
01:04:02,997 --> 01:04:04,957
Yes, sir. I'm afraid they are.

726
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:10,823
Are Brigadier Lathbury
and Colonel Frost aware of what happened

727
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:12,099
to the special jeep squadron?

728
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:13,466
Not as far as we know, sir.

729
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:17,553
At the moment we're unable to contact
any of the units moving into Arnhem.

730
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:22,266
Not a very satisfactory
state of affairs, Steele.

731
01:04:22,433 --> 01:04:23,476
No, sir.

732
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,436
We can't quite understand it, sir.

733
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,896
It's perfectly good equipment.

734
01:04:26,979 --> 01:04:29,240
- Then for God's sake, get it sorted out.
- Yes, sir.

735
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,877
Before we have
a bloody disaster on our hands.

736
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:44,330
Sir.

737
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:51,879
Hancock, I've got lunatics
laughing at me from the woods.

738
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:56,134
My original plan has been scuppered
now that the jeeps haven't arrived.

739
01:04:56,634 --> 01:04:59,262
My communications have
completely broken down.

740
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:04,434
Do you really believe that any of that
can be helped by a cup of tea?

741
01:05:06,978 --> 01:05:08,438
Couldn't hurt, sir.

742
01:05:24,576 --> 01:05:26,316
Forgive me for returning, Field Marshal.

743
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:27,957
I must press for permission...

744
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,501
if it becomes necessary...

745
01:05:30,585 --> 01:05:35,756
to blow up the bridges
at Arnhem and Nijmegen.

746
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,842
This is out of the question.

747
01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:40,303
Never. Is that clear?

748
01:05:40,386 --> 01:05:42,346
We need them for our counterattack.

749
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,974
Counterattack? With what?

750
01:05:45,057 --> 01:05:48,102
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.

751
01:05:48,186 --> 01:05:50,313
Isolated, they are lost.

752
01:05:50,396 --> 01:05:52,899
I have spoken to Von Rundstedt.

753
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:56,527
All reinforcements come to us first.

754
01:05:56,611 --> 01:05:59,947
Every hour we get stronger
and they grow weaker.

755
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:04,410
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.

756
01:06:04,535 --> 01:06:06,662
Do you really think
if they wanted the bridges...

757
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:10,750
they would have landed
12 kilometers away?

758
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,919
It's ridiculous.

759
01:06:17,048 --> 01:06:19,133
Thank you for the tea.

760
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:12,520
Well, our lightning-like
assault on Arnhem Bridge

761
01:07:12,603 --> 01:07:14,647
is certainly a smashing success.

762
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:18,484
I've an aversion to apples. I'm so sorry.

763
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:21,878
I'm sure the Germans
will be thunderstruck with surprise.

764
01:07:21,888 --> 01:07:23,364
Are there many of you?

765
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:25,449
Yes, there are thousands of us.

766
01:07:25,658 --> 01:07:27,180
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

767
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:28,786
Thank you. Thank you...

768
01:07:28,869 --> 01:07:31,174
Now, look here, this isn't
a victory parade, you know?

769
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:33,353
Oh, come on, sir. Enjoy the moment.

770
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,668
I will enjoy the moment
when we reach the bridge

771
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,378
and when we find the bridge intact.

772
01:07:37,461 --> 01:07:38,671
It Will be.

773
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,215
Things couldn't be going better.
Nothing's wrong.

774
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:44,093
Yes, I know.
That's exactly what is wrong, Harry.

775
01:08:37,563 --> 01:08:39,315
Jesus Christ.

776
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:01,962
Stay down!

777
01:09:20,231 --> 01:09:21,315
Shit.

778
01:09:25,152 --> 01:09:26,821
Still no contact, sir.

779
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:29,323
Then keep at it. I shall be back shortly.

780
01:09:29,407 --> 01:09:32,060
Brigadier Lathbury can't have gone
that far. All right, Brown.

781
01:09:32,076 --> 01:09:35,454
I'm sure we'll have them fixed
by the time you get back, sir.

782
01:09:41,502 --> 01:09:44,797
Can you get a message down
to XXX corps on that dingus?

783
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,048
Yes, sir, Colonel.

784
01:09:46,132 --> 01:09:48,300
We just got word from the 82nd up ahead.

785
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,594
They captured
the Grave Bridge completely intact.

786
01:09:50,678 --> 01:09:53,681
Oh, that's terrific,
except XXX Corps ain't about to reach

787
01:09:53,764 --> 01:09:55,641
the goddamn intact Grave Bridge

788
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,269
until the goddamn Son Bridge gets fixed!

789
01:09:58,436 --> 01:10:00,855
Tell our British cousins
to hustle up some Bailey stuff.

790
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:01,939
Yes, sir.

791
01:10:02,022 --> 01:10:03,931
I'll meet them in Eindhoven
when they get there.

792
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:05,507
Tell those schmucks to do this right

793
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,438
and have their Bailey stuff
at the front of their column. Got that?

794
01:10:08,448 --> 01:10:09,616
Yes, sir.

795
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:11,866
And be sure to say "please."

796
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:13,743
Yes, sir.

797
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,087
J.O.E., I make it just under
six miles to Eindhoven.

798
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:27,298
We won't make it tonight.

799
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:29,008
It'll be dark shortly.

800
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:33,012
Well, I hope to God
the 101st's gonna hang on till tomorrow.

801
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,682
Giles, remember what the general said,

802
01:10:37,475 --> 01:10:38,976
"We're the cavalry."

803
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:42,313
It would be bad form
to arrive in advance of schedule.

804
01:10:44,523 --> 01:10:46,859
In the nick of time would do nicely.

805
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:52,239
These plans should have
been left in England.

806
01:10:52,323 --> 01:10:53,949
They're top secret.

807
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:56,577
And now we have all we need...

808
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:00,539
Units, defense plans, objectives...

809
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:03,250
and the schedule for further drops.

810
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:05,920
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge
for demolition...

811
01:11:06,003 --> 01:11:08,297
if I blow it up tonight.

812
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,675
This Operation Market Garden must fail.

813
01:11:11,759 --> 01:11:16,138
Why do all my generals
want to destroy my bridges?

814
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:19,725
Come, Ludwig. We'll have dinner.

815
01:11:20,893 --> 01:11:21,894
Dinner?

816
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:24,688
But what about these plans?

817
01:11:24,772 --> 01:11:27,733
These plans? They are false.

818
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:31,153
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.

819
01:11:31,237 --> 01:11:33,322
White wine or red?

820
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:39,036
Dog, charlie, fox...

821
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:41,831
We're, still getting nothing from
Colonel Frost's battalion

822
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:42,998
on the river road, sir.

823
01:11:43,082 --> 01:11:44,124
Thank you, Cole.

824
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:46,126
Dog, charlie, fox.
Dog, charlie, fox. Over.

825
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,671
Let's hope Johnny's meeting
less resistance than we are.

826
01:11:48,754 --> 01:11:50,120
Gerald, we've got to
break through to the bridge.

827
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,747
But we're completely blocked ahead of us.

828
01:11:51,757 --> 01:11:54,584
There's a good deal more resistance than
we've been led to expect.

829
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:56,276
I must see for myself how he's doing.

830
01:11:56,294 --> 01:11:58,597
All right, Cole. What is their strength?

831
01:11:58,665 --> 01:11:59,839
Well, I can't estimate yet.

832
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,849
Some Dutch underground people
were here earlier

833
01:12:01,932 --> 01:12:03,392
trying to explain the situation,

834
01:12:03,475 --> 01:12:05,646
but I'm just not sure how much they know.

835
01:12:09,275 --> 01:12:11,527
Get back that gun over here!

836
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:25,416
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it, sir.

837
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:29,753
Christ almighty!
They've got round behind us.

838
01:12:30,004 --> 01:12:32,657
I think it might be safer
if you spent the night with us, sir.

839
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:34,335
Gerald, I've got to get back to HQ.

840
01:12:34,419 --> 01:12:35,634
Yes, but alive, sir.

841
01:12:35,968 --> 01:12:39,099
Look, if we can reach them, there are
some houses over in that direction.

842
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,848
We can get ourselves organized

843
01:12:40,931 --> 01:12:42,931
and try and find out
what the hell's happening.

844
01:12:42,975 --> 01:12:44,393
Pullout. Pull out!

845
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:45,811
Right.

846
01:12:45,936 --> 01:12:47,146
Sergeant Major.

847
01:13:46,704 --> 01:13:48,487
You know something's just occurred to me.

848
01:13:48,497 --> 01:13:49,297
What's that, sir?

849
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,960
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.

850
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:52,565
It's all very well for the country,

851
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:55,953
but I doubt very much if it's gonna
fool anyone in the towns.

852
01:13:56,215 --> 01:13:57,800
Come on. Come on.

853
01:14:03,389 --> 01:14:04,807
Look here, I'm awfully sorry,

854
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,685
but I'm afraid we're going to have to
occupy your house.

855
01:14:07,768 --> 01:14:08,894
Yeah.

856
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:10,980
All right, chaps. We're in here.

857
01:14:11,063 --> 01:14:12,231
Come on.

858
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:14,566
- Dick.
- Yes, sir?

859
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,444
Now take your men.
Occupy that house across the road.

860
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:19,659
Make sure you can
cover the bridge from your side.

861
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:21,448
Right, sir. Sergeant, follow me.

862
01:14:21,699 --> 01:14:24,410
Dog, charlie, fox, hello,
dog, charlie, fox.

863
01:14:26,203 --> 01:14:27,725
Take your men up to the next floor.

864
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:29,415
Rip down those curtains.

865
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,803
Pile all this furniture
against the window. All right?

866
01:14:31,813 --> 01:14:34,628
Dog, charlie, fox.
Hello, dog, charlie, fox.

867
01:14:34,753 --> 01:14:38,173
We've reached our objective.
What is your position? Over.

868
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:41,593
There's nothing, sir.

869
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,887
I can't contact brigade at all, sir.

870
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,306
Tried the other battalions?

871
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:47,933
Any luck?

872
01:14:49,393 --> 01:14:50,519
Keep trying.

873
01:14:50,602 --> 01:14:52,312
Hello, dog, charlie, fox.

874
01:15:21,258 --> 01:15:23,802
Shall we have a go
at the far end now, sir?

875
01:15:24,803 --> 01:15:27,723
"Having a go" is hardly
textbook terminology, Harry.

876
01:15:29,516 --> 01:15:31,310
But you'll let us try, sir?

877
01:16:31,203 --> 01:16:33,372
All down! Take cover!

878
01:16:33,705 --> 01:16:35,165
Cover fire! Quick!

879
01:16:39,378 --> 01:16:40,629
Smoke!

880
01:16:47,386 --> 01:16:49,096
All right, come on, lads!

881
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:53,892
Go!

882
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,313
Come on! Come on!

883
01:16:58,397 --> 01:16:59,565
Keep going!

884
01:17:13,912 --> 01:17:15,664
Hurry! Hurry!

885
01:17:22,963 --> 01:17:24,298
Fall back!

886
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:25,716
Fall back!

887
01:17:33,432 --> 01:17:34,808
Are you all right?

888
01:17:34,892 --> 01:17:35,893
Yes, sir, I'm fine.

889
01:17:35,976 --> 01:17:39,730
Well, we'll deal with them later,
when it gets dark.

890
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:03,170
- Made it so far, Doddsie, eh?
- Aye.

891
01:18:17,434 --> 01:18:21,480
Hey, Corp.,
you better hit that slit first time.

892
01:18:22,606 --> 01:18:23,815
Hey, Corp.,

893
01:18:24,191 --> 01:18:27,027
I said you'd better hit
that slit first time, or we...

894
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,654
I heard you, boyo.

895
01:18:29,112 --> 01:18:30,155
Oh, great.

896
01:18:31,531 --> 01:18:32,991
After you, corp.

897
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:52,970
Come on, let's get on with it.

898
01:19:01,812 --> 01:19:02,980
Now.

899
01:19:04,856 --> 01:19:07,609
Now we're in trouble!
You bloody missed it!

900
01:19:07,693 --> 01:19:09,695
Well, you knocked my arm,
you clumsy bastard.

901
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,822
Now we'll never get out of here.

902
01:19:15,492 --> 01:19:19,371
We've hit an ammunition dump!
Bloody ammo dump! Shit!

903
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,611
Fool's courage.

904
01:20:24,603 --> 01:20:26,605
She says you're much too noisy.

905
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:30,067
She does realize that there is something
of a war going on, doesn't she?

906
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,777
She has never liked noise.

907
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,612
She hates it, hates it.

908
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:36,323
Colonel Frost, they're coming, sir.

909
01:20:36,615 --> 01:20:37,866
Oh, excuse me.

910
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:42,871
Many of them?

911
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:46,291
Can't tell, sir.
Can only hear them at the moment.

912
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:51,064
Hold your fire!

913
01:21:51,148 --> 01:21:52,441
Hold your fire!

914
01:21:58,738 --> 01:21:59,739
Fire!

915
01:22:05,078 --> 01:22:07,164
Commands. Wait for the commands.

916
01:22:17,549 --> 01:22:19,801
...go after that man.

917
01:22:19,885 --> 01:22:22,095
Open fire! Fire!

918
01:22:22,179 --> 01:22:23,472
Fire!

919
01:23:27,452 --> 01:23:28,620
Jesus!

920
01:24:24,509 --> 01:24:25,844
Cease firing!

921
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:29,848
Cease firing!

922
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,695
Sorry, mum.

923
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:45,864
Whitney,

924
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,658
try and rustle up
some more bandages, will you?

925
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,234
All right, lad. You'll be all right.

926
01:24:51,244 --> 01:24:53,375
I'm going to check up
with Cornish. See you later.

927
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,372
- Get him patched up, will you, Doc?
- Right.

928
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,840
I'm terribly sorry about all this,
you know.

929
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,837
- Wicks.
- Sir.

930
01:25:02,047 --> 01:25:03,423
Right. Off you go.

931
01:25:15,769 --> 01:25:17,979
Get that bloody stretcher inside!

932
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:23,026
All right, here we go.

933
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:31,076
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

934
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:34,412
- Mr. Cornish is straight through there.
- Right, thank you.

935
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:37,248
Hello, Dick.

936
01:25:37,374 --> 01:25:39,668
- Hello, sir.
- It's all right. Sit down. All right?

937
01:25:39,751 --> 01:25:42,253
- Fine, sir, it's only a flesh wound.
- Oh, good.

938
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,463
How are things?

939
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:45,256
- Not too bad, sir.
- Good.

940
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,927
Well, what is bad, I'm afraid, is this.

941
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,303
- Careful.
- Sorry, sir.

942
01:25:50,387 --> 01:25:52,514
We hold the north end of the bridge,

943
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:53,973
Germans hold the south.

944
01:25:54,057 --> 01:25:56,768
But now they probably
control most of the town,

945
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:58,520
including the church tower.

946
01:25:58,603 --> 01:26:00,897
So, what you're saying
is that we're surrounded?

947
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,732
Yes, something like that.

948
01:26:03,149 --> 01:26:04,859
- Now, what else?
- Sir.

949
01:26:05,985 --> 01:26:09,531
I was a bit surprised to find
Bittrich's Panzer troops here, sir.

950
01:26:17,622 --> 01:26:21,042
Yes, well, surely you didn't believe
all that nonsense they told us, did you?

951
01:26:21,126 --> 01:26:23,211
I mean, about the enemy being made up of,

952
01:26:23,294 --> 01:26:26,339
what was it, old men, children?

953
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:29,300
I'll have to risk it.

954
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:32,384
It's halfway through the morning
and things aren't getting any better.

955
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:33,760
Well, Sergeant, how is it?

956
01:26:33,844 --> 01:26:35,724
Sir. We can't clear the street, sir.

957
01:26:35,807 --> 01:26:37,225
Enemy strength keeps increasing

958
01:26:37,308 --> 01:26:39,426
and it's just impossible
to get through to the bridge.

959
01:26:39,436 --> 01:26:41,176
- That's all. Thank you, Sergeant.
- Sir.

960
01:26:41,186 --> 01:26:43,104
Gerald, it's imperative
that I get back to HQ

961
01:26:43,148 --> 01:26:45,014
before the situation
gets completely out of hand.

962
01:26:45,024 --> 01:26:46,677
Well, if it's all right with you, sir,

963
01:26:46,761 --> 01:26:49,327
Cleminson and I will come
part of the way. All right, Jimmy?

964
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:50,687
- Let's move.
- Out.

965
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:40,371
End house, bottom window, sir!

966
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:46,753
- Cleminson, get over here!
- Sir.

967
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,548
Hang on, Gerald.

968
01:27:54,552 --> 01:27:56,095
In here. Come on.

969
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,101
Can't you move your legs?

970
01:28:03,061 --> 01:28:04,103
No.

971
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:06,648
Must be the spine. Can you help us?

972
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:07,899
How?

973
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:12,070
- Don't you know a doctor nearby?
- We can take him to the hospital.

974
01:28:16,783 --> 01:28:19,327
You go. He will be fine.

975
01:28:19,536 --> 01:28:20,578
Go, sir.

976
01:28:20,745 --> 01:28:21,788
You go.

977
01:28:56,155 --> 01:28:57,323
Go up.

978
01:29:20,471 --> 01:29:22,348
They're certainly at the back.

979
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:24,267
What's it like at the front?

980
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:32,150
We're surrounded, sir.

981
01:29:33,651 --> 01:29:34,903
Yes, quite.

982
01:29:42,035 --> 01:29:44,871
Oh, I was rather expecting
to see you again, General Sosabowski.

983
01:29:44,954 --> 01:29:46,748
Do please, sit down.

984
01:29:50,501 --> 01:29:52,128
Polish drop has been canceled again.

985
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:53,922
I would like an explanation.

986
01:29:54,005 --> 01:29:57,467
Yeah, well, I expect the fog
has a certain amount to do with it.

987
01:29:57,550 --> 01:30:00,136
I'm told there are aircraft
flying 50 miles to the south.

988
01:30:00,219 --> 01:30:02,915
Explain to me, please, why my men
and equipment cannot be moved

989
01:30:02,925 --> 01:30:05,016
from here to there
and then fly to Arnhem?

990
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:07,435
Well, now that's a very
reasonable question.

991
01:30:07,518 --> 01:30:11,689
And I don't want to bother you with
a lot of meteorological mumbo-jumbo,

992
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:14,400
but the fact is, you see,
whether we like it or not,

993
01:30:14,484 --> 01:30:16,861
fog, it moves.

994
01:30:17,028 --> 01:30:18,863
Of course, it moves. Where?

995
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:21,317
Well, that's very difficult to say,
General.

996
01:30:21,327 --> 01:30:24,163
It's very slippery stuff. Fog, I mean.

997
01:30:24,369 --> 01:30:26,371
Now, you think you've got it and then it,

998
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:29,248
it reverses itself and leaves you behind.

999
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,126
Won't you please sit down?

1000
01:30:33,544 --> 01:30:35,296
What I'm trying to say, General,

1001
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:37,799
is, I mean, even if we move
your troops the 50 miles,

1002
01:30:37,882 --> 01:30:40,468
where, I grant you,
just now the sun is shining,

1003
01:30:40,551 --> 01:30:42,595
the chances are that
by the time we get there,

1004
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:45,390
the fog could quite easily
have preceded us.

1005
01:30:46,557 --> 01:30:48,142
So we simply have to wait.

1006
01:30:48,226 --> 01:30:49,560
And do nothing?

1007
01:30:49,936 --> 01:30:52,063
I think that puts it rather well.

1008
01:31:36,482 --> 01:31:38,818
Hey, you! You Vandeleur?

1009
01:31:39,902 --> 01:31:40,903
Yes.

1010
01:31:40,987 --> 01:31:43,031
- I'm Bobby Stout.
- How do you do?

1011
01:31:43,823 --> 01:31:46,159
Hell of a day, huh? Look at them. Wild.

1012
01:31:46,284 --> 01:31:47,785
Have you ever been liberated?

1013
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:49,620
I got divorced twice. Does that count?

1014
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:50,872
Yes. That counts.

1015
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:53,458
Hey, that Bailey crap.
You got it amongst this stuff?

1016
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,460
When you refer to Bailey crap,

1017
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:59,839
I take it you mean that glorious
precision-made British-built bridge

1018
01:31:59,922 --> 01:32:01,841
which is the envy of the civilized world.

1019
01:32:01,924 --> 01:32:02,884
Yeah.

1020
01:32:02,967 --> 01:32:05,261
Right, well, the trucks
are down there somewhere,

1021
01:32:05,344 --> 01:32:08,040
but how you're gonna get them
through this crowd, I don't know.

1022
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:11,309
No problem. I got a side road pegged out.
It'll avoid all this.

1023
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,644
- American ingenuity.
- Oh, really?

1024
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:16,773
Actually, I was born in Yugoslavia,
but what the hell.

1025
01:32:17,106 --> 01:32:18,274
Yes.

1026
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:33,706
Okay. I'll take it, sir.

1027
01:32:38,961 --> 01:32:40,463
Where the hell have you been?

1028
01:32:40,546 --> 01:32:42,715
With some Dutch friends
at Nijmegen. Look.

1029
01:32:42,799 --> 01:32:44,717
This is why we can't take the bridge.

1030
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:46,628
The Germans have moved in
SS Panzer troops.

1031
01:32:46,638 --> 01:32:49,160
You'd think they didn't want us to
get across or something.

1032
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:50,807
They've sealed off the whole area.

1033
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:52,100
Here.

1034
01:32:52,183 --> 01:32:53,893
You can see on this map.

1035
01:32:54,685 --> 01:32:57,105
Every street leading
to that bridge is blocked.

1036
01:32:57,188 --> 01:32:59,190
Every house around it is occupied.

1037
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:03,152
The Dutch underground people
say it's just impossible to break through.

1038
01:33:04,028 --> 01:33:05,530
They could be right.

1039
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:11,619
Where's the captain?

1040
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:13,454
Dead.

1041
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:17,834
I didn't ask you how he was.
I asked you where he was.

1042
01:37:50,314 --> 01:37:55,319
Orderly, we're all out
of bandages over here.

1043
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:02,743
Okay, bring them here.

1044
01:38:02,827 --> 01:38:03,953
Bring it.

1045
01:38:20,344 --> 01:38:21,804
Hey, you!

1046
01:38:21,887 --> 01:38:24,473
Don't block that ambulance space!

1047
01:38:26,308 --> 01:38:27,476
- Sir.
- Not now, Sergeant.

1048
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,256
I'd like for you to look at my captain.

1049
01:38:29,266 --> 01:38:31,393
I'm sorry, Sergeant, put him down.

1050
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:45,703
What in the name of hell do you...

1051
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:47,972
You told me to put him down, sir.

1052
01:38:47,982 --> 01:38:50,901
Look, Sergeant,
I'm in no mood for crapping around.

1053
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,253
Well, if you don't look at him right now,
he's gonna die.

1054
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,546
Dead now.

1055
01:38:58,507 --> 01:39:00,855
It would mean a lot to me, sir,
if you'd check him out.

1056
01:39:00,865 --> 01:39:04,119
Come on, Sergeant,
for Christ's sake, get him out of here!

1057
01:39:11,228 --> 01:39:13,772
Would you look at him, please, sir?

1058
01:39:15,399 --> 01:39:16,775
Right now,

1059
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:20,112
or I'll blow your fucking head off.

1060
01:39:27,286 --> 01:39:28,454
Right now.

1061
01:39:35,503 --> 01:39:37,838
I can give him a quick examination,
if you like.

1062
01:39:37,922 --> 01:39:39,673
Thank you very much, sir.

1063
01:39:52,269 --> 01:39:53,562
Son of a bitch.

1064
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:56,232
Orderly!

1065
01:40:55,165 --> 01:40:57,543
Well, I got the bullet out of his skull.

1066
01:40:58,335 --> 01:41:00,296
He's gonna live though, right?

1067
01:41:00,379 --> 01:41:02,506
Gonna have one hell of a headache.

1068
01:41:05,676 --> 01:41:06,677
Oh...

1069
01:41:08,846 --> 01:41:11,015
Guess you can turn me in now, sir.

1070
01:41:12,141 --> 01:41:13,576
That was a court-martial offense.

1071
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:15,519
- You understand that, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

1072
01:41:15,603 --> 01:41:17,521
Hope to hell it was worth it.

1073
01:41:19,148 --> 01:41:21,942
I guess only time will tell on that, sir.

1074
01:41:22,026 --> 01:41:23,694
My response is strictly limited,

1075
01:41:23,777 --> 01:41:26,228
regardless of my personal preference,
you understand that, too.

1076
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:28,073
- I do.
- Like somebody cheating in school,

1077
01:41:28,157 --> 01:41:31,285
once word gets out you can behave
any way you God damn please,

1078
01:41:31,368 --> 01:41:32,499
if your discipline's gone,

1079
01:41:32,578 --> 01:41:33,954
forget about getting it back.

1080
01:41:34,038 --> 01:41:36,498
So you're gonna have to be arrested,
over and out.

1081
01:41:36,582 --> 01:41:37,958
Lieutenant Rafferty.

1082
01:41:38,042 --> 01:41:39,293
Yes, sir. Colonel.

1083
01:41:39,376 --> 01:41:42,296
Lieutenant Rafferty,
this is Sergeant... What's your name?

1084
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:44,131
Dohun. Eddie Dohun.

1085
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:46,903
Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me
and threatened to kill me

1086
01:41:46,913 --> 01:41:48,969
unless I did precisely what he ordered.

1087
01:41:49,053 --> 01:41:51,140
- I want you to put him under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:55,613
I want you to keep him there. I want you
to keep him there for at least 10 seconds.

1089
01:41:56,101 --> 01:41:57,978
I'm not all that sure I understand,
Colonel.

1090
01:41:58,062 --> 01:42:00,064
Count to 10, Lieutenant, fast.

1091
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:03,901
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Like that, sir?

1092
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:05,569
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1093
01:42:06,028 --> 01:42:07,154
Colonel.

1094
01:42:10,616 --> 01:42:12,242
This is yours, I think.

1095
01:42:13,577 --> 01:42:15,496
Yes, sir, it looks like mine.

1096
01:42:19,416 --> 01:42:22,252
You scared the shit out of me,
you stupid bastard.

1097
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:23,921
You did a fine job yourself, sir.

1098
01:42:24,004 --> 01:42:25,396
If it makes you feel any better.

1099
01:42:25,406 --> 01:42:27,007
God damn right, it does.

1100
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:28,842
- Eddie?
- Sir.

1101
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:32,471
You wouldn't really
have killed me, would you?

1102
01:42:39,061 --> 01:42:40,354
Thank you, sir.

1103
01:42:56,745 --> 01:42:58,956
Right! Let's haul a little ass!

1104
01:42:59,123 --> 01:43:01,500
Go! Go! Go!

1105
01:43:04,503 --> 01:43:05,796
Go!

1106
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:13,053
Look out.

1107
01:43:13,137 --> 01:43:14,513
Hold, hold!

1108
01:43:14,638 --> 01:43:15,973
Hold!

1109
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,685
Come on!

1110
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:30,218
Move it! Come on, soldier.

1111
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:32,708
You're not building a sand castle.
Move it.

1112
01:43:50,758 --> 01:43:52,760
Come on, boys, use your muscle.

1113
01:43:53,635 --> 01:43:54,845
Heave!

1114
01:43:55,304 --> 01:43:56,847
Come on, heave!

1115
01:43:58,682 --> 01:44:00,100
Unload, quickly!

1116
01:44:01,852 --> 01:44:05,063
It's all right, sir.
Come on, move yourselves!

1117
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:16,241
Come on, push!

1118
01:44:35,886 --> 01:44:38,096
All together! Lift!

1119
01:44:40,933 --> 01:44:42,810
Come on, soldier, pound it!

1120
01:44:42,893 --> 01:44:45,103
Pound it. We got a schedule to meet.

1121
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:05,999
Steady!

1122
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:07,918
Heave!

1123
01:45:11,964 --> 01:45:14,091
Steady. Steady.

1124
01:45:19,721 --> 01:45:20,973
How much longer now?

1125
01:45:21,056 --> 01:45:22,975
About another four hours, sir.

1126
01:45:23,725 --> 01:45:24,810
Shit!

1127
01:45:25,936 --> 01:45:28,438
Come on, boys, we're not
doing this for fun!

1128
01:45:59,678 --> 01:46:02,180
- Hey, soldier, get over here!
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:46:02,556 --> 01:46:04,766
- And pull on this rope.
- Yes, sir.

1130
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:07,978
Didn't you ever build
a Bailey bridge before?

1131
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:09,187
No, sir.

1132
01:46:09,271 --> 01:46:10,522
Neither did I.

1133
01:46:15,402 --> 01:46:16,653
Hold up!

1134
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:23,952
Clear the way!

1135
01:46:24,036 --> 01:46:26,413
Clear! Clear! Clear!

1136
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:30,876
Come on, get up.

1137
01:46:32,377 --> 01:46:34,004
Roll it, fellas!

1138
01:46:34,504 --> 01:46:37,049
Right, come on, all aboard! Let's go.

1139
01:47:04,034 --> 01:47:06,203
Thanks, fellas. We'll be seeing you.

1140
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:13,919
What's wrong, sir?

1141
01:47:14,002 --> 01:47:16,213
They're 36 hours behind schedule.

1142
01:47:35,232 --> 01:47:36,400
Lieutenant?

1143
01:47:37,067 --> 01:47:38,235
Sir.

1144
01:47:39,236 --> 01:47:41,697
We'll be turning you over to the 82nd now.

1145
01:47:42,322 --> 01:47:44,449
They're good soldiers, the 82nd.

1146
01:47:44,574 --> 01:47:47,661
Just be sure you keep
your hand on your wallet at all times.

1147
01:47:47,744 --> 01:47:49,079
Yes, sir.

1148
01:48:39,046 --> 01:48:40,297
They're here.

1149
01:48:45,177 --> 01:48:47,387
It's XXX Corps. They're here, chaps!

1150
01:48:53,977 --> 01:48:58,190
You're late, you lazy bastards,
but we'll forgive you!

1151
01:48:58,648 --> 01:49:01,109
That was gracious of me, don't you think?

1152
01:49:03,153 --> 01:49:04,321
Take cover!

1153
01:49:04,738 --> 01:49:06,239
Bring up the PIAT!

1154
01:49:07,699 --> 01:49:09,659
Make sure it's within range.

1155
01:49:53,745 --> 01:49:55,872
Come on! Come on! You'll miss him!

1156
01:50:27,571 --> 01:50:29,322
Right, lads! Go! Go! Go!

1157
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:32,159
All right, boys!

1158
01:50:41,042 --> 01:50:42,919
Corporal! I need a jeep.

1159
01:50:43,003 --> 01:50:45,264
- Well done, laddie.
- We thought you were dead, sir.

1160
01:50:45,348 --> 01:50:47,609
- We were told...
- I can assure you it was an error.

1161
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:49,384
Short of ammo around the back.

1162
01:51:05,442 --> 01:51:07,402
That was the bleeding general.

1163
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,738
Good morning, gentlemen.

1164
01:51:09,821 --> 01:51:10,989
Good morning, sir.

1165
01:51:11,072 --> 01:51:12,899
- Good morning, sir.
- Carry on, thank you.

1166
01:51:12,909 --> 01:51:14,492
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Baker.

1167
01:51:14,576 --> 01:51:16,119
Morning, James.

1168
01:51:17,078 --> 01:51:19,539
- Morning, sir.
- Morning. Harry.

1169
01:51:19,623 --> 01:51:22,042
Apologies for my enforced absence.

1170
01:51:22,292 --> 01:51:23,460
- Dennis.
- Sir.

1171
01:51:23,543 --> 01:51:25,243
General Lathbury's been put out of action.

1172
01:51:25,253 --> 01:51:27,714
I'd like you to go into town
and take over the brigade.

1173
01:51:27,797 --> 01:51:29,667
- How soon can you leave?
- Right away, sir.

1174
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:32,490
Good. Pull them together
and keep pushing forward to the bridge.

1175
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:32,802
Sir.

1176
01:51:32,886 --> 01:51:34,713
Did the rest of the division
arrive safely?

1177
01:51:34,797 --> 01:51:36,928
Yes, sir, but we've run into
all kinds of trouble.

1178
01:51:37,007 --> 01:51:40,060
It would seem that we've landed on top of
two SS Panzer divisions.

1179
01:51:40,143 --> 01:51:41,269
Good God!

1180
01:51:41,353 --> 01:51:42,239
As you can imagine,

1181
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:44,908
it's hard to stop tanks
with rifles and machine guns.

1182
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:46,191
Show me.

1183
01:51:46,691 --> 01:51:48,610
Well, you can see what we're up against.

1184
01:51:48,693 --> 01:51:51,954
Johnny Frost and some of his chaps
have managed to get as far as the bridge,

1185
01:51:52,037 --> 01:51:54,457
but the Germans are driving
down here towards the river

1186
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:56,952
and may even now have
cut them off completely.

1187
01:51:57,035 --> 01:51:59,829
I see. Still, now that
the entire division is here,

1188
01:51:59,913 --> 01:52:01,696
we should be able to
break through to him.

1189
01:52:01,706 --> 01:52:02,374
Sir?

1190
01:52:02,457 --> 01:52:04,918
Well, certainly it gives us
more of a chance.

1191
01:52:05,001 --> 01:52:07,420
Sosabowski's Polish brigade
is due in at 12:00.

1192
01:52:07,504 --> 01:52:08,755
If it arrives.

1193
01:52:08,838 --> 01:52:11,758
Yesterday's airlift was three hours late
due to fog in England.

1194
01:52:11,841 --> 01:52:14,711
And the gliders bringing
the Poles' equipment didn't arrive at all.

1195
01:52:14,721 --> 01:52:16,096
Now give me the good news.

1196
01:52:16,179 --> 01:52:17,931
I'm afraid there isn't any, sir.

1197
01:52:18,014 --> 01:52:20,433
As you can see,
we're more or less surrounded.

1198
01:52:20,517 --> 01:52:22,102
So far, we're holding our own,

1199
01:52:22,185 --> 01:52:24,142
but we're desperately
short of food, medicine,

1200
01:52:24,187 --> 01:52:25,939
and above all, ammunition.

1201
01:52:27,023 --> 01:52:28,763
Aren't we getting our daily supply drop?

1202
01:52:28,773 --> 01:52:31,860
Oh, yes. The Royal Air Force
are flying in on schedule.

1203
01:52:32,696 --> 01:52:36,116
The trouble is the Germans have overrun
the dropping zones.

1204
01:52:36,574 --> 01:52:38,243
Don't our pilots know that?

1205
01:52:38,326 --> 01:52:39,619
Afraid not, sir.

1206
01:52:39,703 --> 01:52:41,246
In heaven's name, why?

1207
01:52:41,329 --> 01:52:42,831
It's the radio, sir.

1208
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:49,838
We still haven't been able to make contact
with anyone outside Arnhem, sir.

1209
01:53:05,562 --> 01:53:07,022
Bloody fools!

1210
01:53:07,981 --> 01:53:10,275
Bloody fools, this way!

1211
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:13,361
Over here!

1212
01:53:16,281 --> 01:53:17,490
Over here!

1213
01:53:17,574 --> 01:53:18,867
Over here!

1214
01:53:24,581 --> 01:53:25,707
We're here!

1215
01:53:31,921 --> 01:53:33,506
Over here!

1216
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:35,091
Drop them over here!

1217
01:53:35,675 --> 01:53:38,803
What the hell are they doing?
They must be able to see us.

1218
01:53:38,887 --> 01:53:40,555
They can see us all right, laddie,

1219
01:53:40,638 --> 01:53:43,767
but they're under orders
to ignore signals from the ground.

1220
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:45,769
For all they know, we could be Germans.

1221
01:53:45,852 --> 01:53:48,605
But they're giving it all
to the bloody Germans.

1222
01:54:00,575 --> 01:54:01,910
Charles.

1223
01:54:05,455 --> 01:54:06,915
Poor bastard.

1224
01:54:07,499 --> 01:54:10,001
Oh, well. Maybe tomorrow.

1225
01:54:23,473 --> 01:54:24,599
There.

1226
01:54:26,101 --> 01:54:27,560
Where's he going?

1227
01:54:31,856 --> 01:54:33,191
He'll never make it.

1228
01:54:33,274 --> 01:54:35,485
Those bleeding snipers will get him.

1229
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:38,029
Come back!

1230
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:39,572
Come back!

1231
01:54:47,664 --> 01:54:49,666
Come on, Ginger, mate. Come on!

1232
01:54:55,505 --> 01:54:57,006
He'll never lift it.

1233
01:55:03,263 --> 01:55:05,181
Bring it back, mate. Come on!

1234
01:55:09,185 --> 01:55:10,395
Come on!

1235
01:55:15,442 --> 01:55:16,943
Run, laddie! Run!

1236
01:55:24,868 --> 01:55:26,619
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1237
01:56:00,737 --> 01:56:03,156
Taxi! Taxi!

1238
01:56:17,378 --> 01:56:18,546
Did you get any of that?

1239
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:20,882
I think she wants someone
to order her a taxi.

1240
01:56:20,965 --> 01:56:22,967
What is your position?

1241
01:56:41,236 --> 01:56:42,445
Taxi!

1242
01:56:43,321 --> 01:56:44,447
Taxi!

1243
01:56:46,449 --> 01:56:47,617
Taxi!

1244
01:57:03,633 --> 01:57:04,717
Kate.

1245
01:57:11,432 --> 01:57:12,559
Doctor.

1246
01:57:12,642 --> 01:57:15,603
Good evening, Kate. May I introduce,

1247
01:57:15,812 --> 01:57:18,439
Mrs. Ter Horst, Colonel Weaver.

1248
01:57:18,898 --> 01:57:21,943
Is your husband not returned?

1249
01:57:22,986 --> 01:57:25,238
He should have been here by now.
He must be having

1250
01:57:25,321 --> 01:57:27,949
difficulties coming through
the German lines.

1251
01:57:28,783 --> 01:57:30,493
Well, in that case,

1252
01:57:31,244 --> 01:57:33,663
we will have to ask you for a decision.

1253
01:57:33,997 --> 01:57:36,332
Colonel Weaver has a request to make.

1254
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:41,004
Well, what we've done is
we've set up a defensive pocket,

1255
01:57:41,546 --> 01:57:45,717
more or less thumb-shaped,
with the river as the base.

1256
01:57:46,134 --> 01:57:49,262
Mrs. Ter Horst speaks
surprisingly good English, Colonel.

1257
01:57:49,345 --> 01:57:50,346
Oh.

1258
01:57:50,597 --> 01:57:53,293
Well, then you understand
that we're in quite a strong position

1259
01:57:53,303 --> 01:57:55,476
for holding out until
XXX Corps reaches us,

1260
01:57:55,852 --> 01:57:58,229
but we have to make certain arrangements.

1261
01:58:00,064 --> 01:58:01,566
The words come through.

1262
01:58:01,649 --> 01:58:04,193
I don't know I'd follow
the military strategy.

1263
01:58:04,277 --> 01:58:07,989
We have the main hospital, of course,
but it is full to bursting.

1264
01:58:09,574 --> 01:58:10,908
Perhaps...

1265
01:58:11,326 --> 01:58:15,330
You understand that we have great need
of additional space.

1266
01:58:22,253 --> 01:58:25,214
Our house would seem suitable.

1267
01:58:25,923 --> 01:58:27,967
It's just for the slightly wounded.

1268
01:58:28,051 --> 01:58:31,054
You know, we'll patch them up,
send them back, that sort of thing.

1269
01:58:31,137 --> 01:58:34,557
I feel it will need
a little more than that.

1270
01:58:40,188 --> 01:58:41,773
We wasting time. Come.

1271
01:58:42,857 --> 01:58:44,651
Thank you, Kate. Thank you.

1272
01:58:44,859 --> 01:58:47,362
I will see you, Colonel. I will come back.

1273
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:53,534
Come. Do come in. That's it.

1274
01:58:56,412 --> 01:58:58,498
Please sit. Come take this chair.

1275
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:00,124
Here.

1276
01:59:00,917 --> 01:59:03,461
- Come over here.
- Thanks very much, ma'am.

1277
01:59:04,587 --> 01:59:05,755
Do sit down.

1278
01:59:07,924 --> 01:59:09,258
Let me help you.

1279
01:59:21,104 --> 01:59:24,023
Oh, Colonel,
the major wants you upstairs, sir.

1280
01:59:24,107 --> 01:59:25,441
Okay. Thank you.

1281
01:59:29,028 --> 01:59:30,279
All right?

1282
01:59:34,867 --> 01:59:36,077
All right.

1283
01:59:36,577 --> 01:59:38,121
Excuse me. Thank you.

1284
01:59:39,372 --> 01:59:41,374
Still in one piece, Dodds?

1285
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:44,794
Good. All right, Potter?

1286
01:59:47,088 --> 01:59:48,756
That's far enough!

1287
01:59:49,173 --> 01:59:51,300
We can hear you from there!

1288
01:59:54,512 --> 01:59:57,098
It's rather an interesting development,
sir.

1289
01:59:57,807 --> 02:00:02,645
My general says there is no point
in continuing this fighting.

1290
02:00:03,312 --> 02:00:05,815
He is willing to discuss a surrender.

1291
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:12,697
Tell him to go to hell.

1292
02:00:14,365 --> 02:00:18,327
We haven't the proper facilities
to take you all prisoner!

1293
02:00:18,578 --> 02:00:19,746
Sorry.

1294
02:00:20,163 --> 02:00:21,289
What?

1295
02:00:21,664 --> 02:00:25,668
We'd like to,
but we can't accept your surrender.

1296
02:00:28,713 --> 02:00:30,673
Was there anything else?

1297
02:00:39,432 --> 02:00:40,641
All right.

1298
02:01:04,332 --> 02:01:05,708
And now?

1299
02:01:06,709 --> 02:01:09,629
Flatten Arnhem.

1300
02:01:52,630 --> 02:01:53,756
Papa!

1301
02:02:52,815 --> 02:02:55,484
- Any movement at Nijmegen?
- None.

1302
02:02:55,568 --> 02:02:57,226
No way of blasting through to the bridge?

1303
02:02:57,236 --> 02:02:58,654
I'd lose all my men for nothing.

1304
02:02:58,738 --> 02:03:00,990
There's God knows how many
lying out there already.

1305
02:03:01,073 --> 02:03:02,575
You mean it's over, sir?

1306
02:03:02,658 --> 02:03:04,410
I didn't say that, did I?

1307
02:03:04,869 --> 02:03:07,174
We've paid for that bridge
and we're going to collect,

1308
02:03:07,184 --> 02:03:09,311
but to do it, I need tank support.

1309
02:03:10,291 --> 02:03:11,792
Well, you've got it, Jimmy.

1310
02:03:11,876 --> 02:03:14,503
The Grenadier Guards
will be happy to oblige.

1311
02:03:14,837 --> 02:03:17,256
- Is that all right, Alex?
- Absolutely, sir.

1312
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:19,800
It's not just tanks. I need boats.

1313
02:03:19,884 --> 02:03:21,928
If XXX Corps were American,
we would have boats.

1314
02:03:21,938 --> 02:03:23,512
- Did you bring any?
- Mike?

1315
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:26,140
I think we might have
a few about somewhere, sir, yes.

1316
02:03:26,223 --> 02:03:27,934
Well, can you get them here by tonight?

1317
02:03:28,017 --> 02:03:29,435
Well, it won't be easy, sir.

1318
02:03:29,518 --> 02:03:32,021
We've got one road,
1 O-mile traffic jams on it

1319
02:03:32,104 --> 02:03:34,023
and Germans throwing shells at us.

1320
02:03:34,106 --> 02:03:35,846
I don't know quite what we can do but...

1321
02:03:35,858 --> 02:03:38,235
Except try! You can do that, can't you?

1322
02:03:39,236 --> 02:03:41,280
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

1323
02:03:41,447 --> 02:03:43,574
Now, look here. About these boats.

1324
02:03:44,325 --> 02:03:47,036
What is your opinion, I mean, how many...

1325
02:03:47,578 --> 02:03:49,497
The general's a bit scratchy today, sir.

1326
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:51,290
But it's nothing personal.

1327
02:03:51,374 --> 02:03:53,125
When we dropped on Sunday,

1328
02:03:53,709 --> 02:03:55,586
I think he cracked his spine.

1329
02:04:05,554 --> 02:04:08,808
- How many boats have we got then?
- About six in each truck.

1330
02:04:23,239 --> 02:04:25,074
Where's Major Cook, soldier?

1331
02:04:25,825 --> 02:04:27,326
I think over there, sir.

1332
02:04:27,410 --> 02:04:28,577
Thank you.

1333
02:04:38,754 --> 02:04:40,297
Better believe it.

1334
02:04:44,093 --> 02:04:46,095
Julian, where the hell are you?

1335
02:04:47,054 --> 02:04:48,264
Here, sir.

1336
02:04:53,811 --> 02:04:56,272
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.

1337
02:04:56,355 --> 02:04:58,566
What's the best way to take a bridge?

1338
02:04:58,649 --> 02:05:00,067
Both ends at once.

1339
02:05:00,484 --> 02:05:03,362
I'm sending two companies
across the river by boat.

1340
02:05:03,779 --> 02:05:06,574
I need a man with very
special qualities to lead.

1341
02:05:08,325 --> 02:05:09,535
Go on, sir.

1342
02:05:09,618 --> 02:05:11,454
He's got to be tough enough to do it.

1343
02:05:11,537 --> 02:05:13,873
And he's got to be
experienced enough to do it.

1344
02:05:13,956 --> 02:05:15,583
Plus, one more thing.

1345
02:05:16,125 --> 02:05:18,335
He's got to be dumb enough to do it.

1346
02:05:19,628 --> 02:05:21,130
Start getting ready.

1347
02:05:28,471 --> 02:05:30,473
What was all that about, Major?

1348
02:05:30,848 --> 02:05:33,476
Well, someone's come up
with a real nightmare.

1349
02:05:36,395 --> 02:05:37,772
Real nightmare.

1350
02:05:49,825 --> 02:05:52,391
We just got word from
the Dutch resistance people at Arnhem.

1351
02:05:52,401 --> 02:05:54,830
- And?
- It's not going too well for the British.

1352
02:05:54,955 --> 02:05:57,041
Their main force never reached the bridge,

1353
02:05:57,124 --> 02:05:59,325
and those that did
are hanging on by their fingernails.

1354
02:05:59,335 --> 02:06:01,770
- And General Urquhart?
- He's got his back to the river.

1355
02:06:01,796 --> 02:06:03,666
The Germans have trapped
his men in a pocket

1356
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:05,710
and they're squeezing it
smaller and smaller.

1357
02:06:05,793 --> 02:06:07,093
How long can he hold?

1358
02:06:09,845 --> 02:06:11,847
Where are those goddamn boats?

1359
02:06:28,531 --> 02:06:29,990
Just keep it clear.

1360
02:06:30,074 --> 02:06:31,242
Right.

1361
02:06:31,325 --> 02:06:33,744
They're no further than we thought.

1362
02:06:34,161 --> 02:06:35,329
- Julian.
- Sir?

1363
02:06:35,412 --> 02:06:37,414
We've a little change in plans.

1364
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:40,876
We're going to make
the crossing in daylight.

1365
02:06:41,418 --> 02:06:42,419
Daylight.

1366
02:06:42,503 --> 02:06:44,130
Traffic's all screwed up for miles.

1367
02:06:44,213 --> 02:06:46,173
By the time we're ready, it'll be 0800.

1368
02:06:46,257 --> 02:06:47,675
That's when we go.

1369
02:06:48,092 --> 02:06:49,218
Fine.

1370
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:53,430
I'd like to wait and go tomorrow night,
but the British can't hold.

1371
02:06:54,765 --> 02:06:56,225
Better by daylight.

1372
02:06:57,601 --> 02:06:58,727
Much.

1373
02:07:05,526 --> 02:07:07,153
- Any news of the boats?
- No.

1374
02:07:07,236 --> 02:07:09,196
We're switching... You want some?

1375
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:10,614
No, thank you.

1376
02:07:10,906 --> 02:07:13,576
We're switching
the start till 9:00 just to make sure.

1377
02:07:13,659 --> 02:07:16,120
You start laying smoke just before we go.

1378
02:07:16,287 --> 02:07:17,538
Fine. Fine.

1379
02:07:17,621 --> 02:07:20,666
They're gonna get creamed
from the far embankment.

1380
02:07:20,749 --> 02:07:23,627
Your smoke screen's gonna be
their only protection.

1381
02:07:24,128 --> 02:07:25,254
Don't worry.

1382
02:07:25,713 --> 02:07:27,089
We'll cover you.

1383
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:28,966
Please.

1384
02:07:39,059 --> 02:07:41,103
Okay, can I have your attention, please?

1385
02:07:41,187 --> 02:07:42,938
Can I have your attention?

1386
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:45,774
I'm pleased to inform you
that our 9:00 departure

1387
02:07:45,858 --> 02:07:47,610
has been postponed till 10:00.

1388
02:07:47,693 --> 02:07:50,779
So you can all have
an extra hour's fun and relaxation.

1389
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:52,656
- Major.
- Yes?

1390
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:55,201
We got any more information
on those boats?

1391
02:07:55,284 --> 02:07:57,661
We're reliably informed that they float.

1392
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:00,206
Outside of that, we don't know squat.

1393
02:08:00,289 --> 02:08:03,000
Not how many, not how heavy, not how big.

1394
02:08:03,751 --> 02:08:07,421
We are sure that the river is wide
and that the current is strong.

1395
02:08:07,796 --> 02:08:09,882
And as any more
cheery information comes my way,

1396
02:08:09,965 --> 02:08:11,705
I'll just be too happy to pass it along.

1397
02:08:11,715 --> 02:08:14,968
In the meantime,
just think of this as on-the-job training.

1398
02:08:17,973 --> 02:08:20,226
What's the matter, no sense of humor?

1399
02:08:22,228 --> 02:08:23,395
God damn it!

1400
02:08:25,481 --> 02:08:26,774
We go at noon.

1401
02:08:39,662 --> 02:08:41,830
Come on! Clear it off the road!

1402
02:09:14,113 --> 02:09:18,200
You men are probably wondering
why I've called us here together.

1403
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:23,455
I've reached a decision
that I'd like to share with you all.

1404
02:09:25,291 --> 02:09:27,793
I intend to go across
like George Washington,

1405
02:09:27,876 --> 02:09:29,420
standing on the prow.

1406
02:09:30,170 --> 02:09:31,964
You guys can do the rowing.

1407
02:09:39,722 --> 02:09:41,473
That's it! Move them out!

1408
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:51,650
Come on.

1409
02:09:59,074 --> 02:10:00,200
What the...

1410
02:10:00,909 --> 02:10:04,705
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload them!

1411
02:10:13,922 --> 02:10:15,424
Careful. Careful!

1412
02:10:18,927 --> 02:10:21,221
Pull it! Son of a bitch! Pull it up!

1413
02:10:21,972 --> 02:10:23,307
How many more?

1414
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:24,767
Get those sides up.

1415
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:26,060
Fire!

1416
02:10:34,068 --> 02:10:35,634
What else can you see besides smoke?

1417
02:10:35,694 --> 02:10:39,073
Nothing yet, but they are
going to try a river assault.

1418
02:10:40,282 --> 02:10:41,533
It Will fail.

1419
02:10:41,617 --> 02:10:44,328
Of course it will fail, but...

1420
02:10:44,411 --> 02:10:47,373
what do we do if it doesn't?

1421
02:10:47,456 --> 02:10:50,125
I ask your permission
to blow up the bridge.

1422
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:51,710
Out of the question.

1423
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:55,756
I understand, Field Marshal.

1424
02:10:56,715 --> 02:11:00,803
They will not cross the river
and we will blow no bridges.

1425
02:11:00,886 --> 02:11:02,805
Have the demolition charges been checked?

1426
02:11:02,888 --> 02:11:05,849
Yes, sir. Everything is wired and ready.

1427
02:11:05,933 --> 02:11:08,769
Captain Kraft is standing by as ordered.

1428
02:11:10,312 --> 02:11:13,690
The bridge will not fall
into enemy hands.

1429
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:17,403
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...

1430
02:11:18,529 --> 02:11:19,863
I'll blow it sky-high.

1431
02:11:32,876 --> 02:11:36,004
- Let's get going!
- All right! Go, go, go!

1432
02:11:55,107 --> 02:11:58,110
Hurry, get to the water!
Go on, go on, go, boy, go!

1433
02:12:05,617 --> 02:12:07,161
Let's go, come on!

1434
02:12:11,248 --> 02:12:13,167
Jump in, boys. Let's move.

1435
02:12:19,715 --> 02:12:22,342
If you don't have an oar,
use your rifle butt!

1436
02:12:22,426 --> 02:12:24,386
Anything! Row! Row!

1437
02:12:49,995 --> 02:12:51,705
One! TWO!

1438
02:12:59,213 --> 02:13:02,007
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right!

1439
02:13:09,264 --> 02:13:12,267
- Support fire ordered, sir.
- Right. Thank you.

1440
02:13:14,686 --> 02:13:15,938
Row!

1441
02:13:34,039 --> 02:13:35,249
Get down!

1442
02:13:39,962 --> 02:13:41,630
Go! Go!

1443
02:13:41,713 --> 02:13:43,465
Go! Go!

1444
02:13:43,924 --> 02:13:45,634
Go! Go!

1445
02:13:48,136 --> 02:13:50,138
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1446
02:13:50,764 --> 02:13:52,474
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1447
02:13:52,975 --> 02:13:54,226
Hail Mary.

1448
02:13:54,309 --> 02:13:55,727
Over to the right!

1449
02:13:55,811 --> 02:13:58,814
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1450
02:13:58,897 --> 02:14:00,065
Hail Mary...

1451
02:14:04,653 --> 02:14:06,530
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1452
02:14:06,613 --> 02:14:08,657
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1453
02:14:10,158 --> 02:14:11,994
One! TWO!

1454
02:14:12,661 --> 02:14:14,621
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1455
02:14:16,873 --> 02:14:18,375
Keep rowing!

1456
02:14:20,669 --> 02:14:22,004
Straight ahead!

1457
02:14:24,172 --> 02:14:26,091
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1458
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:28,302
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1459
02:14:28,885 --> 02:14:30,596
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1460
02:14:31,555 --> 02:14:33,223
We're drifting! Pull to your left!

1461
02:14:33,307 --> 02:14:35,851
- Come on, pull!
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

1462
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,856
Go, boys. Keep rowing!

1463
02:14:41,106 --> 02:14:43,191
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1464
02:14:44,234 --> 02:14:47,988
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1465
02:14:49,698 --> 02:14:50,824
Stay down!

1466
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:53,243
Hail Mary.

1467
02:14:53,619 --> 02:14:54,953
Come on, boys!

1468
02:14:55,912 --> 02:14:57,748
...full of grace. Hail Mary.

1469
02:14:59,207 --> 02:15:01,043
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1470
02:15:01,126 --> 02:15:03,086
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1471
02:15:05,047 --> 02:15:06,798
Thy will be done.

1472
02:15:08,008 --> 02:15:09,217
Thy will be done.

1473
02:15:09,301 --> 02:15:11,595
- Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Thy will be done.

1474
02:15:11,678 --> 02:15:13,555
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1475
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:15,474
Thy will be done.

1476
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:23,231
Let's go!

1477
02:15:38,538 --> 02:15:40,582
Snipers! Snipers!

1478
02:15:51,968 --> 02:15:54,304
Help me. Help me.

1479
02:15:54,763 --> 02:15:57,474
Help me. Help me.

1480
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:16,284
Go up the side!

1481
02:16:28,046 --> 02:16:30,841
- Can we make it through the tunnel?
- No way, sir.

1482
02:16:33,510 --> 02:16:36,054
- Get up the bank.
- I'm with you, sir.

1483
02:16:49,234 --> 02:16:50,694
Cover. Cover.

1484
02:16:59,995 --> 02:17:01,163
Come on.

1485
02:17:02,205 --> 02:17:04,166
Let's go. Right here.

1486
02:17:09,504 --> 02:17:10,839
Follow me up here.

1487
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:48,293
Sergeant! Take four across. Draw fire.

1488
02:17:48,376 --> 02:17:50,837
Harry and I'll go up the side. You cover.

1489
02:17:51,046 --> 02:17:53,632
- Go!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1490
02:17:59,221 --> 02:18:01,515
- Come on.
- Come on! Let's go!

1491
02:18:22,202 --> 02:18:23,495
Are you ready?

1492
02:18:23,578 --> 02:18:24,746
Yes, General.

1493
02:18:35,257 --> 02:18:36,424
Cover me.

1494
02:18:40,762 --> 02:18:42,514
Damn it. God damn it.

1495
02:19:13,503 --> 02:19:14,504
Now.

1496
02:19:17,007 --> 02:19:18,008
Now!

1497
02:19:18,884 --> 02:19:19,885
Again!

1498
02:19:20,635 --> 02:19:22,137
Again!

1499
02:19:33,189 --> 02:19:36,526
My God, they're only
18 kilometers from Arnhem.

1500
02:19:37,652 --> 02:19:39,571
Who can stop them now?

1501
02:19:41,531 --> 02:19:42,908
No one.

1502
02:20:03,053 --> 02:20:04,471
Come on!

1503
02:20:15,357 --> 02:20:16,733
Oh, hell.

1504
02:20:17,067 --> 02:20:18,693
Any chance, Whitney?

1505
02:20:19,027 --> 02:20:21,363
Not unless we're relieved
in the next few hours, sir.

1506
02:20:21,446 --> 02:20:22,864
Harry?

1507
02:20:23,239 --> 02:20:25,153
Try and get him down
to the cellar, will you?

1508
02:20:25,163 --> 02:20:26,664
Very good, sir.

1509
02:20:52,102 --> 02:20:53,311
It's working.

1510
02:20:53,812 --> 02:20:55,730
I'm through to HQ. Where's the colonel?

1511
02:20:55,814 --> 02:20:57,524
- Down below.
- Well, get him! Get him.

1512
02:20:57,607 --> 02:20:58,942
Colonel Frost!

1513
02:20:59,025 --> 02:21:01,027
- What is it?
- Up top!

1514
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:03,571
Up top, sir!

1515
02:21:04,489 --> 02:21:06,866
It's headquarters, sir, on the radio!

1516
02:21:07,117 --> 02:21:08,326
Coming!

1517
02:21:11,871 --> 02:21:14,499
<i>Sunray on set. Pass your message. Over.</i>

1518
02:21:15,542 --> 02:21:17,961
What's your situation, Johnny? Over.

1519
02:21:18,044 --> 02:21:20,338
I hadn't expected the pleasure, sir.
Well...

1520
02:21:20,422 --> 02:21:21,965
We're holding out.

1521
02:21:24,467 --> 02:21:28,430
We need reinforcements
and, above all, ammunition. Over.

1522
02:21:28,555 --> 02:21:31,349
I'm not sure if it's a case
of us coming for you,

1523
02:21:31,975 --> 02:21:33,643
or you coming for us.

1524
02:21:33,727 --> 02:21:36,730
Well, we'll just wait for XXX Corps then.

1525
02:21:36,813 --> 02:21:38,398
That would probably be best.

1526
02:21:39,149 --> 02:21:41,568
Very reassuring talking to you, sir.

1527
02:21:43,403 --> 02:21:44,529
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1528
02:21:44,612 --> 02:21:47,824
Getting stuck on that bloody bridge
four days on your own.

1529
02:21:48,324 --> 02:21:49,701
Have you anything else for me?

1530
02:21:49,784 --> 02:21:52,954
No, sir. I'll give you a call
when our friends arrive.

1531
02:21:53,121 --> 02:21:54,456
- Over.
- All right.

1532
02:21:56,416 --> 02:21:59,210
Good luck. Out.

1533
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:08,428
- Sergeant Tomblin!
- Here, sir!

1534
02:22:08,511 --> 02:22:09,888
I'm coming over!

1535
02:22:10,305 --> 02:22:12,057
Where's the covering fire?

1536
02:22:13,308 --> 02:22:14,684
Sergeant Taylor!

1537
02:22:25,653 --> 02:22:28,031
I don't understand.
Why aren't you moving?

1538
02:22:28,114 --> 02:22:29,783
What's the matter with you guys?

1539
02:22:29,866 --> 02:22:32,160
Those are British troops at Arnhem.

1540
02:22:32,577 --> 02:22:34,037
They're hurt bad.

1541
02:22:34,954 --> 02:22:37,832
You're not gonna stop, not now.

1542
02:22:37,957 --> 02:22:40,335
I'm sorry. We have our orders.

1543
02:22:40,502 --> 02:22:43,088
We busted our asses getting here,
half my men are killed,

1544
02:22:43,171 --> 02:22:44,923
and you're just gonna stop

1545
02:22:45,882 --> 02:22:48,593
and drink tea?

1546
02:22:48,676 --> 02:22:51,096
Look, we're now facing
a completely different situation.

1547
02:22:51,179 --> 02:22:52,889
We can't lead with tanks up that road.

1548
02:22:52,972 --> 02:22:55,100
Jerry will pick us off like sitting ducks.

1549
02:22:55,183 --> 02:22:57,393
Our infantry is still fighting
in Nijmegen.

1550
02:22:57,477 --> 02:22:59,604
When they get here, we'll move on.

1551
02:23:04,359 --> 02:23:06,945
For Christ's sake,
must you do everything by the book?

1552
02:23:07,028 --> 02:23:09,405
Our orders are to wait for the infantry.

1553
02:23:10,406 --> 02:23:12,200
I'm sorry, but there it is.

1554
02:23:20,208 --> 02:23:21,292
Sir.

1555
02:23:22,001 --> 02:23:23,545
Sir. Sir.

1556
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:25,880
It's Major Carlyle, sir.

1557
02:23:33,847 --> 02:23:35,140
All right.

1558
02:23:40,061 --> 02:23:42,230
All right, Wicks. I'm all right.

1559
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:53,408
- Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Johnny.

1560
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:57,412
Things not too good, huh?

1561
02:24:04,043 --> 02:24:06,421
I've been meaning to ask you something,

1562
02:24:07,088 --> 02:24:11,050
and I haven't because
I know you were so anxious that I should,

1563
02:24:12,343 --> 02:24:14,804
and I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

1564
02:24:17,724 --> 02:24:22,770
But, why the hell
do you always carry that bloody umbrella?

1565
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:26,691
- Memory.
- What?

1566
02:24:27,609 --> 02:24:29,903
Bad memory.

1567
02:24:32,155 --> 02:24:35,283
Always forgot the password.

1568
02:24:38,536 --> 02:24:42,624
I knew no Jerry would ever carry one.

1569
02:24:45,251 --> 02:24:49,422
I had to prove

1570
02:24:49,505 --> 02:24:52,258
I was an Englishman.

1571
02:25:06,439 --> 02:25:07,523
Harry.

1572
02:25:19,244 --> 02:25:22,538
Get back! Back!
Back into your houses! Back!

1573
02:25:34,509 --> 02:25:36,511
Hello. XXX Corps. Please hurry.

1574
02:25:37,887 --> 02:25:39,097
Please.

1575
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:42,225
Hello. XXX Corps.

1576
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:48,022
- Nothing, sir.
- All right. Thank you, Corporal.

1577
02:25:48,106 --> 02:25:50,942
It's no use in any event.
Take my boot off, will you, Wicks?

1578
02:25:51,025 --> 02:25:52,485
Hello, XXX Corps...

1579
02:25:53,528 --> 02:25:54,946
Oh, God!

1580
02:26:00,910 --> 02:26:02,870
We're out of ammunition anyway.

1581
02:26:05,164 --> 02:26:07,917
Right. Off you go, Wicks.
Join the rest of the lads.

1582
02:26:08,001 --> 02:26:09,877
Try and get back to the main force.

1583
02:26:09,961 --> 02:26:12,380
- What about you, sir?
- I'll be all right.

1584
02:26:12,964 --> 02:26:15,258
Just didn't make it this time, did we?

1585
02:26:16,050 --> 02:26:19,095
XXX Corps. Hello, XXX Corps...

1586
02:26:23,558 --> 02:26:25,685
XXX Corps, come in.

1587
02:27:37,006 --> 02:27:39,092
My General says, "Please take it."

1588
02:27:39,384 --> 02:27:40,968
"It's very good chocolate."

1589
02:27:41,052 --> 02:27:43,513
"Your planes dropped it to us yesterday."

1590
02:27:57,235 --> 02:27:58,319
English.

1591
02:28:07,537 --> 02:28:08,788
Red on.

1592
02:28:11,833 --> 02:28:13,459
Action stations!

1593
02:28:14,335 --> 02:28:16,504
God bless Field Marshal Montgomery!

1594
02:29:40,463 --> 02:29:43,132
- Sleep tight, honey.
- Sleep tight, Mom.

1595
02:29:59,649 --> 02:30:06,030
Would five minutes be too much?

1596
02:30:07,323 --> 02:30:09,784
Just five minutes' respite?

1597
02:30:12,286 --> 02:30:13,704
Dear God...

1598
02:30:15,456 --> 02:30:17,166
grant these young men...

1599
02:30:19,126 --> 02:30:22,630
die in peace and quiet.

1600
02:30:45,987 --> 02:30:48,698
I'm sorry, lads,
but you got to have to move.

1601
02:30:58,124 --> 02:30:59,542
Please...

1602
02:31:00,668 --> 02:31:02,169
Take my hand.

1603
02:31:06,632 --> 02:31:08,884
We're a bit late with this one, mate.

1604
02:31:15,850 --> 02:31:19,103
"Surely he shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler,"

1605
02:31:19,353 --> 02:31:21,939
"and from the noisome pestilence."

1606
02:31:23,232 --> 02:31:25,693
"He shall cover thee with his feathers,"

1607
02:31:26,485 --> 02:31:29,030
"and under his wing shalt thou trust:"

1608
02:31:29,447 --> 02:31:32,575
"his truth shall be thy shield
and buckler."

1609
02:31:51,886 --> 02:31:54,180
There you go. Head back.

1610
02:31:55,264 --> 02:31:57,224
You'll be all right now, chum.

1611
02:32:04,357 --> 02:32:06,901
Can it get worse?

1612
02:32:07,068 --> 02:32:09,987
Oh, yes, much worse.

1613
02:32:26,545 --> 02:32:29,256
Bring up the bulldozer.
Bring up the bulldozer.

1614
02:32:40,267 --> 02:32:41,936
Stretcher bearer!

1615
02:32:45,356 --> 02:32:46,774
Help me!

1616
02:32:48,484 --> 02:32:49,985
Stretcher!

1617
02:32:52,863 --> 02:32:54,657
Easy, now. Take it easy.

1618
02:32:55,616 --> 02:32:57,201
Morphia!

1619
02:32:57,785 --> 02:32:59,620
Taffy, I must have morphia.

1620
02:32:59,745 --> 02:33:02,581
Morphia's only for the people
who are really hurt.

1621
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:04,834
I thought I was really hurt.

1622
02:33:05,459 --> 02:33:06,877
You're wrong.

1623
02:33:08,546 --> 02:33:10,047
No, I asked him to come over.

1624
02:33:10,131 --> 02:33:11,924
But Dr. Spaander does agree with me, sir.

1625
02:33:12,007 --> 02:33:15,219
- We've got to do something about it.
- Yes, what? Good day, Doctor.

1626
02:33:15,302 --> 02:33:18,597
General Urquhart, we have no more space,

1627
02:33:18,681 --> 02:33:20,474
and we have no more supplies.

1628
02:33:20,558 --> 02:33:25,062
And since a prisoner of war
has more chance than no chance at all,

1629
02:33:25,479 --> 02:33:30,401
I have a mind to ask the Germans
to accept our wounded into their hospitals

1630
02:33:30,818 --> 02:33:33,487
if we could arrange evacuation.

1631
02:33:33,946 --> 02:33:35,823
Have I your permission to try?

1632
02:33:35,906 --> 02:33:39,952
Certainly, if Weaver agrees,
but I hardly think the Germans will.

1633
02:33:40,453 --> 02:33:43,914
Those are our guns out there.
That's XXX Corps.

1634
02:33:44,623 --> 02:33:46,459
I don't think my permission is going to be

1635
02:33:46,542 --> 02:33:48,753
- your major problem.
- Excuse me, sir.

1636
02:33:59,180 --> 02:34:01,557
I've come with a message from
General Urquhart, sir.

1637
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:03,100
How you manage that?

1638
02:34:03,809 --> 02:34:05,519
I swam the Rhine, sir.

1639
02:34:05,895 --> 02:34:08,439
I'm afraid
the radios are all up the spout.

1640
02:34:09,106 --> 02:34:12,276
The General asks
if you'll get your men across the river.

1641
02:34:12,860 --> 02:34:15,529
Now, we've been
holding out for six days now.

1642
02:34:16,197 --> 02:34:19,366
And any help at all would be
of considerable assistance.

1643
02:34:19,950 --> 02:34:21,869
You'll swim back with a reply?

1644
02:34:22,453 --> 02:34:23,537
Yes, sir.

1645
02:34:24,538 --> 02:34:28,542
Well, we can't swim, not with equipment.

1646
02:34:29,710 --> 02:34:32,421
We have small rubber boats. That's all.

1647
02:34:32,588 --> 02:34:34,340
Well, I'm afraid rubber dinghies may

1648
02:34:34,423 --> 02:34:37,718
- be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir.
- Yeah, I agree. Agree.

1649
02:34:42,473 --> 02:34:44,391
Tell the General we're coming.

1650
02:34:45,351 --> 02:34:46,894
We're coming tonight.

1651
02:34:48,062 --> 02:34:49,271
Yes, sir.

1652
02:34:57,446 --> 02:34:58,906
One two for one...

1653
02:34:59,782 --> 02:35:01,992
Quiet. Silence, silence.

1654
02:35:12,169 --> 02:35:13,420
Stop! Stop!

1655
02:35:22,012 --> 02:35:23,013
Rope.

1656
02:35:23,931 --> 02:35:24,932
Rope.

1657
02:35:28,727 --> 02:35:30,688
Pull the rope! Rope!

1658
02:35:30,771 --> 02:35:31,772
Rope!

1659
02:35:32,815 --> 02:35:35,359
Pull them out! Pull them out!

1660
02:35:36,360 --> 02:35:37,361
Quickly!

1661
02:35:39,613 --> 02:35:40,698
Quickly!

1662
02:37:43,862 --> 02:37:45,072
Not possible.

1663
02:37:45,364 --> 02:37:49,743
If you would just say yes,
it would be very possible.

1664
02:37:50,494 --> 02:37:55,541
Forgive me, but there's a battle,
and we are in the process of winning it.

1665
02:37:56,875 --> 02:37:59,795
Winning and losing is not our concern.

1666
02:38:00,713 --> 02:38:02,423
Living or dying is.

1667
02:38:05,092 --> 02:38:06,468
Cease fire.

1668
02:38:07,428 --> 02:38:09,680
One hour, two...

1669
02:38:10,848 --> 02:38:13,100
Just to evacuate our wounded.

1670
02:38:14,351 --> 02:38:18,105
Afterwards you can kill us
as much as you want to.

1671
02:38:24,778 --> 02:38:26,155
General Ludwig.

1672
02:39:03,484 --> 02:39:04,860
Ceasefire at 3:00.

1673
02:39:08,113 --> 02:39:10,491
- Will you thank him, please?
- I just did.

1674
02:39:10,616 --> 02:39:12,618
Please, you can go.

1675
02:40:43,542 --> 02:40:45,252
How short are we, a mile?

1676
02:40:54,261 --> 02:40:56,597
Why don't we just try to bash through?

1677
02:40:58,849 --> 02:41:01,018
For God's sake, it must be worth it.

1678
02:41:01,101 --> 02:41:04,062
They're trying to force
Urquhart away from the river.

1679
02:41:05,230 --> 02:41:09,484
Now, once they do that,
once they've got him surrounded,

1680
02:41:10,319 --> 02:41:11,862
he'll be annihilated.

1681
02:41:12,070 --> 02:41:13,864
Not in Monty's plan at all.

1682
02:41:15,365 --> 02:41:17,951
We've replaced the boats
we lost in Nijmegen?

1683
02:41:19,578 --> 02:41:20,621
Yes.

1684
02:41:22,623 --> 02:41:23,749
Well?

1685
02:41:26,627 --> 02:41:27,794
Well, then?

1686
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:36,970
Well, that's it, then.
We're pulling them out.

1687
02:41:43,268 --> 02:41:44,811
It was Nijmegen.

1688
02:41:45,938 --> 02:41:49,733
It was the single road
getting to Nijmegen.

1689
02:41:50,234 --> 02:41:51,985
No. It was after Nijmegen.

1690
02:41:56,657 --> 02:41:59,534
And the fog in England.

1691
02:42:04,248 --> 02:42:06,041
Doesn't matter what it was.

1692
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,261
When one man says to another,

1693
02:42:08,271 --> 02:42:11,316
"I know what let's do today,
let's play the war game,"

1694
02:42:12,172 --> 02:42:13,507
everybody dies.

1695
02:42:17,594 --> 02:42:18,887
"Withdraw."

1696
02:42:22,015 --> 02:42:24,559
Two days, they said.
We've been here nine.

1697
02:42:26,228 --> 02:42:29,356
One bloody mile.
You'd think they could accomplish that.

1698
02:42:30,399 --> 02:42:32,484
Hancock, here are another...

1699
02:42:32,567 --> 02:42:33,819
Thank you, sir.

1700
02:42:33,902 --> 02:42:35,654
The last two I could find.

1701
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:39,783
Charles, we've been given
our marching orders.

1702
02:42:43,412 --> 02:42:46,623
If they discover we're leaving,
they'll go all out to destroy us.

1703
02:42:46,707 --> 02:42:48,792
So we must take every precaution.

1704
02:42:48,875 --> 02:42:51,753
Now, I've designed this
like a collapsing bag.

1705
02:42:51,837 --> 02:42:54,089
MacDonald here has agreed
to man the wireless

1706
02:42:54,172 --> 02:42:56,390
in order to give the Germans
something to listen to.

1707
02:42:56,400 --> 02:43:00,595
And all the padres and the medical staff
have volunteered to stay behind as well.

1708
02:43:00,804 --> 02:43:02,806
Now, the wounded,
who are too bad to move,

1709
02:43:02,889 --> 02:43:04,725
will replace the men firing,

1710
02:43:05,517 --> 02:43:07,686
so our defense will seem as before.

1711
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:10,480
By the time the Germans
find out what's happening,

1712
02:43:10,564 --> 02:43:13,025
we should all be safely across the river.

1713
02:43:14,776 --> 02:43:18,071
- Pleasant journey.
- Thank you, sir.

1714
02:43:46,475 --> 02:43:49,561
- Are you all right, laddie?
- Thank you, sir.

1715
02:45:13,228 --> 02:45:16,606
I'm beginning to believe
we're actually going to make it, sir.

1716
02:45:16,690 --> 02:45:19,526
I thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.

1717
02:46:56,665 --> 02:46:59,292
General Browning will be
down right away, sir.

1718
02:47:05,632 --> 02:47:08,677
He wondered if you perhaps
might like to change.

1719
02:47:09,261 --> 02:47:10,470
Change?

1720
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:12,138
Your clothes, sir.

1721
02:47:14,015 --> 02:47:15,392
No, thanks.

1722
02:47:32,325 --> 02:47:33,743
Hello, Roy.

1723
02:47:37,205 --> 02:47:38,331
How are you?

1724
02:47:39,749 --> 02:47:42,168
I'm not sure that I'll know for a while,

1725
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:46,423
but I'm sorry about the way it worked out.

1726
02:47:48,008 --> 02:47:49,593
You did all you could.

1727
02:47:51,803 --> 02:47:54,097
Yes, but did everyone else?

1728
02:47:58,310 --> 02:48:01,146
They've got a bed
for you upstairs if you want it.

1729
02:48:02,439 --> 02:48:04,357
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.

1730
02:48:04,691 --> 02:48:06,776
I've come out with less than two.

1731
02:48:07,193 --> 02:48:09,237
I don't feel much like sleeping.

1732
02:48:10,572 --> 02:48:11,740
Quite.

1733
02:48:14,701 --> 02:48:16,536
I've just been on to Monty.

1734
02:48:18,330 --> 02:48:20,165
He's very proud and pleased.

1735
02:48:21,416 --> 02:48:24,085
- Pleased?
- Of course.

1736
02:48:25,086 --> 02:48:27,714
He thinks Market Garden
was 90% successful.

1737
02:48:29,674 --> 02:48:31,259
But what do you think?

1738
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:38,308
Well, as you know, I've always thought
that we tried to go a bridge too far.

1739
02:49:09,714 --> 02:49:10,924
Mind his head.

1740
02:49:16,429 --> 02:49:18,306
Thanks, Taff.

1741
02:49:49,587 --> 02:49:50,797
Amen.
