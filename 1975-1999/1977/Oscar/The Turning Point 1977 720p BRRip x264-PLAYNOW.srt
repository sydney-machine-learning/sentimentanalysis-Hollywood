1
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:20,962
This is KKNG Stereo 92, KKNG,
Oklahoma City.

2
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:30,137
The magnificent American Ballet Company
is at the Civic Center Music Hall.

3
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,984
Great dancing stars are performing
full-length Tchaikovsky ballets,

4
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,686
plus many classic and contemporary
favorites from ABC's vast repertoire.

5
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:44,536
Tickets are available
at the Music Hall box office and all agencies.

6
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,952
KKNG. And now we continue
with music from the ballet.

7
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:55,709
Is everybody ready?

8
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,522
Gorgeous.

9
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:14,199
Very smart!

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,550
- I thought you were gonna set up the bar.
- There'll be time after we get back.

11
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,446
Dad.

12
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,720
The wife's always the last to know.

13
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:32,127
Emilia, will you get dressed?

14
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,007
Janina, that's enough.
There'll be time when we get back.

15
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:39,065
And it takes you an hour to get ready.
Will you go and do it? Where's Ethan?

16
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:43,577
Mom, those beads look
absolutely gross with that dress.

17
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:46,681
These beads were given to me by Emma
before you were born.

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,272
Well, they look gross now.

19
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:53,529
- Ethan? Ethan, will you quit that?
- It's the lights. I'm crazy.

20
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:57,788
Well, the lights are for the party.
Come on, we're leaving in two minutes.

21
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:01,078
Come on, let's go.

22
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:03,541
- Who's got the tickets?
- I don't have them.

23
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:06,136
- I got 'em.
- You have the tickets.

24
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,837
I am so nervous.

25
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:13,465
Momma, don't be so nervous.

26
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:14,036
- How are you doin'?
- OK.

27
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:20,182
- Did you have a good cry?
- A beaut.

28
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:23,510
- What'd you tell the kids?
- Nothing. They know you.

29
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,006
They've heard the tale of you and Emma
rehearsing for the same part a hundred times.

30
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,688
- There's no law says we gotta go backstage.
- Yes, there is.

31
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:35,828
Come to the party. Relax, Sevilla.

32
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,464
What's the point of doing a perfect arabesque
for audiences who don't know the difference?

33
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:44,695
I was terrible tonight.
I'm going home to soak in a hot bath.

34
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:47,546
You are no fun, Sevilla. I'll put you in a taxi.

35
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,612
No, thanks, love. My limo's waiting.

36
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:56,024
- Where are the showers?
- Over that way, I think.

37
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,092
Deedee?

38
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,951
- Freddie.
- Baby, how are you?

39
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,604
Freddie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

40
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:11,418
Meet our kids.
This is Emilia, Janina and Ethan.

41
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:17,903
You lookjust great.

42
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,124
Deedee.

43
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:40,664
...instead of four.
- Yes. And he loops that part, so...

44
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,737
Hello, Adelaide.

45
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:47,536
Well.

46
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,676
You've held up very well, dearie.

47
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:54,739
- So've you.
- Running this company keeps me trim.

48
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,800
You could lose a few pounds, Deedee.

49
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,005
So you always said.

50
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:11,411
- No cakes or candy tonight at the party.
- Not a cookie, cookie.

51
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,569
Deedee?

52
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,473
It's Michael.

53
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:21,040
Michael Cooke.

54
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:23,088
It's Michael.

55
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:26,642
Wayne? Wayne, Michael's here.

56
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,721
Michael...

57
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,760
- Hi, Wayne.
- Look at you.

58
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:39,990
- Damn, you look impressive, sir.
- So impressive Deedee didn't recognize me.

59
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:43,123
You weren't the world's greatest
choreographer when we left.

60
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:47,448
<i>- Wasn't I? I thought I was.
- He'd done Anna Karenina.</i>

61
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:51,796
Hey, come on.

62
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,430
- From bar four on?
- Yes. But then I think it's gotta build.

63
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:06,774
- Towards the end.
- Tonight it was slow.

64
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:08,848
We should speed it up.

65
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,602
That's how it should go. It shouldn't be any
slower than that. I feel like I'm on point for...

66
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:26,706
Here you are. Oh, God.

67
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:29,166
- You were wonderful.
- Oh, I wasn't wonderful.

68
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:31,605
- I wanted to be, but I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

69
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:34,607
- I loved your flowers. Thanks so much.
- You were fabulous.

70
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,495
No, I wasn't.
You know my foot was acting up. I wrote you.

71
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,113
You couldn't notice it. I couldn't tell at all.

72
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:44,210
- I was so nervous because you were here.
- You were wonderful.

73
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,676
- I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

74
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,631
You really were, Emma.

75
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,606
Oh, Wayne.

76
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:52,750
Oh, Wayne.

77
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,574
You moved me like you always did.

78
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:58,031
Thanks.

79
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:02,512
- Oh, Wayne, it's been too long.
- Yeah, it sure has.

80
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:07,570
Well... how would you like to see
your godchild? Emilia, come over here.

81
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:15,444
Oh, my God.

82
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,602
- Isn't she somethin'?
- Oh, my God.

83
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:23,185
Last time I saw you, I could pick you up.

84
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,732
Oh, she's lovely.
She's lovely, Deedee.

85
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:29,174
She is.

86
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:31,597
Janina.

87
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,493
- Janina, yes.
- Hi.

88
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,672
- And...
- Ethan.

89
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,630
Ethan. Hi.

90
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:39,030
OK.

91
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,102
He's a little dangerous.

92
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,501
Look at you.

93
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:54,863
They don't know how fast time goes, do they?

94
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,862
No. They don't.

95
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,724
Oh, Deedee.

96
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,995
Oh, Deedee...

97
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:10,732
Still disgustingly neat.

98
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,906
I was always such a total slob, wasn't I?

99
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:17,236
I only minded when you borrowed
my eyeliner and didn't return it.

100
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:19,469
To its proper place.

101
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:24,913
Oh, Emma. You don't travel
with this picture everywhere you go?

102
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:28,779
That and Mother. The rest appear
and disappear into a scrapbook.

103
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:32,498
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Did you really wear this hat to my wedding?

104
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,835
I love that hat.

105
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:39,763
God, can you believe how young we looked?

106
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,532
- I look like shit.
- Well, we all did next to Wayne.

107
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,210
- God, he's beautiful.
- Even in those pleated pants.

108
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,060
No wonder the whole company wanted him.

109
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:53,647
It's a good thing you had your eye elsewhere.

110
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:57,940
- You mean on Michael.
- No, I mean on the ball.

111
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:05,230
Tell me something, Emma.

112
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,640
What's it like to be you now?

113
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:16,141
I dance.

114
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:21,199
I take class, I rehearse, I perform.
I go home to my hotel.

115
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:25,138
Some cities are better than others.
So are some nights.

116
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:32,554
I thought I was good tonight.
I wanted to be, for you.

117
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,728
You couldn't help being good.

118
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:38,447
- Still?
- Yes.

119
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,515
You're an artist.

120
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,730
- Now what are you doing?
- I hate this picture.

121
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:54,033
I'll send you a new one.
How many bedrooms?

122
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:57,548
You've seen them all.
Wanna see the cellar? We don't have one.

123
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:01,069
I bet Momma would have been
a much better Anna Karenina. Emma stinks.

124
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,050
You're so stupid.

125
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,670
Mark, you know what this
fantastic little Russian's gonna do?

126
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:10,067
He's going to make it respectable
for American boys to be dancers.

127
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:13,842
See, on a good day I can do
entrechat sixes with double cabrioles.

128
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,583
- You beat me to it.
- Nice of her to have brought it.

129
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:20,618
- It's all she drinks now.
- You haven't talked to her yet.

130
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:24,107
I've been busy with the rest of the company.
Wayne, I love the company.

131
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,679
I don't want 'em to ever leave.
I wanna go with 'em. I miss 'em. I want...

132
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,449
Oh, what the hell. Your eyes.

133
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,499
Your ass.

134
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,221
Emma? Anybody seen Emma?

135
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:42,707
With all that experience
you're really a professional.

136
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:49,135
Would you like to take class
with the company in the morning?

137
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:53,065
Emilia, it's pointless to be shy.

138
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,204
You must know what you want
and say it.

139
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,888
- I know some things I want.
- Such as?

140
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:02,738
To take class with the company.

141
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:06,545
Had I understood 38 years ago
what I was getting myself into,

142
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:10,889
I'd never have started
this bloody ballet company.

143
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:15,502
I had just one thought.
"We need a first-class American company."

144
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:19,761
- But you've got a lot of foreigners in yours.
- Dance is international.

145
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:22,761
My company's almost gone under five times.

146
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,868
But here we are,
the best ballet company in the world.

147
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,689
Well, in this country, anyway.

148
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:31,470
- Is that the way you were brought up?
- Yes.

149
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,994
Your mother.

150
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:39,915
Well, I want her and your father
to introduce me to some rich oil folk.

151
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,085
They have a ballet school, dearie,
and that always means

152
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,628
a half a dozen rather lumpy little girls
with very rich daddies.

153
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,186
Now, I won't interfere
with their business, Janina.

154
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:54,797
I know how to handle the rich.
You give them hope, they give you money.

155
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,033
Don't put that ham away.

156
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:00,271
Save the commercial, Adelaide.
Janina hasn't got a penny.

157
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,735
- She should open a restaurant.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:21,996
It's a choreographer's prerogative
to keep his ideas to himself.

159
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:28,046
But, Arnold, must you be so secretive? Tell
us a little something about your new ballet.

160
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,771
There won't be a swan onstage.

161
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:39,979
- That's a little something.
- But not enough to guarantee you'll do it?

162
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:45,867
- Don't run, Adelaide.
- I told you Michael and I will do our best.

163
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:48,206
And I never run.

164
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:51,784
Deedee?

165
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,206
How do you get anywhere with her?

166
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:59,783
By realizing she knows
exactly what she's doing.

167
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:04,647
Oh, by the way, we'd like to have
a new ballet for Emma this season.

168
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:09,903
Oh, you don't have to use her, Arnold.
It's just a thought.

169
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:16,585
- Oh, were you pleased with Emma tonight?
- Yes, very.

170
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:19,176
I made Emma, Janina.

171
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:22,638
No, she didn't. Michael made Emma.
But you helped, Adelaide.

172
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,901
Booze brings out the nit-pickers.
I could have helped make you.

173
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:30,159
- Really, Mom?
- Were you as good as Emma, Mom?

174
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:33,967
- I was different.
- Very. From the day you both joined us.

175
00:15:34,032 --> 00:15:36,204
Different how?

176
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:39,433
Your mother preferred to get married.

177
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:45,068
- Well, good night, all.
- I'll walk you to the car.

178
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:48,071
- Good night.
- Coming. Good night.

179
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:58,820
God, dancers have ugly feet. Ugh.

180
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:05,093
If I were a man, I could have had all the feet...
I mean children... I wanted, and still danced.

181
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,143
How many children?

182
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,862
Three. Like yours.

183
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,535
And a husband like Wayne.

184
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,088
Yes.

185
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,713
You're a very lucky girl.

186
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:24,747
Wanna change places?

187
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:30,730
No, I can't see you
teaching a pack of klutzy kids.

188
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:37,413
Or living in a town
where the company finally, finally comes.

189
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:41,742
And when they do, it's for a two-night stand.

190
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,709
No, you picked the life you wanted, Emma.

191
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,902
So did you.

192
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,523
No, not really.

193
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,063
You didn't let me.

194
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:01,481
- How not?
- "How not?"

195
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,913
We've picked up some fancy-schmancy
expressions along the way, haven't we?

196
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,601
Deedee...

197
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,868
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

198
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:17,709
<i>- Remember Michael doing Anna Karenina?
- Yes, of course I do.</i>

199
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,393
- Who did he rehearse for the part of Anna?
- You and me.

200
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,634
And?

201
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,773
And...

202
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,989
- You got pregnant.
- Yeah.

203
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:32,811
And you got 19 curtain calls.

204
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,700
Oh, Deedee.

205
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,571
Deedee...

206
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,121
- You resent me for that?
- No, not for that.

207
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,092
Would you like to change places?

208
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,647
I don't get 19 curtain calls any more.

209
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:53,453
But somebody will in something else,
and it won't be me.

210
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,517
Remember Dahkarova?

211
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,813
Well, she lives in an apartment
in Carnegie Hall that's as old as she is,

212
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:03,944
splattered with photographs
of herself as Giselle.

213
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:06,436
She coaches...

214
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:08,484
when she can.

215
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,427
She rents rooms to dancers when she can.

216
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:17,959
She was a great ballerina. She was our idol.
But Michael never considered her for Anna.

217
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,517
She was too old.

218
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:22,789
Exactly.

219
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:26,056
Well, that's a fact of life, Emma.

220
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:32,868
And I have to take class in the morning.
That's another fact of life.

221
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,700
Hi, Mom.

222
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,623
Ethan... Ethan?

223
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:01,126
Women aren't allowed in here.

224
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:03,652
I suppose the game was called
on account of rain.

225
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,791
It wasn't a game, only practice.

226
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:09,414
- You're gonna get kicked off the team.
- I won't.

227
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:12,900
- Oh, you think you're so valuable?
- No. But they do.

228
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,554
Get dressed. Out. Go home.

229
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:19,490
- It's Dad's advanced class.
- I know the schedule.

230
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:22,565
I'm not gonna miss that class,
so you can save your breath.

231
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:26,117
You save yours.
Now, get this straight, young man.

232
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:29,930
You wanna play baseball, finish practice.
You wanna dance, be on time.

233
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:34,087
I prefer baseball, because athletes last
a lot longer and make a lot more money,

234
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:38,215
but either way you follow the rules.
You got it?

235
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,484
I got it.

236
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,208
OK, second group, please.

237
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:50,859
See you in the rehearsal later. Bye.

238
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,029
Be ready.

239
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:57,067
<i>Prparation. Music start.</i>

240
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:05,579
Turn. Heel forward.

241
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:10,565
Continue. Come on, girls.
Together. Not too late.

242
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:16,779
Everywhere she's studied,
she's been on scholarship.

243
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:20,226
She studied with Carmelita
in Los Angeles, again on scholarship.

244
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:23,142
Thank you. Boys, please.

245
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:28,741
She's danced professionally
in Houston and Santa Fe.

246
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,528
Lots of money in Santa Fe.

247
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:36,866
And pause. Hold it. Pause.
Girls, continue immediately.

248
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:42,274
Arabesque. Feet close.
All the time in proper position.

249
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,507
Take the time right.

250
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:49,220
Good.

251
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:53,706
Proper ending,
and the whole combination to the left side.

252
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:57,731
Deedee and Wayne did a good job.
What do you think, Adelaide?

253
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:06,790
Dad, is it true that Yuri does doubles in the air
then a twist, and comes down on one knee?

254
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,746
- That's what I heard.
- Jesus.

255
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:12,138
My girlfriends couldn't care
if he did triples and landed in a split.

256
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:14,952
- They just like to see him in his tights.
- And you don't?

257
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,971
No. Dancers are boring. They're all in love
with themselves. It's those mirrors.

258
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,569
Dad, did you hear that?

259
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:24,130
Mom and Dad are teachers,
not dancers. You're neither.

260
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:26,504
- Is that so?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

261
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,545
- Mom...
- If you don't know by now...

262
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:32,512
- They asked me to join the company.
- Oh, Emilia.

263
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,174
Quiet. Quiet.
When do you start?

264
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:42,056
With rehearsals in New York
before the summer season.

265
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:44,260
But, Daddy, I didn't tell them I'd go.

266
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,766
- Jerk.
- Ethan!

267
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,649
- I said I wanted to think it over.
- Why, for God's sake?

268
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:52,129
'Cause she's got more brains than you.
She knows it's the fork in her road.

269
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:55,137
- The what?
- Don't laugh. It is.

270
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,926
And I want to know where I'm going.

271
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,709
Right. Why shouldn't you?

272
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:04,617
That's very smart of you, Emilia.

273
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,160
Let's eat.

274
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:12,997
The air conditioner in the office
is still on the fritz.

275
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:17,473
Yeah, I know. Thanks, hon. They said
they'd fix it first thing in the morning.

276
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:21,952
They always say that,
they just never say which morning.

277
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:28,773
Why do you think she's hesitating
aboutjoining the company?

278
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:31,426
She won't say it
but she feels funny about leaving us.

279
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,570
I do too. Even funnier.

280
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:38,755
I have this image of Janina
going off to college, and then Ethan, and...

281
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:45,093
You know that Emma travels
with these three little dogs?

282
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,706
- Would you rather Emilia didn't go?
- No.

283
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:51,623
God, no.

284
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:56,838
I don't want her to spend the rest of her life
buried here in Oklahoma City.

285
00:22:56,905 --> 00:23:00,799
I was thinking - if she does go,
you should go to New York for the summer.

286
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:02,628
You always baby her.

287
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,965
She doesn't make friends as easily as Janina.

288
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:07,520
She will, in the company.

289
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:10,559
There's always a lot ofjealousy
in the company.

290
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:15,618
Well, that never bothered you.
Why don't you go? Why should I go?

291
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:19,037
You know you wanna go,
you know we have to keep school open,

292
00:23:19,112 --> 00:23:21,959
and you know
I'm a better teacher than you are.

293
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:25,952
Only in the summer.
It's too damn hot here for me.

294
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:29,221
Besides, I can't leave the other kids.

295
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,426
Well, Janina's happy as a clam here, and she
takes good care of the house. And Ethan...

296
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:38,878
Oh, Ethan would kill
to go to New York and study.

297
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:40,927
So?

298
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,676
You know me too well.

299
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:47,810
I would love to go there.

300
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:50,749
I think you have to.

301
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:55,014
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, trying to hold onto you.

302
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:01,728
- I thought it over, but I have two questions.
- Sure.

303
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:05,153
Ethan says I'm scared of competition. I'm not.

304
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:09,572
But it's a big company,
so how much will I get to dance?

305
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,705
Depends on how good you are.

306
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:14,531
Well, how good am I?

307
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,980
Very. Now, what's the other question?

308
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:21,055
Should I know now
whether I want to stay in the company?

309
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,582
What made you ask that?

310
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:27,517
Well, it seems if you really stay,
there are things you have to give up.

311
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:34,757
You nut. You deal with that
when and if it happens.

312
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:38,532
But for now, if you know
what you want to do then you do it.

313
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:42,113
- It's not always that easy to know.
- Oh, it is for me.

314
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:44,571
I mean, I know what I want for now.

315
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,534
What?

316
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,453
Just to dance.

317
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:52,549
Then go ahead.

318
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,699
Left hand on the barre.

319
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,740
Shoulder down. Arm. And...

320
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:41,507
Grand pli.

321
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:46,755
One shoulder back.

322
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:50,650
Open. Look over your hand. Feet together.

323
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:58,497
<i>Lift your arm. Port de bras. Front. One...</i>

324
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:24,606
Watch.

325
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:27,906
No. In the middle of the movement. That's it.

326
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:30,460
Perfect.

327
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:33,020
<i>OK, now dvelopp. Pull it up. Keep your pull.</i>

328
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:36,475
One, two, three.

329
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:39,996
And one, two, three.

330
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:42,076
A little late. Three.

331
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,850
And one. Your toes will be in fifth position.

332
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:49,983
Last time. Again.

333
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,523
- Don't...
- I'm sorry.

334
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:01,890
- OK.
- That's enough.

335
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:04,858
How can you dance on it
if you can't even stand a Band-Aid?

336
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:09,120
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

337
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:13,531
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

338
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:16,573
Now, behave.
You're on a scholarship so be grateful.

339
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,131
I am. And it keeps me off the streets,
like you said.

340
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,204
You better not be so smartass
with your teachers.

341
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,541
So long, Mom.

342
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:27,840
- No.
- You don't wanna be seen with me?

343
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:31,704
- Don't you have anything better to do?
- Frankly, I don't.

344
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,121
Well, let me go first.

345
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:42,970
Control.

346
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,586
One. Stay.

347
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:50,080
And a-one.

348
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:52,154
<i>Grand finale.</i>

349
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:54,779
Shit.

350
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,442
Hello, Florence.
Is Adelaide around, by any chance?

351
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:04,376
No, sorry.
She had a fundraising meeting, Mrs Rodgers.

352
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:06,425
Deedee, Deedee.

353
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:10,401
...five, six, seven, eight.

354
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,638
One, two, three, four,

355
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:14,812
five, six, seven, eight...

356
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,698
- Sevilla. How are you?
- Oh, hello.

357
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,609
That's as far as I got.

358
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:19,008
Interesting.

359
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:21,659
Thank you, everybody.

360
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:26,648
Shall I show you your solo now?

361
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:29,720
Please do.

362
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:41,599
You have three piqu turns
to two chans and pli.

363
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:46,073
- Arabesque. Preparation fourth.
- Double pirouette, right?

364
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:48,665
You can do a single.

365
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,973
I can do a double.

366
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:56,860
- Where do you want my head here?
- Down and to the side.

367
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,904
Fascinating.

368
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:04,437
You know, Arnold, it might help
if you told me what I was playing.

369
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,520
There's no story, Emma. It's abstract.

370
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:11,579
I'm aware of that. I asked what I was playing,
not who I was playing. What am I feeling?

371
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:14,234
Nothing, Emma. You just dance.

372
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:18,102
Arnold...

373
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:21,078
you've got the wrong lady.

374
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:30,779
Just watch your blood pressure, Arnold.

375
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:35,517
I did not say that if we don't use Emma,
we won't put on your ballet.

376
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:41,083
I did say that with Emma it will get
the serious attention it deserves.

377
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:46,485
Actually,
that's why you showed it to her, isn't it?

378
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,211
I was surprised Emma Jacklin
wanted to be in it.

379
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,182
Why? Emma's always worked
with young choreographers...

380
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:54,262
Michael.

381
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,843
I'm in bad need of a new ballet, Arnold,
and you know it.

382
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:01,050
Now, we're using each other, so play fair.

383
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,581
You're very talented.

384
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:07,773
Talented enough to change it, so that
you can use me at what I can do best. Now.

385
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:11,035
I'd like to, Emma, but it's not that simple.

386
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:14,616
- Your ambivalence is showing.
- Don't get bitchy.

387
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:19,805
- I'm not referring to your sex life.
- Ballets are for dancers, not to oblige stars.

388
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:23,642
I'm afraid Arnold wants his choreography
to be the only star.

389
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:25,566
It is, and it should be.

390
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,954
So you don't want me.

391
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,931
Well, then, it is that simple.

392
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:42,171
Your choreography looked very good
on Emilia. Use her. She'll surprise you.

393
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:59,003
Back to work.

394
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:04,220
The little bastard didn't even have the grace
to talk me into staying in his bloody ballet.

395
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:07,451
Drink slowly.

396
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:11,708
<i>By the way, you and Freddie
aren't doing any Giselles this season.</i>

397
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:16,025
- Trying to scare the hiccups out of me?
- No.

398
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:18,744
Sevilla's doing two,
then she alternates with...

399
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,149
Carolyn.

400
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:23,767
You picked a lovely time to tell me, Michael.

401
00:32:23,838 --> 00:32:26,740
Better to get everything
dumped on you all at once.

402
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:29,748
Better for whom?

403
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,539
I'm the artistic director, Emma.

404
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:37,974
You tell me when and how
you'd say it to an artist you respect.

405
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:41,045
And a friend.

406
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:46,743
Poor Freddie.

407
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:50,774
You know we're only getting paid
by the performance this season.

408
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,017
No, I didn't know.

409
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:58,802
Well, the hiccups are gone, too.

410
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:19,925
Now, if I can just find
something to put these in...

411
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:24,754
You know, everything she has in here
is either an icon, a samovar or broken.

412
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:27,000
Usually all three.

413
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:32,117
- "D D Vanyo phone?"
- What?

414
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:34,938
That's what it says, I think.

415
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:41,048
Oh, that's from last night. You have to learn
how to break Dahkarova's code.

416
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:43,189
- "Wayne phoned."
- Yep.

417
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:47,729
He's so smart. He knew
if he gave me enough rope I'd hang myself.

418
00:33:47,804 --> 00:33:50,171
- How's Janina?
- She's OK.

419
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:56,117
Crazy. Hates ballet, loves Oklahoma.
How did I raise one normal child?

420
00:33:56,188 --> 00:33:59,504
Now, this will pass for a vase.

421
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,068
Oh, Em, if I could just get that teaching job.

422
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:06,810
And all I need is Adelaide's OK,
but I can't get the old bitch on the phone.

423
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:09,910
Who's she coaching?

424
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:16,214
Oh. The blonde, with the big eyes.
She's been coming over. Carolyn.

425
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:17,720
Yes.

426
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:25,755
<i>I just heard Carolyn's going
to be doing Giselle this season.</i>

427
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,642
Oh, dammit. I will not get the hiccups... again.

428
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,856
Put your arms up. How about
if I kill Adelaide? I'd like to anyway.

429
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:40,753
Don't blame Adelaide.
It's not her fault. I swore I'd quit at 35.

430
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,217
And 36, 37...

431
00:34:46,427 --> 00:34:49,013
And then I closed my eyes.

432
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,546
How old were you
when you started taking lessons?

433
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:57,205
Eight.

434
00:34:57,435 --> 00:34:58,995
I was seven.

435
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,684
- Our bodies always objected.
- I know.

436
00:35:01,755 --> 00:35:07,090
But you didn't stay around long enough
to find out they revolt.

437
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:09,913
And too soon.

438
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:12,661
They just refuse to do what one wants.

439
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:15,829
They can't.

440
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,436
But even now, there are moments
when it comes together.

441
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,765
The music, the dancing...

442
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:31,671
the lights...

443
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,626
the costumes...

444
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,124
Well, you wanted to know
what it was like to be me.

445
00:35:41,882 --> 00:35:45,427
Deedee, all I'm doing offstage
is just waiting to get back on.

446
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:52,090
How about a beer?

447
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:54,194
- I beg your pardon.
- No, tea.

448
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:56,946
- I'll make it.
- No, you sit.

449
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:05,904
- I'm gonna talk to Adelaide about yourjob.
- Don't talk to Adelaide about a damn thing.

450
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:09,969
Will you tell me something?

451
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:16,054
Why do the problems of people like you seem
so much more important than my problems?

452
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:22,866
- It's obvious. You're more important.
- Well, if I am, it's not for long.

453
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:27,760
A couple of years ago
Dahkarova was coaching me.

454
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,005
Today, Carolyn.

455
00:36:30,074 --> 00:36:32,408
But next year...

456
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,505
Emilia.

457
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:38,607
- Emilia?
- Oh, yes.

458
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:42,228
She's really that good?

459
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:46,767
- I think she's gonna do it for you, Deedee.
- That's it, that's better.

460
00:36:47,897 --> 00:36:50,614
Excuse me.
Mrs Rodgers, could...

461
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:55,699
- Emma, you're here.
- Still.

462
00:36:57,433 --> 00:37:01,491
- What do you want, Carolyn?
- A glass of water, please.

463
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,653
Ah, kettle is boiling.

464
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:10,065
- Emma.
- Madame.

465
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:18,420
- I'm sorry.
- Why? It's not your fault.

466
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:21,871
- I understand.
- Yes. I understand too.

467
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:26,833
I went through the very same thing.

468
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,526
Carolyn.

469
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:36,431
- Cup of tea?
- Thank you, Emma.

470
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:40,017
<i>Getting ready for my first performance
of Giselle is so difficult...</i>

471
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:43,088
Stop talking. Sit.

472
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,186
- Any little cakes, Deedee?
- Cakes? Certainly. Anybody else?

473
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,653
- I'd love some. What kind do you...
- No.

474
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,045
- Hello, Momma.
- Hi, sweetie. How...

475
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,738
Emma. Hello, Mme Dahkarova. Hello, Carolyn.

476
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,815
Emma, Arnold was so mean after you left.

477
00:37:56,887 --> 00:38:00,183
- But he'll give you the part?
- I knew it was your idea.

478
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,895
- Would you like some tea, darling? Emilia?
- Please.

479
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:05,389
- A lot of Arnold's scowls and mutterings?
- Yes.

480
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:07,635
- You'll get the part.
- What part?

481
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,573
- In Arnold's new ballet.
- Who, Arnold? Good ballet?

482
00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:12,557
It's a good part for Emilia.

483
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:15,632
Then you must help and coach her.

484
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,152
All right.

485
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:24,594
I will.

486
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:27,730
But, Emma... you? Coaching?

487
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,589
Nonsense. I do it. It's necessary
to teach someone else be good like me.

488
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:35,892
But, Madame, you don't... You're not...

489
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:39,090
I don't what? I'm not what?

490
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:43,981
I think what Carolyn means is that
you don't dance any more and I do.

491
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,160
- Who helped you the most?
- Kschessinska.

492
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:48,725
From Mariinsky to me.

493
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:52,468
From me to you while I still was dancing.

494
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:59,889
<i>Now to Carolyn, and very soon to you, Emilia,
if you work sur les pointes every day.</i>

495
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:37,934
- Opening nights are so exciting.
- Aren't they?

496
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:41,137
<i>I wish you were doing
the first Giselle tonight, not Sevilla.</i>

497
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:44,686
It takes all the running you can do
to stay in the same place.

498
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,645
Pardon?

499
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,059
<i>It's from Alice in Wonderland, dear.</i>

500
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:54,705
- It goes down a little bit?
- No, itjust follows the natural line.

501
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:56,879
Yeah, just outjust a little bit.

502
00:39:56,949 --> 00:39:58,575
- Can I try it again?
- Sure.

503
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:02,165
It's wonderful.

504
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:14,671
Remind me to ask you about something.

505
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:43,628
And one and two and three and four

506
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:46,217
and five and six and seven and eight.

507
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:49,034
And three. Two and three and four

508
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:51,788
and five and six and seven. Close eight.

509
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:59,022
A little faster.

510
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:12,871
- Not bad.
- Don't spoil me, dear.

511
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,880
Well, would you rather
I buttered you up like Adelaide does?

512
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:18,919
Why don't we butter each other up?

513
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:24,492
You're revolting. And about as subtle as she
is. This morning she came up to me and said:

514
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:28,815
"Sevilla, dearie, you're the greatest
prima ballerina in the whole world."

515
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:30,091
No, I am.

516
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:33,706
Gosh, that is awkward.
We ought to try that again, that lift.

517
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:37,835
The reason Adelaide goes on and on is
she knows I want to dance in Milan and Rio.

518
00:44:37,905 --> 00:44:41,614
- She's determined I'll do that bloody tour.
- Well, you don't say no.

519
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:46,056
- That's exactly what Richard said.
- Who is Richard?

520
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:49,031
- Sevilla, long-distance phone call for you.
- Coming.

521
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,471
Excuse me, please. I won't be a moment.

522
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:54,896
Richard is why
I'm not going to end up like Emma.

523
00:44:56,145 --> 00:45:00,552
I hate to be interrupted for phone calls.
Could I have the second cast, please?

524
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:04,715
Let's go from the wheelbarrow.
Ready? And...

525
00:49:56,715 --> 00:49:59,104
You can turn on the light, it's OK.

526
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:02,757
- I didn't mean to wake you.
- You didn't.

527
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:08,036
I was with Yuri.

528
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:14,626
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yes.

529
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:17,415
I've been taking the pill.

530
00:50:17,483 --> 00:50:19,817
Just in case.

531
00:50:19,914 --> 00:50:22,532
Good God.

532
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:26,595
There's nothing to worry about.
Go to sleep now.

533
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:42,761
- Don't you wanna talk?
- No.

534
00:50:42,826 --> 00:50:45,247
It might spoil it.

535
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:48,710
- Go back to bed. Sleep well.
- Oh, Emilia.

536
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,949
- Be glad for me, Momma.
- I am.

537
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:57,189
I am, I just didn't think it would...
it would be so soon that you...

538
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:59,843
That I what?

539
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:04,062
That you wouldn'tjust... wanna dance.

540
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:06,112
Oh, Mom.

541
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:09,857
Go back to bed.

542
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:11,903
Go on. It's OK.

543
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:16,929
Go on.

544
00:51:28,745 --> 00:51:30,054
- How are you?
- OK.

545
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,128
Let's go.

546
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:57,831
About once a week,
Dad and I would check out all the new stuff.

547
00:51:57,896 --> 00:52:03,842
And Emma and I would go up to the third
floor, try on all the most expensive dresses.

548
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,181
Once we stayed so long
we missed rehearsals...

549
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:09,191
Hey, I'll see you later.

550
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:12,580
...stay up there for hours,
trying these dresses...

551
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:14,819
Oh, Rosie.

552
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:20,450
- Meet my children. This is Emilia and Ethan.
- Hi.

553
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,836
Joe Rosenberg, the conductor
of the company when Dad and I were in it.

554
00:52:23,912 --> 00:52:26,661
- He was the best.
- I still am.

555
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:28,833
Only now I conduct musicals.

556
00:52:28,903 --> 00:52:32,831
More bread and a permanent pad.
Hey, where are you goin'?

557
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:36,132
There. We live at Carnegie Hall.
How's your wife, Joe?

558
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,534
Which one? I've had two since I last saw you.

559
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,575
No. Well, how's all three of them?

560
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:42,851
Dynamite. I never see 'em.

561
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,753
- How's whatshisname?
- Wayne.

562
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:49,987
In Oklahoma with our other daughter.
We're here for the summer.

563
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:53,219
Terrific. I'm loose.

564
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:58,503
You gave up the ballet
to conduct on Broadway?

565
00:52:58,567 --> 00:53:03,171
- You are a man without soul.
- And you are a woman without wine.

566
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:06,399
- Did he bring this wine?
- Yes, he brought it.

567
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:08,097
Taste, he got.

568
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:11,483
- You have much soul, darling.
- But not much taste.

569
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:13,501
Correct.

570
00:53:13,575 --> 00:53:15,647
- I'll get it.
- "I'll get it."

571
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:17,661
Shut up.

572
00:53:17,735 --> 00:53:19,742
Hello?

573
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:27,039
- Deedee, it's honor to Emilia.
- "Honor"?

574
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:32,228
- Yuri is the best dancer I know in years.
- Of course, my dear. He's Russian.

575
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:34,430
Correct.

576
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:37,153
And, believe it or not,
Linda's been accepted at Yale.

577
00:53:37,222 --> 00:53:39,710
I guess nobody wants
to go to Princeton any more.

578
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,692
Well, obviously not my kids.

579
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:45,628
All five picked different schools,
but not one picks my alma mater.

580
00:53:45,702 --> 00:53:49,695
- Would you say that was a reflection on me?
- No, Carter.

581
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:52,221
I'd say that was a reflection on Princeton.

582
00:53:52,486 --> 00:53:54,875
You're biased.

583
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,154
For years.

584
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:04,099
- Excuse me, Miss Jacklin.
- Just put 'em down anywhere.

585
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:13,534
- Obviously I can't kiss you here.
- It wouldn't upset me.

586
00:54:13,606 --> 00:54:16,027
It might upset Maggie.

587
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:18,207
Enough to give you a divorce?

588
00:54:18,438 --> 00:54:22,213
All I'd have to do is ask for a divorce, Emma.
You know that.

589
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:23,866
Well?

590
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:28,098
- Would you give up dancing?
- Why not?

591
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:31,581
I asked you 15 years ago. 14 years ago. 13.

592
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:33,923
Ask me now.

593
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:39,708
You know, I...

594
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:44,571
I've always wondered -
what do you do with all these flowers?

595
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:49,090
Give them to hospitals.

596
00:54:51,845 --> 00:54:53,819
Emma...

597
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:57,891
You know one of the reasons
we've lasted so long?

598
00:54:57,989 --> 00:54:59,713
Tell me another, Carter.

599
00:54:59,781 --> 00:55:04,799
Because the whole arrangement
has suited you. You liked the limitations.

600
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,445
I'm not so sure I do any more.

601
00:55:10,117 --> 00:55:12,419
Well, now I do.

602
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:14,656
I'm sorry.

603
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:20,865
So am I.

604
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:22,908
Come in.

605
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:29,443
Well, I guess I'd better be running along.

606
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:34,714
Would you rather I didn't stop by later?

607
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:37,953
No, stop by.

608
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,086
We might as well finish out the season.

609
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:43,523
See you later.

610
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:56,769
Really, you are crazy. Stay.

611
00:55:56,836 --> 00:56:00,862
- Yuri, my mother would have a fit.
- Then she is also crazy.

612
00:56:00,932 --> 00:56:04,063
She's just a very proper lady.

613
00:56:04,132 --> 00:56:06,914
- You're crazy. I can't.
- Yes.

614
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,939
- Half an hour, then.
- No, all night.

615
00:56:16,387 --> 00:56:18,427
Please.

616
00:56:18,499 --> 00:56:20,474
Why?

617
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:24,539
I'm homesick.

618
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:33,407
Now turn your back
to the new direction and look up.

619
00:56:33,796 --> 00:56:36,992
Spot over your hand-arm line.

620
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:40,059
OK, good. Second group, please.

621
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:48,736
<i>Let's do a port de bras. Be ready.</i>

622
00:56:48,803 --> 00:56:50,494
And...

623
00:56:50,563 --> 00:56:52,832
Don't tighten your shoulder.

624
00:56:52,898 --> 00:56:54,524
Very soft.

625
00:56:57,635 --> 00:56:59,806
- You're late.
- Why you come so late?

626
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,046
Stuck in the bathroom.

627
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:08,092
- Boys, see the ink lighters?
- Lines. Together.

628
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:12,417
- They're flashing.
- Straight lines, please. Arms. Don't forget.

629
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:50,204
I had more than
just the hots for you back then.

630
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:53,598
But back then I didn't look so good in tights.

631
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:56,481
Now the toe shoe's on the other foot.

632
00:57:56,546 --> 00:57:58,433
- Is it, now?
- Yeah.

633
00:57:58,498 --> 00:58:00,669
Now we both don't look so good in tights.

634
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,868
- You speak for yourself.
- I am.

635
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:07,865
I can open up new vistas for you, my sweet.

636
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:12,791
Dancers are dumb.

637
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:16,608
I mean, what do you know?
Babies and ballet, right?

638
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:20,863
Well, what do you know
except for music and divorce, right?

639
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:24,988
One moment for station identification, please.

640
00:58:25,057 --> 00:58:29,115
Books. Corruption. Dirty pictures.

641
00:58:33,057 --> 00:58:35,097
Divorce is a bummer,

642
00:58:35,169 --> 00:58:37,056
violets are blue.

643
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:40,155
Tchaikovsky is great...

644
00:58:40,385 --> 00:58:42,010
and so are you.

645
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:46,108
That's nice. I needed that.

646
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:53,856
Back in the icebox age,
I had an apartment on West 52nd Street. You...

647
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,473
You left before the best part.

648
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:02,041
- You don't remember, do you?
- Yes, I do.

649
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:04,600
It was over ajazz joint.

650
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,977
Don't... leave now.

651
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,007
- Feel better?
- Much.

652
00:59:55,072 --> 00:59:58,454
- It was my own fault, Yuri.
- Nah.

653
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,724
- I was so nervous.
- Why?

654
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:06,613
You're so fabulous. And I have weak knees.

655
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,859
I like girls with weak knees.

656
01:00:08,928 --> 01:00:11,797
- You just like girls.
- Very much. Is wrong?

657
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:18,232
No. I personally think everyone should have
the right to make their own choice.

658
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:20,983
- I like yours.
- My what?

659
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:23,160
Your choice.

660
01:00:23,231 --> 01:00:27,607
- I'm sorry. My English...
- No, it's mine. I have trouble sometimes.

661
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,186
Carolyn, you know,
it sometimes better... not to talk.

662
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:36,887
- I agree. And particularly with me, because...
- Carolyn.

663
01:00:40,255 --> 01:00:42,011
Yes?

664
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,164
Hello?

665
01:01:26,238 --> 01:01:28,889
<i>- Emilia?
- Daddy.</i>

666
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,780
Hi.

667
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:34,006
How are you? How's Janina?

668
01:01:34,077 --> 01:01:39,707
Janina's taking care of me just fine.
And she's great at the school.

669
01:01:39,774 --> 01:01:41,018
That's good.

670
01:01:41,086 --> 01:01:45,494
Listen, I really had forgotten
how much later it is there.

671
01:01:45,566 --> 01:01:48,118
Daddy, did you hear about
my part in the ballet?

672
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:51,670
- Yeah, Ma wrote that you got the lead.
- Yeah.

673
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:57,939
Well, don't let that Arnold Berger scare you.
You just sic your boyfriend on him, OK?

674
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,021
How is he, by the way?

675
01:02:01,406 --> 01:02:04,667
He's OK. I don't really have time
for that sort of thing.

676
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:12,697
I don't wonder. You know, they always work
you a lot harder when you're really good.

677
01:02:14,077 --> 01:02:17,044
Put Ma on for a minute, will you?

678
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:22,780
Mom's with Emma. They're always yakking.
Sometimes she even stays over.

679
01:02:27,773 --> 01:02:30,195
Yeah, well, that's good.

680
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:36,188
You have her call me when she gets a chance,
OK? Meantime, you get back to bed, and...

681
01:02:36,445 --> 01:02:39,827
Daddy, could you come to New York soon?

682
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:42,137
You bet, honey.

683
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:46,677
Soon as school finishes, Janina and I are
gonna get on the first plane out of here. OK?

684
01:02:46,748 --> 01:02:49,530
Yes. I love you, Daddy.

685
01:02:49,597 --> 01:02:51,931
I love you too.

686
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,827
- Bye.
- Bye.

687
01:03:10,716 --> 01:03:12,723
Up late?

688
01:03:13,596 --> 01:03:15,058
Good morning, darling.

689
01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:18,743
Daddy called last night.
I told him you were with Emma.

690
01:03:18,811 --> 01:03:22,553
- Why didn't you wake me?
- It was very late.

691
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:25,041
Daddy and Janina send their love.

692
01:03:25,116 --> 01:03:28,149
Emilia, what time are you
having your lunch today?

693
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:31,568
I'm busy.
Goodbye, Madame, Ethan.

694
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:34,906
Something's funny.

695
01:03:38,108 --> 01:03:40,791
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three four.

696
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,964
Three, two, three, four.
Four, two, three four.

697
01:03:43,035 --> 01:03:46,810
Five, two, three, four.
Six, two, three, four.

698
01:03:48,187 --> 01:03:49,616
Emilia...

699
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:53,040
all that emotion is terrific...

700
01:03:53,116 --> 01:03:55,571
<i>for the mad scene in Giselle, not for my ballet.</i>

701
01:03:55,644 --> 01:04:00,116
You're not an uptight village virgin. You're
just a body moving in space with music.

702
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:02,097
<i>Not to music, with music.</i>

703
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:05,880
That's what dancing is. So please
don't fly around the room emoting.

704
01:04:05,947 --> 01:04:10,104
Don't think. Just move as I tell you to move
to the counts I give you. OK?

705
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:12,145
I don't count.

706
01:04:12,379 --> 01:04:14,550
Then how do you know
what to do when? ESP?

707
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:18,132
I feel it, with the music. And I make it fit.

708
01:04:18,203 --> 01:04:21,399
Well, don't feel it. Count it.

709
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:23,059
Where were we, Peter?

710
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:26,872
Bar 132... with no feeling, please.

711
01:04:44,826 --> 01:04:48,470
- Look over here. Cute, ain't she?
- She's real pretty.

712
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:58,423
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

713
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:02,865
I was wondering if you could
settle a little wager we just made.

714
01:05:02,938 --> 01:05:07,543
We're from out of town,
and we bet you are too.

715
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,617
Right?

716
01:05:10,554 --> 01:05:12,528
See, I knew it.

717
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:15,601
Bartender, get us another round over here.

718
01:05:16,762 --> 01:05:22,457
- This is...
- I'm Barney Joe. Lake Charles, Louisiana.

719
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:24,529
And...

720
01:05:26,809 --> 01:05:30,704
I'm Bill Britt, from Amarillo, West Texas.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

721
01:05:30,778 --> 01:05:32,982
Where are you from?

722
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,116
Leningrad, Soviet Union.

723
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:39,699
No kidding? What are you doing here?

724
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,836
I need artistic freedom.

725
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:44,913
Hey, what are you, anyway?

726
01:05:44,985 --> 01:05:48,629
Artist. Is why I need artistic freedom.

727
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:54,958
That blows me away.

728
01:06:02,137 --> 01:06:05,682
Now, what are you
saving them cherries for?

729
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,808
I save them for supper.

730
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:16,627
- Oh, no.
- What?

731
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:19,598
- Is time to go.
- Oh, no, don't leave.

732
01:06:28,856 --> 01:06:33,591
Hey, you forgot your...
You forgot your briefcase.

733
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:37,169
Listen, why don't you come on back, now?

734
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,156
I have a marvelous man for that, Sevilla.

735
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,936
No injections, Emma.
I faint at the sight of a needle.

736
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:48,790
Just massage.
I'll leave his number in your room.

737
01:06:48,856 --> 01:06:51,027
- Thank you, darling.
- Clear the stage.

738
01:06:51,128 --> 01:06:53,778
Would everyone clear the stage?

739
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:59,505
Take the house to half. Conductor, stand by.

740
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:02,708
Hi.

741
01:07:03,672 --> 01:07:06,486
What in the world did you take?

742
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:12,530
Cherries, for remembrance.

743
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:16,724
Let me out of here.

744
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,700
- Here.
- It's cold in here.

745
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,375
You can do it. You can do it.

746
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:34,189
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

747
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:10,865
Something's wrong.

748
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:13,488
I'm not quite sure, but she's really wonked.

749
01:09:17,429 --> 01:09:19,120
Sorry.

750
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:29,037
Take this. Hang on. You'll be OK.

751
01:09:33,717 --> 01:09:39,696
Not a word to Adelaide. I'll tell you
all about it in my dressing room. Bye-bye.

752
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:47,435
- Emilia...
- She's OK.

753
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,002
Go.

754
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,825
Yes, I agree.

755
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:24,017
The right partner is absolutely essential.
And Michael was so good for me.

756
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:27,978
- What happened?
- He became a choreographer.

757
01:10:28,052 --> 01:10:32,940
Now, my dear child...
you should get some sleep.

758
01:10:33,012 --> 01:10:34,987
Oh, not yet.

759
01:10:36,084 --> 01:10:38,767
I meant, what happened
between you and Michael?

760
01:10:41,812 --> 01:10:46,700
- Priorities.
- He liked boys better than girls?

761
01:10:46,771 --> 01:10:49,804
Not then. I... Well, how should I know?

762
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:53,552
We didn't talk about it
quite so openly in those days.

763
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:56,172
I meant Michael knew
that my priority was dancing.

764
01:10:56,243 --> 01:10:58,829
Are you sorry?

765
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:03,820
No, I don't believe in being sorry.
We are what we are.

766
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,899
Am I like you?

767
01:11:07,539 --> 01:11:10,124
I don't know.

768
01:11:10,195 --> 01:11:14,156
- Now, listen, shouldn't you call home?
- I'd only wake Ethan.

769
01:11:14,419 --> 01:11:17,168
Emma, I've stayed at Yuri's a lot.

770
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:21,964
Emilia, you continually surprise me.

771
01:11:22,035 --> 01:11:23,791
And me.

772
01:11:23,858 --> 01:11:26,673
I wish I knew who I was.

773
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:28,975
- You will.
- When?

774
01:11:29,043 --> 01:11:32,752
Something happens.
There's always a moment.

775
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:36,114
- Maybe when Yuri wants to come back.
- I don't want him back.

776
01:11:36,211 --> 01:11:39,822
Course, I'd love to dance with him,
and I love going to bed with him.

777
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:43,720
But I wanted it to be more,
and that gets in the way, doesn't it?

778
01:11:43,795 --> 01:11:45,966
Which do you want the most?

779
01:11:48,947 --> 01:11:52,721
Both? Well, that's something to dream about.

780
01:11:56,882 --> 01:11:59,435
- Good night.
- Good night.

781
01:12:04,498 --> 01:12:05,960
Emma?

782
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:08,489
It's so nice here.

783
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:10,570
I'm glad.

784
01:12:19,347 --> 01:12:21,550
...I have simply got to reach him.

785
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:23,658
- May I?
- Of course.

786
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:26,578
- Hello, Emma.
- Michael, your call to London.

787
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:28,912
I'll take it here.

788
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:35,623
Emma, look at the poster Michael unearthed.
Our very first gala performance.

789
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:40,073
- You were still dancing. You too, Michael.
- You were in the corps de ballet.

790
01:12:40,178 --> 01:12:42,001
Well, I'm behind a desk now.

791
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:45,841
Never mind. We've all kept this company
going, and that's what matters.

792
01:12:45,906 --> 01:12:49,899
Yes, another year, another gala.
They remind me of the Olympics.

793
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:53,450
Dearie, you're not nervous after all this time?

794
01:12:53,522 --> 01:12:55,977
All right, I'll call back in an hour.

795
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:58,385
This is going to be a super gala.

796
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:01,068
Marcia and Richard
are coming from Stuttgart, and...

797
01:13:01,138 --> 01:13:04,935
- Do you suppose they'll travel tourist?
- Now, Adelaide.

798
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,654
I hear you're also going to do
Arnold's new ballet.

799
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:09,550
Dearie...

800
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:13,098
No, no. I was just wondering
if Emilia was going to be invited to the party.

801
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:16,013
So she will.

802
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:45,640
It's very pretty.

803
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:52,550
Why are you angry?

804
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,152
- Why are you?
- I'm not.

805
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:57,995
You damn well are, you're just
covering it up with ice, like Emma.

806
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:04,011
That horny little Russian behaved
like a bastard so you take it out on me.

807
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:12,325
I didn't hide anything from you.
I brought Rosie here. You knew exactly...

808
01:14:12,401 --> 01:14:15,500
- I gotta wash my hair.
- Come here. Come here, Emilia.

809
01:14:15,569 --> 01:14:20,970
You'll sit down. I wanna talk,
you'll listen to me. I'm still your mother.

810
01:14:31,664 --> 01:14:37,676
When Daddy and Janina come,
do you want them to see us like this?

811
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:42,152
You wanna hurt them too?

812
01:14:44,656 --> 01:14:48,747
- Talk. Can we talk it out?
- There's nothing to talk about.

813
01:14:48,816 --> 01:14:51,402
Stop punishing me.

814
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:55,023
Look at me.

815
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:57,608
Look at me, please.

816
01:14:59,984 --> 01:15:04,970
You know, Daddy and I have been
away from each other all summer.

817
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,495
Daddy wouldn't do what you did.

818
01:15:07,568 --> 01:15:10,950
- How do you know?
- I know Daddy.

819
01:15:11,023 --> 01:15:13,445
Like you know Yuri?

820
01:15:14,992 --> 01:15:19,945
I'm the only louse?
Come on, Emilia. Be fair.

821
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,520
You hurt, I... I know.

822
01:15:25,775 --> 01:15:29,320
And I understand. I can help you.

823
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:33,701
Let me. Don't shut me out, sweetheart.
We're friends.

824
01:15:33,775 --> 01:15:36,677
Nobody can help you better than I can.

825
01:15:36,751 --> 01:15:38,922
Nobody knows you better than I do. Nobody.

826
01:15:39,023 --> 01:15:43,845
Momma. You're really just
angry about Emma, aren't you?

827
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:45,577
No.

828
01:15:45,647 --> 01:15:48,549
Emilia, I love you.

829
01:15:48,847 --> 01:15:50,669
I may have seemed like a monster,

830
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:55,623
but it was to help you understand what my
ballet is, not what you wanted to make it. I...

831
01:15:55,695 --> 01:15:59,011
Bravo, Arnold. Keep talking like that.
She'll be more hysterical.

832
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,574
- I'm not hysterical.
- I'm not hysterical either.

833
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,843
- I don't know why you're not.
- What do you mean by that?

834
01:16:04,911 --> 01:16:08,489
Maybe you're right. Some lousy gala,
biggest night of season.

835
01:16:08,559 --> 01:16:10,948
It's only your biggest opportunity...

836
01:16:11,054 --> 01:16:14,699
Emilia's biggest opportunity...
It's really nothing special.

837
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:17,701
- I have to go to the john again.
- Are you all right?

838
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:20,873
Don't worry about him. He'll be all right.

839
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:25,317
I have little secret for you. You know,
I think it's perfectly all right to be nervous.

840
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:28,488
- Really?
- Really. I know.

841
01:16:28,558 --> 01:16:30,827
Dance well.

842
01:16:32,014 --> 01:16:36,454
I'm not at all surprised. You know,
if we sell out the last two weeks,

843
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:40,454
we end the season
with a deficit of less than 80,000.

844
01:16:40,526 --> 01:16:43,493
- Imagine.
- About the price of your necklace.

845
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:45,671
Oh, no, Dennis. This is paste.

846
01:16:45,742 --> 01:16:48,076
The real one went for...

847
01:16:48,142 --> 01:16:50,891
- What did it go for, Michael?
- The musicians' strike.

848
01:16:50,957 --> 01:16:53,379
Oh, yes. Pigs.

849
01:16:53,454 --> 01:16:58,855
Oh, hello, Mrs Stewart. I love the Stewarts.
They gave us $25,000 last year.

850
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:01,132
Emilia?

851
01:17:01,294 --> 01:17:03,977
Oh, don't you look nice.

852
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:09,293
- You should see the glamour out front.
- I don't wanna think about it.

853
01:17:09,357 --> 01:17:12,423
<i>- You're doing Anna.
- The suicide scene.</i>

854
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:17,512
All the other ladies will be in short tutus
and do at least a hundred pirouettes.

855
01:17:17,581 --> 01:17:21,607
So this not-so-young lady will be
covered to the floor and act up a storm.

856
01:17:21,677 --> 01:17:23,881
This is a knockout.

857
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:26,338
Wanna be my date for the party?

858
01:17:26,413 --> 01:17:29,315
- Or do you have one?
- No, that's kaput.

859
01:17:29,389 --> 01:17:33,131
Terrific dress you gave Emilia, too.
But you shouldn't have.

860
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:37,476
Why not? She's my godchild.

861
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:40,897
You just shouldn't have, that's all. Good luck.

862
01:18:42,988 --> 01:18:47,046
Even now, there are moments
when it all comes together.

863
01:18:47,115 --> 01:18:50,431
The dancing, the music, the lights...

864
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,447
Your mother chose to get married.

865
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:29,376
You got 19 curtain calls.

866
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:32,765
And you got pregnant.

867
01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:17,309
I can't watch it any more.
They're too old for it. That depresses me.

868
01:23:17,382 --> 01:23:19,935
I'm too old to do another one.
That depresses me more.

869
01:23:20,006 --> 01:23:24,349
It's a beautiful ballet, Michael.
It'll live forever.

870
01:23:24,423 --> 01:23:26,430
Why can't we?

871
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:29,699
Why aren't you watching?

872
01:23:29,766 --> 01:23:34,338
It hurts. I keep seeing me and Emma
rehearsing for you.

873
01:23:36,742 --> 01:23:40,004
Hey, if I ask you a question,
will you answer me truthfully?

874
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,477
What?

875
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:47,390
Jesus, can you believe this?
I've wanted to ask it for 20 years.

876
01:23:47,462 --> 01:23:49,349
OK.

877
01:23:52,646 --> 01:23:56,672
If I hadn't been pregnant, would you have
used me as Anna instead of Emma?

878
01:23:58,182 --> 01:24:01,444
I don't remember, Deedee.

879
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:05,343
Honestly, I don't.

880
01:24:05,414 --> 01:24:08,065
I wish to God I didn't.

881
01:24:11,045 --> 01:24:14,722
Hurry up. You're going to miss my ballet.

882
01:25:15,908 --> 01:25:19,072
I think she's gonna do it for you, Deedee.

883
01:25:45,604 --> 01:25:47,709
It's wonderful.

884
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,951
I've gotta take my bow.

885
01:26:57,058 --> 01:27:01,433
- To Emilia, dearie.
- I'm so glad for her.

886
01:27:01,506 --> 01:27:05,914
Tradition is continuity,
and thank God I've lived to see it.

887
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,303
Second generation in our own family.

888
01:27:09,379 --> 01:27:13,307
And yours, of course. Now,
what should we do with our baby ballerina?

889
01:27:13,698 --> 01:27:17,081
<i>I think she'd be lovely in Sleeping Beauty.</i>

890
01:27:17,346 --> 01:27:20,695
Perfect. We'll warm her up this season,

891
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:24,032
and then she'll warm up the box office
the next season.

892
01:27:24,098 --> 01:27:26,815
- Do you want to tell her?
- No.

893
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:30,105
- I think it's a fabulous idea.
- I do too.

894
01:27:30,338 --> 01:27:34,397
Isn't it wonderful? Aren't you excited?
I'm so proud of you. I was so excited...

895
01:28:03,809 --> 01:28:06,776
- Has anyone seen my bitch of a wife?
- Now, dearie.

896
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:09,020
<i>Very smart of you to do Anna.</i>

897
01:28:09,089 --> 01:28:12,537
Next time you'll have to lift me, Emma.
My back is ready for traction.

898
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:14,780
- Oh, poor Freddie.
- It's worth it.

899
01:28:14,849 --> 01:28:18,297
- You know what we'd like you to do, Emma?
- A new ballet?

900
01:28:18,369 --> 01:28:21,369
- Tradition makes a company...
- This is "tradition" night.

901
01:28:21,441 --> 01:28:23,677
Oh, shut up, Michael.

902
01:28:23,745 --> 01:28:27,836
<i>I'd like to restore the full-length
Sleeping Beauty to our repertoire.</i>

903
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:31,483
Oh, thank you very much,
but I don't think I could dance that any more.

904
01:28:31,553 --> 01:28:34,848
No. But you could stage it.

905
01:28:34,913 --> 01:28:38,393
You know it inside out.
It'd be fun, a new challenge.

906
01:28:38,497 --> 01:28:42,839
She'd do it beautifully.
Don't you think so, Michael?

907
01:28:42,912 --> 01:28:46,327
I think your timing's lousy, Adelaide.

908
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,590
Excuse me.
I really must do something to my face.

909
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,696
For God's sake, Adelaide.

910
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,437
Dearie, even Emma has to move on.

911
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:04,570
Like all the rest of us.

912
01:29:07,296 --> 01:29:09,817
Hello, Deedee.

913
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:12,375
Champagne, please.

914
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,367
Emma?

915
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:38,554
Do you remember the fairy tales
we used to take turns reading to Emilia?

916
01:29:38,655 --> 01:29:41,819
Like the one about the two princesses?

917
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,357
Every time one would open her mouth,

918
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:50,107
out came diamonds and rubies.

919
01:29:50,367 --> 01:29:55,669
Every time the other one opened her mouth,
out came newts and hoptoads.

920
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:00,607
Newts and hoptoads, coming out.

921
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:05,593
Yes.

922
01:30:05,663 --> 01:30:09,592
One of those little toads
has already made an appearance.

923
01:30:09,663 --> 01:30:13,339
- Really? When?
- Tonight, in my dressing room.

924
01:30:13,407 --> 01:30:16,854
When you said I shouldn't have
bought that dress for Emilia.

925
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:20,756
Twice you said it. Just before a performance.

926
01:30:22,654 --> 01:30:26,680
I danced better tonight than I have in years.

927
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,758
So I heard.

928
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:37,076
Another little toad. You must have kept
quite a few bottled up all these years.

929
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:39,833
No.

930
01:30:39,903 --> 01:30:41,910
Embalmed, really.

931
01:30:41,983 --> 01:30:44,536
No, I think not.

932
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:48,665
Why don't you let them out?
I don't have a performance tomorrow.

933
01:30:50,686 --> 01:30:52,508
OK.

934
01:30:56,862 --> 01:30:59,131
Pick.

935
01:31:02,878 --> 01:31:06,839
This is a tiny little one.
I'd practically forgotten him.

936
01:31:09,854 --> 01:31:15,036
Why'd you make your best pal doubt herself?
And her hubby? Why, Emma?

937
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:18,450
Why'd you take the chance
of lousing up her marriage?

938
01:31:18,525 --> 01:31:22,616
Why'd you say, "You better have that baby.
If you don't you'll never hold onto Wayne?"

939
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:25,533
I'm just curious.

940
01:31:25,597 --> 01:31:28,444
You have a curious memory.

941
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:33,911
But don't we all. As I remember, I said if you
had an abortion you might lose Wayne.

942
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:36,665
No. That's sweet, but that's inaccurate.

943
01:31:36,733 --> 01:31:39,700
I remember exactly your words.

944
01:31:39,773 --> 01:31:42,839
For lo, these too many moons.

945
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:47,165
And eventually I figured out why you
said 'em, because I also remember...

946
01:31:47,389 --> 01:31:50,967
that you said, " Forget about Michael's ballet,
there'll be others."

947
01:31:51,037 --> 01:31:53,404
You clever little twinkle-toes.

948
01:31:54,749 --> 01:31:58,643
You knew a ballet like that comes along
once in a career, and you wanted it.

949
01:31:58,717 --> 01:32:00,953
Real bad.

950
01:32:01,021 --> 01:32:03,770
So you lied to make sure
you got what you wanted.

951
01:32:03,837 --> 01:32:06,390
I never had to lie to get what I wanted.
I'm too good.

952
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:07,955
Really.

953
01:32:08,925 --> 01:32:09,907
Yes.

954
01:32:09,981 --> 01:32:14,323
And I suppose if you said "bullshit"
you'd say it in French, wouldn't you?

955
01:32:14,397 --> 01:32:18,423
If that word came as naturally to me as to you
I'd have used it several times by now.

956
01:32:18,493 --> 01:32:20,500
In English.

957
01:32:20,572 --> 01:32:23,671
But I think it's more appropriate
that you say it to yourself,

958
01:32:23,741 --> 01:32:27,418
for trying to blame me for what you did.

959
01:32:28,508 --> 01:32:31,355
Deedee, the choice was yours.

960
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,039
It's much too late to regret it now.

961
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,775
The same to you, Emma, me darlin'.

962
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:46,933
I don't regret mine.

963
01:32:47,004 --> 01:32:51,477
Then why are you trying
to become a mother at your age?

964
01:32:53,404 --> 01:32:57,976
That's not a little toad.
That's rather a large bullfrog.

965
01:32:58,044 --> 01:33:02,037
I don't wanna be anybody's mother.
I think of Emilia as a friend.

966
01:33:02,107 --> 01:33:05,653
And one reason I tried to help - stupid me -

967
01:33:05,724 --> 01:33:09,619
I thought you'd be happy if your daughter
became what you never could be.

968
01:33:09,691 --> 01:33:13,106
Meaning you. It's so lovely to be you?

969
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:16,656
- Well, obviously you think so.
- No.

970
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,824
And anyway, I doubt if
Emilia could become you.

971
01:33:20,892 --> 01:33:25,048
She's as talented as you are,
and she works as hard.

972
01:33:28,379 --> 01:33:31,991
There's one thing, dearest friend, that you are,

973
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:34,962
that Emilia, poor darling, is not.

974
01:33:35,036 --> 01:33:37,491
And what, pray tell, is that?

975
01:33:37,563 --> 01:33:40,116
A killer.

976
01:33:41,435 --> 01:33:45,047
You'd walk over anybody
and still get a good night's sleep.

977
01:33:45,115 --> 01:33:49,555
That exactly how you got
where you are, Emma.

978
01:34:06,011 --> 01:34:07,953
Good girl.

979
01:34:08,602 --> 01:34:10,610
Deedee...

980
01:34:14,074 --> 01:34:15,667
Deedee...

981
01:34:15,738 --> 01:34:18,389
- I'm sick to death of yourjealousy.
- So am I.

982
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:20,498
Stop blaming your life on me. You picked it.

983
01:34:20,603 --> 01:34:23,505
You picked it. You never let me
find out if I was good enough.

984
01:34:23,578 --> 01:34:28,085
- You weren't. That's why you married Wayne.
- I loved Wayne.

985
01:34:28,314 --> 01:34:31,729
So you said to hell with your career
and got pregnant to prove you meant it?

986
01:34:31,802 --> 01:34:34,420
- Yes.
- Don't lie to me, lie to yourself.

987
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:36,595
You knew you were second-rate.

988
01:34:36,666 --> 01:34:40,146
You got pregnant because Wayne
was a dancer and that meant "queer" then.

989
01:34:40,378 --> 01:34:43,095
- To prove he was a man, you had a baby.
- That's a goddamn lie.

990
01:34:43,353 --> 01:34:46,899
It's the truth and you know it. You saddled
him with a baby and blew his career.

991
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:49,588
Now she's better than you were
and you're jealous.

992
01:34:49,658 --> 01:34:52,080
You're certifiable.
You'll use any excuse.

993
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:54,674
- What excuse?
- For trying to take away my child.

994
01:34:54,746 --> 01:34:58,608
- I return the compliment. You're a liar.
- And you're a user. You know that?

995
01:34:58,682 --> 01:35:00,885
You're a user, and you always have been.

996
01:35:00,953 --> 01:35:04,630
First me, and then Michael.
Pretending to be in love with Michael.

997
01:35:04,697 --> 01:35:07,796
Then Adelaide, and now Emilia.

998
01:35:07,865 --> 01:35:09,840
- How Emilia?
- "How Emilia."

999
01:35:09,914 --> 01:35:12,052
That display five minutes ago, upstairs.

1000
01:35:12,313 --> 01:35:15,346
Curtsy, embrace, applause.
It wasn't for her, it was for you.

1001
01:35:15,417 --> 01:35:20,306
You were using Emilia so that everybody in
the room would say, "Isn't Emma wonderful?"

1002
01:35:20,378 --> 01:35:24,785
You are wonderful. You are really amazing.
It is incredible how you keep going on.

1003
01:35:24,857 --> 01:35:27,607
You're over the hill and you know it.
You're terrified.

1004
01:35:27,673 --> 01:35:31,764
All you've got are your scrapbooks,
your old toe shoes and those ridiculous dogs.

1005
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:33,840
What are you going to fill in with, Emma?

1006
01:35:33,913 --> 01:35:38,801
Not my daughter. You keep
your goddamn hands off my daughter.

1007
01:35:38,873 --> 01:35:42,004
- I'm better for Emilia then you are.
- The hell you are.

1008
01:35:42,073 --> 01:35:47,026
She came to me 'cause her mother wasn't
there. She was busy screwing her head off.

1009
01:35:47,097 --> 01:35:48,952
You bitch.

1010
01:36:18,296 --> 01:36:23,762
You know, if there'd been a photographer
here, you'd have had a whole new career.

1011
01:36:23,832 --> 01:36:26,832
I must look awful.

1012
01:36:26,904 --> 01:36:30,319
No, you don't. You look beautiful.

1013
01:36:30,392 --> 01:36:33,043
I don't know how you do it.

1014
01:36:35,448 --> 01:36:37,936
Give me your comb, I'll show you.

1015
01:36:38,008 --> 01:36:40,855
I'll take this half. Thank you.

1016
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:46,446
I lost an earring.

1017
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,454
I'm sorry.

1018
01:36:51,383 --> 01:36:53,750
- I'm not.
- You're not?

1019
01:36:53,815 --> 01:36:56,815
No. I'm not.

1020
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:02,478
Boy, thatjealousy.

1021
01:37:02,551 --> 01:37:05,006
Its poison, you know?

1022
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:09,585
- It can make you a monster.
- It does make one unfair.

1023
01:37:09,655 --> 01:37:12,590
You got off some bull's-eyes.

1024
01:37:12,663 --> 01:37:14,932
So did you.

1025
01:37:18,807 --> 01:37:20,749
Deedee...

1026
01:37:20,823 --> 01:37:25,842
I don't really remember
what I said about having the baby.

1027
01:37:28,439 --> 01:37:30,708
But I do know...

1028
01:37:35,798 --> 01:37:40,817
I would have said anything
to make sure I got that ballet.

1029
01:37:42,582 --> 01:37:45,430
I just had to have it.

1030
01:37:46,487 --> 01:37:49,782
You were good. Good enough to threaten me.

1031
01:37:59,062 --> 01:38:01,070
Jesus...

1032
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:07,919
Emma, you don't know...

1033
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:15,376
how many years
I wanted to hear you say... just that.

1034
01:38:27,766 --> 01:38:31,595
Next bus to midtown Manhattan
in 30 minutes.

1035
01:38:35,094 --> 01:38:39,316
Emma had her all morning, coaching her.
Dahkarova's got her this afternoon.

1036
01:38:39,382 --> 01:38:42,415
- What's all the coaching for?
- OK, surprise.

1037
01:38:42,486 --> 01:38:45,585
Your daughter is dancing with Yuri
on the 15th.

1038
01:38:45,654 --> 01:38:47,726
- He'll wipe her out.
- The hell he will.

1039
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:50,732
Emma and Dahkarova
have knocked themselves out.

1040
01:38:50,837 --> 01:38:54,481
- Ethan, show Janina her room, please.
- Sure.

1041
01:38:54,549 --> 01:38:57,397
You're going to love it here...

1042
01:39:00,533 --> 01:39:03,631
You wanna see something wonderful? Come.

1043
01:39:05,013 --> 01:39:07,861
Left, right, left, right.

1044
01:39:07,925 --> 01:39:08,940
OK?

1045
01:39:09,013 --> 01:39:10,988
Now, left shoulder. And...

1046
01:39:11,061 --> 01:39:14,061
Left, right. No...

1047
01:39:15,861 --> 01:39:20,433
So remember, it's left, right, left, right.

1048
01:39:20,533 --> 01:39:25,901
You must do it so that really you shine.
Like diamond, you know?

1049
01:39:26,004 --> 01:39:27,597
OK. And...

1050
01:39:27,668 --> 01:39:29,010
One. One. One.

1051
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:32,425
More close. Close.
That's right, that's right, that's right.

1052
01:39:32,501 --> 01:39:37,389
More this way, this,
instead of this and this, OK?

1053
01:39:38,517 --> 01:39:41,484
Just very sharp. One.
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

1054
01:39:41,556 --> 01:39:45,418
That's very good. That's good.
No, it is good.

1055
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:49,999
You think she can make it, Wayne?

1056
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:52,752
Will you care if she doesn't?

1057
01:39:53,877 --> 01:39:55,819
No.

1058
01:39:55,892 --> 01:39:58,543
As long as she doesn't.

1059
01:39:59,893 --> 01:40:02,445
Still care you didn't?

1060
01:40:17,652 --> 01:40:21,678
Emma said I married you
'cause I knew I couldn't.

1061
01:40:21,748 --> 01:40:23,984
That's not true.

1062
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:26,702
She said something else.

1063
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:33,391
She said I got pregnant
that first time with Emilia...

1064
01:40:34,804 --> 01:40:38,349
because I wanted to prove to everybody...

1065
01:40:39,507 --> 01:40:41,394
that you weren't gay.

1066
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:43,498
And that's partly true.

1067
01:40:45,075 --> 01:40:47,082
I knew that.

1068
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:50,863
You did?

1069
01:40:50,931 --> 01:40:53,614
I had to prove it too.

1070
01:40:54,771 --> 01:40:57,520
So I let you ruin your career.

1071
01:40:58,515 --> 01:41:01,581
No, I saddled you with a family.
You could have been something...

1072
01:41:01,651 --> 01:41:04,498
Me? No, no, no, never. Not me.

1073
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:12,655
Hey, I got what I wanted.

1074
01:41:23,922 --> 01:41:26,442
So did I.

1075
01:41:59,922 --> 01:42:04,494
- Why you don't ask me?
- Adelaide hates to pay overtime.

1076
01:42:05,713 --> 01:42:09,707
How you supposed to rehearse
without partner?

1077
01:42:11,026 --> 01:42:14,441
You make too much from Carolyn and me.

1078
01:42:15,665 --> 01:42:18,349
But I apologize anyway.

1079
01:42:19,378 --> 01:42:21,614
Keep doing. Come, come, come on.

1080
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,708
So...

1081
01:42:29,777 --> 01:42:32,777
- Can we have supper?
- I'm busy.

1082
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,632
- After supper?
- Bed.

1083
01:42:39,729 --> 01:42:41,933
OK.

1084
01:42:42,033 --> 01:42:43,855
Emilia...

1085
01:42:43,921 --> 01:42:45,547
Is joke.

1086
01:42:45,617 --> 01:42:48,486
I don't think so.

1087
01:42:48,561 --> 01:42:50,732
Come on. And...

1088
01:43:04,368 --> 01:43:06,507
That's no joke.

1089
01:43:07,537 --> 01:43:09,708
Nice?

1090
01:43:09,776 --> 01:43:10,987
Yes.

1091
01:43:11,057 --> 01:43:13,478
So smile.

1092
01:43:14,576 --> 01:43:17,064
Let's go on.

1093
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,874
Bravo.

1094
01:48:57,098 --> 01:49:03,011
Emilia, it was marvelous. It was so
wonderful. You... Wasn't she wonderful?

1095
01:49:13,353 --> 01:49:16,004
Up these stairs and to the left.

1096
01:49:17,706 --> 01:49:21,317
Just one more kiss.
Just one more kiss.

1097
01:49:21,385 --> 01:49:23,774
It was so good. Now it's all done.

1098
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:27,014
Emilia. You were so good.

1099
01:49:27,082 --> 01:49:30,082
- You were so good.
- I just loved you.

1100
01:49:31,305 --> 01:49:36,870
And there he is. There's Yuri.
Yuri, this is my sister Janina.

1101
01:49:49,641 --> 01:49:53,667
You got it? You're kidding me.
You got his autograph?

1102
01:50:00,905 --> 01:50:03,905
You were absolutely wonderful, dearie.

1103
01:50:31,849 --> 01:50:35,678
You were incredible.
That was beautiful...

1104
01:50:59,368 --> 01:51:01,310
Pick a feeling.

1105
01:51:02,376 --> 01:51:04,100
Envy.

1106
01:51:04,359 --> 01:51:07,010
Her life is just beginning.

1107
01:51:10,023 --> 01:51:12,893
It's not a very long one, Deedee.

1108
01:51:12,968 --> 01:51:14,942
I know.

1109
01:51:16,999 --> 01:51:19,814
Well, as long as it gives her what she wants.

1110
01:51:19,912 --> 01:51:21,887
It will.

1111
01:51:23,911 --> 01:51:25,886
It will.

1112
01:51:27,047 --> 01:51:28,738
Oh, Emma.

1113
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:32,385
If only she knew everything we know.

1114
01:51:32,455 --> 01:51:35,106
It wouldn't matter a damn.
