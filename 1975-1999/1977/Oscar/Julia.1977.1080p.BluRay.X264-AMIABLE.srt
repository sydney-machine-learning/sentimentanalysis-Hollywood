1
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,171
Old paint on canvas, as it ages,

2
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,336
sometimes becomes transparent.

3
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,348
When that happens,
it is possible in some pictures...

4
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,009
to see the original lines.

5
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,269
A tree will show
through a woman's dress.

6
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,562
A child makes way for a dog.

7
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,477
A boat is no longer on an open sea.

8
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,992
That is called pentimento,

9
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:56,532
because the painter repented,
changed his mind.

10
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,816
I'm old now, and I want to remember...

11
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:40,235
what was there for me once
and what is there for me now.

12
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,121
It's not working again, Dash.

13
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,577
It's falling apart again.

14
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,038
Put on your sweater.
Bring some whiskey.

15
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,588
I'll build a fire,
and we'll start dinner.

16
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,013
Don't forget the smokes.

17
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,931
I'm not here to take orders!
I want advice.

18
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,840
You're a big-shot writer.

19
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,524
You're not a general, Hammett,
and I ain't the troops!

20
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,203
If you really can't write,
maybe you should go find a job.

21
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,214
Be a waitress.

22
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,547
What about a fireman, huh?
You could be chief.

23
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,129
It's not a bad idea, you know?
Little town somewhere‒

24
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,256
find yourself a little fire station,
a hat.

25
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,349
- I'll be the mayor.
- Why should you be the mayor?

26
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,351
Well, someone has
to appoint you if-

27
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,143
I'm in trouble with my goddamn play,
and you don't care!

28
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,233
Just because you stopped writing
doesn't--

29
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,682
Tell you what, Lilly.
I'll send you on a trip to Paris.

30
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,800
I don't wanna go to Paris.

31
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,392
Why not? I hear it's a swell town.

32
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,386
Finish the play there. Have a little fun.
Visit your friend Julia.

33
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,770
You know damn well
Julia's not in Paris.

34
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,566
Well, wherever she is.

35
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,815
Go to Spain. There may be a civil war
in Spain. You'd help somebody win it.

36
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:07,034
- You're scrappy.
- I'm not scrappy. Don't call me scrappy.

37
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,866
You make me sound like
a neighborhood bulldog.

38
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,991
You are the neighborhood
bulldog, Lilly!

39
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,289
'Cept you got some cockeyed dream
about bein' a cocker spaniel.

40
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,672
I can't work here.

41
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,422
Then don't work here.
Don't work anyplace.

42
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,554
It's not as if you've written
anything before, you know.

43
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,302
Nobody'll miss you.
It's a perfect time to change jobs.

44
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,848
You're the one who talked me
into being a writer, Dashiell.

45
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,810
You're the one who said,
"Stick with it, kid. You got talent, kid!"

46
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,435
You soft-soaped me
with all that crap!

47
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,765
And now look at me.

48
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,278
If you're gonna cry about it,
go stand on a rock.

49
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,201
Don't do it around me.

50
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,869
If you can't write here,
go someplace else.

51
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,661
Give it up. Open a drugstore.

52
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,828
Be a coal miner.

53
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,041
Only just don't cry about it!

54
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,718
I think I have
always known about my memory.

55
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,141
I know when the truth
is distorted by some drama or fantasy.

56
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:23,534
But I trust absolutely
what I remember about Julia.

57
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,524
Happy New Year,
Grandmother.

58
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,317
Happy New Year, Julia.

59
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,489
- Happy New Year, Grandfather.
- Hmm?

60
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,246
Why did we have sherbet
in the middle of the meal?

61
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,383
It clears the palate
between the fish and the meat.

62
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,216
- Who's that?
- It's my mother.

63
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,095
- My God.
- She just got married again.

64
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,929
- Where does your mother live?
- In Scotland.

65
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,765
- My mother owns a very fancy castle.
- Have you been there?

66
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,021
- Once.
- What's it like?

67
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,734
Full of fancy people
with fancy titles.

68
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,185
- Who were they?
- I don't remember. They didn't interest me.

69
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,277
They're all very rich
and famous.

70
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,782
They just said hello to me,
and I don't remember.

71
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,283
- Happy New Year, Julia.
- Happy New Year.

72
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,947
I am... Paris.

73
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,001
I am Paris,
and I am a string of beads.

74
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,633
I am Paris, and
I am a string of beads on a hot dancer.

75
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,219
I am Paris, and
I am a string of beads on a hot dancer,

76
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,723
and a romantic Frenchman
comes into my room.

77
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,385
And he carries me off
into the dark, Parisian night.

78
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,306
And takes me to his villa.

79
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,818
What happened?

80
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,990
- Oh, I'm in ecstasy!
- What happened?

81
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,743
You'll have to learn French.

82
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,245
I am Paris.

83
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,754
I am Paris,
and I am a string of beads.

84
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,013
No, wait a minute. No.

85
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:22,513
I am Paris, and I am a string of beads
on a hot dancer.

86
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,848
I am Paris. I am a string of beads
on a hot dancer,

87
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,694
and outside it is Renoir and Degas.

88
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,732
I am Paris, and I am a string of beads
on a hot dancer,

89
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,898
- and outside it is‒
- Renoir.

90
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,607
Renoir and Degas,

91
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,118
and inside it is hard and hot.

92
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,370
I don't care.

93
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,166
I don't care.

94
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,223
- Happy New Year, Julia.
- Happy New Year, Lilly.

95
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,181
I cannot say now
that I had ever used the words...

96
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,805
gentle or strong...

97
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,227
or delicate.

98
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,978
But I did think that night...

99
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,941
that it was the most beautiful face
I had ever seen.

100
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,274
Maybe I could do better work
someplace else.

101
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,824
Dash?

102
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,106
If I were to go to Paris
and work‒

103
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,159
Are you awake?

104
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,157
Dash, do I keep you
from writing?

105
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,748
No. Sleeping, Lilly.
You keep me from sleeping.

106
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,059
But what about Paris? What about Rome?

107
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,469
- You aren't listening!
- I am listening!

108
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,561
Please tell me what's the matter.

109
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,186
I don't want to be here,
not with them.

110
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,193
- I hate them.
- Why?

111
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,156
They took me to see Cairo.

112
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,504
They told me how beautiful
Cairo would be, but it wasn't.

113
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,999
I said to my grandfather,
"Look at those people. They're hungry.

114
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,495
They're sick.
Why don't we do something?"

115
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,628
And he said,
"Don't look at them."

116
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,755
I said, "But they're sick."

117
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,432
He said, "I didn't make them sick."

118
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,639
What about Paris?
What about Rome?

119
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,223
- You aren't listening!
- I am listening!

120
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,356
Where my mother lives,
the servants live under the ground‒

121
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,399
Eighteen people in three rooms,
no windows, one bathroom.

122
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:50,322
It's wrong. It's wrong, Lilly.
Do you understand?

123
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,793
I heard from Oxford,
from medical school.

124
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,963
- I was accepted!
- When will you go?

125
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,713
At the end of the summer!

126
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,586
- All ashore that's going ashore.
- You'd better go.

127
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,025
When are we gonna see
each other again?

128
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,113
It'll be so long.

129
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,407
Think of it this way-- When we do,
we'll have everything to talk about.

130
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,495
- All ashore that's going ashore!
- Please write me.

131
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,252
You know I will.

132
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,511
Work hard.
Take chances.

133
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,719
Be very bold. Do you hear me?

134
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,465
- All ashore that's going ashore!
- Good-bye.

135
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,179
Good-bye.

136
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,187
I wasn't to see her again
for a very long time,

137
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,560
until I went to visit her at Oxford.

138
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,620
There are women who reach
a perfect time of life...

139
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,370
when the face
will never again be as good,

140
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,084
the body never as graceful
or powerful.

141
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,586
It had happened that year to Julia.

142
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,014
- Do you have lots of friends?
- Not many.

143
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,393
- Do you get to the theater?
- No, there isn't time.

144
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,057
But we always went to the theater.

145
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,476
When you write your play,
then I'll go again.

146
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,476
- How is your writing?
- Oh, I'm still at the publishing house.

147
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,067
I wish I could write full-time.

148
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,073
- Do you have a beau?
- No. Do you?

149
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,907
Well, I think
maybe I found somebody.

150
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,123
- And you?
- I did, but it didn't work out.

151
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,165
- What are you reading now?
- Darwin, Engels,

152
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,919
Hegel, Einstein.

153
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,513
- Do you understand Einstein?
- Sure.

154
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,856
- Will you come home next summer?
- No, I'm going to Vienna.

155
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,815
I'll finish my medical studies there,

156
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,280
and then I'll apply to study
with Professor Freud.

157
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,788
Can you do that? I mean,
I know you can do that,

158
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,120
- but Jesus.
- I think so. There's a chance.

159
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,206
I think he will accept me.
Lilly, you have to come to Vienna.

160
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,881
Then you'll know
what to write about.

161
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,422
People are coming alive there‒

162
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,965
working people
who've never had a chance before.

163
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,799
They've built their own part of the city
in Floridsdorf.

164
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,885
They've got their own orchestra.
The newspaper's the best in Vienna.

165
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,813
Lilly, finally there's
some real hope in the world.

166
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,689
Do you understand?

167
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,312
Yes, of course.

168
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,572
But I didn't understand.

169
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,988
Not fully. Who of us did?

170
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,449
She wrote me from time to time.

171
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,911
She went on to study medicine
at the university in Vienna.

172
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:31,085
And as the years went on, she wrote
angrily of the threat of fascism...

173
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,260
and of the Nazis,
of Mussolini and Adolf Hitler...

174
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,219
and of the holocaust
that was on the way.

175
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,431
She couldn't understand why the world
refused to see what was coming.

176
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,232
I decided to accept Hammett's offer...

177
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,571
to see if I could do better work
away from home.

178
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,073
I went back to Europe, to Paris.

179
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,459
Julia? It's Lillian!

180
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,184
Is that you?
It doesn't sound like you.

181
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,641
I can't believe it. It's been so long.

182
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,768
Didn't you get my messages?
I've been trying to get you for weeks.

183
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,901
I'm fine. I'm in Paris.

184
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,479
When can I see you?

185
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,571
I'm finishing my play.
Didn't you get my letter?

186
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,160
Are you okay?

187
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,663
What's difficult?

188
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,252
H-Hello?

189
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,960
Well, I'll‒
I'll come to Vienna.

190
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,167
Why not?

191
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,501
Well, how‒
Well, how about halfway?

192
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,088
I'll meet you halfway.

193
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,469
Yes. Hotel Jacob.
I won't leave until I hear from you.

194
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,560
Are you all right?

195
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Hello?

196
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,275
Dear Dash,
I try to concentrate on my play,

197
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,197
but I‒ I feel sick.

198
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,829
There's no reason for my nausea
other than fright.

199
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,037
There's something
very evil here, Dash.

200
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,626
Something frightening and evil,
and I think it will affect all our lives.

201
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,220
- And it's not only in Paris.
- Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

202
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,261
What's gonna happen to Julia?

203
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,005
She's still studying in Vienna.

204
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:21,711
Ein, zwei, drei!

205
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,391
No! They've got our friend!

206
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,853
No! Look at that!

207
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,438
Get out! Get out!

208
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,280
You‒ You bastards!

209
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,953
Get out!

210
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,664
Julia.

211
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,575
Telephone.

212
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,873
Mademoiselle, telephone!

213
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,168
They call from Vienna!

214
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,292
What happened?

215
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,795
Oh, my God! How serious is it?

216
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,967
Of course I'm coming! Please, tell her--
Tell her I'm coming!

217
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,388
Yes, where do I go?

218
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,598
Fräulein.

219
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,109
Your Freundin.

220
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,888
What?

221
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,061
Ja?

222
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,280
Fräulein!

223
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,490
Hotel Imperial.

224
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,741
A reservation at the Hotel Imperial?

225
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,325
- Ja.
- Thank you.

226
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,508
So good to have you
with us, Fräulein.

227
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,636
- Who made the reservation?
- Oh, yes, uh,

228
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,311
Herr Von Fritsch, Fräulein Hellman.

229
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,520
He wants me to tell you
that everything is arranged,

230
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,312
- and you will be comfortable and well.
- Is, uh,

231
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,476
- Herr Von Fritsch in this hotel?
- No, Fräulein. He's not.

232
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,776
Well, how can I reach
this Mr. Herr Von Fritsch?

233
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,111
I do not know, Fräulein.
He came and went very quickly.

234
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,383
She's resting from the operation.

235
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,968
- Will you come tomorrow, please?
- What operation?

236
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,643
- Excuse me. What operation?
- She's resting.

237
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,061
- I don't understand what you mean.
- Come tomorrow, please.

238
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,680
- What operation?
- Come back tomorrow.

239
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,898
No, I will not come back tomorrow!
I will wait right here!

240
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,803
Fräulein.

241
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,733
I-I don't know
what you mean.

242
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,199
I don't know
what you mean.

243
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,496
- Where is she?
- Treatment.

244
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,705
- What's happened?
- Treatment.

245
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,266
Psst. Fräulein!

246
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,361
Danke.

247
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,196
Go back to Paris fast.

248
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,369
Leave your address at the hotel.

249
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,038
They will take me now
to another place. Love, Julia.

250
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,971
I stayed in Europe
for months trying to find her,

251
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,757
waiting for some word from her.

252
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,386
But there was no sign.

253
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,142
Please speak more slowly!
I cannot understand you!

254
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,396
Wa‒ Wait.
Attendez un instant.

255
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,440
- Do you speak German? Parlez Deutsch?
- Ah, no.

256
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,775
Excuse me, madam,
but I speak German.

257
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,333
- They say she was never there, madam.
- They have to have her name!

258
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,713
Tell them I saw her.
I was there.

259
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,256
Einen moment.

260
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,931
No, madam.
She was never in that hospital.

261
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,760
But I saw her!
They have to know where she went.

262
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,216
Madame, they do not
even know the name.

263
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:08,273
I gave up trying
to write the play and went back home.

264
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,652
Not long after that,
I received a letter...

265
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,703
postmarked "Vienna. "

266
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,867
I could write her
in care of a post office box in London.

267
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,332
She said not to worry
and that one day...

268
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,583
she knew we would
see each other again.

269
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,383
I tried to finish my play.

270
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,795
It's gonna snow, Dash.

271
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,587
Dash?

272
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,150
Mmm.

273
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,350
You wanted to be a serious writer.

274
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,930
That's what I liked.
That's what we worked for.

275
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,234
I don't know what happened,
but you'd better tear that up.

276
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,323
Not that it's bad.
It's just not good enough.

277
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,902
Not for you.

278
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,932
It's the best play anyone's written
in a long time.

279
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,851
Are you sure?

280
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,442
I'm positive.

281
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,617
But are you sure?

282
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,361
Bravo!

283
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,655
Congratulations, Miss Hellman.

284
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:49,918
Bravo! Bravo!

285
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,509
Lillian, it was beautiful.

286
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:02,194
This is Max.
I made him come down and see it.

287
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,983
Bravo! Bravo!

288
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,949
- That was a play to be proud of.
- Wonderful.

289
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,660
Dash?

290
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,461
I hope I woke you up
from a sound sleep.

291
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,923
Wanna hear the good news?

292
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,499
They think I'm wonderful.

293
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,011
I'm the toast of the town.

294
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,474
Everybody came.

295
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,137
You had to go to Hollywood.

296
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,889
Of course I'm drunk.

297
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,894
Been drunk for two days.

298
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,768
How the hell do you think
I got through this night?

299
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,650
Who's in bed with you, Dash?

300
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,648
No,
I won't send you the reviews!

301
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,320
Ye‒ But-- Dash.

302
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:01,204
The second act was fine!
You were right about everything.

303
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,867
But you know that.

304
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,539
When are you coming home?

305
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,876
Dear Julia, I sent you
a copy of my play. Did you ever get it?

306
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,505
It opened on Broadway,
just as we always pretended it would.

307
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,511
They liked it.

308
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,139
I only wish you'd been there.

309
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,603
Maybe I wouldn't
have had to get so drunk.

310
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,851
I haven't heard from you
in such a long time.

311
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,414
Royalties, Hammett!

312
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,044
More royalties!

313
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,166
- I could buy a sable coat.
- If that's what you want.

314
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,840
I have a right
to have a sable coat.

315
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,555
Maybe I ought to give
my money to Roosevelt.

316
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,430
You could do that too.

317
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:11,476
I'd look swell in a sable coat.

318
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,155
- Dash?
- Hmm?

319
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,115
I like being famous.

320
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,421
You know what happens
when I go shopping for groceries now?

321
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,831
I'm famous.

322
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,167
I buy mayonnaise,
and I'm famous.

323
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,764
I get letters
from people in Idaho.

324
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,511
I don't even know
where Idaho is.

325
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,562
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm listening to you, Lilly.

326
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:56,361
Dash, I don't want you to think
I just care about sable coats.

327
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,703
I know that, Lilly.

328
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:08,253
You've been famous a long time,
Dash, and it never seems to bother you.

329
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,747
Ohh! Aargh!

330
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,836
This is a dopey conversation!

331
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,472
It's only fame, Lilly.

332
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,592
Just a paint job.

333
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,967
If you want a sable coat,
buy one.

334
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:29,063
Just remember, it doesn't
have anything to do with writing.

335
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,313
It's only a sable coat and doesn't
have anything to do with writing.

336
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,152
Well, you'll never find anybody
who fishes better than I do.

337
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,485
No. Never. Not as long as I live.

338
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,789
Why won't you come to Russia
with me, Dash?

339
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,794
I don't wanna go to Russia.

340
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,959
Why not? Don't you wanna see
the Russian theater?

341
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,425
I don't give a damn
about the Russian theater.

342
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:07,007
Oh, come on.
Come with me to Russia, Dash.

343
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,886
We could stay in Paris
for a while first.

344
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,307
See the Eiffel Tower.

345
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,349
Come on.

346
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,617
Now you've been invited
to Moscow?

347
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,503
What is that?
Some sort of political thing?

348
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,418
Not exactly. No, Anne Marie, it's, uh‒

349
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,750
It's only a theater festival.

350
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,796
Oh, did you know
about the McPhee boy, the little one?

351
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:45,131
He was killed in Spain. Imagine
having your brother die a Communist.

352
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,759
I'm sorry he lost his life, but I wonder
why they rush over there.

353
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:53,638
By the way, I tried to see Julia
in Vienna, but she wouldn't see me.

354
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,057
She's leading a strange life,
pretending not to be rich,

355
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,146
doing something called
anti‒ uh, antifascist work.

356
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,068
Didn't she drop out
of medical school?

357
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,401
- Yes.
- Do you ever hear from her?

358
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,083
Well, I'm glad you had time to see me.

359
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,291
You look so very slim, Lillian.

360
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,287
Thank you, Anne Marie.

361
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,535
Imagine, Russia.
My God, of all places.

362
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,152
Where is he now?
He keeps moving.

363
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,737
By the post.

364
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,695
He just stands there!
He doesn't wave.

365
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,504
Let him stand there if he wants to.
We're goin' to Paris, Lilly!

366
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,537
Where's the wine steward?

367
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,968
- He's waving. Look.
- By God! He's tilting his hat!

368
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,152
Does Julia live there,
or doesn't she?

369
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,912
Well, would you
give her a message?

370
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,909
Message! Oh!

371
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,327
Does anybody there
speak better English?

372
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,503
Sprechen better English?

373
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,424
No. No. I want somebody
better than you!

374
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,671
All right. Yes. All right.
Would you please tell her Lillian‒

375
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:49,012
Lillian is in Paris at the Hotel Meurice.

376
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,472
- I'll be here for two weeks.
- Lillian!

377
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,973
Then I'm going to‒ Just a second, Alan!

378
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:59,057
I'm going to Moscow,
and I can come to Vienna to see her.

379
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,194
Hello.

380
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:05,781
Hello! Oh, uh‒ Just a‒

381
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,779
Alan, just a minute!

382
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,651
God, why don't you break
the damn door down?

383
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,908
It's 20 after 8:00, and we're due
at the Murphys' for cocktails at 8:30.

384
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,991
- Oy vey.
- Hold on. You missed a button. Here.

385
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,787
- Alan.
- Well, now, who were you talking to?

386
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,962
- Dottie, would you button up this damn thing?
- Sure, darling.

387
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,211
We'll be half an hour late. Supposed to
have supper at the Rothschilds'.

388
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,344
Would you tell him to settle down,
for God's sake?

389
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,091
He's afraid
we're gonna miss Hemingway.

390
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,883
- Who were you talking to on the phone?
- Hemingway? Hemingway?

391
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,968
Yeah, he's coming up
from Spain.

392
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,313
Say, you have an invitation
to Louise de Vilmorin's.

393
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,640
Dottie, did we get an invitation
to Louise de Vilmorin's?

394
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,596
Would you tell him to get
out of my things, Dottie?

395
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,187
Get out of her things, Alan.

396
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,311
Hemingway, huh?

397
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,268
Yes. Hemingway and Cocteau
in his red necktie...

398
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,319
- and the crème de la crème.
- Way down deep, he's very superficial.

399
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,617
Oh.

400
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,602
Oh, my. I forgot to
turn in my key again.

401
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,693
- Will you never stop doing that?
- I always forget.

402
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,730
- You go up.
- Huh?

403
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,323
You go ahead. I'm gonna see
if there's any messages.

404
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,355
Bonsoir. Or bonjour.

405
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,369
- Good morning, madame.
- Hellman, deux vingt-huit.

406
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,082
Merci... beaucoup.

407
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,373
Don't overdo it, darling.

408
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,787
Bonjour, garçon.

409
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,800
- Oh, merci.
- You are welcome, madame.

410
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,508
- Madame Hellman?
- Yes?

411
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,771
I've come to talk to you
about the tickets...

412
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,059
and your travel plans.

413
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,645
What?

414
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,478
Miss Julia
has asked me to see you.

415
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,031
I have your travel folders.

416
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,066
What-- What's the trouble?
Has something happened to Julia?

417
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,275
Do you think I could have
an egg, a hot milk and a roll?

418
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,289
I could not pay for it, however.

419
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,334
Um, yes.

420
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,587
Uh, hello.

421
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:21,096
Yes. We'd like just some breakfast, please.

422
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,259
Thank you.

423
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,892
Thank you very much.

424
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,827
This is my friend, Johann.

425
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:47,749
He will tell you what I need,
but I tell you, don't push yourself.

426
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,211
If you can't, you can't. No dishonor.

427
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,793
Love, Julia.

428
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,985
Oh, I'm sorry.

429
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,240
I'm sorry I could not
pay for myself.

430
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,951
But someday perhaps.

431
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,748
Yes. Perhaps. I'm sure.
Someday.

432
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,959
Thank you for
the fine breakfast.

433
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,547
Could we walk in
the Tuileries now?

434
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,014
Yes. Waiter.

435
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:09,116
I cannot take long. Time is
too short, and there is much to do.

436
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,794
So if I'm not cordial,
you will understand.

437
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,873
Yes. Of course.

438
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,539
You're very cordial.
I think you're very cordial.

439
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,708
You're going to Moscow
by way of Vienna.

440
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,258
- Yes.
- We would like to change your travel plans.

441
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,353
We would like you to travel
by way of Berlin.

442
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,599
Why?

443
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,598
You would have to leave
immediately.

444
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,774
You would need
a German visa.

445
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:36,942
You would stay a short time in Berlin
and then change trains there to Moscow.

446
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,359
I'm sorry,
but you're not being clear.

447
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,622
We would like you to
carry for us $50,000.

448
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,991
We think you're safe,

449
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,118
but we cannot assure you
of this.

450
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:57,751
The money is Julia's money. With it,
we can bribe out already many in prison...

451
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,746
and many who soon will be.

452
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:14,096
I better explain. We are small group
who work against Hitler.

453
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,312
We are of no common belief
or religion.

454
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,978
The people who you will meet
for the money,

455
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,897
if your consent is given,
were some small publishers.

456
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,317
We are Catholic, Communist--
many beliefs.

457
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,576
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes. Yes.

458
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,909
We realize you are not
the best person...

459
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,615
for this kind of mission
because you're Jewish.

460
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,706
But unfortunately,
there's no one else we can ask.

461
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,545
Julia said I must
remind you for her...

462
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,720
that you're afraid
of being afraid,

463
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,049
and so you will do
what sometimes you cannot do.

464
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,926
That could be dangerous
to you‒ and to us.

465
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,894
So, p-please,
try not to be heroic.

466
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,151
I assure you,
I would never try to be heroic.

467
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,861
Please,
could we get a drink?

468
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,692
No. I'm sorry. Sorry.
The time is too short.

469
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,735
So, will you help us?

470
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,369
I, uh‒

471
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,706
I need a few hours... to think it through.
I need to think it through.

472
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,839
It is best not to be too prepared
for matters of this kind.

473
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,013
Yes, I know that, but I‒ I need
to think it over for a while.

474
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,053
Julia would want it that way.

475
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:34,216
There is a train
at 6:30 this evening...

476
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,017
to Berlin
from the Gare du Nord.

477
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:41,442
I will be there.
Gate number 5.

478
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,573
If you agree to carry
the money for us,

479
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,941
you will s-say hello to me.

480
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,358
If you decide
it's not right for you‒

481
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,581
No, I haven't decided that.
I just need‒

482
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,251
I need time to think it over.

483
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,620
- If you decide it is not right for you,
- For a while.

484
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,747
Then pass me by.

485
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,245
Otherwise, you will
simply say hello,

486
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,587
and then I will tell you
what is necessary.

487
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,263
Hello? I just say hello?

488
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,892
Yes. Just hello.

489
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,010
Where will you be?

490
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,097
Don't worry.
I will find you.

491
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,232
But please, madame,

492
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,270
if you cannot do it,
do not do it.

493
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,225
Please stop saying that.

494
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,861
Thank you... for the tour.

495
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,485
Thank you for
the wonderful morning.

496
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:24,416
Lilly, you don't have to
come this way. Go down under.

497
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,668
Wade across.

498
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,905
Lilly, you don't have to
come this way.

499
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,794
Go down under. Wade across.

500
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,038
Just hold tight.

501
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,296
Pull yourself.

502
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,511
I can't.

503
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,849
Easy.

504
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,091
I'm sorry.

505
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,710
It's all right.
You'll do it next time.

506
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,715
Why'd you change your plans?

507
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,846
It was just an impulse. I‒ I thought
it would be pleasant to see Berlin.

508
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,694
I thought I'd be able to stay
more than a few hours.

509
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,271
You are going to Moscow.

510
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:55,146
So regulations permit only
that you will have a transit visa.

511
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,744
Why is that?

512
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:09,583
There you are.

513
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,496
- Your train tickets, madame.
- Thank you very much.

514
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,835
- And where is my trunk?
- It's on the way to the station, madame.

515
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,922
It will be put on the train.

516
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,344
- Did the Campbells get my message?
- Yes, madame.

517
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,678
- Thank you very much. Here.
- Thank you very much.

518
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,854
Have a good trip,
Madame Hellman.

519
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:27,973
Thank you.

520
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,194
Yes, yes.
Here, here.

521
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,578
Do you think
you can be invisible?

522
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,912
What does this mean, you're leaving us,
you'll find us again after Moscow?

523
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,248
- I'm in a hurry. I can't explain.
- Lilly, what's wrong?

524
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,464
Nothing's wrong. I've changed my plans. I've
had enough partying, and I'm gonna leave.

525
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,456
- It's not like you to be so mysterious.
- I'm late. I gotta go.

526
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,129
- Well, we'll see you to the station.
- No, Alan! No!

527
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,548
I don't need you.
I'll call you from Moscow.

528
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,597
Alan, why are you
doing this?

529
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,811
Because our friend Lilly's gone berserk.
What am I supposed to do?

530
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,861
Alan, please.

531
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,070
- What gate?
- It's Gate 5.

532
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,238
Where's your ticket?
Let me have your ticket.

533
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,156
- You don't need to come in with me.
- Let me have your ticket.

534
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,406
Oh, God. I'm late already.
I'm gonna miss my train.

535
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,498
Attention. Attention.

536
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,424
Quai numéro 5.
Départ imminent...

537
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:41,593
du Nord-Express
à destination de Moscou via Berlin.

538
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:45,474
By way of Berlin?
Why are you going by way of Berlin?

539
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,683
I thought you wanted to go to Vienna
to see your friend Julia.

540
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,765
- I-I never heard from her.
- Darling‒

541
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,890
- Say good-bye to me here.
- Now, Lillian,

542
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,437
you know what they do to Jews
in Germany.

543
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,318
Say, isn't that the man I saw
you with in the Tuileries today?

544
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,574
Is he a friend of yours
or something?

545
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,117
Mr. Johann.
Mr. Johann.

546
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,913
No, please!
Don't go away.

547
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,964
I just wanted to say
hello to you, Mr. Johann. Hello.

548
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,955
These are friends of mine.

549
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,468
This gentleman says
he saw us today in the gardens.

550
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,510
Now he's gonna ask me who you are,
and he's gonna say he didn't know...

551
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,675
we knew each other so well that you would
come say good-bye to me here.

552
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,925
I wish I could say that
it was true, but, uh,

553
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,897
I came here to seek for my nephew
who is en route to Poland.

554
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,689
He's not in his coach.
He's late. This is his habit.

555
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,025
His name is Walter Franz.
Coach 4, second class.

556
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:48,701
Since I could not find him, I would be
most grateful if you could say to him I came.

557
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:52,333
- What-- What is his name?
- Walter Franz.

558
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,751
Coach 4, second class.

559
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,001
I'm most glad that I had
this chance to say hello to you.

560
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:01,924
Oh, yes indeed, Mr. Johann.
Hello to you. Hello, Mr. Johann.

561
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:07,379
What funny talk.
You're talking like a foreigner.

562
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:11,348
I'm sorry, Alan. I'm sorry I don't talk
as good as you do in Virginia.

563
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,430
I've gotta say good-bye.

564
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,525
La monnaie est là.

565
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,617
La monnaie est là.

566
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,870
Madame Hellman.

567
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,999
I am Walter Franz. Nephew.
Car 4, second class.

568
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:02,622
This is your birthday present
from Miss Julia.

569
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:41,510
Open this box, and wear the hat.

570
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:47,399
When you reach the border,
leave the candy box on the seat. Julia.

571
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,711
This is Compartment "F."

572
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,879
Do you not want "F"?

573
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:21,097
Yes, but I‒ I was‒
I'm going to the washroom.

574
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,766
Um‒

575
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,730
I guess I won't go to the washroom.

576
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,852
Excuse me.

577
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:48,083
Ja.

578
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,285
- May I turn off the light?
- Yes.

579
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,416
Thank you.

580
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:01,202
Nice coat.

581
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,700
Oh, yes. My coat is‒
is nice. Thank you.

582
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:07,373
Warm. What fur it is?

583
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,543
It's sealskin.

584
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,712
Yes. It's‒ It's warm.

585
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,040
Your hat is also fur?

586
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,673
I don't know.

587
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,798
I'll look.

588
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,060
- Yes.
- Ah.

589
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:32,351
Nice with coat.
You would put on?

590
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,317
You would put on.

591
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,742
Yes.

592
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,951
Yes, I will.

593
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,867
- Ah, yes. Nice.
- Nice. Very nice.

594
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,499
- It's pretty.
- Yes.

595
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:02,586
Thank you.
I think I'll keep it on.

596
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,425
Dîner, premier service.

597
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,642
Le dîner, premier service.

598
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,266
- Kommen sie mit?
- Danke. Nein.

599
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,403
I go to eat now.
You would like dinner?

600
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:19,111
But I‒ I don't know
when we cross the border.

601
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,571
Border? We do not stop
for the border until morning.

602
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,152
There is much time now.

603
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:28,493
Do not worry about your things.
I stay here.

604
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,865
I eat here. It's too much money
to pay for food on train.

605
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,473
I think the consommé
is the best.

606
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,016
Yes. Fine. Consommé.
Thank you.

607
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,148
You see, I must have
hot food for the lungs.

608
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,738
I study in Paris,
and I get ill, you see?

609
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,994
I am at the university.
I am not well.

610
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:17,456
I was at a concert one night,
and sudden I cannot breathe, you see?

611
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:19,831
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

612
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,048
J— Je malade.

613
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,492
Something wrong?

614
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,815
No. I‒

615
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,945
I'm just not hungry.

616
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,670
Like some tea?

617
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,086
No, thank you.

618
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:31,803
"Whenas in silks my Julia goes,

619
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:37,474
then, then methinks how sweetly
flows the liquefaction of her clothes.

620
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:41,057
Next, when I cast
mine eyes and see...

621
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:44,313
that brave vibration
each way free,

622
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:48,516
oh, how that glittering taketh me."

623
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:54,989
That's his tribute to me.

624
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,333
I love you, Julia.

625
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,774
Douane française.
Vous n'avez rien à déclarer?

626
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:34,526
It comes now, the border.
We'll be in Germany soon.

627
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,369
Douane française.
Vous n'avez rien à déclarer?

628
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,455
Non.

629
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,830
Passeport, s'il vous plaît.

630
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:51,959
Douane française.
Vous n'avez rien à déclarer?

631
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:58,264
Merci.

632
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:40,013
You need your coat and hat.
It is very windy.

633
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,861
You don't need the box.

634
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,030
You forgot your hat. It's cold.

635
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,362
Thank you.

636
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,982
If you have a temporary visa,
it could take more time than others.

637
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:13,731
It is nothing.
Do not worry.

638
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:14,814
Nächste.

639
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:24,701
Nächste.

640
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,759
- Rauchen verboten.
- No?

641
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,893
Das rauchen ist verboten.

642
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,386
Nächste.

643
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,885
- Danke schön.
- Nächste.

644
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,575
- Transit visa.
- Yes.

645
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,954
- Hellman.
- Yes.

646
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,253
You are traveling to Moscow.
Why have you stopped in Berlin?

647
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,094
Friends. To see friends.
And to see it.

648
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,255
I've never been in Berlin.

649
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,473
- Not business?
- Oh, no.

650
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,681
You cannot see much of Berlin
in a few hours.

651
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,102
What is your occupation?

652
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,438
I'm a writer.

653
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,613
- Oh, a writer.
- Yes.

654
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:44,652
- So you would write of Berlin?
- Oh, no. I wouldn't.

655
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,528
Perhaps your impressions
you would write.

656
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,698
My impressions.
Yes, I would write of my impressions.

657
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:07,218
All right.

658
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,972
Thank you very much.
Nächste.

659
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,577
Heil Hitler.

660
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:58,523
The customs‒ They take
a long time with the luggage.

661
01:20:58,603 --> 01:20:59,563
Hmm.

662
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,490
- What are you doing?
- Thank you. I would like a piece of chocolate.

663
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,872
Pl-Please don't do that.
I'm bringing it to a friend. It's a gift.

664
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,910
- Most kind.
- Heil Hitler.

665
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:29,134
Wollen sie Bonbon?

666
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:32,387
Nein danke.

667
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,989
Ist gut.

668
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,010
Ist gut.
Heil Hitler.

669
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:14,738
Berlin‒
Berlin, half an hour, madame.

670
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,910
Lillian. Lillian!

671
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:52,712
Lillian, how good it is
to see you.

672
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:56,756
But how naughty not to stay
for more than a few hours.

673
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:59,681
Give her the candy box.

674
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,851
I've brought a present for you.

675
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:20,107
When you get outside, look to your left.
You will see a restaurant called Albert's.

676
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,778
You will cross the street
and go into that restaurant.

677
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:24,907
Good luck. Enjoy yourself.

678
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:27,044
Pleasant to see you again.

679
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,991
Fine. Fine.

680
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:51,038
I've ordered caviar.
We'll celebrate.

681
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:54,542
Albert had to send out for it,
but he won't be long.

682
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,126
Oh, look at you.
Just look at you.

683
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,506
Tell me what to say to you.

684
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:04,130
It's all right. Everything's fine.
Nothing will happen now.

685
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,757
- How long do we have?
- Not long.

686
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,635
You still look like nobody else.

687
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:20,901
Why do you have crutches?

688
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:23,815
I've got a false leg.

689
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:31,373
- No tears, Lilly.
- I'm sorry.

690
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:34,254
- It's done. It's what it is.
- When?

691
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,832
You know when.
You were there in Vienna.

692
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:42,343
- No tears. There's no time.
- I'm sorry.

693
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:47,591
Your fingers are cold. Here.

694
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:52,354
They took the candy box--
a man and a woman.

695
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,352
That's right. Everything's fine.

696
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:00,108
Now, what I want you to do

697
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:03,691
is take off your hat as if
it were too hot in here.

698
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:06,858
Lilly, listen to me.
You're not listening.

699
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,619
I'm listening. I am.

700
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,452
Take off your hat, comb your hair,
and put the hat on the seat between us.

701
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,670
Do as I tell you.

702
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,457
Who were you with in Paris?
Good friends?

703
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:28,639
Yes. Good friends.
They don't know anything about this.

704
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,560
- Take out your comb.
- Oh, my comb.

705
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:37,061
Oh, I still carry too much.

706
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,645
There it is.
Take it out and use it.

707
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,939
You look so very well.

708
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:49,738
- I read your play.
- Did you like it? Children's Hour?

709
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,834
I'm proud of you.
It was wonderful.

710
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,160
- My second one failed.
- I know. I heard.

711
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:58,166
- So you're writing your third.
- I'm writing it.

712
01:28:58,249 --> 01:29:00,459
I'm going to the toilet.
You come with me.

713
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:05,713
If the waiter tries to come
and help me, you wave him away.

714
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:08,432
It's all right.
I can do it.

715
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,799
The leg doesn't fit properly.
I think it belongs to someone else.

716
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,428
- It has their initials on it.
- Oh, my God.

717
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:17,095
Act gay. Can you act gay?

718
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,306
Ooh.

719
01:29:20,396 --> 01:29:23,976
Albert, diese Dame
ist meine beste Freundin.

720
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,800
The German public toilets
are always so clean.

721
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:33,433
So much cleaner
than ours in America.

722
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:55,948
I want you to know that you've been
better than a good friend to me.

723
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:58,083
You've done
something important.

724
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:00,791
We can save 500 people.

725
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:01,872
Maybe‒

726
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,631
Maybe a thousand
if we can bargain right.

727
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:09,711
- Jews?
- About half are Jews.

728
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:10,837
Political people.

729
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:15,757
We can only do today
what we can do today.

730
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,717
And today
you did it for us.

731
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,228
Do you need
something stronger?

732
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:29,614
No.

733
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:32,242
Do you have a photograph
of Hammett?

734
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,660
Yes. I do.
I have one.

735
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,280
I wrote you about him.
Did you get that letter?

736
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,577
- You get my letters?
- Mmm. Some.

737
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:45,246
Here.

738
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:51,665
I like his face.
Tell me what he is.

739
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:54,296
He's remarkable, difficult.

740
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:55,933
It's not simple together.

741
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,675
I don't know
how to describe him.

742
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,144
He's an extraordinary
kind of American man.

743
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:05,515
- I want you to meet him.
- Mmm. I want to. I'm coming to New York.

744
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:08,363
- When?
- I'll be coming in a few months.

745
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:10,519
I have to get a better leg.

746
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:14,946
We have to talk fast now.
There isn't much time.

747
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,780
I need you to do
something else for me.

748
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:22,081
I have a baby.

749
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,750
I'll bring her with me
when I come to New York.

750
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:33,955
- I want to leave her with you.
- A little girl.

751
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:41,345
- Where is she?
- She's across the border in Alsace.

752
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:44,470
She lives with a baker's family. I can
see her whenever I can cross over,

753
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,889
but she shouldn't
be in Europe.

754
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:49,478
It ain't a place
for a baby these days.

755
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,733
- What's her name?
- Lilly.

756
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,200
She's fat. She's handsome.
She's very healthy.

757
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:04,905
She's nearly one year old.

758
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,956
And I don't even mind
that she looks like my mother.

759
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:17,758
I'll take care of her.

760
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,932
Well, I won't stay away long.
I can't last much longer in Europe.

761
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,182
The crutches make me
too noticeable.

762
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:27,432
You won't have to worry about
anything. There's enough money.

763
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:29,978
That doesn't matter.
You know that.

764
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:31,102
The father won't disturb you.

765
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:34,518
He doesn't want to have anything
to do with the baby or with me.

766
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:39,649
I don't know why I did it.
I don't care. The baby's good.

767
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,923
What is it?
Why is it like this?

768
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:02,135
Are you as angry now
as you used to be?

769
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:07,101
Mm-hmm. Yes. I try not to be,
but there you are.

770
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,683
I like your anger.

771
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,730
You're the only one
who does then.

772
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,482
Don't you let anybody
talk you out of it.

773
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:23,407
The man who's going to take care of you
has just come into the street.

774
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,121
He'll make sure you get
on the train safely.

775
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:29,872
And there'll be somebody who'll stay with you
till you get to Warsaw tomorrow morning.

776
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:34,004
I don't want to leave you.

777
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,285
I want to stay with you
a few more minutes.

778
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,669
No. Something might
still go wrong.

779
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,836
We can't be sure
who anyone is anymore.

780
01:34:43,427 --> 01:34:48,007
Now, I want you to stand up,
take your hat--

781
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,809
Listen to me.
Put your hat back on.

782
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:53,063
Say good-bye to me and then go.

783
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:10,041
I'll take care of Lilly.
It'll be wonderful.

784
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:13,368
Put your hat on.

785
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,252
Put the hat on.

786
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:23,218
Yes. My beloved friend.

787
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,390
Leave.

788
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,355
Good night.
Please follow me.

789
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:50,928
Your ticket, please.
Thank you.

790
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:55,346
Take care of yourself.
My best to everybody.

791
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,650
Thank you very much.
My very best to you, sir. Thank you.

792
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:02,360
My very best--

793
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,490
Thank you.

794
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,667
- Fräulein Hellman.
- Oui?

795
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:26,384
You will be asleep when
the border is crossed to Poland.

796
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:28,215
I will put your suitcase
outside for the customs.

797
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,430
I will not wake you, hmm?

798
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:35,098
Thank you.
Do you have a trunk?

799
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,232
Yes. I have a white trunk
in the baggage compartment.

800
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:39,939
Ah. I will need the key,
please.

801
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:45,398
Thank you.

802
01:37:57,621 --> 01:38:01,291
She's turned into a wild socialist,
giving away all her money.

803
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:14,431
I was with Anne Marie in Vienna,
and I was really in Elba most of the time.

804
01:38:14,513 --> 01:38:17,973
I'm doing a book on Napoléon.
I tried to kill myself in Elba.

805
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:22,982
Well, you do that
every few years, Sammy.

806
01:38:25,274 --> 01:38:28,194
I don't think you should
continue with Napoléon, Sammy.

807
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:30,947
Why don't you try the Wright brothers?
Or one‒ One of them.

808
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,530
Try Orville.

809
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:35,869
What about marriage?

810
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:37,161
- What about it?
- Still a virgin?

811
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:39,294
Why don't you
marry my brother Eliot?

812
01:38:39,371 --> 01:38:42,371
- I gotta go, Sammy.
- You're afraid of me.

813
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,788
You still think I want to
get in your bloomers.

814
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:48,628
God, Lilly, if you married Eliot,
I'd be your brother-in-law,

815
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:51,724
- and Anne Marie would be your sister-in-law.
- Oy. Oy.

816
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,140
Too late for
horror stories, Sammy.

817
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:58,259
- You drink too much.
- Hey, you're always so tough on Anne Marie.

818
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:01,429
What did she ever do to you?
She's really warm and passionate.

819
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:05,188
Ask me. I know. By the way,
she saw your old friend Julia.

820
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:09,277
- Where?
- In Vienna. She's turned into a wild socialist,

821
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,860
giving away all her money.

822
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:13,664
Listen, Sammy.
You tell Anne Marie...

823
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:17,909
that I don't want to hear any attacks
on Julia's belief or on Julia's life.

824
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:19,913
Not from her or from you.

825
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:23,082
- Good-bye, Sammy.
- Oh, come on, Lillian!

826
01:39:23,165 --> 01:39:27,085
Anne Marie doesn't hold ill thoughts.
You understand about relationships.

827
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:29,629
Why, Anne Marie and I were
a battleground all our lives.

828
01:39:29,713 --> 01:39:32,303
And here's something you don't know.
On my graduation day...

829
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:34,683
my little sister cried like an infant.

830
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,640
She took my arm and kissed me
and gave me a tender touch.

831
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:41,021
And within minutes‒ within minutes,
Lillian, it was done.

832
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,520
What I'd wanted to do all those years,
she had the same ideas as I had...

833
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:46,603
- tucked up inside her someplace.
- Oh, God.

834
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:50,149
And to this day, of all the girls
I've ever had, my sister was the best.

835
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:53,824
She was thrilling, Lillian. And did I ever
suspect what she had in mind?

836
01:39:53,904 --> 01:39:56,994
Not for a minute.
Don't look at me like that.

837
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:59,624
She was 16.
She was very complicated.

838
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:02,162
Come on now.
You're so slick, so unruffled.

839
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:05,666
You have no right to turn up
your nose. Your life's no closed book.

840
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:07,079
No one's scot-free, you know.

841
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:10,087
After all, the whole world
knows about you and Julia.

842
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,184
- What does the whole world know, Sammy?
- Oh.

843
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,220
- What does the world know?
- Oh.

844
01:40:18,303 --> 01:40:20,813
Don't be that way.
I'm a sophisticated man.

845
01:40:20,889 --> 01:40:25,349
If anybody understands
the sex urge of the adolescent girl, it's me.

846
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:29,056
Did you know that in Paris the women
are wearing watches around their legs?

847
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:31,268
Little garters
with timepieces in them.

848
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:11,517
Good morning. Just to say good-bye
to you and have a happy trip.

849
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:15,191
You're across
the border now.

850
01:41:15,277 --> 01:41:18,067
Your trunk was removed
by the Germans yesterday.

851
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:19,065
They kept it.

852
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:21,906
They must be suspicious,
but you're in no danger.

853
01:41:21,992 --> 01:41:25,242
Do not return from Moscow
through Germany.

854
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,499
Travel another way.

855
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:31,128
My best regards to your family.
Take care of yourself. Bye-bye now.

856
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:22,282
- Good night.
- Good night.

857
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,451
Hellman.

858
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:35,291
Spasiba.

859
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:49,744
Julia has been killed.

860
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:56,539
Please advise Moore's Funeral Home,
Whitechapel Road, London, what disposition.

861
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:02,336
My sorrow for you.
My sorrow for all of us.

862
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,590
Signed, John Watson.

863
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:10,144
And may I say
how sorry I am, madam.

864
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:17,184
These are the documents
you will require.

865
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:30,448
You wish to see her, madam?

866
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:34,582
There is rather a deep slash on her face,
which was difficult to cover up.

867
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:37,913
Yes.

868
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,380
This note was left for you.

869
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:53,352
It is your right to know...

870
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:56,520
that the Nazis
found her in Frankfurt.

871
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,770
She was in the apartment
of a colleague.

872
01:46:00,395 --> 01:46:03,225
We got her to London
in the hope of saving her.

873
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:08,485
None of us knows what disposition
her family wishes to make.

874
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:11,990
We could not reach
the grandparents or the mother.

875
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:15,794
I am sorry that I cannot
be there to help you.

876
01:46:16,411 --> 01:46:19,081
It is better that we take our sorrow
for this wonderful woman

877
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:22,084
into action and perhaps revenge.

878
01:46:23,168 --> 01:46:27,458
Yours, John Watson,
who speaks here for many others.

879
01:47:05,293 --> 01:47:07,423
I see a gun.

880
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:10,924
I see a gun,
and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it.

881
01:47:11,007 --> 01:47:13,837
I see a gun,
and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it,

882
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,967
- but it won't shoot.
- I see a gun,

883
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:19,064
and a handsome soldier's going
to shoot it, but it won't shoot,

884
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:21,641
and the brave, handsome soldier
says, "I need another gun."

885
01:47:21,726 --> 01:47:25,556
I see a gun, and a handsome soldier's
going to shoot it, but it won't shoot,

886
01:47:25,647 --> 01:47:28,397
and the soldier says,
"I need another gun,"

887
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:30,693
and someone shouts back,

888
01:47:30,777 --> 01:47:34,447
"Sorry, soldier.
That's the last gun!"

889
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:38,830
"That's the last gun!"

890
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:43,325
Where can I find,
uh, John Watson?

891
01:47:43,415 --> 01:47:46,035
I don't know
a John Watson, madam.

892
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:49,247
Well, you gave me a note.
He wrote me a note.

893
01:47:49,337 --> 01:47:52,257
I picked up the note
when I collected the body, madam.

894
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:54,340
Where did you collect
the body?

895
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:58,296
The house
of a Dr. Chester Lowe,

896
01:47:58,388 --> 01:48:00,808
18 Willoughby Road.

897
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:06,226
- Yes?
- Dr. Chester Lowe?

898
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:08,733
There's no
Dr. Chester Lowe here.

899
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,943
This is 18 Willoughby Road.

900
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:13,606
There's no Dr. Lowe.
I'm sorry.

901
01:48:13,695 --> 01:48:16,815
Well, perhaps
John Watson then.

902
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,869
I'm sorry.
You have the wrong address.

903
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:24,158
- I'm Julia's friend.
- I'm sorry.

904
01:48:24,247 --> 01:48:28,127
- I have a letter from John Watson.
- You have the wrong address!

905
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:42,219
She's across the border in Alsace.

906
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:44,477
She lives with a baker's family.

907
01:48:57,656 --> 01:49:01,986
It's impossible, madame. Alsace
is not a village. It is a big province.

908
01:49:19,469 --> 01:49:22,219
- Hi.
- Uh‒

909
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:24,845
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

910
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:28,103
I'm from America.
Uh, do you know any Americans?

911
01:49:28,186 --> 01:49:31,476
Americans?
What is it you want, madam?

912
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:34,685
Well, I'm a friend of one that you
might know. I'm looking for her baby.

913
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,650
I'm very busy, you see.

914
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,738
If you don't want bread,
I can't help you.

915
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:45,044
Madam, I'm a friend of Julia's.

916
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,580
Do you know about a baby
named Lilly?

917
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:55,250
There's no baby here.

918
01:49:55,338 --> 01:49:58,008
There's no baby.
Just go and have a look.

919
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:09,232
There's no baby. I'm sorry.

920
01:50:22,949 --> 01:50:25,119
- Do you need this anymore?
- Ah, no. That's all right.

921
01:50:25,201 --> 01:50:26,701
Is this all you got?

922
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:30,535
Hey.

923
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:58,899
Mr. Johann!

924
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:10,081
Mr. Johann! Hello!

925
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:14,251
Mr. Johann!

926
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:17,344
Lilly. Lilly.

927
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:20,670
It's all right.

928
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:23,377
All right. Go back to sleep.

929
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:33,103
- Please, ma'am, you'll have to wait outside.
- I will not wait outside.

930
01:51:33,186 --> 01:51:34,686
What's the trouble,
Anna?

931
01:51:35,271 --> 01:51:37,941
Raines,
do you remember me?

932
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,034
I used to come here
with Julia on weekends.

933
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:41,900
Remember, when we were
just little children?

934
01:51:43,071 --> 01:51:44,361
You remember,
her friend, Lillian.

935
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:47,867
- I'm afraid I don't.
- Of course, you do.

936
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:50,661
- Please, to step outside, madam.
- I will not please...

937
01:51:50,745 --> 01:51:53,955
to step anywhere until
I talk to Julia's grandparents.

938
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:57,542
They're on a cruise, madam.

939
01:51:57,627 --> 01:51:59,587
- They will not be returning for weeks.
- I don't believe you.

940
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:01,961
- I will take the information‒
- Julia has been murdered!

941
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,508
It's not to be referred to
as "information."

942
01:52:04,592 --> 01:52:05,842
I have her ashes,

943
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:08,297
and I want them to tell me what
I'm supposed to do with them.

944
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:10,308
- If you don't leave‒
- She has a child!

945
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,140
Don't they care about
their granddaughter's child?

946
01:52:12,225 --> 01:52:13,975
If you don't leave, madam,
I shall call the police.

947
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,640
Hello!

948
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:12,866
They never wanted
to find the baby.

949
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:15,452
I did.

950
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:17,829
You tried.

951
01:53:17,916 --> 01:53:20,376
I didn't try hard enough.

952
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:23,803
You hired detectives.
You had lawyers.

953
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,010
- You did what you could.
- I don't know.

954
01:53:27,675 --> 01:53:29,675
They never wanted
to find the baby.

955
01:53:29,761 --> 01:53:31,851
They wanted Julia's money,
and they got it.

956
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:35,020
- I know, the bastards.
- So now let it be.

957
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:45,479
There's something else now.
There's a war going on over there.

958
01:53:45,568 --> 01:53:47,988
Maybe she's alive in it.

959
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:49,781
The baby's dead, Lilly.

960
01:53:49,864 --> 01:53:52,954
I won't believe that.
You don't know that.

961
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:55,414
Lillian! The baby is dead.

962
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:58,035
Julia was and isn't.
That's all.

963
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:10,050
When you die, will you want me
to feel that way about you?

964
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:13,346
I'll outlive ya.

965
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:16,767
Oh, maybe not.
You're stubborn.

966
01:54:21,062 --> 01:54:22,942
Hammett didn't outlive me.

967
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:28,280
We lived together,
off and on, for... 30 years.

968
01:54:29,195 --> 01:54:32,235
And I've gone on
for a good many years since.

969
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:36,289
Sometimes fine, not always.

970
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:41,288
But he was right.
I am stubborn.

971
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:44,711
I haven't forgotten either of them.
