How long have you been working
on this project?

I've been with the American team
from the beginning.

00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,687
In fact, I saw you at the Montsoreau
conference which ended well...

00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,896
...especially for you.

5
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,901
Especially for the French.
If it isn't too late, my congratulations.

00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:29,348

did your people hear these sounds

7
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,981
Where did these sounds come from?
