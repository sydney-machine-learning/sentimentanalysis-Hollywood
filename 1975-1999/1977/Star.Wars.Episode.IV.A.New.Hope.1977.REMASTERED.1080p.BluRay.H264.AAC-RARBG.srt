1
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,171
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,508
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,759
This is madness.

4
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,021
We're doomed.

5
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,817
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,446
What's that?

7
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,510
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,404
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,615
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,245
We'll be sent to the spice mines of
Kessel or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,956
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,971
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,724
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,601
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,312
We intercepted
no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:57,650
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,280
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,328
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:12,290
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,387
There's one. Set for stun.

21
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,603
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,772
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,026
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,778
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:46,824
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,493
Come out, before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,830
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,541
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,087
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:11,682
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

31
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,059
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:17,104
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,775
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,255
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,590
The Imperial Senate
will not sit still for this.

36
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,300
When they hear you've attacked...

37
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,135
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

38
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,513
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

39
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:54,350
Several transmissions were beamed
to this ship by rebel spies.

40
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,311
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

41
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,355
I don't know what you're talking about.

42
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,525
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

43
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,486
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

44
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,989
Take her away!

45
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,119
Holding her is dangerous.

46
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,954
If word of this gets out,
it could generate

47
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,747
sympathy for the rebellion
in the senate.

48
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,500
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

49
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,378
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

50
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,255
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

51
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,923
Leave that to me.

52
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:29,510
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

53
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,805
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship

54
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,348
and no transmissions were made.

55
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,976
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting,

56
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,519
but no life-forms were aboard.

57
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,731
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

58
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,691
Send a detachment
down to retrieve them.

59
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,443
See to it personally, Commander.

60
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,445
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

61
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,113
Yes, sir.

62
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,713
How did we get into this mess?

63
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,257
I really don't know how.

64
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,762
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

65
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:19,060
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

66
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,526
What a desolate place this is.

67
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,741
Where do you think you're going?

68
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,326
Well, I'm not going that way.

69
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,037
It's much too rocky.

70
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,039
This way is much easier.

71
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,583
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

72
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,087
Don't get technical with me.

73
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,423
What mission?
What are you talking about?

74
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,512
I've just about had enough of you.

75
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,846
Go that way.

76
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,642
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

77
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,186
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help

78
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,646
because you won't get it.

79
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,120
No more adventures.

80
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,288
I'm not going that way.

81
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,325
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

82
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,412
He tricked me into going this way,

83
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,414
but he'll do no better.

84
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,919
Wait. What's that?

85
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:11,797
A transport. I'm saved.

86
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,591
Over here!

87
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,260
Hey! Hey!

88
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,847
Help! Please help!

89
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:51,976
R2?

90
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:59,483
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

91
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,937
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

92
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,939
Look, sir. Droids.

93
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,955
We stopped.

94
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,790
Wake up. Wake up!

95
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,382
We're doomed.

96
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,225
Do you think they'll melt us down?

97
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:30,657
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

98
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,910
Will this never end?

99
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,077
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

100
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,662
Luke!

101
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:25,212
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets
a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

102
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,798
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

103
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,061
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

104
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,147
No, not that one.

105
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,943
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

106
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,779
Protocol?
Why, it's my primary function, sir.

107
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,531
I am well versed in all the customs...

108
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,451
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

109
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,537
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

110
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,289
What I need is a droid who understands

111
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,332
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.

112
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,752
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters,

113
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,963
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

114
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,047
Can you speak Bocce?

115
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,550
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me.

116
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,052
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

117
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,304
Luke!

118
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,849
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

119
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,476
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

120
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,312
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

121
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,981
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

122
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,524
Now come on. Get to it.

123
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,611
All right. Come on.

124
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,741
And the red one. Come on.

125
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,494
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

126
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,098
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

127
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,893
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

128
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,395
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

129
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:13,320
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

130
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,989
- Uncle Owen? What about that one?
- Yeah?

131
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,284
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

132
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,536
Take this away.

133
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,162
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

134
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,666
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

135
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,251
Here he comes.

136
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,172
Okay. Let's go.

137
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,715
Now, don't you forget this.

138
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,302
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

139
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,812
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

140
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,858
I've got such a bad case of
dust contamination, I can barely move.

141
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,527
It just isn't fair.

142
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,738
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

143
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,032
Is there anything I might do to help?

144
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:02,536
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest,

145
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,079
or teleport me off this rock.

146
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,706
I don't think so, sir.

147
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,875
I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

148
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,877
Not on this planet, anyway.

149
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:14,381
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

150
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,550
Well, if there's a bright centre
to the universe,

151
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,885
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

152
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,388
I see, sir.

153
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,308
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

154
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,893
Just Luke.

155
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,731
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

156
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,483
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

157
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,860
Hello.

158
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,863
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.

159
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,823
Looks like you boys
have seen a lot of action.

160
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,074
With all we've been through,

161
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,535
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are,

162
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,953
what with the rebellion and all.

163
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,997
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

164
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,749
That's how we came to be
in your service,

165
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,667
if you take my meaning, sir.

166
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,086
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

167
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,088
Actually, there's not much to tell.

168
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,842
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

169
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,012
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

170
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,014
Well, my little friend,

171
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,183
you got something jammed
in here real good.

172
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,768
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

173
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,688
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

174
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,440
What's this?

175
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,652
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

176
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,697
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

177
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:28,038
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

178
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,709
Oh. He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

179
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,670
Old data. Pay it no mind.

180
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,130
Who is she? She's beautiful.

181
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,634
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

182
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,928
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

183
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,013
A person of some importance, I believe.

184
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,474
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

185
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,813
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

186
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,649
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

187
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,401
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

188
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,822
He says he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi,

189
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,448
a resident of these parts,

190
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,242
and it's a private message for him.

191
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,661
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know
what he's talking about.

192
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,496
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

193
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,248
But with all we've been through,

194
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,167
this little R2 unit
has become a bit eccentric.

195
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,629
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

196
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,424
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

197
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,968
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan,

198
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,721
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

199
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,639
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

200
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,809
I wonder who she is.

201
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,937
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

202
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:40,861
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

203
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,321
He suggests that if you remove the bolt,

204
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:46,324
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

205
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,744
Oh, yeah. Well...

206
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:52,372
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

207
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:53,623
Okay.

208
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,003
There you go.

209
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,216
Wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her
back. Play back the entire message.

210
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,301
"What message"?

211
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,553
The one you've just been playing.

212
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,764
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

213
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,224
Luke! Luke!

214
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,518
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

215
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,772
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

216
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,317
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

217
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,489
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

218
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,326
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

219
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,661
No, I don't like you either.

220
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,256
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought
might have been stolen.

221
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,424
What makes you think that?

222
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:47,135
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

223
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:49,971
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

224
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,894
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

225
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,190
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

226
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,067
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

227
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,529
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead

228
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,030
and have its memory erased.

229
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,282
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

230
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,079
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

231
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,914
He won't.

232
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,958
I don't think he exists any more.

233
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,876
He died about the same time
as your father.

234
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,963
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

235
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,676
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

236
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,095
In the morning,
I want them up there on the south ridge,

237
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,471
working on those condensers.

238
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,056
Yes, sir.

239
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,977
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

240
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,647
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement,

241
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,482
about me staying on another season.

242
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,027
And if these new droids do work out,

243
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,613
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

244
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,074
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

245
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,076
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

246
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,161
Harvest is when I need you the most.

247
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,247
It's only one season more.

248
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,040
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest

249
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,876
that I'll be able to hire
some more hands

250
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,919
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

251
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,839
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

252
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,842
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

253
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,011
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

254
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,555
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

255
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:15,515
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

256
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,019
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

257
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,521
It means so much to him.

258
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,149
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

259
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:29,821
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

260
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,073
That's what I'm afraid of.

261
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,417
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

262
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,252
Please don't deactivate me.

263
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,089
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

264
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:32,425
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

265
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,269
That R2 unit has
always been a problem.

266
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,939
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

267
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,233
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

268
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,027
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

269
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,487
Blast it!

270
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,823
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

271
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,783
It's too dangerous
with the Sandpeople around.

272
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,076
We'll have to wait till morning.

273
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,161
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

274
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,789
All right.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

275
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,291
Boy, am I gonna get it.

276
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,168
You know, that little droid's gonna
cause me a lot of trouble.

277
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,087
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

278
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,673
Come on.

279
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,558
Luke?

280
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,810
Luke?

281
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,062
Luke!

282
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,154
Have you seen Luke this morning?

283
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,657
He said he had some things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

284
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:41,369
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

285
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,330
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday

286
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,957
or there'll be hell to pay.

287
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,669
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

288
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,756
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

289
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,988
Hey, whoa!
Just where do you think you're going?

290
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:20,033
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

291
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,119
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

292
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,039
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

293
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,209
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

294
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:32,170
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

295
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,547
What's wrong with him now?

296
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,717
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

297
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,261
Sandpeople. Or worse.

298
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,223
Come on. Let's go have a look.

299
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:44,432
Come on.

300
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,897
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

301
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,774
Wait a second.

302
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,318
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

303
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,561
Hello there.

304
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,901
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

305
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,738
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

306
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,413
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

307
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,167
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

308
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,714
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

309
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,841
Boy, am I glad to see you.

310
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,969
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be travelled lightly.

311
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:52,268
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

312
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:53,895
This little droid.

313
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,607
I think he's searching
for his former master,

314
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,901
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

315
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,948
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

316
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,659
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

317
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,787
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

318
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,208
Obi-Wan.

319
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:19,879
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

320
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,298
A long time.

321
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,386
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

322
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,304
Oh, he's not dead.

323
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,514
Not yet.

324
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:33,101
- You know him?
- Well, of course I know him.

325
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,560
He's me.

326
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:40,024
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan

327
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:42,735
since, oh, before you were born.

328
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,487
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

329
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,198
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

330
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,202
Very interesting.

331
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,081
I think we better get indoors.

332
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:57,834
The Sandpeople are easily startled,

333
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,753
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

334
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,008
3PO.

335
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,020
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

336
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:21,774
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

337
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,569
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

338
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:28,781
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

339
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,659
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?

340
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,703
Quickly. They're on the move.

341
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,337
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

342
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,255
That's what your uncle told you.

343
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,174
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

344
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,385
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

345
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,472
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

346
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,601
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

347
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,313
I wish I'd known him.

348
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,149
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy

349
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,069
and a cunning warrior.

350
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:09,072
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

351
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,242
And he was a good friend.

352
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,036
Which reminds me...

353
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,122
I have something here for you.

354
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,835
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough,

355
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:25,463
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

356
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,549
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan

357
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:32,136
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

358
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,098
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

359
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,766
Sure. Go ahead.

360
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,855
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

361
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,274
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

362
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:49,487
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

363
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,407
An elegant weapon

364
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,493
for a more civilised age.

365
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,747
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights

366
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:03,918
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic

367
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,838
before the dark times,

368
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,464
before the Empire.

369
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,386
How did my father die?

370
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,391
A young Jedi named Darth Vader,

371
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,977
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil,

372
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:25,148
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

373
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,402
He betrayed and murdered your father.

374
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,489
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

375
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,453
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

376
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,289
The Force?

377
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:44,417
The Force is
what gives a Jedi his power.

378
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,086
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

379
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,714
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

380
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,924
It binds the galaxy together.

381
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,976
Now, let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend,

382
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,812
and where you come from.

383
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:08,107
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

384
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:12,528
<i>General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

385
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:16,032
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

386
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,452
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.</i>

387
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:21,204
<i>But my ship has fallen under attack</i>

388
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,956
<i>and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

389
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,126
<i>I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion</i>

390
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,420
<i>into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.</i>

391
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,422
<i>My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>

392
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:35,635
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

393
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,386
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

394
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:41,432
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

395
00:35:56,405 --> 00:36:00,576
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

396
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,662
Alderaan?

397
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:03,996
I'm not going to Alderaan.

398
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,499
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

399
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:09,043
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

400
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:12,213
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

401
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:20,179
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.

402
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,848
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

403
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:25,518
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

404
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:30,606
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

405
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:34,527
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

406
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,320
Learn about the Force, Luke.

407
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,205
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

408
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:49,625
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

409
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,963
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

410
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:05,141
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

411
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,685
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

412
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,437
They're more dangerous
than you realise.

413
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,398
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander,

414
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,233
not to this battle station.

415
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:17,903
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

416
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:22,325
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

417
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:26,579
I've just received word that the Emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

418
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:30,666
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

419
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,418
That's impossible.

420
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,129
How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

421
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:40,009
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

422
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:43,846
Fear will keep
the local systems in line.

423
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,057
Fear of this battle station.

424
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,266
And what of the rebellion?

425
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,603
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station,

426
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,605
it is possible, however unlikely,

427
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,857
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

428
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:59,195
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

429
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:03,532
Any attack made by the rebels against
this station would be a useless gesture,

430
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,701
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

431
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:09,413
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

432
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,791
I suggest we use it.

433
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:16,128
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

434
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:19,632
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant

435
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,550
next to the power of the Force.

436
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:25,137
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

437
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:28,057
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion

438
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,726
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes

439
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,230
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

440
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,490
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

441
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:48,536
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

442
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,079
As you wish.

443
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,417
This bickering is pointless.

444
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:59,338
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress

445
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:02,007
by the time this station is operational.

446
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:06,053
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

447
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:15,062
It looks like the Sandpeople did this,
all right.

448
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,772
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

449
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:19,692
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

450
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,695
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

451
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,697
These tracks are side-by-side.

452
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,909
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

453
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:31,871
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

454
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:36,751
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

455
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:40,755
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

456
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:43,466
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

457
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,222
If they traced the robots here,

458
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,099
they may have learned
who they sold them to

459
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:54,059
and that would lead them back home.

460
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,186
Wait, Luke.

461
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,438
It's too dangerous.

462
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,339
Uncle Owen.

463
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,257
Aunt Beru.

464
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,759
Uncle Owen.

465
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:22,565
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

466
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,902
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

467
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,696
You'd have been killed too,

468
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:13,574
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

469
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:17,912
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

470
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:20,039
There's nothing for me here now.

471
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:23,125
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

472
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:41,226
Mos Eisley spaceport.

473
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:46,899
You will never find a more wretched
hive of scum and villainy.

474
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,484
We must be cautious.

475
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,777
How long have you had these droids?

476
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,030
- About three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

477
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,032
Let me see your identification.

478
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,452
You don't need
to see his identification.

479
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,871
We don't need to see his identification.

480
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:45,791
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

481
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,793
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

482
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:51,046
He can go about his business.

483
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,383
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

484
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:57,302
Move along. Move along.

485
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:16,572
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

486
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:19,450
Go on, go on.

487
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:22,661
I can't understand
how we got by those troops.

488
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:24,079
I thought we were dead.

489
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:28,542
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

490
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,047
You really think we're gonna find

491
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,132
a pilot here that'll
take us to Alderaan?

492
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,968
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

493
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:41,847
Only watch your step,
this place can be a little rough.

494
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,640
I'm ready for anything.

495
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:49,396
Come along, R2.

496
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:43,033
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

497
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:45,035
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.

498
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,120
We don't want them here.

499
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,914
Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.

500
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,666
I heartily agree with you, sir.

501
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:01,760
Uh... I'll have one of those.

502
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:40,549
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:45,220
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

504
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:49,975
We're wanted men. I have the
death sentence on 12 systems.

505
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,853
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

506
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,897
This little one's not worth the effort.

507
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,524
Come, let me get you something.

508
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:58,817
Aah!

509
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,595
I'm all right.

510
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:32,726
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

511
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,191
I don't like the look of this.

512
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:57,584
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

513
00:47:57,668 --> 00:48:00,921
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

514
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,382
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

515
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:07,761
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

516
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:08,929
Should I have?

517
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:12,182
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

518
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:16,436
I've outrun imperial starships.

519
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,522
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

520
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:20,774
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

521
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:25,570
She's fast enough for you, old man.

522
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:28,573
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers.

523
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:31,493
Myself, the boy, two droids...

524
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:34,579
And no questions asked.

525
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,749
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

526
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:43,005
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

527
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:47,634
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

528
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:49,720
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

529
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:52,848
Ten thousand, all in advance.

530
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:55,851
Ten thousand?

531
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:58,937
We could almost
buy our own ship for that.

532
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:02,024
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

533
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:04,192
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot, myself.

534
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:06,778
We don't have to sit here and listen...

535
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,614
We can pay you 2,000 now,

536
00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:13,035
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

537
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,162
Seventeen?

538
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,959
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

539
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:23,879
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

540
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,505
Ninety-four.

541
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:30,469
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

542
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,555
All right. We'll check it out.

543
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,987
Seventeen thousand. Those guys
must really be desperate.

544
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:53,450
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

545
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,744
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

546
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,455
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

547
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,084
Yes, Greedo.

548
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,378
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

549
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:06,671
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

550
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:22,187
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.

551
00:50:26,316 --> 00:50:29,194
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba...

552
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:38,870
Even I get boarded sometimes.

553
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:41,206
Do you think I had a choice?

554
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:47,546
Over my dead body.

555
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:54,302
I'll bet you have.

556
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,402
Sorry about the mess.

557
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:22,706
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

558
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:26,168
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

559
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:29,838
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

560
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:32,132
What course shall we set?

561
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:36,011
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

562
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,345
What do you mean?

563
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:40,390
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

564
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:42,976
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

565
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:46,188
Lock the door, R2.

566
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,275
All right.
Check this side of the street.

567
00:51:54,446 --> 00:51:57,115
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

568
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,917
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

569
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,962
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

570
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:13,131
You watch your language.

571
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:18,553
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

572
00:52:18,637 --> 00:52:22,224
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

573
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:24,309
It'll be enough.

574
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,042
Right here, Jabba.

575
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:51,836
I've been waitin' for you.

576
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:58,426
You didn't think
I was gonna run, did you?

577
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,230
Jabba, next time
you wanna talk to me,

578
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,481
come see me yourself.

579
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,066
Don't send one of these twerps.

580
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:30,792
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

581
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:34,129
You think I had a choice?

582
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,131
But I got a nice, easy charter.

583
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:40,302
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

584
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,687
Fifteen, Jabba.
Don't push it.

585
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:05,160
Jabba, you're a
wonderful human being.

586
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:17,756
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

587
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,073
What a piece of junk.

588
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:45,700
She'll make.5 past light speed.

589
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:48,536
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

590
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,623
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

591
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:55,627
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

592
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,300
Hello, sir.

593
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:12,018
Which way?

594
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,897
All right, men, load your weapons.

595
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:20,110
Stop that ship. Blast them.

596
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,913
Chewie, get us out of here!

597
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:36,918
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

598
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,394
Grrr...

599
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:57,105
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

600
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,107
Our passengers
must be hotter than I thought.

601
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,984
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields

602
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:03,445
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

603
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:16,291
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

604
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,751
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

605
00:56:18,835 --> 00:56:21,379
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

606
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:23,882
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

607
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,092
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.

608
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,015
Here's where the fun begins.

609
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:33,933
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

610
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:36,978
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

611
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,980
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

612
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,649
Travelling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

613
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:44,235
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star

614
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:48,239
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

615
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:50,700
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

616
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:53,578
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

617
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:17,685
We've entered the Alderaan system.

618
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:19,062
Governor Tarkin.

619
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,814
I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

620
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:25,527
I recognised your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

621
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,988
Charming to the last.

622
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:31,616
You don't know how hard I found it

623
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,576
signing the order
to terminate your life.

624
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,621
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

625
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:39,791
Princess Leia, before your execution,

626
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,335
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony

627
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:45,380
that will make
this battle station operational.

628
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:48,716
No star system will dare
oppose the Emperor now.

629
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,052
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin,

630
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,721
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

631
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:57,100
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

632
00:57:57,183 --> 00:58:00,645
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet

633
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,897
that'll be destroyed first.

634
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:07,485
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base,

635
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:10,405
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power

636
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,366
on your home planet of Alderaan.

637
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:16,244
No. Alderaan is peaceful. We have
no weapons. You can't possibly...

638
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,746
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

639
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,999
Then name the system.

640
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:26,337
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

641
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,007
Where is the rebel base?

642
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:34,679
Dantooine.

643
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:36,681
They're on Dantooine.

644
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:40,184
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

645
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:43,021
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

646
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:45,356
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

647
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,276
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

648
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:52,447
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

649
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:53,781
No!

650
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,076
Commence primary ignition.

651
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,935
Are you all right? What's wrong?

652
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:26,397
I felt a great disturbance in the Force

653
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:29,609
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror

654
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:32,028
and were suddenly silenced.

655
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:34,197
I fear something terrible has happened.

656
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:38,159
You'd better get on with your exercises.

657
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:43,498
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

658
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:46,042
I told you I'd outrun them.

659
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,297
Don't everybody thank me at once.

660
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,551
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

661
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,353
Now be careful, R2.

662
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:14,612
Argh!

663
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:17,281
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

664
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,617
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

665
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:22,036
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

666
01:00:22,412 --> 01:00:24,580
That's 'cause a droid
don't pull people's arms

667
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,708
out of their sockets when they lose.

668
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:29,377
Wookiees are known to do that.

669
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,586
Grrr...

670
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:32,922
I see your point, sir.

671
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:36,259
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

672
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:38,845
Argh!

673
01:00:54,736 --> 01:00:58,364
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

674
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:01,451
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

675
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:03,453
But it also obeys your commands.

676
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,540
Oh!

677
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,668
Hokey religions and ancient weapons

678
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:12,962
are no match
for a blaster at your side, kid.

679
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,548
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

680
01:01:16,424 --> 01:01:18,885
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

681
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:20,553
I've seen a lot of strange stuff,

682
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,889
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe

683
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:26,434
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

684
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:30,605
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

685
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,691
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

686
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:36,652
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

687
01:01:38,196 --> 01:01:40,865
This time, let go your conscious self

688
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,161
and act on instinct.

689
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:49,665
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

690
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,959
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

691
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:03,721
Stretch out with your feelings.

692
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,363
You see? You can do it.

693
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:22,114
I call it luck.

694
01:02:22,198 --> 01:02:24,826
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

695
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:27,453
Look, good against remotes is one thing.

696
01:02:27,537 --> 01:02:30,706
Good against the living,
that's something else.

697
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,376
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

698
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:39,632
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

699
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:44,512
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

700
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,935
Yes?

701
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:52,770
Our scout ships
have reached Dantooine.

702
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:54,730
They found the remains of a rebel base,

703
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:57,233
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

704
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:01,028
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

705
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:04,240
She lied. She lied to us.

706
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:08,035
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

707
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,539
Terminate her immediately.

708
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:17,086
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

709
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:21,048
What the...

710
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,510
Aarghh arrgh!

711
01:03:24,594 --> 01:03:26,721
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower,

712
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:28,139
some kind of asteroid collision.

713
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,308
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

714
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,435
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

715
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:35,396
- What do you mean? Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

716
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,981
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

717
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:39,400
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

718
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,861
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

719
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,739
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

720
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,035
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

721
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:50,453
It's an imperial fighter.

722
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:54,916
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

723
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:57,460
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

724
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:02,798
Sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

725
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:05,051
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

726
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:08,554
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

727
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:15,645
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

728
01:04:15,728 --> 01:04:18,397
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

729
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:21,275
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

730
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,696
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

731
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,616
I think I can get him before he
gets there. He's almost in range.

732
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,994
That's no moon.

733
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:35,456
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

734
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:41,253
I have a very bad feeling about this.

735
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:43,172
Turn the ship around.

736
01:04:43,255 --> 01:04:45,841
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.

737
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:47,593
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

738
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,600
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

739
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:58,270
Why are we still moving towards it?

740
01:04:58,354 --> 01:05:00,439
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

741
01:05:00,523 --> 01:05:02,191
There's gotta be something you can do.

742
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:05,027
There's nothing I can do, kid.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

743
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:06,821
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

744
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:14,704
You can't win,
but there are alternatives to fighting.

745
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:33,472
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

746
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:35,933
<i>We are opening the magnetic field.</i>

747
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:52,867
To your stations. Come with me.

748
01:05:57,371 --> 01:06:01,000
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

749
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:03,169
Yes?

750
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:06,422
<i>We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.</i>

751
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:10,468
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

752
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:14,263
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

753
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:17,141
She may yet be of some use to us.

754
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:26,275
<i>Unlock one, five, seven and nine.
Release charge.</i>

755
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:29,945
<i>Three-one-six, report to control.</i>

756
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:34,909
There's no one on board, sir.

757
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:37,787
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

758
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:41,499
It must be a decoy, sir. Several escape
pods have been jettisoned.

759
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:43,459
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

760
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,628
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

761
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:49,048
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

762
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:50,257
Yes, sir.

763
01:06:50,341 --> 01:06:51,926
I sense something,

764
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,845
a presence I've not felt since...

765
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,933
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

766
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:00,643
I want every part of this ship checked.

767
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,403
There's no one here.

768
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:22,581
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

769
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:25,793
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

770
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,086
This is ridiculous.

771
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:29,922
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

772
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,132
Leave that to me.

773
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:34,426
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.

774
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:38,180
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

775
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,141
Argh!

776
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:51,986
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

777
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:54,864
All right. Let's go.

778
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,088
Hey, down there.

779
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,842
Could you give us a hand with this?

780
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:26,270
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

781
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,564
TK-421, do you copy?

782
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:44,246
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

783
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,459
Grrr!

784
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,515
Between his howling
and your blasting everything,

785
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:05,893
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

786
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:09,271
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

787
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:11,148
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

788
01:09:11,232 --> 01:09:14,276
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

789
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:29,041
He says he's found the controls to the
power beam that's holding the ship here.

790
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:31,710
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

791
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:36,298
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

792
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:39,718
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

793
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:45,391
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

794
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:48,936
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

795
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,187
I want to go with you.

796
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:53,107
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

797
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,608
They must be delivered safely

798
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:58,404
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

799
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:01,824
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

800
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:07,246
The Force will be with you...

801
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,039
Always.

802
01:10:14,962 --> 01:10:18,007
Argh argh argh!

803
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:20,467
You said it, Chewie.

804
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:22,970
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

805
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:25,723
Ben is a great man.

806
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,892
- Yeah. Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

807
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:32,104
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

808
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:34,189
Who do you think...

809
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:37,526
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

810
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:40,446
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

811
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:43,073
Who? Who has he found?

812
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:45,784
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

813
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:47,536
- Princess?
- Where? Where is she?

814
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:49,538
Princess? What's going on?

815
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,755
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

816
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:05,220
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

817
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:08,307
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

818
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,851
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

819
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,978
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

820
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:15,814
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

821
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:19,193
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

822
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:22,154
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

823
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:25,449
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

824
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:28,577
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

825
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,497
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

826
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:40,589
She's rich.

827
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:43,008
Argh!

828
01:11:43,759 --> 01:11:45,177
Rich?

829
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:49,598
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

830
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:52,184
- What?
- Well, more wealth than you can imagine.

831
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:54,395
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

832
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:56,438
- You'll get it.
- I better.

833
01:11:56,522 --> 01:11:58,232
You will.

834
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:00,567
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

835
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:02,653
- All right.
- What's your plan?

836
01:12:03,654 --> 01:12:06,156
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

837
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:09,118
Okay.

838
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:11,787
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

839
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,080
Grrr!

840
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:16,417
Okay, Han, you put those on.

841
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:19,628
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

842
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:22,506
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking,

843
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:25,426
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

844
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:29,430
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

845
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:31,557
That isn't very reassuring.

846
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:38,272
Grrr!

847
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:56,457
<i>517 to scan control.
517 to scan control.</i>

848
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:01,753
<i>316, report to control.</i>

849
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:10,345
<i>5-3 to upper bay door.
5-3 to upper bay door.</i>

850
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:25,360
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

851
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,311
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

852
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:01,396
I did say so before.

853
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:19,623
Where are you taking this thing?

854
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:22,459
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

855
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:25,671
I wasn't notified.

856
01:14:25,754 --> 01:14:27,756
I'll have to clear it.

857
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:34,179
Argh!

858
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:36,807
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

859
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:02,124
Look out.

860
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:09,339
Aargh!

861
01:15:12,301 --> 01:15:14,761
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

862
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:17,055
Here it is. 2187. You go and get her.

863
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:19,141
I'll hold them here.

864
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:25,689
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

865
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:26,857
<i>What happened?</i>

866
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,984
Had a slight weapons malfunction,

867
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:31,486
but everything's
perfectly all right now.

868
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:34,740
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

869
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:37,492
- How are you?
<i>- We're sending a squad up.</i>

870
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:41,872
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

871
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:45,667
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

872
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:48,879
<i>Who is this?
What's your operating number?</i>

873
01:15:50,756 --> 01:15:54,468
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

874
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:10,484
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

875
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:13,111
Huh? Oh, the uniform.

876
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:16,865
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

877
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:17,949
You're who?

878
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,910
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

879
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:22,162
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

880
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,538
Come on.

881
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:28,960
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

882
01:16:29,044 --> 01:16:32,422
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

883
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:36,385
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

884
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,887
Surely he must be dead by now.

885
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,807
Don't underestimate the Force.

886
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:46,478
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

887
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:49,856
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

888
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,149
Yes.

889
01:16:51,233 --> 01:16:54,736
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

890
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:58,031
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

891
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:01,743
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

892
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:04,663
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

893
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:08,250
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

894
01:17:15,841 --> 01:17:17,134
Argh!

895
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:19,386
Get behind me. Get behind me.

896
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:33,275
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

897
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:37,279
Can't get out that way.

898
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:39,781
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

899
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:42,325
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

900
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:46,538
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

901
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:50,125
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

902
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:54,463
What was that? I didn't copy.

903
01:17:54,755 --> 01:17:58,091
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

904
01:17:58,175 --> 01:18:00,719
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

905
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:03,054
All other information on your level
is restricted.

906
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:06,141
Open up in there. Open up in there.

907
01:18:07,017 --> 01:18:08,435
Oh, no.

908
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,145
There isn't any other way out.

909
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:13,815
Argh!

910
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,986
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

911
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,154
This is some rescue.

912
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:21,948
When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

913
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:23,658
He's the brains, sweetheart.

914
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:25,410
Well, I didn't...

915
01:18:26,828 --> 01:18:29,998
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

916
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,044
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

917
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:43,720
- Get in there!
- Aargh!

918
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:46,807
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

919
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:50,143
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

920
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:53,855
Wonderful girl.

921
01:18:56,024 --> 01:18:58,318
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

922
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:01,738
Get in there.

923
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:08,078
Wa-hoo!

924
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:12,958
Argh!

925
01:19:15,335 --> 01:19:18,797
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

926
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,341
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

927
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:26,179
Let's get out of here.

928
01:19:26,263 --> 01:19:28,723
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

929
01:19:35,397 --> 01:19:37,774
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

930
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:40,151
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

931
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:41,987
Absolutely, Your Worship.

932
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,906
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

933
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,617
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

934
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:48,994
It could be worse.

935
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:54,875
It's worse.

936
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:58,003
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

937
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,755
Something just moved past my leg.

938
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:05,635
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

939
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:29,034
Kid! Luke!

940
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:31,661
Luke!

941
01:20:32,746 --> 01:20:33,955
Luke!

942
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,340
Grab hold of this!

943
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:45,800
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

944
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:48,637
- Where?
- Anywhere!

945
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:57,604
Luke! Luke!

946
01:21:21,252 --> 01:21:22,921
Help him!

947
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:24,965
- What happened?
- I don't know.

948
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:27,884
It just let go of me and disappeared.

949
01:21:33,932 --> 01:21:36,351
I got a bad feeling about this.

950
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:43,024
The walls are moving!

951
01:21:43,108 --> 01:21:45,485
Don't just stand there.
Try and brace it with something.

952
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:51,157
Grrr!

953
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,453
Help me.

954
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:10,093
Wait a minute.

955
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:15,724
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

956
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:17,976
<i>3PO!</i>

957
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:20,103
<i>Where could he be?</i>

958
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:26,443
Take over. See to him.

959
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:30,405
Look, there.

960
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:35,201
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

961
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:37,203
If you hurry, you might catch them.

962
01:22:37,287 --> 01:22:38,788
Follow me.

963
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,586
You stand guard.

964
01:22:49,257 --> 01:22:50,592
Come on.

965
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:55,597
Oh.

966
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:01,686
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

967
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:04,898
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

968
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:06,566
All right.

969
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:15,742
Argh! Argh!

970
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:21,498
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

971
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:23,041
3PO.

972
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:25,794
- Get on top.
- I can't.

973
01:23:25,877 --> 01:23:27,796
Where could he be? 3PO.

974
01:23:29,172 --> 01:23:31,007
3PO, will you come in?

975
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:34,010
They aren't here. Something must have
happened to them.

976
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:36,721
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

977
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:43,478
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

978
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:48,650
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

979
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:57,992
Thank goodness they haven't
found them. Where could they be?

980
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:02,080
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

981
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:03,748
I forgot. I turned it off.

982
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:10,713
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

983
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:13,716
- We've had some problems.
<i>- Will you shut up and listen to me?</i>

984
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,554
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?

985
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:20,640
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

986
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:24,435
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

987
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:27,272
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

988
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:40,368
What?

989
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,204
You did great, 3PO!

990
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:45,665
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

991
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,959
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.

992
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:51,129
It's all my fault. My poor master.

993
01:24:51,212 --> 01:24:52,797
We're all right. You did great!

994
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:56,092
Hey! Open the pressure
maintenance hatch

995
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:57,594
on unit number... Where are we?

996
01:24:58,136 --> 01:25:00,930
<i>3263827.</i>

997
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:50,521
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

998
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:52,273
Let's get moving.

999
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:53,983
Grrr!

1000
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:56,152
Where you goin'?

1001
01:25:56,236 --> 01:25:58,071
Wait! They'll hear!

1002
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:01,241
Come here, you big coward.

1003
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:02,992
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

1004
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:06,621
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

1005
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:09,540
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

1006
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:13,378
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

1007
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:16,756
I take orders from just one person. Me.

1008
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:18,758
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1009
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:22,053
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

1010
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:24,430
No reward is worth this.

1011
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:36,567
Give me regular reports, please.

1012
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:37,735
Right.

1013
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:43,199
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

1014
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,123
You seen that new VT-16?

1015
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:52,500
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1016
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,585
They say it's quite a thing to see.

1017
01:26:54,669 --> 01:26:56,879
What was that?

1018
01:26:56,963 --> 01:27:00,216
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

1019
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:07,181
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

1020
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:08,433
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1021
01:27:08,516 --> 01:27:10,393
- Are you safe?
<i>- For the moment.</i>

1022
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,812
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

1023
01:27:15,148 --> 01:27:16,858
We're right above you. Stand by.

1024
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:19,527
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

1025
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,612
Nice. Come on.

1026
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:26,701
It's them. Blast them.

1027
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:29,454
- Get back to the ship!
- Aargh!

1028
01:27:29,537 --> 01:27:31,748
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

1029
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:34,959
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

1030
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,216
Aaaah!

1031
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:02,445
I think we took a wrong turn.

1032
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:08,409
There's no lock.

1033
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:15,333
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

1034
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:18,753
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

1035
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:20,463
They're coming through.

1036
01:28:42,819 --> 01:28:44,487
Here, hold this.

1037
01:29:01,212 --> 01:29:02,422
Here they come.

1038
01:29:13,266 --> 01:29:14,809
For luck.

1039
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:25,653
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1040
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,794
Where could they be?

1041
01:29:45,882 --> 01:29:47,425
Close the blast doors.

1042
01:29:54,599 --> 01:29:56,851
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1043
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:20,833
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1044
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:22,627
The circle is now complete.

1045
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:24,921
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1046
01:30:25,004 --> 01:30:27,381
Now I am the master.

1047
01:30:27,465 --> 01:30:29,800
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1048
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:52,073
Your powers are weak, old man.

1049
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:55,910
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down,

1050
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:59,413
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1051
01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:08,798
You should not have come back.

1052
01:31:34,532 --> 01:31:36,158
Didn't we just leave this party?

1053
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:37,410
Aargh!

1054
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:41,414
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1055
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:43,791
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1056
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,876
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1057
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:02,476
Look.

1058
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:07,356
Come on, R2. We're going.

1059
01:32:09,025 --> 01:32:10,151
Now's our chance. Go!

1060
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,281
Ben?

1061
01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:31,464
No!

1062
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,432
- Come on!
- Luke, come on!

1063
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:43,976
Come on!

1064
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,188
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1065
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:58,366
<i>Run, Luke, run.</i>

1066
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:03,954
I hope that old man got
the tractor beam out of commission,

1067
01:33:04,038 --> 01:33:06,165
or this is gonna be a short trip.
Okay, hit it!

1068
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:19,261
Aargh aargh!

1069
01:33:38,322 --> 01:33:40,241
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1070
01:33:40,324 --> 01:33:42,118
Hold them off.
Angle the deflector shields

1071
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:43,828
while I charge up the main guns.

1072
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,922
I can't believe he's gone.

1073
01:33:58,843 --> 01:34:00,636
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1074
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:03,305
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1075
01:34:20,156 --> 01:34:22,533
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1076
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:34,503
Here they come.

1077
01:34:52,521 --> 01:34:54,356
They're coming in too fast!

1078
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:06,202
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1079
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:09,789
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1080
01:35:26,514 --> 01:35:27,848
Ha ha!

1081
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:33,437
Got him. I got him!

1082
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:35,898
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1083
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:38,901
There's still two more of them
out there.

1084
01:36:12,768 --> 01:36:15,604
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1085
01:36:16,564 --> 01:36:19,108
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1086
01:36:27,116 --> 01:36:28,534
Are they away?

1087
01:36:28,617 --> 01:36:31,579
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1088
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:35,082
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1089
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:38,836
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1090
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:40,588
This had better work.

1091
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,632
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1092
01:36:43,716 --> 01:36:46,760
You know,
sometimes I amaze even myself.

1093
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,221
That doesn't sound too hard.

1094
01:36:49,305 --> 01:36:53,309
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1095
01:36:53,392 --> 01:36:56,186
- Easy? You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1096
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:57,688
Not this ship, sister.

1097
01:36:58,981 --> 01:37:01,525
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1098
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:04,028
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1099
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:07,281
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1100
01:37:07,364 --> 01:37:10,659
I only hope that when the data's
analysed a weakness can be found.

1101
01:37:10,743 --> 01:37:14,121
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1102
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:15,915
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution,

1103
01:37:15,998 --> 01:37:17,708
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1104
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:20,544
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1105
01:37:20,794 --> 01:37:22,838
You needn't worry about your reward.

1106
01:37:22,922 --> 01:37:25,841
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1107
01:37:29,011 --> 01:37:30,930
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1108
01:37:31,013 --> 01:37:34,266
I wonder if he really cares
about anything or anybody.

1109
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:37,019
I care.

1110
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:45,110
So...

1111
01:37:45,653 --> 01:37:47,404
What do you think of her, Han?

1112
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:49,073
I'm trying not to, kid.

1113
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:51,200
Good.

1114
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,456
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1115
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:02,711
What do you think? You think
a princess and a guy like me...

1116
01:38:02,795 --> 01:38:03,796
No.

1117
01:38:51,218 --> 01:38:54,263
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1118
01:38:54,346 --> 01:38:56,265
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.

1119
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:59,351
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1120
01:38:59,435 --> 01:39:01,437
It's our only hope.

1121
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:23,542
Yes.

1122
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,252
<i>We're approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

1123
01:39:25,335 --> 01:39:27,671
<i>The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.</i>

1124
01:39:27,755 --> 01:39:29,757
<i>We are preparing to orbit the planet.</i>

1125
01:39:38,766 --> 01:39:40,851
The battle station is heavily shielded

1126
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:44,396
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1127
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:49,193
Its defences are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1128
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:54,490
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defence.

1129
01:39:56,283 --> 01:39:57,367
Pardon me for asking, sir,

1130
01:39:57,451 --> 01:40:00,079
but what good are snub fighters
against that?

1131
01:40:00,162 --> 01:40:04,750
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat

1132
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:07,503
or they'd have a tighter defence.

1133
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:10,964
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia

1134
01:40:11,048 --> 01:40:14,134
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1135
01:40:14,968 --> 01:40:16,970
The approach will not be easy.

1136
01:40:17,596 --> 01:40:20,182
You're required to manoeuvre
straight down this trench

1137
01:40:20,265 --> 01:40:22,893
and skim the surface to this point.

1138
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:26,480
The target area is only two metres wide.

1139
01:40:26,647 --> 01:40:30,234
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1140
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:34,655
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1141
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:37,491
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction

1142
01:40:37,574 --> 01:40:39,785
which should destroy the station.

1143
01:40:39,868 --> 01:40:43,413
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1144
01:40:43,497 --> 01:40:46,667
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1145
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:48,919
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1146
01:40:49,002 --> 01:40:50,212
But it's not impossible.

1147
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:52,798
I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1148
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:55,300
They're not much bigger
than two metres.

1149
01:40:55,384 --> 01:40:58,554
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1150
01:41:06,812 --> 01:41:09,398
<i>Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.</i>

1151
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:13,777
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1152
01:41:14,027 --> 01:41:16,488
This will be a day long remembered.

1153
01:41:16,572 --> 01:41:18,574
It has seen the end of Kenobi

1154
01:41:18,657 --> 01:41:21,702
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1155
01:41:26,999 --> 01:41:30,252
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1156
01:41:30,627 --> 01:41:33,130
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

1157
01:41:35,716 --> 01:41:38,844
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1158
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:40,929
That's right. Yeah.

1159
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:44,641
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1160
01:41:44,725 --> 01:41:46,894
Even if I didn't,
you don't think I'd be fool enough

1161
01:41:46,977 --> 01:41:49,188
to stick around here, do ya?

1162
01:41:49,271 --> 01:41:50,606
Why don't you come with us?

1163
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:52,649
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1164
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:55,611
Come on.
Why don't you take a look around?

1165
01:41:55,694 --> 01:41:58,363
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1166
01:41:58,447 --> 01:42:01,575
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1167
01:42:01,867 --> 01:42:04,036
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1168
01:42:04,244 --> 01:42:07,080
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1169
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:09,750
It's more like suicide.

1170
01:42:11,585 --> 01:42:14,421
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1171
01:42:14,504 --> 01:42:17,174
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1172
01:42:17,549 --> 01:42:18,592
Hey, Luke.

1173
01:42:21,929 --> 01:42:24,306
May the Force be with you.

1174
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:28,769
Argh!

1175
01:42:30,812 --> 01:42:34,441
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1176
01:42:38,528 --> 01:42:40,906
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1177
01:42:42,074 --> 01:42:44,034
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1178
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:52,084
- What's wrong?
- Oh, it's Han.

1179
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:54,670
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1180
01:42:54,753 --> 01:42:58,298
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1181
01:42:59,299 --> 01:43:02,094
I only wish Ben were here.

1182
01:43:09,768 --> 01:43:12,688
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1183
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:14,690
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1184
01:43:14,773 --> 01:43:16,441
Hey, Luke!

1185
01:43:16,525 --> 01:43:19,736
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1186
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:21,905
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1187
01:43:21,989 --> 01:43:24,533
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1188
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:27,577
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1189
01:43:27,661 --> 01:43:31,498
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1190
01:43:32,124 --> 01:43:34,626
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1191
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:38,630
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1192
01:43:38,714 --> 01:43:41,466
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1193
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:44,553
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1194
01:43:45,053 --> 01:43:46,054
<i>Stand clear.</i>

1195
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:50,350
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1196
01:43:50,726 --> 01:43:53,603
Not on your life. That little droid
and I have been through a lot.

1197
01:43:53,687 --> 01:43:54,730
You okay, R2?

1198
01:43:56,356 --> 01:43:57,774
Good.

1199
01:43:58,817 --> 01:44:02,154
<i>Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.</i>

1200
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:05,240
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1201
01:44:06,908 --> 01:44:09,119
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1202
01:44:57,918 --> 01:45:00,921
<i>Luke,
the Force will be with you.</i>

1203
01:45:12,724 --> 01:45:16,019
<i>Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.</i>

1204
01:45:16,103 --> 01:45:19,272
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1205
01:45:32,369 --> 01:45:34,621
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1206
01:45:34,704 --> 01:45:36,957
- <i>Red Seven standing by.</i>
- Red Three standing by.

1207
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,793
- Red Six standing by.
- <i>Red Nine standing by.</i>

1208
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,920
- Red Two standing by.
- <i>Red 11 standing by.</i>

1209
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:43,964
Red Five standing by.

1210
01:45:45,298 --> 01:45:47,217
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1211
01:45:51,471 --> 01:45:53,473
<i>We're passing
through the magnetic field.</i>

1212
01:45:53,557 --> 01:45:56,351
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

1213
01:45:56,435 --> 01:45:57,894
<i>Double front.</i>

1214
01:46:00,897 --> 01:46:02,399
Look at the size of that thing.

1215
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:05,318
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1216
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:11,533
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1217
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:14,494
<i>- I copy, Gold Leader.</i>
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1218
01:46:14,578 --> 01:46:18,039
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1219
01:46:32,471 --> 01:46:35,765
- <i>Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.</i>
- <i>I see it. Stay low.</i>

1220
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,733
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1221
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:50,280
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1222
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:54,284
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1223
01:47:00,248 --> 01:47:01,958
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader,

1224
01:47:02,042 --> 01:47:04,294
but they're so small
they're evading our turbolasers.

1225
01:47:04,377 --> 01:47:06,171
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1226
01:47:06,254 --> 01:47:08,381
Get the crews to their fighters.

1227
01:47:10,926 --> 01:47:12,802
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire

1228
01:47:12,886 --> 01:47:15,138
coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.

1229
01:47:15,222 --> 01:47:16,223
I'm on it.

1230
01:47:16,306 --> 01:47:19,726
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1231
01:47:26,066 --> 01:47:27,859
I've got a problem here.

1232
01:47:27,943 --> 01:47:29,361
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1233
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:31,613
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1234
01:47:35,784 --> 01:47:39,412
<i>The rebel base will be in
firing range in seven minutes.</i>

1235
01:47:42,624 --> 01:47:45,544
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1236
01:47:53,426 --> 01:47:55,053
Squad leaders,

1237
01:47:55,136 --> 01:47:57,264
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1238
01:47:57,347 --> 01:47:58,932
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1239
01:47:59,015 --> 01:48:00,725
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1240
01:48:00,809 --> 01:48:03,019
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- <i>Here they come.</i>

1241
01:48:06,273 --> 01:48:07,983
Watch it! You've got one on your tail.

1242
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:14,406
I'm hit!

1243
01:48:15,657 --> 01:48:18,201
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1244
01:48:20,203 --> 01:48:21,955
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1245
01:48:23,873 --> 01:48:25,959
I'll be right there.

1246
01:48:37,846 --> 01:48:41,308
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1247
01:48:44,728 --> 01:48:47,856
- <i>Fall in. Fall in.</i>
- <i>Watch your back, Luke.</i>

1248
01:48:47,939 --> 01:48:50,150
<i>Watch your back!
Fighters above you, coming in.</i>

1249
01:48:56,531 --> 01:48:59,284
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1250
01:48:59,367 --> 01:49:01,536
<i>Hang on back there.</i>

1251
01:49:02,162 --> 01:49:04,289
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1252
01:49:04,372 --> 01:49:06,833
<i>There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1253
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:08,668
I can't shake him.

1254
01:49:12,339 --> 01:49:13,882
I'm on him, Luke.

1255
01:49:17,093 --> 01:49:18,720
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1256
01:49:25,977 --> 01:49:28,521
- Thanks, Wedge.
- <i>Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1257
01:49:28,605 --> 01:49:31,733
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.

1258
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,945
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.</i>

1259
01:49:38,365 --> 01:49:40,659
Stay in attack formation.

1260
01:49:40,742 --> 01:49:43,495
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1261
01:49:49,459 --> 01:49:52,629
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1262
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:55,924
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1263
01:50:00,637 --> 01:50:02,389
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1264
01:50:02,472 --> 01:50:05,725
<i>Say about 20 guns, some on
the surface, some on the towers.</i>

1265
01:50:05,809 --> 01:50:08,645
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1266
01:50:10,772 --> 01:50:13,817
Switch to targeting computer.

1267
01:50:16,277 --> 01:50:18,279
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1268
01:50:20,615 --> 01:50:22,784
The guns. They've stopped.

1269
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:27,247
Stabilise your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1270
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:29,582
They're coming in. Three marks at 210.

1271
01:50:31,835 --> 01:50:33,753
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1272
01:50:33,837 --> 01:50:35,130
Yes, sir.

1273
01:50:49,602 --> 01:50:52,105
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.

1274
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:54,107
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1275
01:50:55,859 --> 01:50:56,860
Loosen up!

1276
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:02,699
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1277
01:51:02,782 --> 01:51:05,160
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1278
01:51:11,499 --> 01:51:14,127
We've analysed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1279
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:16,129
Should I have your ship standing by?

1280
01:51:16,212 --> 01:51:19,090
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1281
01:51:19,174 --> 01:51:21,676
I think you overestimate their chances.

1282
01:51:22,343 --> 01:51:24,387
<i>Rebel base,
three minutes and closing.</i>

1283
01:51:25,388 --> 01:51:27,015
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1284
01:51:27,098 --> 01:51:28,808
<i>Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.</i>

1285
01:51:28,892 --> 01:51:30,643
<i>This is Red Two
flying toward you.</i>

1286
01:51:30,727 --> 01:51:32,687
<i>Red Three standing by.</i>

1287
01:51:32,771 --> 01:51:34,481
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1288
01:51:34,564 --> 01:51:37,233
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1289
01:51:37,317 --> 01:51:39,944
<i>Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.</i>

1290
01:51:40,028 --> 01:51:43,364
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1291
01:51:51,998 --> 01:51:53,249
This is it.

1292
01:51:57,587 --> 01:51:59,088
We should be able to see it by now.

1293
01:52:01,382 --> 01:52:03,176
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1294
01:52:04,928 --> 01:52:07,347
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1295
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:10,433
- No sign of any... Wait. Coming in.35.
- I see them.

1296
01:52:11,976 --> 01:52:13,061
I'm in range.

1297
01:52:14,354 --> 01:52:15,355
Target's coming up.

1298
01:52:18,650 --> 01:52:20,777
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1299
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:23,238
Close up formation.

1300
01:52:24,989 --> 01:52:26,574
Almost there.

1301
01:52:35,834 --> 01:52:39,087
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1302
01:52:40,463 --> 01:52:42,131
I can't hold them.

1303
01:52:50,098 --> 01:52:51,140
It's away!

1304
01:52:55,603 --> 01:52:57,230
- <i>It's a hit!</i>
- <i>Negative.</i>

1305
01:52:57,313 --> 01:52:59,399
Negative. It didn't go in.

1306
01:52:59,482 --> 01:53:02,151
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1307
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:09,701
<i>Red Leader, we're right above you.</i>

1308
01:53:09,784 --> 01:53:12,537
Turn t0.05. We'll cover for you.

1309
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:15,582
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1310
01:53:16,374 --> 01:53:18,626
Get set up for your attack run.

1311
01:53:31,973 --> 01:53:34,601
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1312
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:36,895
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.</i>

1313
01:53:36,978 --> 01:53:40,356
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.

1314
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:41,441
Right with you, boss.

1315
01:53:42,483 --> 01:53:44,944
Luke, at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1316
01:53:45,028 --> 01:53:47,030
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1317
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,664
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1318
01:53:56,748 --> 01:53:59,459
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.</i>

1319
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:01,127
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1320
01:54:04,339 --> 01:54:06,341
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1321
01:54:06,424 --> 01:54:07,717
What about that tower?

1322
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,219
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1323
01:54:16,643 --> 01:54:20,229
R2, that stabiliser's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1324
01:54:29,405 --> 01:54:31,199
Fighters coming in.3.

1325
01:54:40,124 --> 01:54:42,627
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- <i>Get clear, Wedge.</i>

1326
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:44,295
You can't do any more good back there.

1327
01:54:44,379 --> 01:54:45,630
Sorry.

1328
01:54:46,255 --> 01:54:48,216
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1329
01:54:51,177 --> 01:54:53,388
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1330
01:54:57,558 --> 01:54:59,018
R2, try and increase the power.

1331
01:55:05,650 --> 01:55:06,901
<i>Hurry up, Luke. Quick.</i>

1332
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:08,945
Quick.

1333
01:55:15,994 --> 01:55:18,538
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1334
01:55:18,621 --> 01:55:19,622
I'm on the leader.

1335
01:55:23,209 --> 01:55:24,711
Hang on, R2.

1336
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,104
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1337
01:55:45,898 --> 01:55:47,900
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1338
01:55:49,569 --> 01:55:51,779
The Force is strong with this one.

1339
01:55:51,863 --> 01:55:53,823
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1340
01:55:58,995 --> 01:56:00,830
<i>His computer's off.</i>

1341
01:56:00,913 --> 01:56:03,499
<i>Luke, you switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?</i>

1342
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:06,252
<i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>

1343
01:56:18,973 --> 01:56:20,266
<i>I've lost R2.</i>

1344
01:56:21,684 --> 01:56:23,936
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1345
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:26,355
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1346
01:56:27,398 --> 01:56:29,025
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1347
01:56:29,108 --> 01:56:31,027
You may fire when ready.

1348
01:56:31,736 --> 01:56:33,196
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1349
01:56:47,168 --> 01:56:48,628
I have you now.

1350
01:56:51,047 --> 01:56:52,215
What?

1351
01:56:52,298 --> 01:56:53,466
Ya-hoo!

1352
01:56:54,842 --> 01:56:55,885
Look out.

1353
01:57:02,517 --> 01:57:05,353
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1354
01:57:12,193 --> 01:57:13,820
<i>Stand by.</i>

1355
01:57:17,198 --> 01:57:18,908
<i>Stand by.</i>

1356
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:30,670
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1357
01:57:32,046 --> 01:57:36,551
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1358
01:57:56,195 --> 01:57:57,488
- Luke!
- Leia!

1359
01:58:00,575 --> 01:58:01,826
- Hey!
- Hey!

1360
01:58:01,909 --> 01:58:03,786
I just knew you'd come back.
I just knew it!

1361
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:06,581
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1362
01:58:06,664 --> 01:58:09,041
I knew there was more to you
than money.

1363
01:58:09,375 --> 01:58:10,418
Oh, no.

1364
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:12,962
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1365
01:58:13,629 --> 01:58:16,507
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1366
01:58:16,591 --> 01:58:19,844
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1367
01:58:19,927 --> 01:58:22,847
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1368
01:58:22,930 --> 01:58:24,932
He'll be all right.

1369
01:58:58,674 --> 01:59:00,218
Argh!

1370
02:00:02,738 --> 02:00:05,324
Argh!

1371
02:00:12,123 --> 02:00:14,959
Argh!
