1
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,867
HERE'S OUR STOP.
COME ON.

2
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,408
THIS TIME NEXT WEEK:
CALIFORNIA.

3
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,412
YOU EXCITED?

4
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,463
UH-HUH.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,666
ME, TOO. I CAN'T WAIT.

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,915
WERE YOU EVER THERE?

7
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,457
ONCE, FOR SIX WEEKS,

8
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,921
TOURING WITH
SOME MUSICAL.

9
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,172
IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER
WE WENT SWIMMING.

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,263
WHICH MUSICAL?

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,257
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

12
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,258
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL IT'S GOING TO BE.

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,431
WE'LL FIND A HOUSE
IN THE HILLS.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,430
NEAR THE MOVIE
STUDIOS?

15
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,692
YES. YOUR WINDOW WILL
FACE WARNER BROTHERS.

16
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,274
YOU CAN WATCH THEM BLOW UP
THE WORLD FROM YOUR BED.

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,691
CAN YOU IMAGINE
YOUR VERY OWN ORANGE TREE?

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,862
THE MUSICAL WAS
FIDDLER ON THE ROOF.

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,861
I WAS 4 1/2.

20
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,823
YOU WERE
NEVER 4 1/2.

21
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,954
YOU WERE BORN 26.

22
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,412
WILL I BE
IN THE SAME GRADE?

23
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,122
OF COURSE.

24
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,332
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME THERE,
ONLY IT'S THREE HOURS EARLIER.

25
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,844
YOU'LL GRADUATE YOUNGER.

26
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:32,127
A GIRL I KNOW FROM CALIFORNIA
KNOWS HELEN REDDY'S DAUGHTER.

27
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,302
AFTER THIS PICTURE,
THEY'LL SAY,

28
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,301
THERE GOES TONY
DeFOREST'S DAUGHTER.

29
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,143
BUT HE'S NOT A STAR.
HE'S JUST AN ACTOR.

30
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,639
STARS HAVE TO BE
ACTORS FIRST.

31
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,642
HE'S NOT MY FATHER.

32
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,654
YOU'RE SUCH A STICKLER
FOR DETAILS.

33
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,146
CAN I SHOW TONY MY THINGS?

34
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,568
LATER. YOU HAVE HOMEWORK.

35
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,108
WE'RE MOVING
IN FOUR DAYS.

36
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,742
SUPPOSE BETWEEN NOW AND FRIDAY,

37
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,948
THEY TEACH BRAIN SURGERY.

38
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,198
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO MISS IT.

39
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,411
WE HAD IT LAST WEEK
IN SCIENCE.

40
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,792
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

41
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,078
DUMB. YOU'RE DUMB.

42
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,712
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IN FROG DISSECTION.

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,050
CAN I JUST SHOW HIM
MY NEW SWEATER?

44
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,218
OH, ALRIGHT.

45
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:23,386
BUT WASH YOUR FACE AND BRUSH
YOUR HAIR AND NO MAKE-UP.

46
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,482
TONY!
SWEETHEART?

47
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,609
YOU IN THE BATHROOM?

48
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:34,857
HEY, WE CLEANED OUT ALEXANDER'S!

49
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,612
WE BOUGHT EVERYTHING
ON SALE.

50
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,334
YOU BETTER LIKE IT
BECAUSE WE CAN'T EXCHANGE IT.

51
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,115
I BOUGHT YOU A PRESENT.

52
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,133
BABE?

53
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,634
COME OUT AND SEE.

54
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,127
BABE?

55
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,709
TONY?

56
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,224
OH.

57
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,668
OH, MY GOD!

58
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,003
WHAT HAPPENED?

59
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,011
HE'S...GONE.

60
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,836
HE LEFT WITHOUT US.

61
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,681
FOR CALIFORNIA?

62
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,467
FOR ITALY.

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,310
HUH? CAN I READ IT?

64
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,767
"DEAR PAULA, THIS ISN'T
AN EASY LETTER TO WRITE."

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,400
IT DOESN'T
START OFF TOO GOOD.

66
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,399
"WHERE IN THE HELL
DO I BEGIN?

67
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,741
YOU AND THE KID
MEAN A LOT TO ME."

68
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,816
THE KID?

69
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:07,374
"I TURNED DOWN THE JOB IN
L.A. IT WAS A LOUSY TV PICTURE.

70
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,711
"ON MONDAY,
STAN FIELDS CALLED.

71
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:14,667
"I GOT THE BERTO..

72
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
BERTOLUCCI.

73
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,089
"BERTOLUCCI PICTURE.

74
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,839
WHO'S BERTOLUCCI?

75
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,051
AN ITALIAN DIRECTOR.

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,340
WHAT DID HE DIRECT?

77
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:26,848
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING
QUESTIONS LIKE THAT NOW FOR?

78
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,889
"IT'S SIX MONTHS' SHOOTING
IN SPAIN AND ITALY.

79
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,232
"IT'S A HELL OF A PART,
I WANT IT. I BROKE MY ASS--

80
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,609
AH! GIVE ME THAT.

81
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,975
ASS. HEARD THE WORD BEFORE.

82
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,242
"I BROKE MY ASS
FOR 12 YEARS.

83
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,324
"THINGS ARE FINALLY
BEGINNING TO BREAK FOR ME.

84
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,739
"I TOLD YOU WHEN WE
FIRST MOVED IN HERE,

85
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,819
"THAT IT WAS NEVER
GOING TO BE PERMANENT.

86
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,544
CHRIST. I'M NOT EVEN
DIVORCED FROM PATTY YET."

87
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,785
WHO'S PATTY?

88
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,077
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER.

89
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,671
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

90
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,796
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE UPSET IF YOU KNEW

91
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,634
YOU WERE LIVING
WITH A MARRIED MAN.

92
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,879
I WASN'T. YOU WERE.
I WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM.

93
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,304
WELL, THEY WERE
PRACTICALLY DIVORCED.

94
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,814
"I LEFT EARLY TODAY BECAUSE I
DIDN'T WANT A GOOD-BYE SCENE.

95
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,895
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST LETTERS
I'VE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

96
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,727
ISN'T IT TERRIBLE?

97
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,034
OH!

98
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,116
"I WISH I HAD SOMETHING
TO LEAVE YOU AND THE KID."

99
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,124
HE DIDN'T
LEAVE US ANYTHING?

100
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,236
NO.

101
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,460
"HAD TO SELL MY WATCH AND CAMERA
TO PAY OFF THE LOAN SHARKS."

102
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,288
HE OWED MONEY
TO SHARKS?

103
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,963
I'LL EXPLAIN IT
SOME OTHER TIME.

104
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,592
"YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT.
YOU CAN GO BACK TO DANCING."

105
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,310
DANCING? I'M 33.
I CAN HARDLY WALK ANYMORE.

106
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:52,484
"I WISH BOTH OF US ALL THE LUCK
IN THE WORLD. LOVE TO THE KID."

107
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,936
DON'T READ ANY MORE.

108
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,436
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE WORD.

109
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,233
"TONY."

110
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,360
OH, THROW IT AWAY.

111
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,286
DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE NOT
GOING TO CALIFORNIA?

112
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,714
YEAH.

113
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:23,421
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO DO
MY HOMEWORK, RIGHT?

114
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,216
OH, LUCY.

115
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,969
AND 5 AND 6
AND 7 AND 8

116
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,892
AND 9, 10, 11, 12,

117
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,561
13, 14, 15, 16.

118
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,151
1 AND 2, 3,
AND 4 AND OVER.

119
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,478
2, 3, AND 4.

120
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,822
I SEE YOU, PAULA.
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME.

121
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,318
DOWN, UP, AND OVER.

122
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,527
2, 3, 4.
ONCE AGAIN.

123
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,831
MY GOD. WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TO YOUR BODY?

124
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,825
IT DIED. HAVE
A LITTLE RESPECT.

125
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:56,537
ONCE AGAIN. AND 1, 2, 3,
AND COME ON, PAULA. PUSH.

126
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,130
2, 3, AND 4 AND..

127
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,756
PAULA?

128
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,429
DONNA.

129
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,258
DONNA DOUGLAS.

130
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,773
I WORKED WITH YOU
IN COMPANY.

131
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,845
OH, YES.
HELLO, DONNA.

132
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,272
TOUGH GETTING BACK
INTO SHAPE, HUH?

133
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,271
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS.

134
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,693
IT'S AMAZING HOW FLABBY
YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY.

135
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,494
HI, MRS. CROSBY.

136
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,871
YOU LEAVING TONIGHT?

137
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,959
WHAT WAS THAT?

138
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,044
WHEN ARE YOU VACATING?

139
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,210
WE'RE NOT GOING TO CALIFORNIA.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

140
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,671
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
YOU FORGOT TO TELL.

141
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,921
THAT APARTMENT'S BEEN SUBLET.

142
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,173
WAIT A MINUTE!

143
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,434
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

144
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,046
WE'RE PAID UP THROUGH JUNE.
WE HAVE THREE MORE MONTHS.

145
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,104
YOU CAN'T SUBLET
THAT APARTMENT.

146
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,057
I'M NOT.
YOUR YOUNG MAN DID.

147
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,059
HE SUBLET
OUR APARTMENT?

148
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,402
HE NOTIFIED ME LAST NIGHT.

149
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,436
HIS NAME WAS ON THE LEASE,
HE COULD DO WHAT HE WANTS.

150
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,401
YOU LEAVE IT LIKE YOU FOUND IT.

151
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,451
I'M NOT LEAVING IT. I CLEANED
AND PAINTED AND DECORATED IT.

152
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,617
IT'S MINE. I'M NOT GETTING OUT.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

153
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,328
THAT'S NONE OF
MY BUSINESS, HONEY.

154
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,619
YOU CAN TAKE THAT UP
WITH THE SUBLETEE.

155
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,793
I JUST DON'T WANT NO
TROUBLE IN MY BUILDING.

156
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:28,803
OH, THAT...BASTARD!
THAT NO-GOOD BASTARD.

157
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,139
MM-HMM.

158
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,400
WHO'S THAT?

159
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,654
I DON'T KNOW.

160
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,242
MAYBE IT'S TONY. MAYBE HE
CHANGED HIS MIND AND CAME BACK.

161
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,239
YOU'RE SO YOUNG.

162
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,754
STAY THERE.

163
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,925
WHO IS IT?

164
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,255
ELLIOT GARFIELD.

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,430
WHO?

166
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,138
ELLIOT GARFIELD
FROM CHICAGO. IS TONY IN?

167
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,519
THERE'S NOBODY
BY THAT NAME HERE.

168
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,728
WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

169
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,450
3-A. IT'S THE RIGHT APARTMENT.
I WAS HERE ONCE TWO YEARS AGO.

170
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,987
I DON'T CARE. THERE'S
NO WHAT'S-HIS-NAME HERE.

171
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,543
COULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR
FOR ONE SECOND?

172
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,168
NOT AT 12:05.

173
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,794
OH, JESUS. YOU GOT
A LATCH. KEEP IT ON.

174
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,632
I'LL JUST TALK
FOR ONE SECOND.

175
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,973
MAKE IT FAST.
MY HUSBAND IS SLEEPING.

176
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,887
I THINK THERE'S BEEN
SOME KINDA MISTAKE.

177
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,505
I SUBLET THIS APARTMENT
FROM A FRIEND, TONY DeFOREST.

178
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,563
HE LIVES HERE.

179
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,476
THAT'LL BE NEWS
TO MY HUSBAND CHARLIE.

180
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,274
I HAVE A RECEIPT FOR
THREE MONTHS' RENT.

181
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,269
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO ARRIVE TOMORROW,

182
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,361
BUT I CAME IN EARLY BECAUSE I'M
STARTING WORK IN THE MORNING.

183
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,897
I FIGURED I COULD SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE. SEE.

184
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,412
YOU LOOK CONFUSED. CAN
I TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND?

185
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,275
HE'LL BE AT THE 37th PRECINCT
AT 9 IN THE MORNING.

186
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,993
CHARLIE DAGASTINO,
HOMICIDE. GOODNIGHT.

187
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,672
WHO WAS IT?

188
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,841
NEVER MIND.

189
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,089
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE
A "NEVER MIND" TO ME.

190
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,261
TONY RENTED THE
APARTMENT TO SOMEONE,

191
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,970
BUT I'M NOT GIVING IT UP.
IT'S OURS. GO TO SLEEP.

192
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,892
HE RENTED THE APARTMENT?
WE HAVE TO LEAVE?

193
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,392
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

194
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,943
WHAT IF THEY FORCE US?

195
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,606
LET 'EM TRY.
GO TO SLEEP.

196
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,436
HE RENTED THE APARTMENT.
WHAT A SHITHEAD.

197
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,713
HELLO.

198
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,093
IS TONY THERE PLEASE?

199
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,929
WHO'S CALLING?

200
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,795
I WAS JUST UP THERE.

201
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,101
I RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE,
MRS. DAGASTINO.

202
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,305
MRS. WHO?

203
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,515
DAGASTINO.

204
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,885
HOW COME YOUR TELEPHONE ANSWERS
TO TONY DeFOREST'S NUMBER?

205
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,983
AND HOW COME THE KEY HE SENT ME,
AIR MAIL SPECIAL DELIVERY,

206
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,149
OPENS YOUR DOOR, HUH? HUH?

207
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,319
YOU WANT TO ANSWER THOSE
QUESTIONS, MRS. DAGASTINO?

208
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,858
NO! WHY DON'T YOU
ANSWER THEM?

209
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,702
I THINK THE ANSWER IS
SOMETHING FISHY IS GOING ON.

210
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,448
I'M WET AS A HERRING,
WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS.

211
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,791
AND I DON'T HAVE A PLACE
TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

212
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,247
AND I DON'T WANT TO BLOW
MY LAST FEW BUCKS ON A HOTEL.

213
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:18,959
ACCORDING TO MY NONWATERPROOF
WATCH, IT'S AT LEAST 12:20.

214
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,094
AND TECHNICALLY, THAT APARTMENT
BELONGS TO ME.

215
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,931
DO I COME UP THERE NOW
AND WE DISCUSS THIS AMICABLY

216
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,257
OR DO I STORM THE PLACE
IN THE MORNING?

217
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,563
I'VE GOT A GUN.
I'LL USE IT IF I HAVE TO.

218
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,935
CHANGE?
GOT CHANGE FOR A DOLLAR?

219
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,204
I GOT A PREGNANT WIFE IN
THE LOBBY! I JUST WANT CHA--

220
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,075
WE'RE IN TROUBLE, RIGHT?

221
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,536
WE'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

222
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,206
WE HAVE OUR RIGHTS.
POSSESSION IS 9/10ths OF LAW.

223
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,326
WHAT'S THE OTHER 10th?

224
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,422
SHUT UP.

225
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,626
IS THAT THE LAST 10th?

226
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,719
GO TO BED. I WILL HANDLE THIS.

227
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,058
HELLO.

228
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,684
JUST CALLED THE 37th PRECINCT.
THERE'S NO CHARLES DAGASTINO.

229
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,522
THEN I CALLED RITA SCOTT,
AN OLD ACTRESS FRIEND OF MINE.

230
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,558
WHO WAS IN MERCHANT OF VENICE
THIS YEAR WITH TONY DeFOREST.

231
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,153
RITA TOLD ME ALL ABOUT
THIS GIRL TONY'S LIVING WITH.

232
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,359
A CERTAIN PAULA MCFADDEN AND
HER TEN-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, LUCY.

233
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,240
SHE ALSO TOLD ME THE APARTMENT
IS LEASED TO TONY DeFOREST.

234
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:31,038
SHE KNOWS THIS FOR A FACT.
SHE USED TO LIVE WITH HIM.

235
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:35,246
CAN WE CONTINUE THIS
CONVERSATION IN A DRIER ROOM?

236
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,838
YOU GOT PROBLEMS? TAKE IT UP
WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY.

237
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,014
DON'T HANG UP! PLEASE.
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE CHANGE.

238
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,925
I'M SOAKED, AND I HAVE
A LOW THRESHOLD FOR DISEASE.

239
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:52,425
TONY'S GOT MY MONEY, AND I GOT A
LEASE, YOU GOT THE APARTMENT.

240
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,982
NOW ONE OF US GOT SCREWED.
UH, LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

241
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,518
WE HAVE TO
TALK THIS OUT.

242
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,861
I'M IN NO CONDITION,
FINANCIAL OR HEALTHWISE,

243
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,067
TO LOOK FOR A HOTEL
IN THE RAIN.

244
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,198
IF THERE'S ANYTHING LIKE THE
78th-STREET FLU, I'VE GOT IT.

245
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,486
TAKE A SHOT
IN A CONVENIENT PLACE.

246
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,790
FIVE MINUTES! THAT'S
ALL I'M ASKING. WHAT IS IT?

247
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,535
IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS,
WE'RE GOING TO GET CUT OFF.

248
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,867
MY NUMBER IS 873-5261.

249
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,923
IT'S A FLOODED BOOTH
ON AMSTERDAM AVENUE.

250
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,877
IF YOU HAVE ANY COMPASSION
IN YOUR HEART WHATSOEVER--

251
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,338
I'M TRYING TO
WORK IT OUT, OPERATOR!

252
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,379
CALL ME BACK.
873-5261.

253
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,513
THAT NUMBER AGAIN--
OH, SHIT!

254
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,435
HELLO. THANK YOU.

255
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,451
FIVE MINUTES.
LEAVE YOUR BAGS.

256
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,164
THIS ISN'T A
PERMANENT CONVERSATION.

257
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,043
I'M DRIPPING ON YOUR RUG.

258
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,327
IT'S BEEN DRIPPED ON BEFORE.

259
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,500
I'M SORRY' BOUT THIS. I DIDN'T
KNOW THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS.

260
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,130
THERE'S A LOT
OF THAT AROUND.

261
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,337
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING
HOSTILE, I GET THE PICTURE.

262
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,418
TONY RENTED ME
THE APARTMENT AND SPLIT.

263
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,764
THEN YOU AND YOUR
DAUGHTER GOT DUMPED ON.

264
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,770
YOUR VERSION. MY VERSION IS WE
AMICABLY ENDED OUR RELATIONSHIP.

265
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,774
WE AGREED I WOULD
KEEP THE APARTMENT.

266
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,646
YOU AND YOUR $600 GOT DUMPED ON.
GET THE PICTURE.

267
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,114
VERY SHARP. SHARP. YOU'RE A
SHARP NEW YORK GIRL, RIGHT?

268
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,067
NO, A DULL
CINCINNATI KID.

269
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,697
BUT YOU GET DUMPED ON ENOUGH,
YOU DEVELOP AN EDGE.

270
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:33,695
OKAY. SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?
I GOT A LEASE HERE IN MY POCKET.

271
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,370
YOU GOING TO HONOR IT?

272
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,618
I GOT A DAUGHTER IN MY BED
THAT TOPS A LEASE.

273
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,291
I DON'T WANT TO GET LEGAL.
LEGAL HAPPENS TO BE ON MY SIDE.

274
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,462
I HAPPEN TO HAVE A LAWYER
ACQUAINTANCE DOWNTOWN.

275
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,462
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS CALL HIM.

276
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,884
OH!

277
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,342
WOAH, WOAH. WHAT?

278
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,100
AN ACTOR...ANOTHER
GODDAMN ACTOR.

279
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,476
"I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A LAWYER ACQUAINTANCE?"

280
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,648
RIGHT OUT OF
STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.

281
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,726
STANLEY KOWALSKI
IN SUMMER STOCK. RIGHT?

282
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,493
WRONG. CHICAGO IN WINTER. 3 1/2
MONTHS AT DRURY LANE THEATER.

283
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,067
ASK AN ACTOR A QUESTION,
HE GIVES YOU HIS CREDITS.

284
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,282
WANNA HEAR REVIEWS, "ELLIOT
GARFIELD BRINGS TO KOWALSKI

285
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,663
DIMENSIONS THAT EVEN BRANDO
HAD NOT INVESTIGATED."

286
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,290
TERRIFIC,
YOU WRITE BEAUTIFULLY.

287
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,168
AREN'T YOU TOO SHORT
TO PLAY STANLEY?

288
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,335
NOBODY NOTICED I STOOD ON THE
POKER TABLE. ARE YOU A CRITIC?

289
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,795
NO, I LOVE ACTORS. AS LONG AS
THEY STAY ON STAGE.

290
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,047
PUT THEM IN REAL LIFE,
AND THE WORLD GETS SCREWED UP.

291
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,220
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

292
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,019
I AM NOT GETTING KICKED OUT OF
THE SAME LOUSY APARTMENT TWICE.

293
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,524
YOU WANT YOUR MONEY
BACK, GO TO NAPLES.

294
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,847
YOU WANT THIS APARTMENT, BUY ME
TWO TICKETS TO CALIFORNIA.

295
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,903
I'LL GIVE TWO MINUTES
TO THINK IT OVER

296
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,107
BEFORE I YELL RAPE.

297
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,436
YOU ARE REALLY SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW THAT.

298
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,823
I'M SURPRISED TONY DIDN'T TAKE
A JOB IN PHILIPPINES.

299
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,201
I HOPE YOU ARE THINKING
'CAUSE I AM COUNTING.

300
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,538
WAIT A SECOND. HOLD IT.
CAN WE MAKE A DEAL?

301
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,786
WHAT KIND OF DEAL?

302
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,077
DON'T KNOW. CAN I
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE?

303
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,671
NO.

304
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,246
OH, DON'T BE BASHFUL.

305
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,211
OKAY. ALRIGHT.
HERE IS THE SITUATION.

306
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,423
I KNOW THE SITUATION.

307
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,633
LET ME JUST SAY IT.

308
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,474
NUMBER ONE, I HAVE A JOB
OFF-BROADWAY, NO PLACE TO SLEEP.

309
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,060
NUMBER TWO. YOU DON'T HAVE
MONEY. BUT YOU GOT MY APARTMENT.

310
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,637
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER TO THINK
ABOUT. I AM THINKING OF HER.

311
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,114
DO ME THE COURTESY
OF HEARING ME OUT. PLEASE.

312
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,526
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SCREAM RAPE, YOU KNOW.

313
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,316
WE ARE BOTH IN A BIND.
THE TWO OF US.

314
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,491
THE ONLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION
IS WE SHARE THE APARTMENT.

315
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,491
I ACCEPT.

316
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,492
WHAT?

317
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,583
I ACCEPT. I MAY BE STUBBORN
BUT I'M NOT STUPID.

318
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,250
MEAN IT?

319
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,918
MY DAUGHTER GOES TO SCHOOL.

320
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,836
I HAVE TO LOOK FOR A JOB.
YOU HAVE A KEY.

321
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,166
I WOULD HAVE TO STAND GUARD
ALL DAY LONG TO KEEP YOU OUT.

322
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,092
I ACCEPT. YOU WIN. YOU GET
THE SMALL BEDROOM.

323
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,813
WHAT THE HELL
AM I GETTING MYSELF INTO?

324
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,936
I'M IN THE WRONG ROOM.

325
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,109
HI. I'M ELLIOT.

326
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,027
HELLO.

327
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,316
YOU MUST BE LUCY.

328
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:15,609
THAT'S RIGHT.

329
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,282
ELLIOT GARFIELD. I'M MOVING
INTO THE OTHER ROOM.

330
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:23,702
I'M A FRIEND OF TONY'S.
YOU KNOW, TONY DeFOREST.

331
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,713
THAT'S NICE.

332
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,455
I'M AN ACTOR, TOO.

333
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,207
YEAH?

334
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,628
WELL, YOUR MOTHER KNOWS.

335
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,127
I SEE.

336
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:38,342
WELL...GUESS I'LL
BE SEEING YOU AROUND.

337
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,513
I GUESS SO.

338
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,760
TOODLE-OO.

339
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,780
GOODNIGHT.

340
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,275
JESUS.

341
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,368
I JUST MET LUCY.

342
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,776
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

343
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,834
THAT I WAS MOVING
INTO THE OTHER ROOM.

344
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,827
SHE SEEMED TO TAKE IT
IN STRIDE.

345
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,829
YOU GROW UP FAST
IN THIS APARTMENT.

346
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,421
THE JOHN IS RIGHT
OVER THERE.

347
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,666
I'LL GET THE REST OF HER
THINGS OUT IN THE MORNING.

348
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,800
WOULD YOU LIKE TO STOP
GRINDING YOUR TEETH?

349
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,337
THE NOISE
IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

350
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,551
A DRIPPING STRANGER
FROM CHICAGO

351
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,511
WITH A WET BEARD AND DIRTY SHOES
MOVES INTO MY DAUGHTER'S ROOM,

352
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,684
AND YOU EXPECT SMILES?

353
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,852
I THINK YOU'RE DYNAMITE.

354
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,639
I LOVE LISTENING TO YOU TALK.
I HATE LIVING WITH YOU,

355
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,234
YOUR CONVERSATION IS
FIRST-CLASS.

356
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:36,189
THIS IS YOUR ROOM.
I DO NOT CLEAN OR MAKE BEDS.

357
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,822
USE THE KITCHEN OR THE BATHROOM
WHEN I AM NOT IN IT.

358
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,822
WASH IT UP
WHEN YOU ARE THROUGH.

359
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:47,414
YOU PAY FOR YOUR FOOD, LAUNDRY,
LINENS, AND PHONE BILLS.

360
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,002
I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME QUIET
BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9:00.

361
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,419
AS THAT IS WHEN
LUCY DOES HER HOMEWORK.

362
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:59,218
DON'T SMOKE GRASS IN FRONT
OF MY 10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

363
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,255
DO WE HAVE EVERYTHING STRAIGHT?

364
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,258
NO.

365
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,339
NO?

366
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,433
NO.

367
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,428
I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS.

368
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,510
YOU'RE NOT?

369
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,564
I'M PAYING THE RENT.

370
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,557
I MAKE THE RULES.

371
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:14,519
I DON'T LIKE PANTIES
DRYING ON THE ROD.

372
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,152
I WILL USE THE KITCHEN
WHENEVER I DAMN WELL PLEASE.

373
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,700
AND I AM VERY PARTICULAR
ABOUT MY CONDIMENTS.

374
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,986
I PLAY THE GUITAR DURING THE
NIGHT WHENEVER I CANNOT SLEEP.

375
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,411
AND I MEDITATE EVERY MORNING.
COMPLETE WITH CHANTING.

376
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,660
IF YOU'VE GOT TO WALK AROUND,
I'D APPRECIATE TIPTOEING.

377
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,543
ALSO I SLEEP IN THE NUDE,

378
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,422
WINTER AND SUMMER, RAIN OR SNOW,
WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN.

379
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,511
AND BECAUSE I MAY GO
TO THE POTTY OR TO THE FRIDGE

380
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:46,097
DURING THE NIGHT, AND I DON'T
WANT TO PUT ON JAMMIES

381
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,425
UNLESS YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A QUICK THRILL,

382
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,431
I WOULD KEEP
MY DOOR CLOSED.

383
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,063
THEM'S MY RULES AND REGULATIONS.
HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU.

384
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,191
IF I SAY NO?

385
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,357
I GOT THIS LAWYER ACQUAINTANCE.

386
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,364
I ACCEPT. I DON'T LIKE IT.
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

387
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,108
BECAUSE I'M AN ACTOR?

388
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,860
COUPLED WITH YOUR PERSONALITY.

389
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,532
ONE OF GOD'S LITTLE JESTS.

390
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,871
IF YOU'LL MOVE YOUR SHAPELY
FANNY OUT OF MY ROOM,

391
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,868
I WILL UNPACK
AND DRY MY BEARD.

392
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,921
YOU FORGOT TO SAY GOODNIGHT.

393
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,955
I WAS WORKING ON GOODBYE.

394
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,088
UNBELIEVABLE.

395
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,876
HOW LONG
IS HE GONNA STAY?

396
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,300
AS LONG
AS HE LETS US.

397
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,678
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

398
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,887
I DON'T HAVE TO.

399
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,387
WELL, THEN SAVE IT
TILL MORNING.

400
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,940
IT'S NOT SAFE
OUT THERE.

401
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,321
GOODNIGHT.

402
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,397
NO KISS?

403
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,451
I'M ANGRY.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT.

404
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,257
OH, CHRIST.

405
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,678
LISTEN TO THAT.
DID THAT GUITAR WAKE YOU?

406
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,508
NO, YOU DID.

407
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,354
OH, SORRY.

408
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,190
IS HE GOING TO PLAY
THAT THING ALL NIGHT?

409
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,147
PUT A PILLOW OVER YOUR EAR.

410
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,068
OH, MOTHER.

411
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,396
IT'S BETTER
THAN THAT GUITAR.

412
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,703
WHO IS IT?

413
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,163
MAY I COME IN?

414
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,163
DOOR IS OPEN.

415
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,174
ARE YOU DECENT?

416
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,625
I AM DECENT.

417
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,125
IT IS 3:00 IN THE--

418
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,588
JESUS CHRIST!
YOU'RE NAKED.

419
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,590
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE DECENT.

420
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:50,552
I AM DECENT. I ALSO
HAPPEN TO BE NAKED.

421
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,020
MR. GARFIELD, I HAVE
A GROWING DAUGHTER INSIDE

422
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,808
WHO IS NOT GOING TO GROW
ON TWO HOURS OF SLEEP.

423
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,822
MUST YOU PLAY THAT?

424
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,784
IT HELPS ME FALL ASLEEP.

425
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,904
HAVE YOU TRIED PILLS?

426
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,032
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY PILLS.

427
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,529
YOU POP THEM IN YOUR
MOUTH AND SWALLOW.

428
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,412
I DO NOT USE
UNNATURAL THINGS.

429
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,410
MUSIC IS A NATURAL
SEDATIVE.

430
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:20,382
IF YOU'D LISTEN TO IT,
WE WOULD ALL BE ASLEEP SOON.

431
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,714
HOWEVER, IF YOU INSIST, STICK A
SLEEPING PILL IN EACH EAR.

432
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,050
HE WON'T STOP!

433
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:36,984
I HAVE A LAWYER ACQUAINTANCE,
TOO, I CAN GET.

434
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,558
JUST TAKE DEEP BREATHS.

435
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,612
COUNT TO 100.

436
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:50,155
I'M SORRY, BABY.

437
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:55,164
I AM REALLY SORRY I GOT YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS MESS.

438
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,119
LUCE?

439
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,116
LUCE?

440
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,208
OHMMM...

441
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,763
OHMMM...

442
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,061
WHAT'S THAT?

443
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,768
OHMMM...

444
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,058
IT SOUNDS LIKE GOD.

445
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,065
OH.

446
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,645
OHMMM...

447
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,822
OH! FIVE TO 6:00.

448
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,371
BOY, GOD GETS UP
EARLY.

449
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,075
OHMMM...

450
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,576
I SMELL
STRAWBERRIES BURNING.

451
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,078
THAT IS INCENSE.

452
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,580
WHAT'S INCENSE?

453
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,671
IT IS WHAT I'M
FEELING RIGHT NOW.

454
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,797
OHMMM...

455
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,841
OHMMM...

456
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,057
OHMMM...

457
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:07,112
OHMMM...

458
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,356
YOU KNOW IT'S
FIVE TO 6:00?

459
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,898
OHMMM...

460
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,862
IN THE MORNING.

461
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,203
OHMMM...

462
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,963
ISN'T THERE A CHURCH
WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT?

463
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,286
OHMMM...

464
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,514
OHMMM...

465
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,560
YOU FINISHED.
IS THAT THE LAST CHORUS?

466
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,234
I'M IN A BLISSFUL STATE.
DON'T BUG ME.

467
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:47,064
IS THIS ROUTINE? GUITARS AT
NIGHT, HUMMING IN THE MORNING?

468
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,733
MOST MUSICALS
HAVE LESS MUSIC.

469
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,612
MISS McFADDEN...

470
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:58,072
TODAY I START REHEARSALS
FOR MY FIRST NEW YORK PLAY,

471
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,494
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
DAY OF MY LIFE.

472
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,664
AM I NERVOUS?

473
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,712
NO, I AM
NOT NERVOUS.

474
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,127
BECAUSE I HAVE MEDITATED,
I AM RELAXED,

475
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,627
I AM CALM,

476
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,380
I AM CONFIDENT.

477
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,223
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
HAVE NOT MEDITATED.

478
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:22,639
THEREFORE, YOU ARE
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

479
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,030
TODAY HAPPENS TO BE
AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ME, TOO.

480
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,906
I AM AUDITIONING FOR
A NEW MUSICAL TODAY.

481
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,655
I SLEPT 17 MINUTES LAST NIGHT,
THANKS TO YOU.

482
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,999
WITH THE BAGS I HAVE
UNDER MY EYES,

483
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:49,044
I DON'T HAVE MUCH
OF A CHANCE.

484
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,631
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

485
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,166
UH-HUH.

486
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,759
WHAT IS THAT SLOP
IN MY DISHES?

487
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:59,175
GRANOLA, WHEAT GERM, SOYA,
LECITHIN, NATURAL HONEY.

488
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,716
MY BODY IS A TEMPLE
WHICH I WORSHIP.

489
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,770
IT'S WHAT GIVES ME
MY NATURAL DISPOSITION.

490
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:10,146
I'M 63 YEARS OLD. LOOK AT ME.
CAN I FIX YOU A BOWL?

491
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,686
THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

492
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,360
I REALLY DON'T YOU
WELL ENOUGH TO DISLIKE YOU,

493
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,860
BUT YOU ARE TOO WEIRD
TO LIVE WITH.

494
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,953
TRY TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE,
AND I WILL RETURN THE $600.

495
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:30,118
YOU FORGET YOU ARE LIVING HERE
ON AN ELLIOT GARFIELD GRANT.

496
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,504
TRY THIS.
IT'S GOT BRAN IN IT.

497
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,461
YOUR PROBLEM STEMS
FROM IRREGULARITY.

498
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,297
OKAY. LET'S TAKE IT
FROM THE TOP.

499
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,971
UP TO TEMPO.

500
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,759
5, 6, 7, 8.

501
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,392
1, 2, 3, 4.

502
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,389
TOUCH, TRAP,
STEP, STEP.

503
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,141
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

504
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,023
UP, UP. TOGETHER.

505
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,770
STEP, KICK, KICK,

506
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,401
4, 5, 6, HOLD, 7.

507
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,648
KICK, CROSS TOGETHER,
CROSS TOGETHER.

508
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,150
5, 6, 7, AND 8.

509
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,152
KICK, KICK.
STEP, DRAG.

510
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,784
5, 6, 7, 8.

511
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,700

00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,425
OH. OH, MY GOD.
YOU SCARED ME.

519
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,425
I THOUGHT
IT WAS MY TURN.

HOW YOU FEEL?

527
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:39,936
SO OLD.

528
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,534

00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,628
RONNIE BURNS.

538
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,433
RONNIE, HELLO!

00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,596

00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,095
I DID, BUT

JUST A MINUTE, PLEASE.

570
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,838
OKAY. ROBERT AND CYNTHIA,
PLEASE WAIT.

571
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,876
THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING IN.

572
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,715
A LITTLE RUSTY,
BUT NOT BAD.

573
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,849
MY PROBLEM IS I NEED
THEM VERY YOUNG.

574
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,806
YOUNG?
I'LL WORK ON IT.

575
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,980
NEXT GROUP, PLEASE.

576
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,361
WHAT ABOUT RICHARD?

577
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,855
THE QUESTION
MAY SEEM PERFUNCTORY,

578
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,898
BUT WAS RICHARD
ACTUALLY DEFORMED?

579
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,913
HE WAS BORN WITH
CURVATURE OF THE SPINE,

580
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,697
GIVING THE IMPRESSION
HE WAS HUNCHBACKED.

581
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,081
HE HAD SOME PARALYSIS,
LEFT HAND AND RIGHT FOOT.

582
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,540
OLIVIER PLAYED IT
RIGHT HAND AND LEFT FOOT.

583
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,921
HE ALSO HAD NERVE DAMAGE
TO THE RIGHT CHEEK.

584
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,721
THE MAN WAS
YOUR BASIC GIMP.

585
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,335
ALL OF WHICH BRINGS US,
BLESS THE WISE AND RICH

586
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:14,933
MRS. ESTELLE MORGENBEIS,
TO THIS PRODUCTION.

587
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,892
IS THAT THE WAY
WE WANT TO PLAY RICHARD?

588
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,363
IF SO, THEN I'D
RATHER DO A STINT

589
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,725
WITH SONNY AND CHER SHOW.

590
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,903
RICHARD III
WAS A FLAMING HOMOSEXUAL.

591
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:31,072
SO WAS SHAKESPEARE, BUT
THAT MOB AT THE GLOBE THEATER

592
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,163
WOULDN'T PLUNK DOWN
2 SHILLINGS

593
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:37,408
TO SEE A BUNCH OF PANSIES
ONSTAGE.

594
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,923
SOCIETY CRIPPLED RICHARD,
NOT CHILDBIRTH.

595
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,916
READ YOUR TEXT.

596
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,798
HE SENT THOSE TWO BOYS
TO THE TOWER,

597
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,426
AND NOBODY
SAW THEM AGAIN.

598
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:53,795
I WANT TO STRIP RICHARD BARE
METAPHORICALLY.

599
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,934
LET'S GET RID OF
THE DEFORMITIES

600
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:01,102
AND SHOW HIM
AS HE WOULD BE TODAY:

601
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,443
THE QUEEN
WHO WANTED TO BE KING.

602
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,400
YES?

603
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,399
QUESTION.

604
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,525
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

605
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,608
WHAT'S THE OBJECTION,
ELLIOT?

606
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,953
NUMBER ONE I HAVE
TO PLAY IT.

607
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,949
NUMBER TWO I LIKE
THE DEFORMITIES.

608
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,121
NUMBER THREE I'VE BEEN
REHEARSING THE PART

609
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,960
FOR THREE MONTHS.

610
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,955
WELL, I RESPECT THAT,

611
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,957
AND WE'RE HERE
TO EXCHANGE IDEAS.

612
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,460
HOW DO YOU SEE RICHARD?

613
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,473
MR. MACHO?
IS THAT IT?

614
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,466
HE ISN'T A LINEBACKER
FOR THE CHICAGO BEARS,

615
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,970
BUT DON'T THROW AWAY
HIS PRIME MOTIVATION.

616
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,313
WHAT'S THAT?

617
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,978
HE WANTS TO HUMP
LADY ANNE.

618
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:46,897
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.
JUST TRY IT MY WAY.

619
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,899
LET'S READ THROUGH
THE FIRST ACT.

620
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,611
PLEASE, TRUST ME.
TRUST ME.

621
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,332
ACT ONE.

622
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,999
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

623
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,577
SORRY.

624
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:09,048
HOW FAR OFF THE BOARD
SHOULD I JUMP?

625
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,166
DON'T GIVE ME
BETTE MIDLER,

626
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,803
BUT LET'S NOT BE
AFRAID TO BE BOLD.

627
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,471
BOLD?

628
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,009
BOLD.

629
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,136
ACT ONE, SCENE ONE.

630
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,022
ENTER RICHARD,
DUKE OF GLOUCESTER.

631
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,490
NOW IS THE WINTER
OF OUR DISCONTENT--

632
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,525
SORRY, SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

633
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,041
NOW IS THE WINTER...

634
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,389
NOW IS THE WINTER

635
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,386
OF OUR DISCONTENT--
MAY I HAVE A BREAK?

636
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,729
FIVE MINUTES.

637
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,194
FIVE-MINUTE BREAK,
EVERYBODY.

638
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,935
39...

639
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,534
OH, MY GOD.

640
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,778
40.

641
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,203
OH!

642
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,961
OH! THAT'S ALL?
I CAN'T DO ANY MORE?

643
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,285
60. YOU SAID 60.

644
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,462
NO. THE MUSCLES ARE GONE.

645
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,960
I CAN'T DANCE.
IT WAS A DUMB IDEA.

646
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,304
I AM GOING TO PUT YOU
UP FOR ADOPTION.

647
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:38,471
OH!

648
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,508
GET YOUR OLD MOTHER A COKE.

649
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,562
MM-MM. FATTENING.

650
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,806
UH!

651
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,057
GET ME THE COKE.

652
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,309
MOTHER DOESN'T WANT TO
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU.

653
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,613
NO WILLPOWER.

654
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,566
OH!

655
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,239
I'VE DIED.

656
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,817
OH!

657
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,122
I'VE TRULY DIED.

658
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,406
ENTER, SWEET ANNE.

659
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,083
YOU LIVE ALONE?

660
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,170
YEAH.

661
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,285
THE OTHER PEOPLE HERE
ALSO LIVE ALONE.

662
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,673
HERE, LET ME
TAKE YOUR COAT.

663
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,893
LUCY, THIS IS RHONDA.

664
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,887
RHONDA, LUCY.
LUCY, RHONDA.

665
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,389
HELLO.

666
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,640
HI.

667
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:27,892
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

668
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,903
SITTING ON MY MOTHER.

669
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,395
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

670
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,896
RHONDA AND I WILL BE
WORKING IN MY BEDROOM.

671
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,780
GOODNIGHT.

672
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:36,736
GOODNIGHT.

673
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,913
I'LL BET.

674
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,420
I HEARD VOICES.
WAS THAT HIM?

675
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,418
UH-HUH.
HE TOOK TWO APPLES.

676
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,420
DID YOU WRITE IT DOWN?

677
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,472
I DIDN'T HAVE
A PENCIL.

678
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,506
I TOLD YOU
TO WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN.

679
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,851
WE'RE NOT RUNNING
A HOTEL.

680
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,348
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE HIM?

681
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,851
WHO INVITED HIM? THAT'S WHY.

682
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,363
IF HE WERE A LAWYER,
WOULD YOU LIKE HIM?

683
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,357
I WOULDN'T LIKE HIM
IF I LIKED HIM.

684
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,110
HE GRATES ON ME.

685
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,743
HE'S CUTE.

686
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,369
HE'S LIKE A DOG
NOBODY WANTS.

687
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,117
YOU ARE NEVER
TO THINK HE IS CUTE. NEVER.

688
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,120
WHY DID HE WANT
TWO APPLES?

689
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,372
ONE FOR HIM. ONE FOR HER.

690
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,594
WHAT HER?

691
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,754
THE GIRL IN THERE.

692
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,263
A GIRL
IN THE BEDROOM?

693
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,756
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

694
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,348
SHOULD I WRITE
GIRLS DOWN, TOO?

695
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,345
YOU KNOCKED?

696
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,443
LET'S TALK IN PRIVATE.

697
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,858
IT'S A BAD TIME.
HOW BOUT AT BREAKFAST.

698
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,778
IS THAT A GIRL IN THERE?

699
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,777
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

700
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,779
I WON'T PUT UP
WITH THIS.

701
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,412
WITH WHAT? THERE'S A GIRL
IN YOUR BEDROOM.

702
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,580
RHONDA, PAULA McFADDEN,
THIS IS RHONDA FONTANA,

703
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,291
A GIFTED AND RISING YOUNG
ACTRESS. DON'T RISE.

704
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,292
HI.

705
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,754
HELLO.

706
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,304
CAN WE TALK?
THIS IS SERIOUS.

707
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,297
TAKE A BREAK.

708
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,268
OUT.
OUT?

709
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,274
HER OUT.
THEY HAVE MOTELS FOR THAT.

710
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,347
I HAVE AN IMPRESSIONABLE
10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

711
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,562
THIS IS NOT AN IMPRESSION
I WANT HER PICKING UP.

712
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:42,534
NOW GET THAT RISING YOUNG
ACTRESS THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

713
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:47,407
OUT OF MY RENTED APARTMENT
THAT YOU ARE STAYING?

714
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,737
I WILL BRING HOME ANYONE
OR ANYTHING I CHOOSE,

715
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,794
INCLUDING
A ONE-EYED KANGAROO

716
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,748
IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE
MY KINKY INCLINATION.

717
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,339
AS FOR WHAT IS GOIN ON IN THERE,
WE'RE REHEARSING RICHARD III.

718
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,126
I HAPPEN TO HAVE A CRETIN FROM
MARS DIRECTING THIS PLAY.

719
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,221
HOWEVER, IF I ATTEMPT
TO HAVE CARNAL KNOWLEDGE

720
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,678
OF THAT GORGEOUS BOD,
THAT'S HER OPTION, MY PROBLEM,

721
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,428
AND NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

722
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,021
WHAT WAS LUCY'S IMPRESSION

723
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,097
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON
IN MAMA'S BEDROOM

724
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,983
WITH TONY "LOVE 'EM AND
LEAVE 'EM" DeFOREST?

725
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,981
MAC, TURN OUT
SOME LIGHTS.

726
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,613
WE'RE RUNNING UP
A HECK OF A BILL.

727
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,080
YOU OKAY?

728
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,749
I'M FINE.
LET'S GO TO SLEEP.

729
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,249
ARE YOU UPSET BECAUSE
THEY'RE MESSING AROUND?

730
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,763
THEY ARE NOT
MESSING AROUND.

731
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,295
THEY ARE REHEARSING
RICHARD III.

732
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:54,387
LUCE, DID IT EVER BOTHER YOU
ABOUT TONY AND ME?

733
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,561
I MEAN, NOT BEING MARRIED
AND LIVING TOGETHER?

734
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,061
NO.

735
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,612
I WANTED TO GET MARRIED.

736
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,275
HE COULDN'T
GET A DIVORCE.

737
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,275
THAT'S OKAY.

738
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:09,317
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
HOW YOU FELT.

739
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,328
UH...SOCKS IN THE HAMPER,
PLEASE.

740
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,378
IS THAT SONG FROM RICHARD III?

741
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,996
LET'S BRUSH OUR TEETH.

742
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,925
OH, GOD, PLEASE
LET ME BE HIT

743
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,926
BY A RICH MAN
IN A ROLLS ROYCE.

744
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,349
I THINK I CAN SWING THAT.

745
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,058
THANK YOU.

746
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,058
NO, I MEAN IT.

747
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,110
IT'S FUNNY YOU
SHOULD SAY THAT.

748
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,774
WHAT DID I SAY?

749
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,782
WELL, THERE'S
AN OUTSIDE CHANCE

750
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,364
I CAN GET US BOTH A JOB AT
THE AUTO SHOW AT THE COLISEUM.

751
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,991
IT'S ONLY TWO WEEKS,
BUT THE MONEY'S NOT BAD.

752
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,280
ANY MONEY'S
NOT BAD.

753
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,294
WHAT DO WE
HAVE TO DO?

754
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,866
JUST LOOK PRETTY, POINT TO THE
CARS, AND SAY "TERRIFIC."

755
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:04,212
I CAN DO THAT. I CAN POINT
AND SAY "TERRIFIC."

756
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,801
WELL, THIS FRIEND'S GOING
TO LET ME KNOW THIS WEEKEND.

757
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,296
JUST KEEP IT
A LITTLE QUIET.

758
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,589
WHAT A NICE PERSON
YOU ARE.

759
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,683
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO TELL ME.

760
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,808
WELL, I FEEL
KIND OF RELATED.

761
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,805
I LIVED WITH BOBBY
ALL LAST YEAR.

762
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,438
BOBBY WHO?

763
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,605
BOBBY KULICK,
YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

764
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,025
OH, BOBBY.
THE MARRIAGE SLIPPED MY MIND.

765
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,275
COME ON, STRETCH.
OVER ON YOUR STOMACH.

766
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:35,948
AS YOU ARE WEARY, REST YOU,
WHILST I LAMENT HENRY'S CORSE.

767
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,451
STAY, YOU,
AND SET IT DOWN.

768
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,463
WHO CONJURES UP
THIS FIEND

769
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,456
TO STOP DEVOTED,
CHARITABLE DEEDS?

770
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,129
MY LORD,
LET THE COFFIN PASS.

771
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,468
UNMANNERED DOG,
STAND THOU.

772
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,474
ADVANCE THY HALBERD
HIGHER THAN MY BREAST,

773
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,007
OR, BY SAINT PAUL--

774
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:59,681
I AM MAKING A HORSETH
ASSETH OF MY SELFETH.

775
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,273
WHAT?

776
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,898
MARK, I'M BEGGING YOU.

777
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,774
YOU WANT THIS PERFORMANCE,
LET ME PLAY LADY ANNE.

778
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,782
TAKE FIVE.
FIVE MINUTES.

779
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,871
YOU'RE UNHAPPY,
ELLIOT?

780
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,746
UNHAPPY?
NO.

781
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,970
I AM FREAKING PETRIFIED.
CRITICS WILL CRUCIFY ME, MARK.

782
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,966
GAY LIBERATION
WILL HANG ME

783
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,968
FROM SHAKESPEARE'S STATUE
BY MY GENITALIA.

784
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,062
HELP ME, MARK.

785
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,136
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

786
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:45,481
I WANT MY HUMP BACK.
I WANT MY CLUBFOOT.

787
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,858
I WANT SOME PARALYSIS
IN MY RIGHT HAND,

788
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:52,356
TWO STIFF FINGERS,
A LITTLE MOTIVATION.

789
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,200
I SEE. YOU WANT
TO PLAY IT SAFE.

790
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,527
YOU WANT TO GIVE US
CONVENTIONAL RICHARD.

791
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:03,083
WELL, I CAN'T ARGUE.
THAT'S BEEN DONE FOR 400 YEARS.

792
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,249
WHAT DO I KNOW?
I'M LUCKY TO GET THE PART.

793
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,420
I COME FROM CHICAGO.
WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

794
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,220
WE DO THE PLAY AS WRITTEN.
DOESN'T GO OVER IN NEW YORK?

795
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:21,353
I RESPECT YOU, MARK. YOU'VE DONE
OFF-BROADWAY. I HAVEN'T.

796
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:27,652
I'M NOT A QUITTER. I'LL DO
RICHARD III LIKE TATUM O'NEAL.

797
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,065
I'LL DO IT, BUT DON'T
LET ME LOOK FOOLISH.

798
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,475
YOU FEEL FOOLISH?

799
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:32,903
I FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

800
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,281
I PASSED FOOLISH
ON TUESDAY.

801
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,239
WE HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

802
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,239
I-I DO.

803
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,581
I WAS NEVER GOING TO LET
YOU DO IT LIKE THAT.

804
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,330
OH THANK GOD!

805
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,960
BUT DO YOU SEE
WHERE I'M HEADING?

806
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,496
I'M TRYING, MARK.

807
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,091
RICHARD WAS GAY.

808
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,757
LET'S USE THAT
AS SUBTEXT.

809
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,426
WE'LL PUT BACK
THE CLUBFOOT.

810
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,545
AND THE TWISTED FINGERS.

811
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,681
IF YOU LIKE.

812
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,427
I LOVE THEM!

813
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,180
THEN USE THEM, BABY.

814
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,393
JUST TRY IT MY WAY.

815
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:10,444
I WILL NEVER
LET YOU GO WRONG.

816
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,776
HAVEN'T WE MET
IN OUR APARTMENT?

817
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,292
PLEASE. I ENJOY SHOPPING.
DON'T RUIN THIS FOR ME, TOO.

818
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,865
RELAX. WE DON'T HAVE TO
FIGHT TILL WE GET HOME.

819
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,706
WE NEED SOAP, DARLING.

820
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,249
NOT IN MY BATHROOM, YOU DON'T.

821
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,303
IF YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED,
AND I GET WHAT I NEED,

822
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,257
WE'RE BLOWING A LOT OF BREAD
GETTING THE SAME THINGS.

823
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,099
WHY DON'T WE HAVE ONE SHOPPING
LIST AND SPLIT THE BILL?

824
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,305
ON WHAT ITEMS?

825
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,564
FOOD. UH...

826
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,556
BATHROOM AND KITCHEN
CLEANSERS. EVERYTHING...

827
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,558
EXCEPT FEMALE
AND MALE DOODADS.

828
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,650
IN THAT AREA, YOU GO YOUR WAY,
AND I GO MY WAY.

829
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,266
WE SPLIT EVERYTHING?

830
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,323
EVERYTHING. I'LL PAY
MY FULL 1/3 SHARE.

831
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,566
1/3?

832
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:57,818
I'M NOT THE ONE WITH DAUGHTER.

833
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,239
DIDN'T LADY ANNE WASH
YOUR HANDS THE OTHER NIGHT?

834
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,078
QUICK. QUICK. I LIKE
A QUICK GIRL.

835
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,124
OKAY. RIGHT
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

836
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,699
OKAY.

837
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,341
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

838
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,012
GOOD IDEA SHARING EXPENSES.

839
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,049
I'LL NEED SHOES SOON.

840
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,062
A LITTLE CHIANTI?

841
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,064
NOT ON
MY BUDGET.

842
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:32,056
I'M SHORT OF STATURE,
BUT NOT TIGHT OF POCKET.

843
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,981
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

844
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,770
CAN I HELP YOU?

845
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,823
YES. A BOTTLE OF YOUR
FINEST CHEAP CHIANTI.

846
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,858
I HAVE A CALIFORNIA RED
FOR $1.80.

847
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,073
$1.80?

848
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,202
NOTHING FROM KANSAS?

849
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,580
COMEDIAN.

850
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,576
THIS IS
A NICE RED.

851
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,578
THIS GOES
WITH SPAGHETTI?

852
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,580
PERFECTLY.

853
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,082
IT'S UNDER
$2.00, RIGHT?

854
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,463
$1.80 IS UNDER $2.00,
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

855
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,101
MY BAG!

856
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,564
THEY TOOK MY BAG!

857
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,854
WHAT? WHO?

858
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,518
IN THE CAR.
THEY ROBBED ME!

859
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,348
EVERYTHING
WAS IN MY BAG!

860
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,364
THOSE DIRTY BASTARDS!

861
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,356
GO AFTER THEM!

862
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,358
AFTER A SPEEDING CAR?

863
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,360
THANKS. THANKS A LOT!

864
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,572
SHOULD I FIGHT THEM

865
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,372
WITH A CAN
OF TOMATO PASTE?

866
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,407
LEAVE ME ALONE!

867
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:37,876
I STILL THINK YOU OUGHT
TO CALL THE POLICE.

868
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,917
I'LL CALL THEM
FOR YOU.

869
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,051
YOU WEREN'T THAT HELPFUL
WHILE THEY ROBBED ME.

870
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:46,599
I'M NOT A GERMAN
SHEPHERD, YOU KNOW.

871
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,104
IT'S THEM!

872
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,096
WHO?

873
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,097
THE ONES
WHO TOOK MY BAG!

874
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,309
STOP!

875
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,518
STOP!

876
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,439
WHAT IS THIS,
POLICE WOMAN?

877
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:01,437
I'M GONNA GET A BULLET
BETWEEN MY GODDAMN EYES.

878
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,282
SOMEBODY,

879
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,028
STOP THOSE MEN!

880
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,196
WAIT!

881
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:13,962
HEY!

882
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,415
GIVE ME THE BAG!

883
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,416
GET OUT OF THE CAR!
HOLD IT.

884
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:20,499
HOLD IT!

885
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,804
I WAS JUST ASKING!

886
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,219
HOLD IT! RELAX.

887
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,889
A SIMPLE QUESTION.

888
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,313
HOLD IT.

889
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,848
KIDDING.

890
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,815
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

891
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:04,843
I HAD ALL
MY MONEY IN THERE,

892
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,299
EVERYTHING,

893
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:12,470
MY LAST DOLLAR
IN THE WORLD.

894
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,812
YOU AND YOUR
GODDAMN CHIANTI.

895
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,807
WHY CAN'T YOU
AT LEAST THANK ME

896
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,810
FOR RISKING MY LIFE
FOR YOU?

897
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,822
DID YOU GET
MY BAG BACK?

898
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,315
NO. SO WHY SHOULD I
THANK YOU?

899
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:30,818
WHY DO I HAVE SUCH
LOUSY LUCK WITH ACTORS?

900
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,203
I HATE ALL OF YOU.

901
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,504
GET AWAY FROM ME.

902
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,538
JUST GET AWAY.

903
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,049
THEY DIDN'T ROB YOU
BECAUSE I'M AN ACTOR.

904
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,636
AFTER I GRADUATED
FROM NORTHWESTERN,

905
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,520
I TOOK MY FIRST
SUMMER JOB.

906
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,637
I DID 10 PLAYS
IN 10 WEEKS.

907
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,864
I HAD HEPATITIS AND MUMPS
AND NEVER KNEW IT.

908
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,775
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST
GETTING YELLOW AND FAT.

909
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,276
WHICH PLAYS?

910
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,777
I PLAYED THE REPORTER
IN INHERIT THE WIND.

911
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,741
GENE KELLY DID
IN THE MOVIE.

912
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:14,781
THAT'S RIGHT.

913
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,004
HE DIDN'T DIG
AS DEEPLY AS I DID.

914
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,964
NEXT I DID
CYRANO DE BERGERAC.

915
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,456
JOSE FERRER.

916
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,957
I GOT LAUGHS
WITH HALF THE NOSE.

917
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,381
STYLE COUNTS.

918
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,469
YOU DON'T THINK
MUCH OF YOURSELF.

919
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,755
I GOT A BIG EGO.

920
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,969
YOU GOT
TO SEE THE FACE

921
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,971
TO APPRECIATE
THE WORK.

922
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,063
I TAUGHT DRAMA AT
DULUTH JUNIOR COLLEGE.

923
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,309
YOU TAUGHT DRAMA?
FAR OUT!

924
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,321
VERY FAR OUT.
IT'S UP NEAR CANADA.

925
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,324
WANT SOME MORE WINE?

926
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,816
NIENTE CHIANTI.

927
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,739
THAT'S GOOD.

928
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,988
YOU'RE TERRIFIC
WITH WORDS.

929
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,580
WORDS ARE
AN ACTOR'S CANVAS.

930
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,945
HIS LIPS
ARE HIS BRUSHES.

931
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,622
HIS TONGUE,
THE COLORS.

932
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,461
WHEN HE SPEAKS,
HE PAINTS PORTRAITS.

933
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,498
HE'S VERY CLASSY.

934
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,001
THE KID'S GOT
A GOOD EYE.

935
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,514
TONY WASN'T
A CLASSY ACTOR.

936
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,716
HE WAS JUST...

937
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,887
SEXY.

938
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,020
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M SEXY?

939
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,305
ARE YOU KIDDING?

940
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,349
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE 10 YEARS OLD.

941
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,523
IN THREE YEARS,
I'LL DRIVE YOU WILD.

942
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,533
IT'S AFTER 9:00.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

943
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,526
FIVE MORE MINUTES.

944
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,528
WE NEVER HAD A GOOD TALKER
AT DINNER.

945
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,542
IN A MIDSUMMER
NIGHT'S DREAM,

946
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,044
I PLAYED
THE SAME PART

947
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:44,247
MICKEY ROONEY
PLAYED IN THE MOVIE.

948
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,538
PUCK!

949
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,551
THE LADY PRODUCER
FROM NEW YORK

950
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,554
ASKED ME TO PLAY
RICHARD III.

951
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,047
IT'S OFF, OFF,
OFF-BROADWAY.

952
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,050
ARE WE INVITED
TO THE OPENING?

953
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,063
YOU TWO CAN COME
TUESDAY NIGHT.

954
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,056
TUESDAY'S
A SCHOOL NIGHT.

955
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,058
TONY'S OPENING
WAS ON A SCHOOL NIGHT.

956
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,861
I SAID NO.

957
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:07,944
SHIT! SHOOT.

958
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:12,069
I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE.
GOODNIGHT.

959
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:24,038
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN MY BEDROOM?

960
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,998
TALKING TO ME?

961
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,038
YOU CAN HAVE
THE BIG BEDROOM

962
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:32,053
FOR AN EXTRA
$50 A MONTH,

963
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:34,046
PAYABLE IN CASH NOW.

964
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,008
A RENT INCREASE

965
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,548
FOR GETTING WHAT
I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN?

966
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,104
NO, THANKS.

967
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,055
WOULD YOU LEND ME $50?

968
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:48,059
I'LL EITHER PAY YOU
7 1/2% INTEREST

969
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,072
OR DO YOUR LAUNDRY.

970
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:53,574
THEY REALLY
CLEANED YOU OUT, HUH?

971
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,698
EVERYONE
FROM HERE TO ITALY.

972
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,837
I HAVE, UH...

973
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,336
$28 AND CHANGE.

974
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,507
I'LL SPLIT IT WITH YOU.

975
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,836
STARTING OPENING NIGHT,
I GET $240 A WEEK.

976
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,853
I'LL MAKE A DEAL.

977
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,845
I'LL PAY ALL
THE LIVING EXPENSES

978
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,847
TILL YOU
GET YOURSELF A JOB,

979
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,850
AND I'LL EVEN DO
MY OWN LAUNDRY.

980
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,022
I SEE.

981
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:32,861
AND WHAT DO YOU GET?

982
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,527
OH...

983
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:39,565
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS BE NICE TO ME.

984
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,080
YOU GO TO HELL!

985
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,457
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?
EVERYONE'S NOT AFTER

986
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,802
YOUR MAGNIFICENT
BODY, LADY.

987
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,257
IT'S NOT SO MAGNIFICENT.

988
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:02,297
IT'S FAIR, BUT IT AIN'T
KEEPING ME UP NIGHTS.

989
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,813
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
VERY PRETTY.

990
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,724
MAYBE IF YOU SMILED
ONCE IN A WHILE, OKAY,

991
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,274
BUT THAT'S
AGAINST YOUR RELIGION.

992
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:11,897
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
PERSON EVER DUMPED ON.

993
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,896
I'M A RECENT DUMPEE.

994
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,898
I AM A DEDICATED
ACTOR, PAULA.

995
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,901
BECAUSE OF A MENTALLY
ARTHRITIC DIRECTOR,

996
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,914
I'M PLAYING
THE SECOND-GREATEST ROLE

997
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,407
IN THE HISTORY
OF THEATER

998
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,409
LIKE A FRESH
CALIFORNIA FRUIT SALAD.

999
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,922
WHEN I SAY NICE,
I MEAN FAIR.

1000
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,206
I'M A FAIR PERSON.

1001
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:38,421
I DON'T WANT
TO JUMP ON YOU.

1002
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,432
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU.

1003
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,926
LUCY.

1004
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,428
SHE'S WORTH
PUTTING UP WITH YOU.

1005
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,941
HERE'S $14 FOR HER CARE
AND FEEDING.

1006
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,435
YOU GET ZIPPIDY DOO-DAH.

1007
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,437
WANT ANY MONEY,

1008
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,939
BORROW IT
FROM YOUR DAUGHTER.

1009
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,362
I AM NOW GOING
INSIDE MY ROOM

1010
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,372
TO MEDITATE AWAY MY
HOSTILITY TOWARDS YOU.

1011
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,825
PERSONALLY, I DON'T
THINK IT CAN BE DONE.

1012
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:44,534
AS YOU ARE WEARY,
REST YOU,

1013
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,530
WHILST I LAMENT
KING HENRY'S CORSE.

1014
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:50,043
STAY, YOU THAT BEAR
THE CORSE,

1015
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:52,036
AND SET IT DOWN.

1016
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:57,038
WHAT BLACK MAGICIAN
CONJURES UP THIS FIEND?

1017
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,053
MY LORD,
LET THE COFFIN PASS.

1018
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,046
UNMANNERED DOG,

1019
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,047
STAND THOU
WHEN I COMMAND.

1020
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,049
ADVANCE THY
HALBERD HIGHER--

1021
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,391
GOOD! GOOD!

1022
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,306
THAT I MIGHT DIE AT ONCE,

1023
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,475
FOR NOW THEY KILL ME
WITH A LIVING DEATH.

1024
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,475
THOSE EYES OF THINE FROM MINE
HAVE DRAWN SALT TEARS,

1025
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:18,478
SHAMED THEIR ASPECT
WITH STORE OF CHILDISH DROPS.

1026
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,481
THESE EYES, WHICH NEVER SHED
A REMORSEFUL TEAR...

1027
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,493
WHAT IS IT?

1028
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:26,988
AM I DISTURBING YOU?

1029
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:27,989
YES!

1030
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,490
SORRY.

1031
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:30,992
THEN DON'T DISTURB ME.

1032
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,503
YOU'RE SNAPPING.

1033
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:33,995
I WAS SARCASTIC.

1034
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,996
SNAPPING IS,
"BUG OFF, I'M BUSY!"

1035
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,998
WHAT'S WRONG?

1036
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,000
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING'S WRONG.

1037
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,012
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

1038
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,514
YOU OPEN WITH RICHARD III

1039
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:46,546
IN FRONT OF ALL THE NEW YORK
CRITICS TOMORROW NIGHT

1040
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,510
WITH A CHARTREUSE HUMP
ON YOUR BACK.

1041
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,512
WHAT'S WRONG?

1042
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:55,524
I'M TRYING TO SAVE MY CAREER!
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.

1043
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,518
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
NO, DON'T TELL ME!

1044
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,521
I DIPPED INTO
YOUR PEANUT BUTTER, RIGHT?

1045
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:04,534
HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?

1046
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:08,447
I JUST CAME TO REPAY
YOU YOUR $14.

1047
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,487
I GOT A JOB.

1048
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,451
DO YOU HAVE SOME
BICARBONATE?

1049
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,502
LUCY IS SICK.

1050
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,496
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

1051
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,288
SHE HAD TWO SUNDAES
FOR DINNER.

1052
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,502
I ORDERED THEM.

1053
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,462
INCREDIBLE!

1054
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,512
I'M SURPRISED
THEY DON'T SELL

1055
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,506
INSURANCE POLICIES
TO CHILDREN.

1056
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,508
THAT'S BICARBONATE?

1057
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,600
DON'T START!

1058
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,774
HOW'S IT
FEELING, LUCE?

1059
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,267
DID YOU SEE
THE EXORCIST?

1060
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,770
YEAH.

1061
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,781
THEN YOU BETTER
GET OUT OF THE ROOM.

1062
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,234
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

1063
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,276
LUCY, TURN OVER
ON YOUR BACK.

1064
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,794
RELAX, COME ON.

1065
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,788
DON'T YOU TRUST ME?

1066
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,170
I TRUSTED MY MOTHER TODAY,
AND LOOK HOW I FEEL.

1067
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:10,223
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
SLOW, DEEP BREATHS.

1068
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,139
GO ON.

1069
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,063
NOW.

1070
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,858
THAT'S IT.

1071
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:27,855
WATCH.

1072
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,825
THINK YOU CAN DO THIS?

1073
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,379
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO MANAGE IT.

1074
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,835
EYES CLOSED, LUCE.

1075
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,390
KEEP BREATHING DEEPLY.

1076
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,353
DEEP BREATH.

1077
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,847
THAT'S IT.

1078
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,848
HOW'S
THE PLAY GOING?

1079
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,850
SHH!

1080
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,901
ONE SICK PERSON
AT A TIME.

1081
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,364
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

1082
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,778
FEELING ANY BETTER?

1083
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,782
A LITTLE.

1084
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,794
ISN'T THIS MORE SOOTHING
THAN MEDICINE?

1085
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,997
IT TASTES BETTER, TOO.

1086
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,631
MOM, CAN WE GO
TO THE OPENING?

1087
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,298
YOU STILL OWE ME
A PRESENT.

1088
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,297
TODAY
WAS THE PITS.

1089
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,800
SURE.

1090
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,802
ANYTHING YOU SAY.

1091
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:37,814
TERRIFIC.

1092
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:41,885
NOW YOU HAVE TO
GET ME A DRESS.

1093
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:52,897
THANK YOU.

1094
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,833
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

1095
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,828
IT WAS VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU.

1096
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,791
I'M NOT USED TO
THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS.

1097
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,303
I KNOW.

1098
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:11,795
BLANCHE DUBOIS
IN STREETCAR.

1099
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,467
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE HER.

1100
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,005
YOU START TO TRUST A MAN,

1101
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,599
AND THEY TAKE YOU AWAY
AT THE END OF THE MOVIE.

1102
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:25,307
I'M SORRY FOR...

1103
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:27,811
WELL, I'M JUST SORRY.

1104
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:33,493
I'M ATTEMPTING TO BE
NICE, DECENT, AND FAIR.

1105
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,445
HOW AM I DOING?

1106
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:39,872
MR. GARFIELD?

1107
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:45,286
MR. GARFIELD.

1108
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,671
WAKE UP.

1109
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:53,342
YOU CAN'T SLEEP
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

1110
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,269
UPSTAIRS TO THE RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

1111
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:08,307
I HOPE THIS IS FUNNY.
IS IT MUSICAL COMEDY?

1112
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:09,812
IT'S SHAKESPEARE.

1113
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:10,983
BORING.

1114
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,821
LOOK AT THE STUBS
AND FIND OUR SEATS.

1115
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,317
OVER HERE.

1116
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,239
NUMBER...

1117
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,407
UH, WAIT.

1118
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,065
IT'S SO EXCITING.

1119
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,034
WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT.

1120
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,414
IT IS SO CONTEMPORARY.

1121
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,430
NOW IS THE WINTER
OF OUR DISCONTENT

1122
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:50,101
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
BY THIS SON OF YORK,

1123
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:54,114
AND THE CLOUDS
THAT LOWERED UPON OUR HOUSE

1124
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,108
IN THE DEEP BOSOM
OF THE OCEAN BURIED.

1125
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:04,292
NOW ARE OUR BROWS BOUND
WITH VICTORIOUS WREATHS,

1126
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,624
OUR BRUISED ARMS
HUNG UP FOR MONUMENTS,

1127
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:14,842
OUR STERN ALARUMS CHANGED
TO MERRY MEETINGS.

1128
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:18,547
SOUNDS LIKE THAT GUY
IN THE BEAUTY PARLOR.

1129
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,429
BE PATIENT.

1130
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:23,466
THEY ARE FRIENDS.

1131
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,140
RATCLIFFE.

1132
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,484
LOVEL.

1133
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,191
HERE IS THE HEAD
OF THAT TRAITOR,

1134
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,399
THE DANGEROUS AND
UNSUSPECTED HASTINGS.

1135
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,280
I TOOK HIM FOR THE PLAINEST,
HARMLESS CREATURE

1136
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,490
THAT BREATHED UPON THE EARTH
A CHRISTIAN,

1137
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,291
MADE HIM MY BOOK,
WHEREIN MY SOUL

1138
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:51,076
RECORDED THE HISTORY
OF ALL HER SECRET THOUGHTS.

1139
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,081
EXCUSE ME.

1140
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,132
IS IT OVER?

1141
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,165
IT IS FOR ME.

1142
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,313
A HORSE! A HORSE!

1143
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:10,848
MY KINGDOM
FOR A HORSE!

1144
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,311
WITHDRAW, MY LORD.
I'LL HELP YOU TO A HORSE.

1145
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,027
AAH!

1146
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:27,908
BRAVO!

1147
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,330
BRAVO!

1148
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,581
DID YOU REALLY LOVE IT?
REALLY REALLY LOVE IT?

1149
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,883
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.

1150
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,337
OH, GOD!

1151
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:40,337
EVERYBODY,
SHE LOVED IT!

1152
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,429
MY MOTHER LOVED IT!

1153
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,306
RIGHT THROUGH
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

1154
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:55,483
THANK YOU. WE'RE
ALL SO EXCITED.

1155
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:59,529
I HAVE A FEELING
HE'D RATHER BE ALONE.

1156
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:01,315
HE'LL KNOW WE THOUGHT
IT WAS LOUSY

1157
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:02,648
IF WE DON'T SAY HELLO.

1158
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,203
ALRIGHT BUT TRY
AND BE TACTFUL.

1159
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,446
WHAT'S TACTFUL?

1160
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,027
LIE.

1161
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,333
HE'S OVER THERE.

1162
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,326
HELLO, MR. GARFIELD.

1163
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,038
IT'S LUCY AND ME.

1164
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,627
WE CAME BACK
TO TELL YOU

1165
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,626
HOW MUCH WE ENJOYED IT.

1166
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,759
I HAD
THE BEST TIME.

1167
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,336
FIRST I THOUGHT IT
WAS BORING.

1168
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,601
OH, BUT THEN IT
PICKED UP NEAR THE END.

1169
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:28,894
WE WON'T KEEP YOU.

1170
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:32,557
WE JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR THE LOVELY EVENING.

1171
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:34,848
PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU
ON THE WAY OUT.

1172
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,651
THEY DON'T EVER WANT
TO FORGET YOUR NAME.

1173
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:42,227
WELL, GOODNIGHT.

1174
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,243
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

1175
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:52,623
COME ON, LUCY.

1176
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,459
PETER, YOU
WON'T BELIEVE IT.

1177
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,640
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

1178
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,563
OH, GOD!
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

1179
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,613
THOU HAST BROKEN
THY VASE.

1180

PLUS TAXES.

1182
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,985
ARE YOU OKAY?

1183
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,372
NOT ACCORDING
TO THE TIMES.

1184
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,909
HAVE YOU READ
THE TIMES?

1185
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,002
CAN I GET YOU
A CUP OF COFFEE?

1186
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,788
OH!

1187
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1188
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,673
THE TIMES SAID,

NEW YORK DEBUT, YOU KNOW.

1210
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,485
AMES, IOWA, IS WHERE
IT REALLY COUNTS, YOU KNOW.

1211
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:53,909
AMES, IOWA.

1212
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,697
IF YOU DON'T
MAKE IT IN AMES,

1213
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:57,541
THEN YOU GOT
CAREER TROUBLES.

1214
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,495
OH, MY GOD!

1215
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,999
CHANNEL 5
WAS HONEST,

1216
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,421
DIRECT AND HONEST.

1217
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:11,632
"RICHARD III STUNK.

1218
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:16,433
ELLIOT GARFIELD
WAS THE STINKEE."

1219
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,020
ELLIOT, NO!

1220
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,516
AM I IN BED?

1221
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,531
BECAUSE IF I'M IN BED,
THE SPRINGS ARE SHOT.

1222
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:32,113
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T PUT

1223
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,452
UNHEALTHY THINGS
INTO YOUR BODY.

1224
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,079
I WAS PUTTING THEM
INTO RICHARD'S.

1225
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,655
I WAS TRYING TO KILL
THE SON OF A BITCH.

1226
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,671
PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO BED.
THIS FURNITURE ISN'T MINE.

1227
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,665
YOU THINK I'M DEFEATED?

1228
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,627
YOU THINK
I'M DISCOURAGED?

1229
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,337
YOU THINK I'M UPSET OVER 14
UNIMPORTANT NEGATIVE REVIEWS?

1230
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,009
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM.

1231
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,928
OH...
OH...

1232
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,308
SORRY. THIS APARTMENT
IS RATED PG.

1233
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,056
I KEEP FORGETTING.

1234
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,097
YOU WERE WONDERFUL
TONIGHT, REALLY.

1235
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:08,442
I WAS AN ELIZABETHAN
FRUIT FLY.

1236
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:12,950
I WAS THE BETTY BOOP
OF STRATFORD-ON-AVON.

1237
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,744
I WAS PUTRID.

1238
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,528
CAPITAL "P,"

1239
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,451
CAPITAL "U,"

1240
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,950
CAPITAL "TRID."

1241
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,951
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN
INTERESTING INTERPRETATION.

1242
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,463
IT WAS BULLSHIT!

1243
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,957
YOU DIDN'T SEE
THEIR FACES.

1244
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,959
WHEN I WALKED OUT
ON STAGE,

1245
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:34,802
210 PEOPLE LOOKING LIKE THEY
JUST GOT A SHOT OF NOVOCAIN.

1246
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,971
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

1247
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,391
I WANT THE TRUTH.
SAY IT.

1248
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,230
SAY IT OR I'LL SMASH THIS
PRICELESS $9.00 LAMP TO PIECES.

1249
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:48,688
WAS I PUTRID OR WAS I NOT?
SAY IT!

1250
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,068
YES, YES, YOU WERE PUTRID!

1251
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:55,237
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SO BLUNT ABOUT IT.

1252
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,487
I'M SORRY.

1253
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,029
GIVE THAT TO ME.

1254
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,202
THANK YOU.

1255
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:04,750
I THOUGHT I HAD SOME GOOD
MOMENTS NOW AND THEN,

1256
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:07,996
LIKE WALKING ON
AND WALKING OFF.

1257
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,209
THE REST WAS CACA.

1258
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,000
SURE I CAN'T GET YOU
ANYTHING?

1259
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,013
SOME OF YOUR
HEALTH VITAMINS?

1260
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,375
DON'T WALK OUT
ON ME, PLEASE.

1261
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,013
ONCE A NIGHT
IS ENOUGH.

1262
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,506
I'M HERE.

1263
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:23,894
I'M LISTENING.

1264
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:31,073
I CAN PLAY THAT PART,
YOU KNOW.

1265
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:36,404
I CAN PLAY THE HUMP
OFF THAT GUY.

1266
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,953
I WAS BETTER ON THE BUS
COMING IN FROM CHICAGO

1267
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,527
THAN I WAS ON
THAT STAGE TONIGHT.

1268
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,918
AND NOW IS THE WINTER
OF OUR DISCONTENT

1269
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:53,004
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
BY THIS SON OF YORK,

1270
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,463
AND ALL THE CLOUDS
THAT LOWERED UPON OUR HOUSE

1271
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:59,433
IN THE DEEP BOSOM
OF THE OCEAN BURIED.

1272
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,556
ET CETERA, ET CETERA,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

1273
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,440
OH, THAT IS GOOD.

1274
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,555
IT'S WONDERFUL.
HONESTLY.

1275
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:12,943
THANK YOU.

1276
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,439
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1277
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,281
YOU'RE NOT SUCH
A BAD PERSON AFTER ALL,

1278
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:21,118
BUT THAT PUTRID REMARK
REALLY HURT.

1279
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,534
THAT REALLY GOT TO ME,
YOU KNOW?

1280
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:27,293
I KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

1281
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,747
YOU TRY AND GET
SOME SLEEP NOW, OKAY?

1282
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:34,499
DON'T TELL LUCY
ABOUT THE TIMES.

1283
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:35,922
NO, I WON'T.

1284
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,301
OR IN THE NEWS.

1285
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,258

OR CHANNEL 2,
4, 7, 9, AND 11.

1287
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,006
NO, I WON'T.

1288
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,101
TRY TO GET
SOME SLEEP.

1289
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,190
GOODNIGHT.

1290
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,595
GOODNIGHT.

1291
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,234
NO AUTOGRAPHS, PLEASE.

1292
01:09:56,651 --> 01:10:01,821
NOW IS THE WINTER
OF OUR DISCONTENT

1293
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:06,661
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
BY THE SON OF YORK.

1294

"ONE MUST ALWAYS SUSPECT BRAVE
AND COURAGEOUS ATTEMPTS

NEW AND DARING CONCEPTS.

1297
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:21,755
WHAT'S IRREVERENCE?

1298
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,508
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

1299
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,970

1302
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,440
DOES THAT MEAN
HE DIDN'T LIKE IT?

1303
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,475
HE HAS TWO MONTHS
TO LIVE.

1304

HE'S A CYNIC.

SCOTCH TAPED MY TONGUE

1306

TO THE ROOF
OF MY MOUTH?

1307
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:47,445
UGH!

1308
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,200
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COFFEE?

1309

NOT UNLESS IT HAS
SOME BICARBONATE.

CONGRATULATIONS.

1311
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,672
FOR WHAT?

1312
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:05,554
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

1313
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,262
WHY DO YOU LET YOUR CHILD
READ PORNOGRAPHY?

1314
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:11,483
WANT SOME PUFFED RICE
OR COCOA PUFFS?

1315
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:16,187
STARVE A COLD,
FEED A FAILURE, EH?

1316
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,647
HELLO.

1317
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,568
YES, JUST A MINUTE.
IT'S FOR YOU.

1318
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,027
I GET THE COVER
OF NEWSWEEK?

1319
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:25,779
HELLO.

1320
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,080
HI, HARV.

1321
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,794
HUH?

1322
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,195
YEAH, I READ THEM.

1323
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:36,251
UH-HUH.

1324
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,249
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

1325
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:40,631
OKAY. ALRIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

1326
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:46,051
THERE YOU GO. YOU THINK
YOUR WORLD IS COLLAPSING,

1327
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:47,801
AND SOMETHING
WONDERFUL HAPPENS.

1328
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,182
WHAT?

1329
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,969
THEY CLOSED THE SHOW. I DON'T
HAVE TO DO IT ANYMORE

1330
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,103
AMERICAN THEATER
IS SAVED.

1331
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,099
OH, I'M SORRY.

1332
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,851
IT'S ALL
FOR THE BEST.

1333
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,653
NOW I CAN TAKE
THAT OTHER JOB.

1334
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,106
WHAT OTHER JOB?

1335
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,606
I'M LOOKING.

1336
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,278
LUCE, WE'RE LATE.
GET YOUR JACKET.

1337
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:08,623
DID YOU KNOW SPENCER TRACY
GOT TERRIBLE REVIEWS

1338
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,735
THE FIRST TIME
HE WAS ON BROADWAY?

1339
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:12,082
NO, HE DIDN'T.

1340
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,577
OH, I THOUGHT HE DID.

1341
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,463
YOU DO KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER
HAS A CRUSH ON ME?

1342
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,960
YES, I'VE NOTICED.

1343
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,761
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT, MOM?

1344
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,465
WELL...NOT TO TAKE AWAY
FROM YOUR PERSONAL CHARM...

1345
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,967
SHE HAD ONE
ON TONY, TOO.

1346
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,390
YOU'RE FICKLE AT 10.

1347
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,099
AND AT 6. SHE HAD ONE
ON HER FATHER.

1348
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:38,102
COME ON.

1349
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:39,563
WAIT FOR ME
DOWNSTAIRS.

1350
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,942
WHY?

1351
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,359
BECAUSE I'M THE MOTHER,
THAT'S WHY.

1352
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,608
OH.

1353
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,608
SO...

1354
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:51,781
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

1355
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,660
YOU MEAN
MY IMMEDIATE PLANS?

1356
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,002
WELL, AFTER BREAKFAST,

1357
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:01,496
I WAS CONTEMPLATING
AN ABORTED SUICIDE ATTEMPT

1358
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,801
AND THEN
THINK ABOUT WELFARE.

1359
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,473
SO...I MEAN...

1360
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,335
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK
TO CHICAGO?

1361
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,063
CHICAGO, NO.
SIBERIA, POSSIBLY.

1362
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,564
I MEAN, YOUR ROOM
IS PAID FOR.

1363
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,518
IT BELONGS TO YOU.

1364
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:22,308
IF I DECIDE TO LEAVE, I'LL GIVE
YOU AN ADDRESS TO SHIP IT TO.

1365
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,613
IF YOU STAY, I COULD USE
SOME HELP WITH LUCY.

1366
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,278
I WON'T BE BACK

1367
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,647
IN TIME
TO MAKE HER DINNER.

1368
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,494
WELL, WHAT I'M SAYING IS...

1369
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:32,529
I ACCEPT.

1370
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,162
GOOD. SHE HAS DINNER
AT 6.

1371
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,000
THERE ARE PORK CHOPS
IN THE FREEZER.

1372
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,155
HAVE A NICE DAY.

1373
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:41,504
CUTE.

1374
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,419
DEFINITELY CUTE.

1375
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:45,338
HI. MY NAME
IS DONNA DOUGLAS.

1376
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,916
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU
TO THE INTERNATIONAL AUTO SHOW

1377
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,802
AND TO THE SUBARU DISPLAY.

1378
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,389
HOW MANY OF YOU
HAVE WONDERED

1379
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:54,854
HOW THE U.S. SKI TEAM,

1386
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:10,573
TO COMBUSTION ENGINES,

1387
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,030
AND THE SPECTACULAR DESIGN

1388
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,780
THEN ELIMINATES THE NEED
FOR POWER- AND FUEL--

1389
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,083

FOR POWER-
AND FUEL-ROBBING, UH...

FUEL-ROBBING...THINGS.

1395

SHE'S UP.

1399
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,557
UH...THE FRONT WINDOW
IS CLEARLY VISIBLE

1400
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,845
AND WAS DESIGNED
FOR MAXIMUM VISIBILITY

1401
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,639
WHETHER ONE IS LOOKING
TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT

1402
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,104
OR STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1403
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,483
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

1404
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,900
MY RICHARD
WASN'T THAT BAD.

1405
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:52,398
THE REAR WINDOW
IS ALSO DESIGNED

1406
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,913
FOR MAXIMUM VISIBILITY

1407
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,445
IF ONE IS LOOKING
OUT THE BACK.

1408
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:02,037
THE TIRES ARE OPTIONAL
AND ATTRACTIVE.

1409
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,958
CONSUMERS GUIDE SAYS
THAT THE SUBARU

1410
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,497

ECONOMY CAR.

1411
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:08,631

01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:14,591
TIME OUT, TIME OUT.

1415
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:15,802
ONE MINUTE.
UNO MOMENTO.

1416
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:16,972
THANKS A LOT.

1417
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,310
I COULD HAVE
GOTTEN FIRED

1418
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,644
EXCEPT THEY DON'T KNOW
THE ENGLISH WORD FOR IT.

1419
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,640
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

1420
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,191
YOU CAME
TO SEE ME ACT.

1421
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,774
THOUGHT I'D COME TO SEE
YOU ACT. YOU WERE GOOD.

1422
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:26,810
ONE CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENT--

1423
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,523
STUDY, LEARN YOUR LINES.
REALLY.

1424
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,324
NEXT YEAR, YOU'LL BE READY
FOR BIGGER PARTS LIKE TRUCKS.

1425
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,648
DID YOU HAVE
YOUR DINNER?

1426
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:34,363
NO.

1427
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:35,072
NO?

1428
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,621
IT MUST BE
AFTER 7:00.

1429
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,334
WHAT AM I
PAYING YOU FOR?

1430
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,124
PAYING ME?

1431
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:41,658

1433
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:44,996

01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,328
COME HERE. I CAME
TO GIVE YOU THE KID.

1435
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:48,503

01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:49,671
HE GOT A JOB.

1437
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:50,459
DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT?

1438
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,301
ACTING?

1439
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:53,756
I DIDN'T SAY THAT. IT'S IN
THE ENTERTAINMENT FIELD.

1440
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,046
I'LL BE BACK 2 A.M.
DON'T WAIT UP.

01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,755
I NEVER KNEW

1443
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,472
THE MAN WEARS ME OUT.

1444
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,562
HE DEFINITELY
WEARS ME OUT.

1445
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,348
HE WEARS ME OUT, TOO.

1446
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,191
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN,
GENTLEMEN.

1447
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,856
UH, THAT GIRL IMPRESSED ME
VERY MUCH WITH YOUR CAR.

1448
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,146
I'M IN
THE TAXI BUSINESS,

1449
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,189
I'M IN THE MARKET
FOR AN ENTIRE FLEET.

1450
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,032
IF YOU THINK
YOU COULD HANDLE IT,

1451
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:17,028
I'D LIKE TO COME BACK

1452
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,870

01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,485
WE'D LIKE TO

01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,331
WHAT DO THEY DO?

1464
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:12,674
I DON'T KNOW. I REALLY DON'T.

1465
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,484
WANNA GO INSIDE?
YOU INTERESTED?

1466
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:35,982
COME INSIDE, QUICK.

1467
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:36,993
WHAT IS IT?

1468
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,454
THERE'S A DRUNK
ON STAGE.

1469
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,738
THROW THAT CREEP
OUT OF HERE!

1470
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,372

1471
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,421
WHEN HE COMES OUT,
I'LL OPEN THE DOOR.

1472
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:51,495
YOU WANT YOUR PAY?

1473
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,039
MM-HMM!

1474
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:55,842
WHICH ONE OF YOU PEOPLE
IS CAUSING ALL THE TROUBLE HERE?

1475
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,507
NEED ANY HELP
WITH THE FELLOW?

1476
01:17:57,715 --> 01:17:59,085
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,260
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

1478
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:02,509
LET'S FINISH THE SHOW.

1479
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,060
ALL I WANT IS
ONE LITTLE KISS.

1480
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,175
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU. I DON'T
KISS ON THE FIRST DATE.

1481
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,982
HEY! THEY LIKE US!

1482
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,309

1485
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,444
NO.

1486
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,784
COME HERE.

1487
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,238
I'M GONNA BUST
YOUR STUPID FACE IN.

1488
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,329
NO, NO! THEY DON'T
WANNA SEE THAT.

1489
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,294
YOU WANNA SEE LITTLE TWERP
GET HIS FACE BROKEN?

1490
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,996
TOUGH CROWD,
TOUGH CROWD!

1491
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,460
LET'S TALK THIS OVER.

1492
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:38,711
TELL ME YOUR NAME.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1493
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:39,803
EARL.

1494
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,757
EARL?
EARL WHAT?

1495
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:42,797
EARL FIST.

1496
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,936
IT'S MY FIRST
STANDING OVATION.

1497
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,935
YOU KNOW WHAT
CYNTHIA FEIN SAID?

1498
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,818
WHO IS
CYNTHIA FEIN?

1499
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:01,645
THE GIRL IN MY CLASS WITH
THE BRACES AND THE BIG CHEST.

1500
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,612
ELLIOT PICKED ME UP
FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

1501
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:06,373
AND CYNTHIA SAYS
HE'S GOT CHARISMA.

1502
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,275
I LOOKED IT UP,
AND HE DOES.

1503
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,834
ALRIGHT,
CUT IT OUT.

1504
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,078
CUT WHAT OUT?

1505
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,289
STOP TRYING TO MAKE
SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

1506
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,880
ME?
CYNTHIA FEIN--

1507
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,086
CYNTHIA FEIN,
MY BEHIND.

1508
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,716
STOP PUSHING ME.

1509
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,174
WHO'S PUSHING?

1510
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:26,264
YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER MY BACK.

1511
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,560
HE'S OKAY, ALRIGHT.

1512
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,265
ONCE IN A WHILE,
HE EVEN ACTS HUMAN.

1513
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:33,556
BUT STOP PUSHING ME

1514
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,349
BECAUSE THAT MAN
IS NOT MY TYPE.

1515
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,318
I HEARD THAT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1516
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,567
IF YOU HEARD IT,
WHY ASK?

1517
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,739
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1518
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,579
I SAID YOUR TYPE
NEVER HANGS AROUND

1519
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,754
LONG ENOUGH
TO STAY YOUR TYPE.

1520
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,414
THAT IS A ROTTEN
THING TO SAY.

1521
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,333
I KNOW. I JUST FELT
LIKE SAYING IT.

1522
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:03,343
SOMETIMES I CAN BE
SO FURIOUS WITH YOU !

1523
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:06,009
THAT WAS A STINKY
THING TO DO!

1524
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,052
OHH!

1525
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,933
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE?

1526
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,984
OH, I USED IT
TO STOP A FIST

1527
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:19,518
FROM GOING THROUGH
MY FACE.

1528
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,072
OH, MY GOD!

1529
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,032
WHAT KIND OF MEAT
IS THIS?

1530
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,527
VEAL PARMESAN.

1531
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,029
IT'S BETTER THAN
POTATO SALAD.

1532
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,331
I'M OUT OF WORK
AGAIN.

1533
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,121
LISTEN, YOU TWO HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE.

1534
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,922
I'VE DECIDED THAT YOU CAN STAY
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

1535
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,536
IT'S MY ONLY HOPE
FOR SURVIVAL.

1536
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:43,553
LISTEN, SOMETHING'S
BOUND TO TURN UP.

1537
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,546
DO YOU THINK SO?

1538
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:48,048
CYNTHIA THINKS
YOU'VE GOT CHARISMA.

1539
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,640
CHARISE YOURSELF
TO BED, YOUNG LADY.

1540
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,756
PUT THAT ON YOUR EYE.

1541
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,188
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'VE GOT?

1542
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:03,526
I MEAN, DO I CHARISE YOU AT ALL?

1543
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,284
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
TALENT-WISE,

1544
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,356
TALENT-WISE,
I'M VERY SECURE.

1545
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,161
JUST APPEAL-WISE,

1546
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,486
I'M A LITTLE SHAKY.

1547
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,121
COME ON YOU CAN TELL ME,
I CAN TAKE IT.

1548
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:17,409
AM I AS ADORABLE
AS I THINK I AM?

1549
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,753
YOU ARE OUTRAGEOUS.

1550
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,578
I CANNOT KEEP UP
WITH YOUR ENERGY.

1551
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,173
THEY MUST PICK YOU UP
ON CB RADIOS IN ALASKA.

1552
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,009
YOU GET THE FEELING SOMETHING
IS STARTING BETWEEN US?

1553
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,005
I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, 16
YEARS AGO

1554
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,587
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I HEARD THAT LINE.

1555
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:34,103
OUT OF MY WAY PLEASE,
I HAVE TO SELL CARS MORNING.

1556
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:38,386
OH, THAT'S WHY YOU GOT
THE KABUKI MAKE-UP ON.

1557
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,942
YOU LET ME
STAND THERE!

1558
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:51,106
OH, GIVE ME A TOWEL.

1559
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:00,036
DON'T YOU EVER
DO THAT AGAIN.

1560
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:03,379
YOUR LIPS MAY SAY NO NO, BUT
THERE'S "YES, YES" IN YOUR EYES.

1561
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:04,746
DON'T GET CUTE.

1562
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:07,592
YOUR GOD DAMN NOSE DRIVES ME
CRAZY.

1563
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:08,798
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

1564
01:22:09,008 --> 01:22:10,838
IT'S PUG, VERY PUG.
IT SHOOTS DOWN STRAIGHT

1565
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,141
BUT THEN IT TURNS PUG
AT THE LAST SECOND.

1566
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,175
DON'T!

1567
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:15,718
WE GOT OURSELVES
A HOT INFATUATION.

1568
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,061
I HAVE NO TIME
FOR ROMANCE.

1569
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,638
YOU DROVE ME BANANAS
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU

1570
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,694
THROUGH THE CRACK IN THAT DOOR.
I SAID

1571
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,478
THIS IS BEST HALF A FACE
I EVER LAID EYES ON.

1572
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,072
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH,
I AM NOT ON YOUR SIDE.

1573
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,398
SMELLING YOUR HAIR
DRIVES ME NUTS.

1574
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:33,704
I COULD BE SLEEPING
YOU WALK BY MY DOOR,

1575
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:37,538
MY NOSTRILS SAY, "WHO'S THAT
COMING DOWN THIS STREET?"

1576
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:39,035
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

1577
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:42,536
I'M 33. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO GET
EMBARRASSED ANYMORE.

1578
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,210
IF YOU WERE A MUSICAL,
PEOPLE WOULD HUM YOUR FACE.

1579
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:48,963
DON'T DO THIS.

1580
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,423
DON'T MAKE ME
FEEL HAPPY.

1581
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:53,973
I HATE THAT "IT'S WONDERFUL
TO BE ALIVE FEELING."

1582
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:55,798
DO NOT COME
INTO MY LIFE.

1583
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,893
I JUST GOT THROUGH
PUTTING UP FENCES.

1584
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,718
CAN I WALK YOU
TO YOUR DOOR?

1585
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:01,314
IT'S A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD.

1586
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:02,478
ELLIOT!

1587
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,766
YES, CALL ME ELLIOT.
I'VE ALREADY BITTEN YOUR NECK.

1588
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,860
ELLIOT, I AM PRAYING THIS
IS GONE IN THE MORNING.

1589
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:10,647
THE HELL YOU ARE, MEET ME
IN THE KITCHEN TOMORROW NIGHT.

1590
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:11,991
DRESS CASUAL.

1591
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,158
PAULA!

1592
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:22,461
PAULA!
WHERE ARE YOU RUNNING?

1593
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,745
I WANNA SEE LUCY
BEFORE SHE GOES TO BED.

1594
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:26,579
WAIT,
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

1595
01:23:26,794 --> 01:23:31,134
THE MASERATI PEOPLE ARE THROWING
A SMALL PARTY AT 21.

1596
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,880
THAT GUY, GIORGIO, THE ONE
THAT SMELLS BETTER THAN US

1597
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,684
WELL, HE SPECIFICALLY
ASKED FOR YOU,

1598
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:39,007
"THE GIRL WITH
THE LAUGHING TEETH."

1599
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:41,143
I CAN'T,
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME.

1600
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,350
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

1601
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:46,019
THAT GUY IS GORGEOUS!
HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU.

1602
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,770
IF IT WAS
ANY OTHER TIME.

1603
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:35,947
ELLIOT?

1604
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:40,486
ELLIOT?

1605
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:43,749
ARE YOU UP HERE?

1606
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,670
SAY SOMETHING.

1607
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,547
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

1608
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,089
OHH.

1609
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:05,019
I SAID IT WAS FORMAL, KID.

1610
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:20,702
PARTY'S GOT TO BE OVER
BY 9 A.M.

1611
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:24,238
OTHERWISE, IT'S ANOTHER
5 BUCKS FOR THE SUIT.

1612
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,382
OHH.

1613
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:43,135
DON'T PANIC.

1614
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:44,807
EVEN GINGER
WAS NERVOUS

1615
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,635
THE FIRST TIME
SHE DANCED WITH ME.

1616
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:59,113
â™ªâ™ª HOW ABOUT YOU? â™ªâ™ª

1617
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:03,411
â™ªâ™ª I LIKE A GERSHWIN TUNE â™ªâ™ª

1618
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:06,827
â™ªâ™ª HOW ABOUT YOU? â™ªâ™ª

1619
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:09,867
â™ªâ™ª I LIKE A FIREPLACE â™ªâ™ª

1620
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:13,672
â™ªâ™ª WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE LOW â™ªâ™ª

1621
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:18,007
â™ªâ™ª I LIKE POTATO CHIPS,
MOONLIGHT, AND MOTOR TRIPS â™ªâ™ª

1622
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:21,425
â™ªâ™ª HOW ABOUT YOU? â™ªâ™ª

1623
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,351
WHAT ARE YOU
CRYING ABOUT?

1624
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:27,346
SO KILL ME.

1625
01:26:27,558 --> 01:26:31,388
I'M A SUCKER
FOR ROMANCE.

1626
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:34,273
ELLIOT GARFIELD
IS A MANY-FACETED INDIVIDUAL.

1627
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:39,436
I GOT A JOB.

1628
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,359
A REAL JOB
A REAL ACTING JOB.

1629
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:44,663
YOU DID?
WHERE?

1630
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,447
IT'S IN A PLACE CALLED
"THE INVENTORY,"

1631
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,700
IT'S AN IMPROVISATIONAL GROUP.

1632
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:50,332
THEY SAW RICHARD III.

1633
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:53,619
THEY SAID IF I COULD DO THAT,
I COULD DO ANYTHING.

1634
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:57,206
OH, NO,
DON'T LET IT RAIN!

1635
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:00,801
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THE SUIT'S
TOO BIG FOR ME ANYWAY.

1636
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:04,892
I AUDITIONED
FOR THEM TODAY.

1637
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,045
IT'S IMPROVISATION,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

1638
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,394
VERY DIFFICULT.

1639
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:10,429
BUT I AUDITIONED WITH
THIS TALENTED GIRL, LINDA.

1640
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:11,482
REALLY TALENTED GIRL

1641
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:12,845
IS SHE PRETTY?

1642
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,861
NO, NO, VERY UN PRETTY.
VERY UGLY.

1643
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,694
UNPUG NOSE.

1644
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,280
I PLAYED ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
MARY TODD LINCOLN'S OUT OF TOWN.

1645
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,855
GENERAL GRANT TAKES ME
TO A CAT HOUSE IN VIRGINIA.

1646
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,741
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO ACT
VERY DIGNIFIED--

1647
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,790
OH, DON'T STOP!
I NEVER DANCED IN THE RAIN.

1648
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,629
THE HELL WITH THE DANCING
MY PIZZA'S GETTING DRENCHED!

1649
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,384
WAIT, WAIT!

1650
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:40,878
I GOT IT.

1651
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,509
I'LL GET IT.

1652
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,336
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT

1653
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,051
THIS OTHER GIRL
AND TONY?

1654
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,391
BOBBY.
TONY COMES AFTER BOBBY.

1655
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:51,176
OH, SORRY.

1656
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:55,391
WELL, IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
ON THE ROAD.

1657
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:58,984
HE'S GONE FOR SIX MONTHS
WITH A PLAY, HE GETS LONELY.

1658
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:01,031
THE ONLY TIME YOU HAVE
A GOOD MARRIAGE

1659
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:02,895
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
IS IN A FLOP.

1660
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:07,321
HE'S BROKE,
BUT HE'S HOME.

1661
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:10,332
HOW DID YOU MEET TONY?

1662
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,995
I'M ASHAMED
TO TELL YOU.

1663
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:14,365
WHY?

1664
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I SAW HIM IN
THE ICEMAN COMETH.

1665
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:24,843
HE WASN'T VERY GOOD,
BUT HE WAS GORGEOUS.

1666
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,640
I COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES
OFF OF HIM.

1667
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:31,305
DON'T ASK.

1668
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,845
I WAITED UNTIL
AFTER THE SHOW,

1669
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,849
AND I INTRODUCED MYSELF,

1670
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,561
LIKE A REGULAR GROUPIE.

1671
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:42,279
A WEEK LATER,
I MOVED IN WITH HIM.

1672
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,364
I USED TO DO
THINGS LIKE THAT.

1673
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:45,899
WHY?

1674
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:50,990
WELL, WHEN YOU DANCE
IN MUSICALS,

1675
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:53,871
THE BOYS' VOICES ARE USUALLY
HIGHER THAN THE GIRLS.'

1676
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:57,369
YOU GET HUNG UP
ON MACHO MEN.

1677
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,752
THANK GOD
I'M OVER THAT PERIOD.

1678
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,341
I'LL LET
THAT REMARK PASS.

1679
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,761
ARE WE GOING TO SLEEP
WITH EACH OTHER TONIGHT?

1680
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,717
OF ALL THE UP-FRONT
GIRLS I KNOW,

1681
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,892
YOU ARE
THE RIGHT UP-FRONTEST.

1682
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,359
HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT IT?

1683
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:24,817
NERVOUS.

1684
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:26,897
A PUSHOVER,
BUT NERVOUS.

1685
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,551
GOOD MORNING,
EVERYBODY.

1686
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:54,974
NO APPLAUSE,
PLEASE.

1687
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:10,819
WHAT'S NEW THIS MORNING?

1688
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:19,616
NOTHING'S NEW
THIS MORNING.

1689
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:22,081
OKAY.

1690
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,132
HEY DID YOU HEAR
OF THIS KID LINDBERGH

1691
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:28,256
WHO'S GOING TO TRY
TO FLY THE ATLANTIC.

1692
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:30,835
WHO DO YOU THINK IS GONNA PLAY
IN THE MOVIE?

1693
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,511
SHE DIDN'T
SLEEP WELL.

1694
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,219
I GUESS NO ONE DID.

1695
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:37,006
SEE YOU
TONIGHT.

1696
01:30:42,396 --> 01:30:44,516
WE'VE BEEN
FOUND OUT, HAVE WE?

1697
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,071
I THOUGHT THE KID
WAS ROOTING FOR US.

1698
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,645
SHE DOESN'T LIKE
TO BE CALLED "KID."

1699
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:54,447
OH, SORRY.
IN CHICAGO,

1700
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:55,908
IT'S AN EXPRESSION
OF ENDEARMENT.

1701
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:57,908
LIKE HOW ARE YOU
DOING, KID?

1702
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,040
WHAT'S WRONG, KID?

1703
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:00,656
NOTHING.

1704
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,752
REALLY?

1705
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,708
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

1706
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,249
ANY BUTTERED TOAST?

1707
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,342
SHE'S SCARED,
THAT'S ALL.

1708
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:10,668
LUCY, HUH?

1709
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:13,092
SHE'S AFRAID WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

1710
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,141
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU TWO,
ARE YOU PARTNERS?

1711
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:17,926
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST
YOU AND ME LAST NIGHT.

1712
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,680
WHAT HAPPENS IN MY LIFE
AFFECTS HERS,

1713
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,693
AND I AM SCARED, TOO.

1714
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,595
LISTEN, WOULD YOU BE
TERRIBLY HURT

1715
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,824
IF WE FORGET
LAST NIGHT?

1716
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:32,653
IT'S A LITTLE LATE, I'VE ALREADY
ENTERED IN MY DIARY.

1717
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:35,453
LOOK AT ME, I'M STANDING HERE
WITH SWEATY PALMS,

1718
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,907
AND MY HANDS
ARE IN COLD WATER.

1719
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:40,829
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

1720
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:42,077
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

1721
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:44,249
INSTEAD OF ASKING,
SO GOD DAMN MANY QUESTIONS

1722
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:47,288
YOU COULD AT LEAST SAY TO ME
LAST NIGHT WAS WONDERFUL.

1723
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:48,842
LAST NIGHT
WAS WONDERFUL.

1724
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:52,505
OH, MY GOD,
I MUST BE CRAZY.

1725
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,966
I KEEP DOING
THE SAME DAMN THING TO MYSELF

1726
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:58,427
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
WHEN AM I EVER GONNA LEARN?

1727
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:01,558
LISTEN, I AM NOT UP TO
FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN.

1728
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,306
IT'S TOO MUCH WORK.

1729
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,098
I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE
A WHOLE LOT BETTER OFF

1730
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:08,613
IF YOU JUST LEFT.

1731
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:10,515
NOTHING PERSONAL.

1732
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:19,829
HEY! I THINK I HAVE A CLUE NOW
AS TO WHY ALL THOSE GUYS LEFT.

1733
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,655
CRACKERS!
ANIMAL CRACKERS, LADY.

1734
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,001
YOU GOT
A SEVERE CASE

1735
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:25,996
OF EMOTIONAL
RETARDATION.

1736
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:28,378
I'M NOT LEAVING,
PAULA.

1737
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:31,665
I'M ESCAPING.

1738
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,920
I WILL PERSONALLY
FORWARD YOUR MAIL.

1739
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:36,052
KEEP IT.

1740
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:38,719
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
A FORWARDING ADDRESS.

1741
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:40,009
LOTS OF WEIRDOES
AROUND.

1742
01:32:40,222 --> 01:32:41,352
JUST IN PASSING,

1743
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,886
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT
LAST NIGHT WAS TERRIFIC.

1744
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,680
IT WAS THE SUPER BOWL
OF ROMANCE.

1745
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:48,484
I GIVE IT A FAT 9,
ON A SCALE OF 10.

1746
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,558
YOU LOSE ONE POINT
FOR BURPING YOUR WINE.

1747
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,194
IT WAS A VERY RESPECTABLE SCORE.

1748
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,190
DON'T YOU GET GLIB,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

1749
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,742
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO
ME.

1750
01:32:56,947 --> 01:32:59,527
YOU WANNA LOWER YOUR NEUROSIS,
FOR ONE MINUTE I'M NOT FINISHED.

1751
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:01,371
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

1752
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,326
WHAT?

1753
01:33:02,536 --> 01:33:04,286
YOU LOVE
TO LOVE SOMEBODY,

1754
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:06,036
BUT WHEN THEY
TAKE THE INITIATIVE,

1755
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:07,668
LIKE I DID LAST NIGHT,

1756
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:09,294
THAT SCARES
THE PANTS OFF YOU.

1757
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,881
NOTHING OFF-COLOR
INTENDED.

1758
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:14,707
YOU DIDN'T WAIT AT ANY STAGE
DOOR FOR ME, YOU KNOW.

1759
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:15,713
I APPROACHED FIRST.

1760
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,054
I TOUCHED FIRST.

1761
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:19,299
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT
CAN YOU?

1762
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:20,391
HE'S LAUGHABLE.

1763
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,795
HA HA.

1764
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:23,933
AND SILLY, YOU ARE
A SILLY MAN.

1765
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,060
YOU ARE THE SILLIEST
MAN I EVER MET.

1766
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:27,808
YOU KNOW THAT I'M RIGHT.

1767
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:33,357
IF YOU DON'T LET GOOF ME, I AM
GONNA PUNCH YOUR OTHER EYE OUT.

1768
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:36,147
YOU KNOW YOURSELF TOO WELL
TO IGNORE WHAT I AM SAYING.

1769
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:41,571
THAT'S WHY I'M
TRYING TO IGNORE IT.

1770
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:46,083
DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
ONE LARGE PAIN IN THE ARSE,

1771
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:48,658
LAST NIGHT WAS THE BEST THING
THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

1772
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,293
IF YOU WEREN'T BEHAVING
LIKE SUCH A HORSE'S RECTUM,

1773
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:54,091
YOU'D KNOW THAT WE COULD BE
TOUCHING AND FONDLING ALL DAY

1774
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:56,706
TILL I GOT TO GO
TO REHEARSAL.

1775
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:01,221
PERSONALLY, MADAM,
I THINK YOU BLEW IT.

1776
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:33,002
LADY ANNE! LADY ANNE!
THE BLACK PRINCE IS DEAD.

1777
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:34,419
ENGLAND IS YOURS.

1778
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,666
YOU DON'T WANT ENGLAND?
WOULD YOU TAKE SPAIN?

1779
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:40,222
SPAIN I CAN GET YOU CHEAP.

1780
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:42,005
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THAT THING?

1781
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:45,258
COME ON. GET IN, QUICK.
HORSE IS GOT A METER ON HIM.

1782
01:34:45,472 --> 01:34:46,682
WHERE TO?

1783
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:50,770
WE'RE GOING HOME
TO TARA. GET IN!

1784
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:54,232
CYNTHIA FEIN, RIGHT?

1785
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,860
I THINK YOU GOT
CHARISMA, TOO.

1786
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:00,187
LUCY, DID YOU TELL HIM?
I NEVER SAID THAT.

1787
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:02,283
I'M GONNA GET YOU LUCY, YOU BIG
FINK!

1788
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,157
WANT TO GO
TO MY OPENING, TONIGHT?

1789
01:35:11,373 --> 01:35:13,753
I OWE YOU A GOOD TIME
AFTER THE LAST ONE.

1790
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,628
I HAVE HOMEWORK.

1791
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,915
WHAT ARE YOU SORE ABOUT
ME AND YOUR MOM?

1792
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:21,669
IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

1793
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,683
SINCE YOU AND I ARE
EXCHANGING ROOMS TONIGHT,

1794
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:26,255
I THINK IT IS.
ONLY I'M A LITTLE OLD FASHION

1795
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,641
I WANT YOUR APPROVAL.

1796
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,467
ME? I'M ONLY 10.

1797
01:35:29,683 --> 01:35:32,313
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO VOTE YET.

1798
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:34,349
I LIKE YOUR STYLE, KID
I REALLY DO.

1799
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:36,362
SORRY, YOU DON'T LIKE
TO BE CALLED "KID."

1800
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,444
I'M A KID.
IT FITS.

1801
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:40,572
DO YOU LIKE ME?

1802
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,357
YOU'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY,
I'M NOT ENJOYING THIS RIDE.

1803
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:46,531
ANSWER MY QUESTION.
DO YOU LIKE ME?

1804
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,871
ASK CYNTHIA FEIN.
SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

1805
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,947
I'LL KEEP ASKING YOU,
UNTIL YOU ANSWER ME.

1806
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:53,213
DO YOU LIKE ME?

1807
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:54,745
CAN I GET OUT?
IM GETTING--

1808
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,958
ANSWER MY QUESTION,
YES OR NO?

1809
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:59,548
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

1810
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,844
CAUSE I'M MOVING IN
WITH YOUR OLD LADY ANYWAY.

1811
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,878
I WANNA HEAR IT
FROM YOUR OWN LIPS.

1812
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:04,882
NOW YES OR NO?

1813
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:06,013
NO.

1814
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:09,514
YES.

1815
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:12,983
WAS THAT A YES?

1816
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,314
YES.

1817
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:16,349
A REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY LOT?

1818
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:18,403
YES, ALRIGHT?

1819
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:19,476
OKAY.

1820
01:36:21,735 --> 01:36:23,855
AS MUCH AS YOU
LIKE ME,

1821
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,860
IT'S NOT
A THOUSANDTH AS MUCH

1822
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:28,662
AS I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
I SWEAR TO GOD LUCY.

1823
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:30,697
YOU CAN CRY.
I DON'T CARE.

1824
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:31,910
I'LL TELL YOU ANYWAY.

1825
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:35,080
I AM CERTIFIABLY NUTS
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MOM.

1826
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:36,500
BLOW THAT INTO
YOUR HANDKERCHIEF.

1827
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:37,998
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

1828
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,499
SO CRY
ON THE HORSEY.

1829
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:43,006
OKAY?

1830
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:49,223
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT MORE
THAN ANYTHING ELSE

1831
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:52,059
IN THE WHOLE WORLD?

1832
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:55,385
MY VERY OWN
LIVING ROOM SET.

1833
01:36:55,602 --> 01:36:57,232
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A NICE FEELING

1834
01:36:57,437 --> 01:36:59,397
TO HEAR REAL PEOPLE
APPLAUDING.

1835
01:36:59,606 --> 01:37:01,266
I TOOK THE NAMES,
AND ADDRESSES

1836
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:03,113
OF EVERYONE
IN THE AUDIENCE.

1837
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,988
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THEM OVER
FOR DINNER, REAL SOON.

1838
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:09,406
WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO REPAINT
THE BEDROOM, DON'T YOU THINK?

1839
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:11,742
WHAT?

1840
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:13,991
I'M REDECORATING.

1841
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:16,214
WHAT COLOR SHOULD WE
PAINT THE BEDROOM?

1842
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:22,212
SUCCESSFUL.

1843
01:37:24,798 --> 01:37:25,878
THAT'S GOOD.

1844
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:38,156
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

1845
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:41,001
IT DIDN'T
COME OUT RIGHT.

1846
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:44,077
ELLIOT, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH IT?

1847
01:38:44,294 --> 01:38:46,634
FIRST PLACE, IT'S NOT ON PARK
AVENUE.

1848
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:48,918
HOW MANY MORE WEEKS
DO YOU HAVE TO PLAY

1849
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:50,972
BEFORE I COULD GET
AN ARMCHAIR?

1850
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:54,925
FOR ONE WITHOUT ARMS,
ABOUT A YEAR.

1851
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,678
MAMA BEAR DID
THE CAVE REAL NICE.

1852
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,850
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1853
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:03,101
HEY.

1854
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:07,105
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

1855
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:08,647
I'M VERY FOND
OF YOU MYSELF.

1856
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,820
YOU HAVE
SOME NICE QUALITIES.

1857
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:13,738
LEAVE TUESDAY MORNING OPEN.

1858
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,568
WHY, WHAT'S TUESDAY?

1859
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,953
HOW DO BLOOD TESTS
STRIKE YOU?

1860
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:29,554
AAH!

1861
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:39,353
FOUR STARS!

1862
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:40,717
IT WAS A GREAT AUDIENCE.

1863
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:41,934
A FOUR-STAR SHOW.

1864
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,273
I WANNA TAKE THE SHOW
HOME AND BOTTLE IT.

1865
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,519
I WANT TO GO HOME
AND SLEEP TILL WEDNESDAY.

1866
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,572
HEY, ED, THERE
IS NO AIR IN HERE.

1867
01:39:49,776 --> 01:39:51,066
I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

1868
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:52,647
GIVE THE ACTORS
SOME AIR!

1869
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:54,152
WE ARE
HUMAN BEINGS,

1870
01:39:54,364 --> 01:39:55,364
NOT CATTLE!

1871
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:56,913
LET'S HEAR IT
FOR THE ACTORS!

1872
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:57,946
YAY!

1873
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,739
LET'S HEAR IT
FOR THE ACTORS.

1874
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:08,499
HELLO.

1875
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,881
WHO IS THAT?

1876
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:13,379
HELLO.
OLIVER FRY.

1877
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,341
OLIVER FRY
THE DIRECTOR?

1878
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:16,891
I BELIEVE SO.

1879
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,387
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

1880
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:21,887
OLIVER FRY--
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1881
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,180
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN?
HERE, UH...

1882
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:26,654
YEAH, COME ON IN.
HI.

1883
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:27,694
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

1884
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:29,307
HI, IT'S VERY NICE TO--

1885
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:30,614
WE WON'T KEEP YOU.

1886
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:31,977
THERE WAS JUST
ONE QUESTION

1887
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:33,903
I WANTED TO ASK.

1888
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:35,902
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN A MOVIE?

1889
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:37,704
YOU MEAN
MAKING ONE?

1890
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:40,698
OR WE COULD
GO TO ONE,

1891
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:42,950
BUT I THINK WORKING
IS MUCH MORE FUN.

1892
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,120
WITH YOU?

1893
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:48,212
YES. YES, I'M--
I'M INTERESTED.

1894
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:49,328
I AM, TOO.

1895
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,344
ARE YOU KIDDING?
HA HA HA HA.

1896
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,376
CERTAINLY.
YEAH, SURE. MM-HMM.

1897
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,220
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

1898
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:59,796
YOU DIDN'T LOCK YOURSELF
OUT AGAIN, DID YOU?

1899
01:41:00,013 --> 01:41:02,013
LUCY, WHAT IS IT?

1900
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:05,603
AT LEAST WE DIDN'T GET
A LETTER THIS TIME.

1901
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:26,289
SENDING THAT STUFF
TO THE LAUNDRY, I HOPE.

1902
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:28,787
I GOT A PICTURE,
PAULA.

1903
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,250
I GOT A PICTURE,
I GOT A MOVIE.

1904
01:41:32,462 --> 01:41:33,922
OH, SHIT.

1905
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,880
TERRIFIC PICTURE.
OLIVER FRY IS DIRECTING.

1906
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,931
I GOT TO BE ON LOCATION
IN SEATTLE TOMORROW.

1907
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:41,596
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.

1908
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:44,394
I KNOW.
IT'S FAR AWAY.

1909
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:47,679
WHO CARES?
I'M NOT WALKING.

1910
01:41:47,894 --> 01:41:51,774
THERE'S A FIRST-CLASS TICKET
AT THE AIRPORT FOR ME.

1911
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:54,781
FOUR WEEKS' WORK,
$2,000 A WEEK.

1912
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:59,244
I MEAN, IT'S
FREAKING OLIVER FRY!

1913
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,277
I DIDN'T ASK
WHAT THE PART WAS.

1914
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:03,911
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

1915
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,788
I'M NOT MAKING ANY
COMPARISONS, YOU KNOW.

1916
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:08,075
WHO EVER HEARD OF AL PACINO
BEFORE THE GODFATHER?

1917
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:09,829
I'M COULDN'T BE
HAPPIER FOR YOU.

1918
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,127
JESUS, I AM SO SCARED.

1919
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:16,706
I SPENT 20 YEARS BUILDING UP MY
EGO, AND WHEN I REALLY NEED IT

1920
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:18,133
IT LOCKED IN THE JOHN.

1921
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:20,431
IT WILL COME BACK TO YOU, TRUST
ME.

1922
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:22,465
WHAT'S WRONG?

1923
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:24,428
IT'S ONLY FOUR WEEKS.

1924
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:26,389
THAT'S ONE WEEK
LESS THAN FIVE.

1925
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:28,809
I KNOW.

1926
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:30,728
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW.

1927
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:33,267
YOU THINK YOU'LL
GET DUMPED ON AGAIN.

1928
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:34,771
IF YOU SAY
YOU'LL BE BACK,

1929
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:36,072
WHY SHOULDN'T I
BELIEVE YOU?

1930
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,605
IF I WERE YOU, AND I SAW AN
ACTOR PACKING,

1931
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:41,240
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM EITHER.

1932
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:51,832
YOU NEED ANY HELP?

1933
01:42:56,963 --> 01:42:59,343
NO, I SEE
YOU TOOK EVERYTHING.

1934
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:03,299
WELL, THEY SAID
IT WOULD BE FREEZING,

1935
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:08,351
TAKE ALL MY WARM CLOTHING.

1936
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:11,348
YOU KNOW I WOULD TAKE YOU
IF I COULD,

1937
01:43:11,561 --> 01:43:13,101
BUT IT'S ROUGH COUNTRY
UP THERE.

1938
01:43:13,312 --> 01:43:15,152
IT'S UP IN THE MOUNTAINS.
THERE ARE WOLVES.

1939
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:16,936
I DON'T MEAN
IN THE MOVIE, EITHER.

1940
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:19,610
I MEAN REAL HUNGRY WOLVES.

1941
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:22,319
I ALWAYS GOT ALONG
WITH WOLVES.

1942
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:26,280
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE EXCITED.
JUMPING UP AND DOWN.

1943
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:29,332
IT'S WHAT I'VE WORKED
FOR MY WHOLE LIFE.

1944
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:31,617
ISN'T THAT WHAT A MATURE
RELATIONSHIP IS ALL ABOUT.

1945
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:33,671
I ROOT FOR YOU,
YOU ROOT FOR ME.

1946
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:36,285
IT'S MY THIRD TIME UP
AS CHEERLEADER.

1947
01:43:36,502 --> 01:43:38,462
OKAY, OKAY!
I GET THE POINT.

1948
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:41,419
FORGET IT.
I'M NOT GOING.

1949
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:42,762
IT'S NOT WORTH IT

1950
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:46,087
NOT IF IT MEANS I GOTTA PUT YOU
THROUGH FOUR WEEKS OF HELL

1951
01:43:46,304 --> 01:43:49,264
WONDERING WHETHER I'M COMING
BACK OR NOT, FORGET IT.

1952
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:52,603
IT'S JUST A JOB, RIGHT?
HELL WITH IT.

1953
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:55,190
IF I GOT THIS JOB,
I CAN GET ANOTHER JOB.

1954
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:57,186
I'M NOT GONNA GO, OKAY?

1955
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,648
THE HELL I WON'T GO!
THAT'S CRAZY.

1956
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:02,689
THAT'S A DUMB STUPID THING TO
DO, BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

1957
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:05,534
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME
PAULA, DO YOU TRUST ME?

1958
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,530
I'LL PLAN MY DAYS
AROUND IT.

1959
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:11,583
I HATE THOSE GUYS THAT WALKED
OUT OF HERE, I HATE THEM.

1960
01:44:11,787 --> 01:44:14,707
I'M THE ONE THAT'S COMING BACK,
AND I'M GETTING ALL THE BLAME.

1961
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,884
NO. YOU GO, ELLIOT.

1962
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,008
I WANT YOU TO GO.

1963
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:26,086
IF YOU COME BACK, FINE. I'LL BE
HERE PUTTING UP MY WALLPAPER.

1964
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:29,052
IF NOT,
THAT'S OKAY, TOO.

1965
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:31,353
I'LL MISS YOU.

1966
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:34,597
BUT I'LL SURVIVE
BECAUSE I'VE GROWN UP

1967
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:35,940
THESE LAST
COUPLE MONTHS.

1968
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:39,555
LOOK AT ME.
I'M ALL GROWN UP.

1969
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,694
IT WAS BETTER
THAN SUMMER CAMP.

1970
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:44,741
I NEVER FELT, BETTER
OR STRONGER.

1971
01:44:44,946 --> 01:44:46,446
SOMEONE IS
WALKING OUT THAT DOOR,

1972
01:44:46,656 --> 01:44:49,696
AND I'M NOT CRUMBLING
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

1973
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:54,829
WELL, JESUS,
IT REALLY DOES FEEL GOOD.

1974
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:57,329
GOOD-BYE, ELLIOT.

1975
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:08,047
MAKE A NICE MOVIE,
A WONDERFUL CAREER.

1976
01:45:08,261 --> 01:45:10,101
IF YOU'RE EVER UP
FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD,

1977
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,684
I PROMISE YOU, I'LL KEEP MY
FINGERS CROSSED FOR YOU.

1978
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:17,770
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU THAT MAKE'S
A MAN WITH A 147 I.Q.

1979
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:19,729
FEEL LIKE
A DRIBBLING IDIOT?

1980
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:23,069
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHATEVER
IT IS I THANK GOD FOR IT.

1981
01:45:24,485 --> 01:45:25,605
YOU'RE WELCOME, GOD.

1982
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:29,528
INTERESTING LESSON
I'M LEARNING.

1983
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,620
REALLY INTERESTING.

1984
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:34,196
THIS COULD BE THE FALLING IN
LOVE AND BECOMING SUCCESSFUL

1985
01:45:34,412 --> 01:45:38,252
IS PROBABLY THE WORST THING
THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO A GUY.

1986
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:42,167
IF MY PLANE CRASHES IN THE
STORM, I'M COMING BACK HERE.

1987
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:45,458
I MEAN IT.
I MEAN IT.

1988
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:48,223
YOU'LL BE DRAGGING CHAINS AROUND
THIS APARTMENT WHEN YOU'RE 90.

1989
01:45:57,059 --> 01:45:58,099
SO LONG, KID.

1990
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:01,522
I'LL SEE YOU, KID.

1991
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:19,371
I CAN'T SLEEP.

1992
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:20,542
GIVE IT FIVE MINUTES.

1993
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,750
YOU JUST GOT INTO BED.

1994
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,250
I CAN PREDICT
THE FUTURE.

1995
01:46:25,463 --> 01:46:27,053
YEAH?

1996
01:46:27,256 --> 01:46:28,666
HOW ABOUT
PREDICTING MINE?

1997
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:35,014
I CAN PREDICT
THE PHONE RINGING.

1998
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:39,015
HELLO.

1999
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:40,556
GET DRESSED.

2000
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:41,560
WHAT?

2001
01:46:41,771 --> 01:46:44,111
GET DRESSED,
YOU'RE COME WITH ME.

2002
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:45,565
WHERE ARE YOU?

2003
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:48,355
ON THE CORNER, IN MY OLD,
LEAKY PHONE BOOTH.

2004
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:51,609
OH, ELLIOT!
ELLIOT!

2005
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:55,534
THE PLANE HAD ENGINE TROUBLE,
WE'RE DELAYED TWO HOURS.

2006
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:58,873
I CASTED IN FIRST-CLASS
FOR TWO ECONOMIES.

2007
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,040
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT LUCY?

2008
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,709
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT LUCY.

2009
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:06,538
CALL DONNA, SHE CAN STAY
WITH HER, TILL WE GET BACK.

2010
01:47:06,754 --> 01:47:10,304
COME ON, PAULA THE CAB IS
TICKING AWAY YOUR BEDROOM SET.

2011
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:13,388
I THOUGHT I COULDN'T
COME WITH YOU.

2012
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:16,934
I'LL TELL THEM
YOU'RE MY ANALYST.

2013
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,969
AND YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO COME?

2014
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:22,443
OH, JESUS YOU SURE LOVE
A LOVE SCENE.

2015
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:25,055
YEAH,
I WANT YOU TO COME.

2016
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:27,942
OH, THEN IT'S OKAY,
I DON'T HAVE TO!

2017
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:30,240
JUST AS LONG
AS YOU ASKED!

2018
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:32,074
PAULA, DON'T PLAY GAMES.

2019
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:33,659
MY SOCKS ARE
UNDER WATER.

2020
01:47:33,864 --> 01:47:35,374
NO, YOU HAVE ENOUGH WORK

2021
01:47:35,574 --> 01:47:37,284
WITHOUT WORRYING
ABOUT ME.

2022
01:47:37,493 --> 01:47:39,373
BESIDES,
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

2023
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:42,078
I AM GOING TO BE
SPENDING YOUR MONEY

2024
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:46,789
ON OUR APARTMENT.
I AM NUTS ABOUT YOU.

2025
01:47:47,002 --> 01:47:50,592
I HOPE I'M CALLING
THE RIGHT NUMBER.

2026
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:53,258
WILL YOU DO ME
A FAVOR?

2027
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,297
ANYTHING, MY ANGEL.

2028
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,141
HAVE MY GUITAR
RESTRUNG.

2029
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:58,296
OHH!

2030
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:01,103
HE LEFT HIS GUITAR!

2031
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:02,678
HE IS COMING BACK.

2032
01:48:02,893 --> 01:48:05,103
I NEVER DOUBTED IT.

2033
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:06,232
WAIT. OH, MY GOD!

2034
01:48:06,439 --> 01:48:07,769
ELLIOT, ELLIOT!

2035
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:11,992
ELLIOT, WAIT!

2036
01:48:12,194 --> 01:48:14,074
I HAVE IT, SWEETHEART.

2037
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,070
HAVE A SAFE TRIP.

2038
01:48:16,282 --> 01:48:17,822
I LOVE YOU !

2039
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:21,123
NEVER MIND THAT,
YOU'RE RUSTING MY GUITAR.

2040
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:24,618
â™ªâ™ª ALL YOUR LIFE
YOU'VE WAITED â™ªâ™ª

2041
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:29,092
â™ªâ™ª FOR LOVE TO
COME AND STAY â™ªâ™ª

2042
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:33,085
â™ªâ™ª AND NOW THAT
I HAVE FOUND YOU â™ªâ™ª

2043
01:48:33,299 --> 01:48:37,469
â™ªâ™ª YOU MUST NOT SLIP AWAY â™ªâ™ª

2044
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:40,968
â™ªâ™ª I KNOW
IT'S HARD BELIEVING â™ªâ™ª

2045
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:45,642
â™ªâ™ª THE WORDS
YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE â™ªâ™ª

2046
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:52,483
â™ªâ™ª BUT, DARLING, YOU MUST
TRUST THEM JUST ONCE MORE â™ªâ™ª

2047
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:58,203
â™ªâ™ª BECAUSE, BABY, GOOD-BYE
DOESN'T MEAN FOREVER â™ªâ™ª

2048
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:05,209
â™ªâ™ª LET ME TELL YOU GOOD-BYE
DOESN'T MEAN â™ªâ™ª

2049
01:49:05,414 --> 01:49:08,584
â™ªâ™ª WE'LL NEVER
BE TOGETHER AGAIN â™ªâ™ª

2050
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:13,134
â™ªâ™ª IF YOU WAKE UP
AND I'M NOT THERE â™ªâ™ª

2051
01:49:13,339 --> 01:49:17,129
â™ªâ™ª I WON'T BE LONG AWAY â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª MY GOOD-BYE GIRL â™ªâ™ª

2054
01:49:21,347 --> 01:49:25,637
â™ªâ™ª WILL BRING ME
BACK TO YOU â™ªâ™ª

2055
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:29,021
â™ªâ™ª I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN TAKEN â™ªâ™ª

2056
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:33,150
â™ªâ™ª AFRAID TO HURT AGAIN â™ªâ™ª

2057
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:36,899
â™ªâ™ª YOU FIGHT THE LOVE
YOU FEEL FOR ME â™ªâ™ª

2058
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:41,372
â™ªâ™ª INSTEAD OF GIVING IN â™ªâ™ª

2059
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:45,285
â™ªâ™ª BUT I CAN WAIT FOREVER â™ªâ™ª

2060
01:49:45,496 --> 01:49:49,706
â™ªâ™ª I'M HELPING YOU TO SEE â™ªâ™ª

2061
01:49:49,917 --> 01:49:56,507
â™ªâ™ª THAT I WAS MEANT FOR YOU
AND YOU FOR ME â™ªâ™ª

2062
01:49:56,715 --> 01:50:03,005
â™ªâ™ª SO REMEMBER GOOD-BYE
DOESN'T MEAN FOREVER â™ªâ™ª

2063
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:08,015
â™ªâ™ª LET ME TELL YOU GOOD-BYE â™ªâ™ª

2064
01:50:08,227 --> 01:50:14,397
â™ªâ™ª DOESN'T MEAN WE'LL NEVER
BE TOGETHER AGAIN â™ªâ™ª

2065
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:17,528
â™ªâ™ª THOUGH WE MAY BE
SO FAR APART â™ªâ™ª

2066
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:21,026
â™ªâ™ª WE STILL HAVE GONE FAR â™ªâ™ª

2067
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:26,120
â™ªâ™ª SO FORGET YOUR PAST,
MY GOOD-BYE GIRL â™ªâ™ª

2068
