1
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:57,375
You heard 'bout the legend
of Jesse James

2
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:00,003
And John Henry
just to mention some names

3
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,548
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend
in the South today

4
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:07,177
A man called Bandit
from Atlanta, Ga.

5
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:09,971
Every gearjammer
knows his name

6
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:13,349
They swear he got asphalt
a-runnin' in his veins

7
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:16,311
A foot like lead
and nerves like steel

8
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,106
He's gonna go to glory
ridin' 18 wheels

9
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:21,941
Oh, boy

10
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:25,403
He left Atlanta back in '63

11
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,281
Haulin' him a load
up to Tennessee

12
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:31,451
He hit Mount Eeale
in a drivin' rain

13
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:34,412
So hard he couldn't even see
the passin' lane

14
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,707
Well, he started down the grade
when he lost a gear

15
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:41,252
He hit them brakes,
found he had no air

16
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:44,130
The Mount Eeale grade
is steep and long

17
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:48,009
And everybody that seen it
thought the Bandit was gone

18
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,594
All gone

19
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:53,139
Well, his truck jack-knifed
turned completely around

20
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:56,226
He was comin' down backwards
'bout the speed of sound

21
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:59,270
A lot of folks seen him
and they all say

22
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:02,482
He had his head out the window
yellin', "Clear the way!"

23
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,527
Well, he got to the bottom
safe and sound

24
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:08,530
Everybody asked Bandit
how he made it down

25
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,658
He said, "Folks, when the truck
picked up too much speed

26
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:15,620
"I just run along beside it
and drug my feet"

27
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:18,873
Ya heard the legend
of Jesse James

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,209
And John Henry
just to mention some names

29
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:24,838
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend
in the South today

30
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:28,550
A man called Bandit
from Atlanta, Ga.

31
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,219
Every gearjammer
knows his name

32
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:34,347
They swear he's got asphalt
a-runnin' in his veins

33
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:37,725
A foot like lead
and nerves like steel

34
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:41,062
He's goin' up to glory
ridin' 18 wheels

35
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,065
Ah, tell me, boy

36
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:49,237
Talk to me, guitar

37
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,918
Hey, Kirk. How ya doin'?

38
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:06,337
Tod Engels. How are ya?

39
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,052
- This your rig, son?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,638
Open it up. Let's see the manifest.

41
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:28,943
Well, placin' you under arrest
for transportin' alcoholic beverages

42
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,529
across state lines
without the proper permits.

43
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:34,032
And that means you,
you dumb cowboy.

44
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,869
You know truckin' Coors beer
east of Texas is bootleggin'.

45
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:41,706
- This here's Georgia, son.
- Just a friendly bet.

46
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:44,375
These two old boys put me up to it.

47
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,586
Now, when ya gonna learn?

48
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:51,341
Big and Little Enos Burdette make that
same bet with every gearjammer they can.

49
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,468
I say he ain't gonna go
for your game.

50
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:58,223
Son, from what I've heard, the biggest
thing about the Bandit is his ego,

51
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:03,812
and I figure that plus a lot of my dollars,
and he'll try anything, legal or not.

52
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:08,566
They've put on quite a show
for us today, haven't they, friends?

53
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:14,197
Yes, sir, you have seen some of
the finest gearjammin' in all of this country.

54
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:19,494
Remember, these are the boys that take
the long hauls. They really did it today.

55
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:26,251
- Hoss... Where might I find the Bandit?
- I ain't seen him.

56
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:28,545
- Over there behind his rig.
- Who wants to see him?

57
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:30,547
- Who's askin'?
- I'm askin'.

58
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:34,884
'Cause I'm the guy payin' him $25 a day
so all his loyal fans can look at him.

59
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,804
Do it.

60
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:42,851
I'm buyin' your attraction
for a half an hour.

61
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,651
Egotistical son of a bitch.

62
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:57,198
A guy that paints his truck like this would go
to a minister's funeral dressed in feathers.

63
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:02,579
See, son? Old legends
never die. They just lose weight.

64
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:06,875
Seems like a legend and an out-of-work
bum look a lot alike, Daddy.

65
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,087
Bandit, me and my son are here.

66
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:18,219
Oh, I love your suits.

67
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:23,057
It must be a bitch gettin' a size
68 extra-fat and a 12 dwarf.

68
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:28,229
I came to make a deal. What's he get
if he wins this truck rodeo thing?

69
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,357
-  If?!
- $5,000, Daddy.

70
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:35,070
- Chicken-shit money.
- Just what the hell you want, anyway?

71
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:39,783
You to get out of this dumb-ass rodeo
and accept a real challenge.

72
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:50,251
Gettin' to Texarkana and back
in 28 hours, that's no problem.

73
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:54,798
- It ain't never been done before, hotshit.
- Watch your language, little lady.

74
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:57,342
The problem is that Coors beer.

75
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,013
You take that east of Texas
and that's, uh... that's bootleggin'.

76
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,891
I believe you're just a little bit scared.

77
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:08,144
Great psychology. Why don't you say
somethin' bad about my mother?

78
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:11,564
- Your mama is so ugly...
- Look, you make this run for me.

79
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:14,317
These Peterbilts are worth $80,000.

80
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:19,948
That comes to about three grand
an hour if you make it in 28 hours.

81
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:22,450
How about that for a challenge?

82
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:25,161
- Dad, I don't believe that that's necess...
- Never mind.

83
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,872
Wait a minute. Why do you
want that beer so bad?

84
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,708
Because he's thirsty, dummy.

85
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,462
You see, I got a boy runnin' tomorrow
in the Southern Classic

86
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,841
When he wins,
I wanna celebrate in style.

87
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:42,262
- How much style?
- Well, I got a few friends and me.

88
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:44,139
400 cases.

89
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:48,351
- 400 cases...?
- Well?

90
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:52,480
- Well, let me see your cash.
- Big Enos's word is gold.

91
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:56,818
All right show him the cash.

92
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,279
- Go ahead, Little.
- Shit.

93
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:04,993
Let's see. There's 400 cases of beer,
I'll need the cash for that.

94
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,163
No problem. Go ahead, boy.

95
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:11,458
New car. Gotta have a new car
to block for the truck.

96
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:17,922
- OK. Go ahead, boy.
- I'd like to kick his ass just once.

97
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,049
Speedy car.

98
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:24,679
Speedier than that.

99
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,681
Go ahead.

100
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:49,788
- Hello, darlin'.
- Hi, Uncle Bandit.

101
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,040
- Which one of the house apes are you?
- Kate.

102
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:54,501
He's droppin' 'em like flies, isn't he?

103
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,712
Well, well, well. Hello, beautiful.

104
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,548
- How about 'gorgeous'?
- You can't have him.

105
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:03,593
Obviously you can. What are you
tryin' to do, start another race?

106
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,222
Look, you got Cledus in jail once.
Leave us alone!

107
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,682
- Hi, Uncle Bandit!
- He ain't your damn uncle!

108
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:15,063
I always recognise you! You know why?
You always kick me in the balls!

109
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,024
Damn it, Bandit! Look at me!

110
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:22,737
I find it hard to look at you, Waynette,
especially with those things in your hair.

111
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:25,323
Makes me think you're listening
to a radio station in Savannah.

112
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,244
You can't go in there and bother Cledus.
Hey! This is my home!

113
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,704
- Cledus.
- No!

114
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:35,583
I know in the past
I may have done you wrong.

115
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,795
- Right?
- Right.

116
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:44,092
However, in the future, Cledus,
I will never, ever do you wrong again.

117
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,719
- Right?
- Right.

118
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:53,852
We have a big chance, a big chance
to make a run for some big bucks.

119
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,982
- 80,000 of them.
- Really?

120
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,361
- Are we gonna kidnap the Pope or somethin'?
- How'd you guess?

121
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:08,324
No. We're just gonna run over to Texarkana
and pick up 400 cases of Coors

122
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,202
and bring it back in 28 hours.

123
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,830
Whoa! I got a flash for you.

124
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:16,791
That's called bootleggin',
and that's against the law.

125
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,587
Who gives a turkey when the Snowman
and the Bandit are runnin' the booze?

126
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:23,339
- No one can stop us.
- Hold it right there.

127
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:26,426
There ain't gonna be no more
Snowman and Bandit.

128
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:31,806
Because I've got to go in the morning
to Conyers and pick up a load of manure.

129
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,893
- Shitty job.
- Can I ask you a question?

130
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,728
Sure. Ask me.

131
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:39,939
What the hell do we wanna go to
Texas for and haul beer back here?

132
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:42,192
For the good old American life.

133
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:45,820
For the money, for the glory
and for the fun.

134
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:49,282
Mostly for the money. You know
what we're gonna do with the money?

135
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,077
- What?
- We're gonna buy a new rig.

136
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:55,663
- You're crazy, you know that.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,501
- How much money did you say it was?
- $80,000.

138
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,878
$80,000?

139
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,922
- Hm.
- Waynette!

140
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,384
Now, Bo, I'm tellin' ya,
Fred here ain't gonna be no problem.

141
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:12,764
- I can see he'll be a major asset.
- Besides, he's one hellacious watchdog.

142
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:16,309
- Well, let's get goin'.
- Whoa. Hold it a minute.

143
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:19,854
I got to ask you a question.
Sit right there, Fred.

144
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:23,191
You mean to tell me
we're gonna drive from here

145
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:26,694
to Texarkana, Texas,
and back to here in 28 hours?

146
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:29,447
It's only 900 miles there
and 900 miles back.

147
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:33,201
Well, for your information,
that ain't never been done, not in no rig.

148
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:37,539
'Cause you and I never done it in no rig.
You gotta stop thinkin' so negative.

149
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,625
'Course we can make it.
We ain't never not made it yet, have we?

150
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,545
- Well, no.
- You see? There you are.

151
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,881
Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see all right.

152
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:51,386
I see our asses in a sling
if we get caught that's what I see.

153
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:57,892
Hey! Ho-ho-ho!

154
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:01,646
Well, God Almighty,
would you look at that!

155
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:04,733
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Honey, hush.

156
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,863
I don't guess we're gonna be ridin'
in the truck together this time?

157
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:12,657
No, son. I'll be drivin' this one
and blockin'.

158
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:15,493
You'll be drivin' the truck.
This is Bandit One and that is...

159
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,954
...Bandit Two. Together again.

160
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:22,542
- Like Fred and Ginger and Lester and Earl.
- That's right. But we got a problem.

161
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:26,504
You know them Smokeys
got them CBs in the car now.

162
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:30,550
I haven't worked that out yet,
but I'm thinkin' about it.

163
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:33,011
I got an idea.
Why don't we do this?

164
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:37,265
If I say go to channel 21, forget it.
We ain't goin' to 21, we're goin' to 19.

165
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:41,186
- 21 is 19?
- If I say go to channel six, forget it.

166
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:44,105
- We go to three.
- I go to three. Perfect.

167
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:47,275
- If I say go to channel two, we go to one.
- Two is one.

168
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,694
- That'll confuse everybody.
- That'll confuse 'em.

169
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:53,239
On the other hand,
if we stayed on the odd channels,

170
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:56,326
switched every time and started
in the basement, that'd work, too.

171
00:11:56,493 --> 00:12:01,039
- That'd do it, too, wouldn't it?
- Well, yeah, that'd work too, I guess.

172
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:04,334
- Let's haul ass.
- OK.

173
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:30,110
Breaker One. This is the Bandit.
Is the Snowman out there?

174
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:32,779
- Am I hittin' ya, son?
- Mercy sakes.

175
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:35,990
You put about eight and a half on me,
blowin' my windows out. Bring it on.

176
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:40,745
I'll be within earshot.
You keep it wound up to around 90.

177
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:44,499
- Hey, Bandit. Me and Fred's got a question.
- What do you and Fred want?

178
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,169
How come we're doing this?
They said it couldn't be done.

179
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:51,381
- That's the reason.
- That's good with Fred!

180
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:53,716
10-4.

181
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:57,637
Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'

182
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,723
We gonna do what they say
can't be done

183
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,353
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

184
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,107
I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

185
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:13,194
Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes

186
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,865
Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make

187
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:20,910
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana

188
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:25,331
And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes

189
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:29,294
Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'

190
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:32,547
We gonna do what they say
can't be done

191
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:36,885
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

192
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:40,722
I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

193
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,247
Old Smokey's
got them ears on

194
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:08,416
He's hot on your trail

195
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,628
And he ain't gonna rest
till you're in jail

196
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:14,005
So you've got to dodge him
you've got to duck him

197
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,132
You've got to keep
that diesel truckin'

198
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,636
Just put that hammer down
and give it hell

199
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,138
Well, hello there, Smokey.

200
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:31,689
Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'

201
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:34,984
We gonna do what they say
can't be done

202
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:39,656
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

203
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:43,326
I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

204
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:47,580
Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes

205
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:51,167
Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make

206
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:55,088
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana

207
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:59,467
And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes

208
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:03,513
Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'

209
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,683
We gonna do what they say
can't be done

210
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,187
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

211
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:15,316
I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

212
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:23,992
Fred, I hope me and you
ain't lettin' Bandit

213
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,287
talk us into somethin'
we gonna be sorry for, son,

214
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,956
'cause he's about as crazy
as you are ugly.

215
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,393
Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'

216
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,563
We gonna do what they say
can't be done

217
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,193
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

218
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:02,489
I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

219
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:35,730
- Big town, ain't it?
- I wonder what they do for excitement.

220
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:38,233
They probably sit around
and watch the cars rust.

221
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,694
- Damn it, it's locked.
- We're about an hour ahead of schedule.

222
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:44,906
- Let's keep it that way.
- All right.

223
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,544
Hey, want a beer?

224
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,588
- Well, son!
- Redneck heaven.

225
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:03,425
- How we gonna load all this stuff, though?
- I'll load it with this.

226
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:07,345
- You can't drive no forklift.
- I can drive any forkin' thing around.

227
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:10,223
- Get serious! Can you drive this thing?
- I am serious.

228
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,976
- Crank it up. Now back it up.
- Oh, shut up!

229
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:18,106
- I said back it up, not raise it up!
- I am backin' up, ya big dumbbell!

230
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:21,025
Hold it! The beer! Watch the beer!

231
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:27,449
- You all right?
- Very funny! Very funny!

232
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:28,992
I thought it was funny.

233
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:33,580
Hey, we really oughta pay somebody
for that mess we made in there.

234
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:36,666
- All right have you...
- I got that all worked out.

235
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,837
You just leave a note. Tell the folks
to send the bill to Big Enos Burdette.

236
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:52,974
"Send... bill... to... Big... Enos... Burdette."

237
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:57,937
Burdette. B...

238
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:02,192
B-e-r... B-u-r... B...
Hell, I got to go.

239
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:10,408
Hey, Spiderman,
are you out there? Come back.

240
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:14,496
Snowman! How we doin', son?
Come on back.

241
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:16,873
Hang on just a minute,
and I'll tell ya.

242
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:22,212
We're about 28 minutes ahead of schedule.

243
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:24,672
- Come back.
- I hate to say I told you so.

244
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,343
Don't lose your head, son.
We still got a lot of boogiein' to do.

245
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,805
Put the pedal to the metal.
I'm 10-10 on the side.

246
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:35,725
For sure. Me and Fred,
we got your back door, ain't we, Fred?

247
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:50,657
- Sorry. I don't want to get married.
- Terrific That makes two of us.

248
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:55,495
- Will you unzip me?
- Sure.

249
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:59,082
- Does this thing move?
- Oh, yeah.

250
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,082
Where are we going?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

251
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:45,295
- We are a bride in search of a wedding.
- No.

252
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:50,967
There is a wedding in search of a bride.
Let me put it another way.

253
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:55,180
Think of it as a wedding posse
in search of a bride.

254
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:59,559
- You understand that, cowboy?
- Yeah.

255
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:03,480
What are ya doin'?

256
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,192
- These are my shoes.
- Oh, yeah.

257
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,986
- And these are my legs.
- Yeah.

258
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:15,200
- What are you gonna do with them?
- With the shoes or the legs?

259
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:18,953
Last time I saw legs like that
they had a message tied to 'em.

260
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,917
What do you mean? These are
great little legs. I'm a professional.

261
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:29,589
Well, in that case,
you shouldn't be dressed in white.

262
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:32,717
- Dancer.
- Oh.

263
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:37,388
Well, cowboys love fat calves.

264
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:41,935
- They're not fat.
- They're bigger than mine.

265
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:45,897
- Do we really wanna talk about legs?
- One of us does.

266
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:52,028
Otherwise we wouldn't have gone...
What are we doing now?

267
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:55,824
Well, I am getting my clothes, you fool.

268
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:59,828
Good idea. Why don't you
slip into somethin' comfortable?

269
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:06,876
Are we really going 110?
We're going 110!

270
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:11,089
Why do you wear that cowboy hat?
Because you think it looks dazzling on you.

271
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,884
I'd no idea this dress
would be so hard to get out of.

272
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:06,728
Hold up on that car wash, gentlemen.

273
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:12,692
Come here, son.

274
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,988
Whoops!

275
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:22,410
You look tired, boy. Rest yourself.

276
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:29,042
You punks look tuckered out, too.

277
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:37,133
That's an attention-getter.

278
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:42,055
- Now, a lady in a weddin' gown.
- Yes, sir.

279
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:45,809
- Get in a car?
- Yes, sir.

280
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:49,104
- See who was drivin'?
- N-no, sir.

281
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:55,902
- Licence plate?
- Y-yes, sir. Georgia plates.

282
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:57,862
"Ban-one."

283
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:02,534
B-A-N dash O-N-E.

284
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,788
All right. Now, you boys
just stay here and watch the car.

285
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:10,208
There might be some vandals around
who wanna steal somethin',

286
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,586
so you boys just stay here
and keep your hands on the car

287
00:23:13,753 --> 00:23:17,465
until one of my associates arrive.

288
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:24,347
And don't go home, don't go to eat,
and don't play with yourself.

289
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:27,684
It wouldn't look nice on my highway.

290
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:34,107
Oh, you can think about it,
but don't do it.

291
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:51,791
Hey, man, he's gone.
Let's get outta here.

292
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:56,004
Shit! You do what you want.
I'm stayin' right here.

293
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:04,262
28 years old and... Oh, goodness,
what's this? I'll tuck it right in.

294
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:07,891
I was down here dancing
in a home appliance show.

295
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:11,144
- I danced around three trash mashers.
- Talk to me, my boy.

296
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:15,356
I had this costume that lit up.
I only short-circuited once.

297
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:20,111
- Where did you get that seat cover, son?
- This ain't no seat cover.

298
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:23,948
- I was standing in the parking lot...
- I'm sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia.

299
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:28,828
I met this guy... These can't be my pants.
God, he was good-looking.

300
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,372
- And he had this hat on...
- Funny, ain't she?

301
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:36,628
I think he was from Texas or something,
and I thought "Why not marry the guy?"

302
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:43,802
Nobody walks out
on a pretty weddin' I set up.

303
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:46,596
I'm gonna get that girl
and set everything straight.

304
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:52,352
She insulted my town.
She insulted my son.

305
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:58,691
- Look, what if we...
- Shut up! She insulted my authority.

306
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:05,657
And that's nothin' but pure and simple
old-fashioned Communism.

307
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:09,369
It happens every time one of those
dancers starts poontangin' around...

308
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:11,621
with those show-folk fags.

309
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:14,541
Halfway down the aisle I said to myself,

310
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:17,293
"Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
His mother doesn't even have any teeth!"

311
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,588
I jumped in this car, and it blew up
on the side of the road,

312
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:23,925
and I ended up in this goddamn airplane.
What do you do?

313
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:27,220
I don't remember.

314
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:31,891
- Oh, are we on the air?
- Sort of, yeah.

315
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:37,021
You think I'm... nuts, don't you?

316
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,607
No, I don't think you're crazy.

317
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:44,320
I picked up three brides yesterday,
just like you, very subdued.

318
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:47,782
Hey, what... what's goin' on up there?

319
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:50,869
- Come back, Bandit.
- Bandit?

320
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:57,041
- Is that your name or your profession?
- That's my handle. Bo's my real name.

321
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,711
- What's your name?
- Carrie.

322
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:03,548
Is she wearing a wedding dress?

323
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:07,594
She was.

324
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:11,347
What's she wearin' now?
Come back.

325
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:14,434
Hey, you got peanut butter
or somethin' in your ears?

326
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:18,897
Tell me what that woman's got on...
her mind!

327
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:21,107
10-4!

328
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:25,195
No coozie's gonna leave me
at no church.

329
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:29,032
Decoratin' up a whole town
at a cost of $40.

330
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,743
Right.

331
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:38,750
I can see her now,
runnin' back up that aisle...

332
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:42,212
No, she was dancin'
back up the aisle,

333
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:45,340
her knockers bouncin'
all over the joint.

334
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:48,635
Let go of that wheel.

335
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:52,680
Why, her ass was wigglin', too.

336
00:26:57,352 --> 00:27:01,022
Why so fast?
You're late for a big bowling date?

337
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:02,732
Cute.

338
00:27:05,402 --> 00:27:10,323
- So, tell me about yourself.
- What do you wanna know, my sign?

339
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,536
- What do you do besides drive fast?
- Have fun.

340
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:18,081
- Is this fun?
- Drivin'?

341
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:23,128
- Driving, talking to me.
- They're both a challenge.

342
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:29,634
- You've got a great profile.
- Yeah, don't I? Especially from the side.

343
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,679
At least we finally agree on something.

344
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:36,266
Yeah. We both like half my face.

345
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:45,775
Hey, would a cop taking a leak
on the side of the road interest you?

346
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,612
Yes, it would.

347
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:55,577
- He's taking a 10-100.
- At least it's better than a 10-200.

348
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:01,708
- Smokey.
- Smokey.

349
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:31,071
- Is this fun?
- I forgot to tell ya:

350
00:28:31,237 --> 00:28:34,616
I'm runnin' blocker for 400 cases
of illegal Coors.

351
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:53,051
Holy shit!

352
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:59,224
I don't believe this.
Funny, I don't remember that turn.

353
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:03,686
- Bandit, where the hell are you?
- I'll be back on the highway in a second.

354
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:06,106
All right, good buddy.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

355
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:23,873
- Them things are fabulous.
- I think I just went 10-100.

356
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,253
- Well, it's better than 10-200.
- That's true.

357
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:39,431
Well, the more wheels I got
the better I like it.

358
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:43,852
I'm the brother of a truck-driving mother
boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity.

359
00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:51,568
- Snowman, you got your ears on?
- You lucky devil, you got him.

360
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:55,155
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm on a two-lane blacktop.

361
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:59,868
Highway marker number 71.
How's our time doin'?

362
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:06,166
Oh, how are we doin' on time?
About 25 minutes ahead of schedule.

363
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:10,336
- What's your 20?
- I'm about four miles ahead of you, turkey.

364
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:12,005
Not for long.

365
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:17,343
- Breaker to the Bandit.
- Come on back, breaker.

366
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:21,431
Bandit, I've got a smokey report
for you. Come on.

367
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:25,435
- Well, talk to me, good buddy.
- You've got trouble comin'.

368
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:29,147
Well, what's your handle, son,
and, uh, what's your 20?

369
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:35,320
My handle's Smokey Bear,
and I'm tail-grabbin' your ass right now.

370
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:42,327
Goddamn. That's a Texas mountie.
What the hell's he doin' in Arkansas?

371
00:30:42,494 --> 00:30:46,206
Well, let's just see what
he's got under the hood.

372
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:48,083
Bye-bye, baby!

373
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:03,932
You smoke much?

374
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,518
I just started.

375
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:14,359
- Cledus, you got your ears on, son?
- Oh, bring it on, you lucky devil.

376
00:31:14,526 --> 00:31:16,694
- Comin' around you.
- Be careful.

377
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:20,532
You're gonna have to make your own lane,
'cause you definitely got oncoming traffic

378
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:22,075
Be careful. Be careful.

379
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:32,085
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

380
00:31:32,252 --> 00:31:36,131
I'm about to be killed in this...
in this moving CB radio show,

381
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:39,926
and I... I don't even have a handle!

382
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:44,806
You want a handle?
OK, I'll think one up for ya. Let's see.

383
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:47,267
- Oh, I got one for ya!
- What?

384
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:51,855
Just give me a minute here.

385
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:55,608
He done good, didn't he, Fred?

386
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,074
What?

387
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:04,951
Frog.

388
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:09,289
- Why?
- 'Cause you're always hoppin' around.

389
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:13,918
And you're kinda cute like a frog,
and... I'd like to jump ya.

390
00:32:17,088 --> 00:32:19,048
Nobody...

391
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:24,429
Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice
look like a possum's pecker.

392
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:27,724
- Except for that...
- Shut your ass.

393
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:35,565
- Break for that Bandit One.
- Yeah, Snowman, come on back.

394
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:38,068
That was a Texas bubblegum machine
on your back door.

395
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:41,821
- A Texas bubblegum machine?
- Yeah, I saw him.

396
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:58,797
You ain't gonna believe this, but that crazy
sombitch tried to drive up under my truck.

397
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:01,925
What's a Texas county mountie
doing in Arkansas?

398
00:33:02,092 --> 00:33:04,761
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

399
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:07,222
I don't know!

400
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:11,226
- Well, who the hell knows?
- I really don't know.

401
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:20,110
What we're dealin' with here is
a complete lack of respect for the law.

402
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:24,697
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.

403
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:28,201
I'm in pursuit of a black TransAm.

404
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:32,914
He's all mine, so stay outta the way.

405
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:44,509
This is Sheriff George Branford
of Deeson County, Arkansas.

406
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:47,929
We are apprised of the situation
and are taking appropriate measures.

407
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:49,681
Did you say you are a sheriff?

408
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:53,226
That's a big 10-4!

409
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:57,272
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice
of Texas!

410
00:33:57,439 --> 00:34:01,025
Texas? You know, of course,
that you're out of your jurisdiction.

411
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:03,611
I suggest that you let my department
handle the situation.

412
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:08,575
That's very comfortin',
but I'm in a high-speed pursuit.

413
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,578
- Don't you hear good?
- I hear perfectly.

414
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:14,414
The fact that you are a sheriff
is not germane to the situation.

415
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:18,293
The goddamn Germans
got nothin' to do with it!

416
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,503
- What?
- Shut up! One shit at a time!

417
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:31,181
- What do ya see?
- We lost him.

418
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:42,275
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice again.

419
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:45,904
I lost that TransAm.
Set up a roadblock.

420
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:48,782
- Good idea!
- What the hell you know?

421
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:51,993
I believe we have the situation
well under control, Sheriff.

422
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:58,917
Breaker, breaker, lookin' for the Bandit.

423
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:02,003
- You out there, son?
- You got the Bandit. Come on back.

424
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,509
My handle's Silver-Tongued Devil. Your fellow
CBers are mighty proud of ya out there.

425
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,677
Thank ya, son. I appreciate it.

426
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:13,264
Tell me, you comin' up
on Fayetteville and Interstate 82?

427
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:17,811
- We're almost on top of it.
- I got a big bad bear story for you there.

428
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:20,647
I just rolled past
a county mountie roadblock.

429
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:25,735
- You ARE a silver-tongued devil.
- That's a big 10-4, good buddy.

430
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:30,740
Well, you keep your wheels spinnin'
and the beavers grinnin', then. I'm out.

431
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:33,451
Why, thank you, Officer.

432
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:36,079
- Classy guy.
- Classy guy.

433
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:02,772
Did you see that? They went
right through our roadblock.

434
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:05,567
You sombitches couldn't
close an umbrella.

435
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:40,018
You know somethin', Sheriff? If J.W.
don't get out of my way, I'll pass him.

436
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:42,771
Where? In the woods?

437
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:47,692
I don't care if your daddy is the mayor.
You wreck this car, it'll come outta your pay.

438
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:51,946
- Yeah, but he's gettin' away.
- Son, he's not goin' anywhere.

439
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:55,492
The Mulberry Bridge has been dismantled
for the past six months.

440
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,917
That's not good.

441
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,257
It would be better with a whole bridge.

442
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,844
And that's worse.

443
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:22,227
- Why don't you drop me off? I'll catch a cab.
- Too late now.

444
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:36,408
We did it! We did it!

445
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,546
See? I didn't wreck it, Sheriff.

446
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:54,551
We jumped over that bridge!

447
00:37:54,718 --> 00:37:57,554
- Did you see what we did?
- Yes, I did.

448
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:01,641
I wanna jump something else! I wanna
jump a house! I wanna jump something!

449
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:03,810
Well, jump me.

450
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:10,817
- Honest to God, it wasn't my fault! I stopped!
- Yeah, right.

451
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:14,571
Hey, boy, where's Sheriff Branford?

452
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:18,742
I am Sheriff Branford.

453
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:24,289
Oh, hey...
For some reason or another,

454
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:28,877
you sounded a little taller on radio.

455
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:37,927
What the hell is
the world comin' to?

456
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:49,522
Sounds good to me,
Tower of Power. Listen, buddy...

457
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:52,150
- What channel we on?
- What?

458
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:56,321
- What channel are we on?
- 11.

459
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:58,948
Snowman, are you out there?

460
00:38:59,115 --> 00:39:03,536
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to be doin'.
What are y'all doing, he'n' and she'n'?

461
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:06,456
- Come back.
- Oh, we were playin' a little bridge.

462
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:11,586
- How we been doin'?
- We're losin' minutes, son.

463
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:17,217
If you don't get up here and run me some
interference, we ain't never gonna make it.

464
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:22,222
I'll drop the dolly off at a choke-and-puke,
and then I'll get right back on the job.

465
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:25,392
All right.
10-4 on that choke-and-puke.

466
00:39:25,558 --> 00:39:28,395
- Oh, by the way, Bandit...
- Yeah, guy?

467
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:32,190
How 'bout bringin' me a hamburger for Fred?
I'm beginnin' to worry about him.

468
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:35,276
- He's lookin' a little thin in the skin.
- You got 'em.

469
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:39,114
- Choke-and-puke.
- Choke-and-puke.

470
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,951
- That's where I'll get off?
- Right.

471
00:39:46,037 --> 00:39:48,540
You oughta give up smokin'.
That's bad for your health.

472
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:51,793
But I enjoy it so much.

473
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:12,731
I guess you can get
your ticket over there.

474
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:15,275
- You got enough money?
- Yeah.

475
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:19,446
I have enough to get to Jersey,
walk the rest of the way.

476
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:26,578
- Hey, thanks.
- Oh, it was nothing.

477
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:30,957
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

478
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,421
Frog?

479
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:40,258
You gonna be all right?

480
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:49,851
Yeah... I'm always all right.

481
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:06,451
Can I have a couple of cheeseburgers
to go and a glass of iced tea?

482
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:17,504
How much I owe ya, ma'am?

483
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,131
- A dollar and a half.
- Keep the change.

484
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:24,677
Just keep your eye out
for that Mr Bandit bastard!

485
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:33,186
Let me have a diablo sandwich, a Dr Pepper.
Make it fast. I'm in a goddamn hurry.

486
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:36,064
- You want somethin'?
- A hush puppy, Daddy.

487
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:41,528
We got no time for that crap!
Dumb sombitch!

488
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:45,782
- Diablo and Doc
- Thank you, nice lady.

489
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:50,078
- You must be in a hell of a hurry, Sheriff?
- You bet your ass on that, boy.

490
00:41:50,245 --> 00:41:55,333
Oh, you got a little mess there.
Let me help you get that off there...

491
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,878
- Yeah, yeah. Much obliged.
- Yeah.

492
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:01,965
Who ya chasin'?
Somebody chasin' you?

493
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:03,842
Nobody chasin' me, boy.

494
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:09,472
I been chasin' a goddamn maniac
all the way from Texarkana, Texas.

495
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,767
Really?
What is he, a bank robber?

496
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:15,562
Bank robber?

497
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:20,775
Bank robbin' is baby shit
alongside of what this dude is doin'.

498
00:42:21,943 --> 00:42:24,112
Almost killed 20 law officers.

499
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:28,158
Drivin' through people's backyards,
knockin' down mailboxes.

500
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:31,786
He's got a broad in the car,
took her across the state line.

501
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:34,247
That's the Mann Act.

502
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:37,751
I don't think he's got her permission,
and that's kidnapping.

503
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:40,754
- How's that for high jinks?
- Yeah.

504
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:45,592
- What I owe?
- Oh, let me pay for it.

505
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:49,179
- You're an officer of the law. I'd be honoured.
- Much obliged.

506
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:52,849
- Where's the can? I gotta take a squirt.
- Right back there. Just used it.

507
00:42:58,354 --> 00:43:01,524
Hey! Hey!
What are you doin' in my car?

508
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:04,319
- You're goin' the wrong way!
- Oh.

509
00:43:04,903 --> 00:43:06,780
- Hang on!
- What the hell are ya doin'?

510
00:43:06,946 --> 00:43:10,033
- Sheriff Justice is in there!
- I know! I know!

511
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:20,543
- Thank you, nice lady.
- Sure thing.

512
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:28,259
Yoo-hoo! Sheriff!

513
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:34,766
Oh, boy.

514
00:43:36,976 --> 00:43:39,396
Nice ass.

515
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:49,280
I didn't want to be dumped
at any old truck stop.

516
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:53,535
- I wanted to stay with you.
- Well, why didn't you ask?

517
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:57,705
You might've said no, and I have
a hard time handling rejections.

518
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:43,710
We're gainin' on 'em.

519
00:44:43,877 --> 00:44:47,505
I think it'd be a good idea
if we changed places, don't you?

520
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:51,509
You be a passenger for a while now.
Up, up... I'll just slide right...

521
00:44:51,676 --> 00:44:54,679
- Oh, you got my hair.
- Sorry. I'll slide right under.

522
00:44:54,846 --> 00:44:58,016
- Ooh, I don't know. Wait. Wait. Wait!
- I got it. I got it!

523
00:44:58,183 --> 00:44:59,559
- Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute!

524
00:44:59,726 --> 00:45:02,187
Hold it! I'm stuck here.
This is not workin'.

525
00:45:02,353 --> 00:45:06,483
- I got my foot on the...
- Goddamn it! I seen it in the movies!

526
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:19,162
Oh, my God!

527
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:23,666
Duck, or you're gonna
be talkin' outta your ass!

528
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:35,011
- Daddy, the top came off.
- No shit?

529
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,063
Snowman! How are your vocal cords?

530
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,901
Well, my vocal cords are fine.
I'm a little worried about Fred now.

531
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:55,448
He's been gnawing everything, barkin' and
screamin'. He's turned into a stalk of bananas.

532
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:59,536
- What's your 20?
- About 16 miles this side of Mississippi.

533
00:45:59,702 --> 00:46:03,706
Whoa, hold it. I just passed
another Kojak with a Kodak.

534
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:07,961
This place is crawlin' with bears.
Where the hell are you? Come back.

535
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:13,341
I'm still tryin' to get rid of that Texas County
mountie. I don't know what the hell he wants.

536
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:18,388
You know what he wants. How would you like
to be the dude that handcuffs a legend?

537
00:46:18,555 --> 00:46:23,768
Give me five minutes, we'll put some moves
on that mother. I'll meet ya at Old Miss.

538
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:27,188
You'd better hurry, or we can just kiss
that money goodbye. Understand?

539
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:29,691
I read you loud and clear. 10-4.

540
00:46:29,858 --> 00:46:33,820
You got the one Snowman.
I'm eastbound and down.

541
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:36,781
We gone, killer.

542
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:50,712
That's the way I wanna go out.
Hey, man, watch it!

543
00:46:54,132 --> 00:46:57,343
- What the hell was that?
- A left, or half a 'u'.

544
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,138
Well, please don't do it anymore.

545
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,644
Hey, you know who that was?
Check this out.

546
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:09,355
Bandit, this here's the Grave Robber.

547
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:14,486
Put the pedal to the metal, and we'll hold
this county mountie as long as we can.

548
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:17,238
- Well, go, girl, go!
- I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

549
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:20,450
I've got the metal to the pedal,
and the thing to the floor...

550
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:50,897
Damn, he had a lot of friends, didn't he?

551
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:53,775
If they had cremated the son of a bitch,

552
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:59,155
I could've been kickin' that Mr Bandit's
ass around the moon by now.

553
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:16,923
Hold my hat!

554
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,468
- My hat blew off, Daddy.
- I hope your goddamn head was in it.

555
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:26,433
- OK. We're gonna switch.
- OK.

556
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:30,603
I'm comin' over underneath you.
You just slide right on over.

557
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:33,356
I think I'm in love with your belt buckle.

558
00:48:38,027 --> 00:48:40,780
Close. Colourful, but close.

559
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,127
I like this seat better anyway.

560
00:48:54,294 --> 00:48:56,880
Yes, have a smoke. It seems to help.

561
00:48:57,797 --> 00:48:59,716
Come on, defence!

562
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:02,969
Come on, Billy Ray, get tough!

563
00:49:03,136 --> 00:49:06,473
You know, I wanted to be
a high-fashion model once.

564
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:11,770
But, hell, how long can you
model clothes for 8-year-olds? Boys.

565
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:16,024
Besides that my cheeks were too fat.
These cheeks, these.

566
00:49:17,776 --> 00:49:20,278
Aarghhh!

567
00:49:21,196 --> 00:49:24,574
- Oh, my goodness, we're airborne here.
- Jesus Christ!

568
00:49:24,741 --> 00:49:29,370
- Oh, look, a football game!
- There's kids! For Christ's sake, watch out!

569
00:49:29,537 --> 00:49:33,249
- Don't hit the kids!
- Get your hands off my wheel!

570
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:35,960
Lean to the left, lean to the right...

571
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:51,559
Stand up there and see if you can see
where the hell they went.

572
00:49:52,227 --> 00:49:56,689
- Can you see anything?
- It's a football game. Can we watch, Daddy?

573
00:49:56,856 --> 00:50:00,360
- You stay and watch. I'm goin' back!
- But, Daddy...

574
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:10,745
Bandit, you're reckless
and you live much too hard

575
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:13,665
Oughta be in Nashville.

576
00:50:13,832 --> 00:50:17,377
Snowman, are ya out there, son?
What's your 20? Where are you?

577
00:50:18,503 --> 00:50:22,632
I'm at mile marker 85. Come back.

578
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:25,719
Son-of-a-gun! So am I!

579
00:50:29,055 --> 00:50:33,476
Well, damned if ya ain't.
Damned if ya ain't.

580
00:50:53,371 --> 00:50:55,582
Cledus... This is Frog.

581
00:50:55,749 --> 00:50:58,501
Hello, Frog. I want you
to meet Fred, Frog.

582
00:50:58,668 --> 00:51:02,172
- This is for Fred.
- Frog, feed Fred.

583
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:04,883
What's wrong with you? You were gonna
dump the chick at the truck stop.

584
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:09,179
- I ran into complications.
- You always run into complications.

585
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:12,515
Always the same, some chick.
We ain't doin' good time.

586
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:16,227
- What are we yappin' for?
- It's the chick.

587
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:22,108
- Switch down to the next channel, right?
- Yeah.

588
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:26,362
Hey, Bandit? Nice ass.

589
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:28,948
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks a lot.

590
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,171
All right Fred. Come on.
Let's go, boy. Come on.

591
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:45,673
Fred, I'm tired of pickin' you up... Fred!

592
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:53,348
- Did Cledus call you a legend?
- Uh-huh.

593
00:51:54,182 --> 00:51:59,270
- Why?
- Well, I used to do some crazy things.

594
00:51:59,437 --> 00:52:01,398
- I used to.
- Oh.

595
00:52:05,193 --> 00:52:06,653
So did I.

596
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:11,866
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

597
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:14,619
One, two... I'm a gypsy... four.

598
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:19,374
That's someone who goes from chorus line
to chorus line... six, seven, eight.

599
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:26,172
- You know, I was on Broadway once.
- Really?

600
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:29,050
- For almost 12 minutes.
- Oh.

601
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:31,761
The show closed the first night.

602
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:37,809
But, God, I was so good. You shoulda
seen me. You'd have loved me.

603
00:52:44,023 --> 00:52:47,986
What do you do? Straight.

604
00:52:51,865 --> 00:52:57,412
I just go from place to place
and... do what I do best.

605
00:52:58,204 --> 00:53:01,374
- What's that?
- Show off.

606
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,673
Yeah. You do do that well.

607
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:13,970
You do.

608
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,141
So do I.
Five, six, seven, eight.

609
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:22,187
- For almost 12 minutes.
- Oh, shut up!

610
00:53:24,773 --> 00:53:29,319
Come here, Fred. Come here, boy.
Fred, don't you make me come after you.

611
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:33,782
Get over here, Fred! Come here.

612
00:53:33,948 --> 00:53:38,828
I'm in a hurry, and you want to swim.
You're drivin' me crazy, Fred.

613
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:48,963
What is the matter with you, Fred?
That's it for you and the truck drivin'!

614
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:00,850
Look, I've got to go 10-100.
Could I have a dime?

615
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:04,729
- Crawl under.
- Terrific

616
00:54:04,896 --> 00:54:07,357
"Crawl under."

617
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:18,159
- TransAm! What's your pleasure?
- Fill it up, my man.

618
00:54:19,494 --> 00:54:21,830
Gimme that talker.

619
00:54:24,582 --> 00:54:27,419
Hello? Mr Bandit?

620
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:31,381
Would you just happen
to be listenin' out there?

621
00:54:31,548 --> 00:54:33,299
Can you hear me, boy?

622
00:54:35,635 --> 00:54:38,096
This is the Bandit.
Who've I got at that end?

623
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,183
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice
of Texas.

624
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:45,770
Well, hot damn.
Welcome to Mississippi, Sheriff.

625
00:54:45,937 --> 00:54:47,564
Thank you, Mr Bandit.

00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,453
I apologise to all the friendly folk

00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:06,166

631
00:55:06,332 --> 00:55:11,212
I didn't come all the way this far
to go home with empty pockets.

632
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:14,841
I been meanin' to ask you that.
How come you're followin' me?

633
00:55:15,008 --> 00:55:18,636
I'd be delighted to tell you, Mr Bandit.

634
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:23,308
You see, when I get you back home,

635
00:55:23,475 --> 00:55:27,353
I'm gonna find the tallest tree
in the country,

636
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,233
and then I'm gonna hang you from it

637
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,944
- Sheriff?
- I'm listenin'.

638
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:37,906
Do the letters F.O.
mean anything to you?

639
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:44,204
Smart aleck.

640
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:48,625
You keep this one for yourself.

641
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:53,588
- Have a smooth ride, Mr Bandit.
- Thank you, partner.

642
00:55:58,093 --> 00:55:59,844
Oof!

643
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,309
Snowman, I'm right beside you.

644
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:09,521
Looks like we got a clear shot
all the way to the 'Bama state line.

645
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:14,401
Oh, a clear shot?
I'm gonna believe that when I see it

646
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:19,406
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice
puttin' out an all-point advisory.

647
00:56:19,572 --> 00:56:24,619
That black TransAm is now
headed toward Alabama.

648
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:28,081
What happened, Daddy?

649
00:56:28,248 --> 00:56:31,334
Get back in the goddamn car.

650
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,467
You know who I feel has revolutionised
the American musical theatre?

651
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:42,595
- Stephen Sondheim.
- Yeah?

652
00:56:42,762 --> 00:56:45,432
- Who's that?
- Stephen Sondheim?

653
00:56:45,598 --> 00:56:48,518
- Does he do a lot of musicals and stuff?
- Yeah.

654
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:51,855
- He ever do anything with Brenda Lee?
- Does she dance?

655
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:55,859
- She spins. She's a little spinner.
- Oh, they were a good group.

656
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:58,027
- The Spinners were good. Yeah.
- Yeah.

657
00:56:58,194 --> 00:57:00,405
Have you ever been in any plays?

658
00:57:00,572 --> 00:57:04,367
Holy shit. We got
a lot of company up there.

659
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:06,578
A lot of company.

660
00:57:06,745 --> 00:57:10,081
- Sarge, here he comes.
- Yeah, I got eyes.

661
00:57:22,218 --> 00:57:26,097
- Are you ready, Roy?
- I was born ready.

662
00:57:26,264 --> 00:57:28,349
Don't just stand there. Go get him!

663
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:33,063
- Drives pretty good, don't he, Sarge?
- We'll see about that.

664
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:55,043
- Sarge, you OK?
- You see me movin', don't ya?

665
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,984
- Wanna do a little pond hopping, Frog?
- Uh... Swell.

666
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:32,932
Now, I know you're
in a little distress here,

667
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:36,061
but did you see
a black TransAm go by?

668
00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:39,314
He caused all of this, the Bandit.
Ain't he somethin'?

669
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,110
The Bandit ain't nothin'.
He's a mental case.

670
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:51,534
Good shit!

671
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:55,288
Banzai!

672
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:01,836
I saw that, you sombitch!

673
01:00:02,003 --> 01:00:04,089
You did that on purpose!

674
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:06,633
You're goin' away till you're grey!

675
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,344
I got the evidence!
Put the evidence in the car.

676
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:13,306
- But, Daddy...
- Put the evidence in the car!

677
01:00:13,473 --> 01:00:18,561
I'm gonna barbecue
your ass in molasses!

678
01:00:24,984 --> 01:00:27,695
Put the evidence in the back.

679
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:39,082
There's no way, no way...

680
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:43,002
that you could come from my loins.

681
01:00:44,295 --> 01:00:49,718
When I get home, the first thing I'm gonna
do is punch your mama in the mouth.

682
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:03,148
I-I'll be with you
in a moment, young man.

683
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:07,652
Bandit, honey, this is the Good
Witch of the North speakin'.

684
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:10,363
You'd better not come this way.

685
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:14,951
There's been a little
fender bender here on 64.

686
01:01:15,118 --> 01:01:18,663
- Snowman, you copy that?
- Yeah, I got a four on that.

687
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,541
That'll work for me, 'cause I need to pull off,

688
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,335
suck up a little go-go juice
and put some groceries down my neck.

689
01:01:24,502 --> 01:01:26,129
Y'all be careful
and I'll catch ya later.

690
01:01:26,296 --> 01:01:30,550
- One Snowman. I'm playin' on the side.
- We'll be 10-10 on the side.

691
01:01:30,717 --> 01:01:34,387
Lady, don't you know
you're supposed to signal?

692
01:01:34,554 --> 01:01:36,389
Oh? Really?

693
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:51,780
They call you the Bandit

694
01:01:51,946 --> 01:01:56,659
An outlaw untamed

695
01:01:56,826 --> 01:02:01,498
Shackled only by freedom

696
01:02:01,873 --> 01:02:04,542
You wear no man's chain

697
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:09,047
We got some time.
You wanna stretch your legs, Frog?

698
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:11,674
Some say they despise you

699
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:17,639
Well, maybe they do

700
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:22,310
But deep down inside them

701
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:28,858
I bet they wish they were you

702
01:02:44,457 --> 01:02:45,917
Fill her up, hoss.

703
01:02:46,084 --> 01:02:49,879
Come on, Frederick.
Come on, boy, my boy.

704
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:53,383
Let's go get some
of Lamar's greasy spoon.

705
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:57,470
I'm gonna put you
on a diet Fred. Mercy.

706
01:02:59,472 --> 01:03:04,519
Come on, Fred. Come on, boy.

707
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:06,896
Inside.

708
01:03:07,063 --> 01:03:09,232
Come on, boy.

709
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:12,235
Lamar, surprise.
Look who's here.

710
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:14,362
- I knew you was comin'.
- Hi, Snowman.

711
01:03:14,529 --> 01:03:17,532
What do you mean,
you knew I was comin'?

712
01:03:24,456 --> 01:03:26,791
Lamar, you're rotten
to the core, you know that.

713
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:29,711
About as rotten as that food
you've been poisonin' me with...

714
01:03:29,878 --> 01:03:33,298
- How many do you want?
- I don't know. Fix the same thing.

715
01:03:33,465 --> 01:03:35,717
Just cook the onions this time.

716
01:03:36,634 --> 01:03:40,221
- How have you been, Sugar Bear?
- Pretty good. You, Snowman?

717
01:03:40,388 --> 01:03:43,266
Oh, pretty good,
considering the shape I'm in.

718
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:48,104
Say hello to Waynette.
Looks like old Fred's gettin' fat.

719
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:51,858
Yeah, tell me about it. It damn sure
ain't from eatin' the food at this joint.

720
01:03:52,025 --> 01:03:55,195
- Tell me about that.
- I know it.

721
01:03:55,361 --> 01:03:59,532
By the way, where did you get
all them warthogs back there?

722
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:02,368
Damn if I know. They slid
in here a little while ago.

723
01:04:02,535 --> 01:04:05,288
I'm gonna slide on out.
Catch you later, Snowman.

724
01:04:05,455 --> 01:04:08,625
Yeah, why don't you just leave me?

725
01:04:08,792 --> 01:04:10,168
Yes, operator?

726
01:04:10,335 --> 01:04:14,255
This is a collect call
from Cledus Snow.

727
01:04:15,256 --> 01:04:18,802
No, I am not Hank Snow's brother. No.

728
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,848
Hey, sugarbabe, how you doin'?

729
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:30,522
- Could I ask you something?
- Sure.

730
01:04:32,816 --> 01:04:36,736
Do you think we have
anything in common?

731
01:04:36,903 --> 01:04:40,907
Besides being chased around
the country in that feckuckteh car?

732
01:04:41,074 --> 01:04:43,576
Yeah.

733
01:04:44,285 --> 01:04:46,329
Like what?

734
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:49,791
Have you ever seen
the Broadway show Chorus Line?

735
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,460
No.

736
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:55,922
You like Elton John?

737
01:04:56,381 --> 01:04:58,133
No.

738
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:03,054
- Do you know who Casey Tibbs is?
- Baseball player.

739
01:05:03,221 --> 01:05:07,642
- Close. Richard Petty?
- No.

740
01:05:07,976 --> 01:05:11,646
- Waylon Jennings? No.
- No.

741
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:15,525
When you tell somebody somethin',

742
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:18,236
it depends on what part of
the United States you're standin' in...

743
01:05:18,403 --> 01:05:21,030
as to just how dumb you are.

744
01:05:25,493 --> 01:05:29,080
Mr Bandit, you have a lyrical way
of cutting through the bullshit.

745
01:05:29,247 --> 01:05:33,793
And you have a unique way with
the English language, Miss Frog.

746
01:05:37,213 --> 01:05:42,010
Bandit steals a lady's heart

747
01:05:42,177 --> 01:05:45,430
With only a smile

748
01:05:46,056 --> 01:05:49,684
- Don't you take that hat off for anything?
- Sure.

749
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:53,021
I take it off for one thing,
and one thing only.

750
01:05:53,188 --> 01:05:57,942
And you live much too hard

751
01:05:58,109 --> 01:05:59,986
Bandit, you're the joker

752
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:04,491
- If we were lost on a desert island together...
- Yes?

753
01:06:04,657 --> 01:06:11,456
Do you think we'd get along
and talk and... things?

754
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:14,542
Sure.

755
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,628
Yeah, we'd get along.

756
01:06:16,795 --> 01:06:22,384
It'd never be boring, I can tell you that.
It would never be boring.

757
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:27,138
Take your hat off.

758
01:06:28,306 --> 01:06:31,101
If you want to.

759
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:36,564
They call you the Bandit

760
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:39,192
I want to.

761
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:47,283
They call you the Bandit

762
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:51,788
They call you the Bandit...

763
01:07:02,716 --> 01:07:06,761
- No. Honey, we'll be home in a little while.
- Hey!

764
01:07:07,262 --> 01:07:10,223
Is this your goddamn mutt?

765
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:15,437
Honey, I got... I gotta go.
Yeah, I gotta go... Bye.

766
01:07:16,354 --> 01:07:20,775
- Yeah, that's my dog. Yeah.
- Well, he just bit me.

767
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:24,320
- Fred! Come here, Fred.
- I said... He just bit me.

768
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:27,031
- Put the son of a bitch out of his misery.
- Let's roast him.

769
01:07:27,198 --> 01:07:29,993
- That's not a bad idea.
- Eat him.

770
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,040
I don't think Fred bit you, mister.
Fred absolutely don't like grease.

771
01:07:41,087 --> 01:07:45,050
Gearjammer, huh?
King of the road, huh?

772
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:54,059
- It's time to get out.
- That's a big 10-4.

773
01:08:44,734 --> 01:08:47,862
How much do I owe you, Billy?

774
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:51,950
- 73... 84.
- Never mind, just keep the change.

775
01:08:52,117 --> 01:08:55,870
Sorry what happened, Snowman.

776
01:08:56,371 --> 01:08:59,374
It's OK, Lamar.

777
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:28,153
Far out.

778
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:35,952
What the hell is this,
a drive-in movie?

779
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:43,418
Get off of there, you schnauzer's tits.

780
01:10:03,772 --> 01:10:08,735
- How do, Officer. My name's...
- I don't care if it's Broderick Crawford.

781
01:10:08,902 --> 01:10:13,031
Don't you know you can't drive
a piece of shit like that on the highway?

782
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:16,868
I'll thank you not to use
that kind of language in my presence.

783
01:10:17,035 --> 01:10:20,914
Never mind that crap.
What the hell is this?

784
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:24,876
- This is evidence.
- Evidence?

785
01:10:25,043 --> 01:10:30,173
I don't care what it is. You can't drive
this piece of shit on my highway.

786
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:33,093
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

787
01:10:33,259 --> 01:10:38,056
I have my young son in the car,
and I don't wanna hear that kinda language.

788
01:10:38,223 --> 01:10:43,311
- Look! I'm askin' you one single, goddamn...
- Hold it!

789
01:10:43,686 --> 01:10:46,064
Hold it!

790
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:50,151
Don't you ever, ever
raise your voice to me!

791
01:10:50,318 --> 01:10:52,320
Do you know who you're talkin' to?

792
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:55,615
I happen to be Buford T. Justice,

793
01:10:55,782 --> 01:10:59,619
a distinguished officer
of over 30 years' seniority!

794
01:10:59,786 --> 01:11:03,164
One of the most highly respected
law-enforcement agents...

795
01:11:03,331 --> 01:11:06,751
in the United States of America.

796
01:11:06,918 --> 01:11:12,006
That vehicle happens to be
evidence, valuable evidence,

797
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:17,470
that's going to convict a maniac
that I've been tryin' to apprehend

798
01:11:17,637 --> 01:11:21,683
and that I have been
in high-speed pursuit of

799
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,935
for 700 miles.

800
01:11:25,854 --> 01:11:30,024
He is wanted for the Mann Act,
kidnappin'

801
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:35,405
and the attempted murder
of over 20 brother officers.

802
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,999
Sir, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

803
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:52,422
It never occurred to me... Well, please, sir,
you proceed immediately, and...

804
01:11:52,589 --> 01:11:55,341
I hope you'll accept my apologies
for my profanity.

805
01:11:56,676 --> 01:12:02,557
Apology accepted.
Now...

806
01:12:10,607 --> 01:12:13,818
How about you, Bandit?
You copy this Snowman? Come on.

807
01:12:13,985 --> 01:12:16,112
I got ya, son. Come on back.

808
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:20,784
You ain't gonna believe this,
but I just did my imitation of Joe Palooka.

809
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:24,120
I went a few rounds with some dudes
at this eat-'em-up joint.

810
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:28,875
Oh, I believe anything you tell me.
How'd ya do, same as always?

811
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:32,545
Yeah, about normal. I lost.

812
01:12:32,712 --> 01:12:38,676
We also lost a lot of valuable time.
We gonna really have to cook.

813
01:12:38,843 --> 01:12:43,139
- Is that a 10-4?
- That's a big 10-4.

814
01:12:53,483 --> 01:12:57,695
Actually, my heaviest relationship
was with an acid-rock singer...

815
01:12:57,862 --> 01:12:59,531
named Robert Crumly.

816
01:12:59,697 --> 01:13:05,370
We were together... eight and a half days.
God, I really thought that was it.

817
01:13:05,537 --> 01:13:06,996
And?

818
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:10,458
One day I came home
and found him in the shower...

819
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:13,545
...with a girl...
and her mother!

820
01:13:13,712 --> 01:13:17,382
Well, at least
he kept it in the family.

821
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:28,184
You have a wonderful way
of putting things.

822
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:31,438
- So did he.
- Oh, yes.

823
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:38,903
Breaker one-nine.
This is the Bandit

824
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:42,365
I'm lookin' for a west-bounder
on highway 85.

825
01:13:42,532 --> 01:13:44,826
I need a smokey report,
and I need it bad, son.

826
01:13:44,993 --> 01:13:48,872
This is Foxy Lady, Bandit.
We heard you were comin' by,

827
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:51,750
and we decided we'd take care
of those bears for you.

828
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:57,005
- You know, a little "personalised service".
- Send me the bill, Foxy Lady.

829
01:13:57,172 --> 01:14:00,508
Better yet, why don't you
come by and pay up in person?

830
01:14:01,468 --> 01:14:05,638
I'll catch you on the flip side, darlin'.
I'm too pooped to pop.

831
01:14:05,805 --> 01:14:07,515
- Daddy, listen.
- Shut up!

832
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:09,684
But I'm just ahead of you.

833
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:12,687
I'm at mile marker 86.
Come on by, Bandit.

834
01:14:12,854 --> 01:14:14,856
All right, you talked me into it.

835
01:14:15,023 --> 01:14:19,402
Now I got that sombitch,
and I got him with his fly open.

836
01:14:21,488 --> 01:14:25,950
- What do we do when we get home?
- Go to bed. For a week.

837
01:14:26,117 --> 01:14:28,328
Good idea.

838
01:14:28,495 --> 01:14:32,749
- And sleep.
- Wanna bet?

839
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:37,128
Orville, you seen that new waitress
at the diner, Arlene?

840
01:14:37,295 --> 01:14:41,091
- She's got some nice legs.
- I'd like to take a run on her.

841
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:43,802
- Oh, man, what are you talkin' about?
- I'm tellin' ya.

842
01:14:43,968 --> 01:14:48,390
Let me tell you somethin' about that.
She makes herself...

843
01:14:49,808 --> 01:14:53,311
- Feel lucky?
- Let's get him.

844
01:14:56,856 --> 01:15:00,068
This is car four.
We're in pursuit of the black TransAm.

845
01:15:00,235 --> 01:15:02,862
It's the Bandit

846
01:15:10,995 --> 01:15:14,833
Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'

847
01:15:14,999 --> 01:15:18,294
We gonna do
what they say can't be done

848
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:22,424
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

849
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:26,219
I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

850
01:15:26,386 --> 01:15:28,138
Oh, shit.

851
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:35,979
Breaker one-nine.
Breaker one-nine.

852
01:15:36,855 --> 01:15:39,733
I see a portable gas station
ahead of me. Do you copy?

853
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:45,029
Is this Bandit? This is Mr B., gearjammin'
this rollin' refinery. You got a smokey?

854
01:15:45,196 --> 01:15:49,659
This is the Bandit, son. Can we
slide right into your convoy there?

855
01:15:49,826 --> 01:15:55,248
Come ahead, Bandit. We'll slip you into
the rockin' chair, play a little hide-and-seek.

856
01:15:55,415 --> 01:15:59,002
The welcome mat is out,
and you're comin' home.

857
01:15:59,169 --> 01:16:01,171
10-4.

858
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,799
- We're going in the rocking chair, honey.
- Good.

859
01:16:09,929 --> 01:16:14,225
Trucks, I love 'em. I love 'em.

860
01:16:18,146 --> 01:16:21,900
This is not a convoy.
This is a dream.

861
01:16:30,867 --> 01:16:33,995
- They can see right down into this car!
- Well, so what?

862
01:16:34,162 --> 01:16:37,874
That's why I used to love to drive
those trucks, darlin'. Spot those beavers.

863
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:46,132
- Safe as in your mother's womb, darlin'.
- Is that right?

864
01:16:46,299 --> 01:16:48,176
Son, never mind them brakes

865
01:16:48,343 --> 01:16:52,097
Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make

866
01:16:52,263 --> 01:16:55,934
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana

867
01:16:56,101 --> 01:17:00,271
And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes

868
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:04,192
Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'

869
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:07,570
We gonna do
what they say can't be done

870
01:17:07,737 --> 01:17:11,991
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

871
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:16,246
I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

872
01:17:31,928 --> 01:17:36,182
Old Smokey's got them ears on
he's hot on your trail

873
01:17:36,349 --> 01:17:39,477
He ain't gonna rest
till you're in jail

874
01:17:39,644 --> 01:17:41,479
So you gotta dodge him
you gotta duck him

875
01:17:41,646 --> 01:17:43,773
You gotta keep
that diesel truckin'

876
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:48,903
Just put that hammer down
and give it hell

877
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:54,033
Thank you, Mr B.
I don't know how to thank ya.

878
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,828
You can thank me
by not gettin' caught.

879
01:17:56,995 --> 01:17:59,998
Have a good day and a better one
tomorrow, good buddy.

880
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:03,001
Hey, Bandit,
this is Little Beaver.

881
01:18:03,168 --> 01:18:06,963
Put your foot on the floor.
We got your back door, and I'm clear.

882
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:11,426
That's a 10-4.
Snowman, you got your ears on, son?

883
01:18:12,635 --> 01:18:14,763
You've got him, you lucky devil.

884
01:18:14,929 --> 01:18:16,848
You're about to come up on a convoy.

885
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:19,684
Keep your rubber band
stretched real tight.

886
01:18:19,851 --> 01:18:24,481
10-4, 10-4.
I'm bringin' it, son. I'm clear.

887
01:18:26,066 --> 01:18:29,652
Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'

888
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:33,448
We gonna do
what they say can't be done

889
01:18:33,615 --> 01:18:37,702
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

890
01:18:37,869 --> 01:18:41,539
I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

891
01:18:41,706 --> 01:18:45,377
Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes

892
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:49,172
Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make

893
01:18:49,339 --> 01:18:53,385
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana

894
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:57,680
And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes

895
01:18:57,847 --> 01:19:01,684
Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'

896
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:04,938
We gonna do
what they say can't be done

897
01:19:05,105 --> 01:19:09,359
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

898
01:19:09,526 --> 01:19:12,362
I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

899
01:19:12,529 --> 01:19:17,617
I don't care if you're the Governor of Texas.
You're makin' a big mistake.

900
01:19:21,788 --> 01:19:24,874
Read him his rights, Junior.

901
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:26,835
You have the right to remain silent.

902
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:31,047
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law. And...

903
01:19:31,214 --> 01:19:33,633
What's all this about?

904
01:19:33,883 --> 01:19:38,054
Oh, hello, Officer!
Glad you're here to assist me.

905
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:40,890
My name is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.

906
01:19:41,057 --> 01:19:44,144
I have just apprehended the Bandit.

907
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:47,731
No, sir. You just apprehended my captain.

908
01:19:51,443 --> 01:19:54,195
- Take the cuffs off, Junior.
- But, Daddy, we just...

909
01:19:54,362 --> 01:19:58,032
Take the cuffs off, you moose twit.

910
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:09,294
May I express my feelings
about inconveniencing you...

911
01:20:09,461 --> 01:20:12,714
But if you gonna hang out
in these kinda joints...

912
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:15,884
wear a badge on your didie.

913
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:38,740
Oh, no.

914
01:20:38,907 --> 01:20:41,201
Hey, Bandit. Listen to this.

915
01:20:42,786 --> 01:20:45,705
You know who that is?
That's Mr Evel Knievel.

916
01:20:45,872 --> 01:20:48,333
He snuck in my back door
when I wasn't lookin'.

917
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,503
Give me a hand, or we gonna be
in a heap of trouble.

918
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:55,965
- Please roger that transmission.
- Hold on to Fred. Here comes the cavalry.

919
01:21:08,144 --> 01:21:10,105
- Howdy, Officer.
- How ya doin'?

920
01:21:10,271 --> 01:21:16,236
Give me your licence and manifest, boy.
You know you was goin' 96 miles an hour?

921
01:21:16,403 --> 01:21:18,696
- I was doin' 96...
- You're damn right you was.

922
01:21:18,863 --> 01:21:20,990
I didn't know this truck could do 96.

923
01:21:21,157 --> 01:21:24,953
The judge gets to you, he's gonna
turn you every way but loose.

924
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,748
It's time you truckers learn
these roads don't belong to you.

925
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,176
You be careful, you hear?

926
01:21:59,904 --> 01:22:04,534
- Whoa. Want a little piece of advice, Bandit?
- Yeah. Lay it on me, son.

927
01:22:04,701 --> 01:22:09,956
Don't take your foot off of that hammer.
Them bears'll pour over you like maple syrup.

928
01:22:46,034 --> 01:22:47,827
- You all right?
- Yeah.

929
01:22:47,994 --> 01:22:52,457
- Don't you know this ain't Saturday?
- Thanks a lot.

930
01:23:26,783 --> 01:23:29,994
We don't need assistance.
I've got him in my sights.

931
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:40,004
Headquarters, disregard
my last transmission.

932
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:13,663
Son... you reckon you can
let me off at the next exit?

933
01:24:14,581 --> 01:24:16,833
- Go get your daddy a beer.
- OK.

934
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,419
...I understand every cop
in the state's after him.

935
01:24:19,586 --> 01:24:23,465
- Stay 10-10. I'll let you know.
- That's a big 10-4.

936
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:26,384
Damn, he's been stirring up some trouble.

937
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:38,021
Ooh, it's the Bandit!

938
01:24:53,995 --> 01:24:58,958
I'm Hot To Trot. Just tell me how
I can help and I'm with ya, body and soul.

939
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:02,420
- Channel clear.
- Breaker one-nine, breaker one-nine.

940
01:25:02,587 --> 01:25:04,839
Is that Hot Pants Hilliard
yakkin' out there?

941
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:08,009
- And who wants to know?
- This is the Bandit, darling.

942
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:11,846
Well, where are you,
you bodied-up, smooth-talkin' thing?

943
01:25:12,013 --> 01:25:14,224
And how can I help?
Bring it back.

944
01:25:14,391 --> 01:25:17,310
You still workin' at that
choke-and-puke on West 85?

945
01:25:17,477 --> 01:25:21,022
Affirmative, affirmative.
I'm still dishin' it out.

946
01:25:21,564 --> 01:25:26,236
We'll come screamin' by in five minutes
with a herd of smokeys on our ass.

947
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:29,489
How 'bout gettin' those pallies
of yours out there, block 'em off?

948
01:25:29,656 --> 01:25:32,659
Love to! But hey,
you're gonna owe me one.

949
01:25:32,826 --> 01:25:36,538
- I owe you a big one.
- That's a big 10-4.

950
01:25:36,705 --> 01:25:38,373
10-4.

951
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:44,421
All right gang, we're gonna go
for a big smokey red 22. Wahoo!

952
01:25:44,587 --> 01:25:46,381
- Ride with me?
- Yeah.

953
01:25:52,178 --> 01:25:57,350
- You sure we ain't gonna get in trouble?
- Nah. I've done it before.

954
01:26:12,073 --> 01:26:16,036
- We're comin' at you, darlin'. Are you ready?
- Ready, willin' and able.

955
01:26:16,202 --> 01:26:20,290
"Ready and willing." Ha.
She always was.

956
01:26:23,543 --> 01:26:27,130
OK, gang, be alert,
'cause here he comes.

957
01:26:27,297 --> 01:26:31,885
- Well, go ahead and answer.
- 10-4, Hot Pants. We copy.

958
01:26:32,052 --> 01:26:34,012
Let go of the button.

959
01:27:16,513 --> 01:27:20,725
Paydirt. I just picked up
the Bandit eastbound on 95.

960
01:27:20,892 --> 01:27:22,477
All units converge.

961
01:27:22,644 --> 01:27:26,106
I copy, Chopper One.
I'm on my way.

962
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,370
Heading for the fairgrounds!

963
01:28:04,436 --> 01:28:08,440
This is car 12, Bobby Lee,
and I have him westbound on 75.
1005

964
01:28:20,535 --> 01:28:25,665
- Cledus, where the hell are we?
- Four miles to go, good buddy.

965
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:31,087
- Four miles. Goddamn it!
- Four miles...

966
01:28:37,218 --> 01:28:40,764
Bo, did you count on this?

967
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:43,641
I mean, all of this?

968
01:28:48,646 --> 01:28:51,566
No, I didn't, honey.

969
01:28:55,737 --> 01:28:59,157
- Cledus?
- Talk to me, my boy.

970
01:28:59,324 --> 01:29:02,869
Goddamn it, son,
we gave it our best shot.

971
01:29:03,036 --> 01:29:07,082
I don't like this any more
than you do, but...

972
01:29:07,248 --> 01:29:10,377
We ain't gonna make it, son.
We're gonna hang it up.

973
01:29:10,543 --> 01:29:13,129
Whoa, negatory, negatory!
You crazy or somethin'?

974
01:29:13,296 --> 01:29:17,842
We come this far, ain't we? When we say
we gonna do a job, we do a job!

975
01:29:18,009 --> 01:29:21,012
It's me they're after. They don't
even know Cledus Snow exists.

976
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:26,142
Oh, they don't?
Well, I'll tell you what we gonna do.

977
01:29:26,976 --> 01:29:30,313
We gonna introduce 'em to the boy.
So move over, good buddy,

978
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:35,402
'cause the Snowman is comin' through.
Hold on to your ass, Fred.

979
01:29:44,953 --> 01:29:46,913
Hot damn, we're gonna make it.

980
01:30:05,557 --> 01:30:08,393
Move them vehicles.
We gotta get through!

981
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,979
Here they come!

982
01:30:48,308 --> 01:30:52,020
Daddy, you're about to have
your evenin' ruined for you.

983
01:31:06,826 --> 01:31:08,870
- OK.
- All right.

984
01:31:09,037 --> 01:31:11,873
- We're in trouble.
- I know we're in trouble.

985
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,042
- What time is it?
- One minute after.

986
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:17,128
- Goddamn, we're 10 minutes early.
- We're in trouble!

987
01:31:17,295 --> 01:31:19,923
We need a way out of here.
We need the money.

988
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:23,468
Here's my Cadillac. That'll leave me
with an even dozen. Good luck, son.

989
01:31:23,635 --> 01:31:25,512
- Cledus, get the money.
- How 'bout the money?

990
01:31:25,678 --> 01:31:28,056
- How 'bout double or nothin'?
- How 'bout forgettin' it?

991
01:31:28,223 --> 01:31:29,766
What about double or nothin'?

992
01:31:29,933 --> 01:31:33,311
You run up to Boston,
bring back some clam chowder.

993
01:31:34,646 --> 01:31:36,398
- You're on.
- Uh, you're on.

994
01:31:36,564 --> 01:31:40,360
- In 18 hours?
- You're still on.

995
01:31:40,527 --> 01:31:44,280
Y-y-you're crazy!
And I'm divorced!

996
01:31:44,447 --> 01:31:47,951
And you... Ain't half bad, is it?

997
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,889
20 to one
I break the son of a bitch this time.

998
01:32:15,228 --> 01:32:17,313
Gimme 500 on the Bandit.

999
01:32:24,237 --> 01:32:27,574
Apprehend that horse ass
for reckless drivin'!

1000
01:32:27,741 --> 01:32:32,662
- But, Daddy, he's...
- Do what I tell you, you pile of monkey nuts!

1001
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,922
Sheriff Buford T. Justice, please.

1002
01:32:43,089 --> 01:32:45,967
- Who there?
- This is Bandit Darville talkin'.

1003
01:32:46,718 --> 01:32:48,928
Where are you, you sombitch?

1004
01:32:49,137 --> 01:32:53,141
Before I tell you where I am, Sheriff,
there's just one thing I wanna say.

1005
01:32:53,308 --> 01:32:57,562
You must be part coon dog,
'cause I been chased by the best of 'em,

1006
01:32:57,729 --> 01:33:01,483
and son, you make 'em look
like they're all runnin' in slow motion.

1007
01:33:01,649 --> 01:33:06,071
- I just wanna say that.
- Well, thank you, Mr Bandit.

1008
01:33:06,237 --> 01:33:12,786
And as the pursuer, may I say you're
the goddamnedest pursuee I ever pursued.

1009
01:33:14,204 --> 01:33:16,873
Now that the mutual bullshit is over,

1010
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,250
where are you, you sombitch?

1011
01:33:19,417 --> 01:33:24,297
I'm right down at the bottom of the hill.
I'm six-foot-eight in a cowboy outfit.

1012
01:33:24,464 --> 01:33:28,051
I got a little pygmy standing beside me
dressed like me. You can't miss me.

1013
01:33:28,218 --> 01:33:30,303
10-4.

1014
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,600
Wait a minute.
Scratch that. Hold it.

1015
01:33:35,767 --> 01:33:40,355
I can't lie to you, Sheriff. You're too good
a man. Look over your left shoulder.

1016
01:33:44,692 --> 01:33:46,319
Oof.

1017
01:33:46,486 --> 01:33:51,157
We're on our way to Boston
to get some clam chowder. Bye-bye.

1018
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:55,745
- No hard feelings, Junior!
- I'm not givin' up!

1019
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:03,169
I'm never gonna give up!
I'll get you, you sombitch!

1020
01:34:03,336 --> 01:34:07,841
Daddy, wait for me! Don't leave me!
Who's gonna hold your hat?

1021
01:34:08,007 --> 01:34:11,469
Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'

1022
01:34:11,636 --> 01:34:14,889
We gonna do
what they say can't be done

1023
01:34:15,056 --> 01:34:19,269
We've got a long way to go
And a short time to get there

1024
01:34:19,436 --> 01:34:23,231
I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

1025
01:34:23,398 --> 01:34:27,360
Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes

1026
01:34:27,527 --> 01:34:30,947
Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make

1027
01:34:31,114 --> 01:34:35,118
Those boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana

1028
01:34:35,285 --> 01:34:39,205
And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes

1029
01:34:39,372 --> 01:34:43,334
Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'

1030
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:46,838
We gonna do
what they say can't be done

1031
01:34:47,005 --> 01:34:51,051
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

1032
01:34:51,217 --> 01:34:55,430
I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run

1033
01:35:11,112 --> 01:35:15,116
Old Smokey's got them ears on
he's hot on your trail

1034
01:35:15,283 --> 01:35:18,453
He ain't gonna rest
till you're in jail

1035
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:20,830
So you got to dodge him
you got to duck him

1036
01:35:20,997 --> 01:35:22,874
You've got to keep
that diesel truckin'

1037
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:27,087
Just put that hammer down
and give it hell

1038
01:35:27,253 --> 01:35:31,257
Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'

1039
01:35:31,424 --> 01:35:34,469
We gonna do
what they say can't be done

1040
01:35:34,636 --> 01:35:39,015
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

1041
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:43,144
I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run
