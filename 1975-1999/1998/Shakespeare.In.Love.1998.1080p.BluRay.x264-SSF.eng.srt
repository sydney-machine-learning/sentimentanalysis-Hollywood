1
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:59,696
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn't pay his debts?

2
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:01,906
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,076
Why do you howl...

4
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,787
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,590
- What am I, Mr. Lambert?
- Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,192
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,794
Twelve pounds, one schilling and fourpence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:18,754
- Aaah! I can pay you!
- When?

9
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,049
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity's sake!

10
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:24,301
Take them out.

11
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,603
Where will you find...

12
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:28,304
Sixteen pounds,
five schillings and ninepence.

13
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:30,306
Including interest,
in three weeks?

14
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,100
- I have a wonderful new play.
- Put them back in.

15
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:35,102
- It's a comedy!
- Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,729
It's a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:41,733
- And his ears.
- And a share!

18
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,777
We will be partners,
Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:47,363
Partners?

20
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:53,660
It's a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:57,247
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,166
- A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
- I think I've seen it.

23
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,001
I didn't like it.

24
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:05,796
- But this time it is by Shakespeare.
- What's it called?

25
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,674
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

26
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:10,842
Good title.

27
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:14,262
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:16,764
Let's say we open
in two weeks.

29
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:19,266
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,978
In addition, 400 backsides at
threepence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,021
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,858
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,355
Twenty pounds to the penny,
Mr. Fennyman.

34
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:32,069
Correct.

35
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:33,895
But I have to pay
the actors and the author.

36
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,197
Share of the profits.

37
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,699
- There's never any-
- Of course not.

38
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:42,120
Oh- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

39
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:44,706
Sign there.

40
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:52,212
So, Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

41
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:54,214
Almost finished?

42
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:57,801
Oh, without doubt he's completing it
at this very moment.

43
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,980
Will. Will!

44
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:01,440
Where is my play?

45
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,777
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

46
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,280
Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.

47
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:11,116
No, no, we haven't the time.
Talk prose.

48
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,117
Where is my play?

49
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:15,745
- It is all locked safe in here.
- God be praised.

50
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:17,705
Locked?

51
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:21,125
- As soon as I find my muse.
- Who is she this time?

52
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,126
She is always Aphrodite.

53
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,962
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

54
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:29,132
Henslowe, you have no soul,

55
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,885
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

56
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:34,887
Ow! Will!

57
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,889
I am a dead man,
and buggered to boot.

58
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,392
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

59
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:43,394
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

60
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:46,397
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain's
Men are invited to court...

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,400
and receive ten pounds
to play your piece,

62
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,402
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

63
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,404
when you were green
and grateful.

64
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,407
- What piece? Richard Crookback?
- No! It's comedy they want.

65
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,409
Like Romeo and Ethel.

66
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,411
- Who wrote that?
- Nobody. You were writing it for me.

67
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,414
- I gave you three pound a month since.
- Half what you owe me.

68
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,833
I'm still due for
One Gentleman of Verona.

69
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,336
What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you, my wordwright.

70
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,338
When the plague lifts,

71
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:16,340
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

72
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,342
- I will have nothing for the Rose.
- Mr. Henslowe.

73
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:19,844
Will you lend me 50 pounds?

74
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,336
Fifty pounds? What for?

75
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,346
Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain's Men.

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,182
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

77
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:30,311
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

78
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:32,313
No, then?

79
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:35,357
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

80
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:39,986
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

81
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,657
And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name!

82
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,370
I say, a plague
on both their houses!

83
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,371
Where are you going?

84
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,540
My weekly confession.

85
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,630
Words, words, words.

86
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,133
Once, I had the gift.

87
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:08,136
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

88
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,138
Love that overthrows empires.

89
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,641
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

90
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,645
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

91
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,348
- But now
- And yet you tell me you lie with women.

92
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:25,568
Black Sue,
Fat Phoebe,

93
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:29,697
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind-

94
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,575
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

95
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:34,243
I have lost my gift.

96
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,745
I am here to help you.

97
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:39,247
Tell me,
in your own words.

98
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,879
I- It's as if
my quill is broken,

99
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:50,883
as if the organ
of my imagination has dried up,

100
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:54,511
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

101
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,429
- Interesting.
- Nothing comes.

102
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:58,389
Most interesting.

103
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:01,225
It's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

104
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:06,938
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

105
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:12,110
How long has it been?

106
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,280
A goodly length in times past,
but lately-

107
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,783
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

108
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:24,621
Aye.

109
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,665
I was a lad of 18.

110
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,167
Anne Hathaway was a woman
half as old again.

111
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:33,295
- A woman of property?
- She had a cottage.

112
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,133
- One day she was three months gone
with child, so- - And your relations?

113
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:41,886
- On my mother's side, the Ardens.
- No, your marriage bed.

114
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,556
Four years and a hundred miles away
in Stratford.

115
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,435
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

116
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:51,436
Banishment was a blessing.

117
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,106
- So, now you are free to love-
- Yet cannot love, nor write it.

118
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:01,654
Here is a- a bangle...

119
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:05,240
found in Psyche's temple
on Olympus.

120
00:09:05,324 --> 00:09:07,617
Cheap at fourpence.

121
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:12,622
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

122
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:14,624
Will it restore my gift?

123
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:18,127
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

124
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,421
Words will flow like a river.

125
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:23,423
See you next week.

126
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:27,927
- Now where?
- To the palace at Whitehall.

127
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:31,430
All right.

128
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,933
Hello, Will.

129
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:38,061
Prithee, Mr. Kempe break a leg.

130
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,791
You too, good Crab.

131
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,939
Crab's nervous.
He's never played the palace.

132
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:44,442
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

133
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:45,743
I could do it.

134
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,861
No, they would laugh
at Seneca if you played it.

135
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:51,198
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

136
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:52,590
How goes it, Will?

137
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,700
I'm still owed money
for this play, Burbage.

138
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,703
Not by me.
I only stole it.

139
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,205
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

140
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:01,707
Where were
my seamstress' eyes?

141
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,179
When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain's Men?

142
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,669
When I have 50 pounds.

143
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:09,297
- You writing?
- A comedy. All but done.

144
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,299
A pirate comedy.

145
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:13,018
- Wonderful.
- Bring it tomorrow.

146
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,057
- It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
- How much?

147
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,413
- Ten pounds.
- You're a liar.

148
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:19,902
I swear, he wants Romeo
for Ned and the Admiral's Men.

149
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,709
Ned's wrong for it.

150
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:22,953
Will?

151
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:28,856
- Here's two sovereigns. I'll give you
another two when I see the pages. - Done.

152
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,858
Burbage, I will see you
hanged for a pickpocket.

153
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:33,360
The queen has commanded it.
She loves a comedy.

154
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:36,029
And the Master of the Revels
favors us.

155
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:39,032
And what favor does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

156
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:41,034
- Ask him.
- She comes!

157
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,767
Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.

158
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,061
Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,

159
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:14,939
were it not affection
chains thy tender days...

160
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,402
When will you write me
a sonnet, Will?

161
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:23,947
- I've lost my gift.
- You left it in my bed.

162
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,948
Come to look for it again.

163
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,791
Are you to be my muse,
Rosaline?

164
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:38,960
Burbage has my keeping,

165
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,962
but you have my heart.

166
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:45,633
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

167
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:47,634
Will Shakespeare has a play.

168
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:50,137
Let's go and cough through it.

169
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:55,141
My father weeping; my mother wailing;

170
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:59,979
our maid howling;
our cat wringing her hands.

171
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:03,440
Yet did not this coldhearted cur...

172
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,443
shed one tear-

173
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:21,289
You see? Comedy.

174
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:25,335
Love, and a bit with a dog.

175
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:27,503
That's what they want.

176
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,430
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,

177
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:43,517
and has no more pity in him
than a dog!

178
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,520
A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.

179
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:51,483
Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word-

180
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,068
Well played, Master Crab!

181
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:58,197
I commend you!

182
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:03,827
What light is light...

183
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,829
if Silvia be not seen?

184
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,540
What joy is joy...

185
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,876
if Silvia be not by?

186
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,879
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

187
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,882
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

188
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,386
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

189
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,931
there is no music
in the nightingale.

190
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,934
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

191
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,437
there is no day for me
to look upon.

192
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,336
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?

193
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,338
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

194
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,840
Oh, I liked the dog
for laughs.

195
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:08,343
Silvia, I did not care for much.

196
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:10,344
His fingers were red
from fighting...

197
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:13,681
and he spoke like
a schoolboy at lessons.

198
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:16,983
Stage love will never be true love
while the law of the land...

199
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:21,813
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

200
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:24,982
- Oh, when can we see another?
- When the queen commands it.

201
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,984
No, but at the playhouse.
Nurse!

202
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:30,863
Be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

203
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:33,198
Oh! I'm not so wellborn.

204
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:35,700
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

205
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:38,203
and well-married
is more so.

206
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:40,705
Lord Wessex
was looking at you tonight.

207
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:43,207
All the men at court
are without poetry.

208
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,210
If they see me, they see
my father's fortune.

209
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:49,880
I will have poetry
in my life,

210
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,881
and adventure.

211
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,676
And love.
Love above all.

212
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,678
Like Valentine
and Silvia?

213
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:01,640
No, not the artful postures
of love,

214
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:05,727
but love that overthrows life.

215
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,480
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart,

216
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:13,901
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

217
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:17,654
Love as there has never been
in a play.

218
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:21,658
I will have love,
or I will end my days as-

219
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,660
As a nurse?

220
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:28,539
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

221
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:32,668
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

222
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:36,963
I would stay asleep
my whole life...

223
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:40,967
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

224
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,969
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

225
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,516
Now spit.

226
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:16,331
This time the boots
are coming off.

227
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:17,654
What have I done Mr. Fennyman?

228
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:19,793
The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

229
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:22,795
- Oh, that.
- By order of the Master of the Revels.

230
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,216
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

231
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,551
The natural condition...

232
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:32,003
is one of insurmountable obstacles
on the road to imminent disaster.

233
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:34,055
- So what do we do?
- Nothing.

234
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,924
Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.

235
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:37,809
How?

236
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,811
I don't know.
It's a mystery.

237
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,813
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

238
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,815
The theaters are reopened...

239
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:48,568
by order of
the Master of the Revels!

240
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:51,821
The theaters are reopened!

241
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,823
Mr. Fennyman.

242
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:56,325
Mr. Tilney has reopened
the playhouses.

243
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,702
If you wouldn't mind.

244
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,331
Where's the play?

245
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:06,251
Oh, it's coming.
It's coming.

246
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,838
It's coming.

247
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:23,933
Will!

248
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:25,935
Will, I have wonderful news.

249
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:27,937
So have I.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

250
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,938
God, I'm good!

251
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:32,941
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

252
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:40,114
Richard?

253
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,450
Burbage!

254
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:51,874
Mr. Tilney.

255
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,628
Like you,
I found him not at home.

256
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:00,424
I would've made you immortal.

257
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:06,804
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

258
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:09,557
What does Burbage care of that?

259
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,394
He's readying the Curtain
for Kit Marlowe.

260
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:16,730
- You've opened the playhouses?
- I have, Master Shakespeare.

261
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:19,816
- But the plague-
- Yes, I know.

262
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,819
But he was always
hanging around the house.

263
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,934
The special today is a pig's
foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

264
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:43,295
- served on a buckwheat pancake-
- Will!

265
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,272
Have you finished?

266
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,474
Yes, nearly.

267
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:50,768
Good morning, Master Nol.
You will have a nice part. - Yes!

268
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:54,597
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.
- Clear that bloody table!

269
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,767
None other than the Admiral's Men
are out on tour.

270
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:01,061
I need actors!

271
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:05,064
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

272
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:09,235
- What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
- It won't cost you a penny!

273
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:12,237
Auditions in half an hour!

274
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:19,577
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you,

275
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:22,497
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

276
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,498
Never when I'm working.

277
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:27,376
Never when I'm working!

278
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,671
Get me to drink mandragora.

279
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,672
Straight up, Will?

280
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,758
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

281
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,052
Kit.

282
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,680
- How goes it, Will?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

283
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,392
- Burbage says you have a play.
- I have, and the chinks to show for it.

284
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,228
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

285
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:51,230
I hear you have a new play
for the Curtain.

286
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:53,399
Not new.
My Doctor Faustus.

287
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:55,943
Ah.
I love your early work.

288
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,946
"Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

289
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,573
and burnt the topless towers
of Ilium?"

290
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:04,576
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

291
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:06,577
The Massacre at Paris.

292
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:11,457
- Whew. Good title.
- Mmm. Yours?

293
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,959
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

294
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,963
Yes, I know. I know.

295
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,964
What is the story?

296
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:22,800
Well, there's this pirate-

297
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:27,805
In truth, I have not written a word.

298
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:31,433
Romeo.

299
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:34,602
Romeo is Italian,

300
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:36,938
always in and out of love.

301
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:39,231
Yes, that's good.
Until he meets-

302
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:41,650
- Ethel.
- Do you think?

303
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:44,194
- The daughter of his enemy.
- The daughter of his enemy.

304
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,488
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

305
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:50,074
by Ethel's brother, or something-
His name is Mercutio.

306
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:52,076
Mercutio.
Good name.

307
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,579
- Will! They're waiting for you!
- Yes, I'm coming.

308
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:58,415
Good luck with yours, Kit.

309
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:02,085
- I thought your play was for Burbage.
- This is a different one.

310
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:04,170
A different one
you haven't written?

311
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:06,964
Was this the face...

312
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,508
that launched a thousand ships...

313
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:12,010
and burnt the topless
towers of Ilium?

314
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:13,679
Thank you.

315
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:16,348
Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

316
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:19,142
- and burnt the top- topless
towers of Ilium? - Thank you!

317
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,144
Was this the face...

318
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:24,814
that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless-

319
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:29,443
I would like to give you something
from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

320
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,778
- How refreshing.
- ...the topless towers of Ilium?

321
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:34,989
Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.

322
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,286
W- Was this the f-

323
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,497
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

324
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:47,208
My tailor wants to be an actor.

325
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,711
I have a few debts
here and there.

326
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:51,796
Well, that seems
to be everybody.

327
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,298
- Did you see a Romeo?
- I did not.

328
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,633
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

329
00:21:56,717 --> 00:22:00,220
Oh, God.

330
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:06,559
May I begin, sir?

331
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:11,438
- Your name?
- Thomas Kent.

332
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:16,434
I would like to do a speech by a writer
who commands the heart of every player.

333
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:24,241
What light is light...

334
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:26,910
if Silvia be not seen?

335
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:32,582
What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,419
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

337
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:39,755
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

338
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,261
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

339
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,931
there is no music
in the nightingale.

340
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:55,269
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

341
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:58,647
there is no day
for me to look upon.

342
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:04,777
She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not-

343
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:08,072
- Take off your hat!
- My hat?

344
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:10,949
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

345
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:13,243
- I-
- Let me see you. Take off your hat.

346
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:15,662
- Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
- Wait there.

347
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:17,622
Wait there!

348
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,012
- Will, w-where are the pages?
- Where is the boy?

349
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:40,351
B- B-B-Break a leg!

350
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:46,981
Sir, will you buy
my sweet orange?

351
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:07,375
Hey!

352
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,559
Everybody ready? All away!

353
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,813
- Follow that boat!
- Right you are, governor.

354
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,903
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

355
00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:41,463
Yes.

356
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,240
Yes, I think I've seen you
in something.

357
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:46,242
- That one about a king.
- Really?

358
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:49,245
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

359
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:05,718
- Do you know that house?
- Sir Robert De Lesseps.

360
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,772
Where is she? Our guests are upon us!

361
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:23,776
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

362
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:26,862
My husband will have it
settled tonight.

363
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:29,406
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

364
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:32,700
Tomorrow he drags me off
to the country,

365
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:35,703
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

366
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,958
God save you, Mother.

367
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,960
Hot water, Nurse.

368
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,965
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

369
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,967
- Who, sir?
- The actor.

370
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,385
- Who asks for him?
- Will Shakespeare.

371
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,471
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

372
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,973
Master Kent...

373
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,142
is my nephew.

374
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,144
I will wait.

375
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:05,646
Much good may it do you.

376
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:11,318
"Romeo Montague,

377
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,320
a Young Man of Verona."

378
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:15,321
Verona again?

379
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:17,323
"A comedy
of quarreling families...

380
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:19,659
reconciled in
the discovery of Romeo...

381
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,161
to be the very same
Capulet cousin...

382
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:26,039
stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...

383
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:30,585
that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king."

384
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:32,587
Your mother and your father-

385
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,589
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

386
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:38,092
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

387
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,094
- He looks well enough for a charlatan.
- Oh, Nurse!

388
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:43,096
He would give Thomas Kent...

389
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,098
the life of
Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

390
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:47,600
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

391
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:49,602
You will not tell.

392
00:26:49,685 --> 00:26:51,937
As I love you and you love me,

393
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:54,940
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

394
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:03,072
Master Plum.
What business here?

395
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:05,074
The five schilling business, Will.

396
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,326
We play for the dancing.

397
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:11,997
Hyah! Hyah, hyah!

398
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:28,053
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

399
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:31,681
Musicians don't eat.
Sir Robert's orders.

400
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:33,683
She's a beauty, my lord,

401
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:37,645
as would take a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

402
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:41,148
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

403
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:44,150
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

404
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,152
when your grandson is a Wessex.

405
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:48,196
- Is she fertile?
- Oh, she will breed.

406
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:52,032
- If she do not, send her back.
- Is she obedient?

407
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:54,034
As any mule in Christendom.

408
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:57,037
But if you are the man to ride her,

409
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,039
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

410
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:01,457
I like her.

411
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,519
By all the stars in heaven.

412
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,896
Who is she?

413
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:29,441
Viola De Lesseps? Dream on, Will.

414
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:09,434
Master Shakespeare.

415
00:29:16,482 --> 00:29:18,401
My lady Viola.

416
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:20,402
My lord.

417
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:22,905
I have spoken with your father.

418
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:25,907
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

419
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,841
Good sir.

420
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,427
I heard you were a poet.

421
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:54,683
A poet of no words?

422
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:01,773
Poet?

423
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:05,985
I was a poet till now, but I've seen
beauty that puts my poems...

424
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:09,196
at one with the talking ravens
in the Tower.

425
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,490
- How do I offend, my lord?
- By coveting my property.

426
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:15,868
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat anon.

427
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:18,371
Do you have a name?

428
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:21,206
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

429
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:47,730
Romeo. Romeo.

430
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,733
A Young Man of Verona.

431
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,569
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

432
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,738
- My lady!
- Who is there?

433
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,699
- Will Shakespeare.
- Madam!

434
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:03,202
Anon, good nurse, anon.

435
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,915
- Oh, Master Shakespeare.
- The same, alas.

436
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,666
But why "alas"?

437
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,710
- A lowly player.
- Alas, indeed.

438
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:14,504
For I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

439
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:17,256
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

440
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,758
- Oh, I am him too.
- Madam!

441
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:22,761
Anon!
I will come again.

442
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:27,807
Oh, I am fortune's fool.
I will be punished for this.

443
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,728
Oh, my lady, my love!

444
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:36,106
If they find you here,
they will kill you.

445
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,693
- You can bring them with a word.
- Oh, not for the world.

446
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,946
- Madam!
- Anon!

447
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,958
Draw, if you be men!

448
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:45,960
Gregory, remember thy swashing blow!

449
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:49,463
Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.

450
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:52,466
It starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

451
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:54,968
Where's the comedy, Will?
Where's the dog?

452
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:56,970
Do you think it's funny?

453
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:59,972
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse.
That's funny.

454
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:02,892
We are six men short, and those we
have will be overparted ranters...

455
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:05,394
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

456
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:07,896
My Romeo's let me down.
I see disaster.

457
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,523
We are four acts short,
if you're looking for disaster.

458
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:12,525
- Sir!
- Who are you, master?

459
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:16,279
I'm Ethel, sir,
the pirate's daughter.

460
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,280
I'll be damned if you are!

461
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:22,701
Your attention, please!

462
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:26,204
- Gentlemen, thank you!
- You are welcome.

463
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:28,873
- Who's that?
- Nobody. He's the author.

464
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:32,043
We are about to embark
on a great voyage.

465
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:35,546
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

466
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:38,048
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

467
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:41,468
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we-

468
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:43,469
I'll do it.

469
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:45,972
Now listen to me, you dregs.

470
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:47,973
Actors are ten a penny,

471
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:51,894
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

472
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:54,146
Huzzah!

473
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:57,815
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house!

474
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,901
Huzzah!

475
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,240
Henslowe!

476
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:08,241
Earl! Good to see you.

477
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:13,246
Who is this?

478
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:16,248
Silence, you dog!

479
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:19,209
I am Hieronimo.

480
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,920
I am Tamburlaine.

481
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:24,256
I am Faustus.

482
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:28,259
I am Barabbas,
the Jew of Malta.

483
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,430
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am Henry the Sixth.

484
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:36,683
What is the play,
and what is my part?

485
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,186
- Uh, one moment, sir-
- Who are you?

486
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,272
I'm, um-
I'm the money.

487
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:45,274
Then you may remain,

488
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:47,276
so long as you remain silent.

489
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,346
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

490
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,255
Thank you, sir.

491
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:54,282
We are in desperate
want of a Mercutio, Ned.

492
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:56,951
A young nobleman of Verona.

493
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,953
- And the title of this piece?
- Mercutio.

494
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:01,622
Is it?

495
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:04,208
I will play him.

496
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:08,253
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

497
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:10,213
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

498
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:12,215
Sam, my pretty one!

499
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:16,302
- Are you ready to fall in love again?
- I am, Master Shakespeare.

500
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:18,595
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

501
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:21,098
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

502
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:24,809
Master Henslowe, you have your actors...
except Thomas Kent.

503
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:28,438
I, uh, I saw his Tamburlaine,
you know.

504
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:30,439
- It was wonderful.
- Yes, I saw it.

505
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:32,441
Of course,
such mighty writing.

506
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:34,610
There's no one like Marlowe.

507
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,332
Better fortune, boy.

508
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,334
I was in a play.

509
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,961
They cut my head off
in Titus Andronicus.

510
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:58,798
When I write plays,
they'll be like Titus.

511
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:00,341
You admire it.

512
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,509
I liked it
when they cut heads off,

513
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,512
and the daughter
mutilated with knives.

514
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,639
- What's your name?
- John Webster.

515
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:09,766
Here, kitty, kitty.

516
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:16,439
Plenty of blood.

517
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,440
That's the only writing.

518
00:36:19,566 --> 00:36:21,985
I have to get back.

519
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:25,196
See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.

520
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,198
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

521
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:30,701
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

522
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:32,703
- Cut around him for now.
- What? Who?

523
00:36:32,786 --> 00:36:35,205
- Romeo.
- The one who came with your letter.

524
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:37,207
- What?
- Good morrow, cousin.

525
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,209
Is the day so young?

526
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:42,462
- But new struck nine.
- Ay me. Sad hours seem long.

527
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:45,464
What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours?

528
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:47,967
Not having that which having
makes them short.

529
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,968
- Good.
- In love?

530
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:51,887
- Out.
- Of love?

531
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,890
- Out of her favor where I am in love.
- Don't spend it all at once.

532
00:36:58,226 --> 00:37:00,144
Yes, sir.

533
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:03,063
- Do you understand me?
- No, sir.

534
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:06,400
You're speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

535
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:09,736
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

536
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,821
- Juliet? You mean Ethel.
- God's teeth!

537
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:15,324
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

538
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:20,162
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

539
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,334
I- I'm very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

540
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:29,503
Of course you have not.
I have not written it.

541
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:31,505
Go once more.

542
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,382
Will.

543
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:35,842
Where is Mercutio?

544
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,845
Locked safe in here. I'll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

545
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:40,847
I have a sonnet to write.

546
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,015
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

547
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:49,563
For Lady Viola De Lesseps,

548
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:53,566
by the hand of Thomas Kent.

549
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,402
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

550
00:37:56,486 --> 00:37:59,947
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

551
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,619
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May-"

552
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,704
Two hours at prayer!

553
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,206
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

554
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,208
Piety is for Sunday!

555
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,211
And two hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

556
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,730
It would be better
that you return tomorrow, my lord.

557
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:20,836
It would be better if you'd tell her to
get off her knees and show some civility...

558
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:23,051
to her six-day
lord and master!

559
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,430
Mmmph!

560
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:34,978
My lady Viola.

561
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,480
Lord Wessex.
You've been waiting.

562
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:39,482
I am aware of it.

563
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:42,652
But it is
beauty's privilege.

564
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:44,820
You flatter, my lord.

565
00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:48,657
No. I have spoken
to the queen.

566
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,993
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife,

567
00:38:52,077 --> 00:38:54,996
and once given,
her consent is her command.

568
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,498
Do you intend to marry,
my lord?

569
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,834
Your father should keep you
better informed.

570
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:02,336
He has bought me for you.

571
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:07,007
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

572
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,300
You are allowed
to show your pleasure.

573
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:13,763
But I do not love you,
my lord.

574
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:16,598
How your mind hops about.

575
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:19,017
Your father
was a shopkeeper.

576
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:21,478
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

577
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:24,022
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

578
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:26,024
You will like Virginia.

579
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:28,693
- Virginia?
- Oh, yes.

580
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:31,862
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

581
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:35,490
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

582
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,493
I fancy tobacco
has a future.

583
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,537
We will not stay there long.
Three or four years.

584
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,040
But why me?

585
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:46,041
It was your eyes.

586
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,502
No, your lips.

587
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,639
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

588
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:04,641
The queen has consented?

589
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:06,643
She wants to inspect you.

590
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:09,312
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

591
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:13,733
Be submissive,
modest, grateful...

592
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:15,734
and brief.

593
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:20,322
I will do my duty, my lord.

594
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:29,663
"Master Will, poet dearest to my heart,

595
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:33,667
I beseech you
banish me from yours.

596
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,003
I am to marry Lord Wessex.

597
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:40,506
A daughter's duty...

598
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,009
and the queen's command."

599
00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:08,364
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

600
00:41:10,324 --> 00:41:13,953
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

601
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:17,289
Are you a lady Mr. Kent

602
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:19,124
I'm very sorry, sir.

603
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,629
We're gonna have to do it again.

604
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,382
You did not like the speech?

605
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,384
No, the speech is excellent.

606
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:34,137
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you."

607
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:36,473
Excellent,
and a good length.

608
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:40,935
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

609
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,313
There.
You have this duel.

610
00:41:44,396 --> 00:41:48,191
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

611
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:53,321
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

612
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:56,157
"A plague
on both your houses!"

613
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:03,580
He dies?

614
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,085
- Ohh!
- Will!

615
00:42:09,168 --> 00:42:11,170
Where are my pages?

616
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:25,349
Did you give her my letter?

617
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:29,144
And this is for you!

618
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:45,367
Oh, Thomas,
she has cut my strings.

619
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:48,703
I'm unmanned,

620
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:51,873
unmended and unmade,

621
00:42:51,956 --> 00:42:53,875
like a puppet in a box.

622
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,043
- Writer, is he?
- Row your boat!

623
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,379
She tells me to keep away.

624
00:42:58,462 --> 00:43:01,715
She is to marry Lord Wessex!
What should I do?

625
00:43:01,798 --> 00:43:04,718
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

626
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:07,720
- And break her heart and mine?
- It is only yours you can know.

627
00:43:07,804 --> 00:43:09,722
She loves me, Thomas!

628
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:11,724
- Does she say so?
- No.

629
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:14,727
And yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

630
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,230
- Was she weeping when
she gave you this? - Uh-

631
00:43:18,313 --> 00:43:21,066
- Her letter came to me by the nurse.
- Your aunt.

632
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:23,067
Yes, my aunt.

633
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,029
But perhaps
she wept a little.

634
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:31,575
Tell me how
you love her, Will.

635
00:43:31,658 --> 00:43:35,370
Like a sickness
and its cure together.

636
00:43:35,453 --> 00:43:37,956
Oh, yes.

637
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:40,416
Like rain and sun.

638
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:43,085
Like cold and heat.

639
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:46,004
Is your lady beautiful?

640
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:49,674
Since I came here from the country,

641
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:51,676
I have not seen her close.

642
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:54,679
Tell me, is-
is she beautiful?

643
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:58,474
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes,

644
00:43:58,557 --> 00:44:01,435
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

645
00:44:02,602 --> 00:44:05,271
A- A-And her lips?

646
00:44:05,355 --> 00:44:07,273
Her lips?

647
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:10,860
The early morning rose would whither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

648
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,612
And her voice,
like lark's song?

649
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:16,615
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

650
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:20,285
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

651
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:23,037
- Ah, she sings too?
- Constantly.

652
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,499
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

653
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,626
And her bosom.

654
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:30,878
Did I mention her bosom?

655
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:32,754
What of her bosom?

656
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:35,423
Oh, Thomas,
a pair of pippins...

657
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:38,426
as round and rare
as golden apples.

658
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,470
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

659
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:44,973
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

660
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:49,436
when her eyes and lips and voice
may be no more beautiful than mine.

661
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,313
Besides, can a-

662
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:54,774
can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

663
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:58,110
love happily with
a bankside poet and player?

664
00:44:58,193 --> 00:45:00,487
Yes, by God!

665
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:03,323
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

666
00:45:03,406 --> 00:45:06,576
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king.

667
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:09,078
Their love
should be minded by each,

668
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:11,831
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

669
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:14,917
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

670
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,918
But what of Lord Wessex?

671
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:20,422
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

672
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:30,347
Oh, Will.

673
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:34,017
Thank you, my lady.

674
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:37,353
Lady?

675
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:40,356
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

676
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:42,650
Wouldn't deceive a child.

677
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:49,030
Strangely enough,
I'm a bit of a writer meself.

678
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:51,699
It wouldn't take you long
to read it.

679
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:54,493
I expect you'd know
all the booksellers!

680
00:46:03,084 --> 00:46:05,003
Can you love a fool?

681
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:07,880
Can you love a player?

682
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:17,556
Wait!

683
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:18,865
You're still a maid,

684
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:21,892
and perhaps as mistook in me
as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

685
00:46:21,976 --> 00:46:24,228
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

686
00:46:24,312 --> 00:46:25,896
I am.

687
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,899
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

688
00:46:41,952 --> 00:46:44,871
I do not know
how to undress a man.

689
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:46,873
It is strange to me too.

690
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:02,899
Go to. Go to.

691
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,032
I would not
have thought it.

692
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:16,203
There is something
better than a play.

693
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:18,872
There is.

694
00:48:18,955 --> 00:48:21,374
Even your play.

695
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,377
Oh?

696
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,256
And that was only
my first try.

697
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:47,689
Will.

698
00:48:49,774 --> 00:48:52,193
You would not leave me.

699
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,695
I must.

700
00:48:54,779 --> 00:48:56,697
Look how pale the window.

701
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,699
Moonlight.

702
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:01,660
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

703
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:04,829
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

704
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:09,333
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

705
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:13,170
Mr. Henslowe?

706
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:15,672
Mmm, let him be damned
for his pages.

707
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:17,674
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

708
00:49:17,757 --> 00:49:20,677
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

709
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,379
It's broad day.
The rooster tells us so.

710
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,056
It was the owl.
Believe me, love, it was the owl.

711
00:49:27,474 --> 00:49:30,393
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

712
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:35,857
My lady?

713
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,692
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

714
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:42,196
It is a new world.

715
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:45,198
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

716
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,909
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

717
00:49:47,992 --> 00:49:51,204
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

718
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:54,707
and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.

719
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,502
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

720
00:49:58,585 --> 00:50:00,504
Aye, pilgrim.

721
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:03,006
Lips that they must use
in prayer.

722
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:06,259
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

723
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:08,260
They pray.

724
00:50:08,344 --> 00:50:11,764
Grant thou, lest faith
turn to despair.

725
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:15,267
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

726
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:18,895
It's you.

727
00:50:18,978 --> 00:50:21,397
Suffering cats!

728
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,566
Then move not...

729
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:26,693
while my prayer's effect
I take.

730
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:34,450
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

731
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:37,286
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

732
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:42,124
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

733
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,835
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

734
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:46,920
It is more-
Let me.

735
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:49,964
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

736
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:54,343
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

737
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,351
- You kiss by the book.
- Well, Will!

738
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:05,520
It was lucky you were here.

739
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:08,022
- Why do not I write the
rest of your play- - Yes, yes!

740
00:51:08,105 --> 00:51:12,317
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

741
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:16,279
Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.

742
00:51:18,072 --> 00:51:20,825
- What is her mother?
- Marry, bachelor,

743
00:51:20,908 --> 00:51:23,494
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...

744
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:25,788
and a wise and virtuous.

745
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:28,790
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

746
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:31,960
I tell you, he that
can lay hold of her...

747
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:33,962
shall have the chinks.

748
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:36,047
- Is she a Capulet?
- Mmm.

749
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,883
Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe's debt.

750
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:42,761
Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.

751
00:51:42,844 --> 00:51:45,930
Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.

752
00:51:47,098 --> 00:51:50,351
Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?

753
00:51:50,434 --> 00:51:52,812
The son and heir
of old Tiberio.

754
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:55,522
Let it be night.

755
00:51:55,606 --> 00:51:57,837
<i>What's he that follows here
that would not dance?</i>

756
00:51:57,937 --> 00:51:59,568
<i>I know not.</i>

757
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,528
Go ask his name.

758
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:06,699
If he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

759
00:52:06,782 --> 00:52:09,868
No, do not go.

760
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:11,870
I must. I must.

761
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:15,206
- The only son of your great enemy.
- Terrible.

762
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,375
Simply... terrible!

763
00:52:23,797 --> 00:52:28,718
"But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

764
00:52:28,802 --> 00:52:30,887
It is the east,

765
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,598
and Juliet is the sun.

766
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:38,227
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

767
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:41,230
who is already sick
and pale with grief...

768
00:52:41,313 --> 00:52:45,859
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she."

769
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:48,736
- Oh, Will.
- Yes, some of it's speakable.

770
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,572
"It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!

771
00:52:51,655 --> 00:52:54,491
Oh, that she knew she were!

772
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:58,161
The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...

773
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:00,538
as daylight doth a lamp."

774
00:53:00,622 --> 00:53:03,750
Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...

775
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,419
stream so bright...

776
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:11,131
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

777
00:53:11,215 --> 00:53:14,884
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

778
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:17,887
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand,

779
00:53:17,971 --> 00:53:20,223
that I might touch
that cheek.

780
00:53:20,306 --> 00:53:23,434
- Ay, me.
- "Oh, Romeo.

781
00:53:23,517 --> 00:53:25,561
Romeo.

782
00:53:25,644 --> 00:53:28,230
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

783
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:31,941
- Deny thy father and-"
- Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

784
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:34,819
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

785
00:53:34,902 --> 00:53:37,655
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

786
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:40,115
Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?

787
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:44,619
"What man art thou that
thus bescreened in night...

788
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:47,413
so stumblest
on my counsel?"

789
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:50,708
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

790
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:55,462
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

791
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:59,007
Had I it written
I would tear the word.

792
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:03,428
"The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...

793
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:06,680
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

794
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:09,349
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

795
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:12,477
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee."

796
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:16,981
Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

797
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:21,485
<i>Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.</i>

798
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:23,862
<i>Would not for the world
they saw thee here.</i>

799
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:26,865
<i>I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.</i>

800
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:29,970
<i>And but thou love me
let them find me here.</i>

801
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,495
Good night. Good night,

802
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:35,456
as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...

803
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,917
as that within my breast.

804
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,210
Oh, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?"

805
00:54:40,294 --> 00:54:42,212
That's my line.

806
00:54:42,295 --> 00:54:44,339
Oh. It is mine too.

807
00:54:44,422 --> 00:54:47,342
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

808
00:54:47,425 --> 00:54:50,261
What satifaction
canst thou have tonight?

809
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:53,263
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

810
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:56,808
"My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.

811
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:59,519
My love is deep.

812
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:02,146
The more I give to thee,

813
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,190
the more I have,

814
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:06,275
for both are infinite."

815
00:55:08,258 --> 00:55:08,819
Madam?

816
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:12,016
I hear some noise within.
Dear love, adieu.

817
00:55:12,116 --> 00:55:13,031
Juliet!

818
00:55:13,114 --> 00:55:15,024
"Anon, good nurse."

819
00:55:15,124 --> 00:55:18,035
- Anon, good nurse.
- Sweet Montague, be true.

820
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:21,038
"Stay but a little.
I will come again."

821
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:24,041
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

822
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:26,543
Oh, blessed, blessed night.

823
00:55:27,794 --> 00:55:30,213
"I am afeared...

824
00:55:30,296 --> 00:55:34,717
being in night,
all this is but a dream.

825
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,219
Too flattering sweet...

826
00:55:37,303 --> 00:55:39,221
to be substantial."

827
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,310
To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.

828
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:47,395
A thousand times,
good night.

829
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:49,897
A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.

830
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,609
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

831
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:56,862
I have no neck in this pig dress.

832
00:56:00,823 --> 00:56:04,535
- How is it?
- It's all right.

833
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:11,208
Ned, I know, I know.

834
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:14,210
- It's good.
- Oh?

835
00:56:14,294 --> 00:56:17,046
The title won't do.

836
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:18,881
Ah.

837
00:56:18,965 --> 00:56:22,426
Romeo and Juliet.
Just a suggestion.

838
00:56:24,135 --> 00:56:25,754
Thank you, Ned.

839
00:56:28,322 --> 00:56:29,658
You are a gentleman.

840
00:56:29,758 --> 00:56:32,874
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

841
00:56:32,877 --> 00:56:34,582
What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

842
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,588
By the hour of nine,
I shall not fail.

843
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:37,981
'Tis 20 year till then.

844
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:40,233
<i>I have forgot
why I called thee back.</i>

845
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:43,028
- You mean no dog of any kind?
- Shh! Silence.

846
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:45,780
The friar marries them in secret,

847
00:56:45,863 --> 00:56:48,783
then Ned gets into a fight
with one of the Capulets.

848
00:56:48,866 --> 00:56:52,870
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned's way. I mean, in Mercutio's way.

849
00:56:52,953 --> 00:56:56,123
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

850
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:58,500
Then the prince
banishes him from Verona.

851
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,877
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

852
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,879
on the island
of the pirate king.

853
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:06,840
For God's sake,
cease your prattling and get out!

854
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,384
Get out!

855
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,972
A thousand apologies.

856
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,476
Please.

857
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,312
And with a silken thread
plucks it back again,

858
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:23,647
so loving-jealous
of his liberty.

859
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,503
I would I were thy bird.

860
00:57:25,603 --> 00:57:28,777
Sweet, so would I; yet I should kill thee
with much cherishing.

861
00:57:29,861 --> 00:57:33,030
Good night.
Good night.

862
00:57:33,114 --> 00:57:37,785
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.

863
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:48,461
Sunday.

864
00:57:48,544 --> 00:57:50,671
'Tis Sunday.

865
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,221
I found something
in my sleep.

866
00:58:00,305 --> 00:58:04,850
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

867
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:08,937
- But it will end well for love.
- In heaven, perhaps.

868
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:11,940
It is not a comedy
I'm writing now.

869
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:16,736
A broad river
divides my lovers.

870
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:19,989
Family, duty, fate.

871
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:25,619
As unchangeable as nature.

872
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,620
Yes.

873
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,666
This is not life, Will.

874
00:58:31,749 --> 00:58:34,793
It is a stolen season.

875
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:36,795
- Be patient, my lord.
- Patient?

876
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:39,756
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
- My Lord, I will go-

877
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,926
Sunday. Greenwich!

878
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:48,347
Now, pay attention, nursie.

879
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:50,933
The queen-
Gloriana Regina,

880
00:58:51,016 --> 00:58:54,519
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us-

881
00:58:54,603 --> 00:58:57,731
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening's festivities...

882
00:58:57,814 --> 00:59:00,983
to bestow her gracious favor
on my choice of wife.

883
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,594
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

884
00:59:03,678 --> 00:59:05,113
So get you to my lady's chamber...

885
00:59:05,213 --> 00:59:07,948
and produce her
with or without her undergarments!

886
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:10,367
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

887
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,995
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

888
00:59:14,078 --> 00:59:16,539
To be the wife
of a poor player.

889
00:59:16,622 --> 00:59:20,501
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

890
00:59:20,584 --> 00:59:23,879
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

891
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:26,798
You follow your desire
freely enough in the night.

892
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:30,468
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
- Then I'll go with you.

893
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:33,304
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
- I know how to fight.

894
00:59:33,387 --> 00:59:35,889
Stage fighting.

895
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:38,058
Oh, Will.

896
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:41,645
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you,

897
00:59:41,728 --> 00:59:45,064
but as Viola,
the river divides us,

898
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:49,235
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

899
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:52,237
I'll drag her down
by the queen's command!

900
00:59:55,157 --> 00:59:57,158
Good morning, my Lord.

901
00:59:57,242 --> 01:00:02,288
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

902
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:05,916
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

903
01:00:05,999 --> 01:00:08,460
Are you bringing
your laundrywoman?

904
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:13,548
Her chaperone,
my lady's country cousin.

905
01:00:13,631 --> 01:00:17,176
My, but you be
a handsome gallant,

906
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:19,595
just as she said.

907
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:22,139
You may call me
Miss Wilhelmina.

908
01:00:22,222 --> 01:00:24,641
On a more fortuitous
occasion, perhaps.

909
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:27,560
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

910
01:00:27,644 --> 01:00:32,273
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

911
01:01:05,302 --> 01:01:07,220
- Now?
- Now.

912
01:01:07,304 --> 01:01:10,307
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

913
01:01:13,226 --> 01:01:15,520
- Is there a man?
- A man, my lord?

914
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:19,189
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

915
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:22,150
- Does he come to the house?
- A theater poet?

916
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:25,737
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

917
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,114
- Has he been to the house?
- Marlowe?

918
01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:30,491
Oh, yes. He is the one.

919
01:01:30,575 --> 01:01:34,119
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

920
01:01:34,203 --> 01:01:36,872
That dog!

921
01:01:52,636 --> 01:01:54,679
Your Majesty.

922
01:01:55,889 --> 01:01:58,182
Stand up straight, girl.

923
01:02:01,811 --> 01:02:03,729
I've seen you.

924
01:02:03,812 --> 01:02:07,524
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

925
01:02:07,607 --> 01:02:10,193
Your Majesty.

926
01:02:10,276 --> 01:02:12,695
What do you love so much?

927
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:15,239
- Your Majesty-
- Speak up, girl!

928
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:17,408
I know who I am.

929
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:20,869
Do you love stories
of kings and queens?

930
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:22,871
Of feats of arms?

931
01:02:22,954 --> 01:02:25,665
Or is it courtly love?

932
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:27,709
I love theater.

933
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:30,753
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed-

934
01:02:30,836 --> 01:02:34,465
They're not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

935
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:38,635
And I love poetry above all.

936
01:02:38,718 --> 01:02:40,637
Above Lord Wessex?

937
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,264
My lord,
when you cannot find your wife,

938
01:02:43,348 --> 01:02:45,766
you better look for her
at the playhouse.

939
01:02:48,102 --> 01:02:51,063
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

940
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:54,482
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

941
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:56,484
They cannot make it true.

942
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:59,362
Oh, but they can.

943
01:03:01,822 --> 01:03:06,910
I mean, Your Majesty, they-
they do not, they have... not,

944
01:03:06,994 --> 01:03:09,287
but I believe
there is one who can.

945
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,416
My Lady Viola is young in the world.

946
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:15,459
Your Majesty is wise in it.

947
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,545
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

948
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,506
I thought you were here
because you had none.

949
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,243
Well, no one will take your wager,
it seems.

950
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:31,799
Fifty pounds.

951
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,144
Fifty pounds?

952
01:03:37,687 --> 01:03:42,608
A very worthy sum
on a very worthy question.

953
01:03:42,692 --> 01:03:46,070
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

954
01:03:47,905 --> 01:03:51,158
I bear witness to the wager...

955
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:54,369
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

956
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,790
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

957
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:03,293
Are there
no more fireworks?

958
01:04:03,377 --> 01:04:07,297
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

959
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,593
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

960
01:04:11,676 --> 01:04:15,638
She's been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

961
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,640
It takes a woman to know it.

962
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:24,187
Marlowe.

963
01:04:35,113 --> 01:04:37,032
Burbage?

964
01:04:37,115 --> 01:04:39,993
Huh? Who's there?

965
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,745
Marlowe.

966
01:04:44,288 --> 01:04:46,332
You are playing
my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

967
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,625
Don't spend yourself
in sport.

968
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:52,295
- What do you want, Kit?
- My Massacre at Paris is complete.

969
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:55,673
- What? You have the last act?
- If you have the money.

970
01:04:55,757 --> 01:04:57,650
Tomorrow.

971
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,844
Then tomorrow
you shall have the pages.

972
01:04:59,927 --> 01:05:02,221
Oh, will you desist, madam!

973
01:05:02,304 --> 01:05:05,823
- Oh!
- Twenty pounds on delivery.

974
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:08,601
Now, what is money to men like us?

975
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:14,840
Besides, if I need a play, I have
another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

976
01:05:14,923 --> 01:05:16,400
Oh, Romeo.

977
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:19,736
- Gave it to Henslowe.
- Never!

978
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,822
Well, I'm to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

979
01:05:22,864 --> 01:05:25,992
I gave Shakespeare
two sovereigns for Romeo.

980
01:05:26,075 --> 01:05:30,496
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's
Men have the playing of it at the Rose.

981
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:32,539
Treachery!

982
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:36,126
Traitor and thief!

983
01:05:39,045 --> 01:05:41,297
Oh, no.

984
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:43,382
No!

985
01:06:01,148 --> 01:06:03,233
By my head,
here comes the Capulets.

986
01:06:03,317 --> 01:06:06,236
By my heel,
I care not.

987
01:06:07,362 --> 01:06:09,614
Follow me close.
I will speak with them.

988
01:06:09,697 --> 01:06:12,742
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

989
01:06:12,825 --> 01:06:15,077
Are you going
to do it like that?

990
01:06:15,161 --> 01:06:17,371
Positions.

991
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:21,750
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.
- By my heel, I care not.

992
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:24,085
Follow me close.
I will speak to them.

993
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:27,088
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

994
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,591
And but one word with one of us?

995
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:33,469
Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.

996
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:37,264
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his own ink pot?

997
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:39,474
What is this rabble?

998
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:44,603
Draw, if you be a man!

999
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,001
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

1000
01:07:10,877 --> 01:07:14,338
And a dog.

1001
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:17,841
No!

1002
01:07:17,925 --> 01:07:21,178
Have privy, players! Please!

1003
01:07:21,261 --> 01:07:24,138
Oh! Not with my props!

1004
01:07:24,222 --> 01:07:25,640
Oh!

1005
01:07:25,723 --> 01:07:28,642
- Will! What-
- A writer's quarrel.

1006
01:07:28,726 --> 01:07:31,145
Quite normal.

1007
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:34,648
Stay here.

1008
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,994
You are hurt.

1009
01:08:01,797 --> 01:08:05,383
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

1010
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:08,428
- You were cast ashore in a far country.
- Oh, not yet.

1011
01:08:08,511 --> 01:08:10,430
Not yet.

1012
01:08:10,513 --> 01:08:13,474
'Ey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

1013
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:15,893
My investment!
Lambert!

1014
01:08:17,311 --> 01:08:19,563
Vengeance!

1015
01:08:47,004 --> 01:08:49,089
A famous victory!

1016
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:53,259
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

1017
01:08:53,343 --> 01:08:55,887
Oh, what happy hour.

1018
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:59,223
- This is a tavern!
- It is also a tavern.

1019
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:01,934
- I remember you. The poet!
- Yes, William the Conqueror.

1020
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:06,771
One at a time. One at a time.

1021
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:10,733
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

1022
01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:18,615
- It's a house of ill repute.
- It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

1023
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:21,576
Come.
There's no harm in a drink.

1024
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:26,455
You are welcome to my best house.
Here's to the Admiral's Men.

1025
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:28,249
- The Admiral's Men!
- The Admiral's Men!

1026
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:30,250
The Admiral's Men!

1027
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:56,649
Well, I-
I quite liked it.

1028
01:09:56,732 --> 01:09:59,151
Master Kent,

1029
01:09:59,235 --> 01:10:02,070
you have not yet
dipped your wick.

1030
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:06,574
My "wick"?

1031
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:10,453
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the
theater, you must have a part in my play.

1032
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:15,499
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

1033
01:10:15,582 --> 01:10:18,668
My heavens.
I thank you.

1034
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:21,046
What's the play about, then?

1035
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:23,298
Well, there's this nurse-

1036
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:31,513
Silence, silence, silence!

1037
01:10:31,597 --> 01:10:33,974
Master Shakespeare...

1038
01:10:34,057 --> 01:10:38,353
has asked me to play
the part of the apothecary.

1039
01:10:40,563 --> 01:10:43,149
The apothecary?

1040
01:10:43,232 --> 01:10:46,276
What is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

1041
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,528
How does the comedy end?

1042
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:52,824
- By God, I wish I knew.
- By God, if you do not, who does?

1043
01:10:52,907 --> 01:10:56,535
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending,

1044
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,872
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

1045
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,723
Will! Mr. Henslowe!
Gentlemen all!

1046
01:11:19,806 --> 01:11:23,601
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

1047
01:11:23,685 --> 01:11:26,103
Marlowe is dead.

1048
01:11:30,023 --> 01:11:32,359
Stabbed.

1049
01:11:32,442 --> 01:11:36,821
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

1050
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:41,701
What have I done?

1051
01:11:41,784 --> 01:11:44,620
He was the first man among us.

1052
01:11:44,703 --> 01:11:47,372
A great light has gone out.

1053
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:05,180
Forgive me.

1054
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:10,476
God forgive me.

1055
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:40,211
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

1056
01:12:40,294 --> 01:12:42,713
One morning
in the month of May

1057
01:12:42,796 --> 01:12:45,841
From my cot I stray

1058
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:48,593
Just at the dawning
of the day

1059
01:12:48,677 --> 01:12:51,262
I met with
a charming mai-

1060
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:56,934
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1061
01:12:57,017 --> 01:13:00,437
- It's not my riding day, my lord.
- Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1062
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,148
I'm going to church.

1063
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:06,943
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1064
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:10,446
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1065
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:13,824
And on a day of mourning.

1066
01:13:13,907 --> 01:13:17,035
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1067
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:19,120
Mourning?

1068
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:23,624
Who is dead, my lord?

1069
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:28,629
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1070
01:13:28,712 --> 01:13:33,341
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1071
01:13:34,467 --> 01:13:36,386
My lady.

1072
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:40,139
- He is dead?
- Killed last night in a tavern.

1073
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:44,518
Come then.
We'll say a prayer for his soul.

1074
01:13:49,397 --> 01:13:57,780
Who can remember sorrow

1075
01:14:29,016 --> 01:14:34,104
Spare me, dear ghost.

1076
01:14:34,187 --> 01:14:37,023
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1077
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:52,203
Will!

1078
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:55,539
Oh, my love.

1079
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:57,541
I thought you were dead.

1080
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:05,548
It is worse.

1081
01:15:05,632 --> 01:15:07,884
I've killed a man.

1082
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:14,890
Marlowe's touch
was in my Titus Andronicus,

1083
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:18,643
and my Henry VI was a house built
on his foundations.

1084
01:15:19,769 --> 01:15:22,355
You never spoke
so well of him.

1085
01:15:22,438 --> 01:15:25,566
He was not dead before.

1086
01:15:25,649 --> 01:15:30,404
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1087
01:15:31,738 --> 01:15:33,907
You lie.

1088
01:15:35,575 --> 01:15:39,745
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1089
01:15:39,829 --> 01:15:42,289
My love is no lie.

1090
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:46,001
I have a wife, yes,

1091
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:49,337
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1092
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:53,132
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that,

1093
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:57,594
and yet, you let me
come to your bed.

1094
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:00,931
Calf-love.

1095
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:05,435
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1096
01:16:05,518 --> 01:16:08,271
I was the more deceived.

1097
01:16:08,354 --> 01:16:11,273
Yes, you were deceived,

1098
01:16:11,357 --> 01:16:14,735
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1099
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:20,448
I love you, Will,

1100
01:16:20,531 --> 01:16:22,617
beyond poetry.

1101
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,202
Oh, my love.

1102
01:16:25,686 --> 01:16:28,631
- You ran from me before.
- When I thought you dead...

1103
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:31,708
I did not care about all the plays
that would never come,

1104
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:34,502
only that I would
never see your face.

1105
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:37,880
I saw our end,
and it will come.

1106
01:16:37,964 --> 01:16:42,468
- You cannot marry Wessex.
- If not you, why not Wessex?

1107
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:45,137
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause,

1108
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,305
and there will be
no more Will Shakespeare.

1109
01:16:47,405 --> 01:16:49,891
No. No.

1110
01:16:49,974 --> 01:16:54,478
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows,

1111
01:16:54,562 --> 01:16:57,481
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1112
01:16:59,066 --> 01:17:02,319
For killing Juliet's
kinsman Tybalt,

1113
01:17:02,402 --> 01:17:05,321
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio,

1114
01:17:05,405 --> 01:17:07,365
Romeo is banished.

1115
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:10,034
- But the friar who married
Romeo and Juliet- - Is that me?

1116
01:17:10,117 --> 01:17:14,996
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1117
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,833
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1118
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:21,878
She is placed in the tomb
of the Capulets.

1119
01:17:21,961 --> 01:17:24,713
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1120
01:17:28,074 --> 01:17:30,969
I have not said all.

1121
01:17:31,052 --> 01:17:36,224
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar's plan.

1122
01:17:37,307 --> 01:17:39,985
He hears only
that Juliet is dead.

1123
01:17:40,868 --> 01:17:43,071
And thus he goes
to the apothecary...

1124
01:17:43,155 --> 01:17:44,773
That's me.

1125
01:17:44,856 --> 01:17:47,108
and buys a deadly poison.

1126
01:17:47,192 --> 01:17:52,113
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

1127
01:17:52,196 --> 01:17:54,532
He drinks the poison.

1128
01:17:55,991 --> 01:17:58,243
He dies by her side,

1129
01:17:59,828 --> 01:18:03,289
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1130
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:06,501
And so Juliet
takes his dagger...

1131
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:11,463
and then kills herself.

1132
01:18:14,966 --> 01:18:17,677
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1133
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,638
Sad... and wonderful.

1134
01:18:21,806 --> 01:18:24,642
I have a blue velvet cap
that'll do well.

1135
01:18:24,725 --> 01:18:27,477
I've seen just such a cap
on an apothecary.

1136
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:29,563
Just so.

1137
01:18:30,814 --> 01:18:33,900
Yes, it will serve.

1138
01:18:35,818 --> 01:18:38,112
But there's a scene missing.

1139
01:18:38,195 --> 01:18:41,073
Between marriage
and death?

1140
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:51,582
The play...
all written out for you.

1141
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:55,753
I had the clerk
at Bridewell do it.

1142
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:58,255
He has a good fist
for lettering.

1143
01:19:00,423 --> 01:19:02,342
There is a new scene.

1144
01:19:09,014 --> 01:19:10,816
Will you read in for me?

1145
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:13,918
"Wilt thou be gone?
It's not yet near day.

1146
01:19:14,702 --> 01:19:16,354
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1147
01:19:16,438 --> 01:19:19,023
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

1148
01:19:19,107 --> 01:19:22,193
Nightly she sings
on yon pomegranate tree.

1149
01:19:22,276 --> 01:19:25,112
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale."

1150
01:19:25,195 --> 01:19:29,241
"It was the lark,
the herald of the morn;

1151
01:19:29,324 --> 01:19:31,659
no nightingale.

1152
01:19:31,743 --> 01:19:34,662
Look, love,
what envious streaks...

1153
01:19:34,746 --> 01:19:38,874
do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.

1154
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:42,794
Night's candles
are burnt out,

1155
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,297
and jocund day
stands tiptoe...

1156
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,758
on the misty mountaintops.

1157
01:19:48,841 --> 01:19:53,304
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die."

1158
01:19:55,055 --> 01:19:59,100
"Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, I.

1159
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:02,145
It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...

1160
01:20:02,228 --> 01:20:06,899
to be to thee this night
a torchbearer...

1161
01:20:06,982 --> 01:20:10,194
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

1162
01:20:11,862 --> 01:20:14,114
Therefore, stay yet.

1163
01:20:15,323 --> 01:20:17,742
Thou needst not
to be gone."

1164
01:20:17,825 --> 01:20:20,077
"Let me be ta'en,

1165
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:23,247
let me be put to death;

1166
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:27,668
I am content,
so thou wilt have it so.

1167
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:30,337
I have more care
to stay...

1168
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,797
than will to go.

1169
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,258
Come, death, and welcome.

1170
01:20:35,341 --> 01:20:38,344
Juliet wills it so."

1171
01:21:01,281 --> 01:21:04,367
You will go far, I fear.

1172
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:10,873
I hope we work
together again.

1173
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:16,544
"Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua's law...

1174
01:21:16,628 --> 01:21:20,923
is death, death to
any he that utters them."

1175
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:22,633
Then him. Then me.

1176
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:26,219
"Put- Put this...

1177
01:21:26,303 --> 01:21:28,680
- in any liquid thing you will and-"
- Hah!

1178
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:32,975
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

1179
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:37,062
How silver sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night.

1180
01:21:37,146 --> 01:21:39,064
- Like soft music-
- Shakespeare!

1181
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:58,456
Upstart inky pup!

1182
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:02,460
I'll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1183
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:10,259
- You're on my ground now!
- By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

1184
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,260
I am more than enough!

1185
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:22,102
Move!

1186
01:23:44,008 --> 01:23:46,177
Absent friends.

1187
01:23:47,795 --> 01:23:50,456
This is the murderer
of Kit Marlowe!

1188
01:23:51,832 --> 01:23:53,350
Will?

1189
01:23:53,434 --> 01:23:55,400
I rejoiced in his death
because I thought it was yours!

1190
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:56,986
That is all I know of Marlowe!

1191
01:23:57,370 --> 01:24:00,356
Will? Uh, it's true.

1192
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,234
It was a... tavern brawl.

1193
01:24:03,317 --> 01:24:08,280
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1194
01:24:08,363 --> 01:24:10,574
A quarrel about the bill.

1195
01:24:10,657 --> 01:24:13,910
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1196
01:24:13,993 --> 01:24:16,371
Not the billing,
the bill!

1197
01:24:20,082 --> 01:24:22,376
Oh, God.

1198
01:24:22,759 --> 01:24:25,362
- I am free of it.
- Where is she?

1199
01:24:26,996 --> 01:24:28,448
Close it.

1200
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:29,812
My Lord Wessex.

1201
01:24:29,912 --> 01:24:32,593
The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name!

1202
01:24:32,677 --> 01:24:34,887
Take it down
stone by stone.

1203
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:38,682
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1204
01:24:38,765 --> 01:24:40,642
Mr. Tilney,
what is this?

1205
01:24:40,726 --> 01:24:43,144
Sedition and indecency.

1206
01:24:43,228 --> 01:24:45,938
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

1207
01:24:46,022 --> 01:24:48,649
- Where, boy?
- There.

1208
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:50,901
I saw her bubbies.

1209
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:55,364
So, a woman on the stage!

1210
01:24:55,447 --> 01:24:59,576
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1211
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:01,119
Why, sir?

1212
01:25:01,202 --> 01:25:05,331
For lewdness
and unshamedfacedness!

1213
01:25:05,414 --> 01:25:10,293
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1214
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,434
Not him, her!

1215
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:32,438
That's who I meant.

1216
01:25:35,107 --> 01:25:38,610
- He's a woman.
- This theater is closed.

1217
01:25:40,529 --> 01:25:43,948
Notice will be posted!

1218
01:25:44,032 --> 01:25:46,993
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1219
01:25:47,076 --> 01:25:49,954
- Nobody knew.
- He did.

1220
01:25:50,037 --> 01:25:53,040
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1221
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,628
It is over.

1222
01:25:58,711 --> 01:26:01,464
I'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1223
01:26:15,893 --> 01:26:18,813
I wanted to be an actor.

1224
01:26:18,896 --> 01:26:21,357
I'm so sorry, Will.

1225
01:26:27,404 --> 01:26:30,490
You were... w-w-

1226
01:26:31,741 --> 01:26:33,993
w- wonderful.

1227
01:26:35,578 --> 01:26:37,830
Thank you.

1228
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:50,674
"Let me put this in any
liquid thing you will and-"

1229
01:26:57,097 --> 01:26:59,682
Everything all right?

1230
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:40,343
I would've been good.

1231
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:43,513
- I would've been great.
- So would I.

1232
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:46,015
We both would.

1233
01:28:08,285 --> 01:28:10,745
Lambert, kill him.

1234
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,332
That can wait.

1235
01:28:18,002 --> 01:28:23,215
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1236
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,968
But my father,
James Burbage,

1237
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:31,514
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty,

1238
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:36,310
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1239
01:28:36,393 --> 01:28:39,896
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1240
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,981
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1241
01:28:43,483 --> 01:28:47,945
I have a theater.
The curtain is yours.

1242
01:29:20,891 --> 01:29:24,769
Will!
We'll be needing a Romeo.

1243
01:29:31,567 --> 01:29:33,694
Oranges!
Sweet oranges!

1244
01:30:01,469 --> 01:30:05,681
My ship is moored at bankside, bound for
Virginia on the afternoon tide.

1245
01:30:05,764 --> 01:30:07,849
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.

1246
01:30:07,933 --> 01:30:09,851
You are gaining a colony.

1247
01:30:09,934 --> 01:30:12,770
And you, my lord,
are gaining 5,000 pounds...

1248
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:15,356
by these drafts in my hand.

1249
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:18,192
Would you oblige me
with 50 or so in gold...

1250
01:30:18,275 --> 01:30:21,361
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1251
01:30:22,654 --> 01:30:25,532
Ah, the bride!

1252
01:30:26,783 --> 01:30:29,702
Good morning, my lord.

1253
01:30:29,785 --> 01:30:33,747
I see you are... open for business,
so let's to church.

1254
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,879
Be gone!

1255
01:30:40,962 --> 01:30:43,089
Hup, hup, hup!

1256
01:31:39,264 --> 01:31:41,182
Oh, my lord!

1257
01:31:41,266 --> 01:31:43,851
- Be good to her, my lord.
- I will.

1258
01:31:43,935 --> 01:31:46,020
Oh, God bless you!

1259
01:31:46,103 --> 01:31:48,939
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There's a good nurse.

1260
01:31:49,022 --> 01:31:50,983
The tide will not wait!

1261
01:31:51,066 --> 01:31:54,944
Farewell!
You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

1262
01:32:21,468 --> 01:32:26,139
Candy apples!

1263
01:32:26,222 --> 01:32:29,767
Buy my apples!

1264
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:36,481
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1265
01:32:43,988 --> 01:32:47,366
Is this, uh-
Is this all right?

1266
01:32:47,449 --> 01:32:49,368
Yeah.

1267
01:33:04,673 --> 01:33:09,010
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1268
01:33:09,094 --> 01:33:13,639
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1269
01:33:13,723 --> 01:33:18,685
This is the very business
of show!

1270
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:32,364
T- T- T-Two-

1271
01:33:32,448 --> 01:33:35,075
T- T-T-T- T- T-

1272
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:38,828
T- T-T-Two households-

1273
01:33:38,912 --> 01:33:41,873
- We're lost.
- No, it will turn out well.

1274
01:33:41,956 --> 01:33:45,417
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1275
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,465
T- T- T- T-T-

1276
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:53,883
T- T-

1277
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,723
Two households,

1278
01:34:47,806 --> 01:34:50,934
both alike in dignity,

1279
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:53,770
in fair Verona,

1280
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:56,839
where we lay our scene.

1281
01:34:56,922 --> 01:34:59,967
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny,

1282
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:03,428
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1283
01:35:03,511 --> 01:35:06,514
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1284
01:35:06,598 --> 01:35:09,725
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1285
01:35:09,809 --> 01:35:12,561
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1286
01:35:12,645 --> 01:35:16,106
doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

1287
01:35:19,275 --> 01:35:22,362
...the which of you
with patient ears attend,

1288
01:35:22,445 --> 01:35:27,199
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1289
01:35:33,538 --> 01:35:35,540
- Wonderful.
- Was it...

1290
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:38,709
good?

1291
01:35:41,462 --> 01:35:44,631
Gregory, on my word
we'll not carry coals.

1292
01:35:44,715 --> 01:35:47,759
No, for then
we should be colliers.

1293
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:50,345
I mean, and we be
in choler we'll draw.

1294
01:35:50,428 --> 01:35:53,514
- Master Shakespeare.
- Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1295
01:35:53,598 --> 01:35:56,058
It's not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1296
01:35:56,142 --> 01:35:59,311
Do me a speech.
Do me a line.

1297
01:35:59,394 --> 01:36:03,231
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

1298
01:36:03,315 --> 01:36:06,567
- Another little problem.
- What do we do now?

1299
01:36:06,651 --> 01:36:10,571
- The show must- You know.
- Go on!

1300
01:36:10,654 --> 01:36:14,074
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1301
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:16,576
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1302
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,953
- Fear me not.
- No, marry, I fear thee!

1303
01:36:21,372 --> 01:36:24,250
- Let them begin.
- I will frown as I pass by.

1304
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:28,128
- Let them take it as they list!
- Nay, as they dare.

1305
01:36:28,212 --> 01:36:32,257
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.

1306
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,260
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

1307
01:36:35,343 --> 01:36:38,638
- I do bite my thumb, sir.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

1308
01:36:38,721 --> 01:36:42,349
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

1309
01:36:42,433 --> 01:36:44,351
- Can we talk?
- Shh!

1310
01:36:44,434 --> 01:36:47,270
- We have no Juliet.
- No Juliet?

1311
01:36:47,354 --> 01:36:50,481
- No Juliet?
- It'll be all right, madam.

1312
01:36:50,565 --> 01:36:53,651
- What happened to Sam? -
Who are you? - Thomas Kent.

1313
01:36:53,734 --> 01:36:56,320
Do you know it?

1314
01:36:56,403 --> 01:36:59,531
- I serve as good a man as you.
- Every word.

1315
01:37:03,368 --> 01:37:05,995
Hyah! Yah!

1316
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:12,793
I'll go along,
no such sight to be shown,

1317
01:37:12,876 --> 01:37:16,004
but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.

1318
01:37:16,088 --> 01:37:18,381
Nurse!

1319
01:37:20,758 --> 01:37:24,011
Where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

1320
01:37:24,095 --> 01:37:27,306
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

1321
01:37:27,389 --> 01:37:29,308
I bade her come.

1322
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:31,476
How now, who calls?

1323
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,312
What, ladybird!

1324
01:37:34,395 --> 01:37:36,147
God forbid!
Where's this girl?

1325
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:38,858
What, lamb!

1326
01:37:38,941 --> 01:37:41,151
What, ladybird!

1327
01:37:42,236 --> 01:37:44,655
What, Juliet!

1328
01:37:45,781 --> 01:37:49,159
How now, who calls?

1329
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:56,707
- We'll all be put in the Clink.
- See you in jail.

1330
01:37:59,835 --> 01:38:03,004
Your mother-
Your mother.

1331
01:38:03,088 --> 01:38:06,382
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

1332
01:38:06,466 --> 01:38:08,509
This is the matter.

1333
01:38:08,592 --> 01:38:11,011
Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.

1334
01:38:11,095 --> 01:38:15,849
Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.

1335
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:19,269
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

1336
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:22,855
- Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
- She's not 14.

1337
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:28,443
Oh, I'll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken,

1338
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:31,279
I have but four-

1339
01:38:53,466 --> 01:38:55,509
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

1340
01:38:55,593 --> 01:39:00,180
how stands your dispositions
to be married?

1341
01:39:00,263 --> 01:39:03,391
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

1342
01:39:07,687 --> 01:39:10,564
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

1343
01:39:18,321 --> 01:39:21,532
I- I'm sped.

1344
01:39:21,616 --> 01:39:24,410
Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.

1345
01:39:24,493 --> 01:39:26,870
Ask for me tomorrow,

1346
01:39:26,954 --> 01:39:29,790
you shall find me
a grave man.

1347
01:39:37,004 --> 01:39:40,257
Yes!

1348
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:47,430
Yah!

1349
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:50,058
"Such mortal drugs I have,

1350
01:39:50,141 --> 01:39:54,812
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them."

1351
01:39:54,895 --> 01:39:57,439
Then him. Then me.

1352
01:40:05,905 --> 01:40:07,990
Romeo, away, be gone!

1353
01:40:08,074 --> 01:40:12,494
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!

1354
01:40:12,578 --> 01:40:16,831
The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

1355
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:20,376
Oh, I am Fortune's fool!

1356
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,378
Why dost thou stay?

1357
01:40:22,461 --> 01:40:24,463
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?

1358
01:40:24,547 --> 01:40:26,757
That murderer,
which way ran he?

1359
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,634
- There lies that Tybalt.
- Up, sir. Go with me.

1360
01:40:29,718 --> 01:40:31,761
I charge thee
in the Prince's name obey.

1361
01:40:31,845 --> 01:40:34,555
Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?

1362
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:36,891
"Oh, I am Fortune's fool."

1363
01:40:39,685 --> 01:40:41,645
You are married?

1364
01:40:45,273 --> 01:40:50,319
"If you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed."

1365
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:08,294
Art thou gone so,

1366
01:41:10,921 --> 01:41:13,048
love, lord,

1367
01:41:13,131 --> 01:41:15,342
aye, husband, friend?

1368
01:41:15,425 --> 01:41:20,179
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1369
01:41:20,263 --> 01:41:23,182
for in a minute
there are many days.

1370
01:41:23,265 --> 01:41:26,852
Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...

1371
01:41:26,935 --> 01:41:29,354
I behold my Romeo.

1372
01:41:29,437 --> 01:41:31,356
Farewell.

1373
01:41:32,857 --> 01:41:35,776
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

1374
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:40,864
Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low,

1375
01:41:40,948 --> 01:41:44,409
as one dead
in the bottom of a tomb.

1376
01:41:44,492 --> 01:41:47,870
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.

1377
01:41:50,122 --> 01:41:52,333
Then trust me, love,

1378
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:54,752
in my eyes, so do you.

1379
01:41:54,835 --> 01:41:58,588
Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.

1380
01:41:58,672 --> 01:42:00,590
Adieu.

1381
01:42:02,091 --> 01:42:04,719
Adieu.

1382
01:42:04,802 --> 01:42:07,555
Take thou this vial,
being then in bed,

1383
01:42:07,638 --> 01:42:10,724
and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.

1384
01:42:10,808 --> 01:42:14,769
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.

1385
01:42:14,853 --> 01:42:17,814
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1386
01:42:17,897 --> 01:42:21,108
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours,

1387
01:42:21,192 --> 01:42:24,820
and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1388
01:42:24,903 --> 01:42:26,989
What ho! Apothecary!

1389
01:42:30,492 --> 01:42:34,120
Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.

1390
01:42:34,203 --> 01:42:37,123
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

1391
01:42:37,206 --> 01:42:40,959
- Let me have a dram of poison-
- Such mortal drugs I have,

1392
01:42:41,043 --> 01:42:45,088
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

1393
01:42:45,171 --> 01:42:48,674
- Art thou so-
- My poverty, but not my will, consents.

1394
01:42:54,513 --> 01:42:57,432
I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.

1395
01:43:01,436 --> 01:43:03,604
Eyes, look your last.

1396
01:43:03,688 --> 01:43:06,440
Arms, take your last embrace.

1397
01:43:06,524 --> 01:43:08,859
And, lips,

1398
01:43:08,942 --> 01:43:12,404
oh, you,
the doors of breath,

1399
01:43:12,487 --> 01:43:14,906
seal with
a righteous kiss...

1400
01:43:16,866 --> 01:43:19,118
the dateless bargain...

1401
01:43:19,202 --> 01:43:21,454
to engrossing death.

1402
01:43:22,746 --> 01:43:25,582
Come, bitter conduct.

1403
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:28,960
Come, unsavory guide.

1404
01:43:29,044 --> 01:43:32,755
Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...

1405
01:43:32,839 --> 01:43:37,635
run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.

1406
01:43:37,718 --> 01:43:40,137
Here's to my love!

1407
01:43:48,061 --> 01:43:51,230
Oh... true apothecary!

1408
01:43:55,234 --> 01:43:57,486
Thy drugs are quick.

1409
01:44:02,282 --> 01:44:04,867
Thus with a kiss...

1410
01:44:07,578 --> 01:44:09,663
I die.

1411
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:29,472
Where is my lord?

1412
01:44:31,224 --> 01:44:35,353
I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?

1413
01:44:35,436 --> 01:44:36,729
Dead!

1414
01:44:50,116 --> 01:44:52,159
What's this?

1415
01:44:52,243 --> 01:44:55,954
A cup, closed
in my true love's hand?

1416
01:44:57,538 --> 01:45:01,334
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

1417
01:45:07,006 --> 01:45:09,550
Oh, happy dagger,

1418
01:45:09,633 --> 01:45:11,593
this is thy sheath.

1419
01:45:14,554 --> 01:45:16,889
There rest...

1420
01:45:18,349 --> 01:45:20,601
and let me die.

1421
01:45:27,482 --> 01:45:31,069
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings;

1422
01:45:31,152 --> 01:45:35,573
the sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1423
01:45:35,656 --> 01:45:40,661
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1424
01:45:40,744 --> 01:45:42,996
Some shall be pardoned,

1425
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:46,082
and some punished;

1426
01:45:46,165 --> 01:45:50,294
for never was a story
of more woe...

1427
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:54,006
than this of Juliet...

1428
01:45:54,089 --> 01:45:56,341
and her Romeo.

1429
01:46:23,449 --> 01:46:26,326
Bravo!

1430
01:46:30,038 --> 01:46:32,039
- Yea! Yea!
- Yea!

1431
01:47:18,414 --> 01:47:21,125
- Bravo!
- Yea! Bravo!

1432
01:47:35,596 --> 01:47:37,356
God save the queen!

1433
01:47:37,556 --> 01:47:40,016
I arrest you
in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1434
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:44,103
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1435
01:47:44,187 --> 01:47:45,938
Everyone!

1436
01:47:46,022 --> 01:47:49,358
Admiral's Men,
the Chamberlain's Men...

1437
01:47:49,442 --> 01:47:53,779
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1438
01:47:53,862 --> 01:47:57,240
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1439
01:47:57,324 --> 01:48:01,369
Contempt? You closed the Rose.
I have not opened it.

1440
01:48:01,452 --> 01:48:03,954
That woman is a woman!

1441
01:48:04,038 --> 01:48:06,123
What?

1442
01:48:06,206 --> 01:48:09,418
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1443
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:14,922
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1444
01:48:15,006 --> 01:48:18,342
Mr. Tilney!

1445
01:48:23,555 --> 01:48:27,308
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1446
01:48:35,232 --> 01:48:37,943
The queen of England
does not attend...

1447
01:48:38,026 --> 01:48:40,070
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1448
01:48:40,153 --> 01:48:43,156
So something
is out of joint.

1449
01:48:45,074 --> 01:48:48,744
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1450
01:49:03,549 --> 01:49:06,468
Yes, the illusion
is remarkable.

1451
01:49:06,552 --> 01:49:09,262
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1452
01:49:10,597 --> 01:49:14,600
But I know something of
a woman in a man's profession.

1453
01:49:14,684 --> 01:49:17,645
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1454
01:49:19,396 --> 01:49:22,316
That is enough from you,
Master Kent.

1455
01:49:27,153 --> 01:49:29,405
If only Lord Wessex
were here.

1456
01:49:29,489 --> 01:49:31,532
He is, ma'am.

1457
01:49:34,451 --> 01:49:37,663
Y- Your Majesty.

1458
01:49:38,914 --> 01:49:41,916
There was a wager
I remember...

1459
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,837
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1460
01:49:46,921 --> 01:49:49,506
I think you lost it today.

1461
01:49:54,177 --> 01:49:58,097
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1462
01:49:58,181 --> 01:50:01,100
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1463
01:50:07,773 --> 01:50:10,191
Master Shakespeare.

1464
01:50:12,777 --> 01:50:15,780
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself,

1465
01:50:15,863 --> 01:50:18,991
and we will speak
some more.

1466
01:50:36,465 --> 01:50:38,717
Your Majesty.

1467
01:50:40,135 --> 01:50:42,095
Why, Lord Wessex.

1468
01:50:42,178 --> 01:50:44,722
Lost your wife so soon?

1469
01:50:44,806 --> 01:50:47,558
Indeed I am a bride short,

1470
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:51,937
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1471
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,606
How is this to end?

1472
01:50:54,689 --> 01:50:57,442
As stories must
when love's denied-

1473
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:00,153
with tears and a journey.

1474
01:51:00,194 --> 01:51:02,655
Those whom God
has joined in marriage...

1475
01:51:02,738 --> 01:51:06,200
not even I
can put asunder.

1476
01:51:06,283 --> 01:51:08,994
Master Kent.

1477
01:51:14,707 --> 01:51:18,711
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1478
01:51:20,671 --> 01:51:24,466
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1479
01:51:24,549 --> 01:51:26,968
It's time
to settle accounts.

1480
01:51:30,179 --> 01:51:33,182
- How much was that wager?
- Fifty shillings.

1481
01:51:34,516 --> 01:51:37,060
Pounds.

1482
01:51:37,144 --> 01:51:41,606
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1483
01:51:49,196 --> 01:51:53,158
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1484
01:51:53,241 --> 01:51:56,077
for Twelfth Night.

1485
01:52:12,008 --> 01:52:16,679
Too late.

1486
01:52:25,437 --> 01:52:27,480
My Lady Wessex.

1487
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:45,705
A hired player
no longer.

1488
01:52:45,788 --> 01:52:48,415
Fifty pounds, Will,

1489
01:52:48,499 --> 01:52:51,001
for the poet of true love.

1490
01:52:52,127 --> 01:52:54,045
I'm done with theater.

1491
01:52:55,839 --> 01:52:58,382
The playhouse
is for dreamers.

1492
01:52:58,466 --> 01:53:00,968
Look what the dream
brought us.

1493
01:53:02,094 --> 01:53:04,721
It was we ourselves
did that.

1494
01:53:06,098 --> 01:53:10,351
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1495
01:53:10,435 --> 01:53:14,605
I have hurt you,
and I'm sorry for it.

1496
01:53:14,689 --> 01:53:18,734
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more,

1497
01:53:18,817 --> 01:53:21,236
then I shall be
the sorrier.

1498
01:53:26,783 --> 01:53:29,368
The queen commands
a comedy, Will,

1499
01:53:29,452 --> 01:53:31,412
for Twelfth Night.

1500
01:53:31,495 --> 01:53:34,581
A comedy.

1501
01:53:34,665 --> 01:53:36,666
What would my hero be?

1502
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:40,211
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1503
01:53:42,422 --> 01:53:45,925
It's a beginning.

1504
01:53:46,008 --> 01:53:50,095
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine-

1505
01:53:50,178 --> 01:53:53,515
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1506
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:59,562
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1507
01:53:59,645 --> 01:54:02,523
A storm.
All are lost.

1508
01:54:02,606 --> 01:54:06,068
She lands... on a...

1509
01:54:06,151 --> 01:54:09,154
vast and empty shore.

1510
01:54:10,613 --> 01:54:12,657
She's brought to the duke-

1511
01:54:14,075 --> 01:54:17,119
- Orsino.
- Orsino?

1512
01:54:18,245 --> 01:54:20,163
Good name.

1513
01:54:20,247 --> 01:54:24,584
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1514
01:54:24,667 --> 01:54:28,546
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1515
01:54:30,756 --> 01:54:32,966
But all ends well.

1516
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:35,260
How does it?

1517
01:54:36,344 --> 01:54:37,870
I don't know.

1518
01:54:39,055 --> 01:54:41,849
It's a mystery.

1519
01:54:48,063 --> 01:54:50,732
You will never age for me,

1520
01:54:50,816 --> 01:54:52,734
nor fade,

1521
01:54:52,817 --> 01:54:55,069
nor die.

1522
01:54:55,153 --> 01:54:57,655
Nor you for me.

1523
01:54:58,990 --> 01:55:01,283
Good-bye, my love.

1524
01:55:03,035 --> 01:55:05,412
A thousand times good-bye.

1525
01:55:09,916 --> 01:55:11,834
Write me well.

1526
01:55:44,572 --> 01:55:48,200
My story starts at sea,

1527
01:55:48,283 --> 01:55:51,536
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1528
01:55:52,912 --> 01:55:55,999
A shipwreck.

1529
01:55:57,875 --> 01:56:01,670
The wild waters roar and heave.

1530
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,133
The brave vessel
is dashed all to pieces,

1531
01:56:08,885 --> 01:56:12,763
and all the helpless souls
within her...

1532
01:56:12,847 --> 01:56:15,141
drowned.

1533
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:21,104
All save one:

1534
01:56:21,188 --> 01:56:23,356
a lady...

1535
01:56:24,732 --> 01:56:28,986
whose soul is greater
than the ocean,

1536
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:33,323
and her spirit,
stronger than the sea's embrace.

1537
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:38,787
Not for her a watery end,

1538
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:44,417
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1539
01:56:48,545 --> 01:56:51,089
It will be a love story,

1540
01:56:55,218 --> 01:56:59,388
for she will be my heroine
for all time.

1541
01:57:02,224 --> 01:57:05,769
And her name will be Viola.
