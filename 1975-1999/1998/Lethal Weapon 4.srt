1
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:33,008
Riggs, you sure we're on
the right street?

2
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:34,808
We must be getting warm.

3
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:38,446
- You see anything?
- Where? I don't see anything.

4
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:39,927
This must be the place.

5
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,401
Holy shit!

6
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,132
What the hell is that?

7
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,083
Jesus!

8
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:50,802
Who's this joker?

9
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:52,810
I don't know.
A spokesman for the NRA.

10
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:54,842
Regular asshole.

11
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:56,202
What do we do now?

12
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:58,083
Run him over.

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,685
What if he shoots us with that rifle?

14
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:03,766
- He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't.
- What if he does?

15
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,886
Don't be a Don't-Bee.
Be a Do-Bee. Be positive.

16
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:07,969
Positive?

17
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,368
- Run him over.
- Glad you see things my way.

18
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,807
I hope he doesn't turn.

19
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,051
He won't. We'll creep up on him
so he won't notice.

20
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,803
Will him not to turn.
Power of positive thinking.

21
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:22,605
Don't turn.
Will him with me.

22
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,528
Don't turn around.

23
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,883
I need you.
Don't turn around!

24
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:28,769
Just believe!

25
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:29,883
Don't turn around!

26
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,044
We're better than him.

27
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,248
We're better!

28
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:36,082
He's turning.

29
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,331
They just bounce off him!

30
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:51,926
I saw! We're in trouble!

31
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,089
Shit! I'll draw his fire.
You run for cover.

32
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,801
No, I'll draw his fire.
You run for cover.

33
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:02,488
Are you crazy?! You got
a wife, kids. I got less to lose!

34
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:08,488
Get out of here!

35
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:15,205
I'm not supposed to tell you,
but Lorna's pregnant.

36
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:18,927
What'd you say?

37
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,528
You'll be a father!

38
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:29,243
She was afraid to tell you.
She was afraid you'd get angry.

39
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,046
You never talked about children?

40
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:32,966
- Shit!
- A baby.

41
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,206
There's something I'm not
supposed to tell you too.

42
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:47,724
Rianne's pregnant. You're going
to be a grandfather.

43
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:48,962
Rianne's what?!

44
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:56,728
Rianne can't be pregnant.

45
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,811
She's not married.

46
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,442
I don't think she intended
to get that way.

47
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,288
They asking me to be a granddaddy?

48
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:45,049
Here's what we'll do.
Take your clothes off!

49
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:46,203
What for?

50
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:48,408
Okay, you run.

51
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,723
Flame-O sees you in your undies.

52
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:52,850
It distracts him,
then I shoot.

53
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:55,203
- Shoot what?
- The valve on that napalm tank!

54
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:56,892
Before he shoots me?

55
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,646
- Maybe.
- Maybe?!

56
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:09,563
Is he black?

57
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:11,724
Too much armor on.
I can't tell!

58
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:14,806
No! Not him!
The father of the baby!

59
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:18,045
Please let him be black!

60
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,812
Get going! Here he comes!

61
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,088
Are those hearts?

62
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,523
Not now, Riggs.
Just hit the damn valve!

63
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:33,048
Also, flap and make noises
like a bird.

64
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,971
Flap my arms? Why?

65
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:37,363
Lt'll distract him more.
I need him to turn.

66
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:40,891
- On 2!
- We always go on 3.

67
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,566
No time for 3. 2!

68
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:44,883
- What about 1?
- Okay. 1, 2, go!

69
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,930
I don't want to die in my underwear!

70
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:50,883
Why are you waiting?
Shoot the bastard!

71
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:29,082
Riggs, you think
that bird thing helped?

72
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,092
I just wanted to see if you'd do it.

73
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,006
Cute shorts.

74
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,007
Go spit!

75
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:42,932
I'll buy you a doughnut.

76
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,369
Don't hug me when I'm naked.

77
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,604
You're ashamed of your butt?

78
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,612
He's a lively one.

79
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,293
That shark hurts my boat,
I take it out on you, Leo.

80
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:06,127
- I didn't mean to catch it.
- Why do you want to keep it?

81
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,125
Yeah, why keep a shark?

82
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,051
The teeth'll look great on a wall.

83
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:11,612
They got to stop snapping first.

84
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,372
Maybe he'll fall asleep.

85
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:15,444
Converse with him.
He'll nod off.

86
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:18,765
- He don't look tired.
- Chewing on Leo will wear him out.

87
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:21,203
Sharks eat their own kind?

88
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:24,811
Stop it!
I'm in stitches!

89
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,252
Okay, where's my bag?

90
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,648
Starboard side aft.

91
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,806
Starboard, that's left, right?

92
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:34,806
No, port's left.
Starboard's right.

93
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,531
Right, yeah. Right side aft.
Got it!

94
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,809
- Whatever.
- Check both sides.

95
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,044
Careful!
He's behind you, shark!

96
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:47,486
Maybe we should throw him overboard.

97
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:49,650
Throw them both overboard.

98
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,925
No witnesses.
We'd probably get away with it.

99
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:57,967
You too?

100
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,648
I kept my nose out of it...

101
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,010
...but you and Lorna.

102
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:11,803
You're having a baby,
you're living together.

103
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,161
You're not marrying.

104
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:18,406
Why, does that violate your
family values system?

105
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,686
I'm just trying to understand.

106
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,245
Rianne's not married either.

107
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,643
That's hitting below the belt.

108
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,803
You know, when I was married...

109
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,244
...it was good. You know.

110
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:39,007
You put the ring on.
You make the commitment.

111
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,605
You do all the...

112
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:45,446
She's dead because I'm a cop.

113
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,922
She's dead because I'm a cop
and I...

114
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:51,408
I don't wear the ring anymore...

115
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:54,209
...but I look, and it's still there.

116
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,011
I still feel it.

117
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:00,969
It's like I'm not
finished with that yet.

118
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,363
I can't explain it.
Is that bullshit?

119
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,804
No. It's not finished.

120
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,411
It's not finished.

121
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,688
Okay, you did say "aft"?

122
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,525
A-F-T. Aft!

123
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,127
That's a fucking word?

124
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,769
In the back on the right side, Leo!

125
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:24,092
Why didn't you say that
to begin with, Roger?!

126
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:28,692
People get around boats and water,
everything becomes nautical!

127
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,203
"Astern! Avast, you landlubbers!

128
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,485
Man the bilge pump!"

129
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:35,451
Pump your fucking ass!

130
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:36,808
All right, all right!

131
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,444
No problem, no problem!

132
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:46,331
What's Lorna say about it?

133
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,370
She doesn't like nautical terms either.

134
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:52,651
We haven't discussed it.
That's pretty messed up.

135
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:56,522
The baby's due in days and you
haven't talked about marrying?

136
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:57,882
No.

137
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:00,209
I haven't done it at all.

138
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,051
Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?

139
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,487
I want Leo to shoot...

140
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:06,529
No, Leo!

141
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,008
What?!

142
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:12,332
- What's the deal?!
- You're shooting a gun on my boat!

143
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,569
I'm not shooting your boat,
I'm shooting Jaws.

144
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:18,482
Nobody's killing it
just to have its teeth!

145
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:21,810
You're grumpy since you
learned you'll be a grandpa.

146
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,412
Get off of me, will you?

147
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:25,086
Don't fool around!

148
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,643
Some piece of hardware!
Got a permit?

149
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,809
Of course!
I'm a P.I. Now.

150
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:34,210
A gumshoe! You get in
ugly situations. I got guns!

151
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:36,251
You are an ugly situation.

152
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:39,445
You don't deserve this.
You're not safe.

153
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,887
Smart move, Riggs.

154
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:43,689
Shit!

155
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:47,089
Hard right!

156
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,327
You hear shots?

157
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,564
Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7.</i>

158
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,688
We're in L.A. Harbor.

159
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:04,407
We got an 07.

160
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,086
They're getting away!

161
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,210
Who was it? Do we know?

162
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:14,289
No, no, I'll drive!

163
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,641
- Want me to help?
- Get out of here!

164
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,088
This your gun?

165
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,846
Yeah, want laser surgery?

166
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,885
You could blind somebody!

167
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,766
Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7,</i>
<i>in pursuit of freighter.</i>

168
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,122
Heading north.

169
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,091
Awaiting instructions. Over.

170
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:36,921
<i>Code 7,</i>
<i>maintain your present course.</i>

171
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:38,851
<i>We have a cutter en route.</i>

172
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,767
Why you slowing down?

173
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:43,971
We'll hang here.
Coast Guard'll be here soon.

174
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:46,443
- What do we do now?
- Show them our badges.

175
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,768
LAPD!

176
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,009
LAPD!

177
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,965
Los Angeles Police Department!

178
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,089
We heard gunfire!
The Coast Guard's on the...

179
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,173
Coast Guard!
Freighter's on fire!

180
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:24,842
- Let's board them.
- What are you talking about?!

181
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:27,004
Fire on the freighter!

182
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:34,651
Okay, I'm upside.
Now what do you do?

183
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,725
They're getting away.
Get me up there!

184
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,892
Hell of a fishing trip!

185
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:47,085
Shut up and keep your head down!

186
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,322
LAPD!

187
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,286
Stop where you are!
Hold it right there!

188
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,043
He's got it! He's got it!

189
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,327
What'd he say?

190
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:01,722
Watch his back!

191
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:05,971
You didn't say you'd shoot!

192
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:09,211
Tie it up!

193
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,002
Pull it up!

194
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:20,082
Great!

195
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,849
I said keep the boat closer!

196
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,886
Why listen to Leo?

197
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,882
Shit!

198
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,926
You all right, Riggs?!

199
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:50,602
Look!

200
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,247
Shit!

201
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,045
Jump! Jump!

202
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,412
Where are you?

203
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:06,487
My boat! My new boat!

204
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:26,091
- The shark.
- What about the shark?

205
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:27,607
Shark!

206
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:31,925
Don't leave me!

207
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,042
Come on!

208
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,325
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

209
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,522
You'll make it!

210
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:27,731
This is all I got left.

211
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:57,047
Four sets of papers, totally genuine.

212
00:14:57,373 --> 00:15:00,092
They'll get in the country
and can stay forever.

213
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,051
U.S. Citizens.

214
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,204
Ask them to vote the incumbent party.

215
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:07,967
Help me keep my State Department job.

216
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:09,481
Bloody marvelous!

217
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:13,368
They red-flag Asian visas.
Those were hard to slip through.

218
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,171
The ship's been impounded.

219
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:19,282
What about the family?

220
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,489
We don't know yet.

221
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:25,248
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

222
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:28,972
Something wrong?

223
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,852
A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody.

224
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:40,524
Goodbye.

225
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,609
Leave!

226
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,561
I'll find them.

227
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:51,162
Now.

228
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:55,641
Coast Guard interdicts
about one a month.

229
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,082
Pretty raggedy-looking.

230
00:16:57,413 --> 00:16:59,881
Six weeks locked in a hole
with one toilet.

231
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:03,443
Rice and some fish to eat.
Lousy deal for 35 grand a head.

232
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,969
Where'd they get that kind of money?

233
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:10,172
Didn't. Got to work it off from
the snakeheads, the smugglers.

234
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:12,923
- They sell them as cheap labor.
- Sell them?

235
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:13,929
Like slaves.

236
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:18,444
These must be the lucky ones.

237
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:22,521
They'll claim asylum. Say they were
persecuted, like everybody else.

238
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:26,249
We'll send them packing.
Cost you and me a fortune.

239
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,808
What happened to,
"Bring me your tired, your poor...

240
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:31,442
...your wretched masses,
yearning to be free"?

241
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:33,725
Now it reads, "No vacancies."

242
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,411
I guess your parents
were Native Americans.

243
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:43,849
They pop one every boatload.

244
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,046
Shows the rest what'll happen
if they run off.

245
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:50,852
He's nobody's slave now.

246
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,206
Don't coddle them, move them!

247
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,763
I see this barrel coming down.

248
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:59,328
Murtaugh didn't see it,
so I push him.

249
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:02,253
I knock him over.
We're in the water.

250
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,047
I pull because he can't swim.
I got to save him.

251
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:08,844
There's that kid.
What's his name? Bissel?

252
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,363
- It's a food.
- Burger!

253
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:13,092
No, Biscuits or something.

254
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:16,007
He always kisses my ass,
gives me coffee and shit.

255
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:19,370
Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh.
What are you doing here?

256
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:22,212
- That's a long story.
- You're all wet!

257
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:24,086
- You need a blanket?
- I'm fine.

258
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:27,889
- Somebody get this man a blanket now!
- Yes, sir!

259
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:31,725
- Get this body out of here.
- What do we got here?

260
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:33,765
Step back, step back.

261
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:36,692
Shit!

262
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:39,123
He's dead.
He's fucking dead!

263
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,642
- Shit!
- What?

264
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,367
This is how he wanted
to come to America?

265
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,211
Was he in the killing section?

266
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,444
This guy's been shot four times!

267
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,001
At close range, like he was executed!

268
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,362
He was executed.

269
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:53,369
By the crew.

270
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:59,128
People get killed left, right
and center in this town!

271
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,011
Now we import victims?

272
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,490
Gangbangers kill each other,
no problem!

273
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:07,082
One of us gets shot,
occupational hazard!

274
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:11,486
But just a normal guy?
What did he ever do to anybody?!

275
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,445
- That ain't right.
- Easy, Biscuits.

276
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,729
You'll get an ulcer.
Settle down.

277
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:16,883
Blanket!

278
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:19,687
Sorry, Blankets.

279
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,171
Sorry, I'm losing my head.

280
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:25,326
I hate to see bad things
happen to good folk.

281
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:29,572
We'd stick around, Butler,
but you're in charge so...

282
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,691
You should take this, it's free.
You're all wet.

283
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:37,052
- Get some vapor rub on your chest.
- All right, Boogers.

284
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,565
Hey, get them out of here!

285
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:41,852
Get them out of here!

286
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:45,253
He takes the job kind of personally.

287
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:48,889
Yeah, he's pretty serious, I'd say.
Overzealous.

288
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:50,492
Jealous of who?

289
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:53,412
- I don't know. Who?
- You said he was jealous.

290
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:54,841
You just said...

291
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,203
I said he was zealous.
Full of zeal.

292
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,165
He's loud too.

293
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,971
- He's loud!
- What?

294
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:03,210
We better get up
before the sun's up.

295
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:04,812
I got something in the lifeboat.

296
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,812
That's okay,
I'll catch a squad ride.

297
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,325
I'm sorry about your boat.

298
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,609
- I'm sorry.
- Shit!

299
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:21,488
Suddenly, a big fucking shark comes...
Can I say that?

300
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,923
You can say it, but we can't air it.

301
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:26,812
So this big darn shark comes along...

302
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:40,091
My <i>Code 7.</i>

303
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,201
- You were coming home last night.
- I'm sorry.

304
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:29,087
I had some bad Chinese.

305
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,405
You look a little banged up.

306
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,769
You look a little knocked up.

307
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:38,452
Are you okay?

308
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:39,881
You sure?

309
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:42,609
Easy, tiger!
There he goes again.

310
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:44,445
There she goes again.

311
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:46,689
You okay?

312
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,527
I'm better than Roger.
His boat sank.

313
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:52,810
- Boat sank?
- I had something to do with it.

314
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,372
No! No grease!

315
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,602
- Have some cookies.
- What happened?

316
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:01,282
Gunfights, explosions, sharks.
The usual.

317
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:02,609
Here, boy.

318
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,322
Thanks.

319
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:09,492
You were fishing.
Does trouble go looking for you?

320
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:13,646
It seems to know pretty much
where I am most of the time.

321
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,290
You finished the nursery.

322
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:17,608
Yeah, I did.

323
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:20,566
It's good for a girl or boy.
Cute, huh?

324
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,207
It's a dogfest!
Did you get the whole 101?

325
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:26,206
I know. I got a little
carried away with puppies.

326
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,251
Kid'll probably hate dogs.

327
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:36,250
You know, Lorna, we never
ever talked about marriage.

328
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,763
I figured you didn't want that.

329
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,045
You want to get married?

330
00:22:57,813 --> 00:22:59,087
Well, no.

331
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:02,727
Me neither.

332
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:05,168
Breakfast?

333
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:23,248
<i>Serve and Protect.</i>

334
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,246
Since when do you read this smut?

335
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:31,083
It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.
Trish gave it to me.

336
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:34,251
"Every fiber in his being
desired her.

337
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,370
He devoured her with his eyes."

338
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:40,650
Can we try this thing
on page 196 sometime?

339
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,801
There's a good one on 168.
Maybe later.

340
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:49,170
Nothing comes between
a pregnant lady and a meal.

341
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:54,012
Have I ever
"made your womanhood reach peaks...

342
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:56,204
...to rival the Himalayas"?

343
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:59,883
- Foothills of Malibu, maybe.
- Not even a Teton?

344
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,486
- I don't think so.
- Thanks.

345
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,162
I thought I'd at least
rate the Rockies.

346
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,051
You know I'm kidding.

347
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,170
- You say that to make me feel better.
- No, I don't.

348
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,288
You know I'm playing.

349
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:15,041
I've been to plenty of
mountaintops with you.

350
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,369
It's just that I'm hungry.

351
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:21,608
When you have that kid,
we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.

352
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:24,128
- I brought you a doughnut.
- Police food!

353
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:25,522
How did you know?

354
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,803
I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.

355
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:31,287
How's the rat squad?

356
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,252
- I picked up something good.
- Some cheese?

357
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:37,048
I.A. Got an anonymous tip.

358
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,443
The person said Roger's on the take.

359
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:41,771
No, he's not.

360
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:45,125
I know! It's probably
some jerk he put away.

361
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:48,411
But with new boats
and putting 2 kids through college...

362
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,450
...I thought you ought to know.

363
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,451
I actually tried to
persuade him to take money.

364
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:56,845
Stop it, Riggs!
I can't hear that! Nothing!

365
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:59,243
I won't say anything anymore.
I'm kidding.

366
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:01,165
- That's awful.
- I'm kidding.

367
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:03,963
Don't tell him I said it.
With his problems...

368
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:07,524
...he'll blow his top.
Just don't say anything.

369
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:10,646
What do you mean?

370
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,322
Like what?

371
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:16,928
- In general, problems.
- You mean something specific.

372
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:19,084
I got a nose for these things. What?

373
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:23,604
You're pushing me.
I don't want you to go there.

374
00:25:23,853 --> 00:25:26,890
Get it off your chest.
You'll feel better.

375
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,408
I won't leave you alone
till you tell me.

376
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,642
Tell me.

377
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:34,369
I'll tell you!
Pregnancy destroyed my brain cells!

378
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,891
What? What?

379
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:38,766
I'm drooling. What?

380
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:44,407
Promise me you'll never
say a word about this ever.

381
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:46,245
- I swear, I swear.
- Right hand!

382
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:47,886
I swear I won't, ever.

383
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,526
I promise. What?

384
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,372
You know how Roger is
about his daughter dating cops.

385
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:54,932
He'd kill them. So?

386
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:59,252
Rianne married one, her baby's father.
She's afraid to tell Roger.

387
00:25:59,573 --> 00:26:02,770
They met, fell in love.
She got pregnant, they got hitched.

388
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:04,845
Nobody's telling Roger?

389
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,327
After the baby's born.

390
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:09,685
It's a package deal?
Take it or leave it?

391
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:12,051
- Does Trish know?
- She knows.

392
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:14,803
She doesn't know you know.
But Trish knows.

393
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,487
Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead
son-in-law?

394
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:20,643
- Who?
- Sergeant Lee Butters.

395
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,925
This just gets better!
No wonder he sucks up to Rog.

396
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:25,965
Brings him apples,
blankets, coffee...

397
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:28,852
Not a word.
I'm telling you, nothing!

398
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:33,007
I won't tell. He'd shoot me
just for being the messenger.

399
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:37,486
He's my best friend. It'd be wrong
to mess with him. I won't.

400
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:41,001
Promise.

401
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:47,445
We don't have to discuss boys' names.
We're having a girl.

402
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,445
Okay. Piadora.

403
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,167
I like Piadora. That's sweet.

404
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:56,651
I love that name.

405
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:02,443
We're talking kids' names.
Has Rianne picked any out?

406
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,928
We don't want to double up.

407
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:07,443
Oscar for the boy,
Loreen if it's a girl.

408
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,452
I like Lee Butter.
Better! I like it better.

409
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:12,809
- Don't get me started.
- I like those names.

410
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,646
Captain wants to see us.

411
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,527
Trish'll be right down.
Have fun shopping for the baby.

412
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:18,848
Bye-bye, honey.

413
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:21,204
Who had the sleepover?

414
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:22,721
Just airing out camping gear.

415
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:24,645
- We're out of here.
- Something smells good.

416
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,048
Really good!

417
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,688
Trish has food on the stove.
We're out of here.

418
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:30,811
That smells like Chinese food.

419
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,811
Chinese food?

420
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:34,805
She's into Chinese cooking.

421
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,124
I got to taste this.

422
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:40,009
- I love Chinese food.
- Hold it! Please!

423
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:41,408
Please!

424
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:44,211
There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.

425
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:45,403
I saw him.

426
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:48,244
A couple of Chinese people.

427
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:50,251
Actually a whole family.

428
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:53,528
Large family.

429
00:27:57,253 --> 00:27:58,368
Hey, guys!

430
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:05,129
- It does smell good.
- Great!

431
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:07,170
They hid in the lifeboat.

432
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,569
I had to do something.

433
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:12,805
- So you brought them home.
- It took two trips.

434
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:15,482
- Really?
- They fit in the station wagon?

435
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:17,764
That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.

436
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:20,123
He's head of the family.
Speaks English.

437
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:23,809
Hong, this is my partner,
Martin Riggs, and Lorna.

438
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:25,329
Wife?

439
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:29,527
Can we speak?

440
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:32,043
Lorna, this is the best breakfast.

441
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,931
I'm hungry. I'd love some.

442
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:38,608
This is illegal.
As in, "against the law."

443
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:40,485
You'll bring a shitstorm
down on you.

444
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,413
Just hold on!
Just wait a frigging minute!

445
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:47,449
The way I see it,
those are slave ships out there.

446
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,610
And I'm freeing slaves...

447
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:53,329
...like no one did for my ancestors.

448
00:28:56,173 --> 00:28:58,892
It's my chance to do something
and do it right.

449
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,333
Why didn't you say so?
This won't be boring.

450
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:06,092
Need any help?

451
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:09,047
Where is he?

452
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,051
What this time,
food or money?

453
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:15,521
- Food and money.
- Money.

454
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,531
I see you more
than when you lived here.

455
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:19,610
We're independent now.

456
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:20,808
What's the money for?

457
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,651
- Hookers, drugs...
- Contraceptives.

458
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:25,488
Can you believe how
they talk to me?

459
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:28,731
It costs more to go to school now.

460
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:33,607
I get the tuition bills.
And the grades too!

461
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:36,526
This is a down payment
on a future ass-chewing.

462
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:39,088
Get out and go to school.

463
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,204
I see the tuition.

464
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:44,849
I want to see some grades!
I want more cluck for my buck.

465
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:46,492
Thanks for the money.

466
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,209
I'm tired.

467
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:52,131
Me, I can't win.

468
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:53,402
Boy!

469
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:57,372
Did we get a raise
and nobody told me?

470
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:01,611
I got to get to the bank.

471
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,448
How can you when you're taken
to the cleaners all the time?

472
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,009
Hey, guys.

473
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:09,688
Hey, Trish!

474
00:30:11,013 --> 00:30:13,686
- Both the kids leave?
- Yes. And we're broke.

475
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:14,922
Is Lorna here?

476
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,807
She's in the kitchen,
on her third breakfast.

477
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:19,850
I remember those days.

478
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,488
- I'm sorry!
- I love it when you do that.

479
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:26,651
You look terrific.

480
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:29,402
Wait till she tries raising
that baby by herself.

481
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:30,728
I'll be fine.

482
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,490
Move back in and Grandpa'll
be up nights with the baby.

483
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:36,764
Better than her
marrying the wrong guy.

484
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:40,492
A cop or something.

485
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:42,242
True.

486
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:44,085
Come on, guys.
See you.

487
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,091
I should say goodbye.

488
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:47,648
Hurry up!

489
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:49,686
Stuffing your face!

490
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,328
Stop kissing me.
Try that.

491
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:54,165
Stay away from my girl.

492
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,008
I'm not joking.
Stay away from my girl.

493
00:30:57,293 --> 00:31:00,444
- Joking!
- Got the baby beeper?

494
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:08,004
- I know.
- It's your fault.

495
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:10,608
It's your fault.
All the chicken shit.

496
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,764
Flapping all over the place.

497
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,002
All right, everybody!

498
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,087
It's been a year almost.
This shit ain't funny no more!

499
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:24,367
- Enough is enough!
- Please! Enough!

500
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:26,644
I'm the one that gets it in the neck.

501
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:28,326
Can we exercise maturity?

502
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:30,968
If I find who's doing this,
I'll kick his ass.

503
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:36,368
I catch that asshole who
put my picture up, that's it!

504
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:39,643
- Cut their balls off.
- Captain.

505
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:44,092
I look out expecting
to see all the old faces.

506
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,530
Instead, I see kids
whose names I barely remember.

507
00:31:47,853 --> 00:31:51,687
Will you sit down?
We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.

508
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:52,962
Speak for yourself.

509
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,044
We're making way for the new police:

510
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:59,724
Guys with guns and psychology degrees,
like Butters out there.

511
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,010
Biter has a psychology degree?

512
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:09,842
- More like a psycho degree.
- Times have got to change.

513
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:12,772
I once got shot by a hot-rodder
with a zip gun.

514
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:14,571
That's how far back I go.

515
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:17,606
You wanted to see us?

516
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,406
Some things don't change.

517
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:22,372
- Here we go.
- The department lost its insurance.

518
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:25,326
All the damage you've done,
they can't get a new one...

519
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,928
...while you two still run around.

520
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:31,403
They can't fire you either.

521
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:34,372
So, they're promoting you.

522
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,490
- Lieutenant!
- There's no open lieutenant spots.

523
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:43,402
So the chief used his special privilege,
making you captains.

524
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:46,450
- Better.
- Captain!

525
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:50,481
Time was when this would send me over
the falls. I'm getting old.

526
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:52,967
What do we do now?

527
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:54,687
Captain shit!

528
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:57,129
- Hang out.
- Take long lunches.

529
00:32:57,413 --> 00:33:00,485
Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh,
I'm the captain."

530
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,212
"Chief's shitting bricks!"

531
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:03,249
You finished?

532
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:06,612
Can you stay out of trouble?

533
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:08,081
Absolutely.

534
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:10,728
- Captain Riggs!
- Captain Murtaugh!

535
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:22,210
You want your badges?
Let me see those sergeant badges.

536
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,563
Throw them over here.

537
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:29,008
This is the most painful
experience of my life.

538
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:31,802
- Now get out!
- Thank you, Captain.

539
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,129
Thank you, Captain.

540
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,281
Enough with the "Captain" shit!
Get out of here!

541
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:41,282
After you, Captain, I insist!
"O Captain! My Captain!"

542
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:43,848
- Captains outrageous!
- News travels fast.

543
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:47,125
Get a break from real police work.
Play golf, tennis...

544
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:50,291
<i>They got brown rings</i>
<i>Around their noses</i>

545
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,133
Now that you're captains,
come up in the chopper.

546
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:56,005
- Not for me.
- I'll take a rain check.

547
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:59,444
- Lf you change your mind, call us.
- He's down-to-earth.

548
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:02,447
I'm sorry.

549
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:08,923
Can we knock this off?
This is your captain speaking.

550
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:14,047
The man's got feelings, you know?

551
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:22,731
Congratulations.
Look at you!

552
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,571
Captain Murtaugh.

553
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:28,732
I don't know how to say this,
but you really inspire me.

554
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,727
Keep it up.

555
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,202
How's it going, Burton?

556
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:36,007
- It's Butters, Captain.
- I'll remember that.

557
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:38,887
- Kid really likes you.
- I wish he'd cut it out.

558
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,612
He likes me?

559
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:43,887
Likes me?

560
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,245
You don't think he likes me...

561
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,648
...likes me like that?

562
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:59,485
It's the police,
not the military.

563
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:01,724
The millennium's upon us.

564
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:05,449
The captain said:
"New people, new department."

565
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,246
Dr. Woods?

566
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:17,408
Captain Riggs.

567
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:19,285
- Don't run.
- I'm in a rush.

568
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:22,764
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it this time?

569
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:25,208
Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?

570
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:28,889
- Or did you cook up something new?
- I'm sorry about all that.

571
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,164
I want your advice.
I was thinking of...

572
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:33,484
- Thinking?
- Marriage.

573
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:36,882
Marriage?! The "M" word?

574
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,647
Does "confidentiality" mean anything?

575
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:41,087
That's funny.

576
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,972
You know what'd happen?
We'd go in my office...

577
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:46,284
...and you know what you'd tell me?

578
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:49,406
You'd tell me something like, "Doc...

579
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,689
...I want to marry Murtaugh."

580
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:54,407
Or your mother.
Or Nelson Mandela!

581
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:55,808
Nelson Mandela?!

582
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,488
Something to ridicule me, Riggs.

583
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:01,167
Something to get a rise out of me.

584
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:02,808
Listen carefully!

585
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:05,243
I'm... not... stupid!

586
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,124
And my time is reserved...

587
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:12,247
...for police officers with
real needs and real problems.

588
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:13,892
Have you got that?!

589
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:16,446
- Have you?!
- Ask me again?

590
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:18,445
No. And you know what?

591
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,361
I don't like you.

592
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:25,687
Stephanie?

593
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,166
I can't go out with you.
I'm in a relationship.

594
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,609
I think you need to see someone.

595
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:34,083
You'll find someone to love you.

596
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,052
Not in this department.
But stop bothering me!

597
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,369
You're disgusting!

598
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:41,126
What's the matter with you people?!

599
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,448
What's shaking?

600
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:49,564
- Captain Riggs.
- Captain Murtaugh.

601
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:52,247
Turn around and do that.
We're captains.

602
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:54,404
Heard you were up to your ass
in Chinese.

603
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:56,763
The taller ones come up to the navel.

604
00:36:57,053 --> 00:37:00,125
Big enough to kick your ass.
What can I do for you?

605
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:03,729
One of the ship's crew shot an illegal,
apparently under orders...

606
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:07,648
...and we'd dearly like to know
who's smuggling Chinese.

607
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:11,488
We're pretty sure the big boss
is Benny Chan.

608
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,802
Uncle Benny?

609
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:14,446
You know him?

610
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:17,572
- When he was running smack.
- We never nailed him.

611
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:18,922
Benny's slippery.

612
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,732
Where's he hang out?

613
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:23,049
He's got a nightclub,
some restaurants.

614
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,530
He operates mainly out on North
Broadway. Here's the address.

615
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:29,481
Hi, fellas.

616
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,689
There he is.
Hey, Burger! Summers.

617
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:33,968
Butters.

618
00:37:34,613 --> 00:37:36,205
What you got on the freighter homicide?

619
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:40,247
I talked to some illegals.
They only knew the shooter by sight.

620
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:45,402
The boat's registered under
a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.

621
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:48,406
It'll be a rough one to crack,
but we'll nail them.

622
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:50,166
You ever hear of Benny Chan?

623
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:52,608
No. What kind of bad man is he?

624
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,809
Real bad.
Crime boss in Chinatown.

625
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:57,653
If it's dirty and Chinese,
Benny's doing it.

626
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:59,565
Where do I find him?

627
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:00,848
At this restaurant.

628
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:03,402
I'm hungry for Chinese.
How about you?

629
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:06,326
We're going there anyway.
We'll drive you.

630
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:07,972
Let me get my jacket.

631
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:10,927
- Not with him.
- He's doing good.

632
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:12,652
We might need backup.

633
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:15,845
Spend time with him.
You might learn to love him.

634
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,486
Like a son.

635
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:18,962
In law...

636
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:22,563
...enforcement it pays to know
your fellow officer.

637
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:31,568
Sir, it'll be an honor
to share egg rolls with you.

638
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:34,441
Yeah, all right. Let's go.

639
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:36,006
Share?

640
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:42,409
Butters, it seems like you hate crime
in a sort of personal way.

641
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,206
Why do you say that, sir?

642
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:47,849
Last night I noticed you were
more than slightly miffed.

643
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,805
Wasn't he, Roger?

644
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:51,771
Any particular reason?

645
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:54,328
About 150,000 of them.

646
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:57,645
That's how many bullets zinged
my neighborhood growing up.

647
00:38:57,933 --> 00:39:00,731
Couldn't go outside.
Couldn't go near a window.

648
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:05,006
Lived and ate on the floor,
slept and watched TV on the floor.

649
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,609
I didn't learn to walk
till I was 10.

650
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,410
Spent my formative years
nose-to-nose with the family beagle.

651
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:15,364
When I work on a crime,
I ain't thinking about the crime.

652
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:18,764
I'm thinking about that floor
and it pisses me off.

653
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,929
- We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?
- No, why?

654
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,203
Because he's following us.
Don't look.

655
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:31,207
- Who's Leo?
- Maybe it's a coincidence.

656
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:34,730
- What does he want?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

657
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,530
- Fucking asshole!
- Bite me!

658
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:47,491
Whatever! Whatever!

659
00:39:48,493 --> 00:39:49,528
Jerk!

660
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:51,722
You looking for us?

661
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,442
- You saw me?
- Yeah, we saw you.

662
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:55,888
What you doing, Leo?

663
00:39:56,173 --> 00:39:59,165
I'm perfecting my tailing technique
now that I'm a P.I.

664
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:03,965
He's a private eyesore.
Inconspicuous vehicle! I like it.

665
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:06,372
Riggs, who's the perp?

666
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,529
- What'd you bust him for?
- I'm a perp?

667
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,686
A brother in a police car
is automatically a perp?

668
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:15,609
Look at my suit!
Do I look like the Crips' accountant?

669
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,852
Look at this badge, bitch!

670
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:19,885
Check out the gun.

671
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:21,407
Put the gun down!

672
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:24,446
License! Registration!
Urine sample!

673
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:25,842
I got a badge too!

674
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,448
German Jews didn't have it
easy as kids!

675
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:30,485
So don't think you're the only one.

676
00:40:30,813 --> 00:40:32,371
I knew you were a cop.

677
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:35,008
I was kidding.
I can smell a cop a mile away.

678
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,171
You saying I smell bad?

679
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:39,728
Don't turn everything around!
You're so touchy.

680
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:42,728
These guys'll tell you.
We got a history together.

681
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:44,930
Maybe we'll work together someday!

682
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:46,322
I'm the bomb!

683
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:50,242
We'll work together when I open
a cereal shop, you leprechaun!

684
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,842
I didn't call you names, fuckface!
Don't start!

685
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:54,692
Don't fool around!

686
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,245
- These guys'll tell you.
- You're double-parked.

687
00:40:58,573 --> 00:41:01,167
Officer, I'm just talking
with the detectives.

688
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:02,767
We don't know this guy.

689
00:41:03,973 --> 00:41:05,167
Think he was drinking.

690
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:07,045
They're kidding.
Come back!

691
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:09,602
I wasn't drinking!
They just said that.

692
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:13,044
Blow your breath in my hand.
I can smell it already.

693
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,812
Blow in my fucking ear!

694
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:18,201
You're all mine.
You're mine!

695
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:22,844
You promised to deliver the family.

696
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:25,450
They're not at the detention center.

697
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,245
They must have escaped.

698
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:31,129
The uncle won't finish until
he sees them.

699
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:35,652
Don't worry, they'll turn up.

700
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,532
In Hong Kong, you'd already be dead.

701
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,481
Where's Uncle Benny?

702
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:47,566
- He's not here.
- Is he in there?

703
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:49,172
- I'm sure he is.
- This way.

704
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:50,772
Yes, it's a two-way.

705
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,845
We have 3 people.

706
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:56,171
The restaurant's over there.
Go this way, please.

707
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:58,330
They see us,
but we can't see them.

708
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:01,047
- Where's your green card?
- That's a racist remark.

709
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:03,847
I'm a policeman
who asked for your green card!

710
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:05,208
This is not the way.

711
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:07,643
You're the boss
till we get up in his ass.

712
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,563
It'll be fine.
They've refurbished!

713
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,771
I couldn't stop them.

714
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:17,568
- Out, out!
- Can I get drink or food?

715
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:20,128
Uncle Benny!
I hope this is a bad time.

716
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:23,325
- He still has unclipped eyebrows.
- What'd we tell you?

717
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:27,282
- We hate not disturbing you.
- This is Detective Buckles.

718
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:31,486
Sell any heroin? Kill anyone lately?
How's the restaurant?

719
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:32,882
Eat something.

720
00:42:33,213 --> 00:42:35,124
Give you the police discount.

721
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,210
Flied lice?

722
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:39,284
It is fried rice, you plick!

723
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,684
I'm busy.
What is it this time?

724
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,761
Tell him, Buttkiss.

725
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:50,369
Know about a boatload of
illegals that went aground?

726
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:52,685
Just what I saw on the news.

727
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:54,764
Someone lost big money.

728
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:57,481
400 people at 35 grand.
14 million!

729
00:42:58,853 --> 00:43:00,844
And missed making them slaves.

730
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:05,126
You are cops.
Smuggling Chinese is an INS problem.

731
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:08,565
We found 3 bodies full of holes,
so now it's a cop problem.

732
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,172
Three dead Chinese?

733
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:13,730
- Billion more where they came from.
- Yes, life's cheap.

734
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:17,085
But he shot at us too.
That pisses us off.

735
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:18,802
Too bad they missed.

736
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:21,005
But I know nothing about it.

737
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:24,121
Who's he?

738
00:43:27,053 --> 00:43:28,930
He looks unhappy.
What's his name?

739
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,409
Who's this guy?
Is he just appraising your furniture?

740
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,251
He doesn't speak English.

741
00:43:34,453 --> 00:43:38,287
Then he doesn't understand
words like "scumbag"...

742
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:40,366
..."eat shit"?

743
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,603
I think he understands good.

744
00:43:48,413 --> 00:43:50,847
- Enter the drag queen.
- The insurance, remember?

745
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:53,562
If you have nothing on me,
get out.

746
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:55,566
We're still around.

747
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:57,241
I'm on your ass too.

748
00:43:58,213 --> 00:43:59,726
But the door is this way!

749
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:02,568
This is quicker.
This is quicker, really.

750
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:07,367
See? It's quicker!

751
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:12,165
Don't forget my
10°/° policeman's discount.

752
00:44:14,573 --> 00:44:17,963
You in Hong Kong,
you'd be dead.

753
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:21,571
No, not that!
Riggs! Don't!

754
00:44:23,893 --> 00:44:25,406
The insurance...
What the hell?

755
00:44:32,373 --> 00:44:33,692
Hurry up!

756
00:44:34,013 --> 00:44:37,369
Try it sometime.
It's satisfying and therapeutic.

757
00:44:37,653 --> 00:44:40,531
- Saves the cost of shrinks.
- Bad guys can't call the cops.

758
00:44:40,813 --> 00:44:43,373
- Why not? We're already here!
- El Ni o!

759
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:45,568
I know this guy.

760
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:47,126
That's the captain.
Hold it!

761
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,842
Remember, no damage!

762
00:45:08,213 --> 00:45:09,441
Shit!

763
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:15,766
LAPD! I'm commandeering
your bike. Here, $200.

764
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:17,767
Riggs, I'm coming!

765
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:20,291
Somebody stole your bike!

766
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:22,928
Stop!

767
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:24,842
Police!

768
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:27,492
Out of the way!

769
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,565
Butler!
Chase the fast one!

770
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,610
You have Alzheimer's?

771
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:46,447
Stop! Freeze!

772
00:45:59,613 --> 00:46:02,366
Stop in Chinese, motherfucker!
Halt!

773
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:17,251
Out the way! Police!

774
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:18,846
He's getting away!

775
00:46:25,693 --> 00:46:27,126
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

776
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:38,042
Get down! LAPD!

777
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,766
Stop, you little shit!

778
00:46:52,773 --> 00:46:55,128
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

779
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,443
My arm!
I didn't do anything!

780
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:11,846
I got you covered!

781
00:47:14,173 --> 00:47:17,165
You got the right to remain silent!
So shut the fuck up!

782
00:47:17,453 --> 00:47:20,684
You got the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one...

783
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:24,329
...we'll provide you with
the dumbest lawyer on Earth!

784
00:47:24,733 --> 00:47:26,883
If you get Johnnie Cochran,
I'll kill you!

785
00:47:38,213 --> 00:47:40,488
Don't jump!
You're going to be a father!

786
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:42,007
Don't jump!

787
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:48,448
Hold on!

788
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,884
Hold on! I'll get you!

789
00:47:51,253 --> 00:47:53,130
Riggs, don't move!

790
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:54,528
I won't move.

791
00:47:54,813 --> 00:47:55,882
Hold on! I got you!

792
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:57,407
You'll catch me?

793
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:00,645
No, I won't catch you.
I got a dumpster here.

794
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:02,844
You didn't do nothing.
Why'd you run?

795
00:48:03,053 --> 00:48:03,929
Butters!

796
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,646
- Get over here!
- Shit!

797
00:48:05,973 --> 00:48:06,849
Hurry up!

798
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:08,361
Come on!

799
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:10,248
Hold on!

800
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:13,604
A bit more to the left!

801
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:15,332
Move this there!
Now!

802
00:48:15,613 --> 00:48:16,841
No, the other left!

803
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,171
Make up your mind!

804
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,085
You couldn't find something smaller?!

805
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,527
It's all I could find!

806
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:25,168
I got it here!
Now, jump on "three"!

807
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:26,283
Ready?

808
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:28,410
Ass first!
It breaks the fall!

809
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,283
One...

810
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,444
...two, three!
Son of a bitch!

811
00:48:34,613 --> 00:48:36,012
You all right?

812
00:48:36,253 --> 00:48:37,527
I should've had him.

813
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,166
Damn right, you should've!

814
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:41,205
Who's your partner?

815
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:43,325
- Son of a bitch!
- I don't have a partner!

816
00:48:43,573 --> 00:48:44,801
The guy you ran with!

817
00:48:45,053 --> 00:48:46,566
I'm a waiter.

818
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:49,049
You guys pull a gun,
try to kill me!

819
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,767
You physically abuse me.
I want my lawyer!

820
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:56,647
If you're a waiter,
what's today's special?

821
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,689
What's today?

822
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:00,722
Wednesday!

823
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:03,967
Sweet and sour pork,
barbecue spareribs...

824
00:49:04,253 --> 00:49:05,652
Shut up!

825
00:49:06,413 --> 00:49:09,166
Next time, don't run!
Stay still!

826
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:11,812
Johnnie Cochran!

827
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:13,446
He fight for me!

828
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:14,444
<i>- Rebellion against his</i>
<i>domineering father.</i>

829
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:18,208
<i>Finally, Mao left home</i>
<i>to continue his schooling.</i>

830
00:50:23,293 --> 00:50:25,932
- Sorry, Sergeant Murtaugh.
- Sit, please.

831
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:27,686
And it's Roger.

832
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:31,564
- It's your chair.
- Really, it's fine. Sit.

833
00:50:31,813 --> 00:50:33,132
Something to drink?

834
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,368
Tequila?

835
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,327
Thank you so much.

836
00:50:36,773 --> 00:50:38,206
From Mexico.

837
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,411
This can't be the first time
you had tequila, Hong.

838
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:45,088
- Yes.
- No!

839
00:50:48,373 --> 00:50:49,408
Bread.

840
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,003
Bread.

841
00:50:51,813 --> 00:50:52,848
Toast!

842
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,606
Yeah, toast!

843
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:55,842
Bread!

844
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:02,686
You know anybody here?

845
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:04,042
My uncle.

846
00:51:04,413 --> 00:51:06,881
He pay so we can come to America.

847
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:08,805
You been in contact with him?

848
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:11,404
No. I leave message.

849
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:14,086
What's your uncle do?

850
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:18,091
In China, he's artist.

851
00:51:18,373 --> 00:51:19,567
An artist?

852
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:24,330
It's tough leaving home, huh?

853
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:29,126
In America...

854
00:51:29,773 --> 00:51:32,333
...my children have chance
to make good life.

855
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:35,527
We want the best for our children.

856
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:37,525
And our grandchildren!

857
00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:40,683
You believe
I'm a grandfather?

858
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:42,771
That's right! Little Ping!

859
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:44,972
You're a grandpa!

860
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:47,692
Where's the time go?

861
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:50,648
Don't know.

862
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:52,081
Have no watch.

863
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:53,772
You have no watch?

864
00:51:54,213 --> 00:51:55,328
Here.

865
00:51:55,693 --> 00:51:57,888
This is my pop's. Take it.

866
00:51:58,173 --> 00:52:00,733
He got it when he retired
from the force.

867
00:52:00,973 --> 00:52:02,725
No, I cannot!

868
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,327
I want you to have it.

869
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:08,208
It belonged to a good man.
It ought to belong to another good man.

870
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,766
Thank you so much...

871
00:52:11,973 --> 00:52:12,849
...Roger.

872
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,401
Shit!

873
00:53:43,813 --> 00:53:44,529
Hold him!

874
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:46,722
Push him off!

875
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:54,682
Get him!

876
00:53:58,013 --> 00:53:59,492
What's wrong?

877
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:01,411
It's the shoulder.

878
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:05,523
It's an old injury.
I'll have to toss in the towel.

879
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,085
It happens periodically.

880
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:12,011
I was just getting going too.
You're lucky, kid.

881
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:15,126
- You're lucky he didn't kill you.
- You owe me a rematch!

882
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,842
- Anytime you want.
- I might even train for it.

883
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,203
Better bring your own paramedic too.

884
00:54:22,213 --> 00:54:25,330
- I'll get ice for that shoulder.
- It's okay.

885
00:54:25,573 --> 00:54:27,643
There's nothing wrong with my shoulder.

886
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:31,931
I was faking it.

887
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:33,932
Faking it?

888
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:38,647
Gomez was killing me out there.
I didn't have anything left.

889
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:40,645
I told you that kid was good.

890
00:54:40,773 --> 00:54:43,446
He's good, but it's not all him.

891
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:48,726
I've been feeling it lately.
You know the other...

892
00:54:54,493 --> 00:54:57,291
Like, on the ship
when that guy nailed me.

893
00:54:57,493 --> 00:54:59,768
And yesterday I couldn't catch him.

894
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:02,971
I just thought,
I'm out of shape or something.

895
00:55:03,253 --> 00:55:05,813
You know.
But it's more than that.

896
00:55:06,093 --> 00:55:09,529
It's like,
I hate to say this but...

897
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:11,849
You're getting too old for this shit.

898
00:55:16,973 --> 00:55:18,372
How about that?

899
00:55:18,973 --> 00:55:19,962
Finally.

900
00:55:20,973 --> 00:55:23,328
No, but I can't be.
I mean, I'm only...

901
00:55:25,013 --> 00:55:27,004
- Jesus.
- Yeah, you're only.

902
00:55:28,853 --> 00:55:30,684
Can't beat the clock, Riggs.

903
00:55:33,173 --> 00:55:36,324
Murphy's right. We're dinosaurs.
What'll I do?

904
00:55:37,013 --> 00:55:38,241
Accept it.

905
00:55:40,853 --> 00:55:42,047
Like I do.

906
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:45,732
No. Bullshit!

907
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:47,641
I won't accept it.

908
00:55:47,893 --> 00:55:49,292
I'll will it not to happen.

909
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:51,131
You're going to will it?

910
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:53,250
I'm not too old for this shit.

911
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:57,207
I'm not too old for this shit.
We're not too old for this shit.

912
00:55:57,573 --> 00:56:00,451
We're not too old for this shit.
We're not too old for...

913
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:01,808
Say it like you believe it.

914
00:56:02,093 --> 00:56:04,084
We're not too old for this shit.

915
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,642
I'm not going to buy
a hemorrhoid cushion.

916
00:56:07,973 --> 00:56:08,769
I won't get corns!

917
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:10,292
I got corns!

918
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:11,369
I won't wear a suit!

919
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:13,889
What's wrong with wearing a suit?

920
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:15,566
How's it going, Captain?

921
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:27,564
Thanks a lot, guys.
Very funny!

922
00:56:27,853 --> 00:56:29,889
That cop tried to strip-search me!

923
00:56:30,173 --> 00:56:31,731
- You get his phone number?
- Funny.

924
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,481
Sugar-glazed with jelly.
Thanks, Leo.

925
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:36,564
- What happened? The scratches.
- A dog.

926
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,611
A dog catch you
drinking out of his bowl?

927
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,963
I'm working on
an important P.I. Case.

928
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:43,362
Did the dog hire you?

929
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:46,605
No! The people that
lost the dog hired me.

930
00:56:46,853 --> 00:56:47,842
Sounds like a big case.

931
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:52,371
It is a big case, Mr. Big Shot.
It's an expensive dog.

932
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:54,405
- A Bolshoi.
- Borzoi.

933
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:55,921
Whatever, whatever!

934
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:57,926
And you found it?

935
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,681
Sort of.
Listen to what happens.

936
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:05,121
Instead of going looking for the dog,
I went to the pound.

937
00:57:05,453 --> 00:57:09,162
I take the dog home, dye him.
It looks exactly like their dog.

938
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:10,727
Dog was a real rat, though.

939
00:57:10,933 --> 00:57:12,730
He scratched me.
But I got the job done.

940
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,890
Some kind of P.I. Business you got.

941
00:57:15,253 --> 00:57:17,084
Douche Ventura, pet infective.

942
00:57:17,373 --> 00:57:18,931
It's grand theft.

943
00:57:19,213 --> 00:57:20,851
With trickery, it's a felony.

944
00:57:21,093 --> 00:57:23,687
It is?
You guys are always kidding.

945
00:57:24,013 --> 00:57:27,972
I get it. Here comes
that touchy kid. I'm not here.

946
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,129
Putter!

947
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,723
The guy you chased in Chinatown?

948
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:35,282
His gun matched slugs
on the bodies on the boat.

949
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,369
He's your shooter.

950
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,732
Guy that got away from me.

951
00:57:39,893 --> 00:57:43,329
He didn't get far.
They found him on a rooftop nearby.

952
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:46,172
Strangled.
And pigeons ate his eyeballs.

953
00:57:47,373 --> 00:57:48,249
Cool.

954
00:57:48,893 --> 00:57:50,372
Excuse me.

955
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:56,243
I hate these phones!
You get a call, they cut you off.

956
00:57:56,493 --> 00:57:58,848
You make a call, they cut you off!

957
00:57:59,173 --> 00:58:02,290
You know what they're doing?
They fuck you with cell phones.

958
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:05,764
They love when you get cut off.
You know why?

959
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:07,406
When you call back...

960
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:11,362
...they charge you for the first
minute again at that high rate.

961
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:13,609
If you're able to call back...

962
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:17,209
...because the 3-hour battery
you got only lasts 20 minutes.

963
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,245
If you're behind a hill, it goes...

964
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:23,208
Or you go through a tunnel.
And they keep making it smaller!

965
00:58:23,453 --> 00:58:25,921
You know why?
So you can lose it.

966
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,370
So you buy more phones.
I never lost my mother's phone!

967
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:32,804
Take you two hours to make
a long-distance call.

968
00:58:35,373 --> 00:58:38,649
I messed up! Hang up.
Got to do it again!

969
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:42,765
I never lost my
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit phone.

970
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:46,562
And scanners! They get your
number and call all over the world!

971
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:50,169
Somebody took my number
and called Afghanistan!

972
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:54,369
I don't know what fucking
Afghanistan look like.

973
00:58:54,653 --> 00:58:58,441
Even if I did, I would not talk
to their Afghan ass for 3 hours!

974
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,724
I won't talk to my daddy for 3 hours!

975
00:59:01,013 --> 00:59:03,607
They fuck you with the cell phones!

976
00:59:03,893 --> 00:59:06,612
You know when you go to a drive-through?
Hold on.

977
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:08,326
Why am I talking...?

978
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:12,451
- Leo Getz, private investigator.
- Private investigator?

979
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:15,611
I wondered if you'd
investigate my privates.

980
00:59:16,573 --> 00:59:17,722
Investigate what?

981
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,449
My privates, you stupid shit.
Shut the fuck up!

982
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:24,372
Very funny!
You're costing me money.

983
00:59:24,613 --> 00:59:27,491
$3 to answer a call.
They fuck me, now you!

984
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:29,251
You're tough when on the phone.

985
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:31,125
Right!
Telephone tough guy.

986
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,812
Why are we talking on the phone?

987
00:59:33,013 --> 00:59:35,083
Get out of here.
Go home!

988
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:36,772
What happened to your face?

989
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,204
"No" means no!

990
00:59:41,973 --> 00:59:43,770
He'll like me, I can tell.

991
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:45,162
He'd be the first.

992
00:59:47,973 --> 00:59:49,645
Whatever! Whatever!

993
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:57,126
You know, we should hire Leo.

994
00:59:57,653 --> 00:59:58,642
Hire Leo?

995
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:00,730
He can follow Uncle Benny around.

996
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:02,605
- Benny'll see him.
- Yeah!

997
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:05,447
- He'll drive him nuts.
- Benny'll shoot him.

998
01:00:07,253 --> 01:00:08,447
Let's hire him!

999
01:00:09,213 --> 01:00:11,283
I smell like stale coffee.

1000
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:17,053
Why do you care if I go home
and change shirts?

1001
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,405
A coffee stain's not something
that'd bother me.

1002
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:21,847
Look at the way you dress.

1003
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:24,047
What's that supposed to mean?

1004
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:29,205
I don't have nifty suits like you.
Not many cops do.

1005
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:31,131
What's that supposed to mean?

1006
01:00:33,253 --> 01:00:36,245
I've wondered,
where's the money coming from?

1007
01:00:37,453 --> 01:00:39,250
Where do you think?

1008
01:00:39,493 --> 01:00:41,404
- Where do you think?
- I don't know.

1009
01:00:41,693 --> 01:00:44,446
- It's none of my business.
- You don't know!

1010
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:47,373
Trish gave me some money.

1011
01:00:47,653 --> 01:00:50,611
Money from my Aunt Anne, who died.

1012
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,726
All right. Sorry.

1013
01:00:55,573 --> 01:00:56,767
Whose car is that?

1014
01:00:57,773 --> 01:00:58,922
I don't know.

1015
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:02,332
It looks like a full house
for Lamaze class.

1016
01:01:02,573 --> 01:01:03,642
You know that car?

1017
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:05,525
Here you go, Captains.

1018
01:01:07,093 --> 01:01:08,321
No charge for the ride.

1019
01:01:09,173 --> 01:01:13,291
- Rianne and Lorna are here.
- I'll put it on your account, Captain.

1020
01:01:17,893 --> 01:01:18,882
Hey, honey.

1021
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:21,842
What's going on?
I came home to change my shirt...

1022
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,243
Why are you here?

1023
01:01:28,693 --> 01:01:29,921
They took the Hongs.

1024
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:38,722
Shit!

1025
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:41,247
Drop it.

1026
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:56,651
Girls, get out!

1027
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:02,652
Look who we got here.

1028
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,770
- Uncle Benny's friend.
- Hey, Bruce.

1029
01:02:05,773 --> 01:02:07,126
Nice pajamas.

1030
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,651
Where are the Hongs?

1031
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:19,886
Drop your guns.

1032
01:02:20,373 --> 01:02:22,568
- Drop them!
- Okay, take it easy.

1033
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,248
Don't stand for that, honey.

1034
01:02:32,413 --> 01:02:33,289
Son of a bitch!

1035
01:04:02,613 --> 01:04:04,171
Let the women go.

1036
01:04:23,413 --> 01:04:25,005
I can't breathe!

1037
01:04:54,773 --> 01:04:55,842
Son of a bitch!

1038
01:05:17,733 --> 01:05:19,371
I'll be damned!
Thanks, kid!

1039
01:05:24,773 --> 01:05:26,172
Ping, cut us loose!

1040
01:05:32,613 --> 01:05:33,602
Cut me loose!

1041
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:37,246
Go ahead, cut me.

1042
01:06:17,893 --> 01:06:19,326
It's all right.

1043
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:21,527
You okay, honey?

1044
01:06:21,973 --> 01:06:23,691
I owe you one, kid.

1045
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:27,489
- The keys to your car?
- They're in the car.

1046
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:29,562
We need a radio.

1047
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:35,401
We have to go.

1048
01:06:37,053 --> 01:06:40,363
How will we find them?
We got to catch them assholes!

1049
01:06:46,653 --> 01:06:50,362
<i>- 3-William-56, this is Air 12.</i>
- We need your eyes, guys.

1050
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:53,805
Looking for a black Mercedes
and a black Continental.

1051
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:56,647
<i>Vicinity of Ladera at the 210 freeway.</i>

1052
01:06:56,933 --> 01:06:59,049
Black Mercedes and black Continental?

1053
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:02,086
<i>Shouldn 't be hard</i>
<i>to find in this town.</i>

1054
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,483
Just give it a shot, will you?

1055
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,724
<i>- Be cooperative.</i>
- That's a roger.

1056
01:07:16,853 --> 01:07:18,332
Will wonders never cease?

1057
01:07:18,653 --> 01:07:22,362
<i>We've got 2 black Mercedes,</i>
<i>one heading east, one west.</i>

1058
01:07:23,053 --> 01:07:25,248
<i>Eastbound's on the Valley View ramp.</i>

1059
01:07:26,733 --> 01:07:28,769
We'll take it.
Locate the Continental.

1060
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:32,084
- Is it the right one?
- I don't know.

1061
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,210
We're going east and China's east.

1062
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:36,364
- China's west too.
- We can't divide.

1063
01:07:36,613 --> 01:07:37,523
Think positive!

1064
01:07:42,213 --> 01:07:43,248
You crossed two lanes!

1065
01:07:43,653 --> 01:07:44,608
You see him?

1066
01:07:51,773 --> 01:07:53,411
Watch the road!

1067
01:07:53,853 --> 01:07:55,764
I'd give my right arm for a siren!

1068
01:07:59,893 --> 01:08:01,690
Why'd they take the Hongs?

1069
01:08:02,013 --> 01:08:04,573
Maybe they're shaking them down
for more money.

1070
01:08:07,733 --> 01:08:11,089
Hong's uncle paid already.
He got in touch with his uncle.

1071
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:14,570
He left him a message.
It's how they know where I live.

1072
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,652
There's the son of a bitch right there!

1073
01:08:26,973 --> 01:08:29,851
Bastards left us to burn!
I want to talk with them.

1074
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:32,004
You don't have any guns!

1075
01:08:32,253 --> 01:08:33,572
Get me near this trailer.

1076
01:08:33,853 --> 01:08:34,683
But you're driving!

1077
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:35,882
No, you're driving!

1078
01:08:36,093 --> 01:08:38,288
There's cruise control.
Just steer!

1079
01:08:38,693 --> 01:08:40,604
Why make shit complicated?

1080
01:08:48,453 --> 01:08:50,921
Closer. Don't be shy.
Get up there!

1081
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:54,445
Closer! Closer!

1082
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:55,762
That's it!

1083
01:09:28,253 --> 01:09:29,572
Here, asshole!
Come in!

1084
01:09:32,893 --> 01:09:35,726
I need to ask you something.
Where's the Hongs?

1085
01:10:08,573 --> 01:10:10,643
Where's the Hongs?
Where are they?

1086
01:10:17,573 --> 01:10:18,483
Get him!

1087
01:10:47,013 --> 01:10:50,562
<i>Highway Patrol, this is William-356,</i>
<i>southbound on highway!</i>

1088
01:10:51,173 --> 01:10:53,050
<i>Officer in trouble!</i>
<i>Oversized trailer.</i>

1089
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:56,890
LAPD! Pull over! LAPD!

1090
01:10:57,813 --> 01:10:59,292
LAPD! Pull over!

1091
01:11:03,053 --> 01:11:04,532
Pull over! See that?!

1092
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:06,366
Right! Fuck you!

1093
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:11,363
I got an ass with a phony badge
trying to pull me over!

1094
01:11:34,573 --> 01:11:36,006
Get away from my boy!

1095
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:53,562
Son of a bitch!

1096
01:11:56,693 --> 01:11:57,728
I got you!

1097
01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:08,212
Get in here!

1098
01:12:16,693 --> 01:12:18,570
Get the fuck in here!

1099
01:12:18,893 --> 01:12:19,882
Ready?

1100
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:27,249
- Welcome back.
- What a drag!

1101
01:12:27,453 --> 01:12:29,728
- Thanks, Rog.
- And the Hongs?

1102
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,571
We'll ask the other guy. Go!

1103
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:42,810
Pull over! Son of a bitch!

1104
01:12:48,293 --> 01:12:50,170
Keep your hands inside, then!

1105
01:13:14,253 --> 01:13:15,288
Out of the way!

1106
01:13:16,973 --> 01:13:18,486
Wait! There he is!

1107
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:19,882
Keep going!

1108
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:39,928
We're gaining!

1109
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,448
I got him!

1110
01:14:05,413 --> 01:14:06,402
You okay?

1111
01:14:06,653 --> 01:14:09,042
Yeah, I think
my heart's still beating.

1112
01:14:15,733 --> 01:14:17,530
Maybe a little too close.

1113
01:14:21,853 --> 01:14:24,367
<i>You are now entering an</i>
<i>international holding area.</i>

1114
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:27,247
<i>Please have proper documentation ready.</i>

1115
01:14:59,053 --> 01:15:00,042
General.

1116
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:01,886
Are you armed?

1117
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,683
When will you have
the money for their release?

1118
01:15:20,293 --> 01:15:21,328
Very soon.

1119
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:15,362
Brother... it's been a long time.

1120
01:16:15,813 --> 01:16:17,804
It'll be our time again soon.

1121
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:21,688
America has many laws.

1122
01:16:21,933 --> 01:16:26,211
But written by men.

1123
01:16:26,893 --> 01:16:30,010
Money can change everything.

1124
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:07,493
- Sorry about your loss.
- Thank you.

1125
01:17:09,093 --> 01:17:10,321
How's my hero?

1126
01:17:10,653 --> 01:17:13,929
He's a little sad,
talking about his mom and dad.

1127
01:17:18,053 --> 01:17:19,247
Here's Butters.

1128
01:17:23,693 --> 01:17:24,967
How's it going?

1129
01:17:25,213 --> 01:17:26,123
Why are you here?

1130
01:17:26,413 --> 01:17:30,042
I heard it on the radio.
I'm sorry about your house.

1131
01:17:32,173 --> 01:17:33,811
This is Detective...

1132
01:17:34,093 --> 01:17:35,651
Butters.

1133
01:17:35,893 --> 01:17:37,372
Trish, my wife.

1134
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,723
Nick, Carrie...

1135
01:17:39,973 --> 01:17:40,962
...Rianne.

1136
01:17:41,253 --> 01:17:42,242
Everybody okay?

1137
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:45,931
You know who did this?

1138
01:17:46,173 --> 01:17:47,401
It was Benny.

1139
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:50,166
Leo!

1140
01:17:50,613 --> 01:17:53,366
- You got a phone?
- The little Fonzie guy?

1141
01:17:53,733 --> 01:17:54,882
That's him.

1142
01:17:55,493 --> 01:17:58,132
- You be okay?
- We'll be all right.

1143
01:17:58,693 --> 01:17:59,728
Call me.

1144
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:05,331
He's there?
We'll be right there.

1145
01:18:05,573 --> 01:18:09,248
- Butters, can you drive us?
- Yeah, let's do it.

1146
01:18:09,653 --> 01:18:12,042
Leo's got him at the dentist.
Let's go!

1147
01:18:16,013 --> 01:18:17,128
Sit down.

1148
01:18:23,413 --> 01:18:24,448
<i>Captain Murtaugh...</i>

1149
01:18:25,053 --> 01:18:28,011
...I know this is a bad time...

1150
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:31,126
...but there's something
you need to know about me.

1151
01:18:31,893 --> 01:18:34,361
I think I know what it is.

1152
01:18:34,613 --> 01:18:35,807
You do?

1153
01:18:37,053 --> 01:18:38,532
It's okay.

1154
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:40,607
It is?

1155
01:18:40,853 --> 01:18:43,048
People have the right to do
what makes them happy.

1156
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,449
Just don't expect me to like it.

1157
01:18:46,173 --> 01:18:47,970
I know this must be hard for you.

1158
01:18:48,293 --> 01:18:49,408
It's impossible for me!

1159
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:54,283
I hoped we'd get together
for the holidays, say Christmas.

1160
01:18:54,653 --> 01:18:58,646
Why should we get together
and see each other on Christmas?

1161
01:18:59,253 --> 01:19:01,403
- I'm trying to reach out.
- Reach somewhere else!

1162
01:19:01,813 --> 01:19:04,088
Do what you want,
but leave me out of it.

1163
01:19:04,413 --> 01:19:06,973
- I got it.
- I don't want to hear about it.

1164
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:08,482
Not a word.

1165
01:19:08,733 --> 01:19:12,772
Why you grinning?
Think about how we can talk to Benny.

1166
01:19:13,213 --> 01:19:14,851
I got it all worked out.

1167
01:19:15,613 --> 01:19:17,046
What's the matter?

1168
01:19:17,493 --> 01:19:18,482
My ass hurts.

1169
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:20,769
My tooth!
Is this a dentist or proctologist?

1170
01:19:21,293 --> 01:19:23,853
- Please be quiet.
- I'm trying! I'm in pain!

1171
01:19:24,133 --> 01:19:26,772
Why don't you go see
your own dentist?

1172
01:19:27,133 --> 01:19:29,408
My dentist's in Detroit or I'd go!

1173
01:19:29,693 --> 01:19:32,161
- Oh, brother!
- Oh, brother?! Get the dentist!

1174
01:19:33,213 --> 01:19:35,773
I'm sorry to bother you.
It's an emergency.

1175
01:19:36,093 --> 01:19:38,129
A man walked in off the street.

1176
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,841
He's in a lot of pain.
You better come.

1177
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,322
Okay, you can come in now!

1178
01:19:55,173 --> 01:19:58,848
- Leo can pull this off?
- Leo's got a B.S. In B.S.

1179
01:20:00,813 --> 01:20:02,246
Coast is clear.

1180
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:05,884
Talk to the hand!
One second.

1181
01:20:06,573 --> 01:20:09,645
- Wait a minute.
- Let me do my job!

1182
01:20:10,053 --> 01:20:12,772
You hurt me, I'll stick
an egg roll up your ass.

1183
01:20:20,013 --> 01:20:22,322
Don't be alarmed.
It's only a drill.

1184
01:20:22,653 --> 01:20:23,642
Don't say a word.

1185
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:25,042
Shut up.

1186
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,609
Where are the Hongs?
Open wide and tell me.

1187
01:20:29,853 --> 01:20:31,081
I don't know any Hongs.

1188
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,967
Their uncle paid you
to get them out of China.

1189
01:20:34,253 --> 01:20:36,244
More smuggling?
We went through that.

1190
01:20:36,493 --> 01:20:37,767
We're going through it again.

1191
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:39,566
I have nothing to say.

1192
01:20:39,973 --> 01:20:41,964
These look very interesting.

1193
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:43,566
You're not going to use it.

1194
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:45,201
You won't shoot me.

1195
01:20:45,453 --> 01:20:47,489
- You're lousy cops.
- We're good cops.

1196
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:51,247
This will settle him down.

1197
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:53,769
Breathe, Uncle Benny.
Breathe!

1198
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:55,848
Crank up the nitrous.

1199
01:20:56,533 --> 01:20:57,727
Crank that baby up.

1200
01:20:58,013 --> 01:20:59,685
You said it wouldn't hurt!

1201
01:21:00,013 --> 01:21:01,332
I'm holding this. Go ahead.

1202
01:21:01,973 --> 01:21:04,043
Deep! Right down to your toes.

1203
01:21:11,053 --> 01:21:13,169
- He's wasted!
- Have some more.

1204
01:21:13,533 --> 01:21:15,205
He'll talk.

1205
01:21:16,093 --> 01:21:17,572
Good, breathe.

1206
01:21:21,173 --> 01:21:22,845
- That's me.
- That's you.

1207
01:21:25,133 --> 01:21:27,363
Now, where are the Hongs?

1208
01:21:30,573 --> 01:21:32,882
- What's <i>renminbi</i> mean?
<i>- Renminbi</i> means...

1209
01:21:33,133 --> 01:21:34,088
<i>... renminbi.</i>

1210
01:21:34,453 --> 01:21:37,206
- You're a funny guy.
- This guy's wasting our time.

1211
01:21:37,533 --> 01:21:38,522
Time!

1212
01:21:39,093 --> 01:21:41,049
Time for Four Fathers!

1213
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:42,925
Washington, Jefferson?
Those guys?

1214
01:21:43,253 --> 01:21:44,242
Roosevelt?

1215
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:47,323
I'm sleeping with my wife's 2 sisters.

1216
01:21:47,733 --> 01:21:48,927
You lucky son of a bitch!

1217
01:21:49,253 --> 01:21:50,447
That's a good one.

1218
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:52,402
Not so good...

1219
01:21:52,813 --> 01:21:54,531
...when my wife finds out.

1220
01:21:56,693 --> 01:21:59,161
I don't need needles!

1221
01:22:01,493 --> 01:22:03,563
Let's shoot his legs with Novocain...

1222
01:22:03,813 --> 01:22:06,247
...and watch him
try to get out of here.

1223
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:10,968
What you got in your hands there?

1224
01:22:11,253 --> 01:22:12,447
A nut cup.

1225
01:22:13,693 --> 01:22:15,331
I got some big nuts!

1226
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:19,487
That's nitrous...

1227
01:22:20,213 --> 01:22:21,487
...oxide!

1228
01:22:22,453 --> 01:22:23,772
Laughing gas!

1229
01:22:24,133 --> 01:22:25,851
We're stoned!

1230
01:22:29,973 --> 01:22:31,531
Murtaugh! Hurry up!

1231
01:22:31,933 --> 01:22:34,925
That's one funny son-in-law
you got there, Rog.

1232
01:22:35,573 --> 01:22:37,006
After tonight it be too late.

1233
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:38,971
Too late for what?

1234
01:22:41,253 --> 01:22:42,925
Why'd you call him my son-in-law?

1235
01:22:43,293 --> 01:22:44,965
Uncle Benny? He's too old.

1236
01:22:47,173 --> 01:22:50,006
Buy Four Fathers back
at Four Fathers' store.

1237
01:22:50,893 --> 01:22:52,929
Why's he talking about his ancestors?

1238
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:54,492
I don't know.

1239
01:22:55,173 --> 01:22:57,243
Why you call him my son-in-law?

1240
01:22:57,733 --> 01:22:58,927
Because I am!

1241
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:05,521
I thought he was...

1242
01:23:08,453 --> 01:23:09,727
No, I'm...

1243
01:23:12,173 --> 01:23:13,162
Bloody marvelous!

1244
01:23:13,853 --> 01:23:15,969
Your baby is having my baby.

1245
01:23:17,573 --> 01:23:20,292
My baby is having his baby.

1246
01:23:20,693 --> 01:23:23,002
And your baby? Whoa, baby!

1247
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,766
Whoa, baby! My baby!

1248
01:23:25,813 --> 01:23:27,610
What are you doing?

1249
01:23:27,813 --> 01:23:29,963
I couldn't stall anymore.

1250
01:23:30,893 --> 01:23:32,451
What happened?

1251
01:23:33,613 --> 01:23:35,683
Rog, look at this.
Does that hurt?

1252
01:23:43,413 --> 01:23:46,769
Uncle Benny,
anything happens to the Hongs...

1253
01:23:46,973 --> 01:23:48,929
...we'll come back
and rip you a new one.

1254
01:23:49,133 --> 01:23:50,691
That's two for Benny.

1255
01:23:51,053 --> 01:23:52,725
Bloody marvelous!

1256
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:58,602
- Are you crazy?
- Why did you do that?

1257
01:23:58,853 --> 01:24:00,809
For keeping it from me
and letting me think...

1258
01:24:01,173 --> 01:24:02,845
Hit him, not me.

1259
01:24:03,093 --> 01:24:06,369
As soon as we find the Hongs,
we're getting into this.

1260
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:52,883
Uncle.

1261
01:24:53,413 --> 01:24:54,562
You're all here?

1262
01:24:54,853 --> 01:24:56,127
All here.

1263
01:24:57,813 --> 01:24:59,212
What's going on?

1264
01:24:59,533 --> 01:25:01,922
As payment for bringing you
to America...

1265
01:25:02,133 --> 01:25:04,124
...your uncle's working for us.

1266
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:06,207
Now finish the job.

1267
01:25:06,453 --> 01:25:08,250
What job?

1268
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:10,531
No time to talk now.

1269
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:12,843
Take them to their new homes...

1270
01:25:13,093 --> 01:25:15,653
...and guarantee their safety.
Then I'll finish.

1271
01:25:29,293 --> 01:25:33,366
Finish now or watch the others die.

1272
01:25:49,973 --> 01:25:51,406
<i>Rimminy</i>?

1273
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:54,725
A young bimbo? A jumping jiminy?
I don't know.

1274
01:25:55,893 --> 01:25:57,121
<i>I can 't remember.</i>

1275
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,211
No, Riggs. <i>Renminbi.</i>

1276
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:00,848
Say that again.

1277
01:26:01,133 --> 01:26:02,088
That's it!

1278
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:03,323
<i>You got it.</i>

1279
01:26:03,573 --> 01:26:05,086
<i>Means, "people's money."</i>

1280
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:06,328
People's money?

1281
01:26:06,693 --> 01:26:07,842
<i>What else did Benny say?</i>

1282
01:26:08,173 --> 01:26:11,882
<i>He was talking about</i>
<i>buying back his ancestors.</i>

1283
01:26:12,253 --> 01:26:13,925
<i>And about how tonight's...</i>

1284
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:15,971
...too late.
Mean anything to you?

1285
01:26:16,173 --> 01:26:17,242
No, nothing at all.

1286
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:21,566
And the guy who torched my house?
Benny was afraid of him.

1287
01:26:21,853 --> 01:26:24,572
<i>If Benny's scared,</i>
<i>he's got to be a Chinese Triad.</i>

1288
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:27,322
<i>Those guys kill anyone</i>
<i>in their way.</i>

1289
01:26:27,613 --> 01:26:28,363
Including cops...

1290
01:26:28,573 --> 01:26:31,371
<i>... and their families.</i>
<i>Watch your asses!</i>

1291
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:33,132
<i>- Thanks, Ng.</i>
<i>- Keep me posted.</i>

1292
01:26:34,413 --> 01:26:36,768
Pick up your wife, my daughter.

1293
01:26:36,973 --> 01:26:39,203
- I'll get Trish, you get Lorna.
- Her and Ping.

1294
01:27:40,373 --> 01:27:41,203
What?

1295
01:27:42,533 --> 01:27:44,171
You want to get married, don't you?

1296
01:27:46,093 --> 01:27:46,969
No.

1297
01:27:51,613 --> 01:27:53,569
Yes. Yes, I do.

1298
01:27:54,453 --> 01:27:56,569
But if you don't want to, it's okay.

1299
01:27:57,493 --> 01:27:58,892
Why didn't you tell me?

1300
01:27:59,213 --> 01:28:01,807
Because I didn't want to put
any pressure on you.

1301
01:28:02,013 --> 01:28:04,243
If you want to someday, that'd be great.

1302
01:28:05,973 --> 01:28:07,372
If you don't...

1303
01:28:07,853 --> 01:28:09,491
...I love you.

1304
01:28:13,013 --> 01:28:15,766
I'll take you any way I can get you.

1305
01:28:20,893 --> 01:28:22,121
Feel that!

1306
01:28:22,893 --> 01:28:25,532
- Ping, feel the baby!
- He's really dancing.

1307
01:28:25,813 --> 01:28:27,246
He's kicking. You feel him?

1308
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:15,922
You're okay.

1309
01:29:16,173 --> 01:29:17,686
<i>Riggs. Pick up, Riggs.</i>

1310
01:29:17,933 --> 01:29:19,605
Riggs, it's Murtaugh.

1311
01:29:20,613 --> 01:29:23,969
I'm sick of these fuckers.
Let's just find them and shoot them.

1312
01:29:24,613 --> 01:29:26,922
Meet me and Butters on South Spring.

1313
01:29:27,213 --> 01:29:28,168
<i>What's going on?</i>

1314
01:29:30,613 --> 01:29:32,444
They found my watch.

1315
01:29:35,893 --> 01:29:39,442
They killed Hong, his uncle,
Uncle Benny too. Bodies are in there.

1316
01:29:39,733 --> 01:29:42,042
- Where's the rest of the family?
- They're okay.

1317
01:29:42,893 --> 01:29:46,203
INS raided a Chinese sweatshop.

1318
01:29:46,893 --> 01:29:50,966
Hong's family was being held there
and they led them back here.

1319
01:29:52,573 --> 01:29:54,291
They were making funny money.

1320
01:29:54,573 --> 01:29:55,972
Ink's still wet.

1321
01:29:56,693 --> 01:29:59,332
- Where are the faces?
- It's why I call it funny.

1322
01:29:59,933 --> 01:30:01,730
Why are they making Chinese money?

1323
01:30:02,013 --> 01:30:03,810
Can they even exchange it here?

1324
01:30:04,013 --> 01:30:05,241
- Only in China.
<i>- Renminbi.</i>

1325
01:30:05,493 --> 01:30:06,687
I remember.

1326
01:30:08,573 --> 01:30:11,963
Hong's uncle was an artist.
Maybe an engraver.

1327
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:15,968
Bringing over his family could've
been how he was paid for the job.

1328
01:30:16,253 --> 01:30:17,686
- That's thin.
- It's not.

1329
01:30:17,973 --> 01:30:19,201
Keep talking. What?

1330
01:30:19,573 --> 01:30:22,531
Benny said something about paying...

1331
01:30:22,853 --> 01:30:24,525
...buying back his forefathers.

1332
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:25,683
What'd you say?

1333
01:30:26,773 --> 01:30:30,004
Benny said something about buying
back his forefathers.

1334
01:30:30,293 --> 01:30:31,885
You said ancestors.

1335
01:30:32,133 --> 01:30:33,851
What's the difference?

1336
01:30:34,133 --> 01:30:36,966
The number four.
Four Fathers.

1337
01:30:37,293 --> 01:30:39,602
They were the top guys
of the Hong Kong Triad.

1338
01:30:39,813 --> 01:30:41,405
They disappeared from prison.

1339
01:30:41,613 --> 01:30:43,683
Reds jailed them when they
took over Hong Kong.

1340
01:30:43,853 --> 01:30:44,649
I bet they're here.

1341
01:30:44,853 --> 01:30:45,968
Damn, we're good.

1342
01:30:46,253 --> 01:30:49,131
Grab Ping. I don't want him
to see the bodies.

1343
01:30:52,133 --> 01:30:54,249
10 to 1, I know where the money is...

1344
01:30:54,493 --> 01:30:57,246
...and where the Four Fathers are.
Let me make a call.

1345
01:30:57,653 --> 01:30:58,642
Don't leave without us.

1346
01:30:59,373 --> 01:31:01,648
Good work!
You must be a detective.

1347
01:31:01,893 --> 01:31:03,485
I have my moments.

1348
01:31:09,573 --> 01:31:10,642
Uncle Benny.

1349
01:31:11,253 --> 01:31:13,687
I was actually starting
to like the old goat.

1350
01:31:13,933 --> 01:31:15,412
Bloody marvelous.

1351
01:31:15,733 --> 01:31:17,724
And it's fried rice, "you plick."

1352
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:28,486
- Which one is Hong?
- In front of you.

1353
01:31:29,053 --> 01:31:31,726
I want a complete set
of forensics on all three.

1354
01:31:35,613 --> 01:31:37,569
Dads and their kids.

1355
01:31:40,293 --> 01:31:42,090
I'll take care of yours, buddy.

1356
01:31:42,773 --> 01:31:43,762
We got to go!

1357
01:31:44,133 --> 01:31:46,283
- Take care of yourself.
- Where're we going?

1358
01:31:46,533 --> 01:31:48,046
- L.A. Harbor.
- What's there?

1359
01:31:48,293 --> 01:31:50,011
It's a foreign trade zone.

1360
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:52,681
Shady deals with the Chinese military.

1361
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:55,528
<i>It's run by a corrupt Chinese general.</i>

1362
01:31:55,853 --> 01:32:00,449
<i>I got it, a corrupt Chinese general</i>
<i>brought the Four Fathers here...</i>

1363
01:32:00,733 --> 01:32:02,530
<i>... and the Triad's</i>
<i>buying their release.</i>

1364
01:32:02,813 --> 01:32:05,281
<i>That's what Uncle Benny meant</i>
<i>by buying them back.</i>

1365
01:32:05,573 --> 01:32:08,690
<i>That general will shit</i>
<i>when he sees the money's counterfeit.</i>

1366
01:32:08,973 --> 01:32:10,452
<i>Let's tell him.</i>

1367
01:32:51,373 --> 01:32:52,692
Hi, gang.

1368
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:54,122
LAPD.

1369
01:32:58,133 --> 01:32:59,725
I saw Hong.

1370
01:33:00,053 --> 01:33:02,647
This is what Benny meant
by buying the Four Fathers.

1371
01:33:02,893 --> 01:33:06,647
Harpo, Groucho, Chico and Fucko.
How are you, boys?

1372
01:33:07,053 --> 01:33:08,168
Who's the naughty general?

1373
01:33:08,453 --> 01:33:10,409
Who's been lining his pockets?

1374
01:33:10,733 --> 01:33:13,293
Naughty!
Speaky English?

1375
01:33:15,093 --> 01:33:16,082
What do you want?

1376
01:33:17,613 --> 01:33:18,489
See this?

1377
01:33:18,813 --> 01:33:21,771
I hope you need lots of
toilet paper back home.

1378
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:23,605
That's all it's good for.

1379
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:26,766
Take the Four Pops back to China.
We don't give a shit.

1380
01:33:27,093 --> 01:33:27,923
The Four Pops!

1381
01:33:29,053 --> 01:33:31,248
Don't want them no more.
It's counterfeit.

1382
01:33:31,533 --> 01:33:33,888
Triads never prosper
cheating a general.

1383
01:33:35,853 --> 01:33:37,206
See for yourself.

1384
01:33:48,533 --> 01:33:51,366
Money losing face.
General losing face.

1385
01:33:51,653 --> 01:33:54,121
Hard when Triad try to sit on it.

1386
01:33:57,133 --> 01:33:59,124
I fucked you. I fucked you!

1387
01:33:59,653 --> 01:34:00,563
We fucked you.

1388
01:34:00,853 --> 01:34:02,923
It's beautiful!

1389
01:34:05,413 --> 01:34:06,607
Don't we get a hand?

1390
01:34:16,973 --> 01:34:19,123
Keep your head down!
Let them shoot each other!

1391
01:34:19,413 --> 01:34:20,607
Watch out!

1392
01:34:22,813 --> 01:34:23,643
Thanks!

1393
01:34:35,053 --> 01:34:36,042
Was this a good idea?

1394
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:37,322
It was an idea!

1395
01:34:44,133 --> 01:34:45,566
11 in the mag, 1 in the pipe.
You?

1396
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:47,292
Wheel gun. 6 shots.

1397
01:34:49,693 --> 01:34:50,489
Four!

1398
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:59,689
Why are you lying to me?

1399
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,085
I.A. Says you're on the take.

1400
01:35:03,293 --> 01:35:04,442
I'm on the take?!

1401
01:35:04,653 --> 01:35:07,690
I think it's crazy!
But you're spending lots of money!

1402
01:35:08,053 --> 01:35:09,611
You ever hear of Ebony Clark?

1403
01:35:10,733 --> 01:35:13,725
Yeah! She writes those
cheesy sex novels!

1404
01:35:14,653 --> 01:35:15,768
Are you boinking her?

1405
01:35:16,013 --> 01:35:18,925
No, I'm not boinking Ebony Clark!

1406
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:20,851
Trish is Ebony Clark.

1407
01:35:23,573 --> 01:35:24,449
You are boinking her!

1408
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:28,209
Yeah, I'm boinking her.

1409
01:35:42,053 --> 01:35:43,247
Too embarrassing to tell anybody.

1410
01:35:43,533 --> 01:35:45,012
Yeah, I don't blame you.

1411
01:35:45,373 --> 01:35:46,726
- She makes lots of money.
- How many you got?

1412
01:35:46,973 --> 01:35:48,406
Two.

1413
01:35:49,293 --> 01:35:50,646
I'll look for more ammo.

1414
01:36:20,253 --> 01:36:21,652
Who's in white pajamas?

1415
01:36:22,253 --> 01:36:24,926
Wah Sing Ku. The Four Father
with him is his older brother.

1416
01:36:25,173 --> 01:36:26,447
No kidding?

1417
01:36:35,693 --> 01:36:37,570
- Hey, Butters.
- Shit! Shit!

1418
01:36:37,973 --> 01:36:39,725
Now you got my name right.

1419
01:36:39,973 --> 01:36:41,850
I'm out.
I got to find some rounds.

1420
01:36:42,613 --> 01:36:44,092
I'll help you.

1421
01:36:44,613 --> 01:36:46,569
Never been shot before.

1422
01:36:50,493 --> 01:36:52,165
Take care of my son-in-law.

1423
01:37:37,133 --> 01:37:39,806
- You all right?
- No, I got my ass kicked again.

1424
01:37:40,053 --> 01:37:41,805
Shit, I'm out.

1425
01:37:42,093 --> 01:37:45,324
I hit the bastard. I thought
I missed him. Where'd they go?

1426
01:37:57,213 --> 01:37:58,282
Come on!

1427
01:38:00,253 --> 01:38:02,323
We got Door Number 1,
Number 2, or Number 3.

1428
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:07,843
- Looks like Number 2, Monty.
- Let's go.

1429
01:38:12,813 --> 01:38:15,486
What's behind Door Number 2?
Bingo.

1430
01:38:23,253 --> 01:38:24,732
Now you've done it.

1431
01:38:25,133 --> 01:38:26,532
Now he's really pissed.

1432
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:33,722
Son of a bitch will be a handful.

1433
01:38:38,133 --> 01:38:42,365
Since I met you, I've done some
hairy shit. But this won't happen.

1434
01:38:43,413 --> 01:38:45,165
I'm going to be a grandfather...

1435
01:38:45,493 --> 01:38:47,563
...and you and Lorna will have a baby.

1436
01:38:51,253 --> 01:38:54,051
He ain't worth dying for, Riggs.

1437
01:38:56,733 --> 01:38:58,291
Yeah, you're right.

1438
01:39:00,133 --> 01:39:02,806
If he gets away we can
track him down later...

1439
01:39:03,053 --> 01:39:04,850
...with a howitzer or something.

1440
01:39:05,053 --> 01:39:08,045
Your son-in-law's bleeding.
We should get him and go.

1441
01:39:08,693 --> 01:39:11,446
- Shit, it's raining.
- I'm too old for this shit.

1442
01:39:12,453 --> 01:39:14,205
Guy's too damn good.

1443
01:39:14,533 --> 01:39:17,411
How'd he do that thing with the gun?

1444
01:39:17,813 --> 01:39:21,522
He took my gun apart with one move.
How'd he do that?

1445
01:39:23,893 --> 01:39:24,882
How?

1446
01:39:33,173 --> 01:39:34,891
Yeah, okay.

1447
01:39:35,253 --> 01:39:36,242
Let's go ask him.

1448
01:43:18,093 --> 01:43:19,492
Are you up there?

1449
01:43:20,133 --> 01:43:21,361
Are you all right?

1450
01:43:56,693 --> 01:43:58,251
Where are you, Riggs?

1451
01:43:58,653 --> 01:44:00,644
Will it to me, Riggs!

1452
01:44:02,173 --> 01:44:03,401
Where are you?

1453
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:04,807
Will it to me!

1454
01:44:07,173 --> 01:44:08,731
Will me, Riggs.

1455
01:44:09,013 --> 01:44:11,129
You going to have a baby. Will me!

1456
01:44:11,373 --> 01:44:13,648
You son of a bitch.
God! Will me!

1457
01:44:19,573 --> 01:44:21,609
I hear you, Riggs.

1458
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:24,368
I got you! I'm coming!

1459
01:45:13,253 --> 01:45:15,164
I heard you, Riggs!

1460
01:45:16,493 --> 01:45:18,609
You willed me to it!

1461
01:45:18,933 --> 01:45:20,605
What took you so long?

1462
01:45:20,893 --> 01:45:23,691
What the hell do you mean?

1463
01:45:23,973 --> 01:45:27,204
I was knocked down over here!
I couldn't even get up!

1464
01:45:30,013 --> 01:45:31,048
Come back here!

1465
01:45:34,213 --> 01:45:35,851
Let's go home, man.

1466
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:38,085
Let's get out of here.

1467
01:45:43,893 --> 01:45:47,169
I haven't been here enough
lately, Vicky. I'm sorry.

1468
01:45:48,773 --> 01:45:51,606
I need to talk to you about Lorna.
Me and Lorna.

1469
01:45:54,533 --> 01:45:57,411
It's like this.
She wants to get married...

1470
01:45:58,973 --> 01:46:02,204
...and I love her.
I won't lie to you. I do.

1471
01:46:02,733 --> 01:46:05,122
And I want to make her happy.

1472
01:46:07,293 --> 01:46:09,409
I'm looking for help here, honey.

1473
01:46:11,293 --> 01:46:12,692
I don't know what to do.

1474
01:46:14,253 --> 01:46:16,323
Funny talking to you about
this stuff...

1475
01:46:21,053 --> 01:46:23,203
You want to get yourself shot?

1476
01:46:25,773 --> 01:46:27,729
What the hell are you doing here?

1477
01:46:28,293 --> 01:46:29,408
I was tailing you.

1478
01:46:30,773 --> 01:46:31,762
Sorry.

1479
01:46:34,893 --> 01:46:37,771
I'll leave you alone.
I guess you want to be alone.

1480
01:46:38,373 --> 01:46:39,806
I'd appreciate it.

1481
01:46:44,333 --> 01:46:46,688
When I was a kid I had a pet frog.

1482
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:47,889
What?

1483
01:46:49,013 --> 01:46:51,527
Give me a second.
Let me tell you this.

1484
01:46:51,893 --> 01:46:54,532
I had this pet frog, name was Froggy.

1485
01:46:54,933 --> 01:46:56,764
He was my best friend in the world.

1486
01:46:57,613 --> 01:47:00,173
I didn't have lots of friends.
In fact...

1487
01:47:00,693 --> 01:47:02,604
...I had no friends.

1488
01:47:05,373 --> 01:47:07,568
I used to kiss the frog too.

1489
01:47:07,813 --> 01:47:09,644
I thought maybe...

1490
01:47:10,213 --> 01:47:13,364
...it would turn into a princess
since I was a boy.

1491
01:47:13,733 --> 01:47:15,166
And it could be...

1492
01:47:15,493 --> 01:47:16,608
...my mother.

1493
01:47:17,573 --> 01:47:20,485
They told me that
she left or something.

1494
01:47:21,453 --> 01:47:23,808
And my father was no bargain.

1495
01:47:24,053 --> 01:47:25,566
And so, just the frog...

1496
01:47:25,973 --> 01:47:27,611
...Froggy, was my friend.

1497
01:47:27,893 --> 01:47:30,965
I loved him and took him
everywhere with me.

1498
01:47:31,213 --> 01:47:33,090
I was riding my bike one day...

1499
01:47:33,373 --> 01:47:35,443
...he jumped out of the box...

1500
01:47:35,733 --> 01:47:37,564
...and I ran him over
with the back tire.

1501
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,812
I killed him.

1502
01:47:40,293 --> 01:47:42,807
I was really heartbroken. Really.

1503
01:47:43,773 --> 01:47:46,333
He was my best friend,
the only thing I ever loved.

1504
01:47:47,773 --> 01:47:49,445
And then I met you...

1505
01:47:49,853 --> 01:47:51,047
...and Roger.

1506
01:47:51,413 --> 01:47:54,849
You looked after me
a lot more than you had to.

1507
01:47:55,453 --> 01:47:57,205
I'm terrible to you, Leo.

1508
01:47:57,573 --> 01:47:58,801
No, it's okay.

1509
01:47:59,293 --> 01:48:00,362
It's okay.

1510
01:48:00,773 --> 01:48:02,286
You're my family...

1511
01:48:02,813 --> 01:48:04,405
...and my friends.

1512
01:48:06,493 --> 01:48:09,565
You're not better friends than Froggy,
just different.

1513
01:48:16,093 --> 01:48:18,812
I just thought that
might be relevant.

1514
01:48:23,253 --> 01:48:25,209
Okay, I'll leave you alone now.

1515
01:48:28,533 --> 01:48:30,251
I got a funny f...

1516
01:48:30,893 --> 01:48:31,643
What's wrong?!

1517
01:48:32,013 --> 01:48:33,571
I'm having a baby.

1518
01:48:33,933 --> 01:48:35,082
Lorna beeped me.

1519
01:48:35,613 --> 01:48:37,649
Yes, it's Lorna.
She's having the baby.

1520
01:48:38,013 --> 01:48:39,890
- I'll get the car.
- I'll be behind you.

1521
01:48:47,653 --> 01:48:49,928
You picked a strange angel, honey.

1522
01:48:52,013 --> 01:48:53,651
But I got the message.

1523
01:48:54,893 --> 01:48:56,406
I got the message.

1524
01:49:02,413 --> 01:49:04,244
I'll always have this.

1525
01:49:04,813 --> 01:49:06,166
Always have you.

1526
01:49:06,813 --> 01:49:08,405
In here and here.

1527
01:49:09,933 --> 01:49:10,763
Thanks, honey.

1528
01:49:11,133 --> 01:49:13,010
I got to go. Bye.

1529
01:49:13,653 --> 01:49:15,291
I am not ready to have this baby!

1530
01:49:15,653 --> 01:49:17,928
You're as ready as you're going to be.

1531
01:49:18,293 --> 01:49:19,726
Fine! Just wheel me in.

1532
01:49:20,173 --> 01:49:22,209
My legs are staying closed!

1533
01:49:23,133 --> 01:49:24,043
Give me this!

1534
01:49:24,413 --> 01:49:25,766
Ma'am, let go!

1535
01:49:26,173 --> 01:49:29,006
I am a police officer!
And I am not ready!

1536
01:49:35,373 --> 01:49:36,567
Are you all right?

1537
01:49:36,933 --> 01:49:38,286
- Are you the husband?
- Yes.

1538
01:49:38,573 --> 01:49:39,688
Honey, are you all right?

1539
01:49:39,893 --> 01:49:40,803
No, I'm not.

1540
01:49:41,133 --> 01:49:42,885
I said I didn't want
to get married, but I do.

1541
01:49:43,213 --> 01:49:45,807
I want to be a wife
before I'm a mother.

1542
01:49:46,133 --> 01:49:47,282
I know you don't want to.

1543
01:49:49,293 --> 01:49:50,851
- You said "okay"?
- Yes, I did. Okay.

1544
01:49:51,253 --> 01:49:52,652
Let's do it.

1545
01:49:53,733 --> 01:49:55,007
He said okay.

1546
01:49:55,533 --> 01:49:57,683
- Congratulations.
- He said okay, Leo.

1547
01:49:58,133 --> 01:49:59,486
Oh, my God!

1548
01:49:59,853 --> 01:50:01,366
What's that smell?

1549
01:50:01,733 --> 01:50:04,645
I was on my way to the toilet
and she grabbed me.

1550
01:50:04,853 --> 01:50:07,526
- I'm so sorry.
- Have a nice baby!

1551
01:50:09,293 --> 01:50:10,612
I'm so sorry.

1552
01:50:13,453 --> 01:50:15,205
Will you marry me?

1553
01:50:18,533 --> 01:50:19,522
You bet I will.

1554
01:50:22,693 --> 01:50:23,569
Let's go.

1555
01:50:23,933 --> 01:50:26,242
I'm not going! Wait!

1556
01:50:27,853 --> 01:50:29,002
- Get a minister.
- Now?

1557
01:50:29,213 --> 01:50:32,046
Now. We're getting married.
Here comes another one.

1558
01:50:32,293 --> 01:50:33,282
We need a license...

1559
01:50:33,533 --> 01:50:35,524
I want to hear it
before the baby comes!

1560
01:50:35,733 --> 01:50:36,643
It's coming now.

1561
01:50:37,013 --> 01:50:39,527
Listen, I am getting married
or there is no baby.

1562
01:50:39,813 --> 01:50:42,202
This could be an aspect
of a transition phase.

1563
01:50:42,453 --> 01:50:45,251
This is no goddamn aspect
of a transition phase!

1564
01:50:45,613 --> 01:50:47,251
Honey, everybody, calm down.

1565
01:50:47,613 --> 01:50:49,092
Calm down. Okay?

1566
01:50:49,453 --> 01:50:51,728
Get a priest, minister, anything.

1567
01:50:52,053 --> 01:50:54,362
Go get a priest!
Goddamn it, Leo!

1568
01:50:54,733 --> 01:50:56,325
I got it. Okay.

1569
01:50:56,653 --> 01:50:58,530
Pant, pant, blow.
Remember Lamaze class?

1570
01:50:58,813 --> 01:51:00,451
Pant, blow. Come on!

1571
01:51:02,533 --> 01:51:04,012
But I want to say "I do."

1572
01:51:04,333 --> 01:51:06,005
Here he is!

1573
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:07,561
This is Rabbi Gelb.

1574
01:51:07,853 --> 01:51:08,763
A rabbi?

1575
01:51:09,013 --> 01:51:10,366
You said anything.

1576
01:51:10,733 --> 01:51:11,882
He'll do.

1577
01:51:12,133 --> 01:51:13,612
For what I'll do?

1578
01:51:13,853 --> 01:51:16,083
We'd like you to marry us.
Please.

1579
01:51:16,373 --> 01:51:17,806
- You're Jewish?
- Not necessarily.

1580
01:51:18,133 --> 01:51:19,327
- You got a license?
- No.

1581
01:51:19,613 --> 01:51:21,285
Please don't go!

1582
01:51:21,933 --> 01:51:24,493
She needs to hear the words
before the baby comes.

1583
01:51:24,773 --> 01:51:28,209
Are you both serious?
I don't have time for hijinks.

1584
01:51:28,493 --> 01:51:29,721
We're very serious.

1585
01:51:30,053 --> 01:51:31,884
I could do it.
It wouldn't be official.

1586
01:51:32,173 --> 01:51:33,652
I just want to hear the words.

1587
01:51:34,053 --> 01:51:35,930
What the hell! Your names?

1588
01:51:36,293 --> 01:51:37,646
I'm Martin and this is Lorna.

1589
01:51:38,093 --> 01:51:39,492
Martin and Lorna.

1590
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:42,966
What am I doing?
How do the <i>goyim</i> do this?

1591
01:51:44,293 --> 01:51:46,090
Dearly beloved!

1592
01:51:46,373 --> 01:51:50,844
Dearly beloved,
marriage is a spiritual union...

1593
01:51:52,013 --> 01:51:54,846
Faster!
She's heading for the home stretch.

1594
01:51:55,213 --> 01:51:57,329
Martin, will you take
Lorna to be your wife?

1595
01:51:57,613 --> 01:52:00,889
Will you honor, love, etc...

1596
01:52:01,133 --> 01:52:03,089
...till death do you part?
- I will.

1597
01:52:03,293 --> 01:52:05,887
Lorna, will you take Martin
to be your husband?

1598
01:52:06,253 --> 01:52:08,721
- I do.
- The same thing.

1599
01:52:08,933 --> 01:52:10,082
I pronounce you man and wife.

1600
01:52:10,373 --> 01:52:12,443
You may kiss the bride.
You already did.

1601
01:52:12,733 --> 01:52:14,530
- Let's go.
- No, wait!

1602
01:52:14,813 --> 01:52:16,087
Hold it!

1603
01:52:16,453 --> 01:52:17,522
What is it?

1604
01:52:17,933 --> 01:52:20,083
Let me have this glass!

1605
01:52:20,413 --> 01:52:23,052
No, goddamn it!
What are you doing?!

1606
01:52:23,573 --> 01:52:26,406
Talk to the hand!
I'll be right back.

1607
01:52:26,693 --> 01:52:29,685
You know how long it took me
to fill that thing? All day!

1608
01:52:29,933 --> 01:52:32,686
This is unsanitary.
What is this?

1609
01:52:33,093 --> 01:52:34,731
- Break the glass.
- I'll get piss on my shoes!

1610
01:52:35,453 --> 01:52:36,727
You got to do this!

1611
01:52:37,493 --> 01:52:38,926
<i>Mazel tov</i>!

1612
01:52:41,133 --> 01:52:43,089
Come back here,
you little son of a bitch!

1613
01:52:43,413 --> 01:52:44,562
Pant, pant, blow.

1614
01:52:44,853 --> 01:52:46,127
Leo, please.

1615
01:52:47,733 --> 01:52:50,805
Your work is over here.
I think someone else needs you.

1616
01:52:55,933 --> 01:52:57,810
Good luck, Lorna, Riggs.

1617
01:53:01,373 --> 01:53:02,567
Thanks a lot.

1618
01:53:07,213 --> 01:53:08,771
Stick around.
Meet the kid.

1619
01:53:09,013 --> 01:53:11,083
Good luck, Lorna!

1620
01:53:16,773 --> 01:53:18,764
Here it comes.

1621
01:53:20,813 --> 01:53:22,007
Here he is.

1622
01:53:22,573 --> 01:53:25,610
He's looking right at you.
He knows it's you.

1623
01:53:30,253 --> 01:53:31,891
Rog, look what I found.

1624
01:53:32,493 --> 01:53:34,848
- Look at that.
- What a beauty!

1625
01:53:35,533 --> 01:53:37,251
Look at those eyes!

1626
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:40,208
- He looks like his mother.
- Yes, he does.

1627
01:53:40,533 --> 01:53:41,488
Murtaugh!

1628
01:53:44,253 --> 01:53:45,572
No, Butters!

1629
01:53:46,013 --> 01:53:47,844
Butters' baby.
Better not be Murtaugh.

1630
01:53:48,173 --> 01:53:49,606
It's Butters.

1631
01:53:51,093 --> 01:53:52,606
Look at that baby.

1632
01:53:53,333 --> 01:53:54,812
Look at the hair.

1633
01:53:55,773 --> 01:53:57,411
That's my baby!

1634
01:53:58,013 --> 01:54:00,527
Look at her. You're so cute.
Look at you!

1635
01:54:00,773 --> 01:54:03,333
27 people, nobody thought
of bringing a camera?

1636
01:54:03,573 --> 01:54:05,086
Leo, your plastic's flaccid.

1637
01:54:05,453 --> 01:54:08,684
These machines wreck your plastic,
then give you the camera.

1638
01:54:09,053 --> 01:54:11,203
The camera doesn't work.
They're trying to...

1639
01:54:15,573 --> 01:54:16,926
What are you doing here?

1640
01:54:17,693 --> 01:54:19,126
Look at these two babies.

1641
01:54:19,373 --> 01:54:21,409
A little something from the squad.

1642
01:54:24,013 --> 01:54:26,322
- Give back the captain badges.
- Why?

1643
01:54:26,573 --> 01:54:29,724
Congratulations, you're sergeants again.
The city's self-insured.

1644
01:54:30,013 --> 01:54:31,924
I thought they'd make us president.

1645
01:54:33,053 --> 01:54:35,248
By the way, Grandpa,
you owe the chief one.

1646
01:54:35,573 --> 01:54:36,847
He went to the INS...

1647
01:54:37,053 --> 01:54:39,487
...and they're giving asylum
to the Hongs.

1648
01:54:39,933 --> 01:54:40,922
All right!

1649
01:54:42,653 --> 01:54:44,211
We're going to take a picture.

1650
01:54:48,373 --> 01:54:50,489
Squeeze together.
Candy stripers out.

1651
01:54:50,813 --> 01:54:52,087
Out! Okay. Out!

1652
01:54:52,813 --> 01:54:54,929
I can't.
There's not enough room.

1653
01:54:56,813 --> 01:54:58,485
You got to back up.

1654
01:54:59,253 --> 01:55:00,288
I'm taking big steps!

1655
01:55:00,613 --> 01:55:02,012
Get this guy to take it.

1656
01:55:02,293 --> 01:55:04,807
Doc, can you take a picture
of all of us?

1657
01:55:07,893 --> 01:55:10,009
It's my best man, after all.

1658
01:55:10,373 --> 01:55:11,852
Get my grandbaby in it too.

1659
01:55:12,133 --> 01:55:13,168
Are you all friends?

1660
01:55:13,493 --> 01:55:16,326
No. We're family!

1661
01:55:16,613 --> 01:55:17,409
Okay, on 3.

1662
01:55:17,693 --> 01:55:19,604
One, two, three!
