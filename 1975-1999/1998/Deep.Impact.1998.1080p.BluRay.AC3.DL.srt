1
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,965
1.567 makes it eight
degrees north.

2
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,677
Altair, Alpha Centauri and Sirius.

3
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,387
Matt Shepherd?

4
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,182
It's just a party, and he asked me.

5
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,893
- He's really nice.
- Yeah, to you, maybe.

6
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,811
You guys getting some
good work done over here?

7
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,062
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

8
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,231
Yeah, yeah. Sounds like it.

9
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,275
What's the bright one?

10
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,195
Mizar. It's a double star.

11
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,363
Good. The one next to it?

12
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,366
- Alcor.
- Good, Biederman.

13
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,452
And the one next to that?

14
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,749
- I don't know.
- It's Megrez.

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,752
- I don't think so.
- Well, you just said you didn't know.

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,671
Well, it's not Megrez.
It's something else.

17
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,381
Look.

18
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,511
It's south, about 10 degrees.

19
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,266
It's probably a satellite.

20
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,727
Let's take another picture.
We'll send it to Dr. Wolf.

21
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,103
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,023
- It's Megrez.
- It's not Megrez.

23
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,317
- It is.
- It's not.

24
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,823
It is.

25
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,842
Well, hello there, little fella.

26
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,719
Do I know you?

27
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,223
Where are you going in such a hurry?

28
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,520
And there.

29
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,145
Come on.

30
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,647
Damn it.

31
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,537
Biederman.

32
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,811
Come on, you miserable piece of crap.

33
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,793
Come on, come on.

34
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,683
You have reached the Department
of Planetary Sciences.

35
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,772
If you know the extension of
the person you're calling...

36
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,107
Jesus!

37
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,692
Damn it!

38
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,674
News relating to the recall of
American troops from abroad.

39
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,094
Tragedy struck today
as a charter aircraft

40
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,764
carrying an Army unit returning from
duty in Japan crashed this morning...

41
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,851
The White House press office says
Secretary of the Treasury Rittenhouse

42
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,270
is resigning because his wife is sick.

43
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,355
Sick, my ass.

44
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,273
So, who passed
Rittenhouse the hemlock?

45
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,693
AFL-CIO wanted him off the
Council of Economic Advisers

46
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,278
for not supporting the pension bill,

47
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,405
and the President's going
to need Labor next fall.

48
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,826
And State's still fuming about the
Trade Office screw-up at the G8.

49
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,495
Pentagon is unhappy with his
readiness reduction proposals.

50
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,499
- Greenspan dislikes him.
- Christ! Who didn't this guy piss off?

51
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,294
- No wonder the wife's sick.
- She's not sick. She's a drunk.

52
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,633
How do you know that?

53
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,052
Mike Woodward over at Treasury.

54
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,808
Mrs. Rittenhouse started
drinking a couple of years ago

55
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,893
when her husband had
a series of affairs.

56
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,689
Stepped it up last summer after
their son died of leukemia.

57
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,233
You wanna do something on
"the price that wives pay"?

58
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,985
- What else?
- Mike Woodward?

59
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,654
- Wife, three kids?
- He's been after me for months,

60
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,408
so I threw him a breakfast and
hit him up about Rittenhouse.

61
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,951
Bob Campbell's leaving.

62
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,495
So at midnight Saturday,
anchor shift's opening up.

63
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,998
Why would I wanna give up the White
House for a graveyard weekend?

64
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,417
No, no, no. Not for you. For me.

65
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,002
- No.
- Beth.

66
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,504
We'll talk about this later. Very calm.

67
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,798
The President will be back
from Camp David tomorrow.

68
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,466
- Business news, lra?
- Beth.

69
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,969
You know what? Just keep
working on Rittenhouse.

70
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,221
Maybe Mike's available for dinner.

71
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,850
You know, do the usual research,
background information.

72
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,520
- I'll talk to you about it after lunch.
- Okay. That's it!

73
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,899
Beth, wait.

74
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,944
- Listen, Beth, what if it wasn't...
- God, Jenny.

75
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,405
- ...permanent?
- Look, honey, this is how it works.

76
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,742
You've done two years of research.
Now do three as a segment producer,

77
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,869
five on-air doing domestic features,

78
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,872
another two in some
cholera-ridden hellhole,

79
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,207
and then, you know what?

80
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,542
I'll quit if they don't give
you a weekend anchor shot.

81
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,586
Hello, Caitlin, there you are.

82
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,339
Are you protecting me or
just holding me back?

83
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,798
- Yes.
- Okay.

84
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:13,302
Rittenhouse tape and text on
my desk by 4:00 tomorrow.

85
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,845
- Yes.
- Then we'll drop in the reverses

86
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,680
- for the five.
- Okay.

87
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,684
So at this moment right now...

88
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,687
Thank you. The pretty little girls
are walking down the aisle.

89
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,064
They're spreading flowers.

90
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,149
- The twins, what are their names?
- Emma and Susanna.

91
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,777
They're walking down the aisles
and they're dropping rose petals,

92
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,363
- and everyone's smiling at them.
- Mother, is this really such a good idea?

93
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,031
- Now she's walking down the aisle. Yes.
- Okay.

94
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:38,285
And she stands beside him. And the
priest says, "Dearly beloved..."

95
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,579
- Judge.
- And the judge says...

96
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,875
...sickness and health... "Do
you, Jason Lerner, take..."

97
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,962
"...Chlorine Whatchamacallit?"

98
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,463
- Mom!
- What?

99
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,340
- Chloe.
- What did I say?

100
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,760
You said... You said,
"Chlorine." Her name's Chloe.

101
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,391
- Well, it's still a terrible name.
- Yeah.

102
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,770
And Jason says, "Lie, lie, lie,
lie, till death do us part."

103
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,064
And she says, "Yes,"
and he says, "Yes,"

104
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,317
and it's kissy, kissy,
kissy and congratulations.

105
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,536
Jenny, you now have a new stepmother
who is two years older than you.

106
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,498
Check.

107
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,961
Well, anyway, as much as I would like to
stay here and get silly with you, Mom,

108
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,047
- I can't. I gotta go.
- I know, I know, I know.

109
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,802
I'm sorry about this.

110
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,722
We'll get over it. I love you.

111
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,267
I love you, too.

112
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,730
Be good.

113
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,364
I was with the secretary since
he's been governor of Connecticut.

114
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,575
Came to Washington with him.

115
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,995
I moved here because I was
dedicated to his career.

116
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,747
I trusted the man.

117
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,458
And then he fucked me.

118
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,127
- He what?
- No, I didn't have sex with him.

119
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,173
I should say, I didn't have sex
with him, but somebody sure did.

120
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,134
It was about to come
out, so he resigned.

121
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,679
But because I was hired from
outside the government pool,

122
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,767
I don't get conveyed to the next
secretary, so now I'm out a job.

123
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,604
Because he couldn't keep
his hands off women.

124
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,984
- Do you have proof?
- He thinks he was being so clever.

125
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,529
He had a private phone line
installed in his office.

126
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,531
Nobody else could answer it.

127
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,285
I picked it up once, said
hello, and it's nobody home.

128
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,581
It rings, he shuts the door.
Why not hang a sign?

129
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,626
Do you have a name?

130
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,754
This is what I get for
talking to the press.

131
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm selling my soul right now. I can feel it.
I can feel it.

132
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,553
I name a name and get
someone into trouble.

133
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,222
So you do have a name.

134
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,600
Just a first name. Oh, my
God, I'm going to say it.

135
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,143
Ellie.

136
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,146
Ellie? Nothing else?

137
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,483
I think the President
knows about it, too.

138
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,736
Overheard the secretary
talking to him about her.

139
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,988
Isn't Washington sick?

140
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,697
Hi.

141
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,199
How you doing?

142
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,034
Can I help you?

143
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,705
Well, actually, we're looking for your mom.
Is she around?

144
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,124
My mom's sick. She's not here.

145
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,253
Gosh, I love boats. Are
you going on a trip?

146
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,713
Yeah.

147
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,591
That's exciting. Looks like a...

148
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,968
Like a long trip, huh?

149
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,472
So listen, do you know
where you're going?

150
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,765
She's going back to the house.

151
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,893
Hey. You wanna stop that?

152
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,895
Lily, please?

153
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,272
Lily, that's a pretty name.

154
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,192
Lily, do as I say.

155
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,818
Go on. I'll be right there.

156
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,154
If we could just get a
minute of your time.

157
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,780
What do you want from me?

158
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,325
Well, we'd like to talk
about your resignation.

159
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,744
My wife is sick. She's in the hospital.

160
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,330
That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.

161
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:55,417
We could talk about your wife, or
we could just talk about Ellie.

162
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,265
Turn the camera off.

163
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,935
If you wanna talk to me, turn it off.

164
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,228
Cut it.

165
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,815
- We know everything.
- Nobody knows everything.

166
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,528
Well, we know about the
secret phone lines

167
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,322
and the whispered calls
to the President.

168
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,867
And about a secretary of the Treasury
who's kept his entire department

169
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,663
in the dark about what he's
really doing, about a cover story

170
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,540
about his resignation
that just fell through.

171
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,042
I mean, sir, you want me to go on?

172
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,962
And you're just gonna break it?

173
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,881
Well, that's what we do for a living.

174
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,800
Well, congratulations.

175
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,262
You now have the biggest
story in history.

176
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,972
Good luck to you.

177
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,058
Personally, I think it's a
mistake to run the story,

178
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,102
but, hey, what the hell?

179
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,645
Why not?

180
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,983
What difference does
anything make anymore?

181
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,823
Look.

182
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,159
I know you're just a reporter,

183
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,329
but you used to be a person, right?

184
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,713
I wanted to be with my family.

185
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,509
Can you understand that?

186
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,908
Okay, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse resigns

187
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,411
because of a mistress named Ellie.

188
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,705
Biggest story in history?

189
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,416
What an ego.

190
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,252
Now, if it was the President...

191
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,089
Okay, the President has
a mistress named Ellie,

192
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,008
and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

193
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:12,888
and takes the fall and resigns, and
the President buys him a yacht?

194
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,224
Son of a bitch!

195
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,359
Shit. Shit.

196
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,278
What? Okay, okay!

197
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,365
God. No, God.

198
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,638
FBI. if you would please, ma'am?

199
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,264
- What do I do with the car?
- We'll take care of the car.

200
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,808
Just step back to my car.

201
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,935
- Get her car here.
- Got it.

202
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,110
Let's go.

203
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,875
Would you come this way, please?

204
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,433
Morton Entrekin, Ms. Lerner.

205
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,311
I'm expected back at MSNBC at 6:00,

206
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,189
and I think I should be there.

207
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,775
People knew about the
Manhattan Project, you know,

208
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,861
and they kept it a secret.

209
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,865
That was just the creation
of the atom bomb.

210
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,811
Ms. Lerner? Tom Beck.

211
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,522
I understand you've come
into some information.

212
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,275
Ms. Lerner was just expressing
her lack of enthusiasm

213
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,197
for matters of national security where
journalistic competitiveness is at stake.

214
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:40,494
Mr. President, I'm not interested in
using Ellie to further my career.

215
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,954
What do you know about E.L.E.?

216
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,211
I know you should have picked a
better cover story than a sick wife.

217
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,213
See? What'd I tell you?

218
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,134
We'd always thought the
deadline for going public

219
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,803
was the publication of the budget,

220
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,472
since we've spent more
money than we can hide.

221
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,141
But the budget comes out in two weeks.

222
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,312
I don't suppose I could convince
you to sit on this for two weeks.

223
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,358
No such thing as two weeks
in the news business.

224
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,904
And I can't appeal to your sense of
what's in the nation's best interest.

225
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:20,200
Well, I always thought the truth
was in the nation's best interest.

226
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,579
You wanna hold her?

227
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,752
What if we go public in 48 hours?
Now, that's doable, isn't it?

228
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,129
That would be very
difficult, Mr. President.

229
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,256
Morton,

230
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,760
if she knows, how long can it be before
CNN or The Post breaks the story?

231
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,140
Now, this was never gonna be a secret
as long as you wanted it to be.

232
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,060
Give us two days, Ms. Lerner.

233
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,564
You'll get second-row center at
the White House press conference.

234
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,816
Now, from what I know of your
career, that's a promotion.

235
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,902
- I want exclusivity.
- Now, listen, young lady,

236
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,114
this is a presidential favor.

237
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,367
I'm letting you go because I
don't want another headache,

238
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,705
and I'm trusting you because I know
what this can do for your career.

239
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,875
It might seem that we have each other
over the same barrel, Ms. Lerner,

240
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,127
but it just seems that way.

241
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,135
- I want the...
- "Want"?

242
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,264
May I?

243
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,350
May I have the first question?

244
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,146
I'll see you Tuesday, Ms. Lerner.

245
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,338
Come on. Come on, come on.

246
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,352
E-L-E, E-L-E.

247
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,436
E.

248
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,402
Paleontology.

249
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,323
Paleontology. What does paleontology
have to do with anything?

250
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Come on. Come on, come on.

251
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,264
- Hey!
- Hey.

252
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,433
- Look who's working late.
- Yep.

253
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,728
- How's Rittenhouse going?
- No sign of the wife yet.

254
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,356
- Is she missing?
- No. We're still working on it.

255
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,108
- We'll get there.
- I know. it's a dull story.

256
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,987
I promise you, next time we'll
get you something more exciting.

257
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,279
Great.

258
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,198
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

259
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:09,494
- Wanna come to dinner with us?
- I can't, I can't. I got... l have plans.

260
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,080
Okay. Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

261
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,883
- This is your table.
- Thank you.

262
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,264
Here she is.

263
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,266
Jenny.

264
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,021
Hi, Chloe.

265
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,439
Would you like some
champagne, miss?

266
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,107
Martini. Up.

267
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,608
Big.

268
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,652
Good.

269
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,282
I missed you. I mean, we
missed you yesterday.

270
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,618
I must say, I'm...

271
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,414
I'm disturbed that you
didn't come to our wedding.

272
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,417
- Jason, you promised.
- I know I promised,

273
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,420
but it was a beautiful
event and I missed her.

274
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,174
You should've been there. The twins,
they were running around like mad

275
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,177
and throwing flowers and...
it was wonderful.

276
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,054
Especially Emma. You
know, the little one?

277
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,513
She loves you.

278
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,765
- She adores you.
- It was beautiful.

279
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,476
- Yes. She missed you, too.
- All right.

280
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,146
This is from us, for you.

281
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,320
Are you not going to open it?

282
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,173
I knew she wouldn't like...

283
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,218
You can exchange them
if you don't like them.

284
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,597
Jenny, I know this is hard. I
just want you to be happy.

285
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,848
Happy.

286
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:58,812
Well, I would like to propose
a toast to happiness

287
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,480
and to...

288
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,703
Well, are we going to
have an evening or not?

289
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,081
Jenny, I know that you hate me.

290
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,960
I know that you have terrible
things that you wanna say to me.

291
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,838
You have to get over it. Life goes on.

292
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,799
Life goes on, okay.

293
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,428
What's so funny?

294
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,721
Life...

295
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,434
We'll see.

296
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,604
What's so funny about "life goes on"?

297
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,482
What? Life going on?

298
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,651
I don't think it's so
funny that life goes on.

299
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,071
Dad, you need to get
back together with Mom,

300
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,660
because she's all alone in the world
and she needs you right now, okay?

301
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,247
Jenny,

302
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,167
- I just got married.
- I know, I know, and I'm sorry.

303
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,669
Chloe, this has nothing to do with you.

304
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,131
Well, it has to do something
for me, for Christ's sake.

305
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,008
This is insane.

306
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,719
I have to apologize for my daughter.

307
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,013
Listen, it's not your fault.

308
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,348
All right, I have to go.

309
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,226
I know you think I'm a bad person.
I'm really not.

310
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,895
And I don't hate you.

311
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,439
I gotta...I just... I gotta go.

312
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,789
- Hi, Jane. How are you?
- How are you?

313
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,750
Yeah, I'm coming!

314
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,381
She's done exactly what
we want her to do.

315
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,759
She signed the release, and
so you have no problem.

316
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,637
Because for her, it does... Excuse me.

317
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,223
- Jenny.
- Hey! How are you?

318
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,351
- What are you doing here?
- Excuse me. Sorry.

319
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,061
Did Stuart send you here
without telling me?

320
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,896
No, Beth. I was gonna talk to you...

321
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,732
You know what, if Stuart thinks he can
push me out of the White House...

322
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,651
Ms. Lerner. Hi, Beth.

323
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,820
Right this way. I've got
you right down here.

324
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,995
Excuse me, please.

325
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,748
Okay.

326
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:28,002
He'll find you for the first question.
Then you're on your own.

327
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,713
Hey. How are you? Yeah.

328
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,758
Ladies and gentlemen.

329
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,010
Ladies and gentleman, please.

330
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,139
The President will begin
by addressing the nation.

331
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,268
Please hold your questions until
he's finished his remarks.

332
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,896
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President of the United States.

333
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:51,693
Hello, everybody.

334
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,860
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

335
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,029
Ten seconds, Mr. President.

336
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,449
Five, four...

337
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,037
Good evening.

338
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,250
A few minutes ago, the United States'
ambassadors to every country

339
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,127
in the world told the
leaders of those nations

340
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,379
what I am about to tell you.

341
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,257
It's a bit complicated, so
it will take some time.

342
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,885
So I hope you will bear with
me, hear what I have to say.

343
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,514
A little over a year ago,

344
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,810
two American astronomers,
Marcus Wolf and Leo Biederman,

345
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,771
working on a mountaintop in Arizona...

346
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,815
Nobody say anything.

347
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,152
...saw something in the night sky
that caused them great concern.

348
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,445
A comet.

349
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,741
But the comet was... Well,

350
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:43,911
there was a remote possibility
that the comet was on a path

351
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,498
that could bring it into
direct contact with the Earth.

352
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,755
Now, we get hit all the
time by rocks and meteors.

353
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,342
Some of them the size of cars,
some no bigger than your hand.

354
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,720
But the comet we discovered
is the size of New York City,

355
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,098
from the north side of
Central Park to the Battery.

356
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,392
About 7 miles long.

357
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,853
Put another way,

358
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,981
this comet is larger than Mount Everest.

359
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,860
It weighs 500 billion tons.

360
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,112
Now, chances are that this
thing will miss us...

361
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,866
Astrophysicists, geologists
and climatologists.

362
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,743
Where the hell is Science?

363
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,829
Paris, London, Tokyo, Tel Aviv.
I want it everywhere.

364
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,331
That guy at Berkeley, did
Hale-Bopp stand-ups?

365
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,625
And graphics? I need graphics!

366
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,127
Comets begin far out in space.

367
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,381
They're what's left over from the
creation of the solar system

368
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,509
after the planets were formed
billions of years ago.

369
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,386
Now, these chunks of space debris

370
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,222
are in an elongated
orbit around our sun.

371
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,308
But every now and then,
one of them gets bumped,

372
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:52,271
sort of like a billiard ball on a pool table,
and is knocked into a different orbit.

373
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,733
Now, if this comet continues
on its path around the sun

374
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,777
and keeps its present course,

375
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,905
sometime on August 16,
roughly a year from now,

376
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,825
there's a chance that
we might have impact.

377
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,413
So for the past eight months,
the United States and Russia

378
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:12,166
have been building the largest
spaceship ever constructed.

379
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,128
It's being built in
orbit around the Earth,

380
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,338
and we call it the Messiah.

381
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,758
And right now, a team of American
astronauts and one Russian

382
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,844
are at Cape Canaveral in Florida.

383
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,429
In two months,

384
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,349
they will leave on the shuttle
Atlantis to board the Messiah.

385
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,727
This is the crew that
will stop the comet.

386
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,690
I'd like the world to meet
some extraordinary people.

387
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,276
First is Mission
Commander Oren Monash.

388
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,112
Commander, would you
introduce us to your team?

389
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,197
I would be honored, sir.

390
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,533
Pilot, Andrea Baker.

391
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,327
Medical Officer Gus Partenza.

392
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:52,832
From Russia, Nuclear Specialist
Colonel Mikhail Tulchinsky.

393
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,126
Navigator Mark Simon,

394
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,837
and Rendezvous Pilot Spurgeon Tanner.

395
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,798
- Hello, Mr. President.
- Hello, Mr. President.

396
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:04,218
Captain Tanner, you flew
six shuttle missions.

397
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,138
You were the last man to walk
on the moon, weren't you, sir?

398
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,389
Yes, sir,

399
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,641
but Oren here will be doing
most of the flying on this one.

400
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,895
I'll just be taking us
down to the comet surface.

401
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,689
Well, it's good to know we're going
to have your kind of experience

402
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,483
- up there, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.

403
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,402
Godspeed to you all.
We're counting on you.

404
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,070
Thank you, sir.

405
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,990
Got Beijing, Rome, Sao
Paulo, Cairo, Berlin.

406
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,659
Does anyone know how big the one
was that killed all the dinosaurs?

407
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,037
Something majestic, mysterious,
with a fanfare for the intro

408
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,164
and a theme to the longer promos.

409
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,416
- It's hitting the goddamn Earth?
- That's what he's saying.

410
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:39,295
- Bring that up again.
- He'll scare the shit out of everybody.

411
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,423
Our society will continue as normal.

412
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,634
Work will go on.

413
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,053
You will pay your bills.

414
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,974
There will be no hoarding.

415
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:57,730
There will be no sudden profiteering.
I'm freezing all wages, all prices.

416
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,567
What a bottle of water
cost you yesterday,

417
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,445
it will cost you tomorrow.

418
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,490
Now I'll take a few questions.

419
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,951
Ms. Lerner?

420
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,955
Jenny Lerner, MSNBC.

421
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,832
- Jenny Lerner?
- Son of a bitch.

422
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,044
Mr. President,

423
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,838
why wasn't this
announcement made sooner?

424
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,299
Well, until we knew we
could build the rocket

425
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,593
and the comet could be intercepted,

426
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:30,304
we saw no reason to alarm the planet.

427
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,017
Do you have another
question, Ms. Lerner?

428
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,185
Yeah.

429
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,106
Is there a connection
between the comet

430
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,234
and the recall of American
troops from abroad?

431
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,194
Our fighting men and
women are coming home

432
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,614
because we felt it prudent, in light
of domestic security concerns,

433
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,740
to have them available.

434
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,034
Although I certainly hope
we don't need to use them.

435
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,202
Next question.

436
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:58,541
Actually, Mr. President, if...
Just one final question, sir.

437
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,963
MSNBC has learned that
Secretary Rittenhouse

438
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,800
did not leave for the reasons
announced by your administration.

439
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,303
In fact, isn't it true, sir,

440
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,973
that not everyone in your
administration is convinced

441
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,309
that the Messiah will save us?

442
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,654
Secretary Rittenhouse served his
country with full devotion.

443
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,532
He resigned for personal reasons.

444
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:35,036
Now, I can promise you this,
Ms. Lerner, all of you,

445
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,955
everyone in this room and
everyone listening to my voice,

446
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,916
that at some point over
the next 10 months,

447
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,254
all of us will entertain our
worst fears and concerns.

448
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,883
But I can also promise you this.

449
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,469
Life will go on.

450
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,889
We will prevail.

451
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,974
Mr. President! Please!

452
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,684
- Sally.
- Sir! Sir.

453
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,144
What is the comet's name?

454
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,147
The two scientists who found the
comet were killed in a car crash

455
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,400
while racing from their
observatory to alert the world.

456
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,570
So we named it for
them, Wolf-Biederman.

457
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,032
Leo Biederman. They said it again.

458
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,158
Leo, is he talking about you?

459
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,826
- He is, isn't he?
- I'm trying to listen.

460
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,953
Why were the Russians brought
into the construction phase...

461
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:21,332
- Honey, can you get that, please?
- Janie, get the door.

462
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,460
Well, we have the technology
to build the ship.

463
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,254
They have the technology to make it go.

464
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,091
There's someone at the
door for you, Leo.

465
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,846
You've been watching live
coverage of President Tom Beck.

466
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,184
- I can't believe this. This is so weird.
- Dr. Wolf from Astronomy Club?

467
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,895
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I think it's really neat.

468
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,690
Nobody on our block discovered
the world was gonna end before.

469
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,859
He's still very much alive.
He's still alive, everyone!

470
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,779
He's right here, and
he's still alive. Okay?

471
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,156
Hey, Leo, cool.

472
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,827
As far as we know, what happened
was that Dr. Wolf saw the comet

473
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,288
in my photograph, so he
shared the discovery with me.

474
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,541
And then he was killed in that crash

475
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,127
and everything got mixed
up in Washington,

476
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,212
so the President thought
I was dead, too.

477
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,965
- Leo!
- Jasmine.

478
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,177
How does it feel having your name on it?

479
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,556
I don't want anyone to think that
I'm trying to take something away

480
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,308
from Dr. Wolf, because I'm not.

481
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,728
But it's kind of cool.

482
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,313
Jason.

483
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,358
You know,

484
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:33,654
you're gonna have sex a lot more
now than anyone else in our class.

485
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,449
Don't listen. Don't.

486
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,413
Really?

487
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:47,293
Thank you for your sexual insight, Mr. Thurman.
You can sit down now.

488
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,879
Famous people always
get sex, Mr. Perry.

489
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,965
That's the main reason
it's good to be famous.

490
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,684
Fruit, reactor. Bottle, rocket. Okay?

491
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,103
- A nuclear reactor in space?
- Yes.

492
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,521
- Isn't that dangerous?
- No, no, no.

493
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,982
This is all Russian
design, Russian science.

494
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,443
The same people who
designed Chernobyl.

495
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,404
- Chernobyl?
- Chernobyl almost worked.

496
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,366
So what happens after
you plant the bomb?

497
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,618
Well, we have seven hours.

498
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,120
We're gonna put bombs inside the comet.
Let me follow these two.

499
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,915
- I don't trust that combination.
- Okay. Right, after seven hours,

500
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,460
the 14-hour rotational cycle
of the comet, right, spins.

501
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,463
We're gonna get married. God
knows I want to marry you.

502
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,549
But the day I get back, the last thing
I'm gonna do is step inside of a church.

503
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,842
I don't do churches well.

504
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,636
'Cause there's only seven
hours of darkness.

505
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,971
Then the sun starts hitting the surface
of the planet and it causes...

506
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,431
These are your orders.

507
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:45,601
Upon first entering Earth's atmosphere,

508
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,855
proceed immediately up the
exterior of the mother ship.

509
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,857
When the sun hits the surface,

510
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,735
there's gonna be explosive out-gassings
that are very dangerous...

511
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,904
- Gus, he's seven.
- Brittany.

512
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,908
You boys were, what, four and
six when I went to the moon?

513
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,163
Now, you saw me go into space
seven times, didn't you?

514
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,666
I came back every time, didn't I?

515
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:09,917
Yeah.

516
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,629
Your mother and I used to play a
game when she was still alive.

517
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,381
Now, the game was,

518
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,467
if there was a chance I
might not be coming back,

519
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,345
she wouldn't say it and
I wouldn't say it.

520
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,471
Okay?

521
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,848
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

522
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,182
- Hey, Fish.
- Hey, Mitch.

523
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,352
- How about a beer?
- You remember my boys, don't you?

524
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,354
- This is Steve and Dwight.
- Of course I do.

525
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,898
- Gentlemen, welcome to Houston.
- Thank you.

526
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,734
Let me steal your old man for a second.

527
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,571
- Can I take your picture, please?
- Okay.

528
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,739
Thank you.

529
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,327
So, what do you think of the crew?

530
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,915
Heroes all. That's the finest group I
ever had the privilege of working with.

531
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,293
Yeah, yeah. Off the record?

532
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,380
Well, they've been trained in
ways I'll never understand.

533
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,383
They're smarter and in better shape
than we ever were in the old days.

534
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,345
Sober, serious. I guess I'd be a
little happier about this whole thing

535
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,807
if I thought that any of
them were as scared as I am.

536
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,059
Well, they're not scared of dying.

537
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,937
They're just scared
of looking bad on TV.

538
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,733
Now, look, I wish I'd been to the moon.

539
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,943
I got respect for everybody
who's gone to the moon,

540
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,653
but this mission ain't
going to the moon.

541
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,240
That's right. Frank Gifford, he was a
great football player in his time,

542
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,117
but if he played now,
he'd get his ass busted.

543
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,660
That's right.

544
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:40,633
All I'm saying is, the moon did not
have a rotational cycle of 14 hours.

545
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:44,053
I mean, this is... We only have seven
hours of dark when the sun's not up

546
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,972
to land on this thing. it was light when he landed.
This is gonna be dark.

547
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:50,225
- We're not gonna be able to see.
- You can't see now, Gus.

548
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,436
Don't worry, don't worry.

549
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,396
- We what?
- We can do it.

550
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,651
No, no, stay down.

551
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,324
I woke up this morning and I
realized none of you want me here.

552
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,286
You don't even really know
who I am, which is okay.

553
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,789
I walked on the moon, but
I didn't belong to you.

554
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,376
I belonged to your daddies. Now,
if I ask you to ask your daddies

555
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,671
what I meant to them, to explain
to you what I'm doing here,

556
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,590
that's only gonna make things worse.
So...

557
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,093
What do we do?

558
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,561
You haven't trained for this mission.

559
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,188
We respect you.

560
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,108
- I appreciate that.
- But you're here...

561
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,360
You're here because the powers that be

562
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,196
think we need a familiar
face on this trip.

563
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,782
- You're here for public relations.
- No, no. I'm here

564
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,244
because the powers that be know that
I'm the only person on this mission

565
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,996
who's ever landed on the moon.

566
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,081
And I have 500 landings
on aircraft carriers.

567
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,751
- We've trained on...
- On a flight simulator. Right?

568
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,589
And this... l mean, this is not a
video game, son. it really isn't.

569
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,510
It really isn't. No.

570
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,850
We are a go for auto-sequence start.

571
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,769
Atlantis' four on board computers

572
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,064
now have primary control of all
the vehicle's critical functions.

573
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,566
Okay, all flight controllers.

574
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,318
We're at T-minus 30
seconds and counting.

575
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,695
Let's take a close look.

576
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,740
APUs look good, logs and
LH2 are pressurized.

577
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,826
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Flight, we're go for auto-sequence.

578
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,036
- Roger, Jerry.
- ...seven, six...

579
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,913
- Good luck and Godspeed, Atlantis.
- Thanks, Mitch.

580
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,583
...three, two, one.

581
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:54,641
Propelled by 500,000
pounds of liquid fuel,

582
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,020
the shuttle crew heads toward
their initial destination.

583
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,730
When the crew enters the Messiah,

584
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,483
they will find a payload
of eight nuclear devices

585
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,235
that will eventually be
used to blow up the comet.

586
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,570
The Messiah itself will be powered

587
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,198
by an experimental nuclear
propulsion system

588
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,909
that was originally created
for a very different purpose.

589
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,454
That program was called Orion.

590
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,457
Now, with the help of
Russian engineers,

591
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,628
a technology designed to propel
weapons of mass destruction

592
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,214
will power the ship that will
intercept the greatest threat

593
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,341
our planet has ever faced.

594
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:41,814
Orion burn in ten, nine, eight,

595
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,900
seven, six, five,

596
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:49,446
four, three, two, one, zero.

597
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,419
Okay. Beth, White House reactions.
Marianne, the whole world watching.

598
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,630
- We have enough satellite space?
- Seventy-eight uplinks.

599
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,925
Tim, mission control in Houston.
lra, the science guys lined up?

600
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,385
If they got a Ph.D., we own them.

601
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:16,265
All right, this is the most important
story of our lives. Let's not muck it up.

602
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,976
- Stuart, what about me?
- You're on the anchor desk.

603
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,811
And you could have been
there a lot sooner.

604
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,021
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

605
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,983
Don't ever hold back a
story from me again.

606
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:42,833
Messiah, Houston. Transfer trajectory is go.
Cancel MCC 1.

607
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,502
You're go to configure for coast.

608
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,381
Roger, Houston, we're
looking good here.

609
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,760
Jesus, that's big.

610
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,846
Holy shit.

611
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,853
Sweet mother of God.

612
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,284
All circuit breakers are open.
Master arm is off.

613
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,078
Roger. And the detonator
system is safe.

614
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,642
Messiah, Houston. Stand
by for an uplink

615
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,436
of the final MOLE coordinates.
Confirm when complete.

616
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,104
Wilco, Houston.

617
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,065
Hey, how's it coming?

618
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,150
Loading first nuke now.

619
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,722
1,000 feet to standoff.

620
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:24,226
Rdot 3, 5x, 2y.

621
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:34,027
500 feet. Rdot.3, 3x, 1 .5y.

622
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,905
Go for auto trajectory.

623
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:40,867
We're there.

624
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,495
- Residuals are nulled.
- Disengage Orion.

625
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,416
Orion disengaged. You're on bi-prop.

626
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:03,890
This is a special presentation
of MSNBC News with Jenny Lerner.

627
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,815
Good evening.

628
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,609
Sometime in the next hour,
the Messiah mission

629
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,528
will enter its most critical phase.

630
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:20,532
The interception of Wolf-Biederman and
the setting of the nuclear devices

631
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,244
that will deflect it off its
collision course with Earth.

632
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,540
But first, Captain Spurgeon Tanner
will have to guide the spacecraft

633
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:33,128
through the blizzard of rocks, sand and
ice that make up the comet's tail,

634
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,629
or coma.

635
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,841
The crew will have to complete
its work before the sun rises.

636
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:41,511
- Sublimator looks good, Mick.
- Disengaging auto now.

637
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,181
I'm eyeballs out from here on in.

638
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,600
How come that doesn't
make me feel any better?

639
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,143
I heard that.

640
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,603
Lights on.

641
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,897
Cameras on.

642
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,940
On the Mississippi River
in Mark Twain's time,

643
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:57,694
there were riverboat pilots who
only knew a few miles of the river.

644
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:01,615
I mean, conditions changed so much
you couldn't know the whole trip.

645
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,950
Floods, sandbars, fallen logs.

646
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,036
It was all a riverboat pilot could do,

647
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,164
was to know his little
piece of the puzzle.

648
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,335
So, for the next few
hours, this is my ship.

649
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,171
We start our approach.

650
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:32,396
...are images from cameras mounted
inside the cargo bay of the Messiah.

651
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,816
Now, these images are delayed
by approximately 20 seconds,

652
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,068
due to the distance they must travel.

653
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,363
Okay, you can see that the
image is breaking up a bit.

654
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,615
Houston is prepared for this.

655
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,159
They've informed us that due
to the uncertain makeup

656
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,744
of the comet's coma,

657
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,248
they're unsure whether or not
transmission will be possible.

658
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,960
Okay, now it appears we're
losing reception here.

659
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,715
Okay, we've lost picture now,
but we will stay on the air.

660
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,510
We'll stay with you through all of this.

661
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,515
Prop, 96%.

662
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,394
- DAP is in descent.
- Roger, descent.

663
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,904
Oh, my God. Look at these,
they're the size of houses.

664
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,365
Yeah, I know. I see.

665
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,214
Jesus Christ.

666
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,008
Prop, 88%.

667
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,635
Cabin press, 5.7.

668
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,763
Negative guidance errors.

669
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:16,291
- Use primary thrusters.
- Engage thrusters.

670
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,097
- What's the descent rate?
- Three feet per second. Two.

671
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,892
- Fire tether pitons.
- Pitons fired.

672
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,157
She's leveling out.

673
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,896
- Depressurizing bay.
- Opening payload doors.

674
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:25,193
Don't let that little bit of gravity
down there go to your heads.

675
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:26,987
Okay.

676
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,906
Start the clock.

677
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,128
If all is going according to schedule,
the astronauts should now be placing

678
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,297
the MOLEs on the comet surface.

679
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,717
The MOLEs are... Well, they're
what they sound like.

680
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:35,555
They are drilling machines that
burrow to a depth of 100 meters,

681
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,807
where they wait to be detonated.

682
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,603
Each one carries a
5,000 kiloton warhead.

683
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:01,581
- How's our time?
- It's getting tight. 1:36:30.

684
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,750
It's taking too long.

685
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,669
Yep.

686
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:16,137
What happens if they do not get
off the comet's surface in time?

687
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,348
The sun striking the comet
will cause the temperature

688
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,559
to rise 350 degrees in
just a few minutes,

689
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,354
and activate the high-speed gas jets.

690
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:29,109
Well, if that happens, it will be
like trying to work in a minefield.

691
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,697
- Mark, what's your MOLE 4 readout?
- MOLE 4 running true at 75 feet.

692
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,161
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

693
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,539
- It's stuck.
- Try backing it up.

694
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,417
- What's your depth?
- Seventy-five feet.

695
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,794
- Is that enough?
- No, that'll just break pieces

696
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,629
- off the surface.
- That's not deep enough.

697
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,507
Yeah, Fish, I know
that's not deep enough.

698
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,343
- I'm going in.
- Oren, no.

699
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:58,054
No, I'm gonna see if I can free it up.

700
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,599
- Standby tether attached.
- All right, I got you.

701
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,185
Oren, suit pressure, 3.5.

702
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,907
Come on, come on.

703
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:24,289
- How's my time?
- 23:57.

704
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:28,126
Another six minutes, they won't
have time to get back to us.

705
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,837
Blow the tethers. Let's go get them.

706
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,339
If we go after them, we may not have
enough fuel to get off the surface.

707
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,966
Go on, blow the goddamn tethers!

708
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,262
MOLE 3 at depth. We're
heading your way, Oren.

709
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,223
Calculate exactly how much prop
we need to get off this rock.

710
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,310
- We'll shut it down when we hit it.
- Will do.

711
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:58,823
It opens up into a cave down here.
MOLE gotjammed against the side.

712
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:04,287
Okay, Fish, team two at location four.
Give me your hand.

713
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,958
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

714
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:12,587
Everything was going great.
We gotjammed up at 75 feet.

715
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,806
Okay, hold up.

716
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,935
- All right, try backing it up.
- Roger that.

717
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,703
- That's it.
- No, a little more, a little more.

718
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,622
- Shut it down.
- No, look, they always put extra

719
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,250
- in these tanks.
- Fish, shut it down.

720
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,419
Okay.

721
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,929
Come on, you bastard! Come on! Time.

722
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:04,264
1:02.

723
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,724
Figured we'd better pick
you kids up after school.

724
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,852
Check your six, 100 yards.

725
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,606
I think we'd better hurry, boys.

726
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,867
All right, it's going! it's going.

727
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,135
MOLE'S at 125 feet.

728
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,596
The sun's rising behind you.
It's coming up fast.

729
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,604
Face shields down!

730
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,315
Christ.

731
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,859
Get the hell out of there!

732
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,624
Oren, get your visor down!
Get your visor down!

733
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:18,796
My eyes!

734
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,012
- All right, we got him.
- Oh, God! My eyes!

735
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,973
God, we're losing one.
He's got escape velocity.

736
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,225
1,000 feet and climbing.

737
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,147
Mark, Mikhail, get the
hell out of there!

738
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,504
- Firing primary thrusters.
- Payload doors still open.

739
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,339
Close them as we go.

740
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:06,612
Houston, all MOLEs are at depth.
Nukes hot and ready.

741
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,908
We lost Partenza to
explosive out-gassing,

742
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,995
and Monash is injured.

743
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,753
- We have to go get Gus.
- There's no time for that.

744
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,381
- Re-pressurize the cargo bay.
- He's going to die out there.

745
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,716
We can still find him. He has a beacon.

746
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,219
I don't have time to argue with you.
Just sit down, be quiet.

747
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,764
- Turn on the fucking locator!
- We used most of our propellant

748
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,807
- to get us out of the coma.
- We can't just leave him.

749
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,226
- We have to go back!
- If we go back for Gus, we all die.

750
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,729
We can't just leave him in space!

751
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,483
Sit down, Mick. Sit down. it's okay.

752
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:59,207
The Messiah has safely
lifted off the comet,

753
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,918
but, sadly, Gus Partenza has been lost.

754
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,214
Gus Partenza, a native of
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,

755
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,133
and graduate of Carnegie
Mellon University,

756
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,094
joined the NASA space program

757
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:15,181
shortly after completing his medical
training at Duke University.

758
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:19,435
Dr. Partenza was selected
specifically for this mission

759
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,940
not only for his medical expertise,
but also for his dedication

760
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,651
to the advancement
of space technology.

761
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,114
Yeah.

762
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,794
With the loss of Dr. Gus Partenza
and with Oren Monash injured,

763
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,422
Captain Spurgeon Tanner is now
in charge of the mission.

764
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:52,468
The Messiah has successfully docked
with the Orion-powered boosters

765
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:56,722
and is now prepared to detonate the
bombs planted on Wolf-Biederman.

766
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,518
The Messiah's exterior-mounted
camera will show us the detonation

767
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:04,689
but not before being temporarily
blocked out by the nuclear blast.

768
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:08,276
Once again, let me remind you,
there is a 20-second delay,

769
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,945
so when the picture comes back to us,

770
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,240
the comet should already have been
knocked off its present course.

771
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,210
Prepare to remove safeties and fire.

772
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,174
Safeties removed.

773
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:40,808
Weapons armed.

774
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,446
Three, two, one.

775
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,822
Now.

776
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:04,165
So now we're just waiting for
the picture to come back.

777
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,887
Decompression in area six.

778
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,316
Mick, I'll get the halon.

779
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,548
Yes. I'm still here.

780
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:23,202
...even larger. We've lost
contact with the Messiah.

781
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,506
We're live in 10 seconds.

782
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,134
Cue the President.

783
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:41,846
Mr. President, five, four, three...

784
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,935
Hello, America.

785
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,898
It is my unhappy duty to report to
you that the Messiah has failed.

786
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,651
This computer-enhanced
radar image from Houston

787
01:00:55,736 --> 01:01:00,448
shows how the detonation succeeded,
however, did not destroy the comet.

788
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,993
There are now two pieces,
one 6 miles wide,

789
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,370
the other a mile and a half.

790
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:09,165
Both are still on a path towards Earth.

791
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,543
We've lost communication
with the Messiah spacecraft,

792
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,463
although we continue
to track it visually.

793
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:20,134
We don't know how many are alive.
We don't know their condition.

794
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,889
Now we have to make some
decisions together.

795
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:31,312
What do we do? You have a choice.
We have a choice right now.

796
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,690
Ever since the comet was discovered,

797
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,526
we've been hoping and
working for the best,

798
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,446
but we've also been
planning for the worst.

799
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,948
Our strategy has been twofold.

800
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,993
First, our Strategic Missile Command

801
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:47,703
is preparing to coordinate
with the Russians

802
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:51,499
a massive strike of Titan
missiles to intercept the comets.

803
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,960
If we can deflect these comets enough,

804
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:58,464
they will bounce harmlessly
off our atmosphere

805
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,425
and head on out into space.

806
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:05,262
Unfortunately, the Titans
cannot be launched

807
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,598
until the comets are
only a few hours away.

808
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:11,394
And while we are confident the
missile attack will succeed,

809
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,313
it is only prudent that we
now take cautionary steps

810
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:17,274
to ensure the continuation
of our way of life,

811
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,403
to guarantee that there
will be enough of us left

812
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,321
to rebuild a new world

813
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:26,117
in the unlikely event that the
comets do strike the Earth.

814
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,995
So in the soft limestone of Missouri,

815
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:33,541
we've been preparing a
network of immense caves.

816
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,376
And they're almost finished.

817
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,170
And we can put a million
people in them.

818
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:42,550
And that million people can survive
there, underground, for two years,

819
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:45,678
until the air clears
and the dust settles.

820
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:50,808
Now, the cave is more than a dormitory.
It is our new Noah's Ark.

821
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:56,439
We're storing seeds and seedlings, plants, animals.
Enough to start over.

822
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:01,986
On August 10th, a computer will
randomly select 800,000 Americans

823
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:05,448
to join the 200,000 scientists, doctors,

824
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:09,785
engineers, teachers, soldiers and
artists who have already been chosen.

825
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,289
Other countries are preparing similar
caves along whatever lines they feel

826
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,083
are best to preserve their way of life.

827
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,835
This is ours.

828
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,131
Beginning tonight and continuing
until the crisis passes,

829
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,842
I am declaring a state of martial law.

830
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,261
The armed forces and
the National Guard

831
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,055
are working with local law enforcement.

832
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,683
A national curfew begins
at midnight tonight.

833
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,728
Now, wherever you are, go home.

834
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,064
Stay off the roads after sunset.

835
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:43,277
Crimes against persons or property
will be dealt with swiftly

836
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,196
and harshly.

837
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,407
News stations around the
nation are being faxed copies

838
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,326
of the lottery procedure as we speak,

839
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:54,413
and they'll be broadcasting the
details to you in a few moments.

840
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,214
I wish...

841
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,134
No.

842
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,846
Wishing is wrong.

843
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:15,017
It's the wrong word right now.
That's not what I mean.

844
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,395
What I mean is...

845
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,024
I believe in God.

846
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,443
Relax.

847
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:29,365
I know a lot of you don't, but
I still want to offer a prayer

848
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:32,368
for our survival,

849
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,454
mine included.

850
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,916
Because I believe that God,

851
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,293
whomever you hold that to be,

852
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,546
hears all prayers,

853
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,216
even if sometimes the answer is no.

854
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,886
So may the Lord bless you.

855
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,597
May the Lord keep you.

856
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,643
May the Lord lift up his
divine countenance upon you

857
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,272
and give you peace.

858
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:10,531
And in five, four, three, two...

859
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,626
We now have the details
for the national lottery.

860
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,922
Those of you who have
been preselected

861
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:29,925
will be notified within
the next few minutes.

862
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:35,306
For the rest, on the night of August 10th,
those whose Social Security numbers

863
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:39,310
have been randomly selected
by computer will be notified.

864
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,437
While some Americans

865
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:45,608
over 50 years of age have
been preselected for the Ark

866
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:49,028
due to their expertise in a
necessary field of study,

867
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:53,032
no men and women over 50
in the general population

868
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,451
will be included in the lottery.

869
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,668
The...

870
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:09,173
The... The evacuation of those who
have been selected for the Ark

871
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:13,010
will take no longer than two
days, beginning on August 12th.

872
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:17,431
During this two-day period, no
unofficial travel will be permitted.

873
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,100
Those selected will be
taken by bus and train

874
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:23,395
to the underground Ark site
by military personnel.

875
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,273
Civil defense teams have been formed

876
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:29,610
in every town with a
population over 5,000.

877
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,656
They will distribute supplies
and organize group shelters

878
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,576
in underground parking facilities
and other appropriate sites.

879
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:42,456
Construction plans, equipment
lists and locations

880
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,459
- for securing the necessary provisions...
- Hello?

881
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,378
- ...along with information...
- Yes, this is Ellen Biederman.

882
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:51,340
...on how to grow your own food
underground and how to purify water

883
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,051
are now available on the internet at...

884
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:59,973
- We've been preselected.
- ...www.fcda.gov.

885
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:03,435
Chuck, Chuck. Where are you going?

886
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:07,147
- Our phone. They could be calling.
- ...beginning on August 9th.

887
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:12,111
The only phones that ring will
be those of the people selected.

888
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,322
That's it.

889
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,117
That's all there is.

890
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:28,794
The interior camera circuitry is shot.

891
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,796
So, Andy, can we get
back into the cargo bay

892
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,798
to reroute the video functions?

893
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,968
Starboard cargo porthole's blown.
We could go in with the EVAs,

894
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,303
but there's not much left
in the life-support packs.

895
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:42,641
We should be able to raise Houston
on the low band once we get closer.

896
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,727
And the Orion is still functioning?

897
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:48,397
System check was okay, but I don't
know about the radiation shielding.

898
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,400
So if we fire it up, we beat
the comet back to Earth,

899
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,486
but we may end up glowing in the dark.

900
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,783
Okay. So...

901
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,662
Anybody?

902
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,298
Let's go home.

903
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,805
Okay.

904
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,152
I have to say, it's liberating knowing
that I'm not going to be called.

905
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:40,115
I don't think I've ever been happier.
I've even stopped smoking.

906
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,870
What are you gonna do with all
that extra money you save?

907
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,917
Do you know the National Gallery
is saving all of the art?

908
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:52,294
They're shipping it to the caves.

909
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,048
I've given them my beautiful
18th-century desk from New England

910
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,258
and all the Sheraton silver.

911
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,220
I really feel like I'd
protected something

912
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,472
when I gave them.

913
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:09,061
You should see my apartment.
There's nothing there.

914
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,396
It's practically Japanese.

915
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,902
Seems kind of unfair that I got picked.

916
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,780
You know, I'm not a
doctor or a scientist.

917
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,785
People need continuity.
Everyone knows you,

918
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,579
and they trust you.

919
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,124
But I can't help you.

920
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,127
Don't worry about me.

921
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:38,423
I'm going to be happy as long
as I know you're going to live.

922
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,152
Mr. Hotchner?

923
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:02,239
Who did I think I was gonna
be when I bought that bike?

924
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,158
Well, every kid on the
block wants one now.

925
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,286
Every parent on the
block hates you for it.

926
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,663
Well, thank you, Leo. That's the
best news I've had in years.

927
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,706
Sir?

928
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,666
Can you give me a hand
over here for a second?

929
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,043
- Yes, sir.
- I just wanna get these bars up.

930
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,670
- Hello, Mrs. Hotchner.
- Hi, Leo.

931
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,923
A mob attacked and killed a
Miami rental yard operator

932
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:24,052
who was charging $5,000 an hour
for backhoe and tractor rentals.

933
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:27,848
Same old crap on the TV. I'm
really sick of it, you know?

934
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,142
- Mrs. Hotchner?
- Sarah's on the hill.

935
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,560
Thank you.

936
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:41,069
Where were you today?

937
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,448
I've been looking all over for you.

938
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:48,243
- Why weren't you at school?
- My dad said I didn't have to go.

939
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,329
He said there's no point.

940
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:57,711
I talked to civil defense.

941
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:02,299
They said if you and I got married,
we'd be family and I could get you in.

942
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,969
Well, what about my parents?
They're not your family.

943
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,764
- I don't wanna go without my parents.
- You don't have to.

944
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:12,684
I'm the famous Leo Biederman, and I
haven't used my fame for anything.

945
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,604
But I got them to let
your family go, too.

946
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,610
You...

947
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,196
This is your only chance to survive.

948
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:44,466
Across the country, looters continue
to set fire to abandoned stores.

949
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,469
Fires have been left to burn,
since many firefighters

950
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,347
have been called to
help prepare shelters.

951
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:52,849
Throughout Latin America's major cities,

952
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:56,478
business districts have been
abandoned to looting gangs.

953
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:07,239
Emergency airlifts have been
ruled out as too dangerous.

954
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:12,244
More street fighting in Moscow as
food and fuel shortages continue...

955
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:30,095
"...believes all things, hopes
all things, endures all things.

956
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,891
"When I was a child, I
spoke like a child,

957
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:38,437
"I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.

958
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:43,025
"When I became a man, I
gave up childish ways.

959
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:48,113
"For now we see in a mirror
dimly, but then face to face.

960
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:53,493
"Now I know in part, then
I shall understand fully,

961
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,954
"even as I have been fully understood."

962
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:10,218
Do you, Leo, take Sarah to be your wife,

963
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,722
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

964
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:18,143
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

965
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,771
to love and to cherish?

966
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:31,990
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

967
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:54,614
Here. Let me help you. I'll get it.

968
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,870
Yeah. How you feeling?

969
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,416
- Fine.
- I wanna tell you something.

970
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,128
You children didn't bring any real
books to read, did you know that?

971
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,589
I brought Moby Dick
and Huckleberry Finn,

972
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:13,383
and Baker and Simon
had never read them.

973
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:18,471
Now, I'm afraid to ask you, have
you ever read Melville or Twain?

974
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,519
Hey, I'm a child of the movies, Fish.

975
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,730
Okay, I see.

976
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,565
So...

977
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,028
You got a shitty deal,
Oren, you know that?

978
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,404
You truly did.

979
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,615
- Don't worry about me.
- Yeah.

980
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:40,160
- I mean that, really.
- Okay.

981
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,370
- Don't worry about me.
- Okay.

982
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,415
My whole life, I...

983
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:51,129
You know how it is for guys like us.

984
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,966
You and... You and I, we're the same.

985
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,469
How do you mean by that?

986
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:01,640
- Gotta be the best.
- I see. Okay.

987
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,184
- Be the best.
- Yeah.

988
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,158
Sometimes I see flashes of light.

989
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,578
You know, like colors.

990
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,543
I fall asleep and I dream.

991
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:35,006
But there's a part of
me that's always awake,

992
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,592
and I can see myself dreaming.

993
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:46,059
I'm just... I'm seeing
things differently, Fish.

994
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,144
That's good. That's good.

995
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:50,438
Fish.

996
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:55,902
Why the hell do they call you Fish?

997
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:00,824
Well, Spurgeon, sturgeon, Fish.

998
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,577
I mean, it took about 15 minutes of
my first day at the naval academy.

999
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,831
Yeah. Your kids go there?

1000
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,751
Yeah, they did. They did.

1001
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:14,462
And they're good men, both of them.

1002
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:18,383
I don't see as much of them as
I used to when Mary was alive.

1003
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:23,763
- You don't have to talk about it. it's okay.
- No, it's okay. it's okay.

1004
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,473
You're a married man, you
know what it's like.

1005
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:29,269
I mean, every marriage has its
good years and its bad years.

1006
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,688
We ended on a great year.

1007
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:36,943
Yeah.

1008
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,280
Anyway, let's get started.

1009
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,242
Moby Dick, Chapter 1.

1010
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,205
"Call me lshmael.

1011
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,083
"Several years ago, never
mind how long precisely,

1012
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,002
"having little or no
money in my purse..."

1013
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,838
"Whenever I find myself
growing grim about the mouth,

1014
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,592
"whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul,

1015
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:04,012
"whenever I find myself
knocking people's hats off,

1016
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:10,185
"then I account it high time to
get to sea as soon as I can."

1017
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,869
- Listen up.
- Hold it right there.

1018
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,245
- Biederman.
- Yeah, that's us.

1019
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,455
IDs, please.

1020
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,831
Got them right here.

1021
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,958
There's four of us. Lewis?

1022
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:38,171
This is my wife, Sarah. We
have a marriage license.

1023
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,173
I have it right here.

1024
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:49,891
Okay. All right, let's go.
Let's move it out.

1025
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,520
Mom. Wait. Sir, my
parents are coming, too.

1026
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,522
Wait, wait, the Hotchners
are coming, too.

1027
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,358
- H-O-T-C...
- H-N-E-R.

1028
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,736
- No, it's not here.
- No, no. it has to be there.

1029
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,488
They sent their names
to the White House.

1030
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,282
- They're not there.
- Just check the goddamn list again.

1031
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,742
- Leo, give me your bag.
- They must be there.

1032
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,577
- Look closely.
- Ellen, give me your bag, sweetie.

1033
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:10,787
No. They're not on the list.

1034
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,664
- Wait, wait.
- I'm sorry. Let's go. We have to go.

1035
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,916
- Sir, you don't understand.
- Leo, can you check it one more time?

1036
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,420
I put you on the list. They said
your names were on the list.

1037
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,006
- Sarah, I put them on the list.
- We're not on the list.

1038
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,759
I need the Biedermans on the bus now.

1039
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:26,594
- Dad, I wanna stay with you.
- What?

1040
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,264
- No, no, no. We have to go.
- Leo, let's get her on the bus.

1041
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:32,142
- Yes, I need to stay with you.
- Sarah.

1042
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:33,893
Sarah, you need to go.

1043
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,145
No, I have to stay with you, Dad.

1044
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:37,313
Listen, I'm not going
anywhere without you.

1045
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:38,940
Sarah, you don't know
what you're doing.

1046
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,608
Come or stay, young lady,
this bus is moving out.

1047
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,820
Son, on the bus. Get on the bus!

1048
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:45,280
Let's go.

1049
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:48,199
Chuck, we'll work it
out when we get there.

1050
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:12,265
- What's that, the crates?
- Jenny, there's a phone call for you.

1051
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,729
Yes. This is she.

1052
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,441
It's Robin Lerner. My mother.

1053
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:30,742
When?

1054
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,123
Sixty-one.

1055
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,128
I'll come down there, then. Thank you.

1056
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,964
Thank you very much.

1057
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,679
Jenny, do you want
me to do something?

1058
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,663
You're too late. I already
took care of everything.

1059
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,794
Come, come. inside the car.
You're getting sick. Please.

1060
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:06,838
I want to talk to you.

1061
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,049
Please, come.

1062
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,430
I don't give a shit. Go
home and tell it to Chloe.

1063
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,390
I can't. She left me.

1064
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:20,560
She's with her mother.
They both got scared.

1065
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,855
Come. I want to talk to you. I need you.

1066
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,191
How does it feel?

1067
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,197
I feel like an orphan.

1068
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,244
Jenny. Jenny!

1069
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,041
Stop.

1070
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,910
Welcome to the Ark. I'm section
leader for Orange 254.

1071
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,871
Remember that. it's where you'll be
calling home the next two years.

1072
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:07,458
So gather your things and follow
me to the orientation gallery.

1073
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:13,214
If you have been designated as
a civilian section officer,

1074
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:17,510
report to section Red 116 upon entering.

1075
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:23,599
Once again, if you have been designated
as a civilian section officer,

1076
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:27,520
report to section Red 116 upon entering.

1077
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,440
Leo.

1078
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,277
I'm not coming.

1079
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:37,196
Leo, come with us right now.

1080
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,407
I have to go back for Sarah.

1081
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,534
- Leo.
- Mom, I'm going.

1082
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,334
- Don, what are you doing?
- I'm giving him something to trade.

1083
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,295
That's what I'm doing.

1084
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:55,465
- I want you to take this.
- Dad, that's enough.

1085
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,054
God damn it.

1086
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,224
You take care of yourself, okay?

1087
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,937
I'm gonna make it.

1088
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:21,783
What about Entrekin?

1089
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,744
I don't know. He hasn't returned
my call in over two weeks.

1090
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,370
- Excuse me, Jenny.
- Yeah?

1091
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,206
Your father's here.

1092
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:36,172
Hello.

1093
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:40,802
I can't stay long. I'm leaving the city,
but I wanted to show you something.

1094
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:43,971
I wanted to show you that
you're not an orphan.

1095
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:50,603
I have proof that you're not an orphan.

1096
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:52,063
Here.

1097
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:56,734
Look.

1098
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,745
Where's Mom?

1099
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,540
Behind the camera.

1100
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,417
She took this?

1101
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,711
And this one, too.

1102
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:20,091
She was such an artist,
don't you think so?

1103
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,886
You don't remember
when you take them?

1104
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:26,973
I'm five years old. How
would I remember that?

1105
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:31,394
Well, some people do remember
when they were five years old.

1106
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:36,399
It was such a beautiful day.

1107
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:38,442
All alone on the beach.

1108
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:43,614
And of course she would
have been in the picture,

1109
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:47,118
but there was no one
else to hold the camera,

1110
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,705
and she insisted.

1111
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:53,457
You know how she is.

1112
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:55,960
How she was.

1113
01:26:57,838 --> 01:26:59,005
Jenny.

1114
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:07,680
It was such a good day for all of us.

1115
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,641
Don't you remember?

1116
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:18,941
Keep them.

1117
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:23,529
Goodbye.

1118
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:00,191
We have now confirmed the launch
of all the Titan missiles

1119
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,444
from their positions in
North Dakota and Wyoming.

1120
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:06,238
The comets are now
approximately 14 hours

1121
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,532
outside of Earth's atmosphere,

1122
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,952
and we are told it should
take these missiles

1123
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,871
less than 20 minutes
to reach their target.

1124
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:16,707
Okay, here's what we're looking at.

1125
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:19,168
All of the Titans have been launched.

1126
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:22,463
We still won't know if
they've made a difference.

1127
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,799
The comets have to travel for a while

1128
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:28,094
before the radar tracking stations
can see if they've been pushed

1129
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,972
to a safe course that'll
bypass the Earth.

1130
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:34,392
So one more time, we have to wait.

1131
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:57,248
Are we on?
- We're on, Mr. President.

1132
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,760
Our missiles have failed.

1133
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:14,015
The comets are still headed for Earth,

1134
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,729
and there's nothing we
can do to stop them.

1135
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,108
So this is it.

1136
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,445
If the world does go on,

1137
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,531
it will not go on for everyone.

1138
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,953
We have now been able to calculate
the comets' final trajectories,

1139
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:39,331
and we have determined where
they're going to strike.

1140
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:43,169
The smaller of the two comets,
Biederman, will hit first

1141
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:44,879
somewhere along the Atlantic seaboard,

1142
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:48,049
probably in the waters off
the coast of Cape Hatteras,

1143
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:51,802
in just under 12 hours, at 4:35 p.m.
Eastern Daylight Time.

1144
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:55,556
The impact of the comet is going to be,

1145
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,267
well, disastrous.

1146
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,395
There will be a very large tidal wave

1147
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,564
moving quickly through
the Atlantic Ocean.

1148
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:07,735
It'll be 100 feet high, traveling
at 1,100 miles an hour.

1149
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,488
That's faster than the speed of sound.

1150
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:13,324
As the wave reaches shallow
water it's going to slow down,

1151
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,745
but the wave height, depending on the
depth of the shelf off the coast,

1152
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:21,749
will be anywhere from
1,000 to 3,500 feet high.

1153
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:26,462
Where the land is flat,
the wave will wash inland

1154
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,839
600 to 700 miles.

1155
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:34,178
The wave will hit our nation's
capital 40 minutes after impact.

1156
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:40,559
New York City, Boston,
Atlanta, Philadelphia,

1157
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,188
all will be destroyed.

1158
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:48,234
If you have any means of getting
away from the path of this wave,

1159
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:49,652
leave now.

1160
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,530
The impact of the larger comet

1161
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:56,158
will be nothing less than
an extinction-level event.

1162
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:00,746
It will strike land in western
Canada three hours after Biederman.

1163
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:05,084
Within a week, the skies will be
dark with dust from the impact,

1164
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,795
and they will stay dark for two years.

1165
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,257
All plant life will be dead within

1166
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,218
four weeks.

1167
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:17,304
Animal life within

1168
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:20,516
a few months.

1169
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,479
So that's it.

1170
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,732
Good luck to us all.

1171
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:59,597
Could I bother everyone for a minute?
Now, let's take a look at the big one.

1172
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:03,142
Now, the out-gassing has created
a vent a half a mile wide

1173
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:06,187
and at least 2 miles deep.
Comet gets closer to the sun,

1174
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:10,065
sun melts ice, ice turns to
steam, we get a big hole. Okay?

1175
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:14,987
So, how many nukes we
have left in the back?

1176
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:16,280
Four.

1177
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:21,827
Okay. if we can get the
remaining bombs in that vent,

1178
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:26,207
there shouldn't be anything left of
that comet bigger than a suitcase.

1179
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:29,335
Now, we can't do anything
about the little one,

1180
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,796
but, you know, it just
might give them a chance.

1181
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,174
Now, without the arming codes,
we're gonna have to wait

1182
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:39,136
to set the bomb timers until we get
closer to Earth to raise Houston.

1183
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,180
We may not have enough
life support left

1184
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:44,183
to get back into the
cargo bay for the nukes,

1185
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,310
much less to work down on the comet.

1186
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,646
And we sure as hell don't have enough
propellant left in the Messiah

1187
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,356
to maneuver with.

1188
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:54,944
How are we supposed to get back
off the surface once we've...

1189
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:57,154
Once we've gone down there?

1190
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:03,327
We don't.

1191
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,630
Well, you look at the bright side.

1192
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:18,217
We'll all have high
schools named after us.

1193
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:45,160
Houston, this is Messiah.

1194
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,259
Nice of you to call, Messiah.

1195
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,386
We were beginning to wonder what
the hell you were doing up there.

1196
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,556
- Admiring the view, Houston.
- Fish, is that you?

1197
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,309
Yep. We don't have
time to talk, Houston.

1198
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:11,312
There's nothing we can do about the
smaller one, but we do have a plan.

1199
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:13,897
We need the arming codes
for the last four nukes.

1200
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:15,607
Arming codes? What the hell for?

1201
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,694
Mitch, we can do or we can teach.
What's your pleasure?

1202
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,823
Get the arming codes.
Get the goddamn codes!

1203
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,492
We have one helicopter.
It holds seven people.

1204
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:27,745
We can ferry six people to
high ground in West Virginia

1205
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:30,748
and take Jenny to the Ark.
Short stick goes.

1206
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,751
I always thought it was
women and children first.

1207
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:37,129
If you get the short one,
you can give up your seat.

1208
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:39,965
Thank God.

1209
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,933
Well, that makes sense.

1210
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:54,605
I got a stick. I got a stick.

1211
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:06,325
- I'm sorry, Beth.
- Okay, honey, here we go.

1212
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,744
Let's go now.

1213
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,873
- Beth.
- There's always the road.

1214
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:15,918
We'll be okay. Come on. That's my girl.

1215
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:20,464
Okay, that's it.

1216
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:34,311
Sarah!

1217
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,203
Come on, where's that key?

1218
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:53,330
Where's the key?

1219
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:57,895
Come on, hurry up. Come on.

1220
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,439
- No, wait.
- What are you doing?

1221
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:04,485
Come on, Jenny, we have to go now.
We have to go now.

1222
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,195
Come on. Come on!

1223
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,577
- Beth. Beth, what are you doing?
- Jenny, we have to go!

1224
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:16,246
The road was so crowded, it was
obvious we weren't gonna make it,

1225
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:19,333
so I thought, well, if the wave
does come, that we should be here

1226
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:23,378
because she likes it here and...
l mean, we're on the 15th floor,

1227
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:25,506
- so maybe we'll be okay.
- Come on, honey.

1228
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,591
- Say goodbye to Jenny.
- Jenny, we got no time left.

1229
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:30,719
- Jenny, what are you doing? Caitlin!
- Move! Come on!

1230
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:35,098
- Oh, my God, Caitlin! Caitlin! Caitlin!
- Let's go!

1231
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,813
Come on, come on. Faster, faster.
Come on!

1232
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:43,440
No!

1233
01:37:45,235 --> 01:37:48,529
Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go!
Hang on. There's no room for this.

1234
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,989
- You're taking her? Please!
- She's going with you!

1235
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:52,491
- What?
- You're taking my seat!

1236
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:55,410
- Let's go! Come on!
- Go, go.

1237
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,371
- Jenny, thank you.
- Let's go. Come on. Go!

1238
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:59,706
- Get her in. Get her in there.
- Wait, that's too many.

1239
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,750
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

1240
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:04,753
I'm not going, Eric. Go!

1241
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,387
Oh, my God.

1242
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:03,186
Shove it, buddy!

1243
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:11,820
Sarah!

1244
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:32,215
You're so full of it!

1245
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:34,718
- Sarah, look!
- Leo!

1246
01:39:40,767 --> 01:39:41,850
Leo!

1247
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:43,644
Leo Biederman! Leo!

1248
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:48,065
Leo!

1249
01:39:55,865 --> 01:39:57,449
- Leo!
- Thank God.

1250
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:01,370
You don't have any time.
You have to go now.

1251
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:02,663
- Dad. No, no, no.
- Put this on, put this on.

1252
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:05,165
Daddy. Daddy, what are you doing?

1253
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:08,460
- I want you to take the baby.
- Why? No, no, no, no, no, Mom.

1254
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:11,672
- Yes. No arguments, Sarah. Please!
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't wanna go!

1255
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:14,466
- I don't wanna go!
- Grab his foot, honey.

1256
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:21,890
- Mom, Mom.
- Come on. No, listen to me.

1257
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,559
Sweetheart, listen to me.
Let go. Put this on!

1258
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,436
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1259
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:29,064
- I've always loved you.
- I love you.

1260
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:32,859
- Take care, honey.
- I'll see you soon.

1261
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:36,405
- Put this on.
- I'll see you soon. I'll see you soon.

1262
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:37,781
- Yes, you will.
- Get out of here, Leo.

1263
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:39,741
Go. Go to high ground.

1264
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:59,529
When I was 11, I took
$32 from your wallet.

1265
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:06,661
When you were a baby,

1266
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:10,290
I once dropped you on your head.

1267
01:42:17,924 --> 01:42:21,134
When you came to the studio and
you brought those pictures,

1268
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:23,845
I lied when I said I didn't remember.

1269
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,057
I remember everything.

1270
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:30,185
I remember that we
were right over there

1271
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:33,480
and that's when Mom got
that picture of the house.

1272
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,985
It was a perfect, happy day.

1273
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,866
I came down here to let you know that.

1274
01:42:45,243 --> 01:42:46,576
Thank you.

1275
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:54,251
I've missed you since then.

1276
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:04,386
I missed you, too.

1277
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:35,500
Biederman.

1278
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:39,230
Daddy.

1279
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:26,695
Hold on.

1280
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:24,210
This is Messiah. We're
ready to begin our run.

1281
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:27,756
- Are our families there yet?
- They're on their way, Messiah.

1282
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:33,428
Disengage auto path.

1283
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:36,556
Here we go.

1284
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:44,064
We're at perigee. Wolf contact
in four minutes, 45 seconds.

1285
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:48,485
We'll never be closer to
home than we are right now.

1286
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:08,254
Come on.

1287
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:12,008
Messiah, we've got some people
here that wanna talk to you.

1288
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,344
Wendy, honey.

1289
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:19,057
You promise me you keep
doing your church thing,

1290
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:23,311
and I'll be there, right next to you,

1291
01:47:24,814 --> 01:47:26,272
haunting you.

1292
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:30,568
You better come back and haunt me.

1293
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:32,570
I love you.

1294
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:37,242
There's Mommy. Hello, Mommy.

1295
01:47:38,536 --> 01:47:41,579
Hey, you'll take care
of Daddy for me, okay?

1296
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:44,958
She will. She does a good job.
She misses Mommy.

1297
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:48,044
- I miss you.
- I love you, Mommy.

1298
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:51,381
I love you very, very much.

1299
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:55,135
David.

1300
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:00,515
You know what I wanna say.

1301
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:01,850
I know.

1302
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:13,236
Come on!

1303
01:48:13,571 --> 01:48:16,281
Wolf contact in two
minutes, 30 seconds.

1304
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:21,619
Oren, Mariette's at your
folks' place up in Utah.

1305
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:24,414
We sent a plane for her,
but she isn't here yet.

1306
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:27,041
Fish, your sons are both on active duty.

1307
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:31,004
We tried to get them back, but we
couldn't get them here on time.

1308
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:32,422
I'm sorry.

1309
01:48:34,258 --> 01:48:38,136
Well, Mitch, I wanna
say goodbye to Mary.

1310
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,556
I wanna tell her I love her,

1311
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:45,727
and that ever since we've been
apart, every day I think about her.

1312
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:50,023
Mary, I'm coming home.

1313
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:54,194
Coming up on target, 625 miles.

1314
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:58,865
Range, 600 miles.

1315
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:04,078
Wait. Oh, God, wait!

1316
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:09,417
Wait! I'm coming.

1317
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:14,297
Oren!

1318
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:15,965
Oren, are you there?

1319
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:19,552
Mariette? I'm here. I can hear you.

1320
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:21,804
Hi, sweetie.

1321
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:24,515
- Mariette?
- Baby, this is your father.

1322
01:49:26,018 --> 01:49:28,728
His name is Oren. I
named him after you.

1323
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,230
Hello, Oren.

1324
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:33,942
- Show him what you brought him.
- What happened?

1325
01:49:34,318 --> 01:49:36,653
He's holding up a little rocket.

1326
01:49:38,113 --> 01:49:40,949
That's a mighty powerful
rocket you got there.

1327
01:49:41,033 --> 01:49:42,533
He's laughing.

1328
01:49:43,494 --> 01:49:45,411
I can hear him. I know.

1329
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:49,499
Mariette, I'm hugging
you both right now.

1330
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:52,168
I'm holding you.

1331
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:56,422
- Twenty-five seconds.
- Prepare to synchronize the nukes.

1332
01:49:56,507 --> 01:50:01,344
Twenty-three, 22, 21,

1333
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:07,433
20, 19, 18,

1334
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:12,897
17, 16, 15...

1335
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:18,361
it's been a pleasure serving
with you, Commander.

1336
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,698
The honor's all mine, Andy.

1337
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:29,247
Be good, Oren.

1338
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:33,793
Be good.

1339
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:47,909
We watched as the bombs
shattered the second comet

1340
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:49,911
into a million pieces of ice and rock

1341
01:51:49,995 --> 01:51:52,330
that burned harmlessly
in our atmosphere

1342
01:51:52,414 --> 01:51:54,707
and lit up the sky for an hour.

1343
01:51:56,085 --> 01:51:59,504
Still, we were left with the
devastation of the first.

1344
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:04,342
The waters reached as far inland
as the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.

1345
01:52:05,135 --> 01:52:07,887
It washed away farms and towns,

1346
01:52:08,514 --> 01:52:10,973
forests and skyscrapers.

1347
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:16,145
But the water receded.

1348
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,525
The wave hit Europe and Africa, too.

1349
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:22,819
Millions were lost,

1350
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:26,739
countless more left homeless.

1351
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:31,869
But the waters receded.

1352
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:36,207
Cities fall,

1353
01:52:38,168 --> 01:52:40,002
but they are rebuilt.

1354
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:42,255
And heroes die,

1355
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,675
but they are remembered.

1356
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:49,762
We honor them with every brick we lay,

1357
01:52:50,305 --> 01:52:52,265
with every field we sow,

1358
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:57,103
with every child we comfort
and then teach to rejoice

1359
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:59,397
in what we have been re-given.

1360
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:03,401
Our planet.

1361
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:07,280
Our home.

1362
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:13,578
So now, let us begin.
