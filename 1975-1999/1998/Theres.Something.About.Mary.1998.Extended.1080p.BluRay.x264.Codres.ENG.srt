1
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:17,744
His friends would say
"Stop whining." They've had enough of that

2
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,331
His friends would say
"Stop pining, there's other girls to look at"

3
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,713
They've tried to set him up
With Tiffany and Indigo

4
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:34,844
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

5
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,722
Mary

6
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:43,019
There's just something about Mary

7
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:51,236
Well, his friends say
"Look, life's no fairy tale"

8
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:56,700
That he should have some fun.
He's suffered long enough

9
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:02,873
Well, they may know
About domestic and imported ale

10
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:08,170
But they don't know a thing about love

11
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:14,259
Well, his friends would say
He's dreaming and living in the past

12
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:20,390
But they've never fallen in love
So his friends need not be asked

13
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:27,564
His friends would say, "Be reasonable"
His friends would say, "Let go"

14
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:35,906
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

15
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,367
Mary

16
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:43,831
There's just something about Mary

17
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,887
When I was 16 years old. I fell in love.

18
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,182
Hey, Renise.

19
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,352
Hey.

20
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,688
So. what's up?

21
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,857
Cool.

22
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:20,201
So I was wondering, I don't know
if maybe you wanted to and... Or not.

23
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:22,245
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

24
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:25,540
I just wondered if maybe
you were going to the prom. And...

25
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:30,920
Or if you felt like that,
maybe you'd wanna go with me.

26
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:35,008
Or, I mean. whatever. If you didn't...

27
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:39,095
Did you take that bio test?
Because that was, like...

28
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,931
I heard this rumor that this guy I like
was gonna ask me...

29
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,684
...so I'm gonna wait and see
what happens there.

30
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,271
That sounds great. Yeah.

31
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:50,940
Okay.

32
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:58,865
- So is that, like, a yes or a no or?
- I thought I made it perfectly clear.

33
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:01,701
If everything else falls apart...

34
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:03,620
...maybe.

35
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:07,625
I'm gonna hold you to that.

36
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:16,133
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mary.

37
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,513
I wonder who she's going with.

38
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:25,976
Her name was Mary.

39
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:29,938
She moved to our little Rhode Island town
from Minnesota two years earlier.

40
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,068
What a fox.

41
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:37,196
I heard she's going
with some guy named Woogie.

42
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:42,743
- Who?
- Big guy. Goes to Barrington High.

43
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:46,955
Woogie from Bore-ington High?
Sounds like a loser.

44
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:48,666
Loser?

45
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:54,505
Woogie's only, like, all-state football
and basketball and fucking valedictorian.

46
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:58,676
I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton,
but he's going to Europe first to model.

47
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:02,471
Yeah? I was thinking of doing that.

48
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:05,349
Sorry.

49
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,643
Have you...? Have you seen my baseball?

50
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:10,729
No, no. Sorry, man. Haven't seen it.

51
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,067
Have you seen my baseball?

52
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:16,820
- No.
- Sorry.

53
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,032
Hey, check it out.

54
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,867
Have you seen my baseball?

55
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:27,872
Hey, buddy. Come here.
I think I know where your ball is.

56
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,793
- You seen my baseball?
- Yeah, yeah. I seen it.

57
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:35,505
You see that girl over there?

58
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:39,759
She has it.
except she doesn't call it a baseball.

59
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:42,303
She's got another name for it.

60
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:48,143
Nice muffs.

61
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,147
- Have you seen my wiener?
- What?

62
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,567
Have you seen my wiener?

63
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,903
- What the hell did you just say, buddy?
- Wiener?

64
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:01,990
Get your hand off my car.
What the hell did you just say to me?

65
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:04,993
My wiener.

66
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:08,913
You fucking son of a bitch.
I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.

67
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,167
- Come on, get up, fat boy. Let's go.
- Hey, Smokey, take it easy.

68
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:15,211
- Who the fuck are you?
- The guy's not all there.

69
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,299
Get out of my face. Come on.
You want the first punch?

70
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,010
- Yeah! Fight, fight, fight!
- Fight, fight, fight!

71
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:25,513
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

72
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:29,268
- You okay, Warren?
- Mary, have you seen my baseball?

73
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:30,978
No, I haven't seen your baseball.

74
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:34,774
What are you doing leaving the yard?
You're not supposed to leave by yourself.

75
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,776
- You know him?
- He's my brother.

76
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:38,319
I'm her brother.

77
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,197
- Warren.
- I didn't realize. you know?

78
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:44,909
- You ought to tell him to watch his mouth.
- Jerk.

79
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,040
- Are you okay?
- Oh. yeah, I'm fine.

80
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,167
You okay?

81
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:56,837
Thanks, Ted.

82
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,299
I couldn't believe it. She knew my name.

83
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,511
Some of my best friends
didn't know my name.

84
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:07,640
I think that Joe Montana is, like.
the most underrated quarterback.

85
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,142
I mean, he should've been
a first-round draft pick.

86
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,021
Look what he did at Notre Dame.
It's so ridiculous.

87
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:17,650
- Exactly.
- I'm telling you, this year, it's the 49ers.

88
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:21,278
- 49ers.
- All the way.

89
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:26,575
- Piggyback ride. Piggyback.
- Warren, stop it. Leave Ted alone.

90
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:29,745
No, that's okay, I'll do it.
I mean, if you think he can hold me.

91
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:33,541
Are you kidding me? He's 230 pounds.
He can hold you. You don't have to.

92
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,254
No, it's okay. I got a little disc thing,
but it's all right. Here we go.

93
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,798
Giddyup. Warren. There we go.

94
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:43,927
- That's fun, huh. Warren?
- He's a real Clydesdale, isn't he?

95
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:46,680
Yeah, Warren, bucking bronco. Okay.

96
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:48,807
My turn now. My turn.

97
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:52,853
- Okay, well. I don't...
- It's okay, Ted. You don't have to.

98
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:56,481
- Giddyup. Giddyup.
- That's fun.

99
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:00,360
That's fun, huh, Warren?

100
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,663
That was fun.

101
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,748
- He's only 230, huh?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,544
- I'm in the yard now. I'll hide.
- Okay, go hide.

103
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,629
- He's got a lot of energy.
- Yeah.

104
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:23,008
- He's great. I have a lot of fun with him.
- Yeah.

105
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:27,804
- Thanks for walking us back.
- Yeah, no problem.

106
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:31,892
- I'm just gonna... I'm gonna...
- So are you going to the prom?

107
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,649
- I think proms are dumb.
- I thought maybe we could go together.

108
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:43,069
Oh, you're gonna go with, like,
a bunch of people, or?

109
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:45,071
Yeah. If you want a designated driver...

110
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,533
No, no. I mean you and me.

111
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:50,912
Like, we could go together.
The two of us.

112
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:55,583
- You and me?
- Yeah.

113
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:02,256
Well, is that a yes or a no?

114
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:05,676
- Sure. All right.
- Good.

115
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,595
Cool.

116
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:11,974
I'm gonna take Warren back inside.
I'll see you at school.

117
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:14,477
- Bye.
- Cool. Catch you back at school.

118
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:20,608
From that moment on, the guys at school
looked at me in a whole new light.

119
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,735
You're a fucking liar.

120
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:26,739
Do you expect us to believe
that you're going to the prom with Mary?

121
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,283
What's so crazy about that?

122
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,870
Oh, yeah, dirt bud,
and I'm going with Cyndi Lauper.

123
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:36,624
- What happened to Woogie?
- She said she broke up with him.

124
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:41,587
- That he was getting weird on her.
- I got 20 bucks that says you're full of shit.

125
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,839
- Why not make it a hundred?
- Rock on.

126
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,133
- I'm in.
- Me too.

127
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:13,745
I've paid him enough money. I'm not paying
until the job gets done. He can kiss my ass.

128
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:15,414
What the hell do you want?

129
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:25,257
I'm Ted Stroehmann.
I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

130
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,675
Prom?

131
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,095
Mary went to the prom 20 minutes ago
with her boyfriend, Woogie.

132
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,264
- Woogie?
- Woogie.

133
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,143
I see.

134
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,480
Charlie, you are so mean.

135
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:44,735
This is Mary's stepfather, Charlie.
I'm Sheila, her mother.

136
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:48,530
Ted, don't pay attention to anything
he says. He's a laugh a minute.

137
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,990
That's very funny.

138
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,368
I'm just having a little fun with the guy.
It's prom night.

139
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:54,953
Woogie's got a sense of humor.

140
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,958
Oh, hey. Hi, Warren.

141
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:04,087
Listen, once he gets into that MTV,
he'll be there for quite a while.

142
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:10,136
Here she comes.
Oh, honey. you look beautiful.

143
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:18,061
Shit, look at that.
You better be careful. boy.

144
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,036
Hi. Ted.

145
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:39,624
Hi. Mary. You look really pretty.

146
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,085
Thanks. I like your colors.

147
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:45,922
Oh, thanks.
The guy said it was tan and taupe.

148
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:49,967
Poor Ted's been getting it both barrels
from the wisenheimer here.

149
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,929
Dad. you haven't been busting Ted's chops,
have you?

150
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:56,099
I was just fucking with him, right, Ted?
You know.

151
00:11:57,392 --> 00:12:01,604
- Hey, Warren, did you say hi to Ted?
- About 10 times.

152
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:02,855
Okay.

153
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,900
Hey, Warren,
I think I found your baseball.

154
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:09,237
- You've seen my baseball?
- Well, if it's a big white one?

155
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:15,702
With little red stitching?

156
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,912
Yup, it is.

157
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,207
Then I think I saw it
right behind your ear.

158
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,419
Warren, Warren, Warren. Hold it.

159
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:27,131
Get up, boy. Hey. Warren.

160
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,842
Be careful, man.

161
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:31,760
- Get up. man.
- Warren.

162
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,554
Let go of him. Get down from there.

163
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,889
- Hey, Ted, what are you doing, man?
- Ted, Ted.

164
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:37,808
Warren, put him down now.

165
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:42,229
- What the hell are you doing?
- Here, here. Mary, come around here.

166
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:43,814
This is my house, here.

167
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:48,569
- Okay, sweetheart. okay.
- It's okay, Warren. It's okay. Here you go.

168
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:51,905
- What's the matter with you?
- I was trying to give him the baseball.

169
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:55,701
- Baseball? What baseball?
- I had a baseball. I know he likes baseball.

170
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,328
- What baseball?
- There was a... It's right...

171
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:00,122
There was a baseball here. I swear.

172
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,168
I brought him a baseball.
and I was just trying to give him a present.

173
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:07,045
- Are you yelling at me in my own house?
- No.

174
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,631
Don't make me have to open
a can of whup-ass on you.

175
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,801
Ted, I should have told you.
He has a thing about his ears.

176
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:15,345
You all right. Warren?

177
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,473
Honey, your strap's broken.

178
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,684
You're right.

179
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:23,312
Hey, Ted, I'm just gonna go upstairs
real quick. okay?

180
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,689
I just need two minutes.

181
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:27,692
- I gotta fix my dress.
- I'll help you, honey.

182
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:30,528
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can I use your bathroom. sir?

183
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:31,738
I've gotta...

184
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:33,698
- He broke the table.
- Son of a bitch.

185
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,285
- I didn't do it.
- It's all right. It's all right.

186
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:39,787
- I swear there was...
- The bathroom is that way.

187
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:40,997
- a baseball.

188
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:44,876
Maybe I'll open up a can of whup-ass
on him.

189
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,921
Trying to do the kid a favor.

190
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,705
Is he looking at you? What is he...?

191
00:14:22,873 --> 00:14:25,041
- What is he doing down there?
- Oh. no. I...

192
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,210
- No, no, I wasn't... I wasn't...
- Mom, wait.

193
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:29,671
- Cover yourself. Cover yourself.
- Shit!

194
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:47,439
- Ted, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's okay.

195
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,359
Okay. Okay, just take your time.
It's all right.

196
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:53,028
You know, he's been in there
over a half an hour.

197
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,031
Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

198
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,992
- Oh, come on.
- Mom.

199
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,785
He's not masturbating.

200
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:02,663
He was watching you undress
with a silly grin on his face.

201
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:05,332
No, I was watching the birds.

202
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,418
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

203
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:10,921
I think he needs some male help.

204
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,134
- Oh. for crying out...
- No, Dad, just give him a minute.

205
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:19,763
- Okay, kid. Listen, I'm coming in, okay?
- No, no. Don't.

206
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:23,309
Now, exactly what the hell is the situation?
What, did you shit yourself?

207
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:25,269
Oh, I wish.

208
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,396
I got it stuck.

209
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:29,857
You got what stuck?

210
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:34,570
It.

211
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:40,659
Well, listen, it's not the end of the world.
These kind of things happen.

212
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,329
Let's have a look at it.

213
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,584
Oh, for God and heaven's sake!

214
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,921
- Quiet.
- Sheila.

215
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,424
- No.
- Sheila, honey?

216
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:55,967
Don't...

217
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:59,929
Sheila. honey, you gotta come here.
You gotta see this.

218
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,931
- What is it?
- What? No.

219
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,559
- Come in here. honey.
- No. No, don't.

220
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,937
Don't worry, she's a dental hygienist.
She'll know what to do.

221
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:10,690
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mrs. Jensen. How are you?

222
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,360
- You okay?
- Yeah.

223
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:15,111
Holy shit.

224
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,947
- Charlie, you could have warned me.
- Keep it down.

225
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:19,783
- Okay, I...
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Jensen.

226
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,160
I don't want Mary to...
I don't want her to hear.

227
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,204
Yeah. Let's just relax here, okay?

228
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:30,377
Now, what exactly
are we looking at here?

229
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:35,048
- What do you mean? What...?
- Well, I mean, is it the?

230
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,592
Or the?

231
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:40,303
- Is it the frank or the beans?
- Right.

232
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,100
I don't know. It looks like...
I think it's a little bit of both.

233
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:49,062
- Franks and beans. Franks and beans.
- Warren, quiet.

234
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:52,941
- What's that bubble there?
- What do you think? It's a...

235
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:56,612
Well, how the hell did you get the beans
above the frank? I mean...

236
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,740
I don't know. It wasn't like
it was a well-thought-out plan.

237
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:03,411
You know, there really does seem to be
a lot of skin coming through there...

238
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:06,247
...so I'm gonna find some Bactine, honey.

239
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,749
No. You know what?
I don't need any. Really.

240
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:11,460
- Hello there.
- Oh, Christ.

241
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,421
What the hell's going on here?

242
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:18,467
- Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
- Well, you're looking at him.

243
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,554
You gotta take a look at this thing.

244
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:25,307
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ain't it a beaut?

245
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:29,979
What the hell were you thinking?

246
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:33,441
How the hell did you get the zipper
all the way to the top?

247
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:36,444
Well, let's just say the kid's limber.

248
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,866
- Christ. What the...? God.
- You okay?

249
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:45,035
Somebody's gonna have to move
that station wagon so I can get in.

250
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:46,954
- Lenny, come here.
- Who...?

251
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:51,250
Take a look at what this numbnuts did.

252
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,627
Holy shit.

253
00:17:57,674 --> 00:18:00,801
Mike, Eddie, get down here quick.
Bring everybody. Bring a camera.

254
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:03,471
You're not gonna believe this.
We got a kid down here...

255
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:05,932
- What's your name?
- No, I...

256
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,768
No, there's only one thing to do here.

257
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:12,481
What? No. You know what? I got an idea.
Look. Look, I can just...

258
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:16,401
We don't have to do anything. because,
look, I can just wear this over the front.

259
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,779
- I can go to the prom, deal with it later.
- Son, relax.

260
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:22,199
You already laid the tracks.
That's the hard part.

261
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:23,950
Now we're just gonna back it up.

262
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:26,328
Teddy, be brave.

263
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:29,498
It's just like pulling off a Band-Aid.

264
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,211
A one and a two...

265
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:35,962
...and a...

266
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,049
- We got a bleeder.
- Keep the pressure on it. Keep it on.

267
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,384
Everybody get out of the way.

268
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,974
- He was masturbating.
- People, please move out of the way.

269
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:51,811
- Please, move. This is serious, people.
- He was masturbating.

270
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:54,731
- Move out of the way.
- None of this ever happened to Woogie.

271
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,150
Are you okay. Ted?

272
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:01,530
- Ted.
- He was masturbating.

273
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:06,284
- My God. are you all right?
- Killer.

274
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,291
Okay. Okay, Ted.

275
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,087
- Okay, let's roll.
- All right, folks, it's over. Go home.

276
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,838
Let's go. It's over.

277
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:31,102
So anyway,
school ended a couple of days later...

278
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:36,190
...and her father
got transferred to Florida in July.

279
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:40,778
So I worked all summer
to pay off those debts and...

280
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,490
...well, I never saw Mary again.

281
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,535
That was, what?

282
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:52,873
- Thirteen years ago.
- Well, that's very interesting.

283
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:57,211
Anyway, I know it's not the type of thing
you'd forget, but I guess I just...

284
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,671
I kind of, you know...

285
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,799
I must have blocked it out of my head
or something...

286
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,427
...because I was driving down the highway
last week...

287
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:08,931
...and I started thinking about Mary.
and all of a sudden...

288
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:12,768
...it was like I couldn't breathe.
I mean, I was... I was...

289
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:15,271
I felt like I was gonna die.

290
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,442
So I pulled off the road
and I just sort of stopped in this...

291
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,698
I guess it was a rest area.
I was just kind of shaking. and...

292
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,244
You know,
rest areas are homosexual hangouts.

293
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,457
Highway rest areas.

294
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:39,463
They're the bathhouses of the '90s
for many, many, many gay men.

295
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,969
So, what are you...?

296
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,181
What are you saying?

297
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,353
Time, she's up.

298
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,231
We'll delve into that next week.

299
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:02,986
He called you gay?

300
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,240
Well, he implied it.

301
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:11,536
Well, you know, you are a writer,
and writers are artists.

302
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,914
And, you know, most artists are...

303
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:17,834
...a little kind of... A little foofy.
A little, you know...

304
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,712
Foofy and woofy?

305
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:25,384
Let me ask you a question.
When you smoke a cigar...

306
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:29,137
...do you ever pretend it has balls?
You know, like go:

307
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:33,643
Well, I mean, I have.

308
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,687
Haven't you?

309
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:42,694
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna set you up
with my new assistant at work.

310
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:44,404
You're gonna love her.

311
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:49,659
I don't know.
Let's face it, Dom. I'm in a slump.

312
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:52,578
I mean, lately I've been feeling like...

313
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,247
Like...

314
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:57,208
Like a loser.

315
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,673
A loser?
What the hell are you talking about?

316
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:08,094
Jesus, do you remember five years ago
when your kidneys failed?

317
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,721
Now, if you were a loser...

318
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:12,807
...would they have found a donor
with a tissue match so quickly?

319
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:16,394
I don't think so. What are the odds
of that, one in a million? Jesus.

320
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:19,439
Great. So I'm lucky because
my brother died in an explosion?

321
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:23,901
I didn't say that. I said you're lucky
those kids found his kidneys.

322
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:27,363
Look, your brother Jimmy
never gave a shit about you anyway.

323
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:33,911
Look, come on, man, you're a real
glass-is-half-empty kind of guy.

324
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,999
You, sir, have got a fucking guardian angel.
You come here.

325
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,963
So I chili-dipped, three putt at the 18th.
I lost it six ways.

326
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:44,923
- He's a lucky bastard.
- Yeah, well.

327
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:48,761
Hey, guys. I thought you might like
some of these with your beers.

328
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:52,097
- Yes, indeed. Ted, help yourself.
- I don't think I'm gonna have one.

329
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:53,932
- Thanks, though.
- You don't want one?

330
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,976
What do you want?
You want something else?

331
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:58,437
- Come on. You want something to eat?
- Not hungry.

332
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:02,566
You sure? You want a cookie? Something
like that? Honey, we got cookies?

333
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:04,943
No, we don't, but, you know,
I could bake some.

334
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:07,571
- No, no, no. Don't bake any.
- No, that's a good idea.

335
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:11,200
- Bake some. Bake some Toll Houses.
- Oh, great. Yeah, yeah.

336
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:14,828
- Chocolate chip or butterscotch?
- Let's go with the chocolate chip.

337
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:17,998
- Really, you don't... It's...
- No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

338
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,542
- Really. She loves this kind of thing.
- Really?

339
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,085
- Yeah.
- See, that's great.

340
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:25,297
That's what I want.

341
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,885
A family and somebody to, you know...

342
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:35,349
It must be wonderful having all this.

343
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:38,727
Each day is better than the next.

344
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:43,273
How about you? The big L?

345
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:45,984
- Ever been?
- What?

346
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:47,653
In love.

347
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:50,822
Well, once.

348
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:52,951
Mary.

349
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:55,912
Oh, God. Not Mary again.

350
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,834
Look. I know it was brief,
but it was definitely love, Dom.

351
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:04,837
I mean, crushes don't last
for 13 years, right?

352
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:06,965
Whatever happened to Mary?

353
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:09,551
Told you, she moved with her family
to Miami.

354
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:11,052
So why don't you look her up?

355
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:15,139
I did once. I called. She wasn't listed.

356
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:18,101
So that's it? You get one bump in the road
and give up?

357
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,770
Well, it's probably for the best.
After 13 years...

358
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:22,939
...she's probably gonna think
I'm a stalker.

359
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:26,109
You know what you should do?
Hire a private investigator.

360
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:28,945
To find her, follow her around.
She won't know anything.

361
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:31,739
No way. That's way too creepy.

362
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:36,327
Besides, she's probably married with
a couple of kids by now. Girls like Mary...

363
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,788
...they don't stay single.

364
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,752
Hey, I've got an idea. There's this guy
down in my office. His name's Healy.

365
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,505
He's a claims investigator.
He's a hell of a bloodhound.

366
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:50,842
He shoots down to Miami
every couple of weeks. He can help you out.

367
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,845
This guy runs a little hot,
but he gets the job done.

368
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:59,017
So...

369
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:03,856
...Dom tells me you're looking for
some lady friend you knew back at school.

370
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:05,941
Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,612
That's cute. I don't buy it, but it's cute.

372
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:11,905
You're not buying what?

373
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:16,660
Ted, I'm the kind of guy
who likes to shoot from the hip.

374
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,290
I want you to level with me.

375
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,798
Come on, let's talk.
Did you knock this skirt up?

376
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:31,258
No.

377
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:36,263
- She's blackmailing you, right?
- Blackmailing me? No.

378
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:40,267
- You want her dead, don't you?
- Dead?

379
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,978
Are you...? You're not serious, are you?

380
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:46,523
You expect me to believe
this is a straight stalker case? Come on.

381
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:49,610
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not a stalker.
I'm not a stalker, all right?

382
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:52,029
- She's a friend of mine.
- Oh, sure she is.

383
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:54,615
That explains why
she's got an unlisted number...

384
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:57,159
...and you haven't heard squat from her
in 13 years.

385
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:58,911
Yeah, real chum.

386
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,122
- What...?
- You're good, Ted. Real piece of work.

387
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,626
What are you...? You know what?
Forget it. Just forget the whole thing.

388
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:07,920
Okay, I'll do it.

389
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,634
But if this chick turns up with a toe tag,
I'm rolling over on you, big guy.

390
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:15,720
All right.

391
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:36,032
Healy, you dog.

392
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,535
Sully. Look at you.

393
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:41,663
You hot shit. You look fucking pisser.

394
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:44,833
Hey. Hey, good fella.

395
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,001
- Does he bite?
- A little bit.

396
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:48,545
Get in.

397
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:55,051
- Here's the info you asked for.
- Thanks.

398
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:58,555
You know, you should thank me.
That girl was not easy to find.

399
00:26:58,723 --> 00:27:01,766
What, did she scam you
out of some insurance dough?

400
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:06,521
No. Some guy gave me a couple bucks
to track down his high school girlfriend.

401
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:08,481
Stalker, huh?

402
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:11,276
Yep. Big time.

403
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:16,948
You would not believe
all the pussy down here.

404
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:19,701
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

405
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:22,037
- Yeah? You getting any?
- Nothing.

406
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,500
There you go.

407
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,838
- Hey, shoes off.
- What the...?

408
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:34,049
Are you kidding me?

409
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:38,220
You... You are so full of...
Look at this place.

410
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:40,389
- Yeah, I'm doing okay.
- Doing okay?

411
00:27:40,557 --> 00:27:42,892
I gotta get ready for work.

412
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:46,437
This pad, those killer wheels.

413
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:49,106
Man, it looks like
you really cleaned up your act.

414
00:27:49,274 --> 00:27:52,693
Yeah, what can I tell you?
It's a healthier lifestyle down here.

415
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:56,447
It's easier to succeed, you know.
when your head is clear.

416
00:27:56,615 --> 00:28:00,284
- Yeah.
- Those guys back in Boston?

417
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:03,496
Oh, fucking animals.

418
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:09,960
Hey, what do you say we go out and grab
a couple of pops before you go to work?

419
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:14,173
None for me, buddy.
I don't drink anymore.

420
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:17,551
Yeah, you don't drink any less, right?

421
00:28:20,138 --> 00:28:21,764
What the...?

422
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:27,019
That's Bill.
Don't worry. I fed him last week.

423
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:30,981
- Does he bite?
- Nips.

424
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,451
Nineteen months I've been straight.

425
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:45,080
Is that right? Good for you. Sully.

426
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:49,793
Yeah, it was hard at first,
but I'm there, I'm there.

427
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:52,671
Hey, I'm proud of you.
How about a frosty to celebrate?

428
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,632
Didn't you hear what I just said?

429
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:00,053
Sully, you were never an alky.
You were a cokehead.

430
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:04,140
Yeah, but when you quit the nose candy,
you gotta quit the booze too.

431
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:08,728
Who told you that? Sully, it's one...
It's a lite beer.

432
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:12,190
Oh, the big, bad beer's gonna get you.

433
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,153
- It's you I'm worried about.
- You're worried about me?

434
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:20,615
Yeah. You gotta bend a little bit,
or believe me. you're gonna break.

435
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:23,159
- You think?
- Oh, yeah.

436
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,914
You gotta learn to have a pop once in
a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon.

437
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:30,250
You're being a fanatic.

438
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:34,170
Well, jeez...

439
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:37,841
...I don't wanna fall off the wagon.
- No.

440
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:42,805
- I mean, not after 19 months.
- Exactly.

441
00:29:56,695 --> 00:30:00,781
Jesus, you know what? This shit
doesn't even taste good to me anymore.

442
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:03,618
Fuck you then, you big pussy.
I'll drink it.

443
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,980
Looks like we found your Mary, Ted.

444
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,816
Husband: negative.

445
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,946
Children and a Labrador: negative.

446
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:44,325
Tight little package: affirmative.

447
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:53,335
Good morning, Magda.

448
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,171
- Hi, doll. You're in my light.
- Sorry.

449
00:30:58,383 --> 00:31:02,094
- So you've been out here all night again?
- Bet your ass I have.

450
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,805
This is an important job,
neighborhood watch is.

451
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,724
Neighborhood watch.
Is that what we're calling it?

452
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:11,436
Listening to perfect strangers'
telephone conversations.

453
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:15,774
This only picks up cellular phones
in a half-a-mile radius.

454
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:17,859
Meaning?

455
00:31:18,027 --> 00:31:21,780
These are the people you live amongst.
You got a right to know if they're creeps.

456
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:25,117
For instance, do you know the guy
in the green house down the street?

457
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:26,326
Yeah.

458
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,120
Cheating on his wife.

459
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:32,708
And I am not surprised.
I am not surprised at all...

460
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,919
...because Puffy used to bark his balls off
whenever he saw him.

461
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:39,297
And you know that Puffy,
he only barks at the bad people.

462
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:41,758
Okay.

463
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,929
Well, I'm gonna go hit some golf balls
and hook up with Warren...

464
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,597
...so try to get some sleep.

465
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:51,143
- Okay. Bye, doll.
- May I make a suggestion?

466
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,813
Try not drinking so early in the morning
because you smell like a gin mill.

467
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,984
I smell like a gin mill?

468
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:04,824
Does Mommy?
Does Mommy smell like a gin mill?

469
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:12,582
Hello.

470
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:22,675
Hey, Herb. How's it going?
Apple for you today.

471
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:24,177
Thanks, Mary.

472
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:27,555
- Have a good day. See you later.
- Looking good, honey.

473
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,755
- Hi, Mary.
- Hey, Mrs. Bailey. How you doing?

474
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:03,257
Looks like we got a jock on our hands.

475
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:13,185
- Here, you want the sports page?
- Thank you.

476
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:16,772
- Take care now.
- Bye, guys. See you.

477
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,463
Yeah. Remember, I have two. Mary.

478
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:45,050
Yeah. You can have two halves.
just like everybody else.

479
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:47,094
Yeah, that's good.

480
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:50,931
- Will you marry me. Mary?
- I would love to, Jimmy.

481
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:54,935
But I'm already engaged to Freddie.

482
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,772
- Who's Freddie? Me?
- Yes, you.

483
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:01,066
Will you marry me?

484
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:05,404
What about Dolores?
You gonna marry us both?

485
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:07,197
I'm gonna kiss you.

486
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,492
I think you're making out
pretty well there. Okay.

487
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:14,621
- Thanks, Mary.
- You're welcome, Zack.

488
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:17,207
- No onions.
- No onions.

489
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,418
No onions. How are you doing?

490
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,256
Listen to this one.

491
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:27,468
"Seeking sensitive Wasp doctor
to share candlelit dinners...

492
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:30,305
...long walks in Coconut Grove,
marriage."

493
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:33,808
Is she looking for a corpse?
You have to be specific when you write.

494
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:38,229
You have to say
"Seeking deaf-mute with, you know...

495
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:40,315
...3-pound cock and trust fund."

496
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:46,571
I want a guy who can play 36 holes
and still have enough energy...

497
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,365
...to take me and Warren to a ball game
and eat hot dogs.

498
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:53,328
I'm talking sausage hot dogs, beer.
Not lite beer, but beer.

499
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:54,787
That's my ad. Print it up.

500
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:59,751
A fatty who likes beer and golf.

501
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:02,837
Jeez, Mary.
where are you gonna find a gem like that?

502
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:07,091
Okay, well, here's the catch.

503
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:09,302
He has to be self-employed.

504
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:10,720
Like a drug dealer?

505
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:17,393
No, I was thinking along the lines, maybe,
of somebody like an architect or something.

506
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:20,855
But I want somebody
with freedom in their job, you know?

507
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:25,235
Somebody who can do it anywhere
and just leave at a drop of a hat.

508
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:29,405
And where would you
and your beer-bellied architect be going to?

509
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:31,533
- The Super Bowl?
- Yeah.

510
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,952
That's good.

511
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,287
I don't know.
Maybe a few months in Nepal.

512
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:36,705
Nepal.

513
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:39,959
And you'd probably dump the poor guy
halfway to Katmandu.

514
00:35:40,627 --> 00:35:41,961
What's that supposed to mean?

515
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:45,047
- It means you change your mind too much.
- No, I don't.

516
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:46,382
Come off it, Mary.

517
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:49,093
Remember that gorgeous,
corn-fed white boy, honey...

518
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,804
...that you just dumped
like yesterday's garbage?

519
00:35:51,972 --> 00:35:53,472
What was his name? Pack man.

520
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,060
Okay, we had fun for a while.

521
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:01,522
Mary, cut the crap.
What really happened with Brett?

522
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,899
Yeah. Brett seemed so sweet.

523
00:36:05,402 --> 00:36:08,570
You know what Tucker said
Brett told him?

524
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:11,240
He said that if Warren wasn't in my life...

525
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:14,076
...that he would have popped the question
a long time ago.

526
00:36:15,036 --> 00:36:17,079
- Oh, man.
- What a shock.

527
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:20,541
To hell with Brett, you know?

528
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:23,961
I've got a vibrator.

529
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:34,138
- Hello?
- Hello?

530
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:37,307
- Sully?
- Hello?

531
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:41,604
- Sully, is that you?
- May I ask who's calling, please?

532
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:45,400
Sully, it's me, Healy.
What's going on over there?

533
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:49,654
Fucking Patrick Healy.
You think your shit don't stink.

534
00:36:49,822 --> 00:36:51,489
Well, I got news for you.

535
00:36:51,657 --> 00:36:54,784
You're goddamn right it don't.

536
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:58,121
Hey, I wanna thank you for the other day.

537
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:01,666
You really helped me. You were right.

538
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,752
Hold, please.

539
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:08,465
I haven't even wanted a beer.

540
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,176
- How are you, buddy?
- I'm fine.

541
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:15,972
I just wanted to let you know I'll have
your car back to you in a couple hours.

542
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,309
- I'm still staking out this broad's apartment.
- Hey.

543
00:37:19,477 --> 00:37:24,314
Well, you were right.
I was uptight. I was...

544
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:26,608
...tight.

545
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:31,154
You know who I miss?
Those guys in Boston.

546
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,035
Hold on a sec.

547
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:55,221
Those are the plays of the month.
Thank you for joining us.

548
00:37:55,388 --> 00:38:00,351
Look forward to seeing you next Sunday
on The Sports Machine. Have a good week.

549
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:13,364
Oh, yeah.

550
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,742
Here comes the money shot.

551
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:28,712
First chink in the armor, Ted.

552
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,386
Shit.

553
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,182
Oh, yeah.

554
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:50,568
Pop, you wanna get me a whiskey sour
when you get a sec?

555
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:51,777
Whiskey sour
coming up.

556
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:55,531
- I got some excellent news for you.
- Oh, yeah? Excellent?

557
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:59,786
- I think your life's about to change.
- Really? So you found her?

558
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:06,418
Oh, yeah. And you were right, man.
She really is something else. My God.

559
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:11,089
Really? So she hasn't changed at all. huh?

560
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:16,052
Well, that I couldn't say.
Let me ask you something.

561
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,973
Was Mary a little big-boned
back in high school?

562
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:23,727
Big-boned? No, no, not at all. No.

563
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,688
I guess she packed on a few pounds
over the years.

564
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:29,524
Oh, yeah? So she's a little...?
She's a little chubby?

565
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:32,444
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
Not bad.

566
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,947
My. A deuce and a half, huh?

567
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,533
Well, you know,
you shit out a bunch of kids...

568
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:41,161
...and you're bound to put on
a few pounds.

569
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,997
So she's...? She's married?

570
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:46,750
No, no, she's never been.
That's the good news.

571
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:48,877
Yeah.

572
00:39:49,045 --> 00:39:52,380
Four kids, three different guys,
but no rock.

573
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:54,299
Hyperactive little fuckers too.

574
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:57,469
Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair,
I bet.

575
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,014
She's in a wheelchair?
Mary's in a wheelchair?

576
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:03,558
I thought that was part of your kick.

577
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:06,311
- Excuse me, I ordered a whiskey sour.
- Yeah, whatever.

578
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:09,315
Are you sure it's the same Mary?
You got the right person?

579
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:12,485
Oh, yeah. It's Mary, all right.
The brother, Warren?

580
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:15,154
Hey, don't look so shocked, Ted.

581
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:20,368
It's been a long time. I bet you've changed
a lot over the last 13 years, haven't you?

582
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:24,997
- What, do you think your shit don't stink?
- No, I don't think... I mean, yesm it doe...

583
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,667
- I don't...
- Okay, I got all the information you need.

584
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:30,169
I got it off her bookie. Nice guy.

585
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:34,507
You really should look her up, Ted.
I mean, she's a real spark plug, this one.

586
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:38,302
Well, thank you.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.

587
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,890
Ted, don't you want the name
of the housing project?

588
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:46,435
What?

589
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:47,645
- for 1995.

590
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,273
See the Sarone boys
on Route 1 in South Brattleboro...

591
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,068
...and right here on Jefferson Boulevard
in Warwick, you'll be...

592
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:11,127
Well, it hurts from the bottom

593
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:14,672
And it hurts down to your soul

594
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,802
That's because true love is not nice

595
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:23,974
And it brings up hurt

596
00:41:24,142 --> 00:41:27,644
From when you were 5 years old

597
00:41:27,812 --> 00:41:31,732
That's because true love is not nice

598
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,525
No

599
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:38,363
Oh, pain. pain. pain

600
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:41,575
Ain't that just love's name?

601
00:41:41,743 --> 00:41:47,122
Love can bring up hurt
From way down low

602
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:51,251
It now be emphasized

603
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:55,297
True love is just not civilized

604
00:41:55,465 --> 00:41:57,841
True love is not nice

605
00:41:58,009 --> 00:41:59,968
No, no

606
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:08,435
Where are you going?

607
00:42:09,812 --> 00:42:13,940
- Oh. I resigned.
- Good luck in Miami, Pat.

608
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:17,986
Miami? What are you doing in Miami?

609
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,239
I took a job offer.

610
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:22,949
With who?

611
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:26,787
With Rice-a-Roni.

612
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,124
Isn't that the San Francisco treat?

613
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,043
It was.

614
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,213
- They're changing their image.
- Yeah, well, listen.

615
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,799
- I've been thinking about what you said.
- Good, good.

616
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:41,302
And I still wanna look her up.

617
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,181
Who? Roller pig? Are you nuts?

618
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:48,810
I thought you said
she was a real spark plug.

619
00:42:48,977 --> 00:42:52,772
No, no, I said butt plug. She's heinous.

620
00:42:55,818 --> 00:42:58,820
You know what?
All the same. I think I wanna call her.

621
00:42:58,987 --> 00:43:01,072
I mean, I know it sounds crazy...

622
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,491
...but, I don't know.
maybe I can help her out.

623
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:07,453
I feel bad, you know. The poor thing.
she's in a wheelchair for God's sakes.

624
00:43:07,621 --> 00:43:12,291
- It's a bunion. It'll heal.
- Bunion? You... I thought...

625
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,086
You know what? That's not even it.
The point is, I just...

626
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:20,883
I know this doesn't make sense to you,
but I can't just turn it off that fast.

627
00:43:23,345 --> 00:43:26,556
I guess I still have feelings for her.

628
00:43:27,683 --> 00:43:30,518
This girl really means something
to you, huh?

629
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:36,190
All right.

630
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:38,402
Tell you what.

631
00:43:39,696 --> 00:43:42,448
I'll get you her number
as soon as she gets back from Japan.

632
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:44,783
Thank you, I appreciate...

633
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:49,037
Japan? What's happening in Japan?
Why is she going to Japan?

634
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:52,541
You've heard of mail-order brides,
haven't you?

635
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:56,003
- Well, they go that way too.
- Mary's a?

636
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:58,505
What are they, desperate? She's a whale.

637
00:43:58,673 --> 00:44:03,010
Don't forget, it's a sumo culture.
They pay by the pound there.

638
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:06,221
Sort of like tuna.

639
00:44:07,724 --> 00:44:09,725
What happened to...?
You said she was single.

640
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:13,937
- Remember, no rock?
- You had your window, Ted. You blew it.

641
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:18,859
I had my window?

642
00:44:20,862 --> 00:44:24,907
I'm sorry, buddy. It's just, you know,
you're taking this all wrong.

643
00:44:25,074 --> 00:44:28,619
Okay? I mean, come on, you're liberated.
I feel liberated.

644
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:32,372
I mean, you're in therapy thinking
you blew it with the greatest girl ever...

645
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,584
...and it turns out that getting your dick
stuck in your zipper...

646
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:37,961
...was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

647
00:44:38,129 --> 00:44:41,381
- Say it a little louder?
- I'm sorry, but it was.

648
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:44,927
I never told you that.

649
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,681
Christ, Ted. I was only four towns away.

650
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:51,559
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sure, sweetheart.

651
00:44:51,727 --> 00:44:52,852
Oh, man, I gotta go.

652
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,773
I gotta get up at 6 a.m. and help
my boss's brother move into his apartment.

653
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:01,027
- Your boss's brother? Who's that?
- I don't even know. I never met him.

654
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:04,447
Ted, you gotta finish that novel
so you can quit that stupid magazine.

655
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:05,782
Yeah.

656
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,831
Nice swing.

657
00:45:21,382 --> 00:45:23,216
Christ, hit a house.

658
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,135
I haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

659
00:45:31,517 --> 00:45:34,018
Would you mind giving me
some pointers here?

660
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:38,231
Yeah, sure.
Don't talk in someone's backswing.

661
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:40,942
Oh, thanks.

662
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:45,321
- I'm gonna go get a soda. You want one?
- No, thanks.

663
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:53,204
Look. I'm sorry to bother you again,
but you got change of a dollar?

664
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:55,248
No.

665
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:58,627
All I got are these damn Nepalese coins.

666
00:46:02,632 --> 00:46:04,341
You've been to Nepal?

667
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:09,179
Not in months.

668
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:11,932
I don't even know why
I bought the damn place.

669
00:46:18,315 --> 00:46:23,027
- Nice meeting you again.
- You too, again.

670
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,739
So, what's your name?

671
00:46:27,866 --> 00:46:29,700
Pat Healy.

672
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:33,996
Wanna know mine?

673
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,041
I already know it, Mary.

674
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:39,710
How'd you know that?

675
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:43,380
Because it's right there on your golf bag.

676
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:51,889
Damn.

677
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:55,267
Wow, are those blueprints?

678
00:46:55,435 --> 00:47:00,397
Oh, these? They're just some projects
I'm working on.

679
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:03,942
Museum, hospital for kids.

680
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,778
Really? Are you an architect?

681
00:47:06,404 --> 00:47:09,658
Just till I get my PGA tour card.

682
00:47:10,534 --> 00:47:15,830
No, I mean, are they putting up
some sort of a new museum in town, or?

683
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:19,501
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of burnt-out on talking about it.

684
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:21,753
Oh, I'm sorry.

685
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:24,339
It's just a job, really.
Something to keep me moving.

686
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,677
- My real passion is my hobby.
- Really? What's that?

687
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:30,929
I work with retards.

688
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:36,017
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

689
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:38,353
Well, the hell with that.

690
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:41,940
No one's gonna tell me
who I can and can't work with, right?

691
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:45,735
- No, I mean...
- We got this one kid, Mongo.

692
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:49,114
He's got a forehead like
a drive-in movie theater. He's a good shit...

693
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:51,157
...so we don't bust his chops too much.

694
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:55,120
- So one day, Mongo gets out of his cage...
- What, they keep him in a cage?

695
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:58,623
- Well, it's just an enclosure.
- No, but they keep him confined?

696
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:00,834
- Right, yeah.
- That's bullshit.

697
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,293
Well, that's what I said.

698
00:48:02,461 --> 00:48:05,505
- So I went out and I got him a leash.
- A leash?

699
00:48:05,673 --> 00:48:09,968
Yeah, one you can hook on to the
clothesline and he can run back and forth...

700
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:15,682
...and there's plenty of room
for him to dig and play.

701
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,270
That kid has really...
He's really blossomed, you know?

702
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,897
Now I can take him to movies...

703
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,483
...baseball games.

704
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,652
You know, fun stuff.

705
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,072
- Yeah.
- Sounds cool.

706
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,576
Oh, yeah, it's cool for them.
but for me, it's much more than that.

707
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,871
For me, it's heaven, you know?

708
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,542
Those goofy bastards are just about
the best thing I've got going in this...

709
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,128
...crazy world.

710
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,843
Hey, dipshit,
be careful with that thing, will you?

711
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:53,763
- What?
- You heard me.

712
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,932
You already put a fucking nick
in my piano.

713
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,186
Well, I'll try to be a little more careful.

714
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,397
What, are you fading?
You wimping out on me?

715
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,901
It's just that this is a little bit heavy,
that's all.

716
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:10,321
Heavy? What I wouldn't give
to know what heavy feels like...

717
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,072
...you insensitive prick.

718
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,327
- No, I didn't mean that.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm going down the street...

719
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,746
...to get coffee.
- Wait. I'll get you the coffee.

720
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,624
Could you just...? Hey, I'm sorry.

721
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,057
Hey, you!

722
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:40,101
You with the furniture. Hey.

723
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,772
- I'm Steve Tyler with The Troubleshooters.
- Oh, yeah. Hey.

724
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,525
Do you know your truck
is parked in a handicapped zone?

725
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,903
- Oh, it's okay. The guy who...
- You don't look very handicapped to me.

726
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:53,907
- Why would you do something like that?
- I'm not handicapped, but the guy who has...

727
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:57,410
Are you getting this?
Make sure you get a close-up on his face.

728
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,413
There's a handicapped guy,
he's got an electric wheelchair.

729
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:04,376
There's a disabled schmuck who's
in a wheelchair. He's coming back.

730
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:12,425
Tender fascial tissue left of L7.

731
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:16,012
Hey, Bob?

732
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,598
Remember Mary?

733
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,101
Oh, yeah.

734
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,603
I remember Mary.

735
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:28,149
Hey, I saw her a couple months ago
at a convention in Las Vegas.

736
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,652
How could you see her at a convention?

737
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,572
Well, I'm a chiropractor.
she's an orthopedic surgeon.

738
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,282
She's a what?

739
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:40,830
She's an orthopedic surgeon.
and... she's still a fox.

740
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:45,167
What if the families
don't want a class action?

741
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:49,380
God, that's what I've been trying to explain
to you people for the last hour.

742
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:52,008
Okay. fine, we'll go over it again. I...

743
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:53,175
Mary's a fox.

744
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:54,719
- What?
- What?

745
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:56,971
Mary's a fox? What are you...?

746
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:01,434
Folks, here, let's... We'll break up.
We'll spitball this tomorrow, okay?

747
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:05,938
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Mary? My Mary?

748
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:09,066
She's not in Japan.
She has no rug rats running around.

749
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:12,820
My friend says she's a fox.
A surgeon fox.

750
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:15,239
I don't get it. I don't know what you're...
Healy...

751
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:18,034
Think about it.
He never even looked her up down there.

752
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:22,288
He was there closing his deal
with the Rice-a-Roni people the whole time.

753
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,251
What's up with your head?

754
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:31,213
Oh, I get hives
tap-dancing for these idiots.

755
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:33,424
I get a little stressed out.

756
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:37,720
Jeez, you know. I feel like a royal shit
because I set you up with this guy.

757
00:51:40,057 --> 00:51:42,433
You know what you gotta do.
You gotta call her.

758
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,730
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.

759
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:50,484
Yeah. Yeah, okay. ASAP.

760
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:52,736
So who's the lucky guy?

761
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,532
His name's Pat.
Met him at the driving range.

762
00:51:58,284 --> 00:51:59,326
Is he good-looking?

763
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:02,829
He's no Steve Young.

764
00:52:03,706 --> 00:52:04,998
So, what is he like?

765
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:07,918
I don't know.

766
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:10,587
Kind of a mook. A schlep.

767
00:52:10,755 --> 00:52:12,923
Why the hell are you going out
with a schlep?

768
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:18,470
It's not like that, Magda. You know.
it's like that movie Harold and Maude.

769
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:20,847
I don't watch the new ones.

770
00:52:21,015 --> 00:52:24,685
Well, you should because it's probably
the greatest love story of our time.

771
00:52:24,852 --> 00:52:29,690
The point is,
is that love isn't about money...

772
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:32,526
...or social standings or age.

773
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:36,780
It's about two people connecting,
having something in common.

774
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:39,157
You know, kindred spirits.

775
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:42,786
Fuck kindred spirits.
My little Puffy here is gonna tell you...

776
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:46,456
...everything you need to know
about that guy in about two seconds flat.

777
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:49,751
If Puffy starts yapping, he's a loser.

778
00:52:49,919 --> 00:52:54,464
If he likes him, honey,
then you've got yourself a keeper.

779
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:25,413
Yeah, Pufferball likes it
when I rub his belly.

780
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:28,374
That is amazing.

781
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:33,254
He doesn't like anybody.
He never usually likes guys.

782
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:37,008
- He doesn't like bad guys.
- Is that right?

783
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:39,719
He can tell that you're an animal nut.

784
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:43,347
- You are, aren't you?
- You got me pegged.

785
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:47,977
You know, in Nepal.
the villagers there called me kin ton ti...

786
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:53,858
...which means
"noble man who is loved by many animal...

787
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:56,944
...who, in kind, he loveth too."

788
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:01,074
Would you like a cup of tea
or something?

789
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,868
I'd love a brewski if you got one.

790
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:05,536
We can do that.

791
00:54:05,705 --> 00:54:09,208
Hey, Magda.
why don't you help me in the kitchen?

792
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:12,503
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Certainly, of course.

793
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:21,929
Puffer doesn't like bad guys, does he?

794
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:29,436
Puffer?

795
00:54:30,897 --> 00:54:32,564
Puffer, come on, boy.

796
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:35,109
Would you like a little clam dip, doll?

797
00:54:35,276 --> 00:54:38,153
No, thank you.
I'd love a Bundt cake if you have one.

798
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:41,198
- Bundt cake?
- Bundt cake?

799
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:48,747
One, two. three. four. five.

800
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:50,457
One, two. three...

801
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:55,504
Hey, Pat, do you want a Budweiser
or a Heinie?

802
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:57,089
Yeah, whatever.

803
00:54:57,257 --> 00:54:59,633
Come on, Puffer.
Stay away from the light.

804
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:03,762
Okay, I'll just get you a regular.

805
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:35,336
All set?

806
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:44,679
Good pooch.

807
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:48,892
All we had were some Oreos.
How does that sound, honey?

808
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:53,146
Oh, my God.

809
00:55:53,814 --> 00:55:57,525
He's got him wrapped up like a baby.

810
00:55:58,027 --> 00:56:00,987
He was... He was a little chilly.

811
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:05,658
Well, here we are.

812
00:56:05,826 --> 00:56:06,868
- The museum?
- Yeah.

813
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:10,163
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- We will, but I have a surprise.

814
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:13,249
- A surprise?
- Yeah, it's the architecture exhibit.

815
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:15,210
- Architecture exhibit?
- Yeah.

816
00:56:15,377 --> 00:56:19,172
- I gotta eat something or I get the shakes.
- We'll eat in 20 minutes.

817
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,799
My friend Tucker is upstairs.
I want you to meet him.

818
00:56:21,967 --> 00:56:25,387
- He's an architect too. Come on, Yeah.
- Architect?

819
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:26,889
Tucker.

820
00:56:27,057 --> 00:56:31,143
This is amazing.
This just blows me away.

821
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:35,773
What do you think this falls under?
Is this art deco, or is it art nouveau?

822
00:56:36,816 --> 00:56:39,610
- Deco. Deco, yeah.
- Yeah.

823
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,820
It's beautiful.

824
00:56:42,197 --> 00:56:45,908
Is this...?
Okay, is this a vestibule, or is it a portico?

825
00:56:46,076 --> 00:56:47,534
What is the difference?

826
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:53,249
When you're looking at architecture,
try to visualize the buildings as a whole.

827
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:57,878
You know, try to see them
in their natural state.

828
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:03,717
In their totalitarianism, so to speak.

829
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:08,222
- Stone-crab time. Let's go to Joe's, huh?
- Hey, Tucker.

830
00:57:10,642 --> 00:57:12,393
Mary.

831
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,811
How are you?

832
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:15,938
Good, I'm glad we saw you.

833
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:19,400
Come on, like you mean it.

834
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:22,695
Tucker. This is my friend Pat Healy.

835
00:57:22,862 --> 00:57:25,489
- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
- Same here.

836
00:57:25,657 --> 00:57:28,742
- Pat is an architect as well.
- Oh, really?

837
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:32,288
- Where are your offices?
- Mainly. I work out of Boston.

838
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:34,248
Boston, huh?

839
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:37,752
- Did you get your degree up there?
- You bet.

840
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,213
Really? Where did you study?

841
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:42,132
Harvard.

842
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,427
Then you must have studied
under Kim Green.

843
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:46,845
Well, among others.

844
00:57:48,347 --> 00:57:51,975
You know,
Pat does projects all over the world.

845
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:54,352
Really?
Where would I have seen your work?

846
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,272
Well, have you been to?

847
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,190
Well, let me see.

848
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:02,235
Santiago, Chile?

849
00:58:02,403 --> 00:58:05,697
Twice last year. Which building is yours?

850
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:12,579
- Are you familiar with the soccer stadium?
- Did you build the Estadio Olímpico?

851
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:18,418
No, just down the street.
the Celinto Catayente Towers.

852
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:21,212
It's quite a fine example, in fact.

853
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,339
I recommend next time
you're up that way...

854
00:58:23,507 --> 00:58:28,094
...that you drop in
and take a ganders at it yourself.

855
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,308
- You know, I really should take your card.
- Sure.

856
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:37,437
As I live and breathe.
Will you excuse us for a second?

857
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:41,191
- I'll call you, okay?
- Hey, Earl.

858
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:44,319
Earl Stein, you old sheep-fucker.
How the hell are you?

859
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,280
My name's Brian.

860
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:48,908
Good one. What the hell
are you doing out here, Earl?

861
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:50,743
No, no. My name's Brian.

862
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:52,953
Brian Mone.

863
00:58:54,372 --> 00:58:58,709
Oh, I see. Okay, yeah.
Whatever you say. "Brian."

864
00:58:58,877 --> 00:59:00,669
I'll see you at the office, huh?

865
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,380
I'll tell you some stories
about this weirdo.

866
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:05,925
You know that guy?

867
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,391
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.

868
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,561
Yeah, no problem.
I've been driving for like 15 hours straight...

869
00:59:17,729 --> 00:59:19,605
...so I could use the company.

870
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:24,485
I know what you mean. I've been standing
in the same spot for five and a half hours.

871
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:27,279
You know they made it illegal
to hitchhike in this state?

872
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:31,158
Really? That must make it really tough.

873
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:35,412
So, what's going on with you?
You a salesman, or?

874
00:59:35,831 --> 00:59:40,000
No. No. I'm nothing.

875
00:59:40,168 --> 00:59:41,836
I am.

876
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:44,130
- Yeah?
- I'm a salesman.

877
00:59:44,297 --> 00:59:47,133
- I'm gonna start my own company.
- Really?

878
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,051
You want in?

879
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:54,390
No, I'm not...

880
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,685
I don't really have any.
you know, money, or...

881
00:59:56,853 --> 00:59:59,604
You heard of this thing,
the 8 Minute Abs?

882
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:02,524
Yeah, sure, 8 Minute Abs.
yeah, the exercise video.

883
01:00:02,692 --> 01:00:07,362
Yeah, well, this is gonna blow that
right out of the water. Listen to this.

884
01:00:08,364 --> 01:00:12,033
7 Minute Abs.

885
01:00:14,036 --> 01:00:17,497
Right. Yes, okay, all right.
I see where you're going.

886
01:00:17,665 --> 01:00:21,251
Think about it. You walk into a video store.
see 8 Minute Abs sitting there...

887
01:00:21,419 --> 01:00:25,297
...there's 7 Minute Abs right beside it.
Which one are you gonna pick, man?

888
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:30,385
- I would go for the 7. Yeah.
- Bingo, man, bingo. 7 Minute Abs.

889
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:33,972
And we guarantee just as good
a workout as the 8 Minute folk.

890
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,516
You guarantee it? How do you do that?

891
01:00:36,684 --> 01:00:40,103
If you're not happy
with the first seven minutes...

892
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:43,732
...we're gonna send you
the extra minute free.

893
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,943
See, that's it. That's our motto.
That's where we're coming from.

894
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:48,486
That's from A to B.

895
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,114
That's right. That's good. That's good.

896
01:00:51,908 --> 01:00:54,910
Unless, of course,
somebody comes up with 6 Minute Abs.

897
01:00:55,077 --> 01:00:57,370
Then you're in trouble, huh?

898
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:06,631
No. No, no, not six.

899
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:09,342
I said seven.
Nobody's coming up with six.

900
01:01:09,509 --> 01:01:10,927
Who works out in six minutes?

901
01:01:11,094 --> 01:01:15,348
You won't even get your heart going.
Not even a mouse on a wheel.

902
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:17,433
- Good point.
- Seven's the key number here.

903
01:01:17,601 --> 01:01:20,937
- Think about it. 7-Elevens. seven dwarfs.
- Seven, yeah.

904
01:01:21,104 --> 01:01:23,147
Seven, man, that's the number.

905
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:25,608
Seven chipmunks twirling on a branch...

906
01:01:25,776 --> 01:01:28,319
...eating lots of sunflowers
on my uncle's ranch.

907
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:31,614
You know that old children's tale
from the sea.

908
01:01:31,782 --> 01:01:34,242
It's like you're dreaming
about Gorgonzola cheese...

909
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:38,120
...when it's clearly Brie time, baby.

910
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:40,373
Step into my office.

911
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,626
- Why?
- Because you're fucking fired.

912
01:01:44,336 --> 01:01:46,837
Yeah. You know what? I gotta pee.
I'm gonna pull over.

913
01:01:47,005 --> 01:01:52,009
Your car seats are making me itchy, man.
What are these made out of, cactus?

914
01:01:56,932 --> 01:02:00,851
I'm only waiting seven minutes total.

915
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:13,322
- Hey, wait your turn.
- Sorry, I didn't get a...

916
01:02:15,743 --> 01:02:18,412
- We gotta get out of here.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

917
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,709
- This is a raid.
- No. No, no, no. I was peeing.

918
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:25,836
That's what I was doing.
I was just peeing.

919
01:02:26,004 --> 01:02:28,839
- I was peeing too.
- Yeah, I'm sure you were all just pissing.

920
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:32,843
- Let's go. Let's move it out.
- Let's go. In the truck, everybody.

921
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:38,515
Holy Shit. Jimmy Shay, is that you?

922
01:02:53,448 --> 01:02:56,658
- No, really...
- Oh, my God.

923
01:02:57,035 --> 01:02:58,702
Ted?

924
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:04,583
If you let me talk to you for one second
outside of the truck.

925
01:03:04,751 --> 01:03:08,128
- Into the truck. Get in the truck.
- Look, I still have to pee. I wasn't...

926
01:03:08,296 --> 01:03:09,963
- Let's go.
- Can I have a cup?

927
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:11,757
See, hon? I told you he was gay.

928
01:03:11,924 --> 01:03:16,678
We'll be right back with more Cops,
live from the heartland.

929
01:03:41,663 --> 01:03:43,748
That grandmother of yours
is really something.

930
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,958
Who, Magda?
No, Magda's not my grandmother.

931
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:50,254
She rents the apartment next door.
Her husband died a couple years ago...

932
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:54,050
...and I don't think she likes being alone,
so, you know, she just hangs out.

933
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:57,512
- Doesn't cramp your style?
- Sadly, no.

934
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:02,350
You know, sometimes I wish
I could be like Magda and not go home.

935
01:04:02,726 --> 01:04:07,605
Yeah. I'd like to bounce around for a while
and do some traveling.

936
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:10,733
I don't know why anybody
would wanna bounce around...

937
01:04:10,901 --> 01:04:13,361
...you know,
if they had their own condo in Nepal.

938
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:16,697
- I'd be there in a second.
- I'd sell it.

939
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:19,575
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Start fresh in a new place...

940
01:04:19,743 --> 01:04:21,869
...give up the architect game.

941
01:04:22,037 --> 01:04:26,416
Slow things down a bit.
read more books, see more movies.

942
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,418
Are you a movie buff?

943
01:04:28,585 --> 01:04:32,296
Well, I try to be, but it's tough going
with all the crap they make today.

944
01:04:32,464 --> 01:04:35,592
I guess I just wish they made movies
like they used to make.

945
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,388
You know, classics like The Karate Kid
or Harold and Maude.

946
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:44,893
Harold and Maude
is my all-time favorite movie.

947
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:48,439
- Don't bust my chops. I know it's corny...
- Pat, I'm not kidding.

948
01:04:48,606 --> 01:04:53,110
I think Harold and Maude is one of
the greatest love stories of our time.

949
01:04:56,322 --> 01:04:58,949
Here I thought I was the only one.

950
01:05:00,118 --> 01:05:03,328
You're too good to be true.
Come on, let's go dance.

951
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,254
Hey, guys.

952
01:05:18,344 --> 01:05:19,970
So...

953
01:05:22,015 --> 01:05:27,019
- Yeah, well, I guess this is it. huh?
- I guess.

954
01:05:27,187 --> 01:05:29,855
- I'll see you around.
- Okay.

955
01:05:31,149 --> 01:05:33,525
- Mary?
- Yeah?

956
01:05:34,694 --> 01:05:35,986
- Forget it.
- What?

957
01:05:36,154 --> 01:05:38,989
- No, no, it's stupid.
- What? Come on, you can say it.

958
01:05:39,157 --> 01:05:41,992
- No, really, it's moronic.
- Just say it.

959
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,913
Can I feel your bosoms before I go?

960
01:05:48,918 --> 01:05:50,793
Knock yourself out.

961
01:06:03,432 --> 01:06:07,644
- Okey-doke. So tomorrow night?
- Sure.

962
01:06:18,113 --> 01:06:21,241
Man, they never look like you'd expect.
do they?

963
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:26,621
That's probably how he got his victim
to drop his guard.

964
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:29,832
Where'd they find the body?

965
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:34,087
In a big red bag
on the front passenger seat.

966
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:36,923
All hacked up.

967
01:06:37,258 --> 01:06:39,008
Gruesome.

968
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:42,262
Real psycho, this one.

969
01:06:43,264 --> 01:06:47,100
Hey, you're a little worked up.
Let me do the talking.

970
01:06:50,771 --> 01:06:54,358
- I'm Detective Stabler. This is Krevoy.
- Look, I didn't solicit any sex, okay?

971
01:06:54,526 --> 01:06:55,985
This is a huge misunderstanding.

972
01:06:56,152 --> 01:06:58,946
I was going out to pee.
I'm walking in the bushes...

973
01:06:59,114 --> 01:07:01,865
...I trip over this guy.
and there were all these cops and...

974
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:05,786
Ted, Ted, Ted, it's okay. We believe you.

975
01:07:12,669 --> 01:07:16,755
The problem is,
we found your friend in the car.

976
01:07:18,174 --> 01:07:20,259
Oh, the hitchhiker?

977
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:22,845
That's what this is about? The hitchhiker?

978
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:27,558
Oh, great. Just my luck.

979
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:29,810
I get caught for everything.

980
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:33,856
So you admit it?

981
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:36,942
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

982
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:39,862
Look. I know that you guys
have got a job to do, all right?

983
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,282
And I'm really sorry. I did it, I admit it.

984
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:48,162
You know, the guy even told me.
The hitchhiker told me it was illegal, so...

985
01:07:49,289 --> 01:07:50,831
Well...

986
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:55,085
...can you tell us his name?

987
01:07:59,132 --> 01:08:01,091
No, I didn't catch it.

988
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,764
Can we cut to the chase? I mean,
am I, like, in a lot of trouble here, or?

989
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:08,558
First, tell us why you did it.

990
01:08:08,726 --> 01:08:10,644
Why I did it?

991
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:15,148
I don't know. Boredom?

992
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,235
Guy turns out to be a blabbermouth.

993
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:21,738
Just would not shut up. I mean, just...

994
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:27,285
Ted, this wasn't your first time, was it?

995
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,246
No.

996
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:36,753
- How many are we talking here?
- Hitchhikers? My whole life?

997
01:08:37,755 --> 01:08:42,133
I don't know. Twenty-five. 50.
I mean, who keeps track?

998
01:08:43,094 --> 01:08:45,887
Hey, I know this is the Bible belt,
but where I come from...

999
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,139
...this is not that big a deal.

1000
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:50,100
- I mean...
- You son of a bitch.

1001
01:08:51,268 --> 01:08:53,144
You're gonna fry.

1002
01:08:54,188 --> 01:08:58,775
Hey. Hey. Take it easy. Cut it out.
What the hell are you doing? Take it easy.

1003
01:08:58,943 --> 01:09:01,111
- You okay?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

1004
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:02,320
- You all right?
- Punk.

1005
01:09:02,488 --> 01:09:04,030
Jesus.

1006
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:27,430
Your friend Tucker stopped by.

1007
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:29,473
Really?

1008
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:33,477
Okay. Hey, what does it look like today?

1009
01:09:33,645 --> 01:09:36,272
It's fine. A little crazy in the afternoon.

1010
01:09:37,858 --> 01:09:38,899
Hey, Tucker.

1011
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:41,527
What's up, doc?

1012
01:09:42,988 --> 01:09:45,740
You look different.
Did you do something with your hair?

1013
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:48,951
The teeth. The teeth, I got them capped.

1014
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:51,370
Oh, yeah? Hey, they look great.

1015
01:09:51,538 --> 01:09:55,583
- You don't think they look a little big?
- No, not at all. The bigger the better.

1016
01:09:56,042 --> 01:09:57,460
But they could be brighter.

1017
01:09:57,627 --> 01:10:02,882
There's nothing more sexy to me than a guy
with a mouthful of big pearly whites.

1018
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:04,091
- Really?
- Yeah.

1019
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:07,178
Come here.
You ever had one up the hatch in here?

1020
01:10:07,345 --> 01:10:09,638
- Tucker, behave yourself.
- I'm sorry.

1021
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:14,310
What can I do for you today, my friend?

1022
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:18,355
I wanted to talk to you
about your friend Patrick.

1023
01:10:18,523 --> 01:10:19,690
He's a nice guy, huh?

1024
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:23,403
Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
How long have you known him?

1025
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:25,655
Not very long, but I like him.

1026
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:30,535
Well, I know he's a little different,
but that's what I like about him.

1027
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:33,163
He dresses like a complete dork.

1028
01:10:33,331 --> 01:10:35,707
He chews with his mouth open.

1029
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:40,712
He hardly ever says the right thing,
and he probably farts too.

1030
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:44,549
That's what you're looking for, is it?
A farter?

1031
01:10:44,926 --> 01:10:46,802
No, I'm looking for a guy.

1032
01:10:47,637 --> 01:10:52,140
Look, it's just that something struck me
as strange about him last night.

1033
01:10:52,934 --> 01:10:54,643
He gave me this funny vibe.

1034
01:10:55,311 --> 01:10:57,562
Anyway, I called some friends up north...

1035
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:01,066
...and they've never heard of an architect
named Patrick Healy.

1036
01:11:01,526 --> 01:11:03,819
And he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.

1037
01:11:03,986 --> 01:11:05,529
- Fuck!
- Really?

1038
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:08,740
- That's strange.
- Yes, I thought so.

1039
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:12,202
Anyway, I hope you don't think
I'm being meddlesome.

1040
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:16,122
It's just that I think you should be careful
with this guy, that's all.

1041
01:11:16,874 --> 01:11:18,041
I mean, let's face it.

1042
01:11:18,209 --> 01:11:23,713
You're beautiful, and you've got money,
and you trust people.

1043
01:11:24,173 --> 01:11:26,591
I'm just saying,
there's a lot of psychos out there.

1044
01:11:26,759 --> 01:11:29,135
- Just be careful.
- Fucker.

1045
01:11:29,303 --> 01:11:33,599
Look, Tucker, thank you.
I really appreciate you looking out for me.

1046
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:36,644
Okay, listen, I'll call you.

1047
01:11:36,812 --> 01:11:39,272
- Okay.
- Okay.

1048
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,278
Damn.

1049
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:55,454
- You want me to get those for you?
- No. I have to learn to do this myself.

1050
01:11:59,877 --> 01:12:01,460
Damn.

1051
01:12:03,589 --> 01:12:06,632
My leg. Could you, Mary?

1052
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,677
Thank you.

1053
01:12:10,512 --> 01:12:12,638
Wait. Wait.

1054
01:12:13,932 --> 01:12:15,308
There.

1055
01:12:23,775 --> 01:12:24,859
- See?
- Yeah.

1056
01:12:25,027 --> 01:12:27,653
- I knew I could do it.
- I see. Here, let me get the door.

1057
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:29,155
Thank you.

1058
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:31,073
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

1059
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:33,993
Jane, can you get the door
for Tucker, please?

1060
01:12:34,161 --> 01:12:36,287
Do you...? You want me to?

1061
01:12:36,455 --> 01:12:39,498
- No. I've done this a thousand times.
- Okay.

1062
01:12:46,424 --> 01:12:48,175
Mr. Stroehmann...

1063
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:52,721
...on behalf of the entire South Carolina
Law Enforcement community...

1064
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:57,809
...I would like to apologize to you
for any pain or temporary inconvenience...

1065
01:12:57,977 --> 01:12:59,978
...that you may have been caused.

1066
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:05,859
At approximately 10:40 this morning...

1067
01:13:06,027 --> 01:13:09,446
...a man was apprehended
not far from where you were arrested.

1068
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:12,157
He was identified
as an escaped mental patient...

1069
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:15,577
...and subsequently he confessed
to the murder you're being held for.

1070
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:18,455
Lab tests confirm a fingerprint match.

1071
01:13:18,623 --> 01:13:22,167
You mean I'm free to go?

1072
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:25,003
No harm, no foul.

1073
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:29,633
Oh, by the way,
there's someone there to see you.

1074
01:13:33,972 --> 01:13:35,931
Shut up.

1075
01:13:44,148 --> 01:13:47,192
You are a lucky son of a bitch,
you know that?

1076
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,196
- I am?
- Yeah. Didn't they tell you?

1077
01:13:51,365 --> 01:13:55,576
That hitcher was about to cut your throat
before you decided to take a piss.

1078
01:13:55,744 --> 01:13:57,996
Had a fucking horseshoe up your ass,
my man.

1079
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:05,586
You got that nervous-hive thing again?

1080
01:14:05,963 --> 01:14:11,342
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Ted,
because I got some bad news.

1081
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:14,095
Are you okay?

1082
01:14:17,725 --> 01:14:18,850
Ted, I'm dying.

1083
01:14:23,605 --> 01:14:25,273
Oh, my...

1084
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:30,570
Ted, I'm not dying, man. Come on.

1085
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:33,906
Jesus, it's just the humidity down here
or something. Come on.

1086
01:14:34,074 --> 01:14:37,994
No. No, Ted, the bad news I got
is about our friend Healy.

1087
01:14:38,162 --> 01:14:40,788
I sent my assistant to his apartment
with his last check.

1088
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:42,790
The landlady said when he came back...

1089
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:47,170
...he kept talking about
falling for some doctor named Mary.

1090
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:50,715
- Mary? My Mary?
- Well...

1091
01:14:51,884 --> 01:14:55,845
Ted, here's Healy's address down there.

1092
01:14:56,013 --> 01:15:00,141
In the future, do a little research before
you send a guy like that out into the woods.

1093
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:03,020
I mean, Jesus Chris, it's creepy, okay?

1094
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:07,900
You're not thinking about
going out with this guy again?

1095
01:15:08,068 --> 01:15:10,069
Mary, honey, he's a psycho.

1096
01:15:10,236 --> 01:15:14,490
- Mary, the guy's full of shit.
- Jesus, this sucks.

1097
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:17,159
It's too bad this had to happen.

1098
01:15:17,911 --> 01:15:20,162
He was almost perfect.

1099
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:23,373
Mary, what did you say
Pat's last name was?

1100
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:25,793
- Healy.
- Come here, come here, come here.

1101
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,628
- Come on. You gotta hear this.
- What?

1102
01:15:27,796 --> 01:15:31,340
- That's the way us Healys were raised.
- So where the hell are you, Healy?

1103
01:15:31,508 --> 01:15:34,802
I got a date tonight
with that Mary girl I told you about.

1104
01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:36,512
- The sawbones?
- Yep.

1105
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:39,014
- Oh, my God, we hit the mother lode.
- You guys...

1106
01:15:39,182 --> 01:15:41,391
...should we be listening to this?

1107
01:15:42,185 --> 01:15:45,312
- She still think you're a fucking architect?
- Oh, yeah.

1108
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,106
Dumb shit.

1109
01:15:47,273 --> 01:15:48,482
Mr. Perfect, huh?

1110
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:52,444
Hey, watch your mouth.
She's a great gal, Mary.

1111
01:15:52,612 --> 01:15:57,074
- I'm the dumb shit for lying to her.
- Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

1112
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:58,742
I don't know.

1113
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:02,538
I guess it seems that women today
are more impressed by the almighty buck...

1114
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:07,376
...than some schmo who's spent 17 years
scraping by on Peace Corps wages.

1115
01:16:07,544 --> 01:16:08,585
Jesus, man.

1116
01:16:08,753 --> 01:16:11,381
If she's as special as you say.
she's gonna wanna hear...

1117
01:16:11,549 --> 01:16:12,882
...about the things you did.

1118
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:16,928
"You could tell her about
the irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan.

1119
01:16:17,096 --> 01:16:20,390
The orphan babies
who cried in your arms in...

1120
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:23,101
...Romania.

1121
01:16:23,269 --> 01:16:27,147
The hope you gave Freddy the leper
in Calcutta."

1122
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:29,899
I'll be honest with you.
I'm a selfish prick.

1123
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:33,611
I get a high
from helping all God's creatures.

1124
01:16:34,822 --> 01:16:37,740
An honest-to-goodness high.
I did all those things for myself.

1125
01:16:37,908 --> 01:16:39,742
Hey, hey, hey.

1126
01:16:44,582 --> 01:16:46,749
That's bullshit, man.

1127
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:49,335
Hey. Hey, you were on the front line.

1128
01:16:50,254 --> 01:16:54,424
You remember?
The malaria, the typhoon fever?

1129
01:16:54,592 --> 01:16:58,261
That vicious strain of genital herpes?

1130
01:16:59,597 --> 01:17:01,139
Fuck.

1131
01:17:03,517 --> 01:17:07,729
Yeah, I cured all sorts of horrible illnesses
in Third World countries.

1132
01:17:07,897 --> 01:17:12,066
But the bottom line is, I'm not gonna use
my philanthropy as some kind of currency.

1133
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:14,068
?specially after what I did.

1134
01:17:14,945 --> 01:17:17,363
I lied to that poor girl.

1135
01:17:19,408 --> 01:17:20,743
Lied, man.

1136
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:25,581
Well, love will make you do...

1137
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:27,958
...fucked-up things.

1138
01:17:28,168 --> 01:17:32,421
You said it, mister. I gotta run.

1139
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:35,466
We're dicks.

1140
01:17:41,473 --> 01:17:43,724
Come here, baby.
Come here, sweetheart.

1141
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:47,394
I'll feed you and Bill soon.
Come on, honey.

1142
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:55,110
It's him. It's him.

1143
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:58,113
Oh, hi, Mary.

1144
01:17:58,823 --> 01:18:00,324
Hello.

1145
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:03,202
Mary, look.

1146
01:18:04,955 --> 01:18:07,248
Look, there's something
I have to tell you.

1147
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:09,875
I'm not the architect you...

1148
01:18:17,175 --> 01:18:20,302
- Okay, guys, let's huddle up.
- Come on, Jimmy.

1149
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,346
Jimmy, I'm open. Hit me. Come on.

1150
01:18:33,818 --> 01:18:36,403
Exceptional, my ass.

1151
01:18:48,749 --> 01:18:53,670
Looks like I double-jumped you, Warren,
for the win. Pay up, big guy.

1152
01:18:56,173 --> 01:18:58,717
- Coconut.
- Yeah, very good. Coconut.

1153
01:18:58,884 --> 01:19:00,677
Coconut.

1154
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:02,846
Where's the rest of it, Warren?

1155
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:16,276
Look at her.

1156
01:19:17,069 --> 01:19:21,531
She's more beautiful than I remember.
She's perfect.

1157
01:19:21,866 --> 01:19:25,327
Thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare.
Sorry I forgot my wallet.

1158
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:29,122
- I feel like a dog.
- Don't worry about it. It was fun.

1159
01:19:35,629 --> 01:19:37,630
Fuck me.

1160
01:19:38,966 --> 01:19:41,218
How's my stomach taste?

1161
01:19:41,386 --> 01:19:43,554
"How's my stomach taste," she says.

1162
01:19:43,972 --> 01:19:46,474
Holy shit. Look. Look. There's Warren.

1163
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:48,726
Franks and beans.

1164
01:19:49,144 --> 01:19:51,187
- Frank and beans.
- Warren, you just ate.

1165
01:19:51,354 --> 01:19:54,315
Leave him alone.
He's just got a big appetite. Right, Warren?

1166
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:57,318
I said you got a big...

1167
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:01,447
Warren. Warren, Warren.

1168
01:20:01,907 --> 01:20:03,574
Yes.

1169
01:20:03,742 --> 01:20:06,744
Listen, you can't touch his ears
unless he trusts you. I'm sorry.

1170
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:09,914
- Are you okay?
- Not to worry.

1171
01:20:10,123 --> 01:20:13,417
- So I'll see you tonight, right?
- Sure.

1172
01:20:16,505 --> 01:20:18,464
Come here. Warren. You okay?

1173
01:20:18,632 --> 01:20:20,341
- He broke it.
- I saw.

1174
01:20:21,468 --> 01:20:23,427
Okay. What are you waiting for? Let's go.

1175
01:20:23,595 --> 01:20:26,722
- What? No, I don't know what to say.
- What are you talking about?

1176
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:30,476
Tell her the truth about Healy.
Blow the schmuck out of the water.

1177
01:20:30,644 --> 01:20:32,311
No, I can't.

1178
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,190
I unleashed the psycho on her.
She's gonna be fucking pissed.

1179
01:20:37,317 --> 01:20:40,986
- Mary, Mary.
- No, no. Stop.

1180
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:44,156
Mary?

1181
01:20:46,326 --> 01:20:50,247
Mary? Is that...? It is you.

1182
01:20:51,332 --> 01:20:55,127
- Who is that?
- Hi. It's Ted.

1183
01:20:55,294 --> 01:20:56,670
Ted?

1184
01:20:56,838 --> 01:20:59,381
Yeah, Ted from Rhode Island. Ted.

1185
01:20:59,549 --> 01:21:02,592
Te...? Oh, my God. Ted.

1186
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,345
- Hey. Good, how are you?
- It's good to see you.

1187
01:21:05,513 --> 01:21:07,514
- Good to see you.
- How you been?

1188
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:09,349
I'm...

1189
01:21:09,517 --> 01:21:11,351
I haven't seen you since...

1190
01:21:11,519 --> 01:21:13,395
Yeah, since...

1191
01:21:13,563 --> 01:21:17,482
- Senior prom.
- That's right, senior prom.

1192
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:21,027
You got a great memory.
Oh, man, that was...

1193
01:21:21,195 --> 01:21:23,530
Haven't thought about that in years.
Yeah.

1194
01:21:23,698 --> 01:21:26,491
So how's everything?

1195
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:30,537
- Everything, you know.
- Oh, that's fine.

1196
01:21:30,705 --> 01:21:33,165
I was in and out of the hospital
in a couple of weeks.

1197
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:35,292
It was not a big deal at all.

1198
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:39,212
Now I'm good. Strong like bull. Really good.

1199
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,756
- Hey. Hi, Warren.
- Hi, Ted.

1200
01:21:41,924 --> 01:21:45,135
- How are you?
- I'm... How are you?

1201
01:21:45,887 --> 01:21:49,264
- I can't believe that he remembers you.
- Piggyback ride?

1202
01:21:49,432 --> 01:21:52,767
Oh, piggyb... No. You know what?
I'll take a rain check this time, okay?

1203
01:21:52,935 --> 01:21:54,561
He never remembers anybody.

1204
01:21:54,729 --> 01:21:56,813
- It's amazing.
- Yeah.

1205
01:21:56,981 --> 01:21:58,523
So, what are you doing here?

1206
01:21:58,691 --> 01:22:01,277
- Do you work here, or...?
- Yeah, no, this is my office.

1207
01:22:01,445 --> 01:22:02,737
Well, it's up there.

1208
01:22:03,572 --> 01:22:06,908
So yeah. I was just out
on my lunch break with Warren. It's crazy.

1209
01:22:07,075 --> 01:22:09,702
- What are you doing here?
- Well, that's a funny story.

1210
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:12,205
I was... I decided to...

1211
01:22:12,372 --> 01:22:15,917
I got in the car with my friend.
and we just...

1212
01:22:16,084 --> 01:22:19,754
We came down to Florida, right?

1213
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:24,425
Right.

1214
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,637
Well, you look great.
You look really good.

1215
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:30,598
I mean, what's the story?
Are you married? Do you have kids?

1216
01:22:30,766 --> 01:22:33,434
- No. No. Dodged a few bullets.
- Yeah?

1217
01:22:33,602 --> 01:22:37,647
Yeah. God, this is just so bizarre.

1218
01:22:37,814 --> 01:22:41,859
- I'm standing here with Mary Jensen.
- No, no, now it's Mary Matthews.

1219
01:22:42,027 --> 01:22:43,194
Oh, did you?

1220
01:22:43,362 --> 01:22:46,697
No, no, no. I haven't walked
down that plank yet, no.

1221
01:22:46,865 --> 01:22:49,742
But it was this thing in college.

1222
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:51,786
This creepy guy who...

1223
01:22:51,954 --> 01:22:54,872
Anyhow, there was a restraining order.
it got kind of ugly...

1224
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,459
...and after Princeton, I decided,
"You know what? Be cautious.

1225
01:22:58,627 --> 01:23:01,087
Change your name.
Just kind of leave that behind."

1226
01:23:01,255 --> 01:23:03,214
- Right. Right.
- Just didn't need that.

1227
01:23:03,382 --> 01:23:05,633
- That sounds horrible.
- It was... Yeah.

1228
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:08,970
It was, but it's over, I think, so it's good.

1229
01:23:09,137 --> 01:23:12,474
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Do you think you wanna, I don't know...

1230
01:23:12,642 --> 01:23:15,269
...go out to dinner?
You know, catch up on old times?

1231
01:23:16,062 --> 01:23:17,562
Didn't we just do that?

1232
01:23:21,276 --> 01:23:23,527
I'm fucking with you, Ted.

1233
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:29,366
No, listen, I'd really... I'd like to.

1234
01:23:29,534 --> 01:23:32,995
It'd be great.
but I sort of already have plans tonight.

1235
01:23:33,162 --> 01:23:36,248
- But I'm free tomorrow night.
- Yeah, sure. Or, you know...

1236
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:39,334
Or you could blow off that jerk
you're going out with tonight...

1237
01:23:39,502 --> 01:23:40,752
...and come out with me.

1238
01:23:44,257 --> 01:23:46,508
What hotel are you staying at?

1239
01:23:46,676 --> 01:23:48,302
The Cardozo.

1240
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:52,014
- Pick you up at 8?
- Sure.

1241
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:53,307
- Okay.
- Okay.

1242
01:23:53,474 --> 01:23:56,143
- Cool. See you.
- Bye.

1243
01:23:56,477 --> 01:23:59,104
Look closely at this picture

1244
01:23:59,272 --> 01:24:01,648
Ted and Mary like before

1245
01:24:01,816 --> 01:24:04,109
Can you see her as Ted sees her

1246
01:24:04,277 --> 01:24:06,528
And why he couldn't wait no more?

1247
01:24:06,696 --> 01:24:12,159
And if you still think he's being silly
Then you've still got more to see

1248
01:24:12,327 --> 01:24:16,496
Because this isn't just a date, folks
This is chemistry

1249
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:19,292
And Mary

1250
01:24:19,752 --> 01:24:24,047
Well, there's just something about Mary

1251
01:24:33,223 --> 01:24:35,308
Banana, banana.

1252
01:24:35,476 --> 01:24:38,895
We're gonna be buying bananas tonight.

1253
01:24:39,063 --> 01:24:40,730
Why's that?

1254
01:24:40,898 --> 01:24:47,362
Back when I was your age, I always used to
make myself a big banana split after sex.

1255
01:24:47,529 --> 01:24:49,822
I think you're gonna need one tonight.

1256
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:53,659
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You'll be eating a banana split before I do.

1257
01:24:53,827 --> 01:24:55,745
Don't bet on it.

1258
01:24:56,789 --> 01:24:58,206
Last time I had a Pap smear...

1259
01:24:58,374 --> 01:25:02,085
...the guy needed leather gloves
and an oyster shucker.

1260
01:25:05,089 --> 01:25:07,382
I am a little psyched.

1261
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:11,511
I ran into this guy
I haven't seen since high school.

1262
01:25:12,054 --> 01:25:16,432
- An old flame?
- Kind of. Ted Stroehmann.

1263
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,185
The sweetest guy in the world.

1264
01:25:19,353 --> 01:25:20,603
I mean, he was so cute.

1265
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:25,358
He was so shy and clumsy,
and he had this huge mouth full of metal.

1266
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:27,819
You know how I like braces.

1267
01:25:28,028 --> 01:25:30,155
Anyhow, we're going out tonight.

1268
01:25:30,615 --> 01:25:32,199
Oh, no.

1269
01:25:32,367 --> 01:25:35,577
God, that reminds me. I have to call
and cancel with what's-his-face.

1270
01:25:36,121 --> 01:25:37,162
What's-his-face?

1271
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:39,915
Wait a minute.
do I sense a chill in the air?

1272
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:42,084
Oh, Magda.

1273
01:25:42,335 --> 01:25:45,045
I let my head
get in the way of this one.

1274
01:25:45,213 --> 01:25:49,425
You know, I always pick guys
from what I feel in here.

1275
01:25:49,592 --> 01:25:52,177
But for some reason with Pat,
I kept saying to myself:

1276
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:55,806
"Mary, grow up. You have
so much in common with this guy.

1277
01:25:55,974 --> 01:25:59,184
You'll learn to feel something for him."
But...

1278
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:01,061
...it just didn't happen.

1279
01:26:05,191 --> 01:26:07,943
- Who is it?
- It's Tucker.

1280
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,696
- Tucker.
- Hello. how are you?

1281
01:26:10,864 --> 01:26:12,990
- Good, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

1282
01:26:13,158 --> 01:26:16,243
- Look who's here.
- There she is.

1283
01:26:16,411 --> 01:26:19,496
I brought you
a little thirst quencher, Mag.

1284
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:23,125
- Oh. are you sweet.
- No, I'm not.

1285
01:26:23,293 --> 01:26:25,502
I just wanna get you drunk
so you'll pass out...

1286
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:27,963
...and I can give Mary a good rogering.

1287
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:31,800
- You want me to pour you one?
- Thanks, but I have to be going.

1288
01:26:31,968 --> 01:26:35,804
- Unfortunately, this is not a social visit.
- Really? What's up?

1289
01:26:35,972 --> 01:26:39,476
Well, I've got a little more news
about your friend Healy.

1290
01:26:39,643 --> 01:26:41,269
Tucker, everything's okay.

1291
01:26:41,437 --> 01:26:44,355
He confessed everything.
He told me he's not an architect.

1292
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:47,317
You were right.
But right now, I'm actually running behind...

1293
01:26:47,485 --> 01:26:49,110
Mary, the man's a killer.

1294
01:26:50,154 --> 01:26:51,654
- What?
- Yes.

1295
01:26:51,822 --> 01:26:54,032
I have a friend
in the Boston Police Department.

1296
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:58,161
He faxed me this this morning.
I'll just give you the highlights.

1297
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:01,039
After a short stint as a petty thief...

1298
01:27:01,207 --> 01:27:06,669
...Patrick R. Healy graduated
to armed robbery by the age of 14.

1299
01:27:06,837 --> 01:27:09,839
At 16, he committed his first murder.

1300
01:27:10,007 --> 01:27:13,259
A pretty teacher's aide
named Molly Pettygrove.

1301
01:27:13,427 --> 01:27:17,931
He was incarcerated until the age of 22,
when, despite a grim psychological profile...

1302
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:20,266
...the state was forced to release him.

1303
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:22,852
In his mid-20s
and again in his early 30s...

1304
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:26,773
...he was suspected of homicides
in the states of Utah and Washington.

1305
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:30,818
Unfortunately,
the bodies were so badly decomposed...

1306
01:27:30,986 --> 01:27:35,240
...there wasn't enough evidence
to hold him, and so on and so forth.

1307
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:38,993
What am I gonna do?
I'm supposed to meet this guy in an hour.

1308
01:27:39,161 --> 01:27:43,831
Well, just calm down.
Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.

1309
01:27:43,999 --> 01:27:45,708
Tucker.

1310
01:27:46,585 --> 01:27:49,129
Why you two never hooked up
is beyond me.

1311
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,216
I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.

1312
01:27:53,343 --> 01:27:56,971
Yes. well, don't get all gooey on me, now.
You're gonna give me a big head.

1313
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,056
See, the important thing, doctor...

1314
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:01,892
...is you have to distance yourself
as much as possible...

1315
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:03,769
...without pissing this psycho off.

1316
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:07,398
Okay.

1317
01:28:07,857 --> 01:28:11,902
All right. I know what I've gotta do.
I know what I gotta do. Where's the phone?

1318
01:28:26,126 --> 01:28:28,252
You're gonna pay, fucker.

1319
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:48,272
I don't know, Dom.

1320
01:28:48,815 --> 01:28:51,775
I don't feel good. I feel nervous.
I really feel nervous.

1321
01:28:51,943 --> 01:28:53,819
Oh, come on, relax. Relax.

1322
01:28:53,987 --> 01:28:55,988
- You been to the cash machine?
- Yeah.

1323
01:28:56,156 --> 01:28:59,200
Car clean? Plenty of gas?

1324
01:28:59,994 --> 01:29:03,872
- Breath. How's your breath?
- It's fine. I had some Altoids.

1325
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:08,710
All right. I think you're all set.
So just go clean the pipes and it's a go.

1326
01:29:09,837 --> 01:29:11,838
You know, clean the pipes.

1327
01:29:12,256 --> 01:29:14,466
What do you mean, clean the pipes?

1328
01:29:15,176 --> 01:29:19,012
You choke the chicken
before any big date. don't you?

1329
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:23,850
Tell me you spank the monkey
before any big date.

1330
01:29:24,685 --> 01:29:28,355
Oh, my God. He doesn't flog the dolphin
before a big date.

1331
01:29:28,522 --> 01:29:30,106
- No.
- Are you crazy?

1332
01:29:30,274 --> 01:29:32,567
That's like going out there
with a loaded gun.

1333
01:29:32,735 --> 01:29:35,362
Of course that's why you're nervous.

1334
01:29:35,529 --> 01:29:39,032
Oh, my dear friend, please sit. Please.

1335
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:45,705
Look. after you've had sex with a girl
and you're lying in bed with her...

1336
01:29:45,873 --> 01:29:47,248
...are you nervous?

1337
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:50,877
- No.
- No, you're not. Why?

1338
01:29:51,045 --> 01:29:53,129
Because I'm tired.

1339
01:29:53,297 --> 01:29:57,175
Wrong. It's because you ain't got
the baby batter on the brain anymore.

1340
01:29:57,343 --> 01:30:00,720
Jesus. That stuff will fuck your head up.

1341
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:02,764
Look.

1342
01:30:02,932 --> 01:30:06,393
The most honest moment in a man's life
are the few minutes...

1343
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,895
...after he's blown his load.

1344
01:30:08,063 --> 01:30:13,275
That is a medical fact, and the reason for it
is that you're no longer trying to get laid.

1345
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:18,280
You're actually... You're thinking like a girl,
and girls love that.

1346
01:30:18,782 --> 01:30:20,825
Holy shit.

1347
01:30:20,992 --> 01:30:23,411
I've been going out with a loaded gun.

1348
01:30:24,788 --> 01:30:26,247
People get hurt that way.

1349
01:31:00,115 --> 01:31:02,658
Healy. How smashing to see you.

1350
01:31:02,826 --> 01:31:05,202
- You're dead, motherfucker.
- Okay. Take it easy.

1351
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:08,748
Who the fuck do you think you are,
making that shit up about me?

1352
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:11,959
It's that stalker, Ted.

1353
01:31:12,294 --> 01:31:13,753
He got ahold of you, didn't he?

1354
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,297
You're working for him, aren't you,
you little shit?

1355
01:31:16,465 --> 01:31:17,799
Who?

1356
01:31:25,224 --> 01:31:28,101
Either you come clean,
or I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

1357
01:31:28,269 --> 01:31:30,687
I love her, man.

1358
01:31:31,564 --> 01:31:35,275
- What?
- You heard me, goddamn it.

1359
01:31:37,779 --> 01:31:39,780
I love Mary, man.

1360
01:31:42,366 --> 01:31:46,119
I'm a phony. Just like you.

1361
01:31:46,412 --> 01:31:51,333
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm a fucking fraud.

1362
01:31:51,501 --> 01:31:54,628
I'm no architect. Don't be a putz, man.

1363
01:31:55,713 --> 01:31:59,841
Who's been to Santiago, Chile.
twice in one year?

1364
01:32:00,343 --> 01:32:05,096
- I've never even been to Jersey.
- Okay, okay. Just take it easy.

1365
01:32:05,264 --> 01:32:07,808
Wait a minute.
You knew those people back at Harvard.

1366
01:32:07,975 --> 01:32:10,101
Fuck. I knew shit, man.

1367
01:32:10,269 --> 01:32:13,438
The only thing I knew
was that you were a fake...

1368
01:32:13,648 --> 01:32:15,482
...and I made up everything else.

1369
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:18,109
My real name's Norm.

1370
01:32:19,362 --> 01:32:21,363
I'm a pizza-delivery boy.

1371
01:32:21,531 --> 01:32:24,991
Here. Look. Here's my ID.

1372
01:32:33,335 --> 01:32:34,544
Fuck me.

1373
01:32:36,713 --> 01:32:39,340
Hey, boy. How about the pizza, huh?

1374
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,594
Yeah? Well, fuck you.

1375
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:46,097
Calm down, honey.

1376
01:32:46,265 --> 01:32:48,766
Hey, you want your pizza? Here, man.

1377
01:32:54,273 --> 01:32:56,065
Excuse my friend.

1378
01:32:56,233 --> 01:32:58,442
He's had a little too much to drink.

1379
01:33:08,245 --> 01:33:10,663
Yeah. Yeah.

1380
01:33:18,505 --> 01:33:20,464
Keep the change.

1381
01:34:17,523 --> 01:34:20,984
Where the hell did it go?

1382
01:34:23,696 --> 01:34:26,490
Hang on. Wait a second.

1383
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:46,093
- Hello. How you doing?
- Hey. Hi. Good, how are you?

1384
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,595
- Good.
- Good.

1385
01:34:47,763 --> 01:34:50,598
You are looking very beautiful.

1386
01:34:50,766 --> 01:34:52,433
Thank you.

1387
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:54,394
What is that?

1388
01:34:57,523 --> 01:34:58,731
On your ear.

1389
01:34:59,483 --> 01:35:02,610
- Ear?
- No, your left ear.

1390
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:04,737
Is that?

1391
01:35:06,782 --> 01:35:07,907
Is that hair gel?

1392
01:35:10,786 --> 01:35:12,912
- Yeah.
- Great. I could use some.

1393
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,665
- No, no, no. You don't have to. You don't...
- No, really.

1394
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:17,500
I just ran out.

1395
01:35:21,505 --> 01:35:23,297
- How we doing over here?
- Okay.

1396
01:35:23,465 --> 01:35:25,174
- Little more wine?
- Sure.

1397
01:35:26,468 --> 01:35:29,887
So when you say killer, you mean...

1398
01:35:30,055 --> 01:35:33,516
- He's a murderer. Yeah.
- Like, an actual convicted murderer?

1399
01:35:33,684 --> 01:35:36,102
He killed people. I know, it's crazy.

1400
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:39,188
- And, what, did he ever go to jail, or he's...?
- Yeah, in Boston.

1401
01:35:39,356 --> 01:35:41,524
- He spent... I don't know how long.
- He got out?

1402
01:35:41,692 --> 01:35:43,484
Well, it's obvious. The system sucks.

1403
01:35:43,652 --> 01:35:46,028
The guy's walking the streets.
I'm kissing him.

1404
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:50,116
Right, but you didn't
do anything else, right?

1405
01:35:50,284 --> 01:35:52,618
- What?
- I mean, you didn't...

1406
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:57,207
- No, no, no.
- No, okay.

1407
01:35:57,375 --> 01:35:59,626
- God, I couldn't live with myself.
- No, I mean...

1408
01:35:59,794 --> 01:36:03,756
I only went out with him a couple times.
but, you know, just the thought of that...

1409
01:36:06,217 --> 01:36:09,094
I shouldn't be putting this all on you,
I'm sorry.

1410
01:36:09,262 --> 01:36:14,475
- We haven't seen each other in so long.
- No, it's just I feel really bad.

1411
01:36:14,642 --> 01:36:17,561
I'm tired of talking about stalkers.
Let's talk about you.

1412
01:36:19,647 --> 01:36:21,899
Are you okay? Yeah?

1413
01:36:22,066 --> 01:36:24,318
- Do you want some water?
- No, I'm good.

1414
01:36:24,694 --> 01:36:28,280
So then in '94, I went back to
Dade Community College for a semester.

1415
01:36:28,448 --> 01:36:33,410
And when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell
through, I hooked up with Peking Pizza.

1416
01:36:33,578 --> 01:36:37,456
Hey, Cat, how about
a couple of brews over here, man?

1417
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:41,001
Hey, get the fuck out of here.

1418
01:36:41,169 --> 01:36:44,129
I told you 20 times
you're not welcome here anymore.

1419
01:36:44,297 --> 01:36:46,882
Hey, hey, hey, you,
where's that coming from?

1420
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:50,260
It's coming from you always
skipping out on your tab.

1421
01:36:50,762 --> 01:36:52,471
Hey, I got cash.

1422
01:36:54,182 --> 01:36:56,099
Okay, Norm.

1423
01:36:56,392 --> 01:37:00,270
You pay. I'll pour. In that order.

1424
01:37:01,731 --> 01:37:04,358
- Hey, Tracy, how are the twins?
- Fuck you, Norm.

1425
01:37:04,526 --> 01:37:07,654
That's it,
I like it when you talk dirty to me, man.

1426
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:09,864
Here you go, big guy.

1427
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:12,909
Come on, cough it up, chompers.

1428
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:18,122
Thanks.

1429
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,627
So how the hell did you meet Mary?

1430
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:25,088
It was just dumb luck, really.

1431
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:28,758
I delivered a pie to her and she
answered the door in her nightgown...

1432
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:32,303
...and, wow, that was it for me.

1433
01:37:32,471 --> 01:37:35,306
I went home that night,
shaved my beard, and a week later...

1434
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:38,142
...I'm laid out in her office
with a broken back.

1435
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:41,020
Broken back? How'd you do that?

1436
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:43,982
A friend. Baseball bat.

1437
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,150
Touché.

1438
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:51,030
You want another one?

1439
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:55,118
Sure. Yeah. Hey, Docky.

1440
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,663
- Couple more nitrate-sicles, please.
- Two corn dogs coming up.

1441
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:02,208
You know, I don't think that they have
enough meats on sticks.

1442
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:05,378
No, seriously. If you think about it,
they have plenty of sweets.

1443
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:09,007
They have lollipops,
they have Fudgsicles, they have Popsicles...

1444
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:11,342
...but they don't have
any other meat on sticks.

1445
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:14,554
- Yes, you don't see many meats on sticks.
- Absolutely not.

1446
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:18,851
You know what I'd like to see?
I'd like to see more meats in a cone.

1447
01:38:19,019 --> 01:38:23,772
You don't hardly ever see that. You know,
that's an idea I think is waiting to pop.

1448
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:27,526
Just like a nice, you know, nice, big,
oversize waffle-cone...

1449
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,070
...stuffed full of chopped liver.
- Chopped liver.

1450
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,405
Exactly.

1451
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:34,658
- Too bad you don't live here, Ted.
- Yeah?

1452
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:37,411
Yeah. We have a lot in common.

1453
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,498
Well, you know, maybe...

1454
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:45,377
Have you ever thought about
maybe moving back up to Rhode Island?

1455
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:49,506
I thought about it, but I got too much
of a good thing going on here.

1456
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:54,595
I got a great practice.
I like the people I work with, and Warren.

1457
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:58,641
You know, maybe you should just. like,
move down here and marry me.

1458
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:07,650
- So you're a writer.
- Yeah, well, I'm trying to be.

1459
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:11,695
Well, the good thing about writing
is you can do it anywhere.

1460
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:13,405
That's true.

1461
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:20,079
How about you? How did you manage
to stay single all these years?

1462
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:27,587
Well, I'm bisexual, so that's hard
for a lot of guys to understand.

1463
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:30,799
- Well...
- You gonna smoke that?

1464
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:37,097
You know,
I read somewhere that most women...

1465
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:41,017
...if you really ask them honestly,
have tendencies towards...

1466
01:39:41,185 --> 01:39:45,313
- I mean, everybody has a bit of...
- Ted, I'm fucking with you.

1467
01:39:46,065 --> 01:39:47,649
Yeah.

1468
01:39:49,276 --> 01:39:51,987
Stalking motherfucker.

1469
01:39:52,154 --> 01:39:55,991
I know. It sickens me.

1470
01:39:56,158 --> 01:39:59,786
Actually. I did almost get married once.

1471
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:03,748
What happened?

1472
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:07,002
Well, he was a really great guy.

1473
01:40:07,294 --> 01:40:09,295
He lived up north, and...

1474
01:40:10,131 --> 01:40:11,923
Come on. let's go.

1475
01:40:16,637 --> 01:40:18,263
Here you go.

1476
01:40:35,031 --> 01:40:38,117
Wait. How many is this?

1477
01:40:39,286 --> 01:40:41,162
- Four.
- Four?

1478
01:40:41,329 --> 01:40:44,582
That seems like an awful lot of speed
to give one little pooch.

1479
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:48,502
- Are you sure it won't kill him?
- I never said that.

1480
01:40:51,423 --> 01:40:53,507
Baby.

1481
01:40:59,181 --> 01:41:00,848
Good, good, good.

1482
01:41:01,433 --> 01:41:06,854
And so then it was over.
We really haven't spoken since.

1483
01:41:07,272 --> 01:41:10,149
Wow, sounds like he was almost perfect.

1484
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:13,402
Almost.

1485
01:41:15,614 --> 01:41:18,365
Hey, you wanna go upstairs
and watch SportsCenter?

1486
01:41:20,619 --> 01:41:23,621
You know, I think I'm just gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

1487
01:41:23,789 --> 01:41:26,123
You're not that far ahead, Ted.

1488
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:35,257
Magda.

1489
01:41:36,051 --> 01:41:37,384
What are you doing?

1490
01:41:37,552 --> 01:41:40,054
Hi, hon. Just straightening up.

1491
01:41:44,976 --> 01:41:46,186
Put that down.

1492
01:41:48,689 --> 01:41:50,482
Magda.

1493
01:41:51,067 --> 01:41:52,734
Thanks, doll.

1494
01:41:55,071 --> 01:41:57,239
Magda. Magda.

1495
01:41:57,406 --> 01:42:00,075
Honey, where is Puffy?

1496
01:42:00,243 --> 01:42:02,410
He was being a pest.
I put him in the bathroom.

1497
01:42:02,578 --> 01:42:04,079
Really?

1498
01:42:05,498 --> 01:42:07,124
Ted?

1499
01:42:07,834 --> 01:42:10,794
Can you do me a favor?
Would you mind letting the dog out?

1500
01:42:10,962 --> 01:42:13,505
I think I should have a talk
with Magda here.

1501
01:42:13,673 --> 01:42:15,340
Sure, yeah.

1502
01:42:18,136 --> 01:42:19,344
- Over here.
- Where?

1503
01:42:19,512 --> 01:42:21,721
- Here. Fine.
- Good. What's going on?

1504
01:42:22,348 --> 01:42:23,974
More cleaning.

1505
01:42:24,267 --> 01:42:26,601
- How much coffee did you have tonight?
- None.

1506
01:42:29,814 --> 01:42:31,439
Mary?

1507
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:34,651
What kind of dog is Puffy?

1508
01:42:34,819 --> 01:42:38,905
- Border terrier.
- Border terrier. Like Benji.

1509
01:42:48,374 --> 01:42:52,127
Hey.

1510
01:42:52,295 --> 01:42:55,923
Are you the little guy
making all that big noise?

1511
01:43:02,139 --> 01:43:03,181
Oh, Ted!

1512
01:43:13,734 --> 01:43:14,775
Puffy, stop it!

1513
01:43:17,821 --> 01:43:19,488
Take a little bit of this.

1514
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:23,701
Puffy. Puffy.

1515
01:43:30,542 --> 01:43:31,584
Puffy!

1516
01:43:47,476 --> 01:43:49,268
That's all you got, pal?

1517
01:43:54,066 --> 01:43:59,695
Ted.

1518
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:07,746
No, no, no.

1519
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:32,521
Puffy!

1520
01:44:33,564 --> 01:44:36,858
Puffy! Puffy! Puffy!

1521
01:44:42,573 --> 01:44:44,700
How do you know that I'm right?

1522
01:44:44,867 --> 01:44:48,495
Well, you know. No, I don't.

1523
01:44:48,663 --> 01:44:51,373
- You want a grape?
- A grape? Sure.

1524
01:44:52,667 --> 01:44:54,501
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1525
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:58,505
All net. All net. We make a good team.

1526
01:45:28,495 --> 01:45:30,079
Hey. Come on. Want a go?

1527
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:32,165
- Closer?
- Don't be afraid. It's all right.

1528
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:36,210
Get in closer. That's good. Don't be afraid.
Get right in there. A little bit more.

1529
01:45:36,378 --> 01:45:39,839
Good. He'll be fine.
Mary, you're being overprotective.

1530
01:46:13,082 --> 01:46:15,166
No, no, no. We already... We got...

1531
01:46:24,552 --> 01:46:26,303
Come on, come on.

1532
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,935
Warren. Warren.

1533
01:46:33,103 --> 01:46:35,562
- Warren.
- Warren.

1534
01:46:37,816 --> 01:46:39,775
Warren.

1535
01:46:42,278 --> 01:46:45,781
- Warren.
- Warren, come here. Stop.

1536
01:46:48,284 --> 01:46:50,619
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1537
01:46:50,787 --> 01:46:53,372
Hey. Hey.

1538
01:46:54,249 --> 01:46:57,626
- It's his fault. He hit me with that stuff.
- Here, let me help with that.

1539
01:46:57,794 --> 01:46:59,753
Warren! Warren!

1540
01:47:24,529 --> 01:47:27,990
I didn't do it. He got in the way.

1541
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:30,784
I know. I know, I know.
Does anybody have any pliers?

1542
01:47:30,952 --> 01:47:34,622
Needle-nose, otherwise? Anything?

1543
01:47:43,507 --> 01:47:45,091
Hey.

1544
01:47:45,759 --> 01:47:50,972
Flowers are for you, ball is for Warren.
Had a friend FedEx it from Boston.

1545
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:54,017
Signed by Tony Conigliaro.

1546
01:47:54,185 --> 01:47:57,854
Did you hire Pat Healy to spy on me?

1547
01:48:00,024 --> 01:48:01,524
What?

1548
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,861
What are you talking about?

1549
01:48:05,446 --> 01:48:07,906
I got an anonymous letter.

1550
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:10,867
It's not true, right, Ted?

1551
01:48:15,206 --> 01:48:20,210
Well, it's an interesting thing
that happened. I...

1552
01:48:21,545 --> 01:48:23,713
Yeah, it's true, but it's not...

1553
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:26,633
Okay. Get out.

1554
01:48:27,218 --> 01:48:30,136
Mary, wait.
First of all, I didn't know that this guy was...

1555
01:48:30,304 --> 01:48:32,055
What, that he was a murderer?

1556
01:48:32,223 --> 01:48:34,599
That, yeah.
in addition to many other things.

1557
01:48:34,767 --> 01:48:37,727
I mean, I didn't know anything
about the guy. I hardly know him.

1558
01:48:37,895 --> 01:48:39,312
How could you do that, Ted?

1559
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:44,068
How could you have some guy
you don't even know spy on me?

1560
01:48:44,569 --> 01:48:46,862
What were you trying to do?

1561
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:51,408
Trick me into feeling something for you?

1562
01:48:54,329 --> 01:48:56,538
No. I didn't...

1563
01:48:56,748 --> 01:48:58,415
I didn't wanna trick you.

1564
01:49:00,252 --> 01:49:03,087
Just leave. Okay?

1565
01:49:04,506 --> 01:49:05,547
Mary.

1566
01:49:06,591 --> 01:49:08,175
Go.

1567
01:49:18,478 --> 01:49:22,147
I did it because I never stopped
thinking about you.

1568
01:49:22,983 --> 01:49:27,069
And if I didn't find you, I knew that my life
would never, ever be good again.

1569
01:50:11,282 --> 01:50:12,657
Hey.

1570
01:50:12,867 --> 01:50:15,618
Healy. You in there?

1571
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:22,500
Hello?

1572
01:50:38,017 --> 01:50:42,854
And it was going along just fine
until you showed up.

1573
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:47,609
Holy shit.

1574
01:50:47,902 --> 01:50:50,820
This is a pretty nice place.

1575
01:50:51,572 --> 01:50:54,366
Sully, what the fuck happened?

1576
01:50:54,533 --> 01:50:57,827
- Hey, surprise.
- Hey, peace, man. Come on.

1577
01:50:57,995 --> 01:50:59,913
- You fucked me, man.
- Wait. Come on.

1578
01:51:00,081 --> 01:51:04,418
- Man, don't do anything rash now, buddy.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

1579
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:09,715
That's Norm. He's a pizza boy.
He's in love with Mary too.

1580
01:51:10,384 --> 01:51:11,592
Look, come on, man.

1581
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:15,846
All right. Look. I think everybody
could use a drink right now.

1582
01:51:16,014 --> 01:51:17,348
I don't want a drink.

1583
01:51:17,808 --> 01:51:20,810
- Fuck you.
- Hey, hey, hey. Look.

1584
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:23,979
You asked me to follow around your girl
and I did.

1585
01:51:24,815 --> 01:51:29,151
And then the truth is, I started to like her.

1586
01:51:30,278 --> 01:51:33,948
And that's when I realized I couldn't
in good conscience bring myself to do it.

1587
01:51:35,409 --> 01:51:36,450
Do what?

1588
01:51:37,452 --> 01:51:39,995
Turn her over to a violent stalker.

1589
01:51:40,163 --> 01:51:43,207
Oh, I'm a stalker?
You're calling me a violent stalker?

1590
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:46,335
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- I'm a...?

1591
01:51:48,839 --> 01:51:50,840
Oh, my God.

1592
01:51:53,176 --> 01:51:54,677
That poor dog.

1593
01:51:56,012 --> 01:51:57,471
- Hey, fuck you.
- Fuck you.

1594
01:51:57,639 --> 01:51:59,890
You just can't take the fact
that it was my turn.

1595
01:52:00,058 --> 01:52:03,060
- Your turn?
- Yeah, that's right. My turn.

1596
01:52:03,812 --> 01:52:06,522
Why can't I ever get a girl like Mary?

1597
01:52:07,107 --> 01:52:10,901
Just because you didn't get her, you didn't
have to blow us both out of the water.

1598
01:52:11,403 --> 01:52:12,862
What are you talking about?

1599
01:52:13,322 --> 01:52:16,241
You're gonna tell me
you didn't write her an anonymous letter...

1600
01:52:16,409 --> 01:52:18,577
...telling her about
our whole deal together?

1601
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:20,412
What letter?

1602
01:52:21,914 --> 01:52:23,540
Come on.

1603
01:52:25,209 --> 01:52:26,209
It was you.

1604
01:52:29,589 --> 01:52:31,715
You sent the letter.

1605
01:52:31,966 --> 01:52:33,675
It was you.

1606
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:37,888
We had a deal. You said you wouldn't
fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you...

1607
01:52:38,055 --> 01:52:41,558
...until we got this fuck
out of the fucking picture.

1608
01:52:41,726 --> 01:52:44,519
- You crossed the line, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

1609
01:52:44,687 --> 01:52:48,231
You're getting crazy now.
Why would I cross the line?

1610
01:52:49,233 --> 01:52:51,610
You probably did it yourself,
you piece of shit.

1611
01:52:51,777 --> 01:52:55,322
Oh, yeah. That makes a lot of sense.
Why would I rat myself out?

1612
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:57,491
Like I'm gonna
try to figure out some guy...

1613
01:52:57,658 --> 01:53:01,161
...whose idea of courting
is blowing farts in her face.

1614
01:53:01,329 --> 01:53:06,875
- You were following us.
- Don't flatter yourself. I was following her.

1615
01:53:08,461 --> 01:53:10,587
I always do.

1616
01:53:11,005 --> 01:53:14,591
How the hell do you think
I got rid of the last guy, Brett?

1617
01:53:15,259 --> 01:53:20,680
Wait, Brett? Are you saying that Brett
didn't say those things about Warren?

1618
01:53:21,849 --> 01:53:25,770
Are you shitting me?
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?

1619
01:53:25,938 --> 01:53:28,439
He was like an Eagle Scout.

1620
01:53:28,649 --> 01:53:32,693
Wait a minute. You two should be kissing
my fucking hairy beanbag, you know?

1621
01:53:32,861 --> 01:53:35,988
Because if it wasn't for me,
she might have married that schmuck.

1622
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:40,284
I feel sick.

1623
01:53:40,744 --> 01:53:42,745
Both of you are just...

1624
01:53:43,872 --> 01:53:45,665
I'm out of here.

1625
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:48,334
Yeah.

1626
01:53:49,711 --> 01:53:53,965
You know, if it wasn't you who sent
the letter and I never sent it...

1627
01:53:54,383 --> 01:53:56,175
...who sent it?

1628
01:54:00,472 --> 01:54:02,056
Oh, hey. Hal.

1629
01:54:02,224 --> 01:54:05,893
I was worried about you. I thought that...

1630
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:09,981
Oh, Sully.

1631
01:54:23,495 --> 01:54:25,079
Oh, my...

1632
01:54:25,706 --> 01:54:26,747
Woogie?

1633
01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:29,542
Who the hell is Woogie?

1634
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:34,256
Hello.

1635
01:54:36,134 --> 01:54:37,634
What are you doing here?

1636
01:54:38,886 --> 01:54:42,139
Did you get my letter, Mare?
The one about Ted?

1637
01:54:44,225 --> 01:54:45,267
You sent that?

1638
01:54:48,521 --> 01:54:51,648
I was worried about you.

1639
01:54:51,816 --> 01:54:55,861
Woogie, you know you're not
supposed to be within 400 yards of me.

1640
01:54:56,029 --> 01:54:58,864
Yeah, I know. I do. In fact, you know...

1641
01:54:59,032 --> 01:55:01,700
...that's what I really wanted
to talk to you about.

1642
01:55:01,868 --> 01:55:07,998
You know that I have actually been through
nine years of intensive psychotherapy.

1643
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:12,169
And you know something?
You were absolutely right. I needed help.

1644
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:17,507
That's great. Woogie.
I mean, I'm glad you're doing better.

1645
01:55:17,675 --> 01:55:19,259
You look...

1646
01:55:20,011 --> 01:55:22,220
- You look good.
- Thank you.

1647
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:25,641
Except for the rash thing's still there,
right?

1648
01:55:25,808 --> 01:55:30,395
Yes. You noticed, huh?
These are called love blisters.

1649
01:55:30,563 --> 01:55:35,984
They went away for a little while,
but then you came back in my life, milady.

1650
01:55:37,403 --> 01:55:42,325
Woogie, I did not come back
into your life. Okay?

1651
01:55:42,493 --> 01:55:45,328
I don't even know how you found me.
Let's not forget, here.

1652
01:55:45,496 --> 01:55:48,331
You put me through a lot of bullshit,
okay?

1653
01:55:48,499 --> 01:55:52,919
I had to change my name,
I had to go to court. I moved.

1654
01:55:53,087 --> 01:55:55,171
I mean, you stole all of my shoes.

1655
01:55:56,256 --> 01:55:59,092
What? What are you talking about?

1656
01:55:59,259 --> 01:56:01,511
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

1657
01:56:02,846 --> 01:56:05,515
I was in a weird place then. Mary.

1658
01:56:06,183 --> 01:56:10,144
Come on. Okay? Come on.

1659
01:56:10,312 --> 01:56:14,399
Give me a break here, okay?
I was a little nuts, a little...

1660
01:56:14,566 --> 01:56:16,651
But I'm fine.

1661
01:56:16,819 --> 01:56:20,780
Woogie, you're starting
to make me a little nervous.

1662
01:56:21,949 --> 01:56:24,450
I'm making you feel nervous?
Nervous? What's that?

1663
01:56:24,618 --> 01:56:27,704
I wouldn't know anything about nervous.
Jeez.

1664
01:56:27,871 --> 01:56:31,332
You ever had a whitehead
on your eyeball, Mary?

1665
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,293
Woogie, I'm asking you to leave.

1666
01:56:34,461 --> 01:56:38,715
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, you got this all wrong.

1667
01:56:38,882 --> 01:56:40,842
I'm not going anywhere.

1668
01:56:42,302 --> 01:56:45,138
Not until I get something
to remember you by.

1669
01:56:47,307 --> 01:56:49,684
Get your hands out of there.

1670
01:56:50,519 --> 01:56:52,312
- No. Woogie.
- Yeah.

1671
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:53,772
Let go.

1672
01:56:54,524 --> 01:56:56,108
Stop it. Stop!

1673
01:56:56,276 --> 01:57:00,612
Just one pair. You owe me that,
you heartless bitch.

1674
01:57:01,239 --> 01:57:04,283
What the...? Hey.

1675
01:57:09,247 --> 01:57:12,624
Dom? You're pathetic.

1676
01:57:13,084 --> 01:57:16,962
Tucker, what happened to your crutches?

1677
01:57:17,547 --> 01:57:19,339
Yeah, well...

1678
01:57:19,507 --> 01:57:21,800
Yes, very good query, Mary. Well done.

1679
01:57:21,968 --> 01:57:24,428
Come on. Tell her the truth, pizza boy.

1680
01:57:28,391 --> 01:57:30,350
Name's Norm.

1681
01:57:30,518 --> 01:57:34,229
I live with my folks up in Pompano. Hey.

1682
01:57:35,857 --> 01:57:39,735
Oh, man.
This is like group therapy or something.

1683
01:57:39,903 --> 01:57:41,695
Dom. What are you doing here?

1684
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:45,949
You stole her from me,
and now I want her back.

1685
01:57:46,117 --> 01:57:48,660
I stole her from you?
What are you talking about?

1686
01:57:49,746 --> 01:57:52,831
Woogie. How many times
did I tell you this at Princeton?

1687
01:57:53,416 --> 01:57:56,502
- Woogie?
- Ted and I had one date.

1688
01:57:56,669 --> 01:57:59,254
- You and I were already broken up.
- You're Woogie?

1689
01:58:00,215 --> 01:58:02,425
Dom Woganowski.

1690
01:58:04,094 --> 01:58:08,598
But you're married.
You have a wife, beautiful kids.

1691
01:58:08,766 --> 01:58:11,559
Ted, if you love them so much,
please, be my guest.

1692
01:58:11,727 --> 01:58:16,731
All right, what the hell is going on here?
Can someone explain it to me?

1693
01:58:17,191 --> 01:58:20,860
Look, we're all in love with Mary.

1694
01:58:22,029 --> 01:58:23,404
Oh, God.

1695
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:27,283
If I may, I have a proposal.

1696
01:58:27,785 --> 01:58:30,745
I say none of us leaves this room...

1697
01:58:30,913 --> 01:58:34,123
...until our young Mary here
stops jerking us around...

1698
01:58:34,291 --> 01:58:38,211
...and decides, once and for all,
who she really wants.

1699
01:58:40,464 --> 01:58:43,341
Now, Mary, I know this is tough...

1700
01:58:44,009 --> 01:58:49,138
...but you really will be doing them all
a great favor to tell them the truth about us.

1701
01:58:49,306 --> 01:58:52,684
Are you crazy? What makes you think
I would pick you anyhow?

1702
01:58:52,852 --> 01:58:55,019
I mean, you're a murderer.

1703
01:58:57,481 --> 01:59:02,944
Well, I may have been blowing
a little smoke up your ass there, Mary.

1704
01:59:03,112 --> 01:59:04,696
I'm sorry.

1705
01:59:07,658 --> 01:59:10,910
- Touchdown.
- Hi, Mary.

1706
01:59:11,663 --> 01:59:14,957
- Brett?
- What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

1707
01:59:15,125 --> 01:59:17,334
I'm in town to play the Dolphins,
you dumb-ass.

1708
01:59:17,502 --> 01:59:21,338
Yeah. I called him, Mary. I told him
to pick up Warren and get down here.

1709
01:59:21,506 --> 01:59:25,634
See, your friend Tucker
was lying about a couple of other things.

1710
01:59:25,802 --> 01:59:27,970
Brett never said
those bad things about Warren.

1711
01:59:28,138 --> 01:59:29,847
He loves Warren.

1712
01:59:30,015 --> 01:59:34,476
And from what he told me on the phone
just now, he loves you too.

1713
01:59:34,644 --> 01:59:36,896
He's the guy you should be with.

1714
01:59:41,026 --> 01:59:44,737
That's right, Mary.
You know I'll always be true to you.

1715
01:59:45,071 --> 01:59:48,198
Shit. This isn't fair. Jesus.

1716
01:59:48,366 --> 01:59:50,492
You know, I feel like an idiot.

1717
01:59:51,036 --> 01:59:56,165
See, I realized something today.
I'm no better than any of these guys.

1718
01:59:56,666 --> 02:00:00,044
I mean, none of them love you, really.

1719
02:00:01,171 --> 02:00:05,549
They're just fixated on you because of how
you make them feel about themselves.

1720
02:00:05,717 --> 02:00:08,677
I mean, that's not real love. That's...

1721
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:10,971
I don't know what that is.

1722
02:00:12,432 --> 02:00:15,559
Please, Mary, don't listen to him.

1723
02:00:15,727 --> 02:00:18,395
This is just another one of his
stupid little ploys.

1724
02:00:18,563 --> 02:00:20,898
You know, Stroehmann,
you are so full of shit.

1725
02:00:21,066 --> 02:00:24,945
- Yeah. You're the biggest stalker of us all.
- You're gonna stand here and tell me...

1726
02:00:25,112 --> 02:00:27,530
...that you're not nuts about this girl?

1727
02:00:28,074 --> 02:00:29,991
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

1728
02:00:33,913 --> 02:00:36,748
- Hey, good luck, Brett.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1729
02:00:36,916 --> 02:00:39,834
She's a great gal. Take care of her.

1730
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:43,046
I'll see you, Mary.

1731
02:00:43,965 --> 02:00:45,382
Bye, Ted.

1732
02:00:48,302 --> 02:00:52,305
- Hey, Warren, see you later.
- Okay, goodbye, Ted.

1733
02:00:54,141 --> 02:00:55,725
Goodbye.

1734
02:00:57,103 --> 02:00:59,312
God, Mary, I've missed you.

1735
02:00:59,647 --> 02:01:00,689
Hey, Brett.

1736
02:01:00,856 --> 02:01:04,025
What are the chances I could get you
to give me a little autograph?

1737
02:01:04,193 --> 02:01:06,194
- Something nice to the wife and kids.
- What?

1738
02:01:06,362 --> 02:01:08,613
Oh, shut up. Cock tease.

1739
02:01:35,183 --> 02:01:39,603
Well, she's back with her old boyfriend

1740
02:01:39,771 --> 02:01:44,066
He don't challenge her
He don't contend with her

1741
02:01:44,234 --> 02:01:48,529
And she don't answer the cards you send

1742
02:01:48,697 --> 02:01:52,658
And you're jealous of the time
That he spend with her

1743
02:01:52,826 --> 02:01:57,038
Just let her go into the darkness

1744
02:01:57,664 --> 02:02:02,001
Let her live for all the things there

1745
02:02:02,169 --> 02:02:06,338
Let her go into the darkness

1746
02:02:06,506 --> 02:02:10,551
Let her go, let her go, let her go

1747
02:02:34,326 --> 02:02:35,868
Ted.

1748
02:02:37,704 --> 02:02:39,330
Mary?

1749
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:43,043
Ted.

1750
02:02:44,045 --> 02:02:45,712
Mary.

1751
02:02:47,882 --> 02:02:49,466
Ted.

1752
02:02:53,429 --> 02:02:54,930
You forgot your keys.

1753
02:03:08,778 --> 02:03:10,862
Did you really mean
what you said up there?

1754
02:03:14,575 --> 02:03:16,827
I just want you to be happy, Mary.

1755
02:03:20,915 --> 02:03:23,041
But I'd be happiest with you.

1756
02:03:27,588 --> 02:03:29,131
You're fucking with me, right?

1757
02:03:33,719 --> 02:03:38,390
What about Brett Favre?

1758
02:03:40,351 --> 02:03:43,103
What did I tell you the first time we met?

1759
02:03:43,604 --> 02:03:45,230
I'm a Niners fan.

1760
02:03:58,162 --> 02:04:03,541
His friends would say
"Stop whining." they've had enough of that

1761
02:04:03,709 --> 02:04:08,880
His friends would say
"Stop pining, there's other girls to look at"

1762
02:04:09,339 --> 02:04:14,135
They've tried to set him up
With Tiffany and Indigo

1763
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:20,057
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

1764
02:04:20,225 --> 02:04:21,350
What are you doing?

1765
02:04:21,518 --> 02:04:25,062
- That's my girl he's kissing.
- But you just slept with me.

1766
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:27,690
I was only boning you to get to Mary.
