1
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:57,989
What's it gonna be, Angelina?

2
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:03,119
<i>It was Grogan - the filthiest, dirtiest, dumbest</i>
<i>excuse for a man west of the Missouri River.</i>

3
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:05,580
You can die two ways, angel.

4
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:07,957
Quick, like the tongue of a snake,

5
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,127
or slower than the molasses in January.

6
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:17,300
<i>- But it was October...</i>
- I'll kill ya, damn it, if it's the Fourth of July.

7
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:19,677
Where is it?

8
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:27,602
Get over there.

9
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:35,860
<i>I told him to get out,</i>
<i>now that he had what he came for.</i>

10
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:38,363
Not quite, angel.

11
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:42,034
Take 'em off. Do it.

12
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,841
Come on.

13
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:17,611
<i>That was the end of Grogan,</i>
<i>the man who killed my father,</i>

14
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:20,781
<i>raped and murdered my sister,</i>
<i>burned my ranch,</i>

15
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:24,201
<i>shot my dog and stole my Bible.</i>

16
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,468
<i>But if there was one law of the West,</i>

17
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:44,429
<i>bastards had brothers</i>

18
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:47,975
<i>who seemed to ride forever.</i>

19
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,314
<i>But suddenly there he was,</i>
<i>my beloved Jessie.</i>

20
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,329
<i>He was the one man I trusted, the only man.</i>

21
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:14,127
<i>My heart leapt as I watched him ride near.</i>

22
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,630
<i>I could barely wait to feel</i>
<i>the warmth of his touch.</i>

23
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:43,907
<i>At the moment his lips met mine,</i>
<i>I knew that we would never again be apart.</i>

24
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:59,923
<i>I knew then that we would spend</i>
<i>the rest of our lives together.</i>

25
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,259
Forever.

26
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,472
Oh, God, that's good.

27
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,318
The...

28
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,487
...End.

29
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:15,332
I finished, sweetheart. You wanna celebrate?

30
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,920
So do I.

31
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,836
Romeo, Romeo. Where art thou, Romeo?

32
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,883
It's Bumble Bee, kiddo.

33
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:08,887
Just so you know,
I spare no expense when I celebrate.

34
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:56,226
Here's looking at you, Jessie.

35
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:59,730
Whoever you are.

36
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,996
Are you finished?

37
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:17,039
Thank you.

38
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:27,425
Come here, Romeo.

39
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:19,102
Hello?

40
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:30,030
Oh, my God, Romeo. Is that the time?

41
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:33,200
Gloria. I'm gonna be late.

42
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:54,888
- Hi.
- Hi, pumpkin.

43
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,102
Mrs Irwin, why won't you take the elevator?

44
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:04,815
Oh, pumpkin, I never get in an elevator alone.
You know - rapists.

45
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:09,153
- Where are you running off to?
- I've got to get to my publisher's.

46
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:16,201
By the way, the mailman couldn't fit this
into your box, so I told him I'd give it to you.

47
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:18,454
Some love letter.

48
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,544
- Mrs Irwin, you're a tease.
- I know, but I keep hoping for you, pumpkin.

49
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:39,057
Hey, lady.
How about a monkey for your nephew?

50
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:42,145
I'll give you it for $10. Great deal.

51
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,732
It's really nice.
Your boyfriend'll love it. It's kinda kinky.

52
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,110
$9. $8, bottom line.

53
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,113
Thank you, but I really don't need a monkey.

54
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,491
But, lady, it's kinda cute...

55
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,498
Hey. That's Miss Wilder's apartment.

56
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:04,000
Can I help you?

57
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,591
Excuse me.

58
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,136
Get away from that door.

59
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,764
What's this?

60
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,397
Wimp. Wimp.

61
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:30,068
Loser. Loser.

62
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,237
Major loser.

63
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,783
Too angry. Too vague.

64
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:41,371
Too desperate. God, too happy.

65
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,291
Look at this guy.
Mr Mondo-dizmo. I used to date him.

66
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,836
Total sleaze bucket.

67
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,004
Wait a minute.

68
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:54,134
Hold everything. Get a load of this character.

69
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,719
Now what about him?

70
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:59,681
No, he's just not...

71
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:02,017
Who? Jessie?

72
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,981
Maybe it's silly, but I know that
there is somebody out there for me.

73
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:09,859
Oh, yeah? Where?

74
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,237
Certainly not here.

75
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,532
Gloria, why do we always
have to have this same conversation?

76
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:19,785
Because I like you, Joan,
and I hate to see you all alone,

77
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:22,997
waiting for somebody
who's not gonna show up.

78
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,958
OK, Gloria.

79
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:30,546
Here it is.

80
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:35,676
Read it and weep. I always do.

81
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:41,557
- I'll call you, OK?
- Come on. Have another grasshopper.

82
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:45,519
- I can't.
- I'm your publisher. I'm ordering you to.

83
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:52,109
I'm sorry I even dragged you to this place.
I just wanted you to get out.

84
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:56,697
I know how hard you've been working.
I know you're upset about your sister.

85
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:59,241
How is she? Have you heard from her?

86
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:03,746
Elaine? I spoke to her last week.
She's still in Colombia.

87
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:07,500
Have they found her husband's body yet?

88
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,378
Just the one piece.

89
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:16,509
You know what's creepy?
I got this package from Eduardo.

90
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:19,386
Must have been mailed just before he...

91
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:22,432
God.

92
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:25,560
Can you imagine?
Having your husband murdered.

93
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,729
How is she holding up?

94
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:32,317
Oh, she'll be fine. Elaine always manages.

95
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:36,863
CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA

96
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,516
Hey, Ira.

97
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:31,562
The kid's here with the broad.
They're taking her to the boat.

98
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,773
Look at these snappers, will ya?

99
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,069
We shoulda just rifled her room.

100
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:41,989
Ralph, how many times do I have to tell you?
It's not in the country.

101
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:45,076
This kidnapping stuff makes me real nervous.

102
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,748
It's a piss-poor idea. It's nothing but trouble.

103
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:54,335
Look. We've stolen enough
of these antique trinkets

104
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,547
to keep us living comfortably
for the rest of our lives.

105
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,757
Let's kiss off this Third World toilet.

106
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,137
One last big one. Trust me, Ralph.

107
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:07,683
Did you see that? That ugly,
striped son of a bitch down there?

108
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:11,812
Somebody's gonna get killed, and you
fart around with prehistoric animals.

109
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:16,275
Come on, Ira. Let's forget this one.
I got a real bad feeling about it.

110
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:19,069
Will you stop worrying?
Have I ever hurt you?

111
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:23,157
I will never hurt you. I can't hurt you.
We got the same blood.

112
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,287
We're not two people. We are one person.
Would I hurt me?

113
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,249
Look at those snappers.

114
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,792
Romeo. Oh, baby.

115
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:22,467
- Hello?
- Hello, Joan?

116
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:25,345
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>
- Elaine? I can't talk right now.

117
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:29,098
Listen to me. Listen very carefully.

118
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:32,644
- I'm in trouble.
- Elaine, please.

119
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:37,148
<i>- Joanie, I am in real trouble.</i>
- What's the matter?

120
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:41,569
<i>Has any mail been forwarded to you</i>
<i>with Eduardo's handwriting on it?</i>

121
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:43,738
<i>Any big envelope?</i>

122
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:45,865
- Yes.
<i>- Oh. Honey...</i>

123
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:49,702
<i>See if there's some kind</i>
<i>of treasure map inside.</i>

124
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:54,332
It says <i>El Coraz√≥n.</i>

125
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:58,336
I need you to bring that map
to me in Colombia.

126
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,840
Colombia?

127
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:06,261
My God. What kind of trouble are you in?

128
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:08,304
Joanie, please...

129
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:12,767
Get to the Hotel Cartagena in Cartagena.

130
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,145
<i>When you arrive, call this number.</i>

131
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,231
<i>64-58-24.</i>

132
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:20,400
<i>- Are you writing this down?</i>
- Yes.

133
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:23,903
And remember, you mustn't tell anybody.

134
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:29,409
Elaine, I can't go to Colombia.

135
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:32,829
Joanie?

136
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:36,207
<i>They'll cut me. They'll hurt me.</i>

137
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:46,886
Do you know what it's like in Colombia? I do.
You sell very well in these macho countries.

138
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:51,015
They have jungles there, Joanie.
Insects the size of sanitation trucks.

139
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:54,935
- Revolutionaries. Have you had your shots?
- Shots? What shots?

140
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,897
See? You're completely unprepared.
Wait a minute.

141
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,359
Would you tell me what's going on?
Why are you doing this?

142
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:04,820
Elaine is in some trouble.

143
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,656
She has a little domestic problem.

144
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,411
Elaine's last domestic problem was
finding her husband cut into small pieces.

145
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:15,539
I'm not gonna let you do this. You cannot go!

146
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:22,546
Here's Romeo. I want you to promise me
to feed him and hold him at least once a day.

147
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:28,219
You'll need something stronger than that.

148
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:32,431
Listen to me. You get bus sick,
seasick, plane sick, train sick.

149
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:36,268
You practically puke
riding on the escalator at Bloomingdale's!

150
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:39,271
Well, a lot of people
get sick in department stores.

151
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:41,524
Joanie, please. Don't go.

152
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:46,654
You're not up to this, Joan, and you know it.

153
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:49,949
I know, but she's my sister.

154
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:55,579
I'll feed him, but I'm not picking him up.

155
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,635
You're crazy.

156
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:03,565
The plane from New York, has it arrived yet?

157
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:15,869
Is this the bus to Cartagena?

158
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:25,922
Cartagena?

159
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,633
Oh, you speak English. Good.

160
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:33,304
Can you tell me,
is this bus going to Cartagena?

161
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:36,599
Yes. Cartagena.

162
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:39,185
Great. Thank you.

163
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:46,484
Thank you.

164
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:12,260
Hey, you're on the wrong bus!

165
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:15,596
Miss Wilder!
She got on the wrong bus. This is terrible.

166
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:21,163
Excuse me.

167
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:38,013
Excuse me.

168
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:45,229
I'm very sorry. I'm really sorry.

169
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:55,823
I'm sorry to bother you.

170
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:59,409
Can you tell me
what time we get to Cartagena?

171
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:02,412
Is this the bus to Cartagena?

172
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:04,665
I need to get to Cartagen...

173
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:46,291
What are we gonna do now?

174
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,961
Where's my suitcase?

175
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:09,689
You don't have to walk.
Another bus will come along.

176
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:12,692
What?

177
00:24:12,776 --> 00:24:15,904
They know nothing. They are peasants.

178
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,323
Another bus? Really?

179
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,074
Of course.

180
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,535
There are schedules to be maintained,

181
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,789
even in Colombia.

182
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:17,675
- What?
- The purse.

183
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:20,136
What do you...

184
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:41,593
What the hell...?

185
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:46,139
Jesus Christ!
What the hell happened to my birds?

186
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:50,644
Son of a bitch!

187
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:10,206
Hi.

188
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:21,676
<i>I demand this car in the name of the law.</i>

189
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,469
<i>Turn the car around. Let's go!</i>

190
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:26,347
Oh, no. Talk about breaks.

191
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:42,280
Don't I know you?

192
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:47,034
You are American.

193
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,587
I spit on 'em. I hate <i>americanos.</i>
They're scumo. Scum.

194
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,382
<i>Are you French?</i>

195
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:15,980
Well, honey, looks like we're gonna
have to wait just a little longer.

196
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,072
Excuse me. Could you please
tell me how to get to a telephone?

197
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:31,121
- No, lady. I don't have any idea. I'm sorry.
- It's very important that I get one.

198
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:34,750
Well, we've all got
our problems today, don't we?

199
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,211
Can you tell me where the nearest town is?

200
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:41,215
- How about Miami?
- Will there be another bus?

201
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,093
This is it. You got rush hour.

202
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:49,515
- I have to get to Cartagena.
- Cartagena?

203
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,394
Angel, you are hell and gone from Cartagena.
Cartagena's over there on the coast.

204
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:57,606
- But they told me this bus...
- Who told you that?

205
00:28:57,981 --> 00:29:01,276
- That man that...
- That nice man who pulled a gun on you.

206
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:04,571
What else did he tell you?

207
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:09,326
- Please, I need your help.
- That's my new career, huh?

208
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:11,870
- It's very imp...
- Lady.

209
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:15,541
Half a year's work just flew south
for the winter, all right?

210
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,751
My Jeep is totalled.

211
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:22,631
In about five minutes, everything I own
is gonna be wet. So could you lighten up?

212
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,428
I'll pay you. You don't understand.
It's a matter of life and death...

213
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:30,514
How much?

214
00:29:32,224 --> 00:29:34,309
$50?

215
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,481
You said you lost everything you owned.

216
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:43,861
- Not my sense of humour.
- I'll pay you $100.

217
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:46,029
200.

218
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,914
I'll do it.

219
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:59,294
- For five.
- What?

220
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:03,423
I'll pay you $250.

221
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:08,094
Now, I ain't cheap, but I can be had.

222
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,559
My minimum price for taking
a stranded woman to a telephone is $400.

223
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:19,397
- Will you take 375 in traveller's cheques?
- American Express?

224
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:22,317
- Of course.
- You got a deal.

225
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,194
Good.

226
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,236
<i>- Assemble your men!</i>
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>

227
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:42,106
You got any valuables in that suitcase?

228
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:45,609
No. Yes, all my clothes and things.

229
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:49,113
- You got an umbrella?
- No.

230
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:54,034
- You got a good pair of walking shoes?
- They're all like these.

231
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,594
OK, let's make some time.

232
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:14,305
You ba...!

233
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:06,525
Goddamn it, what a ride, huh?

234
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,405
I'm telling you, this is turning out
to be one hell of a morning.

235
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:16,868
You OK?

236
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:18,912
I said, are you hurt?

237
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:22,624
What's the matter? Paralysed
from the neck up? Are you hurt?

238
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:25,168
- No.
- Good.

239
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:28,130
What's your name?

240
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:30,507
I'm Joan Wilder.

241
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:34,469
Joan Wilder, welcome to Colombia.

242
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:46,106
Ira...

243
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:48,567
Oh, hi, Ma. It's me, Irving.

244
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:52,989
<i>- Ralph, you little twerp, where are you?</i>
- Calm down, Ma. Who says I never call?

245
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,158
<i>For Christ's sake, tell me the story.</i>

246
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,370
All right, cousin. As usual,
you got us in some serious shit here.

247
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,623
First of all, the stupid dame
got on the wrong bus.

248
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,919
Now I'm stuck in some kind
of spicko military compound.

249
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,923
They're mobilising for lwo Jima here.

250
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,677
<i>- Do they know who you are?</i>
- What do you think?

251
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,764
I'm going up, introducing
myself to every cop in the <i>pueblo?</i>

252
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,518
And another little tidbit, cousin.

253
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,146
Guess who else is here?

254
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,900
- Zolo.
- Well, give the man a cigar.

255
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,487
You're goddamned right, Zolo.
He got in my car.

256
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,366
Not only are we kidnappers, but I'm about
to have a close encounter with a cattle prod.

257
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,994
<i>- Has he got his boys with him?</i>
- No, no, no.

258
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,288
He's making do with the local yo-yos.

259
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,876
Oh, no.

260
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,379
- Look.
<i>- Goddamn it, Ralph. Get that map.</i>

261
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,590
Don't yell at me, Ira. Don't yell at me.

262
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,675
Look, you wanna kill me?

263
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:59,555
Take me back to Queens and kill me. Don't let
me die in a jungle like a goddamned snake.

264
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,851
<i>Ralph, goddamn it, I don't care</i>
<i>what you gotta do. Just get me that map.</i>

265
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,860
Little sister took the wrong road.

266
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:17,157
And that third party I told you about,
he's tagging along.

267
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:22,162
- The man who killed my husband?
- The butcher who killed your husband.

268
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,125
A very powerful man with
his own private army to back him up.

269
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,671
And whether he calls himself
Dr Zolo, Minister of Antiquities,

270
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:34,591
or Colonel Zolo,
Deputy Commander of the Secret Police,

271
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,177
he's still just a butcher.

272
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,351
Look at those snappers, will ya?

273
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:01,869
- What's the matter? You sick?
- No. I lost my button.

274
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:06,999
- You lost what?
- I lost my button.

275
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,210
You're gonna lose a lot more than that.

276
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,313
- These were Italian.
- Now they're practical.

277
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,734
Is nothing that I own sacred to you?

278
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,403
Only your $375.

279
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,953
Cops.

280
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:47,081
What the hell do they want?

281
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,667
I haven't done anything lately.

282
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,803
I'm shooting at a cop.

283
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:04,349
Wait a minute. He's after you.

284
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:09,813
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a romance novelist.

285
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,981
You're what?

286
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:17,278
- What are you doing here?
- I told you. My sister's life depends on me.

287
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:22,492
Don't give me that shit. I thought
you were donating a kidney or something.

288
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,744
Christ, here they come.

289
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,997
This may be a good time
to try on those shoes.

290
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,091
- Wait.
- Deal's off, lady.

291
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:41,177
Wait!

292
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,727
Lady, you are bad news.

293
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:57,570
What'd you do?
Wake up this morning and say,

294
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:00,489
"Today I'm gonna ruin a man's life"?

295
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,881
- Do you know where you're going?
- Looks like a trail.

296
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,341
This is a trail?

297
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,025
Lady, you are a jinx.

298
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:39,820
What about the bridge?

299
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:43,783
That ain't a bridge.
It's goddamn pre-Columbian art.

300
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,076
We can't get across that.

301
00:38:50,748 --> 00:38:52,750
All right.

302
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:57,171
We're gonna hold them off right from here.
You just stay right behind me.

303
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:01,842
Goddamn it.
I knew I should've listened to my mother.

304
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:28,787
I could've been a cosmetic surgeon.
500,000 a year, up to my neck in tits and ass.

305
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:44,761
Lady, I hope you're taking notes,

306
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:48,765
cos you got a real-live death scene
going on right here.

307
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,611
Romantic novelist, my ass.

308
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:42,236
Holy shit.

309
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:36,874
<i>- We can't cross.</i>
<i>- We won't catch them up.</i>

310
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,252
What the hell are you doing?

311
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:43,881
Drinkin'? I could've been killed,
and you're drinkin'?

312
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,138
Wait.

313
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:53,057
<i>Oh, yes. I will catch them up. Let's go!</i>

314
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,915
Are we stopping?

315
00:42:27,092 --> 00:42:29,303
Be my guest.

316
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:29,239
You OK?

317
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,334
Come on.

318
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,817
- Is anybody else in there?
- No.

319
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,778
No, it's a cargo plane.

320
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,532
What is all this?

321
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:17,620
All this? About five to life in the States.
A couple of centuries down here.

322
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:19,998
Oh, marijuana.

323
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:22,167
Oh, you smoke it?

324
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:25,712
I went to college.

325
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:27,297
Sure.

326
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,046
All right. OK.

327
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:13,719
Oh, God, do I love those flyboys.

328
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,407
What?

329
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:38,619
This is Elaine's favourite drink.

330
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,006
You gonna tell me about that sister of yours?

331
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,387
I already did.

332
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:06,606
Her husband died and
I've come down here to comfort her.

333
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,821
It's the truth.

334
00:46:18,326 --> 00:46:21,455
Right. Yeah, it's the truth.

335
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:28,253
All right. I'm gonna make a fire.

336
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:35,844
You got any dry matches in here?

337
00:46:39,598 --> 00:46:41,683
Well, looky here.

338
00:46:44,811 --> 00:46:47,105
Oh, no, don't!

339
00:46:51,526 --> 00:46:54,196
You and I ought to have a talk.

340
00:46:57,324 --> 00:46:59,409
All right.

341
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:10,796
Yeah, that's what I call a campfire.

342
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:23,893
So they're ransoming your sister
for this <i>El Coraz√≥n.</i>

343
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:27,939
That's Spanish for "the heart".

344
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:32,109
This map here leads to the heart.

345
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:36,113
But the heart of what?

346
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:38,991
I don't care.

347
00:47:42,995 --> 00:47:48,918
You see here where it says this <i>El Coraz√≥n</i>
is hidden in C√≥rdoba province?

348
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:52,171
So we're sitting right in the middle of it.

349
00:47:52,255 --> 00:47:56,175
All I care about is my sister.
And that map is her life.

350
00:47:57,009 --> 00:48:00,763
Like hell it is. Whatever's at the end
of this map is your sister's life.

351
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:04,642
Now, we get our hands on this <i>El Coraz√≥n,</i>

352
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,895
then you got something to bargain with.

353
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:12,233
- I knew it would happen.
- You knew what would happen?

354
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:16,571
All you care about is yourself. I knew that
from the moment I laid eyes on you.

355
00:48:16,654 --> 00:48:19,532
Oh, was that the first moment
when I saved your ass?

356
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:25,204
You see? There you go.
You have no finesse, no style.

357
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:29,459
A real man doesn't have to
draw attention to his actions.

358
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:33,546
You're just... You're a mondo-dizmo.

359
00:48:35,298 --> 00:48:37,342
What am I?

360
00:48:37,426 --> 00:48:41,013
You're a man who takes money
from stranded women.

361
00:48:41,096 --> 00:48:45,851
A real man is honest and forthright,

362
00:48:45,934 --> 00:48:47,811
and trustworthy.

363
00:48:50,439 --> 00:48:55,194
Would you please do me the courtesy of
looking at me when I'm speaking to you?

364
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:58,405
I mean, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

365
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:00,866
If you had any kind of manners...

366
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:29,353
Goddamn bushmaster.

367
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:31,522
Is it poisonous?

368
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:33,899
Yeah...

369
00:49:33,982 --> 00:49:37,110
But very tasty.

370
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:24,451
See, you gotta figure
sulphur-crested cockatoos,

371
00:50:24,576 --> 00:50:28,163
they go for about 800 a shot.

372
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:32,792
Then you got gentle red-tails.
They're close to 2,000 each.

373
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:39,174
I figure I lost close to 15,000 bucks
in that bus crash.

374
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,885
Wow.

375
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,555
You want to know something crazy?

376
00:50:45,638 --> 00:50:48,850
- What?
- I don't even know your name.

377
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:51,561
Well, you never asked me.

378
00:50:54,439 --> 00:51:00,612
- Excuse me. I'd really like to know.
- Colton. Jack T Colton.

379
00:51:01,654 --> 00:51:04,199
- What does the T stand for?
- Goddamn it, man.

380
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:07,076
The Doobie Brothers broke up.

381
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,706
- When did that happen?
- How long have you been down here?

382
00:51:13,249 --> 00:51:16,252
Forever. I don't know.

383
00:51:16,336 --> 00:51:19,757
Were you always into birds?

384
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,927
No, no. I was...

385
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,598
I was into shortcuts.

386
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:30,643
Birds just seemed to be
a fast way to get what I wanted.

387
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:34,146
And a hell of a lot healthier
than dealing in this crap.

388
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:37,817
What is it you want?

389
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:47,159
- I think I'll throw another key on the fire.
- No, please. I'm getting dizzy.

390
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:52,832
What do you want, seriously?

391
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:55,292
I'd really like to know.

392
00:51:59,964 --> 00:52:04,135
Came down here on a coffee boat
about a year and a half ago, right?

393
00:52:04,844 --> 00:52:07,596
Christ, what a job that was.

394
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:12,309
But I couldn't get over that ocean, you know.

395
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:16,564
Yeah, I love the ocean.

396
00:52:17,273 --> 00:52:22,486
You know, you just gotta
get out there all by yourself.

397
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:25,156
Nobody else around.

398
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:27,366
It's beautiful.

399
00:52:29,535 --> 00:52:31,620
So that's what I want.

400
00:52:31,704 --> 00:52:36,167
Try to get enough money together,
buy a boat, sail around the world.

401
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:41,381
So you're just gonna sail away,
all by yourself?

402
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:46,428
Yeah.

403
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:49,222
Sounds lonely, Jack T Colton.

404
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,695
Well,

405
00:53:03,778 --> 00:53:06,907
what does the T stand for?

406
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:11,328
Trustworthy.

407
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:31,389
Man, I tell ya... one hell of a morning.

408
00:53:32,182 --> 00:53:35,310
It's turned into a bitch of a day.

409
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:58,041
<i>Tenedor del Diablo.</i>

410
00:54:01,963 --> 00:54:04,048
The Devil's Fork.

411
00:54:29,991 --> 00:54:30,825
Zolo.

412
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:58,186
- Friendly, aren't they?
- Drug runners.

413
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,314
Just try to look mean.

414
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,782
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

415
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:38,268
- OK, here we go.
- What?

416
00:55:38,352 --> 00:55:41,396
I knew I should have listened to my mother.

417
00:55:43,524 --> 00:55:45,609
You ready?

418
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:52,491
Excuse me.
Gentlemen, we are in need of a car.

419
00:55:56,745 --> 00:55:59,873
Can any of you lovely gentlemen
tell me where...

420
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:05,462
Only one car in village. Juan, the bell maker.

421
00:56:06,922 --> 00:56:09,299
The bell maker.

422
00:56:10,217 --> 00:56:12,302
Thank you.

423
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:22,396
Bell maker, my ass. That fuselage we slept in
is probably one of Juan's lost shipments.

424
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:26,191
- You mean he's a drug de...?
- Don't say that word out loud, OK?

425
00:56:26,275 --> 00:56:29,319
- A dope...?
- Come on, let's go.

426
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:49,966
You hold back. This one, I'll handle.

427
00:57:06,357 --> 00:57:10,487
- What do you want, <i>gringo?</i>
- You speak English? That's great.

428
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:14,616
We understand that you have a car.
We would like to rent or buy it.

429
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:16,910
We have to get to a town.

430
00:57:16,993 --> 00:57:20,163
What do you call this I'm livin' in? A pigsty?

431
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:23,500
No. This is lovely...

432
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:27,170
- Hit the road.
- <i>Amigo,</i> you don't understand...

433
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,632
- Hit the road.
<i>- Se√±or,</i> I'd...

434
00:57:36,471 --> 00:57:38,765
It's cool.

435
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:41,518
It's no problem.

436
00:57:50,485 --> 00:57:53,154
OK, Joan Wilder. Write us out of this one.

437
00:57:53,279 --> 00:57:55,114
Joan Wilder?

438
00:57:56,032 --> 00:57:59,035
Joan Wilder? The Joan Wilder?

439
00:58:02,498 --> 00:58:06,085
- You are Joan Wilder, the novelist?
- Yes, I am.

440
00:58:06,919 --> 00:58:10,840
I read your books.
I read all your books. Come in.

441
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:15,553
<i>This is Juanita Wilder, who writes</i>
<i>the books I read to you on Saturdays.</i>

442
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:23,060
Come in.

443
00:58:23,144 --> 00:58:26,438
I can't believe you're here. Joan Wilder.

444
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:30,067
I've been reading your books all these years.

445
00:58:30,192 --> 00:58:32,820
I'm so honoured to have you here.

446
00:58:32,903 --> 00:58:35,072
Welcome to my humble house.

447
00:58:38,284 --> 00:58:42,496
I'm sorry. I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Juan. I live here.

448
00:58:45,249 --> 00:58:49,420
The greatest novelist. Get the door, please.

449
00:59:44,017 --> 00:59:47,062
Come in. Make yourself at home.

450
00:59:47,145 --> 00:59:49,523
- Ever read <i>The Return of Angelina?</i>
- No.

451
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:52,108
That woman makes me hungry.

452
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:56,571
- How about <i>Love's Wicked Kiss?</i>
- I haven't read that either.

453
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:59,825
Take it. I have many copies.
I have here <i>The Ravagers</i>

454
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:02,702
and I am waiting for
<i>Angelina's Savage Secret.</i>

455
01:00:02,786 --> 01:00:08,208
I am so glad you're here in Colombia. I want
to show you all around my beautiful village.

456
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:13,088
We have colourful tile roofs, typical
cobblestone streets, and very rich fields.

457
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:17,884
- I was born here, and so was my poor family.
- What I really want is a phone.

458
01:00:17,968 --> 01:00:21,721
No phones. I hate phones.
I don't have a phone.

459
01:00:21,805 --> 01:00:24,349
But have a drink. Let's hang out.

460
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,059
Look.

461
01:00:26,143 --> 01:00:29,104
Like it? I can be in one of your books.

462
01:00:29,187 --> 01:00:32,607
Oh, your drink. I got Southern Comfort.

463
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:39,322
Or Michelob, Kirin, Becks, Dos Equis,
Perrier, Anchor Steam, Doctor Brown...

464
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:42,660
- How about a Xerox machine?
- Yes, but she is broken.

465
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:51,836
- Where is the nearest phone?
- Many miles from here.

466
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:55,548
- Can we get there in your car?
- Who told you I had a car?

467
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:57,717
The men in the village.

468
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,678
They told you I had a car?
They're such comedians.

469
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:03,306
They meant my little mule, Pepe.

470
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,196
Not bad for a little mule, eh?

471
01:01:21,157 --> 01:01:23,701
Now Pepe's warming up.

472
01:01:27,622 --> 01:01:31,459
- What are we stopping for?
- I can't hurt my favourite pig.

473
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,725
Look out!

474
01:01:55,399 --> 01:01:58,945
See over there by the fence?
That's where my mother was born.

475
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:02,950
See that tree? The third tree up the ridge?
My brother planted that tree.

476
01:02:10,207 --> 01:02:12,960
OK, Pepe, let's lose 'em.

477
01:02:21,677 --> 01:02:24,429
- This guy's crazier than I am.
<i>- Gracias.</i> Yeah.

478
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:56,545
- What the hell ya doin'? That field was cover.
- I wanted to show you this other field.

479
01:03:00,507 --> 01:03:03,760
This guy who's following you,
he's very persistent.

480
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:25,283
No problem. My little mule is fireproof.

481
01:03:31,581 --> 01:03:34,709
- See that river?
- The one without the bridge?

482
01:03:36,002 --> 01:03:40,590
- It is the water supply for many villages.
- What do you mean, without the bridge?

483
01:03:40,673 --> 01:03:44,260
- It feeds into the Amazon.
- The one without the bridge.

484
01:03:44,344 --> 01:03:48,973
- Where the hell you going?
- Lupe's Escape. I used it often in the past.

485
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:31,766
You're OK now.

486
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:35,270
You need little mule to use Lupe's Escape.

487
01:04:35,353 --> 01:04:39,524
That river is impossible to cross
for 200 miles in either direction.

488
01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:46,490
In fact, over that mountain
the river becomes wild. <i>Muy peligroso.</i>

489
01:04:46,574 --> 01:04:48,784
Waterfalls, rapids.

490
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,037
Angelina country. Right, Joan?

491
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,999
Whatever happened to Lupe?

492
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:58,711
- Terrible disappointment to family.
- I can imagine.

493
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:02,006
He entered the priesthood.
So I took over the business.

494
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:04,300
Is for the best. I'm not so reckless.

495
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:07,678
He might have ended up hanging
from <i>El Tenedor del Diablo</i> there.

496
01:05:07,761 --> 01:05:11,056
- It used to happen to <i>bandidos.</i>
<i>- El Tenedor del Diablo?</i>

497
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:17,855
Hey, let's hit it. We're on a roll.

498
01:05:17,938 --> 01:05:22,693
I'm sorry I cannot take you to Cartagena.
Beyond this town I am a wanted man.

499
01:05:22,776 --> 01:05:26,030
But the bus will take you in the morning.

500
01:05:34,914 --> 01:05:38,000
Of all the things
you can say to me right now,

501
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:43,297
"I've lost her", Ralph, is gonna get
the most teeth broken in your mouth.

502
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:47,176
If they're hiking through the jungle,
there's nothin' I can do about it.

503
01:05:47,301 --> 01:05:50,095
I have a car. I am not Tarzan.

504
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:54,767
I have been through every one-horse shithole
for a 200-mile radius.

505
01:05:55,726 --> 01:05:58,938
You shoulda seen the river
I had to traverse this morning.

506
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,941
So don't give me any of your crap,
you gutless wonder.

507
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:06,446
You have been an embarrassment to me and
the whole family ever since you were born.

508
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,199
And one more thing, Ira...

509
01:06:10,492 --> 01:06:14,830
You are the luckiest son of a bitch that
walked the face of the earth. She's here.

510
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:18,500
- She's there?
- She's right here.

511
01:06:19,668 --> 01:06:22,462
She's coming right toward the phone booth.

512
01:06:23,255 --> 01:06:25,382
She's with some guy.

513
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:29,594
How do I know? She likes guys.
So do you, <i>maric√≥n.</i>

514
01:06:43,441 --> 01:06:49,406
- Yeah, all the rooms have baths.
- That's great. You speak English too.

515
01:06:50,782 --> 01:06:54,619
You wouldn't have a Xerox machine
around here, would ya?

516
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,873
Yeah. We have one in the back.

517
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:02,085
And it's big enough to take map size?

518
01:07:02,169 --> 01:07:04,254
Yeah. Complete.

519
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:08,133
Yes, I understand. I'll do that.

520
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:16,558
Elaine is all right.
They'll wait for me to take the bus tomorrow.

521
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:22,189
- That's great. Slide, man. You're covered.
- I don't know. He sounded so smug.

522
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,441
- Who?
- That bastard that's got Elaine.

523
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:27,570
Sure he is.
You're bringing him what he wants - the map.

524
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:30,615
Yeah.

525
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:36,204
Well, I guess this is it.

526
01:07:39,665 --> 01:07:41,751
I guess so.

527
01:07:44,086 --> 01:07:48,424
- $375. That was the contract, right?
- Yeah. That was it.

528
01:07:56,349 --> 01:08:00,394
The least I can do is buy you dinner.
Looks like it's gonna be a helluva party.

529
01:08:00,478 --> 01:08:02,647
I'd like that.

530
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:04,857
Listen, I got a room in the hotel.

531
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:08,528
Why don't you go get cleaned up?
I'll buy us some new rags.

532
01:08:08,611 --> 01:08:12,240
- Number seven.
- Seven? That's my lucky number.

533
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:15,827
Mine too.

534
01:08:52,948 --> 01:08:55,784
It's just beautiful.

535
01:08:55,868 --> 01:08:57,911
Thank you, Jack.

536
01:09:14,011 --> 01:09:17,222
I think your writing's hot. It's great.

537
01:09:17,306 --> 01:09:20,309
I mean it. I'm tellin' ya, I'm impressed. I am.

538
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:25,314
- You've never even read the book.
- I know.

539
01:09:26,064 --> 01:09:28,442
I suppose...

540
01:09:28,525 --> 01:09:31,904
it's my way of living in another age.

541
01:09:31,987 --> 01:09:35,115
If you did that, I never would have met you.

542
01:09:37,034 --> 01:09:39,495
I got you something.

543
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:50,672
<i>El Coraz√≥n?</i>

544
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:20,662
- Let's dance.
- I can't.

545
01:10:20,745 --> 01:10:23,039
I'll show you.

546
01:11:10,628 --> 01:11:13,089
I lost my <i>langostino.</i>

547
01:12:49,104 --> 01:12:51,481
Someday, if I had the money,

548
01:12:51,606 --> 01:12:56,319
I'd take you and sail away.

549
01:12:56,403 --> 01:12:58,530
Just the two of us.

550
01:12:59,447 --> 01:13:02,242
Around the world and back again.

551
01:13:05,162 --> 01:13:08,748
I promise you we'd do that.

552
01:13:17,257 --> 01:13:20,719
Why haven't you taken
the map away from me?

553
01:13:23,638 --> 01:13:25,724
What are you talking about?

554
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:30,437
I saw that tree today,
the Devil's Fork, that's on the map.

555
01:13:31,313 --> 01:13:36,109
- You know how close we are?
- Sure, but what's that got to do with it?

556
01:13:36,193 --> 01:13:39,946
I was thinking about what you said,
about having more to bargain with.

557
01:13:40,071 --> 01:13:43,158
Yeah. Your best way to help Elaine
is to get that treasure.

558
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:46,912
Then you could waltz into Cartagena.
You're holding all the cards.

559
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,917
I'd love to see you on that boat.

560
01:13:53,502 --> 01:13:57,255
But, Jack, if we have to give it up
to save Elaine...

561
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,633
Then we give it up. It's your sister.

562
01:13:59,716 --> 01:14:04,012
Hell, yeah. Of course we give it up.
But at least we've got the leverage to do it.

563
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:17,777
Let's go for it.

564
01:15:11,038 --> 01:15:13,499
He just won't quit.

565
01:15:28,432 --> 01:15:31,226
- What are you doing?
- I'm hot-wiring the car.

566
01:15:31,351 --> 01:15:33,645
Try the key.

567
01:16:01,965 --> 01:16:04,676
There it is. That's the shrine.

568
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,720
Let's go.

569
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:40,337
This can't be all.
There's gotta be another clue.

570
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:45,425
Well, landmarks change, things grow.
All that stuff, you know.

571
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,557
You hear that?

572
01:16:51,516 --> 01:16:53,601
Waterfall.

573
01:16:53,685 --> 01:16:55,770
Look, Jack.

574
01:16:57,939 --> 01:16:59,023
All right!

575
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:23,047
- You all right?
- Yeah.

576
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,971
This has got to be it.

577
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:35,894
What does <i>Leche de la Madre</i> mean?

578
01:17:37,312 --> 01:17:41,149
<i>- Leche de la Madre?</i>
- Yeah. It's on the map.

579
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:44,611
It means "mother's milk".

580
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:46,779
Mother's milk?

581
01:18:02,295 --> 01:18:04,380
I'll be goddamned.

582
01:18:05,757 --> 01:18:07,884
Mama, I'm home.

583
01:18:14,016 --> 01:18:16,894
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- What?

584
01:18:17,686 --> 01:18:20,689
Digging for treasure with you.

585
01:18:22,525 --> 01:18:24,985
Jack?

586
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:27,488
Yeah?

587
01:18:27,613 --> 01:18:30,741
You're the best time I've ever had.

588
01:18:33,828 --> 01:18:37,665
Never been anybody's best time before.

589
01:19:12,491 --> 01:19:14,743
It's a priceless statue.

590
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:23,127
Somebody out there's got
a really sick sense of humour.

591
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:27,298
Wait a minute.
My first book, <i>Treasures of Lust,</i>

592
01:19:27,381 --> 01:19:30,510
I hid the treasure inside the statue.

593
01:19:52,782 --> 01:19:55,911
Jesus Christ, we're in a lot of trouble.

594
01:19:57,037 --> 01:20:00,165
Understatement of the year, asshole.

595
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:04,961
Is there anybody who isn't following you?

596
01:20:06,004 --> 01:20:09,132
Put the goods in the bag.

597
01:20:13,553 --> 01:20:15,806
Now move it, before Batman comes home.

598
01:20:15,889 --> 01:20:19,309
It's time I had a chauffeur, Miss Wilder.

599
01:20:20,227 --> 01:20:25,732
- Back off me, creep. Just back off.
- Oh, I'm the creep, huh? At least I'm honest.

600
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:29,903
I'm stealin' this stone. I'm not tryin'
to romance it out from under her.

601
01:20:30,237 --> 01:20:33,740
Wait a minute.
Going for the stone was my idea.

602
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:38,328
That's what all the good
con artists want you to think.

603
01:20:38,411 --> 01:20:40,705
He made you think you needed it, you sap.

604
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:44,126
Get in and drive. Move it.

605
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:49,256
Move it.

606
01:20:49,548 --> 01:20:52,218
See how you like being stuck in...

607
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:54,387
Holy shit!

608
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,767
Get in.

609
01:21:03,646 --> 01:21:06,190
- Which way do we go?
- Follow that stone.

610
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:25,877
Mounties!

611
01:21:35,386 --> 01:21:37,472
Hit it.

612
01:21:59,202 --> 01:22:02,330
- Where the hell are you goin'?
- Where am I goin'?

613
01:22:03,748 --> 01:22:07,001
How about Lupe's Escape?

614
01:22:26,647 --> 01:22:29,942
Where you goin'? Quit steering.
You're not going anywhere.

615
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:42,913
What are we gonna do now?

616
01:22:42,996 --> 01:22:45,082
Jump.

617
01:23:18,323 --> 01:23:21,743
Joan Wilder! What a comeback!

618
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:27,416
Man, I thought you drowned.

619
01:23:27,499 --> 01:23:29,585
I did.

620
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:33,381
- You OK?
- Sure.

621
01:23:33,465 --> 01:23:36,426
I'm great. I'm fine.

622
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:38,595
Only you're on that side.

623
01:23:39,387 --> 01:23:43,141
- There's no way across this sucker.
- You did this on purpose.

624
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:46,436
What the hell you talkin' about?
We went over a waterfall.

625
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:51,566
Admit it. You planned this all along.
I knew I couldn't depend on you.

626
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:58,364
What's the name of that hotel in Cartagena?

627
01:23:58,573 --> 01:24:01,493
Hotel Cartagena. What do you care?

628
01:24:01,576 --> 01:24:07,624
All right. Now you just head towards the
sunset and you'll make it. And I'll be there.

629
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:12,712
Yeah, sure. With <i>El Coraz√≥n</i>
in your pocket. What about my sister?

630
01:24:12,796 --> 01:24:16,216
Well, they don't have to know about this.

631
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:19,385
- You got the map.
- Well, you've got the stone.

632
01:24:25,892 --> 01:24:28,937
I'll meet you there. Trust me.

633
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,814
What?

634
01:25:10,521 --> 01:25:13,065
So you made it finally.

635
01:25:14,316 --> 01:25:18,154
- Got the map?
- Yes. I brought it. I want to talk to Elaine.

636
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,032
No, you can't talk to her till I get it.

637
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:24,201
Look out your window.

638
01:25:25,202 --> 01:25:29,123
<i>See the fort across the bay? The tower?</i>

639
01:25:29,206 --> 01:25:32,710
You take a water taxi right outside your hotel.

640
01:25:32,793 --> 01:25:35,963
You meet me there in two hours,

641
01:25:36,046 --> 01:25:38,215
all by yourself.

642
01:25:57,026 --> 01:26:01,405
- Has Jack Colton checked in?
- <i>In the last two minutes, no.</i>

643
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:24,614
Over here.

644
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,420
Stop right there.

645
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:41,507
- Let me see the map.
- Where are you?

646
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:46,095
- Let me see the map.
- Let me see Elaine.

647
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:50,266
Joanie?

648
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:03,237
Drop the map and back off.

649
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:14,665
If this isn't genuine...

650
01:28:17,168 --> 01:28:20,129
If you've pulled a fast one...

651
01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:39,273
Joan Wilder,

652
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:42,735
you and your sister...

653
01:28:44,529 --> 01:28:46,239
can go.

654
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:54,873
It's OK.

655
01:29:06,218 --> 01:29:09,096
I missed you at the hotel.

656
01:29:13,308 --> 01:29:15,394
We all did.

657
01:29:24,778 --> 01:29:27,739
You brainless broad.
You let him follow you here.

658
01:29:34,121 --> 01:29:36,373
This map is nothing.

659
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:38,917
They already have the stone.

660
01:29:43,839 --> 01:29:46,884
I had it in my hands, Ira.

661
01:29:46,967 --> 01:29:51,305
These hands that are gonna break
every bone in your body.

662
01:29:55,809 --> 01:29:57,895
Later.

663
01:30:08,864 --> 01:30:11,575
Where is it?

664
01:30:11,658 --> 01:30:14,203
I don't know.

665
01:30:14,286 --> 01:30:18,041
- Where is the stone?
- I don't...

666
01:30:21,753 --> 01:30:24,881
We dug. We didn't find anything.

667
01:30:56,913 --> 01:30:59,749
Crocodiles shed tears
when they eat their prey.

668
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:02,669
You have heard of these tears, I am sure.

669
01:31:02,752 --> 01:31:05,547
But have you seen them?

670
01:31:07,006 --> 01:31:08,633
Stop it!

671
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,238
Look at those snappers.

672
01:31:31,656 --> 01:31:36,036
You can forego this agony.
Simply tell me, where is <i>El Coraz√≥n?</i>

673
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:39,790
Where is the heart? Where is the stone?

674
01:31:39,915 --> 01:31:42,459
All right. Just let her go, will ya?

675
01:31:42,585 --> 01:31:46,630
- She doesn't know where it is. I've got it.
- Where is it?

676
01:31:51,135 --> 01:31:54,096
- In a safe place.
- Where is it?

677
01:31:58,934 --> 01:32:01,020
Where is it?

678
01:32:42,645 --> 01:32:43,729
Choke on it.

679
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,327
Thank you.

680
01:33:10,423 --> 01:33:12,300
Get down!

681
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:30,068
Come on.

682
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:55,093
Hurry.

683
01:33:58,972 --> 01:34:02,350
All right, <i>muchachos.</i> Bring the boat around!

684
01:34:02,434 --> 01:34:06,813
Hold them down! Let me get to the boat!

685
01:34:43,226 --> 01:34:45,144
Just a little more.

686
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:06,249
Ira!

687
01:35:08,376 --> 01:35:11,879
- Come back here, Ira.
- Jump, Ralph.

688
01:35:11,963 --> 01:35:16,092
- I can't swim. You know that, Ira.
- I'll come back for you.

689
01:35:16,175 --> 01:35:19,846
- You promise?
- I'll send the boat back for you, Ralph.

690
01:35:19,929 --> 01:35:21,889
- When?
- Soon.

691
01:35:21,973 --> 01:35:25,476
- How soon?
- Very soon.

692
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:33,985
No!

693
01:35:39,575 --> 01:35:43,328
Where do you think you're going, pal?
Come on. Cough it up.

694
01:35:43,787 --> 01:35:45,706
Wait.

695
01:35:51,128 --> 01:35:53,213
Joanie?

696
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:58,886
How will you die, Joan Wilder?

697
01:35:58,969 --> 01:36:02,598
Slow like a snail?

698
01:36:03,599 --> 01:36:06,226
Or fast like a shooting star?

699
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:42,971
Jack!

700
01:36:59,781 --> 01:37:02,909
Come on, you bastard. Give me a break.

701
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:12,669
Damn it.

702
01:38:31,123 --> 01:38:32,666
Jack.

703
01:38:35,836 --> 01:38:37,880
It's OK.

704
01:38:37,963 --> 01:38:39,799
Come on back, Ira.

705
01:38:39,882 --> 01:38:42,593
You're my cousin, Ira. Don't you remember?

706
01:38:42,676 --> 01:38:45,930
Your mother, my mother.

707
01:38:47,264 --> 01:38:50,142
That way. He's gettin' away.

708
01:38:50,684 --> 01:38:53,020
He's got it all. Go that way.

709
01:38:53,395 --> 01:38:54,980
Joanie?

710
01:38:55,064 --> 01:38:59,485
OK. Here's what we gotta do. Get to
the American consulate. Tell 'em everything.

711
01:38:59,568 --> 01:39:02,446
- Where are you going?
- They might even believe you.

712
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:06,367
Don't mention my name.
Cartagena cops and I go way back.

713
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:11,288
- Elaine, it's been a pleasure.
- You're leaving? You're leaving me?

714
01:39:24,343 --> 01:39:27,388
You're gonna be all right, Joan Wilder.

715
01:39:45,574 --> 01:39:47,659
You always were.

716
01:39:56,751 --> 01:39:58,837
Jack Colton!

717
01:40:06,178 --> 01:40:08,263
Damn.

718
01:40:30,869 --> 01:40:34,122
Well, that is far and away your best book.

719
01:40:34,206 --> 01:40:37,167
I can't believe how fast you cranked this out.

720
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:41,004
- So you really like it?
- Like it? Look at me. I'm a mess.

721
01:40:41,087 --> 01:40:44,341
It made me cry.
Don't tell anybody or I'll cut your heart out.

722
01:40:44,424 --> 01:40:47,177
I love the end where he
dives in and swims away.

723
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:52,557
Then he meets her at the airport.
They sail off around the world together.

724
01:40:52,641 --> 01:40:55,852
God, I can't believe how this got to me.

725
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:59,482
Well, I was inspired.

726
01:40:59,565 --> 01:41:04,237
Joanie, you are now
a world-class hopeless romantic.

727
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,989
No. Hopeful.

728
01:41:11,536 --> 01:41:13,621
Hopeful romantic.

729
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,045
No, thank you.

730
01:41:22,296 --> 01:41:24,382
Never wear 'em.

731
01:42:12,513 --> 01:42:14,599
I like your boots.

732
01:42:14,682 --> 01:42:19,479
That poor old yellow-tailed guy
developed a fatal case of indigestion.

733
01:42:19,563 --> 01:42:21,940
Died right in my arms.

734
01:42:22,065 --> 01:42:26,487
I can't blame him. If I were to die,
there's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be.

735
01:42:26,778 --> 01:42:31,408
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I even read one of your books.

736
01:42:32,576 --> 01:42:35,621
Then you know how they all end.
