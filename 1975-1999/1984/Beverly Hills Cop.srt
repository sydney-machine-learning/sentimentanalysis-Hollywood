1
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,659
Truck looks great.
Must be a fortune here.

2
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,440
I know, just not in front of him, OK?

3
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:37,797
Fellas, what's going on?
I've been here too long.

4
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:40,770
- Give us a minute.
- No. Check this out.

5
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:45,661
You can't get no cleaner. These are
very popular with the children.

6
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:49,017
This is a federal tax stamp.
You can't get no cleaner.

7
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,799
You keep 'em
if it's such a great deal.

8
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,539
l ain't from Detroit. I don't know
nobody who can handle a job this big.

9
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:59,471
You're supposed to have the
connections. Do what you want to do.

10
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,978
- lt ain't easy to get rid of this.
- I know, but I'm a businessman.

11
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:07,431
Warm up the truck.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

12
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:10,692
- Here you go.
- You're a sharp kid.

13
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:12,418
Thank you.

14
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,734
Cousin, my man, don't dash yet.
This looks like $2,000, not $5,000.

15
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,994
- Let me see.
- The deal is for 5,000.

16
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:23,159
l told my people
there should be five grand.

17
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:26,995
- They stiffed us.
- No, they stiffed you.

18
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:31,215
You can't count on anybody.
But let's not hassle about it now.

19
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,147
Take the two grand and on the next
score, I'll make it up to you.

20
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:38,408
Don't jerk me off. This is bullshit.

21
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,669
l need $5,000, not $2,000.
Don't do this to me.

22
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,546
Come on, you ain't dealin'
with Johnny Bananas.

23
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,231
l know I ain't.
Can I have my money?

24
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:51,163
Can I say it slow for you?
l need $5,000. Read my lips.

25
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:54,712
$5,000 is what I need.
l can't do nothing with that.

26
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:58,068
You want to be an asshole,
smoke 'em yourself.

27
00:03:58,356 --> 00:04:00,849
l don't smoke Lucky Strike.
l smoke King Size Kent.

28
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:06,316
Fuck this.
Nice doing business with you.

29
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:08,618
What you doing here?

30
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:12,070
Officer, you know what happened?
You ain't going to believe it.

31
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:16,194
The truck just stopped. You got
some cables, you give me a jump?

32
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:20,797
- Don't I know you?
- No, I'm from Buffalo.

33
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,552
Break out some lD.

34
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,169
Let's get the fuck outta here!

35
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:03,415
Shit!

36
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:35,674
Freeze, asshole!

37
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,799
Foley, we should have known
it was you!

38
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:54,663
Axel. Way to go!

39
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:56,965
- I don't have time.
- Todd's after you.

40
00:07:57,157 --> 00:08:01,473
He said it's your worst fuck-up.
l don't think that's true.

41
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,062
- He's not in there.
- I see that.

42
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:08,378
lf you'd busted them, maybe he
wouldn't be so mad, but you haggled.

43
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:11,638
$2,000 wasn't enough.
They'd have known I was a cop.

44
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,803
- Leave me alone.
- Don't go anywhere.

45
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,488
- You asshole.
- I'm not saying you did wrong,

46
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:20,941
but if you had busted them,
it would have been better.

47
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,243
- Where you going?
- Out of here.

48
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,736
- Big mistake. You want my advice?
- No.

49
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:28,805
Go in there, talk to him.
He'll be right back.

50
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:31,970
Jeff, get away from me.
I'm going to shoot you.

51
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:35,998
- You know what I would do?
- Lighten up. I'm not listening. OK?

52
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,587
You're making it a lot worse
for yourself.

53
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,601
Look at this. Thank you, guys.

54
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:42,807
Axel, you got a cigarette?

55
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:47,986
- Did you write that one?
- Everybody knows about the truck.

56
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,247
Will you listen to me?
l am not listening to you.

57
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,411
Great. Real mature.

58
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:58,152
l am not listening to Jeffrey,
but he's still talking.

59
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,604
- I hate when you do that.
- Stop, then!

60
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:05,153
- ls that fucking Foley in here?
- There's Todd, it's show time.

61
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:08,797
Boss, I know...

62
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:13,113
Where do you come off going
undercover without my authorisation?

63
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:17,333
You want to play cowboy cop,
do it in someone else's precinct.

64
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,552
- Want to hear my side of the story?
- What's your side of the story?

65
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,621
Let's hear your side of the story.

66
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:28,553
Do you know how much this stunt
of yours is going to cost this city?

67
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:33,157
Cost isn't the issue. It's my blatant
disregard for proper procedure.

68
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:35,554
You're damn right, wise-ass!

69
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:38,911
The mayor called the chief,
he called the deputy,

70
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:42,459
he chewed my ass out.
You see I don't have any of it left!

71
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,432
Where the fuck d'you get
the cigarettes from, anyway?

72
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:49,652
- From the Dearborn hijack.
- That bust went down last week.

73
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,297
- That truck should be in the pound.
- I told you.

74
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:56,366
- It's none of your business.
- This isn't my locker.

75
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:59,818
Listen, Axel.
No more set-ups, you understand?

76
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,312
You're a good cop
with great potential,

77
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,805
but you don't know
every fucking thing.

78
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:09,313
I'm tired of taking the heat for you.
Once more and you're on the street.

79
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,422
- Do you understand?
- Look...

80
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,724
Do you understand me?

81
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,464
Yeah, I understand. Boss...

82
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:22,164
Chief ain't chewed it all.
You still got some ass.

83
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:26,575
Don't fuck with me, Axel.
Not now. Go on, go home.

84
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,081
How you doing, man? How you doing?

85
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:55,574
Still breaking in people's houses.

86
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:58,547
What do you expect with that lock?
Buy a real lock.

87
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:01,328
l got my pistol.
I'll shoot somebody.

88
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,315
l can't afford no electric, close
my fridge. There's roaches in there.

89
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,713
So what's up, man? Look at you!

90
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,782
- When did you get out?
- Six months ago.

91
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,659
And you're just coming to see me now?

92
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:18,879
l got out early for good time and
l went to California, get some sun.

93
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,989
l gotta show you something.

94
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,249
l ain't seen you in two years, man.
What's up?

95
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,045
10,000 Deutschmarks.

96
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:31,155
- Deutschmark?
- Yeah.

97
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:34,895
- What is that?
- They're bearer bonds. Untraceable.

98
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,005
You stole 'em?

99
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:40,361
- No.
- I don't want to hear it.

100
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:43,814
- It's just good to see you.
- I missed you, man.

101
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:47,171
- What were you doing in California?
- Working.

102
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,376
- Working where?
- Guess.

103
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,582
- I don't know.
- Beverly Hills.

104
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:56,377
- What were you doing?
- You won't believe this.

105
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:59,063
l was a security guard.

106
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,899
Who'd hire you as a security guard?

107
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,064
- Jenny Summers.
- Jenny Summers?

108
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:09,324
l haven't seen Jenny in years.

109
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,530
- What's she up to?
- She's doing great.

110
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:13,640
She's manager of this art gallery.

111
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,517
The Hollis Benton Art Gallery,
Beverly Hills.

112
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,915
It's world famous. Ever hear of it?

113
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:21,984
Yeah, I buy all my art there.

114
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:23,998
Corner pocket, two cushions.

115
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,971
- 50 bucks you don't make that shot.
- Bullshit.

116
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,464
- 100.
- You got a bet.

117
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,589
- What are you gonna do?
- You're as bright as always.

118
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:44,329
20, 40, 60, 80, take it.
Have a party.

119
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:47,302
Pleasure doing business with you.

120
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,604
What the fuck you gonna do?

121
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,002
Miss, two more Scotch and sodas.

122
00:13:56,605 --> 00:13:59,770
l got a great idea.
l got a great idea.

123
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,222
Let's steal a car.

124
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,538
Are you serious?

125
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,895
I'm a fucking police officer.
l can't steal cars no more.

126
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:13,868
How many times
have you stolen a car, man?

127
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:15,978
A fucking Cadillac!

128
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:23,458
Driving on the expressway
like two fucking maniacs.

129
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:29,021
l remember you went to jail for that.

130
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:33,528
- No, it was state school.
- That's jail when you're 15.

131
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:37,364
That ain't jail, man. That's like
day camp compared to jail.

132
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:41,968
How come you didn't tell on me
when you got caught?

133
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,228
You don't know?

134
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,256
- You don't know?
- No.

135
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,243
Because I love you, man.

136
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,587
One more round.

137
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:08,533
Hold still. Mike, I gotta open
the door, OK? Balance yourself.

138
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,931
Here we go, Mike.

139
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:16,014
I'm opening the door now, OK?
Here we go.

140
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,932
Axel!

141
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,933
Hey, Mikey, where have you been?

142
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,947
What's up, Zack?

143
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:29,056
What have you got there, Mikey?

144
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,070
What is this? Your laundry?

145
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:36,153
l swear,
l was going to bring 'em back.

146
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:38,551
- You got lost?
- No.

147
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:42,675
l came to see my friend. I had 'em
with me. I figured, you know...

148
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:47,758
- What you doing?
- What am I supposed to do, Mikey?

149
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:52,361
There was a whole box of them. l
didn't think anybody'd miss a couple.

150
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,471
l figured l'd take 'em...

151
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,444
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

152
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,458
No, shut up.

153
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:03,870
- Man, please.
- Just shut up, Mikey.

154
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:09,240
l swear...

155
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,762
l swear, if you ever show
your face out there again...

156
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,269
- Ever.
- I won't. I promise you. I'm sorry.

157
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:24,201
l fucked up, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

158
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,695
- Ever.
- I'm sorry.

159
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,945
Axel, go to the hospital and get
that bump on your head checked out.

160
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,494
- My head is all right, man.
- It's not a request, Axel.

161
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:14,647
Boss. Boss...
Can I talk to you for a minute?

162
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:18,579
l heard you got Rand on this case.

163
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,785
He doesn't know the time of day.

164
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:22,703
Don't mess with me.

165
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:25,292
He hasn't left his desk in 12 years.

166
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:28,073
At least he's had 12 years.

167
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:33,348
Anyway, it's a homicide case and it
belongs to Rand. Go to the hospital.

168
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,609
- Can I ask around a bit?
- Don't do a thing.

169
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,582
You're skating on thin ice as it is.

170
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,267
We're talking about a friend of mine!

171
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:44,473
Yes, we are, aren't we?

172
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,487
Let's take a close look at that.

173
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,131
One, a hoodlum friend.
Two, a professional hit.

174
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,529
Three, in a cop's apartment.

175
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,214
This whole thing
stinks to high heaven.

176
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:59,722
- Why a professional hit?
- I didn't just walk into this town.

177
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,078
Whoever killed your friend
wasn't worried about you.

178
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,723
lf they were, you'd be lying
beside him in that meat wagon.

179
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,983
Don't do a damn thing.
Stay out of this.

180
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:13,915
I'm owed some vacation time.
l want to take my vacation now.

181
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:16,121
Stay away from this case.

182
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,574
l just need a little vacation,
that's all.

183
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,767
All right, as soon as you finish
at the hospital, you're on vacation.

184
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:28,685
Thank you.

185
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:31,658
But if you decide
to butt into this case,

186
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,398
it'll be the longest vacation
you ever heard of.

187
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:05,548
- Checking in today, sir?
- That depends. This hotel expensive?

188
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:09,192
Not for Beverly Hills.
Can I get your bags for you?

189
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:13,891
Yeah, that's my bag
in the front seat.

190
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:27,318
I'm sorry, sir, we just
have nothing available tonight.

191
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,811
l suggest next time
you call for a reservation

192
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,921
at least a week in advance.

193
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:34,031
Thank you.

194
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:36,237
- Hi.
- The nerve of some people!

195
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:37,771
May I help you?

196
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,881
You have a reservation
for Axel Foley.

197
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,991
Let's see.

198
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:46,211
I'm sorry, I don't see
anything under that name.

199
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:50,718
Check Rolling Stone Magazine's
Axel Foley, that's what it is.

200
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:57,336
No, no Rolling Stone, no Axel Foley.
I'm sorry, sir.

201
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:02,131
You probably just made a mistake.
Just give me another room.

202
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,816
Sorry, sir,
but there are none available.

203
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,954
Don't you think I realise what's
going on? Who do you think I am?

204
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:13,735
lf I was some hotshot
from out of town

205
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:18,339
and you'd made a reservation mistake,
l'd be the first to get a room.

206
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:22,175
I'm not some hotshot, I'm
a small reporter from Rolling Stone,

207
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,573
here to do an interview
with Michael Jackson,

208
00:21:24,764 --> 00:21:27,354
that's gonna be
in every major magazine.

209
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:30,902
l wanted to call it Jackson
ls Sitting On Top Of The World.

210
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:33,875
Now I'll call it
Jackson Can Sit On Top Of The World

211
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:37,424
But Not ln The Beverly Palm Hotel
Cos There's No Niggers Allowed.

212
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:42,027
Excuse me, sir, it seems
we have a last-minute cancellation.

213
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,521
There is a room available, a suite,

214
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:47,590
but I'll charge you
the single-room rate.

215
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:50,275
Thank you. I'm sorry,
it's probably jet lag.

216
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,385
- I understand.
- What's the rate?

217
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,495
That'll be $235 a night, sir.

218
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,112
Fine.

219
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:04,085
- That'll be suite 1035.
- Thank you very much.

220
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:06,099
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

221
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:09,647
lf Michael calls,
tell him what room I'm in.

222
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,702
Of course.

223
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,752
- How you are doing?
- Hi.

224
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:16,493
I'm fine. My name is Serge.
How can I help you?

225
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:18,794
I'm looking for Miss Jenny Summers.

226
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,589
It's very busy today.
You give me your name?

227
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:26,946
- My name's Axel Foley.
- What it's pertaining?

228
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:31,454
- I didn't understand.
- Pertaining, meaning, regarding...

229
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:34,235
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance.

230
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,345
Donny.

231
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,359
One moment.

232
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:43,154
Donny, tell Miss Summers
that Ahmed Farley's here to...

233
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:46,319
- No, Axel Foley.
- Ahmel...Ahwell...

234
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:51,018
Foley's here,
he's an old acquaintance.

235
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,840
Cover this up.

236
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,005
It's like the breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

237
00:23:56,197 --> 00:23:58,690
- It's not sexy, it's animal.
- Not sexy at all.

238
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:03,869
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, cocktail, espresso?

239
00:24:04,828 --> 00:24:05,883
No, thank you.

240
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:09,144
l make it myself, with a lemon twist.
You should try it.

241
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,733
No, I'm fine.

242
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:15,569
- I see you look at this piece.
- How much would it go for?

243
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:17,392
$130,000.

244
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,693
- Get the fuck outta here.
- No, I cannot.

245
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,899
It's a very important piece.

246
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:24,776
- Ever sold one of these?
- Yesterday.

247
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:28,900
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I'm serious. I sell it myself.

248
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:30,818
What are you doing here?

249
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,367
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. Hold on a second.

250
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:36,956
Great. Excuse me, Serge.

251
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,368
- What are you doing here?
- How you doing?

252
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,957
It's good to see you.
How've you been?

253
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:46,067
- Look at you!
- You like?

254
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:48,177
Yeah. You're getting old.

255
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:49,903
Fuck you.

256
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:52,013
- What is this?
- A moustache.

257
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,561
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

258
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,671
You have someplace we can talk?

259
00:24:57,767 --> 00:25:01,316
Yeah. Over there. Come on.

260
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:03,905
- You've filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

261
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:06,015
No, it looks good, though.

262
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,221
Sit down.

263
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:13,112
- I want to talk about Mikey.
- ls he in trouble again?

264
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:18,387
He's dead.

265
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:21,935
What?

266
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:24,908
He came into Detroit
and somebody killed him.

267
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,416
l don't believe this.

268
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,171
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

269
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:48,884
Mikey mentioned
that you helped him get a job.

270
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:50,418
Yeah...

271
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:55,118
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favour to me.

272
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:59,146
- Who's this guy?
- His name is Victor Maitland.

273
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,229
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

274
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:06,722
l can't talk now,
l have to go upstairs.

275
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:09,024
That's cool.

276
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:12,764
I'll call you later on
and we'll get together and talk, OK?

277
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,490
Sure.

278
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,655
Be good.

279
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:28,109
Hi. Delivery for Victor Maitland.

280
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:30,411
I'll take it upstairs to him.

281
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,616
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

282
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,726
Deliveries should be left here.

283
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:37,507
He has to get these flowers.
I'll go up myself.

284
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:39,521
You're not supposed to.

285
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:42,494
Floral delivery is my life.
l have to take it.

286
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,659
- Who let you in?
- I let myself in.

287
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:49,112
How you doing? I have some questions
about Michael Tandino.

288
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,715
Speak to you later, darling.

289
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:59,565
What, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr Tandino?

290
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:03,210
He was my best friend. He visited me
in Detroit a couple of days ago.

291
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,375
Soon after he got there,
someone killed him.

292
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,964
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

293
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,978
It's fucked up.

294
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:15,677
And? What do you wish to know?

295
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:20,664
- He worked for you, didn't he?
- Yes, yes, he did.

296
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,966
Good gracious!

297
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:26,322
I'm really sorry to hear this.
Would you like to sit down?

298
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,104
Can I get you anything?

299
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:33,419
- No, I'm all right.
- How on earth did this happen?

300
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:36,201
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

301
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:40,324
Yeah.

302
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:44,832
l do hope the police have procured
some intelligent leads.

303
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:49,531
Exactly what did Mikey do for you?

304
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:53,847
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

305
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,244
My name is Foley.

306
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:59,697
Excuse me, Mr Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

307
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:04,013
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

308
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:07,945
So, if you'll forgive me,
l must get back to work.

309
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:12,165
- All I want to know is...
- Please show Mr Foley to the door.

310
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,562
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

311
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,974
Get off me, man.
Get the fuck off me. Get off!

312
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:22,714
Get the fuck off me, man. Get off!

313
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:29,715
Get off me. Think I'm playing games?
I'm fucking somebody up.

314
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:41,128
What the fuck is this shit?

315
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,457
Did you see that?
l can describe them all.

316
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:50,047
Put your hands
on the hood of the car.

317
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:53,499
- What's with you guys?
- You heard him, sir. Do it now.

318
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:57,431
What kind of shit is this?
Wait a second.

319
00:28:57,623 --> 00:29:00,788
You're arresting me
for getting thrown out of a window?

320
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,185
l got thrown out of a window, man!

321
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:05,295
Gun, partner!

322
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:09,036
Sir, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

323
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:11,721
Anything you say will be used
against you in court.

324
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:14,023
You have the right
to have an attorney.

325
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:16,133
l understand the rights.

326
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:19,010
This is bullshit.
l got thrown out of a window.

327
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:21,599
- Get in the car.
- What's the charge?

328
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,956
Possession of a concealed weapon
and disturbing the peace.

329
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,257
l got thrown out of a window!

330
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:30,422
What's the charge for getting
pushed out of a car, jaywalking?

331
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,436
This is bullshit!

332
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:42,986
You know, this is the cleanest and
nicest police car I've ever been in.

333
00:29:43,273 --> 00:29:45,192
It's nicer than my apartment.

334
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:54,494
Officers, if we see any movie stars
could you point them out to me?

335
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:56,604
That's enough talking.

336
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,810
OK, that's cool.

337
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:08,304
This is nice.

338
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,881
It's about time. I thought
you'd forgot me. I was hungry.

339
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:20,484
I've never seen a cell with a phone.
Could I stay cos I ordered pizza?

340
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,334
Somebody'll eat it.

341
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,680
Have a seat right over there, please.

342
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:58,654
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this
is my partner, Detective Rosewood.

343
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,778
Do you always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

344
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:07,573
Why didn't you say you were a police
officer when you were arrested?

345
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,450
Where do you get off
arresting somebody

346
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,752
for getting thrown out of a window?

347
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:15,629
Six witnesses say you started
tearing up the place,

348
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:17,643
then jumped out the window.

349
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,383
You believe that? What the fuck
are you, cops or doormen?

350
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,932
We're more likely to believe
an important local businessman

351
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,137
than a foul-mouthed jerk.

352
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:29,439
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

353
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:35,865
- Watch your mouth.
- Don't square off on me.

354
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:38,454
- Don't push me.
- Fuck you, man.

355
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:41,811
Taggart!

356
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,167
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

357
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,389
Sir...

358
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:06,074
l apologise for striking you.

359
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,431
l have no excuse.

360
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:13,651
Forget about it.

361
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:17,967
l am Lieutenant Bogomil of
the Beverly Hills Police Department.

362
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:21,803
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

363
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,817
ls this a joke?

364
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:28,036
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

365
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:32,640
Where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

366
00:32:32,928 --> 00:32:35,517
No, I don't want to do that.

367
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:38,969
ln Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

368
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:41,751
Why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

369
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:44,052
I'm on vacation.

370
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:47,026
Then why were you
in Victor Maitland's office?

371
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:50,574
l had to go to the bathroom.
lt looked like a nice clean place.

372
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:57,767
- Always take your gun on vacation?
- Don't know. Never been on vacation.

373
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,644
But, in Detroit,
cops must always carry a firearm.

374
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:03,617
lf you want to carry a gun,
go back there.

375
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:06,014
l really can't wait to get back.

376
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:10,042
ls that so? I just spoke
to lnspector Todd in Detroit.

377
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,440
Does that name ring a bell?

378
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,907
- He's my boss.
- You may not be welcome back.

379
00:33:20,016 --> 00:33:22,606
He says you're
an outstanding young detective.

380
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,195
l find that difficult to believe.

381
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,017
It's true.

382
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:31,141
He also says he nearly fired you.
l find that very easy to believe.

383
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:34,786
What are you doing here?

384
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:37,183
I'm on vacation.
l went to the bathroom

385
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,389
and six guys threw me out a window.

386
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:43,417
lnspector Todd gave me a message
for you. Wanna hear it?

387
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:44,664
No.

388
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,829
He says if you're here
investigating the Tandino murder,

389
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:50,034
don't bother coming back.

390
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:53,295
lf we inform him
you are working on this case,

391
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:55,405
he'll have you fired.

392
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:58,570
One last time, what are you doing?

393
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:00,584
I'm on vacation!

394
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:02,214
Vacation.

395
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:06,146
Rosewood, take Mr Foley
over to the courthouse

396
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:08,736
and let him arrange for bail.

397
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:10,845
Follow me, sir.

398
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:14,969
l got to hand it to you guys,
you are extremely polite.

399
00:34:16,312 --> 00:34:18,997
Pretty good punch you got, Taggart.

400
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,848
After you.

401
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:27,916
After you.

402
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,218
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

403
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:33,575
Thanks for bailing me out, Jen.

404
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:37,315
lf l'd known why you'd been arrested,
l wouldn't have come.

405
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:41,439
- You don't mean that.
- No, I don't mean that.

406
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:44,508
lf it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
l'd be a waitress.

407
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,015
The day Mikey got killed, he showed
up with a bag of German bearer bonds.

408
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,893
l think he stole them
from whoever killed him.

409
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:55,249
When I mentioned Mikey's name,
Maitland threw me out.

410
00:34:55,537 --> 00:35:00,428
You look like a hoodlum. You barge
into his office, carrying a gun.

411
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:03,593
lf I didn't know you,
l'd throw you out.

412
00:35:03,784 --> 00:35:05,511
ls this your car?

413
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,388
No. ln Beverly Hills
we just take the closest one.

414
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,759
l remember you used to drive
that crappy blue Chevy Nova.

415
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,060
What are you driving now?

416
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:19,129
The same crappy blue Chevy Nova.

417
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,390
Do you think it's too late
for me to study art?

418
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:25,459
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

419
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:29,199
You don't think he has anything
to do with Mikey's death?

420
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:33,515
No, I was just poking around.
l don't think he did nothing.

421
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:38,502
Victor is one of the top art dealers
in the US, he has been for ten years.

422
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,995
I'm impressed.

423
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:48,764
- What are you looking at?
- The cops, they're following us.

424
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:51,449
What? Where?

425
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:55,189
ln the back, on the right.
Beige Ford.

426
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:25,015
Can you believe this place?

427
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:27,413
How can you afford this?

428
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:29,810
They only charged me
the single-room rate.

429
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:32,304
- How can you afford that?
- I can't.

430
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:34,893
ln the bathroom they got little robes

431
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:37,195
with the hotel's initials on it.

432
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:39,593
l love this place, I can't leave.

433
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,894
- I'm going to steal one. Want one?
- No.

434
00:36:42,086 --> 00:36:45,155
You want some slippers?
I'm going to steal them, too.

435
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:47,745
Excuse me, two seconds.

436
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:54,937
Hello, room service?
This is Mr Axel Foley in suite 1035.

437
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:58,294
l'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

438
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,267
l want you to deliver it
to this beige Ford on Wilshire.

439
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:05,487
Send down one bay shrimp
salad sandwich. OK?

440
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:10,090
Right. And is the cold poached salmon
in dill sauce tasty?

441
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:14,598
OK, send one of those down.
And send down something for dessert.

442
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:16,899
All right. Thank you.

443
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:18,913
You're quite a sport.

444
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:21,695
How long are you going to stay?

445
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:24,092
Until I find out who killed Mikey.

446
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:31,189
And I'm considering checking out
the warehouse where he worked.

447
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:34,450
Really?
How you planning on getting in?

448
00:37:54,494 --> 00:37:56,412
- Good evening, sir.
- What is that?

449
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:59,097
Late supper,
compliments of Mr Axel Foley.

450
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:03,892
- Foley? How'd he know we were here?
- Because I let you drive.

451
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,290
l need a couple of bananas. How much?

452
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:11,277
The buffet plate is $12.50. You get
peaches, plums, oranges and bananas.

453
00:38:11,565 --> 00:38:14,346
All I need is a couple of bananas.

454
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,539
Go ahead, take those bananas.

455
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,649
Thank you.

456
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,813
- I'm not eating that. Take it back.
- Certainly.

457
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,923
This really looks great.

458
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:45,419
- Could I get some extra mayo?
- Certainly, sir.

459
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,584
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

460
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:52,803
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

461
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:09,395
What the hell are you doing?

462
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:21,383
This the place?

463
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:24,260
Yeah, but I'm not sure
l should do this.

464
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:28,288
OK, but when you hear glass breaking,
don't get scared.

465
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,453
It's just me kicking in the window.
Sit tight.

466
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:35,001
All right. Come on, Axel.

467
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:59,840
- What's happening, baby?
- Grow up.

468
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,623
- Did you find something?
- Coffee grounds.

469
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:18,733
So?

470
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:21,131
You know what this is used for?

471
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:23,433
People add hot water and drink it.

472
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:27,652
I'll take this home, add hot water
and drink it in the morning.

473
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:43,476
What are we hiding for?

474
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:46,162
l wish you'd been with me last night.

475
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:51,053
- What happened?
- We stopped in a joint for a drink.

476
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:53,067
- Which one?
- A local joint.

477
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,095
Some guy comes in,
sits a couple of stools away.

478
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:01,123
He's got one of them eyes
that's going like this.

479
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:04,384
l didn't know whether he was trying
to put the make on me.

480
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,589
l thought l'd take you there tonight,

481
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:10,138
let him have a shot at you
before I tore his head off.

482
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,605
Let's go. I want to get out of here.

483
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:25,578
- Just get off my back.
- Come on.

484
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:31,333
l got it.

485
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:50,417
- What the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later.

486
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:52,623
Hurry up.

487
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:55,117
- Give me the key.
- Ever driven a Mercedes?

488
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:57,802
A car's a car.
l drive mine every day.

489
00:41:57,994 --> 00:42:01,542
- I'm driving, I've seen your car.
- Shit, that's cold.

490
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:13,147
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

491
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,353
- He distracted us.
- How?

492
00:42:15,544 --> 00:42:18,901
He sent us a late supper.
This waiter comes over...

493
00:42:19,189 --> 00:42:21,107
Billy, he gets the point.

494
00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:25,231
A late supper?
And what did you have, Rosewood?

495
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,985
l think it was
a shrimp salad sandwich, sir.

496
00:42:31,273 --> 00:42:34,629
- A shrimp salad sandwich?
- Yes, sir.

497
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,247
l want you two to go back
to the hotel and wait for Foley.

498
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:44,795
lf you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. Got that?

499
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,385
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:50,645
A late supper.

501
00:42:52,563 --> 00:42:54,673
We've got something for you, Billy.

502
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:58,414
An anti-banana disguise.

503
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:05,414
- lt may come in handy.
- A little extra protection, Billy.

504
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:08,579
Very funny.

505
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:11,552
Let's go.

506
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:29,870
- You take the car and go home.
- What about you?

507
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:32,843
l want to find out about this place.

508
00:43:32,939 --> 00:43:34,857
It's a bonded warehouse.

509
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:38,501
They hold our foreign shipments
till they clear customs.

510
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:41,091
I'm going to check it out. Go home.

511
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:44,927
Damn it, Axel.
I'm not going to bail you out again.

512
00:43:45,215 --> 00:43:47,229
Go home.

513
00:44:40,743 --> 00:44:43,524
How you doing?
Come here for a second, please.

514
00:44:45,538 --> 00:44:47,936
- Hi, you have a match?
- No smoking in here.

515
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:51,772
I'm going to smoke when
l go outside. Thank you very much.

516
00:44:51,964 --> 00:44:53,978
- ls your supervisor here?
- ln the office.

517
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,183
- Will you get him?
- What's the problem?

518
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,430
You security?

519
00:44:57,622 --> 00:45:00,787
Then you're the fucking problem.
Get your supervisor. Now.

520
00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:02,801
Now!

521
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:04,239
OK.

522
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:12,967
He didn't come back yet.

523
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:17,954
What do we do now?

524
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:20,064
We wait.

525
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:23,708
OK.

526
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,777
- Can I help you?
- Are you the supervisor?

527
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:29,846
- Yes. Who are you?
- lnspector Rafferty, US Customs.

528
00:45:30,038 --> 00:45:33,299
- Has all this gone through customs?
- No, this is the bonded area.

529
00:45:33,586 --> 00:45:36,943
Then tell me,
how can a black man, dressed like me,

530
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:39,724
just march in and start poking around

531
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:42,505
without being asked any questions?

532
00:45:43,752 --> 00:45:46,150
- I don't know.
- That's the answer I wanted.

533
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:49,506
Give me your lD numbers.
Somebody's going to lose their job.

534
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:53,438
- He gave me a match.
- You gave him a match?

535
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:56,699
Listen. I do security checks
all over the nation.

536
00:45:56,891 --> 00:45:58,809
And apart from Cleveland,

537
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,974
this place has the worst security
in the nation.

538
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,755
Call your wives
cos we'll be here all night.

539
00:46:04,947 --> 00:46:07,920
We're gonna check the background
of every crate,

540
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:10,030
starting with this one.

541
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:16,935
lt says here that by the time
the average American is 50,

542
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:21,346
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

543
00:46:22,785 --> 00:46:24,607
Why are you telling me this?

544
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:28,347
What makes you think
l have any interest in that at all?

545
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:31,896
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

546
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:35,348
The inspector needs
the information on those bills.

547
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,266
All the manifests, too.

548
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:40,815
And records of all shipments
due into the same destination.

549
00:46:41,103 --> 00:46:43,116
- What's this about?
- Just do it.

550
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:45,898
You got a warrant for this?

551
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,213
You have a very big mouth, sir.
Are you hiding something from me?

552
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:53,570
l bet that's your Porsche outside.
ls it?

553
00:46:53,762 --> 00:46:57,886
Would you like me to have the lRS
crawl up your ass with a microscope?

554
00:46:58,174 --> 00:47:01,051
It's not pretty.
l want you to know something.

555
00:47:01,242 --> 00:47:05,462
l want you all to know, I could
have 25 agents here in 15 minutes,

556
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,778
to march in here, snatch your bond
and you'd be out of business,

557
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:11,984
if you don't cooperate. Understood?

558
00:47:12,175 --> 00:47:14,669
We'll give you everything you need.

559
00:47:15,724 --> 00:47:18,409
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche, sir.

560
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:22,437
You've nothing to worry about, then.
You all take me for a fool. Hurry!

561
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,795
l notice you've been drinking
a lot of coffee lately.

562
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:37,974
l think that's why
you have a hard time relaxing.

563
00:47:56,291 --> 00:48:00,703
Jesus Christ!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

564
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:04,827
- What are you doing here so late?
- You're a cocky son of a bitch.

565
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:07,800
lf you're still mad
about the banana, I'm sorry.

566
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:09,814
l needed some time to myself.

567
00:48:10,006 --> 00:48:13,650
l wish l'd seen your face
when the car conked out.

568
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:16,719
Very funny. The lieutenant
docked us two days' pay.

569
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:18,829
Get outta here!

570
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:24,583
- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

571
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:27,844
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

572
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:30,817
lt was a joke, like the bananas.

573
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:36,571
l know what it's like on a stakeout.
That food was from the heart.

574
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:39,064
Bullshit!

575
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:42,996
Why are we always arguing? We're all
cops. We should work together.

576
00:48:43,668 --> 00:48:45,298
We've all had a rough day.

577
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,902
What do you say we go get something
to drink, make up and be friends?

578
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,970
Forget it.

579
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:57,862
OK, fuck it. I'm going to get
a drink. Follow me if you want.

580
00:48:58,149 --> 00:49:00,835
But I lost you once, I can again.

581
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:04,479
Why don't we get something
to drink together? Let's be friends.

582
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:07,931
- We don't drink on duty.
- OK. Fine.

583
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:12,247
But listen. I found
the perfect place. I saw it today.

584
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:16,467
It's perfect for you. It's
very conservative. You'll love it.

585
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:18,960
It's nice. Trust me.

586
00:49:42,553 --> 00:49:44,567
- Hi. Can I get you something?
- Yes!

587
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:48,691
Can I have a Scotch and soda?
What do you want?

588
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:51,664
- Light beers for them.
- Two club sodas.

589
00:49:53,006 --> 00:49:56,075
You crack me up
with this ''on duty'' shit.

590
00:49:56,267 --> 00:50:00,007
Billy, you don't have to be
embarrassed if your dick is hard.

591
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:04,131
Your dick is supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object.

592
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:07,392
Taggart's dick is hard,
but he won't say. He's the boss.

593
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:09,310
Boss's dick got to stay limp.

594
00:50:09,502 --> 00:50:12,283
l ain't on duty
so my dick can be hard.

595
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:17,750
Taggart, look. I found that
at Maitland's warehouse.

596
00:50:18,613 --> 00:50:21,202
- Billy! Give her this.
- No.

597
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,791
Stuff that in her thing.
She'll go nuts.

598
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:26,189
Excuse me.

599
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:29,642
Billy.

600
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:34,629
- What do you think?
- Coffee grounds. So?

601
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:39,040
You guys don't know nothing
about nothing, do you?

602
00:50:39,232 --> 00:50:42,972
Make sure we get the right drinks.
l drink club soda, I'll throw up.

603
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:46,425
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

604
00:51:08,962 --> 00:51:10,881
- She likes you.
- Think so?

605
00:51:11,072 --> 00:51:12,799
No doubt.

606
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:17,498
Taggart... See that guy
over there in the black coat?

607
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,101
- Black jacket?
- Yeah.

608
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:25,362
It's June.
lsn't it hot for a long leather coat?

609
00:51:26,321 --> 00:51:28,239
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

610
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,541
Look at his partner.
They just came in.

611
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,103
Something's getting ready to go down.

612
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:39,172
- Go and cover that guy.
- What's going on?

613
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:44,063
I'll check out this asshole at the
bar. Billy will make sure I behave.

614
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,132
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

615
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,982
No bullshit this time.

616
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,545
Just sit tight, Billy.

617
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:26,357
Philip!

618
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:28,946
Man, what's happening, Phil?

619
00:52:29,138 --> 00:52:33,741
He said you don't come here no more,
but I said, ''It's Phil''.

620
00:52:34,604 --> 00:52:37,002
- Get out of here, man.
- I told you!

621
00:52:37,194 --> 00:52:39,879
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- I said get outta here!

622
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:44,675
Everybody freeze!

623
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,168
Turn around. Turn around!

624
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,141
- Phil!
- Keep your hands on the table!

625
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,826
What's wrong?
What's all the hostility?

626
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:55,800
- Get back.
- What's all this gun, man?

627
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:57,909
You changed.

628
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:00,019
Get back or I'll
blow your brains out.

629
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,486
Police. Move and I'll kill you.

630
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,938
Don't move! Turn over!

631
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:13,158
Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some cop. You know that?

632
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:17,474
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

633
00:53:27,448 --> 00:53:28,695
Taggart.

634
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:33,298
Would you explain why
you and Rosewood were in a strip bar

635
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,175
out of our jurisdiction
while you were on duty?

636
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:40,203
Before you chastise these officers,
there's something you should know.

637
00:53:40,491 --> 00:53:45,478
The only reason they were at a strip
bar is because they were tailing me.

638
00:53:45,766 --> 00:53:48,451
They were outside
wondering what I was doing.

639
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:51,711
l was in having a good time.
I'm into those things.

640
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:55,835
These guys waited outside
and the only reason they came in

641
00:53:56,027 --> 00:54:00,343
was because they saw two men with
bulges in their jackets going in.

642
00:54:01,302 --> 00:54:03,891
Well, these guys
were going to commit a robbery.

643
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:08,111
They watched them, waited for them to
make their move, then foiled a crime.

644
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:11,180
l did not know what was going on.

645
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:14,153
I'm freaked out.
They must have a sixth sense.

646
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:18,852
l don't know what you teach them,
but they're not just regular cops.

647
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,770
They're supercops.

648
00:54:20,962 --> 00:54:23,839
The only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

649
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:29,689
ls this what really happened?

650
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:33,334
No, sir.

651
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,540
Would someone tell me what happened?

652
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:39,568
Well...

653
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:44,075
Foley invited us to this bar.
We accepted.

654
00:54:44,363 --> 00:54:47,144
- We ordered club sodas, sir.
- Right.

655
00:54:47,336 --> 00:54:49,733
And while we were there,

656
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:52,035
Foley observed the two suspects

657
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:54,049
casing the establishment.

658
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:57,118
And before we knew what was going on,

659
00:54:57,406 --> 00:54:59,995
he'd already disarmed one of them.

660
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:05,462
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrests, sir.

661
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:09,682
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance,

662
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:12,463
but if you want to practise
law enforcement,

663
00:55:12,654 --> 00:55:15,148
l would prefer you did it in Detroit.

664
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:18,697
l understand. I'm sorry.

665
00:55:18,888 --> 00:55:21,382
But before I go
l want you two to know,

666
00:55:21,573 --> 00:55:23,875
the supercops story was working.

667
00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:29,629
OK? lt was working
and you guys just messed it up.

668
00:55:30,013 --> 00:55:34,137
I'm trying to figure you guys out,
but I haven't yet. But it's cool.

669
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:37,494
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie
and it's all right.

670
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:46,413
You guys are off the case.

671
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,961
Foster, McCabe, your turn.

672
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:54,948
- Don't lose him.
- Not a chance, sir.

673
00:55:57,058 --> 00:55:59,072
And you two...

674
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:01,182
ln my office.

675
00:56:17,965 --> 00:56:20,554
Morning, gentlemen.
Coffee and doughnuts?

676
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:24,391
- What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.

677
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:31,583
There he is.

678
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:49,805
Morning, officers.
You the second team?

679
00:56:50,956 --> 00:56:52,778
We're the first team.

680
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,368
We won't fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

681
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,532
You won't fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?

682
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:01,314
lt should be more natural,
brother, like this.

683
00:57:01,602 --> 00:57:05,533
''l ain't falling for no banana in my
tailpipe.'' It's more natural for us.

684
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:09,082
You've been hanging out
with this dude too long.

685
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:13,589
I'm sorry, I'm just fucking with you.
That's funny to me.

686
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:17,713
- You gonna try to keep up with me?
- No problem.

687
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,454
- lsn't this Victor Maitland's house?
- Yeah, I think so.

688
00:57:24,043 --> 00:57:26,824
I've seen enough.
You want something to drink?

689
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:29,222
l got some stuff in the trunk.

690
00:57:29,414 --> 00:57:31,236
Excuse me.

691
00:57:42,361 --> 00:57:45,429
For a man on vacation,
you look like you're on a stakeout.

692
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:50,033
Stakeout? No, no. I'm picnicking.
This is a picnic area.

693
00:57:57,609 --> 00:58:00,391
I've been shooting the shit
long enough.

694
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:03,364
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

695
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,672
What the hell's he doing?

696
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:53,461
Can you put this in a good spot?

697
00:59:53,653 --> 00:59:56,435
This shit happened
last time I parked here.

698
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:25,302
May I help you?

699
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:28,178
I'm looking for Victor Maitland.

700
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,535
You realise that
this is a members only club?

701
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:34,412
l have to talk to Victor.
It's very important.

702
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,385
- Victor Maitland, are you sure?
- Yes.

703
01:00:37,577 --> 01:00:40,838
Grey-haired gentleman.
Very dark skin. Capricorn.

704
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:45,154
Why don't you give me the message
and I'll take it to him?

705
01:00:45,345 --> 01:00:50,141
OK. Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago...

706
01:00:50,428 --> 01:00:53,114
Tell him that
Ramon went to the clinic,

707
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:56,182
and I found out that I have...

708
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,292
herpes simplex 10.

709
01:00:58,484 --> 01:01:01,649
l think Victor should check himself
out with his physician

710
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:04,526
before things start falling off
on the man.

711
01:01:07,404 --> 01:01:09,417
Perhaps you better tell him that.

712
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:15,268
- I think that would be best.
- So do l.

713
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,242
Hi, Victor.

714
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:36,366
I'm back.

715
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:44,518
Look, guys, don't even try it.

716
01:01:45,573 --> 01:01:47,779
Why don't you
get the hell out of here?

717
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:50,177
Get the fuck away from me, man.

718
01:02:05,905 --> 01:02:09,837
Very good, Victor. Could you teach
him to roll over and sit, too?

719
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:13,673
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

720
01:02:13,865 --> 01:02:17,605
- Last time, I didn't get the chance.
- I've nothing to say to you.

721
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,386
That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

722
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:23,839
This is a very nice place, Vic.

723
01:02:24,606 --> 01:02:27,100
Hi. I like this. This is nice.

724
01:02:28,059 --> 01:02:30,840
Glad you like it.
l must make you a member.

725
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:37,553
Victor, I know that you're into
a lot of crooked shit.

726
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:41,006
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

727
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:43,883
And when I find out for sure,

728
01:02:44,074 --> 01:02:45,993
I'm going to fuck you up real bad.

729
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:48,103
ls that so?

730
01:02:48,294 --> 01:02:51,172
Now listen to me,
my tough little friend.

731
01:02:51,363 --> 01:02:54,912
l don't know
from under what stone you crawled

732
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,364
or where you get
these ridiculous ideas about me,

733
01:02:58,556 --> 01:03:00,858
but it seems painfully obvious

734
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,447
you haven't
the slightest fucking idea

735
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:05,749
who you're dealing with.

736
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:08,914
Now, my advice to you

737
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:12,174
is crawl back to your little stone
in Detroit

738
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:15,627
before you get squashed, OK?

739
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:19,367
- Please step away from the table.
- Gotta go now, Vic.

740
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:22,436
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

741
01:03:28,382 --> 01:03:30,013
Catch you later, Vic.

742
01:03:30,972 --> 01:03:32,794
l can't wait.

743
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,947
Don't I know you guys?
You look so familiar.

744
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,701
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

745
01:03:53,989 --> 01:03:56,770
Why are you bothering
Victor Maitland?

746
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:03,291
l had a friend, Michael Tandino,
who used to work for him.

747
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:07,703
Maitland had him killed. When I can
prove it you'll be the first to know.

748
01:04:10,196 --> 01:04:12,690
Forget what you can prove,
talk to me.

749
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:19,691
OK. Listen. Everybody knows Victor
Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.

750
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:22,952
But I poked around.
Art's not the only thing he deals.

751
01:04:23,143 --> 01:04:25,637
l saw some guys in his warehouse

752
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,938
unloading a crate
of German bearer bonds.

753
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,679
Michael Tandino had bonds
like this on him, coincidentally,

754
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,789
when he was killed.

755
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:36,570
Just because Maitland invests
in the same bonds

756
01:04:36,762 --> 01:04:38,584
doesn't mean he's a killer.

757
01:04:38,776 --> 01:04:41,557
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler,

758
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:43,667
be it bonds, drugs or whatever.

759
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:46,736
The crate I saw
didn't even pass through customs.

760
01:04:46,927 --> 01:04:49,325
Maitland is paying
to get his shipments out

761
01:04:49,517 --> 01:04:51,147
before they're inspected.

762
01:04:51,339 --> 01:04:55,463
When his guys get it, they take
the drugs or bonds out of the crates

763
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:59,491
and they send it back before customs
even knows what's going on.

764
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:05,149
- And you witnessed this?
- Everything except for the drugs.

765
01:05:05,341 --> 01:05:07,355
But I found coffee grounds
everywhere.

766
01:05:08,602 --> 01:05:11,767
- Coffee grounds?
- What does that mean?

767
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:15,028
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.

768
01:05:15,795 --> 01:05:18,384
Very good. Now what do we do?

769
01:05:19,823 --> 01:05:21,741
Look, Detective Foley, l...

770
01:05:22,988 --> 01:05:25,865
I'm sorry.
l'd really like to help you.

771
01:05:27,015 --> 01:05:29,317
lf you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

772
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:33,345
but if your only evidence is coffee,
we can't get a search warrant.

773
01:05:33,537 --> 01:05:35,359
We can get around that.

774
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:38,524
We don't ''get around''
search warrants.

775
01:05:39,962 --> 01:05:43,607
Taggart, I want you
to start checking this out.

776
01:05:43,895 --> 01:05:46,868
Start with the LAPD,
the FBl and the Customs Service.

777
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,800
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.

778
01:05:51,087 --> 01:05:53,197
We snoop around, he'll close down

779
01:05:53,389 --> 01:05:55,786
and get his shipments from elsewhere.

780
01:05:55,979 --> 01:05:59,623
Really? ls that what your
extensive experience tells you?

781
01:05:59,815 --> 01:06:02,596
l haven't been on the force...

782
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,336
Shit.

783
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:09,021
- ls this the man?
- Yes, sir.

784
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:14,008
The gentleman that crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

785
01:06:14,296 --> 01:06:17,749
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

786
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,283
Yes, sir.

787
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,256
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

788
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:25,901
into a gross dereliction of duty

789
01:06:26,188 --> 01:06:28,778
at a striptease establishment?

790
01:06:28,969 --> 01:06:31,176
It's Rosewood, sir.

791
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:33,285
Yes, sir.

792
01:06:33,477 --> 01:06:35,779
ls this the gentleman
who ruined the buffet

793
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:37,697
at the Harrow Club today?

794
01:06:38,848 --> 01:06:40,286
Yes, sir.

795
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:44,986
l just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

796
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:52,658
Lieutenant,
l'd like to see you in your office.

797
01:06:52,945 --> 01:06:54,864
Yes, sir.

798
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:02,344
ls this the man who wrecked the
buffet at the Harrow Club today?

799
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:06,180
- Lower your voice.
- Can he hear me through the wall?

800
01:07:06,852 --> 01:07:08,770
Yes, he can.

801
01:07:24,594 --> 01:07:29,293
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

802
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:31,499
watch him pack,

803
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,280
and escort him to the city limits.

804
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:36,678
Then you can give him his gun back.

805
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:42,336
The two charges of disturbing the
peace have been dropped against you.

806
01:07:42,624 --> 01:07:44,926
But if you return to Beverly Hills,

807
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:47,131
the charges will be reinstated

808
01:07:47,323 --> 01:07:50,584
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

809
01:07:50,871 --> 01:07:53,365
- Sir, may I say something?
- What?

810
01:07:53,557 --> 01:07:55,475
He seems to have enough...

811
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,873
You want to tell that to the chief?

812
01:07:59,023 --> 01:08:01,996
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

813
01:08:03,723 --> 01:08:05,833
Come on, Axel.

814
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:26,356
Right. Let me check on that tomorrow
and get back to you.

815
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:28,466
Thank you.

816
01:08:28,658 --> 01:08:30,576
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

817
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:35,083
- Sit down. I'm not interrupting?
- Of course not.

818
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:38,248
There's a gentleman in town
from Detroit

819
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,317
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

820
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:46,592
He came by the office yesterday and
asked me all sorts of odd questions.

821
01:08:46,879 --> 01:08:48,510
Excuse me, darling.

822
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:50,907
l believe his name is Foley.

823
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:53,209
Since you were a friend of Michael,

824
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:56,374
l was wondering
if you knew the fellow.

825
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,251
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.

826
01:08:59,443 --> 01:09:01,553
Really? Have you seen him lately?

827
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:05,389
He came in yesterday.

828
01:09:06,156 --> 01:09:08,362
What? He came by here?

829
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:12,678
And?

830
01:09:13,924 --> 01:09:16,993
He told me that Mikey
had been killed.

831
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,350
Yes. Yes, I know.

832
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:25,816
- And then?
- That's it.

833
01:09:26,008 --> 01:09:29,557
He left and I haven't seen him since.

834
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:34,640
Jenny, darling,
do you know where he's staying?

835
01:09:34,832 --> 01:09:38,188
l have some information
which might be helpful for him.

836
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:43,559
No, I have no idea.

837
01:09:52,574 --> 01:09:54,684
l hope I didn't disturb you.

838
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:57,657
- No problem.
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?

839
01:09:58,711 --> 01:10:00,917
- That'd be lovely.
- Take care.

840
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:17,221
l read the manifests. They're
expecting another shipment in today.

841
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:19,811
Bogomil...

842
01:10:19,906 --> 01:10:23,838
This is a chance for me and you
to blow this case wide open.

843
01:10:24,126 --> 01:10:26,236
l wish I could, but I can't.

844
01:10:26,428 --> 01:10:28,058
Why?

845
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,456
Because Bogomil would kill me.

846
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:38,128
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery.

847
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,772
It's easy. Jenny will let us in
Maitland's warehouse.

848
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,074
The shipment arrives, we nail them.

849
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:47,239
- How can you be sure it'll be drugs?
- I got a hunch.

850
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:52,130
A technique by which many crimes
outside Beverly Hills get solved.

851
01:10:52,418 --> 01:10:55,295
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

852
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:59,898
He does everything by the book.
ls everybody in this town a robot?

853
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:02,871
This thing is very personal to me.

854
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,954
All he asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

855
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:11,407
Now I'm going to screw that up, too.

856
01:11:13,517 --> 01:11:17,833
Billy, I love you.
l just fell in love with you.

857
01:11:20,997 --> 01:11:22,819
Jenny, how are you?

858
01:11:22,915 --> 01:11:25,601
This is my buddy Billy Rosewood.
Jenny Summers.

859
01:11:25,888 --> 01:11:28,861
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

860
01:11:29,053 --> 01:11:30,875
That's Serge.

861
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:33,657
Can you get my friend an espresso?

862
01:11:33,848 --> 01:11:36,054
You want it with a lemon twist?

863
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:39,794
Sure, if it's no bother.

864
01:11:39,986 --> 01:11:42,479
No, don't be stupid.

865
01:11:42,671 --> 01:11:45,932
Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

866
01:11:46,124 --> 01:11:48,330
He was acting real weird.

867
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:51,399
Look, I want to get back
inside the warehouse.

868
01:11:52,262 --> 01:11:54,180
How about I go with you?

869
01:11:54,372 --> 01:11:57,440
You work in a gallery.
You're not a cop.

870
01:11:57,632 --> 01:12:01,660
lf this has to do with Mikey's death,
l want to check it out.

871
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:03,866
l don't have time to argue with you.

872
01:12:04,538 --> 01:12:08,374
Let me get my keys
and we'll argue on the way.

873
01:12:12,018 --> 01:12:15,662
Billy, you sit here and observe.
Don't move till I get you.

874
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:19,690
- Why can't I come in?
- Cos you're a cop in this town.

875
01:12:19,978 --> 01:12:22,951
Without probable cause,
it's an illegal search.

876
01:12:23,143 --> 01:12:25,541
Didn't they teach you that
in cop school?

877
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:28,801
- I find some evidence, I'll get you.
- You can't...

878
01:12:29,089 --> 01:12:34,556
Be cool, all right? lf anything
jumps off, I'll come and get you.

879
01:12:35,802 --> 01:12:38,967
ls there any chance
you'll let me go in by myself?

880
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:41,077
No chance.

881
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,337
Fuck. Come on.

882
01:13:28,549 --> 01:13:31,714
- Seems they've been already.
- What are you looking for?

883
01:13:31,906 --> 01:13:33,057
This.

884
01:13:33,249 --> 01:13:36,701
A crate from overseas that
hasn't passed through customs yet.

885
01:13:45,716 --> 01:13:47,826
What is that?

886
01:13:57,992 --> 01:13:59,047
Coffee?

887
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,253
Yeah, it's coffee on top.

888
01:14:06,815 --> 01:14:09,692
But this ain't sugar.
Go get Rosewood.

889
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,090
Welcome to the party.

890
01:14:35,682 --> 01:14:37,792
lt seems we have guests.

891
01:14:57,548 --> 01:15:01,000
How nice. I do like surprises.

892
01:15:13,085 --> 01:15:14,907
Jeannette.

893
01:15:18,168 --> 01:15:22,291
l just can't tell you how
disappointed I am to find you here.

894
01:15:23,634 --> 01:15:25,552
Shut up!

895
01:15:26,415 --> 01:15:28,622
l don't want to hear it.

896
01:15:45,788 --> 01:15:48,377
Take her to the car and wait for me.

897
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:51,734
What are you going to do with him?

898
01:15:51,926 --> 01:15:55,858
You should be more worried about
what we're going to do with you.

899
01:15:56,145 --> 01:15:59,790
Don't worry. We've got cocaine and
coffee, we're going to have a party.

900
01:16:00,078 --> 01:16:03,434
Thanks for having me over, Vic.
This is very nice.

901
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:05,256
Did you say something?

902
01:16:19,546 --> 01:16:22,136
lf something happens to her...

903
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:25,780
I'm all ears.

904
01:16:27,219 --> 01:16:29,041
I'll kill you.

905
01:16:30,288 --> 01:16:33,453
Really? That would be a neat trick.

906
01:16:45,249 --> 01:16:48,893
- Well, cuz.
- Are you still pissed at me?

907
01:16:51,962 --> 01:16:57,141
No. But I should have
taken care of you in Detroit.

908
01:17:03,087 --> 01:17:05,292
When I popped your little buddy.

909
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:13,924
Goodbye, Mr Foley.

910
01:17:15,938 --> 01:17:18,719
- Have a nice day.
- I'll try.

911
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,380
Damn it.

912
01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:49,696
Oh, boy.

913
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:04,562
How's that little bump
on the head I gave you in Detroit?

914
01:18:04,849 --> 01:18:06,959
Healed up nice, I hope.

915
01:18:31,702 --> 01:18:32,853
Freeze!

916
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:46,759
Thanks.

917
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:05,844
Tell Taggart to check out
the warehouse. I'll explain later.

918
01:19:06,131 --> 01:19:08,817
Sergeant Taggart is here,
he wants to talk to you.

919
01:19:09,009 --> 01:19:09,968
Shit!

920
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,845
Billy, what the hell is going on?

921
01:19:13,037 --> 01:19:16,777
- Sorry, Sarge, I can't talk now.
- What do you mean?

922
01:19:17,064 --> 01:19:21,285
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

923
01:19:21,572 --> 01:19:23,970
- He's not transmitting any more.
- Shit.

924
01:19:24,162 --> 01:19:28,189
- What's the matter?
- Billy's doing something dumb again.

925
01:19:28,478 --> 01:19:31,834
- Was he calling from the hotel?
- No, sir.

926
01:19:32,025 --> 01:19:35,095
Right now, his car's heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

927
01:19:35,382 --> 01:19:38,739
- We were there this morning.
- What?

928
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:41,136
Foley was looking over
Maitland's house.

929
01:19:41,329 --> 01:19:44,781
- Do you have that warehouse address?
- Yes, sir.

930
01:19:46,124 --> 01:19:50,535
Check that place out, let me know
what's going on over there.

931
01:19:50,823 --> 01:19:52,741
Don't talk to anybody but me.

932
01:20:12,593 --> 01:20:15,950
Hold it, Foley. You're under arrest.
Billy, why are you here?

933
01:20:16,237 --> 01:20:18,922
- I forced him at gunpoint.
- No, he didn't.

934
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:23,238
Everything he said about Maitland
is right. He's kidnapped a woman.

935
01:20:25,156 --> 01:20:27,842
- Let's get her.
- What do you think I'm doing?

936
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:31,965
- We'll have a warrant in 20 minutes.
- She could be dead in 20 minutes.

937
01:20:32,253 --> 01:20:34,171
Stop. You're coming with us.

938
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:37,528
I'm going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.

939
01:20:40,213 --> 01:20:43,857
Me, too. You can do what you want,
but I'm going in.

940
01:20:44,145 --> 01:20:46,351
This is really serious trouble.

941
01:20:46,543 --> 01:20:49,132
lf you're lucky,
you'll just get fired.

942
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:52,105
- Got it.
- This is my last warning.

943
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:01,984
I'm sorry, Sarge. I've got to.

944
01:21:06,299 --> 01:21:08,697
Shit. Wait a minute.

945
01:21:21,932 --> 01:21:25,480
- What's that?
- Looks like East Gate.

946
01:21:25,768 --> 01:21:27,590
Punch it up.

947
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:34,687
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.

948
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:53,676
Where is everybody? ls Rosewood back?

949
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:56,169
- No, sir.
- Seen Taggart?

950
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:58,375
He took off about 10 minutes ago.

951
01:22:07,103 --> 01:22:09,020
Foley's on the grounds.

952
01:22:09,212 --> 01:22:13,336
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.

953
01:22:15,925 --> 01:22:18,515
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

954
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,259
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.

955
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,823
Come on.

956
01:23:25,264 --> 01:23:29,676
- They must be away from the car.
- I can see that. Keep trying.

957
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,745
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

958
01:23:36,773 --> 01:23:38,403
609 Palm Canyon Road.

959
01:23:38,499 --> 01:23:40,800
Who lives at that address?

960
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:45,788
A Victor Maitland, sir.

961
01:23:48,952 --> 01:23:53,076
- Let's go around.
- Come on, we can do it. Come on.

962
01:23:58,447 --> 01:24:00,749
Ready, one, two...

963
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,858
three!

964
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:33,068
You all right?

965
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:38,247
What the fuck am I doing here?

966
01:24:44,481 --> 01:24:46,207
Drop it!

967
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:56,853
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

968
01:25:07,114 --> 01:25:09,704
- Jesus Christ!
- These guys are serious.

969
01:25:09,895 --> 01:25:12,197
l hate machine guns.

970
01:25:20,637 --> 01:25:22,650
Cover me.

971
01:25:35,022 --> 01:25:37,899
Go around front.
I'm going to check the back.

972
01:25:39,626 --> 01:25:44,612
We have a report of shots fired at
that location. 609 Palm Canyon Road.

973
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,490
Put out a 998,
officers need assistance.

974
01:25:47,778 --> 01:25:49,600
- Undercovers on scene.
- Sir?

975
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:54,203
l want all north end units to roll.
South end units stay in their area.

976
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:57,848
- Damn! Let's go.
- Undercover officers at location.

977
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:08,876
Police! You're all under arrest!

978
01:26:15,014 --> 01:26:17,412
Do that again, I'll shoot you myself.

979
01:27:26,846 --> 01:27:29,531
Know what I keep thinking about?

980
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:32,601
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?

981
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:37,875
Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

982
01:27:40,273 --> 01:27:44,109
And the whole Bolivian army
is out in front of this little hut.

983
01:27:48,425 --> 01:27:50,918
I'm going to make you pay for this.

984
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,601
- Hanging around?
- Fuck, no.

985
01:29:35,262 --> 01:29:37,468
Freeze it! Hold it right there.

986
01:29:40,632 --> 01:29:41,687
Shit!

987
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:01,923
Be careful, old boy,
it might hit me.

988
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:12,089
Freeze!

989
01:30:29,064 --> 01:30:31,749
Police! You're all under arrest!

990
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:37,216
Lay down your weapons and take
two steps back with your hands up!

991
01:30:42,298 --> 01:30:44,216
Very good.

992
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:45,368
Great.

993
01:31:03,973 --> 01:31:05,891
What the hell's going on here?

994
01:31:05,987 --> 01:31:07,042
Shit.

995
01:31:07,233 --> 01:31:10,782
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

996
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:13,755
How come he isn't wearing cuffs?

997
01:31:13,947 --> 01:31:16,920
Well, he isn't actually
in custody, sir.

998
01:31:17,112 --> 01:31:19,605
Place him in custody.
Or would you like me to?

999
01:31:19,797 --> 01:31:22,770
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

1000
01:31:24,305 --> 01:31:27,757
You have a report
that explains all this?

1001
01:31:28,045 --> 01:31:30,155
Yes, sir.

1002
01:31:30,347 --> 01:31:33,032
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

1003
01:31:36,101 --> 01:31:39,649
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager
of Mr Maitland's art gallery,

1004
01:31:39,937 --> 01:31:43,390
accidentally discovered
what she suspected was cocaine

1005
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:45,211
in the gallery's warehouse.

1006
01:31:45,404 --> 01:31:49,527
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley.

1007
01:31:51,733 --> 01:31:53,747
Detective Foley was, at the time,

1008
01:31:53,939 --> 01:31:58,447
cooperating in a joint
Beverly Hills-Detroit investigation.

1009
01:31:58,734 --> 01:32:02,762
Detectives Foley and Rosewood
proceeded to the warehouse

1010
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:06,599
where Rosewood discovered
approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.

1011
01:32:07,845 --> 01:32:11,873
Rosewood called for back-up
and I despatched our officers.

1012
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:15,230
Sergeant Taggart
was the first on the scene.

1013
01:32:16,093 --> 01:32:20,312
Believing a felony was in progress,
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,

1014
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,573
with Detective Foley present
only as an observer,

1015
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:25,971
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

1016
01:32:26,163 --> 01:32:29,328
ln defending ourselves,
we shot several suspects,

1017
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,821
including Mr Maitland.

1018
01:32:35,465 --> 01:32:37,959
You expect me to believe that report?

1019
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:41,891
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

1020
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:48,700
Sergeant Taggart,
why don't you tell me what happened?

1021
01:33:01,647 --> 01:33:04,621
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, Chief.

1022
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,444
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

1023
01:33:22,746 --> 01:33:24,472
Thank you, sir.

1024
01:33:24,664 --> 01:33:27,158
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

1025
01:33:27,349 --> 01:33:29,459
Yes, sir. First thing.

1026
01:33:37,515 --> 01:33:39,721
You were lying your ass off.

1027
01:33:43,078 --> 01:33:46,146
Go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at.

1028
01:33:47,298 --> 01:33:49,216
Excuse me, sir.

1029
01:33:53,723 --> 01:33:56,216
Could you do me a favour, sir?

1030
01:33:57,751 --> 01:34:01,299
- Your favours are all used up.
- I understand.

1031
01:34:01,491 --> 01:34:04,272
l just hoped you could
call lnspector Todd

1032
01:34:04,561 --> 01:34:07,437
and straighten things out for me,
but that's all right.

1033
01:34:07,629 --> 01:34:09,739
I'm out of a job. It's cool.

1034
01:34:09,931 --> 01:34:11,849
l think I'll stay in Beverly Hills.

1035
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:14,918
I'm going to start
a private investigation company.

1036
01:34:15,877 --> 01:34:18,371
I'll talk to Todd first thing.

1037
01:34:18,658 --> 01:34:20,289
- Really?
- You bet.

1038
01:34:20,385 --> 01:34:21,344
Thank you so much.

1039
01:34:29,496 --> 01:34:31,989
Hi, I'm Axel Foley
checking out of suite 1035.

1040
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:34,482
One moment, sir. I'll get your bill.

1041
01:34:38,894 --> 01:34:42,538
Guys, you didn't have to come
to see me off, but I'm very moved.

1042
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:46,566
Bogomil ordered us to make sure
you got out of town.

1043
01:34:47,909 --> 01:34:51,169
That doesn't matter. What matters
is that you came down here.

1044
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:54,334
I'm all choked up.
I've got a lump in my throat.

1045
01:34:54,526 --> 01:34:57,116
Look a little misty yourself,
Taggart.

1046
01:34:57,308 --> 01:34:59,226
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.

1047
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:03,062
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

1048
01:35:03,349 --> 01:35:07,186
Get outta here.
Guys, that's the last straw.

1049
01:35:07,377 --> 01:35:09,200
You guys are too nice.

1050
01:35:09,391 --> 01:35:11,501
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?

1051
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:15,241
- Yes, sir. $95 apiece.
- Put them on my tab.

1052
01:35:15,529 --> 01:35:18,598
l have to have two of them, though.

1053
01:35:19,366 --> 01:35:22,146
Billy, you saved my life.

1054
01:35:23,105 --> 01:35:26,462
I'll never be able to repay you,
but as a token of my appreciation,

1055
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:29,051
l want you to have
this fine Beverly Palm robe.

1056
01:35:29,244 --> 01:35:33,367
Each time you get in the shower,
think about our friendship.

1057
01:35:33,655 --> 01:35:36,340
Think about Axel Foley.
l love you, Billy.

1058
01:35:40,848 --> 01:35:42,958
Thanks, Axel.

1059
01:35:43,149 --> 01:35:47,465
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

1060
01:35:47,753 --> 01:35:49,767
Billy, take care of the tab.

1061
01:35:50,534 --> 01:35:52,356
- Taggart...
- Here you are, sir.

1062
01:35:52,548 --> 01:35:54,562
This is for you.

1063
01:35:54,754 --> 01:35:57,535
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

1064
01:35:59,261 --> 01:36:02,043
l already have three of them
in my bag.

1065
01:36:05,495 --> 01:36:07,029
Thank you, sir.

1066
01:36:07,222 --> 01:36:09,523
Not going to say goodbye?

1067
01:36:09,715 --> 01:36:12,687
Aren't you tailing me
to the city limits?

1068
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,469
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

1069
01:36:15,757 --> 01:36:17,962
l was thinking
about stopping for a drink.

1070
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:21,511
- We figured you would.
- Then will you join me?

1071
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:26,210
l don't think so, Axel.
We're still on duty.

1072
01:36:26,402 --> 01:36:29,375
l don't think
one beer's going to kill us, Billy.

1073
01:36:29,663 --> 01:36:32,348
Right. Listen to Taggart. Lighten up.

1074
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,937
One drink's not going to kill us.

1075
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:40,116
But guys, if you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

1076
01:36:40,404 --> 01:36:44,432
- Where we going, anyway?
- Don't worry, just follow my lead.

1077
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:48,460
l know the perfect place.
You guys'll love it. Trust me.
