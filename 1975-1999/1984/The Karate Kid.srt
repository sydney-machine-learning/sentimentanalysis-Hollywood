1
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:54,001
Don't forget to tell Uncle Louie I left
the red wine and Parmesan in the fridge.

2
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:55,711
I love you. Bye-bye.

3
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,754
- 'Bye, Judy.
- Send me a picture.

4
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,965
I'll be back soon. Don't worry about it.

5
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,801
- Be careful, now.
- 'Bye.

6
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:07,014
- Take it easy, now.
- 'Bye.

7
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:36,585
"California, here we come"

8
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,463
What's wrong? Don't you like my singing?

9
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,881
I don't like the song.

10
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:43,967
You're going to love California.
You get up in the morning...

11
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,969
...roll out of bed, plop, in the pool.

12
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:47,220
Yeah, sure.

13
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:51,350
You'll see. This isn't exactly a dump
we're moving to.

14
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:04,965
Push, Daniel.
Give it all you've got, kid. Push!

15
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:09,302
Okay, we've got it. Come on.
Get in, hurry up.

16
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,058
We did it again. Way to go!

17
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,880
Daniel, wake up.

18
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:49,426
Look off the starboard bow.
Paradise at last.

19
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,179
We made it.

20
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:54,598
Come on.

21
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:55,974
This is it.

22
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,311
This is the end of the line.

23
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,605
You're telling me.

24
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,983
Come on. All hands on deck.

25
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:10,447
We've got to get this thing unloaded
before it sinks.

26
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:16,078
Look at those palm trees!
Damn, do you know what that means?

27
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:18,705
Yeah, watch out for falling coconuts.

28
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:22,876
- Wise guy. No more Newark winters.
- I like winters.

29
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,921
Oh, you like sore throats?
You like frozen toes?

30
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:27,631
I don't like smog.

31
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,176
- Did I tell you about the pool here?
- About 100 times.

32
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,595
Okay, so make it 101.

33
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:38,308
Open your eyes, my darling son.
This is the Garden of Eden.

34
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:42,062
Come on.
Listen, we're in apartment 20, okay?

35
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:44,064
One flight up.

36
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,335
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry about it.

37
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,087
- Let me help you up.
- Thanks.

38
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,256
I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid.

39
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,758
You must be the new people in 20, right?

40
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:12,926
Yeah, I guess so.

41
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,512
- Freddy Fernandez, apartment 17.
- Daniel LaRusso.

42
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,014
How you doing? Let me help.

43
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:20,684
- No, it's fine. It's heavy, man.
- I got it.

44
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:23,103
- Where are you from?
- New Jersey.

45
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,771
What are you doing out here?

46
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:28,191
My mom got a job with some company
out here. Rocket Computers.

47
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,027
Flight of the Future. I don't know.

48
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,988
- I never heard of it.
- It's up and coming.

49
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:38,327
- Is this the only pool you've got?
- That's it. What was that, karate?

50
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:41,788
- Yeah.
- Have you been doing it long?

51
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:44,291
- Yeah, a while.
- Did you ever use it?

52
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:47,252
- A couple of times.
- I bet you could kick some ass.

53
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:50,339
I'd like to learn that.
Maybe you could teach me.

54
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:52,507
- Sure. That's cool. Anytime.
- Great.

55
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,719
This place is a dump.
You should go back to New Jersey.

56
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:58,513
How did you know where I was from?

57
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:01,516
'Cause I'm from New Jersey.
I got a nose for my own.

58
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,269
- Well what part?
- Parsippany.

59
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:07,439
- I never should've left.
- My Uncle Louie's from Parsippany.

60
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,191
- Louie Martini?
- Louie LaRusso.

61
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:11,902
Louie LaRusso? Don't know him.

62
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:14,529
Hey, pup.

63
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:16,740
How you doing? You thirsty?

64
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:19,201
- She's crazy.
- What?

65
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:22,037
- She's not playing with a full deck.
- She's nice.

66
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,165
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- I don't know. I guess nothing.

67
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,293
We're having a beach party.
Want to come?

68
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:31,505
- Sure, that's cool.
- I'll come get you in the morning.

69
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,882
Here's apartment 20.

70
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,884
- Is it?
- Should I leave this here?

71
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,804
- Yeah, thanks for the help.
- No problem.

72
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:42,808
Nice meeting you. Take care.
See you tomorrow morning.

73
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:48,772
Don't say anything about the pool.
I'll call first thing in the morning.

74
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:51,650
Did you tell that old lady
where we were from?

75
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,902
Yes. Didn't she remind you of Aunt Tessy?

76
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,657
- More like Uncle Louie.
- I really think we're going to do good here.

77
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,535
I have a very positive feeling.
I'm telling you, Daniel.

78
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,579
I just know it's going to work.
The faucet's broken.

79
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:08,750
The real estate lady said there's
a fix-it guy. See if you can find him.

80
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,586
What's that for?

81
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,964
- Uncle Louie's dog.
- He's cute.

82
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:17,009
- I got invited to a party tomorrow.
- Great. You see?

83
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:21,138
- But you wanted me to help you unpack.
- I don't remember saying that.

84
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,308
I must have had you mixed up
with somebody else.

85
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,685
Thanks, Ma.

86
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:33,025
Could you tell me
where the maintenance guy is?

87
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,776
Hey, pup.

88
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,613
You go in through there,
turn left, not too far...

89
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:41,783
...then right, go inside, and you'll find him
on the left.

90
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,410
So I go right then left?

91
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:46,955
No, left then right, then inside on the left.

92
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:07,642
Hello?

93
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,443
Are you the maintenance man?

94
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,572
We're the new people in apartment 20.

95
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,327
The faucet's really leaking there.

96
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,126
Could you come fix it?

97
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:38,799
Can I tell my mom when?

98
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:40,759
When what?

99
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:44,513
When you're going to fix the faucet.

100
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:45,722
After.

101
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,016
After what?

102
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:49,810
After after!

103
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,822
Could we have the ball, please?

104
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:45,490
Pretty good.

105
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,075
Show-off.

106
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:53,999
Sorry. Hey, wait up.

107
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,504
- Who's that blonde in the blue?
- The hills.

108
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:02,591
- What's the hills?
- Rich.

109
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:25,197
- I think the blonde is looking at you.
- Yeah, right.

110
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,451
- I think she has the hots for you.
- Who could blame her?

111
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,245
- Why don't you make a move?
- No, I'm eating, man.

112
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,082
- How can you think about eating?
- I'm hungry.

113
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:39,628
- Maybe they ain't got no moves in Jersey.
- I got moves where I come from.

114
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:43,382
We've got more moves back there
than here, I'll tell you that much.

115
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:46,176
Let's see 'em.

116
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:50,055
Come on, buddy. Go get her.

117
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,474
I'm going.

118
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,813
- Lose something?
- I hope we're not bothering you.

119
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,940
Hey, how do you juggle?

120
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:05,028
It's pretty easy. You start on the knee.
You just go one.

121
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:08,281
One at a time. Then you try two.
One, two.

122
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:12,869
And then three and four.
Try it. Just bring your leg up. Good!

123
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:24,506
- That was awesome!
- Brew time. Who's for a warm one?

124
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,841
No, I pass.

125
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,344
Who are you kidding?
You're the ace degenerate.

126
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:34,516
Ex-degenerate. Tomorrow I'm a senior.
I've got one year to make it all work.

127
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:38,437
And that's what I'm gonna do.
Make it work, all of it.

128
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,482
You must be a trendsetter, Johnny.
Everyone's doing something new.

129
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,109
Take a right. Check it out.

130
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:49,698
- Forget it, man. It's ancient history.
- Who told you, man?

131
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,076
- I thought they broke up.
- She did, he didn't.

132
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:56,663
Come on, try it.

133
00:11:56,788 --> 00:11:58,332
Watch this.

134
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,585
I'll get it. I'll be right back.

135
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:21,938
- Ali, I want to talk to you.
- Leave me alone.

136
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,566
We've been over all this.
I don't want to talk.

137
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,277
I want to talk to you, all right?

138
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,074
- What is your problem?
- Just get out of here.

139
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:35,952
- That won't solve anything.
- Give me my radio.

140
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:37,663
I said, give me my radio.

141
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:40,666
- You promise you'll talk to me?
- Yes, give me my radio.

142
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:48,465
- You just broke my radio!
- Yeah.

143
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:50,592
Don't touch it, punk.

144
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:56,682
- What's going on?
- You want it?

145
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:07,317
Johnny, stop it.

146
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:14,157
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.

147
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,832
You're a big man now, huh?

148
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:25,502
You started this. I just wanted to talk.

149
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:29,798
- Leave him alone and we'll talk.
- Where did I hear that before?

150
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,719
How about you, hero? Had enough?

151
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:39,182
- Now we're even.
- No mercy, man.

152
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:53,780
Why don't you hit me?

153
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:55,282
- It's your fault!
- It's not.

154
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:57,367
- It's your fault.
- Ever think it's yours?

155
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,202
Why do you always have to fight?

156
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:01,913
Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys.

157
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:12,674
You sure pick cool people
to be friends with.

158
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:14,801
Where'd you find this guy?

159
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:17,763
Come on, let's go. He'll be all right.

160
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:29,316
- Are you okay?
- Just leave me alone.

161
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:34,237
- I'll help you.
- Leave me alone. I'm okay.

162
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:38,075
Come on, Ali. Let's go.
It's better if you leave him alone.

163
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,416
Come on, let's go.

164
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,810
Daniel!

165
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,858
- How was the party?
- It was okay.

166
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:15,153
Must have been more than okay.
I didn't hear you come in.

167
00:15:15,237 --> 00:15:18,115
- Any friend material?
- Some. I got to go.

168
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:20,158
- Eat first.
- I'm not hungry.

169
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:23,453
- You need energy to be charming.
- I'm fine, I got energy.

170
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,831
Do me a favour. Take off the glasses.

171
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,375
- Why?
- Because I asked you to.

172
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:32,754
- It's California. It's the look.
- I want to see your baby browns.

173
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,341
- Come on with the baby browns.
- Are you on something?

174
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,969
- I'm on Minute Maid.
- Why hide your eyes?

175
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:41,722
- I'm not.
- Take off the glasses.

176
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,140
Now!

177
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,647
My God! How did that happen?

178
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:55,777
I hit a kerb with my bike.
I wore the glasses so you wouldn't worry.

179
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:58,238
- It looks worse than it feels.
- Don't do that.

180
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:01,491
- It doesn't hurt.
- Can you see? You want to stay home?

181
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:02,576
I've got to go.

182
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:06,765
- Hey, you guys, Freddy, how you doing?
- Hey, the karate kid.

183
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,642
Let's see the moves.

184
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,187
- He knows how to get his butt kicked.
- I already know that move.

185
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:14,314
Let's get out of here.

186
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:15,524
Hey, think fast.

187
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,443
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?

188
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:22,030
- Your eye.
- It looks worse than it feels. Believe me.

189
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:23,407
I hope so.

190
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:26,535
I never got a chance to thank you.

191
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:30,163
That was nothing.
I'm just sorry about your radio.

192
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:32,666
I'm more sorry about your eye.

193
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:34,501
You should've just given it to him.

194
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:36,294
Why? It wasn't his, right?

195
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:40,882
- Yeah, it wasn't his.
- We think alike already.

196
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,218
You know what else we do alike?

197
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:48,348
You've been practicing.

198
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:51,226
- Cheerleaders, over here.
- I've got to go.

199
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,937
- I'll see you.
- 'Bye.

200
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:57,691
- Hey, have you got a name?
- Ali with an "i."

201
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,988
- What's your name?
- Daniel with an "I."

202
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:05,907
I'll see you later.

203
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:08,910
Definitely.

204
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:45,447
Get him, Bobby.

205
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,664
Have a nice trip?

206
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,042
Look what he's doing to Bobby.

207
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:00,962
Nobody hits me. I'm going to kill him.

208
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:04,966
- None of that on this team!
- He hooked me!

209
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,885
I said out of here!

210
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:09,596
Back to it. Let's go.

211
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,891
This school sucks! It sucks.

212
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:39,918
52, 53, 54...

213
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,756
55, 56, 57...

214
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:48,135
- Fix faucet.
- Come on in.

215
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:49,886
It's the kitchen one.

216
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,307
1, 2, 3...

217
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:55,684
Karate.

218
00:19:56,393 --> 00:20:00,272
- Yeah, 5, 6...
- Very good.

219
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:06,194
- Learn from book?
- And a few months at the Y in Newark.

220
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:08,989
9, 10...

221
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:13,952
...11, 12, 13...

222
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,333
What happened to eye?

223
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,501
I fell off my bike.

224
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:27,966
Lucky no hurt hand.

225
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:49,696
- Ali with an "i." How are you doing?
- Good.

226
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:52,741
- Not too hungry today?
- Not really.

227
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,077
Have some pie, I made it myself.

228
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,040
- How do you like the valley?
- It hasn't been dull.

229
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:01,541
Was Newark dull?

230
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,544
How did you know I was from there?

231
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:07,005
- I asked.
- Oh, really?

232
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:10,634
- Are you sitting with anybody?
- With you, if it's okay.

233
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:13,303
- Sounds great to me. Want some milk?
- Thanks.

234
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:17,724
- Sorry about the soccer tryouts.
- Those are the breaks.

235
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:20,894
Remember that guy you had trouble with
on the beach?

236
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:24,564
- Yeah, King Karate?
- He's my ex-boyfriend.

237
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:26,900
That's good to know. What?

238
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:29,444
Yeah, you're right. I know.

239
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,489
- What are you doing?
- It's this little voice...

240
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:35,492
...telling me I've got to be nuts
to be talking to you.

241
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:38,620
- That'll be $2.50.
- For both.

242
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:43,458
- $3.75.
- It doesn't matter, anyway.

243
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,169
- Why's that?
- Because it's over.

244
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:49,715
- Wait. How over?
- Weeks.

245
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,883
One week, five weeks?
How many weeks is "weeks"?

246
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:06,315
<i>- Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

247
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:10,360
<i>- Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

248
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:15,324
<i>- Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

249
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:19,995
<i>- Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

250
00:22:20,078 --> 00:22:24,583
<i>- Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

251
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,213
<i>- Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

252
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,506
Prepare.

253
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:38,764
- What do we study here?
- The way of the fist, sir!

254
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:43,769
- And what is that way?
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

255
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:49,149
- I can't hear you.
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

256
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,403
<i>- Mr. Lawrence.
- Yes, Sensei.</i>

257
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:56,198
Warm them up.

258
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,424
Fighting positions. Jab punch.

259
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:15,967
Ready.

260
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:29,314
Guess what.
I'm going to be trained as a manager.

261
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,358
Isn't that great?

262
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:34,111
The programme's two nights a week.

263
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:39,741
As soon as a spot opens up, I'm in.
The benefits are great.

264
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:42,244
They pay for everything.

265
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:45,080
That's great.

266
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,626
- What's the matter, Daniel?
- Nothing.

267
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:55,882
Remember when you went to the country
and hated it 'cause you had no friends?

268
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,384
What happened?

269
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:00,470
I got poison ivy.

270
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:04,474
You met Kevin and Kenny,
who became your best friends in the world.

271
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:08,562
You've got to give it a try.

272
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,189
I know it's hard.

273
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:13,608
We're not quitters, are we?

274
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,402
I guess not.

275
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,656
- What's with the karate place?
- It sucks.

276
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,576
Good. We couldn't afford it anyway.

277
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:25,037
And the girl situation?

278
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:28,332
- It's okay.
- Just okay?

279
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:31,793
To me it looks like
the whole world turned blonde.

280
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:34,087
You got your eye on anybody?

281
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:38,383
Cute?

282
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,885
Not cute.

283
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:44,806
- She's beyond cute.
- But she's blonde, right?

284
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:48,602
- She's got blonde hair.
- Lucille, let's go, here they come.

285
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:52,397
- Is she as pretty as Judy?
- She buries Judy in a second.

286
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:54,775
She buries Judy?

287
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:59,363
Tell me about it later. I love you.
Careful how you ride home.

288
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:05,619
She's got an excellent smile.
She's really smart.

289
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:12,042
I'd say she's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.

290
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:14,753
I think she's something else.

291
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:18,465
She's hot. Definitely hot.

292
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:52,249
- Looking for a shortcut to Newark?
- He wants to learn karate.

293
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:56,920
Here's the first lesson: How to take a fall.
Don't think about the pain.

294
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,704
Damn bike! I hate this bike!

295
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:34,041
I hate this frigging bike! Stupid bike!

296
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,253
What's the matter?
Why did you throw your bike away?

297
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,631
- Because I felt like it.
- Look at me when I'm talking to you.

298
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:42,966
My God!

299
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:48,180
Tell me what's going on.
Don't say another bike accident.

300
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,432
- What do you want to hear?
- The truth.

301
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:53,226
No, all you want to hear
is how great it is here.

302
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:56,021
Maybe for you, but it sucks for me.
I hate this place!

303
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:59,775
I hate it, I want to go home!
Why can't we just go back home?

304
00:27:00,776 --> 00:27:02,319
Listen to me.

305
00:27:02,402 --> 00:27:05,197
I cannot help you
unless you tell me what's wrong.

306
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,782
I've got to take karate.

307
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:10,619
- You took karate.
- Not at the Y, at a good school.

308
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:14,289
- Fighting doesn't solve anything.
- Neither does palm trees.

309
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:15,916
That's not fair.

310
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:20,545
It wasn't fair coming out here
without asking me.

311
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:24,424
You're right.

312
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,094
I should've asked.

313
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:30,972
I just want to go home.
I don't understand the rules here.

314
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:34,184
Let's see if we can figure out
the rules together.

315
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,479
- What about your bike?
- It's safer taking the bus.

316
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:41,233
Why can't we just go home
and forget this place?

317
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,174
- I'll tell you everything he said.
- You'd better.

318
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:20,355
How are you?

319
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:24,443
- What happened to your forehead?
- It's terrible. A gigantic runaway zit.

320
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:26,320
That's gross.

321
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,782
Daniel, this is Susan.
What really happened?

322
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:32,826
I got in a bike accident.

323
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:36,830
What kind of bike do you have?
A Honda? Suzuki?

324
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,167
It's a Miyagi Turbo.

325
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,586
- Yeah?
- Oh, really?

326
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:45,756
- We're going to the arcade. Want to come?
- Sounds great.

327
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,550
There's this new game I want to show you.

328
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:57,017
I forgot something.
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.

329
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,853
- Don't run away.
- I'm not running away from anything.

330
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:04,274
- We've got to deal with this.
- I'll deal with it my own way.

331
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:07,277
- Daniel...
- Get off my case!

332
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,943
Did you fix my bike?

333
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,612
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

334
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:52,781
I really appreciate that.

335
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,535
Are those real trees?

336
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:59,997
You like see, come inside.

337
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:01,915
Thanks.

338
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,883
How did they get so small?

339
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:13,593
I train.

340
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,221
Clip here, tie there.

341
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:19,224
Did you learn this in Japan?

342
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:20,600
Okinawa.

343
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:21,893
Where's that?

344
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:23,854
My country.

345
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,773
China here.

346
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:28,650
Japan here.

347
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:30,777
Okinawa here.

348
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,448
Did you go to school for this?

349
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:35,824
Father teach.

350
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:37,993
Was he a gardener?

351
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:39,828
Fisherman.

352
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,204
A fisherman.

353
00:30:42,414 --> 00:30:44,207
These are really beautiful.

354
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,543
Come, you try.

355
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:48,587
I don't know how to do this stuff.

356
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,465
- Sit down.
- I may mess it up or something.

357
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:54,051
Close eyes.

358
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:57,012
Trust.

359
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:02,309
Concentrate.

360
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:06,730
Think only tree.

361
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:12,402
Make a perfect picture
down to last pine needle.

362
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,116
Wipe your mind clean.
Everything but the tree.

363
00:31:19,785 --> 00:31:22,788
Nothing exists in whole world...

364
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:25,248
...only tree.

365
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:28,710
You got it?

366
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,630
Open eyes.

367
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:34,508
Remember picture?

368
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:36,802
Yeah.

369
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,262
Make like picture.

370
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:51,191
Just trust the picture.

371
00:31:52,192 --> 00:31:54,569
How do I know my picture's the right one?

372
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:58,532
If come from inside you,
always the right one.

373
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:34,192
Hi.

374
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,486
Hi, Ma, come on in.

375
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,283
- You fixed your bike.
- Mr. Miyagi fixed it.

376
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,119
Great, thank you.

377
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:47,456
- How much do we owe you?
- No, please.

378
00:32:47,664 --> 00:32:48,874
My pleasure.

379
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,709
That's very nice.

380
00:32:53,128 --> 00:32:54,421
Hi, champ.

381
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:55,964
Hey.

382
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,136
- What are you doing?
- I'm trimming my baby tree.

383
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:03,055
<i>Bonsai tree.</i>

384
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,848
<i>Bonsai tree.</i>

385
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:06,224
<i>Bonsai.</i>

386
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,893
<i>Bonsai.</i>

387
00:33:08,894 --> 00:33:10,020
They're beautiful.

388
00:33:10,103 --> 00:33:12,939
Mr. Miyagi learned it in Okinawa.
That's where he's from.

389
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:14,191
Really?

390
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:15,859
They're so delicate.

391
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,199
For me?

392
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,409
No, I couldn't.

393
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:26,745
Please, hurt feelings.

394
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:29,998
That's very nice, thank you.

395
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:32,959
- Welcome.
- I know just where it will go.

396
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,545
Come on, it's getting late.

397
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:38,924
- I'll be up in a half hour.
- No, now. School tomorrow.

398
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,803
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

399
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:46,556
Don't forget tree.

400
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:49,226
Must practice.

401
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:51,311
Thank you.

402
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:53,522
<i>- Sayonara.
- Sayonara.</i>

403
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,900
- Goodnight.
- Thanks again. See you.

404
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:03,532
Ma, he gave you the nicest one.
This guy is something else.

405
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:06,785
You saw what he did to my bike.
This guy is great.

406
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:41,611
- Happy Halloween. You like?
- Yeah, that's nice.

407
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:44,573
Passed school today. Lots happening.

408
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:48,702
What's the matter? You're not going?

409
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:49,870
No.

410
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:51,496
How come?

411
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:54,249
I'm not into dancing that much.

412
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:57,461
I don't feel like it, anyway.

413
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:02,215
You're too much by self. Not good.

414
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:04,509
I'm not by myself.

415
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:06,595
I'm with you.

416
00:35:07,512 --> 00:35:12,225
To make honey, young bee
need young flower, not old prune.

417
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:15,228
I don't have a costume, anyway.

418
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:17,481
If have costume...

419
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,191
...you go?

420
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:21,985
If I went as the Invisible Man.

421
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:24,404
Invisible Man?

422
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:28,075
You know, so no one would see me.

423
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,259
There's Daniel.

424
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:48,095
- Where?
- In the shower.

425
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,681
- How do you know?
- I just know.

426
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:51,974
May I?

427
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:56,937
- I don't know what she sees in him.
- She must be into fungus.

428
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,361
Help me, my flower needs water.

429
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:08,448
You've come to the right place, stranger.

430
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:13,412
- I've never danced in a shower.
- A friend of mine made this for me.

431
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:14,955
Isn't it great?

432
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:16,832
Where have you been hiding?

433
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:18,875
I haven't been hiding.

434
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:22,045
- I haven't seen you around.
- You been looking?

435
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,047
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

436
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:26,842
I thought you were still angry with me.

437
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:30,554
- Why?
- Because of what I said last time I saw you.

438
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,597
I've been thinking a lot about that.

439
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,350
I should learn to mind my own business.

440
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,688
No, I think you're right about facing things.
I feel the same way.

441
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:42,357
I just kind of forgot for a while.

442
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:45,485
- Thanks for reminding me.
- You're welcome.

443
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:50,324
He thinks he can do
whatever he wants to people.

444
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,743
- Who?
- Johnny.

445
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:55,454
I'd love to see him get some
of his own medicine.

446
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:57,622
What goes around comes around.

447
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:00,792
- I'd love to be there when it does.
- Me, too.

448
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:09,092
You want to go outside?

449
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:12,554
You talked me into it.

450
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:22,314
- That chicken is wild!
- That guy's using real eggs!

451
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:23,940
He's great!

452
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:25,484
No!

453
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:33,700
Johnny!

454
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:39,331
Johnny!

455
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,587
- Got that number rolled?
- In a minute.

456
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:48,090
I'm going to get the guys. Hurry up.

457
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,065
Shit!

458
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:49,526
Move, man!

459
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:56,700
Johnny, what's up?

460
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:01,496
Get out of my way!

461
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:04,374
- What's wrong?
- It's coming around.

462
00:39:10,964 --> 00:39:11,965
Get up!

463
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:15,844
Get out of my way!

464
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,063
What the hell are you doing?

465
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:28,315
Get out of the way!

466
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:05,477
You ain't going nowhere.

467
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,526
You little wimp!

468
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,407
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, little twerp?

469
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:21,576
No, you had to push it.
Well, now you're gonna pay!

470
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:26,498
Where are you going, sweetheart?

471
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:28,917
How about a front kick, Johnny?

472
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:34,548
Get him up.

473
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:36,758
- He's had enough.
- Shut up!

474
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:40,721
- He can't even stand up.
- That don't mean squat.

475
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:45,183
- Johnny, he's had enough.
- I'll decide when he's had enough.

476
00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:47,144
What's wrong with you, Johnny?

477
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:50,397
- An enemy deserves no mercy.
- Right!

478
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:52,607
You're crazy, man!

479
00:40:57,696 --> 00:40:59,323
Get him!

480
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,145
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

481
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:32,731
Come.

482
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:16,483
Leave on.

483
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,362
- It stinks. What is it?
- Smell bad, heal good.

484
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,369
- Where did Spider-Man go?
- Who?

485
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:30,288
The guy who bailed me out.
Where'd he go?

486
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,419
What, you?

487
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:40,257
- No way.
- Why "no way"?

488
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,552
- Because...
- Because, old man?

489
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:45,971
Have tea.

490
00:42:46,555 --> 00:42:47,723
Feel better.

491
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:15,500
Why didn't you tell me?

492
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,961
- Tell you what?
- That you do karate.

493
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:21,173
- You never ask.
- Where'd you learn it?

494
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:22,799
Father.

495
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:25,385
I thought he was a fisherman.

496
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:29,139
In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things:

497
00:43:29,681 --> 00:43:31,642
Fish and karate.

498
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,936
Karate come from China, 16th century.

499
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,689
<i>Called "te," hand.</i>

500
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,900
Much later...

501
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:45,656
...Miyagi ancestors call "karate,"
empty hand.

502
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:50,118
I always thought it came
from Buddhist temples.

503
00:43:50,952 --> 00:43:53,038
You, too much TV.

504
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:56,124
That's what my mother tells me.

505
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,256
- Have you ever taught anyone?
- No.

506
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,424
Would you?

507
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,052
- It depend.
- On what?

508
00:44:07,552 --> 00:44:08,595
Reason.

509
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,098
How's revenge?

510
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:17,896
You look for revenge that way,
start by digging two graves.

511
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:21,191
At least I'd have company, right?

512
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,736
Fighting always last answer to problem.

513
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,740
Mr. Miyagi, I don't think
you understand my problem.

514
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:32,035
Miyagi understand problem perfect.

515
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:37,124
Your friend all karate student?

516
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:40,002
Friends? Yeah, those guys.

517
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:41,628
Problem attitude.

518
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,882
The problem is I keep getting
my ass kicked.

519
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:49,845
Because boys have bad attitude.

520
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:53,181
Karate for defence only.

521
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,727
That's not what these guys are taught.

522
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:58,854
I can see.

523
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:03,275
No such thing bad student,
only bad teacher.

524
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:06,069
Teacher say, student do.

525
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:08,947
Great, that solves everything.

526
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:13,201
I'll go to the school and straighten it out
with the teacher.

527
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,122
Now use head
for something other than target.

528
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:21,460
- I was only kidding.
- Why kidding?

529
00:45:22,044 --> 00:45:24,171
I get killed if I show up there.

530
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,715
Get killed anyway.

531
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:34,056
Would you go with me?

532
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:36,933
No, I can't.

533
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,311
Why? You said it was a good idea.

534
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,229
For you, good idea.

535
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:44,274
For me, good idea no get involved.

536
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:46,818
But you're already involved.

537
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:48,403
- Very sorry.
- What?

538
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:56,536
Thanks for nothing then.

539
00:45:56,995 --> 00:45:59,831
Like I didn't have enough problems already.

540
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:04,920
Now I've got to carry your weight, too.
Don't do me any more favours.

541
00:46:05,003 --> 00:46:07,381
<i>- Daniel-san.
- What?</i>

542
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:13,303
Okay, I go.

543
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:18,684
- Excellent, Mr. Miyagi.
- Miyagi.

544
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:20,936
Miyagi.

545
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:23,188
What kind of belt do you have?

546
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:25,023
Canvas.

547
00:46:25,273 --> 00:46:26,400
You like?

548
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,944
J.C. Penney. $3.98.

549
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,737
I meant...

550
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:34,116
In Okinawa a belt means
no need rope hold up pants.

551
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,787
That's funny.

552
00:46:38,954 --> 00:46:40,622
<i>- Daniel-san.
- What?</i>

553
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,876
Karate here.

554
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,422
Karate here.

555
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:51,591
Karate never here.

556
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,594
You understand?

557
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:57,681
I think so.

558
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,560
<i>Goodnight, Daniel-san.</i>

559
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:05,230
Goodnight, Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi!

560
00:47:06,315 --> 00:47:07,774
Tomorrow morning?

561
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,818
10:00.

562
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:19,703
Thanks for helping me out
with my friends out there.

563
00:47:33,175 --> 00:47:37,596
- Good morning, Mr. Miyagi.
- How do you feel?

564
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,017
- A little sore.
- You know how drive?

565
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,186
Yeah, I do.

566
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:49,399
- No, I'm not very good at it.
- Me neither.

567
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:51,485
I don't have a licence.

568
00:47:51,777 --> 00:47:53,070
Me neither.

569
00:47:53,862 --> 00:47:56,740
I guess it's okay then.

570
00:48:34,236 --> 00:48:36,947
You lose concentration
in a fight and you're dead meat!

571
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,198
<i>- Yes, Sensei.
- What?</i>

572
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:39,449
<i>Yes, Sensei!</i>

573
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:42,202
Get up!

574
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,832
Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles.

575
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:52,170
Combat!

576
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,266
Brown. Robertson.

577
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:16,445
On guard.

578
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:23,660
Point. Round kick.

579
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,204
What are you looking at? Finish him!

580
00:49:28,123 --> 00:49:29,499
Return.

581
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:33,920
Prepare.

582
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:40,636
We do not train to be merciful, here.
Mercy is for the weak.

583
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,348
Here, on the street, in competition...

584
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:46,433
...a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

585
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:50,312
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

586
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:55,525
Come on, let's forget this.

587
00:49:56,234 --> 00:49:58,111
Wait, not yet.

588
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,033
Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me.

589
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:13,335
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

590
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:16,171
Afraid the facts mixed up.

591
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,423
Are you calling him a liar?

592
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:20,759
No call no one nothing.

593
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:23,053
What are you here for, old man?

594
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:25,389
Come ask leave boy alone.

595
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,767
Can't the boy take care of himself?

596
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,644
One-to-one problem, yes.

597
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,481
Five-to-one problem, too much ask anyone.

598
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:36,984
Is that what's bothering you, the odds?

599
00:50:37,442 --> 00:50:39,236
Well, we can fix that.

600
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:42,072
<i>- Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes, Sensei!</i>

601
00:50:42,197 --> 00:50:43,448
No more fighting.

602
00:50:43,532 --> 00:50:45,951
<i>This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class.</i>

603
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:49,246
You don't come in here,
drop a challenge and leave, old man.

604
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,125
You get your boy on the mat,
or you and I will have a problem.

605
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:56,461
<i>Too much advantage, your dojo.</i>

606
00:50:57,462 --> 00:50:58,964
Name a place.

607
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:00,924
Tournament.

608
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,432
You've got real nerve, old man.

609
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:11,852
But I think we can accommodate you.

610
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,438
Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?

611
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,064
<i>Yes, Sensei.</i>

612
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:17,941
Fall in.

613
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,032
Ask one more small request.

614
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:27,159
Make it fast.

615
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:30,537
Ask leave boy alone to train.

616
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:34,166
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't you?

617
00:51:34,249 --> 00:51:36,251
But I like that.

618
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,216
No one touches the prima donna
until the tournament.

619
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:46,678
<i>- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sensei!</i>

620
00:51:48,513 --> 00:51:50,098
But if you don't show...

621
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,185
...then it's open season...

622
00:51:55,228 --> 00:51:56,521
...on him...

623
00:51:58,273 --> 00:51:59,566
...and you.

624
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,719
I can't believe this.

625
00:52:28,387 --> 00:52:30,347
- I cannot believe this!
- What?

626
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,809
What you just got me into.
You said you'd make things better.

627
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:36,061
- I did.
- How?

628
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,982
How? I saved you two months of beating.

629
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:43,694
Great, now I've got something
to look forward to.

630
00:52:48,657 --> 00:52:50,826
How much further is your house?

631
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,370
Other side tracks.

632
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,872
Are you in the oil business, too?

633
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,501
Not everything is as seem.

634
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:02,170
Reminds me of Newark.
What are we going to do here?

635
00:53:02,254 --> 00:53:03,755
Start training.

636
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:05,716
Much work be done.

637
00:53:05,924 --> 00:53:08,093
Tournament here before you know it.

638
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,262
That's what I'm afraid of.

639
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:18,520
That teacher was really wacko.
You really think I can beat that guy?

640
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:20,063
No matter.

641
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:23,608
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.

642
00:53:23,775 --> 00:53:25,694
Stupid, but fact of life.

643
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:27,612
Win, lose, no matter.

644
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,615
You make good fight, earn respect.

645
00:53:30,866 --> 00:53:34,619
- Then nobody bother.
- They'll bury me where I fall.

646
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:39,624
Either way, problem solved.
Wait right here.

647
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:50,010
This is great.

648
00:53:57,643 --> 00:54:01,563
- I forgot to give you this back.
- You keep.

649
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:02,898
Thanks a lot.

650
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,652
- Ready?
- Yeah, I guess so.

651
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,657
<i>Daniel-san, must talk.</i>

652
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,702
Walk on road.

653
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:20,624
Walk right side, safe. Walk left side, safe.

654
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:26,588
Walk middle, sooner or later,
you get squished just like grape.

655
00:54:27,255 --> 00:54:29,341
Here, karate same thing.

656
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:34,179
Either you karate do, yes, or karate do, no.

657
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:39,017
You karate do, "guess so," just like grape.

658
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,770
Understand?

659
00:54:42,938 --> 00:54:44,690
Yeah, I understand.

660
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,192
Ready?

661
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,653
Yeah, I'm ready.

662
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,238
Yes.

663
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:55,993
First make sacred pact.

664
00:54:57,244 --> 00:55:01,999
I promise teach karate. That's my part.

665
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:09,548
You promise learn. I say, you do,
no questions. That's your part.

666
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:12,217
Deal?

667
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,386
It's a deal.

668
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:22,978
First wash all the cars, then wax.

669
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,983
- Why do I have to...
- Remember deal. No questions.

670
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:30,193
Yeah, but...

671
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:36,074
Wax on right hand. Wax off left hand.

672
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:39,328
Wax on, wax off.

673
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:43,165
Breathe in through nose,
out through mouth.

674
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,002
Wax on, wax off.

675
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:49,796
Don't forget to breathe. Very important.

676
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,841
Wax on, wax off.

677
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:55,427
Wax on, wax off.

678
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,262
Where did these cars come from?

679
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,806
Detroit.

680
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:19,993
Wax on...

681
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,704
...right hand make circle.

682
00:56:22,788 --> 00:56:25,582
Wax off, left hand make circle.

683
00:56:25,874 --> 00:56:28,877
Wax on, wax off.

684
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:32,297
Breathe in, breathe out.

685
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:35,592
Wax on, wax off.

686
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,169
Mr. Miyagi, I'm finished.

687
00:57:12,379 --> 00:57:14,131
You want to check these out?

688
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,758
Mr. Miyagi?

689
00:57:19,011 --> 00:57:20,095
Mr. Miyagi?

690
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:28,478
Hello?

691
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,101
I've been looking all over for you.
Where've you been?

692
00:58:08,226 --> 00:58:10,479
- I don't believe it.
- What?

693
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,940
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find that idiot.

694
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:16,735
- No, it's been taken care of.
- Until next time.

695
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,696
- There isn't going to be a "next time."
- There they are.

696
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:23,950
Watch this.
Hey, guys, it's good to see you.

697
00:58:24,493 --> 00:58:27,204
Sorry about your eye, Johnny.
Your shoulder okay, Tommy?

698
00:58:27,412 --> 00:58:30,374
You guys be careful not to step
in front of any more buses.

699
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:34,753
<i>Hold it. Remember what Sensei said?
Wait for the tournament.</i>

700
00:58:34,836 --> 00:58:37,214
It must be "Take a Worm for a Walk" week.

701
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:41,385
You did all that damage?

702
00:58:41,468 --> 00:58:44,221
When you make a wish in the shower,
it always comes true.

703
00:58:44,304 --> 00:58:47,474
- I should have kept my mouth shut.
- No, we've got an agreement.

704
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,226
Yeah? What's that?

705
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:54,022
They agreed not to beat up on me
and I promised not to bleed on them.

706
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,567
- I don't believe you.
- What can I do, moan and groan?

707
00:58:57,651 --> 00:59:01,071
- Anybody else would.
- Who'd listen anyway?

708
00:59:01,196 --> 00:59:02,280
Me.

709
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:04,866
Really?

710
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,997
- You feel like listening on Saturday night?
- Sure.

711
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,374
Great! So Saturday night...

712
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:15,961
...we'll go out, we'll have a good time.
We'll do whatever.

713
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:19,965
- Is that your address?
- You got it.

714
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,426
Where is this?

715
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,053
- I've got to go.
- Okay.

716
00:59:25,137 --> 00:59:28,140
I'll talk to you later. Great.

717
00:59:29,016 --> 00:59:30,225
All right.

718
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:38,233
Mr. Harris, can I talk to you?
LaRusso. Third period history class.

719
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:43,655
I wanted to tell you, I really got a lot
out of that lecture about the Indians.

720
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:49,119
I was telling my buddies about it.
Could you give us a quick review?

721
00:59:49,202 --> 00:59:51,788
- Sure, I'm free this period.
- Great for me.

722
00:59:51,872 --> 00:59:54,416
No, I got to go.

723
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:58,295
I guess that leaves you and me,
but that's all right.

724
00:59:58,378 --> 01:00:00,839
You can tell them about it later.

725
01:00:00,922 --> 01:00:05,177
The Plains Indians
were a very primitive tribe...

726
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:20,567
Come on, Casanova.

727
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:50,514
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good.

728
01:00:50,597 --> 01:00:52,933
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

729
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,851
You've got company.

730
01:00:54,935 --> 01:00:58,355
Those are my parents.
Come on, I want you to meet them.

731
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,940
Great.

732
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:02,359
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

733
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:04,861
This is Daniel LaRusso.

734
01:01:04,945 --> 01:01:07,948
- My parents, Mr. And Mrs. Mills.
- How do you do, Daniel?

735
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,159
- Hello, Daniel.
- Nice to meet you.

736
01:01:11,243 --> 01:01:14,287
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. Where are we going?

737
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,164
I don't know. Wherever you want.

738
01:01:16,248 --> 01:01:19,501
- Golf N' Stuff?
- We're going to Golf N' Stuff, then.

739
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:23,463
Don't worry about that.
Weren't you going to have that fixed?

740
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:25,507
I am. I was. I will.

741
01:01:25,632 --> 01:01:29,553
- You live in Encino, Daniel?
- Encino? No.

742
01:01:30,178 --> 01:01:34,266
- Where do you live?
- Out, like Reseda.

743
01:01:35,976 --> 01:01:39,604
- And that's your mother?
- Yeah, that's her.

744
01:01:39,688 --> 01:01:40,981
Hi!

745
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:44,234
She's waiting for us.
We'd better go. Nice to meet you.

746
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:47,029
- Not too late, sweetheart.
- Okay, Dad.

747
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:56,246
- Hi, Mrs. LaRusso. I'm Ali.
- Hi, Ali. Call me Lucille.

748
01:01:57,205 --> 01:02:00,125
- That's a beautiful house you have.
- Thanks.

749
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:09,134
- Can you drive a stick?
- Yeah.

750
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:13,722
Put it into second, let it roll,
and when I say "pop it," pop it.

751
01:02:13,847 --> 01:02:14,931
"Pop it."

752
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:22,648
Don't worry, it's all under control.

753
01:02:23,357 --> 01:02:26,360
She's cute. It happens a lot.

754
01:02:26,735 --> 01:02:30,947
Okay, LaRusso, push! On, you huskies!

755
01:02:31,073 --> 01:02:33,283
Okay, pop it!

756
01:02:33,992 --> 01:02:36,411
We got it on the first!

757
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,892
I'll pick you up at 11:00.
Please, don't be late. Have fun.

758
01:03:02,354 --> 01:03:06,775
- Look at that slide.
- We'll do that next time.

759
01:03:07,776 --> 01:03:10,696
- Why next time?
- You need a bathing suit.

760
01:03:11,363 --> 01:03:14,116
Oh, yeah. Bathing suits.

761
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,370
- Do you play hockey?
- Not professionally.

762
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:24,645
This is the best time
I've had since I've been here.

763
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:27,648
- We'll have to do it again.
- Definitely.

764
01:04:28,148 --> 01:04:30,067
Hey, good looking. How are you?

765
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:31,693
Good. This is cool.

766
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:34,780
- I just got it. You want a ride?
- Some other time.

767
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:38,033
- Are you sure?
- Daniel, this is Eddie. Eddie, Daniel.

768
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:39,993
- How are you doing, Daniel?
- Good.

769
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:43,246
- Hey, Ali! How's it going?
- Hi, guys.

770
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:46,541
- How are you doing?
- Want to come with us?

771
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:50,128
No, I don't think so.
You guys have a good time.

772
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:52,506
- We'll make room.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

773
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:55,300
Your little friend can come,
if it's okay with his mommy.

774
01:04:55,384 --> 01:04:56,677
Hi, kids.

775
01:04:57,094 --> 01:05:01,932
- Hey, Mommy, can Daniel come for a ride?
- I really like your car.

776
01:05:10,357 --> 01:05:13,777
- You could've gone.
- I didn't want to.

777
01:05:14,194 --> 01:05:18,865
- It's no big deal.
- If I'd wanted to go, I would have.

778
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:23,120
It makes no difference to me.
Do what you want, I don't care.

779
01:05:55,444 --> 01:05:57,112
This is beautiful.

780
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:06,079
Mr. Miyagi, this is great.
You've got real fish in there.

781
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,334
This is outrageous.

782
01:06:11,293 --> 01:06:15,505
I thought Chung Lee's restaurant was nice.
You beat his act.

783
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:18,467
This is paradise. Did you do this yourself?

784
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:21,553
Are these bongos?

785
01:06:21,928 --> 01:06:23,722
No, I got it.

786
01:06:23,889 --> 01:06:27,392
<i>"Hare Krishna"</i>

787
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:29,561
<i>Daniel-san, you much humour.</i>

788
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:32,314
- What are these?
- Japanese sander.

789
01:06:32,648 --> 01:06:35,859
- What do you do with them?
- Funny you should ask.

790
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:40,322
Right circle.

791
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,283
Left circle.

792
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:48,413
- It'd be easier going back and forth.
- But you go circle.

793
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,082
Right circle.

794
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,209
Left circle.

795
01:06:53,502 --> 01:06:57,464
Right circle, left circle.

796
01:06:58,048 --> 01:07:00,634
Breathe in, breathe out.

797
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:04,554
Right circle, left circle.

798
01:07:05,138 --> 01:07:07,474
Right circle, left circle.

799
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,977
Breathe in, breathe out.

800
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:17,567
Whole floor. Right circle, left circle.

801
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:19,903
Right circle.

802
01:07:20,445 --> 01:07:22,280
Left circle.

803
01:07:22,656 --> 01:07:25,951
Breathe in, breathe out.

804
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,221
Very good.

805
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:50,058
Splinters all gone.

806
01:07:53,145 --> 01:07:54,771
I'm finished.

807
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:57,774
Mr. Miyagi, I'm beat.

808
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:00,068
My shoulders.

809
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:01,528
Good.

810
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:04,281
Go home, get rest.

811
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:08,577
Come morning, start early. 6:00.

812
01:08:58,168 --> 01:09:00,212
Wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

813
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:06,093
Man who catch fly with chopsticks,
accomplish anything.

814
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,805
Did you ever catch one?

815
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:11,640
Not yet.

816
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:15,894
Could I try?

817
01:09:17,437 --> 01:09:18,689
If wish.

818
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,842
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, look!

819
01:09:54,349 --> 01:09:56,268
You, beginner luck.

820
01:09:58,312 --> 01:10:03,025
I guess that means I can accomplish
anything, right? No sweat.

821
01:10:03,275 --> 01:10:06,987
First you accomplish paint fence.

822
01:10:18,832 --> 01:10:20,500
All in wrist.

823
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,963
Wrist up. Wrist down.

824
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:31,219
All in wrist. Up, down, long stroke.

825
01:10:31,303 --> 01:10:34,431
Very good. Up, down.

826
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:36,975
No look me, look fence.

827
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:39,144
Up...

828
01:10:40,312 --> 01:10:41,355
...down.

829
01:10:42,564 --> 01:10:46,443
Bend the wrist. Downstroke, you bend.
See? Good.

830
01:10:46,526 --> 01:10:50,155
Long stroke. Up, down. Very good.

831
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:52,574
Bend your knees. Down.

832
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:53,784
Up.

833
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,954
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.
Don't forget to breathe.</i>

834
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,873
In, out.

835
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:00,999
Up...

836
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:03,293
...down.

837
01:11:05,003 --> 01:11:07,714
Up, down.

838
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,132
Up...

839
01:11:09,925 --> 01:11:10,968
...down.

840
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:12,719
Up...

841
01:11:13,345 --> 01:11:14,388
...down.

842
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:20,936
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.</i>

843
01:11:21,186 --> 01:11:23,355
Up, down.

844
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:26,066
Up...

845
01:11:27,275 --> 01:11:28,735
...down.

846
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:37,577
Small board, left hand.
Big board, right hand.

847
01:11:37,828 --> 01:11:41,331
- I'm almost done.
- All of fence.

848
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:50,299
Big board, right hand.
Small board, left hand.

849
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:52,676
Up, down.

850
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:55,804
Up, down.

851
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,533
All finished.

852
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,577
It looks pretty good, huh?

853
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:20,787
Both sides?

854
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,126
Not yet.

855
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:45,937
<i>Daniel-san. Very good job.</i>

856
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:49,524
Come morning. Start early.

857
01:13:02,954 --> 01:13:04,122
Up...

858
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:05,999
...down.

859
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:07,918
Up...

860
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:09,586
...down.

861
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:41,493
Damn it! I can't believe this.

862
01:14:02,055 --> 01:14:03,640
Missed spot.

863
01:14:04,057 --> 01:14:05,309
What spot?

864
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:09,396
- You didn't tell me you were going fishing.
- You not here when I go.

865
01:14:09,563 --> 01:14:13,150
- Maybe I wanted to go.
- You karate training.

866
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:16,069
I'm what? I'm being your goddamn slave!

867
01:14:16,153 --> 01:14:18,196
- We made a deal here.
- So?

868
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,241
"So"? You're supposed to teach
and I'm supposed to learn.

869
01:14:21,366 --> 01:14:24,578
Four days I've been busting my ass,
I haven't learned a thing.

870
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:27,914
- You learn plenty.
- I've learned to sand your decks.

871
01:14:27,998 --> 01:14:31,376
I've waxed your car, I paint your house,
paint your fence.

872
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:35,380
- Not everything is as seems.
- Bullshit! I'm going home, man.

873
01:14:36,089 --> 01:14:38,050
<i>Daniel-san!</i>

874
01:14:39,176 --> 01:14:40,969
- What?
- Come here.

875
01:14:46,558 --> 01:14:50,687
- Show me sand the floor.
- I can't move my arm, all right?

876
01:14:55,984 --> 01:14:57,277
What are you doing?

877
01:15:02,949 --> 01:15:04,242
What are you doing?

878
01:15:05,952 --> 01:15:10,457
- Now show me sand the floor.
- How did you do that?

879
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:11,750
Show!

880
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:16,505
Sand the floor?

881
01:15:19,758 --> 01:15:21,343
Stand up.

882
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:26,056
Show me sand the floor.

883
01:15:29,059 --> 01:15:30,811
Sand the floor.

884
01:15:31,603 --> 01:15:32,854
Sand the floor.

885
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,607
Big circle. Sand the floor.

886
01:15:36,775 --> 01:15:38,151
Sand the floor.

887
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:44,074
Now show me wax on, wax off.

888
01:15:52,082 --> 01:15:55,127
- Wax on, wax off.
- "Wax on, wax off!"

889
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,336
Wax on...

890
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,046
...wax off.

891
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,383
Concentrate. Look in my eyes.

892
01:16:01,508 --> 01:16:03,969
Lock your hand, thumb inside.

893
01:16:04,261 --> 01:16:06,013
Wax on...

894
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:08,056
...wax off.

895
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:09,641
Wax on...

896
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,144
...wax off.

897
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:14,813
Wax on.

898
01:16:15,981 --> 01:16:17,232
Wax off.

899
01:16:19,693 --> 01:16:22,946
Show me paint the fence. Up, down.

900
01:16:25,449 --> 01:16:26,533
Up.

901
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:28,201
Down.

902
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:29,661
Up.

903
01:16:30,037 --> 01:16:31,121
Down.

904
01:16:31,288 --> 01:16:34,249
Other side. Look eye. Always look eye!

905
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:36,960
Show me paint the house. Side, side.

906
01:16:41,298 --> 01:16:44,676
Lock wrist. Side, side.

907
01:16:45,636 --> 01:16:46,845
Side, side.

908
01:16:48,263 --> 01:16:50,974
Show me wax on, wax off.

909
01:16:58,023 --> 01:16:59,983
Show me paint the fence.

910
01:17:05,113 --> 01:17:07,324
Show me side, side.

911
01:17:12,204 --> 01:17:14,331
Show me sand the floor.

912
01:17:33,433 --> 01:17:36,311
Look eye! Always look eye.

913
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:39,439
Come back tomorrow.

914
01:18:26,737 --> 01:18:30,824
Learn balance. Go water, kick.
Learn balance.

915
01:20:13,927 --> 01:20:16,388
What were you doing on those stumps?

916
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:19,725
- Called crane technique.
- Does it work?

917
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:22,728
If do right, no can defence.

918
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,563
Could you teach me?

919
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:27,733
First learn stand, then learn fly.

920
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:32,195
<i>- Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.
- Who taught you?</i>

921
01:20:32,321 --> 01:20:36,074
- Father teach.
- You must have had some father.

922
01:20:37,242 --> 01:20:41,455
- Look, the kid's got a pet Nip.
- He know any tricks, kid?

923
01:20:42,831 --> 01:20:46,460
Excuse, please. Boy cold, must leave.

924
01:20:46,543 --> 01:20:49,171
Kindly remove bottle.

925
01:20:52,299 --> 01:20:55,469
Kindly do it yourself, Mr. Moto.

926
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,398
How did you do that?

927
01:21:08,482 --> 01:21:11,401
Don't know. First time.

928
01:21:15,947 --> 01:21:17,908
Hey, you!

929
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:31,338
- Hey, not bad. Definitely varsity material.
- You let me.

930
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:37,511
Should we try the slide on Friday?
I could pick you up about 7:00.

931
01:21:37,844 --> 01:21:40,681
I'm having dinner with my parents
at the country club.

932
01:21:40,764 --> 01:21:43,558
I'll be done by 9:30. Meet me out front.

933
01:21:43,642 --> 01:21:45,060
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

934
01:21:45,143 --> 01:21:46,520
Johnny, over here!

935
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:50,607
- What's the matter?
- It's that little voice again.

936
01:21:50,691 --> 01:21:54,277
Pretend you're deaf.
Encino Oaks Country Club. 9:30.

937
01:21:54,361 --> 01:21:57,030
Friday? Great.

938
01:21:57,155 --> 01:21:59,616
- Hi, Ali.
- "Hi, Ali."

939
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,743
I've got to be nuts.

940
01:22:15,966 --> 01:22:18,719
Okay, here. Stop. Throw anchor.

941
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,394
Good. Stand bow.

942
01:22:29,938 --> 01:22:32,024
Not bow. Bow!

943
01:22:33,233 --> 01:22:35,402
- Up!
- What, up front?

944
01:22:35,944 --> 01:22:37,112
Make block.

945
01:22:37,904 --> 01:22:40,324
Left, right. Up, down.

946
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:44,286
Side, side. Breathe in, breathe out.

947
01:22:45,912 --> 01:22:47,664
And no scare fish.

948
01:22:52,419 --> 01:22:54,546
When do I learn how to punch?

949
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,299
Better learn balance.

950
01:22:57,716 --> 01:22:59,551
Balance is key.

951
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,805
Balance good, karate good.
Everything good.

952
01:23:04,014 --> 01:23:08,477
Balance bad, better pack up, go home.
Understand?

953
01:23:09,936 --> 01:23:11,355
Yeah, I understand.

954
01:23:16,109 --> 01:23:18,737
Did you ever get into fights
when you were a kid?

955
01:23:19,112 --> 01:23:20,364
Plenty.

956
01:23:20,864 --> 01:23:25,661
- It wasn't like the problem I have, right?
- Fighting, fighting. Same, same.

957
01:23:25,911 --> 01:23:27,746
But you knew karate.

958
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:31,083
Someone always know more.

959
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:34,378
There were times
when you were scared to fight?

960
01:23:36,088 --> 01:23:39,216
Always scared. Miyagi hate fighting.

961
01:23:40,092 --> 01:23:42,928
- But you like karate.
- So?

962
01:23:44,054 --> 01:23:46,014
Karate's fighting, you train to fight.

963
01:23:48,183 --> 01:23:49,726
That what you think?

964
01:23:54,022 --> 01:23:55,107
No.

965
01:23:55,232 --> 01:23:56,692
Then why train?

966
01:23:59,069 --> 01:24:00,779
So I won't have to fight.

967
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:04,616
Miyagi have hope for you.

968
01:24:05,325 --> 01:24:08,453
- When do I learn how to punch?
- Learn how punch...

969
01:24:08,704 --> 01:24:11,540
...when learn how keep dry!
- No!

970
01:24:15,711 --> 01:24:18,964
<i>Daniel-san, you're all wet behind ear!</i>

971
01:24:19,089 --> 01:24:20,841
Are you crazy?

972
01:24:22,134 --> 01:24:23,552
You're crazy.

973
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:46,783
Trouble with Johnny?

974
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:50,829
- You two lovebirds having problems?
- We're not lovebirds.

975
01:24:50,954 --> 01:24:54,916
- What time is it?
- It's about 9:40.

976
01:24:55,876 --> 01:24:59,004
- I've got to go.
- Do you have a date?

977
01:25:02,215 --> 01:25:04,384
- With whom?
- A friend.

978
01:25:04,468 --> 01:25:06,720
Not that boy from Reseda.

979
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,889
Yeah, he's from Reseda.

980
01:25:08,972 --> 01:25:11,350
He's a nice guy. It's no big deal.

981
01:25:11,475 --> 01:25:15,062
Honey, you've monopolised
the best-looking man here long enough.

982
01:25:15,896 --> 01:25:17,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

983
01:25:19,858 --> 01:25:23,403
I've been thinking,
maybe we can call a truce.

984
01:25:23,945 --> 01:25:26,948
I'm not at war. Excuse me.

985
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,242
Could we please finish the dance?

986
01:26:32,556 --> 01:26:35,017
Don't you ever do that to me again!

987
01:27:27,778 --> 01:27:30,572
I didn't know you were a singer.
How are you doing?

988
01:27:31,615 --> 01:27:35,786
<i>Daniel-san, come inside.</i>

989
01:27:36,328 --> 01:27:39,748
- What's that song you were singing?
- Japanese blues.

990
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,876
<i>Kampai.</i>

991
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:45,712
<i>Kampai.</i>

992
01:27:53,595 --> 01:27:55,430
<i>Banzai!</i>

993
01:27:56,723 --> 01:27:58,058
To baby trees.

994
01:27:59,893 --> 01:28:02,771
<i>Not bonsai. Banzai!</i>

995
01:28:03,689 --> 01:28:04,898
<i>Banzai.</i>

996
01:28:05,565 --> 01:28:07,818
<i>Banzai!</i>

997
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:11,029
<i>- Banzai!
- Close enough.</i>

998
01:28:24,418 --> 01:28:27,754
- What are we celebrating here?
- Anniversary.

999
01:28:28,922 --> 01:28:30,716
Whose anniversary?

1000
01:28:32,843 --> 01:28:35,721
Is this your wife?
I didn't know you were married.

1001
01:28:37,597 --> 01:28:41,268
- Damn beautiful, don't you think?
- Yeah, she's pretty.

1002
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,564
First time I saw her...

1003
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:49,401
...was cane field, Hawaii.

1004
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,237
Beautiful.

1005
01:28:54,156 --> 01:28:56,366
Damn good cane cutter, too.

1006
01:28:59,578 --> 01:29:01,163
Where is she now?

1007
01:29:02,956 --> 01:29:04,124
Drink, drink.

1008
01:29:13,842 --> 01:29:15,218
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

1009
01:29:17,763 --> 01:29:19,014
Look, look.

1010
01:29:24,311 --> 01:29:28,523
First American-born Miyagi
waiting to be born.

1011
01:29:35,614 --> 01:29:37,324
Drink, drink.

1012
01:29:41,787 --> 01:29:43,288
"Sergeant Miyagi!

1013
01:29:43,747 --> 01:29:44,873

Complications. No doctor came.

1020
01:30:12,818 --> 01:30:15,696
Land of free, home of brave.

1021
01:30:16,071 --> 01:30:17,739
No doctor came.

01:30:35,299 --> 01:30:36,508
Mr. Miyagi.

1023

Are you okay?

1024

Power, whole body, one inch, here.

Now punch.

1034

Hard.

You some kind of girl or something?

1036
01:34:34,746 --> 01:34:38,834
Punch! Drive a punch.
Not just arm. Whole body.

1037

<i>Hip, leg, drive a punch. Make kiai.</i>

1038

Give you power. Now drive punch.

1040

<i>Very good, Daniel-san.</i>

01:34:58,687 --> 01:35:00,397
Hey, pretty good?

1043
01:35:01,106 --> 01:35:02,524
Look at this.

1044
01:35:05,068 --> 01:35:07,571
<i>Wait. Daniel-san.</i>

1045
01:35:10,824 --> 01:35:12,284
What do you think?

1046
01:35:15,037 --> 01:35:18,332
I tell you what Miyagi think,
I think you dance around too much.

1047
01:35:18,415 --> 01:35:21,960
I think you talk too much.
I think you no concentrate enough.

1048
01:35:22,085 --> 01:35:24,838
Lots of work to be done.
Tournament just around corner.

1049
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:26,465
Come, stand up.

1050
01:35:26,965 --> 01:35:30,802
Steady, concentrate. Focus power.

1051
01:35:36,683 --> 01:35:37,893
Drive a punch.

1052
01:35:38,894 --> 01:35:40,979
<i>Drive a punch, Daniel-san.</i>

1053
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:47,277
"Happy birthday to you

1054
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:52,950
"Happy birthday to you

1055
01:35:53,492 --> 01:35:58,330
<i>"Happy birthday, dear Daniel-san</i>

1056
01:35:59,122 --> 01:36:03,377
"Happy birthday to you"

1057
01:36:06,046 --> 01:36:07,172
Make wish.

1058
01:36:08,966 --> 01:36:10,801
I know what I'm wishing for.

1059
01:36:14,721 --> 01:36:16,515
Very good.

1060
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:24,439
Number one birthday present.

1061
01:36:24,606 --> 01:36:28,193
Mr. Miyagi, what did you do?
You didn't have to do this.

1062
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,405
What is this? I have no idea.

1063
01:36:33,865 --> 01:36:37,953
Mr. Miyagi, this is great.

1064
01:36:39,997 --> 01:36:41,873
Where did this come from?

1065
01:36:42,457 --> 01:36:46,920
Mrs. Miyagi make, long time ago.

1066
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,802
If you ever want this patch back,
I'll understand.

1067
01:36:54,886 --> 01:36:56,972
I know you understand.

1068
01:36:58,932 --> 01:36:59,975
Try on.

1069
01:37:01,226 --> 01:37:04,021
This is beautiful. This is great.

1070
01:37:04,604 --> 01:37:07,274
Do you think I stand a chance
at the tournament?

1071
01:37:07,858 --> 01:37:10,861
Not matter what Miyagi think.
Miyagi not fighting.

1072
01:37:12,362 --> 01:37:14,489
I don't know if I know enough karate.

1073
01:37:15,449 --> 01:37:16,908
Feeling correct.

1074
01:37:17,993 --> 01:37:20,579
You sure know how to make
a guy feel confident.

1075
01:37:21,663 --> 01:37:26,877
You trust the quality of what you know,
not quantity.

1076
01:37:29,254 --> 01:37:31,632
Today you get driver's licence?

1077
01:37:31,757 --> 01:37:34,926
Yeah, look at this.

1078
01:37:35,636 --> 01:37:37,846
Check that out.

1079
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,015
"Daniel LaRusso."

1080
01:37:42,267 --> 01:37:43,393
Congratulations.

1081
01:37:43,602 --> 01:37:45,687
Thanks. The kid's legal, now.

1082
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:49,858
I never know you have sweetheart.

1083
01:37:49,983 --> 01:37:51,193
No, I don't.

1084
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:52,986
Look good together.

1085
01:37:53,987 --> 01:37:55,155
Different, but same.

1086
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,866
No. Different, but different.

1087
01:37:59,785 --> 01:38:02,245
Too bad mother not here.

1088
01:38:02,371 --> 01:38:03,705
Shoot!

1089
01:38:04,164 --> 01:38:05,958
- Shoot! Damn!
- What's matter?

1090
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:10,545
I've got to go. My mother
is making a surprise cake for me.

1091
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:13,840
- Miyagi understand.
- I wasn't supposed to know. Damn it.

1092
01:38:13,966 --> 01:38:15,550
- That's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1093
01:38:15,634 --> 01:38:17,511
Miyagi once have mother, too.

1094
01:38:19,388 --> 01:38:21,515
Go outside. Something show you.

1095
01:38:21,598 --> 01:38:23,350
- What?
- Number two present.

1096
01:38:23,433 --> 01:38:24,559
Number two present?

1097
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:29,106
You don't have to give me anything.
You've given me enough already.

1098
01:38:29,773 --> 01:38:31,650
No really, I'm serious.

1099
01:38:33,193 --> 01:38:34,486
Choose.

1100
01:38:38,031 --> 01:38:39,700
Oh, no.

1101
01:38:41,243 --> 01:38:43,078
Hurt old man feeling.

1102
01:38:44,997 --> 01:38:47,291
- Choose.
- Oh, wow.

1103
01:38:57,926 --> 01:39:00,387
I can't believe it.

1104
01:39:04,016 --> 01:39:06,143
What a gift!

1105
01:39:15,694 --> 01:39:17,487
Oh, boy.

1106
01:39:21,033 --> 01:39:22,618
Just remember:

1107
01:39:22,868 --> 01:39:28,582
A licence never replace eye, ear and brain.

1108
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:35,130
What matter?

1109
01:39:36,048 --> 01:39:39,718
I'm just scared.
The tournament and everything.

1110
01:39:41,803 --> 01:39:45,140
You remember lesson about balance?

1111
01:39:46,767 --> 01:39:47,934
Yeah.

1112
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:52,356
Lesson not just karate only.

1113
01:39:53,857 --> 01:39:56,318
Lesson for whole life.

1114
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,323
Whole life have a balance.

1115
01:40:03,742 --> 01:40:06,078
Everything be better.

1116
01:40:08,705 --> 01:40:10,123
Understand?

1117
01:40:12,209 --> 01:40:13,669
Yeah, I understand.

1118
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:19,675
Oh, wow.

1119
01:40:25,806 --> 01:40:27,975
You're the best friend I ever had.

1120
01:40:29,977 --> 01:40:31,186
You...

1121
01:40:32,312 --> 01:40:34,231
...pretty okay, too.

1122
01:40:38,276 --> 01:40:39,903
Go.

1123
01:40:40,737 --> 01:40:42,364
Go find the balance.

1124
01:40:51,957 --> 01:40:54,835
<i>- Banzai, Daniel-san!
- Banzai!</i>

1125
01:41:39,963 --> 01:41:43,216
I give up. Don't shoot! No.

1126
01:41:45,093 --> 01:41:47,804
- Don't leave me. I'm wounded.
- Good, maybe you'll die.

1127
01:41:52,267 --> 01:41:55,687
- I just wanted to apologise.
- Fine, you apologised.

1128
01:41:56,396 --> 01:41:59,232
- I got my licence.
- Whoop-dee-doo.

1129
01:41:59,524 --> 01:42:02,986
- What's with you?
- What do you expect? Cartwheels?

1130
01:42:04,112 --> 01:42:09,660
I just expected some courtesy,
or is that only for people with fancy cars?

1131
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:14,539
Can't you take a hint?

1132
01:42:19,252 --> 01:42:20,921
Does the truth hurt?

1133
01:42:21,046 --> 01:42:23,465
- You really think that's it?
- I know it is.

1134
01:42:23,548 --> 01:42:25,801
- You're wrong.
- I bet I'm wrong.

1135
01:42:25,884 --> 01:42:30,013
I didn't go out with you
because of a car or where you live.

1136
01:42:30,097 --> 01:42:32,766
Okay, while we're on the subject,
why did you then?

1137
01:42:33,976 --> 01:42:35,268
Why did you?

1138
01:42:35,394 --> 01:42:38,647
I thought maybe you and me
were different.

1139
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:42,234
I'm from Reseda, you're from the hills,
that's how we're different.

1140
01:42:42,317 --> 01:42:45,570
Admit that you just can't handle
the situation the way it is.

1141
01:42:45,988 --> 01:42:48,699
I can handle it fine. You can't.

1142
01:42:49,825 --> 01:42:53,578
What makes you so sensitive?
She's never been anything but nice to you.

1143
01:42:53,745 --> 01:42:57,291
- She used me to make him jealous.
- She doesn't even like him.

1144
01:42:57,374 --> 01:43:01,086
Who could tell, the way their faces
were stuck together at the country club?

1145
01:43:01,169 --> 01:43:05,424
Right, you didn't stick around
for the exciting conclusion.

1146
01:43:05,507 --> 01:43:07,801
- What, his hand on her ass?
- Her right hook.

1147
01:43:07,884 --> 01:43:11,013
You think she sprained her wrist
doing her nails?

1148
01:43:12,681 --> 01:43:15,642
- She hit him?
- That's an understatement.

1149
01:43:17,853 --> 01:43:22,149
- Why didn't she say something?
- She shouldn't have to, should she?

1150
01:43:41,668 --> 01:43:43,086
Hey, slugger.

1151
01:43:48,634 --> 01:43:50,552
Look, I'm a jerk.

1152
01:43:53,889 --> 01:43:55,557
You are a jerk.

1153
01:43:56,642 --> 01:43:58,185
So, am I forgiven?

1154
01:44:00,187 --> 01:44:02,105
I don't hear anything.

1155
01:44:02,689 --> 01:44:04,524
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

1156
01:44:05,025 --> 01:44:07,402
Come here.

1157
01:44:18,455 --> 01:44:21,041
I guess you know
about the tournament tomorrow.

1158
01:44:21,541 --> 01:44:22,876
Who doesn't?

1159
01:44:23,001 --> 01:44:24,378
Dumb move, huh?

1160
01:44:25,003 --> 01:44:26,797
Not necessarily.

1161
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:29,967
I don't have much of a cheering section.

1162
01:44:30,258 --> 01:44:31,760
You got me.

1163
01:44:32,636 --> 01:44:35,722
I'll probably get killed in the first match.

1164
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,850
So, we'll leave early.

1165
01:44:53,824 --> 01:44:57,286
- I've got something to show you.
- What?

1166
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:04,710
- How do you like it?
- Is it yours? Are you serious?

1167
01:45:04,793 --> 01:45:08,255
- It's beautiful.
- It sure is.

1168
01:45:08,338 --> 01:45:10,507
- My God.
- Here you go.

1169
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:13,635
- You want me to drive?
- It's the '80s!

1170
01:45:15,137 --> 01:45:18,307
- To start, you push that button.
- You're incredible.

1171
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:22,811
Press the clutch.
Get the lights, no that one.

1172
01:45:23,395 --> 01:45:27,482
Good. Down is first. Let it out slow.

1173
01:45:28,066 --> 01:45:30,152
Hold on!

1174
01:45:31,528 --> 01:45:34,531
This is awesome. How fast does it go?

1175
01:45:34,948 --> 01:45:36,408
Let's not find out.

1176
01:45:39,995 --> 01:45:42,748
- What belt are you?
- Why matter?

1177
01:45:42,831 --> 01:45:45,792
This is open division,
it's only for brown belt or above.

1178
01:45:45,876 --> 01:45:47,628
Boy black belt.

1179
01:45:49,087 --> 01:45:52,674
You'd better hustle. They're starting.
Down the hall, to your left.

1180
01:45:53,008 --> 01:45:55,093
- I'll see you inside.
- Okay.

1181
01:45:55,802 --> 01:45:58,096
Excuse me, Mr. Referee.

1182
01:45:58,221 --> 01:46:01,475
This is not "Miyaji." Miyagi.

1183
01:46:01,558 --> 01:46:03,393
Miyagi.

1184
01:46:03,518 --> 01:46:05,103
Okay, thank you.

1185
01:46:13,862 --> 01:46:18,492
Well, look who we have here.
Our little friend Danielle.

1186
01:46:18,617 --> 01:46:20,202
Hello, Danielle.

1187
01:46:20,285 --> 01:46:23,413
What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress you?

1188
01:46:24,373 --> 01:46:27,876
I'm talking to you, punk.
Come on, make a move.

1189
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,878
Hey, save it for the ring.

1190
01:46:30,087 --> 01:46:31,129
Come on!

1191
01:46:31,797 --> 01:46:33,799
- All right.
- Let's go.

1192
01:46:34,508 --> 01:46:35,592
Come on.

1193
01:46:35,759 --> 01:46:37,928
Points or no points...

1194
01:46:39,054 --> 01:46:40,347
...you're dead meat.

1195
01:46:41,223 --> 01:46:43,266
I said out!

1196
01:46:45,644 --> 01:46:47,104
Dead meat.

1197
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:53,443
Way to go, I think he's gonna cry.

1198
01:47:03,787 --> 01:47:09,001
<i>The winner of the first match
in the open division is Rufus Schneider.</i>

1199
01:47:09,584 --> 01:47:13,338
- Mr. Miyagi.
- Hurry. Tournament starting.

1200
01:47:13,422 --> 01:47:14,172
Where'd we get this?

1201
01:47:14,256 --> 01:47:15,007
<i>Daniel LaRusso...</i>

1202
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:18,552
<i>- Buddha provide.
- ... please report to Ring 3.</i>

1203
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,429
- Where's Ring 3?
- Over there.

1204
01:47:20,512 --> 01:47:24,057
Hold it! Sorry, teachers and students only.

1205
01:47:24,766 --> 01:47:26,351
He doesn't speak English...

1206
01:47:26,435 --> 01:47:30,480
...and I can't understand his instructions
without her. She's his translator.

1207
01:47:31,815 --> 01:47:36,695
- What did he say?
- You remind him of his uncle in Tokyo.

1208
01:47:36,778 --> 01:47:41,950
- I guess it's okay. What?
- He says you're very kind.

1209
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,119
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1210
01:47:46,622 --> 01:47:49,207
- What are the rules here?
- I don't know.

1211
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:52,002
First time you, first time me.

1212
01:47:52,085 --> 01:47:55,839
I figured you knew about this stuff.
I figured you went to these before.

1213
01:47:55,922 --> 01:47:57,174
Great, I'm dead.

1214
01:47:57,257 --> 01:48:01,011
- You told me you fought a lot.
- For life, not for points.

1215
01:48:01,386 --> 01:48:03,639
Everything above your waist is a point.

1216
01:48:03,847 --> 01:48:07,309
You can hit the head, sternum,
kidneys, ribs. Got it?

1217
01:48:07,392 --> 01:48:09,603
- I hope so.
- You can do it.

1218
01:48:09,936 --> 01:48:12,314
When are you jerks going to grow up?

1219
01:48:18,737 --> 01:48:21,823
- Where am I, over here at this one?
- Number 3.

1220
01:48:21,907 --> 01:48:24,076
- What's that guy kneeling for?
- I don't know.

1221
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:27,245
- Don't you know anything?
- Don't get hit.

1222
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:39,883
Face. Bow. On guard.

1223
01:48:41,218 --> 01:48:41,927
Fight.

1224
01:48:48,392 --> 01:48:49,685
Back on your line.

1225
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:51,853
Be tough, Daniel.

1226
01:48:54,356 --> 01:48:55,816
Come on, be tough.

1227
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:02,698
Remember your defence. Points coming.
Concentrate. Focus power.

1228
01:49:02,781 --> 01:49:05,117
Remember balance. Make good fight.

1229
01:49:07,035 --> 01:49:10,289
Run out of the ring once more,
it'll cost you a point.

1230
01:49:10,372 --> 01:49:12,249
On guard. Ready?

1231
01:49:20,632 --> 01:49:22,843
That's one, Daniel, come on.

1232
01:49:25,345 --> 01:49:26,847
One more!

1233
01:49:27,514 --> 01:49:29,099
Move back on your line.

1234
01:49:29,975 --> 01:49:32,311
That's one point, round kick.

1235
01:49:33,562 --> 01:49:36,606
Daniel, you're the best!

1236
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:54,875
You're dead!

1237
01:51:36,977 --> 01:51:38,770
Point! Winner!

1238
01:52:28,153 --> 01:52:29,446
Winner!

1239
01:52:32,366 --> 01:52:34,451
- It must be tight.
- Yeah, right there.

1240
01:52:34,993 --> 01:52:37,913
- I never thought I'd get this far.
- Make two of us.

1241
01:52:37,996 --> 01:52:39,748
Wouldn't it be great if I won?

1242
01:52:39,873 --> 01:52:43,752
- It'd be great if you survive.
- What do you mean "survive"?

1243
01:52:44,211 --> 01:52:48,298
- I'm fine as long as I don't move.
- You've got to move now, they're starting.

1244
01:52:48,423 --> 01:52:51,635
Are they starting now?
What do you mean "survive"?

1245
01:52:52,803 --> 01:52:56,181
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1246
01:52:56,264 --> 01:52:59,726
<i>... may I have your attention, please.</i>

1247
01:52:59,893 --> 01:53:05,148
<i>This is the first semi-final match
of the afternoon.</i>

1248
01:53:07,442 --> 01:53:12,698
<i>Defending champion,
John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

1249
01:53:12,948 --> 01:53:16,827
<i>Two-time winner of the All Valley
Under-18 Golden Trophy.</i>

1250
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:21,665
<i>He'll be facing Darryl Vidal
of the Locust Valley Karate Club.</i>

1251
01:53:22,332 --> 01:53:27,004
<i>Three points wins.
Contestants, please come to the ring.</i>

1252
01:53:27,546 --> 01:53:29,548
<i>Good luck, gentlemen.</i>

1253
01:53:31,633 --> 01:53:33,427
Go get him, Johnny.

1254
01:53:34,303 --> 01:53:35,846
Show him what you're made of.

1255
01:53:36,305 --> 01:53:38,265
Face me, gentlemen. Bow.

1256
01:53:38,932 --> 01:53:41,810
Face. Bow. Ready?

1257
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:44,688
Come on, Johnny.

1258
01:53:47,482 --> 01:53:49,443
Fast, Johnny. Come on. Do it.

1259
01:53:54,448 --> 01:53:56,199
One point, Lawrence.

1260
01:54:05,834 --> 01:54:07,377
Lawrence, back on the line.

1261
01:54:07,502 --> 01:54:08,837
Way to go!

1262
01:54:08,962 --> 01:54:10,505
Are you all right?

1263
01:54:10,797 --> 01:54:12,007
I'm okay.

1264
01:54:14,301 --> 01:54:15,844
One point, Lawrence.

1265
01:54:20,599 --> 01:54:22,559
Good point, Johnny!

1266
01:54:24,478 --> 01:54:26,355
Point Lawrence. Winner!

1267
01:54:29,775 --> 01:54:35,030
<i>The next semi-final determines
who will face the defending champion.</i>

1268
01:54:35,447 --> 01:54:42,371
<i>Daniel LaRusso, of the Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

1269
01:54:43,705 --> 01:54:45,082
Bobby...

1270
01:54:45,624 --> 01:54:47,584
...I want him out of commission.

1271
01:54:47,709 --> 01:54:50,170
<i>Sensei, I can beat this guy.</i>

1272
01:54:52,005 --> 01:54:55,759
- I don't want him beaten.
- But I'll be disqualified!

1273
01:54:56,051 --> 01:54:57,886
Out of commission.

1274
01:55:01,598 --> 01:55:04,351
<i>Let's go, fellas. Good luck.</i>

1275
01:55:14,111 --> 01:55:16,196
Do what you got to do, Bobby!

1276
01:55:20,409 --> 01:55:24,579
Face. Bow. Ready?

1277
01:55:25,163 --> 01:55:27,958
Watch the control, gentlemen. Ready?

1278
01:55:36,425 --> 01:55:40,429
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.
- My leg!

1279
01:55:41,388 --> 01:55:45,475
- Mr. Miyagi, my leg hurts.
- Miyagi here.

1280
01:55:47,936 --> 01:55:52,274
<i>Bobby Brown of the Cobra Kai
has been disqualified...</i>

1281
01:55:52,649 --> 01:55:57,362
<i>... for excessive and deliberate contact.
Under rule 41-2...</i>

1282
01:55:58,238 --> 01:56:02,075
<i>... Daniel LaRusso has 15 minutes
to return to the ring.</i>

1283
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:04,536
<i>If he is unable to return...</i>

1284
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:08,915
<i>... John Lawrence will win by default.</i>

1285
01:56:13,837 --> 01:56:15,672
I'll inform the judges.

1286
01:56:17,007 --> 01:56:18,759
You did well out there, young man.

1287
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,723
Damn it!

1288
01:56:24,848 --> 01:56:27,017
Honey, forget it.

1289
01:56:27,142 --> 01:56:29,353
You were great.

1290
01:56:29,853 --> 01:56:31,939
I couldn't be prouder.

1291
01:56:32,397 --> 01:56:34,149
It was just bad luck.

1292
01:56:34,232 --> 01:56:37,027
You would have won
if they hadn't cheated.

1293
01:56:37,152 --> 01:56:39,488
Just leave me alone for a minute.

1294
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:41,073
We'll be outside.

1295
01:56:46,286 --> 01:56:47,955
Mr. Miyagi...

1296
01:56:50,582 --> 01:56:52,834
...you think I had a chance of winning?

1297
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,544
Win, lose, no matter.

1298
01:56:54,628 --> 01:56:56,546
That's not what I mean.

1299
01:57:01,343 --> 01:57:03,345
Had good chance.

1300
01:57:04,304 --> 01:57:07,224
Can you fix my leg with that thing you do?

1301
01:57:07,474 --> 01:57:09,768
No need fight anymore.

1302
01:57:09,935 --> 01:57:13,397
- You proved a point.
- What, that I can take a beating?

1303
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:17,401
Every time I see those guys,
they'll know they got the best of me.

1304
01:57:19,152 --> 01:57:23,615
I'll never have balance that way,
not with them, not with Ali...

1305
01:57:27,286 --> 01:57:28,704
...not with me.

1306
01:57:33,375 --> 01:57:34,418
What?

1307
01:57:37,421 --> 01:57:38,797
Close eye.

1308
01:57:59,151 --> 01:58:04,364
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the moment we've been waiting for.</i>

1309
01:58:07,451 --> 01:58:09,828
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight?</i>

1310
01:58:10,078 --> 01:58:12,664
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight!</i>

1311
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:17,085
<i>This is what it's all about, folks.
You know it.</i>

1312
01:58:18,086 --> 01:58:19,921
<i>How's the leg, son?</i>

1313
01:58:22,007 --> 01:58:24,259
<i>All right. What a man!</i>

1314
01:58:24,676 --> 01:58:27,012
<i>The final match to determine...</i>

1315
01:58:27,095 --> 01:58:30,098
<i>... who'll emerge victor and champion...</i>

1316
01:58:30,223 --> 01:58:34,519
<i>... of the All Valley Under-18
Karate Championship.</i>

1317
01:58:34,686 --> 01:58:37,856
<i>Daniel LaRusso, Miyaji-do Karate...</i>

1318
01:58:38,565 --> 01:58:40,442
<i>Miyagi-do.</i>

1319
01:58:40,567 --> 01:58:42,861
<i>Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

1320
01:58:43,028 --> 01:58:46,281
<i>... versus John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

1321
01:58:46,365 --> 01:58:49,368
<i>Three points wins. Good luck, boys.</i>

1322
01:58:50,035 --> 01:58:52,829
Come on, Daniel!
You've got this guy. You can do it.

1323
01:58:59,962 --> 01:59:01,755
Face me. Bow.

1324
01:59:01,922 --> 01:59:05,217
Face off. Bow. Ready?

1325
01:59:14,851 --> 01:59:16,061
That's okay, Johnny.

1326
01:59:16,144 --> 01:59:17,813
Lawrence, return.

1327
01:59:19,273 --> 01:59:21,108
One point, LaRusso.

1328
01:59:21,191 --> 01:59:22,484
You're dead.

1329
01:59:29,116 --> 01:59:30,617
Daniel, you've got him!

1330
01:59:37,374 --> 01:59:40,294
<i>Point! Jab! That's two for LaRusso.</i>

1331
01:59:41,169 --> 01:59:44,214
<i>Time out. Go to your sensei.</i>

1332
01:59:44,339 --> 01:59:46,008
Turn, kneel.

1333
01:59:46,133 --> 01:59:48,510
Johnny, you're a creampuff!

1334
01:59:49,636 --> 01:59:50,846
Sweep the leg.

1335
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:55,350
You have a problem with that?

1336
01:59:57,436 --> 01:59:58,729
<i>No, Sensei.</i>

1337
02:00:00,772 --> 02:00:02,149
No mercy.

1338
02:00:10,949 --> 02:00:12,367
One more!

1339
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:16,121
Two points LaRusso. Lawrence nothing.

1340
02:00:24,087 --> 02:00:27,758
<i>One point Lawrence. 2-1, LaRusso.</i>

1341
02:00:48,695 --> 02:00:52,240
Kick to the side. One point Lawrence. 2-2.

1342
02:00:59,998 --> 02:01:02,250
Out of bounds. Come back in.

1343
02:01:04,378 --> 02:01:05,921
Destroy him, Johnny!

1344
02:01:06,004 --> 02:01:08,298
Come on, Daniel, you can do it!

1345
02:01:29,736 --> 02:01:32,739
Come on, Daniel. Be strong.

1346
02:01:35,033 --> 02:01:36,827
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1347
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:40,622
<i>Whoever wins the next point
will be our new champion.</i>

1348
02:01:45,419 --> 02:01:47,129
Finish him, Johnny!

1349
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:58,557
It's over, Johnny! You did it!

1350
02:02:01,977 --> 02:02:03,937
Are you okay? Can you go on?

1351
02:02:04,062 --> 02:02:07,274
Get him a body bag!

1352
02:02:09,776 --> 02:02:12,487
Warning for illegal contact to the knee.

1353
02:02:18,035 --> 02:02:19,911
Finish him!

1354
02:02:28,879 --> 02:02:30,422
Winner!

1355
02:02:40,515 --> 02:02:43,185
<i>The new champion!</i>

1356
02:02:44,394 --> 02:02:47,814
- You're all right, LaRusso.
- Thanks a lot.

1357
02:02:52,694 --> 02:02:56,114
Mr. Miyagi, we did it. All right!
