00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,176
<i>Hey, wooly bully</i>

<i>Watch it now, watch it</i>

<i>Here it comes

<i>Watch it now
He gets you</i>

6
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,613
<i>Matty told Hatty</i>

7
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:56,699
<i>About a thing she saw</i>

8
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,119
<i>It had two big horns</i>

9
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,122
<i>And a wooly jaw</i>

10
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:05,458
<i>Wooly bully</i>

11
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,670
<i>Wooly bully
That's right</i>

12
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:13,049
<i>Wooly bully, Wooly bully</i>

13
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,967
<i>Wooly bully</i>

14
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,889
<i>Hatty told Matty</i>

<i>Let's not be L seven</i>

<i>Come and learn to dance</i>

18
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,275
<i>Wooly bully</i>

19
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,903
<i>Wooly bully</i>

<i>Here it comes

27
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:36,632
<i>Matty told Hatty</i>

<i>About a thing she saw...</i>

29
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,513
- Freddie!
-I dropped something.

30
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:44,307
Ralph, talk to him.

31
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,226
Listen to your father.

32
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,687
Come on.
From there we can see Cape Cod.

33
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:50,813
We were just on Cape Cod.

34
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,733
We could have stayed there.
I would've saved $12.

35
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,903
Allen, don't you want to see Cape Cod?

36
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:01,908
All right, darling. You know
where we are if you change your mind.

37
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:20,927
Allen!

38
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:28,100
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:57,338
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

40
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:01,592
You okay, Allen? Lend me a towel.
A towel. Thanks.

41
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,427
Why did you do that?

42
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,860
Come on, son.

43
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:42,300
<i>Augie, pick up line four, please.</i>

44
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:50,391
Where are my cherries?

45
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:52,018
Mr. McCullough, they came in,

46
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,270
but there was a fog upstate
and the highway...

47
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:55,646
Where are my cherries?

48
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,315
If I don't have my cherries
in five minutes,

49
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,942
you don't get your money
and you starve and you die.

50
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,028
Jerry?

51
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,324
Jerry, where the hell
are McCullough's cherries?

52
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,076
They're here, but you gotta take a look
at this stuff.

53
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,747
Ah, Mr. McCullough, be right back.

54
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,207
Where are my cherries?

55
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,837
Augie, where the hell did you grow
these things? Under your arms?

56
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,381
Jesus, snails with stems.
Forget it. Get them outta here!

57
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:24,717
- George, get them out of here.
-You got it.

58
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,722
Bauer. Thank you. Honey, what's up?

59
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:32,850
We get a lot of rain
and the cherries get a little slime.

60
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:35,937
- I can't hear you.
-You agreed to take these off our hands.

61
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,065
- When the hell did I agree to that?
-Not you, your brother.

62
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,692
Ah, all right.

63
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,653
Victoria, I can't hear you.

64
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:46,155
What I'm doing is important, too.
I'll call you right back.

65
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,449
My brother bought your slimy cherries?

66
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:50,785
Yeah. Me and Freddie.
We were playing poker.

67
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,787
He had two pair. I had a flush.

68
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,998
He had no cash, so we worked this out.

69
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,801
Who put this goddamn fruit here?

70
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,553
I'm all right, if anyone's concerned.

71
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:11,097
Good morning, Freddie.

72
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:13,933
Allen! Allen!

73
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:16,060
- I want a simple "yes" or "no."
-One more second, Mr. McCullough.

74
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:20,398
I made it. I'm in Penthouse magazine.
They printed my letter!

75
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:23,234
- They printed my letter.
-Listen, I'm very happy.

76
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,027
I'm in the Forum section.

77
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,947
The story's entitled
<i>A</i> Lesbian No More.

78
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:30,324
They printed every word I wrote.
It's a beautiful story.

79
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:31,867
Here. I want copies for everybody.

80
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:34,745
Augie, good to see you!

81
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:36,539
Great game. We gotta do that more.

82
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,874
- Freddie, can we talk?
-Great poker player.

83
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,211
- Cheats like a son of a bitch!
-Freddie, you and I have to talk.

84
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,505
Missing petty cash?
It was the cleaning girl.

85
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:45,840
I don't care about that.

86
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,008
- You don't?
-No.

87
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,342
Then it was me. I admit the whole thing.

88
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:50,469
Well, I still don't care about it, Freddie.

89
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:53,222
I love this guy! Do you hear me?
I love him.

90
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:54,807
- Gimme a kiss.
-Oh, Freddie.

91
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,891
Give your older brother a kiss.

92
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:57,935
What's the matter? You're too big to...

93
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,399
I love this guy's head.

94
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:06,027
Curly, here's a buck. Wash my car.

95
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:09,613
Bauer! Where are my...

96
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,532
McCullough, your cherries, yes.

97
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,658
Believe me when I tell you this.

98
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:14,827
You're not gonna be satisfied
with what we have for you.

99
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:18,247
Okay, Bauer. You're ruined!
Everyone's gonna know you left me dry.

100
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,374
You're finished,
you're a ghost in this business.

101
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,586
- How'd you like bananas at cost?
-Deal!

102
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,422
Jerry, set up our friend,
Mr. McCullough, bananas at cost.

103
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,550
Allen, wait. I've got to get out early.

104
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,053
Gee, right. Today's the big day.

105
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:34,430
Don't forget.
Ushers have to be early, too.

106
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,682
-I'll be there.
-Okay.

107
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:42,396
<i>Will someone
get those Jonathans off the truck?</i>

108
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,192
Any messages, Mrs. Stimler?

109
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,235
Yes.

110
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:53,866
What are they?

111
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:56,577
Huh? Oh...

112
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,207
Your father called.
He wants you to call him back.

113
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:06,128
Mrs. Stimler,
our father passed away five years ago.

114
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:07,338
Remember?

115
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:09,215
Right.

116
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:12,093
Should I get him for you?

117
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,805
No, no. We'll... I'll take care of it.

118
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:17,765
You just get back to work.

119
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:27,441
What's with her?

120
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,068
A little accident over the weekend.

121
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:31,153
Got hit in the head by some lightning.

122
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:35,574
It's not funny, Freddie! It's not funny.

123
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,577
I'm sorry. That's not funny.
That's not funny.

124
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:42,164
Besides, she can still do certain things
around the office.

125
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,083
Like jump-start a car?

126
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,587
Jump-start a car!

127
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,131
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

128
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:52,133
What the hell are you doing down here?

129
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,010
Maybe I went to the "Club A" last night.

130
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:56,428
Something new for you.

131
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:59,849
Maybe I met Mr. Buyrite,
owner of Buyrite Supermarkets.

132
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,434
Maybe we had a few drinks.

133
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:07,606
And maybe, just maybe,
we're his new produce suppliers.

134
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,861
I'm proud of you.
That's great! Which store?

135
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:15,114
Not which store, the whole chain.

136
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:18,909
I hope you are joking with me right now.

137
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,452
Think big, be big, my friend.

138
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,954
He was a green beret colonel.

139
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:23,789
I made up a story about you
being wounded in Nam

140
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:25,124
and he wants to do business.

141
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,376
Now he's coming this morning
to check out the operation.

142
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,796
This morning? Great, Freddie.
It's only chaos down here.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,715
Augie brings me slimy cherries
from upstate.

144
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,383
So what? So what?

145
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,968
Jerry's getting married tomorrow.

146
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,636
- So what?
-Did you realize that?

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,722
I was out drinking with this burn
all night long.

148
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,307
- I have to pick up my tuxedo.
-l'm busting my buns.

149
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,058
All the way up on East 77th Street.

150
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:45,519
Come on, you can handle this deal.
Come on, relax.

151
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:46,854
Yeah, I'll handle it fine.

152
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:49,773
Your desk looks like a pigsty.
Do what I do...

153
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,400
I have a system on the desk.

154
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:52,902
--Phone for you.

155
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:56,822
Yes? All right. Thank you.

156
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:58,991
Hi, Victoria. I'm sorry.

157
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,160
I meant to call you back. I forgot.

158
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:03,412
What's the matter?
Your voice sounds funny.

159
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,290
What? Now?

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,710
You're moving out
of the apartment now?

161
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:11,503
While we're talking on the phone.

162
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:15,966
Yeah, I know we were
going to talk about it.

163
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,387
Victoria, this is a little impulsive,
don't you think?

164
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:23,182
If we were married,
you wouldn't just move out like this.

165
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,684
- She might do that. Sure.
-Will you get off!

166
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:27,853
- Was that you?
-Get off the phone!

167
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,439
-I'm so sorry!
-No, no, no. Not you, Victoria.

168
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:33,234
I didn't know you were on the phone.

169
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:36,946
What do you mean, do I love you?

170
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:40,866
Well, I...

171
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:45,579
Well, we met and...

172
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,208
You moved in, didn't you?

173
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:55,756
Well, it's just a very complicated thing.

174
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,384
Hey, do you love me?

175
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,886
Well, there you go.

176
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:07,977
There she went.

177
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:13,065
What a huge wedding.

178
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:20,239
Cindy, hi.

179
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:24,076
- How are you?
-How are you?

180
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:26,954
Excuse me.

181
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,622
You look so pretty!

182
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:36,005
Darn! My flash never works!

183
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:39,133
Figures.
My mother-in-law gave it to me.

184
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,428
Get up!

185
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,930
What? What?

186
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:47,516
It was embarrassing
when you were 10, Freddie.

187
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:50,227
Look, if something works for me,
I stick with it!

188
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,062
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

189
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,690
I got to get more involved with business,
and I intend to.

190
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:58,360
I mean that this time. I'm going to.
I know the business.

191
00:11:58,444 --> 00:12:00,404
I was there at the beginning with Dad,
remember?

192
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:05,367
I just wanna know if we sell
fruit and vegetables, or is it just fruit?

193
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,455
By the time I came home,
she was already gone.

194
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,956
- Victoria left, huh?
-Yeah.

195
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:13,667
You know why she left me, Freddie?

196
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:15,961
Because I didn't love her.

197
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:17,379
That bitch.

198
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:22,217
Hi. Anywhere but the first three rows.

199
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:25,429
- Anywhere but the first three rows.
-Hey!

200
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,349
Hi, Freddie.
Hey, Allen, where's Victoria?

201
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:31,310
She's sick, and she can't make it.

202
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:33,228
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

203
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,567
Why I didn't love her, Freddie?
Can you answer me that?

204
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,778
Why I didn't love her?
I mean, she had everything.

205
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,782
She was bright, she was sensitive,
she was beautiful.

206
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,201
- Hey, Allen!
-Hi.

207
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:48,369
Where's Victoria?

208
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,621
Flu. Bad flu. She's very sick.

209
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,456
And she can't make it
because of the flu.

210
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:54,833
- Give her my love.
-You bet! Sure.

211
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,212
I can't even give her my love, Freddie.

212
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,049
I'm telling you.
Something in here is networking.

213
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,385
There are worse organs
not to be working. Ha!

214
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,055
Hi, guys. Bauer,
where's that pretty lady of yours?

215
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,765
She's not coming! Okay?

216
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,558
What? Do you want your money back?

217
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:17,731
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's all for the best.

218
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:19,441
- Hey, Allen.
-She left me!

219
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:21,777
She moved out.
My life's a shambles, okay?

220
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,404
That's the news. You want the weather?

221
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,406
Anywhere but the first three rows!

222
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,202
You should really lighten up on the guy.
That's the bride's brother.

223
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,457
You see, drinking is really a matter
of algebraic ratios.

224
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,962
How drunk you get depends on
how much alcohol you consume

225
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,964
in relation to your total body weight.

226
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:44,883
You see my point?
It's not that you had a lot to drink,

227
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,135
it's just that you're too skinny.

228
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:50,389
- Marceau, more drinks here, please.
-No.

229
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,766
Freddie, I don't want to get drunk.

230
00:13:52,891 --> 00:13:54,476
But you are drunk.

231
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,895
You see, a sober person
would have reached for the pretzels.

232
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,023
- Is he going to be there long?
-I don't know.

233
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,734
- Oh, I'm on the bar.
-You're on the bar.

234
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:04,862
Come on, off the bar.

235
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:08,073
This stool is in your way.
Let me move that for you.

236
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,659
Oh, oh, you fell.

237
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:15,038
That hurt.
You're not having a good day, are you?

238
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,207
Wasn't that a beautiful
wedding ceremony?

239
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,333
That was a beautiful ceremony.

240
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,420
It was. It really was.

241
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:23,881
- The most gorgeous ceremony...
-A lovely...

242
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:30,345
- How are you doing?
-Fine.

243
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:31,763
The fabulous Freddie Bauer here.

244
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:33,849
Where did you get those?

245
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:35,851
My grandmother. She left them to me.

246
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:38,312
She did? They're beautiful.

247
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,771
Thank you.

248
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,191
Hi.

249
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:43,775
- Hi.
-Hi.

250
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:45,944
You guys are in love, aren't you?

251
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:47,863
We just met.

252
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:52,034
That doesn't matter.
I know about these things.

253
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,119
I can see. I can tell.

254
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:58,999
You two guys, you're in love.
And I think that's beautiful.

255
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,293
Thanks.

256
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:06,882
Listen. I don't live too far from here.

257
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:10,052
Why don't we just go to my place
for a quiet drink?

258
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,972
Do I expect too much out of life?

259
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:17,184
My dress! I can't believe this.

260
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:19,853
- I'm sorry.
-Hey, what are you doing?

261
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:23,398
Both of you. You're both crazy!

262
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:24,983
I'm sorry. Look...

263
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,819
I don't ask that much, do I?

264
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:30,072
I don't ask to be famous,
I don't ask to be rich,

265
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:33,867
I don't ask to play center field
for the New York Yankees or anything.

266
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:36,203
I just want to meet a woman.
I wanna meet a woman.

267
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:39,081
And I wanna fall in love,
and I wanna get married.

268
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:40,165
And I want to have a kid,

269
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:43,168
and I want to go see him play a tooth
in the school play.

270
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:46,421
It's not much.

271
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,341
But I'm kidding myself.

272
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:50,842
It's never going to happen.

273
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,471
I'm going to grow old,

274
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,182
and grow lonely, and I'm gonna die,

275
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,519
and I'll be surrounded
by a bunch of rotten fruit.

276
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:05,357
- Freddie?
-No kidding!

277
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,318
Freddie?

278
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,781
Allen! I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

279
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,783
This is Tawny, and this is Jill.

280
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,327
-I'm Tawny.
-You're Tawny, Tawny Tiger!

281
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:19,288
And this is Jill, a four-letter word.

282
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,456
- This is my brother, Allen.
-Hi.

283
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:24,459
- Freddie, can I talk to you?
-Absolutely.

284
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,169
- Excuse me.
-Sure.

285
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,422
I'll be right back.
We'll whisper some more.

286
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,340
I've got some whispering for you!

287
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:33,552
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

288
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:36,305
Pack your bags.
Tonight, my man, we're going to Rio!

289
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,640
These girls have got
a time-sharing condominium.

290
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:40,100
We're gonna share some time
with them.

291
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:43,645
No, Freddie, I'm going to Cape Cod.

292
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,148
What are you talking about?
Cape Cod?

293
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,858
Why would you go to Cape Cod?

294
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,569
I don't know.
Because I like Cape Cod, Freddie.

295
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:51,945
I feel better up there.

296
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,157
I look at the water
and I feel closer to something.

297
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,827
- Cape Cod over Rio? Are you all right?
-Yeah.

298
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,747
- Let me drive you up there.
-No, no.

299
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,041
- You got enough money?
-I've got plenty.

300
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,084
- Yeah?
-Thanks.

301
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:08,754
Can I have some then?

302
00:17:19,014 --> 00:17:21,725
- Where to?
-Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

303
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,438
You break that, you pay for it.

304
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:31,860
Well, I'm sorry. I usually enjoy
smashing the glass with my face.

305
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:35,906
Okay. Cape Cod. That's about
300 miles. You got the cash?

306
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,908
What is this?

307
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,223
Careful With that.

308
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,642
Be careful with that!

309
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:07,396
What do you think you're loading?
This is delicate scientific equipment.

310
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:14,569
Hold it. Put it down. You see that?
It says, "This end up."

311
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:17,197
Know what that means? This end up!

312
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,449
Why don't you try holding that end up?

313
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,286
All right, get away!

314
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,164
I'll do it myself. Get away.
Give me a hand.

315
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,921
Easy.

316
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,174
- Move that...
-Excuse me.

317
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,679
- Morning.
-Morning.

318
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:46,143
Ah, I was dropped off on
the wrong side of the beach.

319
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:48,729
Could you take me over to the island?

320
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:52,190
Well, ah, we're not...

321
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,192
We're not going...

322
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:57,446
We're taking the boat.
We're not going out there!

323
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,866
Have you seen anyone else
along this beach?

324
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:03,744
No, just me and the moron twins.

325
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,829
We're not twins.

326
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,334
- What is all this stuff?
-I knew it!

327
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,464
Who sent you up here?
Dr. Ross from Chicago?

328
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:17,924
Who's Dr. Ross from Chicago?

329
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,344
Who's Dr. Ross? You're very good.

330
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,722
I suppose you're some
harmless beachcomber

331
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,974
who happens to wear a tuxedo!

332
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:29,186
How dare you try and horn in
on someone else's research!

333
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:30,771
I'm just a guy..-

334
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:33,607
Walter Kornbluth is not
to be taken advantage of.

335
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,110
Just stay out of my way, sonny.

336
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,865
All right, let's move out!

337
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:51,333
A guy down the beach
runs people out to the island.

338
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,959
What's the name?

339
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:55,796
The guy or the island?

340
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,424
I'll find him.

341
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:05,263
What's the matter? You look nervous.

342
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:10,393
Yeah. The truth is, Fat Jack,
I don't know how to swim.

343
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:13,230
- You can't swim?
-No, sir.

344
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,274
Then you wouldn't want me to do this.

345
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,902
Stop! Ah, don't!

346
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:22,823
Please, cut it out!
There's water coming in the boat!

347
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm just having a little fun.

348
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:26,743
Well, don't.

349
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,623
What is that? What's the matter?

350
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,126
When I rocked the boat,
I must have got water in the engine.

351
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:38,129
I can fix it. I'm mechanical.

352
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,555
Did you fix it?

353
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:49,808
No. I'll go back for the other boat.

354
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:50,976
What?

355
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,606
Where are you going, Mr. Fat Jack?

356
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:59,776
Back to the dock. It's only a few miles.

357
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:03,029
I can swim it.
I'll be back with the little boat.

358
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:06,116
The little boat?

359
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,882
I knew it.
I knew that guy was spying on me.

360
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:24,259
I want to go down!

361
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,180
Mr. Corn beef?

362
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:31,558
Kornbluth!

363
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,477
Whatcha looking for down there?

364
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:36,187
Buried treasure?

365
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:38,857
Want to know what I'm looking for?

366
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:40,358
I'll tell you.

367
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:45,071
None of your goddamn business,
that's what!

368
00:21:45,155 --> 00:21:46,573
Get out of my way!

369
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,123
Let's pee down his air hose.

370
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,043
You get that.

371
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,562
Piece of shit.

372
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:32,869
Ahh!

373
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:46,424
Ah, gee.

374
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,207
Ohhh!

375
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:23,962
Ohh.

376
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:32,971
Ouch!

377
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,557
Ouch.

378
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,496
Hello.

379
00:23:59,164 --> 00:24:02,250
You have any idea how I got here?

380
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:04,169
Did you save me?

381
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:13,344
Ah, do you speak English?

382
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:54,761
Hey! Come back!

383
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:56,971
Hey, come back! Please.

384
00:24:57,138 --> 00:24:59,516
Just tell me who you are.

385
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:03,269
I've gotta talk to you.
Can I call you? What's your number?

386
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:05,063
I don't know how to swim.

387
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:09,025
I don't know how to swim! Come back.

388
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,904
Why didn't I learn how to swim?
Please, just...

389
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:19,137
It's a mermaid. It's her!

390
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:24,058
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute! Don't go.

391
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:26,895
Come back.

392
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,147
I gotta take your picture.

393
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:32,859
Hold it.

394
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:18,089
Hi, Mrs. Stimler.

395
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,384
Hi. What happened to your head?

396
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,178
- Lightning?
-No, a boat hit me.

397
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,433
- Mrs. Stimler?
-Yes?

398
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:32,312
- Nothing.
-So nice to have you back.

399
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:37,358
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.

400
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:39,736
The statue is a gift
from French citizens.

401
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:43,156
It has come to symbolize hope
for oppressed people.

402
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:47,660
Over the past century,
she has seen the skyline,

403
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:52,040
which once she dwarfed,
rise in mountains of stone and steel.

404
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,127
If you'll go inside, the tour will continue.

405
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:59,964
Come on. Here we go.
Let's go. We're backing up.

406
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:03,885
You've got feet, use them!

407
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:08,806
Don't touch my hat.
Do not ever touch my hat. That's it.

408
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,476
UP, UP, up, up, up, up. Okay.

409
00:29:12,226 --> 00:29:13,978
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.

410
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:16,689
The statue is a gift
from French citizens.

411
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:20,109
It has come to symbolize hope
for naked women everywhere.

412
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:22,445
Bocci balls!

413
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,822
--Hey, hey.

414
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,241
Come on. Don't be doing that.

415
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:32,163
Take a picture of me, Vinnie.
Vinnie, take my picture.

416
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,540
You get it? You get it!

417
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:41,005
The statue was a gift
from French people.

418
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,132
Get out of the way. What's going on?

419
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:48,554
Okay, miss. This ain't California.
We don't go for this.

420
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:07,782
What's your name?

421
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,409
She don't speak no English.

422
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:10,451
And you do?

423
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,578
Here. She was carrying this.

424
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:13,830
What's this?

425
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,459
Who's this guy?

426
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:23,297
Is that enough?
Do you want some more?

427
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:26,592
That's all we can handle.
Let's talk terms.

428
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:28,511
He doesn't have the slightest clue
what's going on.

429
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,222
Don't worry.
We'll move it out in the morning.

430
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:35,393
Bauer. Your brother told me about
your unfortunate experience in Vietnam.

431
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,438
Huh?

432
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:41,649
The incident in Vietnam. Remember?

433
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:47,238
The grenade still bother you?
You're wearing a bandage.

434
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,699
Page him. Hey, Al?

435
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:51,075
- Yeah?
-Phone.

436
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,911
Um, excuse me.

437
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:57,623
Thanks, Jerry. Yeah?

438
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,293
Allen Bauer. Speaking.

439
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:08,301
Yeah. On my way!

440
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:09,927
I believe this...

441
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,640
Allen, where are you going?

442
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,267
Allen!

443
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:20,605
- What happened?
-Telephone.

444
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,649
He was on the phone in Nam
when the grenade went off.

445
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:29,030
Ever since then, he runs,
gets in a car, and drives away.

446
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:33,117
- Oh.
-I don't know why. It just happens.

447
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,953
- Oh.
-Let's review this.

448
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:00,186
Pardon me. Excuse me!

449
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:02,897
--Mr. Police Officer?

450
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,982
Hey! Take it easy.

451
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:06,400
What do you want?

452
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:09,362
My name's Allen Bauer.
You guys called me.

453
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:12,907
Any of you guys call for an Allen Bauer?

454
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:16,327
Bauer. Yeah. That's for her.

455
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:18,746
Right over there.

456
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:42,562
Hi.

457
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,613
I take it you know this girl?

458
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,616
Yeah, I do.

459
00:32:56,993 --> 00:32:58,119
Who is she?

460
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:01,706
I don't know.

461
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,207
Of course.

462
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:19,390
Afternoon. You're home early.

463
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:20,933
Yeah.

464
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:32,528
Uh, that doorway spins.

465
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,155
Want to get this fixed, Timmy?

466
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:42,622

00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:53,484
so I got you a choice.
Fruity Pebbles, pancakes...

474
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:55,903
No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I've got to get back to work.
That will keep you company.

476
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:03,953
When I come back from work,
we'll get some dinner,

and pick you up some clothes.

478

You're gonna put me in the hospital.

482
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:22,471
It's about 3:00. I really have to get back.

Things don't get started again

Let's not be so choosy
with these onions.

487
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,621

You check them.
You know the business.

501
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:22,907
- So I'm in charge?
-Sure.

502
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,950
What about the lawyer's meeting
at 8:00?

503
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:28,412
8:00 p.m.? That's too late for me.

504
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:31,832
I'm going upstairs and take a nap.

00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:33,704
What happened?
You saw <i>Annie</i> Hall 100 times?

520
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,706
That look is over.

521
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:38,542
You want to try that on?

522
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:40,210
Who knows? Maybe it's you.

523
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:42,838
I couldn't get one leg in there.

524
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:47,176
My daughter is lucky. She's anorexic.

525
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:53,974
Please call again. Don't forget these.

526
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:58,896
Do yourself a favor
and stop in the lingerie department.

527
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:02,900
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't wear boxer shorts.

528
00:39:10,032 --> 00:39:11,909
Let me try!

529
00:39:12,326 --> 00:39:14,578

Zip-a-dee-doo-dah

545
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:06,797
Hello?

546
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:10,467
I'm home!

547
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:30,362
-I'm looking for a girl, Timmy.
-200 bucks.

548
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:33,073
No, the blonde I came in with.

549
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:35,909
- Oh, she left.
-Any idea where?

550
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:39,163
- I put her in a cab.
-To where, Timmy?

551
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,623
- Bloomingdale's.
-Bloomingdale's. Great. Thanks.

552
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:44,626
Yo! Hey, taxi! Hey!

553
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:46,837
Halt, taxi, please!

554
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:49,256
<i>She works hard for the money</i>

555
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:52,509
<i>Come on, come on. Let's go!</i>

556
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:56,513
<i>She works hard for the money
so you better treat her right</i>

557
00:40:57,514 --> 00:41:00,100
Excuse me, miss,
we're getting ready to close.

558
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:02,519
She's been here for six hours.

559
00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:07,066
Excuse me, miss.

560
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:12,571
I'm going to insist
that you stop doing that.

561
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,869
She's exercising.

562
00:41:20,788 --> 00:41:23,040
Give her a minute.

563
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,668
Sir, we're closing.

564
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:27,836
I know. Just give me three minutes.

565
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,714
- Come back.
-Three minutes. You can time me!

566
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,469
Oh, thank God.

567
00:41:36,095 --> 00:41:38,222
Excuse me. Do you know this woman?

568
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:41,141
Yeah. Just don't ask me her name.

569
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,685
We've been trying to tell her
it's closing time,

570
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,896
but she doesn't seem to understand.

571
00:41:46,563 --> 00:41:48,774
That's because
she doesn't speak English.

572
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:51,819
Hello, Allen. How was your day?

573
00:41:53,904 --> 00:41:58,242
I never went to college,
but wasn't that English?

574
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,828
Thank you for letting me
use your television.

575
00:42:00,911 --> 00:42:03,455
It was very educational.

576
00:42:04,915 --> 00:42:06,333
It's all right, miss.

577
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:11,421
What's your name?

578
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:14,133
It's hard to say in English.

579
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,885
Well, just say it in your language.

580
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:20,264
All right. My name is...

581
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,281
Hey, how 'bout those Knicks?

582
00:42:38,615 --> 00:42:42,619
I'm confused why you haven't
said anything until now.

583
00:42:42,786 --> 00:42:43,954
I didn't know English.

584
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,998
I see. Now you do?

585
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:48,750
I learned from television. It's wonderful!

586
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:51,420
I'll ask questions
and if you answer correctly,

587
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,380
you can win one of these prizes.

588
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,841
A wall clock,
matching washer and dryer,

589
00:42:55,924 --> 00:42:58,135
or a brand-new car!

590
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,053
Let me go first, okay?

591
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,472
Who are you? Where are you from?

592
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:06,935
Begin when you were born
and finish when you blew up the TVs.

593
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:16,153
Pretty.

594
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:21,658
Well, yeah.
I've never thought about it before.

595
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:24,119
Are you from Cape Cod?

596
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,333
No, I'm from another place.

597
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:32,711
Yeah? I've got a cousin from there.
Ha-ha-ha.

598
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:38,050
Are you an American?

599
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:39,968
No.

600
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:44,514
Then why were you in
Cape Cod and now New York?

601
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:46,850
How did the cops find you naked?

602
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,352
What's that?

603
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:50,520
What? The music?

604
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:53,690
I like music!
I heard some in the television,

605
00:43:53,774 --> 00:43:55,108
<i>Dance Fever.</i>

606
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,820
<i>Hey, I love you, girl</i>

607
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:00,656
<i>Darling</i>

608
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,741
Ah, hi, hi.

609
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:05,077
We better go, hon, or else we'll be late.

610
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:06,995
You never heard music?

611
00:44:07,162 --> 00:44:08,538
What's that?

612
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:11,375
- Ah...

613
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,460
--Oh, gosh!

614
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:14,670
What's that?

615
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:15,796
It's a movie theater.

616
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:17,839
What the hell you doin'?
You could've got me killed!

617
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:20,342
Cut her some slack.
She's from out of town.

618
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:21,718
Keep her on a leash.

619
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:23,804
Yeah, yeah. Have a nice day.

620
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:25,138
Hello?

621
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:30,686
Did you see this?

622
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:34,064
It's wonderfully delicious
and so good for you.

623
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:38,235
While you're here, watch a little less TV.

624
00:44:40,112 --> 00:44:43,699
How long are you going to be in town?

625
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:47,077
Six fun-filled days.

626
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:49,413
Oh, six days.

627
00:44:49,913 --> 00:44:51,164
Is that all?

628
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,835
Six days,

629
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,087
and the moon is full.

630
00:44:58,297 --> 00:44:59,673
Oh.

631
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:03,802
The moon is full.

632
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:13,103
If I stay longer than that,
I can't ever go back.

633
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:15,605
Oh, I get... What?

634
00:45:15,939 --> 00:45:18,400
Is there some sort of
immigration problem?

635
00:45:19,276 --> 00:45:20,777
Where did you get that?

636
00:45:21,236 --> 00:45:23,196
Where? Oh, for...

637
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:29,745
Sir? Here you are, sir. There you go.

638
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:33,373
I'm going to have to call you something
in English,

639
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:36,209
because I can't pronounce... What?

640
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:37,961
What are English names?

641
00:45:38,628 --> 00:45:40,672
There's millions of them, I guess.

642
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:42,883
Jennifer, Joanie, Hillary.

643
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:44,634
Careful. Those are hot.

644
00:45:45,302 --> 00:45:47,596
Names, names. Linda, Kim...

645
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,973
Where are we? Madison.

646
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:52,392
- Elizabeth, Samantha...
-I like Madison.

647
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:54,686
Madison's not a name.

648
00:45:56,646 --> 00:45:59,483
Well, all right. Madison it is.

649
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:01,818
Good thing we weren't at 149th Street.

650
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:04,404
Are we going back to where you live?

651
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:08,325
Okay, um, here's the thing.

652
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,328
I was going to find you a hotel,

653
00:46:12,162 --> 00:46:14,539
but I figure that after this afternoon...

654
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:18,502
Well, I just assumed that...

655
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:24,341
Would you mind staying with me?

656
00:46:26,468 --> 00:46:27,928
I want to stay with you.

657
00:46:28,595 --> 00:46:30,555
You're the reason I came here.

658
00:46:41,775 --> 00:46:43,527
Ah, that was a kiss.

659
00:46:44,528 --> 00:46:45,612
I know.

660
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:58,745
Madison?

661
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:10,382
- Madison?
-Allen?

662
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:13,510
Yeah, of course it's Allen.

663
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,262
What are you doing, sweetheart?

664
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,639
Taking a bath.

665
00:49:18,348 --> 00:49:20,934
Ooo, ooo. Can I come in?

666
00:49:22,352 --> 00:49:23,478
No!

667
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:27,190
What was that?

668
00:49:27,357 --> 00:49:28,900
Madison, are you all right?

669
00:49:29,025 --> 00:49:30,694
Everything's fine.

670
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:31,903
Then let me in.

671
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,823
I'll be right there. I'm just changing.

672
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:37,742
Enough! Open the door.
Something is wrong.

673
00:49:38,368 --> 00:49:40,453
Allen, can you make me
some pancakes?

674
00:49:40,537 --> 00:49:42,205
Make you some... Madison!

675
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:44,583
All right, Madison, this is getting scary.

676
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:47,002
Either open this door,
or I'll break it down!

677
00:49:47,961 --> 00:49:50,297
- No, Allen, please.
-All right, that's it!

678
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,382
- Allen, no!
-Ow.

679
00:50:04,185 --> 00:50:05,520
Hi.

680
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:09,524
Hi. Are you okay?

681
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:11,901
Yeah.

682
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:13,695
Why wouldn't you let me in?

683
00:50:15,488 --> 00:50:17,782
I was shy.

684
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:21,536
You were shy?

685
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,165
After the car, elevator, bedroom,

686
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:27,584
and top of the refrigerator,
you were shy?

687
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:31,463
I was shy.

688
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:34,215
She was shy.

689
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:07,332
Hey, B.B. Brain!

690
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:11,252
- Yeah?
-See this hose?

691
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:15,131
- It's so I can breathe.
-Uh-huh.

692
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:17,926
You want to get your chair off it?

693
00:51:18,635 --> 00:51:19,719
Huh?

694
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:31,064
<i>The Star Confidential?</i>

695
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:33,942
Yeah.

696
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,110
Why are you reading that?

697
00:51:35,694 --> 00:51:36,736
I don't know.

698
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:41,241
What possesses the uneducated
to purchase these?

699
00:51:41,825 --> 00:51:43,076
Interesting.

700
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:44,994
You're not helping yourself.

701
00:51:45,328 --> 00:51:48,331
You're not... This is not news.

702
00:51:48,957 --> 00:51:51,167
Give me this. You know what's in here?

703
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:54,838
Nothing. You have sex, perversion.

704
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,215
It's all fabrication. Look at this.

705
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:00,260
A naked woman at the Statue of Liberty.

706
00:52:02,804 --> 00:52:04,514
Where would they find a girl to do that?

707
00:52:10,186 --> 00:52:12,397
- Ow, my head!
-Let me see that.

708
00:52:21,197 --> 00:52:23,408
Take me back to shore. Now!

709
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:29,247
Hello.

710
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:35,962
Madison, what is it?

711
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:38,214
What happened?

712
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:42,802
It's the saddest thing I ever saw.

713
00:52:45,513 --> 00:52:46,931
<i>It's Bonanza.</i>

714
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:51,352
The man killed another man
and he died in the street.

715
00:52:52,645 --> 00:52:55,940
No, no. This is only TV.

716
00:52:56,149 --> 00:52:59,778
I thought you understood
about TV being make-believe.

717
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:03,072
It's pretend killing that's going on.
See, now.

718
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:05,033
This guy is an actor.

719
00:53:05,116 --> 00:53:07,368
Next week, he'll get shot
on another show.

720
00:53:08,077 --> 00:53:09,662
When you think about it,
it's kinda funny.

721
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,375
I'm supposed to laugh?

722
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:17,754
Yeah. There you go.

723
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:19,839
Yeah.

724
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:22,801
I got you something.

725
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:41,402
It's beautiful. I love it.

726
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:46,366
No, you open it.

727
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:48,409
There's more?

728
00:55:05,945 --> 00:55:07,030
Do you like that?

729
00:55:07,822 --> 00:55:09,115
Yeah, I do.

730
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:12,869
I don't know why. Just...

731
00:55:13,953 --> 00:55:15,455
Something about it.

732
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:17,248
It's always appealed to me.

733
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:21,210
Do you like the sea?

734
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:27,008
No. When I was about eight,
I had this accident on a ship.

735
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:28,718
I remember.

736
00:55:30,178 --> 00:55:31,387
What?

737
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:35,600
Ah, I can't. I forget the words.

738
00:55:35,725 --> 00:55:38,102
What's... I understand.

739
00:55:41,731 --> 00:55:43,942
Did you get hurt?

740
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:47,987
No, no, I didn't,

741
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:52,909
but when I was underwater,
I could have sworn I saw...

742
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:55,912
What?

743
00:55:57,246 --> 00:55:58,289
Nothing.

744
00:55:58,414 --> 00:55:59,624
- What?
-Nothing!

745
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:01,751
I was just a stupid kid.

746
00:56:05,964 --> 00:56:07,840
They're going to tear this park out.

747
00:56:08,049 --> 00:56:09,258
<i>Why'?</i>

748
00:56:09,592 --> 00:56:13,012
They're gonna build river-front condos
or some such nonsense.

749
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,431
What are you gonna do, huh?

750
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:21,604
You want to go home?

751
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,023
No, I have five days left!

752
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:26,859
No, no, no. My home!

753
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:28,486
Oh.

754
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:31,406
Yes.

755
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,794
Why do we want
to go to a political dinner?

756
00:56:44,877 --> 00:56:46,587
The president will be speaking.

757
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:48,047
President of what?

758
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:50,299
President of
the Three Stooges Fan Club.

759
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:52,385
- The president of the United States!
-Wow.

760
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:54,887
I tell you. We'll be rubbing elbows
with the big boys.

761
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:56,514
You think big, you be big.

762
00:56:56,597 --> 00:56:57,640
I guess so.

763
00:56:57,932 --> 00:56:59,308
Listen,

764
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:04,105
would you mind if I took Madison
to this thing instead of going with you?

765
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,193
What?

766
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,529
- What?
-What?

767
00:57:12,321 --> 00:57:14,449
Something in here networking?

768
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:18,453
"Oh, I'll never fall in love, Freddie.

769
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:21,330
"I can't. It won't work with me."

770
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:24,083
Who said anything
about me being in love?

771
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,169
You haven't been to work in two days.

772
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:28,087
- So?
-Admit it.

773
00:57:29,005 --> 00:57:30,339
- No.
-Admit it!

774
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,799
Eye gouge!

775
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,095
Ahhh. Ahhh!

776
00:57:36,512 --> 00:57:37,597
- Admit it.
-No.

777
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,015
Bone crusher!

778
00:57:46,105 --> 00:57:47,315
Son of a...

779
00:57:56,365 --> 00:57:57,408
Ow.

780
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:02,121
How long we been playing?

781
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:03,414
About five minutes.

782
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:04,874
Oh, God.

783
00:58:05,374 --> 00:58:07,126
My heart's beating like a rabbit.

784
00:58:08,669 --> 00:58:10,421
You, uh, want a beer?

785
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:12,715
No, thanks.

786
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:29,398
So, tell me this.

787
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:31,484
If you're not in love with her,

788
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:34,695
how come little things she does
drive you crazy so much?

789
00:58:35,238 --> 00:58:36,531
Little things?

790
00:58:36,864 --> 00:58:41,119
Freddie, the woman learned English
in a single afternoon.

791
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:45,540
She could probably
speak English already.

792
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,334
I think she was in shock
from being arrested, you know.

793
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,044
Now, what about that, huh?

794
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:53,256
What about a woman showing up
naked in a public place, Freddie?

795
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:54,966
I'm for it, of course.

796
00:58:56,259 --> 00:59:00,555
You said that she had
some kind of immigration problem.

797
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:04,433
She's on an ocean liner
in international waters.

798
00:59:04,684 --> 00:59:08,521
And she sees America. It looks good.

799
00:59:08,688 --> 00:59:12,191
So, she greases her body up
like a channel swimmer.

800
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:16,612
She dives in.
She has heavy trouble with sharks,

801
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:21,409
she goes through the Coast Guard,
minefields and then she's on shore.

802
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:23,077
She's okay. That's it.

803
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:27,373
What about the bathtub,

804
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:30,251
this moon stuff, and all those TVs?

805
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:32,378
Look, I'm being serious.

806
00:59:32,712 --> 00:59:37,550
I admit to a few minor fiascos
in my love life.

807
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:41,220
Freddie, you took a date
to one of your own weddings!

808
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:44,682
I'm a free spirit!

809
00:59:44,891 --> 00:59:48,186
I'm extremely liberal,
a freewheeling dude.

810
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:50,855
You know what your problem is?
You're in love with this girl.

811
00:59:50,938 --> 00:59:52,648
You're trying to convince yourself
you're not.

812
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:56,652
I just don't know, Freddie.

813
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:59,238
Something about it isn't right.

814
01:00:00,198 --> 01:00:01,449
I'll serve.

815
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,451
Hold the beer.
That will be your handicap.

816
01:00:03,576 --> 01:00:05,328
- Oh, we're gonna play?
-Yeah.

817
01:00:06,495 --> 01:00:08,331
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson in humility.

818
01:00:08,497 --> 01:00:09,582
Wait.

819
01:00:09,665 --> 01:00:10,958
Humility 101.

820
01:00:11,918 --> 01:00:13,753
- You all set?
-Yeah.

821
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:15,004
Here we go.

822
01:00:17,006 --> 01:00:18,049
Oh!

823
01:00:24,513 --> 01:00:27,099
This is what we came to hear?

824
01:00:30,686 --> 01:00:32,605
You call and tell us

825
01:00:32,688 --> 01:00:37,401
that you have stretched the frontiers
of paleontology and zoology.

826
01:00:38,027 --> 01:00:43,491
We interrupt important, serious work
to fly here at a moment's notice,

827
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:46,160
and you give us mermaids!

828
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:49,205
Don't call us.
Call the comic book companies.

829
01:00:49,288 --> 01:00:53,125
Enough. We have a seminar
in three weeks. Be ready.

830
01:00:59,382 --> 01:01:01,634
Allen, you're here! I got you a present.

831
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,887
- Don't look. Close your eyes.
-I gotta close the door.

832
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,973
What are you doing?

833
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,225
All right.

834
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,728
Okay. Look.

835
01:01:19,694 --> 01:01:22,905
Ha-ha! Wha... You, ah...

836
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:25,533
Well, that's big!

837
01:01:27,368 --> 01:01:29,203
Yeah, this is...

838
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:35,167
This is very big, and it's really here.

839
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,753
It's just so big!

840
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:39,880
They were gonna tear it down,
so I bought it for you.

841
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:43,092
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?

842
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:47,930
Madison, where's your necklace?

843
01:01:49,056 --> 01:01:50,599
I traded it for the statue.

844
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:51,934
<i>Why'?</i>

845
01:01:53,686 --> 01:01:55,187
Because I love you.

846
01:01:57,273 --> 01:01:59,692
Oh, Madison.

847
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:05,698
Madison, I love...

848
01:02:06,198 --> 01:02:07,658
This, ah, present.

849
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:10,036
I love it.

850
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:14,623
And I love you.

851
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:22,798
<i>What's happened to you?</i>

852
01:02:23,215 --> 01:02:25,551
You were the brightest student
in my class.

853
01:02:26,218 --> 01:02:29,472
True, emotionally,
you were 12 years old.

854
01:02:29,638 --> 01:02:31,098
I was 12 years old.

855
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:32,641
That's right.

856
01:02:33,309 --> 01:02:34,935
Look what you've become,

857
01:02:35,561 --> 01:02:36,854
a schmuck.

858
01:02:38,105 --> 01:02:40,733
There is a mermaid in New York City.

859
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:45,237
You mean this naked girl?

860
01:02:46,322 --> 01:02:47,740
How come she's got legs?

861
01:02:48,407 --> 01:02:52,244
She has legs out of water
and fins in the water.

862
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,498
You taught me that, Dr. Zidell.
Remember?

863
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:58,209
You taught me all the legends.

864
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,711
You used to bring me in the office.

865
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:02,880
You used to show me charts
on the walls

866
01:03:02,963 --> 01:03:05,674
where sailors had claimed
they saw mermaids.

867
01:03:05,841 --> 01:03:11,180
Walter, that was for fun, for relaxation,
not for you to build your whole life on.

868
01:03:13,265 --> 01:03:16,727
I'm gonna prove to you
and everyone else

869
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:19,355
that that girl is a mermaid!

870
01:03:20,314 --> 01:03:21,690
How?

871
01:03:21,816 --> 01:03:25,152
You gonna get her wet
so everybody sees she has fins?

872
01:04:00,813 --> 01:04:02,148
Taxi?

873
01:04:05,151 --> 01:04:06,360
Oh!

874
01:04:06,444 --> 01:04:08,487
- Watch it!
-Hey, watch it, buddy.

875
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:09,613
Excuse me.

876
01:04:15,077 --> 01:04:16,454
Look out.

877
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:22,209
What does he think he's doing?

878
01:04:23,586 --> 01:04:25,087
Hey! Hey!

879
01:04:38,434 --> 01:04:39,935
Oh, my.

880
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:44,231
- Ow, ohh, Oof!

881
01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:12,551
Oops.

882
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:15,596
Nice earrings.

883
01:05:18,516 --> 01:05:21,060
- Is something the matter?
-No, nothing at all.

884
01:05:21,143 --> 01:05:25,981
I was thinking.
You don't have to leave the country.

885
01:05:27,816 --> 01:05:29,401
- I do.
-You don't.

886
01:05:29,485 --> 01:05:33,239
There's stuff we can do
to get around the immigration laws.

887
01:05:33,322 --> 01:05:37,034
For instance, I could give you a job
down at the market.

888
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,495
You could get a work visa.

889
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:44,375
Or, uh, you could, uh,

890
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:47,836
marry, like, an American,

891
01:05:48,837 --> 01:05:50,297
and they have to let you stay.

892
01:05:50,881 --> 01:05:52,174
Our food is here!

893
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:58,347
Oh. Well, we'll talk about it later.

894
01:05:59,348 --> 01:06:02,101
Do be careful, madam.
The plate is very hot.

895
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:05,104
Thank you. These look terrific.

896
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:28,669
She's really hungry!

897
01:06:54,612 --> 01:06:56,280
You were very good.

898
01:06:56,572 --> 01:06:59,575
Come on. Oops. Come on.

899
01:07:01,076 --> 01:07:02,578
Let's sit down and talk.

900
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:06,248
Ah.

901
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,543
Your nose is cold.

902
01:07:10,419 --> 01:07:12,046
I don't want to talk about my nose.

903
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,423
Your ears are all red!

904
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,593
I don't want to talk about
any part of my face.

905
01:07:19,428 --> 01:07:23,891
But I do want to talk about
what happened in the restaurant.

906
01:07:25,934 --> 01:07:27,186
I'm sorry.

907
01:07:27,603 --> 01:07:29,730
That's how we eat lobster
where I come from.

908
01:07:29,855 --> 01:07:33,692
Oh, no, no, no. I don't care about that.

909
01:07:34,109 --> 01:07:35,444
No. I don't care about that.

910
01:07:36,904 --> 01:07:40,366
I was trying to do something in there,
and I guess I did it very badly.

911
01:07:40,449 --> 01:07:42,159
I was trying

912
01:07:43,994 --> 01:07:47,039
to ask you if you wanted to get married.

913
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:52,127
Madison, will you marry me?

914
01:07:59,468 --> 01:08:00,803
No.

915
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,306
What? No? Just no?

916
01:08:04,556 --> 01:08:07,267
You don't want to think about it,
kick it around?

917
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:09,144
- I can't.
-Why?

918
01:08:10,312 --> 01:08:11,730
I can't tell you.

919
01:08:11,814 --> 01:08:16,443
I know you have some big secret
you think you can't tell me, but you can.

920
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:18,570
- You're already married?
-Allen.

921
01:08:18,654 --> 01:08:20,489
You're dying? You were once a man?

922
01:08:20,572 --> 01:08:22,074
Whatever it is, I don't care,
you can tell me.

923
01:08:22,157 --> 01:08:23,367
Allen.

924
01:08:23,992 --> 01:08:26,036
I only have three days left.

925
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:30,499
Please make them wonderful.

926
01:08:33,419 --> 01:08:34,670
Okay.

927
01:08:42,511 --> 01:08:43,846
Want to skate some more?

928
01:08:46,014 --> 01:08:47,266
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

929
01:08:51,937 --> 01:08:53,522
Allen?

930
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,249
You know them?

931
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:15,753
No, I've just seen them before.

932
01:09:15,878 --> 01:09:18,672
I guess they've been coming here
together for about 40 years.

933
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,343
They look very happy.

934
01:09:24,094 --> 01:09:26,346
Why shouldn't they be happy, huh?

935
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:29,349
They get to spend
their whole lives together, don't they?

936
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:36,315
Is this really what happens
when water gets cold?

937
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:38,233
Yeah.

938
01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:41,779
Where I come from, it never gets cold.

939
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:44,490
Well, hey, what a breakthrough!

940
01:09:45,032 --> 01:09:47,785
You just really opened up to me there.

941
01:09:51,789 --> 01:09:53,248
Your voice sounds funny.

942
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:55,375
It's called sarcasm.

943
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:57,669
They don't have that
where you come from either?

944
01:10:00,255 --> 01:10:01,507
No.

945
01:10:04,676 --> 01:10:06,762
Well, they don't have anything,
do they?

946
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:11,391
They don't have ice, or music
or clothes.

947
01:10:11,725 --> 01:10:14,353
What kind of a place is this, Madison?

948
01:10:15,604 --> 01:10:16,939
Madison?

949
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:18,690
Madison!

950
01:10:18,941 --> 01:10:20,776
Hey, those skates are rented!

951
01:10:20,943 --> 01:10:24,530
Give me one second. Madison?
Ahh! Madison!

952
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:29,868
Madison, please? I'm sorry!

953
01:10:29,952 --> 01:10:32,746
Let her go.
Show some dignity, for Christ's sake.

954
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:34,540
Madison?

955
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,633
Thanks.

956
01:12:35,953 --> 01:12:37,746
Hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?

957
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,045
- Allen?
-What?

958
01:12:54,012 --> 01:12:55,222
Yes.

959
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:14,449
If we get our blood test today,
we can marry tomorrow!

960
01:13:14,616 --> 01:13:16,910
Before the blood test,
I have to tell you everything.

961
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:18,370
So, tell me.

962
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:21,540
- Not today.
-But see,

963
01:13:21,623 --> 01:13:24,209
if we get the test today,
no pressure, mind you,

964
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:25,794
but if we get the blood test today,

965
01:13:25,877 --> 01:13:28,046
as soon as you tell me,
we can get married.

966
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:30,507
Listen, you will love
being married to me.

967
01:13:30,632 --> 01:13:31,717
I was born to be married.

968
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,136
I happen to come from a long line
of married people.

969
01:13:34,219 --> 01:13:36,054
My mom and dad were married.

970
01:13:36,138 --> 01:13:38,056
Their moms and dads
were married, too.

971
01:14:18,096 --> 01:14:19,514
Son of a bitch.

972
01:14:20,474 --> 01:14:22,350
I thought we were going upstairs.

973
01:14:22,434 --> 01:14:25,270
Yeah, I know.
I love you. I'm not gonna lose you again.

974
01:14:25,353 --> 01:14:26,897
We are getting married tonight.

975
01:14:27,022 --> 01:14:28,648
We're gonna drive to Maryland.

976
01:14:28,732 --> 01:14:30,025
I don't know why I didn't think
of it before.

977
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:33,278
Freddie always marries there.
You don't need a blood test down there.

978
01:14:34,112 --> 01:14:36,364
There's this dinner
with the president. Damn!

979
01:14:36,531 --> 01:14:40,827
Hey, that's okay!
We'll go to Maryland after dinner.

980
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:42,454
We'll already be dressed up!

981
01:14:42,537 --> 01:14:43,789
I haven't told you...

982
01:14:43,872 --> 01:14:45,665
I know.
You haven't told me this big secret.

983
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:48,168
That's okay.
Tell me on the way to Maryland.

984
01:14:49,753 --> 01:14:51,088
Ooh!

985
01:15:21,326 --> 01:15:24,371
You know what I hope?
I hope we have a boy and a girl.

986
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,041
What kind?

987
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:32,838
What kind? The young kind, I guess.

988
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:35,173
The older ones are
a little hard to deliver.

989
01:15:36,049 --> 01:15:37,551
We're getting married tonight.

990
01:15:37,717 --> 01:15:39,761
- Wonderful.
-Thank you.

991
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:43,098
Why is this bread in here
instead of out there?

992
01:15:43,431 --> 01:15:45,267
The butter is hard like a rock.

993
01:15:46,518 --> 01:15:48,270
Do you have a broken arm?

994
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:52,107
No, it's fractured in 16 places.

995
01:15:52,607 --> 01:15:54,025
Why are you here?

996
01:15:56,278 --> 01:15:57,445
The union sent me.

997
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:02,909
My God, the president is here!

998
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,413
The president's here.
The president's here!

999
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:25,682
Hmm.

1000
01:16:42,157 --> 01:16:47,329
<i>I'm just a corn-fed Kansas boy,
but you are the Big Apple of my eye.</i>

1001
01:16:48,705 --> 01:16:50,123
<i>Thank you.</i>

1002
01:16:51,374 --> 01:16:52,584
<i>Thank you.</i>

1003
01:16:52,876 --> 01:16:54,336
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1004
01:16:56,504 --> 01:16:59,341
<i>Thank you.
It's great to be back in New York.</i>

1005
01:17:11,645 --> 01:17:13,313
Alert. Alert. Table 5.

1006
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:15,523
<i>Intercept busboy
with suspicious hump.</i>

1007
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:20,820
He's reaching! Get him now!

1008
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:23,990
- Sir, I'd like a word with you, please.
-About what?

1009
01:17:24,449 --> 01:17:26,159
This has nothing to do
with the president.

1010
01:17:26,368 --> 01:17:27,786
This has nothing to do
with the president!

1011
01:17:31,665 --> 01:17:34,876
<i>Well, I guess he just found out
what his dinner cost.</i>

1012
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,674
I want to talk to the press.

1013
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:42,550
I want to talk to the press.

1014
01:17:43,718 --> 01:17:45,637
I have a formal statement to make!

1015
01:17:46,554 --> 01:17:49,224
<i>In Bob Hollins,
you have a <i>candidate for Congress</i>

1016
01:17:49,307 --> 01:17:50,976
<i>who is in touch with the people.</i>

1017
01:17:51,226 --> 01:17:54,562
<i>A man who built up the business
left to him by his grandfather.</i>

1018
01:17:55,313 --> 01:17:57,315
<i>What was once a small
pushcart on wheels...</i>

1019
01:17:58,191 --> 01:18:00,068
- Allen?
-Yeah?

1020
01:18:00,652 --> 01:18:02,237
It's time for me to tell you.

1021
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,823
What? Now?

1022
01:18:05,657 --> 01:18:08,410
- Right now.
-Okay. Great.

1023
01:18:08,493 --> 01:18:10,203
- Not here.
-Fine. Fine.

1024
01:18:10,287 --> 01:18:12,247
<i>But more importantly,
with fresh meat.</i>

1025
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,836
I am not crazy.
There's a mermaid in there.

1026
01:18:17,919 --> 01:18:19,879
- Shut up.
-I am a scientist!

1027
01:18:20,839 --> 01:18:22,465
Where's the goddamn car!

1028
01:18:23,591 --> 01:18:25,176
The gray BMW.

1029
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:31,725
Hey, I know that guy.

1030
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:34,811
I saw him on Cape Cod.
He was crazy then.

1031
01:18:36,187 --> 01:18:38,857
There she is! There she is!

1032
01:18:41,609 --> 01:18:43,445
- Don't let him shoot that.
-That a gun?

1033
01:18:44,446 --> 01:18:46,239
- Hold it!
-No!

1034
01:18:46,614 --> 01:18:48,283
Get that thing out of his hand.

1035
01:18:49,784 --> 01:18:51,244
Grab that hose!

1036
01:18:51,786 --> 01:18:54,664
Grab him! Get him!

1037
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,379
- No!
-What's going on?

1038
01:19:20,565 --> 01:19:22,567
I was right!

1039
01:19:23,485 --> 01:19:26,154
Behold the mermaid!

1040
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:34,996
Let me outta here!

1041
01:19:35,497 --> 01:19:37,290
Who are you? What is your name?

1042
01:19:37,499 --> 01:19:38,917
Allen!

1043
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,670
- What do we do?
-Grab her. Grab everybody.

1044
01:19:43,505 --> 01:19:44,839
I want to see her.

1045
01:19:44,923 --> 01:19:46,174
Allen!

1046
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,011
Get her! Get her!

1047
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:52,764
Allen!

1048
01:19:57,227 --> 01:19:58,561
Please?

1049
01:19:58,686 --> 01:20:01,648
- Let's pick her up.
-Allen. Allen!

1050
01:20:13,868 --> 01:20:15,537
Allen!

1051
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:24,379
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.

1052
01:20:26,047 --> 01:20:28,216
<i>Dr. Hill, line 5. Stat!</i>

1053
01:20:31,511 --> 01:20:32,554
- Buckwalter.
-Sir!

1054
01:20:34,222 --> 01:20:35,723
Gentlemen.

1055
01:20:35,974 --> 01:20:37,767
- Anything?
-No change.

1056
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:50,488
I am not a fish!

1057
01:20:51,197 --> 01:20:54,576
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

1058
01:20:55,785 --> 01:20:58,872
Will you just let me out of here?

1059
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:01,833
Please? Huh? People?

1060
01:21:02,959 --> 01:21:04,419
Let's try some interaction.

1061
01:21:04,878 --> 01:21:06,671
Fine. Jim?

1062
01:21:59,098 --> 01:22:02,310
I guess they thought you might be one.

1063
01:22:04,437 --> 01:22:05,688
Yeah.

1064
01:22:06,898 --> 01:22:08,316
I guess so.

1065
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:13,279
You said whatever my secret was,
you'd understand.

1066
01:22:15,114 --> 01:22:16,449
I know.

1067
01:22:20,453 --> 01:22:22,497
You thought
at least I was a human being.

1068
01:22:30,755 --> 01:22:32,507
Allen?

1069
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:52,318
He's been in the water 12 hours.
He's just a man.

1070
01:22:52,443 --> 01:22:55,071
Get him out of there
so we can concentrate on her.

1071
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:09,377
Greg Martin, WMET Radio,
here with Allen Bauer.

1072
01:23:09,877 --> 01:23:13,006
- When did you meet the mermaid?
-Tell me, where did you meet?

1073
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:15,383
Did you know she was a mermaid?

1074
01:23:15,466 --> 01:23:19,262
- Did you actually make love to her?
-That's a stupid question.

1075
01:23:19,345 --> 01:23:20,763
Did she eat worms?

1076
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:23,850
Would you have to make
love to her in water?

1077
01:23:24,058 --> 01:23:25,727
That's none of your business.

1078
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:28,229
Is she a mutant or missing link?

1079
01:23:28,646 --> 01:23:29,897
No, she's not.

1080
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:33,318
I'm from <i>People</i> magazine.
ls she also seeing Burt Reynolds?

1081
01:23:33,901 --> 01:23:35,361
For crying out loud!

1082
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:41,075
Leave him alone!

1083
01:23:41,576 --> 01:23:45,246
Leave him alone! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1084
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:47,832
- Let me through.
-Out of the way.

1085
01:23:47,915 --> 01:23:51,169
- Allen, you all right?
-Yeah. Get me out of here.

1086
01:23:51,252 --> 01:23:53,463
Is anyone here
from Penthouse magazine?

1087
01:23:53,546 --> 01:23:55,465
- No.
- Then we ain't talking.

1088
01:24:17,654 --> 01:24:18,905
Hey, Allen?

1089
01:24:26,287 --> 01:24:27,455
What are you looking at?

1090
01:24:27,622 --> 01:24:29,874
You never saw a guy
who slept with a fish before?

1091
01:24:29,957 --> 01:24:31,459
Get back to work!

1092
01:24:34,212 --> 01:24:38,758
Mr. Bauer, you had a million messages.
I wrote them down right here.

1093
01:24:38,966 --> 01:24:44,097
You got calls from CBS, NBC, ABC, AP,

1094
01:24:44,472 --> 01:24:48,142
<i>UPI, Ted Turner, Time, Newsweek,</i>

1095
01:24:48,226 --> 01:24:50,978
Marineland, Ripley's Believe It or Not,

1096
01:24:51,312 --> 01:24:53,022
and Mrs. Paul.

1097
01:24:53,564 --> 01:24:55,066
Not now, Mrs. Stimler.

1098
01:25:00,988 --> 01:25:02,281
"Fishman"?

1099
01:25:03,408 --> 01:25:04,701
"Fishman"?

1100
01:25:06,703 --> 01:25:08,413
That's what they're
calling you on TV, too.

1101
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:10,498
Personally, I think it's kinda cute.

1102
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:16,713
So, how is she?

1103
01:25:17,088 --> 01:25:18,256
How is she?

1104
01:25:18,339 --> 01:25:19,966
She's a...

1105
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:22,343
She's a mermaid.

1106
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,178
I don't understand.

1107
01:25:25,638 --> 01:25:28,182
All my life I've been waiting for someone

1108
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:32,854
and when I find her, she's a fish.

1109
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,523
Nobody said love's perfect!

1110
01:25:35,898 --> 01:25:40,236
Oh, Freddie,
I don't expect it to be perfect,

1111
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,114
but for God's sake, it's usually human!

1112
01:25:45,533 --> 01:25:48,244
Every day people meet
and they fall in love.

1113
01:25:48,453 --> 01:25:49,746
Look what I got.

1114
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:55,042
Look what you got.
Yeah, let's look at what you got.

1115
01:25:56,586 --> 01:25:58,880
Let's take a good look at what you got.

1116
01:25:59,714 --> 01:26:01,799
People fall in love every day, huh?
ls that what you said?

1117
01:26:01,883 --> 01:26:03,301
- Yeah.
-Yeah?

1118
01:26:03,384 --> 01:26:05,845
That's a crock! It doesn't work that way.

1119
01:26:06,888 --> 01:26:08,931
Do you realize how happy
you were with her?

1120
01:26:09,015 --> 01:26:11,350
That is, when you weren't
driving yourself crazy.

1121
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:14,353
Every day? Come on.

1122
01:26:14,896 --> 01:26:18,441
Some people will never be that happy!
I'll never be that happy.

1123
01:26:23,529 --> 01:26:24,989
What am I talking to you for?

1124
01:26:25,531 --> 01:26:27,533
You don't know nothing. Mrs. Stimler?

1125
01:27:01,776 --> 01:27:03,277
Does she look a little pale?

1126
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:07,532
Ah, that's a good day's work.

1127
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,952
Tomorrow, I want to see
how she interacts

1128
01:27:11,035 --> 01:27:14,413
with other marine life,
then the internal examination.

1129
01:27:16,999 --> 01:27:18,459
Internal examination.

1130
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,587
Of course.
I want to study her pulmonary system,

1131
01:27:21,671 --> 01:27:23,381
reproductive organs, everything!

1132
01:27:23,464 --> 01:27:24,757
Dr. Ross?

1133
01:27:26,342 --> 01:27:28,302
Are we considering

1134
01:27:28,928 --> 01:27:32,557
how the subject is responding
to the examination procedure?

1135
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:34,642
I'm considering everything!

1136
01:27:35,726 --> 01:27:39,856
Ah, yes.
Well, I'm sure you are, Dr. Ross.

1137
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:42,984
How stupid of me.
But let me ask you this.

1138
01:27:43,067 --> 01:27:47,321
Are you considering the possibility
that you might be a sadistic pig?

1139
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:55,580
While we are baring
our souls, Mr. Kornbluth,

1140
01:27:55,663 --> 01:27:59,292
I must honestly tell you I have never
considered you a man of science.

1141
01:27:59,834 --> 01:28:02,295
You're not a member of my team.

1142
01:28:02,837 --> 01:28:07,174
Run along, Walter.
See if you can't find a unicorn.

1143
01:29:17,078 --> 01:29:18,079
What's that?

1144
01:29:18,162 --> 01:29:19,956
Painkiller, Mr. Kornbluth.

1145
01:29:20,122 --> 01:29:22,416
Whoever punched you
cracked your tooth.

1146
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:25,211
We'll be very close to the nerve.

1147
01:29:25,419 --> 01:29:28,714
I don't deserve painkiller. Just drill.

1148
01:29:29,048 --> 01:29:33,094
Oh, you want pain.
Well, we aim to please.

1149
01:29:36,764 --> 01:29:37,848
Get out.

1150
01:29:38,182 --> 01:29:39,725
- What are you...
-Get out!

1151
01:29:40,017 --> 01:29:42,353
- Ja, ja, ja.
-Please stay. Ahh!

1152
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:46,774
Let's talk.

1153
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,862
Hey, put that down.

1154
01:29:51,988 --> 01:29:54,281
- Put that needle down.
-Stay away from me.

1155
01:29:54,448 --> 01:29:56,784
I said, "Let's talk." Put it down.

1156
01:29:56,867 --> 01:29:58,202
Stay away from me.

1157
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:05,501
Ahhh!

1158
01:30:06,043 --> 01:30:09,463
Ahhh! Ohhh!

1159
01:30:11,215 --> 01:30:12,383
Uh.

1160
01:30:14,802 --> 01:30:15,970
Ah!

1161
01:30:17,471 --> 01:30:18,597
Ah!

1162
01:30:19,765 --> 01:30:20,933
Ah!

1163
01:30:21,559 --> 01:30:23,185
What a week I'm having!

1164
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:28,357
You've destroyed my life, Kornbluth.

1165
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:29,942
I didn't mean to.

1166
01:30:31,944 --> 01:30:34,447
I just had to prove that I wasn't crazy.

1167
01:30:35,156 --> 01:30:36,615
I'm a man of science.

1168
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:43,122
I just didn't think about
how it would affect you.

1169
01:30:44,707 --> 01:30:45,958
Or her.

1170
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,502
I'm really a nice guy.

1171
01:30:49,211 --> 01:30:50,880
If I had friends, you could ask them.

1172
01:30:52,339 --> 01:30:53,966
I've been on the phone
to every employee

1173
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,551
of the United States government

1174
01:30:55,718 --> 01:30:57,219
calling them sons of bitches.

1175
01:31:00,222 --> 01:31:02,349
Nobody could even get in to see her.

1176
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:06,395
I can.

1177
01:31:09,648 --> 01:31:11,358
Come on. Come on!

1178
01:31:11,859 --> 01:31:13,527
- Ahh!
-Come on.

1179
01:31:55,486 --> 01:31:59,448
Good afternoon, Dr. Kornbluth.
I wasn't expecting you today.

1180
01:31:59,532 --> 01:32:03,077
These are Drs. Jarred and Johannsen
from the Stockholm Institute.

1181
01:32:03,577 --> 01:32:05,371
I thought they were
coming later with Dr. Ross.

1182
01:32:06,872 --> 01:32:09,917
No, no. That story was to fool the press.

1183
01:32:12,294 --> 01:32:13,921
You know, I'm half Swedish.

1184
01:32:18,926 --> 01:32:20,594
- Ja.
-Ja.

1185
01:32:24,265 --> 01:32:26,725
- Ja.
-Oh, ja.

1186
01:32:28,686 --> 01:32:29,770
Well!

1187
01:32:30,437 --> 01:32:31,856
Just a second.

1188
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:49,456
Ah.

1189
01:33:02,136 --> 01:33:04,471
- How the hell did you do that?
-Let me tell you.

1190
01:33:04,763 --> 01:33:07,057
Many nudie films come from Sweden.

1191
01:33:07,224 --> 01:33:11,020
After you see them 400 or 500 times,
the stuff sinks in.

1192
01:33:13,189 --> 01:33:14,315
Afternoon, Buckwalter.

1193
01:33:14,398 --> 01:33:16,567
Sorry, no one comes in

1194
01:33:16,692 --> 01:33:18,652
until Dr. Ross gets back
with them Swede people.

1195
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,654
These are the Swedish doctors.

1196
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:23,073
These are Swedes?

1197
01:33:24,241 --> 01:33:26,035
Ah, come here.

1198
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:29,830
Isn't that one kinda dark?

1199
01:33:30,831 --> 01:33:32,499
He's dirty from the trip!

1200
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:34,460
Let us in.

1201
01:33:34,543 --> 01:33:36,879
- I'm not supposed to.
-What are you afraid of?

1202
01:33:37,338 --> 01:33:40,049
Do you think we're
gonna steal the mermaid?

1203
01:33:41,675 --> 01:33:44,261
Steal the mermaid.
Stealing the mermaid!

1204
01:33:44,345 --> 01:33:46,847
Are we gonna fold her in half
and put her in a briefcase?

1205
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:48,933
In a briefcase. In half.

1206
01:33:49,475 --> 01:33:51,644
I guess it's all right.

1207
01:33:51,727 --> 01:33:53,562
Go in. Go in.

1208
01:33:53,854 --> 01:33:55,731
- Good joke, there.
-Yeah.

1209
01:34:30,557 --> 01:34:32,268
- Hi.
-Hi.

1210
01:34:34,186 --> 01:34:36,563
Is this the big secret
you've been keeping?

1211
01:34:37,147 --> 01:34:39,608
That you're a mermaid,
or is there something else?

1212
01:34:40,401 --> 01:34:41,902
No, that's it.

1213
01:34:45,114 --> 01:34:47,950
Allen, don't feel guilty.

1214
01:34:48,534 --> 01:34:49,910
Guilty? About what?

1215
01:34:50,744 --> 01:34:52,329
About not loving me anymore.

1216
01:34:54,498 --> 01:34:56,750
Oh, Madison.

1217
01:34:57,334 --> 01:35:00,963
All the time we were together,
you always knew how I was feeling.

1218
01:35:02,381 --> 01:35:03,924
Can't you tell now?

1219
01:35:13,976 --> 01:35:17,062
<i>Well, left my wife in New Orleans</i>

1220
01:35:17,229 --> 01:35:19,315
<i>48 kids and a can of beans</i>

1221
01:35:19,523 --> 01:35:20,899
<i>Left, right, one, two</i>

1222
01:35:20,983 --> 01:35:22,401
Oh, my God!

1223
01:35:22,484 --> 01:35:24,278
- What?
-Stand back, man.

1224
01:35:24,611 --> 01:35:27,448
Cover his face, for God's sake!

1225
01:35:28,115 --> 01:35:30,326
What happened? What's going on?

1226
01:35:30,451 --> 01:35:33,370
Dr. Johannsen bent down
to examine that creature.

1227
01:35:33,454 --> 01:35:36,165
And suddenly these rays
came out of her eyes!

1228
01:35:36,415 --> 01:35:39,418
Don't go in there!
She'll melt your face off.

1229
01:35:39,626 --> 01:35:41,712
I knew something would happen.
What should I do?

1230
01:35:41,795 --> 01:35:44,214
Don't whine. Seal off the area.

1231
01:35:44,298 --> 01:35:45,507
I'll call the Pentagon.

1232
01:35:45,632 --> 01:35:48,218
Are you crazy?
You want to create a national panic?

1233
01:35:48,302 --> 01:35:50,179
I don't want to die!

1234
01:35:50,262 --> 01:35:51,638
Pull yourself together.

1235
01:35:51,722 --> 01:35:53,891
Don't let anybody in that room.

1236
01:35:53,974 --> 01:35:57,186
I'll be back with nuclear weapons.
Come on, Doctor.

1237
01:36:25,005 --> 01:36:27,216
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.
Who are your guests?

1238
01:36:27,299 --> 01:36:29,843
Drs. Jarred and Johannsen
from the Swedish Institute.

1239
01:36:30,677 --> 01:36:32,012
Sir?

1240
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:36,683
Dr. Kornbluth left with
the Swedes a few minutes ago.

1241
01:36:44,525 --> 01:36:47,444
Hiya, boys. Come in. The water's fine.

1242
01:36:50,656 --> 01:36:54,326
Let's get her back, now! And arrest him.

1243
01:37:09,425 --> 01:37:12,678
<i>We have a <i>blue BMW Over.</i>

1244
01:37:36,076 --> 01:37:37,995
--Come on.

1245
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:41,707
Know something?
I don't think we're being followed.

1246
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:44,918
Wha... Well, that was easy.

1247
01:37:45,252 --> 01:37:47,921
That was simple! We did it!

1248
01:37:48,589 --> 01:37:50,841
- My plan.
- You're a genius.

1249
01:37:50,924 --> 01:37:53,677
I am a genius,
but you came in with the Swedish thing.

1250
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,555
That was a brilliant touch.

1251
01:37:57,514 --> 01:37:59,475
I didn't even like you when we first met.

1252
01:37:59,558 --> 01:38:01,810
Nobody likes me
when they first meet me.

1253
01:38:03,854 --> 01:38:05,063
Allen?

1254
01:38:13,113 --> 01:38:15,240
- Move!
-All right. Here we go!

1255
01:38:31,965 --> 01:38:34,176
<i>Suspect heading south on Broadway.</i>

1256
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:10,337
<i>Unit One. Lost them
in the Wall Street district. Over.</i>

1257
01:39:14,258 --> 01:39:15,300
- Stop the car.
-What?

1258
01:39:15,384 --> 01:39:18,262
Stop and let me out.
I'll slow them down. Do it!

1259
01:39:25,185 --> 01:39:28,230
I caused all this.
Now I'm gonna finish it.

1260
01:39:37,364 --> 01:39:38,907
Get the hell out of here.

1261
01:39:39,741 --> 01:39:41,034
Go!

1262
01:39:58,885 --> 01:40:00,387
Whoa! Ooh.

1263
01:40:03,223 --> 01:40:05,392
What a week I'm having!

1264
01:40:20,991 --> 01:40:23,243
Hey, Mac, move that thing out of here.

1265
01:40:24,745 --> 01:40:27,039
Up yours, Gomer. I'm waitin' for a fare.

1266
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:37,341
Heave!

1267
01:40:39,259 --> 01:40:41,011
All right. Move out.

1268
01:40:42,721 --> 01:40:44,056
Come on, let's go!

1269
01:41:10,957 --> 01:41:13,293
- I was ready to stay with you forever.
-I know.

1270
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:16,129
They know who you are.
They won't leave you alone.

1271
01:41:16,797 --> 01:41:18,590
I can't ever come back to you.

1272
01:41:19,633 --> 01:41:21,301
I wish I could go with you.

1273
01:41:22,636 --> 01:41:23,762
You can.

1274
01:41:24,012 --> 01:41:26,014
- How?
-It can be done.

1275
01:41:26,556 --> 01:41:30,227
Remember when you were eight
and fell off the ship?

1276
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,604
You were safe under the water,
weren't you?

1277
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,107
Yeah.

1278
01:41:35,816 --> 01:41:37,317
You were with me.

1279
01:41:39,277 --> 01:41:40,862
You mean, that was real?

1280
01:41:42,364 --> 01:41:43,865
That was you?

1281
01:41:44,825 --> 01:41:46,326
That was you!

1282
01:41:50,664 --> 01:41:52,791
This is great. This is great!

1283
01:41:52,958 --> 01:41:56,169
I can go with you and still come back
and see Freddie at Christmas.

1284
01:41:58,338 --> 01:41:59,923
You can't ever come back.

1285
01:42:14,104 --> 01:42:15,605
Madison.

1286
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:20,152
I understand.

1287
01:42:29,995 --> 01:42:33,832
<i>You on the dock, don't move.
You're under arrest.</i>

1288
01:42:34,374 --> 01:42:38,545
<i>Let the girl go. Step back.
You're under arrest.</i>

1289
01:42:38,712 --> 01:42:40,213
You have to go.

1290
01:42:40,672 --> 01:42:42,257
Move out. Let's go!

1291
01:42:44,009 --> 01:42:45,594
I love you, Madison.

1292
01:42:47,888 --> 01:42:49,055
Go.

1293
01:42:51,433 --> 01:42:53,226
Go!

1294
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,277
<i>Get that guy on the dock.</i>

1295
01:43:04,321 --> 01:43:05,739
Leave her alone!

1296
01:43:08,867 --> 01:43:10,368
Leave her alone!

1297
01:43:21,421 --> 01:43:22,756
Madison.

1298
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,473
Madison!

1299
01:43:42,317 --> 01:43:44,444
<i>Stay where you are. We'll get you out.</i>

1300
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:50,826
Madison!

1301
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:40,208
Ooh!

1302
01:45:12,824 --> 01:45:15,285
<i>One fine day</i>

1303
01:45:17,871 --> 01:45:21,374
<i>Love came for me</i>

1304
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:27,672
<i>And love was rare</i>

1305
01:45:30,133 --> 01:45:33,887
<i>As love can be</i>

1306
01:45:36,056 --> 01:45:40,727
<i>I saw stars</i>

1307
01:45:41,728 --> 01:45:46,900
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>

1308
01:45:47,692 --> 01:45:51,488
<i>We flowed together</i>

1309
01:45:53,448 --> 01:45:57,452
<i>Once and forever</i>

1310
01:45:59,287 --> 01:46:03,458
<i>Love came for me</i>

1311
01:46:05,335 --> 01:46:09,005
<i>One fine night</i>

1312
01:46:11,091 --> 01:46:14,803
<i>Love let us see</i>

1313
01:46:16,972 --> 01:46:20,433
<i>How far we'll go</i>

1314
01:46:22,769 --> 01:46:26,439
<i>How good we'll be</i>

1315
01:46:28,525 --> 01:46:32,779
<i>We saw a world</i>

1316
01:46:33,738 --> 01:46:38,994
<i>No one ever saw before</i>

1317
01:46:40,245 --> 01:46:43,581
<i>It was the world</i>

1318
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:46,459
<i>Love can start</i>

1319
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:51,548
<i>With a beat of a heart</i>

1320
01:46:51,881 --> 01:46:55,885
<i>Love came for me</i>

1321
01:47:21,619 --> 01:47:25,248
<i>I saw stars</i>

1322
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:31,671
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>

1323
01:47:32,839 --> 01:47:36,342
<i>We flowed together</i>

1324
01:47:38,595 --> 01:47:42,515
<i>Once and forever</i>

1325
01:47:44,559 --> 01:47:48,396
<i>Love came for me</i>

1326
01:47:50,398 --> 01:47:53,860
<i>One fine night</i>

1327
01:47:56,154 --> 01:47:59,866
<i>Love let us see</i>

1328
01:48:01,993 --> 01:48:05,705
<i>How far we'll go</i>

1329
01:48:07,832 --> 01:48:11,377
<i>How good we'll be</i>

1330
01:48:13,755 --> 01:48:17,967
<i>We saw a world</i>

1331
01:48:18,885 --> 01:48:24,432

<i>With a beat of a heart</i>

1335

<i>Love came for me</i>

1336
01:48:42,951 --> 01:48:47,080
<i>Love came for me</i>

1337
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:52,669
<i>Love came for me</i>
