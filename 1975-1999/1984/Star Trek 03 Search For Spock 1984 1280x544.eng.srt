1
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,853
Don't grieve,
Admiral.

2
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:29,898
It is logical.

3
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:36,862
The needs
of the many outweigh...

4
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,991
the needs of the few.

5
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,951
Or the one.

6
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:46,120
And I have been

7
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:48,621
and always shall be

8
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:51,082
your friend.

9
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,043
Live long...

10
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:58,295
and prosper.

11
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:05,593
We are assembled
here today

12
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:09,596
to pay final respects
to our honored dead.

13
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:14,642
This death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

14
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:17,144
the sunrise
of a new world,

15
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:19,062
a world
our beloved comrade

16
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,522
gave his life to protect
and nourish.

17
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:24,191
He did not feel
this sacrifice

18
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:26,317
a vain or empty one.

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,989
Of my friend,
I can only say this.

20
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:39,328
Of all the souls
I have encountered

21
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,329
in my travels,

22
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:43,081
his was the most...

23
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,085
human.

24
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:54,090
Honors, hup!

25
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:17,734
Space, the final frontier.

26
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:20,486
These are
the continuing voyages

27
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:23,988
of the Starship Enterprise.

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,490
Her ongoing mission-

29
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,159
to explore
strange new worlds,

30
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:32,119
to seek out
new life forms

31
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:34,997
and new civilizations.

32
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,332
To boldly go

33
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:40,251
where no man has gone

34
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:41,752
before.

35
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,929
U.S.S. Enterprise,
Captain 's personal log.

36
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:36,264
With most of our
battle damage repaired,

37
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:37,874
we're almost home.

38
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:38,809
we're almost home.

39
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:41,644
Yet I feel uneasy,

40
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,646
and I wonder why.

41
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:50,192
Perhaps it is
the emptiness

42
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:53,153
of this vessel.

43
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:56,697
Most of our trainee crew
have been reassigned.

44
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:59,199
Lieutenant Saavik
and my son David

45
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:01,201
are exploring
the Genesis planet,

46
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:02,786
which he helped create.

47
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,787
And Enterprise feels
like a house

48
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:07,665
with all
the children gone.

49
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:10,792
No. More empty
even than that.

50
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,964
The death of Spock
is like an open wound.

51
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:18,965
It seems that
I have left

52
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,800
the noblest
part of myself

53
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:23,677
back there,
on that newborn planet.

54
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,012
Status, Mr. Sulu.

55
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,639
On course, Admiral.

56
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,183
Estimating space dock
in 2.1 hours.

57
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:34,060
Mr. Chekov, I'll need
a pre-approach scan.

58
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,562
Take the science
station, please.

59
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,063
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,565
Uhura.

61
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:43,568
Any response from Starfleet
on our Genesis inquiries?

62
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:46,361
No, sir. There
is no response.

63
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:48,196
That's very odd.

64
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,658
Scotty,
progress report.

65
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:54,035
It's almost done, sir.

66
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:56,578
You'll be automated
by the time we dock.

67
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:58,580
Your timing
is excellent.

68
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:00,581
You fixed
the barn door

69
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:03,042
after the horse
has come home.

70
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,543
How much refit time
is needed?

71
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:09,421
Eight weeks, sir,
but I'll do it in two.

72
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:12,549
Have you always multiplied
your repair estimates

73
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,967
by a factor of four?

74
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:18,054
How else can I
keep my reputation

75
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,055
as a miracle worker?

76
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,348
Your reputation
is secure, Scotty.

77
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,434
Mr. Sulu,
take the con.

78
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,436
I'll be
in my quarters.

79
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,478
Aye, sir.

80
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,313
Sir?

81
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,814
I was wondering,

82
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:32,814
are they
planning a ceremony

83
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:34,816
when we get in?

84
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,360
I mean a reception?

85
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:40,279
A hero's welcome-
is that what you'd like?

86
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,739
God knows
there should be.

87
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:46,742
We've paid for the party
with our dearest blood.

88
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,479
Steady.

89
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,980
Steady, boys.

90
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:25,648
Keep scanning.

91
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,068
I thought you
people were reliable.

92
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:31,569
Where is he?

93
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:33,987
He's been here
for some time.

94
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,490
Put me on
hailing frequency.

95
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,450
Commander Kruge.

96
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,286
This is Valkris.

97
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:51,419
Well done,
Valkris, well done.

98
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:53,378
What the hell is-

99
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:10,564
What the hell's
going on?

100
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,565
When do
I get paid off?

101
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,859
Soon, Captain.
Quite soon.

102
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:32,586
Approach control,
this is Enterprise,

103
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:34,463
ready for
docking maneuver.

104
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,799
Enterprise is
cleared to dock.

105
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:37,799
Lock on.

106
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,303
Systems locked.

107
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,765
Spacedock,
you have control.

108
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,267
Affirmative,
Enterprise.

109
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,727
Enjoy the ride,
and welcome home.

110
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,145
Enterprise confirms.

111
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:32,301
Would you
look at that.

112
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,510
My friends,

113
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:36,929
the great experiment...

114
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,097
the Excelsior,

115
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,600
ready for trial runs.

116
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:47,520
She's supposed to
have transwarp drive.

117
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:50,523
Aye. And if
my grandmother had wheels,

118
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,524
she'd be a wagon.

119
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,026
Come, come,
Mr. Scott.

120
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:56,487
Young minds, fresh ideas.
Be tolerant.

121
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:02,824
Acknowledge
doors are closing.

122
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,009
Stand by, umbilical

123
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:28,011
and gravitational
support systems.

124
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,972
Moorings activated.
All systems standing by.

125
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,723
Admiral.

126
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:34,266
This is not possible.

127
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:35,767
Mr. Chekov?

128
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,687
An energy reading
from "C" deck,

129
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:41,397
from inside
Mr. Spock's quarters.

130
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:43,649
I ordered Spock's
quarters sealed.

131
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:46,192
Yes, sir. I sealed
the room myself.

132
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,735
Nevertheless, I'm reading
a life form there.

133
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:52,239
This entire crew seems on
the edge of obsessive behavior

134
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,323
concerning Mr. Spock.

135
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,828
Sir, security reports the door
to Spock's quarters

136
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:01,413
has been forced.

137
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,289
I'm on my way.

138
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,165
Mr. Sulu, continue
docking procedure.

139
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:06,166
Aye, sir.

140
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,338
Hmm?

141
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:51,994
Jim...

142
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,787
Help me.

143
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,295
You left me
on Genesis.

144
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:05,630
Why did
you do that?

145
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:07,340
Help me.

146
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,094
Bones.

147
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:19,307
What the hell
are you doing?

148
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,809
Have you
lost your mind?

149
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:24,144
Help me, Jim.

150
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,646
Take me home.

151
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,147
Bones, we are.

152
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:30,650
We are home.

153
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,819
Then perhaps
it's not too late.

154
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,987
Climb
the steps, Jim.

155
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:40,074
Climb the steps
of Mount Seleya.

156
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,534
Mount Seleya?

157
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,704
Bones, Mount Seleya
is on Vulcan.

158
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:50,165
We're home, on Earth.

159
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,669
Remember.

160
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:58,338
Admiral,
docking is completed.

161
00:15:58,421 --> 00:15:59,839
Starfleet Commander Morrow

162
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,840
is on his way
for inspection.

163
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:04,801
Uhura, get
the medics down here!

164
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,844
Get them now!

165
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:14,475
You've all done
remarkable service

166
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,477
under the most
difficult conditions.

167
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,979
You'll be receiving

168
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,771
Starfleet's
highest commendation,

169
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,316
and more importantly,
extended shore leave.

170
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,819
That is,
all but you, Mr. Scott.

171
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,861
They need your wisdom
on the Excelsior.

172
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:32,156
Report there tomorrow
as Captain of Engineering.

173
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,657
With all
appreciation, sir,

174
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,993
I'd prefer
to supervise

175
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,494
the refit of
Enterprise.

176
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:41,122
I'm afraid that
won't be necessary.

177
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,789
But, sir...

178
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,291
I'm sorry, Mr. Scott,

179
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,626
but there
will be no refit.

180
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,168
Admiral.

181
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,670
I don't understand.

182
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:51,171
The Enterprise is not-

183
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:54,549
Jim, the Enterprise
is 20 years old.

184
00:16:54,632 --> 00:16:57,509
We feel
her day is over.

185
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,511
But we had
requested...

186
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:03,222
We'd hoped to take
her back to Genesis.

187
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,932
That is out
of the question.

188
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:07,058
Why?

189
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,436
In your absence,
Genesis has become

190
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,562
a galactic
controversy.

191
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:17,442
Until the Federation
Council makes policy,

192
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:21,153
you're all under orders
not to discuss with anyone

193
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:23,739
your knowledge
of Genesis.

194
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:27,617
Consider it
a quarantined planet

195
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,618
and a forbidden subject.

196
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,793
To fully understand
the events I report,

197
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:42,795
it is necessary
to review

198
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,297
the theoretical data
on the Genesis device

199
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,633
as developed by Doctors
Carol and David Marcus.

200
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:52,802
Genesis, simply put,
is life from lifelessness.

201
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:56,306
We intended to introduce
the Genesis device

202
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,308
into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body-

203
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:02,143
a moon or
other dead form.

204
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:04,103
The device,
when delivered,

205
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:06,939
would instantaneously
cause the Genesis effect.

206
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,941
Instead of a dead moon,

207
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,443
a living, breathing
planet now exists,

208
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:13,486
capable of sustaining
whatever life forms

209
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,488
we see fit
to deposit on it.

210
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,543
So?

211
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:34,711
Speak.

212
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,465
Great power
to control...

213
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:41,841
dominate.

214
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:44,177
Speak.

215
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:45,803
Impressive.

216
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,681
They can make
planets.

217
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:49,764
Oh, yes.

218
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:52,267
New cities,
homes in the country,

219
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,059
your woman
at your side,

220
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,811
children playing
at your feet,

221
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:58,313
and overhead, fluttering
in the breeze,

222
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:00,273
the flag
of the Federation.

223
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,149
Charming.

224
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,358
Station.

225
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,526
Yes, my lord.

226
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:09,905
Share this
with no one.

227
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:13,116
Understood,
my lord.

228
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,410
We are going
to this planet.

229
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:20,414
Even as our emissaries negotiate
for peace with the Federation,

230
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:24,917
we will act for the preservation
of our race.

231
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:28,920
We will seize the secret
of this weapon.

232
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:31,922
The secret
of ultimate power!

233
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,008
Success, my lord.

234
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:58,444
We have reached
the destination planet

235
00:19:58,485 --> 00:20:00,945
at.035.

236
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:02,322
Very well,
Lieutenant.

237
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:05,782
Helm, execute
standard orbital approach.

238
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:07,784
Standard orbit.
Aye, sir.

239
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:08,951
Communications.

240
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,954
Send a coded message
for Starfleet Commander-

241
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:13,456
priority one.

242
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:15,457
"Federation science
vessel Grissom

243
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:19,168
"arriving Genesis planet
to begin research.

244
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,794
J.T. Esteban,
commanding."

245
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,963
Aye, sir.
Coding now.

246
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:26,132
Dr. Marcus,
it's your planet.

247
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:28,091
Begin scanning,
please.

248
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:34,180
This is where
the fun begins, Saavik.

249
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:37,182
Just like your father-
so human.

250
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:38,683
All units functional.

251
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,185
Recorders are on.

252
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:41,478
Scanning Sector 1.

253
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:45,147
Foliage in fully-developed
state of growth.

254
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:49,067
Temperature-22.2 Celsius.

255
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,152
Sector 2 indicating
desert terrain.

256
00:20:52,236 --> 00:20:53,695
Minimal vegetation.

257
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:57,323
Temperature-39.4.

258
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:00,659
Sector 3-
subtropical vegetation.

259
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,703
Temperature
decreasing rapidly.

260
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,957
It's snow.

261
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,917
Snow in
the same sector.

262
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:11,543
Fantastic.

263
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:12,794
Fascinating.

264
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:15,921
All the varieties
of Earth's land and weather

265
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:18,048
within
a few hours' walk.

266
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:19,632
Metallic mass.

267
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:22,260
Close-range scan.

268
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,887
A photon tube.

269
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:28,139
Gravitational fields
were in flux.

270
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:30,599
It must have
soft-landed.

271
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,518
In code to Starfleet-

272
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,478
"Captain Spock's tube
located on Genesis' surface."

273
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,564
Yes, sir.
Coding your message.

274
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:44,360
I don't believe it.

275
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,654
What is it?

276
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:50,490
If equipment
is functioning properly,

277
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:53,284
indications are
an animal life form.

278
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:56,620
You said there
wouldn't be any.

279
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:57,871
There shouldn't be any.

280
00:21:57,954 --> 00:21:59,914
Cross-referenced
and verified.

281
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:02,875
An unidentifiable
life form reading.

282
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,293
Shall we advise Starfleet?

283
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:05,961
Wait a minute.

284
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:08,963
We don't know what
we're talking about here.

285
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:10,339
Let's
beam it up.

286
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:11,381
No, you don't.

287
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,883
Regulations
specifically state

288
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,551
nothing shall
be beamed aboard

289
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:17,511
until danger of contamination
has been eliminated.

290
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:20,055
The logical alternative
is obvious.

291
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,056
Beaming down
is permitted.

292
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,684
If the Captain
decides the mission

293
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,227
is vital and reasonably
free of danger.

294
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:30,563
Captain, please, we've got to
find out what it is.

295
00:22:30,646 --> 00:22:31,981
Or who.

296
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:38,737
Absent friends.

297
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:44,073
Admiral, what will happen
to the Enterprise?

298
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:46,075
She's to be
decommissioned.

299
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,077
Will we get
another ship?

300
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:50,078
I can't get
an answer.

301
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,581
Starfleet is
up to its brass

302
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,081
in a galactic
conference.

303
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,084
No one has time
for those who wait.

304
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,753
Sir, about
Dr. McCoy...

305
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,588
how is he?

306
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,547
He's home,
resting comfortably.

307
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,549
Pumped full
of tranquilizers.

308
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:07,550
They say
it's exhaustion.

309
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:10,053
He promised me he'd stay put.
We'll see.

310
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:12,888
Ah, Mr. Scott.

311
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,223
Come.

312
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:26,732
Sarek!

313
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,238
Ambassador, I had no idea
you were here.

314
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,823
You know my crew.

315
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,827
I will speak
with you alone, Kirk.

316
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,578
Please excuse us.

317
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:49,084
Ambassador, I would
have come to Vulcan

318
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,001
to express
my deepest sympathies.

319
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:53,462
Spare me your
human platitudes.

320
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:55,463
I have been
to your government.

321
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:58,466
I've seen the Genesis
information and your own report.

322
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,468
Then you know your son
met his death bravely.

323
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,970
Why did you leave
him on Genesis?

324
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,555
Spock trusted you,

325
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:09,516
and you denied him
his future.

326
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,434
I saw no future.

327
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:14,145
Only his body
was in death.

328
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:17,189
You were the last
one to be with him.

329
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:18,523
Yes, I was.

330
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,151
You should have come
with him to Vulcan.

331
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:22,360
But why?

332
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:25,529
Because
he asked you to.

333
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:28,281
He entrusted you

334
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:30,867
with his
very essence,

335
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,034
with everything
that was not of the body.

336
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:36,204
He asked you
to bring him to us

337
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:39,039
and to bring that
which he gave you-

338
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:43,793
his Katra-
his living spirit.

339
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:47,045
Sir...

340
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:52,091
your son meant more to me
than you can know.

341
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:55,886
I'd have given my life
if it would have saved his.

342
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,139
Believe me, he made
no request of me.

343
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:01,807
He would not have
spoken of it openly.

344
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,642
Then how...

345
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:06,519
Kirk, I must
have your thoughts.

346
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:09,272
May I join your mind?

347
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:13,400
Certainly.

348
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:36,001
He spoke
of your friendship.

349
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:38,795
Yes.

350
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:44,549
Asked you
not to grieve.

351
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:47,551
Yes.

352
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:52,222
The needs
of the many...

353
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,600
outweigh...

354
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:00,312
the needs
of the few.

355
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:02,438
Or the one.

356
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,359
Spock.

357
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,904
I have been...

358
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,824
and always
shall be...

359
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,158
your friend.

360
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,828
Live long...

361
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,496
and prosper.

362
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:25,540
No.

363
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:40,635
Forgive me.

364
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:44,555
It is not here.

365
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:50,059
I had assumed
he mind-melded with you.

366
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,562
It is
the Vulcan way

367
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:55,689
when the body's
end is near.

368
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,232
We were separate.

369
00:26:59,108 --> 00:27:01,068
He couldn't touch me.

370
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,652
I see.

371
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,450
Then everything
that he was...

372
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,453
everything
he knew...

373
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:16,997
is lost.

374
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,798
Please wait.

375
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:33,469
He would have
found a way.

376
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:36,471
If there was
that much at stake,

377
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,556
Spock would have
found a way.

378
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,308
Yes. But how?

379
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:45,144
What if he joined
with someone else?

380
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:51,024
Engine room,
flight recorder visual.

381
00:27:51,107 --> 00:27:53,818
Stardate 8128. 78.

382
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:54,985
Go.

383
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,988
The ship...

384
00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:00,323
out of danger?

385
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:03,450
Yes.

386
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,744
Back.77.

387
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:10,414
Flight recorder
visual 28. 77.

388
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:11,624
Go.

389
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:14,125
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment.

390
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,126
He'll die.

391
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,337
He's dead already.

392
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,421
Back.76.

393
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,052
Flight recorder
visual 28. 76.

394
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:28,178
Go.

395
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:31,431
You're not
going in there.

396
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:32,932
Perhaps you're right.

397
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,434
What is Mr. Scott's
condition?

398
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:36,935
I don't think he-

399
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:38,436
Sorry, Doctor,

400
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,979
I have no time
to discuss this logically.

401
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:46,234
Freeze.

402
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:48,444
Repeat and augment.

403
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:52,864
Remember.

404
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,285
McCoy!

405
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,453
One alive, one not,

406
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:02,831
yet both in pain.

407
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,915
What must I do?

408
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:08,961
You must bring them
to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.

409
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:12,463
Only there
can both find peace.

410
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:14,423
What you ask...

411
00:29:16,508 --> 00:29:18,510
is difficult.

412
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,762
You will
find a way, Kirk.

413
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,933
If you
honor them both,

414
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,600
you must.

415
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,937
I will.

416
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,939
I swear.

417
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:43,446
Transporter room,
stand by to energize.

418
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,906
Aye, sir.
Energizing now.

419
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:03,795
Grissom to Saavik.

420
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:07,131
We're picking up radiation
from the life form.

421
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:08,466
Affirmative,
Captain.

422
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,967
Our readings are well below
danger level.

423
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,469
Exercise caution,
Lieutenant.

424
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:14,471
This landing
is Captain's discretion,

425
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:17,556
and I'm the one
who's out on a limb.

426
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,891
I'll try
to remember that.

427
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:37,489
There are your
life forms.

428
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:40,991
These were microbes
on the tube's surface.

429
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,993
We shot them here
from Enterprise.

430
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:46,496
They were fruitful
and multiplied.

431
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,498
But how could they have
evolved so quickly?

432
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:03,634
Saavik.

433
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:16,477
What is it?

434
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,646
Spock's burial robe.

435
00:31:24,526 --> 00:31:28,153
Aaahhh...

436
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,574
Aaahhh...

437
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:37,160
No. Absolutely not,
Jim.

438
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:38,620
You're
my best officer,

439
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:40,496
but I am Commander-
Starfleet,

440
00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:42,498
so I don't
break rules.

441
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:43,999
Don't quote rules.

442
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:47,001
I'm talking about
loyalty and sacrifice.

443
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:49,837
One man
who's died for us,

444
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,714
another with
emotional problems.

445
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:54,841
This business about
Spock and McCoy-

446
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:57,802
honestly, I never understood
Vulcan mysticism.

447
00:31:57,885 --> 00:32:00,387
You don't
have to believe.

448
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,514
I'm not even sure
that I believe.

449
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:05,933
But if there's
even a chance

450
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:08,268
that Spock has
an eternal soul,

451
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,061
then it's
my responsibility.

452
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:11,604
Yours?

453
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:16,442
As surely as if
it were my very own.

454
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,944
Give me back
the Enterprise.

455
00:32:19,986 --> 00:32:21,945
With Scotty's help-

456
00:32:22,028 --> 00:32:24,448
No. The Enterprise would never
stand the pounding.

457
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:27,450
Then I'll find a ship.
I'll hire a ship.

458
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:28,951
Out of the question.

459
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:30,453
The council
has ordered

460
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:33,329
that no one
but the science team

461
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:34,706
goes to Genesis.

462
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:37,249
Jim, your life
and your career

463
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:38,751
stand
for rationality,

464
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:41,002
not for
intellectual chaos.

465
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,962
Keep up this
emotional behavior,

466
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,464
and you'll lose
everything.

467
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,506
You'll destroy
yourself.

468
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,592
Do you
understand me, Jim?

469
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,136
I hear you.

470
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,472
I had to try.

471
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:57,474
Of course.

472
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:59,100
Thanks for the drink.

473
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:00,476
Anytime.

474
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,649
The word, sir?

475
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:10,942
The word is no.

476
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:12,944
I am therefore
going anyway.

477
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:14,945
You can
count on our help.

478
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:16,447
Thank you.
I'll need it.

479
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,948
Shall I alert
Dr. McCoy?

480
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:20,658
Please. He has a long
journey ahead of him.

481
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:45,970
Long time, Doc.

482
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:49,390
Yeah. Anybody been
looking for me?

483
00:33:49,473 --> 00:33:52,183
I have.
What will it be?

484
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:53,935
Altair water.

485
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:56,186
That's not your
usual poison.

486
00:33:57,562 --> 00:34:01,816
To expect one to order
poison in a bar

487
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:03,275
is not logical.

488
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:05,443
Got it.

489
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:18,413
To your planet,
welcome.

490
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:23,792
I think that's
my line, stranger.

491
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,418
Oh, forgive.

492
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,586
I here am new.

493
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,754
But you are known,

494
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,049
being McCoy
from Enterprise.

495
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:37,428
You have me
at a disadvantage, sir.

496
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:39,429
I name
not important.

497
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,264
You seek l.

498
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:43,598
Message received.

499
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:46,643
Available ship
stands by.

500
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:50,021
How much and how soon?

501
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:52,105
How soon is now.

502
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:54,941
How much is where.

503
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:58,944
Somewhere in
the Mutara sector.

504
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:01,779
Oh...
Mutara restricted.

505
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:03,865
Take permits many.

506
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:06,117
Money more.

507
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:09,369
There aren't going
to be any damn permits.

508
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,370
How can you get a permit

509
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:13,372
to do a damn
illegal thing?

510
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:15,707
Look, price you name.

511
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,125
Money I got.

512
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,710
Place you name.

513
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:20,377
Money I name.

514
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:23,005
Otherwise,
bargain no.

515
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,006
All right, damn it.
It's Genesis.

516
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,509
The name of the place
we're going is Genesis!

517
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,052
Genesis?

518
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:31,386
Yes, Genesis!

519
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:35,056
How can you be deaf
with ears like that?

520
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:37,391
Genesis allowed
is not.

521
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,684
Is planet forbidden.

522
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:41,394
Look,
my backwards friend,

523
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:43,438
Genesis may be
planet forbidden,

524
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,938
but I'm damn well-

525
00:35:46,982 --> 00:35:49,650
Sir, your voice
is carrying.

526
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:52,403
You don't want to discuss
this subject in public.

527
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:54,446
I'll discuss
what I like!

528
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:56,448
Who the hell
are you?

529
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,450
Could I offer you
a ride home, Dr. McCoy?

530
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:02,370
Where's the logic?
lf I wanted a ride home,

531
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,997
would I be chartering
a space flight?

532
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,416
How do you know
who I am?

533
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,794
Federation
security, sir.

534
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:22,510
You're going to get
a nice long rest, Doctor.

535
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:46,904
Saavik to Grissom.

536
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:50,073
We are definitely reading
a second life form.

537
00:36:50,156 --> 00:36:51,408
We concur.

538
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:53,410
Proceed with
caution, Saavik.

539
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,830
What the hell
is going on down there?

540
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:00,415
Make it quick,
Admiral.

541
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:03,875
They're moving him
to the Federation funny farm.

542
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,377
Poor friend.

543
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:07,879
I hear he's fruity
as a nutcake.

544
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:08,879
Two minutes.

545
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:16,553
Jim!

546
00:37:16,594 --> 00:37:18,846
How many fingers
do I have up?

547
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:20,889
That's not very funny.

548
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:22,932
You're sense
of humor's returned.

549
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:25,268
The hell it has.
What's that?

550
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,269
Lexorin.

551
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,478
Lexorin? What for?

552
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:32,148
You're suffering from a Vulcan
mind-meld, Doctor.

553
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:35,109
That green-blooded
son of a bitch!

554
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:39,154
It's his revenge for
those arguments he lost.

555
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:40,905
Let's see your hand.

556
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:44,533
This will make you
well enough to travel.

557
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:49,120
Where's Admiral Kirk?

558
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:50,620
He's with
the prisoner.

559
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:52,122
Get him quickly.

560
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:54,624
Commander Starfleet
wants him right away.

561
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,629
Oh, hum.

562
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:01,212
Keeping you busy?

563
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:10,303
Don't get smart, Tiny.

564
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:11,763
Admiral, Starfleet-

565
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:14,264
This man's sick.
Take a look.

566
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:19,268
Side elevator.

567
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,770
Agents coming up.

568
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:32,112
Don't call me Tiny.

569
00:38:35,657 --> 00:38:37,116
The Kobayashi Maru

570
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,285
has set sail
for the promised land.

571
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:41,745
Acknowledge.

572
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:45,122
Message acknowledged.
All units will be informed.

573
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:48,375
You're taking me to
the promised land?

574
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,918
What are friends for?

575
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:01,052
Ah, Mr. Scott.
Calling it a night?

576
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:02,427
Uh, yes, sir.

577
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:06,555
Looking forward to breaking
some speed records tomorrow.

578
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,474
Yes, sir.
Good night.

579
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,059
Level, please.

580
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,560
Transporter room.

581
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:13,728
Thank you.

582
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,229
Up your shaft.

583
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:21,067
Roger. Old City Station
at 2200 hours. All is well.

584
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,069
Understood.
All stations clear.

585
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,070
You amaze me,
Commander.

586
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:26,571
How is that?

587
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,323
A 20-year space veteran,

588
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,742
yet you choose
the worst duty station.

589
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:35,245
This is
the hind end of space.

590
00:39:35,328 --> 00:39:38,039
Peace and quiet
appeals to me, Lieutenant.

591
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:40,541
Maybe that's okay
for someone like you,

592
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:43,210
whose career
is winding down.

593
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:47,213
But me, I need some challenge
and adventure in my life.

594
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:49,631
Maybe even
just a surprise.

595
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:52,134
You know
what they say.

596
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:54,135
Be careful
what you wish for.

597
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:55,636
You may get it.

598
00:39:57,637 --> 00:40:00,599
Good evening, Commander.
Is everything ready?

599
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:04,101
Step into my parlor,
gentlemen.

600
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:06,145
That's Admiral Kirk.
My God!

601
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,146
Very good for you,
Lieutenant.

602
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:10,148
But it's damn irregular.

603
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:13,150
No destination orders,
no encoded IDs.

604
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:14,151
All true.

605
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:15,652
What'll we do?

606
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:17,653
I'm not doing anything.

607
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:20,573
You're going to sit
in the closet.

608
00:40:20,656 --> 00:40:21,698
The closet?

609
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:23,658
Have you lost
all your sense of reality?

610
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,826
This isn't reality.

611
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:28,954
This is fantasy.

612
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:31,331
You wanted adventure.
How's this?

613
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:33,082
The old
adrenaline going?

614
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,250
Good. Now get
in the closet.

615
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:37,210
Okay.

616
00:40:37,294 --> 00:40:38,670
Uh...

617
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:40,171
Go on. Go on.

618
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:42,632
I'll just get
in the closet.

619
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:43,674
Okay!

620
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:49,553
I'm glad
you're on our side.

621
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:52,556
I'll have Mr. Adventure
eating out of my hand,

622
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,558
and I'll see you
at the rendezvous.

623
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,018
Oh, and, Admiral...

624
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:00,354
All my hopes.

625
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,079
As promised,
she's all yours, sir.

626
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,580
All systems
automated and ready.

627
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:26,749
A chimpanzee
and two trainees could run her.

628
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:30,169
I'll try not
to take that personally.

629
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:35,882
My friends, I can't ask
you to go any further.

630
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:38,384
Dr. McCoy and I
have to do this.

631
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:40,386
The rest of you do not.

632
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:43,721
Admiral, we're losing
precious time.

633
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:45,431
What course,
please, Admiral?

634
00:41:46,848 --> 00:41:48,350
Mr. Scott?

635
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:51,435
I'd be grateful
if you'd give the word.

636
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:56,106
Gentlemen...

637
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:59,359
May the wind
be at our backs.

638
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:00,401
Stations, please.

639
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:05,071
Engage all the systems.

640
00:42:05,113 --> 00:42:06,573
Aye. Engaged!

641
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:08,408
Clear all moorings.

642
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:09,533
Clearing, sir.

643
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:11,535
One quarter
impulse power.

644
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:13,579
One quarter impulse.

645
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,172
Sir.

646
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:30,174
Commander Starfleet
orders you

647
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,634
to surrender this vessel.

648
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,094
No reply, Chekov.

649
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:36,179
Steady as she goes.

650
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:44,436
Yellow alert.
Captain to the bridge.

651
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:45,478
Yellow alert.

652
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:50,065
How can you have
a yellow alert in spacedock?

653
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:54,110
Sir, someone is stealing
the Enterprise!

654
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,613
I'm on my way.

655
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:00,115
Alert. Yellow alert.

656
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:02,533
All stations,
yellow alert.

657
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:04,535
Alert. Yellow alert.

658
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,411
All stations,
yellow alert.

659
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:12,833
One minute to space doors.

660
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,543
Are you just going
to walk through?

661
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,253
Calm yourself, Doctor.

662
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:28,512
Sir, Excelsior powering up
with orders to pursue.

663
00:43:28,596 --> 00:43:30,055
Yellow alert.

664
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:32,390
Status?

665
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:35,142
All automates ready
and functioning.

666
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,560
Automatic moorings
retracted.

667
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:38,062
All speeds available

668
00:43:38,145 --> 00:43:39,562
through
transwarp drive.

669
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:41,064
Incredible machine.

670
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:44,024
Helm.

671
00:43:46,068 --> 00:43:48,027
One quarter
impulse power.

672
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:56,826
30 seconds
to space doors.

673
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,911
Warning.
Secure space doors.

674
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:02,830
Warning.
Secure space doors.

675
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:05,959
And...now,
Mr. Scott.

676
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,251
Sir?

677
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:08,794
The doors,
Mr. Scott.

678
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:11,128
Aye, sir.
I'm working on it.

679
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,092
Danger.
Space doors are closed.

680
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:21,804
Danger.
Space doors are closed.

681
00:44:46,323 --> 00:44:48,576
We have cleared
space doors.

682
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:03,670
Full impulse power.

683
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:05,005
Aye, sir.

684
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,512
Standby tractor beam.

685
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:16,014
Tractor beam, aye.

686
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:19,808
If he tries to get away
with warp drive,

687
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,560
he's really in
for a shock.

688
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:38,448
Excelsior closing
to 4,000 meters.

689
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:40,158
We'll need everything
you have.

690
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:42,618
Aye, sir.
Warp drive standing by.

691
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,245
Kirk, if you do this,

692
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:50,081
you'll never sit in
the captain's chair again.

693
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,875
Warp speed.

694
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,211
Aye, sir.

695
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:56,086
Warp speed.

696
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,049
Prepare for warp speed.

697
00:46:01,132 --> 00:46:02,800
Standby transwarp drive.

698
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:09,096
Transwarp
at your command.

699
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,264
Full power available.

700
00:46:10,348 --> 00:46:11,265
Execute.

701
00:46:18,604 --> 00:46:20,022
...Power available...

702
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:26,277
Transwarp drive,
full...power... available....

703
00:46:36,118 --> 00:46:37,536
Transwarp drive,

704
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:42,540
maximum velocity
in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

705
00:46:50,755 --> 00:46:53,549
Scotty, as good
as your word.

706
00:46:53,632 --> 00:46:56,050
The more they over think
the plumbing,

707
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:59,053
the easier it is
to stop up the drain.

708
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:01,555
Here, Doctor, souvenirs
from one surgeon to another.

709
00:47:01,638 --> 00:47:05,599
I removed them from her
transwarp computer drive.

710
00:47:05,683 --> 00:47:09,019
Nice of you
to tell me in advance.

711
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:11,521
You shouldn't miss
staff meetings.

712
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:13,523
Your work today
has been outstanding.

713
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:16,024
I'll recommend you all
for promotion...

714
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,026
in whatever fleet
we end up serving.

715
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,862
Best speed to Genesis.

716
00:48:37,672 --> 00:48:39,465
The Genesis wave.

717
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:42,510
His cells could have
been regenerated.

718
00:48:46,054 --> 00:48:47,972
Captain,
this is Saavik.

719
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:49,389
Come in, please.

720
00:48:49,473 --> 00:48:50,974
Yes, Saavik.
Go ahead.

721
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,976
We have found
the life sign.

722
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,728
It is a Vulcan child,

723
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,146
perhaps 8-10 Earth
years of age.

724
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,315
A child?
How did he get there?

725
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:04,401
It's Dr. Marcus' opinion
that this is...

726
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,405
that the Genesis effect
has regenerated...

727
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,032
Captain Spock.

728
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,411
Uh...

729
00:49:17,495 --> 00:49:19,455
Saavik, that's, uh...

730
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:20,957
That's extraordinary.

731
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:23,208
What will you do next?

732
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:26,126
Request permission
to beam aboard immediately.

733
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,421
Does Dr. Marcus think
there's any chance

734
00:49:29,505 --> 00:49:31,422
of radioactive
contamination?

735
00:49:31,464 --> 00:49:32,966
No.

736
00:49:33,007 --> 00:49:34,968
None that he can detect.

737
00:49:35,009 --> 00:49:38,303
I'll advise Starfleet
and get instructions.

738
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,805
I'm sure Starfleet
would approve.

739
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:44,058
Probably true,
but let's follow rules.

740
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:46,393
Stand by
on this channel.

741
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:47,602
Go.

742
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:50,479
Starfleet Command,
this is U.S.S. Grissom

743
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:52,481
on subspace
coded channel 98.8.

744
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,315
Come in, please.

745
00:50:00,362 --> 00:50:02,322
Something is jamming
our transmission.

746
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:03,865
An energy surge.

747
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:04,991
Locate.

748
00:50:08,535 --> 00:50:10,328
It's from astern,
Captain.

749
00:50:14,331 --> 00:50:16,041
Oh, my God!

750
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,342
Captain,
what is happening?

751
00:50:28,384 --> 00:50:29,886
We're under attack!

752
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:31,512
Stand by for evasive.

753
00:50:31,554 --> 00:50:32,512
Bah!

754
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:54,780
May I suggest-

755
00:50:54,864 --> 00:50:56,907
Say the wrong thing!

756
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,576
If you
want prisoners,

757
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:01,535
there are
life signs there.

758
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,871
Perhaps the very
scientists you seek.

759
00:51:03,913 --> 00:51:05,455
Very good.

760
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:07,457
Grissom,
this is Saavik

761
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,958
on emergency frequency.

762
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,459
Come in, please.

763
00:51:13,796 --> 00:51:15,546
What happened
to them?

764
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:19,424
Grissom was destroyed
by an enemy attack.

765
00:51:20,967 --> 00:51:22,469
We must go.

766
00:51:22,552 --> 00:51:24,970
They will soon
come after us.

767
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:33,477
Estimating Genesis,
2.9 hours, present speed.

768
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,479
Can we hold speed?

769
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:38,481
Aye. She's got
her second wind.

770
00:51:38,564 --> 00:51:40,983
Scan for vessels
in pursuit.

771
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:43,985
Scanning.
Indications negative at this time.

772
00:51:48,823 --> 00:51:51,866
Well, did I
get it right?

773
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,953
Great, Bones,
just great.

774
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:29,646
It's time for total
truth between us.

775
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,649
This planet is not
what you intended

776
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,900
or hoped for, is it?

777
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:37,820
Not exactly.

778
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:39,737
Why?

779
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:44,241
I used protomatter
in the Genesis matrix.

780
00:52:44,324 --> 00:52:45,492
Protomatter.

781
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:46,994
An unstable substance

782
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:49,495
which every ethical scientist
in the galaxy

783
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:51,914
has denounced as
dangerously unpredictable.

784
00:52:51,956 --> 00:52:55,250
It was the only way
to solve certain problems.

785
00:52:55,292 --> 00:53:00,004
So, like your father,
you changed the rules.

786
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:01,505
If I hadn't,

787
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:04,924
it might have
been years or never.

788
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:08,552
How many have paid the price
for your impatience?

789
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:10,679
How many have died?

790
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:13,556
How much damage
have you done?

791
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:15,433
And what is
yet to come?

792
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,190
This planet's aging
in surges.

793
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,067
And Spock with it.

794
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,068
It seems
they' rejoined together.

795
00:55:15,152 --> 00:55:16,319
They are.

796
00:55:16,403 --> 00:55:18,654
How long?

797
00:55:18,696 --> 00:55:20,406
Days...

798
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:23,199
maybe hours.

799
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:27,287
I'm sorry.

800
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,791
It will be
hardest on Spock.

801
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:38,920
Soon he will feel the burning
of his Vulcan blood.

802
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:40,172
I don't understand.

803
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:41,672
Pon Farr.

804
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:44,175
Vulcan males
must endure it

805
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,510
every seventh year
of their adult life.

806
00:55:55,309 --> 00:55:57,393
Whoever they are,
they're getting closer.

807
00:55:57,435 --> 00:55:58,394
I'll go.

808
00:55:58,436 --> 00:56:00,146
No.

809
00:56:00,229 --> 00:56:01,813
I'll do it.

810
00:56:01,897 --> 00:56:04,066
Give me
your phaser.

811
00:56:12,113 --> 00:56:14,823
Sir, Starfleet
calling U.S.S. Grissom.

812
00:56:14,907 --> 00:56:16,909
A warning about us.

813
00:56:16,992 --> 00:56:18,077
Response?

814
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,579
Nothing, as before.

815
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,832
What's the Grissom
up to?

816
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,834
Will she join us
or fire on us?

817
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:33,047
Break silence. Send
Captain Esteban my compliments.

818
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,422
Aye, sir.

819
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,718
How are we doing?

820
00:56:39,802 --> 00:56:41,220
How are we doing?

821
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:45,223
It's funny you should
put it quite that way, Jim.

822
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:46,724
We are doing fine,

823
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:50,310
but I'd feel safer giving him
one of my kidneys

824
00:56:50,394 --> 00:56:52,770
than what's scrambled
in my brain.

825
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:56,273
Admiral, there's no response
from Grissom on any channel.

826
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:00,110
Keep trying, Chekov...

827
00:57:00,193 --> 00:57:01,735
at regular intervals.

828
00:57:35,345 --> 00:57:38,265
It is called Pon Farr.

829
00:57:40,474 --> 00:57:42,435
Pon Farr.

830
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,040
We are secured
for warp speed.

831
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:04,665
Now entering
Genesis sector.

832
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,001
Proceed at impulse power.

833
00:59:18,635 --> 00:59:21,554
Vessel entering
sector.

834
00:59:21,638 --> 00:59:25,182
Yes. Federation
battle cruiser.

835
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:26,725
Have they scanned us?

836
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,559
Not yet.

837
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:29,936
Ahh.

838
00:59:56,081 --> 00:59:59,000
I'd swear there
was something there, sir.

839
00:59:59,084 --> 01:00:01,585
What did you see?

840
01:00:01,669 --> 01:00:06,631
For an instant,
a scout-class vessel.

841
01:00:06,673 --> 01:00:08,341
Could be Grissom.

842
01:00:08,425 --> 01:00:10,426
Patch in
a hailing frequency.

843
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:17,098
Grissom, this is
Enterprise calling.

844
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:19,016
Please come in.

845
01:00:23,644 --> 01:00:27,106
Grissom, this is
Enterprise calling.

846
01:00:27,148 --> 01:00:28,606
Do you read?

847
01:00:28,648 --> 01:00:30,150
Yiahuq!

848
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:31,443
Spock!

849
01:00:41,242 --> 01:00:42,409
Dah!

850
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:46,705
I've come a long way
for the power of Genesis,

851
01:00:46,788 --> 01:00:50,207
and what do I find?

852
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:52,292
A weakling human,

853
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,835
a Vulcan boy,

854
01:00:53,877 --> 01:00:55,503
and a woman.

855
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:58,714
My lord, we are survivors
of a doomed expedition.

856
01:00:58,797 --> 01:01:01,716
This planet will
destroy itself in hours.

857
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:03,676
The Genesis experiment
is a failure.

858
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:05,053
A failure.

859
01:01:05,136 --> 01:01:10,556
The most powerful destructive
force ever created.

860
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:20,981
You will tell me the secret
of the Genesis torpedo.

861
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:23,025
I have no knowledge.

862
01:01:23,067 --> 01:01:27,779
Then I hope pain is
something you enjoy.

863
01:01:29,655 --> 01:01:30,614
Johwi'.

864
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:34,408
I ordered
no interruptions!

865
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:36,994
But, sir, Federation
starship approaching.

866
01:01:37,078 --> 01:01:38,828
Bring me up.

867
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,497
Grissom...

868
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,499
this is Enterprise
calling.

869
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:43,999
Do you read?

870
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:48,503
Grissom, this is
Enterprise calling.

871
01:01:48,586 --> 01:01:50,171
Please come in.

872
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:56,718
Grissom.

873
01:01:56,802 --> 01:01:58,719
This is Admiral Kirk

874
01:01:58,803 --> 01:02:01,722
calling Captain Esteban
or Lieutenant Saavik.

875
01:02:01,806 --> 01:02:03,223
Please come in.

876
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:04,724
Report status.

877
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,226
We are cloaked.

878
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:08,727
Enemy closing
on impulse power.

879
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:10,229
Range,
5,000 kellicams.

880
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:11,522
Good.

881
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:15,608
This is the turn of luck
I've been waiting for.

882
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:24,740
Nothing
on my scanner.

883
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,325
Short range scan,
Mr. Chekov.

884
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:30,286
Put it on visual,
Mr. Sulu.

885
01:02:35,248 --> 01:02:37,875
Range, 3,000 kellicams.

886
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:39,918
Steady.

887
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,130
Continue on
impulse power.

888
01:02:45,923 --> 01:02:48,843
Range, 2,000 kellicams.

889
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:53,763
Stand by to transfer
energy to weapons...

890
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:57,599
at my command.

891
01:03:05,939 --> 01:03:06,940
There.

892
01:03:08,316 --> 01:03:10,318
That distortion.
See it?

893
01:03:10,401 --> 01:03:13,278
It's enlarging
as we close in.

894
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,447
Firing range, sir.

895
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:34,003
Opinion, Mr. Sulu.

896
01:03:34,086 --> 01:03:36,379
It's an
energy surge.

897
01:03:36,463 --> 01:03:37,881
Enough to hide
a ship?

898
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:39,215
A cloaking device.

899
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:41,759
Red alert,
Mr. Scott.

900
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:43,677
Aye, sir.

901
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:46,804
1,000 kellicams,
closing.

902
01:03:46,888 --> 01:03:49,015
Power to
weapons systems.

903
01:03:49,098 --> 01:03:50,557
Wait.

904
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:52,643
Wait.

905
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:54,394
No shields?

906
01:03:54,478 --> 01:03:56,062
My guess is right.

907
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:58,481
They have to decloak
before firing.

908
01:03:58,564 --> 01:04:01,191
May all your
guesses be right.

909
01:04:01,232 --> 01:04:03,860
Vaq valis qeliqap.

910
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:06,528
Tyrusch.

911
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:08,072
Shoha!

912
01:04:13,992 --> 01:04:16,411
Klingon bird of prey, sir.
She's arming torpedoes.

913
01:04:16,495 --> 01:04:17,537
Fire!

914
01:04:26,169 --> 01:04:28,879
Good shooting, Mr. Scott.

915
01:04:32,674 --> 01:04:34,300
Precautionary,
Mr. Chekov.

916
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:35,843
Shields up.

917
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:37,302
Aye, sir.

918
01:04:42,264 --> 01:04:44,809
Emergency power

919
01:04:44,892 --> 01:04:47,268
to the thrusters!

920
01:04:49,562 --> 01:04:52,064
Sir, the shield's
nonresponsive.

921
01:04:52,147 --> 01:04:53,524
Scotty?

922
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:55,276
The automation system's
overloaded.

923
01:04:55,317 --> 01:04:58,111
I didn't expect
to go into combat.

924
01:05:00,405 --> 01:05:01,863
Bah!

925
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:14,708
Emergency power.

926
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,792
Prepare to return fire.

927
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:21,379
Can you transfer power
to the phaser banks?

928
01:05:21,462 --> 01:05:23,631
I don't think so.

929
01:05:23,673 --> 01:05:25,007
What happened?

930
01:05:25,048 --> 01:05:27,384
They've knocked out
the automation center.

931
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:29,051
I've got no control.

932
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:30,469
Mr. Sulu?

933
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:32,013
Nothing, sir.

934
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,601
So...

935
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,269
we're a sitting duck.

936
01:05:44,105 --> 01:05:46,524
Ready to fire
emergency tube.

937
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:53,154
Why haven't they
finished us?

938
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:55,740
They outgun me
10 to 1.

939
01:05:55,823 --> 01:05:59,534
My lord, the enemy
commander wishes a truce.

940
01:05:59,576 --> 01:06:02,202
Put him on-screen.

941
01:06:02,286 --> 01:06:05,164
This is Admiral
James T. Kirk

942
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:07,206
of Federation starship
Enterprise.

943
01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:12,502
So...the Genesis
commander himself.

944
01:06:12,586 --> 01:06:14,546
A violation of treaty-

945
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:18,674
your presence here
is an act of war.

946
01:06:18,758 --> 01:06:21,718
You have two minutes
to surrender,

947
01:06:21,801 --> 01:06:24,304
or we will destroy you.

948
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:25,763
He's hiding
something.

949
01:06:25,804 --> 01:06:28,307
We may have hit him

950
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:30,767
more seriously
than I thought.

951
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:32,810
How can you tell?

952
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:34,853
I trust
my instincts.

953
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:37,898
Admiral Kirk, this is
your opponent speaking.

954
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,775
Don't lecture me
about treaty violations.

955
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:43,778
The Federation, in creating
an ultimate weapon,

956
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:47,197
has become a gang
of intergalactic criminals.

957
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,199
It is you
who will surrender.

958
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:01,291
On the planet below,

959
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:03,334
I have three prisoners

960
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:08,755
from the team who developed
your doomsday weapon.

961
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:11,424
If you do not
surrender immediately,

962
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:13,759
I will execute them
one at a time

963
01:07:13,842 --> 01:07:15,678
as enemies
of galactic peace!

964
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,053
Who is this?

965
01:07:17,136 --> 01:07:18,805
How dare you
take prisoners?

966
01:07:18,888 --> 01:07:21,599
Who I am
isn't important.

967
01:07:21,682 --> 01:07:25,102
That I
have them is.

968
01:07:25,185 --> 01:07:28,145
I will allow you
to speak to them.

969
01:07:32,023 --> 01:07:34,776
Admiral, this is
Lieutenant Saavik.

970
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:35,859
Saavik!

971
01:07:35,943 --> 01:07:38,153
Is David with you?

972
01:07:38,195 --> 01:07:40,822
Yes. Also
a Vulcan scientist

973
01:07:40,905 --> 01:07:42,907
of your acquaintance.

974
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:47,953
This...

975
01:07:48,036 --> 01:07:49,162
Vulcan...

976
01:07:51,664 --> 01:07:53,374
Is he alive?

977
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:56,209
He's not himself,
but he lives.

978
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:59,045
He's subject
to rapid aging.

979
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:01,672
Hello, sir.
It's David.

980
01:08:01,755 --> 01:08:04,215
I'm sorry I'm late.

981
01:08:04,299 --> 01:08:07,552
I should've
known you'd come.

982
01:08:07,635 --> 01:08:10,971
This planet will
destroy itself in hours.

983
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:12,889
David,
what went wrong?

984
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:15,725
I went wrong.

985
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:17,476
I don't understand.

986
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,437
Just don't surrender.
Genesis doesn't work.

987
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:24,690
I can't believe
they'd kill us for it.

988
01:08:24,773 --> 01:08:27,483
I meant
what I said.

989
01:08:27,567 --> 01:08:30,987
To show that my intentions
are sincere,

990
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,114
I shall kill one
of the prisoners.

991
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,325
Wait!
Allow me to talk.

992
01:09:20,943 --> 01:09:22,027
Saavik?

993
01:09:26,113 --> 01:09:27,448
David?

994
01:09:30,951 --> 01:09:34,161
Admiral,
David is dead.

995
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:48,339
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son.

996
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:58,347
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son.

997
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:11,274
You Klingon bastard!

998
01:10:11,357 --> 01:10:15,361
There are two more
prisoners, Admiral.

999
01:10:15,403 --> 01:10:19,197
Do you want
them killed, too?

1000
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:21,240
Surrender your vessel.

1001
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:26,035
All right.

1002
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:27,537
All right, damn you.

1003
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,039
All right.

1004
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:39,421
Give me a minute
to inform my crew.

1005
01:10:39,462 --> 01:10:41,256
I give two minutes

1006
01:10:41,298 --> 01:10:43,883
for you and your
gallant crew.

1007
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:54,808
Take every last man.

1008
01:10:54,892 --> 01:10:56,977
Form a boarding
party armed heavily.

1009
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,144
They outnumber us.

1010
01:10:58,227 --> 01:10:59,645
We are Klingons!

1011
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,647
Once you control
the ship,

1012
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:03,648
we'll transfer
our flag there

1013
01:11:03,732 --> 01:11:07,860
and take Genesis from their own
memory banks.

1014
01:11:17,492 --> 01:11:18,660
Mr. Sulu,

1015
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:21,038
what is the crew complement
of a bird of prey?

1016
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:24,290
About a dozen
officers and men.

1017
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:27,334
With some of them
on the planet.

1018
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,380
I swear to you,
we're not finished yet.

1019
01:11:33,464 --> 01:11:36,341
Bones, you and Sulu
to the transporter room.

1020
01:11:36,382 --> 01:11:40,344
The rest of you,
we have a job to do.

1021
01:11:41,553 --> 01:11:44,515
Commander,
Klingon vessel...

1022
01:11:44,556 --> 01:11:47,517
Prepare to board
on my next signal.

1023
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,935
No tricks, Kirk.

1024
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,062
You have one minute.

1025
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:54,355
No tricks.

1026
01:11:55,731 --> 01:11:58,067
I'm looking
forward to meeting you.

1027
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:16,915
Computer, this is
Admiral James T. Kirk.

1028
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:18,582
Request security access.

1029
01:12:22,293 --> 01:12:25,380
Computer,
destruct sequence one,

1030
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:28,173
code 1-1 a.

1031
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:39,140
Computer, Commander Montgomery
Scott, chief engineering officer.

1032
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:44,937
Destruct sequence two,
code 1-1 a-2b.

1033
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:53,277
Computer, this is
Commander Pavel Chekov,

1034
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,403
acting science officer.

1035
01:12:55,486 --> 01:12:58,573
Destruct sequence three,

1036
01:12:58,656 --> 01:13:02,909
code 1 b-2b-3.

1037
01:13:02,993 --> 01:13:06,829
Destruct sequence
completed and engaged.

1038
01:13:06,912 --> 01:13:09,330
Awaiting final code
for one-minute countdown.

1039
01:13:09,414 --> 01:13:14,459
Code zero zero zero.

1040
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:17,713
Destruct.

1041
01:13:17,796 --> 01:13:19,088
Zero.

1042
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:23,967
Destruct sequence
is activated.

1043
01:13:32,349 --> 01:13:35,685
Kirk, the time
runs out.

1044
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:37,312
All set?

1045
01:13:37,353 --> 01:13:38,562
Aye, sir.

1046
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:42,481
Commander,
Klingon vessel.

1047
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:45,484
We are energizing
transporter beam now.

1048
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,653
Transporter, stand by.

1049
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,959
Hara.

1050
01:14:34,606 --> 01:14:37,859
My lord, the ship appears
to be deserted.

1051
01:14:37,943 --> 01:14:41,195
How can that be?
They're hiding!

1052
01:14:41,278 --> 01:14:44,364
The bridge
is run by computer.

1053
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:46,616
It's the only
thing speaking.

1054
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:48,700
Speaking?

1055
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,118
Let me hear.

1056
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,997
9...8...7...6...

1057
01:14:55,081 --> 01:14:56,582
5...

1058
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,626
Get out!
Get out of there!

1059
01:14:59,668 --> 01:15:00,961
1...

1060
01:15:56,171 --> 01:16:00,257
My God, Bones,
what have I done?

1061
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,385
What you had to do.
What you always do.

1062
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:08,096
Turn death into
a fighting chance to live.

1063
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:12,850
Planet core readings.

1064
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:15,644
Unstable,
changing rapidly.

1065
01:16:17,353 --> 01:16:19,147
What about
surface life signs?

1066
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,566
There.

1067
01:16:36,035 --> 01:16:39,872
Yaaa!

1068
01:16:58,011 --> 01:17:00,179
Aah!

1069
01:17:10,062 --> 01:17:12,064
No, don't
touch him.

1070
01:18:04,272 --> 01:18:05,647
Bones.

1071
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,803
What happened?

1072
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,805
He gave his life
to save us.

1073
01:18:51,851 --> 01:18:53,310
Rapid aging.

1074
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:56,313
All genetic functions
highly accelerated.

1075
01:18:56,354 --> 01:18:57,980
What about his mind?

1076
01:18:58,063 --> 01:18:59,482
His mind's a void.

1077
01:18:59,565 --> 01:19:03,651
It seems I've got
all his marbles.

1078
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:05,820
Is there anything
we can do?

1079
01:19:05,904 --> 01:19:08,739
Only one thing-
get him off this planet.

1080
01:19:08,822 --> 01:19:12,909
His aging is part
of what's going on around us.

1081
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:40,931
Klingon Commander, this is
Admiral James T. Kirk.

1082
01:19:41,014 --> 01:19:43,891
I'm alive and well
on the planet surface.

1083
01:19:43,974 --> 01:19:47,019
I know this will come
as a pleasant surprise,

1084
01:19:47,103 --> 01:19:49,938
but our ship had
an unfortunate accident.

1085
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:51,606
Sorry about your crew,

1086
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:54,900
but as we say on Earth,
c'est la vie.

1087
01:19:58,111 --> 01:20:00,071
I have what you want.

1088
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:04,116
I have the secret
of Genesis.

1089
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:10,037
You're going to have to
bring us up there to get it.

1090
01:20:10,121 --> 01:20:11,956
Do you hear me?

1091
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,584
I'm waiting for you.

1092
01:20:18,877 --> 01:20:20,629
What is your answer?

1093
01:20:26,925 --> 01:20:30,178
Aaahhh!

1094
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:38,643
Drop all weapons!

1095
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,481
Over there.
All but Kirk.

1096
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:56,282
Maltz.

1097
01:20:56,365 --> 01:20:58,659
Prisoners are
at beam coordinates.

1098
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:00,326
Take the Vulcan, too.

1099
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,494
No!

1100
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:02,954
But why?

1101
01:21:03,037 --> 01:21:04,538
Because you wish it.

1102
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:21,552
Genesis.
I want it!

1103
01:21:21,594 --> 01:21:24,471
Beam the Vulcan up,

1104
01:21:24,554 --> 01:21:26,473
and we'll talk.

1105
01:21:26,598 --> 01:21:28,390
Give me what I want,

1106
01:21:28,474 --> 01:21:30,350
and I'll consider it.

1107
01:21:30,392 --> 01:21:32,477
You fool,
look around you!

1108
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,187
The planet's
destroying itself!

1109
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:36,855
Yes, exhilarating,
isn't it?

1110
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:40,650
If we don't help each other,
we'll die here.

1111
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:44,361
Perfect. Then that's
the way it shall be.

1112
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,793
Give me Genesis!

1113
01:22:33,775 --> 01:22:34,943
Aah!

1114
01:23:04,508 --> 01:23:05,883
Give me your hand!

1115
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:16,434
I...

1116
01:23:16,517 --> 01:23:18,227
have had...

1117
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:20,186
enough of you!

1118
01:24:34,496 --> 01:24:37,539
Maltz...

1119
01:24:37,623 --> 01:24:39,792
Jolyichu!

1120
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:02,184
Don't.

1121
01:25:02,267 --> 01:25:03,434
How many more?

1122
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:05,228
Just him, sir.

1123
01:25:05,311 --> 01:25:07,563
Bones, help Spock.

1124
01:25:07,647 --> 01:25:10,232
We've got to
break out of orbit.

1125
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:13,025
You,
help us or die.

1126
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:15,695
I do not
deserve to live.

1127
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:18,029
Fine. I'll
kill you later.

1128
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,489
Let's get
out of here.

1129
01:25:30,915 --> 01:25:32,874
Where's the damn
anti-matter inducer?

1130
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:34,084
This?

1131
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:35,794
No, this!

1132
01:25:37,169 --> 01:25:39,255
That or nothing.

1133
01:25:45,468 --> 01:25:48,554
If I'm right,
we have full power.

1134
01:25:48,595 --> 01:25:49,888
Go, Sulu.

1135
01:26:04,066 --> 01:26:05,775
Goodbye, David.

1136
01:26:07,402 --> 01:26:10,112
We are clear
and free to navigate.

1137
01:26:10,195 --> 01:26:11,905
Best speed to Vulcan.

1138
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:13,407
Take the prisoner below.

1139
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:14,407
Aye, sir.

1140
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:17,076
Wait. You said
you would kill me.

1141
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,119
I lied.

1142
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:27,752
Spock,

1143
01:26:27,793 --> 01:26:30,837
for God sakes,
talk to me.

1144
01:26:32,796 --> 01:26:37,258
You stuck this damn thing
in my head, remember?

1145
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,426
Remember?

1146
01:26:41,054 --> 01:26:43,972
Now tell me
what to do with it.

1147
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:47,141
Help me.

1148
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:07,949
I'm going to
tell you something

1149
01:27:07,991 --> 01:27:12,787
that I never thought
I'd ever hear myself say.

1150
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:18,458
But it seems
I've missed you.

1151
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:24,295
I don't know
if I could...

1152
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:27,173
stand to
lose you again.

1153
01:27:43,018 --> 01:27:46,230
Ambassador,
they're on approach.

1154
01:27:46,313 --> 01:27:48,523
They're requesting
permission to land.

1155
01:27:49,983 --> 01:27:51,234
Permission granted.

1156
01:27:51,317 --> 01:27:52,901
Tell them...

1157
01:27:52,985 --> 01:27:54,903
tell Kirk...

1158
01:27:54,987 --> 01:27:56,571
we'll be ready.

1159
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:07,371
Mr. Sulu,
you're on manual.

1160
01:28:07,454 --> 01:28:09,540
It's been a while, sir.

1161
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:10,874
Here we go.

1162
01:28:22,508 --> 01:28:24,760
Retrothrusters.

1163
01:29:10,338 --> 01:29:12,422
Sarek is waiting
above, sir.

1164
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:13,262
Kaltorfalikal.

1165
01:30:15,639 --> 01:30:17,015
Sarek...

1166
01:30:18,975 --> 01:30:21,560
Child of Skon,

1167
01:30:21,644 --> 01:30:23,436
child
of Solkar...

1168
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,816
the body of your son
breathes still.

1169
01:30:30,651 --> 01:30:32,402
What is
your wish?

1170
01:30:32,443 --> 01:30:36,863
I ask for
Fal-tor-pan,

1171
01:30:36,947 --> 01:30:38,198
the re-fusion.

1172
01:30:39,616 --> 01:30:43,869
What you seek has not
been done since ages past...

1173
01:30:43,953 --> 01:30:46,871
and then,
only in legend.

1174
01:30:46,955 --> 01:30:49,916
Your request
is not logical.

1175
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:51,959
Forgive me, T'lar.

1176
01:30:52,042 --> 01:30:57,380
My logic...is uncertain

1177
01:30:57,463 --> 01:30:59,841
where my son
is concerned.

1178
01:31:01,466 --> 01:31:05,219
Who is the keeper
of the Katra?

1179
01:31:05,303 --> 01:31:08,055
I am.

1180
01:31:08,139 --> 01:31:09,515
McCoy,

1181
01:31:09,599 --> 01:31:12,309
Leonard H.,
son of David.

1182
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:15,352
McCoy, son of David,

1183
01:31:15,394 --> 01:31:16,770
since
thou art human,

1184
01:31:16,854 --> 01:31:18,355
we cannot
expect thee

1185
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,148
to understand fully

1186
01:31:20,231 --> 01:31:22,692
what Sarek
has requested.

1187
01:31:22,734 --> 01:31:24,985
Spock's body lives.

1188
01:31:25,027 --> 01:31:26,445
With your approval,

1189
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,904
we shall use
all our powers

1190
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:30,906
to return
to his body

1191
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,325
that which
you possess.

1192
01:31:34,826 --> 01:31:36,077
But, McCoy,

1193
01:31:36,161 --> 01:31:37,871
you must
now be warned.

1194
01:31:37,953 --> 01:31:40,497
The danger
to thyself

1195
01:31:40,581 --> 01:31:44,918
is as grave
as the danger to Spock.

1196
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:50,672
You must
make the choice.

1197
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:55,843
I choose the danger.

1198
01:31:57,886 --> 01:32:00,347
Hell of a time
to ask.

1199
01:32:29,619 --> 01:32:35,749
Ben... val...navu.

1200
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,707
I'm all right, Jim.

1201
01:35:16,626 --> 01:35:18,670
What about Spock?

1202
01:35:18,752 --> 01:35:21,713
Only time
will answer.

1203
01:35:24,632 --> 01:35:26,717
Kirk...

1204
01:35:26,801 --> 01:35:28,176
I thank you.

1205
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:29,344
What you
have done-

1206
01:35:29,427 --> 01:35:30,720
What I have done...

1207
01:35:30,804 --> 01:35:33,389
I had to do.

1208
01:35:33,472 --> 01:35:35,808
But at what cost?

1209
01:35:35,849 --> 01:35:38,351
Your ship, your son.

1210
01:35:39,852 --> 01:35:42,479
If I hadn't tried,

1211
01:35:42,521 --> 01:35:44,565
the cost would've
been my soul.

1212
01:37:21,807 --> 01:37:23,226
My father says

1213
01:37:23,309 --> 01:37:26,228
that you have
been my friend.

1214
01:37:26,311 --> 01:37:29,397
You came back
for me.

1215
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:32,399
You would have done
the same for me.

1216
01:37:34,818 --> 01:37:36,986
Why would
you do this?

1217
01:37:40,572 --> 01:37:44,159
Because the needs
of the one...

1218
01:37:44,243 --> 01:37:46,827
outweigh the needs
of the many.

1219
01:38:07,927 --> 01:38:10,888
I have been

1220
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:13,890
and ever shall be

1221
01:38:13,932 --> 01:38:15,225
your friend.

1222
01:38:15,267 --> 01:38:16,852
Yes.

1223
01:38:18,269 --> 01:38:19,603
Yes, Spock.

1224
01:38:21,438 --> 01:38:23,398
The ship...

1225
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:24,691
out of danger?

1226
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:27,067
You saved the ship.

1227
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:28,694
You saved us all.

1228
01:38:28,735 --> 01:38:30,571
Don't you remember?

1229
01:38:44,081 --> 01:38:45,332
Jim.

1230
01:38:48,084 --> 01:38:50,961
Your name is Jim.

1231
01:38:52,421 --> 01:38:53,505
Yes.
