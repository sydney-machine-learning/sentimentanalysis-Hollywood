1
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:12,028
Morning, Scott.
Morning, Wells.

2
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,995
Ghost Rider, this is Strike. We have
unknown aircraft, inbound Mustang.

3
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,703
Your vector 090 for bogey.

4
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,887
- Who's up there?
- Cougar, Merlin, Maverick and Goose.

5
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,897
Great. Maverick and Goose.

6
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:55,955
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Roger, I got them. 900 knots closure.

7
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:59,495
<i>- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.</i>

8
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:02,921
- Merlin, you got them?
- I got radar contact.

9
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:08,598
- I'll get a visual ID. You hook them.
- I'll clean them and fry them.

10
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,350
<i>Mustang. This is Ghost Rider, 203.</i>

11
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:22,906
<i>I have them inbound,
bogey heading 270 at 10 miles.</i>

12
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:27,369
<i>- 900 knots closure.
- Take angels 10, left, 3, 0.</i>

13
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:31,288
- Are we expecting visitors?
- Negative, sir.

14
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:40,757
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

15
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:47,973
- Goose, you see a trailer?
- Looks like he's a single.

16
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:55,112
- I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.
- Take it easy. I'll see if he's really alone.

17
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:19,717
- He's coming right at us, Mav.
- OK, buddy. What's on your mind?

18
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,053
Shit, there's two of them.

19
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,274
MiG-28s!

20
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,610
What? What's their position?

21
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,656
- 250 miles out, sir.
- Get them out of here!

22
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,287
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

23
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,333
I lost him in the sun.

24
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:46,958
Shit, what's he doing?
You got him, Merlin?

25
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,050
He's coming around on our tail.

26
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:56,057
Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.

27
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:01,479
- What's their range now?
- 200 miles.

28
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:05,984
If they break 150 miles,
launch the alert five aircraft.

29
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:11,663
- Airspeed 300. Go get them, Mav!
- I'm going for missile lock.

30
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,001
Let's see if we can scare him out of here.

31
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:19,667
Come on, lock up, baby.
Lock up.

32
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:23,129
I've got him locked. Bingo!

33
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:33,848
- We got him, Mav. He's bugging out.
- Mustang, MiG two is headed home.

34
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:38,156
- What's their position?
- 180 miles and bearing 010.

35
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:46,536
- He's got missile lock on us!
- He's engaging me.

36
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:53,914
Goddamn it. This is Ghost Rider,
he's got missile lock on me.

37
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:59,467
- Do I have permission to fire?
- Do not fire until fired upon.

38
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,017
- There they are.
- The MiG's in perfect firing position.

39
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,815
- No way. He'd have fired by now.
- Maverick, get this asshole off me!

40
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,621
Easy, Cougar. Bring him back,
hard right. Help me engage.

41
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,496
I'm on my way.

42
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:41,392
I can't shoot him, so let's have fun.

43
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,150
Is this your idea of fun?

44
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,200
Greetings.

45
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,870
Watch the birdie.

46
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:02,800
Jeez, I crack myself up.

47
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:12,261
Great shot.
I should be a photographer.

48
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:17,357
Cougar, your tail is clear.

49
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:31,625
Cougar, we've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

50
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:35,793
I'm getting low on fuel,
so we're heading home.

51
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:41,680
We'll see you on deck.

52
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,187
We're running low on gas.

53
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:55,866
Cougar?

54
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:01,614
We're on vapour.
Let's do it.

55
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:06,456
Cougar, come on!

56
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:21,220
<i>- Let's take it back to the ship, man.
- Get him on deck as soon as possible.</i>

57
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:28,784
Cougar, we've got to land this thing.
We are way low on gas.

58
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,693
<i>Are you all right?</i>

59
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:42,331
<i>- Maverick, call the ball.
- Roger. Maverick has the ball.</i>

60
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,344
<i>- It's time to land!
- Cougar's in trouble.</i>

61
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:52,806
Come on, we're getting low on gas.
Let's land this sucker.

62
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:55,055
<i>Cougar!</i>

63
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:04,323
- Goddamn it!
- We've got no fuel for this.

64
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,364
We're going after Cougar.

65
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:11,121
Tell him to land. That's an order!

66
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:14,913
<i>Ghost Rider,
you are instructed to land immediately.</i>

67
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:23,681
Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?

68
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,927
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.

69
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:35,194
You're OK, Cougar.
Just stay on my wing.

70
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:38,531
I'll take you all the way in.
Stay with me.

71
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:57,680
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

72
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,558
You're a little low. You're a little low.
Come on, buddy, pull up.

73
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:08,106
Pull up, Cougar.

74
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,614
That's it. Almost there.

75
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:15,912
<i>A little below glide path. Call the ball.</i>

76
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,575
<i>Roger ball.</i>

77
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,133
<i>We're too low!</i>

78
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,385
<i>Increase power!</i>

79
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:48,660
Come in.

80
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:52,993
Sir.

81
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:58,080
- What's on your mind?
- My wife and kid, sir.

82
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:03,134
I almost orphaned him today.
I've never even seen him.

83
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:07,637
- I was so scared.
- We've seen this before.

84
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:09,639
No, sir.

85
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,070
I'm holding on too tight.
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.

86
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,168
Cougar?

87
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:33,461
Thanks, Maverick.

88
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:39,183
- Maverick, Goose, come in here.
- What the hell's going on?

89
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:43,015
- I don't know.
- Shit.

90
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:50,897
Maverick,
you just did an incredibly brave thing.

91
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:58,205
You should have landed your plane.
It belongs to the taxpayers!

92
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:01,457
Your ego's writing cheques
your body can't cash.

93
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:06,456
You've lost your qualifications
as section leader three times.

94
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:11,096
Put in hack twice by me,
with a history of high-speed passes

95
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:15,179
over five air-control towers
and one admiral's daughter.

96
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:22,067
- Penny Benjamin?
- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.

97
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:26,564
Let's not bullshit. Your family name
ain't the best in the Navy.

98
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,368
You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the other guy.

99
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:36,332
- Just want to serve my country, sir.
- Don't screw around with me.

100
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:39,872
You're a hell of an instinctive pilot.
Maybe too good.

101
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:44,464
I'd like to bust your butt
but I got another problem here.

102
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,138
I gotta send somebody to Miramar.

103
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:53,435
I gotta do something, I can't believe it.
I gotta give you your dream shot.

104
00:14:53,607 --> 00:15:00,822
I'm gonna send you up against the best.
You characters are going to Top Gun.

105
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:04,407
For five weeks, you'll fly against the best.

106
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:09,871
You were number two. Cougar was
number one. He turned in his wings.

107
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,713
You guys are number one.

108
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,208
But you remember one thing:

109
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:21,470
You screw up, you'll be flying
a cargo plane full of rubber dog-shit.

110
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,516
Yes, sir!

111
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:28,394
That is all.

112
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:32,862
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
Gentlemen!

113
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:37,610
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

114
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:24,465
During Korea, we shot down 12
of their jets for every one of ours.

115
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:31,848
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-1.
Our pilots were dependent on missiles.

116
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:37,442
Top Gun was created to teach ACM.
Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting.

117
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,987
- This gives me a hard-on.
- By the end of Vietnam, it was 12-1.

118
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:45,278
- Don't tease me.
- Blinds, please.

119
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:51,375
Our commanding officer was the very
first man to win the Top Gun trophy.

120
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,961
You won't find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere in the world.

121
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:58,833
Commander Mike Metcalf.
Call sign Viper.

122
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:01,134
Gentlemen.

123
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:05,634
You are the top one per cent
of all naval aviators.

124
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:12,772
The elite. The best of the best.
We'll make you better.

125
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:20,112
You'll fly two combat missions a day,
attend classes and evaluations.

126
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:24,417
On each combat sequence,
you'll meet a different challenge.

127
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,669
Every encounter will be more difficult.

128
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,382
We'll teach you to fly the F-14
faster than ever before.

129
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,675
More dangerous.

130
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:38,464
Now, we don't make policy here.

131
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:44,100
Elected officials, civilians, do that.
We are the instruments of that policy.

132
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:49,318
Although we're not at war, we must
always act as though we are at war.

133
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,484
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering who's the best.

134
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:59,824
In case some of you wonder
who the best is, they're on this plaque.

135
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:05,045
The best driver and his RIO
from each class has his name on it.

136
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:11,006
They have the option to come back here
to be Top Gun instructors.

137
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:15,679
You think your name's
gonna be on that plaque?

138
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,563
Yes, sir.

139
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:22,396
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

140
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:25,156
Yes, sir.

141
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:29,449
I like that in a pilot.

142
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:34,997
Remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

143
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:42,792
This school is about combat.
There are no points for second place.

144
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,674
- Dismissed.
- Nice going.

145
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:54,150
The plaque for the alternates
is down in the ladies' room.

146
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,104
Jesus... You kill me, you really do.

147
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:03,993
There's two "O"s in Goose, boys.

148
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:23,640
- This I call a target-rich environment.
- You live your life between your legs.

149
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:26,899
Even you could get laid
in a place like this.

150
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:30,650
I'd be happy to find a girl
who'd talk dirty to me.

151
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:39,329
You wanted to know who the best is?
That's him. Iceman.

152
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:43,622
He flies ice-cold. No mistakes.

153
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:49,671
Wears you down. You get bored,
do something stupid, and he's got you.

154
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:54,508
Slider, I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
What happened?

155
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:57,355
Whose butt did you kiss to get here?

156
00:19:57,522 --> 00:20:01,187
- The list is long but distinguished.
- So's my johnson.

157
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,905
- So, you're flying with Iceman?
- Mother Goose, how's it going?

158
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:10,238
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazanski.

159
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,698
Congratulations on Top Gun.
Sorry about Cougar.

160
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,243
He and I were like brothers.
He was a good man.

161
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,550
- Still is a good man.
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

162
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:24,256
You need any help?

163
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,927
- With what?
- You figured it out yet?

164
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,934
- What's that?
- Who's the best pilot.

165
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:37,687
- I can figure that one out on my own.
- I heard that about you.

166
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,354
You like to work alone.

167
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:46,697
You're lucky. First the MiG,
and then you slide into Cougar's spot.

168
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:49,446
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.

169
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:52,997
Some pilots wait a whole career
to see a MiG up close.

170
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:57,420
- Guess you're lucky and famous.
- You mean notorious.

171
00:20:57,595 --> 00:21:01,677
- See you later.
- You can count on it.

172
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:06,678
- They were abused children.
- We're gonna have a good time.

173
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:09,064
Always.

174
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:17,075
OK, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?
All right, the bet is $20.

175
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:22,831
You have to have carnal knowledge,
of a lady this time, on the premises.

176
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,707
On the premises.

177
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,549
Come on, a bet's a bet.

178
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:33,546
I don't know - it just doesn't seem fair.
For you, I mean. But...

179
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,689
- She's lost that loving feeling.
- No, she hasn't. She has not lost...

180
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:45,104
- She's lost it, man. Come on.
- I hate it when she does that.

181
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:56,039
- Excuse me, miss.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

182
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:59,993
<i>You never close your eyes any more</i>

183
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:04,041
<i>When I kiss your lips</i>

184
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:07,553
<i>There's no tenderness like before</i>

185
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:10,677
<i>In your fingertips</i>

186
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:14,187
<i>You're trying hard not to show it</i>

187
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:16,266
<i>Baby</i>

188
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:21,782
<i>But, baby, believe me, I know it</i>

189
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:26,326
<i>You've lost that lovin' feelin'</i>

190
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:30,791
<i>Oh, that lovin' feelin'</i>

191
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,080
<i>You've lost that lovin' feelin'</i>

192
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:38,254
<i>Now it's gone, gone, gone</i>

193
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:48,769
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

194
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:54,525
<i>Baby, baby,
I'd get down on my knees for you</i>

195
00:22:56,323 --> 00:23:01,071
I love that song.
I've never seen that approach.

196
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:05,197
- How long have you been doing this act?
- Since...

197
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,286
- Puberty?
- Right.

198
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:13,210
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

199
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:17,256
- Did your mother not like you?
- It's my call sign.

200
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:21,930
- You're a pilot?
- That's right. A naval aviator.

201
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:27,349
- Actually, we've only done this twice.
- How did you do?

202
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:31,526
Crashed and burned on the first one.
It wasn't pretty.

203
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:37,325
- And the second?
- I don't know. It's looking good so far.

204
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:44,543
Well, Maverick. My friend just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you.

205
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,590
- Perry.
- Hi.

206
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,764
I'll be with you in just a second.

207
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:58,389
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- That depends.

208
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:04,654
- Are you a good pilot?
- I can hold my own.

209
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:06,783
Great.

210
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:12,992
Then I won't have to worry about
you making your living as a singer.

211
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:21,293
I'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out.

212
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:24,177
Great, Mav. Real slick.

213
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:52,418
- A long cruise, was it, sailor?
- Too long.

214
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:56,460
You want to just drop down on the tile
and go for it?

215
00:24:56,638 --> 00:25:00,506
I actually had this counter in mind.

216
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:05,726
- That would be very comfortable, yeah.
- It could be.

217
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:14,695
I came in here to save you from making
a big mistake with that older guy.

218
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:17,028
Really?

219
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:21,417
So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like you?

220
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:24,923
Maybe.

221
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,755
- I've got to work early in the morning.
- What are you doing?

222
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:34,472
Your friend was magnificent.

223
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:46,694
You'll also be trained
by civilian specialists.

224
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:51,744
They are our best source of information
on enemy aircraft.

225
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:57,622
One of the most qualified, call sign
Charlie, has a PhD in astrophysics.

226
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:04,845
Listen to her, because the Pentagon
listens to her about your proficiency.

227
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:08,548
- All yours, Charlie.
- Thank you.

228
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:15,099
Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s
and A-4s as our MiG simulators.

229
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:22,360
As you know, the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.

230
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:26,200
It doesn't bleed energy below 300 knots
like the MiG-28.

231
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:32,081
However, the MiG-28 does have
a problem with its inverted flight tanks.

232
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,506
It won't do a negative G pushover.

233
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:40,006
The latest intelligence tells us
that the most it will do is...

234
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:45,095
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?

235
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:50,729
- The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
- How's that?

236
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:55,946
- I just happened to see a MiG-28...
- We!

237
00:26:56,118 --> 00:27:01,957
Sorry, Goose. We happened to see a
MiG-28 do a four-G negative dive.

238
00:27:02,127 --> 00:27:04,831
Where did you see this?

239
00:27:05,004 --> 00:27:07,674
- That's classified.
- It's what?

240
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:11,293
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

241
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,506
I have Top Secret clearance.

242
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:19,227
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

243
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:22,232
It doesn't seem so in this case.

244
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,443
So, Lieutenant, where exactly were you?

245
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:34,451
We started up on his six when he pulled
through the clouds. I went above him.

246
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:38,954
If you were directly above him,
how could you see him?

247
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:42,914
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.

248
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:46,591
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.

249
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:52,056
You were in a four-G inverted dive
with a MiG-28?

250
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:55,230
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

251
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:01,272
- About two metres?
- 1 ½. I have a great Polaroid of it.

252
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:05,033
- It was a nice picture.
- Lieutenant?

253
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,415
- What were you doing there?
- Communicating.

254
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:16,253
Keeping up foreign relations.

255
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:20,923
- I was, you know, giving him the bird.
- You know, the finger.

256
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:26,341
- I know the finger.
- I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.

257
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,354
- Excuse me.
- So you're the one?

258
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:35,353
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, we have a hop to take.

259
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:41,037
The hard-deck on this is 10,000 feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.

260
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:42,997
Move it!

261
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:50,711
Lieutenant!

262
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:55,797
Don't be late again.
You look great, honey.

263
00:28:55,974 --> 00:29:00,386
Why didn't you tell me
you were the famous MiG Insulter?

264
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:05,770
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room.

265
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:10,359
I'm an instructor.
I see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks.

266
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,942
I'm sure you can figure that out.

267
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:19,455
I'd just really like
to hear about the MiG sometime.

268
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:24,834
You've got security clearance.
You can read about it.

269
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:31,632
Maverick.

270
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:35,095
I'm curious.

271
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:41,727
Who was covering Cougar while you
were showboating with this MiG?

272
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,065
Cougar was doing just fine.

273
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:51,491
<i>This is your first hop. The jets you're
flying against are smaller, faster,</i>

274
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:56,708
<i>just like the enemy MiGs.
As of now we are keeping score.</i>

275
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,343
- I lost him, Goose.
- Show me what you've got, kid.

276
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:06,056
- I lost him.
- I'm looking.

277
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:11,892
- He's on our tail, coming hard.
- I got him. Here we go.

278
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:29,788
- Talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there. Closing in on us.

279
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:33,333
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

280
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:41,430
All right, Jester,
I'll give you a run for your money here.

281
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:48,100
Watch the mountains!

282
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:03,046
He's still back there. Come on, Mav,
do some of that pilot shit.

283
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:17,896
- Come on, bring it right.
- I've had enough of this shit.

284
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:23,187
- I'll brake, he'll fly right by.
- You're mine.

285
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,908
Jesus Christ!

286
00:31:36,587 --> 00:31:40,336
- Let's see what you got now.
- Let's turn and burn.

287
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:03,158
- He's going vertical. So am I.
- We're going ballistic. Go get him!

288
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:15,834
He's going for the hard-deck.
Let's nail him.

289
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:18,715
No way, Jester. You're mine.

290
00:32:34,657 --> 00:32:36,614
I got you now!

291
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:44,041
- Jester's dead.
- Jester's dead.

292
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:50,004
Get your butts above the hard-deck
and return to base.

293
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:56,057
Yes, sir!

294
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:07,102
- This is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.
- Negative. The pattern is full.

295
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,740
- No, Mav. This is not a good idea.
- Sorry, but it's time to buzz the tower.

296
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:27,049
Goddamn son of a bitch!

297
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:33,094
Great balls of fire.

298
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:39,901
- Jester's dead.
- You won?

299
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,778
- Didn't everybody?
- We got our butts kicked. 30 seconds.

300
00:33:45,953 --> 00:33:50,950
I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?"
He said, "Where did who go?"

301
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:55,172
- He's laughing at us on the radio.
- That was me, dickhead.

302
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,676
- We won.
- All right!

303
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:01,930
- They won, too.
- That's not what I heard.

304
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,429
- We got Jester.
- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.

305
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:09,356
We nailed that son of a bitch.

306
00:34:09,524 --> 00:34:14,687
- You guys really are cowboys.
- What's your problem, Kazanski?

307
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:19,159
You're everyone's problem.
Every time you fly, you're unsafe.

308
00:34:19,328 --> 00:34:25,202
- I don't like you. You're dangerous.
- That's right, Iceman.

309
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:29,126
I am dangerous.

310
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:35,297
Maverick. You and Goose
get your butts up to Viper's office, now.

311
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:43,558
Remember, no points for second place.

312
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:48,231
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- You shut up.

313
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:52,735
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys flew by
at over 400 knots.

314
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,328
I want somebody's butt and I want it now!

315
00:34:57,417 --> 00:35:03,006
Goddamn it, that's twice.
I want some butts!

316
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,257
- That just about covers the fly-bys.
- Follow me.

317
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,470
Gentlemen...

318
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:18,898
You had a hell of a first day.

319
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:25,738
The hard-deck for this hop
was 10,000 feet.

320
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:28,034
You knew it. You broke it.

321
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:34,327
You followed Commander Heatherly
below after he lost sight of you.

322
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:40,923
- Why?
- Sir, I had him in my sights.

323
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:45,674
He saw me move in for the kill.
He proceeded below the hard-deck.

324
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:49,350
We weren't below 10,000
for more than a few seconds.

325
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:53,224
I had the shot.
There was no danger, so I took it.

326
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:59,441
You took it,
and broke a major rule of engagement.

327
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:05,621
Then you broke another one
with that circus-stunt fly-by.

328
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:10,788
Top Gun rules of engagement
exist for your safety and that of your team.

329
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:14,169
They are not flexible, nor am I.

330
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:17,595
Obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?

331
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,468
Yes, sir.

332
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,659
Dismissed.

333
00:36:36,704 --> 00:36:41,001
I really enjoyed that, thanks a lot.
Holy shit.

334
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,750
Maybe I could be a truck driver.

335
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:52,838
You got the number
of that truck-driving school?

336
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:58,013
Fitness report says it all.
He's a wild card.

337
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:02,057
Flies by the seat of his pants.
Unpredictable.

338
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:06,448
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

339
00:37:06,616 --> 00:37:09,238
Maverick.

340
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,540
I flew with his old man.

341
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:20,088
Tell me, if you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

342
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:24,338
I don't know. I just don't know.

343
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:39,439
- Still awake?
- Yeah.

344
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:45,538
- What's up?
- I can't sleep.

345
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:54,295
When I realised we were off to Top Gun,
all I could think about was that trophy.

346
00:37:54,466 --> 00:37:59,759
I've got to be straight with you, Mav.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

347
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:07,348
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.

348
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:14,023
I guess that fly-by
wasn't such a big hit?

349
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:21,036
It's tough. They wouldn't
let you into the Academy

350
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:26,167
because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.
You have to live with that reputation.

351
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:31,050
But every time we go up,
it's like you're flying against a ghost.

352
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,466
It makes me nervous.

353
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:44,728
You're the only family I've got.
I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.

354
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,074
Get outta here.

355
00:39:12,354 --> 00:39:17,016
A rolling reversal
would work well in that situation.

356
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:20,778
If I reversed on a hard cross,
I could go to guns on him.

357
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:26,074
But at that speed, it's too fast.
It's a little bit too aggressive.

358
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,704
Too aggressive?

359
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:36,081
I guess when I see something,
I go right after it.

360
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:41,217
- You didn't tell me who you were.
- You didn't give me a chance.

361
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:47,179
- You deserved it.
- I know. But...

362
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:51,936
You were tempted
to ask me out for dinner.

363
00:39:52,112 --> 00:39:55,528
- No.
- No?

364
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:58,369
I don't date students.

365
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:09,376
I can see it's dangerous for you.

366
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,753
But if the government trusts me,

367
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:15,599
maybe you could.

368
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:25,266
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

369
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:41,088
Crash and burn, Mav?

370
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,466
Slider...

371
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:51,089
You stink.

372
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,777
Let's go!

373
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:27,292
Come on, Mav. Just one more game.
That evens it up.

374
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:34,054
- I got some things to take care of.
- Just one more game. Please? For me?

375
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:38,059
- Sorry.
- You're sorry? Come on. For me?

376
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,347
Damn it.

377
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:26,656
Lieutenant?

378
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:36,967
- What? No singing?
- Look, I'm...

379
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,551
No apologies.

380
00:43:46,732 --> 00:43:52,025
If you don't mind, I'll take a quick shower
while you're finishing up here.

381
00:43:54,242 --> 00:43:58,738
I do mind. I'm hungry.

382
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:05,583
And then I thought about it.

383
00:44:05,755 --> 00:44:10,301
I thought,
"You know, he's a smart guy.

384
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:15,346
"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here?"

385
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:17,510
Well?

386
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:20,559
It's the MiG.

387
00:44:23,945 --> 00:44:25,737
The MiG.

388
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:30,733
You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MiG-28.

389
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,667
I'm trying for this big promotion.
If I get it, I won't be here much longer.

390
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:41,883
Seems to me you've got it all figured out.

391
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:46,050
Except you did forget the wine.

392
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:51,430
Sorry.

393
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:57,062
- You always get what you want?
- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.

394
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,691
Then relax about the MiG.

395
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:17,586
This music...

396
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:22,255
An old friend?

397
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:28,438
My folks loved it.
I haven't heard this in years.

398
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:33,649
My mother used to call from her room
and have me play this over and over.

399
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:37,523
I got so sick of it.

400
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:45,164
But not her. She'd sit up there alone,
just listening for hours.

401
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:47,578
Just listening.

402
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:52,668
She died shortly after him.

403
00:45:52,845 --> 00:45:56,629
What happened to your father?

404
00:46:00,105 --> 00:46:06,854
I figured with your security clearance
you'd know more about it than I do.

405
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:10,364
Well, I didn't get that far.

406
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:15,913
It's a big mystery.

407
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:22,335
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.

408
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:28,721
The stink of it was he screwed up.

409
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:34,348
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

410
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:42,987
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

411
00:46:43,157 --> 00:46:47,737
- Somebody must know.
- Yeah, somebody knows everything.

412
00:46:47,914 --> 00:46:53,074
Is that why you're always
second best up there?

413
00:46:53,252 --> 00:46:57,631
You are direct, aren't you?

414
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:07,936
I'm sorry I was late.

415
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:14,144
- I'm sorry for being direct.
- No apologies.

416
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,938
This is going to be complicated.

417
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:33,799
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna take a shower.

418
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:43,218
Thank you. I enjoyed being here.

419
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,523
It looks like you need another shower.

420
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:27,360
Right.

421
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:36,242
I'm gonna be honest with you.

422
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:41,583
Your MiG sighting
is really important to my work, but...

423
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:50,719
I don't normally invite students
to my house. You're...

424
00:48:58,908 --> 00:49:02,525
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.

425
00:49:04,413 --> 00:49:06,073
Sir.

426
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:31,939
I'm glad we got that straight.

427
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:54,470
I told her how tough it is here.
My ass dragging like an old tired dog.

428
00:49:54,642 --> 00:49:58,011
I told her you didn't even have a woman.

429
00:49:58,187 --> 00:50:01,973
She said, "He's probably got eight."

430
00:50:06,907 --> 00:50:08,946
Hi!

431
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:12,536
Daddy.

432
00:50:18,004 --> 00:50:22,832
Goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.

433
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:25,846
- Is that right?
- I didn't tell her that.

434
00:50:26,014 --> 00:50:29,845
- Yes, you did.
- I can't believe you said that.

435
00:50:36,985 --> 00:50:42,443
The bogey has good position right here.
Freeze frame. A moment of choice.

436
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:46,994
The F-14 is defensive.
He has a chance to bug out right here.

437
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:53,702
Better to retire and save your aircraft
than push a bad position.

438
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,373
Charlie, jump in here any time.

439
00:50:56,551 --> 00:51:01,379
Stay another three seconds,
the bogey'll blow you out of the sky.

440
00:51:01,556 --> 00:51:06,684
Take a hard right, select zone five,
you can extend an escape.

441
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:09,394
You made a bad choice.

442
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,607
Charlie.

443
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:19,611
Aircraft one performs a split S?
That's the last thing you should do.

444
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:23,834
The MiG's right on your tail.
Freeze there.

445
00:51:24,002 --> 00:51:28,082
The MiG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking?

446
00:51:28,256 --> 00:51:32,835
You don't have time to think up there.
If you think, you're dead.

447
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:36,346
That's a big gamble
with a $30-million plane.

448
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:49,358
Unfortunately, it worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.

449
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:56,202
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical
move and defeats him with a missile.

450
00:51:56,375 --> 00:52:03,588
The encounter was a victory, but we
show it as an example of what not to do.

451
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:06,130
Next.

452
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:09,840
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

453
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:17,650
Now then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook manoeuvre.

454
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:31,456
Lieutenant?

455
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:36,956
Maverick?

456
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:49,309
My review of your performance
was right on, in my professional opinion.

457
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:52,316
I can't hear you.

458
00:53:11,716 --> 00:53:14,388
Jesus! And you think I'm reckless?

459
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:18,137
When I fly,
my crew and my plane come first.

460
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:20,681
I'm gonna finish my sentence.

461
00:53:20,853 --> 00:53:23,142
My review was right on.

462
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:26,647
- Is that right?
- But I held something back.

463
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:30,652
I see genius in your flying,
but I can't say that in there.

464
00:53:30,824 --> 00:53:34,738
I was afraid that everyone
would see right through me.

465
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:40,500
I don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.

466
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:29,172
- Hear about Ice?
- What's that?

467
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:33,555
- He won another one.
- Really?

468
00:55:33,723 --> 00:55:39,064
I feel the need...
the need for speed.

469
00:55:42,234 --> 00:55:48,072
<i>This is hop 19. Multiple aircraft, multiple
bogeys. Your training is half over.</i>

470
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:52,868
<i>The competition for the trophy
remains tight. First place, Iceman.</i>

471
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,375
<i>Second, Maverick, two points behind.</i>

472
00:55:56,545 --> 00:56:00,127
There they are. Three miles, 10 o'clock.

473
00:56:00,298 --> 00:56:05,505
I see them. Two A-4s.
Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.

474
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:18,445
- Good morning. The temperature is 110.
- It's Viper.

475
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:21,021
Viper's up here? Great.

476
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:22,693
Shit.

477
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:27,448
He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."

478
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:37,299
- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.
- Roger, I've got the southern guy.

479
00:56:37,468 --> 00:56:41,515
Hollywood, you lead. I'll cover you.

480
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:54,567
Break now, Jester.

481
00:56:58,537 --> 00:57:01,740
We're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

482
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,840
Goose, find Viper. He's out there.

483
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:13,505
Stay with Hollywood.
We're covering his wing.

484
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,473
- There's Viper. Three o'clock low.
- We're Hollywood's cover.

485
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:22,774
- Don't you leave me.
- Hollywood, you're looking good.

486
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:25,100
I'm going after Viper.

487
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:30,693
- Goddamn you!
- Don't leave him.

488
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:33,620
Hollywood's OK. I want Viper.

489
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:40,080
Viper's coming down.

490
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:49,715
We're head-to-head.
I can't believe this.

491
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:07,225
Rock and roll! Here's our big chance.

492
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:13,030
Come on, goddamn it.

493
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,030
Come on, keep coming.

494
00:58:21,082 --> 00:58:25,126
OK, Sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.

495
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:27,868
Come around. That's it.

496
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,922
Jesus, this guy's good. Where's he going?

497
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,513
Come on, come on. Keep coming.

498
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,346
Come on, baby.

499
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,980
Damn, this kid's good.

500
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,820
He's too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.

501
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,944
Come on.

502
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:07,159
Stick with me.

503
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:14,172
- Hold it. Check our tail.
- Shit, there's Jester!

504
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:19,299
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

505
00:59:19,471 --> 00:59:24,547
The Defense Department regrets
your sons died because they were stupid.

506
00:59:24,725 --> 00:59:26,599
Great balls of fire!

507
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:30,813
Knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

508
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:41,697
- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.
- Shut up!

509
00:59:42,784 --> 00:59:47,612
That was some of the best flying
I've seen yet. Until you got killed.

510
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:52,534
You never, never leave your wingman.

511
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:04,500
It's not your flying, it's your attitude.

512
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:09,756
The enemy's dangerous,
but right now you're worse.

513
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:12,093
Dangerous and foolish.

514
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,102
You may not like who's flying with you,

515
01:00:16,274 --> 01:00:19,440
but whose side are you on?

516
01:00:27,034 --> 01:00:30,901
At least Viper got Iceman
before he got us.

517
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:33,652
We've still got a shot at it.

518
01:00:33,832 --> 01:00:37,035
That was stupid, I know better than that.

519
01:00:37,211 --> 01:00:39,997
That will never happen again.

520
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:44,915
I know.

521
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,387
I know.

522
01:01:41,103 --> 01:01:45,600
Go fetch him.
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

523
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:51,860
- Hell, no. Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter.

524
01:01:52,031 --> 01:01:57,369
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

525
01:01:57,536 --> 01:02:00,110
Did he? Great.

526
01:02:00,289 --> 01:02:05,828
He tells me about all of them. My angel
Goose goes home early for church.

527
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:10,379
- You go home with the hot women.
- Thank you, Carole.

528
01:02:10,548 --> 01:02:14,463
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

529
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:37,236
I'd love to be able to warn you off about
Maverick, but I just love him to death.

530
01:02:38,658 --> 01:02:43,615
I've known Pete for a lot of years.
One thing's for certain.

531
01:02:43,787 --> 01:02:48,035
There are hearts breaking wide open
all over the world.

532
01:02:48,209 --> 01:02:52,040
- Why?
- Because, unless you are a fool,

533
01:02:52,212 --> 01:02:59,294
that boy is off the market.
He is 100% prime time in love with you.

534
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:03,134
- Goose, you big stud.
- That's me!

535
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:09,060
- Take me to bed or lose me forever.
- Show me the way home, honey.

536
01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:12,431
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

537
01:03:43,844 --> 01:03:45,753
Maverick...

538
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:53,343
You big stud.
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

539
01:04:05,532 --> 01:04:09,030
<i>This is hop 31.
Two weeks to graduation.</i>

540
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:12,617
<i>The Top Gun trophy
is still up for grabs.</i>

541
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:59,660
The score is tied. Time for the big one.

542
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:06,000
- Are you up for this one, Maverick?
- Just a walk in the park.

543
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,165
Contact. Multiple bogeys.

544
01:05:10,342 --> 01:05:12,584
Two miles. Going away from us.

545
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:16,759
- I see them. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.
- I'm in.

546
01:05:36,826 --> 01:05:39,494
That son of a bitch cut me off.

547
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:49,873
Come on. Jesus Christ.

548
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:53,296
- Ice, take the shot.
- Get the hell out of there.

549
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:57,298
I can't get the angle. I'm too close.
Switching to guns.

550
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,628
Fire or clear!

551
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:11,305
- Christ, I can take a shot right here.
- 20 seconds and I've got him.

552
01:06:17,197 --> 01:06:21,360
- I'm moving in. I've got the shot.
- Come on, Mav.

553
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:26,701
- He's impatient. Take the shot.
- 10 more seconds.

554
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:33,537
- Get the hell out of there.
- Come off my right. I'm in.

555
01:06:33,713 --> 01:06:36,713
- Five more seconds.
- I'm in.

556
01:06:36,882 --> 01:06:39,088
I'm off. Shit.

557
01:06:41,636 --> 01:06:44,388
We're in a jetwash. Shit!

558
01:06:47,476 --> 01:06:53,348
This is not good. We've got a flame-out.
Engine one is out... Engine two is out.

559
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:56,607
I'm losing control. I can't control it!

560
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,647
It's coupling up. This is not good!

561
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:10,329
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin heading out to sea.

562
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:15,783
Altitude 8,000... 7,000...

563
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:18,831
We're at 6,000!

564
01:07:20,506 --> 01:07:23,459
I can't reach the ejection handle!

565
01:07:26,637 --> 01:07:32,260
You're gonna have to punch us out.
I can't reach the ejection handle!

566
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:36,017
Eject, eject! Watch the canopy!

567
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:55,027
Goose... Oh, no!

568
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:00,452
Oh, God!

569
01:08:48,672 --> 01:08:52,255
Sir, let go of him.
You've got to let him go.

570
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:39,714
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.

571
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:44,717
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

572
01:09:48,855 --> 01:09:53,397
You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens.

573
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:57,979
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

574
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:06,027
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.

575
01:10:06,204 --> 01:10:12,538
The first one dies, you die too.
But there will be others.

576
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:16,293
You can count on it.

577
01:10:16,464 --> 01:10:20,295
You've got to let him go.

578
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:25,210
You've got to let him go.

579
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,365
I think maybe it was my fault.

580
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,948
I don't know.

581
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,163
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

582
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:58,373
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.

583
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:06,505
God, I want him back.

584
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:16,802
I'll be here if you need me, OK?

585
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:12,123
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

586
01:13:29,228 --> 01:13:34,435
He'd have flown anyway...
without you.

587
01:13:35,484 --> 01:13:38,651
He'd have hated it,
but he would have done it.

588
01:14:00,258 --> 01:14:03,293
The F-14 flat spin was induced

589
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:07,087
by disruption of airflow
into the starboard engine.

590
01:14:07,264 --> 01:14:10,348
This disruption stalled the engine,

591
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:15,013
which produced enough yaw rate
to induce a spin

592
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:18,639
which was unrecoverable.

593
01:14:18,816 --> 01:14:24,439
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell
could see or avoid the jetwash.

594
01:14:24,613 --> 01:14:29,903
The Board of Inquiry finds he was
not at fault in the accident of 29 July.

595
01:14:30,077 --> 01:14:33,363
His record will be cleared.

596
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:37,618
He's restored to flight status
without further delay.

597
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:41,327
These proceedings are closed.

598
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:52,426
Get him up flying, soon.

599
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:19,871
Come on, kid. Get in there.

600
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:23,741
You've got a bogey at two o'clock.
Piece of cake.

601
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:31,833
Take the shot, kid.

602
01:15:32,011 --> 01:15:35,545
You can engage any time, Maverick.

603
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:48,767
- Where the hell are you going?
- It doesn't look good.

604
01:15:48,943 --> 01:15:54,363
What do you mean? It doesn't get
to look any better than that.

605
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:07,413
Hey, man. We could have had him...

606
01:16:07,586 --> 01:16:09,543
We could have had him.

607
01:16:11,131 --> 01:16:14,464
I'll fire when I'm goddamn good and ready.

608
01:16:14,634 --> 01:16:16,840
You got that?

609
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:39,949
- He won't engage.
- It's only been a few days.

610
01:16:40,116 --> 01:16:42,951
He just might not make it back.

611
01:16:45,955 --> 01:16:48,826
Keep sending him up.

612
01:17:06,808 --> 01:17:09,513
Mitchell?

613
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:12,058
I'm sorry about Goose.

614
01:17:15,483 --> 01:17:19,017
Everybody liked him.

615
01:17:22,948 --> 01:17:25,106
I'm sorry.

616
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,918
Hi, it's Wolfman.

617
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,505
Maverick just quit.

618
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,702
Excuse me...

619
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,083
- May I?
- Please.

620
01:18:29,928 --> 01:18:33,427
I'll have what he's having.

621
01:18:33,598 --> 01:18:37,678
- Hemlock, is it?
- Ice water.

622
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:46,067
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

623
01:18:46,235 --> 01:18:51,110
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.

624
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,108
Thanks.

625
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:59,704
But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

626
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:06,453
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks.

627
01:19:08,047 --> 01:19:10,716
Where are you going?

628
01:19:10,883 --> 01:19:14,466
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

629
01:19:14,637 --> 01:19:19,844
I've seen all the evidence,
and it's not your responsibility.

630
01:19:20,017 --> 01:19:22,555
It's not your fault.

631
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:26,559
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.

632
01:19:26,731 --> 01:19:31,227
What you do up there... It's dangerous.

633
01:19:31,402 --> 01:19:33,858
But you've got to go on.

634
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,485
You don't understand.

635
01:19:37,533 --> 01:19:42,990
When I first met you,
you were larger than life.

636
01:19:44,831 --> 01:19:47,749
Look at you.

637
01:19:48,085 --> 01:19:53,244
You're not gonna be happy unless
you're going Mach 2 with your hair on fire.

638
01:19:53,423 --> 01:19:56,294
No, that's over. It's just over.

639
01:19:56,468 --> 01:20:02,755
To be the best of the best means
you make mistakes and then you go on.

640
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:06,763
You don't think I know that?

641
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:10,269
I'm here to help.

642
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,976
Look, thank you.

643
01:20:14,526 --> 01:20:18,441
If I'd wanted help,
I would have asked for it.

644
01:20:24,578 --> 01:20:27,246
So, I'm too late.

645
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:31,576
You've already left.

646
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:37,251
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?
Except to quit.

647
01:20:40,842 --> 01:20:45,920
You've got that manoeuvre down
real well.

648
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:54,803
So long, Pete Mitchell.

649
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:23,625
Hi, Maverick, come on in.
How are you doing?

650
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,172
- Sure you're feeling OK?
- Great.

651
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:30,293
- Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

652
01:21:30,472 --> 01:21:35,550
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.

653
01:21:54,871 --> 01:22:00,873
<i>I flew with your old man.
VF-51, the Oriskany.</i>

654
01:22:02,211 --> 01:22:07,667
You're a lot like he was.
Only better...

655
01:22:07,841 --> 01:22:10,048
...and worse.

656
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:14,842
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch.

657
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:20,972
So he did do it right.

658
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:27,857
Yeah, he did it right.

659
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:41,695
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?

660
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:46,866
Yeah, your old man did it right.

661
01:22:47,044 --> 01:22:51,671
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.

662
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:54,675
We were in the worst dogfight ever.

663
01:22:54,843 --> 01:22:59,055
Bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.

664
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:04,133
His F-4 was hit,
he was wounded, but he stayed.

665
01:23:04,311 --> 01:23:07,762
Saved three planes before he bought it.

666
01:23:09,983 --> 01:23:13,684
- How come I never heard?
- They don't tell dependents

667
01:23:13,862 --> 01:23:18,986
when the battle occurred
over the wrong line on some map.

668
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:22,159
- So, you were there?
- I was there.

669
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:28,703
- What's on your mind?
- My options, sir.

670
01:23:29,585 --> 01:23:32,040
Simple.

671
01:23:32,212 --> 01:23:37,752
You've enough points to show up
tomorrow and graduate.

672
01:23:37,926 --> 01:23:40,713
Or you could quit.

673
01:23:40,887 --> 01:23:45,134
There'd be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.

674
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:50,053
- So, you think I should quit?
- I didn't say that.

675
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:53,515
You feel responsible for Goose.

676
01:23:53,691 --> 01:23:57,106
And you have a confidence problem.

677
01:23:57,277 --> 01:24:00,480
I'm not gonna blow sunshine up your ass.

678
01:24:00,656 --> 01:24:05,198
A good pilot is compelled
to evaluate what's happened

679
01:24:05,368 --> 01:24:08,619
so he can apply what he's learned.

680
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:13,165
Up there, we've got to push it.
That's our job.

681
01:24:16,004 --> 01:24:20,499
It's your option, Lieutenant.
All yours.

682
01:24:31,726 --> 01:24:35,511
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.
Thanks for your time.

683
01:24:35,689 --> 01:24:39,638
No problem. Good luck.

684
01:25:27,612 --> 01:25:32,109
- Gentlemen...
- Where's Maverick?

685
01:25:32,284 --> 01:25:37,989
- I don't know where he is.
- You know what he's planning to do?

686
01:25:39,082 --> 01:25:42,865
It's got to be hard on the guy, though.

687
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:16,150
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

688
01:26:17,534 --> 01:26:21,318
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.

689
01:26:23,832 --> 01:26:30,001
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party
before it gets out of hand...

690
01:26:30,172 --> 01:26:35,332
Some of you have to depart immediately.
We have a crisis situation.

691
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:39,376
Ice, Slider...
Hollywood, Wolfman.

692
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:44,261
- Maverick.
- Sir.

693
01:26:48,063 --> 01:26:51,396
You'll get your RIO
when you get to the ship.

694
01:26:51,566 --> 01:26:53,642
If you don't...

695
01:26:53,819 --> 01:26:57,104
...give me a call. I'll fly with you.

696
01:27:10,209 --> 01:27:17,540
<i>The SS Layton has become disabled
and has wandered into foreign territory.</i>

697
01:27:17,716 --> 01:27:23,552
A rescue operation will soon begin.
Your mission is to give it air support.

698
01:27:23,722 --> 01:27:25,761
There are MiGs in the area.

699
01:27:25,933 --> 01:27:31,472
Tensions are high.
If you witness a hostile act, return fire.

700
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:37,150
They carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.
They can fire from 100 miles away.

701
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:41,315
This is the real thing.
This is what you've trained for.

702
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:45,356
You are America's best.
Make us proud.

703
01:27:45,534 --> 01:27:48,902
Ice... Hollywood, sector two.

704
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:53,207
Maverick, you back them up
with Merlin on ready five.

705
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:55,948
Yes, sir.

706
01:27:56,127 --> 01:27:58,535
Rise.

707
01:27:58,713 --> 01:28:00,587
Excuse me, sir.

708
01:28:00,757 --> 01:28:05,299
This is not personal.
But is Maverick the best pilot to?

709
01:28:05,469 --> 01:28:08,091
I know what's on your mind. Get on it.

710
01:29:26,963 --> 01:29:30,414
You've got a pair of bogeys,
12 o'clock, 15 miles.

711
01:29:30,591 --> 01:29:34,838
Voodoo One, 090,
radar contact 15 miles.

712
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:39,258
- They're doing 500 knots.
- Roger, that's your bogey.

713
01:29:41,351 --> 01:29:44,138
Dead ahead, 15 miles, 600 knots.

714
01:29:53,029 --> 01:29:57,073
<i>They're at 15,000 feet now, 10 miles.</i>

715
01:29:57,241 --> 01:30:01,534
800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.

716
01:30:01,703 --> 01:30:06,164
Wood, you got them? They must be close.
I'm getting a hard-on.

717
01:30:13,423 --> 01:30:20,635
<i>- I'm taking the lead. Let's identify them.
- Roger. I'm on your left side, a little low.</i>

718
01:30:20,805 --> 01:30:23,758
Maverick's up and ready in alert five.

719
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:31,056
<i>My bogey's still locked up.
He's drifting to the left.</i>

720
01:30:31,231 --> 01:30:33,438
<i>Still manoeuvring, course 090.</i>

721
01:30:35,027 --> 01:30:37,814
<i>Let's bring it to the right.</i>

722
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:51,701
Ice, we've got a problem.
I have four aircraft on radar.

723
01:30:51,876 --> 01:30:55,874
- Four bogeys.
- Wood, we've got four bogeys.

724
01:30:57,464 --> 01:30:59,504
- Make that five!
- Five.

725
01:30:59,675 --> 01:31:01,668
- Five?
- Yes, sir.

726
01:31:03,762 --> 01:31:07,047
- Oh, shit!
- He's got a radar lock on us.

727
01:31:09,435 --> 01:31:12,055
Get out of there, Hollywood!

728
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:22,184
I'm hit!

729
01:31:22,363 --> 01:31:26,442
We're coming apart. I can't control it!
We're going down.

730
01:31:26,617 --> 01:31:29,618
Wood's been hit. Wood's been hit!

731
01:31:29,787 --> 01:31:33,120
Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.
We lost Hollywood!

732
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:36,540
<i>- We've lost Hollywood.
- Launch Maverick.</i>

733
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:41,834
<i>Get a bearing on Hollywood and
Wolfman. Launch the rescue helicopter.</i>

734
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:09,855
- Maverick's airborne.
- What's your position?

735
01:32:10,033 --> 01:32:12,156
090 at 180 miles.

736
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:16,988
- They're coming in left.
- Three MiGs dead ahead.

737
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:23,875
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

738
01:32:24,046 --> 01:32:28,542
We have four on our tail.
That makes six of them.

739
01:32:33,722 --> 01:32:38,964
- He's firing. Break right.
- This is Voodoo One. We are defensive.

740
01:32:39,144 --> 01:32:43,770
<i>- Launch the alert fighters!
- 160 miles and closing in fast, sir.</i>

741
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,731
Ready Willard and Simkin.

742
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:54,442
- I'll be there in 30 seconds.
- I'm engaged with five. I'm in deep shit.

743
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:02,201
- Willard and Simkin?
- We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

744
01:33:02,373 --> 01:33:06,917
How long? 10 minutes?
It's over in two minutes!

745
01:33:09,547 --> 01:33:13,545
One MiG 12 o'clock high...
Watch your back!

746
01:33:19,473 --> 01:33:21,513
Break right!

747
01:33:22,852 --> 01:33:25,686
That was close.
Maverick, get down here!

748
01:33:25,854 --> 01:33:27,930
Come on, hang in there.

749
01:33:30,024 --> 01:33:31,566
Jesus Christ!

750
01:33:33,862 --> 01:33:38,025
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddamn it!

751
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:42,113
We've got a MiG on our tail.
MiG one has bugged out.

752
01:33:43,162 --> 01:33:44,786
Watch out!

753
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:51,411
We just flew right through his jetwash!

754
01:33:51,586 --> 01:33:54,457
Get control!

755
01:34:00,929 --> 01:34:06,598
Good recovery, Mav.
OK, let's get in there and help Ice.

756
01:34:06,768 --> 01:34:11,595
- Let's get back in the game.
- No, it's no good.

757
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:17,852
- Goddamn it. Maverick's disengaging.
- Shit!

758
01:34:18,029 --> 01:34:19,570
Goddamn it!

759
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:26,857
Get in there, come on.
What the hell are you doing?

760
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:30,121
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Ice is in trouble.

761
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:34,536
- Talk to me, Goose.
- He won't last down there alone.

762
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,454
Maverick!

763
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,927
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.

764
01:34:47,722 --> 01:34:52,301
- I can't get him off my tail.
- I've got your MiG dead ahead.

765
01:34:53,812 --> 01:34:55,935
I got tone.

766
01:34:56,106 --> 01:34:58,893
I got tone. Firing!

767
01:35:08,116 --> 01:35:11,450
- Where are they?
- 155 miles.

768
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,946
Two MiGs dead ahead.

769
01:35:14,123 --> 01:35:16,993
I see them.
I'll take it left down the left side.

770
01:35:18,877 --> 01:35:20,502
Oh, my God.

771
01:35:22,756 --> 01:35:27,548
Ice is right below with a MiG on his tail.

772
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:30,423
He's firing. Break left!

773
01:35:32,682 --> 01:35:35,636
He overshot!

774
01:35:35,809 --> 01:35:37,600
Coming in, Ice.

775
01:35:40,106 --> 01:35:42,940
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.

776
01:35:43,108 --> 01:35:45,943
One MiG passing between us.

777
01:35:49,156 --> 01:35:53,070
You've got a MiG on your left.
He's gonna fire!

778
01:36:00,959 --> 01:36:04,078
Check the guys to the north!

779
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:09,584
Banking left.

780
01:36:10,842 --> 01:36:16,429
- There he is. Get him, Ice!
- OK, you guys, I'm coming in.

781
01:36:19,768 --> 01:36:23,931
- A MiG's coming round on our tail.
- I can't leave Ice.

782
01:36:24,105 --> 01:36:28,981
- He's gonna get behind us!
- I'm not leaving my wingman.

783
01:36:31,738 --> 01:36:35,569
I'm on his tail.
I'm going for the shot right now.

784
01:36:35,741 --> 01:36:37,650
Roger, engaged!

785
01:36:39,786 --> 01:36:42,075
I've got radar lock.

786
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:44,287
I'm taking the shot. Fire!

787
01:36:49,045 --> 01:36:50,954
- Bingo!
- Watch that sucker!

788
01:36:51,131 --> 01:36:54,713
Ice, there's a MiG to your right.
He's firing!

789
01:36:55,801 --> 01:36:57,794
I'm hit.

790
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:03,380
- We're hit in the right engine.
- Shutting it down.

791
01:37:07,395 --> 01:37:09,851
Coming in, Ice.

792
01:37:12,443 --> 01:37:17,187
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm manoeuvring for a shot.

793
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:20,448
- Take the shot.
- I can't get a tone.

794
01:37:20,617 --> 01:37:23,950
Shoot. I can't get him off my tail.

795
01:37:27,373 --> 01:37:30,872
- We're hit again.
- We're OK.

796
01:37:31,043 --> 01:37:33,914
On the count of three, break hard right.

797
01:37:34,088 --> 01:37:37,124
Three... two... one...

798
01:37:37,299 --> 01:37:39,707
Break right!

799
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:44,293
Firing!

800
01:37:46,474 --> 01:37:50,092
- Damn it, I missed.
- Don't let him go.

801
01:37:50,269 --> 01:37:52,843
I got him.

802
01:37:53,606 --> 01:37:56,393
Here comes the shot.

803
01:38:00,404 --> 01:38:02,480
Strike three.

804
01:38:03,698 --> 01:38:08,527
- There's a MiG on your tail.
- We've only got one missile left.

805
01:38:08,704 --> 01:38:11,574
- Approaching 110 miles, sir.
- Goddamn it.

806
01:38:11,748 --> 01:38:14,535
I got him. He's on our tail.

807
01:38:21,424 --> 01:38:25,801
You haven't lost him. He's still with us.

808
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:30,304
You're slowing down.

809
01:38:30,474 --> 01:38:33,973
- I'm bringing him in closer.
- What?

810
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:43,018
- This is it.
- I'll hit the brakes. He'll fly right by us.

811
01:38:46,906 --> 01:38:49,314
Now!

812
01:38:53,204 --> 01:38:55,825
I've got a good lock. Firing.

813
01:38:59,459 --> 01:39:01,867
Strike four!

814
01:39:05,508 --> 01:39:11,212
Mustang, this is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.

815
01:39:24,233 --> 01:39:29,903
- This is Maverick, requesting fly-by.
- Negative, the pattern is full.

816
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:35,486
Something I should know about?

817
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:56,721
Goddamn that guy.

818
01:40:51,773 --> 01:40:53,731
You!

819
01:40:56,486 --> 01:41:00,021
You are still dangerous.

820
01:41:02,367 --> 01:41:05,782
But you can be my wingman any time.

821
01:41:05,954 --> 01:41:08,623
Bullshit. You can be mine.

822
01:42:02,799 --> 01:42:06,049
You're on the front page
of every newspaper,

823
01:42:06,219 --> 01:42:10,216
though the other side
denies the incident. Congratulations.

824
01:42:10,389 --> 01:42:14,339
They gave you your choice of duty.
Do you believe that?

825
01:42:14,518 --> 01:42:16,890
Where do you think you want to go?

826
01:42:17,062 --> 01:42:21,688
- I thought of being an instructor, sir.
- Top Gun?

827
01:42:21,858 --> 01:42:25,476
- Yes, sir.
- God help us.

828
01:43:46,062 --> 01:43:48,684
Hello, Pete Mitchell.

829
01:43:52,069 --> 01:43:57,822
I heard the best of the best
were gonna be back here, so...

830
01:44:01,702 --> 01:44:05,154
This could be complicated.

831
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:09,375
You know, on the first one,
I crashed and burned.

832
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,955
And the second?

833
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:23,680
I don't know, but...

834
01:44:23,848 --> 01:44:26,137
...it's looking good so far.
