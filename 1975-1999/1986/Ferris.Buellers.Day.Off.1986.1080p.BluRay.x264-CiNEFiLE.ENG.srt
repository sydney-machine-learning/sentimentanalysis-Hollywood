1
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,269
It is a beautiful day in Chicago today.

2
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,939
Temperatures expected
to reach the upper 70s.

3
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,400
Right now, 75 at the lakefront,

4
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,069
74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.

5
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,363
And now, up in the sky,

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,990
- Don Nelson with SkyView traffic.
- Ferris?

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,284
- Thanks. We've got scores of accidents.
- Ferris?

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,452
Tom!

9
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,332
- What's the matter?
- It's Ferris.

10
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,292
- What? What's wrong?
- What's wrong? For Christ's sake

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,169
look at him, honey.

12
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,797
Ferris?

13
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,887
He doesn't have a fever, but he says his
stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

14
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,848
What's the matter, Ferris?

15
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:58,975
Papa?

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,769
Honey, feel his hands.
They're cold and clammy.

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,609
I'm fine.

18
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,945
- I can get up.
- No.

19
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,613
- I have a test today.
- No.

20
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,532
You...

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,160
I have to take it.

22
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,538
I want to go to a good college,
so I can have a fruitful life.

23
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,124
Honey, you're not going
to school like this, now.

24
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,710
Fine. What's this? What's his problem?

25
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,839
- He doesn't feel well.
- Yeah, right.

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,008
Dry that one out,
you can fertilize the lawn.

27
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,594
Jeanie? Is that you?

28
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,765
Jeanie? I can't see that far.

29
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,560
Jeanie? Jeanie, I...

30
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,609
- Bite the big one, Junior.
- Thank you, Jeanie. You get to school.

31
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,195
Wait, you're letting him stay home?

32
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,614
I can't believe this.
If I was bleeding out my eyes

33
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,283
you guys would make me go to school.
This is so unfair.

34
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,994
Jeanie, please don't be upset with me.

35
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,371
You have your health. Be thankful.

36
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,254
That's it. I want out of this family.

37
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,926
I'm okay. I'll just sleep.

38
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,805
Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon.

39
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,724
Now, listen,
I'm showing some houses to that,

40
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,143
that family from Vermont today.
So I'll be in the area.

41
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,814
Now, my office will know just where
I am if you need me, okay?

42
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,816
- Okay.
- Okay.

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,651
I'll check on you too, pal.

44
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:36,072
It's nice to know
that I have such loving, caring parents.

45
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,783
You're both very special people.

46
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,832
Now, you get better, pumpkin.

47
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,959
Okay, pumpkin.

48
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,670
I'll be home at 6:00 sharp.

49
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,172
If you need anything, call.

50
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,049
Ringy-dingy.

51
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,180
- We love you, sweetie.
- I love you, too.

52
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,935
Call if you need us.

53
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,653
They bought it.

54
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,456
Incredible.

55
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,667
One of the worst performances
of my career

56
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,128
and they never doubted it for a second.

57
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,262
How could I possibly be expected
to handle school on a day like this?

58
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,649
This is my ninth sick day this semester.

59
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,153
It's getting pretty tough
coming up with new illnesses.

60
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,740
If I go for 10, I'm probably
gonna have to barf up a lung.

61
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,825
So I better make this one count.

62
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,997
The key to faking out the parents
is the clammy hands.

63
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,667
It's a good non-specific symptom.
I'm a big believer in it.

64
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,589
A lot of people will tell you that
a good, phony fever is a dead lock.

65
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:21,093
But, you get a nervous mother,
you could wind up in a doctor's office.

66
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,179
That's worse than school.

67
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,348
You fake a stomach cramp

68
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,560
and when you're bent over,
moaning and wailing,

69
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,187
you lick your palms.

70
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,439
It's a little childish and stupid,

71
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,941
but then, so is high school.

72
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,611
Life moves pretty fast.

73
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,742
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it.

74
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,206
I do have a test today.
That wasn't bullshit.

75
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,002
It's on European socialism.
I mean, really, what's the point?

76
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,381
I'm not European.
I don't plan on being European.

77
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,758
So, who gives a crap
if they're socialists?

78
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,468
They could be fascist anarchists.

79
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,721
It still wouldn't change the fact
that I don't own a car.

80
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,117
It's not that I condone fascism

81
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,119
or any "ism," for that matter.

82
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,579
"Isms," in my opinion, are not good.

83
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,667
A person should not believe in an "ism,"
he should believe in himself.

84
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,213
I quote John Lennon, "I don't believe
in Beatles, I just believe in me."

85
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,758
A good point there.
After all, he was "The Walrus."

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,096
I could be "The Walrus."
I'd still have to bum rides off of people.

87
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,974
- Adams?
- Here.

88
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,934
- Adamley?
- Here.

89
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,270
Adamowsky?

90
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,313
- Adamson?
- Here.

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,191
- Adler?
- Here.

92
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,401
Anderson?

93
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,529
- Anderson?
- Here.

94
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,072
Bueller?

95
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,826
Bueller?

96
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,328
Bueller?

97
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,374
- Bueller?
- He's sick.

98
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,878
My best friend's sister's
boyfriend's brother's girlfriend

99
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,047
heard from this guy
who knows this kid, who's going

100
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,550
with a girl who saw Ferris pass out
at Thirty-One Flavors last night.

101
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,427
I guess it's pretty serious.

102
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,930
- Thank you, Simone.
- No problem whatsoever.

103
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,601
Frye? Frye?

104
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,188
Frye?

105
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,655
Hello?

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,160
- Cameron, babe, what's happening?
- Very little.

107
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,997
- How do you feel?
- Shredded.

108
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,041
Is your mother in the room?

109
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,629
She's in Decatur.
Unfortunately, she's not staying.

110
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,715
Where are you?

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,927
I'm taking the day off.
Now get dressed and come on over.

112
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,054
I can't, stupid, I'm sick.

113
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,223
That's all in your head.

114
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,432
Come on over.

115
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,894
I feel like complete shit, Ferris.
I can't go anywhere.

116
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,190
I'm sorry to hear that.
Now come on over here and pick me up.

117
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,661
I'm dying.

118
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,378
You're not dying. You just
can't think of anything good to do.

119
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,801
If anybody needs a day off,
it's Cameron.

120
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,721
He has a lot of things to sort out
before he graduates.

121
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,849
He can't be wound up this tight
and go to college.

122
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,392
His roommate will kill him.

123
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,230
When Cameron was in Egypt's land

124
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,153
Let my Cameron go

125
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,531
Pardon my French,
but Cameron is so tight

126
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,992
that if you stuck
a lump of coal up his ass,

127
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,952
in two weeks you'd have a diamond.

128
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,668
Katie Bueller.

129
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,254
This is Edward R. Rooney,
Dean of Students.

130
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,425
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

131
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,303
I just completely forgot to call.

132
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,514
Then you are aware that your son
is not in school today?

133
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,975
Yes, I am. Ferris is home, sick.

134
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,685
Now, I had a meeting
first thing this morning.

135
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,438
I know I should have called,
it just completely slipped my mind.

136
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,315
I'm really very sorry.

137
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,026
Are you also aware, Mrs. Bueller, that

138
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,862
Ferris does not have
what we consider to be

139
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,031
an exemplary attendance record?

140
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,908
I don't understand.

141
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,036
He has missed an unacceptable number
of school days.

142
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,205
In the opinion of this educator,

143
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,041
Ferris is not taking
his academic growth seriously.

144
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,587
Now, I've spent my morning
examining his records.

145
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,799
If Ferris thinks that
he can just coast through this month

146
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,969
and still graduate,
he is sorely mistaken.

147
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,389
I have no reservation, whatsoever,

148
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,476
about holding him back another year.

149
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,481
- This is all news to me.
- Usually is.

150
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,402
So far this semester
he has been absent nine times.

151
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,407
- Nine times?
- Nine times.

152
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,952
I don't remember him
being sick nine times.

153
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,914
That's probably because he wasn't sick,
he was skipping school.

154
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,709
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Mrs. Bueller.

155
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,086
It's a fool's paradise.

156
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,256
He is just leading you
down the primrose path.

157
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,590
I can't believe it.

158
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,968
I've got it right here in front of me.

159
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,845
He has missed nine days.

160
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,439
I asked for a car, I got a computer.

161
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,109
How's that
for being born under a bad sign?

162
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,528
Grace?

163
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,283
Grace!

164
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,536
Look, I can give you every assurance,
Mr. Rooney, that Ferris is home

165
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,079
and he is very ill.

166
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,707
In fact, I debated whether or not
I should even leave him.

167
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,958
Grace!

168
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,586
I can appreciate how this time of year
children are prone to taking the day off.

169
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:34,550
However, in Ferris' case, I can
assure you, he is truly a very sick boy.

170
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,557
Never had one lesson.

171
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,312
In 1930,

172
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,315
the Republican-controlled
House of Representatives,

173
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,151
in an effort
to alleviate the effects of the...

174
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,696
Anyone? Anyone?
The Great Depression,

175
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,867
passed the... Anyone? Anyone?

176
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:05,205
The tariff bill,
the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act which...

177
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,417
Anyone? Raised or lowered?

178
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,544
Raised tariffs

179
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,381
in an effort to collect more revenue
for the federal government.

180
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,926
Did it work? Anyone?
Anyone know the effects?

181
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,765
It did not work and the United States
sank deeper into the Great Depression.

182
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,684
Today, we have
a similar debate over this.

183
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,937
Anyone know what this is?
Class? Anyone?

184
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,606
Anyone?

185
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,358
Anyone seen this before?

186
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,152
The Laffer Curve.
Anyone know what this says?

187
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,990
It says, that at this point
on the revenue curve,

188
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,993
you will get exactly
the same amount of revenue

189
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,371
as at this point.

190
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,872
This is very controversial.

191
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,793
Does anyone know what Vice President
Bush called this in 1980?

192
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,336
Anyone?

193
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,464
Something "d-o-o" economics.

194
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,674
Voodoo economics.

195
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,938
Jeanie.

196
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,232
I'm really sorry about your brother.

197
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,151
What are you sorry for?
I have to live with the trouser snake.

198
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,487
No, I mean, I heard he's really sick.

199
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,823
Whoa. Whoa. Who said he's sick?

200
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,118
A whole bunch of people. They said
he's like on the verge of death.

201
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,994
This guy in my biology class

202
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,332
said that if Ferris dies,
he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder.

203
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,419
He's such a sweetie. Got to go.

204
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,505
- Hi, Jeanie.
- Shut up.

205
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,510
Please, do not yank my cord on this.
How desperate is the situation?

206
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,345
Well, did you see Alien?

207
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,682
When that creature
was in that guy's stomach?

208
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,060
It kind of feels like that.

209
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Freshmen.

210
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,938
Goddamn, are you kidding?

211
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,275
No, of course I'm not kidding.
Do I sound like I'm kidding?

212
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,776
Who's he talking to?

213
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,069
Ferris Bueller, do you know him?

214
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,863
Yeah. He's getting me
out of summer school.

215
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,990
We appreciate you letting us know
how you're doing.

216
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,783
We've got to buzz.
Keep a good thought, dude.

217
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:05,951
Thanks.

218
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,829
Shit. I hope he doesn't die.

219
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,789
I can't handle summer school.

220
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,168
- Wait a minute, give me somebody else.
- Yeah, sure, hold on.

221
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,380
- You see Alien?
- Yeah, why?

222
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,177
- Hello?
- Hi.

223
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,220
Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

224
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,599
Oh, my God, you're dying?

225
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,814
- Is it serious?
- I don't know. I hope not.

226
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,027
- Think I may need a kidney transplant.
- Shit.

227
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,448
- Are you upset?
- Excuse me.

228
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,910
- Think you'll be alive this weekend?
- Yeah, I'd say I will.

229
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,995
Great. Maybe I'll see you. Bye.

230
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:09,932
I don't trust this kid
any further than I can throw him.

231
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,810
Well, with your bad knee, Ed,
you shouldn't throw anybody.

232
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,397
It's true.

233
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,984
What is so dangerous about a character
like Ferris Bueller is

234
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,362
he gives good kids bad ideas.

235
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,198
The last thing I need
at this point in my career is

236
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,826
1,500 Ferris Bueller disciples
running around these halls.

237
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,248
He jeopardizes my ability
to effectively govern this student body.

238
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,960
Well, makes you look like an ass
is what he does, Ed.

239
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,380
Thank you, Grace. I think you're wrong.

240
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,465
Well, he's very popular, Ed.

241
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,802
The sportos and motorheads,
geeks, sluts,

242
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,305
bloods, wasteoids,
dweebies, dickheads,

243
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,890
they all adore him.

244
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,059
They think he's a righteous dude.

245
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,689
That is why
I have got to catch him this time.

246
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,567
To show these kids
that the example he sets

247
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,986
is a first-class ticket to nowhere.

248
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,238
Ed.

249
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,074
You sounded like Dirty Harry just then.

250
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,367
Really?

251
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,250
Thanks, Grace.

252
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,669
I'm serious, man, this is ridiculous.

253
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,546
Making me
wait around the house for you.

254
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,339
Why can't you let me rot in peace?

255
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,675
Cameron, this is my ninth sick day.

256
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,760
If I get caught, I won't graduate.

257
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,555
I'm not doing this for me,
I'm doing it for you.

258
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,391
- Do you know what my diastolic is?
- Be a man.

259
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,477
Take some Pepto-Bismol,
get dressed, and come on over here.

260
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,980
- I'm tired of this stuff.
- Shut up.

261
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,692
Hold your water for a second,
I got another call.

262
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,487
- Hello?
- Ferris?

263
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,822
Hi.

264
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,616
You sound terrible.

265
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,535
Really? Darn. I thought I was improving.

266
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,203
Were you sleeping?

267
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,873
Dad, can you hang on for a second?

268
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,500
- Sure, pal.
- Hang on.

269
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,545
- Cameron, it's my dad.
- Great.

270
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,130
Keep me out of it.

271
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:09,051
If you're not over here in 15 minutes,
you can find a new best friend.

272
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,220
You've been saying that
since the fifth grade.

273
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,432
- Dad?
- Yeah?

274
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,393
All this talking
has made me kind of light-headed.

275
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,562
I think I ought to lie down.

276
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,232
Take a hot bath and then
wrap a hot towel around your head.

277
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,361
- Wrap a hot towel around my head?
- And then

278
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,656
make yourself some soup.
Get a nap. Okay?

279
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,907
Okay.

280
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,075
- Hey, Ferris?
- Yeah?

281
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,661
- Love you, pal.
- I love you, too.

282
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,917
I'm so disappointed in Cameron.

283
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,671
$20 says he's sitting in his car, debating
about whether or not he should go out.

284
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,259
He'll keep calling me.

285
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,679
He'll keep calling me until I come over.

286
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,681
He'll make me feel guilty.

287
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,016
This...

288
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:02,437
This is ridiculous.
Okay, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

289
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,855
Shit.

290
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,280
Goddamn it!

291
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,500
Forget it. That's it.

292
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,171
I'm not going.

293
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,313
In

294
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,318
what way

295
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,323
does the author's use

296
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,201
of the prison

297
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,082
symbolize

298
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,970
the protagonist's struggle? And

299
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,347
how does this relate

300
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,976
to our discussion of the uses of irony?

301
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,648
Mr. Knowlan, may I interrupt, please?

302
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,907
Sloane Peterson?

303
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,368
May I have a word with you, dear?

304
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,875
My dear, I'm afraid
that I'm the bearer of bad tidings.

305
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,252
Your father called.

306
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,756
Your grandmother has just passed.

307
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,929
- No.
- Oh, darling. Oh, honey.

308
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,058
Dead grandmother?

309
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,560
Yes, that's what Mr. Peterson said.

310
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,856
I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.
Poor little lamb.

311
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,651
Who's this girl going out with?

312
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,111
It's so hard to tell these days.

313
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,406
I do see her
with Ferris Bueller quite a little bit.

314
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,286
Would you get me
Mr. Peterson's daytime number, please?

315
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,746
Surely.

316
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,126
- Ed Rooney's office.
- This is George Peterson.

317
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,088
Please hold.

318
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,382
What do you know? It's Mr. Peterson.

319
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,261
You still want his daytime number?

320
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,602
- Ed Rooney.
- Ed. This is George Peterson.

321
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,688
How are you today, sir?

322
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,358
We've had a bit of bad luck
this morning, as you may have heard.

323
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,778
Yeah, I heard, and I'm all broken up.

324
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,490
- Boy, what a blow.
- Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,701
Well, it's been a tough morning, and

326
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,787
we've got a lot of family business
to take care of. So

327
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,374
if you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane,
I'd appreciate it.

328
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,877
Sure, I'd be happy to.

329
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,297
Yeah, you just produce a corpse, and

330
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,173
I'll release Sloane.

331
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,510
I want to see this
dead grandmother, firsthand.

332
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,595
Ed?

333
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,931
It's all right, Grace.
It's Ferris Bueller, the little twerp.

334
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,934
I'm gonna set the trap
and let him fall right into it.

335
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:33,189
Ed, I'm sorry, did you say
you wanted to see a body?

336
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,233
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:39,362
Just roll her old bones on over here,
and I'll dig up your daughter.

338
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,448
- You know, that's school policy.
- Oh?

339
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,951
- Was this your mother?
- No, my wife's mother.

340
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,080
Ed Rooney's office.

341
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,250
Hi, this is Ferris Bueller,
can I speak to Mr. Rooney, please?

342
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,501
Thank you.

343
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,631
Hold.

344
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,259
Tell you what, dip-shit,

345
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,930
you don't like my policies
you can just come on down here, and

346
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,682
smooch my big old white butt.

347
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,144
- Ed.
- Pucker up, buttercup. What?

348
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,355
Ferris Bueller's on line two.

349
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,117
Hey, Mr. Rooney, how you doing?

350
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,746
Listen, I'm sorry to disturb you at work,
but I'm not feeling very well today

351
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,958
and I was wondering if it might be
possible for my sister to bring home

352
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,877
any assignments from my classes
that I might need.

353
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,545
Have a nice day.

354
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,478
Mr. Peterson?

355
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,816
I think I owe you an apology, sir.

356
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,652
- Well, I should say you do.
- I...

357
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,404
I, I, I...

358
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,323
Well, I think you should be sorry,
for Christ's sake.

359
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,158
A family member dies

360
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,704
and you insult me. What the hell
is the matter with you anyway?

361
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,039
Well...

362
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,582
I really don't know, sir.

363
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,501
I mean, I didn't think
I was talking to you.

364
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,003
I thought I was talking
to somebody else.

365
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,464
You know, sir, that I would never
deliberately insult you like that. I...

366
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,968
I can't begin to tell you
how embarrassed I am.

367
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,470
- What?
- Pardon my French,

368
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,888
but you're an asshole.

369
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,099
- What do you want?
- Asshole.

370
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,477
Absolutely right, sir.
You've hit the nail right on the head.

371
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,104
Find out where she is.

372
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,773
This isn't over yet, buster.
Do you read me?

373
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,026
Loud and clear, Mr. Peterson.

374
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,236
Call me "sir," goddamn it!

375
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,281
- Yes, sir, yes, sir.
- That's better.

376
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,326
And you just mind
your p's and q's, buster.

377
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,662
And remember who you're dealing with.

378
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,540
Bueller, Ferris Bueller.

379
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,462
Now, I'm a little scared 'cause
what if he recognizes my voice?

380
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,548
- Impossible. You're doing great.
- Yeah?

381
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,054
She's in... Wait.

382
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,140
Rooney!

383
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,227
Rooney, calm down!

384
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,645
Just a moment.

385
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,315
Ed! Get in here!

386
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,402
Just a little office difficulty, sir.

387
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,071
Rooney, I don't have all day
to bark at you.

388
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,656
So I'm gonna make this
short and sweet.

389
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,283
It's great. Perfect. I love it.

390
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,829
I want my daughter out in front of the
school in 10 minutes by herself.

391
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,706
I don't want anybody... What?

392
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,666
It's too suspicious.
He'll think something's up.

393
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:39,751
- Cover it.
- You.

394
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,960
- Talk.
- You.

395
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,337
- Talk.
- Come on.

396
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,714
Talk. No.

397
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,217
Rooney! Rooney.

398
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,551
Yes, yes.

399
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,346
Listen here, pay attention.
I changed my mind.

400
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,848
I want you out
in front of the school with her.

401
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,392
I'd like to have a few words with you,
by God.

402
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,730
On second thought,
we don't have time to talk right now.

403
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,358
We'll get together soon
and we'll have lunch.

404
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,693
What the hell is wrong with you?

405
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,655
Wait.

406
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,115
- Where's your brain?
- Why'd you kick me?

407
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,741
- Where's your brain?
- Why'd you kick me?

408
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,202
- Where's your brain?
- I asked you first.

409
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,123
How can we pick up Sloane
if Rooney is there with her?

410
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,461
I said for her to be there alone
and you freaked.

411
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,635
Now, I didn't... I didn't hit you.
I lightly slapped you.

412
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,554
You hit me.

413
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,351
Look, don't ask me
to participate in your stupid crap

414
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,562
if you don't like the way I do it.

415
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,275
You make me get out of bed.
You make me come over here.

416
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,403
You make me make a phony phone call
to Edward Rooney?

417
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,616
The man could squash my nuts
into oblivion, and then,

418
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,077
and then,
you deliberately hurt my feelings.

419
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,372
No, I did not deliberately...
I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.

420
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,958
- Really?
- Really, no. No, I didn't.

421
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,254
What are you doing?

422
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,006
See you later, pal, I'm going home.

423
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,050
- No, no, come on, don't do that.
- Have a nice life.

424
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,262
Cameron, wait a minute.
Cameron, come back.

425
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,349
I didn't mean to lose my temper.
I'm sorry. It was uncalled for.

426
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,853
- You serious?
- Yeah.

427
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,987
Here you go.

428
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,574
Thank you.

429
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,995
You did screw up, though, right?

430
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,168
I mean, not that it was
completely your fault.

431
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,630
- Why?
- Well,

432
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,758
to fix the situation

433
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,636
I'm gonna have to
ask you for a small favor.

434
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:16,407
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California.

435
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,538
Less than 100 were made.

436
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,167
My father spent
three years restoring this car.

437
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,505
It is his love, it is his passion...

438
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,841
It is his fault he didn't lock the garage.

439
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,179
Ferris, what are you talking about?

440
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,936
Ferris, my father loves this car
more than life itself.

441
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,357
A man with priorities so far out of whack
doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.

442
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,403
No. No.

443
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,448
- Apparently you don't understand.
- Wow.

444
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,701
Ferris, he never drives it.

445
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,120
He just rubs it with a diaper.

446
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,208
Hey, remember how insane he went
when I broke my retainer?

447
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,255
Come on, that was a little piece
of plastic, this is a Ferrari.

448
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,512
Cameron, I'm sorry,
but we can't pick up Sloane in your car.

449
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,391
Mr. Rooney would never believe
Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit.

450
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,395
- It's not a piece of shit.
- It is a piece of shit.

451
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,774
Don't worry about it, I don't even have
a piece of shit, I have to envy yours.

452
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,151
Thanks.

453
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:38,573
Look, I'm sorry,
there's nothing else we can do.

454
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,755
- He knows the mileage, Ferris.
- He doesn't trust you?

455
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,759
- Never has, never will.
- Look, this is real simple.

456
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:01,095
Whatever miles we put on,
we'll take off.

457
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,598
- How?
- We'll drive home backwards.

458
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,060
No. No!

459
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,355
Ferris, forget it. You're just gonna
have to think of something else.

460
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,148
I'm putting my foot down.

461
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,777
How about we rent a nice Cadillac?
My treat.

462
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,155
We could call a limo!

463
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,284
A nice stretch job with a TV and a bar.

464
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,744
How about that?

465
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,124
Come on, live a little.

466
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,924
Once again, let me tell you how deeply
saddened I am by your loss. I...

467
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,134
I had a grandmother, once.

468
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,554
Two, actually.

469
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,100
Deficits. Who will have to pay that
eventually? Anyone? Anyone know?

470
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,520
"Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live

471
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,188
"and is full of misery

472
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,775
"He cometh up
and is cut down like a flow'r

473
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,569
"He flee'th as if it were a shadow

474
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,739
"and never continueth in one stay"

475
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,368
Oh, dear.

476
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,333
Between grief and nothing,

477
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,836
I'll take grief.

478
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:17,964
Great.

479
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,683
Oh, Sloane, dear.

480
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,018
Hurry along now.

481
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,148
I guess that's my dad.

482
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,150
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

483
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,863
Mr. Rooney...

484
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:47,827
- Ed, you're a beautiful man.
- Thank you.

485
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,540
I wanna thank you
for your warmth and compassion.

486
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:57,128
Higher "what" rates? Anyone?

487
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,924
Higher marginal rates on your taxes.
Any questions so far?

488
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,217
Shit.

489
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,389
- Hi.
- Do you have a kiss for Daddy?

490
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,932
Are you kidding?

491
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,571
So, that's how it is in their family.

492
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,538
- Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?
- Hi, Sloane. No.

493
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,460
What are we gonna do?

494
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,087
The question isn't:
What are we going to do?

495
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,048
The question is:
What aren't we going to do?

496
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,883
Don't say we're not going
to take the car home.

497
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,177
Please don't say we're not going
to take the car home.

498
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,262
If you had access to a car like this,

499
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,473
would you take it back right away?

500
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,017
Neither would I.

501
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,467
Hey, Ferris, don't go so fast!

502
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,303
- Red line, red line, red line.
- Ferris, get out!

503
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,572
Thank you.

504
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,698
Save Ferris.

505
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,116
God loves you, you're very generous.

506
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,868
Save Ferris, save Ferris.

507
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,787
Save Ferris Bueller. Save Ferris.

508
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,873
- Save Ferris?
- What?

509
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,918
Well, see, we're collecting money
to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

510
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,212
and they run about $50,000,
so if you could help out...

511
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,090
- Go piss up a flagpole.
- I'm sorry?

512
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,134
- You should be.
- Hey...

513
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,844
Hey! Hey...

514
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,220
What if you need a favor someday

515
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,222
from Ferris Bueller?
Then where will you be, huh?

516
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,807
You heartless wench.

517
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,893
Peterson home on line one.

518
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:03,731
- And watch your mouth this time.
- Go soak your head.

519
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,235
We can't come to the phone right now.

520
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,573
We've had a death in the family.

521
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,116
Grace,

522
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,119
Ferris Bueller's behind this.
There is no doubt in my mind.

523
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,872
And now he's got Sloane Peterson
involved in this thing.

524
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,791
Her grandmother, too.

525
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,669
You pinhead.

526
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,922
If you need to reach us we'll be
at the following number.

527
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,930
Okay.

528
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,433
I did not achieve this position in life
by having some snot-nosed punk

529
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,352
leave my cheese out in the wind.

530
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,105
You have reached
the Coughlin Brothers Mortuary.

531
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,024
We are deeply sorry we are unable
to come to the phone right now,

532
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,776
but if you leave your name and number,

533
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,779
we'll get back to you
as soon as is humanly possible.

534
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,411
Something's going on, goddamn it.

535
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,872
And I'm gonna find out what it is.

536
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,459
I'm gonna catch this kid and I'm gonna
put one hell of a dent in his future.

537
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,965
Fifteen years from now when he looks
back on the ruin his life's become,

538
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,467
he is going to remember
Edward Rooney.

539
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,366
- Wrong.
- What?

540
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,326
Not here.

541
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,163
We're not leaving the car here.

542
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,039
- Why not?
- Because we're not.

543
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,333
I want the car back home
where it belongs, right now.

544
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,418
Come on, let's go.

545
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,504
Cameron, what's gonna happen to it?
It's in a garage.

546
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,008
It could get wrecked, stolen, scratched,

547
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,386
breathed on wrong, a pigeon
could shit on it. Who knows?

548
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,555
Listen, will you calm down, please?

549
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,932
I'm gonna give the guy $5 to watch it.

550
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,476
What guy?

551
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,193
Hey, how you doing?

552
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,695
Do you speak English?

553
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,991
What country do you think this is?

554
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,744
Okay. Listen,

555
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,581
I want you to take extra
special care of this vehicle. Okay?

556
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,374
- Hey, no problem.
- Great.

557
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,876
Trust me.

558
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,213
- Sir?
- Come on.

559
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:33,798
Come.

560
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,352
Relax.

561
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:57,071
You fellows have nothing
to worry about. I'm a professional.

562
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,365
Professional what?

563
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,586
See what a finski can do
to a guy's attitude?

564
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,713
Cameron, come on.

565
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,508
Come on, come on.

566
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,895
Paper?

567
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,441
Hey, look at that.

568
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,785
Go! Go!

569
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,209
Bless his little heart.

570
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,848
Nine times.

571
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,771
- Ferris, you think the car's all right?
- Sure.

572
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,690
This is the world's tallest building.

573
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,192
Ferris, I don't feel too good.
Can we leave soon?

574
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,987
1,353 feet up in the air...

575
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,905
Here, climb up on this.

576
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,034
Come on, everybody.

577
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,619
Cameron.

578
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,330
Okay, now

579
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,250
lean forward against the glass like this.

580
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:00,629
Oh, my God.

581
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,089
Isnt that great?

582
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,926
The city looks so peaceful from up here.

583
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:10,097
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet.

584
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,183
I think I see my dad.

585
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,396
We got a lot to do, let's go.

586
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,273
Shit.

587
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,277
The son of a bitch
is down there somewhere.

588
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,885
- You want to get married?
- Sure.

589
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,220
Today?

590
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,890
I'm serious.

591
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:57,311
- I'm not getting married.
- Why not?

592
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,147
What do you mean, "Why not?"
Think about it.

593
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,816
Well, no, besides being too young,

594
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,651
having no place to live,

595
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,989
you feeling a little awkward about being
the only cheerleader with a husband,

596
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,033
give me one good reason why not.

597
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,661
I'll give you two good reasons why not:
My mother and my father.

598
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,706
They're married
and they hate each other.

599
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,124
You've seen them. Am I right?

600
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,794
- So what?
- Well, it's like that car.

601
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,922
He loves the car. He hates his wife.

602
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,556
Thank you.

603
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,533
Can we please get the hell out of here?

604
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,327
This place gives me the creeps.

605
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,498
Why didn't you tell me
we were coming to a...

606
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,795
- Hello, may I help you?
- You can sure as hell try.

607
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,547
Hi. I'm Abe Froman.

608
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,507
Party of three for 12:00.

609
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,971
Is there a problem?

610
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,266
- You are Abe Froman?
- That's right. I'm Abe Froman.

611
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,393
The sausage king of Chicago?

612
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,564
Yeah. That's me.

613
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,898
Listen, young man,

614
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,817
entre nous, I'm very busy here.

615
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,154
Why don't you take the kids
and go back to the clubhouse?

616
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,825
Are you suggesting
that I'm not who I say I am?

617
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,953
I'm suggesting that you leave
before I have to get snooty.

618
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,621
- Snooty?
- Snotty.

619
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,624
- Snotty?
- Okay, Abe, let's go.

620
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,253
No, I'm not going anywhere.
No, we'd like to be seated.

621
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,922
Listen, young man,
either you take the field trip outside

622
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,758
or I'm going to have to call the police.

623
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,926
The...

624
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,387
- You're gonna call the police on me?
- Yes.

625
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,473
Fine. As a matter of fact,
I'll call them myself.

626
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:02,436
Yes. Call the police.

627
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,189
This'll be a hoot.

628
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,238
Here, give me the phone.
I have another call.

629
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,324
- No.
- I've had enough of this horsing around.

630
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:18,285
- Give me the phone back.
- You touch me, I yell, "Rat."

631
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,704
There's another phone
around here somewhere. Find it.

632
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,456
Wonderful.

633
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,126
I weep for the future.

634
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,591
Okay, Ferris,
can we just let it go, please?

635
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:36,178
Ferris, please. You've gone too far.
You're gonna get busted.

636
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,474
A: You can never go too far.

637
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,144
B: If I'm gonna get busted,
it is not gonna be by a guy like that.

638
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,605
Come on, "Abe."

639
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,649
Ask for Abe Froman.

640
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,985
- Chez Quis, bonjour.
- May I speak to Abe Froman,

641
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,365
- the sausage king of Chicago?
- Abe Froman?

642
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,243
Let me check the restaurant.

643
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,745
Could you describe him for me, please?

644
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,958
Leather jacket,
white T-shirt, sweater vest.

645
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,127
He's devastatingly handsome.

646
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,340
- Hold on one moment.
- Yes, thank you.

647
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,772
Mr. Froman, this is
Sergeant Peterson, Chicago Police.

648
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:36,321
- I appreciate your understanding.
- Don't think twice.

649
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,241
It's understanding that makes it possible

650
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,369
for people like us
to tolerate a person like yourself.

651
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,041
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

652
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,714
Enjoy your lunch.

653
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,926
Darling, you were wonderful.

654
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,938
Cameron, dear friend,

655
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:13,900
you thought we wouldn't have any fun.
Shame on you.

656
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,782
Maybe I'm overreacting.

657
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,577
Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.

658
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,748
After all, I got a car. He got a computer.

659
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,125
But still,

660
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:34,588
why should he get to do whatever
he wants, whenever he wants?

661
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,591
Why should
everything work out for him?

662
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,927
What makes him so goddamn special?

663
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,555
Screw him.

664
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:47,267
I used to think that my family was
the only one that had weirdness in it.

665
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,770
That used to worry me.

666
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,106
Then I saw
how Cameron's family functioned.

667
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,442
His home life is really twisted.

668
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,946
That's why he's sick all the time.
It really bothers him.

669
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,575
He's the only guy I know
who feels better when he's sick.

670
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:08,955
If I had to live in that house,
I'd probably pray for disease, too.

671
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,291
The place is like a museum.

672
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,919
It's very beautiful and very cold

673
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,797
and you're not allowed
to touch anything.

674
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,300
Can you appreciate
what it must have been like

675
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,178
for Cameron
to be in that joint as a baby?

676
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,724
I'm actually amazed
that I got the car out of the garage.

677
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,311
I caught Cameron digging the ride
once or twice.

678
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,230
It's good for him.

679
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,565
It teaches him to deal with his fear.

680
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,986
Plus, and I must be honest here,

681
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:43,615
I love driving it. It is so choice.

682
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,285
If you have the means,
I highly recommend picking one up.

683
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,289
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

684
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,582
Mint.

685
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,222
Well, hello, Jeanie.
Who's bothering you now?

686
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,723
Is Mr. Rooney in?

687
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,226
No, I'm sorry, he's not. Can I help you?

688
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,603
I seriously doubt it. When's he back?

689
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,105
I don't know.

690
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,066
He's left the school grounds
on personal business.

691
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,943
What's that supposed to mean?

692
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:24,030
I suppose it means it's personal and
it's none of your business, young lady.

693
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,033
Nice attitude.

694
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,829
Isn't Mrs. Hagel
expecting you in consumer ed. Class?

695
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,164
Probably.

696
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,172
What a little asshole.

697
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:43,258
Dave, you've got to consider
raising your advertising budget.

698
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,926
- We don't have the money.
- Dave,

699
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,388
if you wanna sell, you have to spend.
It's as simple as that.

700
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,559
Four thousand restaurants
in the downtown area.

701
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,269
I pick the one my father goes to.

702
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,813
- We're pinched, for sure.
- No way, Cameron.

703
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,566
Only the meek get pinched.
The bold survive.

704
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,193
Let's go.

705
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,778
- Let's surrender.
- Never.

706
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,786
Dave, I know it sounds like
I'm beating a dead horse on this one.

707
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,622
But I'm telling you,
that that's not the case.

708
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,248
We don't have the money.
We don't have the...

709
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,584
Dave, you're one of the
brightest guys in this business.

710
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,462
You know what it takes
to push this over the top.

711
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,672
We're gonna go heavy on TV

712
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,508
and lighten up on the radio
and the print. Okay?

713
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,760
- He's got the money.
- Look, come on back to my office.

714
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,553
- I'll lay out the entire...
- He's got the money.

715
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,639
Dave, we know you've got the money.

716
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:33,767
We just have to spend it.
That's all, you bonehead.

717
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,072
Bueller.

718
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:45,672
Les jeux sont faits.
Translation: The game is up.

719
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,341
Your ass is mine.

720
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,538
Runner at first base, nobody out.

721
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,793
That's the first hit they've had
since the fifth inning,

722
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,630
only the fourth hit in the game.

723
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,216
0 and 2, the count.

724
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,260
There's a drive,

725
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:36,431
left field, twisting, and into foul territory.

726
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:41,811
Boy, I'm really surprised
they didn't go for it in that inning.

727
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,772
Lee Smith.

728
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,983
- What's the score?
- Nothing, nothing.

729
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,735
Who's winning?

730
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,404
The Bears.

731
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,740
There's the ball,
bunted foul back to the screen.

732
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,326
Boy, I don't know...

733
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,671
Think I broke my thumb.

734
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,591
Hey batter, batter, batter, batter, batter,
swing, batter. Come on.

735
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,969
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter,
swing, batter.

736
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,765
He can't hit, he can't hit, he can't hit,
swing, batter.

737
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,688
Hey, Cameron.

738
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,191
Do you realize if we played by the rules,
right now we'd be in gym?

739
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,612
Keep moving, keep moving.

740
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,239
You're up now.

741
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,075
Come on,
get the piano off that back. Let's go.

742
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,619
Come on, boys, let's go.

743
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,831
You'll never get out of here. Move!

744
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,543
Come on, move!

745
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:53,967
I hate him.

746
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,177
Who is it?

747
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,978
It's Ed Rooney, Ferris.
I'd like to have a word with you.

748
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,565
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

749
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,776
I'm afraid that
in my weakened condition,

750
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,487
I could take a nasty spill
down the stairs and subject myself

751
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,530
to further school absences.

752
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,158
Save it, Ferris. Come down here.

753
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,827
You can reach my parents
at their places of business.

754
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,413
Thank you for stopping by.

755
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:08,041
I appreciate your concern
for my well-being.

756
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,961
I am not leaving till you come down
and talk to me, Ferris.

757
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,505
Have a nice day.

758
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,298
You're in big trouble, buster!

759
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,674
Get down here!

760
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,220
Ferris.

761
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,680
Ferris!

762
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,108
Who is it?

763
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,486
You know goddamn well who it is!

764
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,697
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

765
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,242
I'm afraid that
in my weakened condition,

766
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,953
I could take a nasty spill
down the stairs and subject myself

767
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,038
to further school absences.

768
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,918
You can reach my parents
at their places of business.

769
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,756
Thank you for stopping by.

770
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,592
I appreciate your concern
for my well-being.

771
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,679
Have a nice day.

772
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:15,775
Damn it.

773
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,951
Oh, mud.

774
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,107
Bueller, you son of a bitch.

775
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,784
My shoe.

776
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,087
Damn it.

777
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,677
Oh, shit.

778
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,678
Not sure about this family.

779
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,884
Hi, doggie.

780
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,433
Stay, boy.

781
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,312
No, no. Stay. Stay.

782
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,273
Sit.

783
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,860
Sit.

784
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,904
Heel. Stay.

785
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:07,441
And passing the reviewing stand now,

786
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,696
Silbernen Ritter Drum and Bugle Corps.

787
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,910
The United German-American
Male and Female Caucus.

788
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,246
The Empire German-Americans.

789
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,840
It's getting late, buddy,
we better go get the car back home.

790
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,924
- What?
- What do you...

791
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,135
We have a few hours.
We have until 6:00.

792
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,221
I'm sorry, I mean, I know you
don't care, but it does mean my ass.

793
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,016
- You think I don't care?
- I know you don't care.

794
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,478
Oh, that hurts, Cameron.

795
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:49,317
- Cameron, what have you seen today?
- Nothing good.

796
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,277
Nothing...

797
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,280
Nothing good? This...

798
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,200
What do you mean, "Nothing good"?
We've seen everything good!

799
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,035
We've seen the whole city!

800
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,330
We went to a museum,
we saw priceless works of art.

801
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:04,790
We ate pancreas.

802
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,001
Saw... What?

803
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,212
What's wrong?

804
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,804
Look over there.

805
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,046
What's he doing?

806
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,716
He's licking the glass and making
obscene gestures with his hands.

807
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:56,968
What?

808
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,435
Don't! Don't.

809
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,799
He didn't leave.
He's probably doing something.

810
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,135
No, it really busts my hump, you know?

811
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,305
Oh, Cameron, he didn't ditch us
or anything. He's here.

812
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,557
For all we know,
he went back to school.

813
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,809
He would not go back to school.

814
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,145
Yeah, he'd do it.
He'd just do it just to make me sweat.

815
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,980
No, he would not. Cameron, come on.

816
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,440
Makes me mad.

817
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,735
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're such a wonderful crowd.

818
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,862
We'd like to play a little tune for you.

819
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,156
It's one of my personal favorites

820
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,241
and I'd like to dedicate it
to a young man

821
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,161
who doesn't think
he's seen anything good today.

822
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,830
Cameron Frye, this one's for you.

823
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,716
- Ferris! Get off of the float!
- What are you doing?

824
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,344
Get off the float! I can't believe you.

825
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,638
How'd you get up there?
You're out of your mind!

826
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,844
You know, as long as I've known him
everything works for him.

827
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:07,765
There's nothing he can't handle.
I can't handle anything.

828
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,769
School, parents, the future...

829
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,314
Ferris can do anything.

830
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,694
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

831
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,158
- College.
- Yeah. But to do what?

832
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,372
What are you interested in?

833
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:35,543
Nothing.

834
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,046
Me neither.

835
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:47,972
You're crazy!

836
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,643
What do you think Ferris is gonna do?

837
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:57,022
He's gonna be a fry cook at Venus.

838
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,243
Christ.

839
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,960
Poochie, poochie, poochie.

840
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,714
Look what Uncle Ed has for you,
you little fucker.

841
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:16,972
Jeez.

842
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,440
Sleep tight, pooch.

843
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:53,967
I knew it!

844
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,105
Well, where is she?

845
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,941
Look, this is her daughter.

846
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,406
Well, do you know where she is?

847
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,741
Do you know when she'll be back?

848
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,743
Do you know anything?

849
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,295
Ferris.

850
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,005
Bueller.

851
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,009
- Ha!
- Ya!

852
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,695
You're psychotic. You are, man.

853
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,323
You're out of your goddamn mind.
I can't believe you did that.

854
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,533
I can't believe you went
on a goddamn parade float!

855
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,579
Okay, okay, wait. No, okay, wait. Okay.

856
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:49,875
"Yeah, yeah. This tune is one of
my personal favorites."

857
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,877
You're out of your mind.

858
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,712
Do you realize
how many people saw you?

859
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:54,963
- You're nailed.
- No, no.

860
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,298
- You are. You're nailed.
- You are.

861
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,092
Who'd believe that I was in a parade?
Who the hell am I?

862
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,678
Besides, anybody who would nail me
wouldn't go to a parade.

863
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,723
- My mother would.
- I'm not worried about your mother.

864
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,475
That was so quick.

865
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:09,770
Hey.

866
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,440
This looks okay to me, Cameron.

867
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,400
Looks great, let's roll.

868
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,238
Here you go. Nice job. Thank you.

869
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:23,200
You're a very generous individual.
Come back anytime.

870
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:26,286
- Right, okay. Watch the seat.
- Thanks a lot.

871
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:27,704
Sorry.

872
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:35,337
- Have a good night.
- Bye, you guys.

873
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,464
- Yeah, see you later.
- Later.

874
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,012
Yeah, man, we gotta do this again.

875
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,393
Look, this...
This is not a phony phone call.

876
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:53,605
There is an intruder, male,
Caucasian, possibly armed,

877
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,275
certainly weird, in my kitchen.

878
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:59,820
Yeah, my, my... My name's Bueller.

879
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,241
It's real nice that
you hope my brother's feeling better,

880
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,451
but I'm in danger, okay? I am very cute.

881
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,246
I am very alone.
And I'm very protective of my body.

882
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,165
I do not want it violated,
or killed, all right?

883
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,001
I need help!

884
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,211
Speak-a de English?

885
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:18,964
Dickhead.

886
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,434
God.

887
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,395
Excuse me.

888
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,480
Whoever's in the house
is still in the house,

889
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,066
I'd like you to know that
I've just called the police.

890
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,860
So if you have any brains whatsoever,

891
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,654
you'll get your ass out of
my house real quick.

892
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,658
I'd also like to add
that I have my father's gun

893
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,744
and a scorching case of herpes.

894
01:10:57,295 --> 01:11:00,005
Hey, wait, wait, wait. That's my car!
I'll move it!

895
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,093
He got my keys!

896
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,513
You shithead!

897
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,568
I feel pretty good.

898
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:23,612
- Yeah?
- I feel real good.

899
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,657
Those guys... Those guys were nice,
huh? At the garage.

900
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,533
I was a little worried about them.

901
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,535
Turned out good.

902
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:36,833
Hey.

903
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,547
- Cameron?
- Yeah?

904
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,302
How many miles did you say
this thing had on it when we left?

905
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,596
One hundred and twenty-six

906
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:51,682
and halfway between
three and four-tenths.

907
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:53,809
Why?

908
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,396
How many miles are on it now?

909
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,695
Here's where Cameron goes berserk.

910
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,843
Cameron. Are you okay? Cam?

911
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,345
Cameron, cut that out.

912
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,017
Who is it?

913
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,979
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

914
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,440
I'm afraid that
in my weakened condition,

915
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,526
I could take a nasty spill
down the stairs and subject myself...

916
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,528
God bless the police.

917
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,740
I'm saved. Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you, thank you. You are the best.

918
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,283
Have a nice day.

919
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,367
Thank...

920
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:56,038
I heard that you were feeling ill.

921
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,332
Headache, fever, and a chill.

922
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,919
I came to help restore your pluck

923
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,464
'cause I'm the nurse who likes to...

924
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,723
This may very well be for real.

925
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,603
I think Cameron might have blown
a microchip or two.

926
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,147
He's always been a little keyed up.

927
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,150
All I wanted to do
was give him a good day.

928
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,571
We're gonna graduate
in a couple of months and then

929
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:33,200
we'll have the summer.
He'll work and I'll work.

930
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,245
We'll see each other at night
and on the weekends.

931
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:40,791
Then he'll go to one school
and I'll go to another.

932
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,835
Basically that will be it.

933
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,091
Sloane's as big a problem.

934
01:13:50,802 --> 01:13:52,761
She still has another year
of high school.

935
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,554
How do I deal with that?

936
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:58,183
I was serious when I said
I would marry her.

937
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,851
I would.

938
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,854
Cameron? Cam?

939
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,190
Can you hear me?

940
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,401
Cameron?

941
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,947
Blink if you understand me.

942
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,866
Cameron has never been in love.

943
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,619
At least nobody's ever been
in love with him.

944
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:23,375
If things don't change for him,
he's gonna marry the first girl he lays.

945
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,710
And she's gonna treat him like shit

946
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:30,632
because she will have given him
what he has built up in his mind

947
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,593
as the end-all,
be-all of human existence.

948
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,887
She won't respect him.

949
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,766
'Cause you can't respect somebody
who kisses your ass.

950
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,102
Just doesn't work.

951
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,397
Ferris. We better try something else.

952
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,399
This isn't working.

953
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,489
You feeling any better, Cameron?

954
01:14:57,577 --> 01:15:01,371
Cam, why don't you come in here?
It's really nice.

955
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:08,003
Cameron, I could flip out real easy, too.

956
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:09,963
It's okay.

957
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,134
Sooner or later
everybody goes to the zoo.

958
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,517
Maybe he's really sick.

959
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,937
Maybe he isn't just torturing himself.

960
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:09,147
Hey.

961
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,942
Hey, hey.

962
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:13,985
Hey, Cameron.

963
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:16,529
Cam. Cameron, wake up!

964
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,740
Come on, wake up. Hey, wake up.

965
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,743
Oh, shit, Cameron, come on. Cameron!

966
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,286
Come on, wake up!

967
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:24,788
Hey.

968
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:29,251
What is that?

969
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,170
Ferris Bueller, you're my hero.

970
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:36,007
- You're kidding?
- Wow, that was pretty impressive, man.

971
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,134
You bitch. Oh, you son of a bitch.

972
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,222
Come on.

973
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:43,473
Tarzan.

974
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,644
Sheena!

975
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:15,588
Drugs?

976
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:20,135
Thank you, no. I'm straight.

977
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,430
I meant, are you in here for drugs?

978
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,727
- Why are you here?
- Drugs.

979
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,521
I don't know why I'm here.

980
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,565
Why don't you go home?

981
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,735
Why don't you put
your thumb up your butt?

982
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,659
You wear too much eye make-up.

983
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:50,957
My sister wears too much.

984
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,418
People think she's a whore.

985
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,593
You don't wanna
talk about your problem?

986
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,721
- With you? Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

987
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,057
Blow yourself.

988
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,773
All right,
you wanna know what's wrong?

989
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,609
I know what's wrong.

990
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,236
I just wanna hear you say it.

991
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,989
In a nutshell, I hate my brother.

992
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,283
- How's that?
- That's cool.

993
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:27,827
Did you blow him away or something?

994
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,497
No, not yet.

995
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,627
See, I went home
to confirm that the shithead

996
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,712
was ditching school
and when I was there,

997
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:39,297
a guy broke into the house.

998
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:43,093
I called the cops and they picked me up
for making a phony phone call.

999
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,929
What do you care
if your brother ditches school?

1000
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:50,183
Why should he get to ditch,
when everybody else has to go?

1001
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,853
- You could ditch.
- Yeah, I'd get caught.

1002
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,314
I see.

1003
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:00,777
So you're pissed off 'cause he ditches
and doesn't get caught, is that it?

1004
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,657
- Basically.
- Basically.

1005
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,327
Then your problem is you.

1006
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,038
- Excuse me?
- Excuse you.

1007
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:15,250
You ought to spend a little more time
dealing with yourself

1008
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:18,503
a little less time worrying about
what your brother does.

1009
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:20,422
That's just an opinion.

1010
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:23,425
- What are you, a psychiatrist?
- No.

1011
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:26,094
Then why don't you keep
your opinions to yourself?

1012
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,517
There's somebody you should talk to.

1013
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:40,567
If you say "Ferris Bueller,"
you lose a testicle.

1014
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,777
Oh, you know him?

1015
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:54,873
You know, that whole time
I was just thinking things over.

1016
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:00,545
I was, like... I was, like, meditating.

1017
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:06,593
Then I sort of watched myself
from inside.

1018
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,889
I realized it was ridiculous

1019
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:16,478
being afraid, worrying about everything,

1020
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:20,106
wishing I was dead. All that shit.
I'm tired of it.

1021
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,737
It's the best day of my life.

1022
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,244
I'm gonna miss you guys next year.

1023
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:45,924
Cameron? Can I ask you a question?

1024
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,052
Yeah.

1025
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,265
Did you see me change out
of my clothes by the Jacuzzi?

1026
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,269
Did you?

1027
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:01,898
You saw me?

1028
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,943
I thought you were catatonic.

1029
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,115
That's okay.

1030
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:13,868
I'm not embarrassed.

1031
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,915
I better check on the car.

1032
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,013
Hey, Ferris!

1033
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:36,724
Yeah?

1034
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,729
The miles aren't coming off.

1035
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,817
The miles aren't coming off
going in reverse.

1036
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,826
Well, I thought that might be a problem.

1037
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,788
Just have to crack open the odometer,
roll it back by hand.

1038
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,749
No. Forget it.

1039
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,003
Forget it.

1040
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,844
I gotta take a stand.

1041
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,933
I'm bullshit.

1042
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,189
I put up with everything.

1043
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:32,238
My old man pushes me around.

1044
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,201
I never say anything!

1045
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:44,584
Well, he's not the problem.
I'm the problem.

1046
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,259
I gotta take a stand.

1047
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,931
I gotta take a stand against him.

1048
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,604
I am not gonna sit on my ass

1049
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:08,733
as the events that affect me unfold
to determine the course of my life.

1050
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,443
I'm gonna take a stand.

1051
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,863
I'm gonna defend it.

1052
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,450
Right or wrong, I'm gonna defend it.

1053
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,714
I'm so sick of his shit!

1054
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:35,968
I can't stand him,
and I hate this goddamn car.

1055
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:39,389
Who do you love? Who do you love?
You love a car.

1056
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,016
You son of a bitch.

1057
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,040
Shit.

1058
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,837
I dented the shit out of it.

1059
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:16,718
Good.

1060
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:24,642
My father will come home,
he'll see what I did. I can't hide this.

1061
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:31,023
He'll come home, he'll see what I did.
He'll have to deal with me.

1062
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:34,110
I don't care, I really don't.

1063
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,905
I'm just tired of being afraid.

1064
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,497
Hell with him.

1065
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,296
I can't wait to see the look
on the bastard's face.

1066
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,535
What'd I do?

1067
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:39,884
- What'd I do?
- You killed the car.

1068
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,632
Whoa.

1069
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,262
Holy shit.

1070
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,111
Cameron, it's my fault.

1071
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:41,946
I'll take the heat for it.

1072
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,489
We'll wait for your father to come home

1073
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:45,491
and when he gets here,
I'll tell him that I did it.

1074
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:46,993
He hates me anyway.

1075
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,501
No. I'll take it.

1076
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,128
No, I'll take it.

1077
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:00,047
No. No, you don't want this much heat.

1078
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,674
I want it. If I didn't want it,

1079
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,885
I wouldn't have let you
take the car out this morning.

1080
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:06,262
I made you take the car this morning.

1081
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:07,972
I could've stopped you.

1082
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,183
It is possible to stop
Mr. Ferris Bueller, you know?

1083
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:14,186
No, I want it. I'm gonna take it. That's it.

1084
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:17,648
When Morris comes home,

1085
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,943
he and I'll just have a little chat.

1086
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,030
It's cool.

1087
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,824
No, it's gonna be good.

1088
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,911
Thanks anyway.

1089
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,421
This is a shock to me.

1090
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,090
I mean, first of all, I don't know
why she wasn't in school.

1091
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,343
And second of all, I just can't believe

1092
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,929
she came to you
with this story about an intruder.

1093
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:52,099
Well, for whatever reason she did it,
I think she's had a pretty good scare.

1094
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:55,102
Well, I really appreciate your calling me.
Really.

1095
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,146
I can assure you that her father
and I are going

1096
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,273
to have a long talk
with her when we get home.

1097
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:00,733
Thank you so much.

1098
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:04,779
Oh, by the way,
I hope your son is feeling better.

1099
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:06,197
I beg your pardon?

1100
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,200
Tell him all the guys
at the station here are pulling for him.

1101
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,243
Oh, right.

1102
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,214
- Hi.
- Don't "hi" me, young lady.

1103
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,508
- I wanna get out of here, now, all right?
- Okay.

1104
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:27,176
No, now. Let's get out of here.

1105
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,928
- Okay.
- Okay?

1106
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,012
- Yes.
- Now.

1107
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,097
Fine.

1108
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,640
Okay.

1109
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:41,065
- She's a little hyper.
- Yeah.

1110
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:48,072
Let's not ruin this
with a lot of talk, all right? Okay?

1111
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,492
You didn't tell me your name.

1112
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:57,331
Well, it's Jean,
but, a lot of guys call me Shauna.

1113
01:28:58,417 --> 01:28:59,750
Okay, Jean.

1114
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:01,335
Cool.

1115
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,088
That's great.

1116
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,799
I'll see you, okay?

1117
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,010
Yeah.

1118
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,098
Jeanie, now!

1119
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:18,227
- Now!
- Okay!

1120
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:27,903
I had a great time today.

1121
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,323
Yeah. It was pretty cool.

1122
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:36,245
Do you...
Do you think Cameron's gonna be okay?

1123
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:37,371
Oh, yeah.

1124
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:40,624
Yeah, sure. For the first time in his life.

1125
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,626
He's gonna be just fine.

1126
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:54,472
You knew what you were doing when
you woke up this morning, didn't you?

1127
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,641
Me? No.

1128
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:20,915
Oh, shit. I have to go.

1129
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,919
- I'll call you tonight.
- Okay.

1130
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,675
- I love you!
- I love you, too!

1131
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,346
He's gonna marry me.

1132
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:41,811
Do you know what it's like
to be pulled out of work

1133
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:44,313
to pick up your daughter
at the police station?

1134
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:45,439
No, not really.

1135
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,024
Well, on top of everything else,

1136
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:50,486
I was about to close the damn deal
with the Vermont people.

1137
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:52,113
I'm sorry.

1138
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:57,368
I was gonna take my commission
and buy Ferris a car.

1139
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:03,249
Jeanie, what the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill us?

1140
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,959
God, look at this mess.

1141
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:08,003
Paper all over the place.
I'll never get this back in order.

1142
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:17,471
Jeanie!

1143
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,025
- Slow down! Now! Now!
- I can't drive when you're yelling at me!

1144
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,193
Stop it!

1145
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:03,767
- Hi, how you doing? Ferris Bueller.
- Hi.

1146
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,607
- No, don't get up.
- Hey.

1147
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,192
Smells delicious.

1148
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,611
- Dinner's ready.
- What?

1149
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:39,196
Who's that?

1150
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:15,858
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

1151
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,861
I just picked up Jeanie
at the police station.

1152
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,157
She got a speeding ticket,
another speeding ticket

1153
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,034
and I lost the Vermont deal
because of her.

1154
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,952
I think we should shoot her.

1155
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:35,419
Looking for this?

1156
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,475
I got you, Ferris.

1157
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:52,102
- How's Ferris? Let's go check on him.
- Okay, honey. Yeah.

1158
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,355
How was your day?

1159
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:58,025
I have dreamed about this.

1160
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:03,238
This time, goddamn, you little bastard,

1161
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,408
I've got you right where I want you.

1162
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:08,327
Ferris, we're home.

1163
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,580
So,

1164
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:17,044
how would you feel
about another year of high school?

1165
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:22,299
Under my close personal supervision.

1166
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,052
Hi.

1167
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:31,475
Thank God you're all right. You know,
we've been worried sick about you.

1168
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:38,899
Thank you, Mr. Rooney,
for driving him home.

1169
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:43,612
Now I want you to go upstairs
and get in bed.

1170
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:56,041
Scoot!

1171
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:59,420
Can you imagine
someone as sick as Ferris

1172
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:01,797
trying to walk home from the hospital?

1173
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:04,758
Oh, kids.

1174
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:11,890
By the way, Mr. Rooney,
you left your wallet on the kitchen floor.

1175
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:19,082
Honey.

1176
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:23,754
- He's still awfully warm.
- How do you feel?

1177
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:28,258
150% better. Thank you.

1178
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:31,094
Please,

1179
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:34,765
don't make me stay home again.
I wanna go to school.

1180
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:39,770
I have to graduate in June. And I want...

1181
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:41,813
Ferris, you're sick.

1182
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:44,858
Now don't go pushing it
and making yourself worse.

1183
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,779
- Maybe you're right, Dad.
- I know I'm right, pal.

1184
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:52,950
How'd you get to be so sweet?

1185
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,619
Years of practice.

1186
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:07,130
Blanket.

1187
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:18,642
Get well.

1188
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,728
Come on.

1189
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:28,652
Listen, I'm going to get myself settled
and I'll bring a hot cup of soup, okay?

1190
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:40,330
Yup.

1191
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:43,166
I said it before and I'll say it again.

1192
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,460
Life moves pretty fast.

1193
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:49,590
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it.

1194
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:03,312
Four years of chasing this kid.

1195
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:07,524
Four years he has been
making a fool of me.

1196
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:21,872
Hey, Mr. Rooney, what's going on?

1197
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:27,044
Did you get in a fight?

1198
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:29,713
Want a lift?

1199
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,322
I bet you never smelled
a real school bus before.

1200
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:34,421
Gummy Bear?

1201
01:41:36,048 --> 01:41:39,259
They've been in my pocket.
They're real warm and soft.

1202
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:28,767
You're still here?

1203
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:32,813
It's over.

1204
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:36,024
Go home.

1205
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:42,000
Go.
