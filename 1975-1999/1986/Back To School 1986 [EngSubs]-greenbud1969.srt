What kind of marks is this?

How you gonna go to college?

00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,193
I don't wanna go.
I wanna work with you.

10
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,104
You wanna work with me?

Listen to me.
I say this once and I say it again.

he's got nothing.

14
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,577

- Then try harder.

Hi. Are you a large person? Pleasantly
plump? A little on the hefty side?

18
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,768
On let's face it, are you fat?

19
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,905
When you go jogging,
do you leave potholes?

20

Yes, sir, Mr. Melon.

36

- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

Mr. Melon, we have
a serious offer on your

commercial property in South Florida.

41
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,273
- We feel you should sell.
- Hold it for one more year.

42
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,106
Take the depreciation then transfer

43
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,522
Show it as a capital gain.
We should do great.

44
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,275
What else?

45
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:03,413
The toy division has a new doll idea
to go with our children's clothing.

46
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,542
We call them Melon Patch Kids.

47
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,547
Now the competition exploits the notion
that their dolls are orphans.

48
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,675
The Melon Patch Kids are not orphans.

49
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,801
They're abandoned.

50
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,634
- We think it's a winner.
- Go with it.

51
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,174
- Keep the cost under five bucks.
- [buzzer]

52
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,344
We took a bath
on those Chubby Tubby Tub Toys.

53
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,232
- Jason's on the phone.
- Jason! OK, everybody, take a break.

54
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,691
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Melon,
but we have a very long agenda.

55
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,652
- Later. My son's on the phone.
- But Mr. Melon...

56
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,657

How's the diving going?

59
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,450
It's great.
We just finished our practice.

60
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:52,667
Keep it up. And the fraternity?
I'll bet you're having fun.

61
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,799

Yeah, it's great.

62
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,302
Good, that's great.
Hey, you're not doing too much?

63
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,510
- You're studying?
- Right now we're between semesters.

64
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,345
So classes don't start
for another week.

65
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,554
No classes?

66
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,847
Then come home. Your mother and I
are having a fifth anniversary party.

67
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,517
Whoa, Dad.
She's not my mother, she's your wife.

68
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,482
And she doesn't want me around.

69
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,898
OK, let's not start that again.

70
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,319
- I'll come up there to see you.
- No. Bad, bad idea.

71
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,409
I got this big dive meet.
I gotta practice.

72
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,665
I wouldn't have time to see you.

73
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,700
OK, I understand.

74
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,088
Look, I promise I'll come down and visit
next break I get, all right?

75
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,501
-I gotta go, OK?
- OK, Jason. Take care of yourself.

76
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,389
- I love you.
- I love you too. All right. Bye-bye.

77
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,015
Melon, I told you to clean my locker.

78
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,927
If it's too much,
we'll get a new towel boy.

79
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,769
I'm sorry, Chas. I'll get onto it, OK?

80

Home, sweet home.

81
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,332
- I liked the old house better.
- So did I.

82
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,246
I liked the old wife better too.

83
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,916
Lay off Vanessa.
She gives great headache.

84
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,757

five years. Seems like yesterday.

85
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,342

I have absolutely nothing to wear.

90

You got six closets full of
nothing to wear.

91
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,484
- Are you saying I spend too much money?
- You, too much money? No.

92

Lots of people go to Switzerland
to get their watch fixed.

93

You have no taste, Thornton.

94
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,125
Right. I married you.

95
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,912
No time to argue.
Our friends will be here soon.

96
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,295
Your friends.

97
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,174
They are my friends
and I'd like to keep them.

98
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,130
So behave yourself.

99
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,762
If the roast beef is right,
they'll be back.

in Portofino. Why haven't you called?

103
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,028

- Oh, yes, she is.

104

I thought you were still in Tijuana.

105
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,663
- Excuse me, seňor?
- Nothing, sorry. Give me a beer.

106
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,746
I'm sorry, seňor.
All we have is martinis and Champagne.

107
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,911
My own house, I can't get a beer.

108
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,378

No cerveza.

109

Your wife was showing us her Klimt.

120

You too, huh?
She's shown it to everybody.

121
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,842
She's very proud of it.

122
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,679
I'm proud of mine
but don't wave it about.

123

How are you doing?

135

- Hi there, sir. How are you?
- Not too bad, thank you.

136
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,754
No, I got my own. it's all right.

137
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,964
Millicent, you look charming.
I love your dress.

138
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,054
Don't you, Thornton?
it's such a lovely shade of green.

139
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,471
Yeah, if that dress had pockets,
you'd look like a pool table.

140
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,895
You should try my Tall & Fat stores.
No of fence.

141
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,479
May I speak to you privately, please?

Watch my sandwich, will you?

143

I can't take any more. You've insulted
our friends, you've insulted... me.

144
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,338
- You're set on ruining this party.
- Party? It's a dog show out there.

Your friends come for free booze
and to suck up to you for donations.

146
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,513
You have no class, Thornton,
and I'm tired of it.

147
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,347
- I want a divorce.
- I knew we had something in common.

148

it's not gonna be that easy, honey.

150

This is gonna cost you. Plenty.

151
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:53,740
Oh, yeah? Vanessa,
let's talk about class.

152
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,869
Here's you and Giorgio
in the guest room.

You and Giorgio in the rumpus room.
Another classy one.

154
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,543
This one, I can't figure out. There's
you, Giorgio, what's with the midget?

That one... Hey, wait! I got more.

156
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,560
- What happened?
- What happened? I got rid of Vanessa.

157
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,770
I feel like I got paroled.

158
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,279

Hey, I need some help here!

- Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.

Take it easy, honey,
I didn't see a thing.

185
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,524
You're perfect.

00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,606
[chattering]

187
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,022
Perfectly understandable, Mr. Melon.
It was an honest mistake.

188
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,283
- Let's call it a bad day.
- But a great view.

189
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,242
You're all right, officer.
Here, a little something for the kids.

190
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:50,534
- I don't have any kids.
- Here, get yourself some. Take it all.

191
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,455
Just remember,
the best thing about kids is making 'em.

192
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,417
Even if I do manage to graduate,
what then?

193
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,054
There's the private sector,
but look how bad the job market is.

194
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,715
- There's Valerie Desmond.
- See you guys.

195
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,645
Look how tight her ass is today.

196
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:16,560
Man, do you think there's any way
she would ever go out with me?

197
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,900
- Hmmmm... No.
- Oh, thanks.

198
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,235
It's this whole stupid
capitalist system.

199
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,527
It's set up to reward
the advantaged and the aggressive

200
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,162
and make sure two regular schmoe
like you and me

201
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,449
never get to date girls
like Valerie.

202
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,957
I hate the whole bourgeois mentality
of this school.

203
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,465
Do you make this bullshit up as you go
or do you read it?

204
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,754
No, I read this. it's Karl Marx's
famous Proletarian Chicks In Bondage,

205
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,264
a Condom House book with a leather hood.

206
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,925
- With pictures? Can I borrow it?
- Let's move on.

207
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,393
- Right up.
- Yeah, well, you know...

208
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,432
Aah!

209
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,568
Dad, uh, what are you doing here?

210
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,071
I'm robbing your room, that's what.

211
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,906
We drive 300 miles to see him,
that's the greeting we get. Come here!

212
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,911
[both laugh]

213
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,334
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm glad to see you
but I wish I'd known you were coming.

214
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,463
I'll bet. The fraternity house said
you weren't a member.

215
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,625
- I can explain.
- And you're not on the diving team.

216
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,465
- You're the towel boy.
- I can explain that.

217
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,925
- OK, explain it.
- I lied.

218
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,217
Great, that explains it.
You don't lie to me.

219
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,760
You lie to girls.

220
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,645
Who's this?

221
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,478
Sorry, this is my roommate, Derek Lutz.

222
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,439
This is the dad and this is Lou.

223
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,649
- That your real hair?
- What do you think?

224
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,816
I think you're trying to
get back at your parents.

225
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,984
Show me the campus.
I wanna talk to you.

226
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,447
Oh, good.

227
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,957
Boy, what a great-looking place.

228
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,420
When I dreamed of going to college,
this is how I pictured it.

229
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,505
When did you dream of going to college?

230
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,840
When I used to fall asleep
in high school.

231
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,092
I know how much this means to you.
Sorry I lied.

232
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,808
You don't have to lie.
I'll love you just the same.

233
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,439
- You'll love me no matter what?
- No matter what.

234
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,522
- I'm dropping out.
- You're dropping out?

235
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,062
You just got here. You just started.

236
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:29,109
But I don't fit in. I got one friend,
Derek. He's got no friends.

237
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,700
The girls don't like me,
the fraternities don't want me,

238
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,409
the diving coach won't talk to me.

239
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,251
At least you're getting an education.

240
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,037
Last semester I got nothing but Cs.

241
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,332
A, B, C... in the top three.
Nothing to worry about.

242
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,923
I think I'd be better off getting a job.

243
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,213
You never went to college.
You're doing great.

244
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,007
I said it before and I'll say it again.

245
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,929
However rich or successful a man is,
without an education, he's nothing.

246
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,061
Stay in school, study harder.
You can be whatever you want.

247
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,726
You wanna be a loser, be a loser.

248
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:08,899
Jason, it's up to you. You can do it.
Remember, you're a Melon.

249
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,241
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have to do it.

250
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,949
OK, I'll do it with you.

251
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,083
- What do you mean?
- I mean just what I said.

252
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,589
I'm going to college.
What do you think?

253
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,591
I think you're nuts.

254
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,550
Nuts? Who made the rules?
I'm going to college.

255
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,470
Let me get this straight, Mr. Melon.

256
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,936
You wish to enter this esteemed

257
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,977
Grand Lakes University of ours
as a freshman?

258
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,485
That's right, Dean Martin.

259
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,024
- Are you comfortable?
- Oh, I'm fine, yes.

260
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,158
Oh, the chair. Oh, I'm sorry.

261
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,244
This is an awkward moment
for me, Mr. Melon,

262
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,455
since I realize you're
a highly respected member

263
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,619
of our business community.

264
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,880
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

265
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,633
[sighs] Our student body
here is hand-picked by me

266
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:14,047
from the crème de la crème of students
all across this great land.

267
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,262
- That's one of the things I like here.
- Yes.

268
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,224
Since you have no high school diploma,

269
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,640
and no transcripts of any kind,
no SAT scores,

270
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,527
and you're 30 to 40 years older
than our average freshman,

271
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:32,816
how can this university see its way
clear to accept you as a student?

272
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:38,321
As Coolidge said,
"The business of America is business."

273
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,162
And the business of an educational
institution such as ours

274
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,497
is to create young minds that understand

275
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,257
that the business of America is the kind
of business that it actually is.

276
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,420
So whatever it is that
I have said here today...

277
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,890
The point is that we are here to honor

278
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,927
our most generous benefactor,

279
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,721
And newest freshman,

280
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:08,610
the man who's made it possible for us
to break ground here today,

281
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,987
Mr. Thornton Melon.

282
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,821
Dean Martin, great speech.
Nothing like good, clean business, huh?

283
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,114
And a little monkey business!

284
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,409
Ah, Philip!
I'm so glad you could make it.

285
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:30,753
Mr. Melon, I'd like you to meet
Dr. Philip Barbay,

286
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,211
I want it on record
that I'm totally against this.

287
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,473
I don't think that selling admission
to an unqualified student

288
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,135
is very ethical or honorable.

289
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:47,940
Oh, right, Phil, but I'd just like to
say in all fairness to Mr. Melon,

290
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,226
it was a really big check.

291
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,195
It's a simple matter of this man

292
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,153
undermining the efforts
of our legitimate students,

293
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,615
- who are here as a result of hard work.
- Hard work?

294
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,202
Listen, Sherlock, while you were tucked
away working on your ethics,

295
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,243
I was busting my hump in the real world.

296
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,788
Guys like you got a place to teach
'cause guys like me donate buildings.

297
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,966
I wasn't speaking to you, Mr. Melon.

298
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,097
I don't think Dr. Barbay understands
the actual amounts involved here.

299
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,065
[Dean] Mr. Melon,
will you take the ceremonial shovel?

300
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:34,104
- Thank you.
- And dig into the symbolic verge.

301
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,616
[Melon] I hereby dedicate
this building to...

302
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,779
- ...myself l
- [brass band strikes up]

303
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,969
Dad, it's like we talked about.
Sign up for whatever interests you.

304
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,676
We got to get in the astronomy line
before it closes.

305
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,682
[woman] Hi!

306
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,936
Look at this.
This is worse than the track.

307
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,475
- Want me to move some people?
- No, this is college.

308
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,564
- Let me think.
- What are you gonna do?

309
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,570
Come on, I got an idea.

310
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,650
- Did you get everything?
- I got the Latin, and the Sanskrit.

311
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,820
But they cancelled Ancient Greek,
blew my dead languages motif.

312
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,488
What are you looking at?

313
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,784
- Oh.
- Yeah.

314
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,921
[Valerie] Oh!

315
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,587
You OK?

316
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,174
Yeah.

317
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,559
[laughs] Yeah, I'm fine.

318
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,934
- I'm upset because they closed Botany.
- Those bastards.

319
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,057
Well, I'm not that upset.

320
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,819
Well, I won't be
if I get into Astronomy.

321
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,656
You wanna cut in the line with us?
We're waiting.

322
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,572
- Yes, yes, I would.
- Great. All right.

323
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,282
This is Derek.

324
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,622
. Ha.
- [giggles]

325
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,831
- I'm Valerie Desmond.
- Yeah, I know.

326
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,258
I'm Jason... Melon.

327
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,418
- Hi.
- Hi.

328
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,675
- Hi, Valerie.
- Hi.

329
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,468
- God, you look great.
- Thanks.

330
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,559
[Valerie] Are you taking
Astronomy too?

331
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,850
I guess. I don't want to.
I'm a Business major.

332
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,895
- Mm-hm.
- But they want us to take a science.

333
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,940
- Do you mind if I sneak in line?
- Oh...

334
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:47,454
Actually, these guys were nice enough
to let me in, so it's up to them.

335
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,657
Melon, buddy. What do you say?
Let me in, OK?

336
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,077
I don't think so, Osbourne!

337
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,211
Melon, your friend. Straighten him out.

338
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,749
Chas, there's a lot of people waiting.
It wouldn't be fair.

339
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:05,388
If you got a note from
each and every one of these people

340
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,889
saying it was all right,

341
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,299
then we'd reconsider.

342
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:12,140
But until that day, take a hike,
you elitist fraternity scumbag.

343
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,441
I won't forget this, Melon.

344
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,604
- I'll see you at the pool. Bye.
- Bye.

345
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,647
Thank you. I'm dead.

346
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,405
You're not gonna believe this.
Come on! I'm not kidding!

347
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,492
[excited chatter]

348
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,761
Where is he?

349
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,972
I don't know. I'm supposed to
pick him up here.

350
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,808
- When?
- Now!

351
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,564
Come on, let's register.

352
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,984
- You guys got everything you need?
- We got it.

353
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,030
- Why used books?
- What's wrong with used books?

354
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,325
- They've been read.
- Yeah, and underlined, get it?

355
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,586
The last guy could have been a maniac.

356
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,839
Hey, get these guys some new books.

357
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,796
Charge me. Pick a card.

358
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,135
Then I'll take a four school sweaters,
a bunch of pennants,

359
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:34,018
some of those beer mugs,
a few of these fuzzballs you cheer with.

360
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,225
Hey, folks, it's on me!
Shakespeare for everyone.

361
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,014
[cheering]

362
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,855
You too, honey.
I'd like to tame your shrew!

363
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,772
- Who is that?
- That is Mr. Thornton Melon.

364
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,316
The world's oldest living freshman.

365
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,531
And the walking epitome
of the decline of education.

366
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,912
The clod thinks he can buy
his way out of the gutter.

367
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,575
- He was just having fun.
- Oh, really?

368
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,041
I can't wait to get him in my class.

369
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,082
- We'll see how much fun he is.
- Oh, Philip.

370
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,803
Hey, Mr. M. You're all set.
We've been working all night.

371
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,838
Thanks, Buzzy, I appreciate it.

372
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,383
Add a few hundred to the bill.
Throw a party.

373
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,554
You know what you got, Mr. Melon?
You got class.

374
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,269
It rubbed off from you, Buzzy.
Say hello to Sonia for me.

375
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:26,733
Hey, I want to talk to you about
my schedule. We'll go over it later.

376
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,920
- Well, boys, what do you think?
- [Jason whoops]

377
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,079
A hot tub!

378
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,248
How can you study
if you're not relaxed?

379
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,760
- When's our first class?
- Economics tomorrow at eleven.

380
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,218
I got a massage at eleven.
Tell them to make it two o'clock.

381
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,429
No, Dad, you don't get it.

382
00:27:56,592 --> 00:28:00,438
They're not gonna reschedule classes
around your massage.

383
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,019
All right. But I'm gonna talk
to that Dean.

384
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,310
These classes could be
a real inconvenience.

385
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,108
All right, settle down, people.

386
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,695
We've got a lot to cover,
and time is short.

387
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:20,958
There are two kinds of people
in business, the quick and the dead.

388
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:25,121
So rather than waste your time
this semester

389
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,460
we're jumping in with both feet

390
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,627
and create a fictional company
from the ground up.

391
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,137
We'll construct our physical plant,

392
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,891
we'll set up an efficient
administrative and executive structure,

393
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,600
then we'll manufacture our product
and market it.

394
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,311
I think you'll find it
interesting and fun.

395
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:49,946
So let's start by looking at
construction costs of our new factory.

396
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,401
What's the product?

397
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,613
That is immaterial for the purposes
of our discussion

398
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:59,576
but if it makes you happy,
let's say we're making tape recorders.

399
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,706
Tape recorders, are you kidding?

400
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,119
The Japs will kill us
on the labor costs.

401
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,083
OK, tine.

402
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,920
Then let's just say they're widgets.

403
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,677
- What's a widget?
- It's a tictional product.

404
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,337
It doesn't matter.

405
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:20,430
- Tell that to the bank.
- Take it easy. it's the first day.

406
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,596
On the board, you see a cost analysis
for construction

407
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,639
of a 30,000-square-foot facility

408
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,355
which will encompass factory
and office space

409
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:32,647
and is serviced by all utilities,
a railroad spur line

410
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,440
and a four-bay shipping dock.

411
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,324
Hold on. Why build?

412
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,454
Better to lease at a buck and a half
a square foot.

413
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,865
Take a down payment and put it into CDs

414
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,125
or something you can roll over.

415
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,831
Thank you, Mr. Melon.

416
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:52,129
We'll be concentrating on finance
a little later in the term.

417
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:56,797
For the time being, let's just
concentrate on the construction figures.

418
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,890
The bottom line requires
the factoring in of

419
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,346
not just the material
and construction costs

420
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:07,265
but also the architect's fees
and the cost of land servicing.

421
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,025
Oh, you left out a bunch of stuff.

422
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,858
Oh, really?
Like what, for instance?

423
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,241
First of all, you've got to grease
the local politicians

424
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,401
for the sudden zoning problems
that always come up.

425
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,787
Then there's kickbacks
to the carpenters.

426
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:26,246
If you plan on using cement,
the Teamsters will want a chat,

427
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,660
and that will cost you.

428
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,420
And don't forget something
for the building inspectors.

429
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,549
Then there's the long-term costs,
such as waste disposal.

430
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,712
Are you familiar with who runs
that business? It's not the boy scouts.

431
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,596
That's enough, Mr. Melon.

432
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:44,682
Maybe bribes, kickbacks and mafia
pay-offs are how you do business,

433
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,892
but they are not part
of the legitimate business world

434
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,433
and certainly are not pan
of anything I am teaching in this class.

435
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,226
Do I make myself clear?

436
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,770
Sorry, just trying to help.

437
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:59,567
Now, notwithstanding Mr. Melon's input,

438
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:04,284
the next question for us
is where to build our factory.

439
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,496
- [Melon] How about Fantasyland?
- [students laugh]

440
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,500
- My first class. I did good, huh?
- You'd better cool it with Dr. Barbay.

441
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:19,295
Dr. Barbay don't know dick.
He tells it like it ain't.

442
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,805
You know what he can do? Flunk you.

443
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,057
Flunk me? Flunk him.

444
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,969
Great attitude.
Do you know where your next class is?

445
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,014
Contemporary American History.
Professor Terguson.

446
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,979
- Terguson?
- You know him? Is he good?

447
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,111
Well, he's committed.
In fact, I think he was.

448
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:40,490
Just keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

449
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,153
Welcome... to Contemporary
American History.

450
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,242
I'm Professor Terguson.

451
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,783
A lot of people think history
is just facts,

452
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,122
it's just information about the past.

453
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,786
But not me.

454
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:56,173
I hold history very sacred. Sacred.

455
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,800
The way the farmer
holds the earth sacred.

456
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,008
The way a Christian
holds the Bible sacred.

457
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,844
The way people
hold their marriage sacred.

458
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,098
That's how I feel about it.

459
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:10,138
So let's dive right in by interpreting
one of the easiest events

460
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,273
in the last 20 years
of American history.

461
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:18,029
Can someone tell me why, in 1975,

462
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,359
we pulled our troops out of Vietnam?

463
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,905
The failure of Vietnamization
to win popular support

464
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,821
caused an ongoing erosion of confidence
in the various American

465
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,036
but illegal Saigon regimes.

466
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,620
Is she right?

467
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,630
That's the popular version
of what went on.

468
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,763
A lot of people believe that.
I wish I could, but I was there.

469
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,391
I wasn't in a classroom,
hoping I was right, thinking about it,

470
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,394
I was up to my knees in rice paddies,
with guns,

471
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,227
going up against Charlie,
slugging it out with him

472
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,064
while pussies like you
were back here partying,

473
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:02,026
putting headbands on, doing drugs,
listening to Beatle albums.

474
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,738
[screams]

475
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,823
Professor, take it easy, will you?

476
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,073
These kids, they were in grade school
at the time, and me...

477
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,992
I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover.

478
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,247
[laughs]

479
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,040
Well, I didn't know you wanted to

480
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,926
get involved with
the discussion, Mr. Helper.

481
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,469
Since you want to help,
maybe you can help me.

482
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,931
Remember that thing we had 30 years ago
called the Korean Conflict?

483
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,104
Yeah? Where we failed
to achieve victory?

484
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,435
How come we didn't cross
the 38th parallel

485
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,568
and push those rice-eaters
back to the Great Wall of China

486
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:44,232
and take it apart brick by brick
and nuke them back into the Stone Age?

487
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,901
How come? Why? Say it! Say it!

488
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,116
All right. I'll say it.

489
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,452
'Cause Truman was too much of a wimp
to let MacArthur go in there

490
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,709
and blow out those commie bastards!

491
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,840
Good answer. Good answer.

492
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,796
I like the way you think.

493
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,137
I'm gonna be watching you.

494
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,677
He's a good teacher.
He really seems to care.

495
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,595
About what, I have no idea.

496
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,978
He was all right.

497
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,359
Buddy, be my guest. Here's a pen.

498
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,943
Boys, here's some pens
in case you learn how to write.

499
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,358
- I know you.
- Yeah? Here's a pen.

500
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,652
You do those obnoxious commercials.

501
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,990
You're Tall & Fat!

502
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,201
You're short and ugly.
Give me the pen back.

503
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,246
Honey, here's a pen.

504
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,911
Boys, how are you?

505
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,779
"And Gibraltar is a girl
for I was a flower of the mountain

506
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,942
Yes when I put the rose in my hair
like the Andalusian girls used

507
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,406
Shall I wear red yes

508
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,368
And he kissed me under
the Moorish wall and I thought

509
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,373
Well as well him as another

510
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,581
And then I ask him with my eyes
to ask again yes

511
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,965
And then he asked me would I yes
to say yes my mountain flower

512
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,546
And first I put my arms around his

513
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,680
And drew him down to me so he could feel
my breasts all perfumed yes

514
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,389
And his heart was going like mad
and yes I said, yes I will, yes."

515
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,144
Yes! Yes!

516
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,601
[roars of laughter]

517
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,485
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I think Joyce is pretty hot too.

518
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:52,242
Now I have your attention,
I'll run down the reading list.

519
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,118
See what else turns you on.

520
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,868
What a woman!

521
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,709
Dad, she is the teacher.

522
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,250
I like teachers. Do something wrong,
they make you do it over again.

523
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,383
[Jason] Shouldn't you
take some notes?

524
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,218
Yeah, yeah.

525
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,268
[laughs] I gave away all my pens.

526
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,267
I'm sorry, I need this back.

527
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,227
Here's a calendar for you.

528
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,946
- Hi.
- Hello, Mr. Melon.

529
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,278
- Are you waiting for me?
- Yes.

530
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,695
I'm only a freshman,
but why don't we have dinner tonight?

531
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,410
We can talk about Joyce.
She's my favorite writer.

532
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,245
[laughs]

533
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,207
You're not the usual freshman,
but I can't.

534
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,916
I'm sort of going with someone.

535
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,007
- Where are you going?
- That's a good question.

536
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,470
I'd like to join you,
but I have class tonight.

537
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,430
How about tomorrow?

538
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,760
I have class then too.

539
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:01,603
Why don't you call me sometime
when you have no class?

540
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,599
All right. Maybe I will.

541
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,155
Hello, Philip.

542
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,150
What did he want?

543
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,489
Oh, what do all men want?

544
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,488
You to dress up as Wonder Woman,

545
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,704
tie him up and force him
to tell the truth?

546
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,290
No, just dinner, Philip.

547
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,081
Are you jealous of Thornton Melon?

548
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,669
Certainly not.

549
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,173
I've been doing
a great deal of thinking.

550
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,635
I've been thinking... about us.

551
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,175
- And?
-And I think...

552
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,641
...we should start thinking about
forming a...

553
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,430
...well, a...

554
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,942
- A merger?
- A merger, exactly. A merger.

555
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,568
A partnership.

556
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,231
Seriously, Diane.
We're both educated, intelligent adults.

557
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,614
We should be together.

558
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,573
Incorporated, if you will.

559
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:03,707
Look at the balance sheet.
We were made for one another.

560
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,458
Philip, darling.

561
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,369
I don't want to be merged
or incorporated.

562
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:12,086
I want to have fun
and be romanced and loved.

563
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:17,759
So let's not rush into anything.
Let's just start by having fun, OK?

564
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,894
Hey, how are ya? What's happening?

565
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,225
A lot of people are talking
about your dad.

566
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,856
[Melon] What's happening?

567
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,227
Hey, boys! How are you doing?

568
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,236
I wonder why.

569
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:40,069
Um... they have lockers.
You could have changed here.

570
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:44,081
I don't change in front of guys.
Next, you're showering with them.

571
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,288
And next, you're pinned to
a sophomore named Chip.

572
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,329
- Come on, let's go.
- I'll see you later.

573
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,745
[Melon] That was pretty good.

574
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,701
Next time, hold the pike
a little longer.

575
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,994
Wait a minute. I'll be right down.

576
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,719
[cheering and whistling]

577
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,310
Not bad.

578
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,947
All right. Let's see one more.

579
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,567
- Like I showed you.
- All right, got it.

580
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,785
What's a guy your age
doing with these kids?

581
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,205
I'm looking for
the fountain of middle age.

582
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,497
What's your story?

583
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:21,170
I'm setting a new record for the most
consecutive losses by a diving coach.

584
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,346
Remember, hold that pike longer.

585
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,099
- He your kid?
- Yeah.

586
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,478
- Who coached him in high school?
- Yours truly.

587
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,139
Where did you learn diving?

588
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,559
Atlantic City. Steel Pier.
I was in a water show.

589
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,605
- I used to open for the Diving Horse.
- You're kidding. I'm from Jersey.

590
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,524
I spent my life on that pier growing up.

591
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,786
There was a guy did the most amazing
dive, called the Triple Lindy.

592
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,698
Hardest dive I ever saw. Who was that?

593
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,829
- Yours truly.
- You're kidding.

594
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,542
I don't joke about dives.
Especially that. It almost killed me.

595
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,544
Boy, you were something else.

596
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,553
- Can your kid do that dive?
- Nobody can. It's too dangerous.

597
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:09,222
He tried out for the team last semester.
He wasn't that good.

598
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,228
Not that good, huh? Watch this.

599
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,056
Jason, do the two and a half.

600
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,406
- [whooping, applause]
- Not bad.

601
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:37,086
My man Melon. Come on, there's
a pep rally for the football team.

602
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,872
What is this?

603
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,712
Me, Standish and Redding,
we're doing an anti-pep rally.

604
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,754
Violent ground acquisition games
such as football is, in fact,

605
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,593
a crypto-fascist metaphor
for nuclear war.

606
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:52,602
It sounds like a lot of laughs but
I'm supposed to meet my dad and study.

607
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,732
Well, if you change your mind, pal,
you know where to find me.

608
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,769
If I change my mind,
I'll seek psychiatric help.

609
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:24,043
Excuse me. What is the Oort system,
and what does it tell us?

610
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,092
Uh... What? I'm sorry.

611
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,890
Astronomy, chapter two.

612
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,602
Oh, Oort. Oort.

613
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,388
Oort was this scientist

614
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,604
and he figured out that
the smeared-out density of matter

615
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,772
can be no greater
than the solar mass per cubic parsec...

616
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,065
You look thrilled. It's not my theory.

617
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,077
Thanks. That helps a lot.

618
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,618
Listen, I was just wondering.

619
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,830
Would you do my Astronomy homework
for the rest of the semester?

620
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,421
There you go.

621
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,173
Hi, Mr. Melon.

622
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,585
Call me Thornton.

623
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,595
How about joining me
and my friend over there?

624
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,722
Your friend looks a little strange.

625
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,849
Who, Lou? Lou's an animal.

626
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,103
In his family, he's only the second
generation to stand up straight.

627

[girls giggle]

628
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,185
What lovely girls. How would you like
a life of luxury and deceit?

629
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,942
- Come on, join us in a beer, OK?
- OK.

630
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,527
OK.

631
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,998

Lou, these are girls.

gonna be astrophysics.

00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,211

670
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,262
OK, buddy.

671
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,059
Jason, what are you doing here?

672
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,476
Whoa, what am I doing?
What are you doing?

673
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:13,567
- We were supposed to study.
- The library. I know.

674
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,982
[all] Hey.

675
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,367
Chas, check it out.

676
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,200
Hey, Clarke. Interesting little rally
you guys had tonight.

677
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:28,336
Yeah, right.
They got paint on my girlfriend.

678
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,963
- I'm gonna kill them pinheads.
- Yeah?

679
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:35,127
Well, you came to the right place.
Guess who's here? Derek Lutz.

680
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,678
Hey, Lutz!

681
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,432
- You know who I am?
- Um...

682
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,269
Let's see.
Protruding supra-orbital ridges,

683
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:52,276
small cranium, uh, 1300cc brain...

684
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,563
Hmm. Neanderthal man.

685
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:58,905
You. Call his mother.
Tell her he's never coming home.

686
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:03,287
You sure you got the right guy?
Lots of people got blue hair now.

687
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,370
- Shut up, meathead.
- [Melon] Take it easy.

688
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,036
War's over.
You can get new parts for your head.

689
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,876
Yeah? Wanna make something of it?

690
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:16,509
No, I never get physical.
I just get upset.

691
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,171
And when I get upset, he gets physical.

692
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,929
[metal groans]

693
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,097
You got a problem?

694
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:33,609
- No, I haven't got a problem.
- Now you do.

695
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,024
[shouting and whistles]

696
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,450
Kill him!

697
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,615
[punching and slapping]

698
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,386
Lou, where you been? I'm getting
my ass kicked all over the place.

699
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:29,161
- Well, you look terrible.
- I'm all right.

700
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,668
It's Lou I'm worried about.
He may lose his trigger finger.

701
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:36,081
Why did you
take on the whole football team?

702
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,842
They're not that tough.
The team at my high school were tough.

703
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,345
After they sacked the quarterback,
they went after his family.

704
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:50,012
This morning, we're looking at
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

705
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:54,182
Mr. Melon, how would you
characterize the Great Gatsby?

706
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,851
- Who, him?
- No, you.

707
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:01,022
Me? Well, the Great Gatsby,
he was uh...

708
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,782
- Great.
- [laughter]

709
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,201
See me after class, Mr. Melon.

710
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,045
Please, try to understand.
I don't have the background.

711
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,797
My high school,
to prove the law of gravity,

712
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,754
a kid threw the teacher out the window.

713
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,050
I know what I need. I need a tutor.

714
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,976
Hey, what do you say?
Come on, you got some spare time.

715
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,847
All right, Mr. Melon,
I have some spare time this evening.

716
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,812
Come round about seven.

717
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,601
- Great.
- I'll give you my address.

718
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,109
- Thanks.
- Please be on time.

719
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,694
I'll be on time.

720
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,407
What penmanship.

721
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:54,413
[Melon] "Everywhere the ceremony
of innocence is drowned.

722
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:59,422
The best lack all conviction while the
worst are full of passionate intensity."

723
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,082
There's a lot of other stuff here.

724
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,422
Yeats goes on and on
and here's the finish.

725
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,598
"What rough beast,
its hour come round at last

726
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,430
slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?"

727
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:16,143
- What did that make you think of?
- Rough beast. My ex-wife.

728
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,559
It's one interpretation.
Not the right one, but a start.

729
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,855
Surely a man of your age must have read
some of the things on my list.

730
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,022
Macbeth?

731
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:29,569
I saw the movie. Orson Welles.
Great actor. Big actor.

732
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,954
He was a Tall & Fat customer.

733
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,240
- Cat On A Hot Tin Roof?
- I saw the movie.

734
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:38,786
Burl Ives. Great actor. Extra stout.
Another customer.

735
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,456
- A Streetcar Named Desire.
- Great movie. Marlon Brando.

736
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,126
He wasn't that big then,
but he ballooned up nicely.

737
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,045
I'd say pound for pound
our finest American actor.

738
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,466
- Don't you ever read?
- Read? Who has time?

739
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,805
I see the movie. In two hours.

740
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:58,724
The reason you read these works is so
you can experience them for yourself.

741
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,563
So you can share
the thoughts of the writer

742
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,980
without the interference of your actor,
director and professor's point of view.

743
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,785
You truly share and understand
the common feelings of all mankind.

744
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,112
The feelings of being alive.

745
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:18,660
That was beautiful.
I understand what you're saying, too.

746
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,545
I'm glad. It makes me feel good.

747
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,799
I've got an idea.
Let's keep talking over dinner.

748
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,298
I'm supposed to meet someone for dinner.

749
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:33,178
I could cancel, though.
We are working after all.

750
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,058
You can't work on an empty stomach.

751
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,016
You can't concentrate if you're hungry.

752
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,728
I really shouldn't.
I have so many things to do.

753
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,064
I'll help you. I'll take out
the garbage, do the dishes.

754
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,697
I'll do your nails, your hair.
You've no idea what I wanna do.

755
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,858
- I'll Call him.
- I'll dial it.

756
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:56,456
- Let me get the light.
- I think I'm attracted to teachers.

757
00:51:56,614 --> 00:52:00,369
I took out an English teacher,
but I sent her a love letter

758
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,502
- and she corrected it.
- [Diane laughs]

759
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,040
Oh, great. Company.

760
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,379
[dogs whimpering]

761
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,552
- Those two ought to get a room.
- Really.

762
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,341
Actually, I was married twice.

763
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,852
My first wife, Jason's mother,
I really loved.

764
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,139
We had a good thing going.

765
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,603
She passed away about ten years ago.

766
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,064
After that, I screwed around
for a few years.

767
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,399
Then I went nuts.
I married Vanessa.

768
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,398
I was lonely, I guess.

769
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,444
- Is that over?
- We were doomed from the start.

770
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,864
I'm an earth sign, she's a water sign.
Together we made mud.

771
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,242
I picked a beauty.
She played around, too.

772
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,082
When she said, “l do“,
I should have said, "With who?"

773
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,754
- So are you giving up on women?
- I can't figure women out.

774
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,886
Today, they're independent,
only think about themselves.

775
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:55,344
During sex, Vanessa
screamed out her own name.

776
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,846
I think men are different.

777
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:03,515
The women's movement made men want
to show you how sensitive they are.

778
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,606
Before, they were too macho.
Now they're too soft.

779
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:10,396
You all want us to know you can cry.

780
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,111
With women, I never cry, never.

781
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,117
- I beg.
- [laughs]

782
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,450
If we finish this bottle of wine,
you won't have to beg.

783
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,843
Diane!

784
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,138
- Oh! Oh, Philip.
- We were supposed to go to dinner.

785
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,979
I just had dinner.

786
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,769
I don't believe this.

787
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,314
Maybe it's a dream.
Good night, Philip.

788
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,740
Do a good job.
What do you charge for big cars?

789
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,003
I had a lot of fun, Thornton.

790
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,052
Me too.

791
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,009
And thanks for the lesson.
I learned a lot.

792
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,674
You're welcome.

793
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,841
I did, too.

794
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:23,928
Well, uh...

795
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,812
Well, I guess this is good night.

796
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,066
Yeah.

797
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,028
A very good night.

798
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,618
[Thornton] Beautiful.
Oh.

799
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,668
That's it, that's the spot.
Just keep doing that.

800
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,705
Oh, don't lose it. Oh, oh!

801
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:56,219
Oh, Lou, you're great. The leg
is better. You got the cramp out.

802
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,549
You're a wreck.
You got to start working out.

803
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:03,931
[Jason] And you know what else.
You have got mid-terms coming up.

804
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,595
You haven't studied since you got here.

805
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:10,357
You're always so neat.
You're just like your uncle Vito.

806
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,610
As kids, his room was always in order,

807
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:15,897
towels lined up,
hair lotions in the right place.

808
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,408
What is he today?
An attendant in a men's room.

809
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,910
Hey! He's my idol.

810
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:26,324
But... I'm not going to be
folding towels any more.

811
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,286
'Cause I just made - ta-da!
-the diving team.

812
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,581
The di... That's great! Hey! Gee...

813
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,920
I'm taking you out.
We're having a party.

814
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,552
No, Dad. That's really nice,
but I'm in training.

815
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,133
We got a meet coming up
against Northern.

816
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,469
We'll have a party after the meet.

817
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,682
Dad, why don't you join me
on a little reality break?

818
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:52,442
Being in love with Dr. Turner does not
mean you're gonna pass her course.

819
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:56,729
You've got a major paper on Kurt
Vonnegut and you haven't read the books.

820
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,613
- I tried.
- [knock at door]

821
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,908
I don't understand a word of it.

822
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,162
So how are you gonna
write the paper then?

823
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:13,125
Hi. I'm Kurt Vonnegut.
I'm looking for Thornton Melon.

824
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,050
Uh... you wanna come in? Dad?

825
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:22,130
[woman on TV] D-O-G. Dog.

826
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:26,142
[man] One more word out
of you and it's back to the tree.

827
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,519
- [knock at door]
- Come in.

828
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:32,978
Excuse me. Dr. Barazini?
I'm Thornton Melon.

829
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,610
Oh, yes. Thornton Melon. I know you.

- Uh, I think he's in there.
- Great.

1000
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,224
[giggling]

1001
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,735
Excuse me, has anyone seen
Thornton Melon?

1002
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:12,816
Now that's what I call marine biology!

1003
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:14,985
Diane.

1004
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,613
Say hello to my nieces.

1005
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,036
Wait a minute!

1006
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:26,834
Jason?

1007
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:30,045
I was looking all over for you.

1008
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,801
Jason, are you OK?

1009
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,087
I'm sorry about the swim meet.

1010
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,005
Shit.

1011
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,765
The swim meet.

1012
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:40,097
Think I care about the swim meet?

1013
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,388
It's just a stupid college game.
it's just bullshit.

1014
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,898
Why are you acting like this?

1015
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,776
- I know you don't think like that.
- You do?

1016
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:54,988
Grow up, Valerie.
You think this is real?

1017
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,823
College is a dream world,
something to pass the time

1018
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,488
until you can start buying people.

1019
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,783
Let's go for a walk and talk this out.

1020
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,496
There you are.

1021
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,457
Can we go? I'm bored.

1022
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,749
Christ, will you get
your ass outta here?

1023
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,792
Oh, another shit-faced Melon.

1024
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,007
Shall I knock your teeth
down your throat?

1025
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,093
Easy, Melon. Your father isn't here
to back you up this time.

1026
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,434
Don't!

1027
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,061
[furious shouting]

1028
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,227
Are you OK?

1029
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,855
[Thornton] Jason,
I was looking for ya.

1030
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,904
Hey, come here! Where are you going?

1031
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,531
Where am I going?

1032
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:41,075
I'm leaving school. One of us has to go
and you're having a great time.

1033
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,205
Why? I don't get it.

1034
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,493
- Because you didn't win the meet?
- Not because I didn't win.

1035
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:51,005
Because Chas told me you bribed
the coach to put me on the team.

1036
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,041
What, and you believed him?

1037
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,086
I've never lied to you.
I didn't bribe the coach.

1038
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,971
You're on the team
because you deserve it.

1039
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:03,476
Dad, you don't get it.
Everything I have is because of you.

1040
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,604
Because of you, I get my
Astronomy homework done by NASA.

1041
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:11,351
I just want the best for you.
That's all I ever wanted.

1042
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,567
I did it all for you.

1043
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,693
I know, but you don't know when to quit.

1044
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,954
I know you came to help
and I appreciate it.

1045
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,831
It's really sweet
and it's really not working.

1046
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:29,711
- Let me do something for myself!
- I just want to see you happy.

1047
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,337
Well, take a good look.

1048
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,132
'Cause I was a lot happier
when I was miserable.

1049
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,894
- [Diane] I enjoyed reading that, Susan.
- [Susan] Thanks.

1050
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,435
Diane, why did you fail me?

1051
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,024
I didn't, Thornton, you failed me.

1052
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:58,531
- Was it because of last night?
- No.

1053
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,613
I accept the fact that you're
completely regressed emotionally.

1054
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:04,495
But you won't pass my course
by turning in someone else's work.

1055
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,708
- You think someone else wrote this?
- I know you didn't.

1056
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,368
That's what disappoints me.

1057
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:14,381
And whoever did write it
has no idea about Kurt Vonnegut.

1058
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:18,089
And another thing, Vonnegut,
I'm gonna stop payment on the check.

1059
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,800
What's that? Fuck me?

1060
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:24,307
Hey, Kurt, do you read lips? Fuck you!

1061
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:28,095
- Next time I'll call Robert Ludlum.
- [howling]

1062
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,982
Derek, have you seen Jason?

1063
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,609
I think he's on
a three-state killing spree.

1064
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:39,773
Here's some more potentially bad news.
Dean Martin wants you in his office.

1065
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:43,113
Dean Martin? [laughs]

1066
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:48,286
And she said, "Let's do it,
the room's already paid for!"

1067
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,290
[both laugh]

1068
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,583
Oh, golly.

1069
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:59,626
I'm afraid we have a potentially
unpleasant situation here.

1070
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:05,344
Phil, would you repeat to Mr. Melon
the allegations that you've made to me?

1071
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,594
The work you handed in is not your own.

1072
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,138
I'm accusing you of academic fraud.

1073
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,184
Fraud is such an ugly word.

1074
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:19,149
Considering the financial generosity
Mr. Melon has shown

1075
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,064
towards our fine university.

1076
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,904
I think Mr. Melon should be expelled.

1077
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,658
What are you going to do about it?

1078
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:35,663
Well... Thornton, I'm only going to
ask you this one time,

1079
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,581
is the work that you turned in your own?

1080
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,008
I can't lie to you, Dean Martin.

1081
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,012
Yes, it is.

1082
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,511
I'm satisfied.

1083
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,805
- Phil?
- I'm outraged.

1084
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:58,977
Gee whizz, Phil, I just asked Melon
if the work was his and he said yes.

1085
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,771
Now, what do you want me to do,
torture him?

1086
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,534
I suggest a comprehensive
oral examination

1087
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,286
conducted by all
of Mr. Melon's professors.

1088
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,743
- Oral examination?
- Yes.

1089
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:14,204
If you've done the work
you say you have,

1090
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,995
there should be no problem.
Should there?

1091
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,877
Hey.

1092
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,135
- Jase.
- Hey, Lou, how are you doing?

1093
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,046
Come here, I want to tell you something.

1094
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,261
You were pretty hard
on your father last night.

1095
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,892
I know, but he doesn't understand.

1096
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,600
I've known your pop 30 years.
He understands.

1097
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:38,938
He's a nice guy.
And he's tough, like me.

1098
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,194
I'm nice, and I'm tough.

1099
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,696
Huh? I'll give you an idea what I mean.

1100
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:48,360
My two boys, I put one through college
and the other I put through a wall.

1101
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,829
Your papa loves you, eh?

1102
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,040
He's looking out for you.

1103
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,826
Look out for him.

1104
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,799
OK.

1105
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:19,769
Hey.

1106
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,861
What's going on?

1107
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:28,400
I'm leaving. I'm sorry, Jason.
This college thing was a big mistake.

1108
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,613
- So you're gonna give up?
- I can't win.

1109
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,122
They want me to take orals
in all subjects.

1110
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,454
If I don't, they'll kick me out.

1111
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,210
And if I take them,
who knows where they'll kick me?

1112
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:47,715
Remember what you told me
when I told you I wanted to quit?

1113
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,847
You said a man
without an education is nothing.

1114
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,428
- I can't do it, Jason.
- You can do anything.

1115
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:58,813
You can do anything you want in life.
Remember, you're a Melon.

1116
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,602
Don't quit. I'll help you.

1117
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:57,034
[man mumbles in French on tape]

1118
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,370
[whispers soothingly
but indistinctly]

1119
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,237
[Dean Martin] Before we begin,

1120
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,904
I would like to thank
each and every professor here

1121
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:42,746
for taking time out of his/her
extremely busy schedules.

1122
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:46,082
And a special thanks of course
to Mr. Thornton Melon

1123
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,963
who I do not have to remind anyone

1124
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:52,298
is the donor of our new
Melon School of Business.

1125
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,436
We're wasting time.

1126
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,430
Sorry, Phil.

1127
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:10,562
Mr. Melon, you'll have three hours
to complete the examination.

1128
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:15,234
If you fail any part of it,
you will be expelled.

1129
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,285
Mr. Melon, do you understand?

1130
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:22,115
- The Council of Trent!
- Excuse me?

1131
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,455
- I missed a question.
- We haven't begun yet.

1132
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:26,790
Oh.

1133
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:30,624
Well, Dr. Barbay,
I suppose you're up first.

1134
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,147
I have only one question

1135
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,024
for Mr. Melon.

1136
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,695
In 27 parts.

1137
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:03,910
- I'd like to break him in 27 parts.
- Excuse me?

1138
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,996
Oh, nothing, nothing.

1139
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:12,006
Discuss the foundations
of modern global business systems.

1140
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,838
Part one. Define and differentiate

1141
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,005
the three economic philosophies
of capitalism, socialism and communism

1142
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,516
as pertains to a) management
fundamentals,

1143
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,643
b) organizing and staffing,

1144
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,679
c) labor management,

1145
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:29,564
and d) production and operations.

1146
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,396
Par! two.

1147
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:38,028
- Are you getting all this, Mr. Melon?
- Yeah, it's a piece of cake.

1148
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,282
[Valerie] Jason?

1149
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:50,286
Valerie.

1150
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:55,208
I wanted to apologize
for the other night

1151
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:58,423
for my behavior, the things I said.

1152
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:04,392
And to thank you for your behavior
and the things you said.

1153
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,221
Really sorry.

1154
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:13,059
And I'm in love with you
and have been for ages

1155
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,648
and I can't believe I'm saying this.

1156
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,236
And I don't wanna... embarrass you

1157
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:22,277
or make you feel uncomfortable with me

1158
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:25,037
but, uh...

1159
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:30,747
I've been needing to tell you this
for a very long time.

1160
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,503
Um...

1161
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:38,338
Are you aware that that's the most
you've ever said to me at one time?

1162
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,720
Oh, except for the time
when you were ravingly drunk.

1163
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,724
I love you too.

1164
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,704
In response to Roman numeral 27,

1165

1167
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,462
the answer is...

1168
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:22,795
Mr. Melon?

1169
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:33,814
- [clears throat] Mr. Melon?
- Hey, hey, relax.

1170
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,725
This man's under a lot of pressure.
Let's take it easy.

Say in say in

1172
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:44,234

Right.

1177
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,313
To an accountant.

1178
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,150
Wait a minute, Thornton.

1179
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:35,577
Thornton, do you remember when we
discussed the Dylan Thomas poem,

1180
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,040
Do not Go Gentle
into that Good Night?

1181
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,753
I don't know. No.

1182
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:45,044
- Maybe.
- Thornton, think.

1183
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,382
What's going on here?

1184
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:51,217
Philip, relax. it's my turn.

1185
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,018
Do you remember it?

1186
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:03,066
"Do not go gentle into...

1187
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,901
into that good night,

1188
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:09,617
Old age should burn and rage

1189
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:13,406
at... at close of day;

1190
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:16,917
Rage... rage against
the dying of the light.

1191
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,420
Wild men who court
and sang the sun in flight,

1192
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:25,085
And learned, too late,
they grieved it on its way,

1193
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,378
Do not go gentle to that good night."

1194
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:33,801
"Grave men, near death,
who see with blinding sight,

1195
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:37,267
Blind eyes could blaze
like meteors and be gay,

1196
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:41,400
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1197
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,606
And you, my father,

1198
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:46,363
there on the sad height,

1199
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:51,278
Curse, bless me now
with your fierce tears I pray.

1200
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,787
Do not go gentle into that good night

1201
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:57,951
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light."

1202
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,786
Thornton, what does that poem
mean to you?

1203
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:05,295
It means...
I don't take shit from no one.

1204
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:11,926
I'm gonna pass this test.
I'm staying in school. Who's next?

I wouldn't break my arm
patting myself on the back.

No matter what you think,

I have only one thing to say to you.

1291
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:49,255
It's a jungle out there.
You gotta look out for number one.

1292
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:51,594
But don't step in number two.

1293
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:58,438
And so, to all you graduates,
as you go out into the world,

1294
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,598
my advice to you is

1295
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,438
don't go!

01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,353

Move back with your parents.
