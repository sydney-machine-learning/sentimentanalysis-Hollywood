1
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:59,675
Your Holiness, the little matter
that brought me here is now settled.

2
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:06,645
The Indians are once more free to be enslaved
by the Spanish and Portuguese settlers.

3
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:12,885
I don't think that's hitting
the right note. Begin again.

4
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:17,515
Your Holiness, I write to you
in this year of our Lord 1758...

5
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:23,565
...from the southern continent of the
Americas, from the town of Asunción...

6
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:27,965
...two weeks' march from
the great mission of San Miguel.

7
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:33,765
<i>These missions have protected the Indians
from the depredations of the settlers...</i>

8
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:37,145
<i>...and have earned much resentment
because of it.</i>

9
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:40,915
<i>The noble souls of these Indians
incline towards music.</i>

10
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:44,715
<i>Indeed, many a violin played
in the academies of Rome...</i>

11
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:48,725
<i>...have been made
by their nimble and gifted hands.</i>

12
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:57,335
<i>It was from these missions the Jesuit
fathers carried the word of God...</i>

13
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:00,905
<i>...to those Indians still
existing in their natural state...</i>

14
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:05,635
<i>...and received in return, martyrdom.</i>

15
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:42,095
<i>The death of this priest
was to form the first link...</i>

16
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,635
<i>...in the chain of which
I now find myself a part.</i>

17
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:49,765
Continue.
As Your Holiness undoubtedly knows...

18
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:54,275
...little in this world
unfolds as we predict.

19
00:04:55,745 --> 00:05:00,745
How could the Indians have supposed
that the death of that unsung priest...

20
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:07,385
<i>...would bring among them a man whose life
was to become intertwined with their own?</i>

21
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,495
Thank you, Father.

22
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:29,805
It was our territory.
Julien's and mine.

23
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:35,745
I sent him, Father.
I have to go up there myself.

24
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:58,885
Can you see him?

25
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:02,055
No.

26
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:29,145
<i>With an orchestra, the Jesuits could
have subdued the whole continent.</i>

27
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:33,255
<i>So it was that the Guarani
were brought finally to account...</i>

28
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:36,625
<i>...to the everlasting mercy of God...</i>

29
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,725
<i>...and to the short-lived
mercy of man.</i>

30
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:52,895
Who are you?

31
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:03,775
So you're hunting above the falls now,
Captain Mendoza?

32
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,585
We're building a mission here.

33
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:20,995
- We'll make Christians of these people.
- Lf you have the time.

34
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:36,935
It's your brother.

35
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:02,195
- Alonzo, are they healthy?
- Excellent.

36
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,095
Good.

37
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,665
- Are there many above the falls?
- Yes.

38
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:11,035
- Dangerous?
- Yes.

39
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:14,545
- Not against powder and shot.
- No.

40
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,205
I've seen Jesuits there.

41
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,145
- Above the falls?
- Yes.

42
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:22,575
Damn them.

43
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:26,285
The mission is
to be called San Carlos.

44
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:37,665
- Don Cabeza.
- Mendoza.

45
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:46,065
Take them away.
Quickly. Quickly now.

46
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:07,695
- You should find yourself a good woman.
- I have.

47
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,265
If you had,
you wouldn't look so gloomy.

48
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:13,365
- Maybe you're right.
- About women, I'm always right.

49
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,375
- How could I forget?
- You forget everything.

50
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:19,065
- I do, do I?
- You do.

51
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:35,455
Good.

52
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:03,375
Hello.

53
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:07,015
- Good. Now take them off.
- Excellent.

54
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:09,825
You distract too easily.

55
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:13,625
On the day the señorita
can't distract my attention...

56
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,455
...I'll become a monk.
- On that day, Felipe...

57
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:19,695
...half the ladies in this town
will become nuns.

58
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:23,505
Pure gossip.
Rodrigo is the lady's man.

59
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:26,945
Rodrigo here is this lady's man.

60
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:52,565
Felipe?

61
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:57,735
I love him, Rodrigo.

62
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:02,345
Since when have you loved Felipe?

63
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:05,445
Six months.

64
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:09,015
- Six...?
- I've been trying to tell you.

65
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,415
I have.

66
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:19,025
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
You have been trying to tell me.

67
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:30,005
So me you do not love?

68
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:34,475
Not as I love Felipe.

69
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:38,635
- Rodrigo, that's the love that I need.
- I see.

70
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:42,905
And so I have no need?

71
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:47,355
You need so much.

72
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:51,455
You deserve so much.

73
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:03,935
Rodrigo, you won't hurt him, will you?

74
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:15,475
No, I won't hurt him.

75
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,675
Rodrigo, please.

76
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:20,225
- You laughed.
- I did not laugh.

77
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,455
Most certainly you laughed.

78
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:25,465
- At whom are you laughing?
- Don't do this.

79
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:28,505
Quarrel with me!

80
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:01,735
Oh, no!

81
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:06,125
So how goes it at your mission
above the falls?

82
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:10,665
- Insects and twigs, Father.
- No converts?

83
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:12,365
A few.

84
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:18,075
- And many near to it, thank the Lord.
- Thank the Lord, indeed.

85
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:22,445
- Do you know Rodrigo Mendoza?
- Yes, I know him.

86
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:24,985
Come with me.

87
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:29,985
I have a task, and you are
the only one who can do it.

88
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:33,755
He's been here for six months,
but he won't see anybody.

89
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:37,025
I think he wants to die.

90
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,675
So...

91
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:21,765
...you killed your brother.

92
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:28,145
And it was a duel.
And the law can't touch you.

93
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:33,615
Is this remorse?

94
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,455
Leave...

95
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:39,755
...priest.

96
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:46,065
Maybe you wish I was your executioner.
Perhaps that would be easier.

97
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:48,865
Leave me alone.

98
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:53,805
- You know what I am.
- Yes.

99
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:59,875
You're a mercenary,
you're a slave trader...

100
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:03,915
...and you killed your brother.
I know.

101
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:06,855
And you loved him.

102
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:13,385
Although you chose
a strange way to show it.

103
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:27,045
Are you laughing at me?
Are you laughing at me?

104
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:29,835
I'm laughing at you...

105
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:33,005
...because all I see is laughable.

106
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:38,675
I see a man running away, a man
hiding from the world. I see a coward.

107
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:42,055
Go on.

108
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,325
Go on.

109
00:30:54,675 --> 00:31:00,475
So is that it?
Is this how you mean to go on?

110
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:06,385
- There is nothing else.
- There is life.

111
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:10,355
- There is no life.
- There is a way out, Mendoza.

112
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:13,885
For me, there is no redemption.

113
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:17,925
God gave us the burden of freedom.
You chose your crime.

114
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:22,795
Do you have the courage to choose
your penance? Do you dare do that?

115
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:26,665
There is no penance
hard enough for me.

116
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:34,975
- But do you dare try it?
- Do I dare?

117
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:38,235
Do you dare to see it fail?

118
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:12,935
- Father?
- Aye?

119
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:16,375
How long must he carry
that stupid thing?

120
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:19,105
God knows, Father John.

121
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:42,515
- Ralph, here.
- Thank you.

122
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:51,155
Father?

123
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:58,065
He's done this penance long enough, and,
well, the other brothers think the same.

124
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:01,405
But he doesn't think so, John.

125
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:05,175
Until he does, neither do I.

126
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:12,585
We're not the members of a democracy,
Father. We're members of an order.

127
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:40,185
No.

128
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:42,055
No.

129
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,085
Thank you.

130
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:56,585
Thank you, Lord, for our food
and all your other blessings. Amen.

131
00:47:02,735 --> 00:47:05,005
Oh, good Lord.

132
00:47:07,145 --> 00:47:10,205
- Did you cook this?
- Yes.

133
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:13,475
Did you put in all the chilies?

134
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:18,515
Lm afraid I did.

135
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:23,985
Lm sorry. I was trained
as a mercenary, not as a cook.

136
00:47:24,165 --> 00:47:26,095
- This is true.
- Its dreadful.

137
00:47:27,265 --> 00:47:29,955
- But the bread is good.
- Its not bad.

138
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:34,125
Father, I want to thank you
for having me here.

139
00:47:37,305 --> 00:47:39,605
You should thank the Guarani.

140
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,135
How?

141
00:47:52,485 --> 00:47:54,755
Read this.

142
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:04,535
<i>"Though I have all faith
so that I could remove mountains...</i>

143
00:48:04,705 --> 00:48:07,795
<i>...and have not love, I am nothing.</i>

144
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:11,335
<i>And though I bestow all my goods
to feed the poor...</i>

145
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:14,635
<i>...and though I give my body
to be burned...</i>

146
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:19,305
<i>...and have not love,
it profiteth me nothing.</i>

147
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:23,715
<i>Love suffereth long and is kind.</i>

148
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:25,955
<i>Love envieth not.</i>

149
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:30,525
<i>Love vaunteth not itself,
is not puffed up.</i>

150
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:41,195
<i>When I was a child,
I spake as a child...</i>

151
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:44,775
<i>...I understood as a child,
I thought as a child.</i>

152
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:50,275
<i>But when I became a man,
I put away childish things.</i>

153
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:56,905
<i>But now abideth faith, hope, love...
These three.</i>

154
00:48:57,085 --> 00:49:01,025
<i>But the greatest of these is love. "</i>

155
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:09,195
They've agreed.

156
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:14,935
If you're going to become a Jesuit,
you must accept my orders...

157
00:49:15,105 --> 00:49:19,005
...as if they were the orders
of a commander. Can you do that?

158
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:21,835
Yes, Father.

159
00:49:47,205 --> 00:49:50,865
Let us pray for our brother Rodrigo.

160
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:57,005
Christ, you led Father Ignatius to
renounce the snares of this world...

161
00:49:57,175 --> 00:50:02,135
...and to put on the livery
of labor and humiliation.

162
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:09,815
Now we ask your blessing on Rodrigo
as we welcome him into our community.

163
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:14,755
Teach him to be generous,
to labor and not to count the cost...

164
00:50:14,935 --> 00:50:19,925
...to serve with no reward,
save the doing of your will.

165
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:22,405
Amen.

166
00:50:29,815 --> 00:50:32,335
Welcome home, brother.

167
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:02,815
<i>This seeking to create
a paradise on earth...</i>

168
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:05,945
<i>...how easily it offends.</i>

169
00:51:06,115 --> 00:51:07,985
<i>Your Holiness is offended...</i>

170
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:12,415
<i>...because it may distract from
that paradise which comes hereafter.</i>

171
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:15,685
<i>The Spanish and Portuguese kings
are offended...</i>

172
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:20,195
<i>...because a paradise of the poor
is seldom pleasing to those who rule.</i>

173
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:24,425
<i>And the settlers here are offended
for the same reason.</i>

174
00:51:24,605 --> 00:51:28,035
<i>So it was this burden I carried
to South America:</i>

175
00:51:28,205 --> 00:51:31,865
<i>To satisfy the Portuguese wish
to enlarge their empire...</i>

176
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:36,105
<i>...to satisfy the Spanish desire that
this would do them no harm...</i>

177
00:51:36,275 --> 00:51:38,105
<i>...to satisfy Your Holiness...</i>

178
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:42,745
<i>...that these monarchs would threaten
no more the power of the church...</i>

179
00:51:42,915 --> 00:51:45,975
<i>...and to ensure for you all...</i>

180
00:51:46,155 --> 00:51:52,215
<i>...that the Jesuits here could no longer
deny you these satisfactions.</i>

181
00:51:52,395 --> 00:51:55,835
Lve spent half my life
waiting for Rome.

182
00:51:55,995 --> 00:51:58,695
Stop playing with that.

183
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:03,125
- What time is it?
- Calm down.

184
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:05,275
Ten to.

185
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:09,365
Let me see how the children are doing.

186
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:11,775
Good.

187
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:36,295
Twenty-four.

188
00:52:38,145 --> 00:52:40,235
Thirty-nine.

189
00:53:06,305 --> 00:53:08,265
Over there, please.

190
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:22,745
- Those are Guarani?
- Yes, Your Eminence.

191
00:53:22,915 --> 00:53:25,755
- Extraordinary.
- What?

192
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:29,155
Very difficult to tell
what they're thinking.

193
00:53:29,325 --> 00:53:32,085
- Have you found this, Señor Hontar?
- I have.

194
00:53:32,265 --> 00:53:35,255
I had that reaction when I first came,
Your Eminence.

195
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:40,565
Pretty creature.
She'll fetch a lot of money in Lisbon.

196
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,395
Yes. Well, perhaps
she doesn't want to go to Lisbon.

197
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,905
Perhaps not.

198
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,845
Well, Your Eminence,
as to the missions...

199
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:56,845
We expect no political difference between
the Papacy and Spain and Portugal?

200
00:53:57,015 --> 00:53:58,685
Why should there be?

201
00:53:58,855 --> 00:54:03,385
Between ourselves, Your Eminence,
the Jesuits are too powerful here.

202
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:06,025
Indeed?

203
00:54:08,235 --> 00:54:12,725
- Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen...
- Your Eminence.

204
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:15,605
By the way, gentlemen...

205
00:54:16,505 --> 00:54:19,305
...I myself was a Jesuit once.

206
00:54:30,515 --> 00:54:36,215
<i>So I had arrived in South America, my
head replete with the matters of Europe.</i>

207
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:41,025
<i>But I soon began to understand,
for the first time...</i>

208
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:45,755
<i>...what a strange world
I had been sent to judge.</i>

209
00:55:29,775 --> 00:55:34,145
Don Cabeza, how can you possibly
refer to this child as an animal?

210
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:37,375
A parrot can be taught to sing,
Your Eminence.

211
00:55:37,655 --> 00:55:42,115
Yes, but how does one teach it
to sing as melodiously as this?

212
00:55:44,995 --> 00:55:46,895
Your Eminence.

213
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,395
This is a child of the jungle,
an animal with a human voice.

214
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:55,295
If it were human,
an animal would cringe at its vices.

215
00:55:55,475 --> 00:55:58,535
These creatures
are lethal and lecherous.

216
00:55:58,845 --> 00:56:02,605
They have to be subdued by the sword
and brought to labor by the whip.

217
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:05,835
What they say is sheer nonsense.

218
00:56:08,015 --> 00:56:14,285
Father Gabriel, of the mission of
San Carlos, from which the boy comes.

219
00:56:14,555 --> 00:56:16,455
And that is where?

220
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:25,465
That is here.
Above the falls, in Spanish territory.

221
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:30,535
No, that is territory which used
to be Spanish. Now it's Portuguese.

222
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:35,705
- That is for His Eminence to decide.
- No, that is a state matter.

223
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:41,815
It was decided by the Treaty of Madrid
and concluded by Spain and Portugal.

224
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:45,785
But surely the missions will remain
under church protection?

225
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:50,685
That is what His Eminence
is here to decide, Father Gabriel.

226
00:56:57,365 --> 00:56:59,925
Continue, Father.

227
00:57:03,705 --> 00:57:08,265
Your Eminence, below the falls,
the jungle, if it has to be divided...

228
00:57:08,445 --> 00:57:11,645
...may be divided between
the Spanish and Portuguese.

229
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:16,075
But above the falls, it still
belongs to God and the Guarani.

230
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:20,655
There's no one else there.
And they are not naturally animals.

231
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:23,725
- They're naturally spiritual.
- Spiritual?

232
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:29,355
- They kill their own young.
- That is true. May I answer that?

233
00:57:29,535 --> 00:57:35,265
Every man and woman is allowed
one child. If a third is born, it is killed.

234
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:39,605
But this is not some animal rite.
Its a necessity for survival.

235
00:57:40,545 --> 00:57:43,235
They can only run
with one child apiece.

236
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:47,405
And what do they run from?
They run from us.

237
00:57:47,585 --> 00:57:50,415
- That is, they run from slavery.
- Rubbish.

238
00:57:50,585 --> 00:57:53,415
- It is well-known...
- Rubbish. Your Eminence?

239
00:57:54,255 --> 00:57:55,625
Your Eminence?

240
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:58,195
Rubbish. Rubbish.

241
00:57:59,065 --> 00:58:00,555
Silence.

242
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:06,695
In the territories covered by Spain,
there is no slavery.

243
00:58:07,665 --> 00:58:11,605
That institution is permitted
in the territories of our neighbors...

244
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:15,645
...the Portuguese, and is, to my mind,
much misunderstood.

245
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:18,475
But here, in Spanish territory...

246
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:22,915
...we run our plantation in accordance
with the laws of Spain...

247
00:58:23,085 --> 00:58:26,245
...and the precepts of the church.

248
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:29,885
That is a lie.

249
00:58:33,995 --> 00:58:35,485
That is a lie!

250
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:41,735
I cannot and will not
accept a challenge from a monk.

251
00:58:42,805 --> 00:58:46,605
- His cloth protects him.
- My cloth protects you.

252
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:50,475
In the name of the king,
I demand an apology!

253
00:58:50,645 --> 00:58:54,445
I want an apology now!
Damn you, I won't stand for this!

254
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:07,255
Your Eminence, we've just seen
a good example of Jesuit contempt...

255
00:59:07,425 --> 00:59:10,525
...for the authority of the state.

256
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:24,875
Member of your community,
Father Gabriel?

257
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:26,475
Yes.

258
00:59:30,755 --> 00:59:31,845
Come.

259
00:59:34,025 --> 00:59:36,455
- That was perfect.
- What?

260
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:40,525
A flash of Jesuit temper was just
what we needed him to see.

261
00:59:40,695 --> 00:59:44,855
- What do you mean?
- Be patient, will you?

262
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:49,165
All we need is a little patience.
He knows what to do.

263
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:06,715
- You will apologize to Don Cabeza.
- What he said was a lie.

264
01:00:06,885 --> 01:00:11,225
Silence. You will apologize. Go now.

265
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:25,595
- What was he before he joined you?
- A mercenary and a slave trader.

266
01:00:31,155 --> 01:00:34,815
- Will he apologize?
- Yes, he will.

267
01:00:48,275 --> 01:00:51,835
You should know that the Spanish
do have slaves here.

268
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:55,445
They buy them from the Portuguese,
amongst others.

269
01:00:56,415 --> 01:01:01,445
- And Don Cabeza connives at this?
- Yes.

270
01:01:02,085 --> 01:01:04,555
Profits by it too.

271
01:01:04,725 --> 01:01:09,785
Don Cabeza wants the mission territories
to be taken over by the Portuguese. Why?

272
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:14,085
Because the missions are the
only sanctuary left for the Guarani.

273
01:01:14,265 --> 01:01:17,325
Without the shelter we provide
under Spanish law...

274
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:20,095
...the Indians have no protection
against slavery.

275
01:01:21,275 --> 01:01:23,765
They come to us of their own free will.

276
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:28,645
- Truly?
- Ask them. Ask the Guarani.

277
01:01:29,175 --> 01:01:35,145
Nine-tenths of what they earn goes back
into the community, into their lives.

278
01:01:35,315 --> 01:01:38,115
Father Gabriel, what do you think
is at issue here?

279
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:44,955
- The work of God is at issue.
- No, what is at issue...

280
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:50,035
...is the very existence of the
Jesuit order, both here and in Europe.

281
01:01:51,265 --> 01:01:56,225
And I assure you that
the courts of Europe are a jungle...

282
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:59,605
...in comparison with which
your jungle here is a tidy garden.

283
01:01:59,775 --> 01:02:02,215
But is that to stand in our way?

284
01:02:14,495 --> 01:02:16,425
Thank you.

285
01:02:26,365 --> 01:02:29,865
- But why must I apologize? Why?
- Because I order it.

286
01:02:30,035 --> 01:02:32,435
- It was a lie.
- Nevertheless, I order it.

287
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:37,235
Don Cabeza hates Jesuits and Indians.
He and the Portuguese are ruthless.

288
01:02:37,685 --> 01:02:39,735
- Can't you see that?
- Of course.

289
01:02:39,915 --> 01:02:43,145
- Then why must I apologize?
- What better excuse can we give them...

290
01:02:43,315 --> 01:02:48,955
...but that one of our order, albeit a
novice, publicly insults one of them?

291
01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:53,455
Now, you will apologize.

292
01:02:58,735 --> 01:03:01,565
Or are you no longer a Jesuit?

293
01:04:01,865 --> 01:04:05,265
By order of holy obedience,
without reservation...

294
01:04:05,435 --> 01:04:11,035
...I ask Don Cabeza to pardon
my presumption and my insolence.

295
01:04:15,515 --> 01:04:19,105
Well, I accept.

296
01:04:19,545 --> 01:04:21,515
Why not?

297
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:26,555
But as I said before, I cannot accept
a challenge from a priest.

298
01:04:26,725 --> 01:04:30,355
True, which makes my insolence
all the more insolent...

299
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:32,655
...and your pardon twice as gracious.

300
01:04:34,935 --> 01:04:38,025
Your Eminence, I ask your pardon too.

301
01:04:38,235 --> 01:04:44,435
I ask the pardon of this assembly.
I ask for the pardon of my brothers.

302
01:04:44,605 --> 01:04:46,505
And I ask for your pardon...

303
01:04:48,715 --> 01:04:52,235
...for insulting His Excellency.
- Thank you, that will do.

304
01:04:59,885 --> 01:05:03,515
Well, that was most gratifying,
Your Eminence.

305
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:11,095
Do you think you could tell us about
your attitude to the transference...

306
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:13,495
...of the missions' territories?
- Precisely.

307
01:05:13,665 --> 01:05:19,665
I have kept these matters in the front
of my mind ever since I came here.

308
01:05:19,845 --> 01:05:23,205
But I do not think
I should make a final decision...

309
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:27,945
...until I have seen these mission
territories with my own eyes.

310
01:05:28,115 --> 01:05:31,385
There are numerous missions
that I should inspect.

311
01:05:31,555 --> 01:05:35,685
<i>But I have decided that
I shall begin with the oldest...</i>

312
01:05:35,855 --> 01:05:39,915
<i>...the great mission of San Miguel.</i>

313
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:54,375
<i>Your Holiness, a surgeon,
to save the body...</i>

314
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:57,945
<i>...must often hack off a limb.</i>

315
01:05:58,115 --> 01:06:04,055
<i>But, in truth, nothing had prepared me
for the beauty and the power...</i>

316
01:06:04,225 --> 01:06:08,625
<i>...of the limb that I
had come here to sever.</i>

317
01:07:50,183 --> 01:07:54,123
- Very impressive.
- Perhaps lm missing something.

318
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:58,353
I can't see any difference
between this plantation and my own.

319
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,363
That is the difference.
This plantation is theirs.

320
01:08:11,873 --> 01:08:13,843
This is another difference.

321
01:08:15,713 --> 01:08:22,123
A runaway slave. Bought by
a Spanish settler from a slave trader.

322
01:08:22,753 --> 01:08:26,243
I see. Is that lawful?

323
01:08:26,423 --> 01:08:28,823
Supply and demand is the law of trade.

324
01:08:28,993 --> 01:08:32,153
- And the law of souls?
- What's a few cuts on the back...

325
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:37,033
...compared with what you offer them?
Torments of hell? Imprisoned souls?

326
01:08:37,203 --> 01:08:40,173
Think of that, Your Eminence.

327
01:08:46,943 --> 01:08:50,473
Father Ibaye, shall we continue?

328
01:09:30,823 --> 01:09:33,293
What was your income last year?

329
01:09:33,453 --> 01:09:37,693
Last year, 120,000 escudos.

330
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:40,493
And how was it distributed?

331
01:09:40,863 --> 01:09:44,803
It is shared among them equally.
This is a community.

332
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:49,933
Yes, there is a French radical group
that teaches that doctrine.

333
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:55,633
Your Eminence, it was the doctrine
of the early Christians.

334
01:09:55,813 --> 01:09:59,913
Well, I am inexpressibly impressed
by your achievement, Father.

335
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:04,923
- And will that save us?
- I hope it may, Father.

336
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:12,123
The court of Portugal is atheistic,
but you and I are Christian Catholics.

337
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:16,963
- And you serve a Christian king.
- Come, I also serve a Catholic king.

338
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:21,123
You serve the Marquis of Pombal,
who is hostile to the church...

339
01:10:21,303 --> 01:10:23,403
...and rules your king.

340
01:10:23,573 --> 01:10:29,483
I suggest we advise your king to postpone
the transfer of the mission territories...

341
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:32,543
...until Portugal guarantees
their survival.

342
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:36,313
And I suggest we do this
in the hope of heaven...

343
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:40,153
...through the intercession
of our merciful Redeemer.

344
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:46,023
In my opinion, the work of the
missions is the work of the devil.

345
01:10:46,193 --> 01:10:51,363
They teach contempt for lawful profit,
and they disobey the king's authority.

346
01:10:51,533 --> 01:10:54,973
The paramount vow of a Jesuit
is a vow of obedience.

347
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:59,373
Then let them obey.
Tell them, Your Eminence.

348
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:21,523
Am I disturbing you?

349
01:11:23,663 --> 01:11:27,833
I fear I have bad tidings
from the Marquis of Pombal.

350
01:11:36,443 --> 01:11:40,853
Between ourselves, I should like
to express my personal regret.

351
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:47,383
He is determined to destroy
the power of the church.

352
01:11:50,263 --> 01:11:54,253
And your Christian community
is commercially competitive.

353
01:11:54,433 --> 01:11:58,763
Yes. Its very prosperous.

354
01:11:59,173 --> 01:12:02,363
Isn't that precisely why
you want to take it over?

355
01:12:02,773 --> 01:12:07,473
You should've achieved a noble failure
if you wanted the state's approval.

356
01:12:07,643 --> 01:12:11,203
There's nothing we like better
than a noble failure.

357
01:12:11,383 --> 01:12:16,043
Its deeply reassuring
to a trading nation such as my own.

358
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:22,483
You're not going to read it?

359
01:12:22,663 --> 01:12:26,683
I don't need to read it
to know what it contains.

360
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,393
So, what will you do?

361
01:12:31,573 --> 01:12:34,763
As my conscience dictates.

362
01:12:34,943 --> 01:12:36,933
What else?

363
01:13:10,243 --> 01:13:13,503
He's been in there five hours.

364
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:18,273
Come with me to my mission
in San Carlos.

365
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:22,673
There are so many distractions here.

366
01:14:24,013 --> 01:14:27,883
Its hard to see anything clearly.

367
01:14:30,123 --> 01:14:35,213
I think that, there, your prayers
might meet with better fortune.

368
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:42,733
I think, there, God would tell you
what it would be good to do.

369
01:14:44,973 --> 01:14:48,533
And he'd give you the strength
and the grace to do it...

370
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:53,303
...whatever it costs you.

371
01:15:53,873 --> 01:15:56,033
The Garden of Eden.

372
01:15:57,343 --> 01:15:59,503
Its a trifle overgrown.

373
01:21:09,523 --> 01:21:15,353
<i>Though I knew, in Europe, states were
tearing at the authority of the church...</i>

374
01:21:15,523 --> 01:21:18,653
<i>...and though I knew that to
preserve itself there...</i>

375
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:22,923
<i>...the church must show
its authority over the Jesuits here...</i>

376
01:21:23,103 --> 01:21:27,403
<i>...I had to wonder whether these
Indians would not have preferred...</i>

377
01:21:27,573 --> 01:21:33,103
<i>...that the sea and wind
had not brought any of us to them.</i>

378
01:21:44,853 --> 01:21:47,983
They say they don't understand
what you mean.

379
01:21:50,723 --> 01:21:55,163
They want you to speak more clearly.
What do you want them to do?

380
01:21:55,733 --> 01:21:58,493
They must leave the mission.

381
01:22:29,263 --> 01:22:32,363
They say the mission is their home.

382
01:22:32,973 --> 01:22:35,233
They must learn to submit
to the will of God.

383
01:22:39,043 --> 01:22:40,403
Tell them.

384
01:23:01,263 --> 01:23:03,293
They say it was the will of God...

385
01:23:03,463 --> 01:23:06,063
...that they left the jungle
and built the mission.

386
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:10,593
They don't understand
why God has changed his mind.

387
01:23:10,773 --> 01:23:13,403
I cannot hope
to understand God's reasons.

388
01:23:20,353 --> 01:23:23,113
He says, how does he know
you know God's will?

389
01:23:27,453 --> 01:23:30,793
He thinks you speak not for God,
but for Portugal.

390
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:35,863
I do not personally speak for God,
but I speak for the church...

391
01:23:36,033 --> 01:23:38,333
...which is God's instrument on earth.

392
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:56,953
- He says, speak to the king of Portugal.
- I have. He will not listen.

393
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:06,023
He said he is also a king.
He also will not listen.

394
01:24:20,413 --> 01:24:23,773
He says they were wrong
ever to have trusted us.

395
01:24:25,213 --> 01:24:29,843
- They're going to fight.
- You must persuade them not to fight.

396
01:24:32,593 --> 01:24:36,523
I have failed to persuade you
to fight on their behalf.

397
01:24:36,693 --> 01:24:41,023
If they do fight, it is absolutely
imperative that no one of you...

398
01:24:41,193 --> 01:24:45,103
...should even seemed
to have encouraged them to do so.

399
01:24:45,273 --> 01:24:50,703
And therefore, all of you will return
with me to Asunción tomorrow.

400
01:24:51,603 --> 01:24:55,673
If anyone should disobey this,
he will be excommunicated.

401
01:24:55,843 --> 01:24:59,443
Cut off. Cast out.

402
01:25:02,753 --> 01:25:04,943
Why must they fight?

403
01:25:05,123 --> 01:25:09,453
- Why can't they return to the jungle?
- Because this is their home.

404
01:25:11,563 --> 01:25:14,893
Did you know this was going
to be your decision?

405
01:25:15,063 --> 01:25:19,233
- Yes.
- Then why did you come, Your Eminence?

406
01:25:19,403 --> 01:25:24,843
To persuade you not to resist the
transfer of the mission territories.

407
01:25:27,243 --> 01:25:31,513
If the Jesuits
resist the Portuguese...

408
01:25:31,683 --> 01:25:34,553
...the Jesuit order
will be expelled from Portugal.

409
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:40,553
And if Portugal, then Spain,
France, Italy...Who knows?

410
01:25:40,723 --> 01:25:44,383
If your order is to survive at all...

411
01:25:44,563 --> 01:25:48,553
...the missions here
must be sacrificed.

412
01:25:55,973 --> 01:25:57,373
What were they saying?

413
01:25:58,513 --> 01:26:01,743
They said the devil
lives in the forest.

414
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:06,073
- They want to stay here.
- And what did you say?

415
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:09,543
I said ld stay with them.

416
01:28:44,473 --> 01:28:47,913
I want to renounce
my vows of obedience.

417
01:28:48,513 --> 01:28:50,413
Get out.

418
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:53,643
- I want to explain...
- Get out. I won't listen to you.

419
01:29:00,493 --> 01:29:02,923
Just you?

420
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:06,323
No. Its Ralph and John too.

421
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:10,923
What do you want, captain,
an honorable death?

422
01:29:11,533 --> 01:29:13,803
They want to live, Father.

423
01:29:14,533 --> 01:29:18,103
They say that God has left them,
he's deserted them.

424
01:29:18,343 --> 01:29:19,643
Has he?

425
01:29:22,843 --> 01:29:26,783
- You shouldn't have become a priest.
- But I am, and they need me.

426
01:29:26,953 --> 01:29:29,183
Then help them as a priest!

427
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:36,683
If you die with blood on your hands,
you betray everything we've done.

428
01:29:36,863 --> 01:29:41,623
You promised your life to God.
And God is love!

429
01:35:02,453 --> 01:35:05,613
Weren't you supposed
to be on guard last night?

430
01:35:05,793 --> 01:35:07,623
Look what happened!

431
01:35:08,553 --> 01:35:11,353
Get back there with the others.

432
01:35:11,523 --> 01:35:14,983
They've taken three guns,
gunpowder, pistols...

433
01:35:15,163 --> 01:35:17,863
...and I don't know what else.

434
01:37:42,413 --> 01:37:45,903
Father, lve come
to ask you to bless me.

435
01:37:51,253 --> 01:37:52,483
No.

436
01:37:57,123 --> 01:37:59,653
If you're right,
you'll have God's blessing.

437
01:38:01,493 --> 01:38:04,863
If you're wrong,
my blessing won't mean anything.

438
01:38:07,133 --> 01:38:10,403
If might is right...

439
01:38:10,573 --> 01:38:14,163
...then love has no place
in the world.

440
01:38:15,313 --> 01:38:18,613
It may be so.

441
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:24,013
But I don't have the strength
to live in a world like that.

442
01:38:31,863 --> 01:38:33,723
I can't bless you.

443
01:41:04,143 --> 01:41:07,673
Down there. Down there.

444
01:41:08,313 --> 01:41:09,843
Bring up both cannons.

445
01:41:15,153 --> 01:41:17,523
Quickly. Quickly.

446
01:41:18,923 --> 01:41:20,623
The other cannon as well.

447
01:44:16,943 --> 01:44:20,503
Indians! Turn around!

448
01:44:21,713 --> 01:44:26,513
Turn around! Face them!

449
01:46:35,243 --> 01:46:36,713
Fire!

450
01:47:10,083 --> 01:47:12,313
We'll have to move the cannon.

451
01:47:12,483 --> 01:47:15,783
Move this cannon. Move it.
And that one.

452
01:47:16,523 --> 01:47:18,643
Over there. Shoot the priest.
Get him!

453
01:48:45,273 --> 01:48:50,043
- None of us wants to do this.
- Lm not interested. Get in position.

454
01:49:43,563 --> 01:49:45,263
Row.

455
01:50:00,613 --> 01:50:02,203
After him! Faster!

456
01:50:10,293 --> 01:50:12,953
Don't let the priest get away!

457
01:50:13,123 --> 01:50:14,853
After him!

458
01:50:24,343 --> 01:50:26,503
Look out! The falls! Halt!

459
01:50:30,883 --> 01:50:33,173
Back! Back! Halt!

460
01:50:43,893 --> 01:50:46,153
Go back!

461
01:57:50,753 --> 01:57:55,983
And you have the effrontery to tell me
that this slaughter was necessary?

462
01:57:58,293 --> 01:58:01,523
I did what I had to do.

463
01:58:01,693 --> 01:58:06,153
Given the legitimate purpose,
which you sanctioned...

464
01:58:06,333 --> 01:58:12,573
...I would have to say, yes.
In truth, yes.

465
01:58:27,693 --> 01:58:30,553
You had no alternative, Your Eminence.

466
01:58:33,123 --> 01:58:35,353
We must work in the world.

467
01:58:37,103 --> 01:58:39,433
The world is thus.

468
01:58:40,403 --> 01:58:43,563
No, Señor Hontar...

469
01:58:43,743 --> 01:58:46,643
...thus have we made the world.

470
01:58:51,143 --> 01:58:53,443
Thus have I made it.

471
02:00:22,373 --> 02:00:25,563
<i>So, Your Holiness...</i>

472
02:00:25,743 --> 02:00:31,773
<i>...now your priests are dead,
and I am left alive.</i>

473
02:00:31,943 --> 02:00:38,143
<i>But, in truth, it is I who am dead,
and they who live.</i>

474
02:00:38,323 --> 02:00:41,383
<i>For, as always, Your Holiness...</i>

475
02:00:41,553 --> 02:00:45,393
<i>...the spirit of the dead
will survive...</i>

476
02:00:45,563 --> 02:00:49,423
<i>...in the memory of the living.</i>
