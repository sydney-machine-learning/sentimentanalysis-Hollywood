1
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,159
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

2
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,246
I want to, but I have
a million things to do first.

3
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,214
Mom, what's this?

4
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,759
Peanut butter.
Peanut butter and what?

5
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,552
Peanut butter and jelly.

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,055
What kind of jelly?

7
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,723
Zucchini jelly.

8
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:54,341
Five, six, seven!

9
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,281
How we doing?

10
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,783
We're doing fine, Walter.

11
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,328
I wish we could afford
to keep you full time.

12
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,831
So do I, especially now.

13
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:29,293
Hmm. Is the divorce final yet?

14
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,839
Yes, today. Thank you.

15
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:37,719
Let's put our heads rogether and
maybe we can work something out.

16
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:48,646
All right.

17
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:50,857
Uh, horns up.

18
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:54,235
One, two, three, four...

19
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,654
...five, six, seven.

20
00:03:57,156 --> 00:04:03,328
O beautiful for spacious skies

21
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:09,500
For amber waves of grain

22
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:15,673
For purple mountain majesties

23
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:21,346
Above the fruited plain!

24
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:28,603
America! America!

25
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:34,860
God shed his grace on thee

26
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:41,325
And crown thy good with brotherhood

27
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:48,207
From sea to shining sea!

28
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,172
Well, wonderful.
Thank you very much, Felicia.

29
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,218
We appreciate your taking the time
to be here with us today.

30
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:03,055
Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand
for our most prominent selectman...

31
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:07,559
...or selectwoman or selectperson,
Felicia Alden.

32
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:12,564
Thank you, children and Mrs. Spofford.

33
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:15,859
I can see we have our work
cut out for us.

34
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,454
In these days of
disintegrating values...

35
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:29,957
...and lost mores...

36
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,043
...when our children
are exposed daily...

37
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:38,258
...to the hazards of divorce, separation
and families torn asunder...

38
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:41,845
...it's comforting to think back
to the days...

39
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:45,223
...when a family like the Lenoxes
strove together.

40
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:49,227
Those values, embodied
in a man like Major Lenox...

41
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,314
They were men who labored
all their lives...

42
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:57,944
...so their children would be
well-fed and clothed and educated.

43
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,989
The families endured great hardship...

44
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:06,161
...yet kept their honor...

45
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,330
...their dignity and their faith in God.

46
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:15,628
We are the same people;
the same body, the soul...

47
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,674
...the hands and the feet
of our fathers...

48
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,178
...fighting the wars of modern vice.

49
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,681
What was it that tied
these people together?

50
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,184
What was it that made them...

51
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:33,396
...not a loose gathering of individuals,
but a single bond?

52
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:39,069
That bond that held them together,
as it holds us together today.

53
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:42,156
That bond that has stood every test...

54
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,201
...is found deep in our consciousness.

55
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:48,037
An abiding love of liberty.

56
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:52,416
For love of liberty, our forbearers...

57
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:56,212
...colonies few in number and
with little to defend themselves...

58
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:59,423
...fought the war for independence...

59
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:03,344
...what was then the world's
most powerful empire.

60
00:07:04,763 --> 00:07:05,930
For love of liberty...

61
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:09,183
...those who came before us
tamed a vast wilderness...

62
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,185
...and braved hardships...

63
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,357
Tamed a vast wilderness
and braved hardships...

64
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:19,401
...which at times were
beyond the limit...

65
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:28,410
Braved hardships, which at times were
beyond the limit of human endurance.

66
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:42,800
Come on. Go with your mom. Go on.

67
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:50,766
Liberty must not be taken for granted.
We thank God for our blessings...

68
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,633
Oh, hi, come on in.
Janey, come on!

69
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,346
Do you believe it's raining?

70
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:30,639
Duh, no.

71
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:32,433
I mean, since this morning.

72
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:33,934
At least it shut Walter up.

73
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,812
The same boring, sanctimonious speech.

74
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:42,276
I thought he'd go on forever.
I was praying for something to happen.

75
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:45,446
- I was thinking the same thing.
- You were?

76
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:50,327
I was thinking we're all wet and
how nice it would be to just leave.

77
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,120
Were you really?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,289
And then it rained.

79
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:57,792
He's a liar and a lech
and he deserved it.

80
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,586
No, I'm not talking about Walter.

81
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:01,713
Don't you think it's strange
that we were...

82
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:04,966
We were thinking the same thing
at the same time? So what?

83
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,177
It won't get us on David Letterman.

84
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:09,137
- I know, I...
- Let's just have a drink.

85
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:12,182
Good idea, Janey, party-baby!

86
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:28,865
You know, he made
a pass at me last week too.

87
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:32,535
Walter? Oh, please.
I can't even stand to think about it.

88
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,829
Be prepared.
He does not give up easily.

89
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:39,334
It was broad daylight and his wife
was standing ten feet away!

90
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:40,585
Poor woman.

91
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:45,173
Poor woman, my ass. Why does she
put up with it? The man is a Nazi.

92
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:49,512
Do you think they still... you know?

93
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:50,846
Yes.

94
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:54,350
- Really?
I hope his dick is bigger than his I.Q.

95
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:57,228
Once a week. He told me.
- He told you.

96
00:09:57,646 --> 00:10:00,189
Otherwise she starts throwing things.

97
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,900
At least someone's getting
something once a week.

98
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:04,443
Yes, heartburn.

99
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:08,864
Mm. I keep forgetting how many calories
are in these.

100
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:10,199
Two minutes on the lips,

101
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,034
Forever on the love handles.

102
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,375
Ooh. And congratulations.

103
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:24,213
Oh, God, I forgot. Your divorce.

104
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:26,757
As of today, I'm a free woman.

105
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:29,677
Join the club.
- Thanks.

106
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:33,389
Heh. Here I go again.

107
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:37,560
It's over, honey. You'll be okay.

108
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,604
It's a beginning, not an ending.
Right, Alex?

109
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,524
Besides, we still have each other.

110
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,776
Have some more martooni.

111
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,321
- Did you bring the cards?
- Was I supposed to?

112
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:51,782
- I have them.
- Okay, come on ladies, let's do it! Whoo!

113
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:57,998
I feel like I'm being unfaithful...

114
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,625
...even if I just think about it.

115
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:05,589
Sukie, Monty deserted you
and left you with five kids.

116
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:07,507
- Six.
- Don't start, Alex.

117
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:10,886
Her husband left because
she had too many kids.

118
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,347
- That's his problem.
- You're oversimplifying.

119
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:17,392
- Yours left because you can't have any.
- You are definitely oversimplifying.

120
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:19,144
That's not the point.

121
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,521
What I'm saying is
that it's not your fault.

122
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:24,983
That doesn't matter.
It's just not that easy.

123
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,903
We're too young to lock it up
and throw away the key.

124
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:29,529
It's not natural.

125
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:32,324
What are we doing with ourselves?

126
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,494
Look, Ozzie's dead. I loved him.
He's dead.

127
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,706
So I spend Thursday nights
with you two the rest of my life?

128
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:43,543
I like our Thursdays.
It's the only time I can relax.

129
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:47,506
Quilting, macramé.
What did we do last Thursday night?

130
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,299
Chinese aphrodisiac cooking.

131
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:52,719
Fabulous. Stimulating.
We're not relaxing, we're hiding.

132
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,805
- What from?
- Walter Neff.

133
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:58,142
Fuck Walter Neff.
I'm not talking about him.

134
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:03,856
All right, who should we be looking for?

135
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,652
Somebody nice. Somebody you could like.

136
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,154
Somebody with a brain.
Somebody you could talk to.

137
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:12,573
Somebody you could be yourself with.

138
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:18,996
Someone to watch over me

139
00:12:19,248 --> 00:12:21,791
All right, I've had it with you two.

140
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,173
He would have to be from out of town.

141
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,843
Especially considering what's in town.

142
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,887
A stranger. That would be interesting.

143
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:38,891
A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse.

144
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:40,768
In Eastwick?

145
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:42,770
Romantic.

146
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:46,065
A foreign prince on a big, black horse.

147
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:53,281
All right, no, no, no.
If we're going to have it...

148
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,867
...let's have it all.

149
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,173
He should be really handsome.

150
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:10,883
Not too handsome.

151
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:12,384
Nice eyes.

152
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:14,011
Nice ass.

153
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,442
Huge.

154
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,361
I prefer small.

155
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,239
Aesthetically, I prefer small.

156
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:38,327
Sam was huge and there were times
when I could not face it.

157
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:40,871
I'm in the middle myself.

158
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,707
But who cares?
As long as it works, it's in.

159
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,584
- It's in.
- Okay.

160
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:14,948
It's a nice thought, but wishing
for it won't make it happen.

161
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:20,370
Men are not the answer to everything.

162
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:26,668
So why do we always end up
talking about them?

163
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:59,200
I said, some man bought
the Lenox mansion.

164
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,204
Did you hear me?

165
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:05,206
Yeah. Who is he?

166
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:08,419
He's from New York, no wife, no family.

167
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:12,548
He told the realtors he needed room
for his pianos.

168
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:15,134
Apparently, he has a lot of pianos.

169
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:17,928
How many pianos can one guy have?

170
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:21,890
Don't you think it's kind of
strange and funny?

171
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,851
What's his name?

172
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:27,062
You know, that's strange too.

173
00:15:28,857 --> 00:15:30,649
What's strange about his name?

174
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:34,194
They told me his name
for the column and I forgot it.

175
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:37,281
So I called back and it's gone again.

176
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:40,075
It's not like me to forget a name.

177
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,120
It's the big news of the day...

178
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:47,333
...considering the history of the place.
I wonder if he knows.

179
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,751
I don't know.

180
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:52,087
Is that Clyde and Felicia?

181
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:58,844
Yeah. Clyde?
I'll call you back, okay?

182
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:03,599
I have this culinary piece.
Hi, Felicia.

183
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,977
"Cheeseburger pie"?
Is your column finished?

184
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:12,108
Here's the track meet, births and
deaths, the senior citizens' news.

185
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:16,988
The toxic waste article
should be done this afternoon.

186
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:18,573
This pie looks good.

187
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:21,368
Did you hear someone bought
the Lenox mansion?

188
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:39,094
That house is landmark building.
They have no right to sell it.

189
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,805
I can't do anything about that.

190
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,140
No.

191
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:45,934
You're too busy...

192
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:51,106
...reporting on the horse trough and
Herbie Prescott's trip to Bermuda.

193
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:56,820
What's going to happen
to those birds now? Tell me that.

194
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,154
What birds?

195
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:00,031
The snowy egrets.

196
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,783
Where will they nest?

197
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,493
I don't know.

198
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,287
Exactly.

199
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,666
Felicia, what's the matter?

200
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,922
Honey. It's only a house.
Why are you so upset?

201
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:16,674
I have a feeling.

202
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,051
The most terrible feeling.

203
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:22,680
Something is happening.
Something evil.

204
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:33,482
I'm just glad they're selling.
I was afraid that...

205
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,610
They're not selling, they sold.
Just like that.

206
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,987
I don't understand.

207
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:42,658
You know I adore the little creatures.
So unreal, and yet the detail.

208
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:47,830
Little fingers and toes, little pudenda
making a bump. So sweet.

209
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:51,667
But nobody's even looked
at them sideways in months.

210
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,586
Then this morning...

211
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:57,631
...this man appeared
out of absolutely nowhere.

212
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,261
So charming. Not really handsome,
but... riveting.

213
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:05,973
That's it. I was riveted.
I looked into his eyes...

214
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:09,977
...and had thoughts I hadn't
entertained since World War II.

215
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:13,439
I think I actually blushed.
Can you imagine?

216
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,234
No, I mean, yeah. So he bought one?

217
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:19,029
He bought all of them.
Every single one.

218
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,822
So who was he? A tourist?

219
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,534
No, he just bought the Lenox house.
He's moving in.

220
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,162
Do you remember his name?

221
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,539
Of course. His name is...

222
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,045
He told me.

223
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:37,547
I wrote it down, even.

224
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:39,716
It was...

225
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:41,635
...foreign.

226
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:44,554
It sounded...

227
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:49,392
It's right on the tip of my tongue,
but I can't...

228
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,732
Isn't that diabolical?

229
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,787
What is that noise?

230
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,791
I don't know.

231
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:18,732
Outrageous!

232
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:51,432
Brava!

233
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:58,272
Bravis!

234
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,367
He bought all of them?

235
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,370
- And now he's here.
- Making goo-goo eyes at Jane.

236
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,956
And the interview too. How weird.

237
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,085
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, it was after we talked.

238
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,546
The paper called him
and asked to interview him...

239
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,968
About the house renovation and all.

240
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:29,221
He said he'd love to be interviewed
and asked for me.

241
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:30,430
Why?

242
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:33,350
I don't know, I mean he wants me
to do the interview.

243
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,103
- Who is he?
- He must have a name.

244
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,896
I just can't remember it.

245
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:39,940
Why would he ask for you?

246
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:44,653
Because I'm good at it.
You act like I'm so stupid.

247
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,072
He was in my shop.

248
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:50,617
You're not stupid. But how does
he know who Sukie Ridgemont is?

249
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:51,952
I don't know.

250
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,788
He bought the Lenox estate
just like that.

251
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:58,333
- From New York.
- He has some kind of a foreign name.

252
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,545
Van something or other.

253
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,926
Oh, there you are. How sweet.

254
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:11,096
They're from him. With a personal note.

255
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:15,142
- Just the initial "D."
- Yeah, it starts with "D."

256
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:19,104
- David?
- No. It has an "R" in it.

257
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,605
Doberman?

258
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:22,107
- Drake?
- Darren.

259
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:25,861
It's "D" something, "R" something, "L."
Daryl!

260
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,575
- van Horne.
- Yes!

261
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:32,452
- Daryl Van Horne.
- Daryl Van Horne?

262
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,287
What kind of name is that?

263
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:41,252
Felicia!

264
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:48,760
Sweetheart?

265
00:22:57,728 --> 00:22:59,395
Oh, Clyde, honey.

266
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,815
I think I broke my leg.

267
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:57,204
Looking for me?

268
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:04,211
Are you looking for me?
Or is this just a happy coincidence?

269
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:07,047
- Actually, I was...
- Just looking.

270
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:09,550
Well, too bad.

271
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:13,262
Have you seen any snowy egrets out here?

272
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:15,889
- No.
- Neither have I.

273
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:21,228
Not that I'd know a snowy egret if I was
pissing on one. You want some lunch?

274
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,731
I think it's a little late
in the season.

275
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:27,651
For lunch?

276
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:29,278
No, pissing on birds.

277
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:36,578
Daryl Van Horne.

278
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,079
Alexandra Medford.

279
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:41,249
The local sculptress.
The one who makes...

280
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:43,251
...the little booby dolls.

281
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:45,128
They're just little...

282
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:49,090
Little, yes, but potent. Full of juice.

283
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:53,595
Potent. You can feel it
when you pick them up.

284
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:55,763
I sent a couple to New York.

285
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:59,517
I have a friend down there.
Terrific fellow.

286
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:03,104
He has a gallery.
I wanted to hear his opinion.

287
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,399
Of course the scale is wrong.
Get bigger.

288
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:10,195
Let yourself go.
Get some size into it.

289
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,699
Do you like fish?
We're having fish for lunch.

290
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,970
Interesting, huh?

291
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:37,680
Oh, yes.

292
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,642
Fidel, that's his name.

293
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:42,811
Women love him.
They're crazy about him.

294
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:45,814
He has a big schlong.

295
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,399
Huge.

296
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:51,153
Well, there you are.
Scale again. Size.

297
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,906
Who knows, maybe it's a masculine thing.

298
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:59,703
They say women don't care. I'm in
the middle myself. How about you?

299
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,664
How about me, what?

300
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:05,167
See, women are in touch
with different things.

301
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:10,256
That's my opinion. It's not a
fashionable one right now, but fuck it!

302
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,261
I see men running around,
putting their dicks...

303
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,222
...into everything,
trying to make something happen.

304
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,393
But it's women who are the source,
the only power.

305
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:25,521
Nature. Birth. Rebirth.

306
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,982
Cliché. Cliché.

307
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,150
Sure. But true.

308
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:32,861
Why are you telling me this?

309
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:37,241
You're an honest woman.
I'm being honest with you.

310
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:40,744
I like women. I admire them.

311
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:45,375
But if you want me to treat you
like a dumb twit, I will.

312
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,837
But what for? You have brains, Alex.

313
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:53,466
More than brains. But you don't
know it. Most women don't.

314
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:55,010
Are you married?

315
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:56,386
Good question!

316
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:59,139
You see? Brains.

317
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,392
The answer is no.
I don't believe in it.

318
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,228
Good for the man.
Lousy for the woman.

319
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,026
She dies. She suffocates.
I've seen it. Then the husband...

320
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:14,070
...complains to everyone that
he's fucking a dead person.

321
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:15,613
And he's the one who killed her.

322
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:20,910
- Where is your husband?
- Dead.

323
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:24,414
Sorry, but you're one of the lucky ones.

324
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:28,918
When a woman unloads a husband
or a husband unloads a woman...

325
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:33,590
...however it happens...
death, desertion, divorce: the three Ds.

326
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:38,261
When that happens, a woman blooms.
She blossoms.

327
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:42,098
Like flowers. Like fruit.

328
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,600
She is ripe.

329
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:46,937
That's the woman for me.

330
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,114
Would you like to see my house?

331
00:27:58,325 --> 00:27:59,825
Yes.

332
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,287
In case anybody ever...

333
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:05,623
...needed any exercise...

334
00:28:06,124 --> 00:28:09,877
...the pool is right over there,
past the piano...

335
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:12,463
...where the ballroom used to be.

336
00:28:12,964 --> 00:28:15,299
Interesting word, "ballroom. "

337
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:16,967
It's one of my favorites.

338
00:28:17,135 --> 00:28:19,136
Over there is...

339
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,390
...my study.

340
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:29,647
- This is my bedroom.
- Yes, it is.

341
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:32,400
The Borgias once owned the bed.

342
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:37,988
Of course, you have to pay for it
with your soul, but...

343
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:41,325
...what the hell,
I deserve a little luxury.

344
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,911
You have to take care of yourself.

345
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,789
No one will do that for you, will they?

346
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:56,758
Ha. Ha-ha.
What do you think you're doing?

347
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:02,848
Being as direct with you as I know how.
I thought you'd appreciate it.

348
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:08,770
I always like a little pussy
after lunch. What do you say?

349
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:12,858
- Hmm?
- Are you trying to seduce me?

350
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:16,862
I wouldn't dream of seducing you,
Alexandra.

351
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:19,364
I wouldn't insult your intelligence...

352
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:22,701
...with anything as trivial
as seduction.

353
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:27,414
But, I would love to fuck you.

354
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,422
I have to admit that I appreciate
your directness, Daryl.

355
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,048
I will try to be as direct...

356
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,593
...and honest with you
as I possibly can be.

357
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,803
I think...

358
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:46,975
No, I am positive that you are the most
unattractive man I have ever met...

359
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:48,935
...in my entire life.

360
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:54,025
This afternoon, you have demonstrated
every loathsome characteristic...

361
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:57,111
...of the male personality
and even added some new ones.

362
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,531
You are physically repulsive,
intellectually retarded...

363
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:05,661
...morally reprehensible, vulgar,
insensitive, selfish, stupid.

364
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:09,123
You have no taste, no sense of humor
and you smell.

365
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:13,127
You're not even interesting enough
to make me sick.

366
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,424
Um... Would you like to be
on top or the bottom?

367
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,596
Goodbye, Daryl, and thank you
for a lovely lunch.

368
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:26,766
If that's the way you feel about it...

369
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,477
...that's the way you feel about it.

370
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,854
Is that the way you feel about it?

371
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:39,654
Who are you?

372
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,865
Just your...

373
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:45,952
...average horny little devil.

374
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,663
I have to get home.

375
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,749
What have you got to go home to?

376
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,377
There isn't anybody there, is there?

377
00:30:54,962 --> 00:30:56,963
The kid will take care of herself.

378
00:30:57,631 --> 00:31:01,634
She'll eat and fall asleep
on the bed doing homework.

379
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:03,636
I promise.

380
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:06,305
And housecleaning?

381
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,309
You clean up the dirt,
there's just more dirt tomorrow.

382
00:31:10,644 --> 00:31:13,938
Make the beds, they just
have to be made tomorrow.

383
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,525
Wash the dishes.
There's more to wash tomorrow.

384
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:19,694
- I have to make...
- Make dinner?

385
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:21,654
It just gets eaten.

386
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:23,823
You've done your best, Alex.

387
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:27,910
You've done the wife bit,
the motherhood bit.

388
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:31,497
The car pools, the vegetable garden...

389
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:34,834
...the needlepoint,
the macramé potholders...

390
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,004
...a cup of coffee with
a neighbor in the morning...

391
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:42,508
...a couple of drinks,
a couple of pills...

392
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:45,428
...a little psychoanalysis...

393
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,347
Where are you now, Alex?

394
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:51,309
Exactly where I want to be
and I'm doing fine.

395
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:56,689
Pretending to be somebody else?
To be half of what you are?

396
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:59,359
How long can you last like that?

397
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:03,572
The world keeps growing,
and you feed it.

398
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,866
But it doesn't feed you, does it?

399
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:09,870
It washes through you,
down the drain, wasted.

400
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,748
A woman is a hole,
isn't that what they say?

401
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:16,543
All the futility of the world
pouring into her.

402
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:23,884
How much can you take, Alex?
How much can you take...

403
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:26,053
...before you snap?

404
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:31,558
Lying on your bed,
looking at the ceiling...

405
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:33,727
...waiting for something to happen.

406
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:38,482
And knowing all the time that you
were meant for something better.

407
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,692
Feeling it.

408
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,486
Wanting it.

409
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,489
Use me, Alex.

410
00:32:46,574 --> 00:32:47,908
Use me.

411
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,744
Fill me up. I can take it.

412
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:54,039
Make it happen. Don't wait.

413
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:56,416
Time is the killer.

414
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:58,752
Make it happen.

415
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:01,589
Do it, Alex.

416
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:03,591
Do it now.

417
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,565
You know...

418
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:04,152
You sit there in that...

419
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:07,740
...pathetic excuse of an office...

420
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,326
...reporting gossip...

421
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,458
...while under your very nose...

422
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:19,668
...evil...

423
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:22,838
...is doing its worst.

424
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:29,178
You have no spine, Clyde.

425
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:33,265
Not one ounce...

426
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:35,184
...of morality.

427
00:34:36,352 --> 00:34:37,686
Christ!

428
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:40,189
Even common sense.

429
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:44,234
Nuclear holocaust.

430
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:45,861
Murder.

431
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:48,322
Rape. Apartheid!

432
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,367
Why, these words mean nothing to you.

433
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,371
It's just a local newspaper.

434
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:58,499
It is local turpitude.

435
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:02,711
You are a failure, Clyde!
You should be strung up...

436
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,131
...along with that son of a bitch
who bought that house!

437
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,887
Call the nurse!

438
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,064
I am in pain!

439
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:24,400
- Then take the pill.
- I don't want to.

440
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:27,070
I'm not going to force it on you.

441
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,281
Is it Alzheimer's?

442
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:34,911
No. It's the bone marrow.
When a bone breaks...

443
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:39,749
...bits of fat get in the bloodstream
and the blood vessels of the brain.

444
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,668
It affects the behavior.

445
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:46,172
She's hysterical. She says things that
I don't know where they're coming from.

446
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,715
It's bone marrow?

447
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:52,262
Yes. She'll be very upset.
She'll say terrible things.

448
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:54,597
She may even be paranoid.

449
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:58,142
It is perfectly normal. It will pass.

450
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:18,289
What's happening to me, Clyde?

451
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,249
It's all right, sweetheart.

452
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,797
I open my mouth and
the strangest things come out.

453
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:33,762
You've had a hard time
and you're tired. Try to sleep.

454
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:50,487
Something is inside me, Clyde.

455
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,534
Something is crawling inside me.

456
00:36:57,037 --> 00:36:58,287
I can feel it.

457
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,830
Something evil.

458
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,833
It's almost here.

459
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:05,127
Hi.

460
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:07,755
You!

461
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:09,673
In there!

462
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:07,983
Jane.

463
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:09,901
At last we meet.

464
00:38:10,736 --> 00:38:12,404
Daryl Van Horne.

465
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:26,210
Cream and sugar?

466
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,712
Sugar.

467
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:30,756
- One lump or two?
- Four.

468
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,926
- Sweet tooth.
- Sweet everything.

469
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:38,264
I'm a sugar junkie.
Sugar, chocolate, Coca-Cola...

470
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:42,768
Uncontrollable appetite.
In every department.

471
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,897
That's not good for you.

472
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:53,279
It doesn't bother me.

473
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:57,116
I have a supernatural constitution.
It's genetic.

474
00:38:57,743 --> 00:39:00,578
I don't hold on
this health consciousness shit.

475
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:02,413
Pardon the language.

476
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:04,373
I see guys, 60...

477
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,959
...70, breaking their balls...

478
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:09,962
...to stay fit. What for?

479
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:13,257
When I die, I want to be sick,
not healthy.

480
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,969
I suppose that's one way
of looking at it.

481
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,433
Do I make you nervous?

482
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:22,851
Yes, you do.

483
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:25,812
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

484
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,815
Truth is best.

485
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,485
Yes, that's so true.

486
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:45,665
So what brings you to Eastwick?

487
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:50,837
We're going to have
a polite conversation.

488
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,297
I'm sorry.

489
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:54,132
No, I don't mind.

490
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,969
I came to Eastwick
because I was drawn here.

491
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:01,681
I needed a place to settle down and...

492
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,643
...I liked the house.

493
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:07,145
It has a history.

494
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:09,523
Rubbish.

495
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,358
No, it's true.

496
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,195
They say they used
to burn witches there.

497
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:18,365
Hocus-pocus.

498
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:21,201
The entire witchcraft scare...

499
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:26,165
...as far back as the 14th century,
was started by the medical profession.

500
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,959
That's right.

501
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:31,796
They were trying to get midwives
out of the child-birthing business.

502
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:36,717
That's what most of the women
they burned were. Midwives.

503
00:40:37,344 --> 00:40:38,511
Is that true?

504
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,222
You better believe it.

505
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,726
Just another example of
male-dominated professional society...

506
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:50,231
...exploiting females
for their own selfish purposes.

507
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:53,693
Men are such cocksuckers, aren't they?

508
00:40:56,738 --> 00:40:59,740
You don't have to answer that.
It's true.

509
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,618
Their dicks get limp...

510
00:41:02,786 --> 00:41:05,830
...when confronted by a powerful woman,
so what do they do?

511
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:08,916
Call them witches.
Burn them, torture them...

512
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,753
...until every woman is afraid.
Afraid of herself...

513
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,756
...afraid of men.

514
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,925
And all for what?

515
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:21,596
Fear of losing their hard-on.

516
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:27,853
Let's play some music.

517
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:41,408
Mm.

518
00:42:05,308 --> 00:42:07,309
You play beautifully.

519
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:10,312
Nothing compared to you.

520
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:12,481
You're an artist.

521
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:13,982
Intonation.

522
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,652
Vibrato. Stretch.

523
00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:20,155
You think I'm crazy, but I know music.

524
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,450
It's the one thing that makes me humble.

525
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:27,120
Not prissy? Our leader says
my intonation is prissy.

526
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:29,248
You have precision.

527
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,170
Precision is not prissy.
Precision is the foundation of passion.

528
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:39,007
Passion without precision? Chaos.

529
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,136
Look at your thumb.
Your sublime thumb position.

530
00:42:43,346 --> 00:42:45,681
You really keep the pressure on.

531
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:48,183
Most men can't, but you...

532
00:42:48,768 --> 00:42:51,603
You have the most beautiful callus.

533
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:54,356
This hand.

534
00:42:56,025 --> 00:42:59,528
This is your failure.
Your bowing sucks.

535
00:43:01,364 --> 00:43:03,031
My bowing? Why?

536
00:43:05,994 --> 00:43:09,997
Your spiccato sounds like marcato.
Your legato like détaché.

537
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:14,710
You kill the passion. Let it go.
Why are you holding back?

538
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:17,504
These aren't just notes
you're playing...

539
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:20,549
...they're phrases. Human outcries.

540
00:43:20,717 --> 00:43:23,552
I understand that! And I practice!

541
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,179
I practice until my fingers bleed!

542
00:43:27,223 --> 00:43:28,849
I know.

543
00:43:29,058 --> 00:43:32,227
It's the sixteenth notes in the allegro.
I can't do it!

544
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:34,062
Yes, you can.

545
00:43:35,232 --> 00:43:36,858
It's no good.

546
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:42,071
I don't have it.

547
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:43,573
I can't do it.

548
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,743
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't, I can't.

549
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:53,416
Trust me.

550
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:55,710
Trust me.

551
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:12,268
Try.

552
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:14,729
Let it go. Don't be afraid.

553
00:44:14,897 --> 00:44:17,857
You have great passion in you.
Let it out.

554
00:44:18,442 --> 00:44:20,276
I can take it.

555
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:22,111
I want it.

556
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:35,625
Yes.

557
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,630
Yes, that's it.

558
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:45,135
Relax. Just breathe into it.

559
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,472
Don't tighten up. That's it.

560
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:51,433
Feel it. Hold it. Love it.

561
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,310
That's it, yes.

562
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:55,104
Yes, that's right. Now!

563
00:45:03,947 --> 00:45:06,115
That's right. Do you feel that?

564
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:09,034
Let it wash over you.
Let it tickle you.

565
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:27,989
Did you miss me?

566
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:30,158
- Yes.
- Good. I missed you too.

567
00:46:30,326 --> 00:46:31,910
- Like my new top?
- Yeah, it's cute.

568
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:34,037
Do you want to listen to some tapes?

569
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,917
Alex! Yoo-hoo.

570
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:40,919
I'm out here!

571
00:46:43,255 --> 00:46:44,798
- Let's go.
- What is that?

572
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:49,094
We're going to be late.
Carol, the number is on the fridge!

573
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,932
- But you're not dressed.
I'm not naked.

574
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:57,394
- I don't believe it!
- Neither do I!

575
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,772
But I swear to God,
I couldn't walk for two days.

576
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:05,236
His penis is amazing.
It bends the wrong way.

577
00:47:05,403 --> 00:47:07,488
The wrong...? Wait a minute!

578
00:47:07,948 --> 00:47:09,615
It bends like that!

579
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:12,243
- You're terrible.
- No, I'm fabulous.

580
00:47:13,453 --> 00:47:15,663
But just because you went
to bed with him...

581
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:18,958
No, it's not just that!
It's like he knows me.

582
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:23,254
He knows everything!
I can't wait for you to meet him.

583
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:27,299
And I can't wait for Jane to meet him!
Jane will love him!

584
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:35,683
Jane?

585
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:37,101
Is that you?

586
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:40,104
Sukie. Alexandra.

587
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:42,982
Did you come to fix the plumbing?

588
00:47:43,275 --> 00:47:46,527
I didn't have time to change.
What's your excuse?

589
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:48,697
I don't need any. I was invited.

590
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:49,990
So was I.

591
00:47:50,157 --> 00:47:51,491
Hello!

592
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:53,660
Mm. Darling!

593
00:47:53,828 --> 00:47:54,953
There you are.

594
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:56,663
Are we late?
- Not at all.

595
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:58,331
Weren't we playing singles?

596
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:00,584
- You don't play tennis.
I do now.

597
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:03,837
Sukie. At last we meet.

598
00:48:04,505 --> 00:48:06,590
Hi. Hello. How are you?

599
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:08,508
Let me...

600
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:11,845
...look at those eyes of yours.

601
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,849
You are a fertile creature, aren't you?

602
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:17,350
Thank you, I think.

603
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:21,187
I'm reading that rag of a newspaper.
You are a genius.

604
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:24,691
Wasted. Pearls before swine.

605
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:30,530
When are we going to do our interview?
I love interviews.

606
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:33,158
- They're so intimate.
- Anytime you say.

607
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:37,329
Just the two of us,
banging away, head to head.

608
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:40,040
Yes, yes.

609
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:41,458
But not today.

610
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:44,544
Today is for tennis.
Are you ready, ladies?

611
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:54,388
What a day!

612
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,893
Is that your perfume?

613
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,533
Double fault!

614
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,579
I'm not blind or deaf!
You don't have to shout!

615
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,540
We're all good friends.
Let's play fair.

616
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,378
I always play fair, okay?
Love-forty, Jane.

617
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,421
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

618
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,132
- What do you mean?
- Don't let them rattle you.

619
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,927
They're just trying to get you.
Let's go.

620
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,108
Sorry, darling. Lost my head.

621
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,778
Fault.

622
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,874
Ow!

623
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,811
I've got it! I've got it!

624
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,942
It's not coming down.

625
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,835
Come on.

626
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,337
Our game. Sukie serves.

627
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,334
Stop!

628
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,583
Good going, Daryl.

629
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:18,095
Jane!

630
00:52:53,756 --> 00:52:55,215
Strong drink. What is it?

631
00:52:55,383 --> 00:52:58,260
Rum... vodka...

632
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:00,137
...brandy...

633
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:01,638
...acid.

634
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,975
I'm only kidding.

635
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,186
I don't mind.
Drugs have no effect on me.

636
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,480
- Really?
- Neither does alcohol.

637
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,650
It's true. It's boring, but it's true.

638
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:20,283
Are you going to seduce me too?

639
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:23,161
Yes.

640
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:26,456
How?

641
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:30,460
I don't know.

642
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:35,340
I should warn you. I get pregnant.

643
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:39,677
I get pregnant all the time.
At the drop of a hat.

644
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:42,138
I could borrow your toothbrush
and get pregnant.

645
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:45,016
I'll keep that in mind.

646
00:53:47,353 --> 00:53:48,770
That doesn't bother you?

647
00:53:50,064 --> 00:53:51,314
No.

648
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:55,860
You're not like other men.

649
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:58,321
I'm not.

650
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:03,034
Most men, well, my husband,
try to keep everything under control...

651
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:05,703
...pretend everything is normal.

652
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:10,041
Always rational,
always an explanation for everything.

653
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:15,046
Men need that, don't they?
To feel everything is solid.

654
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:18,007
And the world just isn't like that.

655
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,386
Certainly not with you three around.

656
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:27,141
I don't think...

657
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:42,031
We're not so different from other women.

658
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,409
Women are more natural, right?

659
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:48,246
And nature is crazy,
no matter what science says.

660
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,417
So I don't mind.

661
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,756
I don't mind when peculiar things
happen. It's natural...

662
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:01,634
...because the world
is a peculiar place.

663
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:04,429
And you're a very peculiar person.

664
00:55:05,723 --> 00:55:06,848
Thank you.

665
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:11,562
I would love to be a woman.

666
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,231
You would? Really? Why?

667
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:18,110
Just look what you can do
with your bodies.

668
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:20,779
Make babies and...

669
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:24,450
...make milk to feed the babies.

670
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:29,455
If I could do that...

671
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,292
Who are you, really?

672
00:55:35,962 --> 00:55:38,297
Anybody you want me to be.

673
00:58:13,788 --> 00:58:16,123
Look at what they can do.

674
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:19,627
These are human beings.

675
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:33,975
When you're a kid
and don't understand anything...

676
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:37,479
...you think when you grow up
it will all make sense.

677
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,941
Then when you grow up,
you keep waiting for the day.

678
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:42,901
You think it ever happens?

679
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:49,574
It starts when you open your eyes and
realize what the future has in store for you.

680
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,162
And what do you see
when you open your eyes?

681
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,500
Well...

682
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:01,378
It's a short life, isn't it?

683
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:05,924
Sometimes I look in the mirror
and I see everything...

684
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:08,051
...disintegrating faster and faster.

685
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,725
I always see snakes.

686
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,061
Hundreds of them.

687
00:59:18,562 --> 00:59:21,064
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

688
00:59:21,399 --> 00:59:23,734
Then I'm just not there anymore.

689
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,412
Well, I don't mind that it's a short life
or growing old or disappearing.

690
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,083
It's the pain that scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

691
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:41,585
...so much pain.

692
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:45,673
Yeah, well...

693
00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:50,094
We don't deal the deck
down here, we just...

694
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:52,596
...play the percentages.

695
01:00:39,312 --> 01:00:47,319
Whores.

696
01:00:48,446 --> 01:00:49,738
What?

697
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:52,616
Whores!

698
01:00:55,036 --> 01:00:57,454
- Whores.
- Sit down, sit down.

699
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,498
Look around you.

700
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:03,168
Look around you.
Do you see what's happening?

701
01:01:04,003 --> 01:01:05,504
In our town.

702
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:08,256
In our very homes!

703
01:01:12,011 --> 01:01:14,846
You know who I'm talking about.
You know!

704
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:19,017
You know what's going on in that house!
Vice!

705
01:01:19,268 --> 01:01:20,519
Perversions!

706
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,687
Shamelessness!

707
01:01:23,272 --> 01:01:24,773
Cavorting...

708
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:27,150
...with that devil!

709
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:29,319
She's fine. She's sick.

710
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:34,033
No! Drugs! Drugs are next.

711
01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:35,701
Murder!

712
01:01:36,203 --> 01:01:37,537
Rape!

713
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:40,289
Incest!

714
01:01:40,707 --> 01:01:42,375
Spanish flies!

715
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:45,211
Dildos! Anal intercourse!

716
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:50,383
Listen to me!

717
01:01:51,552 --> 01:01:53,177
- Please.
- Sorry!

718
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:13,239
Let's go home, Felicia.

719
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:15,741
You employ one of them, Clyde.

720
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:17,827
That's nobody's business.

721
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:22,707
Oh-ho. It is everybody's business!

722
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,003
You know, once there was a paradise.

723
01:02:27,671 --> 01:02:30,590
Then a serpent came into that garden.

724
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:33,760
For Christ's sake, Felicia,
would you stop?

725
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:38,265
Oh, Clyde.

726
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:41,768
I have nothing against a good fuck.

727
01:02:43,438 --> 01:02:45,689
But there is danger here.

728
01:02:47,775 --> 01:02:50,777
Somebody has to do something about it.

729
01:03:21,142 --> 01:03:22,476
Okay, stop.

730
01:03:22,977 --> 01:03:24,645
Stop! Stop.

731
01:03:25,772 --> 01:03:27,105
Um...

732
01:03:29,817 --> 01:03:31,485
Let's get rid of the music.

733
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:37,325
Throw it away! Get rid of it.
Let's get rid of the music.

734
01:03:37,493 --> 01:03:39,661
That's it! Right. Okay, now...

735
01:03:39,828 --> 01:03:42,497
I want you all to close your eyes.

736
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,000
Take a deep breath.

737
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,337
Let it all out.

738
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,841
Now pick up your instrument...

739
01:03:55,427 --> 01:03:57,595
...and when I count to four...

740
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:00,807
...we'll play the shit
out of this thing.

741
01:04:02,393 --> 01:04:08,898
One, two, three, four.

742
01:04:12,027 --> 01:04:14,195
That's it, just relax.

743
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:17,865
Take it easy. Good.

744
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:20,535
Nice!

745
01:04:21,537 --> 01:04:22,870
Smile.

746
01:04:23,205 --> 01:04:25,540
Come on, smile, Martha.

747
01:04:29,211 --> 01:04:32,630
That's it, this is fun.
Come on, this is easy.

748
01:04:32,965 --> 01:04:36,384
Easy-peasy. That's it, that's it. Good.

749
01:04:38,053 --> 01:04:41,640
Just let it flow over you. Good.

750
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:46,895
Let it tickle you now.

751
01:04:48,189 --> 01:04:51,525
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

752
01:04:51,735 --> 01:04:54,236
Good! You've got it now. Come on!

753
01:04:54,654 --> 01:04:57,615
Go with it, it's yours! Come on!

754
01:04:57,824 --> 01:05:00,200
Good! Yes!

755
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:06,040
See? You can do it. That's it.
You're doing great. Flow with it.

756
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:09,376
That's it, yes!

757
01:05:09,753 --> 01:05:13,088
These aren't phrases,
these are human outcries!

758
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:42,451
Double-double chocolate.
These are fabulous.

759
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:56,757
Excuse me.

760
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:19,738
Are you buying the paper or not?

761
01:06:20,865 --> 01:06:22,825
- Um...
- Slut.

762
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:26,245
What did you say?

763
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:27,830
You heard her.

764
01:06:40,885 --> 01:06:42,678
Did you see her socks?

765
01:06:43,513 --> 01:06:45,848
She's not wearing a bra.

766
01:06:47,268 --> 01:06:48,893
How could you do this?

767
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:51,646
We didn't use any names
except for Van Horne.

768
01:06:51,814 --> 01:06:53,773
You don't know what goes on there.

769
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:56,735
The whole town is talking
about you and your friends.

770
01:06:56,902 --> 01:06:59,195
This is so unfair. It's also untrue.

771
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:01,239
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

772
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:04,951
He filled in the wetlands
and ruined it for the birds.

773
01:07:05,202 --> 01:07:08,413
He altered the landmark building...

774
01:07:08,581 --> 01:07:11,166
...and the town is suing him
for $2 million.

775
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,460
How can you do this to me?

776
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:17,046
I work very hard and you know
I'm a good writer.

777
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:18,882
All right, Sukie, all right.

778
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:20,508
- What?
- Look, look.

779
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:24,554
I don't own the newspaper, you know.

780
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,560
It's Felicia, isn't it?

781
01:07:31,145 --> 01:07:32,312
She's a...

782
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:34,773
...very sick woman.

783
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:39,402
She's having a very bad time.
And I don't know what to do.

784
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:42,405
I want her to see a doctor.

785
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:46,409
Well, not a doctor, you know,
but a... doctor.

786
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:54,960
Clyde.

787
01:07:57,923 --> 01:08:00,424
We went to high school together.

788
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,844
She was a catch.

789
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:10,518
Ever since the accident, she just
hasn't been the same. And now...

790
01:08:15,774 --> 01:08:17,608
I'm so sorry, Clyde.

791
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:29,203
What am I doing?

792
01:08:29,621 --> 01:08:31,038
Firing me.

793
01:08:36,628 --> 01:08:39,296
All these terrible things she says...

794
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:43,384
...they're not true, are they?

795
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:49,181
We should stop seeing each other.

796
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:52,309
- Oh, let's not overreact.
- Yes, let's not overreact.

797
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:55,063
- I think we should.
- It's a small town, Daryl.

798
01:08:55,314 --> 01:08:58,275
We haven't done anything.
Why stop seeing each other?

799
01:08:58,442 --> 01:09:00,277
Clyde says that Felicia has visions.

800
01:09:00,444 --> 01:09:01,862
Why is it always women
who have visions?

801
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:04,072
She sees the devil here in Eastwick.

802
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:07,492
If you were the devil,
would you come to Eastwick?

803
01:09:07,827 --> 01:09:10,078
Oh, I don't know.

804
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,288
Poor Felicia.

805
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:15,125
Poor Felicia? She talked
to all of my students' mothers.

806
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:17,043
I had 12 cancellations this week.

807
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:19,713
People tell Carol her mother is a dyke.

808
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:21,590
You're being sued for millions.

809
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:23,508
That is inconvenient.

810
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,094
She's not kidding about
her medieval morality.

811
01:09:26,846 --> 01:09:29,848
I think Sukie is right.
Maybe we should stop.

812
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:31,391
Maybe she should stop.

813
01:09:31,559 --> 01:09:33,935
You can't be serious.
We're a family.

814
01:09:34,186 --> 01:09:37,022
Just for a while
until things settle down.

815
01:09:39,692 --> 01:09:41,735
Don't let her get to you.

816
01:09:42,028 --> 01:09:43,528
Have a cherry.

817
01:09:54,498 --> 01:09:58,210
They are selling pornography
at Schyler's News Shop.

818
01:09:59,379 --> 01:10:01,881
In the open. On the shelves.

819
01:10:02,215 --> 01:10:04,550
Children are looking at this...

820
01:10:07,554 --> 01:10:09,388
It's in broad daylight.

821
01:10:10,223 --> 01:10:13,059
I can't understand one word
you're saying. Not one!

822
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,561
They're standing in line...

823
01:10:22,903 --> 01:10:24,695
Filth in broad daylight.

824
01:10:24,863 --> 01:10:26,447
Right.

825
01:10:35,582 --> 01:10:37,458
She made a scene at Schyler's.

826
01:10:37,626 --> 01:10:40,920
Grabbing magazines from kids
and chasing them.

827
01:10:41,588 --> 01:10:45,341
She's in pain. Clyde too.
He started drinking again.

828
01:10:45,592 --> 01:10:48,636
She's twisted. Getting to me
through my kid is sick.

829
01:10:48,804 --> 01:10:51,806
- We could help.
- By putting her out of her misery.

830
01:10:51,974 --> 01:10:54,558
Please.
They're lucky to have each other.

831
01:10:54,726 --> 01:10:58,104
If they don't appreciate that,
I have no sympathy.

832
01:10:58,605 --> 01:11:01,358
Easy for you to say.
You don't have kids or a family.

833
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,946
You're my family.
I don't want to lose it.

834
01:11:07,115 --> 01:11:09,950
I just can't stand to see you upset.

835
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:13,620
You don't know what it does to me.

836
01:11:14,956 --> 01:11:16,957
I wish she would just go away.

837
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:20,961
Have another cherry.

838
01:11:40,481 --> 01:11:42,649
He's trying to get inside me.

839
01:11:43,818 --> 01:11:45,402
He's trying to use me.

840
01:11:46,821 --> 01:11:49,156
And he's using these women too.

841
01:11:50,992 --> 01:11:53,326
He wants to take our goodness.

842
01:11:58,499 --> 01:12:00,751
He wants to get inside me.

843
01:12:02,838 --> 01:12:04,505
Just like a man.

844
01:12:05,424 --> 01:12:07,091
Tickle, tickle, diddle, diddle.

845
01:12:12,681 --> 01:12:16,851
God made us in the image of goodness.
Look what we've become.

846
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:22,690
Animals gone mad...

847
01:12:23,442 --> 01:12:26,444
...devouring the earth and each other.

848
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,615
Eat, eat, eat, eat!

849
01:12:34,369 --> 01:12:36,621
Felicia, calm down.

850
01:12:46,215 --> 01:12:48,049
I know who he is, Clyde.

851
01:12:49,551 --> 01:12:51,219
Have another cherry.

852
01:13:04,525 --> 01:13:06,735
What have you been eating?

853
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,404
Those poor women.

854
01:13:09,864 --> 01:13:11,573
I have to warn them.

855
01:13:18,414 --> 01:13:20,415
He'll propagate, Clyde.

856
01:13:22,418 --> 01:13:24,586
He will increase his number.

857
01:13:27,382 --> 01:13:30,425
Those women are going to bear him sons.

858
01:13:31,761 --> 01:13:35,848
He's going to take their love
and destroy the earth with it.

859
01:13:56,619 --> 01:13:58,453
Let's call it a day.

860
01:15:19,704 --> 01:15:22,164
- I don't believe it.
- I know.

861
01:15:24,209 --> 01:15:26,377
I know him. He couldn't do this.

862
01:15:27,045 --> 01:15:29,630
Alex, don't you get it? God!

863
01:15:29,798 --> 01:15:30,923
Get what?

864
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:32,216
Us!

865
01:15:33,385 --> 01:15:35,386
Last night, all that talk.

866
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:37,471
Those were just words.

867
01:15:37,722 --> 01:15:40,724
They make things happen.
We make things happen.

868
01:15:40,976 --> 01:15:43,352
- We had nothing to do with this.
- Yes, we do!

869
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,979
We should talk to Daryl.

870
01:15:45,146 --> 01:15:47,982
Why? Why do we have to do
everything Daryl says?

871
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:49,441
She's right.

872
01:15:49,609 --> 01:15:52,403
Some man comes along
and nothing else matters!

873
01:15:52,737 --> 01:15:54,571
You are so dumb, Jane.

874
01:15:54,906 --> 01:15:58,158
- This is about us, not Daryl.
- Let's call him.

875
01:15:58,326 --> 01:16:01,036
Can't you stop thinking
from between your legs?

876
01:16:01,204 --> 01:16:02,496
You bitch!

877
01:16:02,664 --> 01:16:03,998
Alex, don't.

878
01:16:04,165 --> 01:16:06,041
- Shut up, Sukie!
- Will you get off of her?

879
01:16:50,046 --> 01:16:51,796
Anybody call?

880
01:17:36,675 --> 01:17:38,927
Hello?
- Hi.

881
01:17:39,678 --> 01:17:42,680
- Daryl?
- Yeah. Remember me?

882
01:17:43,891 --> 01:17:44,933
How are you?

883
01:17:47,019 --> 01:17:49,854
I'm hanging in there.
What do you want?

884
01:17:51,023 --> 01:17:55,276
Nothing. I just called
to see how you are, you know?

885
01:17:56,028 --> 01:17:58,363
See how things were going.

886
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:00,532
I'm fine.

887
01:18:04,703 --> 01:18:08,915
I wanted to see how you were,
you know?

888
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,876
Make sure you were okay.

889
01:18:12,545 --> 01:18:16,548
Make sure you didn't have any
uncontrollable desire to see me.

890
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:22,430
In case you were missing me and
you were too embarrassed to call...

891
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:24,181
...I called first.

892
01:18:24,349 --> 01:18:28,018
Then you could feel superior
and see me at the same time.

893
01:18:29,813 --> 01:18:31,313
What do you say?

894
01:18:32,315 --> 01:18:35,651
I don't feel superior. I feel terrible.

895
01:18:37,362 --> 01:18:39,363
I feel terrible too.

896
01:18:39,698 --> 01:18:42,992
If we both feel terrible,
can't we do something about it?

897
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,660
What's going on here?

898
01:18:44,828 --> 01:18:47,830
Nobody's calling me.
Nobody's coming to see me.

899
01:18:47,998 --> 01:18:49,874
- No...
- I just think we need some time.

900
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:51,542
We need a little time, okay?

901
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:55,212
No, it's not okay, Alex.
I don't understand.

902
01:18:55,547 --> 01:18:58,299
Somebody died, Daryl.
Felicia is dead.

903
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:01,177
Yeah, well...

904
01:19:02,053 --> 01:19:05,556
People die all the time.
She was in a bad way.

905
01:19:05,724 --> 01:19:07,391
It has nothing to do with us.

906
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:12,646
I can't talk to you.
Don't call me, because I...

907
01:19:12,898 --> 01:19:14,148
Don't hang up!

908
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,818
Alex, don't do this! This is not fair!

909
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:00,278
Happy birthday!

910
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:03,114
It's not my birthday.

911
01:20:04,116 --> 01:20:05,158
It isn't?

912
01:20:06,285 --> 01:20:08,161
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

913
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,958
Well, what the hell.

914
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,961
Happy whatever day.

915
01:20:16,295 --> 01:20:18,463
These are my favorite fruit.

916
01:20:18,965 --> 01:20:21,049
I can't accept those, Daryl.

917
01:20:27,974 --> 01:20:30,309
I'm freezing my nuts off out here.

918
01:20:30,561 --> 01:20:33,145
I can't ask you in, I'm sorry.

919
01:20:34,982 --> 01:20:38,734
Not even for a little while?
Just to dry off.

920
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,071
Talk to the kids maybe.

921
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:45,324
No. You have to go away.

922
01:20:45,993 --> 01:20:49,662
You have to go away now.
I can't see you or talk to you.

923
01:20:49,997 --> 01:20:52,331
I'm sorry, Daryl, but I can't!

924
01:21:31,204 --> 01:21:32,372
Jane?

925
01:21:43,926 --> 01:21:45,510
Hello.

926
01:21:48,598 --> 01:21:50,057
Give me that.

927
01:22:11,871 --> 01:22:13,830
Mrs. Spofford?
- What's wrong with me?

928
01:22:13,998 --> 01:22:17,084
Nothing. You're pregnant.

929
01:22:21,255 --> 01:22:22,923
Three or four weeks.

930
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,094
Are you sure?

931
01:22:29,889 --> 01:22:33,725
I thought something was really wrong.
Are you sure?

932
01:22:34,102 --> 01:22:35,978
Do you need a doctor?
We could recommend...

933
01:22:36,146 --> 01:22:37,730
No, no, no, I... No.

934
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:39,607
Thank you so much.

935
01:22:40,609 --> 01:22:42,777
Mrs. Spofford, your clothes.

936
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:58,376
Do you think it ever happens?

937
01:22:59,461 --> 01:23:01,129
It starts when you open your eyes...

938
01:23:01,296 --> 01:23:03,798
...and realize what the future
has in store for you.

939
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:06,843
And what do you see
when you open your eyes?

940
01:23:09,805 --> 01:23:11,139
Well, short life.

941
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,307
I want to surprise him.

942
01:23:25,988 --> 01:23:28,322
It's a short life, isn't it?

943
01:23:29,575 --> 01:23:32,493
I look in the mirror
and see everything...

944
01:23:33,162 --> 01:23:35,663
...disintegrating faster and faster.

945
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:40,169
It's a short life, isn't it?

946
01:23:41,254 --> 01:23:44,506
I look in the mirror
and see everything...

947
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:47,009
...disintegrating faster and faster.

948
01:24:23,546 --> 01:24:26,215
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

949
01:24:26,549 --> 01:24:28,550
Then I'm just not there anymore.

950
01:24:28,885 --> 01:24:30,052
Alex!

951
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,931
I always see snakes.

952
01:24:35,225 --> 01:24:37,226
Hundreds of them.

953
01:24:37,727 --> 01:24:41,980
They crawl all over me and I disappear.
Then I'm just not there.

954
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,111
Alex, it's me.

955
01:25:29,947 --> 01:25:33,783
It's me. Just let it go. Let it go!
Look at me!

956
01:25:34,577 --> 01:25:38,705
Let it go. That's it. Just let it go.

957
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:42,625
Pain scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

958
01:25:43,794 --> 01:25:45,295
...so much pain.

959
01:25:57,559 --> 01:25:59,977
I don't know why there has to be...

960
01:26:00,395 --> 01:26:02,062
...so much pain.

961
01:27:13,052 --> 01:27:14,719
Can we talk?

962
01:27:17,556 --> 01:27:21,309
She's still hemorrhaging.
We slowed it down, but...

963
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,686
Will she be all right?

964
01:27:22,853 --> 01:27:25,981
If we knew what was wrong,
we'd have a chance.

965
01:27:26,232 --> 01:27:27,482
Can we see her?

966
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:31,236
She's in a lot of pain.
I can't give her anything...

967
01:27:31,404 --> 01:27:33,905
...until we know what
we're dealing with.

968
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:37,575
Okay. Go ahead.

969
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:44,916
Sweetheart,
the doctor says you'll be fine.

970
01:27:46,585 --> 01:27:48,920
He doesn't know what's going on.

971
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,677
Easy.

972
01:27:57,931 --> 01:27:59,515
I'm pregnant.

973
01:28:02,853 --> 01:28:04,437
So am I.

974
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:10,860
Alex?

975
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:14,780
That son of a bitch.

976
01:28:19,202 --> 01:28:21,787
Make him stop, please.
Make him stop.

977
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:23,998
I will, honey. I will.

978
01:28:39,473 --> 01:28:41,640
Back off, Fidel!

979
01:28:42,392 --> 01:28:45,019
Daryl? Daryl!

980
01:28:45,437 --> 01:28:49,482
Tara Flavor, come on down!

981
01:28:55,781 --> 01:28:57,490
Daryl?

982
01:28:57,824 --> 01:28:59,158
Alex?

983
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:02,536
- Don't "Alex" me.
- What a nice surprise.

984
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:04,622
What the hell do you think you're doing?

985
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:07,416
I said, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

986
01:29:07,751 --> 01:29:09,418
A little housework.

987
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:14,840
I've been sending these shirts out,
but Jesus, they come back in pieces.

988
01:29:15,217 --> 01:29:16,842
Small town.

989
01:29:17,511 --> 01:29:19,178
Not enough Orientals.

990
01:29:19,346 --> 01:29:22,515
Fidel's all thumbs
with this kind of thing.

991
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:24,683
That just leaves me.

992
01:29:24,851 --> 01:29:28,145
I'm not talking about your damn laundry,
I'm talking about...

993
01:29:28,313 --> 01:29:30,356
...Sukie and Jane and me.

994
01:29:31,608 --> 01:29:36,529
Golly. You girls sure are having
a hard time, aren't you?

995
01:29:38,115 --> 01:29:39,782
Sukie is very ill.

996
01:29:42,661 --> 01:29:44,620
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

997
01:29:44,871 --> 01:29:46,622
Then do something about it!

998
01:29:47,124 --> 01:29:50,209
Me? What can I do about it?

999
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:52,920
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

1000
01:29:53,338 --> 01:29:54,922
It does, and you know it does!

1001
01:29:55,465 --> 01:29:57,007
No, I don't.

1002
01:29:58,135 --> 01:30:02,264
All I know is we were friends
and the next day I was shut out.

1003
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,141
That's all I know.

1004
01:30:04,934 --> 01:30:07,519
One minute I was the answer
to your prayers.

1005
01:30:07,687 --> 01:30:11,231
Five minutes later, you wouldn't
give me the time of the day.

1006
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:14,568
Sukie could die!
Don't you understand that?

1007
01:30:15,069 --> 01:30:18,572
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can. Don't lie to me.

1008
01:30:20,241 --> 01:30:22,075
You deserted me.

1009
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:24,619
We had a deal.

1010
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:26,746
- That's no reason...
- Yes, it is.

1011
01:30:27,248 --> 01:30:28,790
You pissed me off!

1012
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:31,084
Was I supposed to take it like a man?

1013
01:30:31,252 --> 01:30:32,544
I gave you everything I got!

1014
01:30:32,712 --> 01:30:35,922
I gave you more than anybody ever has,
and what do I get in exchange?

1015
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:38,341
A little thank you?
A little gratitude?

1016
01:30:38,593 --> 01:30:40,635
I get screwed!

1017
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:43,930
Oh, cut the crap!
What do you want from us?

1018
01:30:44,098 --> 01:30:47,100
I want somebody to do these shirts!

1019
01:30:47,768 --> 01:30:51,771
I want somebody to pay attention to me!
I want some respect!

1020
01:30:52,064 --> 01:30:55,567
I want somebody to take care
of me for a change!

1021
01:30:55,776 --> 01:30:57,986
Huh? How about that?

1022
01:30:58,279 --> 01:31:00,447
What do I want? Christ!

1023
01:31:01,282 --> 01:31:04,118
What does any man want?

1024
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,787
A little affection.

1025
01:31:07,539 --> 01:31:09,457
A little trust.

1026
01:31:11,126 --> 01:31:12,543
Goddamn it.

1027
01:31:13,003 --> 01:31:16,464
Everything I did, I did for you.

1028
01:31:21,887 --> 01:31:23,512
I was wrong.

1029
01:31:24,056 --> 01:31:25,389
Go ahead.

1030
01:31:25,724 --> 01:31:30,144
Go back to your miserable little life.
Fuck me if I care!

1031
01:31:30,562 --> 01:31:34,398
If that's what you want,
that's what you get.

1032
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,568
You are not the only three women
in the world.

1033
01:31:39,988 --> 01:31:41,989
You're hurting people, Daryl.

1034
01:31:43,575 --> 01:31:45,326
What you did for us was great.

1035
01:31:45,494 --> 01:31:48,079
But you can't use your power
to hurt people.

1036
01:31:49,831 --> 01:31:51,499
Don't you understand that?

1037
01:31:52,626 --> 01:31:54,043
No.

1038
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:58,005
I want my family back together,
that's all.

1039
01:31:59,174 --> 01:32:00,341
You...

1040
01:32:00,759 --> 01:32:02,343
...and Sukie...

1041
01:32:02,511 --> 01:32:04,178
...and Jane.

1042
01:32:05,014 --> 01:32:06,848
I couldn't hurt Sukie.

1043
01:32:07,058 --> 01:32:10,269
I couldn't hurt any of you.
How could I?

1044
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:12,187
I love you.

1045
01:32:12,355 --> 01:32:14,147
You don't know what love is.

1046
01:32:14,315 --> 01:32:16,942
I can learn.
You could teach me.

1047
01:32:17,151 --> 01:32:18,944
How hard can it be?

1048
01:32:20,405 --> 01:32:23,031
Oh, Alex, let's not fight.

1049
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:26,535
You can't win.
There's no way you can win.

1050
01:32:27,036 --> 01:32:30,163
There's nothing to go back to,
even if you could win.

1051
01:32:30,331 --> 01:32:31,957
Can't we just...

1052
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:35,043
...put this behind us and be friends?

1053
01:32:44,304 --> 01:32:45,721
There.

1054
01:32:46,222 --> 01:32:47,639
See?

1055
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:49,725
Isn't that nice?

1056
01:32:52,145 --> 01:32:53,603
Tell the truth.

1057
01:32:54,564 --> 01:32:57,399
You missed me a little bit, didn't you?

1058
01:32:59,902 --> 01:33:01,903
Yeah, I have.

1059
01:33:02,488 --> 01:33:06,408
So let's kiss and make it better.

1060
01:33:07,827 --> 01:33:10,330
Huh? What do you say?

1061
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:15,084
What are we going to do with you?

1062
01:33:22,051 --> 01:33:23,676
It stopped.

1063
01:34:21,277 --> 01:34:23,153
Darling, you look perfect.

1064
01:34:23,363 --> 01:34:25,114
Mm.

1065
01:34:34,582 --> 01:34:35,833
Hi.

1066
01:34:37,836 --> 01:34:39,211
You look gorgeous.

1067
01:34:39,379 --> 01:34:40,754
Thank you.

1068
01:34:40,922 --> 01:34:42,172
Feeling better?

1069
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:46,009
Much better now.
Everything's going to be much better now.

1070
01:35:32,141 --> 01:35:33,558
Fidel.

1071
01:35:33,726 --> 01:35:35,477
We're going to town.

1072
01:35:36,061 --> 01:35:41,024
The ladies have a craving
for bagels and ice cream.

1073
01:37:03,108 --> 01:37:05,109
Three pinches.

1074
01:37:13,076 --> 01:37:14,660
I'd like...

1075
01:37:14,911 --> 01:37:19,248
...a dozen bagels, a pound of gravlax and
what kind of ice cream do you have?

1076
01:37:19,499 --> 01:37:21,918
No ice cream. The freezer's broken.

1077
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,170
Ice cream.

1078
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:28,300
Um... Well, ahem,
I'll just take the bread and the fish.

1079
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:37,100
It doesn't look like him.

1080
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:40,061
It doesn't have to. We know who it is.

1081
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:43,440
He looks funny with no hair.

1082
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:44,858
It won't hurt him, will it?

1083
01:37:45,026 --> 01:37:48,194
- No. We just want to send him away.
- Jane, come on.

1084
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,619
No ice cream. Imagine that.

1085
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:59,873
I'll go see if I can't get some.
You go shopping.

1086
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:08,381
I said, "A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse. "

1087
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,383
"Somebody nice. "

1088
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,552
"Somebody you could talk to. "

1089
01:38:17,224 --> 01:38:18,892
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1090
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:22,062
I'd like some pistachio.
That is pistachio?

1091
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:30,613
And some chocolate-chocolate chip.

1092
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:36,118
Are you okay?
- No, my leg!

1093
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,038
Jesus Christ!

1094
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,790
What is it?

1095
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,253
What's the matter?

1096
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:50,466
Are you having a heart attack?

1097
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,123
Girls!

1098
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:25,292
Girls? What are you doing?

1099
01:39:28,131 --> 01:39:32,050
Girls! Girls! Please, don't!

1100
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:08,545
Elijah fled to the mount of God.

1101
01:40:08,838 --> 01:40:12,340
The Lord passed by and a great,
strong wind rent the mountains...

1102
01:40:12,508 --> 01:40:14,676
...and breaked in pieces
the rocks before the Lord...

1103
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:46,541
Sorry.

1104
01:40:47,376 --> 01:40:49,377
Just having a little trouble.

1105
01:40:50,087 --> 01:40:53,089
A little... trouble at home.

1106
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:56,718
A little domestic problem.

1107
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:08,396
Nothing to be alarmed at.

1108
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:15,111
Just a little female problem.

1109
01:41:30,253 --> 01:41:32,087
Don't pay any attention.

1110
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:34,632
It's a cheap trick.

1111
01:41:34,925 --> 01:41:38,261
Anybody can do it.
I taught it to them myself.

1112
01:41:39,304 --> 01:41:41,764
Ungrateful little bitches, aren't they?

1113
01:41:42,432 --> 01:41:45,768
I want to ask you something.
You all go to church.

1114
01:41:46,103 --> 01:41:52,525
Do you think God knew what he
was doing when he created woman?

1115
01:41:52,693 --> 01:41:54,986
No shit! I really want to know.

1116
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,447
Or do you think it was
one of his minor mistakes?

1117
01:41:58,657 --> 01:42:02,118
Like tidal waves! Earthquakes! Floods!

1118
01:42:03,662 --> 01:42:05,997
Do you think women are like that?

1119
01:42:23,307 --> 01:42:24,932
What's the matter?

1120
01:42:27,644 --> 01:42:30,313
You don't think God makes mistakes?

1121
01:42:32,482 --> 01:42:34,317
Of course he does.

1122
01:42:34,818 --> 01:42:36,986
We all make mistakes.

1123
01:42:39,657 --> 01:42:42,826
Of course, we make mistakes,
they call it evil.

1124
01:42:43,536 --> 01:42:48,498
When God makes mistakes,
they call it nature.

1125
01:42:51,336 --> 01:42:53,003
So what do you think?

1126
01:42:53,212 --> 01:42:56,048
Women. A mistake?

1127
01:42:56,883 --> 01:43:01,178
Or did he do it to us on purpose?

1128
01:43:01,346 --> 01:43:03,347
I really want to know!

1129
01:43:03,514 --> 01:43:07,059
If it's a mistake, maybe we can
do something about it!

1130
01:43:07,352 --> 01:43:09,186
Find a cure!

1131
01:43:10,521 --> 01:43:12,356
Invent a vaccine.

1132
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,486
Build up our immune systems.

1133
01:43:21,699 --> 01:43:25,285
Get a little exercise.

1134
01:43:27,038 --> 01:43:29,873
You know. Twenty pushups a day...

1135
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:34,878
...and you never have to be afflicted
with women, ever again!

1136
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:08,788
All right, that's it.

1137
01:44:09,415 --> 01:44:11,082
How do we know it worked?

1138
01:44:11,417 --> 01:44:13,751
I guess we just wait and see.

1139
01:44:15,254 --> 01:44:17,588
My God, look at this place.

1140
01:44:19,633 --> 01:44:21,509
- Just in case.
- Okay.

1141
01:45:36,961 --> 01:45:38,295
No!

1142
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:11,371
Here, here. Quick. Okay.

1143
01:48:01,984 --> 01:48:03,318
The doll.

1144
01:48:27,218 --> 01:48:29,552
Jane! Jane.

1145
01:48:32,515 --> 01:48:34,182
Jane, laugh!

1146
01:51:36,577 --> 01:51:38,077
Come here, you.

1147
01:51:43,041 --> 01:51:47,879
Come on, sweet pea, come on.

1148
01:51:48,046 --> 01:51:51,632
Come on, little mookie boy, come on.

1149
01:51:57,890 --> 01:52:00,641
What a big guy! Sweetheart.

1150
01:52:02,394 --> 01:52:05,563
Look at Fidel.
What does he have for you?

1151
01:52:26,919 --> 01:52:28,252
Janey, stop it.

1152
01:52:28,962 --> 01:52:30,254
What?

1153
01:52:30,589 --> 01:52:32,048
Just stop it.

1154
01:52:32,758 --> 01:52:34,800
I can think about him if I want to.

1155
01:52:34,968 --> 01:52:36,761
Not when we're all together.

1156
01:52:36,929 --> 01:52:38,888
I miss him. I can't help it.

1157
01:52:39,097 --> 01:52:41,015
I do, and so do you. Admit it.

1158
01:52:41,183 --> 01:52:42,767
Okay, we admit it.

1159
01:52:42,976 --> 01:52:44,644
Do you want him back?

1160
01:53:39,826 --> 01:53:41,326
Take it easy.

1161
01:53:41,494 --> 01:53:44,997
We don't want the whole household
in here, do we?

1162
01:53:45,498 --> 01:53:47,499
That's it. Good boys.

1163
01:53:47,709 --> 01:53:50,043
We're going to do just fine.

1164
01:53:51,879 --> 01:53:55,215
Come to Daddy and give me a big kiss.

1165
01:53:55,383 --> 01:53:58,635
Come on. Good boys. Come on.

1166
01:53:58,845 --> 01:54:00,887
Come to Daddy.

1167
01:54:01,055 --> 01:54:05,601
Coochie-coochie-coo.
That's it. Come on.

1168
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:08,020
Come on. Come on.

1169
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:17,530
Oh, ladies, come on.
