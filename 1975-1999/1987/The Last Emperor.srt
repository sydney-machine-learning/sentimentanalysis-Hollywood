1
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:14,194
<i>The war criminals will proceed
in orderly fashion...</i>

2
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:18,531
<i>to the main waiting room
and await instructions.</i>

3
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:22,827
<i>No talking. Obey the guards.</i>

4
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>War criminals must proceed
to the main waiting room.</i>

5
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:35,173
<i>Those caught talking
will be severely punished.</i>

6
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,305
The emperor.

7
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,892
Your Majesty.

8
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,936
What do they think they are doing?

9
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,021
Get up. It is dangerous.

10
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:36,109
Go back. Go back. Go!

11
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,778
Are you mad?
They could kill us all.

12
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,029
Go. Go.

13
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,232
Open the door!

14
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,443
Open the door!

15
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,529
Open the door!

16
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,032
Open the door!

17
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,855
Mama.

18
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,799
By the command of Her Imperial Majesty...

19
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,470
also called the Compassionate and the Blessed...

20
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,973
the Respectful and the Long-living...

21
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,809
the Empress Dowager commands...

22
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,853
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...

23
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,147
son of Prince Chun...

24
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,026
shall be transferred immediately...

25
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,028
to the Forbidden City...

26
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,447
and will remain in the Great Within...

27
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,325
awaiting Her Majesty's decision.

28
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,410
Respect this!

29
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,283
Ar Mo, I am giving you my son.

30
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,954
- My son is your son.
- Quick! Quick!

31
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,020
I want to go home.

32
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,482
No. Look at the Forbidden City.

33
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,413
Give him to me.

34
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,125
Ar Mo!

35
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,199
Pu Yi, come here.

36
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,842
How small you are.

37
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,053
Are you afraid of me?

38
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,347
Everyone is.

39
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,894
I am the Grand Empress Dowager.

40
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:33,067
And I have lived here
for a long, long time.

41
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:49,041
And they call me the old Buddha.

42
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,384
This is Peony.

43
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,220
Do you like her?

44
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,514
Men, you know...

45
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:07,935
are not allowed in the Forbidden City
after dark.

46
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,399
Even little men like you.

47
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,111
The only man who can live here...

48
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,697
is the emperor.

49
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,869
But the emperor is on high...

50
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:28,706
riding the dragon now.

51
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,377
He died today.

52
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,147
Longevity.

53
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:02,782
These other men...
They are not real men.

54
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,743
They are all eunuchs.

55
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:18,089
And now they are all
waiting for me to die.

56
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,132
That is why...

57
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,929
they are putting my bed
in the middle of the room...

58
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,057
under the black pearl.

59
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,521
Little Pu Yi...

60
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,402
I have decided...

61
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:44,824
that you will be the new Lord
of 10,000 Years.

62
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:51,872
You will be the Son of Heaven.

63
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,344
Are we going home, Papa?

64
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,332
Shh! Shh!

65
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,547
Shh. It will soon be over.

66
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,843
Look!

67
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,730
Look.

68
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,826
Cricket!

69
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,382
Cricket! Cricket!
Where's the cricket?

70
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,760
Ah, he is my friend, Your Majesty.

71
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,596
Safe and warm under my arm.

72
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,725
Kept me company
on the long journey here.

73
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,603
Ah. See?

74
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,525
He is kowtowing to Your Majesty.

75
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,945
Now he can be the emperor's cricket.

76
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,709
Your Majesty, this is the Forbidden City.

77
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,338
Look.

78
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,133
This little one
is Your Majesty's bedroom.

79
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,094
- This is where we are.
- Am I going home today?

80
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,555
Not today.

81
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,557
Not yet.

82
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,686
And here. Look.
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony...

83
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,771
where Your Majesty was crowned.

84
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:20,617
I give Your Majesty
the Gate of Marshovala.

85
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,537
I give you the Marshio Gate.

86
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,999
- The gate.
- Yes. Yes.

87
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,585
And the Palace of the Cloudless Heaven.

88
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,339
And... Yes.

89
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,633
Your Majesty,
your imperial bath is ready.

90
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,636
I don't like baths!

91
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:43,098
I don't like baths.
I don't like baths.

92
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,271
No bean curd today...

93
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,440
and no meat!

94
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,377
Is it true I can do anything I want?

95
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,504
Of course, Your Majesty.

96
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,506
Anything you want.

97
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,008
You are the Lord of 10,000 Years.

98
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,970
Oh! Oh, no!
Not in my face.

99
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,391
I'm the Son of Heaven!
I'm the Son of Heaven!

100
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,102
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

101
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,938
I am the Son of Heaven!

102
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,107
I am the Son of Heaven!

103
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,444
Ar Mo. I want to go home.

104
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,947
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

105
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:44,535
I want to go home, Ar Mo.
I want to go home.

106
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,348
Once upon a time...

107
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,476
there was a great tree...

108
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:13,105
and a great wind.

109
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,357
And when the tree fell...

110
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,526
the monkeys were scattered.

111
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,720
His soup is getting cold.

112
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,724
- Where am I?
- In the People's Republic of China.

113
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:59,067
- Why did you stop me?
- You are a criminal. You must be judged.

114
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,324
I repeat!

115
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,078
Prisoners going to their cells
will walk with their heads bowed.

116
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,080
Keep your eyes on the ground.

117
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,199
No looking forward or to the side.

118
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:59,127
The guards will give you directions
and tell you when to turn.

119
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,354
Pu Chieh.

120
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:43,005
Your guest is waiting to meet you,
Your Majesty.

121
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,553
Also, your mother has arrived.

122
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:54,725
You have not seen your mother
for many years, Your Majesty.

123
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,948
- He is so small.
- He is young, Your Majesty.

124
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,409
Go.

125
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,453
Go.

126
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,085
The emperor's brother,
His Excellency Pu Chieh.

127
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,147
Ar Mo.

128
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,330
How is the health
of His Majesty's mother?

129
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,083
It is better. Thank you.

130
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,752
How much His Majesty has grown.

131
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,634
My mother has not seen me
for seven years.

132
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,057
Do you remember my face?

133
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,392
No.

134
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:24,147
The night they came with the horses,
I knew it would be like this.

135
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:28,068
- My brother sees you every day.
- Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you.

136
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,153
He often talks about you.

137
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,989
We are all very proud of you.

138
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,200
The kite.

139
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,160
He chose this for you.

140
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,968
Papa!

141
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,093
They're turning away.

142
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:38,764
Of course. Ordinary people
are not allowed to look at the emperor.

143
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:43,518
- I'm too important.
- Is it true that you can do whatever you want?

144
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:47,731
Of course I can. If I am naughty,
someone else is punished.

145
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,733
One of them.

146
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,947
Stop!

147
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,033
The emperor will walk.

148
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,128
I have never met other children.

149
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:13,799
- Are they all like you?
- I've got three sisters and two friends.

150
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,301
If you come to our house,
you can play with us.

151
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,553
The emperor never leaves the palace.

152
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,932
We play games together!

153
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,934
I know a game too.

154
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,019
Run!

155
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,826
The ones on the boat
are the high consorts.

156
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,913
- High consorts?
- The wives of the emperor before me.

157
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,958
They say they're my mother,
but they're not. They're not!

158
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:35,750
Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow.

159
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,504
But this is ordinary yellow.

160
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,256
It is imperial yellow.

161
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,008
No, it is not.

162
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,678
We say it is.
Only the emperor can wear that yellow.

163
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,680
- Take it off.
- No!

164
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,058
- Take it off!
- No! And you're not the emperor anymore.

165
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:54,019
There is a new emperor now.

166
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:58,273
He has cut off his queue.
And instead of a camel, he has got a car.

167
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,234
What did you say?

168
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,319
You're not the emperor.

169
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:10,035
Liar!

170
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:13,329
- You're not the emperor anymore!
- Liar!

171
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,707
- Liar!
- You're not the--

172
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,794
Liar!

173
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,181
You're not the emperor.

174
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,966
- Liar!
- You're not the emperor!

175
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,052
How dare you!

176
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,348
You're not the emperor!

177
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,851
Please. No!

178
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,605
Your Majesty. Calm yourself.

179
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,816
- You're not the emperor!
- How dare you!

180
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:45,528
Oh, Your Majesty.
Calm yourself.

181
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,074
Am I the emperor or not?

182
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,619
Your Majesty will always be the emperor.

183
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,662
- You see?
- Prove it.

184
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,167
Big Foot.

185
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,672
Drink it.

186
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,509
Go on. Drink the green ink.

187
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,154
I will show you!

188
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:03,523
See? That is a car.
He's the president of the Republic.

189
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,585
Why is this wall here,
Lord Chamberlain?

190
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:11,257
It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed.

191
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,343
You are lying.

192
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,694
High Tutor, am I still the emperor?

193
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:36,241
You will always be the emperor
inside the Forbidden City...

194
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,910
but not outside.

195
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,995
I do not understand.

196
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,165
Outside China is now a republic...

197
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,251
with a president.

198
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,587
Where is Ar Mo?

199
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,174
Ar Mo.

200
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,073
You are all liars!

201
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,624
- Let me say good-bye!
- Hurry. Hurry.

202
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,631
He's my child!

203
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,693
Ar Mo?

204
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,778
Ar Mo?

205
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,708
I do not understand.

206
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,918
I do not understand.

207
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:15,715
Your Majesty is a big boy now.
He cannot have a wet nurse anymore.

208
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,800
It is much better like this.

209
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,011
Much healthier.

210
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,722
But she is not my wet nurse.

211
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:26,392
She is my butterfly.

212
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,698
Ar Mo!

213
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,452
Ar Mo!

214
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,460
Ar Mo!

215
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,130
Ar Mo!

216
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,257
Ar Mo!

217
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,343
Ar Mo!

218
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,556
Ar Mo!

219
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,814
Ar Mo!

220
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,154
This is the detention center...

221
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:04,866
of the Fushun Bureau
of Public Security.

222
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,618
And I am the governor.

223
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:11,539
During the war,
this was a Japanese prison.

224
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,833
Many of you may remember it...

225
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,961
because you worked with the Japanese.

226
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,464
You were responsible for building it...

227
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,300
and you filled it with innocent people.

228
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,177
How could this happen?

229
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,554
Why did you betray your country?

230
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,182
What turned you into war criminals?

231
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:33,144
We believe that men are born good.

232
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:39,066
We believe that the only way to change
is to discover the truth and look at it in the face.

233
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,945
That is why you are here.

234
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,782
You will begin by writing
the story of your lives...

235
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,160
and by confessing your crimes.

236
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:55,166
Your salvation will lie entirely
in the attitude you take.

237
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,670
I advise you to be frank and sincere.

238
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:04,717
Otherwise, things can still go
very badly for you.

239
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,703
<i>After a few years...</i>

240
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:36,249
<i>the Chinese Republic had become
as corrupt as the old empire.</i>

241
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:42,296
<i>It fell quickly into the hands
of ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats.</i>

242
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,675
<i>The era of the warlords had begun.</i>

243
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:50,721
<i>By May 1919, when I received my appointment,
China was in turmoil.</i>

244
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,767
May the new tutor present himself.

245
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:18,202
Your Imperial Highness, the new tutor.

246
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,374
Mr. Reginald Fleming Johnston.

247
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,794
How do you do, Mr. Johnston?

248
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,506
How do you do, Your Majesty?

249
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,310
Now we will go to school.

250
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,898
Your Majesty, in my country,
it would be usual to begin...

251
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:50,359
with some kind of an examination.

252
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,863
The emperor cannot be examined.

253
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,073
Well, that may have to change.

254
00:42:56,158 --> 00:43:00,494
But first Your Majesty might like
to ask me some questions.

255
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,083
Where are your ancestors buried?

256
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,169
In Scotland, Your Majesty.

257
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,299
But then, where's your skirt?

258
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:16,302
In your country, men wear short skirts,
do they not?

259
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:21,557
No, Your Majesty. Scotsmen do not wear skirts.
They wear kilts.

260
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,351
- Kilts?
- Kilts.

261
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:28,314
A matter of words, perhaps,
but words are important.

262
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,566
Why are words important?

263
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,738
If you cannot say what you mean, Your Majesty,
you will never mean what you say...

264
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:39,825
and a gentleman should always mean
what he says.

265
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,621
Ah, yes. A gentleman.

266
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,706
Are you a gentleman?

267
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,419
I would like to be a gentleman,
Your Majesty.

268
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:53,798
- I try to be.
- I am not a gentleman.

269
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,008
I'm not allowed to say what I mean.

270
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,552
They are always telling me
what to say.

271
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,224
Your Majesty is still very young.

272
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:10,397
I thought he might like to see
some English and American magazines.

273
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:14,068
I have just received them.

274
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,909
I know that you know that I know...

275
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,662
that you know that
that is a dialogue...

276
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,331
between Confucius and Chuang-Tsu.

277
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:32,169
Concerning respect, Your Majesty.

278
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,686
Who is this George Washington?

279
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,855
A famous American, Your Majesty.

280
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:55,025
A Revolutionary general.
The first American president.

281
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,486
Ah. Like Mr. Lenin in Russia?

282
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,115
Not quite.

283
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,909
Does he have a car?

284
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:06,954
He lived a long time ago,
Your Majesty.

285
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,207
I want a car.

286
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:19,091
I think your mouse is trying to escape,
Your Majesty.

287
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,639
Please do not tell anyone
about my mouse.

288
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,819
The lesson is finished.

289
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,187
The official taster's a brave man.

290
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,191
Many of my ancestors
have been poisoned, you know.

291
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:24,365
Does Your Majesty
have lunch like this every day?

292
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,909
Ah, yes. Every day.
Like theater.

293
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,870
I do not know why.
It has always been like that.

294
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,544
How do they kill emperors in the West?

295
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,591
The Austrian emperor was shot,
was he not?

296
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:46,804
No. But his nephew was assassinated
before the Great War.

297
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:50,140
But the Russian emperor has been shot.
He was called a czar.

298
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:51,850
Yes.

299
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,812
He took lots of our land in Manchuria.

300
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:58,941
I'm a Manchurian. Even after the Republic,
it's still my country.

301
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:06,615
The... secret, Your Majesty,
is emerging again.

302
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,427
Is something the matter,
Your Majesty?

303
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,097
Something is happening.

304
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,020
What is happening, Mr. Johnston?

305
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,188
- Nothing is--
- Quiet.

306
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:27,196
On our way here, Your Majesty,
we were held up by students from the university.

307
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,657
They were protesting
against the Republican government...

308
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:34,787
because it has agreed to give away
Chinese territory to Japan.

309
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,248
Is it true, Mr. Johnston...

310
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:42,086
that many people out there
have had their heads chopped off?

311
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,963
It is true, Your Majesty.

312
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:47,716
Many heads have been chopped off.

313
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,096
It does stop them thinking.

314
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,098
It's time for the emperor's rest.

315
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:57,101
The students are right to be angry.

316
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:04,358
I'm angry.

317
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,154
But I'm not allowed to leave
the Forbidden City.

318
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,408
I want to go out, Mr. Johnston.

319
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,161
My lord.

320
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:18,747
I want to see the city of sounds.

321
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:31,885
The emperor awards you
with the order of the Ruby Hat Button...

322
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,598
and with the right to be carried
in your own chair with four bearers.

323
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,972
<i>Ye'll take the high road
and I'll take the low road</i>

324
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,001
I hope the emperor has not forgotten...

325
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:31,171
that this is the day
for his maths class.

326
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,764
For Your Majesty.

327
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,809
My doctor said bicycles are bad for you.

328
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:46,144
Bad for you? Nonsense!

329
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,571
How does it work?

330
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,615
Oh.

331
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,368
It's simple.

332
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,871
Head up and eyes forward.

333
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,208
As in life.

334
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,736
- My mother's dead, is she not?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

335
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:38,864
I'm profoundly sorry.

336
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,949
I am not.

337
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:48,206
She killed herself.
She swallowed a ball of opium.

338
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,170
I'm going to see her
and my brother.

339
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,471
Open the door.

340
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,850
Open the door!

341
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,697
Open the door.

342
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,872
Troublemaker!

343
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:37,876
Devil! Meddler!

344
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,504
Trouble. Nothing but trouble.

345
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:45,300
- Look where you lead him.
- And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man!

346
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:47,385
The boy's mother is dead...

347
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,387
and he's not even allowed to see her!

348
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,389
I want to go out!

349
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:53,016
I want to go out!

350
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,851
Stop that! Stay where you are!

351
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:57,729
- I want to go out!
- Stop it!

352
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,607
- I want to go out!
- Stay where you are! You fool!

353
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,108
Stay there!

354
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:05,779
Chang.

355
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,864
Hunchback. Big Foot.

356
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,852
Sir.

357
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,981
Give me your hand, sir.

358
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,821
Give me your hand, sir.

359
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:57,163
Can you not see?

360
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,639
Look at my left ear, please, sir.

361
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:18,602
Thank you. And now my right.

362
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,979
Thank you.

363
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,023
Would you follow my finger,
please, sir?

364
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,406
Mm-hmm.

365
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,243
Well, it's perfectly simple, Johnston.
The emperor needs spectacles.

366
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:37,579
Like Harold Lloyd.

367
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,873
Impossible.

368
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,833
An emperor does not wear spectacles.

369
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,836
That cannot be allowed.

370
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,131
Times have changed, Your Highnesses.

371
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:06,900
If His Majesty doesn't get spectacles,
Johnston, he could lose his sight.

372
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,115
Your Majesty.

373
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:35,762
If the emperor does not get spectacles,
I will resign.

374
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,015
Unfortunately, our decision is final.

375
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:44,688
And unfortunately, what I have to say
will be published in every newspaper in China.

376
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:50,694
What do you have to say, Mr. Johnston?

377
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:56,783
The emperor has been a prisoner in his own palace
since the day that he was crowned...

378
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,119
and has remained a prisoner
since he abdicated.

379
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,371
But now he's growing up,
he may wonder why...

380
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:05,959
he is the only person in China
who may not walk out of his own front door.

381
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,548
I think the emperor
is the loneliest boy on earth.

382
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,386
It would be conveniently sad...

383
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,763
if he becomes blind.

384
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:21,099
Blind, Mr. Johnston?

385
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,853
To the expense, Your Excellency.

386
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:28,606
To the cost of maintaining 1,200 eunuchs...

387
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:34,070
350 ladies-in-waiting and 185 cooks.

388
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:39,743
To buying 120 sable furs a month
and 3,000 chickens a week.

389
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:44,914
To the fact that 840 guards and employees
of the household department...

390
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:49,127
plus one lord chamberlain
care only about one thing:

391
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:52,547
filling their own rice bowls.

392
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:56,259
You are very good at accounts,
Mr. Johnston.

393
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:59,304
The emperor may have abdicated...

394
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:03,349
but he's still a symbol
of great importance to many people.

395
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:08,521
If I did not agree with that,
I would not be here.

396
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,025
And some of us believe...

397
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:16,070
that one day soon
he may be more than a symbol.

398
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:19,574
The spectacles are a detail.

399
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:23,495
What do you really want, Mr. Johnston?

400
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,580
Just the spectacles.

401
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,043
Oh.

402
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,718
The princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty.

403
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,428
Seventeen years old.

404
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:33,439
Princess Who Jen.
Fifteen years old.

405
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,609
The princess Li Li, Your Majesty.

406
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:40,280
And the Princess Fun Ying.

407
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:56,546
Who is this?

408
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,923
Princess Wen Hsiu.
Twelve years old.

409
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,134
She has got a funny face.

410
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:16,357
Not just one wife.
One empress and one secondary consort.

411
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:19,736
- Two wives?
- But who did you choose to be the empress?

412
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,865
They chose her.
She's very old, Johnston. She's 17.

413
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,659
That's not so old, Your Majesty.

414
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:29,704
- What does she look like?
- Old-fashioned.

415
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,831
I want a modern wife, Johnston...

416
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,667
who speaks English and French.

417
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,504
And who can dance the quickstep.

418
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,809
Johnston.

419
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,939
Sir.

420
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:58,107
I'm going to escape, Johnston.

421
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:01,277
I've got a suitcase
and a ticket to England.

422
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:03,738
I am going to Oxford University.

423
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:10,870
Your Majesty, if you get married,
you will become the master of your own house.

424
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:14,707
A wedding might be
a more practical way to escape.

425
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:53,162
Why did you never get married, Johnston?

426
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,248
Oh.

427
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,718
The secondary consort welcomes the empress.

428
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:10,179
The empress greets the secondary consort.

429
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,401
You do everything very well.

430
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,987
Thank you.
I rehearsed many times.

431
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,757
What is His Majesty thinking?

432
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:32,887
I was thinking if I was a real emperor
I would become the ruler of China now.

433
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:37,683
And what would the emperor do
if he could really rule?

434
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,978
I would change everything,
even the way we get married.

435
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:45,149
Is the emperor against
arranged marriages?

436
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:48,152
It is humiliating not to choose
whom you marry.

437
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,614
Even I was not allowed to choose.

438
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:09,590
In another year or two,
His Majesty will be taller than me.

439
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:14,178
Is it true the emperor
has a suitcase under his bed...

440
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:16,264
and is going to Oxford?

441
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,892
Will the emperor take
Wan Jung with him?

442
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:25,314
Perhaps he would like to see my face
before he decides.

443
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:31,320
Yes. The emperor would like
to see the face of the empress.

444
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,662
It is the emperor who must remove
the <i>kai t'ou.</i>

445
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:43,976
I also had a tutor,
like Mr. Johnston.

446
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,273
Miss Windsor.

447
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:54,487
She's American.

448
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,600
Miss Windsor taught me
how to do the dance of the quickstep.

449
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:29,146
Does the emperor know
how to do the quickstep?

450
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:32,566
Will you teach me?

451
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:27,496
Leave us. Leave us.

452
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:49,477
If Your Majesty thinks...

453
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:53,856
it is old-fashioned to make the rain
and the wind with a stranger...

454
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,401
we can be like a modern couple
to begin with.

455
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:59,320
A modern couple?

456
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:05,242
- Good night.
- Good night.

457
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,628
You must come to Oxford with me.

458
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,678
I like him.

459
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:29,058
I am sure I am going to like him.

460
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:31,227
And he will grow up.

461
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,565
Eyes down!

462
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,074
Report your arrival.

463
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:47,785
- Prisoner 981 reporting.
- Louder!

464
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,830
Prisoner 981 reporting.

465
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,124
Open the door.

466
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,756
Close the door.

467
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:04,802
Sit down.

468
01:11:10,982 --> 01:11:12,017
Name.

469
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,061
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

470
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:16,147
Write it.

471
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,751
Now then.

472
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,045
There are two types of confession.

473
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:44,508
We call them toothpaste and water tap.

474
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:49,805
The toothpaste prisoner
needs to be squeezed every now and then...

475
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,391
or else he forgets to keep confessing.

476
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:58,606
The water tap man needs one good,
hard twist before he starts...

477
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:01,358
but then everything comes out.

478
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:04,778
Now, you're an intelligent person.

479
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:07,990
I'm sure you understand me.

480
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,951
Good.

481
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:12,995
Then we'll begin.

482
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:16,582
Why do you think you're in here, 981?

483
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:22,588
I am accused of being a traitor,
a collaborator and a counterrevolutionary.

484
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:25,424
It is not an accusation!
You are a traitor...

485
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:29,094
you are a collaborator,
and you are a counterrevolutionary!

486
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,562
Did you write this?

487
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:40,564
And you call it a confession?

488
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:44,610
This is nothing but a list of dates.
A child's fairy tale.

489
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:58,832
- What do you want me to confess?
- You know what you did...

490
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,834
and what others did.

491
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:03,128
So why don't you volunteer the information?

492
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,880
I do not understand.

493
01:13:04,965 --> 01:13:07,883
We don't tell people what to confess.

494
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:09,927
We already know everything about you.

495
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,980
I...

496
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:26,068
- Go on.
- I wanted reforms.

497
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,904
What did you want to reform?

498
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:30,698
Everything.

499
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,827
Cut off my queue.

500
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,413
Your Majesty. Please.

501
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:17,494
- It is heavy.
- The emperor before me was murdered...

502
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:20,623
because he wanted to reform the empire.

503
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:22,625
Is that not so, Mr. Johnston?

504
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:25,711
Yes, Your Majesty. Probably.

505
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:31,759
Well, let us see if they will kill me
for reforming the Forbidden City.

506
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:34,261
Lord Chamberlain.

507
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:39,266
I am appointing Mr. Johnston's friend,
the poet and scholar Chen Hsiao Hsiu...

508
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,810
to be the new lord chamberlain.

509
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:46,190
I want him to supervise
a detailed inventory of the imperial storerooms...

510
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:50,736
so that we can learn exactly
how much has been stolen.

511
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:05,709
<i>The Forbidden City had become
a theater without an audience.</i>

512
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:09,296
<i>So why did the actors
remain on the stage?</i>

513
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:14,426
<i>It was only to steal the scenery,
piece by piece.</i>

514
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:31,443
Can I sleep here?
I am frightened.

515
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:51,547
You're brave.

516
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:53,632
Are you not frightened?

517
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:58,178
I am excited.
I do not want to escape anymore.

518
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,974
I want to rule.

519
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,603
Kiss me.

520
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,179
Can I stay with you as well?

521
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:44,850
Get in. Get in.

522
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:08,081
I used to play a game
with the eunuchs.

523
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:14,838
Trying to guess who is who.

524
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:18,592
Now I cannot see you.

525
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:28,344
Wan Jung?

526
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:30,330
Wen Hsiu?

527
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,734
Come underneath the sheet with us.

528
01:19:21,341 --> 01:19:24,843
Your Majesty.
The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty.

529
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,569
<i>The fire was a terrible disaster...</i>

530
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:47,532
<i>and I knew the eunuchs had started it
to stop me from knowing what they had stolen.</i>

531
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:52,204
<i>There had been eunuchs
in the Forbidden City for 800 years.</i>

532
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,665
<i>There were still more
than a thousand of them.</i>

533
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:57,125
<i>I decided to expel them all.</i>

534
01:19:57,210 --> 01:20:00,128
<i>I had to ask for Republican troops
to help me.</i>

535
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,655
- What are they carrying?
- Their organs.

536
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,241
Whatever their crimes...

537
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:15,620
they cannot be deprived of the right
to be buried as whole men.

538
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,512
Well?

539
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:17,349
Uh...

540
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:21,436
- I have forgot what I was saying.
- You are wasting our time!

541
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:24,397
We want to know about the Japanese.

542
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:28,485
How did your friendship
with the Japanese begin?

543
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:30,028
Who introduced you? When?

544
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:35,492
I think it was...

545
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,536
it was 1924.

546
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:42,040
Parliament had been dissolved again.
The president had fled.

547
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:46,628
At first, I thought it was
just another coup d'état...

548
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:49,089
by just another warlord.

549
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:53,135
Only this time it was different.

550
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:56,721
This time it was my turn.

551
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,059
Fifteen-love.

552
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,331
Play.

553
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,924
30-15.

554
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,709
The rotten government of the Republic
is in flight.

555
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,962
Now we shall remove the foreign stench
of the Manchurian rats...

556
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:13,340
who still hide in the Forbidden City.

557
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:27,687
"Mr. Pu Yi and his family
have been given one hour...

558
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,273
"to leave the Forbidden City.

559
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:36,446
"They will be escorted
to the home of his father...

560
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:39,991
"and remain there under guard
as state prisoners...

561
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:42,494
until further notice."

562
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:50,335
What are you all looking at?

563
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,420
What are you standing there for?

564
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:54,756
You always wanted to leave
the Forbidden City.

565
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,842
Now you've got an hour to pack.
So go!

566
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:00,845
Go!

567
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:16,069
I always thought I hated it here.

568
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:19,572
Now I'm afraid to leave.

569
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:22,826
- Do you think they will kill me?
- You must do as they say, Your Majesty...

570
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,537
while I try to reach
the British Embassy.

571
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,956
They will give you asylum there.

572
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,668
I'm sure they will.

573
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:36,214
Chang, take my car to the south gate.
I want you to drive His Majesty.

574
01:26:36,734 --> 01:26:38,985
Your Majesty!

575
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:28,785
- Please, Your Majesty.
- What?

576
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,878
But you didn't go
to the British Embassy, did you?

577
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:22,046
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy.

578
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:25,049
The Japanese were the only people
prepared to help me.

579
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:27,135
Help you for nothing?

580
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:32,765
Japan has an emperor.
We are almost the same age.

581
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,977
I thought it was kindness.

582
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:40,523
At the same time I realized that,
for many Chinese, I was an alien...

583
01:28:40,608 --> 01:28:43,860
simply because I am Manchurian.

584
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:49,157
There was even an anti-Manchurian league
who wanted to assassinate me.

585
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,243
So I went to live in Tientsin.

586
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:58,833
It was a nice, provincial town
with a big port.

587
01:28:58,918 --> 01:29:02,587
In those days they had
a large international settlement.

588
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,465
The Japanese thought
it would be safer for me there.

589
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:08,301
Were the Japanese paying for you
in Tientsin?

590
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,303
Oh, no.

591
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:13,723
I had to rent a villa...
the Villa Chang.

592
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:16,017
And it was very expensive.

593
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,269
So were the bodyguards.

594
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,773
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin.

595
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:25,944
Did you still believe
in a restoration of the imperial system?

596
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:29,197
Others did.
The little court in exile.

597
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,285
I cannot remember how much jade and jewelry
they made me spend...

598
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:39,332
to buy the friendship of some warlord
or some White Russian general.

599
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,251
What else did you spend your money on?

600
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:46,047
I was never tired of buying pianos,
watches, radios.

601
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,424
As long as they were foreign.

602
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:50,426
Of course.

603
01:29:50,511 --> 01:29:52,637
Anything Western was good.

604
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:56,933
Especially <i>Wrigley's Chewing Gum,
Bayer Aspirin,</i> and cars.

605
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:59,352
While you were in Tientsin...

606
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:03,231
most of China came under the control
of General Chiang Kai-shek...

607
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:05,567
the so-called nationalists...

608
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:07,735
the Kuomintang.

609
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,989
- What were your relations with them?
- None.

610
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,369
I felt useless in Tientsin.

611
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:19,080
I was 21.

612
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:22,417
I dreamt of going to the West.

613
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:24,419
I became a playboy.

614
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:28,673
<i>Am I blue</i>

615
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,759
<i>Am I blue</i>

616
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:34,971
<i>Ain't these tears in my eyes</i>

617
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:37,725
<i>Telling you</i>

618
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:41,144
<i>Am I blue</i>

619
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:44,147
<i>You'd be too</i>

620
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:47,317
<i>If each plan with your girl</i>

621
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:50,194
<i>Done fell through</i>

622
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,489
<i>Was a time</i>

623
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:57,535
<i>I was her only one</i>

624
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,787
<i>But now</i>

625
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:05,168
<i>I'm the sad and lonely one</i>

626
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:14,719
<i>Now she's gone and we're through</i>

627
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:19,474
<i>Lord, I'm blue</i>

628
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:21,559
Very good!

629
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,237
Well done!

630
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:11,442
That's a great ship
if you're going first class.

631
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,906
I am not going anywhere.

632
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:22,412
Would you like to dance?

633
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:35,925
You are a brave man.
Nobody here would have danced with me.

634
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:38,845
Why is that?

635
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:40,680
Because I'm Chinese.

636
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,099
Well, I'm American.

637
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:57,155
You say California.
I say French Riviera.

638
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,073
San Francisco!

639
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:01,576
Monte Carlo!

640
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:04,162
Are we really going this time?

641
01:33:13,422 --> 01:33:15,339
Who's that couple?

642
01:33:15,424 --> 01:33:18,342
Oh. Henry and Elizabeth.

643
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:20,344
The emperor of China?

644
01:33:20,429 --> 01:33:22,764
The ex-emperor and his wife.

645
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,852
- She's beautiful.
- Yes, very.

646
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,854
And who are you?

647
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:33,274
- I am His Highness's other wife.
- His other wife?

648
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:35,902
Number two wife.

649
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:38,196
Well, some people have all the luck.

650
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:56,088
Ladies and gentlemen!

651
01:33:59,343 --> 01:34:01,886
General Chiang Kai-shek...

652
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,388
has taken Shanghai.

653
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:07,391
The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds...

654
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:09,393
and have knocked them for six!

655
01:34:09,478 --> 01:34:11,096
The Reds are finished!

656
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:21,322
Sorry about the reception, everyone.
We'll get it fixed in a minute.

657
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,909
It would be wiser to return
to the Japanese Legation now, Your Majesty.

658
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:29,121
- Your car is waiting.
- Thank you, Mr. Amakasu.

659
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:31,207
Here we go.

660
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:46,180
<i>The general strike in Shanghai
has collapsed.</i>

661
01:34:46,265 --> 01:34:50,017
<i>The international settlement is safe.</i>

662
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:52,019
<i>Troops of the Kuomintang...</i>

663
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:54,564
<i>are now in full control of the city...</i>

664
01:34:54,648 --> 01:34:59,735
<i>and firm steps are being taken
to restore order in the native areas.</i>

665
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:12,498
Wen Hsiu, you want some gum?

666
01:35:16,295 --> 01:35:18,296
I want a divorce.

667
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:27,179
I do not want to be your mistress any longer.

668
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:30,182
I thought you were my secondary consort.

669
01:35:30,267 --> 01:35:34,687
In the Forbidden City, you were the emperor
and I was your secondary consort.

670
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:38,691
But now you are Henry Pu Yi.

671
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:41,611
Wan Yung is your wife, Elizabeth.

672
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:45,573
And who am I?

673
01:35:46,867 --> 01:35:48,119
I'm nobody.

674
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,672
I did not know you were so unhappy.

675
01:36:06,178 --> 01:36:09,180
You can only have one wife in the West.

676
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:16,729
I want a divorce.

677
01:36:16,813 --> 01:36:18,814
No one can divorce me.

678
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:45,383
I want a divorce!

679
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:22,753
Your Ladyship!

680
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,881
Your Ladyship!

681
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:34,348
Thank you.

682
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:50,656
I do not need it!

683
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:56,829
I do not need it.

684
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,352
Wen Hsiu.

685
01:38:39,372 --> 01:38:42,208
Elizabeth, can I come in?

686
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:44,585
Don't you remember me?

687
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:47,713
I'm dressed like a pilot,
but I still can't fly. Not yet.

688
01:38:47,798 --> 01:38:51,217
Eastern Jewel!
We had dancing classes together.

689
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:53,469
Yes, just before your marriage.

690
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:57,181
You silly girl.
Why do people want to get married?

691
01:38:57,265 --> 01:38:59,850
Wen Hsiu has gone.

692
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:01,852
She will never come back.

693
01:39:01,937 --> 01:39:03,938
Is that so bad?

694
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:07,274
She was my only friend.

695
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:12,113
Well, at least now you've got
your husband all to yourself.

696
01:39:13,782 --> 01:39:15,783
And you've got me!

697
01:39:17,202 --> 01:39:19,453
I'll be your friend.

698
01:39:19,538 --> 01:39:21,622
- You smoke opium?
- Be wicked.

699
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,707
It's the best in Shanghai.

700
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:27,294
Why are you going to Europe?

701
01:39:27,379 --> 01:39:30,798
The place to go is Japan.
It's more fun than anywhere.

702
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:34,885
It's modern.

703
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:38,764
How do you know we are going to Europe?
It is a secret.

704
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:41,058
Oh, I know everything.

705
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:45,229
I know Chiang Kai-shek
has got false teeth.

706
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:48,315
I even know his nickname--
"Cash My Check!"

707
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,822
I'm a spy...

708
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:57,116
and I don't care who knows it.

709
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:00,870
- A spy?
- I work for the Japanese Special Service Bureau.

710
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:03,455
And I've come to protect you.

711
01:40:04,457 --> 01:40:07,001
The Japanese...

712
01:40:07,085 --> 01:40:10,171
They are getting closer to him every day.

713
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:15,634
He is sending his brother
to the military academy in Tokyo.

714
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:18,929
They talk to him about Manchuria
all the time.

715
01:40:20,056 --> 01:40:22,975
And Mr. Amakasu never says hello to me.

716
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:24,977
I do not trust the Japanese.

717
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:39,617
Of course, I'd love to be
the emperor's new secondary consort.

718
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:43,329
- Eastern Jewel.
- If the post is available.

719
01:41:01,848 --> 01:41:04,850
The post is vacant, my dear cousin.

720
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:09,146
But you do not fit the part.

721
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,818
Wen Hsiu left the dog behind.
Do you want it?

722
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:19,240
It is my fault.

723
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:21,575
It is all my fault.

724
01:41:53,984 --> 01:41:56,485
I came to see you, Your Majesty...

725
01:41:56,569 --> 01:41:58,570
to give you bad news.

726
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:02,032
Something terrible has happened.

727
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,791
The imperial tombs
of our Manchurian ancestors...

728
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:13,585
have been attacked and robbed...

729
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:16,797
by troops of the Kuomintang.

730
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,258
Chinese soldiers.

731
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:21,510
A warlord working for Chiang Kai-shek.

732
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:28,767
The body of the Empress Dowager...

733
01:42:28,852 --> 01:42:30,853
was hacked to pieces.

734
01:42:32,856 --> 01:42:37,151
Her pearl necklace has become
a wedding present from Chiang Kai-shek...

735
01:42:37,235 --> 01:42:39,236
to his new wife.

736
01:43:01,009 --> 01:43:03,802
Tell me, 981,
do you consider yourself to be Chinese?

737
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:05,804
Of course.

738
01:43:05,889 --> 01:43:07,806
- What is this?
- Japan.

739
01:43:07,891 --> 01:43:10,684
- And what do you call this part of China?
- The northeast.

740
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:14,021
- And what did you call it as a child?
- Manchuria.

741
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:18,150
Japan invaded Manchuria
on September 18, 1931...

742
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:21,153
and began to set up
a puppet state called Manchukuo.

743
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:25,449
Shortly afterwards, a Japanese delegation
paid you a secret visit in Tientsin...

744
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:27,451
to request your collaboration.

745
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:29,453
Would you say you refused?

746
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:32,039
- Speak up!
- I already told you.

747
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:35,376
- I have told you a hundred times.
- Tell us again. Tell us 200 times.

748
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,378
I refused to collaborate.

749
01:43:37,462 --> 01:43:39,380
You say you refused.

750
01:43:39,464 --> 01:43:44,760
But a month later, on November 10, 1931,
there you are arriving in Manchuria.

751
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:47,054
Or should I call it Manchukuo?

752
01:43:47,138 --> 01:43:50,557
Now, according to this
so-called confession of yours...

753
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:52,559
you didn't go of your own free will.

754
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:54,978
You insist that you were kidnapped
by the Japanese!

755
01:43:55,063 --> 01:43:57,106
- Yes.
- And taken to Manchuria by force.

756
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,775
- Yes!
- Sit down.

757
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:06,949
Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?

758
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,702
He was your tutor.

759
01:44:10,787 --> 01:44:12,704
Yes.

760
01:44:12,789 --> 01:44:15,290
And a good friend, I believe.

761
01:44:17,168 --> 01:44:19,878
After 28 years in China...

762
01:44:19,963 --> 01:44:22,923
Mr. Johnston returned to England.

763
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:27,803
He became a professor of Oriental Studies
at London University...

764
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:31,181
and he wrote a book.

765
01:44:31,266 --> 01:44:34,351
It is called
<i>Twilight in the Forbidden City...</i>

766
01:44:34,436 --> 01:44:36,937
and it is dedicated to you.

767
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,538
Bye now!

768
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:56,540
- Bye!
- Good-bye!

769
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:59,376
- Don't forget to write!
- Bye, Mom!

770
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:07,759
I am going to miss you, Johnston.

771
01:45:07,844 --> 01:45:10,762
I shall miss you, Your Majesty.

772
01:45:14,184 --> 01:45:18,479
Do you think a man
can become emperor again?

773
01:45:18,563 --> 01:45:20,105
Yes.

774
01:45:38,917 --> 01:45:41,126
Thank you, Your Majesty.

775
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:46,965
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard!

776
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:49,051
How can we say good-bye?

777
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:52,763
As we said hello.

778
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:07,402
Farewell, Mr. Johnston.

779
01:46:07,487 --> 01:46:09,488
Farewell, Your Majesty.

780
01:46:15,453 --> 01:46:18,623
All aboard! All aboard!

781
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:20,625
Thank you.

782
01:46:21,309 --> 01:46:22,310
Thank you.

783
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,838
- All aboard!
- All aboard!

784
01:46:30,802 --> 01:46:32,803
All aboard now!

785
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:37,349
All aboard!

786
01:46:45,523 --> 01:46:47,067
All aboard!

787
01:46:56,744 --> 01:46:58,829
Good-bye, Mr. Johnston!

788
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:01,999
We'll never forget you, Mr. Johnston!

789
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:05,752
Good-bye!
Mr. Johnston, good-bye!

790
01:47:05,837 --> 01:47:08,297
- Good-bye!
- All aboard!

791
01:47:11,134 --> 01:47:15,804
On page 449...

792
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:17,806
Mr. Johnston writes:

793
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:23,478
"The endeavor to make out that the emperor
had been kidnapped by the Japanese...

794
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:25,814
"is wholly untrue.

795
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:29,776
"He left Tientsin and went to Manchuria...

796
01:47:29,861 --> 01:47:31,778
of his own free will."

797
01:47:31,863 --> 01:47:34,698
- Johnston was a liar.
- What did you say?

798
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:39,036
Mr. Johnston had left
before I was taken to Manchuria.

799
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,496
He could not have known what happened.

800
01:47:58,264 --> 01:48:00,265
Sit down.

801
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:11,777
According to this account, you prepared
the man's things on the morning of November 9.

802
01:48:11,861 --> 01:48:14,029
Isn't it unusual for a man
who is kidnapped...

803
01:48:14,113 --> 01:48:17,240
to have his luggage packed by his valet
the day before he is kidnapped?

804
01:48:17,325 --> 01:48:21,078
This is what you have written, isn't it?
Who told you to pack this man's luggage?

805
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:27,292
These two stories don't fit, do they?

806
01:48:29,337 --> 01:48:32,005
It was a long time ago.

807
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:34,174
Perhaps I made a mistake.

808
01:48:34,258 --> 01:48:37,135
You are lying!
You are both lying!

809
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:40,013
Control yourself!

810
01:48:46,354 --> 01:48:48,522
You can still change your mind.

811
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:58,740
I am the hereditary ruler
of the Manchurian people.

812
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:05,038
There can be no Manchukuo without me.

813
01:49:05,123 --> 01:49:08,625
Do you not see?
The Japanese are using you.

814
01:49:09,627 --> 01:49:12,379
I must try to use them.

815
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:16,341
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria
will be condemned by the League of Nations...

816
01:49:16,426 --> 01:49:18,593
and by every civilized country on Earth.

817
01:49:18,678 --> 01:49:22,180
The Chinese Republic has broken
every promise it ever made to me.

818
01:49:22,265 --> 01:49:25,851
Chinese troops desecrated
the tombs of my ancestors.

819
01:49:25,935 --> 01:49:29,146
And Chinese troops did not
defend Manchuria from the Japanese.

820
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:31,982
But Manchuria is still China!

821
01:49:32,066 --> 01:49:35,736
- China has turned its back on me.
- Please, do not go.

822
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:39,156
Manchuria is the richest frontier in Asia.

823
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,867
Coal, oil, railways!

824
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:44,911
Millions of Chinese immigrants
are going there every year.

825
01:49:44,996 --> 01:49:46,913
I'm going to build my country.

826
01:49:46,998 --> 01:49:50,417
Johnston was wrong,
but he wasn't a liar.

827
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:52,961
There was no kidnapping.

828
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:57,966
You went to Manchuria by your own choice
because you wanted to be emperor again!

829
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:17,068
These might help you
to remember the truth.

830
01:51:55,877 --> 01:51:57,878
To heaven.

831
01:52:04,785 --> 01:52:06,304
To earth.

832
01:52:07,388 --> 01:52:09,472
To the moon.

833
01:52:12,351 --> 01:52:14,811
To the sun.

834
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:33,496
You're an empress again.

835
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:37,500
What I'm going to be is a pilot.

836
01:52:37,585 --> 01:52:41,755
I'm going to train at a secret base near Yokohama
to learn precision bombing.

837
01:52:43,049 --> 01:52:45,467
I want to bomb Shanghai.

838
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,970
Bomb Shanghai?

839
01:52:49,055 --> 01:52:51,056
I hate China.

840
01:52:57,146 --> 01:52:59,147
I hate you.

841
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:22,897
The Japanese army high command.
Very impressive!

842
01:54:24,025 --> 01:54:26,776
The Japanese army!

843
01:54:36,244 --> 01:54:37,245
Quickly!

844
01:54:55,681 --> 01:54:58,099
On behalf of the emperor of Japan...

845
01:54:58,184 --> 01:55:03,229
the commander of the Kwangtung Army
extends his warmest congratulations...

846
01:55:03,314 --> 01:55:06,816
on the occasion of His Majesty's coronation.

847
01:55:49,026 --> 01:55:50,944
Ah, yes.

848
01:55:54,782 --> 01:55:57,700
Manchukuo will grow into a great nation.

849
01:55:57,785 --> 01:56:01,120
Japan will always be
at her side to help her.

850
01:57:02,391 --> 01:57:05,101
Uh, may I introduce you?

851
01:57:05,185 --> 01:57:07,479
My wife, the Princess Hiro Saga.

852
01:57:08,564 --> 01:57:10,773
Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu.

853
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:18,907
The Honorable Chang Chinghui,
Minister of Defense.

854
01:57:20,993 --> 01:57:23,162
The Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Colonna.

855
01:57:38,594 --> 01:57:42,305
The empress and I
accept with great pleasure...

856
01:57:49,313 --> 01:57:51,397
Excuse me, General.

857
01:58:14,296 --> 01:58:17,548
Ah, and our Mr. Amakasu...

858
01:58:17,633 --> 01:58:21,803
is the new chief of
the Manchurian Motion Picture Studios.

859
01:58:31,146 --> 01:58:34,524
Why do you have to spoil this day?

860
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:36,609
Why?

861
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:43,116
Mr. Amakasu is
the most powerful man in Manchukuo.

862
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,451
What are you talking about?

863
01:58:46,495 --> 01:58:50,873
You did not believe
I could be emperor again, but I am.

864
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:52,959
You are blind.

865
01:59:02,678 --> 01:59:06,597
Do you know what it means to be an empress?
You are an empress.

866
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:12,937
Why do you not make love to me anymore?

867
01:59:13,022 --> 01:59:14,981
Because you have become an opium addict.

868
01:59:16,734 --> 01:59:20,028
Opium killed my mother.
Opium destroyed China.

869
01:59:20,112 --> 01:59:22,655
You can buy opium anywhere in Manchukuo.

870
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,657
- Shut up.
- In any shop.

871
01:59:24,742 --> 01:59:27,035
Shut up!

872
01:59:29,455 --> 01:59:31,914
Your brother is going to have a child.

873
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:36,502
We must have a child.

874
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:40,256
You must have an heir.

875
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:45,595
Emperor Hirohito has officially
invited us to Japan.

876
01:59:47,056 --> 01:59:49,098
I'm going alone.

877
01:59:49,183 --> 01:59:51,559
You are staying here.

878
01:59:51,643 --> 01:59:53,978
I will never go to Japan.

879
01:59:54,063 --> 01:59:56,064
Then go to your room.

880
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:06,032
Ten thousand years
to His Majesty the Emperor!

881
02:00:07,868 --> 02:00:10,244
- Ten thousand years!
- Ten thousand years!

882
02:00:10,329 --> 02:00:14,832
Ten thousand years
to His Majesty, the Emperor!

883
02:00:14,917 --> 02:00:17,127
Ten thousand years!

884
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:24,675
Ten thousand years!

885
02:00:29,848 --> 02:00:34,560
Ten thousand years!
Ten thousand years!

886
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:22,733
I told you I hate you.

887
02:01:25,237 --> 02:01:28,239
Only because I give you
what you need.

888
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:04,567
Now we're engaged.

889
02:03:00,874 --> 02:03:03,876
- You forgot my tooth powder.
- Oh.

890
02:03:03,961 --> 02:03:05,962
Yes, sir.

891
02:03:24,606 --> 02:03:26,607
Move him.

892
02:03:31,113 --> 02:03:33,322
981, collect your things.

893
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:45,209
Upstairs!

894
02:03:49,381 --> 02:03:51,382
Stop.

895
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:02,059
Your laces are undone.
Do them up.

896
02:04:02,144 --> 02:04:05,438
Thursday you serve lunch.
Friday you clean the toilet.

897
02:04:05,522 --> 02:04:07,690
Saturday you sweep the floor.

898
02:04:35,344 --> 02:04:38,429
I have never been separated
from my family.

899
02:04:38,513 --> 02:04:40,681
You'd better get used to it.

900
02:04:45,604 --> 02:04:48,022
You do not remember me, do you?

901
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:51,650
I was the minister of trade in Manchukuo.

902
02:04:55,697 --> 02:04:57,865
You were all in Manchukuo.

903
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:01,786
Now I am the cell leader.

904
02:05:01,870 --> 02:05:06,332
It is important to follow the rules here.
No talking during study sessions.

905
02:05:59,678 --> 02:06:01,595
Where is your gun, Captain?

906
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:03,597
Where are their swords?

907
02:06:03,682 --> 02:06:06,183
Our weapons have been removed,
Your Majesty...

908
02:06:06,268 --> 02:06:08,936
on the orders of Colonel Yoshioka.

909
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:11,313
Colonel Yoshioka?

910
02:06:12,816 --> 02:06:16,193
- Colonel Yoshioka.
- What has happened here?

911
02:06:16,278 --> 02:06:18,487
Why has my guard been disarmed?

912
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:21,073
Yes, it is very unfortunate,
Your Majesty.

913
02:06:21,158 --> 02:06:24,076
There have been many changes
while you were in Tokyo.

914
02:06:24,161 --> 02:06:27,830
Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa...

915
02:06:27,914 --> 02:06:31,792
the new Japanese ambassador to Manchukuo.

916
02:06:57,819 --> 02:07:00,946
Why is Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu
not here to receive me?

917
02:07:01,031 --> 02:07:04,283
The prime minister has resigned,
Your Majesty.

918
02:07:04,367 --> 02:07:06,785
His son has been assassinated.

919
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:08,787
Assassinated?

920
02:07:08,872 --> 02:07:11,999
By Communist bandits, Your Majesty.

921
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:20,758
I must see him at once.

922
02:07:20,842 --> 02:07:23,719
He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty.

923
02:07:23,803 --> 02:07:26,263
He has gone to a monastery...

924
02:07:26,348 --> 02:07:28,557
far away.

925
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:38,192
Who are you?

926
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:40,945
Chang Chinghui, Your Majesty...

927
02:07:41,029 --> 02:07:43,447
Minister of Defense.

928
02:07:44,616 --> 02:07:46,617
Yes.

929
02:07:48,286 --> 02:07:50,287
Of course.

930
02:07:52,082 --> 02:07:55,334
The council meeting will be at 4:00,
Your Majesty...

931
02:07:55,418 --> 02:07:57,711
before the state dinner.

932
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:13,143
"The emperor has been asked
to sign the following.

933
02:08:13,228 --> 02:08:15,145
"After careful consideration...

934
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:18,732
"we have decided to nominate
the Honorable Chang Chinghui...

935
02:08:18,817 --> 02:08:22,319
as the new prime minister of Manchukuo."

936
02:08:28,784 --> 02:08:29,702
No.

937
02:08:29,786 --> 02:08:32,204
Today, on our return from Japan...

938
02:08:32,289 --> 02:08:36,000
we wish to speak
of something more important...

939
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:39,336
the future of our friendship with Japan.

940
02:08:40,422 --> 02:08:43,924
This is based on mutual respect.

941
02:08:44,009 --> 02:08:47,636
And respect means
equality and independence.

942
02:08:47,721 --> 02:08:53,183
When the two emperors stood together
and saluted the two national flags...

943
02:08:53,268 --> 02:08:56,520
they recognized that Manchukuo
had come of age.

944
02:08:56,605 --> 02:08:59,982
Manchukuo is not a colony.
Manchukuo is Manchuria.

945
02:09:03,903 --> 02:09:06,238
The relationship between our two countries...

946
02:09:06,323 --> 02:09:09,241
is like the relationship
between its two emperors.

947
02:09:09,326 --> 02:09:11,744
It is rooted in fraternal trust...

948
02:09:11,828 --> 02:09:13,746
in--

949
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:18,083
in the desire to preserve
our ancient traditions...

950
02:09:18,168 --> 02:09:21,962
and in a mutual respect
for our national identities!

951
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:26,258
Already we have welcomed the ambassadors...

952
02:09:26,343 --> 02:09:30,471
of El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Vatican.

953
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:35,768
Soon, I'm-- I'm sure
the other countries will follow.

954
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:57,831
I'm going to have a child.

955
02:10:01,169 --> 02:10:03,170
The father is Manchurian.

956
02:10:08,677 --> 02:10:10,594
Colonel Yoshioka and Mr. Amakasu!

957
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:12,680
I did it for you.

958
02:10:35,245 --> 02:10:38,956
His Majesty forgot to sign
the appointment of the new prime minister...

959
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:41,208
Mr. Chang Chinghui.

960
02:10:42,252 --> 02:10:44,253
I did not forget.

961
02:10:51,136 --> 02:10:53,303
When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty...

962
02:10:53,388 --> 02:10:55,597
he becomes a gentleman.

963
02:10:55,682 --> 02:10:59,435
If he robs a lot,
he becomes a knight.

964
02:10:59,519 --> 02:11:03,856
Do you imagine the British
run their empire as a charity?

965
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:08,694
If India has paid for the cost
of its own occupation...

966
02:11:08,778 --> 02:11:11,071
so must Manchukuo!

967
02:11:24,961 --> 02:11:28,297
We hope Manchukuo will have an heir.

968
02:11:30,967 --> 02:11:33,010
The empress is expecting a child.

969
02:11:33,094 --> 02:11:36,513
Yes, Your Majesty.
We are aware of the situation.

970
02:11:42,896 --> 02:11:45,397
This is the name of the father.

971
02:11:53,907 --> 02:11:56,533
His name is Chang.

972
02:11:56,618 --> 02:11:58,619
He is your driver.

973
02:12:17,388 --> 02:12:20,516
All the necessary facts have been recorded.

974
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:23,185
The man will be punished.

975
02:12:23,269 --> 02:12:27,314
The emperor cannot allow
his honor to be stained.

976
02:12:43,665 --> 02:12:48,085
The Japanese are the only divine race on earth.

977
02:12:48,169 --> 02:12:52,881
We will take China, Hong Kong, Indochina...

978
02:12:52,966 --> 02:12:55,300
Siam, Malaya...

979
02:12:55,385 --> 02:12:58,470
Singapore and India!

980
02:12:58,555 --> 02:13:00,973
Asia belongs to us!

981
02:13:32,463 --> 02:13:35,465
There have been complaints
from your cell mates.

982
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:39,803
You must learn how to urinate at night
without waking them all up.

983
02:13:41,681 --> 02:13:46,602
The way to do it is to urinate
against the side of the bucket...

984
02:13:46,686 --> 02:13:48,604
not into the middle.

985
02:13:48,688 --> 02:13:50,689
Yes, comrade.

986
02:14:05,079 --> 02:14:08,081
You still think I am your servant,
don't you?

987
02:14:30,939 --> 02:14:33,357
You are all pretending.

988
02:14:33,441 --> 02:14:35,859
You are just pretending
you have changed.

989
02:14:35,944 --> 02:14:40,030
Shut up! The party teaches us to be new men
while working for a new China!

990
02:14:40,114 --> 02:14:42,824
You worked in Amakasu's private office.

991
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:46,912
You are still the same people.
People do not change.

992
02:14:46,996 --> 02:14:49,206
Guard! Guard!

993
02:14:55,755 --> 02:14:57,673
Guard!

994
02:14:57,757 --> 02:15:00,467
- I let it happen.
- Guard!

995
02:15:00,551 --> 02:15:03,553
- Guard!
- I let it happen.

996
02:15:39,757 --> 02:15:42,175
The second edict, Your Majesty.

997
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:46,096
Japanese will be the official language
in Manchukuo schools.

998
02:15:58,991 --> 02:16:00,235
Your Majesty!

999
02:16:05,074 --> 02:16:06,992
The baby was born dead, Your Majesty.

1000
02:16:07,076 --> 02:16:09,327
How is the empress?

1001
02:16:09,412 --> 02:16:12,372
It will be better if she goes to a clinic.
Somewhere warm.

1002
02:16:16,294 --> 02:16:18,179
She's already left, Your Majesty.

1003
02:17:10,765 --> 02:17:13,266
Open the door.

1004
02:18:12,827 --> 02:18:15,704
<i>With Manchukuo now firmly in their grasp...</i>

1005
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:19,457
<i>the Japanese soon controlled
most of North China.</i>

1006
02:18:19,542 --> 02:18:22,919
<i>By 1937 they were ready to strike south...</i>

1007
02:18:23,004 --> 02:18:25,714
<i>at the heart of the country.</i>

1008
02:18:25,798 --> 02:18:30,510
<i>The attack on Shanghai was one
of the first civilian bombing raids in history.</i>

1009
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:34,931
<i>It left thousands homeless,
thousands dead.</i>

1010
02:18:40,897 --> 02:18:46,651
<i>Three months later, Japanese armies
were besieging the provisional capital at Nanking...</i>

1011
02:18:46,736 --> 02:18:50,363
<i>and when the city fell
the atrocities began.</i>

1012
02:18:52,033 --> 02:18:56,244
<i>Trying to terrorize the rest of China
into surrender...</i>

1013
02:18:56,329 --> 02:18:59,206
<i>the Japanese high command
ordered a massacre.</i>

1014
02:18:59,290 --> 02:19:03,877
<i>More than 200,000 civilians
were systematically executed.</i>

1015
02:19:03,961 --> 02:19:06,922
<i>The world watched in horror...</i>

1016
02:19:07,006 --> 02:19:09,174
<i>but no help was given.</i>

1017
02:19:09,258 --> 02:19:12,594
<i>On December 7, 1941...</i>

1018
02:19:12,678 --> 02:19:16,973
<i>Japan attacked the American fleet
at Pearl Harbor.</i>

1019
02:19:17,058 --> 02:19:18,892
<i>There was no warning.</i>

1020
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:23,730
<i>Manchukuo, the Japanese bastion
in North China...</i>

1021
02:19:23,814 --> 02:19:27,275
<i>was still ruled
by the puppet emperor Pu Yi.</i>

1022
02:19:29,028 --> 02:19:31,571
<i>But behind the facade of triumph...</i>

1023
02:19:31,656 --> 02:19:35,075
<i>was a country enslaved...</i>

1024
02:19:35,159 --> 02:19:39,663
<i>a country where Japanese experiments
in biological warfare...</i>

1025
02:19:39,747 --> 02:19:43,708
<i>were carried out on live human beings...</i>

1026
02:19:43,793 --> 02:19:49,256
<i>a country where opium production
became the easiest way to finance the war.</i>

1027
02:19:51,050 --> 02:19:54,886
<i>Millions of people
were deliberately turned into drug addicts.</i>

1028
02:20:20,037 --> 02:20:24,207
<i>Nine days after the bomb at Hiroshima...</i>

1029
02:20:24,292 --> 02:20:27,669
<i>on August 15, 1945...</i>

1030
02:20:27,753 --> 02:20:31,589
<i>Emperor Hirohito announced
the surrender of Japan.</i>

1031
02:20:32,633 --> 02:20:36,761
<i>It was the first time his voice
had ever been heard on radio.</i>

1032
02:21:21,307 --> 02:21:23,725
You must get to Tokyo, Your Majesty.

1033
02:21:23,809 --> 02:21:26,436
You must surrender to the Americans,
not the Russians.

1034
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,022
The Communists will kill everyone.

1035
02:22:14,443 --> 02:22:16,986
The empress has returned.

1036
02:22:25,245 --> 02:22:26,746
Majesty, please.

1037
02:22:31,877 --> 02:22:33,878
Your Majesty!

1038
02:23:26,891 --> 02:23:29,851
Hurry! There is no room on the plane,
Your Majesty!

1039
02:23:29,935 --> 02:23:33,438
The women are not in danger!
We must hurry!

1040
02:24:29,703 --> 02:24:32,914
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty is leaving now!

1041
02:24:32,998 --> 02:24:34,999
Now!

1042
02:25:10,494 --> 02:25:12,495
The Russians!

1043
02:25:50,659 --> 02:25:55,371
Perhaps you think we are here
to teach men to lie in a new way.

1044
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:58,833
Why did you sign
every accusation made against you?

1045
02:25:58,917 --> 02:26:02,587
I didn't stop you from killing yourself
to see you like this...

1046
02:26:03,589 --> 02:26:08,259
someone who signs anything
to please his enemies, to please me!

1047
02:26:08,344 --> 02:26:11,596
You knew about a lot of things in Manchukuo...

1048
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:13,931
even the secret agreement...

1049
02:26:14,016 --> 02:26:15,933
but you couldn't possibly have known...

1050
02:26:16,018 --> 02:26:19,646
about the Japanese biological
warfare experiments in Harbin.

1051
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:21,731
Could you?

1052
02:26:23,067 --> 02:26:26,402
So why did you sign these papers?

1053
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:32,909
I was responsible for everything.

1054
02:26:32,993 --> 02:26:35,662
You are responsible for what you do!

1055
02:26:36,914 --> 02:26:39,999
All your life you thought
you were better than everyone else.

1056
02:26:40,084 --> 02:26:43,086
Now you think you are the worst of all!

1057
02:26:48,967 --> 02:26:51,302
Why can you not leave me alone?

1058
02:26:53,639 --> 02:26:57,934
You saved my life
to make me a puppet in your own play.

1059
02:26:58,018 --> 02:27:00,937
You saved me because I am useful to you.

1060
02:27:01,021 --> 02:27:04,107
Is that so terrible...

1061
02:27:04,191 --> 02:27:06,442
to be useful?

1062
02:27:38,892 --> 02:27:40,601
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

1063
02:27:45,524 --> 02:27:50,570
By order of the Supreme People's Court...

1064
02:27:50,654 --> 02:27:54,907
the war criminal Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...

1065
02:27:54,992 --> 02:27:58,411
male, 53 years old...

1066
02:27:58,495 --> 02:28:00,997
of the Manchu nationality...

1067
02:28:01,081 --> 02:28:02,999
and from Peking...

1068
02:28:03,083 --> 02:28:06,043
has now served 10 years' detention.

1069
02:28:06,128 --> 02:28:11,174
As a result of remolding through labor...

1070
02:28:11,258 --> 02:28:15,845
and ideological education
during his captivity...

1071
02:28:15,929 --> 02:28:19,348
he has shown that he has
genuinely reformed.

1072
02:28:19,433 --> 02:28:25,021
In accordance with clause one
of the Special Pardon Order...

1073
02:28:25,105 --> 02:28:29,150
he is therefore to be released.

1074
02:28:40,204 --> 02:28:42,121
You see?

1075
02:28:42,206 --> 02:28:46,250
I will end up living in prison
longer than you.

1076
02:31:19,029 --> 02:31:20,531
The Red Guards.

1077
02:31:28,330 --> 02:31:30,331
They are so young.

1078
02:31:31,667 --> 02:31:33,751
It is dangerous.

1079
02:31:39,967 --> 02:31:41,717
Look.

1080
02:31:41,802 --> 02:31:44,804
Over there. Pu Chieh, look!

1081
02:31:48,225 --> 02:31:51,060
It is the governor of our prison!

1082
02:31:51,144 --> 02:31:53,062
- It cannot be.
- It is!

1083
02:31:53,146 --> 02:31:55,064
I'm sure it is!

1084
02:31:57,567 --> 02:31:59,568
Be careful.

1085
02:32:00,862 --> 02:32:03,531
Come back!

1086
02:32:46,992 --> 02:32:50,036
Comrade, this must be a mistake.

1087
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:52,413
I know this man.
He is a good man.

1088
02:32:52,497 --> 02:32:55,416
- Who are you?
- I am a gardener.

1089
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:58,502
Join us, comrade, or fuck off!

1090
02:33:07,721 --> 02:33:09,638
But what has he done?

1091
02:33:09,723 --> 02:33:12,224
- He has been accused.
- Accused of what?

1092
02:33:12,309 --> 02:33:14,268
- Emperor's lackey!
- Revisionist element!

1093
02:33:14,352 --> 02:33:16,479
Rotten rightist!

1094
02:33:16,563 --> 02:33:19,482
- Confess your crime.
- I have nothing to confess.

1095
02:33:19,566 --> 02:33:21,317
Kowtow to Chairman Mao.

1096
02:33:25,238 --> 02:33:28,199
- Confess your crimes.
- I have nothing to confess.

1097
02:33:28,283 --> 02:33:30,034
Kowtow!

1098
02:33:33,371 --> 02:33:35,998
- Confess your crimes!
- Wait!

1099
02:33:36,083 --> 02:33:39,001
He's a teacher!
He is a good teacher!

1100
02:33:39,086 --> 02:33:42,421
- You-- You cannot do this to him!
- Move! Move!

1101
02:33:42,506 --> 02:33:45,508
You are wrong!
He is a good teacher!

1102
02:36:47,107 --> 02:36:50,025
Stop!

1103
02:36:50,110 --> 02:36:53,737
You are not allowed in there!

1104
02:36:57,117 --> 02:36:59,034
- Who are you?
- I live here.

1105
02:36:59,119 --> 02:37:01,036
I am the son of the guardian.

1106
02:37:01,121 --> 02:37:03,747
Ah, well, I used to live here too.

1107
02:37:03,832 --> 02:37:07,751
- That is where I sat.
- Who are you?

1108
02:37:07,836 --> 02:37:10,629
I was the emperor of China.

1109
02:37:10,714 --> 02:37:12,715
Prove it!

1110
02:38:51,898 --> 02:38:54,316
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony...

1111
02:38:54,401 --> 02:38:56,318
where the emperors were crowned.

1112
02:38:56,403 --> 02:39:00,322
The last emperor to be crowned here
was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

1113
02:39:00,407 --> 02:39:02,324
He was three years old.

1114
02:39:02,409 --> 02:39:05,744
He died in 1967.
