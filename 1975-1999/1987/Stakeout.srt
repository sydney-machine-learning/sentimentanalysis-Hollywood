1
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:02,158
Shit.

2
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:46,115
- A little late.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

3
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:51,602
I'm all out of spares.
Should have been home hours ago.

4
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:09,725
That's got it.

5
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:12,924
Thanks.
See you in a half hour.

6
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,917
Open up.

7
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,158
Get me out of this trap!

8
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,640
Hey, Louie!

9
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:06,955
- Give my regards to Broadway.
- What'd I tell you about
screwing around with my books?

10
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:09,356
I didn't touch your fag rags,
you understand?

11
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:12,439
Who the hell else touched them then?
There's only you and me in here.

12
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:16,202
- Piss off!
- Hey, man, don't fuckin'
tell me to piss off.

13
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:18,323
I just did, asshole.

14
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:25,438
Come on.
Come on, big cowboy.

15
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:34,800
- We got a problem in 1 7.
Better get down there.
- Hey, Billy. Billy, get him good.

16
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,638
- Come on!
- Get ya down there!

17
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:49,037
- Kick the shit out of him!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

18
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,437
Hey! Hey!
What's going on in there?

19
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,275
Kill the mother!

20
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,118
Do it!

21
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:21,077
Help!

22
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,998
Oh, God!

23
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,521
Get off!

24
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,405
Die, you fucker!
You son of a bitch!

25
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:33,003
I'm coming after you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

26
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:34,759
You goddam scum!
I'll kill you!

27
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,679
God!

28
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,406
Will you take it easy?

29
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,838
Put him up here.

30
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:52,725
Numbnuts!

31
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:55,560
Fuck you.

32
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,997
Don't move.

33
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:03,204
Doc, keep your shoes
in one place, man.

34
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:09,366
Fuck you too.

35
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:13,126
Come on.
Get on the table.

36
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:17,041
Hey. Hey!
Stick, we gotta go!

37
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:19,561
I want to ask you a question.
Do you think it's humane...

38
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:23,640
to pump perfectly sane prisoners
full of fiiloxin and thorazine?

39
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:27,996
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

40
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,523
All right,
we got three minutes.

41
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,998
Let go.
Let go, man.

42
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:31,039
Get in the box.
Get in the box!

43
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,847
- Okay. See you next week.
- Right.

44
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,521
- Good night.
- Good night. Thanks.

45
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:28,037
Are we out?

46
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,845
- We out?
- Yeah.

47
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,598
Yeah?

48
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:47,599
- Who's this?
- Uh, that's, uh, Maria McGuire.

49
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:49,723
She came a couple of times
to visit Montgomery.

50
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:53,163
222 1 Speck Road, Seattle.
Is that address current?

51
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,044
I hope so.
That's all we got.

52
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:58,085
May I, uh--
Thank you.

53
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:04,806
Hey, you want these eggs hot?
You want me freeze them?
Come on. Pick them up. Thank you.

54
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:07,640
- See the game last night?
- No, no. I missed it.

55
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:11,003
Whoa. Don't get your hands
too close to his mouth.

56
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,203
Anything else?

57
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,757
- Yeah, I'd like another
cup of coffee, please.
- Okay.

58
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,396
- And I'd like a side order of sausage.
- You bet.

59
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:23,126
- How long has he been in there?
- About ten minutes.

60
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:36,517
- That is disgusting.
- Really?

61
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,836
My God. Do you eat like that
in front of your mother?

62
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:43,885
- It's an old family custom.
- Well, I'll tell ya, it's not healthy.

63
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:47,562
You gotta take your time.
Do you have any idea what that
does to your digestive system?

64
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:49,842
No, but I'm afraid
you're gonna tell me.

65
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,646
You've got to savour
the qualities of the cuisine.

66
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:55,525
First the smell--
Oh, for Christ's sake--

67
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:58,121
There he is. Come on. Let's go.
Pay the cheque.

68
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:04,205
Come on. Let's get the forklift up here.
Come on. Let's go.

69
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,562
There he is.

70
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,762
All right, he's not here.
You check upstairs. I'll take the docks.

71
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:35,398
Oh, no, no. I picked up the cheque.
You take the fiish.

72
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:39,081
Oh, shit.

73
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:30,998
You're under arrest!
You have the right to remain silent.

74
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,920
Oh, shit!

75
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,926
Oh, shit!

76
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:20,724
Bill!

77
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:27,919
Bill!

78
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,882
Stop! Police!

79
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:36,877
Bill!

80
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:49,324
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry. My fault.

81
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:53,036
Sorry. Oh, God.

82
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,516
What do you think you're doin'?

83
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:21,317
- Hey!
- Freeze!

84
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:25,719
Lace your fiingers above your head
and turn around towards me real slow.

85
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,367
Now you're under arrest.

86
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,119
Get back!

87
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,886
Chris!

88
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh, God, I hate this part.

89
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,442
I'm on fire

90
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,797
Desire

91
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:27,117
- Took you long enough.
- It's my one desire

92
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:31,041
- Desire to win
- Free air, man. Free air.

93
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:33,766
- I'm gonna say it again, say it again
- You don't know what this means.
- It's my one

94
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:37,283
- You have no idea.
- Yeah. Let's move.
- Desire

95
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:00,924
Hi, Bernie.
I'd like some prints.

96
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:04,124
And there's some blood on the blade.
I'd like to have it typed.
Thank you very much.

97
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:07,643
What is that smell?
Chris?

98
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:11,083
Oh, oh, oh, oh, looks like somebody's
been in a fiight,Jack.

99
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,682
What? Nobody in cuffs here?
That must mean something.

100
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,486
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait
a minute. I think that means that, uh...

101
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,444
somebody got their ass kicked.

102
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:23,042
Complaints.
I'm Bernie.

103
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:26,642
- Okay.
- God, you stink.

104
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:31,243
Hey, guys. Captain wants to
see you in his offiice ASAP.

105
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,115
ASAP? I'd like to take a shower fiirst.
What do you say?

106
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,925
- Please.
- I wish you would.

107
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:40,602
But by the sound of his voice,
I think he'll see you as is.

108
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,962
Go ahead! Get out!

109
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:44,958
Uh, wait a minute, chuckles.

110
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:50,075
- Captain wants to see you too.
- What'd you do now?

111
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:55,599
What the hell happened to you?
Looks like you got your ass kicked?

112
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:59,362
No, no, don't sit there, no.
Shut the door.

113
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:03,326
Gentlemen, this is Agent Thomas Lusk
from the regional FBI headquarters.

114
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,318
- Detective Bill Reimers.
- Hey, Billy.

115
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:10,481
- There's, uh, Chris Lecce over there.
Uh, Phil Coldshank.
- Pleasure, sir.

116
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,127
- And, uh,Jack Pismo.
- Right on.

117
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,846
''Right on.''
He said, ''Right on.''

118
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:18,919
Now, the FBI has requested some help
over the next couple of weeks.

119
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,282
So for now,
your cases have been reassigned.

120
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:25,599
- Whoa, whoa, reassigned?
- Wait a minute. Bill and I are close
to breaking this thing--
- A forklift, wasn't it?

121
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:29,641
From now on,
you're working full-time on this.

122
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,525
- Kleenex, please.
- In the drawer there.

123
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:36,759
Mr, uh, Lusk
is in charge of this operation,
so I'll let him do the talking.

124
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:41,204
Yeah, I-I don't know if
you're familiar with Montgomery,
but, uh, just in case you're not.

125
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,517
Two years ago he killed
one of our agents.

126
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:45,677
He should have had the chair,
but he had a sharp attorney...

127
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:49,237
and the local police were a little too
zealous in their pursuit of evidence.

128
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:52,478
- A plea bargain kept him from frying.
- Yo!
- Sorry.

129
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:55,525
Just busted out of Stonehurst,
didn't he? Killed a guard?

130
00:16:55,607 --> 00:17:00,203
Yeah, he and his cousin
crossed into Wyoming, ditched
their truck and had a car waiting.

131
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:04,439
- If he's in Wyoming, why are you here?
- Well, we think he'll head for Mexico,
but he has friends here.

132
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:06,995
So we're setting up
a half a dozen stake-outs.

133
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:10,966
Now, uh, we'll handle
the important ones, but, uh,
since we're a little short on help...

134
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:12,958
uh, your men will take the others.

135
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,402
- Of course.
- Who we watching?

136
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:18,320
Oh, he has an old girlfriend here. He
hasn't seen her for a year and a half.

137
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:22,844
Her name is Maria McGuire.
Now, you'll be watching her house...

138
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:26,476
and the Second Precinct will take her
at the restaurant where she works.

139
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:30,037
Here are the keys
to the apartment we rented across
the street from where she lives.

140
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,595
Now, we're gonna have
to move on this one quick.

141
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:37,886
I-- I know it's short notice,
but this is real bad people we're after.

142
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:42,358
- Do we, uh, get a bug?
- Hopefully within 24 hours.

143
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:45,086
Uh, just one other thing.

144
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:48,603
If you spot Montgomery, report it.
Nothing more.

145
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,440
Remember,
this is an FBI operation.

146
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,597
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

147
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:57,441
Excuse me, Captain.
There's something a little ripe here.
Let me-- Let me ask you a question.

148
00:17:57,527 --> 00:18:00,200
What you're asking is that
you'd like us to sit on our butts...

149
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,245
on some low-priority shit detail...

150
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:07,002
on the off chance that we're gonna run
across some ''bad people.''

151
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,363
And then what are we supposed to do?
We're supposed to give you a jingle...

152
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:13,086
so that you can make the arrest
and get the keys to the city?

153
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:17,399
Excuse me, Captain. I'm sorry.
I don't like to sound negative,
but this is bullshit.

154
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,598
I'm a cop.
You understand me?

155
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:23,520
I'm not a security guard.

156
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,519
I see some ''bad people''...

157
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:30,202
I'm gonna be a little too busy
to, uh, make a phone call.

158
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:33,085
Hope the attitude
doesn't affect the performance.

159
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,556
- Would you like to see
how this attitude--
- Are you through, Mr Lecce?

160
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,238
We'll call.

161
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:48,603
- What an asshole.
- Defiinitely.

162
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:52,043
Hey! Hey! I don't want to hear
that kind of crap.

163
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:54,561
And I don't want to hear that
someone else heard it either, got it?

164
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,560
Now, this is a 24-hour surveillance.
Jack and Phil will take the day shift.

165
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:03,402
- Chris and Bill the nights.
Same routine as last time.
- Aw,Jesus.

166
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:07,366
- Something bothering you, Mr Coldshank?
- No, no.

167
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:11,759
Don't bullshit me.
What's on your so-called mind?

168
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:16,284
Well, if it's all the same to you, sir,
uh, I'd just as soon not be on
a stake-out with them again.

169
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,517
- Hear, hear, sir.
- Why?

170
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,917
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

171
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:27,043
- Chris and Bill are slobs, sir.
No, no. No, no, no.
- The worst. The worst.

172
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:30,483
The last stake-out that Jack and I
were on with them, they never once
cleaned up after themselves.

173
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,206
- I mean, look at them. Smell them.
- Lick my left one, buddy.

174
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,198
- You left cigar butts
all over the place.
- Oh, please.

175
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:39,200
- You guys never once changed the toilet
paper. What, you don't wipe yourself?
- You are disgusting.

176
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:41,676
- You are fiilth.
- Hey, what about his dog?

177
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,964
- He let his dog
piss all over the carpet.
- Hey, that's a goddam lie!

178
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:48,323
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Don't blame it on the dog.
Phil did all the pissing.

179
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:51,763
- How'd you like me to piss on you?
- Sit down!
- You see this?
- Sit down!

180
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:54,361
- Think I broke my zipper.
- That's enough.

181
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:58,395
Now, this is not an invitation
to a prom, boys.

182
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:01,047
I don't give a shit
if you don't like the date.

183
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:04,642
Now, you gentlemen are going to
watch this broad until the fat lady
sings or I say different.

184
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:08,276
And if you fuck this up,
I'm gonna take your nuts...

185
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:11,996
and tie 'em in a knot
and run 'em through my shredder.

186
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,918
- Captain?
- Yeah?

187
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:17,397
- Phil doesn't have any nuts, sir.
- Get out. Get out. Get out.

188
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:19,682
Downwind, please. Please.

189
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:33,243
All right, that's hers.

190
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,678
And we're there.

191
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,398
Home, sweet home.

192
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:49,805
I don't know. I just hope
the place has got some heat.

193
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:53,084
- Carol's okay with all this, isn't she?
- Yeah.

194
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:57,683
Bonnie's gonna kill me if
she ever fiinds out we're gonna
be here for a couple of weeks.

195
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:01,521
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

196
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:06,118
Oh, God.

197
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:16,840
Lucy!
You got some explaining to do.

198
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:22,319
Very attractive. Yeah.
I think Jason lives here.

199
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:33,003
- What a nightmare.
- Really.

200
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:36,238
What the hell did we do
to deserve this?

201
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:39,000
I think it was that stripper
we sent to the captain on his birthday.

202
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:41,681
I told you we should have
sent the woman.

203
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,520
Yeah, I think you're right.
I screwed up.

204
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:51,837
- Hello?
- Hello, baby.

205
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,964
- Hi. Where are you?
- Well, right now,
I am freezing my butt off...

206
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,959
staring through a telescope
at a house on Speck Road.

207
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,117
Didn't anyone ever tell you
that's against the law?

208
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:02,118
- Yeah, right.
- No personal calls, no personal calls.

209
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:04,277
Chris and I got a stake-out,
the night shift.

210
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:07,837
That does it. I'm crossing
the captain off the Christmas list.

211
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,805
Yeah.

212
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,799
- Uh, Chris says hi.
- That's nice.

213
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:16,606
- So how long is this one
supposed to take?
- Couple of weeks.

214
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:20,236
A couple of weeks? Jeffrey will be
full grown next time you see him.

215
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:22,283
Yeah, I know.
I hope he remembers me.

216
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,881
All right, listen, I gotta go, okay?
All right, I love you.

217
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,527
- I love you too.
- Be good. Bye.

218
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,677
Bye-bye.

219
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,486
Pizza.

220
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,001
I think we're in luck.

221
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,647
We got every room covered,
except the bathroom.

222
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:42,005
- Hey, you know,
maybe you should call Bonnie.
- She'll only yell. I'm not in the mood.

223
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:46,478
- Well, I can call her.
You want me to call?
- No, no, no. That's okay.
I-I can call her.

224
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:50,276
I can take care of my own love life,
thank you very much. Get away. Get away.

225
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,881
She's probably in bed
with some other guy.

226
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,958
- Poor bastard.
- Poor bastard.

227
00:22:57,007 --> 00:23:01,125
- So, who we watching anyway?
- Uh, Miss Maria Guadalupe--

228
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,801
- Guadalupe.
- McGuire.

229
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:07,800
Irish-Mexican. A waitress going to night
school, but apparently not this quarter.

230
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,766
She drives a 1 980 Volkswagen.
Lives alone.

231
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:15,601
- Nothing.
- Long, brown hair. Brown eyes.

232
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:19,077
- Five-foot-six. Too tall.
- Too tall. For us anyway.

233
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,965
Oh, and the moment
we've all been waiting for--

234
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:25,596
31 3 pounds.

235
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:27,723
31 3 pounds?
Let me see that.

236
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,640
- I would imagine that's fully clothed.
- Oh, my God!

237
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:35,118
Oh, she could be the house.
This is disgusting.

238
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,879
I hate this job.

239
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:45,764
- ''They're dustin' off
the hot seat for me.''
- On the Waterfront.

240
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:49,237
- Who said it?
- Um, Lee J. Cobb.

241
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:53,082
All right, uh, 1 6th president
of the United States?

242
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:57,160
- Uh, I don't know.
- I'll give you a hint.

243
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,317
- Abe Lincoln.
- Right, right.

244
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:02,365
Okay, okay, what movie?
What movie? Um--

245
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,915
''Well, this was not
a boating accident.''

246
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:06,963
- I don't know.
- Oh, you're hopeless.

247
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:11,643
- Fifteenth president
of the United States?
- Um, I don't know. Fillmore?

248
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,683
Buchanan.
Give me another one.

249
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:16,327
- 1 980 Volkswagen, right?
- Right.

250
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:21,678
The rock's in the sock.
We got some movement, buddy.

251
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,083
This is Guadalupe?

252
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,079
Turn around.

253
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:41,402
I think she's gone on a diet.

254
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:45,765
- Are you gonna shoot pictures
or draw some from memory?
- Right, right, right,
right, right, right.

255
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:49,999
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.
Pardon me, pardon me. Excuse me.
My fault. There you go. There you go.

256
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,604
God, she's cute.

257
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:02,198
- It's 2:30.
- Better make some notes.

258
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:10,682
She's, uh, walking into the kitchen.

259
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,685
- Now she's walking across the room.
- Where's she goin'?

260
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,997
Looks to be the bedroom.

261
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:26,004
- What's she doin'?
- Uh, looks like, uh--

262
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:28,396
Like what?

263
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:31,285
Like she's undressing.

264
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:37,401
My God!

265
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:43,521
Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

266
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:46,883
- No, no, no.
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
- No! No! No! No! No!

267
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:53,880
- ''To protect and to serve.''
- Oh, oh, oh, I love my job so much.

268
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,517
Jack,Jack.
Winston, take a break.

269
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,679
- Good dog. You like that?
- What? You teach him that?

270
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,997
- That's good. That's good.
- Yesterday. Yesterday. Yeah.

271
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:41,324
Oh, sh--
Will you stop that?

272
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:44,763
Such a kid sometimes.

273
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:47,919
Oh, yeah. Finally.

274
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:52,922
She came in at 2:30 in the morning.
She hasn't been up since. Goodbye.

275
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:55,919
Just replace what you steal,
all right?

276
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:59,878
What a dump.

277
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:03,084
- Looks like your place, huh, Phil?
- Funny.

278
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:06,443
- Watch Winston, will ya?
I'm gonna go take a break.
- All right.

279
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:20,236
- It's started.
- Cute.

280
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:23,160
Very cute! Amateurs.

281
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:54,084
Are you kidding me?

282
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:25,917
Are you kidding me?

283
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:58,881
- Yeah?
- So, the answer to the quiz...

284
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:02,357
why didn't Bonnie answer the phone
is that she's moved out.

285
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:08,798
Do you know what time it is?

286
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:11,355
Yeah, I know what time it is. What do
you want to do, go back to sleep?

287
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:16,077
I already tried that.
It's too goddam light.

288
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,886
Well, then pull the shades.

289
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,118
I can't.
She took 'em.

290
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:26,996
She took the shades?

291
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,116
She paid for 'em.

292
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:33,721
Sorry I didn't get the phone.

293
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,480
All right, what do you want me to do?
Let you go back to sleep?

294
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,525
Um, no, no.

295
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:46,281
Look, there's nothing you can
do about it right now anyway.

296
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:53,965
- Did you crack the seal yet?
- Nope.

297
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,323
- Well, then, put it back.
- Okay, Dad.

298
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:03,117
Oh, oh, good news.
We, uh-- We get the phone bug tonight.

299
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:06,756
Yippee.
Kiss Carol for me.

300
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:12,920
Lower. Goodbye.

301
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:15,475
- How's Chris?
- Okay.

302
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:18,365
- And how are you?
- I'm tired.

303
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:21,917
- Tired?
- Hmm. Not that tired.

304
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:40,237
I was lookin'over your shoulder

305
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:44,917
You were next to me, oh

306
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:48,317
You ever think about
what happens after you die?

307
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:51,205
After I die? Yeah.

308
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:55,485
You know what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna be reincarnated...

309
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,206
as a judge.

310
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:01,279
All right, forget it.
Bad topic.

311
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:05,076
So, I want to get paid, right?
Figure she still has your money?

312
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:08,716
- Oh, I know she's still got my money.
- How do you know? You haven't seen her
in a year and a half.

313
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:12,117
Because she doesn't even know
she's got it.

314
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:14,243
Look, no one knows you more than me

315
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:42,006
...over to Peter's. I'm sure he'll
have some money for bail or something.

316
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,840
I-I'm gonna come over to your house now,
okay? I fjust-- No, Mom.

317
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:48,397
Mom, I'm hanging up right now,
all right? Goodbye.

318
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,396
We were born to love

319
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:00,755
- Operator.
- Operator. Yeah.
Can you give me, uh, Seattle--

320
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:03,884
I mean, um, area code 206?

321
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,362
- Yeah, what?
- Don't you ever say hello?

322
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:10,802
- You ready?
- I'm ready when you are, C.B.

323
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,082
Okay, let her answer
before you cut 'em.

324
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:27,401
I-- I don't know.

325
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:31,604
- What did you do?
- Yeah? What is it?

326
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:35,157
- Como esta, Maria?
- Hello?

327
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:38,319
- Now you're a stranger to me
- Guess who this is.

328
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:43,286
Hello? Hello? Hello?

329
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,278
Hello?

330
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:05,565
Hi. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I'm from the phone company.

331
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:07,603
Apparently there's a line problem
in the neighbourhood.

332
00:33:07,687 --> 00:33:09,917
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Isn't there something wrong
with your phone?

333
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:13,682
Yeah, my phone's dead. I just
can't believe you're already here.

334
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:19,125
Oh, well, we got a lot of calls,
you know. Whole neighbourhood's down.

335
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:24,042
Well, um, you know, it's really
not a very good time for me right now.
I have to be going.

336
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,561
I understand, I understand. I-It would
only take a couple of minutes.

337
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:30,356
- But if it would be a lot easier,
I guess we could come back next week.
- Uh, wait a minute.

338
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:36,082
I'll bet if I don't have it
fiixed now, it'll be another
couple of weeks or something?

339
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:40,126
- No! No, no. Five days max.
- Five days?

340
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:43,279
Come on, Maria.
How can you resist him?

341
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:47,319
- Okay, if it doesn't take too long,
come on in.
- All right. Be out of your way
in just a second.

342
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:50,126
- Bingo.
- There we go.

343
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:52,767
Not bad for an old fart.

344
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:58,120
- There's one phone over there
and another in the bedroom.
- Okey-dokey.

345
00:33:58,207 --> 00:34:01,005
- Be out of your way as fast as I can.
- Okay.

346
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,398
Hi, sailor.

347
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:27,845
She's in the bedroom tidying up,
trying to make a good impression.

348
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:33,402
Oops, don't look under the bed.

349
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:36,206
Okay, okay,
now she's comin'back.

350
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:41,637
Okay, all checked out here.

351
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:43,843
- Want to show me the next one?
- Sure.

352
00:34:57,047 --> 00:35:00,756
Hi. And now a word
from our sponsors.

353
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:03,441
She's, uh, in the kitchen,
just in case you were wondering.

354
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,961
What's that?

355
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:25,200
Now is no time to be pausing
for the news, Chris.

356
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,444
W-What are you doin'?
Where you goin'?

357
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:36,317
Chris, she is in the house.
Stop screwing around, for Christ's sake.

358
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:39,285
If you blow this
and we get busted--

359
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:43,918
God damn it, Chris. Come on.
Stop messing around.

360
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:47,636
Chris, she--
She's right there, for Christ's sake.

361
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:50,400
Chris. Chris, she's comin'.
Chris, she's comin'. She's comin'!

362
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:54,196
Chris, God damn it!
Jesus Christ!

363
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:57,245
Look, I really can't wait any more.
Uh, I'm sorry.

364
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:01,558
- Problem?
- Uh, my--

365
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:05,401
My brother is in a lot
of trouble right now. He's down
with the police at the station.

366
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:08,285
And there's bail
I have to take care of and I--

367
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:11,040
- Something serious?
- Yeah, I think it is.

368
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,038
Could you come back
tomorrow maybe or--

369
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:15,766
- I'm done.
- It's fiixed?

370
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:18,077
Well, the problem isn't in the phone.
I think it's out on the pole.

371
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:22,001
- I'm gonna have to check outside.
- Oh.

372
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:26,599
Well, thanks a lot.

373
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:31,765
I'm in love, Bill.

374
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:35,806
I'm leaving you.
It happens to one out of every six men.

375
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:39,004
I have to face up
to my heterosexuality.

376
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:42,045
But don't worry.
You'll be well provided for.

377
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,118
What the hell were you doin'?

378
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:46,641
What do you mean,
what was I doin'? I was putting
in a bug, for crying out loud.

379
00:36:46,727 --> 00:36:51,357
Oh, really? Is that what that was? Huh?
Well, I don't call goin' through that
woman's drawers puttin' in a goddam bug.

380
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:55,884
Oh, calm down.
Don't blow a bowel, okay?

381
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,925
For crying out loud.
I thought I saw something...

382
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:02,602
in her bureau that would tell us whether
or not she talked to Montgomery.

383
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,365
Yeah, she's gone.

384
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:12,235
Give me the flashlight. I'm gonna
go back in there and check it out.

385
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:16,479
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no.

386
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,127
- No?
- No! Chris, this is the feds' party.

387
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:22,882
I am not gonna get my ass canned
for illegal procedure.

388
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:27,757
''This is the feds' party.
I'm not gonna get my ass canned
for illegal procedure.''

389
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:31,476
Give me the goddam flashlight!
And nothing's gonna happen to you.

390
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:34,957
The worst thing that they could
do to you is that they could
suspend you for, what, three years?

391
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,275
Oh, that's great.

392
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,880
I'm kidding!Jesus, man,
nobody knows when I'm kidding.

393
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:43,400
I'm only making a little joke,
a little humour.

394
00:37:43,486 --> 00:37:45,283
What a boner.

395
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:58,720
- You there?
- You in?

396
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:02,082
- I'm in.
- Then hurry up.

397
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:19,517
Car!

398
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:25,922
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

399
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:28,520
You're sorry?
You're making me very nervous.

400
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,166
Oh, I'm making you nervous?
That's a hoot.

401
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:45,118
Okay, I think I got something
real important here.

402
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,277
A bunch of letters here
all from Montgomery...

403
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:52,723
and, uh, the last one dated
about four months ago.

404
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:56,481
''Dear Maria--
First you stop coming to visit me...

405
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:59,160
and now you won't
even answer my letters.

406
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:03,364
I understand you're lonely.
I hear you're seeing a couple of guys.

407
00:39:03,446 --> 00:39:08,201
Sometimes I get so mad that I could
wipe out a whole planet...

408
00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:10,720
and enjoy myself doing it.''

409
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,559
Now, how could she have dumped
a charmer like him?

410
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:20,203
All right, take this down.
I think we got something to check out.

411
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:22,720
He-- He apparently has a buddy...

412
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:26,685
with the initials ''B.C. ''
right here in Seattle.

413
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:28,916
Seems to work on the docks.

414
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:33,796
Uh, now he's talking to her
about some furniture...

415
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:36,480
he bought her for a present.

416
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:38,636
Does she still have it?

417
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:42,924
Apparently he got it for her birthday.
It's very important to him.

418
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:50,281
- Holy shit!
- What?

419
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:53,358
Get out of the house.
Get out of the fucking house, man.

420
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:55,357
She's right there.
She's at the stairs!

421
00:39:58,806 --> 00:40:02,003
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you.
Get out of the house!

422
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,279
Come on, Chris.

423
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:17,722
What are you, crazy?

424
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:19,797
At night

425
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:23,322
When you turn off all the lights

426
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:27,001
There's no place that you can hide

427
00:41:27,086 --> 00:41:30,601
No, no
The rhythm is gonna get you

428
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:35,918
Rhythm is gonna get you
Rhythm is gonna get you

429
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:40,238
- What is going on in there?
- Rhythm is gonna get you

430
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,886
- Where the hell are you?
- Rhythm is gonna get you

431
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:45,763
Tonight

432
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:57,397
Rhythm is gonna get you

433
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:02,675
Tonight

434
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:05,845
Jesus!

435
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:28,875
Sergeant Bernie?
Yeah, this is Chris Lecce.

436
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:31,400
I'm fiine. Fine. How are you?

437
00:42:31,486 --> 00:42:36,037
Great. I want you to run a make
on a guy named Reynaldo McGuire.

438
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:39,277
Yeah, fiind out any priors,
anything at all.

439
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:40,958
Thanks.

440
00:42:41,046 --> 00:42:43,719
Oh, just enjoying my day off.

441
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:45,717
Bye.

442
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,357
Oh, come on.
There is no way, Chris.

443
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:53,518
- There is no way that one bullet
could have done all that damage
and ended up intact.
- No way? No way?

444
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:58,316
- What does ''no way'' mean?
- One bullet came from the grassy knoll,
the other from the Texas Schoolbook
Depository. How naive can you be?

445
00:42:58,406 --> 00:43:01,557
Oh, so you think that
the chief justice of the United States
lied, is that right?

446
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:04,718
That Gerald Ford and all
those other people lied?

447
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:06,762
- Those bastards.
- What?

448
00:43:06,846 --> 00:43:10,725
Well, they ate everything
and left us a goddam dog turd.

449
00:43:10,806 --> 00:43:13,843
- Earl Warren left us a dog turd?
- No, Phil and Jack.

450
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:16,998
Why do you care about all this stuff?
You were fiive years old
when it happened.

451
00:43:17,086 --> 00:43:19,725
- Who gives a shit?
- I'm gonna get those guys, man. I don't
know how yet, but I'm gonna get them.

452
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,445
Give me the keys to the car.
I'm gonna go to the supermarket.
What do you want?

453
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:25,484
- How about some truth and justice?
- What else?

454
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:29,684
- Doughnuts.
- Why not? We're cops.

455
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:53,197
- Hi.
- Hi.
- The phone man, right?

456
00:43:53,286 --> 00:43:57,757
- Right, right. How's your phone?
- Still works.
You live in the neighbourhood?

457
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:01,725
- No, no, I was in the area working.
- More lines down?

458
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,524
Always.

459
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:08,396
So you, uh-- you satisfiied
with the phone system, are you?
You don't need anything else installed?

460
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:11,558
Any trimline or videophone
or anything at all?

461
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:14,365
- You really are a phone man,
aren't you?
- Why do you say that?

462
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:17,404
You're still working on another line.
Get it?

463
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,761
- Got it.
- Good.
- Sixteen thirteen.

464
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:27,764
- Hope your phone breaks real soon.
- Promise you'll fiix it if it does?

465
00:44:27,846 --> 00:44:30,644
I promise.

466
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:32,523
Bye.

467
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,118
Eating in between meals?

468
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:40,357
''Eating in between meals?''

469
00:44:57,526 --> 00:45:00,040
Wait a minute. Don't go!

470
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:02,720
Oh, shit.

471
00:45:02,806 --> 00:45:04,956
You wouldn't be headed
in my direction, would you?

472
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:07,799
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

473
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:13,761
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, Bill.
- Bill.
- Bill.
- Bill.

474
00:45:13,846 --> 00:45:15,837
- I'm Maria.
- Hi.

475
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:18,804
Hi. Can I make you a trade?
A cup of coffee for a ride home?

476
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:23,004
My bike has a stupid flat, and it's
only getting ready to rain, and I--

477
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:25,236
Well, uh, um--

478
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:30,195
- Please?
- Yeah, yeah, what the hell.

479
00:45:30,286 --> 00:45:33,517
- Okay, thank you.
- We'll put it in the trunk. Come on.

480
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:48,195
I don't believe this.

481
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:17,681
- Yeah.
- Hi.

482
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:22,357
- I'm gonna be a little late.
- No, no, no, no, take your time.

483
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,040
No, no, I stopped off
for a cup of coffee.

484
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:27,276
Well, uh, then have two cups.

485
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:30,005
Nothing going on here.
Just some dull old police work.

486
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:34,477
Great, great. Tell me, uh,
how's that forklift coming?

487
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:41,639
- I'll be about a half hour.
- Where are my doughnuts, you prick?

488
00:46:41,726 --> 00:46:43,523
Maybe more.

489
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:52,717
You really are a nice guy,
aren't you?

490
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:55,764
- Don't say that!
- Why? You are.

491
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,838
You gave me a ride home.
You're unpacking my groceries.

492
00:46:58,926 --> 00:47:01,724
You fiixed my phone.
You're nice.

493
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:05,640
I know, I know, I know.
I'm nice. I'm nice. I hate that.

494
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:08,115
It's a curse.

495
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,562
It's like ''medium.''

496
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:16,639
I always wanted to be bad.

497
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:19,365
Uh, these go in the sack.

498
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:21,676
You think bad is good?

499
00:47:21,766 --> 00:47:24,041
Well, yeah. I always wanted
a little bad, you know?

500
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:26,117
I thought it would make
my nice better.

501
00:47:28,406 --> 00:47:31,842
Let me tell you something.
Bad isn't all it's cracked up to be.

502
00:47:33,446 --> 00:47:37,883
Bad is bad, and I think right now
I'd settle for a little nice.

503
00:47:39,006 --> 00:47:40,883
I think.

504
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:47,076
What are we talking about?

505
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:51,440
Dinner.

506
00:47:51,526 --> 00:47:53,323
Do you like Mexican food?

507
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:57,718
I made this mean camarones veracruzanos.
You like spicy?

508
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:03,684
I love spicy.

509
00:48:03,766 --> 00:48:07,361
Good. Well, then, you're gonna
want to marry me after this.

510
00:48:11,886 --> 00:48:14,081
Oh, Chris.

511
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,316
For crying out loud.

512
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:22,677
Oh, yeah.

513
00:48:25,366 --> 00:48:28,403
We could be so hot together

514
00:48:28,486 --> 00:48:30,397
Hot together

515
00:48:32,486 --> 00:48:36,274
We could be so hot together

516
00:48:36,366 --> 00:48:38,926
Together

517
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:43,363
- Aw, this is ridiculous.
- We happened to be at the same party

518
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:48,474
- We left it up to chance
- I'm gonna kill him.

519
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:52,878
I was born on the Day of the Dead,
see, and it's a very big deal
in Latino cultures.

520
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:57,244
They want it to make fun of death and
to take it seriously at the same time.

521
00:48:57,326 --> 00:49:00,204
So every year
as long as I can remember...

522
00:49:00,286 --> 00:49:03,881
someone in my family's always given me
some kind of skeleton on my birthday.

523
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:07,641
And now I've got this full graveyard.

524
00:49:07,726 --> 00:49:09,876
We could be so hot
Hot together

525
00:49:09,966 --> 00:49:12,321
Got a big family?

526
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:15,045
My younger brother still lives
at home with my mom except this week...

527
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:18,402
and I've got a ton of relatives
in Veracruz.

528
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:23,082
About your brother-- I, uh--
I happen to know a couple of cops.

529
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:26,397
I could ask around, you know,
fiind out what's going on.

530
00:49:26,486 --> 00:49:30,001
- You think they'd tell you?
- Yeah, if they want
their phones to work.

531
00:49:30,086 --> 00:49:34,443
Oh, that would be nice. Oh, God.
I'm sorry. There's that word again.

532
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:42,164
God, I like your smile.

533
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:46,956
Excuse me.
I must be kind of drunk.

534
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:55,035
- Maria, let me ask you something.
- What, Mr Bill?

535
00:49:57,326 --> 00:50:00,796
How come you know so much
about what's bad?

536
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:04,960
Well...

537
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:10,325
there was this man once,
and he was violent and crazy...

538
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:13,842
and dangerous, and I--

539
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:16,360
I was insane.

540
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,199
I was insane because
I was with him for a while.

541
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:21,356
It's all over now.

542
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:25,157
Did you love him?

543
00:50:27,286 --> 00:50:30,642
I was crazy, I think.

544
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:33,559
- Where is he now?
- Why do you ask?

545
00:50:35,326 --> 00:50:37,681
Why do you think?

546
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:48,361
- I think I have to go.
- Yeah, me too. I've got the late shift.

547
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,518
No, no, no, leave them.
I'll do them in a couple of years.

548
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:58,915
You want to know what
the best thing you said tonight was?

549
00:50:59,006 --> 00:51:00,917
What?

550
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:04,442
- That you liked my smile.
- Oh.

551
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:07,916
I know, I know, I know.
I'm nice. I know.

552
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,276
I'm not that nice.

553
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:22,557
Honey, I'm home.

554
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:26,441
I bumped into her
at the goddam store.

555
00:51:26,526 --> 00:51:29,723
What was I supposed to do,
pretend that I'd never seen her before?

556
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:38,124
Anyway, we're supposed to be watching
the house, right? So I was watching
the house from the inside.

557
00:51:39,886 --> 00:51:42,320
Nothing. Here are your doughnuts.
Here. I didn't eat one of them.

558
00:51:42,406 --> 00:51:45,398
There's a glaze on it and everything.
I got you some Pringles and some Oreos.

559
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:47,636
You, uh, gonna get together
with her again?

560
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:50,559
- Maybe go to see a movie maybe?
- Oh, give me a break. Come on.
Hey, she made me some dinner.

561
00:51:50,646 --> 00:51:52,876
- That was it.
- Nothing more?

562
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:56,358
Nothing more.

563
00:51:57,606 --> 00:52:00,564
Okay, Mr Liar.

564
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:03,638
Sergeant Bernie called,
said that Reynaldo McGuire...

565
00:52:03,726 --> 00:52:06,604
was arrested on the 1 7th
for a GTA.

566
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:08,677
Wouldn't just happen to be
any relation, would it?

567
00:52:08,766 --> 00:52:12,759
Give me a break, will you?
She told me her brother was in jail.

568
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:15,155
I checked it out.
I thought it was a lead.

569
00:52:15,246 --> 00:52:18,318
- A lead?
- Yeah. A lead.

570
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:22,399
Okay. Fine. You tell me you're checking
out a lead, I'm gonna believe you're--

571
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:24,522
Checking out a lead.

572
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:26,756
I realize this is a shit detail.

573
00:52:26,846 --> 00:52:30,475
Oh, boy. I mean, can we talk, you know?
Nobody's really gonna care what we do.

574
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:32,636
- Bottom of the barrel.
- Right.

575
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:37,322
But I would appreciate that you not
act like a walking hard-on
while we're working together.

576
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,397
Excuse me.

577
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:43,884
Succinctly put.

578
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:59,446
All the money
in the cash register right now.

579
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:03,560
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

580
00:53:05,886 --> 00:53:08,878
Reach me up and get me
a hunting knife, would you, please?

581
00:53:29,446 --> 00:53:31,835
Sorry, buddy, we're closed.

582
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:50,639
- Seventy-two.
- What do we got? What do we got?

583
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,842
- Two seventy-three.
- All right. That's plenty, man.

584
00:53:52,926 --> 00:53:54,917
That's all we need.
All we need is gas money.

585
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:58,043
- Yeah, it's hardly worth
rubbing people out for.
- What?

586
00:53:58,126 --> 00:54:00,242
Nothin'.

587
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:12,044
What did I do now?

588
00:54:12,126 --> 00:54:14,242
Reynaldo, right?

589
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:16,886
Ray.

590
00:54:16,966 --> 00:54:20,481
I heard you got yourself
into a little trouble.

591
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:22,955
You a cop?

592
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:26,083
- You a criminal?
- No.

593
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,555
This girl's father's got it in for me.

594
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:31,479
He does, huh?

595
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:33,284
Why?

596
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:36,039
He doesn't want me
seeing his daughter.

597
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:40,922
- She's pretty precious, huh?
- Yeah.

598
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:44,805
So why'd you hot-wire the car?

599
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:48,480
We thought it'd be okay.

600
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:52,761
I was stupid.

601
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:58,163
It's not very pleasant
being in here, is it?

602
00:54:58,246 --> 00:55:00,919
Why do you care?

603
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,794
I just want to fiind out what kind
of a guy you are before I get you out.

604
00:55:07,126 --> 00:55:11,119
Get me out. I can't take
another night in this place.

605
00:55:13,566 --> 00:55:16,205
You like to work with your hands?

606
00:55:16,286 --> 00:55:19,596
I got a job here, construction.
Starts Monday morning, 7:30 to 5:00.

607
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:23,122
Five days a week.
Got to be home every night.

608
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:25,766
That's the deal.

609
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:27,916
Every night.

610
00:55:28,006 --> 00:55:30,566
Take it and you're out of here.

611
00:55:30,646 --> 00:55:33,763
Mess with me and you're right back in.
What do you say?

612
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:36,121
Deal.

613
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,957
Okay.

614
00:55:48,006 --> 00:55:50,600
What rock did they fiind you under?

615
00:55:52,606 --> 00:55:56,758
Anything I can do to make your
stay here more pleasant, buddy,
you just let me know.

616
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:11,482
- Great.
- Hey, Lecce, I want to talk to you.

617
00:56:14,566 --> 00:56:17,683
- You should be getting some sleep.
What are you doing?
- I heard you wanted to talk to me.

618
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:22,840
Yeah, a couple of cops sitting
on a stake-out in fourth precinct
just got caught on a procedure.

619
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:25,998
Seems they got overanxious,
blew their cover.

620
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:29,044
I don't want this to happen here.
You pass it on.

621
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:32,323
- No funny stuff.
- No funny stuff. Okay, got it.
- Right. Right.

622
00:56:32,406 --> 00:56:34,442
Okay, you got it. You got it.
No funny stuff.

623
00:56:34,526 --> 00:56:36,642
Excuse me!
Bill, how are you?

624
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,796
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- What are you doing here?

625
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:43,004
Well, I just had, uh, a, uh, you know.
No, no, no, what are you doing here?

626
00:56:43,086 --> 00:56:46,442
- I heard you were
supposed to be at work.
- Well, I was, but they let me off early
so I could see my brother.

627
00:56:46,526 --> 00:56:50,838
- You know, they only have
certain hours here, and--
- Hey, fiishman.

628
00:56:50,926 --> 00:56:53,884
One day we dance again, okay?

629
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:58,403
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, no, no. He's just a funny friend.
- Hey, Chris.

630
00:56:58,486 --> 00:57:00,636
Listen, this is a really bad time
to talk to me. Could I--

631
00:57:00,726 --> 00:57:03,320
Could I call you up, give you a call?
I gotta make a couple of calls.

632
00:57:03,406 --> 00:57:07,558
And after I make those calls,
we'll probably, you know,
make-- call you after.

633
00:57:28,246 --> 00:57:30,441
Come on. Come on.

634
00:57:50,646 --> 00:57:53,399
- Great.
- Hey, fellas. What do you got?

635
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:56,159
Uh, the usual.
Logged fiive calls today.

636
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:59,204
One from Gail, some friend of hers
that just had a fiight with her husband.

637
00:57:59,286 --> 00:58:02,164
And one from her mother about
a recipe for some sort of shrimp dish.

638
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:04,237
Oh, a recipe, huh?
Good, good.

639
00:58:04,326 --> 00:58:06,442
At least my wife
will get something out of this.

640
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,676
- She over there now?
- She been gone a couple of hours.

641
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:11,121
This recorder took a dump.
You gotta pick up a new one.

642
00:58:11,206 --> 00:58:13,481
- Come on, Winston.
- Good night, gentlemen.

643
00:58:13,566 --> 00:58:15,477
Good night.

644
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:22,514
Come on.
Let's get the hell out of here.

645
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:41,035
Winston!
Chris, you son of a bitch!

646
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:45,085
- Winston!
- This is not funny!

647
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:58,836
- You are really something,
you know that? You keep me young.
- You like that?

648
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:02,157
- Yeah.
- Listen, the recorder's totally shot,
so I gotta go pick up a new one.

649
00:59:02,246 --> 00:59:04,601
- All right.
- Leave it to Phil and Jack, right?
- How long will you be gone?

650
00:59:04,686 --> 00:59:07,359
- About an hour.
- Okay, I'll see you then.

651
00:59:10,686 --> 00:59:13,359
Jesus, they're immature!

652
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:26,997
Come on.

653
00:59:28,846 --> 00:59:33,556
- How much longer, man?
- Finished. This carburettor sucks.

654
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:38,083
- It's as useful as a diet crouton.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

655
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:50,996
Think about it
There must be higher love

656
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:57,556
Really no trick
to this, you know.

657
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:59,841
You're just gonna call her up
on the phone and tell her that
you can't see her any more.

658
00:59:59,926 --> 01:00:03,885
It's really as simple as that.

659
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:07,879
It's as simple as that.
Not gonna ruin your career.

660
01:00:19,606 --> 01:00:21,517
- Hello?
- Hello.

661
01:00:21,606 --> 01:00:25,155
It's, uh, uh, Bill.

662
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:28,761
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm okay. Look, the reason I called--

663
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:31,565
Uh, there are some things that
you and I have to get straight here.

664
01:00:31,646 --> 01:00:34,683
- You know, I have very good taste.
- Pardon me?

665
01:00:34,766 --> 01:00:37,439
Yeah, I've got good taste in food,
I've got good taste in music...

666
01:00:37,526 --> 01:00:39,835
but most of all I've got
great taste in men.

667
01:00:39,926 --> 01:00:43,680
I'm not quite sure
what we're talking about.

668
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:47,679
I'm talking about you.
What you did for my brother Ray,
what you did for me.

669
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:50,963
Oh, oh, that.

670
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:55,881
''Oh, that. '' What do you mean,
''Oh, that''? It was a very good thing,
what you and your police friend did.

671
01:00:55,966 --> 01:00:58,639
My brother's out offjail.
He's got a new fjob.

672
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:02,878
My mother wants to marry you.
My brother wants to marry you.

673
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:05,241
Yeah?
What about you?

674
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:10,841
- Maria?
- Yes?

675
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:13,838
Uh, wait.
Uh, uh, wait a minute.

676
01:01:13,926 --> 01:01:17,157
- Uh, could you hold on just a second?
- Sure.
- Thank you.

677
01:01:17,246 --> 01:01:19,919
Don't be such a wuss!

678
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:27,162
Look, Maria, there are things
about me that you don't know.

679
01:01:27,246 --> 01:01:30,204
Well, there are things you
don't know about me either.
Isn't that why people go out?

680
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:34,404
Yeah, yeah, they do. But th-th-there
are things about me that I--

681
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:37,796
- That I can't tell you.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

682
01:01:37,886 --> 01:01:40,878
- Kind of.
- With the law?

683
01:01:40,966 --> 01:01:43,355
Uh, in a way.
Look, your food is burning.

684
01:01:43,446 --> 01:01:46,677
- Your-your-your food is, uh--
- Shit!

685
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:49,277
God!

686
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:57,165
- How'd you know her food was burning?
- How'd you know my food was burning?

687
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:03,315
- Pardon me?
- My food was burning. How did you know?
You psychic or something?

688
01:02:03,406 --> 01:02:07,763
No, no, I'm not psychic.
I-- I heard the sizzling behind you.

689
01:02:09,286 --> 01:02:13,325
Oh. You have pretty good ears.
Yeah.

690
01:02:13,406 --> 01:02:15,601
Look, Maria...

691
01:02:16,806 --> 01:02:19,718
I just can't see you for a while.

692
01:02:21,086 --> 01:02:24,283
You-- You don't want to see--

693
01:02:27,806 --> 01:02:31,799
Look, this-- this really isn't
a very good time right now.

694
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:35,999
I-I-I have to be at work
in half an hour, so could you
give me your number?

695
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,395
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- My home number?

696
01:02:38,486 --> 01:02:40,477
Yeah. You do have a phone, don't you?

697
01:02:40,566 --> 01:02:42,875
Yeah. Yeah, what do you think?

698
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:45,321
Of course I got a phone,
but I'm-- I'm hardly ever there.

699
01:02:45,406 --> 01:02:49,399
- Then I'll call you at the office.
- No, no, no, no, I'm hardly ever there.

700
01:02:49,486 --> 01:02:54,037
All right, um, home is better.
555-5050.

701
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:58,723
Yeah. Okay, okay.

702
01:02:58,806 --> 01:03:01,161
Okay, okay.

703
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:05,124
- Everything okay?
- Okay.

704
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:19,403
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Maria.

705
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:22,716
Hi.

706
01:03:22,806 --> 01:03:24,876
Hi.
What's wrong?

707
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:27,161
Did I wake you?

708
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:30,682
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

709
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:33,599
- Where are you?
- I'm at home.
Now, you listen to me, fella.

710
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:37,201
Just because you said you're having
a little bit of trouble doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you off the hook.

711
01:03:37,286 --> 01:03:39,402
Holy shit!

712
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,835
- I can't talk now.
-Are you all right?

713
01:03:51,926 --> 01:03:55,396
- I have to call you back.
- What is it? Is it the police?

714
01:03:55,486 --> 01:03:57,238
Hello? Bill?

715
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:06,761
- Bill.
- Bill.

716
01:04:28,846 --> 01:04:31,121
Fifteen minutes early.
Must be some kind of record.

717
01:04:31,206 --> 01:04:33,276
So, everything okay?
What's up?

718
01:04:33,366 --> 01:04:35,675
- Got a phone call today.
- Oh, yeah? New recipe?

719
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:39,122
Uh-uh. Guy named Bill.

720
01:04:39,206 --> 01:04:41,879
Hey, let me see. Okay, I'll take
this downtown, check it out.

721
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:44,002
Uh-uh. We will take this downtown.

722
01:04:44,086 --> 01:04:46,202
Tried to disguise his voice,
but I think it was Montgomery.

723
01:04:46,286 --> 01:04:50,279
Nap time's over, boys.
Better keep your eyes open tonight.

724
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:54,359
- Come on.
- Bill?
- Come on.

725
01:04:54,446 --> 01:04:56,482
Good night, gentlemen.

726
01:04:56,566 --> 01:04:59,797
Those bastards, man. I smell a rat.
They are up to something.

727
01:04:59,886 --> 01:05:02,764
I don't know what it is yet,
but they're up to something.

728
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:05,280
I'm gonna fiind out, though.

729
01:05:05,366 --> 01:05:07,357
You know what it is?

730
01:05:08,406 --> 01:05:11,204
Yeah. Yeah, I have
a pretty good idea what it is.

731
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:13,277
What? What? Tell me.

732
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:23,283
Son of a bitch!

733
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:25,596
Christ, I am gonna kill them!

734
01:05:51,086 --> 01:05:54,283
-Just let me in for a minute.
- She's not here. Tony!
- Get out of the way.

735
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:57,915
- Cover me! Armed man
going into her house!
- What?

736
01:06:01,406 --> 01:06:05,399
- Gail? Oh, Gail?
- Tony, I haven't seen her
in a long time.

737
01:06:05,486 --> 01:06:08,683
Gail's here. Gail, where are you?
Shut up, Maria. Every goddam time!

738
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:13,920
- Get your goddam hands off me,
you son of a bitch!
- It's not our guy.

739
01:06:14,006 --> 01:06:19,160
- Get out of my house!
- I never thought I'd hit a woman,
but-- Ow!Jeez, ouch!

740
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:21,923
Oh, for crying out loud.

741
01:06:22,006 --> 01:06:24,884
Every time something happens,
we end up fucking it up,
and she comes over here!

742
01:06:24,966 --> 01:06:27,355
- Stop it!
- Tell me where that--
Every time something goes wrong--

743
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,835
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
She's not here.
- Anybody home?

744
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:33,717
Gee, I, uh--
You left the door open.

745
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:36,445
- Bill!
- Who the fuck are you?

746
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:39,518
I'm a friend of Maria's.
I came over for dinner.

747
01:06:39,606 --> 01:06:42,040
- What's up?
- I'm looking for my wife.

748
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:44,640
- Where'd you leave her, pal?
- She's here.

749
01:06:44,726 --> 01:06:48,685
- He thinks he can barge right in here.
- She ran out. She's hiding!

750
01:06:48,766 --> 01:06:51,075
- Is she here?
- No. That's what I've been
trying to tell him.

751
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,760
I think maybe you made a mistake.
What do you say, pal?

752
01:06:53,846 --> 01:06:56,485
Go to hell!

753
01:06:56,566 --> 01:06:59,558
Let's call the cops.
I want him out of my house!
I want you to call the cops.

754
01:06:59,646 --> 01:07:04,037
Why don't I help you look for her?
Huh? What do you say? Hey, Gail! Gail!

755
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:07,241
Oh, gee, I'm real sorry.

756
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:09,715
Just relax. Calm down.
Now, there's a chair right behind you.

757
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:12,081
When I lift you up, you're gonna
put your ass right down in that chair.

758
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:14,043
All right? One--

759
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:22,522
We're doing okay.
We're doing just fiine.

760
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:25,757
Now, your knee is bad, huh?
That's it.Just relax.

761
01:07:25,846 --> 01:07:29,077
We'll get you some ice for the knee,
and we'll get you some aspirin
for your head, okay?

762
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:32,158
- Could we have some aspirin?
And some ice.
- Yeah.

763
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:35,556
We're doing okay.
We're doing fiine.

764
01:07:35,646 --> 01:07:38,683
Now, I don't think it would be
a very good idea for you
to talk to Gail right now, because...

765
01:07:38,766 --> 01:07:42,805
you've been drinking,
and you say pretty mean things
when you've been drinking, right?

766
01:07:45,446 --> 01:07:47,960
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

767
01:07:49,726 --> 01:07:52,081
- What's your drink?
- Little rye and Coke.

768
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:55,875
Rye and Coke?
That used to be my drink.

769
01:07:55,966 --> 01:08:00,084
Give me your hand. Yeah,
I used to get these diamond splinter
headaches right between my eyes.

770
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:04,079
Right there. It was murderous.
You ever get those things?

771
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,316
- No.
- No?

772
01:08:06,406 --> 01:08:09,045
Well, I guess it must
have been me, huh?

773
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:13,954
We're doing okay.
We're doing fiine.

774
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:17,197
- How about some coffee?
- Yeah, coffee's good.

775
01:08:17,286 --> 01:08:21,245
Yeah, we'll have some coffee,
we'll calm down, talk about Gail.

776
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:24,443
- Can we have some coffee please?
- Sure.

777
01:08:41,286 --> 01:08:45,120
- I'm impressed.
- I was just in the neighbourhood.

778
01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:48,198
I'm beginning to like
this neighbourhood more and more.

779
01:08:49,406 --> 01:08:52,443
I was a little worried
after that phone call.

780
01:08:52,526 --> 01:08:55,802
Yeah, yeah, well,
I was kind of out of it...

781
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:58,161
but, uh, I guess this
isn't the best time, eh?

782
01:08:58,246 --> 01:09:00,806
Uh-uh. A date's a date.

783
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:04,481
Oh, look, Maria, I'm--
I'm really involved--

784
01:09:04,566 --> 01:09:08,923
There's nothing to fear
Baby, now that you're near me

785
01:09:09,006 --> 01:09:13,124
I've never seen anything so clearly

786
01:09:16,006 --> 01:09:21,034
- Oh, boy.
- This night was made for one thing only

787
01:09:21,126 --> 01:09:25,244
To come as close as we can come

788
01:09:25,326 --> 01:09:29,114
This night was made
for one thing only

789
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:34,599
It's such a change
Someone nice like you

790
01:09:34,686 --> 01:09:36,597
Oh, boy.

791
01:09:38,206 --> 01:09:41,084
I'm in over my head here.

792
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:43,760
- Stay with me.
- Maria--

793
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:48,075
You don't want me
to break my phone, do you?

794
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:51,238
If I do, they'll send
somebody else here.

795
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:56,045
We've gotta keep rising

796
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,162
And never let go

797
01:09:58,246 --> 01:10:02,922
I won't ever let you say goodbye

798
01:10:03,006 --> 01:10:05,236
Oh, Bill.

799
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:09,797
- Fuck Bill.
- This night was made for one thing only

800
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:13,925
- To come as close as we can come
- So let it begin

801
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:16,645
This night was made
for one thing only

802
01:10:16,726 --> 01:10:20,765
- Never let go
- To come as close as we can come

803
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:24,600
- Where do we begin
- Begin

804
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:28,725
- You could fjust hold me
- Just hold me

805
01:10:28,806 --> 01:10:32,640
- Where do we begin
- Where do we begin

806
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:36,765
- You could fjust hold me
- You could fjust hold me

807
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:39,440
Where do we begin

808
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:05,357
God!

809
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:39,802
I had a bad dream.

810
01:12:43,046 --> 01:12:46,083
Oh, scary monsters.

811
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:48,441
Where'd they get you?
Here?

812
01:12:48,526 --> 01:12:50,482
Here.

813
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,397
Here?

814
01:13:19,006 --> 01:13:21,804
- What time is it?
- Seven thirty. What--

815
01:13:21,886 --> 01:13:24,036
Jesus Christ!

816
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:28,519
What's wrong?

817
01:13:28,606 --> 01:13:30,881
- It's morning.
- Are you gonna be late for work?

818
01:13:30,966 --> 01:13:34,276
- Uh-huh.
- Could you call and tell them
you'll be a little late, maybe?

819
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:36,641
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- No?

820
01:13:43,606 --> 01:13:47,155
- Listen, uh, you think
you could lend me a hat?
- A hat?

821
01:13:47,246 --> 01:13:51,842
Yeah, yeah, a hat. I got this really bad
skin condition, and it's very dangerous
for me to go out in the sun.

822
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:53,917
- Like a rash?
- Yeah, yeah, like a rash.

823
01:13:54,006 --> 01:13:58,318
- It's-- It's-- But it's worse.
- Oh. Is this one of the things
you don't want to tell me about?

824
01:13:58,406 --> 01:14:02,365
No, no, no, no, it's nothing, really.
It's nothing serious.

825
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:12,444
I'm not sure it's your colour.

826
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:16,317
Seems perfectly fiine.

827
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:21,519
- Much better.
- Thank you.

828
01:14:21,606 --> 01:14:25,155
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

829
01:14:26,526 --> 01:14:30,314
I really got you
thinking now, don't I?

830
01:14:30,406 --> 01:14:32,795
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

831
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:35,923
- Could I borrow this?
- It's yours.

832
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:46,882
What are you waving at, huh?
Huh? Who you waving at?

833
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:52,758
Hey,Jack.Jack! This may be him.
Get on that horn, eh?

834
01:14:52,846 --> 01:14:55,155
- Oh, right.
- Get on that horn.

835
01:14:57,686 --> 01:14:59,677
Lynn,Jack Pismo,
Speck Road stake-out.

836
01:14:59,766 --> 01:15:01,677
We have a man
running from the house.

837
01:15:01,766 --> 01:15:03,677
Caucasian, about fiive-ten.

838
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:06,360
Jeans, jacket, pink hat,
and he's heading south.

839
01:15:06,446 --> 01:15:10,075
Caucasian, fiive-ten, jeans,
jacket, pink hat?

840
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:12,885
Yeah, pink hat and a shawl.
He's heading south.

841
01:15:15,006 --> 01:15:17,884
- Excuse me. My fault. My fault. Sorry.
- What are you doing?

842
01:15:39,406 --> 01:15:41,078
No, no, back it up!

843
01:15:44,126 --> 01:15:46,481
Asshole.

844
01:16:51,646 --> 01:16:53,841
Get away from me!
Get down!

845
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:56,679
Get away from me!
Down!

846
01:17:10,486 --> 01:17:13,284
Come on, come on!
Get in!

847
01:17:29,766 --> 01:17:31,961
Did we, uh, practise safe sex?

848
01:17:37,006 --> 01:17:39,804
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Maria.

849
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:44,721
- Hi. Hi. What's wrong?
- Did I wake you?

850
01:17:44,806 --> 01:17:48,242
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

851
01:17:48,326 --> 01:17:51,079
- Where are you?
- I'm at home.
Now, you listen to me, fella.

852
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,636
Just because you said you're having
a little bit of trouble doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you off the hook.

853
01:17:54,726 --> 01:17:56,876
Holy shit!

854
01:18:06,886 --> 01:18:09,480
- I can't talk now.
-Are you all right?

855
01:18:09,566 --> 01:18:12,876
- I have to call you back.
- What is it? Is it the police?

856
01:18:12,966 --> 01:18:14,365
Hello? Bill?

857
01:18:15,205 --> 01:18:21,474
We also have a videotape of a man
leaving the Speck Road house.

858
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:25,442
Now, we don't know if
it's the same man that's on the phone...

859
01:18:25,525 --> 01:18:28,597
or if he has any relationship
with Montgomery.

860
01:18:28,685 --> 01:18:30,641
We're not taking any chances.

861
01:18:33,805 --> 01:18:36,319
We also found this.

862
01:18:42,205 --> 01:18:46,801
''Bill''? I mean, that's
the last fuckin' straw. You break it--

863
01:18:48,805 --> 01:18:51,763
Good night.

864
01:18:51,845 --> 01:18:54,803
Hey, hey, hey, I'm serious, man.
It ends right here.

865
01:18:54,885 --> 01:18:57,001
Either you break it off,
or you get your ass reassigned...

866
01:18:57,085 --> 01:18:58,996
'cause I'm not
goin' down with you!

867
01:18:59,085 --> 01:19:02,794
I busted my ass to make detective
before 30. I'm not gonna
let you fuck that up!

868
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:06,396
You got that, Chris?

869
01:19:08,525 --> 01:19:10,880
Yeah, I got that.

870
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:18,519
You used to be a hell
of a cop, man.

871
01:19:18,605 --> 01:19:20,516
Get your shit together.

872
01:19:31,765 --> 01:19:33,721
Ah.

873
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:40,597
Uh-oh, bacon on the left.
Bacon burgers on the left.

874
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:44,439
- Great.
- God damn it!

875
01:19:44,525 --> 01:19:48,200
All right. Get in the back.
Use the shotgun.

876
01:19:48,285 --> 01:19:50,640
- I'm not shootin' at cops!
- Get in the back, man.

877
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:53,114
How far are you
gonna take this?

878
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:12,883
Yeah!

879
01:20:49,325 --> 01:20:51,839
Watch this.

880
01:20:56,725 --> 01:20:58,636
Oh, yeah.

881
01:21:00,365 --> 01:21:02,276
Shit!

882
01:21:04,925 --> 01:21:07,598
Ah!Jesus!

883
01:21:12,085 --> 01:21:14,474
Hang on, little buddy.
I'm gonna jam 'em.

884
01:21:28,725 --> 01:21:31,797
- Doin' all right?
- No.
-Just hang in there.

885
01:21:59,525 --> 01:22:02,835
Oh, fuck. It's over, man.

886
01:22:02,925 --> 01:22:05,803
It's over.

887
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:12,517
It's never over till it's over.
Keep your head down, man.

888
01:22:12,605 --> 01:22:16,393
- Keep your head down!
- Oh, it's gotta stop, man.

889
01:22:23,565 --> 01:22:25,999
Whoa. Whoa!

890
01:22:53,165 --> 01:22:56,521
- Hope this road goes somewhere.
- We're never gonna get
out of this!

891
01:24:05,925 --> 01:24:08,598
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're blowin' this pop stand.

892
01:24:08,685 --> 01:24:11,836
- It's over.
- They got Montgomery?

893
01:24:11,925 --> 01:24:14,678
Yeah, a couple hours ago.
Couldn't get many details...

894
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:16,721
but apparently
there was some big shoot-out.

895
01:24:16,805 --> 01:24:19,683
Their car ended up
in the Nisqually River,
and no one came out.

896
01:24:19,765 --> 01:24:22,598
So, we get a pat on the back...

897
01:24:22,685 --> 01:24:25,438
job well done, next case.

898
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:40,117
You know, you are one
lucky son of a bitch.

899
01:24:51,165 --> 01:24:53,281
- What are you gonna do about her?
- Oh, man, I--

900
01:24:54,365 --> 01:24:56,720
I think I love her.
I really do.

901
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:59,194
Well, I'd hate to think you
risked it all just 'cause you liked her.

902
01:25:01,165 --> 01:25:03,235
Yeah, yeah.

903
01:25:04,325 --> 01:25:07,795
Now comes the hard part.
Say, how do you feel...

904
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:09,921
about going across the street
and telling her that I'm a cop...

905
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:12,314
and I'm not a phone man
and I've been lying to her
and I've been taking pictures...

906
01:25:12,405 --> 01:25:15,363
- and looking at her
through telescopes and--
- Uh-uh. No.

907
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:18,562
Yeah. I didn't think
you'd like that.

908
01:25:18,645 --> 01:25:21,284
You know, I always thought
it would be you that screwed up.

909
01:25:21,365 --> 01:25:24,675
Well, maybe I'll learn
from your mistakes.

910
01:25:24,765 --> 01:25:26,960
- Probably not.
- Probably not. No.

911
01:25:27,045 --> 01:25:29,559
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

912
01:25:32,485 --> 01:25:34,237
The force of the water
against the car...

913
01:25:34,325 --> 01:25:37,203
is making it extremely difficult
to pull it from the river.

914
01:25:37,285 --> 01:25:39,799
It is not yet confirmed, but it
is believed that the body...

915
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:44,003
of escaped prisoner Richard ''Stick''
Montgomery is still trapped inside.

916
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:47,600
The body of his cousin, Caylor Reese,
was found two miles downriver.

917
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:50,483
- Normally, police divers would have
tried to pull Montgomery free...
- Hi.

918
01:25:50,565 --> 01:25:52,476
but due to the car's
precarious position...

919
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:56,353
and the force of the water,
that has not been possible.

920
01:26:00,245 --> 01:26:02,156
Are you all right?

921
01:26:05,045 --> 01:26:07,639
I know. I know.

922
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:20,881
- Maybe we should talk.
- Uh-huh.

923
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,836
You're wanted by the law,
aren't you?

924
01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:29,121
Is that what you think?

925
01:26:29,205 --> 01:26:32,641
Well, I heard sirens
this morning after you left.

926
01:26:35,205 --> 01:26:37,241
The police follow you here?

927
01:26:40,405 --> 01:26:45,433
I don't think I realized
until just now the size of the hole
that I dug for myself.

928
01:26:45,525 --> 01:26:47,914
How much trouble are you in?

929
01:26:51,765 --> 01:26:54,882
You're not gonna like me
very much when I tell you this.

930
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:58,116
Oh, God. I never should've
let this happen.

931
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:01,875
But I did.

932
01:27:01,965 --> 01:27:04,559
I want you to know,
before you start hating me--

933
01:27:04,645 --> 01:27:08,320
and you will start hating me--
that I've fallen in love with you.

934
01:27:08,405 --> 01:27:10,441
Don't, don't, don't.

935
01:27:11,885 --> 01:27:14,683
Don't interrupt a confession.

936
01:27:23,045 --> 01:27:26,355
I don't work
for the phone company.

937
01:27:26,445 --> 01:27:30,154
And my name is not Bill.
It's Chris.

938
01:27:31,925 --> 01:27:35,201
- You're a cop?
- I'm a detective.

939
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:40,963
I'm staking out the home
of an ex-girlfriend
of an escaped federal prisoner.

940
01:27:42,605 --> 01:27:46,518
You've been watching me?
From where?

941
01:27:48,605 --> 01:27:51,165
Across the street.

942
01:27:57,565 --> 01:27:59,476
And my phones?

943
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,437
Maria.

944
01:28:06,925 --> 01:28:08,961
Listen to me!

945
01:28:11,645 --> 01:28:14,113
In there, huh?

946
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:16,241
Uh-oh.

947
01:28:18,045 --> 01:28:20,605
Maria.

948
01:28:26,605 --> 01:28:28,800
What do you got there, huh?

949
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:51,081
Well--

950
01:28:54,645 --> 01:28:57,717
You guys are great.

951
01:28:59,365 --> 01:29:02,163
I hope I-- I hope
I didn't disappoint you.

952
01:29:09,285 --> 01:29:12,800
Maria. Maria! God damn it!

953
01:29:12,885 --> 01:29:16,878
Maria, listen to me!
Hold it a minute! Would you--

954
01:29:16,965 --> 01:29:18,762
- Would you-- Listen to me!
- No! Stop!

955
01:29:18,845 --> 01:29:22,724
Hear me! I was doing
my job, God damn it!

956
01:29:22,805 --> 01:29:26,320
Now, whether you like it or whether I
like it, it doesn't make any difference.

957
01:29:26,405 --> 01:29:31,274
There wasn't any fun in it, and what
happened between you and me was--

958
01:29:32,605 --> 01:29:34,960
was not part of it--
it was my mistake.

959
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:40,001
Maria.

960
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:47,434
I wanted to tell you.
I just-- I couldn't.

961
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:53,599
You son of a bitch!

962
01:30:23,445 --> 01:30:25,242
Oh, no!

963
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:30,798
You broke my heart.

964
01:30:36,645 --> 01:30:38,601
They said you were dead. I--

965
01:30:44,685 --> 01:30:46,835
Oh!

966
01:30:51,765 --> 01:30:53,835
Oh,Jesus Christ.

967
01:30:55,525 --> 01:30:57,720
I made it.

968
01:30:57,805 --> 01:31:01,718
I made it. It's all right.
I made it.

969
01:31:01,805 --> 01:31:03,841
Maria, will you just
think about it for a minute?

970
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:06,962
- Listen to me.
- Who the fuck is that?

971
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:10,003
- Okay? I couldn't tell you that I was--
- No. Put it down.

972
01:31:10,085 --> 01:31:13,714
- Don't.
- You couldn't tell her you were what?

973
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:22,760
You couldn't tell her
you were what? Who is this guy?

974
01:31:24,805 --> 01:31:28,684
You're-- Is this the guy?

975
01:31:28,765 --> 01:31:30,596
Is this the reason?

976
01:31:33,805 --> 01:31:35,921
You wanna take a walk in
the other room, pretty please?

977
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,798
Take a fuckin' walk!

978
01:32:00,365 --> 01:32:03,755
Christopher--
Christopher ''Lee-chee.''

979
01:32:03,845 --> 01:32:05,915
- Lecce.
- Lee-chee.

980
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,681
So, Lee-chee, what are you doin'
botherin' my old lady?

981
01:32:10,765 --> 01:32:12,881
- We had a fiight.
- Oh, you had a fiight?

982
01:32:12,965 --> 01:32:16,196
- That's too bad. What was it about?
- None of your business.

983
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:21,160
Watch it, pal. It is all my business.
Now, what was it about?

984
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:23,998
She found out I was
violating my parole, okay?

985
01:32:28,565 --> 01:32:31,204
Are you kidding me?

986
01:32:34,645 --> 01:32:36,556
What kind of candy-ass crime
did you commit, Chris?

987
01:32:36,645 --> 01:32:42,242
Did you steal some old lady's
handbag, huh? What'd you do?

988
01:32:42,325 --> 01:32:44,475
- Hey, take it easy. Take it easy, pal.
- What did you do?

989
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:46,476
Don't tell me to take it easy.

990
01:32:48,005 --> 01:32:51,520
- What'd you do?
- I rob banks.

991
01:32:52,885 --> 01:32:54,841
You rob banks?

992
01:32:56,645 --> 01:32:59,443
- Could you get me a knife, honey?
- What?

993
01:32:59,525 --> 01:33:03,723
Have a seat, Christopher.
Get me a knife.

994
01:33:13,165 --> 01:33:15,963
- You do time?
- Year and a half.

995
01:33:16,045 --> 01:33:18,605
- Where?
- Walla Walla.

996
01:33:18,685 --> 01:33:21,404
Hand me the knife, honey,
would you, please?

997
01:33:24,845 --> 01:33:27,154
I said, give me the knife.

998
01:33:38,645 --> 01:33:42,638
- Do you know who I am?
- No, man, I don't know who you are.

999
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,559
- I don't believe you.
- Oh! Ooh!
- No!

1000
01:33:47,645 --> 01:33:49,761
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1001
01:33:49,845 --> 01:33:52,678
I just wanted to know what
these things were stuffed with.

1002
01:33:57,525 --> 01:34:01,916
They're made of money.
She's safer than the bank, Chris.

1003
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:12,282
I had some friends at Walla Walla.
You probably know some of'em.
You know Cletus Ink?

1004
01:34:16,205 --> 01:34:18,673
- Nope.
- You don't know Cletus Ink?

1005
01:34:18,765 --> 01:34:20,596
- Uh-uh.
- You know Mad Dog Ross?

1006
01:34:20,685 --> 01:34:24,155
- You gotta know Mad Dog.
- No, I don't, but it was a big place.

1007
01:34:26,405 --> 01:34:28,714
You don't know Cletus Ink?
You don't know Mad Dog Ross?

1008
01:34:28,805 --> 01:34:31,558
Who the hell do you know?

1009
01:34:38,165 --> 01:34:41,760
Do you know Eddie Gant? Hmm?

1010
01:34:44,205 --> 01:34:48,323
- Yeah. Yeah, I did know Eddie Gant.
- What was he in for?

1011
01:34:52,325 --> 01:34:54,600
He killed a cop.

1012
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:58,320
Hello?

1013
01:34:58,405 --> 01:35:00,965
Yeah. Guess who this is.

1014
01:35:01,045 --> 01:35:04,640
Yeah, that's right. Well,
shut up for a second, will ya?

1015
01:35:04,725 --> 01:35:08,843
I can only say that the reports of
my demise have been greatly exaggerated.

1016
01:35:08,925 --> 01:35:12,201
Well, listen, man, I don't have time
to talk. Where we gonna do this?
We have to do it now.

1017
01:35:19,205 --> 01:35:23,084
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

1018
01:35:23,165 --> 01:35:26,475
Okay. All right. I'll
meet you there in 20 minutes.

1019
01:35:29,085 --> 01:35:31,645
Pack a bag.
We're taking a trip.

1020
01:35:34,565 --> 01:35:37,398
- What? What is it?
- There's someone out there.

1021
01:35:40,565 --> 01:35:42,715
- You! Now, get out the front door!
-Just relax, man.

1022
01:35:42,805 --> 01:35:44,443
- Get out the front door!
-Just relax! I'm not part of this shit!

1023
01:35:44,525 --> 01:35:47,562
Lock the front door
and the back. Get out.

1024
01:35:47,645 --> 01:35:49,715
Get out.

1025
01:35:49,805 --> 01:35:51,682
I will be back.

1026
01:35:58,205 --> 01:36:00,639
Oh. Oh.

1027
01:36:17,845 --> 01:36:20,678
Oh, shit!

1028
01:36:20,765 --> 01:36:22,642
Jesus Christ.

1029
01:36:36,045 --> 01:36:38,559
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- I don't know, man.

1030
01:36:38,645 --> 01:36:40,681
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1031
01:36:40,765 --> 01:36:42,721
Get him inside.

1032
01:36:42,805 --> 01:36:45,365
Throw him on the couch.

1033
01:36:49,205 --> 01:36:51,116
Cop. I knew it!

1034
01:36:55,645 --> 01:36:58,478
- What the hell are you--
- Shut up, pig!

1035
01:36:58,565 --> 01:37:01,238
Hey, back off.

1036
01:37:01,325 --> 01:37:03,839
How did you know
I was here? Hmm?

1037
01:37:03,925 --> 01:37:06,678
How did you know I was here?

1038
01:37:06,765 --> 01:37:09,757
You don't answer me. All right.
You say goodbye to your mama.

1039
01:37:11,245 --> 01:37:14,442
- Richard, don't!
- He wasn't following you.

1040
01:37:14,525 --> 01:37:16,993
He was following me.

1041
01:37:17,085 --> 01:37:19,645
- What?
- Yeah.

1042
01:37:19,725 --> 01:37:22,637
Yeah, I violated my parole, remember?
He's been following me for a week.

1043
01:37:22,725 --> 01:37:27,003
I made you on Saturday, asshole.
You don't do your job very well, do you?

1044
01:37:28,445 --> 01:37:32,199
Look, I got a car right outside. I can
drive you to wherever you wanna go.

1045
01:37:32,285 --> 01:37:34,674
Cuff his hands behind him.

1046
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,643
If he gets loose, you die!

1047
01:37:37,725 --> 01:37:41,081
You may think serving time
and having a couple cops on your ass
gives me a reason to trust you.

1048
01:37:41,165 --> 01:37:45,795
Well, let me tell you something, pal.
The last people in the world
I trust are ex-cons. Let's move.

1049
01:37:53,445 --> 01:37:56,596
So, uh, wh-wha-- what's
the deal with this guy?

1050
01:37:56,685 --> 01:38:01,042
I mean, really, what is
the deal with this guy? Huh?

1051
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,320
I don't even know who he is.

1052
01:38:04,445 --> 01:38:06,879
Isn't love great, Chris?

1053
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:11,322
One minute you're a god.
Next minute you're a scum-suckin' pig.

1054
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:21,878
I'm leavin' the country, baby.
You're goin' with me.

1055
01:38:21,965 --> 01:38:23,876
You goin' to Canada?

1056
01:38:23,965 --> 01:38:27,116
Are you a travel agent?
Drive, sucker.

1057
01:38:39,925 --> 01:38:41,836
Get out.

1058
01:39:03,965 --> 01:39:07,674
Sit down. Sit down.

1059
01:39:07,765 --> 01:39:09,835
- Hey--
- Shut up!

1060
01:39:13,485 --> 01:39:17,922
Maria, come here. I gotta talk
to this guy for about, uh, fiive minutes.

1061
01:39:18,005 --> 01:39:20,314
Could-- Could you take a walk
and just come back in fiive minutes?

1062
01:39:20,405 --> 01:39:22,794
What for?

1063
01:39:24,885 --> 01:39:27,843
-Just take a walk, would ya?
- You're going to kill them, aren't you?

1064
01:39:29,365 --> 01:39:31,003
Well, I'm not gonna
make love to them.

1065
01:39:31,085 --> 01:39:32,803
You expect me to go with you
after you do this?

1066
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:36,844
What do you want me to do?
Let them go? Do I look stupid?

1067
01:39:36,925 --> 01:39:40,201
If I let them go, I am dead.

1068
01:39:40,285 --> 01:39:44,722
How long do you think it's gonna take
for them to pick me up if I let them go?

1069
01:39:44,805 --> 01:39:47,797
Is that what you want?
They're gonna die, not me.

1070
01:39:47,885 --> 01:39:50,683
- Why? What do you--
- Why? Because that guy's a cop!

1071
01:39:50,765 --> 01:39:54,917
And that guy has been inside you.
Now get outta my way.

1072
01:39:55,005 --> 01:39:57,678
- No.
- Maria.

1073
01:40:01,285 --> 01:40:04,755
You're not gonna stop me.

1074
01:40:04,845 --> 01:40:07,075
Maria, get outta my way.
Come here.

1075
01:40:07,165 --> 01:40:09,440
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Maria. Get out!

1076
01:40:09,525 --> 01:40:12,835
No! Richard! No! No!
Richard! Richard! Ah!

1077
01:40:20,085 --> 01:40:24,601
- Don't you ever hit me! You understand?
- Oh, God!

1078
01:40:26,885 --> 01:40:30,480
Come on, man.
We gotta get outta here!

1079
01:40:33,285 --> 01:40:37,244
-Jesus Christ! That guy's a cop!
- I know he's a cop.

1080
01:40:37,325 --> 01:40:40,203
- His hands are cuffed.
- Not him. The other one.

1081
01:41:09,445 --> 01:41:14,075
Hey, where you goin'? Hey!
Wait for me, you bastard!

1082
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:35,400
- No! No!
- You're drivin' me to the border!
Get up the stairs!

1083
01:41:36,565 --> 01:41:39,363
Get up the stairs.

1084
01:41:56,165 --> 01:41:58,884
You wanna shoot? Huh?

1085
01:41:58,965 --> 01:42:02,002
Go ahead, pal!
What's the matter? You chicken?

1086
01:44:45,645 --> 01:44:48,557
Whoa!

1087
01:46:41,445 --> 01:46:44,721
I hope you believe
in reincarnation, sucker!

1088
01:46:52,565 --> 01:46:54,362
Get away!

1089
01:47:43,365 --> 01:47:47,119
I was supposed to give you a call,
wasn't I? I forgot.

1090
01:47:49,485 --> 01:47:52,158
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Not if you don't keep out of the way.

1091
01:47:52,245 --> 01:47:54,964
- Hey, man. How ya doin'? Okay?
- Hi.

1092
01:47:55,045 --> 01:47:57,081
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just a little tired.

1093
01:47:57,165 --> 01:48:00,441
A little tired, huh? Well, listen.
You go home, you get plenty of rest.

1094
01:48:00,525 --> 01:48:04,279
'Cause when I get better,
I'm gonna break both your legs.

1095
01:48:04,365 --> 01:48:06,481
- You're dust, Lecce. You hear me? Dust.
- Yeah. I'll see ya.

1096
01:48:06,565 --> 01:48:09,204
- Not only did you hit me once,
but twice.
- I'll see ya. Hey.

1097
01:48:09,285 --> 01:48:11,276
- This is one
of the worst nights of my life.
- What do you want?

1098
01:48:11,365 --> 01:48:13,720
- Well, I just wanna know
if she's gonna be okay.
- She's okay.

1099
01:48:13,805 --> 01:48:16,273
- Okay.
- Lusk thinks you got something
going on with that girl.

1100
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:18,117
- He wants an investigation.
- What are you talkin' about?

1101
01:48:18,205 --> 01:48:20,400
Well, he said you could
be in a lot of trouble.

1102
01:48:20,485 --> 01:48:23,124
Hell, I told him
you're always in trouble.

1103
01:48:38,565 --> 01:48:41,796
You saved my life.

1104
01:48:41,885 --> 01:48:44,558
You know what that means,
don't you?

1105
01:48:44,645 --> 01:48:47,796
No. What?

1106
01:48:47,885 --> 01:48:49,716
You belong to me now.

1107
01:49:13,605 --> 01:49:15,436
- What is your name, really?
- It's Chris.

1108
01:49:15,525 --> 01:49:17,516
- Chris? I love you, Chris.
- Really. I swear to God.

1109
01:49:17,605 --> 01:49:20,961
I say I love you
I hold you near me

1110
01:49:21,045 --> 01:49:23,400
- I love you too.
- You say I scare you

1111
01:49:23,485 --> 01:49:25,441
Well, that's your fear

1112
01:49:25,525 --> 01:49:29,916
- I know the message my heart is sending
- I'll take you home.
- Okay.

1113
01:49:30,005 --> 01:49:34,044
- If you don't read it
you'll keep on missing
- What a boner!

1114
01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:37,515
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1115
01:49:41,965 --> 01:49:46,436
Is it love, is it
Is it love

1116
01:49:49,245 --> 01:49:53,124
The broken record
goes 'round and 'round

1117
01:49:53,205 --> 01:49:57,084
Within a circle
Without a sound

1118
01:49:57,165 --> 01:50:00,999
I'm underwater
In overdrive

1119
01:50:01,085 --> 01:50:04,521
You hide in laughter
what's on your mind

1120
01:50:05,805 --> 01:50:10,117
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1121
01:50:10,205 --> 01:50:12,355
Why don't you tell me

1122
01:50:13,685 --> 01:50:19,123
Is it love, is it
Is it love, oh

01:50:21,645 --> 01:50:25,957
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1124
01:50:26,045 --> 01:50:28,001
Why can't you tell me

1125
01:50:29,525 --> 01:50:33,120
Is it love
Is it really love

1126
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:13,482
