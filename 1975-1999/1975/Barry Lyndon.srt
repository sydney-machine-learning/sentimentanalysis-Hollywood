He looks well in his regimentals.

71

to fight yokels...

QUIN: Miss Brady, it would appear...

...you both have something
private to discuss.

117
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,038

Captain Quin, I have nothing private
to discuss with my cousin.

119

Miss Brady, it appears you have
a great deal to discuss.

Captain Quin, he don't signify any more
than my parrot or lapdog.

121

Indeed!

122
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:45,514
Are you in the habit of giving...

123
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:49,470
...intimate articles of your clothing
to your parrot or lapdog?

124
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,977
Mayn't I give a bit of ribbon
to my own cousin?

125
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:55,271
You're welcome, miss.

We'll accustom you to Irish ways,
or we'll adopt English ones.

136
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,178
It is not the English way
for ladies to have two lovers.

in the garden today.

178
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,319
Now he's for murdering Jack Quin.

179
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:54,775
Mr. Brady, I've been insulted grossly
in this house.

180
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:58,164
I'm not satisfied
with these ways of going on.

181
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:01,457
[Gasps] I'm an Englishman!
And a man of property!

182
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,749
And this impudent young swine...

183
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,493
...should be horsewhipped!

184
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:09,341
Mr. Quin can have satisfaction
any time he pleases...

185
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:12,551
...by calling on Redmond Barry,
Esquire of Barryville.

186
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:22,020
I'll see the boy home.

Master Redmond.

189
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:36,823
Knowing your uncle is distressed
for money...

190
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:41,240
...trying to break off a match which
will bring £1,500 a year into the family...

191
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:46,668
Quin has promised to pay off the £4,000
which is bothering your uncle.

192
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,878
He takes a girl without a penny...

193
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:54,504
...a girl that's flinging herself
at the head of every man in these parts.

194
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,673
And missing them all!

195
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,970
And you, who ought to be attached
to your uncle as to your father...

196
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:03,426
I am.

197
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:07,059
And this is the return
you make for his kindness?

198
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,979
Didn't he harbour you
when your father died?

199
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:14,943
Hasn't he given you and your mother
a fine house, rent free?

200

Mark this, and come what will of it...

201
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,155
...I will fight the man who pretends
the hand of Nora Brady.

202
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:26,408
I'll follow him if it's into the church
and fight him there.

203
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:30,167
I'll have his blood, or he'll have mine.

Give me a kiss, me boy.

207
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:48,522
You're after me own soul.

208
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:53,735
As long as I live, you shall never want
a friend or a second.

209
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:59,401
Will you take my message to him?
And arrange a meeting?

210
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:05,532

this is a silly business.

214
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:19,943
The girl will marry Quin, mark my words.

215
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:23,862
And as sure as she does,
you'll forget her.

216
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:28,695
You're but a boy and Quin is willing
to consider you as such.

217
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:31,616
Right, Quin?

218
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:34,286
Yes.

219
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,297
GROGAN: Now,
Dublin's a fine place.

220
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,170
If you've a mind to ride there
and see the town for a month...

221
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:48,179
...here's ten guineas at your service.

222
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:52,387
Will that satisfy you, Captain Quin?

223
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:56,899
Yes, if Mr. Barry will apologize
and go to Dublin...

224
00:22:57,486 --> 00:23:00,772

honourably settled.

BARRY: I'm not sorry.

228
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,423
And I'll not apologize.

229
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:32,265

ULICK: It's all right,
it's one of mine.

235

Yours will serve, if it's needed,
for the next round.

Now you'd better ride off
before the Police are up.

before we left Kilwangen.

might have been...

254
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:13,135
...had he not fallen in love
with Nora...

255
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:16,765
...and had he not flung the wine
in Captain Quin's face.

256
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,933
But he was destined to be a wanderer.

257
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:24,770
And the battle with Quin set him
on his travels at an early age...

258
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,652
...as you shall soon see.

259
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:31,274
The boy must go into hiding
for a short time, anyway.

Dublin's the best place.

261
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,622
He can stay there
'til matters have blown over.

262
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:41,248
But the child has never been
away from home before.

263
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,292
Wouldn't he be as safe here?

264

on their way already.

Now, Dublin is five days ride
away from here.

on unpleasant matters...

my mother had in the world.

of the Law myself.

...with complete clothing, arms
and accoutrements.

[Captain shouting commands]

349
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,625
NARRATOR: For a young man
in difficulty...

350
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,387
...who had killed a man in a duel and
was anxious to find refuge from the Law...

351
00:35:15,932 --> 00:35:19,099
...the chance to earn distinction
in the European wars...

352
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,677
...seemed a stroke of good fortune.

353
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:26,597
And King George needed men too much
to heed from whence they came.

354
00:35:36,244 --> 00:35:38,320
[Scattered conversations]

355
00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:48,212
Hey, lad! Lad!

356
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:53,796
BARRY: Can I have a new beaker?
This one is full of grease.

357
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,262
[Laughter]

358
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:09,269
Covered in grease! Give the gentleman
a towel and a basin of turtle soup.

359
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,736
[Laughter]

[Cheering and applause]

362
00:36:44,187 --> 00:36:47,437
If you want to vex him,
ask him about his wife...

363
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:49,646
...the washerwoman, who beats him.

364
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:54,107
BARRY: Mr. Toole, is it a towel
of your wife's washing?

365
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:57,194
They say she wipes your face
often with one.

366
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,742
[Soldiers jeer]

367
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:02,278
Ask him why he wouldn't see her
yesterday when she came here.

368
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:06,869
BARRY: Mr. Toole, why did you hide
when Mrs. Toole came to visit you?

369
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:09,202
Afraid of getting your ears boxed?

370
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:11,454
[Soldiers jeer and chuckle]

371
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,133
Gentlemen, you may fight it out
with fists if you choose.

372
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:22,683
BROCK: We'll form a square
for that purpose.

373
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,524
BROCK: Gentlemen, step this way,
please.

374
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:44,450
Shake hands.

375
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:47,030
Shake hands.

376
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,583
Take your stance.

377
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,371
No biting, kicking or scratching.

378
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:57,087
The last man to remain standing
is the winner.

379
00:37:57,635 --> 00:38:00,671
Gentlemen, commence fighting, now!

[Military march music plays]

384
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:23,563
NARRATOR: Barry's training continued
at the camp.

385
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:27,108
Within a month he was transformed
into a proper young soldier.

386
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:33,364
The Regiment's strength
was steadily increased...

387
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,914
...by the arrival of other troops...

388
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,662
...in preparation for joining
their armies fighting in Germany.

389
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:43,670
One occasion...

390
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:48,305
...brought the welcome appearance
of his second in the fatal duel...

391
00:40:49,223 --> 00:40:50,598
...Captain Grogan.

392
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:56,219
[Military march music continues]

393
00:41:08,993 --> 00:41:12,576
It would have helped if we'd known
what had become of you.

394
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:16,786
Didn't you think of writing
to your mother?

395
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:21,619
Of course.

396
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:26,296
But the shame I felt of losing
her money...

397
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:29,670
...my father's sword and pistols...

398
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:33,265
I couldn't tell her.

399
00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:37,557
She wouldn't care about those things.

400
00:41:37,938 --> 00:41:39,646
You are her only concern.

401
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:43,399
Tonight you must write her
a proper letter.

402
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:46,689
Tell her that you're safe and well.

403
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,945
BARRY: I will.

404
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,668
Is Miss Brady well?

405
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,756
There are only six Miss Bradys now.

406
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:14,346
Has something happened to Nora?

407
00:42:16,727 --> 00:42:19,514
She took on so about your going away...

408
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:23,732
...that she had to console herself
with a husband.

409
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:27,688
She is now Mrs. John Quin.

410
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:33,023
Mrs. John Quin?

411
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:36,537
Was there another John Quin?

412
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:38,404
GROGAN: No.

413
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:41,416
The same, me boy.
He recovered from his wound.

414
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,756
The shot you hit him with could not
hurt him. It was made of tow.

415
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:51,757
Tow?

416
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:58,090
The Bradys wouldn't let you kill
1,500 a year out of the family.

417
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:04,600
The plan of the duel was arranged
in order to get you out of the way.

418
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:07,850
The cowardly Quin couldn't
be brought to marry...

419
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,314
...from fear of you.

420
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:13,526
GROGAN: But hit him
you certainly did, me lad.

421
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:16,400
With a fine thick plugget of tow.

422
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:21,158
He was so frightened,
it took him an hour to come to.

423
00:43:25,212 --> 00:43:26,920
Are you in want of cash?

424
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:33,504
You may draw on me. For I got
a couple of hundred from your uncle.

425
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:37,093
While that lasts, you shall never want.

426
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:46,106
NARRATOR: It would require a great
historian to explain the causes...

427
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:49,645
...of the Seven Years' War in Europe...

428
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:53,358
...to which Barry's regiment
was now on it's way.

429
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,699
Let it suffice to say,
that England and Prussia were allies...

430
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:00,948
...and at war against...

431
00:44:01,165 --> 00:44:03,917
...France, Sweden, Russia and Austria.

[Military march music plays]

433
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:20,799
NARRATOR: Barry's first taste
of battle...

434
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:24,143
...was only a skirmish against
a rearguard of Frenchmen...

435
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,303
...who occupied an orchard
beside a road...

436
00:44:27,483 --> 00:44:31,148
...down which the English main force
wished to pass.

437
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,353
Though this encounter is not recorded
in any history book...

438
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:39,446
...it was memorable enough
for those who took part.

I've only a hundred guineas
left to give you...

[Soft instrumental melody,

457
00:47:47,516 --> 00:47:51,810
NARRATOR: It is well to dream
of glorious war in a snug armchair.

458
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:56,106
It is a different thing
to see it first hand.

459
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:02,070
After his friend's death, Barry's thoughts
turned from military glory...

460
00:48:03,323 --> 00:48:05,897
...to those of escaping the Service...

461
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:08,745
...to which he was tied for six years.

462
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:25,969
NARRATOR: Gentlemen talk
of the Age of Chivalry...

463
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:30,766
...but remember the ploughmen,
poachers and pickpockets they lead.

464
00:48:31,852 --> 00:48:36,181
It is with these sad instruments
great warriors and kings...

465
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:39,769
...have been doing their murderous work
in the world.

[Soft instrumental melody continues,

467
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:53,244
NARRATOR: Barry could not have
fallen into worse circumstances...

468
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:55,739
...than those in which he found himself.

469
00:48:56,585 --> 00:49:00,369
But fate did not intend he should
remain long an English soldier.

470
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:02,792
An accident occurred...

471
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:06,591
...which took him out of the Service
in a rather singular manner.

you won't be angry with me, but...

which you won't be happy about.

you'll keep your temper.

Jonathan, don't be an ass!
You're making a big mystery of it.

480

For about two weeks.

FREDDIE: Oh, God,
you're not serious?

482
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,482
JONATHAN: I am. There's nothing
I can do about it.

483

FREDDIE: Where to this time?

484
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:17,991
JONATHAN: To Bremen, carrying
important despatches to Prince Henry.

485
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:23,295
FREDDIE: But you promised me
last time it would be never again.

486
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,421
JONATHAN: I know. And I've kept
my part of the bargain, but...

487
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:31,462
...Pontersby insists I'm the only one
who can be entrusted with the trip.

488
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:34,758
NARRATOR: Here was the opportunity
to escape from the Army...

489
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:37,098
...for which he had been searching.

490
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:42,229
It was only a few miles to the area
occupied by their Prussian allies...

491
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,188
...where this Officer's uniform
and papers...

492
00:50:46,278 --> 00:50:48,816
...should allow him to travel
without suspicion...

493
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:53,154
...and to stay ahead of the news
of his desertion.

494
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:56,990
FREDDIE: Then, we'll have
little time together.

495
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,497
JONATHAN: Are you cross with me?

496
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:04,660
FREDDIE: Damn you, I can't
stay cross with you for long.

497
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,257
Oh, Jonathan...

498
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:12,585
...at times like this I realize
how much I care for you...

499
00:51:12,971 --> 00:51:16,174
...and how empty life would be
without you.

500
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:17,850
JONATHAN: Frederick!

[Dramatic march music, background]

502
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:46,538
NARRATOR: Barry was glad to see
the uniforms of the Prussian Infantry.

503
00:51:48,423 --> 00:51:52,421
They showed him that he was
out of English occupied territory.

504
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:01,639
His intention was to make for Holland...

505
00:52:01,811 --> 00:52:05,227
...almost the only neutral country
in Europe, in those times...

506
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:08,348
...and thence to get a passage home,
somehow.

507
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:10,856
As he rode away...

508
00:52:11,363 --> 00:52:14,317
...Barry felt he was now
in his proper sphere.

509
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:19,031
And determined never again
to fall from the rank of a gentleman.

was frightful.

01:10:25,872 --> 01:10:29,206
The Colonel may say I'm ruined,
and send me to the Devil.

693
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:32,709
But, I would go to the Devil
to serve the Regiment.

694
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:36,043
[Upbeat classical melody,

695
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:39,802
COLONEL: [In German]
Corporal Barry, fall in.

696
01:10:49,896 --> 01:10:54,642
NARRATOR: The war ended and Barry's
regiment was garrisoned in the Capital.

697
01:10:56,862 --> 01:11:01,820
He had, for some time, ingratiated himself
with Captain Potzdorf...

698
01:11:03,034 --> 01:11:06,119
...whose confidence in him
was about to bring its reward.

699
01:11:06,204 --> 01:11:09,371
[Upbeat classical melody
continues, background]

700
01:11:15,922 --> 01:11:17,251
Good morning, Redmond.

701
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,965
Good morning, Captain.

702
01:11:20,135 --> 01:11:24,133
I should like you to meet my uncle,
the Minister of Police.

703
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:27,347
Good morning, Herr Minister.

704
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:30,759
Redmond...

705
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:35,356
...I've spoken to the Minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made.

706
01:11:35,901 --> 01:11:37,977
We shall get you out of the Army...

707
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:41,521
...appoint you to the Police Bureau,
and, in time...

708
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:46,483
...we'll allow you to move
in a better sphere.

709
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:49,705
Thank you, Captain.

710
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:57,454
Your Ioyalty to me and service
to the Regiment has pleased me.

711
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:03,466
Now there is another occasion
on which you can assist us.

712
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:06,388
If you succeed...

713
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:10,719
...your reward will be secure.

714
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,187
I'll do my best, sir.

715
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,907
There is a gentleman in Berlin
in the service of the Empress of Austria.

716
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,906
He calls himself
the Chevalier de Balibari.

717
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:35,747
He appears to be a professional gambler.

718
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:39,293
POTZDORF: He's a libertine:

719
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:41,664
Fond of women, of good food...

720
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:44,170
...polished, obliging.

721
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:49,219
He speaks French and German indifferently.

722
01:12:50,392 --> 01:12:54,010
But we have reason to fancy
that Monsieur de Balibari...

723
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,678
...is a native of your country of Ireland.

724
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:02,611
And that he has come here as a spy.

725
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:15,949
Your knowledge of English...

726
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:19,744
...makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service...

727
01:13:20,755 --> 01:13:23,377
...and find out whether or not
he is a spy.

728
01:13:26,594 --> 01:13:28,883
Does this assignment interest you?

729
01:13:30,849 --> 01:13:35,142
Minister, I'm interested in anything
that can be of service to you...

730
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:36,971
...and Captain Potzdorf.

731
01:13:38,356 --> 01:13:40,645
[Upbeat classical melody,
background]

732
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:51,114
You will not know a word of English.

733
01:13:52,412 --> 01:13:57,370
If the Chevalier remarks on your accent,
say you are Hungarian.

734
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:00,126
You served in the war.

735
01:14:00,628 --> 01:14:03,629
You left the Army for medical reasons...

736
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,585
...then served Monsieur de Quellenberg
for two years.

737
01:14:09,304 --> 01:14:13,088
He's now with the Army in Silesia,
but you'll have a certificate from him.

738
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:25,813
[Knock on door]

739
01:14:26,404 --> 01:14:28,231
[In German] Come in.

740
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:40,996
BARRY: [In German]
Good morning, Your Honour.

741
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:02,097
[In German] So you are the young man
recommended by Seebach.

742
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:07,476
[In German] Yes, Your Honour,
here are my credentials.

743
01:15:18,206 --> 01:15:20,578
[In German] Your name
is Lazlo Zilagy?

744
01:15:23,336 --> 01:15:25,412
[In German] Yes, Your Honour.

745
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:31,298
[In German] Monsieur de Quellenberg
recommends you highly.

746
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:35,794
[In German] Monsieur is
a very good man.

747
01:15:43,648 --> 01:15:46,103
NARRATOR: It was imprudent of him...

748
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:49,193
...but when Barry saw
the Chevalier's splendour...

749
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:51,815
...and noble manner...

750
01:15:52,365 --> 01:15:55,152
...he felt unable to keep disguise
with him.

751
01:15:56,995 --> 01:15:59,153
Those who have never been exiled...

752
01:15:59,914 --> 01:16:03,366
...know not what it is to hear
a friendly voice in captivity...

753
01:16:04,502 --> 01:16:08,085
...and would not understand the cause...

754
01:16:08,339 --> 01:16:11,459
...of the burst of feeling
now about to take place.

755
01:16:15,013 --> 01:16:17,504
[In German] You seem
the right one to me.

756
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:23,016
[In German] Thank you, Your Honour.

757
01:16:29,402 --> 01:16:31,110
[In German] Are you ill?

758
01:16:36,701 --> 01:16:37,697
Sir...

759
01:16:38,453 --> 01:16:40,825
...I have a confession to make to you.

760
01:16:42,749 --> 01:16:44,741
BARRY: I'm an Irishman.

761
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:47,209
My name is Redmond Barry.

762
01:16:50,715 --> 01:16:53,384
I was abducted into the Prussian Army.

763
01:16:54,886 --> 01:16:57,211
Now I've been put into your service...

764
01:16:58,056 --> 01:17:02,682
...by my Captain Potzdorf
and his uncle, the Minister of Police...

765
01:17:06,397 --> 01:17:09,683
...to serve as a watch
upon your... actions...

766
01:17:11,986 --> 01:17:15,936
...and to give information to them.

767
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,493
[Barry sobs]

768
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:39,634
NARRATOR: The Chevalier
was much affected...

769
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:42,260
...at thus finding one
of his countrymen.

770
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:45,470
For he too was an exile.

771
01:17:45,603 --> 01:17:46,766
[Barry cries]

772
01:17:46,854 --> 01:17:49,345
NARRATOR: And a friendly voice,
a look...

773
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:53,020
...brought the old country
back to his memory.

774
01:17:57,031 --> 01:18:00,151
He is very religious
and attends church regularly.

775
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:03,411
After Mass he comes home for breakfast.

776
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,158
He then takes an airing in his carriage.

777
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:13,871
NARRATOR: Barry presented his reports
regularly to the Minister.

778
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:18,256
The details were arranged
beforehand with the Chevalier.

779
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:22,633
He was instructed to tell the truth...

780
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,220
...as much as his story
would possibly bear.

781
01:18:28,062 --> 01:18:32,190
The information he gave
was very minute and accurate...

782
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,727
...though not very important.

783
01:18:39,657 --> 01:18:41,365
[Hooves clomping]

784
01:18:46,664 --> 01:18:49,369
[Soft classical melody, background]

785
01:18:56,007 --> 01:18:58,462
BARRY: [In German] Wine or punch,
Your Honour?

786
01:18:58,551 --> 01:19:00,259
CHEVALIER: [In German] Wine.

787
01:19:00,678 --> 01:19:04,628
NARRATOR: It was agreed that Barry
should keep his character of valet.

788
01:19:05,808 --> 01:19:09,592
That, before strangers,
he should not know a word of English.

789
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:15,308
And that he should keep a lookout
on the trumps when serving the wine.

790
01:19:17,445 --> 01:19:19,236
Having excellent eyesight...

791
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:21,780
...and a natural aptitude...

792
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:26,366
...he was able to give his dear patron
much assistance...

793
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:29,449
...against his opponents
at the green table.

794
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,203
Lf, for instance, he wiped
the table with a napkin...

795
01:19:34,712 --> 01:19:37,285
...the enemy was strong in Diamonds.

796
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:41,624
If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.

797
01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:45,170
If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...

798
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:47,512
...Hearts were meant, and so forth.

799
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:53,437
[Soft classical melody continues,
background]

800
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,355
NARRATOR: The Prince of Tübingen...

801
01:20:01,447 --> 01:20:05,112
...who had intimate connections
with the Great Frederick...

802
01:20:06,786 --> 01:20:10,237
...was passionately fond of play
as were the gentlemen...

803
01:20:10,456 --> 01:20:12,912
...of almost all the Courts of Europe.

804
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:16,043
[In German] You owe
15,500 frederick d'or.

805
01:20:38,484 --> 01:20:41,568
[Soft classical melody continues,
background]

806
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:52,028
Chevalier...

807
01:20:56,043 --> 01:20:57,952
...though I cannot say how...

808
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,788
...I believe you have cheated me.

809
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:12,008
I deny Your Grace's accusation...

810
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,597
...and beg you to say
how you have been cheated.

811
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:19,311
I don't know.

812
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:22,061
But I believe I have been.

813
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,188
Your Grace owes me
15,500 frederick d'or...

814
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:31,444
...which I have honourably won.

815
01:21:33,706 --> 01:21:34,820
Chevalier...

816
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,994
...if you will have your money now
you must fight for it.

817
01:21:43,174 --> 01:21:44,882
If you will be patient...

818
01:21:46,093 --> 01:21:48,798
...maybe I will pay you something
another time.

819
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:57,435
Your Grace, if I am to be so tame
as to take this...

820
01:21:58,189 --> 01:22:01,558
...then I must give up an honourable
and lucrative occupation.

821
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:05,769
I have said all there is to be said.

822
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:10,483
I am at your disposal
for whatever purposes you wish.

823
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:13,991
Good night.

824
01:22:36,268 --> 01:22:38,012
Was the Prince cheated?

825
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:44,271
BARRY: In as far as I am able
to tell, Herr Minister, no.

826
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,852
I believe he won the money fairly.

827
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:53,858
POTZDORF: What are
the Chevalier's intentions?

828
01:22:54,745 --> 01:22:56,156
BARRY: I'm not sure.

829
01:22:56,497 --> 01:23:00,957
The Prince told him that if he wanted
his money he'd have to fight for it.

830
01:23:04,505 --> 01:23:07,422
MINISTER: A meeting
with the Prince is impossible.

831
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:13,753
The Prince has left him no other choice.

832
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:26,858
[Inaudible whispering]

833
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:45,121
Will you be able to return here tomorrow
without arousing suspicion?

834
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:49,751
I know they won't allow a meeting
with the Prince.

835
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:54,463
But if I say that, do you know any reason
why he'll pay me what he owes?

836
01:23:56,098 --> 01:23:59,218
You must tell them I intend
to demand satisfaction.

837
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:02,475
Don't look so downcast, my boy.

838
01:24:03,063 --> 01:24:07,013
They cannot harm me,
the Austrian Embassy will see to that.

839
01:24:07,693 --> 01:24:11,987
The worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs.

840
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:16,277
If they should, don't worry...

841
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:19,195
...you shall not be left behind.

842
01:24:19,872 --> 01:24:21,414
Have no fear of that.

843
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:27,368
The King has determined to send
the Chevalier out of the country.

844
01:24:28,505 --> 01:24:30,794
Has he already demanded satisfaction?

845
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,879
Not yet, but I believe he intends to...

846
01:24:37,056 --> 01:24:38,431
...possibly today.

847
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:41,639
MINISTER: Then this
must be done tomorrow.

848
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:44,142
POTZDORF:
All the arrangements are made.

849
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:52,945
You said he takes a drive
after breakfast every day.

850
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:55,277
Yes, sir.

851
01:24:56,533 --> 01:24:59,700
Is there any reason he should do
any different tomorrow?

852
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,075
No, sir.

853
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,738
Good.

854
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:08,620
When the Chevalier comes out
to his carriage in the morning...

855
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:12,213
...two Officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier.

856
01:25:13,133 --> 01:25:15,541
POTZDORF: His baggage
will be sent after him.

857
01:25:15,636 --> 01:25:16,750
Excellent.

858
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:31,515
NARRATOR: At ten o'clock
the next morning...

859
01:25:31,985 --> 01:25:34,108
...the Chevalier de Balibari...

860
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,484
...went out for his regular morning drive.

861
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,792
Where's my servant, Lazlo?

862
01:25:49,253 --> 01:25:51,708
I will let down the steps, Your Honour.

863
01:26:02,432 --> 01:26:03,843
BARRY: What is this about?

864
01:26:03,934 --> 01:26:05,345
Please get inside.

865
01:26:08,021 --> 01:26:09,516
Am I under arrest?

866
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:12,437
1ST OFFICER: We're driving
to the frontier.

867
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:16,775
Frontier? But I'm on my way
to the Austrian Ambassador's house.

868
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,859
1ST OFFICER: My orders are
to escort you to the frontier...

869
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:22,441
...and see you safely across the border.

870
01:26:23,161 --> 01:26:24,988
But, I'm not going to the frontier.

871
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:29,160
I have very important business
at the Austrian Ambassador's house.

872
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:31,992
1ST OFFICER: My orders are
to take Your Honour...

873
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:34,543
...to the frontier
by any means necessary.

874
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:36,007
If you come willingly...

875
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:39,092
...I'm to give you this purse
on behalf of the Prince of Tübingen...

876
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:41,300
...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.

877
01:26:51,398 --> 01:26:53,521
BARRY: All Europe shall hear
of this.

878
01:26:59,698 --> 01:27:03,316
NARRATOR: And so,
without papers or passport...

879
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:07,240
...and under the eyes
of two Prussian Officers...

880
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:12,207
...Barry was escorted across the frontier
into Saxony and freedom.

881
01:27:13,921 --> 01:27:18,499
The Chevalier himself had uneventfully
crossed the frontier the night before.

882
01:27:21,511 --> 01:27:23,753
[Soft classical melody, background]

883
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:35,482
NARRATOR: By these wonderful
circumstances, Barry was free again...

884
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:39,273
...and began his professional work
as a gamester...

885
01:27:40,155 --> 01:27:44,983
...resolving, thenceforward and forever,
to live the life of a gentleman.

886
01:27:45,118 --> 01:27:46,743
[Gasping and giggling]

887
01:27:47,454 --> 01:27:49,162
[In French] The four wins.

888
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:54,417
NARRATOR: Soon he and the Chevalier
were received in all the Courts of Europe...

889
01:27:55,337 --> 01:27:56,748
...and were speedily...

890
01:27:56,838 --> 01:28:00,290
...in the very best society
where play was patronized...

891
01:28:00,759 --> 01:28:04,009
...and professors of that science
always welcome.

892
01:28:04,137 --> 01:28:07,138
[Operatic music with male tenor,
background]

893
01:28:07,391 --> 01:28:08,801
[In French] The seven.

894
01:28:09,267 --> 01:28:11,011
[In French] Why not the seven?

895
01:28:12,521 --> 01:28:14,264
[Mumbles in French]
All... all, yes.

896
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:15,980
[Inaudible whispering]

897
01:28:18,902 --> 01:28:20,895
CHEVALIER: [In French]
No more bets.

898
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,363
[Crowd moans]

899
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:27,910
[In French] Number seven...

900
01:28:27,994 --> 01:28:29,619
CHEVALIER: Loses.

01:28:29,996 --> 01:28:32,285
[Scattered, hushed reactions]

902
01:28:34,751 --> 01:28:37,421
[Operatic music continues,

903
01:28:37,504 --> 01:28:39,378
[In French] Place your bets.

904
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:45,918
Chevalier, will you give me credit
for 5,000 louis d'or, please?

905
01:28:47,013 --> 01:28:48,923
CHEVALIER: Of course, Lord Ludd.

906
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:02,069
[In French] Five thousand.

907
01:29:04,114 --> 01:29:06,071
[In French] Now,
everything on the four.

908
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:07,700
[Crowd grumbles]

909
01:29:09,745 --> 01:29:12,580
[In French] Yes, I know,
everything on the four.

910
01:29:24,426 --> 01:29:25,706
[In French] No more bets.

911
01:29:31,057 --> 01:29:32,053
[Crowd moans]

912
01:29:32,142 --> 01:29:34,265
CHEVALIER: [In French]
The four loses.

913
01:29:41,318 --> 01:29:43,026
[In audible whispering]

914
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:49,364
[In French] It is not important.

915
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,408
[In French] Now, I'm weary.

916
01:29:54,498 --> 01:29:57,285
[In French] I would like dinner.
Shall we?

917
01:30:00,086 --> 01:30:01,913
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.

918
01:30:03,381 --> 01:30:04,840
BARRY: If you don't mind.

919
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:07,088
Not at all.

920
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:14,549
NARRATOR: They always played on credit
with anyone of honour or noble lineage.

921
01:30:15,685 --> 01:30:17,761
They never pressed for their winnings...

922
01:30:18,021 --> 01:30:20,939
...or declined to receive
promissory notes.

923
01:30:22,526 --> 01:30:25,811
But woe to the man who did not pay
when the note became due.

924
01:30:26,613 --> 01:30:29,733
Barry was sure to wait upon him
with his bill.

925
01:30:30,408 --> 01:30:32,116
There were few bad debts.

926
01:30:32,202 --> 01:30:33,862
FRENCH REFEREE:
[In French] Saluez.

927
01:30:33,954 --> 01:30:37,738
NARRATOR: It was Barry's skill with
the sword, and readiness to use it...

928
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:41,249
...that maintained the reputation
of the firm, so to speak.

929
01:30:41,336 --> 01:30:43,376
FRENCH REFEREE: [In French]
On guard!

930
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:34,797
I will pay you today, sir.

931
01:31:36,308 --> 01:31:38,680
NARRATOR: Thus,
it will be seen, their life...

932
01:31:38,768 --> 01:31:42,848
...for all its splendour,
was not without danger and difficulty...

933
01:31:44,107 --> 01:31:46,859
...requiring talent and determination
for success.

934
01:31:48,028 --> 01:31:51,479
And required them to live
a wandering and disconnected life.

935
01:31:53,325 --> 01:31:57,536
And, though they were swimming
upon the high tide of fortune...

936
01:31:58,038 --> 01:32:02,249
...and prospering with the cards,
they had little to show for their labour...

937
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,122
...but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets.

938
01:32:07,049 --> 01:32:09,670
[Classical instrumental melody,
background]

939
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:22,935
NARRATOR: Five years in the Army,
and considerable experience of the world...

940
01:32:23,732 --> 01:32:27,943
...had dispelled any romantic notions
regarding love...

941
01:32:28,695 --> 01:32:30,854
...with which Barry commenced life.

942
01:32:31,531 --> 01:32:35,659
And he had it in mind,
as many gentlemen had done before him...

943
01:32:36,286 --> 01:32:39,453
...to marry a woman
of fortune and condition.

944
01:32:40,624 --> 01:32:43,031
And, as such things so often happen...

945
01:32:43,418 --> 01:32:47,712
...these thoughts coincided
with his setting sight upon a lady...

946
01:32:48,048 --> 01:32:52,093
...who will play a considerable part
in the drama of his life.

947
01:32:53,553 --> 01:32:55,511
The Countess of Lyndon...

948
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,715
...Viscountess Bullingdon of England...

949
01:32:58,809 --> 01:33:01,264
...Baroness Castle Lyndon of Ireland.

950
01:33:02,521 --> 01:33:05,391
A woman of vast wealth and great beauty.

951
01:33:08,151 --> 01:33:10,607
She was the wife of Sir Charles Lyndon...

952
01:33:12,072 --> 01:33:13,650
...Knight of the Bath...

953
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:17,572
...Minister to George III
at several of the Courts of Europe.

954
01:33:18,578 --> 01:33:21,034
A cripple, wheeled about in a chair...

955
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:24,661
...worn out by gout
and a myriad of diseases.

956
01:33:26,837 --> 01:33:29,292
Her Ladyship's Chaplain, Mr. Runt...

957
01:33:29,715 --> 01:33:33,795
...acted as tutor to her son,
the little Viscount Bullingdon...

958
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:38,005
...a melancholy little boy,
much attached to his mother.

a long story short...

...six hours after they met...
Her Ladyship was in love.

975

And once Barry got into her company...

976
01:38:08,868 --> 01:38:12,451
...he found innumerable occasions
to improve his intimacy...

977
01:38:13,706 --> 01:38:16,707

of Her Ladyship's sight.

Good evening, Mr. Barry.

982
01:39:21,357 --> 01:39:23,149
Have you done with my Lady?

983
01:39:25,862 --> 01:39:26,893
Pardon?

984
01:39:27,864 --> 01:39:32,158
Come, sir. I'm a man who would rather
be known as a cuckold than a fool.

985
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:38,747
I think, Sir Charles,
that you've had too much to drink.

986
01:39:39,959 --> 01:39:40,990
What?

987
01:39:41,294 --> 01:39:46,086
BARRY: As it happens, your Chaplain,
Mr. Runt, introduced me to your Lady...

988
01:39:46,966 --> 01:39:50,798
...to advise me on a religious matter,
of which she is an expert.

as I am drawing near the goal...

994
01:40:11,866 --> 01:40:14,487
...to find my home such a happy one...

995
01:40:14,994 --> 01:40:19,241
...my wife so fond of me, that she is even
now thinking of appointing a successor?

996
01:40:19,332 --> 01:40:22,617
Isn't it a comfort to see her
like a prudent housewife...

997
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:25,332
...getting everything ready
for my departure?

998
01:40:27,298 --> 01:40:30,418
I hope you're not thinking of leaving us,
Sir Charles?

999
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,136
Not so soon as you may fancy, perhaps.

1000
01:40:36,265 --> 01:40:39,966
I've been given over many times
these four years.

1001
01:40:40,353 --> 01:40:43,105
And there was always
a candidate or two...

1002

...waiting to apply for the situation.

1003
01:40:46,567 --> 01:40:48,110
I'm sorry for you, Mr. Barry.

1004
01:40:48,194 --> 01:40:50,946
It grieves me to keep you
or any gentleman waiting.

1005
01:40:51,114 --> 01:40:53,320
Had you not better arrange
with my doctor...

1006
01:40:53,533 --> 01:40:57,067
...or have the cook flavour my omelette
with arsenic, eh?

1007
01:40:57,745 --> 01:41:02,656

that I live to see Mr. Barry hang yet?

01:43:22,682 --> 01:43:27,509
The ceremony was performed by the
Reverend Runt, Her Ladyship's Chaplain.

"And therefore is not in any way

marriage rites]

1050
01:44:32,668 --> 01:44:36,203
NARRATOR: Barry had now arrived
at the pitch of prosperity...

1051
01:44:37,089 --> 01:44:42,084
...and by his own energy had raised
himself to a higher sphere of society...

1052

...having procured His Majesty's
gracious permission to add the name...

...of his lovely Lady to his own.

1054

Thenceforth, Redmond Barry
assumed the style...

Redmond, would you mind not smoking
for a while?

1058
01:45:50,329 --> 01:45:55,074
NARRATOR: Lady Lyndon was soon
destined to occupy a place in Barry's life...

1059
01:45:56,210 --> 01:46:00,504
...not very much more important
than the elegant carpets and pictures...

1060
01:46:01,048 --> 01:46:04,464
...which would form
the pleasant background of his existence.

1061
01:46:14,562 --> 01:46:17,847
My Lord Bullingdon,
you seem particularly glum today?

1062
01:46:22,695 --> 01:46:25,945
You should be happy
that your mother has remarried.

1063
01:46:30,244 --> 01:46:31,572
Not in this way.

1064
01:46:34,456 --> 01:46:36,034
And not in such haste.

1065
01:46:38,252 --> 01:46:40,209
And certainly not to this man.

1066
01:46:43,799 --> 01:46:46,290
I think you judge your mother too harshly.

1067
01:46:48,053 --> 01:46:50,509
Do you not like your new father?

1068
01:46:52,892 --> 01:46:54,172
Not very much.

1069
01:46:55,644 --> 01:46:58,729
He seems to me little more
than a common opportunist.

1070
01:46:59,899 --> 01:47:02,354
I don't think he loves my mother at all.

1071
01:47:03,444 --> 01:47:06,895
And it hurts me to see her
make such a fool of herself.

Her Ladyship presented Barry with a son.

[Men sing traditional folk song]

1076
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:04,622
NARRATOR: Her Ladyship and Barry
lived, after a while, pretty separate.

1077
01:48:06,423 --> 01:48:11,050
She preferred quiet, or to say the truth,
he preferred it for her...

1078
01:48:11,971 --> 01:48:15,920
...being a great friend to a modest
and tranquil behaviour in woman.

1079
01:48:18,018 --> 01:48:21,636
Besides, she was a mother,
and would have great comfort...

1080
01:48:22,022 --> 01:48:25,937
...in the dressing, educating
and dandling of their little Bryan.

1081
01:48:26,902 --> 01:48:29,856
For whose sake it was fit,
Barry believed...

1082
01:48:30,197 --> 01:48:34,064
...that she should give up the pleasures
and frivolities of the world...

1083
01:48:34,243 --> 01:48:37,659
...leaving that part of the duty
of every family of distinction...

1084
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,073
...to be performed by him.

1088
01:49:57,993 --> 01:50:02,073
NARRATOR: Lady Lyndon tended
to a melancholy and maudlin temper...

1089
01:50:03,248 --> 01:50:07,246
...and, left alone by her husband,
was rarely happy or in good humour.

1090
01:50:08,629 --> 01:50:11,914
Now she must add jealousy
to her other complaints...

1091
01:50:12,883 --> 01:50:15,967
...and find rivals even among her maids.

My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.
I have not forgotten him, if others have.

...I have always been willing
to live with you on friendly terms.

As men serve me, I serve them.

without some reason, that it had been...

...a declaration of war against him
by Bullingdon from the start...

1143

...and that the evil consequences
that ensued...

to be a man...

assumed an intensity...

1150

increased devotion to his mother.

I stepped forward.

that you cut off? " He says.

"besides wounding several."

"Here is nineteen golden guineas,
one for each head that you cut off."

1192
01:59:22,432 --> 01:59:24,056
What do you think of that?

1193
01:59:24,142 --> 01:59:26,430
Were you allowed to keep the heads?

1194
01:59:27,312 --> 01:59:30,099
No, they always become
the property of the King.

Of course I will. Now go to sleep.

01:59:44,579 --> 01:59:46,536
Will you keep the candles lit?

1200
01:59:46,831 --> 01:59:50,081
Bryan, big boys don't sleep
with the candles lit.

1201
01:59:50,918 --> 01:59:52,710
I'm afraid of the dark.

1202
01:59:52,962 --> 01:59:55,632
My darling, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1203
01:59:56,799 --> 01:59:59,207
But, I like it with the candles lit.

1204
01:59:59,344 --> 02:00:02,298
All right, you can sleep
with the candles lit.

1205
02:00:03,473 --> 02:00:04,801
Thank you, Papa.

1206
02:00:05,266 --> 02:00:06,381
Good night.

[Birds chirping]

1208
02:00:28,748 --> 02:00:30,326
MRS. BARRY: Ah, Redmond!

1209
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,958
It's a blessing to see my darling boy
has attained a position I knew was his due.

1210
02:00:38,508 --> 02:00:41,509
And for which I pinched myself
to educate him.

1211
02:00:43,554 --> 02:00:45,512
Little Bryan is a darling boy...

1212
02:00:46,599 --> 02:00:48,592
...and you live in great splendour.

1213
02:00:49,435 --> 02:00:51,594
Your lady wife knows
she has a treasure...

1214
02:00:51,687 --> 02:00:54,475
...she couldn't have had,
had she married a Duke.

1215
02:00:57,151 --> 02:01:00,437
But, if she should tire
of my wild Redmond...

1216
02:01:01,197 --> 02:01:03,522
...and his old-fashioned Irish ways...

1217
02:01:05,284 --> 02:01:07,076
...or if she should die...

1218
02:01:07,912 --> 02:01:11,328
...what future would there be
for my son, and my grandson?

1219
02:01:13,251 --> 02:01:15,742
MRS. BARRY: You have not a penny
of your own...

1220
02:01:16,921 --> 02:01:20,207
...and cannot transact any business
without her signature.

1221
02:01:21,926 --> 02:01:25,675
Upon her death the entire estate
would go to young Bullingdon...

1222
02:01:28,349 --> 02:01:30,674
...who bears you little affection.

1223
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:34,346
You could be penniless tomorrow...

1224
02:01:34,647 --> 02:01:38,597
...and darling Bryan at the mercy
of his stepbrother.

1225
02:01:43,030 --> 02:01:44,857
Shall I tell you something?

1226
02:01:46,242 --> 02:01:50,703
There is only one way for you
and your son to have real security.

1227
02:01:51,789 --> 02:01:54,327
You must obtain a title.

1228
02:01:56,127 --> 02:01:59,875
I shall not rest
until I see you Lord Lyndon.

1229
02:02:02,884 --> 02:02:05,090
You have important friends.

1230

They can tell you
how these things are done.

1231
02:02:08,681 --> 02:02:12,264
For money, well-timed
and properly applied...

1232
02:02:13,269 --> 02:02:15,226
...can accomplish anything.

1233
02:02:17,648 --> 02:02:20,270
NARRATOR: And Barry was acquainted
with someone...

1234
02:02:20,359 --> 02:02:22,767
...who knew how these things were done.

1235
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:28,734
This was the distinguished Barrister
and former Government Minister...

1236
02:02:29,202 --> 02:02:30,482
...Lord Hallam...

1237
02:02:31,078 --> 02:02:35,539
...whose acquaintance he had made,
like so many others, at the gaming table.

1238
02:02:36,876 --> 02:02:40,660
Do you happen to know
the Thirteenth Earl of Wendover?

1239
02:02:42,089 --> 02:02:43,667
BARRY: I don't believe I do.

1240
02:02:43,883 --> 02:02:48,260
Well, this nobleman is one
of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet...

1241
02:02:49,096 --> 02:02:53,723
...with whom our revered Monarch
is on terms of considerable intimacy.

1242
02:02:55,394 --> 02:02:59,095
In my opinion, you would be wise
to fix upon him...

1243
02:02:59,732 --> 02:03:03,777
...your chief reliance for the advancement
of your claim to the peerage.

1244
02:03:07,073 --> 02:03:11,201
When I take up a person, Mr. Lyndon,
he, or she, is safe.

1245
02:03:12,036 --> 02:03:14,444
There is no question about them anymore.

1246
02:03:14,872 --> 02:03:19,451
My friends are the best people.
I don't mean they're the most virtuous...

1247
02:03:20,419 --> 02:03:23,705
...or, indeed, the least virtuous,
or the cleverest...

1248
02:03:23,923 --> 02:03:26,758
...or the stupidest,
richest or best born.

1249
02:03:27,426 --> 02:03:28,624
But, the best.

1250
02:03:28,761 --> 02:03:32,379
In a word, people about whom
there is no question.

1251
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:36,923
I cannot promise how long it will take.

1252
02:03:37,478 --> 02:03:40,432
You can appreciate
it is not an easy matter.

1253
02:03:41,232 --> 02:03:45,230
But, any gentleman with an estate,
and 30,000 a year...

1254
02:03:46,028 --> 02:03:47,736
...should have a peerage.

1255
02:03:48,114 --> 02:03:50,735
[Vibrant classical music,
background]

1256
02:03:52,243 --> 02:03:55,446
And there standing behind me
was a total stranger.

1257
02:03:55,913 --> 02:03:58,238
I looked at him, and he said to me:

1258
02:03:58,666 --> 02:04:03,577
"Excuse me, sir, could you tell me,
is Lord Wendover alive or dead?"

1259
02:04:03,671 --> 02:04:05,248
[Laughter]

1260
02:04:05,965 --> 02:04:08,372
I was so astonished,
I couldn't think of what to say.

1261
02:04:08,467 --> 02:04:11,836
Then I became angry,
and said to him, "He's dead."

1262
02:04:12,221 --> 02:04:14,427
NARRATOR: The striving
after this peerage...

1263
02:04:14,515 --> 02:04:17,136
...was one of Barry's
most unlucky dealings.

1264
02:04:18,769 --> 02:04:21,439
He made great sacrifices
to bring it about.

1265
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:25,525
He lavished money here,
and diamonds there.

1266
02:04:27,111 --> 02:04:29,684
He bought lands
at ten times their value...

1267
02:04:29,989 --> 02:04:34,200
...purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices.

1268
02:04:35,619 --> 02:04:39,238
He gave entertainments
to those friends to his claim...

1269
02:04:39,957 --> 02:04:43,706
...all, being about the Royal person,
were likely to advance it.

1270
02:04:45,171 --> 02:04:50,165
And, I can tell you, bribes were
administered. And in high places, too.

1271
02:04:51,635 --> 02:04:56,214
So near the person of His Majesty
that you would be astonished to know...

1272
02:04:56,766 --> 02:05:00,597
...what great noblemen condescended
to receive his loans.

02:05:10,696 --> 02:05:12,938
It's dated 1605...

1276
02:05:14,033 --> 02:05:16,358
...and shows,

1277

Yes.

I love the use of the colour blue
by the artist.

1280
02:05:26,462 --> 02:05:28,371
Yes, that is very beautiful.

She's very well, Your Majesty.

Mr. Lyndon raised a company of troops
to fight in America against the rebels.

and go with them, too.

NARRATOR: Barry was born
clever enough at gaining a fortune...

1304
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:03,638
...but incapable of keeping one.

1305
02:07:05,227 --> 02:07:09,355
For the qualities and energies
which lead a man to achieve the first...

1306
02:07:09,732 --> 02:07:13,017
...are often the very cause of his ruin
in the latter case.

1307
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:18,734
Now he was burdened with
the harassing cares and responsibilities...

1308
02:07:19,491 --> 02:07:22,742
...which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property.

1309

And his life now...

1310
02:07:26,123 --> 02:07:30,666
...seemed to consist mostly of drafts
of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...

1311

...and endless correspondence...

1312

What does...

1318
02:08:30,729 --> 02:08:32,473
..."strenuous" mean?

Bryan, I'm trying to work.

1320

But what does it mean?

1321
02:08:46,703 --> 02:08:49,325
It means "an effort requiring strength."

1322
02:08:56,046 --> 02:08:58,003
What does "quadrangle" mean?

1323
02:09:04,430 --> 02:09:08,214
A quadrangle is a four-sided figure
like a square or a rectangle.

1324

I would've loved his elder brother...

...had he proved worthy
of any mother's affection.

1371
02:14:24,207 --> 02:14:26,994

as mortal could endure...

1372
02:14:27,085 --> 02:14:31,712
...the ill-treatment of the insolent Irish
upstart whom you've taken to your bed.

lowly birth and brutality of manners...

...which disgust me.

1375
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:42,596
But the shameful nature of his conduct
toward Your Ladyship...

1376

...his brutal and ungentlemanlike
behaviour...

1377

...his open infidelity...

1378

...his shameless robberies and swindling
of my property, and yours.

1379

And as I cannot personally chastise
this low-bred ruffian, and cannot bear...

1380
02:14:57,866 --> 02:14:59,905
...to witness his treatment of you...

1381
02:15:00,035 --> 02:15:03,036

as if it were the plague...

Ah, Barry. Hello.

1396

I see you're alone.
Why don't you join me?

1411

...Barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment...

in town and country.

Now all the bills came down
on him together.

1416
02:18:51,724 --> 02:18:55,389
All the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage...

1417
02:18:55,478 --> 02:18:58,598
...and which the creditors sent in
with a hasty unanimity.

1418
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:00,981
Their amount was frightful.

1419
02:19:02,610 --> 02:19:06,738
Barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts...

1420

and all the evils attendant upon them.

NARRATOR: Barry had his faults...

1436
02:20:43,169 --> 02:20:47,249
...but no man could say of him
that he was not a good and tender father.

1437
02:20:48,925 --> 02:20:51,546
He loved his son with a blind partiality.

1438

He denied him nothing.

1439
02:20:55,973 --> 02:20:59,592
It is impossible to convey
what high hopes he had for the boy...

1440
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:03,805
...and how he indulged
in a thousand fond anticipations...

1441
02:21:04,357 --> 02:21:07,393
...as to his future success
and figure in the world.

1442
02:21:09,862 --> 02:21:14,156
But fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him...

1443
02:21:15,284 --> 02:21:17,360
...that he should finish his life...

1444

Seventy-five seems
more like the right price.

I'll accept eighty guineas,
and not a shilling less.

02:28:16,789 --> 02:28:20,240
No, my darling, that's where
you were hurt by the horse.

1533
02:28:22,961 --> 02:28:25,168
But you're going to be all right.

1534
02:28:29,927 --> 02:28:33,545
Papa, if I die, will I go to heaven?

1535
02:28:39,103 --> 02:28:41,142
Of course you will, my darling...

1536
02:28:42,815 --> 02:28:44,807
...but you're not going to die.

1537

BRYAN: Mama, give me your hand.

1538
02:29:01,667 --> 02:29:03,458
Papa, give me your hand.

1539
02:29:09,758 --> 02:29:12,000
Will you both promise me something?

1540
02:29:15,806 --> 02:29:16,885
[Whispers] Yes.

1541
02:29:18,058 --> 02:29:20,845
BRYAN: Promise me
never to quarrel so.

1542
02:29:21,895 --> 02:29:23,520
But to love each other.

1543
02:29:24,481 --> 02:29:27,933
So that we may meet again, in heaven...

1544
02:29:29,486 --> 02:29:33,484
...where Bullingdon said
quarrelsome people will never go.

1545
02:29:42,249 --> 02:29:43,328
We promise.

1546
02:29:46,962 --> 02:29:50,046
BRYAN: Will you tell me the story
about the fort?

1547
02:29:52,759 --> 02:29:53,839
Of course.

1548
02:29:58,015 --> 02:29:59,675
We crept up on the fort.

1549
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:08,147
I jumped over the wall first,
and my fellows jumped after me.

1550
02:30:10,152 --> 02:30:12,643
And you should have seen the look...

1551
02:30:14,323 --> 02:30:19,317
...on the Frenchmen's faces when
23 he-devils, sword and pistol...

1552
02:30:20,746 --> 02:30:23,830
...cut and thrust,
came tumbling into the fort.

1553
02:30:25,667 --> 02:30:27,126
In three minutes...

1554
02:30:30,255 --> 02:30:31,453
...we left...

[Somber classical melody continues,

1573
02:32:30,834 --> 02:32:33,123
NARRATOR: Barry's grief was
inconsolable.

1574
02:32:34,588 --> 02:32:37,957
Such solace as he could find,
came only from drink.

1575
02:32:41,428 --> 02:32:46,054
His mother was the only person who would
remain faithful to him in his misfortune.

1576
02:32:47,559 --> 02:32:51,177
And many a night, when he was
unconscious of her attention...

1577
02:32:51,605 --> 02:32:53,562
...saw him carried off to bed.

1578
02:32:59,196 --> 02:33:00,571

...plunged into devotion...

1586

...with so much fervour, that you would
have imagined her distracted at times.

NARRATOR: In the doleful conditions
which now prevailed at Castle Hackton...

...management of the household,
and of the Lyndon estate...

1590
02:34:00,882 --> 02:34:03,836
...fell to Mrs. Barry,
whose spirit of order...

1591
02:34:04,344 --> 02:34:08,294
...attended to all the details
of a great establishment.

[Knock on door]

1593
02:34:12,894 --> 02:34:13,925
Come in.

1594
02:34:18,692 --> 02:34:20,435
You wish to see me, madam?

1595
02:34:20,944 --> 02:34:23,351
MRS. BARRY: Yes, Reverend.
Please sit down.

1596
02:34:27,867 --> 02:34:31,034
MRS. BARRY: I have some matters
I would like to discuss later...

1597
02:34:31,121 --> 02:34:33,244
...but just now would you go
to Her Ladyship...

1598
02:34:33,331 --> 02:34:35,240
...and have her sign these papers.

1599
02:34:36,251 --> 02:34:37,365
Yes, madam.

1600
02:34:50,181 --> 02:34:51,640
Reverend Runt...

1601
02:34:52,767 --> 02:34:56,219
...I need not tell you
that the recent tragedy to this family...

1602
02:34:56,313 --> 02:35:00,262
...has made the services of a tutor
no longer required here.

1603
02:35:02,193 --> 02:35:05,479
And as we are in considerable difficulty
about money...

1604
02:35:06,072 --> 02:35:09,690
...I'm afraid I must ask you,
with the greatest reluctance...

1605
02:35:10,618 --> 02:35:12,243
...to resign your post.

1606
02:35:18,251 --> 02:35:21,418
Madam, I'm sensible
to your predicament...

1607
02:35:22,505 --> 02:35:27,132
...and you need have no concern about
my wages, I can willingly forego them...

1608
02:35:28,303 --> 02:35:32,763
...but it is out of the question for me
to leave Her Ladyship in her present state.

1609
02:35:36,352 --> 02:35:38,429
I'm sorry to say this to you...

1610
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:43,773
...but I believe you are largely responsible
for her present state of mind.

1611
02:35:45,487 --> 02:35:48,441
The sooner you leave,
the better she will be.

1612
02:35:53,912 --> 02:35:56,200
Madam, with the greatest respect...

1613
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:59,577
...I take my instructions
only from Her Ladyship.

1614
02:36:02,378 --> 02:36:03,754
Reverend Runt...

1615
02:36:04,464 --> 02:36:08,414
...Her Ladyship is in no fit mind
to give instructions to anyone.

1616
02:36:10,095 --> 02:36:13,629
My son has charged me with managing
the affairs at Castle Hackton...

1617
02:36:13,723 --> 02:36:18,017
...until he recovers from his grief and
resumes his interest in worldly matters.

1618
02:36:19,020 --> 02:36:20,431
While I'm in charge...

1619
02:36:20,522 --> 02:36:23,439
...you'll take your instructions from me.

1620
02:36:24,484 --> 02:36:27,057
MRS. BARRY: My only concern is
for Lady Lyndon.

1621

Madam...

1622
02:36:32,784 --> 02:36:35,820
...your only concern is
for Her Ladyship's signature.

1623
02:36:36,955 --> 02:36:41,533
You and your son have almost succeeded
in destroying a fine family fortune.

1624
02:36:42,794 --> 02:36:44,621
And what little remains for you...

1625
02:36:44,712 --> 02:36:47,832
...depends on keeping Her Ladyship
prisoner in her own home.

1626
02:36:48,341 --> 02:36:49,716
Reverend Runt...

1627
02:36:50,802 --> 02:36:53,507
...this matter bears
no further discussion.

1628
02:36:54,264 --> 02:36:56,885
You will pack your bags
and leave by tomorrow.

LADY LYNDON: God, help. Help!

1631
02:37:22,876 --> 02:37:25,580
NARRATOR: In the midst
of these great perplexities...

1632
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:29,288
...Her Ladyship made an attempt
to kill herself by taking poison.

1633
02:37:30,508 --> 02:37:33,343
Though she only made herself
dangerously ill...

1634
02:37:34,220 --> 02:37:36,925
...due to the very small amount
which she swallowed...

1635
02:37:37,140 --> 02:37:41,090
...this, nevertheless, caused
an intervention from a certain quarter...

1636
02:37:41,686 --> 02:37:43,311
...which was long overdue.

1637
02:37:43,396 --> 02:37:44,475
Oh, my God!

BULLINGDON: If my mother had died...

1639
02:38:19,891 --> 02:38:22,216
...it would've been as much
my responsibility...

1640
02:38:22,310 --> 02:38:24,848
...as if I had poured
the strychnine for her myself.

1641
02:38:26,856 --> 02:38:29,857
For to the everlasting disgrace
of my family name...

1642
02:38:30,943 --> 02:38:34,147
...I have, by my cowardice,
and by my weakness...

1643
02:38:35,281 --> 02:38:38,033
...allowed the Barrys
to establish a brutal...

1644
02:38:38,368 --> 02:38:40,823
...and ignorant tyranny over our lives...

1645
02:38:41,329 --> 02:38:43,784
...which has left my mother
a broken woman...

1646
02:38:44,874 --> 02:38:49,501
...and to squander and ruin
a fine family fortune.

1647
02:38:52,882 --> 02:38:56,832
My friends profess sympathy,
but behind my back...

1648
02:38:58,096 --> 02:38:59,673
...I know I am despised.

1649
02:39:01,182 --> 02:39:03,091
And quite justifiably so.

1650
02:39:10,525 --> 02:39:11,604
However...

1651
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:17,403
...I know now what I must do.

1652
02:39:20,410 --> 02:39:21,868
And what I shall do.

The last occasion on which we met...

1662
02:41:34,919 --> 02:41:37,789
...you wantonly caused me injury
and dishonour.

1663
02:41:39,382 --> 02:41:44,293
In such a manner, and to such an extent
no gentleman can willingly suffer...

1664
02:41:46,013 --> 02:41:48,220
...without demanding satisfaction...

1665
02:41:49,308 --> 02:41:51,301
...however much time intervenes.

1666

that satisfaction.

and as you have seen...

...your second has loaded one,
and I have loaded the other.

1671
02:42:52,330 --> 02:42:56,623

you may have whichever one you wish.

[Dramatic instrumental beat

1674
02:43:14,143 --> 02:43:17,844
Now, gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire...

1675
02:43:18,397 --> 02:43:20,306
...I will toss a coin in the air.

1676
02:43:20,524 --> 02:43:24,474
As the offended party, it is
Lord Bullingdon's choice to call the toss.

1677
02:43:25,654 --> 02:43:27,896
Is that agreeable to both of you?

1678
02:43:30,284 --> 02:43:31,280
Yes.

1679
02:43:33,662 --> 02:43:37,446
If Lord Bullingdon calls correctly
he will have the first fire.

1680

If incorrectly, Mr. Lyndon
will have the first fire.

1681
02:43:44,548 --> 02:43:46,375
Is that clearly understood?

SIR RICHARD: It is heads.

1685

Lord Bullingdon will have the first fire.

Yes.

02:46:02,227 --> 02:46:05,643
I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon,
but you must first stand your ground...

1701
02:46:05,731 --> 02:46:08,187
...and allow Mr. Lyndon his turn to fire.

1702
02:46:11,528 --> 02:46:14,066
SIR RICHARD: That is correct,
Lord Bullingdon.

1703
02:46:14,531 --> 02:46:18,529
Your pistol has fired,
and that counts as your shot.

1704
02:46:32,925 --> 02:46:36,875
SIR RICHARD: Mr. Lyndon,
are the rules of firing clear to you?

1705
02:46:38,847 --> 02:46:39,796
Yes.

1706
02:46:43,769 --> 02:46:45,144
Lord Bullingdon...

1707
02:46:46,647 --> 02:46:49,316
...are you ready to receive
Mr. Lyndon's fire?

1708
02:46:56,198 --> 02:46:57,361
[Gasps] Yes.

1709
02:47:00,494 --> 02:47:02,368
SIR RICHARD: Very well, then.

1710
02:47:05,374 --> 02:47:06,654
Mr. Lyndon...

1711
02:47:08,043 --> 02:47:09,621
...cock your pistol...

1712
02:47:10,587 --> 02:47:12,212
...and prepare to fire.

1713
02:47:22,599 --> 02:47:24,391

1715
02:48:09,271 --> 02:48:12,225
Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?

1716
02:48:21,742 --> 02:48:24,197
SIR RICHARD: Is your pistol cocked,
Mr. Lyndon?

1717
02:48:27,122 --> 02:48:28,071
Yes.

1718
02:48:33,378 --> 02:48:34,873
Then prepare to fire.

1719
02:48:41,553 --> 02:48:42,668
One...

1720
02:48:44,431 --> 02:48:45,546
...two...

[Gunshot]

1722
02:48:57,986 --> 02:49:02,316
Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon
having fired into the ground...

1723
02:49:02,783 --> 02:49:06,068
...do you now consider
that you have received satisfaction?

1724
02:49:11,375 --> 02:49:14,708
[Dramatic instrumental beat
continues, background]

1725
02:49:19,883 --> 02:49:22,588
I have not received satisfaction.

1726
02:49:54,584 --> 02:49:56,873
SIR RICHARD: Mr. Lyndon,
are you ready?

1727
02:50:08,223 --> 02:50:09,386
[Whispers] Yes.

1728
02:50:11,810 --> 02:50:13,637
SIR RICHARD: Lord Bullingdon...

1729
02:50:14,146 --> 02:50:16,601
...cock your pistol
and get ready to fire.

1730
02:50:35,208 --> 02:50:36,323
One...

1731
02:50:39,087 --> 02:50:40,250
...two...

1732
02:50:45,093 --> 02:50:46,587
[Barry groans]

[Church bells ring]

1734

NARRATOR: Barry was carried to
an inn nearby and a surgeon was called.

[Barry gasps]

1736
02:51:18,835 --> 02:51:20,294
I'm nearly finished.

1737
02:51:37,062 --> 02:51:38,521
[Barry gasps]

1738
02:51:42,484 --> 02:51:45,438
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Lyndon.

1739
02:51:46,613 --> 02:51:48,985
I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...

1740
02:51:49,825 --> 02:51:51,651
...most likely below the knee.

1741
02:52:00,585 --> 02:52:01,866
Lose the leg?

1742
02:52:03,588 --> 02:52:04,584
What for?

1743
02:52:06,842 --> 02:52:09,333
The simple answer is to save your life.

1744
02:52:10,762 --> 02:52:14,890
The ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery.

1745
02:52:16,226 --> 02:52:19,346
Unless I amputate, there's no way
that I can repair the artery...

1746
02:52:19,437 --> 02:52:21,181
...and stop the hemorrhage.

1747
02:52:23,358 --> 02:52:24,603

Graham.

1750
02:52:54,306 --> 02:52:55,504
Yes, My Lord?

1751
02:52:55,932 --> 02:53:00,559
When we arrive at Castle Hackton,
inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.

1752
02:53:01,479 --> 02:53:03,721
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.

1753
02:53:04,024 --> 02:53:07,973
Just tell her where he is
and that he has been wounded in the leg.

1754
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:10,611
She will want to go to him.

1755
02:53:11,239 --> 02:53:15,403
See that she is out of the house and
on her way to London as soon as possible.

1756
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:16,739
And in no event...

1757
02:53:16,828 --> 02:53:19,449
...is she to be allowed to see my mother...

1758
02:53:19,706 --> 02:53:22,992
...or create any disturbance at the house
before she leaves.

1759
02:53:23,752 --> 02:53:25,127
GRAHAM: Yes, My Lord.

[Graham gasps]

1763
02:54:37,534 --> 02:54:39,491
Mrs. Barry, how do you do?

1764
02:54:40,078 --> 02:54:42,616
MRS. BARRY: How nice
to see you, Graham. Come in.

1765
02:54:42,706 --> 02:54:43,785
Thank you.

1766
02:54:45,458 --> 02:54:47,914
You... received my note?

1767
02:54:48,628 --> 02:54:50,206
Yes, we were expecting you.

1768
02:54:50,296 --> 02:54:53,048
Oh, good, I didn't want
to call unannounced.

1769
02:54:54,342 --> 02:54:56,418
Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?

1770
02:54:58,346 --> 02:55:01,015
I'm feeling much better,
thank you, Graham.

1771
02:55:02,350 --> 02:55:03,595
Won't you sit down?

1772
02:55:03,685 --> 02:55:05,262
Thank you, Mrs. Barry.

1773
02:55:13,820 --> 02:55:15,480
Would you like some tea?

1774
02:55:15,613 --> 02:55:18,780
Oh, no! No, thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Not just now.

1775
02:55:24,539 --> 02:55:26,662
How's the world treating you, Graham?

1776
02:55:26,750 --> 02:55:28,789
GRAHAM: Oh, not too bad.

1777
02:55:31,546 --> 02:55:33,539
GRAHAM: Are you comfortable here?

1778
02:55:33,631 --> 02:55:35,042
Most comfortable.

1779
02:55:35,133 --> 02:55:36,378
Good, good!

1780
02:55:50,732 --> 02:55:53,305
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?

1781
02:55:55,278 --> 02:55:56,476
By all means.

1782
02:56:03,119 --> 02:56:04,495
GRAHAM: Mr. Lyndon...

1783
02:56:07,290 --> 02:56:10,125
...Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...

1784
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:14,045
...to offer you an annuity...

1785
02:56:14,923 --> 02:56:18,707
...of 500 guineas a year for life.

1786
02:56:21,137 --> 02:56:24,257
Specifically on the condition of your...

1787
02:56:26,226 --> 02:56:27,850
...leaving England...

1788
02:56:28,478 --> 02:56:31,147
...and to be stopped...

1789
02:56:32,273 --> 02:56:34,480
...the instant of your return.

1790
02:56:37,570 --> 02:56:41,650
Lord Bullingdon has also asked me
to point out to you...

1791
02:56:43,326 --> 02:56:45,947
...that should you decide to remain here...

1792
02:56:46,663 --> 02:56:50,411
...your stay would infallibly plunge you...

1793
02:56:52,126 --> 02:56:54,000
...into jail.

1794
02:56:55,672 --> 02:57:00,334
As in view of the present circumstances
there will soon be...

1795
02:57:01,344 --> 02:57:04,511
...innumerable writs taken out
against you for...

1796
02:57:04,973 --> 02:57:07,096
...debts long-outstanding...

1797
02:57:08,351 --> 02:57:11,020
...and your credit is so blown that...

1798
02:57:12,522 --> 02:57:14,182
...you could not hope...

1799
02:57:14,816 --> 02:57:16,440
...to raise a shilling.

and beaten...

02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:54,014
...what was the lonely
and broken-hearted man to do?

1803
02:57:55,982 --> 02:57:59,730
He took the annuity and returned
to Ireland with his mother...

1804
02:58:00,403 --> 02:58:01,731
...to complete his recovery.

1805
02:58:03,573 --> 02:58:06,064
Sometime later he travelled abroad.

1806
02:58:08,202 --> 02:58:11,986
His life there, we have not the means
of following accurately.

1807
02:58:12,915 --> 02:58:16,450
He appears to have resumed
his former profession of a gambler...

1808
02:58:16,586 --> 02:58:18,543
...without his former success.

1809
02:58:20,048 --> 02:58:22,087
He never saw Lady Lyndon again.
