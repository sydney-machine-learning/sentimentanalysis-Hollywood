1
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:53,686
I think the hardest time is
waking up in the morning.

2
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:57,390
Those first moments
before I remember who I am,

3
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,228
and think instead,
about who I was.

4
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,331
Mom, there's snow on Mount Tom.

5
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:07,200
It'll still be there
on the weekend.

6
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,369
Don't make me
go to school today.

7
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,804
It's the first day of snow.

8
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,109
There's snow on Mount Tom.

9
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,446
Want to sleep awhile?

10
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,714
Can't be late for the
first day of school.

11
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,117
Everyone will be skiing but me.

12
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,253
Me, too.

13
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,521
I saw Jill's boobies.

14
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,723
Mom? I saw Jill's boobies.

15
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,226
Will you tell Jerry not
to watch me get dressed?

16
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,562
Reverend Byrd called last night

17
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,824
and said you're going to
have a full class this year.

18
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,374
Good morning, children.

19
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,144
Good morning.

20
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,348
I'm Jill Kinmont, your teacher.

21
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:58,686
Good morning.

22
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,159
So my mother puts me in
the chair in the morning,

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,229
and I stay in it all day long

24
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,830
until she takes me out at night.

25
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,565
You stay in it all day?

26
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,601
Yep. Don't you ever
go to the bathroom?

27
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,303
All the time.

28
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,838
You see, I have an
in dwelling catheter.

29
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,341
A tube that goes inside me,

30
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,543
attached to a bag
on the inside of my leg.

31
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,412
Yuck.

32
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,914
There. That's the place.

33
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,817
Isn't it beautiful?

34
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,552
What's the best way to catch it?

35
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,187
Spear it.

36
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,723
Okay. Who can spell spear?

37
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,358
Come on.

38
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,461
First one who gets it,
gets to try for that trout.

39
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:46,699
S-P-E-E-R.

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,836
That's close.
That's almost right.

41
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,306
But it's more like "ear."

42
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,568
Anyone know how to spell ear?

43
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,176
Eddie?

44
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,412
E-A-R?

45
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,547
Right.

46
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,349
So how would you spell spear?

47
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,483
Everybody.

48
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,320
S-P-E-A-R.

49
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,322
Right.

50
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,662
Nope.
Nobody would want to marry you.

51
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:16,929
Think not?

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,865
They would, too.
She's beautiful.

53
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,501
Yeah, but she can't
dance or nothing.

54
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,270
Anybody ever ask you?

55
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,772
Ask me what? To get married.

56
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,274
Who?

57
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,708
You don't know him.

58
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,344
If he asked you,
how come you didn't?

59
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,980
I always think I'm past it.

60
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,816
That it can't hurt me anymore.

61
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,886
Then without warning,
it all comes rushing back.

62
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,689
Here, in Bishop
more than anywhere.

63
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,758
Because I can still look up
and see the snow.

64
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,864
I'm Jill Kinmont and I ski.

65
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,486
There. There he is.

66
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,621
He's the handsomest thing
I've ever seen.

67
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,723
Fastest man on skis
in the world.

68
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,892
"Mad Dog" Buek they call him,
because he's so crazy.

69
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,527
He takes so many chances.

70
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,028
They say he's trying
to kill himself.

71
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,095
Kill himself?

72
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,363
Well, that's what it says.

73
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,931
What if he dies
before we meet him?

74
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,733
What if he kills himself
before we get on the team?

75
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,867
He won't.

76
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,703
What if he does?

77
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,009
Then we don't get to meet him.

78
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,607
What you got?

79
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,074
Nothing. Come on. What you got?

80
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,010
Let me see. What is it?

81
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,546
Mind your own beeswax.
Gimme the magazine, A.J.

82
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,980
It's Dick Buek.

83
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,016
I even got a letter
from him this morning.

84
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,952
Didn't you girls know?
We've been writing for some time.

85
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,521
He says he's looking forward
to meeting me

86
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,022
when I... Make the Olympic Team.

87
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,658
Sure.

88
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,794
Well, anyway, he's too old for me.
He's 21 or 22.

89
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,464
And besides,
I'm in love with someone else, anyway.

90
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,699
Who's the lucky fella?

91
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,135
James Dean.

92
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,777
All right, listen up, everybody.

93
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,548
A.J.?

94
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,484
Okay. We have our first competition
of the year this weekend

95
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:27,487
or, or next weekend, rather.

96
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,822
Now, I usually just take the
best skiers to these races,

97
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,591
but this time...

98
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,427
I've decided to take everybody.

99
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,968
Herbie Johnson,
keep your hands off me.

100
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,069
I didn't do nothing.

101
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,671
Herbie, take it easy.

102
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:45,938
What did I do wrong?

103
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,708
As if you didn't know.
You have your hands all over the place.

104
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,910
They are not. They're right
here at the end of my arms.

105
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,979
All right, somebody just trade
places with Jill right now.

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,046
I will.

107
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,649
Audra Jo.

108
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,204
It's great. Look at that.

109
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,140
It's fantastic.

110
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,143
A.J., come back
and get your skis.

111
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,177
A.J.?

112
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,782
Herbie.

113
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,251
Herbie tell her to come
back and get her skis.

114
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,687
Now, let's all stick together.

115
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,888
All right.

116
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,957
As far back as I can remember,

117
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,593
all I ever wanted to do was ski.

118
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,094
It wasn't just a sport

119
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,764
it was a way of life.

120
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,134
Our coach was Dave McCoy.

121
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,539
An ex-champion who shaped us
into a top high school team.

122
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:04,283
Five, four, three, two, one.

123
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,886
Go.

124
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,623
Our toughest competition was
a team from Boulder, Colorado.

125
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,226
Headed by a speed demon,
named Buddy Werner.

126
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,210
In the starting gate,
number 46 Three, two, one.

127
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,429
From Bishop, California. Go!

128
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,563
10 seconds.

129
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,298
Skeeter Werner,
Boulder, Colorado.

130
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,868
Five, four, three, two, one.

131
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,536
Go.

132
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,074
The best skier on the Colorado
girl's team was Skeeter Werner.

133
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:06,112
And it became a personal battle
to prove which team was best.

134
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,215
14, 10 seconds.
Audra Jo Nicholson, Bishop, California,

135
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,217
wearing number 14. Five, four,

136
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,720
three, two, one.

137
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:14,755
Go.

138
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,992
This is her second
year of competition.

139
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,196
Last year, finishing fourth in the
finals at Big Bear, California.

140
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,936
Number 89, in the starting gate.

141
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:33,005
In the starting gate,
Jill Kinmont, number 89.

142
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,642
Ranking first place...

143
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,810
Jill could still take her,
Skeeter only got me by five seconds.

144
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,811
10 seconds.

145
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,818
Five, four, three, two, one.

146
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:46,819
Go.

147
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,359
Go, Jill. Go.
Go, Jill. Come on do it.

148
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:09,176
Jill Kinmont, number
89, incompleted run.

149
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:17,717
Beautiful.

150
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,353
Want me to take your picture?

151
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,054
I bit my tongue.

152
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,882
Shouldn't stick it out
while you're racing.

153
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,424
Want to know why you burned?

154
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,259
My coach will tell me,
thank you.

155
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,995
Skiing is gravity.

156
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,296
Much more powerful than you are.

157
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,037
The less you fight it,
the faster you go.

158
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,866
Do I know you?

159
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:34,867
No.

160
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,303
Get up.

161
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,073
What are you, a doctor or something?
Nope.

162
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,175
Now, keep your hands
out in front of you.

163
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,311
What's "M.D." stand for?

164
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,379
That's my name. Just...
Just crouch down and stay loose.

165
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,816
Now, gravity works through the hinges.
Right? Mike. Your name's Mike.

166
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,051
Ankles, knees, butt, elbows.
Melvin.

167
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,186
Mark? Maurice? Max? Stick your butt out.
Man, stick it way out.

168
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,289
Make yourself like a bullet...
Hey!

169
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,991
You want to learn to ski or not?

170
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,893
Look, I'm sorry.

171
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,063
I don't take skiing lessons
from just anybody.

172
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,567
I'm Jill Kinmont,
and I just happen to be the best ski...

173
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,236
My God!

174
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,138
You're "Mad Dog" Buek.

175
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,906
We have it confirmed now...

176
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,976
Skeeter and Bud Werner...

177
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,939
I had met Dick Buek.

178
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,975
I thought my life would
never be the same.

179
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,213
But summer came,
and all fantasies had to be put aside.

180
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,317
My family ran a guest ranch
called the Rocking X.

181
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,955
And during the summers,
all of us did our share.

182
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,930
My best friend was
Audra Jo Nicholson

183
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,765
and we were inseparable.

184
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,237
He's adorable.

185
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,479
There was nothing we didn't
know about each other,

186
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,149
no dream we didn't share.

187
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,052
But our biggest dream
was skiing.

188
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,319
And we lived in
the constant hope

189
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,890
of someday making
the Olympic team together.

190
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,146
A.J.?

191
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,583
A.J., are you awake?

192
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,420
Can I talk to you?

193
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,555
I'm beat.

194
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,525
All you have to do is listen.

195
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,494
Okay.

196
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,465
I been thinking about luck.

197
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,271
Wondering why
I'm always so lucky.

198
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,609
Everything that I ever
wanted I always got.

199
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,614
Did you ever feel that way?

200
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,317
Yeah, sometimes.

201
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,153
And...

202
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:20,192
And I begin to wonder

203
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,430
if maybe I'm just one of those
people that's just born lucky

204
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,200
or if I'm...

205
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,437
Just using up all
my luck at once.

206
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,508
What do you think?

207
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,447
I think... I think I'm sick.

208
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,949
What's wrong?

209
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,551
I got such a headache.

210
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,722
Maybe you just got
too much sun, A.J.

211
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,393
Want some aspirin?

212
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,129
I took some.

213
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,066
I'll bet it's too much sun.

214
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,134
You okay?

215
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,903
Go ahead.

216
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,141
I don't know...

217
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,446
I think I really wonder...

218
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,616
If I'll ever see Dick again.

219
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,320
What d'you think?

220
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,292
Josie?

221
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,061
A.J.?

222
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,463
You okay?

223
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,698
Josie?

224
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,034
Are you all right?

225
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,468
Hey, you guys.
Somebody call a doctor.

226
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,338
Something's wrong with A.J.

227
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,045
Dave, what did the doctor say?

228
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,381
I think it might be best if
you kids just take my car

229
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,513
and go on back. All right?

230
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,452
What is it?

231
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,623
They think it's polio.

232
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,595
You kids go on now.

233
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,133
Coach.

234
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,444
Will...
Will you give her this ring?

235
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,714
And... Tell her I love her.

236
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,253
I do.

237
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,122
Okay.

238
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,754
Josie!

239
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,591
We're going to
the Olympics together.

240
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,593
You're going to be fine.

241
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,638
We're gonna go together.

242
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,831
You're gonna be fine.

243
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,801
You're gonna be fine, Josie.

244
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,670
You'll be fine.

245
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,712
After Josie got sick

246
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,549
I wanted to ski for both of us.

247
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,519
And I worked harder that summer
than I'd ever worked before.

248
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,393
Are you sure it's him?

249
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:18,330
Positive. Look. He landed his plane
practically right smack in Dave's front yard.

250
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,632
I saw him from the highway.
I thought it was gonna crash.

251
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,402
But by the time I got there,
he was getting out on crutches.

252
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,237
Crutches?

253
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,439
I swear to God,
he was flying a plane on crutches.

254
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,607
Why? His leg.

255
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,876
His broken leg.

256
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:34,180
Didn't you know?
It was in all the magazines.

257
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,282
He was on his
motorcycle doing 110

258
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,916
ran smack into a camper trailer

259
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,486
flew right through the window
and out the other side.

260
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,588
They thought he was dead.
They even pulled a sheet over his face.

261
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,689
Can you imagine?

262
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,624
I didn't even know.

263
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,361
Well, that's what you get
for being such a hermit.

264
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,632
You better not be kidding
me, Linda.

265
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,534
Kidding? I swear.

266
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,927
Look at the plane,
you dumb-dumb.

267
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,382
Hi, girls.

268
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,551
Hi.

269
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,621
What's up?

270
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,193
We were just on our way to
school, and,

271
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,962
thought we'd stop by and...

272
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,498
See what time practice was.

273
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,835
Same as usual.

274
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,871
Jill, I told you it
was the same as usual.

275
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,708
3.30. I don't know why she
insisted on coming up here.

276
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,647
Hi.

277
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,749
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

278
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,816
I'm Linda Meyers.

279
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,685
Hi, Linda.

280
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,655
I been, reading about you
ever since you started skiing.

281
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,824
And I, wrote you
a letter in the hospital.

282
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,829
This is an old friend of mine.

283
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,931
Old friend of mine, too.

284
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,333
You know her?

285
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,302
Taught her everything she knows.

286
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,904
Now, listen, girls, don't...
Don't, be late to school. All right.

287
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,540
Come on, Jill.
We're gonna be late for school.

288
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,942
You go ahead. I'll
meet you at practice.

289
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,711
What do you mean, go ahead?

290
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,846
Just go ahead.

291
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26,392
So...

292
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,427
You want to take
a walk or something?

293
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,428
Okay.

294
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,029
Let's go,

295
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,740
Do you suppose she's
in there with him?

296
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,709
I think we better
call Dave McCoy.

297
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,757
We can get across right here.

298
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,859
You'll never make it.

299
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,927
Race you across.

300
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,997
Why is it you do these things?

301
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,368
You really want to
kill yourself.

302
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,973
I've heard about
the crazy things you do.

303
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:51,009
Sky diving with parachutes
you find in trash cans.

304
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,012
Riding your motorcycle
like a maniac.

305
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,616
Don't believe
everything you hear.

306
00:21:58,918 --> 00:21:59,985
Why, Dick?

307
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,687
Why what?

308
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,755
Why do you want to die?

309
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,056
You care?

310
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,792
Don't be silly.

311
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:07,960
I just want to know.

312
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,364
I don't think about that.

313
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:27,413
So... Here I am, I'm, nothing.

314
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,982
Tenth grade education,
not a decent thought in my head,

315
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,885
but I keep on living.

316
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,923
No matter what I do,
I just get right back up on my feet again.

317
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,461
I don't know why
good people die.

318
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,063
And I just keep on going.

319
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,067
Well, you are good.

320
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,002
You are.

321
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,905
What the hell do you know?

322
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,941
I know I care about you.

323
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,910
So you must be good.

324
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,381
Think I'm funny?

325
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,838
I think you're beautiful.

326
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,754
Me, too.

327
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,090
You, I mean.

328
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:31,143
Dick... Please stay alive.

329
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,144
Winter, 1955.

330
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,780
The Olympics were
just one year away.

331
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,749
And anyone who wanted to qualify

332
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,151
had to finish the season on top.

333
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,087
- 10 seconds.
- Number 32,

334
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,023
Carol Collingsworth.

335
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:22,494
Five, four, three, two, one.

336
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,495
Go.

337
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:00,566
Okay. You can't see very
well, so stay loose,

338
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,267
but be aggressive all the way.
Okay?

339
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,235
10 seconds.

340
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:08,139
Wearing number 89, Jill Kinmont.

341
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,943
Five, four, three, two, one.

342
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,179
Go.

343
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,892
As the competition got stiffer,
so did my determination to win.

344
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:31,830
I swept the regionals, winning more trophies
than had ever been won in a single year.

345
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,700
And number 89 became
the number to watch.

346
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,348
Excuse me.

347
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,921
Well... Smooth. Very smooth.

348
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,756
We need a time on that now.

349
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,024
Hey, Buddy, how about
putting your arms around her?

350
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,592
You better ask her first.

351
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,561
The winner Is Jill Kinmont.

352
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,372
In that Incredible year.

353
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:17,342
Buddy Werner had a winning
streak as lucky as mine.

354
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:20,747
And everywhere we went,
people were trying to start a romance.

355
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,984
But I was still thinking
about Dick Buek

356
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,754
and all that winter
I looked for him.

357
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:54,814
Hey, Dick... Hey.

358
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,720
Buddy, look who's here.
Dick Buek.

359
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,221
Who's that blonde with him?

360
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:07,058
Must be Sigrid Halvorson.
They say they're engaged.

361
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,160
Look who's here. It's Dick Buek.

362
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,629
Hey, how're you doing?

363
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,934
Hey, Dick.
Hey, how're you doing?

364
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,769
All right.
Hey, how'd you break your arm?

365
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,672
Dancing with a very heavy girl.

366
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,649
I know you, right?

367
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,684
Yeah.

368
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:33,886
Hey, Buddy. Yeah.

369
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,656
I want to introduce
you to my fiancee.

370
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,129
Hey, Dick Buek. How are you?
How've you been?

371
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,464
Remember Charlie from
Lake Placid last winter?

372
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,900
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.
Let's go.

373
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,771
Come on. You can talk
to these people later.

374
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,729
Hey... Don't.

375
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,035
Hey, whatever's at...

376
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:29,008
Whatever's wrong,
I'd like to help.

377
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,921
Good run.

378
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:21,059
All right, take it easy this time.
Now, you're way ahead. Right?

379
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,961
So don't go for any records.

380
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:26,331
Now remember that,
tree jump, right?

381
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:29,134
All right, look good. Have fun.
Hold on to that lead.

382
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,435
89, 10 seconds.

383
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,371
At the starting gate,
Jill Kinmont.

384
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,274
Five, four, three,
...skier of the year.

385
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,544
Two, one. Go.

386
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,449
With the season
drawing to a close,

387
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,518
Buddy and I were invited
to a special training camp,

388
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,256
preparing ourselves for the
last big race of the year.

389
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:54,259
It was called the Snow Cup,
held in Alta, Utah.

390
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,896
And if I won there,
I'd qualify for the Olympics.

391
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,155
Come on, Jill,
quit fooling around.

392
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,642
No, you're on your own. Come on!

393
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,417
February 1st, 1955.

394
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,120
The Snow Cup is
only a few days away.

395
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:32,057
And the experts were betting
on both of us to win.

396
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,225
You and Buddy going to
the Olympics together?

397
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,927
Did you ever ski each
other off the slopes?

398
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,930
Only on tournaments sometimes.

399
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,453
What if you don't
make it this year?

400
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,106
That was a beautiful run, Jill.

401
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:52,995
If you win the Snow Cup are you
certified in the Olympic Team?

402
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,653
The arrival of flight 22 from
Los Angeles to Salt Lake City.

403
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,924
Those waiting for arriving
passengers proceed...

404
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,266
What's the toughest competition
that you think you'll have?

405
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,668
How do you think
she's gonna do at Alta?

406
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,670
Are you confident that you
can make it to the Olympics?

407
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,639
There are a lot of people
counting on you for Alda.

408
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,741
This is the big one?

409
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,253
It's divided
into three sections.

410
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,655
You got a fairly easy start,

411
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,357
but you're going to be
building up a lot of speed

412
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,992
coming into that middle section.

413
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,394
That's the gulley,
the one they call the corkscrew.

414
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,395
It's over there.

415
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:50,135
Then a fairly easy valley
and you're on home.

416
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:54,005
But the race is gonna be won or lost
right here. Right here in the corkscrew.

417
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,574
There's a sharp...
Sharp rise just ahead of it.

418
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,344
So if you come into it too fast,
you're gonna go straight up.

419
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,345
So check there. Right?

420
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,313
Right.

421
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,715
Wait a minute.
There's Andrea Meade Lawrence.

422
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,499
She's checking.
She's slowing down. Right?

423
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,423
All right, now,
that's about perfect.

424
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,659
See, 'cause she lost a little
time, but she gained control.

425
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,794
Do you understand?

426
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:22,333
Go ahead and, take your practice run.
All right?

427
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,303
My main competition here was
a girl named Andy Lawrence.

428
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,372
A top Eastern skier.

429
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,375
Who needed to win this
race as much as I did.

430
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,643
But after watching
her practice run

431
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,679
I knew she could be beaten.

432
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,048
She was slowing down
at the corkscrew

433
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,528
and this is where
I could take her.

434
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,401
Jill!

435
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,536
Buddy.

436
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,576
Just wanted to say good luck.

437
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,045
Good luck to you.

438
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,681
Here.

439
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,283
What is it?
I want you to have it.

440
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,518
What?

441
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,421
St. Christopher's.
I wear it for luck.

442
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,225
I gotta go. Yeah, Jill,

443
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,792
I want to go to the
Olympics married.

444
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:23,528
To me?

445
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:25,396
Who do you think?

446
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,099
I don't know.
I'm a nervous wreck.

447
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,603
I really got to go.

448
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,672
I love you, honey.

449
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,307
Me, too, you.

450
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,444
We got a date at the
bottom, right?

451
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,212
Right.

452
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,247
We'll talk about it there.
Okay? Right.

453
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,349
Go get 'em.

454
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,853
Number 14 in the men's division,

455
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:52,158
Bobby Werner,
making his first run.

456
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,232
Hey, look at that.

457
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:38,869
Look right and left.

458
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,372
Carpenter and Walsh have
already broken their records.

459
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,508
And the two main contenders,
Andrea Meade Lawrence

460
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:46,344
and Jill Kinmont
are yet to perform.

461
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:49,380
In the starting gate,
Andrea Meade Lawrence,

462
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,686
Number six, to the gate,
please ...wearing number six.

463
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:53,585
Go, Andy.

464
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:55,821
Yes, we're ready.

465
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,928
Three, two, one. Go.

466
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,748
And she's coming down
just right.

467
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,321
That's gonna be hard to beat.
She's way ahead of the field.

468
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,973
Next up,
number 89, Jill Kinmont.

469
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:53,344
You can win the race.

470
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,513
You're gonna win all right?

471
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:58,416
Just be smooth, and use your head,
and hang onto that mountain. All right?

472
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,017
Officials ready? Ready.

473
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,587
Timers ready? Yes. Ready.

474
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:03,954
We're ready for skier number 89.

475
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,356
Yes, we're ready.

476
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,557
All right.

477
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,925
10 seconds.

478
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:08,960
10 seconds.

479
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:19,771
Five, four, three two, one. Go.

480
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,953
Clear the course.

481
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,322
Will you clear the course,
please?

482
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:13,458
Okay.
They're on their way right now.

483
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,590
Yeah. They just left here.

484
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,070
Clear the course...
Will you clear the course, please?

485
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,938
Where does it hurt, Jill?

486
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,573
I can't feel anything.

487
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,775
Can you feel your toes at all?

488
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,845
No. Jill, it's Dave.

489
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,448
We'll take care of her.

490
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,683
All right, Jill,
listen to me now.

491
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,386
Just take it easy. These people are
gonna take care of you. All right?

492
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:18,556
I'm gonna go down to the bottom and
I'll see you in a little while. Okay?

493
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:19,725
All right.

494
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,529
Don and Jack, take her arms.

495
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,497
Sean, take her legs.

496
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,165
Skeeter, you take her feet.
We'll straighten her out.

497
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,001
Very carefully. Very slowly.

498
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,404
It's okay, Jill.

499
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,839
It's okay.
Just let us do the work.

500
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,974
Hang on.

501
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,076
Straighten her legs out a little
more, Skeeter. Buddy...

502
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,478
Okay, on the count of three

503
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,879
we'll all lift very slowly.

504
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,980
Ready?

505
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,016
One, two, three.

506
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,592
There you go.
Keep her head from moving.

507
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,843
Ready? One, two, three.

508
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,581
Here we go.

509
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,483
Be careful now.

510
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,418
Try and keep it level. Easy.

511
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,244
Take it easy.

512
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,186
Take it easy.

513
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:48,073
Move back away from her.

514
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,142
Driver, let's go.

515
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,240
Driver, how long
do you think it'll be?

516
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,842
Looks like it's
backed up for miles,

517
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:25,943
it could take hours.

518
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:26,912
She won't make it.

519
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:30,080
Dave... I... I'm not gonna die.

520
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,549
Now, you listen to me,

521
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:34,953
this is Jill Kinmont.

522
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,692
And she's not gonna die.
Do you understand that?

523
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:14,985
My head... What's in my head?

524
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,421
It's the traction.

525
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:21,259
Jill...

526
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,703
You're gonna be all right, Jill.

527
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:33,938
Do you understand?

528
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:37,108
Don't see me like this.

529
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,345
Sleep, Jill.

530
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,148
Just close your eyes and sleep.

531
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,918
If I sleep I'll never wake up.

532
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,754
You're gonna
come out of it, Jill.

533
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,958
You got to.

534
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,961
Help me stay...
Stay awake, Buddy.

535
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,865
Help me stay awake.

536
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,107
There's been a
fracture dislocation

537
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:12,410
of the spinal column
at the level of C 5.

538
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:18,990
In plain talk,
it means her neck's broken.

539
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:22,921
The spinal cord's
completely severed.

540
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:29,394
Will it heal?

541
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:32,830
It'll fuse.

542
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:34,310
But that's not the
same as healing.

543
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:42,107
What is the...
The prognosis? Yes.

544
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:45,777
At this point,

545
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,479
it's a matter of guess work.

546
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,089
We'll have to wait
for her to tell us.

547
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,919
In the meantime,
all we can do is...

548
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,256
Wait and hope.

549
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:01,492
Hope that she'll walk?

550
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,296
That she'll live.

551
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,023
One, two, three.

552
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,464
Anybody up there?

553
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:50,601
Hi, I'm your doctor.
Dr. Pittman.

554
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,339
There's blood on your shoe.

555
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,175
I'll be darned.

556
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,677
It better not be mine.

557
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:03,881
You wait out here, Jerry.

558
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,087
Jill.

559
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,089
Mom, come here.

560
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Jill.

561
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,929
I can't see you.

562
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,431
Can you turn her over? Just did.

563
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,113
Don't you cry, Mom,

564
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,415
you'll get tears in your ears.

565
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,677
Don't you cry or you'll
splash them all over my face.

566
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,023
Now look forward.

567
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,592
No. Just with your eyes.

568
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,099
Gives me a headache.

569
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,234
I'm about done.

570
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,170
And back again.

571
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,572
Good.

572
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,411
Nurse.

573
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:08,579
Thank you.

574
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,753
That bad?

575
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:19,289
Why do you say that?

576
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,159
Beware of smiling doctors.

577
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:28,566
Do you want to hear about it?

578
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,235
Sure.

579
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,006
There seems to be
nothing left below there.

580
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,977
No movement,
no feeling of any kind.

581
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:46,316
If the break had been a
fraction lower,

582
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,187
you would've retained
the use of your hands.

583
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,323
But if it'd been
a fraction higher,

584
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,585
you wouldn't be able to
breathe without an iron lung.

585
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:02,133
How long?

586
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:04,402
How long what?

587
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,004
Before I'm well?

588
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,112
Jill... Dr. Pittman...

589
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,115
You don't understand.

590
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,484
Neither do you.

591
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:24,321
I have this problem, you see,

592
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:26,757
when I want something, I get it.

593
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:29,459
I understand that.

594
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,795
No, you don't.

595
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,331
I'm gonna walk out
of this place,

596
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,068
and if you tell anybody
anything different

597
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:40,771
I'm gonna make you
look damn silly.

598
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:50,847
Hi.

599
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,087
How're you feeling?

600
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:58,355
Super.

601
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:01,226
I, I'm on my way back home,

602
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:05,195
so, I just thought I'd come by

603
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,597
and tell you that if,
if you need anything, I mean,

604
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,333
anything at all,

605
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:11,635
just ask them to call me and,

606
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:13,203
I'll see what I can do.

607
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:17,441
I, I think,
they're very good people.

608
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:18,529
They're doing a good Job.

609
00:51:19,477 --> 00:51:21,545
Yeah. Look at all this stuff.

610
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:22,713
Yeah. I saw that.

611
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,651
How's Andy taking the success?

612
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:30,420
You know,
Andy's been there before.

613
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:34,224
She's... She's won
a lot of races.

614
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:36,126
She's a good skier.

615
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:38,095
She's a great skier.
She's a great skier.

616
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,479
You have just about
everybody up here?

617
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,515
Dave?

618
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:59,584
Dave?

619
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:02,553
Dave.

620
00:52:13,398 --> 00:52:14,599
Everything's okay.

621
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,471
Everything's okay.

622
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:27,845
I'll see you soon.

623
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:31,849
Goodbye.

624
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:44,394
"How sorry I was I had to
leave before seeing you awake."

625
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:49,267
"But I intend to make up for it with a
whole lifetime of watching you wake up"

626
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,768
"and go to sleep"

627
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,271
"in our very own bed."

628
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:57,274
"You can't imagine
how excited I was"

629
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,509
"when I read you're..."

630
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,579
"When I read you were
going to ski again."

631
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,450
"But I knew you wouldn't
settle for anything less."

632
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:09,854
"And by the time I can scrape
together enough money to visit you,"

633
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,890
"you are going to walk to me"

634
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,959
"and into my arms"

635
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,296
"and we are going
to walk away together."

636
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:20,798
"Love, Buddy."

637
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,369
Isn't he wonderful?

638
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:25,836
Yes.

639
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,873
You're a very lucky girl.

640
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,543
Is this where they
keep the gimps?

641
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,811
A.J.!

642
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:36,813
Mom! It's A.J.

643
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:37,882
Audra Jo.

644
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,418
In the flesh.

645
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,953
Look at you, on crutches.

646
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,455
Grotesque, right?

647
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,757
No. Fantastic.

648
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,726
Unbelievable.

649
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:50,995
Come here. Touch me.

650
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:53,830
How'd you get here?

651
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,332
I hitchhiked.

652
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,834
I did. I hitched a ride
with my therapist.

653
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,836
His family lives up here.

654
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,738
And he's cute, too.
So what do you think of that?

655
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,908
I think that's great.

656
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:14,518
Open up.

657
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,553
No.

658
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:31,936
Well, I gotta go.

659
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:36,941
You ever want to see me again?

660
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,720
You know what they say,
"If your best friends won't tell you..."

661
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,418
What do you want me to do?

662
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:49,619
Give up?

663
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,655
Stop trying?

664
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:52,689
For what?

665
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,524
An acting award?

666
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:55,859
To walk.

667
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,394
What's so great about walking?

668
00:54:57,395 --> 00:54:59,763
For gosh sake,
a three year old can walk.

669
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,030
Well, I can't.

670
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,766
I can't even move.

671
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,468
Well, then face it.

672
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:06,903
Admit it, Jill.
Quit playing the heroine.

673
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:10,440
As I remember,
you were pretty heroic yourself.

674
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,576
Seems to me,
you did a lot of laughing.

675
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:15,360
Yeah. Well, I didn't tell people
I was gonna climb Mount Everest.

676
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:18,047
Take it from a veteran gimp.

677
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,351
You got to see what you are
and say what you are,

678
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:24,179
before you'll be willing to work
with what little you've got left.

679
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:26,122
Audra Jo,

680
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,960
what if I don't have
anything left at all?

681
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:34,398
Then you'll learn to
paint with your teeth.

682
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,600
What's happened to you?

683
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:38,602
Same thing that'll
happen to you.

684
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:40,103
There's only one thing
that kills cripples

685
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:41,939
and that's taking
themselves too seriously.

686
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,443
You've got arms, Audra Jo.

687
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:49,546
Sure. Come to C.R.C.,
I'll show you somebody without a face.

688
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:51,581
I'll show you a baby
living in an iron lung.

689
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:52,882
Stop it.

690
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,951
So quit moaning about
your Olympic medals

691
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,721
and start thanking God
you still got your head.

692
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,690
Anything else
you pick up is gravy.

693
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,134
Audra Jo.

694
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:12,569
What?

695
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:17,040
They say I could have won.

696
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,142
Did know that?

697
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:20,478
Won what?

698
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,013
The Snow Cup.

699
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,554
The Snow Cup?

700
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:32,957
Wasn't that the race
that ended your career?

701
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:45,168
"An iron willed spirit"

702
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:48,405
"declaring from a hospital bed
she's going to ski again."

703
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,076
They say you're going
to ski again, honey girl.

704
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,211
And you will.

705
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,081
You will ski again.

706
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:07,190
In the spring I was moved
to a hospital in Los Angeles

707
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:09,926
and here, the job
of discovering what I had

708
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,429
and what I didn't have,
began in earnest.

709
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,098
That's it, Jill.

710
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,634
Keep... Keep pulling
with your upper arm.

711
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:19,703
Keep your head forward,
keep pulling

712
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:21,404
forward with your upper arm.

713
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:25,141
I began to become familiar with
words like extensors and flexors

714
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:28,077
and deltoids and trapeziums.

715
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,047
And I worked harder than
I've ever worked in my life.

716
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:34,951
Keep going. That's it.
That's it, Jill. That's very good.

717
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,186
Very good.

718
00:57:39,524 --> 00:57:41,858
Nice easy stretch now. Come on.

719
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:43,861
Easy. There we go.

720
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,868
Hi, I'm Dr. Enders.

721
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,603
Hi, Doc.

722
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:55,271
I can save you some time.

723
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:57,507
I have biceps but no triceps,

724
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,609
deltoids but no pecs,

725
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,045
well, just a little bit
of pecs on the left side,

726
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,279
but not much,

727
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,214
I'll admit that's
a little unusual,

728
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,916
but it's a transverse fracture,

729
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:08,752
so the left side's
a little stronger.

730
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:10,119
I see.

731
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,187
How're you feeling?

732
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:14,090
Just fine. How are you?

733
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,192
I want you to straighten your
fingers out now. All right.

734
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:18,261
I want to feel
pressure on my finger.

735
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:19,741
Okay.
All right, go ahead and push.

736
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:21,965
Push.

737
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:23,633
Not your arm, Jill,
you're moving your arms.

738
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:24,801
Okay.

739
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:26,103
Okay, try again. Push.

740
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:28,705
That's still your arm.

741
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:30,640
Right.

742
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:33,009
We'll try it one more...
One more time.

743
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,010
Okay.

744
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:39,749
Okay.

745
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:44,220
Try not to look at your arm.

746
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:46,569
Just concentrate on the pad
and we'll see what happens.

747
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:56,867
There.

748
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,603
That's it.

749
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,705
Just concern yourself
with your shoulder.

750
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:05,098
Let your shoulder do all the upward
movements and gravity do the downward ones.

751
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,214
That's it.

752
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:14,218
Come on. More with the shoulder.

753
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,587
Aha, that's right.

754
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:22,866
More of the shoulder. More.

755
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:30,667
Push. You can do it.

756
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:32,837
- Come on. Come on.
- Push, Jill. Push.

757
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:36,139
Let's go.

758
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,942
Come on. Come on.

759
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,647
- Come on, Jill.
- Push.

760
00:59:43,648 --> 00:59:45,248
Come on, Jill.

761
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,083
- Let's go.
- You can do it.

762
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,318
Come on, do it.

763
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,828
How's it look? You look fine.

764
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:00,864
You look beautiful.

765
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:02,165
Go over there and see how
it looks from a distance.

766
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,300
Great. Just great.

767
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,035
Where are the potato chips?
In your lap.

768
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,271
No, go on.

769
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:26,657
Hi.

770
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,359
Come on in.

771
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,807
You look beautiful.

772
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,143
Do you think? Yes.

773
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:59,423
Buddy, I missed you.

774
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,259
I missed you.

775
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:05,696
Could you kiss me?

776
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:21,177
Are you all right?

777
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,880
I'm wonderful.

778
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,084
I tried to write every week.

779
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:28,753
You did.

780
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,456
Well, it's 'cause I tried.

781
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:42,366
You want to see
something exciting?

782
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:45,068
You want to show me?

783
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:46,303
If you want to see.

784
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,406
Well, that's what I came for.

785
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,799
Well, go over there
and sit down.

786
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,278
You don't need any help?

787
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,847
You sure?

788
01:01:57,848 --> 01:01:59,448
Just go over there and watch.

789
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,484
All right.

790
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:07,958
Now, sit down.

791
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:18,802
Come on. I'm waiting.

792
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:20,470
Hold your breath
and don't say a word.

793
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:23,407
It takes
tremendous concentration.

794
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,512
Come on, Jill.
I've been waiting a long time for this.

795
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:32,081
Okay.

796
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:36,286
Watch carefully. 'Cause the
hand is quicker than the eye.

797
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:50,160
It didn't even break.

798
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:54,264
Didn't you see what I did?

799
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:03,573
That's the hardest thing of all.

800
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:13,217
Jill, aren't you gonna walk?

801
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,387
Walk?

802
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:21,491
Yeah. I thought you were...

803
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,164
No.

804
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,936
I'm never gonna walk.

805
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:12,142
Buddy called me a week later and
I never heard from him again.

806
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:00,289
How about taking
her home for a while?

807
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,758
Physically she's as capable
as she'll ever be.

808
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,028
It might be a nice break
before she's transferred to the

809
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:07,530
California
Rehabilitation Center.

810
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:10,166
Well, that's another
thing, Dr. Enders.

811
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:13,436
She doesn't want to go to C.R.C.

812
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:17,206
Every time I mention
rehabilitation,

813
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:20,177
she says she doesn't need anybody
to teach her how to sell pencils.

814
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:42,666
What do you want?

815
01:06:45,169 --> 01:06:46,503
Time for a shot.

816
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:48,771
A shot of what?

817
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:52,076
Of what you need
the most, my dear.

818
01:06:54,578 --> 01:06:57,480
God, I don't believe it.

819
01:06:57,481 --> 01:07:00,449
Well, you better believe it, Ace. And
you better get your ass out of this bed.

820
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,385
What are you doing here?

821
01:07:01,386 --> 01:07:02,651
You got a coat?

822
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:03,786
What do you think you're doing?

823
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:04,821
Busting out.

824
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:11,627
What's this bottle attached to?
It's permanent.

825
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:12,729
Then it goes with.

826
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:15,799
Who's he? My only friend.

827
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:23,106
Dick, I'm warning you.
I can't be moved like this.

828
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:24,840
Who says so? The doctors.

829
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:26,242
Doctors don't know crap. Dick!

830
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:29,778
Listen. One more word out of you
and I'm going to paddle your butt.

831
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,514
I wouldn't feel it if you did.

832
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:32,776
I'll make you glad you can't.

833
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:35,451
Jesus, you're heavy.

834
01:07:35,452 --> 01:07:37,486
You're absolutely crazy.

835
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,314
Yeah. Well, you're not the
first to notice.

836
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:49,733
Morning. Good morning.

837
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,442
Watch out, My God!

838
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:02,846
My God. Dick, you're crazy.

839
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:07,816
Gangway. Paraplegic
coming through.

840
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,853
Dick, watch out for the people.

841
01:08:11,355 --> 01:08:12,789
Look out!

842
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,293
Look. Dick, the
light's changing.

843
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:18,761
Nobody runs over wheelchairs.

844
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,831
We're gonna get killed. The light changed.
We're gonna get killed.

845
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:26,703
What are you doing?

846
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:33,276
Okay. I got a few things to say to you.
I just wanted a little privacy.

847
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:36,145
Why don't you say them
to your fiancee?

848
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:37,746
'Cause I don't have one.
She wouldn't have me.

849
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,216
I don't blame her.
I wouldn't have you, either.

850
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:42,151
Yeah? You better think
twice about that.

851
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:44,320
'Cause you're gonna have
a hard time attracting men

852
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:47,523
sitting around in that damn hospital
bed like a big lump of clay.

853
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:50,226
Eat me. I suppose

854
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:52,828
if you moan and groan enough you
might make some jerk like Buddy Werner

855
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,297
feel a little sorry for you.

856
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,365
Okay, that's enough.

857
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:59,768
No, that's not enough. 'Cause I'm gonna
stick around here until you shape up.

858
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:01,604
You understand that?

859
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:04,940
I don't care if you can't ski.
And I don't care you can't walk.

860
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,376
I don't care if you crawl
around like a damn lizard,

861
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:09,678
you're not getting
any sympathy from me.

862
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,580
You conceited ass.
What makes you think I want you?

863
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:13,649
What do you think you're doing out
here in the middle of the street?

864
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,917
I don't care if you
want me or not?

865
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:17,253
You can't park here.
I got nothing better to do with my time.

866
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:19,355
Get out of the way.
I guess that shows you what a loser I am.

867
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:20,356
This is a public thoroughfare.
I'm sorry.

868
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,258
Wait. Wait. I can't
hear what you're saying.

869
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,359
You should be in the loony bin.

870
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,494
You want your oil checked.

871
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:27,830
What's going on? What the hell do
you think you're doing with my car?

872
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,966
Get away from that car.
Are you out of your mind?

873
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:34,670
This is private property. You can't
do that. Get away from this car.

874
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,373
You're crazy as a loon.
Come on, get out of here.

875
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:38,707
Wait a minute.

876
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,243
You're a quart low.

877
01:09:40,244 --> 01:09:42,478
No. I Just had it
changed last week.

878
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:43,912
Are you crazy?

879
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,814
Put that back in or I'm
gonna get out of here.

880
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:49,618
I'm telling you,
I'm gonna call the authorities about this.

881
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:53,256
I'm gonna sue you.
I've got a good lawyer, young man.

882
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:54,857
Okay. You got any money for me?

883
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,894
Come on, I want my money. Hey!

884
01:09:58,762 --> 01:09:59,863
You're crazy.

885
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,354
I come out of the plane and
suddenly we were surrounded

886
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,022
by all these guys
with machine guns.

887
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:01,757
They thought we were
spying or something.

888
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,859
Machine guns.
Did you hear that, Dad?

889
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,730
What are your plans, Dick?
I mean the future?

890
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:12,035
Don't have any. I just
take one day at a time.

891
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,643
Dick, would you
cut my meat, please?

892
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:22,045
Cut it yourself.

893
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,020
You can't spoil her, you know.

894
01:11:28,385 --> 01:11:29,820
That's been her
problem all along.

895
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:34,590
Anyway, so I'm sitting
there in the jungle.

896
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,525
I don't know any of these
people, you know.

897
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:38,727
I mean, they don't know what
government I'm from.

898
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:42,565
They locked me up for... I think I
was in there for a couple of days,

899
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:44,901
finally hitchhiked
my way up to Acapulco...

900
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:47,970
Come on. Keep cool,
baby. Come on.

901
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,104
I'll slip out of this.

902
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:51,474
I've got you. Now, just come on.

903
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:55,544
Push off. Easy. Easy.
There you go.

904
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,680
Don't worry about it.
I don't want to do this.

905
01:11:57,681 --> 01:11:59,081
That's just about enough.
No. Hold it, Bill.

906
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,983
Dad, leave him alone.

907
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,718
He knows what he's doing.

908
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,388
That's not bad?

909
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:09,858
It's just water.
I'm gonna slip through here.

910
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:10,926
Don't you want to get your hair
wet, or something?

911
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,762
I'm wet already.
I'm wet already.

912
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:22,939
Put your arms out. Put your arms out here.
You're okay. Like a motorboat.

913
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:28,043
Dick! Don't leave me out here.

914
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:32,080
Dick! Don't let go of me,
please. Get me out of here.

915
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:37,721
Dick. Dick, get me out of here.
Dick, I'm slipping. Dick.

916
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:41,925
Dick. Dick. Dick.

917
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:51,100
Jill!

918
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,009
Hold on. I'll get you.

919
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:06,616
You all right?

920
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:11,387
Easy. Easy.

921
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:17,461
Are you all right?
Okay. I'm sorry.

922
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:21,698
I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.

923
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:26,246
I Just wanted you to see that
you could do it, that's all.

924
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,438
You okay?

925
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:32,141
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

926
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:35,711
I'm sorry.

927
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:36,779
Why, Dick?

928
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,781
I didn't mean to.

929
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:41,617
What do you think?

930
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,486
I don't know.

931
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:45,188
I got the house all
planned in my head.

932
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:49,224
No stairs, just ramps.

933
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:51,126
All the kitchen stuff
built low to the ground.

934
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:52,962
Even the bathroom sink,
two feet high.

935
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:58,434
I can't have kids,
you know, Dick.

936
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:00,870
I figured that.

937
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:08,111
I don't have any feeling

938
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,682
from my neck down.

939
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:21,057
So I don't know
about making love.

940
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,106
It's not all it's
cracked up to be.

941
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,964
You'll want more than me.

942
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,634
Couldn't handle it.

943
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:35,203
No, you'd get tired of it.

944
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,606
You'd go off doing
loop-the-loops in your air plane.

945
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,173
No, no, no more.
I'm gonna get a job.

946
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,645
I can't do that to you.

947
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:44,560
For Chrissakes,
somebody's gotta do it to me.

948
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:48,917
What is it?

949
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:52,188
Now, you tell me what...
Why you're fighting this.

950
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,190
I don't know.

951
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:01,030
There must be something...

952
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:10,774
Something to keep me
from being so useless.

953
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,580
Seems like you and me
got the same problem.

954
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:22,185
Wipe my nose, okay?

955
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:26,155
Only if you love me.

956
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,629
I do. Honestly, I do.

957
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:53,316
I am gonna build
that house. Okay?

958
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:58,320
Well, hey, turns out
you don't want it,

959
01:15:58,321 --> 01:16:00,666
then I'll just find some other
gimp to move in, that's all.

960
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:01,891
Okay.

961
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:06,329
You hear something?

962
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:13,069
It's a school bell
at the Indian Reservation.

963
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:16,071
What kind?

964
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,106
Paiute.

965
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,909
You know anybody down there?

966
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:21,910
No.

967
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:26,882
We had a couple of
kids in grammar school.

968
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:29,384
But they stayed
mostly to themselves.

969
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:31,720
Yeah. Yeah, they usually do.

970
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:32,956
Why is that?

971
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:37,292
Well, you ever been down there?

972
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:38,961
No.

973
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:40,763
You mean, you've lived
in this town all your life

974
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:41,997
and you've never
been down there once?

975
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:44,199
Right.

976
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,766
Well, I think it's about time
that you got down there, then.

977
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:01,884
I don't understand it.
Why doesn't somebody help them?

978
01:17:01,885 --> 01:17:05,353
I guess everybody's busy enough
trying to figure out their own lives.

979
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,890
Why do they stay in this place?

980
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:09,825
Why don't they leave?

981
01:17:09,826 --> 01:17:11,928
They got nowhere else to go.

982
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:22,104
The problem is teachers, Jill.

983
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:26,141
There just isn't any money in
teaching in an Indian Reservation.

984
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:29,378
So all the good ones go down
to places like Los Angeles.

985
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,948
That's not fair.

986
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,318
Lots of things
aren't fair, honey girl.

987
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,020
I at least had a chance.

988
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:40,756
I mean, those people don't
have a chance at all.

989
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:43,358
Mom, Dad, Dick
let me fly his plane.

990
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:45,828
I did not. Don't you go
getting me in trouble.

991
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:47,395
I didn't. I swear.

992
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:48,731
Checking her out?

993
01:17:48,732 --> 01:17:49,799
Taking off.

994
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,401
Where to?

995
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:54,838
Home, I guess.

996
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,874
You leaving?

997
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:01,093
Well, you didn't expect me
to stay forever, did you?

998
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:11,220
It's just gonna be
for a little while.

999
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:13,856
Jill.

1000
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:18,126
Why didn't you tell me?
It happened so fast.

1001
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,929
You're gonna go get rehabilitated,
I'm gonna build that house

1002
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,298
and in the springtime...

1003
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:25,301
The spring's so far.

1004
01:18:29,172 --> 01:18:30,706
They say that every winter.

1005
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,076
Dick.

1006
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:40,949
Will you stop it?
You're gonna make me cry, too.

1007
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:44,387
It's good to have friends
that can make you cry.

1008
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:51,027
Not everybody's got friends
that do that, you know.

1009
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:55,530
Okay. You'll be all right, now.

1010
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:57,400
You're gonna be all right.

1011
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:06,342
Relax. Relax. Relax now.
Relax. Relax.

1012
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:09,045
Be easy.

1013
01:19:11,915 --> 01:19:15,383
I'll be back soon.
I'll be back soon.

1014
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:17,485
I'll be back soon, Jill.

1015
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:21,423
You okay? You okay?

1016
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,827
Okay? Okay.

1017
01:21:06,662 --> 01:21:08,563
You're gonna love
it here, believe me.

1018
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:12,500
It's not so much like a rehabilitation
center as it is a great big party.

1019
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,469
She's our best recruiter.

1020
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,371
And wait till you meet the other
live-ins, they're fantastic.

1021
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,073
Fantastic is the word.

1022
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:20,008
Well, they're a
little weird at first,

1023
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:22,227
but once you get to know
them, they're really great.

1024
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:33,121
Guys, this is Jill. Jill,
this is Kenny and Cookie.

1025
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:35,323
Neil. Welcome to the circus.

1026
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:36,559
Bill, George.

1027
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:42,932
Pat, and there's Willis
and Lee. Lee Zadroga.

1028
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,336
Bill, did you see that?

1029
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:49,437
No, I didn't see that.
I think it was Willy Mays.

1030
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:52,307
Duke Snider.

1031
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:54,642
Willy Mays.

1032
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,478
Duke Snider, right? Over the shoulder.
Over the shoulder.

1033
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:58,981
It was Duke Snider
back off-center to you...

1034
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:00,682
Can't you tell the difference
between a black man and a white man?

1035
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:03,252
Yes, I can, man. That's why
I say it was Willy Mays.

1036
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:18,067
Jill was a famous person.
Did anyone here know that?

1037
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:21,003
What'd you do, Jill?

1038
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:22,237
Nothing, really.

1039
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:23,972
She had her picture
on the cover of...

1040
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:25,573
Popular Mechanics Magazine.

1041
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:27,676
Yeah. Yeah. She was
gimp of the month.

1042
01:22:30,346 --> 01:22:31,613
What're you gonna do now?

1043
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:34,616
I don't know.

1044
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,952
Try to be useful.

1045
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:39,087
Useful how?

1046
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:45,160
Try teaching or something.

1047
01:22:45,161 --> 01:22:47,857
And after that, she's gonna go
learn how to be a brain surgeon.

1048
01:22:49,432 --> 01:22:53,035
She skied. She was America's
hope for the Olympics.

1049
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:56,372
They can strap skis on that thing.
Go ahead on, go back to skiing.

1050
01:22:57,573 --> 01:23:00,408
Come on, Jill, say something.

1051
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:02,377
Maybe she can't do nothing
without the press around.

1052
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:04,679
You know. All that notoriety.

1053
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,448
Jill, on the basketball court,

1054
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:09,784
we really thought we were
somebody, and we'd be a team.

1055
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:12,154
We come off the court
we're really happy.

1056
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:15,157
Then the one guy on the team
would always remark, he says,

1057
01:23:15,158 --> 01:23:18,361
"What are we so happy about?
All we beat was a bunch of crips."

1058
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:23,431
It's really good from this chair.
I really love this chair.

1059
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:25,200
This beautiful world.

1060
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:27,269
Wait a minute. She's only been
here for a couple of hours,

1061
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,337
so let's cool it down a little.

1062
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,139
She still wants sympathy, Ken.

1063
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,207
Well, you know
where you'll find sympathy

1064
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,341
in the dictionary, don't you?

1065
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:34,643
Between shit and suicide.

1066
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:42,650
They live in a very
insulated little world here,

1067
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,620
newcomers are a threat.

1068
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:47,790
Especially newcomers
with grandiose ideas.

1069
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,259
What's so grandiose
about teaching?

1070
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,295
It's been tried before.

1071
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:56,664
There's not a school in the country
that'll accept teachers in wheelchairs.

1072
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:59,167
For that reason, paraplegics
and quadriplegics

1073
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:01,304
can't even apply
for a teaching certificate.

1074
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,606
That's not fair.

1075
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:06,441
Sure it isn't fair.

1076
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:09,144
But the outside world assumes
that if your toes have gone numb,

1077
01:24:09,145 --> 01:24:11,346
your brains have gone numb, too.

1078
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:14,216
Consequently, there's
a lot of lost potential.

1079
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:17,152
People who swallow defeat because it's
being stuffed down their throats so hard,

1080
01:24:17,153 --> 01:24:18,762
that if they don't,
they'll suffocate.

1081
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,495
Why hasn't it happened to you?

1082
01:24:24,227 --> 01:24:26,629
Well, in some ways I have
it easier than they do.

1083
01:24:29,132 --> 01:24:30,480
They're all permanent cripples.

1084
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:33,435
Are you gonna walk again?

1085
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:36,304
No. I'm gonna die.

1086
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:39,341
They give me a year to live.

1087
01:24:39,342 --> 01:24:42,545
So time is very precious to me.
I can't afford to waste any of it.

1088
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:45,681
What do you do?

1089
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,351
Do with your time?

1090
01:24:49,352 --> 01:24:53,822
I go to school. U.C.I.A.
I'm working on my master's.

1091
01:24:57,693 --> 01:25:00,262
Are you gonna finish?

1092
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:03,166
It's gonna be close.
What are you gonna do?

1093
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,600
What do you mean?

1094
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,103
I mean, when are you
going to start school?

1095
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:11,573
They wouldn't accept me.

1096
01:25:11,574 --> 01:25:13,841
My high school
grades were lousy.

1097
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,511
Let me tell you something.

1098
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,316
When the body goes,
the mind can compensate.

1099
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:24,686
Do you understand that?

1100
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:27,322
Like a blind man whose sense of
hearing suddenly grows sharper.

1101
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:29,424
Yeah, I know that.

1102
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:30,758
But how are they gonna know?

1103
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,760
Because I'm gonna tell 'em.

1104
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:35,363
I recommended Audra Jo and Cookie.
I can do the same for you.

1105
01:25:35,364 --> 01:25:37,199
I might let you down.

1106
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,235
My brain has always been the
weakest muscle in my body.

1107
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:43,372
Stretch it. Exercise it.
Put the damn thing into training then.

1108
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:48,611
Okay? Say okay.

1109
01:25:52,415 --> 01:25:53,582
Okay.

1110
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,234
You hope? Yeah.

1111
01:26:13,236 --> 01:26:15,470
Hurry up. Okay.

1112
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:16,571
You ready? I'll take your purse.

1113
01:26:16,572 --> 01:26:17,640
Are we ready?

1114
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:25,913
What am I supposed
to be, Tarzan?

1115
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:28,283
Now, the registry office is right down
the end there, and you turn right.

1116
01:26:28,284 --> 01:26:29,545
See those pillars down there?

1117
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:41,996
Okay, I'll take the purses.

1118
01:26:41,997 --> 01:26:43,198
Great.

1119
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:48,804
I got it. Okay.

1120
01:26:53,242 --> 01:26:55,443
That's style. How about that?

1121
01:26:55,444 --> 01:26:57,512
You next, Sweet Pea.

1122
01:26:57,513 --> 01:26:58,547
Thank you.

1123
01:27:12,295 --> 01:27:14,363
Okay, come on, splinterass.

1124
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:17,900
Now, Cookie,
this is dead weight.

1125
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:20,936
Careful.

1126
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:36,751
Now, don't panic.
There's got to be a way out of this.

1127
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,020
Speak to me.

1128
01:27:43,626 --> 01:27:45,561
What is this, a freak show?

1129
01:27:47,463 --> 01:27:49,631
We ought to charge for this.

1130
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:52,334
Contrary to popular thought

1131
01:27:52,335 --> 01:27:54,035
what I myself was taught.

1132
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:56,504
When I was learning about the...

1133
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:58,139
Don't try to copy
everything he says.

1134
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:02,545
Just the important points. Use an outline
form or isolated words if you have to.

1135
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:05,980
...probable estimate.

1136
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:08,850
And the way we found that out is
a man by the name of Goldstein.

1137
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:14,789
Took a small tube, opaque on
the sides, and glued it.

1138
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:18,893
"Once there was a turkey, his
name was Timothy Tom Turkey."

1139
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:23,698
The most significant thing that
began to happen was the children.

1140
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:27,069
There were dozens at C.R.C.
and I found myself drawn to them,

1141
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:30,772
And they to me.

1142
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:35,443
"Consequently Timothy Tom
got very skinny."

1143
01:28:35,444 --> 01:28:40,615
"But at Thanksgiving time when
everybody goes out to get their turkeys,"

1144
01:28:40,616 --> 01:28:42,717
"nobody wanted Timothy Tom."

1145
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,052
"And let him run wild."

1146
01:28:47,423 --> 01:28:51,993
When you do a term paper,
you got to write like a writer.

1147
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:55,530
Make every sentence
say exactly what you mean.

1148
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:57,632
If you got a big idea,
then you write a big sentence.

1149
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:59,067
If not, don't. Simple.

1150
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,979
You're right, it does
look like "bowquet."

1151
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,782
But it's pronounced "bouquet."

1152
01:29:14,817 --> 01:29:16,051
I like "bowquet" better.

1153
01:29:17,653 --> 01:29:20,522
So do I. But if you say
it like that,

1154
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:22,857
nobody's gonna know what
you're talking about.

1155
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,559
Why don't they write it
the right way?

1156
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,734
They're trying to trick us.

1157
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:28,696
You know what I mean?

1158
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,958
You know something, Jill?
I wish you were my teacher.

1159
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:35,704
You know something, Matt?
I wish I were, too.

1160
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:38,840
Don't do it, Jill.

1161
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:40,875
What have I got to lose?

1162
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,477
Faith in mankind.

1163
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:43,778
You like to get
your teeth kicked in?

1164
01:29:43,779 --> 01:29:45,880
I can kick back.

1165
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:47,849
I can tell you what
he's gonna say right now.

1166
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:50,418
I'll get it firsthand.

1167
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:57,058
"You people are an inspiration to me.
An absolute inspiration."

1168
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:02,897
You people are an inspiration to me.
An absolute inspiration.

1169
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:06,434
The way you carry on in the
face of these handicaps.

1170
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:11,038
Just makes
me feel very small, indeed.

1171
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,041
We were talking about
a teaching certificate.

1172
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:17,645
I know. I'm afraid it would
be a waste of your time.

1173
01:30:17,646 --> 01:30:18,880
I can't let you do it.

1174
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:21,015
I have all the time
in the world.

1175
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:24,986
But it's my responsibility to teach
you something that you can do.

1176
01:30:24,987 --> 01:30:27,555
I can teach. I know it.

1177
01:30:27,556 --> 01:30:29,591
No school will take you.

1178
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:32,960
Not without a teaching certificate.
Of course they won't.

1179
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:35,830
It's not the certificate.

1180
01:30:35,831 --> 01:30:40,167
I mean, be realistic.
It's your handicap.

1181
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:44,506
At this moment in my life,
my only handicap is you.

1182
01:30:44,507 --> 01:30:46,808
I want you to know I
understand how you feel.

1183
01:30:46,809 --> 01:30:49,944
I'm a man who likes
challenges, himself.

1184
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:53,114
And what challenges are those?

1185
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:57,018
Well, my position here.

1186
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:59,121
That was a
considerable challenge.

1187
01:31:00,255 --> 01:31:01,590
Why is that?

1188
01:31:03,559 --> 01:31:06,694
Well, I had to work
and very hard.

1189
01:31:06,695 --> 01:31:10,132
Do you know what it's like to
struggle to pick up a piece of Jell-O?

1190
01:31:11,233 --> 01:31:13,835
Try it sometime
without any hands.

1191
01:31:13,836 --> 01:31:16,103
I don't know what that
has to do with anything?

1192
01:31:16,104 --> 01:31:19,641
Have you ever tried to slide onto a
toilet seat without the use of your legs?

1193
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,743
Not knowing whether
you were on or off?

1194
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:23,878
Because you couldn't feel the
porcelain underneath your butt?

1195
01:31:23,879 --> 01:31:25,212
Miss Kinmont!

1196
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:27,148
Don't patronize me.

1197
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,617
I'm only trying to
make the point that...

1198
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:32,520
Have you ever got an itch on your nose
but you can't reach up to scratch it?

1199
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:33,855
That's enough.

1200
01:31:33,856 --> 01:31:35,690
No, it's not enough.

1201
01:31:35,691 --> 01:31:38,292
You want to hear
about challenges.

1202
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:41,128
I'll tell you the
meaning of the word.

1203
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:42,782
All right, now,
you've made your point.

1204
01:31:43,766 --> 01:31:45,167
Let me make mine.

1205
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:52,274
Paraplegics are unacceptable as
teachers at any school in this country.

1206
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:57,545
Until you find one
that will hire you,

1207
01:31:57,546 --> 01:32:00,148
I cannot allow you to study
for a teaching certificate.

1208
01:32:01,884 --> 01:32:03,051
Can I hold you to that?

1209
01:32:04,553 --> 01:32:05,854
Until hell freezes over.

1210
01:32:11,093 --> 01:32:13,961
The one thing I knew
about that no one else did,

1211
01:32:13,962 --> 01:32:17,699
is the Indian School
back home in Bishop.

1212
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:21,669
I went there immediately, arguing that
if they needed qualified teachers,

1213
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,062
they'd have to take me as I was.

1214
01:32:27,309 --> 01:32:28,543
What'd they say?

1215
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,824
They said, "Yes." They'll
take her as a teacher.

1216
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:37,820
Let's go.

1217
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:44,291
It was a beginning.
The start of a new existence.

1218
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:47,930
I could rely on myself again
and make my own way.

1219
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:52,266
Dick?

1220
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:54,769
Hey, are you feeling all right?

1221
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,838
Yes. Everything's fine.

1222
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:58,840
I want you to come
for my birthday.

1223
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:00,374
Your birthday?

1224
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,710
Aren't you a little old
for birthday parties?

1225
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:04,146
I've something
I want to tell you.

1226
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,248
Tell me.

1227
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:09,617
I can't. I'll tell you
when you come.

1228
01:33:09,618 --> 01:33:10,786
I wait for no one.

1229
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,854
You'll have to wait.

1230
01:33:12,855 --> 01:33:15,389
Jill.

1231
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:19,226
Help me understand this, you have...
You have called me long distance

1232
01:33:19,227 --> 01:33:21,028
to tell me that you
can't talk to me?

1233
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:22,943
I mean what is that,
I don't understand that.

1234
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:26,101
Jill. Hello?

1235
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:29,671
Hello? Hello.

1236
01:33:29,672 --> 01:33:31,306
Okay. I can tell you now.

1237
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:36,111
I love you.

1238
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:39,081
And I want to marry you

1239
01:33:43,686 --> 01:33:45,120
I'm gonna hold you to it.

1240
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:50,758
Don't start the party
without me, okay?

1241
01:33:50,759 --> 01:33:53,160
Atta girl, Linda.
Smooth and pretty.

1242
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:57,131
While I waited for Dick,
I went back up the mountain.

1243
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,901
And there in the last
snow of the season,

1244
01:33:59,902 --> 01:34:02,404
I saw clearly that life
had gone on without me.

1245
01:34:05,073 --> 01:34:07,008
All right, you have to
keep 'em flat right?

1246
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:08,643
And work those knees. Okay?

1247
01:34:15,751 --> 01:34:17,419
Who would have believed it?

1248
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:22,791
What're you thinking?

1249
01:34:24,259 --> 01:34:26,695
How damn lucky I am.

1250
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:38,372
Don't worry. He'll
be here soon, teacher.

1251
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:40,808
Boy, it's gonna be hard getting
used to calling you that.

1252
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,845
More presents? More presents.

1253
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:46,782
And you're not to open a
single present until he comes.

1254
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,261
Any sign of the Red Baron?

1255
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:09,837
Soda Springs Airport?

1256
01:35:09,838 --> 01:35:12,808
Say, I was wondering if you could
tell me when Dick Buek took off.

1257
01:35:15,477 --> 01:35:17,812
Two days ago?

1258
01:35:17,813 --> 01:35:21,916
No, no. We were just kind of expecting
him this morning, that's all.

1259
01:35:21,917 --> 01:35:24,987
I'm sure he'll be along.
Right. Thank you.

1260
01:35:33,762 --> 01:35:36,806
He's about the best flyer in the
whole world, don't you think, teacher?

1261
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:52,279
I'm sure he just ran into bad
weather, he'll be calling any minute.

1262
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,449
You know how he likes
to scare people.

1263
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:58,086
It's a fact. He enjoys
dramatic entrances.

1264
01:36:13,836 --> 01:36:14,837
Hello?

1265
01:36:18,073 --> 01:36:21,175
It's him. It's Mr. Buek
from Soda Springs.

1266
01:36:21,176 --> 01:36:22,810
He never left home.

1267
01:36:22,811 --> 01:36:24,246
He must've turned back.

1268
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:28,149
Yes, this is
Mr. Kinmont. I'll take it.

1269
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:29,150
Hello, Dick?

1270
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:39,262
It's Dick's father.
He wants to talk to you.

1271
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,231
Somebody take me outside.

1272
01:36:45,267 --> 01:36:46,935
Bobby, take me outside, please.

1273
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:51,873
I'll go with you.

1274
01:36:51,874 --> 01:36:53,308
No, I'd rather be by myself.

1275
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:05,153
Hello? Yes,
this is Bill Kinmont.

1276
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:12,560
I see.

1277
01:37:14,296 --> 01:37:16,031
Yes, I understand.

1278
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:21,469
I'm so sorry.

1279
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:25,007
So sorry.

1280
01:37:29,144 --> 01:37:31,013
Yes, I'll tell her.

1281
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,450
Is there anything we can do?

1282
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:42,958
We...
We all loved him very much.

1283
01:37:46,128 --> 01:37:47,629
We'll miss him so much.

1284
01:38:17,926 --> 01:38:19,527
Anybody ever ask you?

1285
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:21,595
What?

1286
01:38:21,596 --> 01:38:23,165
To get married?

1287
01:38:26,468 --> 01:38:28,937
If he asked you,
how come you didn't?

1288
01:38:32,474 --> 01:38:35,476
I think it's time we go home.

1289
01:38:35,477 --> 01:38:37,912
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1290
01:38:45,487 --> 01:38:50,324
I try not to let it, but sometimes
it all plays back in my head.

1291
01:38:50,325 --> 01:38:53,060
And when it does,
I remember the words

1292
01:38:53,061 --> 01:38:55,497
that Dick Buek said to me
the last time I saw him.

1293
01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:00,567
"How lucky I am to
have known somebody

1294
01:39:00,568 --> 01:39:04,106
or something that saying
goodbye to is so damned awful."
