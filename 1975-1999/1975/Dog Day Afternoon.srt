1
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,958
Well, it has to be approved from downtown.

2
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,671
It's handled through this office,
but it requires downtown approval.

3
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,300
I don't know.

4
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,430
It has been submitted.

5
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,174
Sylvia, can you help me with this?

6
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,884
Coming.

7
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,111
Closing time. Going in?

8
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,489
Yes, sir.

9
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:22,789
Okay.

10
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,919
You the manager?

11
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:39,802
It looks...

12
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,802
Just keep talking like nothing was wrong.

13
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:44,972
Listen...

14
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,972
Let me call you back.

15
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,689
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

16
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,610
What are you talking about?

17
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,197
Maybe we should take
something smaller, Sonny.

18
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,953
You crazy? He started already.
He's got the gun out.

19
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,872
Go on, go over by the door.

20
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,752
Get over by the door.

21
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:07,720
Freeze!

22
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,264
Nobody move! Get over there!

23
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:12,351
Okay.

24
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,351
All right. Get away from those alarms.

25
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,479
Now get in the center.

26
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,607
He moves, take his head off.

27
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,526
Put the gun on him!
Get out in the center!

28
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Sonny.

29
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,947
I can't do it, Sonny.

30
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,300
What?

31
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,243
I'm not going to make it, Sonny.

32
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,497
What are you talking about?
Put it on him.

33
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,248
I can't do it, Sonny.

34
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,417
Fuck me. Sal!

35
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,900
- Sal!
- What?

36
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,339
Where are you? He can't make it.

37
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:44,715
Fuck him. Let him go!

38
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,092
Come on, Sonny!

39
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:52,350
All right, let him out. Let him out!

40
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,058
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.

41
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,810
Let him out!

42
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,356
I'm sorry, Sonny.

43
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,358
Shit!

44
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,986
- Stevie, don't take the car.
- How will I get home?

45
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,574
Take the subway. We need the car.

46
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,493
Stevie! The keys!

47
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,205
I'm sorry, Sonny.

48
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,832
All right, lock it.

49
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,130
What do you want?!

50
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,925
Sonny, there's a girl
under that desk over there.

51
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
All right. Come.

52
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,942
All right. We got rid of him.
So now we just move it along. All right, Sal?

53
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,235
- You got them?
- I got them.

54
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,321
Okay. Now what did he say to me?
Wait a minute.

55
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,532
Anybody here? What's this, a squirrel?

56
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,700
Hey, you! Hey!

57
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,951
Come on. Come on.

58
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,496
In the back there.
No one's going to hurt you.

59
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,623
Go ahead, get to the back.

60
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,792
Pull the drapes! Pull the drapes!

61
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,008
Now! You! To the back. To the back here.

62
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,093
Go to him. Right there.

63
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:16,181
Okay. We're going to move this now.
Just moving along. Come on.

64
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,434
Gotcha! Gotcha!

65
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,147
We're moving right along, folks.

66
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:23,147
We're going to get this thing done
in half an hour.

67
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,357
We just got to block....

68
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,989
Knock out the TV.

69
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,365
Here we go.

70
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,201
See?

71
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,286
No replay, folks. No alarms.

72
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,663
Let's get you all fixed up and on your way.

73
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,500
- Right. Okay. Is the vault open?
- I can take care of that.

74
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,752
That's good. Let's go. Take care of it.

75
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,674
Hey! Wait a minute.
What are you trying to do?

76
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,177
Trip the alarm? Use the spot key?

77
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,388
I must have been out of my mind.

78
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,015
Yeah! Well, you get your mind right!

79
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,185
I'm a Catholic and I don't want
to hurt anybody! Understand?

80
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,229
- Yes, sir.
- No alarms!

81
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,313
No alarms!

82
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,232
- Okay.
- No games. All right?

83
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,693
Use the other one.

84
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,154
Miriam...

85
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:13,906
Open the safe.

86
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,509
Put it in this.

87
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,151
What?

88
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,695
That's all there is.

89
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,949
What are you talking about?

90
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,785
They picked it up this afternoon.
There's only $1,100.

91
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,745
- She's telling you the truth.
- He'll shoot me!

92
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't believe it.

93
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,836
I can't believe it!

94
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,922
There's no money here.

95
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,426
- Come on, Sonny, let's do it!
- I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

96
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,397
Too much. This is too much.

97
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,597
This is too much.

98
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,143
All right, come on. Let's go.

99
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,672
Somebody...

100
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,772
You answer it. Watch him, Sal.

101
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,066
You, come with me. Watch him!

102
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,237
- Sit down. Sit down!
- Who's the head teller here?

103
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:36,447
I am.

104
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,621
Open it up.

105
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,417
No, not all of it!

106
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,712
Look, I worked in a bank.
I know the alarms. All right?

107
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,745
Don't play games with me. See?

108
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,966
You take one of these, you go like this,

109
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,843
in here, and out it comes.

110
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,261
You got your hundred.

111
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:00,638
I'll call you back.

112
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,601
No, no, no. It's decoy money. It's marked.

113
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,520
It's shit.

114
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,063
See?

115
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,819
Cheer up, girls! You're going to be
the veterans of a robbery.

116
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,780
You know the bank sends you
a dozen red roses?

117
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,141
Sal...

118
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,741
Let him answer it.

119
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:25,454
Hey, you, manager! Fucker!
Don't get ideas.

120
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,623
I bark, that man there, see him? He bites!

121
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,041
Believe me, I'm on your side.

122
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,334
On my side, shit.

123
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,088
Listen, we got young girls here.
You could watch your language, you know.

124
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,802
I speak what I feel, you know.

125
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:43,472
Watch my language!
Empty the drawer out.

126
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,226
I don't know. You'd have to find out from him.

127
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,311
Traveler's checks.

128
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,064
And the register.

129
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,234
The register!

130
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,613
You've got it. All right, let's go.

131
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,033
I'll take that from you.

132
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,162
All right, Sal, here we go.

133
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
Shit!

134
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,552
Come on.

135
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,001
Shit.

136
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,601
Sonny, what the hell are you doing?

137
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,978
I'm burning the register here.

138
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,650
Moving right along, folks.

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

140
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,489
We're leaving.

141
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,365
Let me have the keys.

142
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,284
Howard, give him the keys.

143
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:49,000
- Come on.
- Howard.

144
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,874
Nobody's going to hurt you.
We're going to leave.

145
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,040
Sonny!

146
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,840
Who's that?

147
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:03,636
It's the insurance guy from across
the street. He probably saw the smoke.

148
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,105
Please, put out the fire.

149
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,787
I'll get some water.

150
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,288
Stay right there!

151
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,288
Please, don't do it! Don't do it!

152
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,794
- I'll call you back later.
- Get rid of him.

153
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:38,462
Get rid of him!

154
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:39,562
Howard.

155
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:41,762
Howard.

156
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,766
Hey. Hey!

157
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,766
- Use your head.
- I can handle it.

158
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,355
- Everything's all right there?
- Yeah.

159
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:02,194
A cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.
It's all okay now.

160
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,406
Then you're okay.

161
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,449
- Thanks for keeping an eye out.
- Okay.

162
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,501
Could you please go now?
We gave you everything we've got.

163
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay, we're going.

164
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,278
Answer the phone.
Sal, get them in the vault.

165
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,778
Come on, in the vault. Come on. Let's go.

166
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,091
- Where is the money?
- I'm getting it! Got it.

167
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:32,983
He's going to come with us. Okay.

168
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,061
Please, don't close the door.
How can we breathe?

169
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:38,433
Right.

170
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,733
Oh, wow. Wait a minute.

171
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,568
- Wait a minute. Listen.
- What?

172
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,488
I'm never going to make this.
I'll have to go to the toilet.

173
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,742
It's no joke!

174
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,037
I've got a terrible fear of being locked in.

175
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,918
All right. Who has to go to the bathroom here?

176
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,169
I do too.

177
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,921
You see? Now they all want to go.

178
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,256
Look, do you want to check it out?

179
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,301
It's the first door on your right.

180
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,181
All right, mouth, let's go.

181
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,519
First door on my right.

182
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,479
It's Maria!

183
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,379
Listen...

184
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:21,899
I forgot she's in there.

185
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,151
It's not her fault, you know.
She's always pulling this.

186
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,445
She's supposed to have 10 minutes.
She takes 15--

187
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,240
Shut up! Let's go! Out!
Nobody goes to the bathroom!

188
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,368
- Let's go! Out!
- We're having a bank robbery.

189
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,288
Mulvaney speaking.

190
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:38,040
Mouth! Mouth!

191
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,125
- Here's your toilet.
- It's for you.

192
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:41,418
What?

193
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:42,670
Telephone call.

194
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:45,631
For you.

195
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:08,400
Yeah.

196
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,489
- <i>What are you doing in there?</i>
- Who is this?

197
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,006
<i>This is Detective Sergeant
Eugene Moretti, asshole!</i>

198
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:15,786
<i>We got you completely by the balls.</i>

199
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,330
<i>You don't believe me?
I'm looking you right in the eye.</i>

200
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,540
<i>Right now, I can see you.</i>

201
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:20,875
- Who is it?
- Cops.

202
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,440
You come to the front door...

203
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,292
Hang it up.

204
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,346
How'd that happen?

205
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,558
Did I do anything to hurt you?
Did I treat you badly?

206
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,811
Look, I'm on salary. I'm not going be a hero!

207
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,813
Did you have a plan or what?

208
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,855
What did you do?
Just barge in on a whim? Huh?

209
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,025
Why did you have to light a fire?

210
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,100
Look, I told you to get out of here
when you could,

211
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:32,530
but, no, you just had to hang around.

212
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,616
He don't have a plan.
It's all a whim. Rob a bank!

213
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,076
I had a plan. I had it planned!

214
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:40,162
Only the money was supposed
to be delivered, not taken away!

215
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:44,291
That fucking Jack, downtown, he gave
me the wrong information, that fuck!

216
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:48,045
What is this Jack supposed to be?
A mastermind or what?

217
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,008
We're all in the barrel together
and we want to get out of it.

218
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,765
Right, I got to have time to think now.
I got to think.

219
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,580
Oh, shit!

220
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,380
All right. Listen bastards!
You keep away from this bank

221
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:23,080
or we're going to start throwing bodies out
the front door, one at a time. You got that?

222
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,668
Who is this?

223
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,805
Is there a Jenny here?

224
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,349
Who's Jenny here?

225
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,851
That's me.

226
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,395
It's the squirrel. You got a husband?

227
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,064
Yeah? Well, he's on the phone.

228
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,399
Go ahead.

229
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,611
What could I tell him?

230
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,655
I don't know. Tell him whatever
you tell him. Tell him the truth.

231
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,992
What a fucking comedy!
WNEW plays all the hits.

232
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,744
<i>Listen. Now, don't hang up.</i>

233
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,830
- First off, is anybody hurt in there?
- <i>No, nobody's hurt.</i>

234
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,443
You keep away from this bank
or we're going to start throwing bodies

235
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,043
out the front door, one at a time.
You got that?

236
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,870
Listen. Don't do that now. Wait a minute.
Let me talk to you for a while, huh?

237
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,980
How many people you got in there?

238
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,256
<i>No, you call me back.</i>

239
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,974
- Call me back.
- Excuse me.

240
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,012
He said he wants to know
what time you'll be through.

241
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,766
What? Girlie, please!

242
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,410
- Where's the back door?
- It's locked on the inside.

243
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,954
Where is it?

244
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,331
Through the passageway to the right.

245
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:52,294
Sal! Cover them! Cover them!

246
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,714
You could just go ahead
and cook whatever's there.

247
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,040
Oh, yes, I will. Yes, I will.

248
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,460
- Let's go, come on.
- Honey, I got to go now.

249
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,713
I got to go.

250
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:38,466
I love you too.

251
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,594
All right. All right, inside there.

252
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:47,641
Sal, I don't know what happened.

253
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:51,353
Maybe somebody tripped an alarm
or something. I don't know.

254
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:54,255
But there's a way out of this.
I'm telling you, there's a way out of this.

255
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:56,775
- Were you serious about what you said?
- About what?

256
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,975
About throwing...

257
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,576
About throwing those bodies out the door?

258
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,082
- That's what I want him to think.
- I want to know what you think.

259
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,216
'Cause I'll tell you right now,
I'm ready to do it.

260
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,635
Right. Okay.

261
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,888
- I mean it. I mean it.
- I know.

262
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:29,100
All right.

263
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,186
Now listen, everybody.
I know we got a problem here, right?

264
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,189
But there's a way out of this thing.
I'm telling you, there's a way out.

265
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,025
Now, all you got to do
is cooperate with me.

266
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,653
Stay cooled out, and we're going
to get out of this thing, all right?

267
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,947
Nobody will get hurt,
if you listen to what I say.

268
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,326
First off, we'll do things a step at a time.
Now, you got to go to the bathroom, right?

269
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:48,953
Right, she's going to have a chance
to go to the bathroom.

270
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:51,770
Everybody who has to go to the bathroom
is going to go to the bathroom.

271
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:53,541
We're going to do things together, okay?

272
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,793
Now stay cool...
What's the matter with him?

273
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,588
He's got asthma.

274
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,465
Asthma?

275
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:14,065
Asthma! Shit!

276
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,690
I'll take care of that.

277
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,460
- You... What's your name?
- Mulvaney.

278
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,194
Mulvaney, come with me.

279
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,074
He's got asthma,
and they make him a guard?

280
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:27,174
They go to guard school.

281
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,743
To learn how to shoot?
He don't even have a gun.

282
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,038
They earn a $105 a week
to fold the flag in the morning,

283
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,791
straighten up...
I don't know what they learn.

284
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:40,254
All right. I want to block that door.
In case they try coming in, I can hear it.

285
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,755
Let's move this.

286
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:48,304
Wait a minute. Hold it, hold it!

287
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:51,849
Let's get rid of this.

288
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:58,647
You got kids?

289
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:01,775
I got two kids and I'd like to see them again.

290
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:04,653
Don't worry, you'll see them again.
Look, you're being very cooperative

291
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:07,865
with me. I got no complaints
against you, whatsoever.

292
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,493
Whatsoever. You got bank insurance?

293
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,788
You know I do. You seem
to know a lot about bank procedure.

294
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,625
I know a lot about a lot of things.

295
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:24,590
- I just want to get you out of here safe, right?
- Right.

296
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,010
What if I take you with me?

297
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,012
If you take anybody,

298
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,847
please take me.

299
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,099
They'll shoot you, you know?

300
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,559
The cops...

301
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,478
They don't give a fuck
about your bank insurance.

302
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,688
See what they did in Attica?

303
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,984
42 people they killed.
The innocent with the guilty.

304
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:46,700
Anyway.

305
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:50,805
I won't take you with me.

306
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:54,245
I'll take one of them girls,
a married one with some kids.

307
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:57,407
Cops don't like it in the papers
when they shoot a married woman,

308
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:58,557
especially if she's got with kids.

309
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,963
You're all right.

310
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,398
You won't fuck with me, will you?

311
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,955
There's the FBI.

312
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,377
How're you doing, Sheldon?

313
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,194
Why didn't you wait
and try to take them outside?

314
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,070
I made an error in judgment.

315
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:13,741
I thought the sons of bitches would be a lot
more remorseful at the sight of a police officer.

316
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,618
And you know something?

317
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,661
Nobody said "hostage" yet,
you understand?

318
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,125
We got a bank robbery around here.

319
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,464
How the hell did those press guys
get through the barrier?

320
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:38,057
We don't know what's all about yet.
We're setting up communications right now.

321
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:41,519
This is Ron Cummins from CBS.
Sir, can you tell me what the situation is?

322
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:46,982
We're setting up communications.
Our perpetrators are in the bank.

323
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,651
That's all I can say now, fellows.

324
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,195
When I get it, you'll get it. Okay? That's all.

325
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,032
Hey, what are you fellows doing
on the fire escape?

326
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,702
I said on the roof.
Now get up on the roof, will you?

327
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:49,712
- Did you get the phone company?
- Yeah, it's being set it up now.

328
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,882
This phone is going to be
a direct line into the bank.

329
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:02,141
- Mulvaney speaking.
- <i>Moretti here. Let me talk to him.</i>

330
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:06,062
Yeah.

331
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:09,022
- <i>This is Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti.</i>
- Yeah.

332
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:12,610
Okay. You're in there, we're out here.
What do we do now?

333
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:15,070
- I don't know. What do we do?
- <i>Listen...</i>

334
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,448
First off, we want to know
if the people of the bank are okay.

335
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:19,033
They're okay.

336
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,870
- <i>You alone or you got confederates?</i>
- I'm not alone.

337
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:25,995
- I got Sal.
- <i>Sal?</i>

338
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,083
- What's that for, Salvatore?
- <i>Yeah. Sal.</i>

339
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,127
He's a killer.

340
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,547
We're Vietnam veterans. So killing
don't mean anything to us. You understand?

341
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,466
- <i>In the army?</i>
- In the army, yeah.

342
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,468
Okay. So you, what's your name?

343
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,179
Why? What do you want to know my name for?

344
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:42,973
Give me a name, any name.
Just so I got something to call you.

345
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,777
Come on, let's be reasonable, okay?
Just give me your name. All right?

346
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:57,689
Call me Sonny.

347
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:58,689
- <i>Sonny.</i>
- Yeah.

348
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,825
Okay. Now listen, Sonny.

349
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,952
I want to see if the people
in the bank are okay.

350
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:04,653
- <i>Right.</i>
- Yeah.

351
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,373
Then what I want to do is work out
a way to get them out of there.

352
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,583
I want to come over there.
I'll come over there without a gun.

353
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:13,045
You can frisk me, so you can see you can trust me
so we can talk and find a way out of this mess.

354
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Right.

355
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:18,759
I just want to find some way
that I can trust you too, right?

356
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,512
I don't want to just thrust me body out on the
street where you could just shoot me, right?

357
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,140
- <i>Some sign, right?</i>
- Right. Like what?

358
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,183
How about let the people out of the bank?

359
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,046
Come on, now. Hey, wait a minute.

360
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,146
Who do you think you're dealing with?
A fucking idiot here?

361
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,606
They're keeping me alive.
I'm going to let them out?

362
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,752
Why don't you talk to me?
Just talk to me straight.

363
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,152
- I'm ready to talk.
- <i>Okay. Okay.</i> Okay.

364
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:38,571
How about you give us the women?

365
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:41,240
No, I've got women.
That's all I've got here.

366
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,826
Okay. Well, give me something.
Give me one of them, anyway.

367
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,370
- What do you want one for?
- <i>Well, it's like a fair exchange.</i>

368
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,483
I'm going to come over there.
I'm not going to be packing nothing.

369
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,183
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

370
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,683
I don't know if you're going
to keep me as a hostage.

371
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,084
It's a sign of trust, right?

372
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,504
How do I reach you?
How the hell do I call you back?

373
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:55,604
<i>We got a direct line here.</i>

374
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,715
You just pick up the receiver,
and I'm here. Okay?

375
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,343
He wants one.

376
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,307
Him, right?

377
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:07,766
Right!

378
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:09,950
- Right?
- Right.

379
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
- Okay?
- Okay.

380
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,396
He goes.

381
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,153
What are we dealing with here?

382
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:23,616
You have to keep checking me out
all the time?

383
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,367
Yeah.

384
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,208
He'll need the keys.

385
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,043
You got the keys?

386
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,946
- Just the one, Sonny!
- Right.

387
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:54,863
Hey! Don't fire! Don't fire!

388
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,190
- What are you doing?
- Get away from him!

389
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,484
- That's a hostage!
- Don't fire, damn it!

390
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,304
- Hold your fire!
- Don't fire!

391
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,071
<i>Don't fire! Don't fire! Hold your fire!</i>

392
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:03,447
Hold your fire!

393
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,616
We voted to send him out!

394
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,107
- He's one of the hostages!
- Get away from him!

395
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,237
What's the matter with you?

396
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,956
He's a hostage!

397
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,516
He's one of the hostages!

398
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,584
Get away from him!
What the hell's the matter with you?

399
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:19,080
I don't give a fuck, goddamn it!
Get away! Get out of here!

400
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,600
Come on! Get away!

401
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:22,508
Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute, Sonny!

402
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,177
Sonny, that was your fault, Sonny.

403
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,847
You know we had the communications
set up here.

404
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:31,183
We haven't set it up properly.
We have 250 cops here.

405
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,018
We don't know what the fuck
is going on in there.

406
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:36,397
- You almost killed him! Are you crazy?
- That was smart!

407
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:40,202
You told me you got nothing but women,
and you throw out a guy.

408
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:41,402
What the fuck's going on in there?

409
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,529
You wanted a hostage,
I brought one out for you.

410
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,866
- Are you going to deal with us or not?
- I told you I'd give you one, I gave you one, right?

411
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,570
You did, but you should have
picked up the phone!

412
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,470
Come on out, Sonny. Look!

413
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,773
I ain't packing nothing, see?

414
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,073
I ain't packing nothing.

415
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:58,969
You can come out and frisk me.
You can tell. Huh?

416
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,257
- So, what do you want me to come out for?
- I want you to take a look at something. Come on.

417
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:07,344
- I want you to see what you're up against.
- I can see. Why do I got to come out for?

418
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,400
I want you to come out and see it all. All right?

419
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:10,430
Come on.

420
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
All right?

421
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,000
I got Sal in there with the other people.

422
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,147
Anything happens to me, they're
going to get it. You understand me?

423
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,983
I don't forget about Sal. I want you
to come out and take a look. Okay?

424
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:24,103
Come on. Okay?

425
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,365
- I got to check with him first.
- All right. You don't need that artillery.

426
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:38,334
Sonny. 5 minutes. You tell him that.

427
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,294
Take it easy.

428
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,172
All right. He's coming. Get them back.
He's got a white flag.

429
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:45,257
All right. Okay. Everything's all right.

430
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,257
Come on. Right. Yeah. Okay.

431
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,638
Come on out, Sonny.

432
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:52,389
He's too close here.

433
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:55,000
Come on! Get back!
What the fuck are you doing? Get back!

434
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,742
- Get them back.
- Get back! Okay?

435
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,563
Come on out.

436
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,915
Take a look at this. Come on.

437
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,360
Here, look! Look up here. Look.

438
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:08,914
Look over here. Huh?

439
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:17,039
Over there, right?
We got everything here, okay?

440
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,517
You got the militia out here, huh?

441
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,903
Let Sal come out and take look, all right?
What hope have you got, huh?

442
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,198
Come on. Quit while you're ahead.

443
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,868
- All you've got is attempted robbery.
- Armed robbery.

444
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,495
All right, armed, then!
But nobody's been hurt.

445
00:33:56,787 --> 00:34:00,708
Release the hostages. Nobody's going
to worry over kidnapping charges.

446
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,661
The most you're going to get is 5 years.
You'll get out in 1 year, huh?

447
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,197
- Kiss me. Yeah.
- What?

448
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,297
Kiss me.

449
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,467
- When I'm being fucked, I like to get kissed a lot.
- Hey, come on. Come on. Come on.

450
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,595
You're a city cop, right?
Robbing a bank is a federal offense.

451
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:16,390
They got me on kidnapping, armed robbery.
They're going to bury me, man.

452
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,802
I don't want to talk to somebody who's trying
to con me. Get somebody in charge here.

453
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,702
I am in charge here.

454
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:23,106
I don't want to talk to some flunky pig
trying to con me, man.

455
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:24,106
- You're not to call me pig.
- What's he doing?

456
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,150
- Will you get back over there?
- What are they moving in there for?

457
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:28,819
Will you get the fuck back there?!
Get back there, will you?!

458
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:30,529
Come on! Get over there!

459
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,455
- Go on back there, man!
- Get over there, will you?!

460
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:35,284
He wants to kill me so bad, he can taste it!

461
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,553
- Okay, nobody's going to kill anybody.
- Attica!

462
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:54,000
Attica!

463
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,304
Remember Attica!

464
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,562
Your word don't fucking matter!

465
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:07,223
No, no, no! Come on! Come on!
Calm down, will you? Calm down.

466
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,278
Put your guns down!

467
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,378
Put your guns down!

468
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,574
- If it wasn't for the TV guys, they'd kill us all!
- Come on! Will you get back?

469
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,504
Put your fucking guns down!

470
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,204
Tell them to put their guns down!

471
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:22,204
All right! Will you get back?!

472
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:24,003
Put those guns down! Get back!

473
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:26,004
Put your fucking guns down!

474
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,253
Put those guns down!

475
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,465
Put them down! Put them down!

476
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:34,553
Put those fucking guns down!

477
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:37,000
Put those guns down!

478
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:43,292
Attica!

479
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:58,339
You got it, man!

480
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:13,039
You got it!

481
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>...headquarters in Washington...</i>

482
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,051
- Robbing a bank?
- <i>...has produced the information...</i>

483
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:19,001
<i>...as to the identity of one of the men in the bank.</i>

484
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:22,683
- Why didn't he tell me he needed money?
- <i>As to previous pubic record, he served in Vietnam.</i>

485
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:27,354
- He should have come to me if he needed money.
- <i>His name is Sonny Wortzik, it look like here.</i>

486
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:29,554
- I couldn't believe it.
- <i>So far...</i>

487
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:34,528
<i>...we know that 8 people
are still being held in the bank.</i>

488
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,866
<i>The situation inside the bank
is totally unknown to us other than...</i>

489
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:42,912
<i>...descriptions that have been
obtained from Howard Calvin.</i>

490
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:45,289
- Why rob a bank when you got a sucker for a mother?
- <i>He reports...</i>

491
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,460
<i>We'll switch you now to Ron Cummons
at the bank in Brooklyn.</i>

492
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:52,213
<i>Miss Benson, what's it like inside?</i>

493
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,673
- They're holding up. What can you say?
- Just keep it cool.

494
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:56,517
- The guy in there,
- Got a deal?

495
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:59,386
who's got a gun on them, is the quiet type.

496
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,722
Is there enough confidence
in Detective Moretti?

497
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,726
Well, they don't know Detective Moretti yet.
I got to go now.

498
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,604
What's this with the hands?

499
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,901
She's out, let her stay out.
Come on, stay out.

500
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,734
They're my girls. I'm going back in there.

501
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,331
- Howard. How is he?
- Howard's all right.

502
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,208
Put the TV on.

503
00:37:29,258 --> 00:37:31,427
Girls, I was interviewed!

504
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,921
Sal, it looks good.

505
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,962
They got everybody out there.
They got the whole media.

506
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,302
Television people.

507
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:39,343
- What?
- Television people.

508
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:41,554
They want to talk to you. They're out there.

509
00:37:48,612 --> 00:37:49,773
Yeah?

510
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:52,523
<i>Hello, Sonny. Sonny, you're on the air.</i>

511
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,151
<i>Would you mind answering
a few questions for us?</i>

512
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,302
Yeah.

513
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,362
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

514
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:03,984
- <i>Hello?</i>
- See?

515
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:05,995
No, I just saw myself there. What?

516
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:07,872
- Why am I doing it?
- <i>Yes.</i>

517
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:10,833
- Doing what?
- <i>Robbing a bank.</i>

518
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh!

519
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:18,132
What? I don't know what you mean by that.

520
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:21,093
I'm robbing a bank, 'cause they got
money here. That's why I'm robbing it.

521
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:24,388
<i>No, no. What I mean is, why do you
feel you have to steal for money?</i>

522
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,056
<i>Couldn't you get a job?</i>

523
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:29,935
No. Doing what?

524
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:35,107
You know, if you want a job,
you got to be a member of a union.

525
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:38,277
See, if you got no union card,
you don't get a job.

526
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,321
<i>What about non-union ocupations?</i>

527
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:45,034
What's wrong with this guy?

528
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:48,120
What do you mean non-union?
Like what, a bank teller?

529
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,000
You know how much a bank teller
makes a week?

530
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:53,000
- Not much.
- Not much. $115 to start, right?

531
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,877
You're going to live on that?

532
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:58,000
I got a wife and a couple of kids.
How am I going to live on that?

533
00:38:58,727 --> 00:38:59,581
What do you make a week?

534
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:03,052
- <i>I'm here to talk to you, Sonny.</i>
- Well, I'm talking to you.

535
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:06,680
We're entertainment, right?
What do you got for us?

536
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,933
<i>What do you want to get for it?</i>

537
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,487
<i>Do you expect to be paid, because--?</i>

538
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:13,187
No, I don't want to be paid.
I don't need to be paid. Look...

539
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:17,650
I'm here with my partner and 9 other people.
See, we're dying, man. You know?

540
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:20,945
You're going to see our brains on the sidewalk.
They're going to spill our guts out.

541
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,780
Now, you're going to show that on television?

542
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:26,042
Have all the housewives look at that?
Instead of "As The World Turns"?

543
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,551
I mean what do you got for me?
I want something for that.

544
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,711
- <i>Sonny.</i>
- Yeah.

545
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:32,331
- <i>You could give up.</i>
- Give up?

546
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:34,750
- Right. You ever been in prison?
- <i>No.</i>

547
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,383
No! Well, let's talk about something
you fucking know about, okay?

548
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,400
How much you make a week?

549
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,500
- That's what I want to hear.
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

550
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,500
- You're going to talk to me about that?
- <i>...our transmission has been temporarily interrupted.</i>

551
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,137
<i>Please stand by. We will return
to our special news cast very soon.</i>

552
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,639
Hey, hello?
What the fuck happened?

553
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,239
Hey!

554
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,269
Guess he didn't appreciate
your use of language.

555
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,689
Fuck him!

556
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Sal.

557
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Sal!

558
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:27,178
I don't know, they might deal with us.

559
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,640
You know. I mean I don't know
about that guy out there.

560
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:36,479
But if I get the FBI involved in this,
you know, they might deal.

561
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:38,230
What do you think?

562
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
No.

563
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
- Sal.
- No!

564
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,535
What's the matter with you?

565
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:54,901
You made a promise, didn't you?
Did you promise me something, huh?

566
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:55,881
Yeah.

567
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:59,476
Did you say either we get away clean,
or we kill ourselves? Did you say that?

568
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:00,800
- I'm not talking about--
- Did you?

569
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,200
- I'm not talking about that.
- Did you not?

570
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,408
- I do believe--
- Do you believe in keeping your promises?

571
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,608
- Yeah, but I'm not--
- Does it still go?

572
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:08,093
- Yes, it still goes.
- Then what the fuck are you talking about?

573
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,393
I'm trying to...

574
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,058
I ain't going back to that prison, Sonny.

575
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,982
- Yeah.
- <i>Kill them all now.</i>

576
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:25,236
- <i>Take your bayonet and jam it into their--</i>
- Fuck you! Fuck!

577
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:06,068
We ask for a jet. What do you think?

578
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:14,368
We get a helicopter.

579
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:18,122
We get a helicopter here,
it lands on the roof,

580
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:23,252
and takes us to a jet,
and we fly the fuck out of the country.

581
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,350
Sal...

582
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:29,884
Sal, we can do it.

583
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,750
Sal, Sal.

584
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,893
Look. We got them.
We don't even know it, you know.

585
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:41,178
We've got the hostages.

586
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:44,374
You know, we've been looking
at this the wrong way.

587
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:45,874
We make the demands!

588
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:47,885
They're going to give us anything we want.

589
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:57,553
I'm flying to the tropics. Fuck the snow!

590
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,169
Hey, where is the mouth?

591
00:43:06,504 --> 00:43:10,841
- You ready to go to Algeria?
- Algeria? Yeah, sure!

592
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,469
We're all going to sunny climes!

593
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:16,222
Sal, I can make it happen!
I can make it happen!

594
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,757
I've made it happen so far, right?

595
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,351
I can make it happen.

596
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:28,535
Yeah.

597
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:29,735
Give me Moretti.

598
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Sarge!

599
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,316
All of you, go ahead, make phone calls.
Call home or whatever.

600
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,118
We're all going on a trip.

601
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:40,621
- <i>Yeah, Sonny.</i>
- Yeah. I want to talk to you.

602
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,958
- <i>I'm coming out.</i>
- Good, good. Okay. We'll be there.

603
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,960
Let's go. Come on. He's coming out.

604
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Sal.

605
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:50,548
Now. You got to understand something.

606
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:53,968
If we leave the country,
there's no coming back here.

607
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:56,654
You know what I mean?
There's no coming back.

608
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:59,056
So if there's anybody now
that you want to talk to,

609
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:02,351
you want to say goodbye to,
do it now.

610
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,190
No.

611
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:13,487
Is there any special country
you want to go to?

612
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,783
Wyoming.

613
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:22,830
No, Wyoming... That's not a country.

614
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,375
That's all right. I'm going to take care of it.

615
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,500
<b>Yeah!</b>

616
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,734
All right. Put them down! Yeah?

617
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,907
Put them down! You hear that?
What do I have?

618
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,660
See this here? Look!
I got nothing up my sleeve!

619
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:05,789
I got nothing here either! All right?
You want to see my pockets? Here!

620
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,791
You need that gun, right!

621
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:13,589
Right Moretti?
Tell them to put their guns down!

622
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:16,767
Hey, you! See that?
Put it in your holster!

623
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:23,182
Put the guns down!

624
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,979
You know what it means
to put a gun down? What's this?

625
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,000
What's this?

626
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:36,000
Right! Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!

627
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:38,739
You got it, right?

628
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:42,076
You got it, baby! Hey, Moretti!

629
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,078
You made it happen!

630
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:51,544
You got Maria in there!

631
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,000
Maria!

632
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,510
He's got a gun in there!

633
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Maria!

634
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Maria! Maria!

635
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,427
Get him the fuck out of here! Jesus.

636
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,855
How the hell did that happen?

637
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:12,315
- Hey, Sonny!
- I got Sal in there!

638
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:14,650
All right. Take it easy! Take it easy!
Notify the precinct. All right?

639
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,485
Who the fuck is that?

640
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:19,029
It is one of the Spanish kids.

641
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,898
- Who's Maria?
- You got her inside.

642
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,951
Sal wants to see Sonny!
He says he'll shoot unless he sees Sonny!

643
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:26,812
- Sal!
- He's serious! Sonny, he means it!

644
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,312
- Sal!
- He means it!

645
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,291
It's all right. It's all right.

646
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,120
It's all right.

647
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:37,465
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- How'd that happen?

648
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:40,292
You got his girlfriend in there.
You know the Spanish. Are you okay?

649
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,219
That fuck tried to kill me.

650
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,639
- You look all squeezed out.
- Squeezed out. I'm squeezed out!

651
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,434
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Let me see.
Let me see your head, all right?

652
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:50,978
- I'm bleeding!
- Let me see it.

653
00:46:51,024 --> 00:46:52,178
Let me see.

654
00:46:53,024 --> 00:46:56,578
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, yeah.

655
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,405
It's all right. You want to talk
to me about something?

656
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:04,074
Should've heard that phone call in there.

657
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:06,744
Calls up some creep, says, "Kill everybody".

658
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:08,579
Everyboydy wants to kill everybody.

659
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:13,042
I think you're going to get
assholes like that any how, right?

660
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,715
Yeah, I want to talk to you. I got an offer.

661
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,593
I want a helicopter out of here.

662
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:27,389
And a jet to go wherever I want to go.

663
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,892
So I don't want a little jet, I want a big one.

664
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:33,700
One with a bar, a piano lounge, 'cause maybe
I want to go out of the country, you know.

665
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:37,483
I don't know Sonny. I don't know whether
a helicopter would fit in here or not. You know?

666
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:39,984
- I'll check it.
- It could land on the roof.

667
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:43,592
No, no, no. That's asphalt, you know what'll
happen there, you know, it'll break through.

668
00:47:43,842 --> 00:47:46,637
Look, I'll call my superiors, you understand?

669
00:47:46,887 --> 00:47:49,972
Why not bring your superiors here?
Let me talk to them.

670
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,217
Why am I talking to you for,
if you got to call superiors?

671
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:55,896
- We don't always see eye-to-eye.
- Yeah, so I'll talk to them.

672
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,981
All right. Let me call them
and see what they'll say.

673
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:01,118
I'll talk to them and I ask them, all right?
Then we'll see.

674
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:02,861
Anything else I can get you?

675
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,284
Yeah, I want you to bring my wife down here.

676
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:12,162
- Okay. What do you give us?
- What do you want?

677
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:14,456
The women hostages.

678
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,502
Oh, man, you know.
There's no talking to you!

679
00:48:19,044 --> 00:48:21,714
That's all I got in there.
I told you, there's women.

680
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:24,675
You're going to talk to me or what?

681
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,546
I give one hostage for each thing
you give me, see?

682
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:32,042
If you give me the helicopter,
then I give you a hostage.

683
00:48:32,096 --> 00:48:33,742
If you give me the jet,
then I give you a hostage.

684
00:48:33,892 --> 00:48:36,437
You give me my wife, I give you a hostage.

685
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:38,897
And then the rest come home on the jet.

686
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:43,110
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

687
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:46,447
In the meantime, you pick out
who you want to give us,

688
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:49,658
and you tell me where your wife is, all right?

689
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,121
I'm sitting here minding my own business,
I hear the transistor go "Sonny what?"

690
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:57,290
I can't believe my ears! I grab the kids!

691
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,402
I'm telling you right now, Sonny didn't do it!
It ain't him to rob a bank!

692
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:04,006
It ain't him to steal or hurt anybody
or threaten anybody or do nothing wrong!

693
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,967
'Cause he's never done nothing wrong
since the day I know him!

694
00:49:07,217 --> 00:49:10,065
Night before last, we're at Coney Island.

695
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,465
I'm looking in the glove compartement.
He's got a gun with bullets in it.

696
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:16,571
Things are adding up in my head
how crazy he's been acting lately

697
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:19,783
and in with a bad crowd.
So I look at him.

698
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:22,944
Go on, get in bed.
He's yelling at the kids like a madman.

699
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:26,447
And then he wants me to go on this kiddie
ride for the little kids. I don't want to go.

700
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:29,348
He starts screaming at me.
Shh, sweetheart. Shh, shh.

701
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:32,251
He's screaming and screaming
and screaming.

702
00:49:32,543 --> 00:49:35,496
It's in the car. I say to him, "Sonny,
what are you going to do with the gun?

703
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:37,422
"You're going to shoot me and
dump my body in the river? What?"

704
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:41,008
I mean, I was scared of him.
I've never been scared of him.

705
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:45,052
You know, his mother says we was always
fighting. The cops was always at our house.

706
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:48,680
Well, I hit him with a jack handle
once in the car.

707
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:51,183
Only I didn't even hit him. I hit myself.

708
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:54,185
You should've seen the bruise on my leg.
From here to here.

709
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:57,645
You know what he'd do? He'd put on
his hat and coat, he goes out the door.

710
00:49:59,856 --> 00:50:03,275
So they tell me he did it.
But I don't believe it.

711
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:06,999
Mrs. Wortzik, please, listen to me.
They want you down at the bank.

712
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:11,406
He might've done it, his body functions might
've done it, but he himself, he didn't do it!

713
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:23,499
"Dear Abby, lately I've been dreaming
about falling into water

714
00:50:23,749 --> 00:50:26,751
"and not being able to reach the surface.

715
00:50:27,293 --> 00:50:31,338
"I begin to breathe heavily
and I wake up in a cold sweat.

716
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,258
"A friend tells me that my problem
is one of sexual repression."

717
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:39,135
Margaret, are you all right?

718
00:50:56,717 --> 00:51:57,777
Yeah.

719
00:50:57,817 --> 00:51:01,277
<i>Are you doing anything
to any of those girls on there?</i>

720
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:03,320
He's back again.

721
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
<i>Well?</i>

722
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:10,034
<i>Who is this?</i>

723
00:51:11,577 --> 00:51:14,287
Sonny, look at Margaret.

724
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:19,124
What's the matter with her?

725
00:51:19,874 --> 00:51:21,876
There's no air in here.

726
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:28,548
What happened to the air conditioning?

727
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,512
I'm sorry, Syl.

728
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:40,140
Where's the air conditioning?

729
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,850
In the basement.

730
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:49,605
Sal, I'm going to check the air conditioning.

731
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:51,357
I'll be right back.

732
00:51:51,414 --> 00:51:52,457
Sonny.

733
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,800
What?

734
00:52:00,573 --> 00:52:03,408
I never been up in an airplane before.

735
00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:09,395
So? I mean...

736
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:13,498
It's safe. It's like a car.

737
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:15,500
It's safer than a car.

738
00:52:18,252 --> 00:52:20,004
It's all right, Sal.

739
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:27,999
- I'm going to go check it now.
- Okay.

740
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:53,803
- Sal!
- What?!

741
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:55,363
They're coming in the back!

742
00:52:55,614 --> 00:52:56,999
In the vault! Come on!

743
00:52:58,784 --> 00:52:59,744
Get in there! Move!

744
00:52:59,784 --> 00:53:01,994
- Back! Get back!
- No, no, no, no! Don't fire!

745
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,834
That's it, Sonny!

746
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,335
Get her in there!

747
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:17,923
Who fired that shot?

748
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:21,217
Pick her up and put her in.

749
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:24,386
Who fired the shot?

750
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:28,013
Come on! Move!

751
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,348
Okay, legs!

752
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,600
Sonny!

753
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,563
Hey, Sonny!

754
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:40,523
Get me a bullhorn!

755
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Sonny!

756
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,032
You got that bullhorn?

757
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,100
Hey, Sonny!

758
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:02,498
<i>Come on out, Sonny!</i>

759
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,498
Sonny!

760
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,458
<i>Sonny!</i>

761
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:07,752
Shit, that's all I need.

762
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Sonny!

763
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,700
<b>Sonny!</b>

764
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:14,632
Go take care of that, will you?

765
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:17,926
Sonny, come on out!

766
00:54:18,468 --> 00:54:20,521
Go straighten that out, will you, Carmine?

767
00:54:20,608 --> 00:54:21,721
Sonny!

768
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:23,597
<i>Sonny, come on out.</i>

769
00:54:25,508 --> 00:54:26,521
<i>Sonny?</i>

770
00:54:28,008 --> 00:54:29,021
<i>Sonny!</i>

771
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:34,300
Sonny!

772
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:37,692
You son of a bitch,
you want to get those people killed?

773
00:54:37,738 --> 00:54:39,021
<i>Come on out, Sonny.</i>

774
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:44,521
<i>Sonny, come on out.</i>

775
00:54:49,284 --> 00:54:50,744
<i>Come on out here, now.</i>

776
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:55,321
<i>Come on out, Sonny.</i>

777
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:56,551
<i>Sonny!</i>

778
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:02,117
<i>Sonny?</i>

779
00:55:04,882 --> 00:55:06,317
<i>Come on out here, Sonny.</i>

780
00:55:09,382 --> 00:55:12,217
All right, I see you, Sonny. Come on! Come on!

781
00:55:12,382 --> 00:55:13,417
All right, get back.

782
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,190
What the fuck is the matter with you?

783
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:33,267
- What?
- Why'd you fire that shot in there for?

784
00:55:33,317 --> 00:55:35,361
- What were they doing back there?
- We got 250 cops here, for Christ's sake!

785
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:37,820
- Fuck you! What were they doing back there?
- What goes in there?

786
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,765
What the hell's the matter with you? Huh?

787
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:42,532
- What's the matter--?
- Are we dealing or aren't we?

788
00:55:42,783 --> 00:55:44,785
- They were trying to get in there, right?
- Who?

789
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:46,369
Come on, don't give me that shit.
You know who.

790
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:49,788
- What the fuck is going on here?
- You're full of shit!

791
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:51,873
Go around and find out
what's going on back there!

792
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:53,102
- Honest to God, Sonny,
- Oh, yeah?

793
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:54,792
- I don't know what the fuck is going on here!
- Bullshit!

794
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,960
- Our communications aren't set up yet.
- Bullshit!

795
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:59,462
- I just sent somebody back there. Goddamn it!
- You get someone to talk to me!

796
00:55:59,754 --> 00:56:01,630
Get somebody to talk to me.
I'm not talking to you anymore.

797
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:03,289
- Let me talk to you. Let me talk to you. All right?
- Yeah, you tell me one thing,

798
00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:04,499
- then you do another.
- Now wait a minute. Hold on a second.

799
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:05,883
What were they doing back there?!

800
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:07,261
I don't know what the fuck
they were doing back there!

801
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:08,427
Yeah, you don't know. You're full of shit!

802
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:10,512
That's another force back there.
A tactical force!

803
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:13,348
They like to shoot, they like to jump on ropes,
they like to climb in through windows!

804
00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:16,517
They like that, right! Without your orders,
right? Without your orders.

805
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:18,226
- No! Yes! Without my orders! Yes!
- Yes?

806
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:20,194
How do I know you're not going
to come through the roof?

807
00:56:20,228 --> 00:56:21,329
'Cause I'm telling you that we are not.

808
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,698
Yeah? You're telling me a lot of things,
but you're not doing them.

809
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:26,440
- Oh, goddamn it, when I told you--
- What were they doing back there?!

810
00:56:26,491 --> 00:56:28,010
- That's what I want to know!
- I don't know what they were doing back there!

811
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:29,510
- And you can't answer me!
- I'm out here!

812
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:30,610
- You can't answer me!
- What?

813
00:56:30,677 --> 00:56:32,320
- You can't answer me.
- Yes, I can answer you!

814
00:56:32,612 --> 00:56:34,656
- So tell me what they were doing there.
- They were setting communications up there.

815
00:56:34,947 --> 00:56:37,658
No communications! We got them set up.
I just sent somebody back there.

816
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,337
I got a guy in there who's going to kill somebody.
That's your responsibility. You understand?

817
00:56:41,787 --> 00:56:44,831
- Not mine, that's yours.
- Now wait a minute. Hold on a second. Listen.

818
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:46,131
We got everything you wanted.

819
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:47,331
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

820
00:56:47,415 --> 00:56:49,792
We can't get a helicopter in here,
but we got a bus is coming.

821
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,752
We got a jet coming into Kennedy, all right?

822
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,752
Okay? All right?

823
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:59,299
Now, we got ahold of your wife.

824
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:01,467
Your wife is coming.

825
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,927
We reached her,
and she's coming here, all right?

826
00:57:04,418 --> 00:57:05,427
Okay?

827
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,108
- Where are you going?
- I'm right here.

828
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,682
I'm right here, all right?
I thought we were going to talk.

829
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:12,142
I thought so, too, but we're not talking.

830
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:13,244
- I'm talking now, all right?
- We're trying to get in through the back door.

831
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:14,144
That's what we're doing.

832
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:15,687
We reached your wife.
She'll be here in about half an hour.

833
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:18,187
Okay? Okay?

834
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,065
What are they doing? They're still pointing.
They love to point.

835
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:22,692
Holster that weapon! Holster it!

836
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:24,693
Holster that weapon!

837
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:26,695
You too!

838
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,156
All right, come on.

839
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,658
- What do you want?
- What else do you want me to do, huh?

840
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,951
I don't know how could you do any better.

841
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,786
We got everything you wanted. Everything.

842
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,413
I'll do anything I can to stop
anything I can. All right?

843
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:43,333
Anything else?

844
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,168
- Yeah.
- What?

845
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:48,128
- I got some people in there that are hungry.
- Uh-huh. Okay?

846
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:50,671
- Can you get some food for them?
- No problem. What do you want?

847
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:53,591
- Want some pizzas? Pizzas?
- Yeah, all right.

848
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:54,791
Hey, Carmine!

849
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:57,635
Get some food here, some pizzas, all right?

850
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:00,220
Can we get some beer, you think?

851
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:03,139
No, no. No beer. No, no.
Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right?

852
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,139
Come on. All right? Carmine!

853
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,769
Some soft drinks too, okay? Cokes!

854
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,895
- What else?
- I need some aspirin too.

855
00:58:11,145 --> 00:58:12,647
- Some lady's not feeling well.
- Some arpirin, all right. Some aspirin!

856
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,522
You got it. Anything else?

857
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:16,900
Just don't fucking con me. That's it.

858
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:19,526
I'm not conning you. Why the hell
would I want to do that, for Christ's sake?

859
00:58:19,677 --> 00:58:23,613
I'm in trouble enough as it is.
I'm not trying to create any trouble.

860
00:58:23,877 --> 00:58:25,113
All right?

861
00:58:33,037 --> 00:58:34,288
It's okay.

862
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:41,820
They can't bring a helicopter in here, Sal.

863
00:58:41,877 --> 00:58:43,461
'Cause they can't land it here.

864
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:47,048
But they're going to get us a limousine bus,
a big bus, so that we can all get in.

865
00:58:47,298 --> 00:58:49,257
And that's how we get to the airport.

866
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:52,134
It's good. It looks good.

867
00:58:55,438 --> 00:58:58,056
You people, I just ordered you some food. So...

868
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:01,308
I even got her some aspirins.

869
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:03,519
Okay? So we're moving it along now.

870
00:59:03,894 --> 00:59:07,188
I got to pay for the food.
Where's the marked fives?

871
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,107
That was a foolish thing you did back there.

872
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:13,734
Foolish thing.

873
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:19,239
We're going to get the ball rolling?

874
00:59:19,864 --> 00:59:22,032
Yeah, we're going to get the ball rolling.
What do you think I'm doing?

875
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:24,368
I'm working on it, right? What's it look like?

876
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,995
You think it's easy?
You know, I got to keep them cooled out.

877
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:28,997
I got to keep all you people happy.

878
00:59:29,246 --> 00:59:31,456
I got to have the ideas
and got to do it all alone.

879
00:59:31,707 --> 00:59:33,416
I'm working on it. You want to try it?

880
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:36,294
<i>Your food is here, Sonny.</i>

881
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:39,838
You're starting to get on my nerves.

882
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:52,723
You just go on with him there.
You'll be all right. Go right ahead.

883
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:58,268
- What do I owe you for this?
- It's all paid for.

884
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:00,106
- It's all paid for?
- No, no, no. I've paid for that. It's all right.

885
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:01,646
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.

886
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:03,230
Here.

887
01:00:03,564 --> 01:00:04,815
Keep the change.

888
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
What?

889
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,988
- You want this?
- <b>Yeah.</b>

890
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:19,367
- You like it?
- <b>Yeah.</b>

891
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,668
Moretti, could you use five?

892
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:41,176
I got a lot for you.

893
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:55,002
Get back, goddamn it! Get back!

894
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:33,550
<b>More!</b>

895
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:25,710
Could you open it?

896
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:28,921
Thank you, man.

897
01:01:29,303 --> 01:01:30,601
See you later.

898
01:01:33,633 --> 01:01:35,884
I'm a fucking star!

899
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,741
Kick. Out. Turn.

900
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:07,241
No, just pick her up and hold her is all.
She'll be okay.

901
01:02:09,285 --> 01:02:11,077
You kick good. Here.

902
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,100
Kick. Out.

903
01:02:23,462 --> 01:02:25,255
This is where it gets stuck!

904
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:33,177
Miriam's making a fool of herself.

905
01:02:34,721 --> 01:02:37,931
- Anybody got a cigarette?
- Yeah, I do.

906
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:39,783
Sylvia, you don't smoke!

907
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:42,643
You don't smoke?

908
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,600
No.

909
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,315
Why do you want to start now?

910
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:52,484
- I'm scared to death, that's why.
- What? You don't smoke?

911
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:55,486
- No.
- How come?

912
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:02,867
- I don't want the cancer.
- Oh, my God!

913
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:04,201
Give me the cigarette.

914
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:06,578
Go ahead. Do what you want.

915
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:10,581
I just think you ought to take care
of your body, that's all.

916
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:12,625
My body? What for?

917
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,420
Your body is the temple of the Lord.

918
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,381
You're serious!

919
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,135
So you rob a bank,

920
01:03:27,385 --> 01:03:29,804
but you keep your body pure. Is that it?

921
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,644
You're going to smoke the cigarette or what?

922
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,271
Yes.

923
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:44,148
If I die of cancer, it'll be half your fault.

924
01:03:49,486 --> 01:03:51,528
No, it's because you're weak.

925
01:03:51,746 --> 01:03:53,697
Right, I'm weak.

926
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:57,158
Where's your bullets?

927
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:58,952
Mulvaney speaking.

928
01:04:01,787 --> 01:04:03,287
It's Moretti.

929
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,906
Yeah.

930
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,836
<i>Will you guys hold it down back there?</i>

931
01:04:10,885 --> 01:04:13,337
<i>Sonny, they're bringing in your wife.</i>

932
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,960
Step back. Step back.

933
01:04:30,183 --> 01:04:32,560
- Where's Moretti?
- Probably at the bar.

934
01:04:41,066 --> 01:04:42,609
In the barber shop.

935
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:46,612
What's that?

936
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:49,948
We went to Bellevue where you told us.

937
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:51,616
Said he was his wife.

938
01:04:51,908 --> 01:04:53,617
They were married in a church.

939
01:04:53,867 --> 01:04:55,327
Jesus Christ!

940
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,200
Leon!

941
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,000
Leon!

942
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:04,585
Hey, Leon, over here!

943
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,500
Leon! Hey, Leon!

944
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,500
Leon, over here!

945
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,500
Leon!

946
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:13,174
Happy birthday!

947
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,350
- Give us some room!
- His head! Watch his head!

948
01:05:30,104 --> 01:05:31,646
He's a queer?

949
01:05:32,047 --> 01:05:34,899
Hey, Sarge! Sarge, he wants you!

950
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:39,485
Come on! Get the goddamn shield
out of here. I don't need it now.

951
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:42,030
Where the fuck were you 4 hours ago,
when I needed it?

952
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,698
He's not going to shoot.
Yeah, Sonny, what? Yeah.

953
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,158
What happened? Is he all right?

954
01:05:47,408 --> 01:05:48,576
He's a little groggy right now, okay?

955
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:50,656
No, let me talk to him.

956
01:05:50,695 --> 01:05:53,205
Let me get him on his feet
and I'll call you back, all right? Okay.

957
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:54,206
Shut the fucking door!

958
01:05:57,208 --> 01:06:00,126
Stop the noise!
I don't want to hear a fucking sound!

959
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,461
Typewriter!

960
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:04,338
Get off the fucking phone!

961
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:05,964
Now!

962
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:08,216
Give me some water.

963
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,500
Leon?

964
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,500
Leon.

965
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:15,741
You all right, Leon?

966
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:18,641
What's the matter? They give you a shot
down at the hospital or something?

967
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,769
Oh, God! They shot me with, like, unreal!

968
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:24,853
Now you got to get ahold of yourself, Leon.

969
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,106
So you can talk to him,
and see if he'll come out of the bank.

970
01:06:30,149 --> 01:06:32,776
He's got 8 people in there. He's a kid in there
in the name of a Sal. Do you know him?

971
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:36,488
- No, not really.
- He says he's going to shoot these 8 people.

972
01:06:36,696 --> 01:06:40,282
I can't help it. I can't stop him from anything.

973
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,200
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?

974
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:45,285
I can't talk to him. He won't listen to anybody.

975
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:48,205
He's been crazy all summer.

976
01:06:49,497 --> 01:06:51,332
He's been trying to kill me since June.

977
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:56,169
He put a gun to my head.
And he cut me with a knife.

978
01:06:56,378 --> 01:06:59,380
- He beat up my friends.
- Did you try get in touch with the police?

979
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:02,173
What good would that do?

980
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:06,343
It'd just make him mad. They don't
know him. And it wouldn't stop him.

981
01:07:06,635 --> 01:07:07,713
Somebody's got to stop him.

982
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:11,013
- He's making threats in there.
- You don't understand. He's crazy.

983
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:16,601
He's got a wife, children.

984
01:07:17,936 --> 01:07:19,478
He's a wonderful father.

985
01:07:20,813 --> 01:07:21,772
His mother...

986
01:07:22,064 --> 01:07:26,317
You should see her. His mother and father
together are like a bad car wreck.

987
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:29,695
It just rolls off his back.

988
01:07:29,987 --> 01:07:33,030
He sees them, he pays the rent.
Unbelievable!

989
01:07:34,866 --> 01:07:38,994
I was the one who wanted to get married.
He didn't really want it, but...

990
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:41,954
...he did it. I don't know why.

991
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:44,497
Why did you want to get married, Leon?

992
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,711
I thought it would help me.

993
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:54,505
But it didn't.

994
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:58,258
I was so confused. I was doing...

995
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,967
...insane things.

996
01:08:01,051 --> 01:08:02,636
What sort of things, Leon?

997
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,016
After the wedding,

998
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:12,768
I ran off for 10 days to Atlantic City.

999
01:08:13,686 --> 01:08:15,605
Sonny was frantic.

1000
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:20,233
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't
know where I was, who I was with.

1001
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,486
I couldn't explain the things I did.

1002
01:08:24,737 --> 01:08:27,071
So I went to a psychiatrist,

1003
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:28,907
who told me

1004
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:33,576
that I was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

1005
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:45,002
Well, so right away, Sonny wanted to give
me money for the sex change operation.

1006
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,212
But where was he going to get it?

1007
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:49,047
$2,500?

1008
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,925
My God, he was in hock
up to his ears already.

1009
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:55,009
He needed the money
for the operation for you?

1010
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:57,220
It drove him crazy.

1011
01:08:58,428 --> 01:09:00,931
He would fly into these rages.

1012
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:04,016
And I got more depressed than ever.

1013
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:06,351
I knew I'd never get my operation.

1014
01:09:07,062 --> 01:09:13,482
So I tried to kill myself.
I took about a half a pound of pills.

1015
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,818
Blues, reds, yellows, screamers,
uppers, downers, you name it.

1016
01:09:18,736 --> 01:09:20,570
And I wound up in the hospital.

1017
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:24,907
And Sonny comes there,

1018
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,283
and he just looks at me.

1019
01:09:28,576 --> 01:09:30,245
And he says...

1020
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,454
"Why, Leon?

1021
01:09:32,788 --> 01:09:35,414
"When things were going so good?"

1022
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:43,503
Don't you think, Leon...

1023
01:09:44,296 --> 01:09:45,756
Don't you think he sort of did it for you?

1024
01:09:49,342 --> 01:09:51,344
Yeah, I guess so.

1025
01:09:52,928 --> 01:09:56,014
Don't you think you sort of owe it to him
to see if you can get him out of there?

1026
01:09:57,431 --> 01:09:59,559
I can't talk to him.

1027
01:10:01,643 --> 01:10:04,895
You're up to your neck in it, Leon.
You're an accessory.

1028
01:10:05,354 --> 01:10:08,000
- No, no. They can't hold me responsible.
- I wonder if you could help us.

1029
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,233
- A little understanding and you're out of here.
- No.

1030
01:10:10,608 --> 01:10:11,526
- Come on.
- I'm afraid.

1031
01:10:11,776 --> 01:10:13,000
- Just talk to him for a minute, all right?
- No, please.

1032
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,000
- Come on.
- I can't talk!

1033
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:16,000
- How's he going to hurt you on the phone?
- No.

1034
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,100
All you're going to be is on the phone.

1035
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:20,741
- I can't. I don't know what to...
- Just talk to him.

1036
01:10:20,992 --> 01:10:22,909
- Right over here. On the phone.
- I can't.

1037
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:31,916
You think about it now.

1038
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,100
Yeah.

1039
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:40,423
He doesn't want to talk to you.

1040
01:10:40,965 --> 01:10:42,924
What do you mean he won't talk to me? Why?

1041
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:44,843
Let me work on it.

1042
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:46,802
I thought that was what you were going to do.

1043
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:56,727
He don't want to talk to me.

1044
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:15,991
<i>Police are questioning Leon Schermer,
a 26-year-old admitted homosexual,</i>

1045
01:11:16,283 --> 01:11:20,811
<i>who claims to have been married to one of
the bank robbers in a ceremony last November.</i>

1046
01:11:21,162 --> 01:11:24,623
<i>According to our sources in the
barber shop where Leon is being held,</i>

1047
01:11:24,873 --> 01:11:26,416
<i>Leon has been reported as saying</i>

1048
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:30,002
<i>that they were married in an
official ceremony by a Father Burke.</i>

1049
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,339
<i>Leon 's story has been confirmed.</i>

1050

and 70 about other guests,</i>

1051
01:11:39,176 --> 01:11:41,594
<i>all members of the gay community
were present.</i>

1052
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:47,891
<i>We've been able to obtain
a still photograph of Leon in his gown.</i>

1053
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,810
<i>Leon has confirmed</i>

1054
01:11:51,101 --> 01:11:54,762
<i>that the gowns for himself
and his bridesmaids cost $700.</i>

1055
01:11:57,481 --> 01:12:00,700
<i>We have not been able to confirm the story
with the priest who performed the ceremony.</i>

1056
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,986
<i>However, we are told
that he was subsequently defrocked.</i>

1057
01:12:04,637 --> 01:12:09,615

1058
01:12:09,865 --> 01:12:12,000
<i>Some in full support of Sonny and his actions, </i>

1059
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,300
<i>others totally condemning the present events</i>

1060
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,900

1061
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,499
<i>quote, "A case of sheer
exhibitionism.", end quote.</i>

1062
01:12:23,459 --> 01:12:26,837
<i>Our coverage of the bank robbery where
2 homosexuals are holding hostages</i>

1063
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:29,964
- <i>for their demands of a helicopter, a jet...</i>
- Sonny.

1064
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:33,000
Sonny, they said on the TV,
"2 homosexuals in the bank."

1065
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,259
Right on TV. You hear what they said?

1066
01:12:34,425 --> 01:12:37,637
What difference does it make? It don't matter.
They're going to say anything they want.

1067
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:39,263
Let them say it.

1068
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,977
Well, I'm not a homosexual.

1069
01:12:48,687 --> 01:12:51,897
You tell them to get that right now.
That's going out on the TV.

1070
01:12:57,193 --> 01:13:01,738
Sal, what am I supposed to do, you know?
I can't control what they say on television.

1071
01:13:03,406 --> 01:13:06,784
What do you expect me to do? I mean
I'm doing everything I can, I can't do that.

1072
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,500
Look, Sal.

1073
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:17,584
Forget about it. It's just a freak show
to them, anyway. It don't matter.

1074
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:19,626
Whatever they say, it don't matter.

1075
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:27,175
It'll be all right.

1076
01:13:36,431 --> 01:13:37,932
What's the matter with you?

1077
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:42,644
You shouldn't let something like that
spoil your fun, you know.

1078
01:13:43,061 --> 01:13:44,979
You've got to get fun out of life.

1079
01:13:52,152 --> 01:13:54,028
Where's the goddamn jet?

1080
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:57,864
They're always screaming overhead,
going somewhere,

1081
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,241
when you don't need them, you know?

1082
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:28,262
What are you going to do? What are you going
to tell the pilot when you get on the plane?

1083
01:14:31,782 --> 01:14:33,683
Did you know that Holland's pretty good.

1084
01:14:33,934 --> 01:14:37,478
- Holland?
- Yeah. They sheltered people during the war.

1085
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,813
They're good people.

1086
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,523
Where's Holland?

1087
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:43,440
It's right up...

1088
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:44,942
It's right over there!

1089
01:14:53,658 --> 01:14:56,283
Get in the vault. Get in the vault. Come on!

1090
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,576
Quickly!

1091
01:15:09,961 --> 01:15:12,546
They're waiting for us
to do something, I think.

1092
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,100
<i>Sonny.</i>

1093
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:20,677
<i>Come on out for a second, please.</i>

1094
01:15:20,969 --> 01:15:21,928
It's him. It's him, Sonny.

1095
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,680
Come on out here.
I want to talk to you a second.

1096
01:15:27,433 --> 01:15:28,950
- Come on, Sonny!
- <i>Sonny.</i>

1097
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Sonny.

1098
01:15:39,608 --> 01:15:41,192
Come on out, Sonny.

1099
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,100
Sonny?

1100
01:15:48,532 --> 01:15:50,074
Come on out a minute.

1101
01:15:51,534 --> 01:15:52,660
That's it, Sonny.

1102
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,800
Moretti!

1103
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,468
What the fuck is going on?
Get the lights back on!

1104
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,000
Moretti!

1105
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:18,138
Who are you?

1106
01:16:19,722 --> 01:16:21,515
FBI, Sheldon.

1107
01:16:24,184 --> 01:16:25,643
Oh, good.

1108
01:16:25,894 --> 01:16:28,479
About time. Maybe we can
get this thing started, huh?

1109
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:31,189
Look, get the lights back on

1110
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:34,484
and the air conditioning.
We got no air conditioning in here.

1111
01:16:34,692 --> 01:16:36,985
No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.

1112
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:38,278
Favors?

1113
01:16:38,612 --> 01:16:40,905
You been doing me favors all night?

1114
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:44,240
I have a jet, I'll have a limousine here
in half an hour.

1115
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,485
I want the hostages.

1116
01:16:50,496 --> 01:16:51,954
No, no, no. Bullshit.

1117
01:16:52,789 --> 01:16:55,249
I'd like to work with you on this,
Sonny, not against you.

1118
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,709
Yeah, well, the hostages are
what's keeping me alive.

1119
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,170
When do I get them?

1120
01:17:02,963 --> 01:17:04,506
Didn't anybody tell you anything?

1121
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:08,342
I'd like to hear it from you.

1122
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,597
You get one hostage for the
limousine that you bring me in.

1123
01:17:15,348 --> 01:17:18,225
One hostage for the jet.

1124
01:17:18,809 --> 01:17:22,103
Then I get to the airport,
I go into the plane, check it all out,

1125
01:17:22,395 --> 01:17:24,896
and if it's okay, then they all come out.

1126
01:17:27,107 --> 01:17:29,358
- I want to go inside.
- Why?

1127
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:31,318
See if everybody's all right.

1128
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,944
They're all right.

1129
01:17:33,486 --> 01:17:34,821
No, I have to see.

1130
01:17:43,953 --> 01:17:45,412
You got guts.

1131
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:48,915
What you think of me and Sal slit
their throats, we're going to let you out?

1132
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:50,916
I have to see.

1133
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:04,510
I got to check with my partner.

1134
01:18:11,974 --> 01:18:14,475
The FBI, Sal. It's coming in.

1135
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:31,031
You'd like to kill me, huh?

1136
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,448
I bet you would.

1137
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,074
I wouldn't like to kill you.

1138
01:18:34,324 --> 01:18:35,950
I will if I have to.

1139
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,952
It's your job, right?

1140
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:40,912
You know, the guy who kills me,

1141
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:45,332
I hope he does it because he hates
my guts, not 'cause it's his job.

1142
01:18:46,404 --> 01:18:48,000
All right. You can get in.

1143
01:18:52,004 --> 01:18:55,090
Okay. Nobody give your right name.
It's the FBI.

1144
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:10,193
I just want to make sure all you
young ladies are all all right in here.

1145
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:11,393
Look.

1146
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:15,022
They asked for the jet hours ago.
Now, what are you doing out there?

1147
01:19:15,272 --> 01:19:18,441
That's being set up. We'll have you
out of here in a couple of hours.

1148
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:21,860
- A couple of hours?
- Why don't you just give them what they want?

1149
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:24,988
They'll get what they want. We want
to make sure we get what we want.

1150
01:19:25,237 --> 01:19:28,074
Let's get you all out of here safe.

1151
01:19:29,783 --> 01:19:31,076
You two boys too.

1152
01:19:31,409 --> 01:19:32,744
That's close enough.

1153
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:39,749
Tell the TV to stop saying
there's 2 homosexuals in here.

1154
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:42,084
I will, Sal.

1155
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:46,629
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

1156
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:13,608
You handled yourself real well, Sonny.

1157
01:20:14,067 --> 01:20:15,512
A lot of men would have choked.

1158
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:18,112
We might have had a death or
a multiple death on our hands.

1159
01:20:18,362 --> 01:20:20,822
But you handled it. I respect that.

1160
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:24,574
Don't you try to take Sal. We'll handle him.

1161
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:27,493
You just sit tight and you won't get hurt.

1162
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,453
Wiat a minute. Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

1163
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:32,831
You just sit quiet.

1164
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:35,583
We'll handle Sal.

1165
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:42,213
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?!

1166
01:20:59,226 --> 01:21:00,560
What'd he say?

1167
01:21:03,104 --> 01:21:05,230
He was just talking to me
about the arrangements.

1168
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:08,317
I talked to him about the TV, Sal.
It's going to be all right.

1169
01:21:09,191 --> 01:21:10,192
That's all?

1170
01:21:10,551 --> 01:21:11,592
Yeah.

1171
01:21:13,737 --> 01:21:15,280
Why couldn't he say that in here?

1172
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:21,868
I don't know. He wanted to show me, you know,
how it's going to come in, how the bus is coming in.

1173
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:33,793
What's the matter?

1174
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,130
Somebody get a glass of water.

1175
01:21:39,423 --> 01:21:40,424
Got a hankie over there?

1176
01:21:42,383 --> 01:21:43,509
They poisoned the pizza.

1177
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,261
It's not the pizza!

1178
01:21:45,311 --> 01:21:47,179
He's got diabetes.

1179
01:21:48,347 --> 01:21:52,016
He had some Coke before.
Don't give him anything. I'll hold it for you.

1180
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:55,810
What can we do for you,
Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us.

1181
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:02,775
Is there a doctor out here?

1182
01:22:05,902 --> 01:22:07,986
We need a doctor in here.

1183
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:12,406
We need a doctor.

1184
01:22:14,533 --> 01:22:15,242
What's wrong?

1185
01:22:15,492 --> 01:22:18,536
The manager, he's a diabetic.
He don't look good.

1186
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,500
All right. Come on.

1187
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,756
I got to search you.

1188
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,600
Okay.

1189
01:22:52,312 --> 01:22:53,479
Just him.

1190
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Sonny.

1191
01:22:57,774 --> 01:23:01,568
I've convinced Leon to talk to you.
He's on the phone now.

1192
01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:16,664
He's coming on.

1193
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,500
Hello?

1194
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,300
<i>Hello?</i>

1195
01:23:29,424 --> 01:23:30,841
<i>Hello, Leon?</i>

1196
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:33,802
Hello. Hello, Sonny.

1197
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,678
What happened?

1198
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:38,055
How are you doing?

1199
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:41,141
Well, I'm out of the hospital.

1200
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:45,144
Yeah, I know. You know,
I thought you'd never get out.

1201
01:23:46,228 --> 01:23:49,314
I never thought I'd get out this way, I'll tell you.

1202
01:23:49,378 --> 01:23:50,394
Yeah.

1203
01:23:51,523 --> 01:23:53,191
So how're you doing?

1204
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:57,569
- <i>I'm a little shaky.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

1205
01:23:57,653 --> 01:24:01,072
Moretti told me, you know,
that you were all drugged up,

1206
01:24:02,073 --> 01:24:04,000
so I figured that's why you didn't
want to talk to me, you know.

1207
01:24:04,053 --> 01:24:06,619
'Cause I was wondering
why you didn't talk to me.

1208
01:24:06,869 --> 01:24:08,620
It was really terrible, you know?

1209
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:12,164
I mean, you walk in, and right away
they say you're crazy.

1210
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,875
And then they start sticking
things in your arm. I mean...

1211
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:19,878
How do they expect you to get uncrazy,
if you're asleep all the time?

1212
01:24:21,421 --> 01:24:23,923
I'm just starting to come out of it now.

1213
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,110
- So?
- <i>Well!</i>

1214
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:29,010
<i>So, how are you?</i>

1215
01:24:29,302 --> 01:24:30,678
I'm fine.

1216
01:24:32,846 --> 01:24:34,556
This is something, huh?

1217
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1218
01:24:41,269 --> 01:24:46,000
I don't know, Leon, you know.
I'm dying here. I'm dying.

1219
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,569
Don't you ever listen to yourself
when you say that? That you're dying?

1220
01:24:51,861 --> 01:24:54,988
- <i>Huh? Did you ever listen to yourself?</i>
- What? What are you talking about?

1221
01:24:55,038 --> 01:24:58,699
What do you mean, what am I
talking about? "You're dying."

1222
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:01,493
Do you know that you say that
to me every day of your life?

1223
01:25:02,036 --> 01:25:05,755
"I'm dying." You're not dying. You're killing
the people around you is what you're doing.

1224
01:25:05,806 --> 01:25:09,667
Come on, Leon. Don't give me that shit.
You know, I don't need that deep shit now!

1225
01:25:09,716 --> 01:25:12,418
Well, I don't think you realize what it means,
Sonny. You know? The things you do?

1226
01:25:12,669 --> 01:25:13,544
Yeah?

1227
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:15,128
I know what I do.

1228
01:25:15,629 --> 01:25:17,339
<i>You stick a gun to somebody's head.</i>

1229
01:25:17,589 --> 01:25:20,116
- Well, I don't know what I'm doing sometimes with that.
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1230
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:21,259
<i>Obviously, you don't.</i>

1231
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:23,843
"Go to sleep, Leon,
so it won't hurt when I pull the trigger."

1232
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:27,346
<i>What do you think
I've been doing in the hospital?</i>

1233
01:25:27,596 --> 01:25:30,224
I mean, I take a handful of pills
to get away from you.

1234
01:25:30,296 --> 01:25:32,000
- Right? So...
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1235
01:25:32,225 --> 01:25:34,768
Now I'm talking to you
on the phone again, right?

1236
01:25:35,018 --> 01:25:37,729
I've got no job. I don't have friends.

1237
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,606
I can't live. I have to live with people.

1238
01:25:42,483 --> 01:25:44,359
This death business, I'm sorry.

1239
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:47,778
I don't know, Leon, you know? I don't know
what I'm getting here with that shit, you know.

1240
01:25:48,028 --> 01:25:52,156
What am I supposed to say to that shit?
You know? This is going on.

1241
01:25:52,407 --> 01:25:54,826
- <i>And you're giving me that shit.</i>
- I'm sorry.

1242
01:25:55,076 --> 01:25:56,743
You know what's happening with me.
You know that.

1243
01:25:56,994 --> 01:25:59,620
You know the pressures
I've been having. Right?

1244
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:03,165
I mean, I got all these pressures and you
know about it. You're in that hospital there,

1245
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:06,626
with all them tubes coming out,
and you want that fucking operation, right?

1246
01:26:06,835 --> 01:26:09,378
You're giving me that shit.
Everybody's giving me shit.

1247
01:26:09,428 --> 01:26:11,540
Everybody needs money.
You know what I mean?

1248
01:26:11,628 --> 01:26:14,340
So you needed money,
I got you money. That's it.

1249
01:26:14,432 --> 01:26:16,092
Yeah, Well, I didn't ask you
to go and rob a bank!

1250
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:19,000
I know you didn't ask me.
I know you didn't ask me. Look.

1251
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,680
You know. I'm not putting this
on anybody. You know?

1252
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:25,932
Nothing on nobody!
I did this on my own. You see?

1253
01:26:26,002 --> 01:26:29,184
All on my own, I did it.
But I just want you to know something.

1254
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:32,688
I want you to know that I'm getting out of here.

1255
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,189
I'm getting a plane out of here,

1256
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,151
and I just wanted you to know it. That's all.
And I wanted you to come down,

1257
01:26:39,401 --> 01:26:42,361
and I wanted to just say goodbye to you.

1258
01:26:42,612 --> 01:26:45,906
Or, if you wanted to, you could come with me.

1259
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:50,110
I mean, you're free to do what you want.
That's just what I wanted to say to you. That's all.

1260
01:26:53,203 --> 01:26:55,496
- I'm free to do what I want, huh?
- <i>Right.</i>

1261
01:26:55,547 --> 01:26:58,600
Yeah, well, I've been trying to
get away from you for 6 months

1262
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:00,584
and I'm going to go with you
on a a plane trip, huh?

1263
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:02,835
Where? Where are you going?

1264
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:07,130
I don't know where yet.
We said Algeria. I don't know.

1265
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:09,466
So I'll go to Algeria. I don't know that.

1266
01:27:09,716 --> 01:27:12,217
Why are you going to Algeria?

1267
01:27:13,886 --> 01:27:16,858
I don't know why. They got a Howard
Johnson's there, so I'm going.

1268
01:27:16,896 --> 01:27:19,932
Howard Johnson's! You're warped,
you know that? You're really warped.

1269
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:22,559
<i>I'm warped. I know I'm warped.</i>

1270
01:27:22,892 --> 01:27:24,352
God! Algeria!

1271
01:27:28,021 --> 01:27:31,315
You know they walk around, they got
masks on, they got things on their heads.

1272
01:27:31,565 --> 01:27:34,335
- They're a bunch of crazy people there.
- <i>So what am I supposed to do?</i>

1273
01:27:34,377 --> 01:27:35,500
Well, I don't know.

1274
01:27:35,527 --> 01:27:38,154
- You could have picked a better place.
- <i>Like where?</i>

1275
01:27:38,404 --> 01:27:40,530
<i>Sweden? Denmark?</i>

1276
01:27:42,616 --> 01:27:44,742
Yeah, like that. Yeah.

1277
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:49,829
You know what?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1278
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,124
I had to tell him it's not a country.
He don't know where Wyoming is.

1279
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,127
See, I'm with a guy who don't know where
Wyoming is. You think you got problems?

1280
01:28:01,588 --> 01:28:03,298
So, Sal is with you, huh?

1281
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:04,715
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

1282
01:28:04,966 --> 01:28:07,009
<i>You'd be better off giving up.</i>

1283
01:28:08,094 --> 01:28:11,388
I'm not going to give up, because why have
I done this so far? You know what I mean?

1284
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:15,432
I've gone so far with this,
and why should I give up now?

1285
01:28:16,016 --> 01:28:17,559
I can't give up.

1286
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:24,189
- <i>Would you do me a favor then?</i>
- Yeah, what?

1287
01:28:26,482 --> 01:28:31,000
Well, these guys that have me down here,
you know, they think...

1288
01:28:31,444 --> 01:28:34,446
They think I'm part of it, you know?
They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank.

1289
01:28:34,947 --> 01:28:38,575
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy. They're just...

1290
01:28:38,825 --> 01:28:40,618
They're bullshitting you.
They're giving you a snow job.

1291
01:28:40,869 --> 01:28:43,495
- Now they told me I was an accessory.
- <i>No!</i>

1292
01:28:43,745 --> 01:28:46,539
<i>That's just a con job on you, Leon.
Don't listen to that shit.</i>

1293
01:28:46,747 --> 01:28:48,900
- I have to listen to it.
- <i>No!</i>

1294
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,500
I can't survive in prison, Sonny!

1295
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,670
- Oh, Leon! You're not going to prison.
- <i>How do you know?</i>

1296
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,629
Because I know. You're not
going to prison. Believe me.

1297
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,298
- Look, please, just tell them.
- <i>What do you want me to do?</i>

1298
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:00,008
Just tell them what?

1299
01:29:00,258 --> 01:29:02,093
That you didn't do it? Where am I...

1300
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:04,186
Are they on the phone now?

1301
01:29:04,242 --> 01:29:05,526
<i>Are they on the phone now?</i>

1302
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:06,721
Yeah.

1303
01:29:07,013 --> 01:29:09,599
That's great, Leon, you know.
That's really terrific!

1304
01:29:09,732 --> 01:29:12,434
<i>You talk to me with them on the phone.
That's really smart!</i>

1305
01:29:12,684 --> 01:29:14,561
- Well, I don't have a choice!
- <i>What do you mean you didn't have a choice?</i>

1306
01:29:14,852 --> 01:29:17,000
What am I supposed to do?
They're standing all around me.

1307
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:18,731
There are 7,000 fucking cops all around me.

1308
01:29:19,022 --> 01:29:20,982
- Who's on the phone now?
- <i>Don't lay it on me!</i>

1309
01:29:21,232 --> 01:29:24,000
I'm not laying it on you, but you knew
that was going on, right?

1310
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:26,445
<i>What are you talking about laying it on you?
You knew what was happening, right?</i>

1311
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:27,945
Yeah! Yeah!

1312
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:30,489
I want to know who's on the phone now.

1313
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:34,910
Moretti! Moretti, is that you on the phone?

1314
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
<i>Hello?</i>

1315
01:29:39,704 --> 01:29:42,999
Will somebody talk to me?
Somebody's going to talk to me or what?

1316
01:29:43,249 --> 01:29:44,249
They on the phone now?

1317
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:46,460
They won't talk to you.

1318
01:29:47,461 --> 01:29:51,047
All right. He didn't do it, okay?
He had nothing to do with it.

1319
01:29:52,465 --> 01:29:55,050
<i>All right? Will you get the fuck off the phone?</i>

1320
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,051
Are they off the phone?

1321
01:30:00,338 --> 01:30:01,591
- Yeah.
- <i>All right.</i>

1322
01:30:01,638 --> 01:30:05,291
That was terrific, Leon. That really convinced
them. That's what they wanted to know, right?

1323
01:30:05,338 --> 01:30:06,391
Did I do it for you or what?

1324
01:30:06,642 --> 01:30:08,685
Yeah. Yeah, thank you very much.

1325
01:30:10,728 --> 01:30:12,854
So now what? What are you going to do?

1326
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,273
Well, I thought...

1327
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,776
I thought that I would go back to the hospital.

1328
01:30:19,068 --> 01:30:23,238
You know, they're really nice there. I mean
they really seem like they're trying to help me.

1329
01:30:23,613 --> 01:30:25,739
So then, that's good, then, right?
You found something.

1330
01:30:26,532 --> 01:30:28,534
Well, I don't know if I have or not.

1331
01:30:30,493 --> 01:30:32,578
Are you still going to have the operation?

1332
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:35,120
Yeah! Yeah!

1333
01:30:36,039 --> 01:30:39,291
So then, what am I supposed to say to you?

1334
01:30:45,713 --> 01:30:46,964
Thanks a lot and...

1335
01:30:49,007 --> 01:30:50,258
bon voyage.

1336
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:53,636
Yeah, right. See you sometime.

1337
01:30:53,678 --> 01:30:56,596
Yeah. I'll see you in my dreams.

1338
01:30:56,888 --> 01:30:58,973
<i>Right, I'll write a song.</i>

1339
01:31:02,393 --> 01:31:06,646
- I don't know, you know. Life's so funny.
- <i>You said a mouthful, sweetheart.</i>

1340
01:31:11,859 --> 01:31:13,818
Well, goodbye, huh?

1341
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,300
All right.

1342
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:46,800
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Give me... Can I have...

1343
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:49,000
- <i>Moretti. Moretti!</i>
- Look. Hey. Hey!

1344
01:31:49,344 --> 01:31:52,181
You cut off the incoming calls.
Can I have a line?

1345
01:31:52,231 --> 01:31:54,932
I want to talk to my wife.
I want to talk to my kids.

1346
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,517
<i>He wants an outside line, is it all right?</i>

1347
01:31:58,144 --> 01:32:02,396
- Hey, I want a line.
- <i>Yeah, Sonny. Sonny, I'm getting it.</i>

1348
01:32:03,355 --> 01:32:06,691
You know, I could call anybody,
they'd put them on the phone.

1349
01:32:07,567 --> 01:32:09,151
The Pope, an astronaut,

1350
01:32:10,444 --> 01:32:12,237
the wisest of the wise.

1351
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:15,406
Who do I have to call?

1352
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,868
I just don't know what to do.

1353
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:29,000
- Hello?
- <i>Angie.</i>

1354
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:31,835
- Sonny! Jesus! I was watching it on TV.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1355
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:35,588
- <i>So, where are the kids?</i>
- They don't know. I sent them to the neighbors.

1356
01:32:36,255 --> 01:32:40,050
Sonny, I can't believe! I can't believe!
I mean, it ain't like you.

1357
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,118
I know.

1358
01:32:41,168 --> 01:32:44,261
<i>You've never done anything like it. You've
never hurt anybody before in your whole life.</i>

1359
01:32:44,312 --> 01:32:47,138
I'm dying, you know that? I'm dying here.

1360
01:32:47,388 --> 01:32:52,059
<i>Sonny, I blame myself. I noticed you've
been tense, like something is happening.</i>

1361
01:32:52,309 --> 01:32:55,394
<i>Like that night before last, you're
yelling at the kids like a madman.</i>

1362
01:32:55,645 --> 01:32:57,146
<i>And then you want me to go on that ride,</i>

1363
01:32:57,296 --> 01:33:00,106
the caterpillar, from here to there,
full of those kids.

1364
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:03,734
It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go
on the ride, so you yell at me.

1365
01:33:03,984 --> 01:33:08,321
"You pig, get on the fucking ride!"
Everything fell out of me. My, heart, my liver

1366
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:11,907
<i>just fell to the floor. I mean everything!</i>

1367
01:33:12,157 --> 01:33:16,286
You know what it felt like? You yelling
at me in front of all them people?

1368
01:33:16,336 --> 01:33:19,130
<i>I mean, 'cause you've never talked
to me like that before, Sonny.</i>

1369
01:33:19,222 --> 01:33:23,000
I think, "He's going to shoot me.
He's going to dump my body in the river."

1370
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,167
I mean I was scared of you! I was scared!

1371
01:33:25,459 --> 01:33:29,521
Will you shut the fuck up
and listen to me?! Just listen to me!

1372
01:33:29,591 --> 01:33:32,464
<i>You see?</i> You see that?
With the language and everything?

1373
01:33:32,756 --> 01:33:35,092
Well, I'm trying to talk to you, and you--

1374
01:33:35,342 --> 01:33:37,093
A person can't communicate with you!

1375
01:33:37,343 --> 01:33:41,012
I mean, what am I here?
I'm your wife. I'm your wife!

1376
01:33:42,139 --> 01:33:44,391
You know something? You hurt me.

1377
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:48,435
You hurt me, you know that?
Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1378
01:33:49,352 --> 01:33:51,337
<i>Did I ever do anything to make you do that?</i>

1379
01:33:51,388 --> 01:33:54,523
<i>I mean did I ever turn you down or anything?</i>

1380
01:33:54,573 --> 01:33:56,567
I know I let myself get fat.

1381
01:33:56,817 --> 01:34:00,069
- No, don't call yourself fat. Don't call yourself fat.
- I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.

1382
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:04,406
Like I can't stand you being a bank robber,
Sonny. That's what love is.

1383
01:34:04,489 --> 01:34:06,907
Yeah? You know what love is, right?

1384
01:34:07,158 --> 01:34:10,577
So if you know what love is so much, why
didn't you come down here? Where are you?

1385
01:34:12,704 --> 01:34:14,830
Talk to me about love. <i>Go ahead.</i>

1386
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:17,291
Sonny, I'm scared.

1387
01:34:17,541 --> 01:34:20,376
I'm scared. Are they going
to shoot me or something?

1388
01:34:20,626 --> 01:34:22,043
No, they're not going to shoot you!

1389
01:34:22,294 --> 01:34:26,213
<i>You should see it on the TV.
They got cannons, they got machine guns.</i>

1390
01:34:26,464 --> 01:34:28,507
They're after me, Angie, not you, you know?

1391
01:34:28,557 --> 01:34:30,617
It's late already by the time I find out.

1392
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:34,720
<i>It's just you and Sal. I mean I can't get
a babysitter. What am I going to do?</i>

1393
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,390
Listen, I think I better take him back
for a cardiac check.

1394
01:35:21,839 --> 01:35:24,000
What's the matter?
Is he going to die or what?

1395
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:26,300
No, no. We should just get him out of here.

1396
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:29,261
It's just a precautionary measure.
It's awfully warm in here.

1397
01:35:42,063 --> 01:35:44,982
All right, then. Let's go. Let him out.

1398
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:47,234
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1399
01:35:48,151 --> 01:35:49,944
I just needed the injection.

1400
01:35:50,194 --> 01:35:52,200
What's the matter with you?
You're trying to be a hero or what?

1401
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,647
You don't look good. Look. 
Let's go. We'll let you out.

1402
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:56,783
I'm not trying to be anything.

1403
01:35:57,408 --> 01:35:59,999
I just want to be left alone. Okay?

1404
01:36:01,786 --> 01:36:04,789
- No one is bothering you.
- I wish to fuck you never came into this bank!

1405
01:36:06,089 --> 01:36:07,257
That's all.

1406
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,085
Don't try to act like you're some
angel of human kindness.

1407
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:36,000
<b>Out of the closet and into the streets!</b>

1408
01:36:38,000 --> 01:37:05,000
<b>Sonny all the way!</b>

1409
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Ladies!

1410
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Ladies!

1411
01:37:25,108 --> 01:37:28,144
I want to apologize for my use
of language back there.

1412
01:37:28,894 --> 01:37:31,104
Why? What did you say, Mr. Mulvaney?

1413
01:37:38,067 --> 01:37:38,735
What did he say?

1414
01:37:38,985 --> 01:37:40,528
He said the "F" word.

1415
01:37:40,779 --> 01:37:42,321
- What?
- What did he say?

1416
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:44,156
He said the "F" word.

1417
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:54,246
- Fuck.
- I know, Miriam, I know.

1418
01:37:56,916 --> 01:38:00,710
Well, I'm a Christian,
and my ears are not garbage cans.

1419
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,000
- Come on!
- Oh, Edna!

1420
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:11,218
- Maybe we shouldn't go after them.
- Then we won't.

1421
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:13,200
- What's that?
- <i>Sonny?</i>

1422
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:16,263
<i>Could you come out, please?</i>

1423
01:38:16,521 --> 01:38:19,000
- <i>Sonny?</i>
- Shit!

1424
01:38:19,274 --> 01:38:20,600
- What?
- It's my mother.

1425
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,229
<i>Sonny?</i>

1426
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,229
<i>Someone here to see you. Sonny?</i>

1427
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:27,438
<i>Could you come out, please?</i>

1428
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
<i>Sonny.</i>

1429
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,318
Sonny, could you come out, please?

1430
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,200
Sonny.

1431
01:38:40,407 --> 01:38:42,784
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1432
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,994
- I don't need you down here.
- Oh, Sonny!

1433
01:38:47,104 --> 01:38:50,456
All of Brooklyn is out here.
Three networks of television.

1434
01:38:50,706 --> 01:38:54,084
- I got it all worked out, Ma. Don't worry Ma.
- Liaten, I talked to the man from the FBI.

1435
01:38:54,418 --> 01:38:56,252
- And he says...
- Who? No, don't talk to anybody.

1436
01:38:56,419 --> 01:38:59,797
He says if you come out now,
everything is going to be all right.

1437
01:39:00,089 --> 01:39:03,133
- Everything... I'm trying to get you out of this.
- Don't talk to the FBI, Ma.

1438
01:39:03,383 --> 01:39:04,633
- I know you are, but don't talk to them.
- I told them everything.

1439
01:39:04,842 --> 01:39:09,262
I told them how you were in the war in Vietnam.
I told them you always had good jobs.

1440
01:39:09,512 --> 01:39:13,098
I told them you were with Goldwater
in '64 in the convention and--

1441
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:16,268
Listen to me, I'm getting a plane
out of here and I'm going to Algeria.

1442
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,394
- I'll write you from there, Ma.
- Algeria?

1443
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:21,020
- Yeah. I've got to get out of here!
- I don't understand.

1444
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:23,000
If I stay out here and talk to you,

1445
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:25,800
they're not going to send me that
limousine to take me to the airport.

1446
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:27,000
They're going to think
I'm going to come out with you.

1447
01:39:27,047 --> 01:39:30,762
- What would be the matter if you came out with me?
- Because I'm not coming with you, Ma. Please!

1448
01:39:30,812 --> 01:39:33,000
- Listen, the FBI understands everything.
- Yeah.

1449
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:35,699
They understand that it is not you
that is doing this.

1450
01:39:35,949 --> 01:39:38,809
It's the pressures from your home life!

1451
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,100
Ma, don't get on Angie now.
Don't get on her.

1452
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:43,000
- Did I say one word against her?
- You were going to.

1453
01:39:43,054 --> 01:39:46,500
- Ma, she has nothing to do with it. It's me!
- Everything in your life was sweetness and roses.

1454
01:39:46,555 --> 01:39:48,542
And you...

1455
01:39:49,418 --> 01:39:53,921
You wouldn't need Leon, if Angie
was treating you right, you know that!

1456
01:39:54,254 --> 01:39:57,758
I don't understand. I don't understand
why you want to sleep with her anyway.

1457
01:39:58,008 --> 01:40:01,700
You got two kids on welfare now.
What do you want to sleep with her?

1458
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,605
- You got a wife and two kids on welfare.
- Please, Ma, not now!

1459
01:40:03,643 --> 01:40:05,305
- Now you want three kids on welfare?!
- I can't talk to you about this now!

1460
01:40:05,764 --> 01:40:07,100
- Ma, Please!
- What are you going to do, all right?

1461
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:09,391
- Come out. Come out!
- I can't come out. I can't.

1462
01:40:09,483 --> 01:40:11,434
Because Sal is in there with the people, see?

1463
01:40:11,684 --> 01:40:14,312
- If I come out, he's going to kill them.
- Oh, my God!

1464
01:40:14,604 --> 01:40:16,229
Run! Run!

1465
01:40:16,521 --> 01:40:19,732
Run? Where am I going to run?
Ma, I can't run!

1466
01:40:19,982 --> 01:40:22,443
- Maybe...
- There's no maybe. No maybes, Ma, please.

1467
01:40:22,735 --> 01:40:25,612
You got to go home now. Where's Pop? Did
he come? He didn't come down here, did he?

1468
01:40:25,904 --> 01:40:29,365
Is he pissed off at you!
He says he doesn't have a son.

1469
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
- He says you're dead.
- He's right.

1470
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:34,000
- Ma, look. Ma!
- No, no, no.

1471
01:40:34,043 --> 01:40:36,578
I'm a fuck-up and an outcast, and that's it.

1472
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:40,247
You come near me, you're going to get it.
You're going to get fucked over and fucked out!

1473
01:40:40,498 --> 01:40:43,417
Now, I got to go, Ma. Please.
Get her home, okay?

1474
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:45,126
Just take her home!

1475
01:40:45,377 --> 01:40:48,046
- How beautiful you were when you were a baby!
- Go home, please. Go home.

1476
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,873
Go home now. Go home.

1477
01:40:49,922 --> 01:40:51,673
Get her home now!

1478
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
All right.

1479
01:41:01,347 --> 01:41:03,140
(Ten minutes.)

1480
01:41:18,985 --> 01:41:21,154
Being of sound mind...

1481
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:23,155
...and body...

1482
01:41:24,281 --> 01:41:25,949
You know and all that they...

1483
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,417
To my darling wife...

1484
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:40,794
...Leon...

1485
01:41:44,755 --> 01:41:46,548
...whom I love...

1486
01:41:50,801 --> 01:41:52,553
...more than any man...

1487
01:41:53,053 --> 01:41:55,054
...has loved another man...

1488
01:41:56,305 --> 01:41:57,849
...in all eternity.

1489
01:42:02,811 --> 01:42:04,145
I leave...

1490
01:42:06,105 --> 01:42:08,982
...$2,700...

1491
01:42:11,442 --> 01:42:14,903
...from my $10,000 life insurance policy...

1492
01:42:18,906 --> 01:42:20,365
...to be used...

1493
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:24,869
...for your sex change operation.

1494
01:42:31,082 --> 01:42:34,043
If there is any money left over...

1495
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:39,297
...I want it to go to you...

1496
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:43,884
...at my first...

1497
01:42:45,384 --> 01:42:48,554
...at the first anniversary of my death...

1498
01:42:49,262 --> 01:42:50,722
...at my grave.

1499
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:01,730
To my wife...

1500
01:43:02,314 --> 01:43:03,982
...to my sweet wife...

1501
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:06,776
...Angela...

1502
01:43:10,445 --> 01:43:13,989
...5,000 from the same policy.

1503
01:43:19,327 --> 01:43:21,287
You are the only woman...

1504
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:23,622
...that I ever loved.

1505
01:43:29,377 --> 01:43:32,295
And I repledge my love to you...

1506
01:43:34,588 --> 01:43:36,423
...in this sad moment.

1507
01:43:44,137 --> 01:43:46,889
To little Kimmy...

1508
01:43:48,391 --> 01:43:49,684
...and Timmy.

1509
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,895
I hope you remember me, Timmy.

1510
01:43:57,523 --> 01:43:59,691
You're the little man of the family now.

1511
01:44:08,572 --> 01:44:11,741
And I hope you look after them for me.

1512
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:17,413
To my mother...

1513
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:23,418
...I ask forgiveness.

1514
01:44:28,587 --> 01:44:30,965
You don't understand...

1515
01:44:33,883 --> 01:44:35,719
...the things I said...

1516
01:44:37,136 --> 01:44:38,554
...and did.

1517
01:44:41,848 --> 01:44:44,434
But I'm me and I'm different.

1518
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,398
I want a military funeral.

1519
01:44:58,485 --> 01:45:01,738
And I'm entitled to have one, free of charge.

1520
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:10,202
God bless you...

1521
01:45:12,455 --> 01:45:13,955
...and watch over you...

1522
01:45:17,959 --> 01:45:20,586
...till we are joined in the hereafter.

1523
01:45:35,347 --> 01:45:38,475
Yeah, I'll sign. I'll spell that last name.

1524
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:55,029
Come on, Sarge, just one picture, huh?

1525
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,702
Back, back, back, back!

1526
01:46:34,225 --> 01:46:35,685
- You the driver?
- Yeah.

1527
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,855
I want to check it out.

1528
01:46:44,984 --> 01:46:46,025
Tese seats come out?

1529
01:46:46,101 --> 01:46:47,568
No, they're bolted.

1530
01:46:55,491 --> 01:46:58,201
All right, here. Light me on that side.

1531
01:46:59,703 --> 01:47:00,745
Give me light over there.

1532
01:47:13,964 --> 01:47:16,340
Jesus! You're the man, huh?

1533
01:47:17,717 --> 01:47:20,051
I was watching. I saw you, man!

1534
01:47:21,594 --> 01:47:24,555
You should see yourself,
you wouldn't believe it!

1535
01:47:24,847 --> 01:47:26,223
I believe it.

1536
01:47:26,473 --> 01:47:27,640
Sheila ain't gonna believe it!

1537
01:47:28,308 --> 01:47:29,892
- Who's Sheila?
- It's my old lady!

1538
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:33,353
They just called and said,
"Gas up a stretch, run it down...

1539
01:47:33,604 --> 01:47:35,646
- Give me some light over here.
- "...to 285 Prospect Park West."

1540
01:47:36,063 --> 01:47:38,733
I said, "Shit, another load of elephants
from the massage parlors!"

1541
01:47:56,412 --> 01:47:57,413
It's okay.

1542
01:47:57,872 --> 01:47:59,832
My man, I'm going to remember you.

1543
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:09,756
This is Agent Murphy. He'll be your driver.

1544
01:48:10,048 --> 01:48:11,382
No, I want him.

1545
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,321
Give me the black guy.

1546
01:48:14,384 --> 01:48:16,561
No, hey, man, I ain't into that shit.

1547
01:48:16,611 --> 01:48:18,220
Come on! Nobody's going to hurt you.

1548
01:48:19,263 --> 01:48:22,223
Hey, nobody's going to shoot. If they were
to shoot, they would've shot already.

1549
01:48:22,432 --> 01:48:24,309
- I can't allow that, Sonny.
- You can't allow?

1550
01:48:25,351 --> 01:48:28,729
What makes you think you can say
shit to me? I'm running this. Come on.

1551
01:48:30,063 --> 01:48:32,690
I'll pay you. What do you want?
$100? $200? $1,000?

1552
01:48:32,857 --> 01:48:34,566
Come on.

1553
01:48:35,776 --> 01:48:37,735
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1554
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Come on.

1555
01:48:42,072 --> 01:48:44,074
Hey, look, it'll be an adventure.

1556
01:48:49,453 --> 01:48:52,580
You men that shoot, aim for white meat.

1557
01:49:00,836 --> 01:49:01,921
Take a walk.

1558
01:49:04,089 --> 01:49:05,090
Give me him.

1559
01:49:07,424 --> 01:49:08,926
You think you're dealing with a fucking idiot?!

1560
01:49:11,386 --> 01:49:12,762
Take a walk, cop!

1561
01:49:17,891 --> 01:49:20,101
Everybody is a con man. Come on.

1562
01:49:25,313 --> 01:49:27,107
I want everybody across the street.

1563
01:49:28,774 --> 01:49:31,151
I want them all back, on the sidewalk!

1564
01:49:31,401 --> 01:49:32,819
Let's go!

1565
01:49:33,528 --> 01:49:35,821
At least I know who I'm dealing with now.

1566
01:49:39,074 --> 01:49:41,117
Here's a pen for you. Come on.

1567
01:49:51,709 --> 01:49:53,585
Don't move, okay?

1568
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,173
Sonny, here's your document.

1569
01:50:01,299 --> 01:50:03,551
- Thanks.
- Oh, yu've got to sign it.

1570
01:50:06,595 --> 01:50:08,013
We're taking off.

1571
01:50:08,263 --> 01:50:09,597
We're going now.

1572
01:50:10,264 --> 01:50:12,182
Okay, Sal. Where is he? Sal!

1573
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:13,582
Sal?

1574
01:50:14,475 --> 01:50:16,185
That's it, we're going.

1575
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,104
Yeah, people, let's go. We're going.

1576
01:50:19,771 --> 01:50:20,882
Can I get my sweater?

1577
01:50:21,001 --> 01:50:23,482
Get whatever you got when you came in here.

1578
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,200
Sal?

1579
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Sal.

1580
01:50:41,371 --> 01:50:42,663
How're you doing?

1581
01:50:42,914 --> 01:50:44,040
- Good. Yeah.
- Good?

1582
01:50:44,290 --> 01:50:46,541
We're going to do it. Right?

1583
01:50:47,042 --> 01:50:48,919
We're going to do it. Sal see?

1584
01:50:49,169 --> 01:50:51,754
You got to keep your eye on him.
Keep your eye on him. He's the driver.

1585
01:50:52,004 --> 01:50:54,298
- I need it.
- No, it's mine. Here.

1586
01:50:54,547 --> 01:50:56,758
You got to keep your eye on him, Sal, see?

1587
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,638
All right, where am I now?

1588
01:52:01,598 --> 01:52:03,141
All right, hold it, hold it!

1589
01:52:04,434 --> 01:52:05,977
All right, let's go.

1590
01:52:06,894 --> 01:52:08,938
Swing around now. Swing around.

1591
01:52:10,355 --> 01:52:12,065
Just keep holding hands.

1592
01:52:18,111 --> 01:52:19,112
Hold it!

1593
01:52:21,664 --> 01:52:24,074
All right. Break it on "three", okay?
Not yet, don't break it.

1594
01:52:24,403 --> 01:52:25,500
One...

1595
01:52:26,303 --> 01:52:27,300
Two...

1596
01:52:28,403 --> 01:52:29,829
Three, go!

1597
01:52:41,045 --> 01:52:43,046
Oh, fuck! We did it!

1598
01:52:43,422 --> 01:52:44,631
We did it!

1599
01:52:44,723 --> 01:52:46,074
Wish us luck!

1600
01:52:48,023 --> 01:52:49,074
Bye-bye.

1601
01:52:51,136 --> 01:52:52,304
Okay, you got your one.

1602
01:52:52,929 --> 01:52:54,014
Follow my car.

1603
01:53:07,024 --> 01:53:08,566
Sheldon here. Get me Kennedy.

1604
01:53:08,602 --> 01:53:09,619
Sal.

1605
01:53:09,942 --> 01:53:11,319
We did it!

1606
01:53:13,361 --> 01:53:15,696
I'll be a son of a bitch! We did it!

1607
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:19,283
Okay, let's move. Come on, honk the horn.

1608
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:24,161
Hey, Sal. Do me a favor, will you?

1609
01:53:24,211 --> 01:53:27,372
Keep the gun pointed up.
We hit a bump, and it's going to go off.

1610
01:53:37,713 --> 01:53:39,006
All right, you set out there?

1611
01:53:42,509 --> 01:53:44,344
We're leaving now.

1612
01:53:44,594 --> 01:53:46,428
We want no trouble en route.

1613
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:50,781
- Intersections check?
- <i>Check.</i>

1614
01:53:53,433 --> 01:53:56,895
- Right. We'll be starting up right now.
- <i>10-4.</i>

1615
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,337
It's going to be all right.

1616
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Sal?

1617
01:54:57,816 --> 01:55:00,818
Sal, you just have to remember
to keep the gun pointed up.

1618
01:57:27,847 --> 01:57:29,055
What's he doing over there?

1619
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,808
He's still got some arrangements to make.

1620
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:47,000
- That's it?
- That's it.

1621
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:50,697
Sal, see it? There it is.

1622
01:58:47,532 --> 01:58:49,158
Oh, I forgot!

1623
01:58:49,408 --> 01:58:51,535
I forgot to ask if they got any food on board.

1624
01:58:56,213 --> 01:58:57,956
Are they going to have any food on board?

1625
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:05,170
There's your jet.

1626
01:59:05,587 --> 01:59:07,631
We get one more now, right?
That's the deal.

1627
01:59:07,881 --> 01:59:10,174
Right. Okay, who goes?

1628
01:59:10,674 --> 01:59:11,759
Sylvia?

1629
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:14,803
Maria.

1630
01:59:23,067 --> 01:59:25,268
I'll pray for you.

1631
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Sal?

1632
01:59:27,705 --> 01:59:30,356
'Cause this is your first plane trip,

1633
01:59:30,508 --> 01:59:32,942
don't be scared, okay?

1634
01:59:46,293 --> 01:59:49,663
Hey, I just realized. I didn't eat all day.
Is there going to be any food on board?

1635
01:59:49,838 --> 01:59:51,580
There'll be hamburgers on the plane.
You ready?

1636
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:56,500
- Sal?
- What?

1637
01:59:57,219 --> 01:59:58,460
Ready to go?

1638
01:59:59,511 --> 02:00:00,596
Yeah.

1639
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:08,000
Okay. Let's move.

1640
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:10,800
Sal.

1641
02:00:12,088 --> 02:00:15,473
We don't want any accidents
at this point, right?

1642
02:00:15,807 --> 02:00:17,559
Keep your gun pointed up.

1643
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:21,520
You ready to get out first?

1644
02:00:21,854 --> 02:00:22,729
I'm ready.

1645
02:00:28,233 --> 02:00:29,234
Don't shoot me.

1646
02:01:08,022 --> 02:01:09,681
Now spread them!

1647
02:01:15,811 --> 02:01:17,437
We're all secure here.

1648
02:01:17,729 --> 02:01:20,231
Murphy will report from the car.

1649
02:01:24,943 --> 02:01:26,527
You make the report.

1650
02:01:26,819 --> 02:01:28,196
Put the gun down.

1651
02:01:28,446 --> 02:01:29,697
Back off.

1652
02:01:30,572 --> 02:01:32,282
Get up now, Sonny.

1653
02:01:33,241 --> 02:01:34,700
You're under arrest.

1654
02:01:34,992 --> 02:01:37,078
You have the right to remain silent.

1655
02:01:37,328 --> 02:01:40,830
You have the right to an attorney
to be present during your interrogation.

1656
02:01:41,122 --> 02:01:45,292
Anything you say can and will be used
