Early evening.

55
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,130
They never said

56
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,830
what the caliber
of the bullet was.

57
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,960
Apparently .38.

58
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,130
Apparently?

59
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,660
It made
an entry wound

of a .38.

Was the slug
smashed against the wall?

No.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,180
Actually,
there was no
exit wound.

Hi.

00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,790
What we've got
so far is--

72
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,830
Ice.

73
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,960
Instead of lead.

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,310
Ice.

75
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,920
The murderer pours water
into a .38 caliber mold,

76
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,180
freezes it,
and keeps it solid

77
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,790
until the crime.

78
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,130
Then he shoots the guy
with the ice bullet.

79
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,220
Cops show up,
there's just a few
drops of water.

80
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,390
No bullet,
no ballistics.

81
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,700
That's great.

I'm not sure.

94
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,830
We're going to Sam

95

Mm-hmm.

about it.

Mm-hmm.

but it's not
my department,"

102
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,130

he doesn't think
there's anything,

103
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,830

104

a very odd assortment
of languages--

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,960

1650
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:38,820
Why'd you call so late?

1651
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:40,000
We were worried
about you.

1652
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,520
Likewise. The car for me?

1653
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,520
It's all right.
It's safe.

1654
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,080
You'll have a few hours
of debriefing.

1655
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:48,210
Hey, Higgins ? Yeah?

1656
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:51,740
Let's say, for the purposes
of argument,

1657
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:55,560
I had a .45
in one of my pockets

1658
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:57,870
and I wanted you
to walk with me.

1659
01:51:57,870 --> 01:51:59,820
You'd do it, right?

1660
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:02,260
Which way?

1661
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,910
West.

1662
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:06,910
And slowly.

1663
01:52:06,910 --> 01:52:10,650
Stay in front of me
about three or four steps.

1664
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:19,480
Where we going?

1665
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,520
Wave them on ahead.

1666
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:36,390
Do we have plans to invade
the Middle East?

1667
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:37,740
Are you crazy?

1668
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:38,780
Am I ?

1669
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,910
Look, Turner--

1670
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:41,170
Do we have plans?

1671
01:52:41,170 --> 01:52:43,170
No. Absolutely not.

1672
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:45,560
We have games.

1673
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:46,650
That's all.

1674
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:47,910
We play games--

1675
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:49,170
What if?

1676
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:50,430
How many men?

1677
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:51,950
What would it take?

1678
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:53,780
Is there a cheaper way

1679
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:55,080
to destabilize a regime?

1680
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:56,950
That's what we're
paid to do.

1681
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:58,950
Walk on.

1682
01:52:58,950 --> 01:53:00,430
Go on.

1683
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:07,260
So Atwood just
took the games
too seriously.

1684
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:10,170
He was really going
to do it, wasn't he?

1685
01:53:10,170 --> 01:53:11,870
A renegade operation.

1686
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:14,740
Atwood knew 5412 would
never authorize it,

1687
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:17,260
not with the heat
on the company.

1688
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,740
What if there hadn't
been any heat?

1689
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:22,820
Suppose I hadn't stumbled
on their plan?

1690
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:25,000
Different ballgame.

1691
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:28,520
Fact is, there
was nothing wrong
with the plan.

1692
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,130
The plan
was all right.

1693
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:33,820
The plan
would've worked.

1694
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:35,740
Boy, what is it
with you people?

1695
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:38,610
You think not getting
caught in a lie

1696
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:40,520
is the same thing
as telling the truth?

1697
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,470
No. It's simple economics.

1698
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:44,210
Today it's oil, right?

1699
01:53:44,210 --> 01:53:47,610
In 10 or 15 years--
food, plutonium,

1700
01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:49,470
and maybe even sooner.

1701
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:51,470
What do you think
the people

1702
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:52,820
are going to want us
to do then?

1703
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:54,820
Ask them.

1704
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:58,170
Now now. Then.
Ask them when
they're running out.

1705
01:53:58,170 --> 01:54:01,260
Ask them when
there's no heat
and they're cold.

1706
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:03,300
Ask them when
their engines stop.

1707
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,780
Ask them when people who
have never known hunger

1708
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:08,260
start going hungry.
Want to know something?

1709
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:10,130
They won't want us
to ask them.

1710
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:12,390
They'll want us
to get it for them.

1711
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:15,870
Boy,

1712
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:17,740
have you found a home.

1713
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,820
There were seven people
killed, Higgins .

1714
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:22,820
The company
didn't order it.

1715
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:26,520
Atwood did.

1716
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,520
And who the hell
is Atwood ?

1717
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,000
He's you.
He's all you guys.

1718
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,470
Seven people killed,

1719
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:34,350
and you play fucking games!

1720
01:54:34,350 --> 01:54:36,210
Right.

1721
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:38,560
And the other side
does, too.

1722
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,430
That's why
we can't let you
stay outside.

1723
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:43,170
Well, go on home, Higgins .

1724
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:45,560
Go on. They've got it.

1725
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:46,870
What?

1726
01:54:46,870 --> 01:54:48,560
You know where we are.

1727
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,210
Just look around.
They've got it.

1728
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,430
That's where they ship from.

1729
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:54,430
They've got all of it.

1730
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:05,780
What? What did you do?

1731
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:08,000
I told them a story.

1732
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,820
You play games,

1733
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:12,300
I told them a story.

1734
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:22,470
Oh, you--

1735
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:25,260
you poor, dumb
son of a bitch.

1736
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:28,390
You've done
more damage
than you know.

1737
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:31,740
I hope so.

1738
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,390
You're about to be
a very lonely man.

1739
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:47,950
It didn't have
to end this way.

1740
01:55:47,950 --> 01:55:49,780
Of course it did.

1741
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:53,740
Hey, Turner.

1742
01:55:55,130 --> 01:55:58,610
How do you know
they'll print it?

1743
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,560
You can take a walk,

1744
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,130
but how far if they
don't print it?

1745
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:08,000
They'll print it.

1746
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,470
How do you know?
