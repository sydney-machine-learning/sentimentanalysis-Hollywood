1
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,175
Show them the courage of Allah!

2
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,915
- He says you stole the bread.
- It's a lie.

3
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,127
I caught him stealing ours.

4
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,462
Cut off the infidel's hand.

5
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,590
No, I took the bread!

6
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,342
- That's not true.
- They're not interested in the truth.

7
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,888
- But he's lying!
- You're too weak, Peter. You won't live.

8
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,097
As you wish.

9
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,934
- Cut the other's hand off as well.
- I'm sorry.

10
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,186
I'm sorry, Robin.

11
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,358
Oh, God!

12
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,160
No! No! No!

13
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,305
This is English courage.

14
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,865
That's for five years of hell!

15
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,791
Behind you!

16
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,843
Come on, Robin, for God's sake!
Come on!

17
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,639
Wait! Take us with you!

18
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,230
You cannot save those people, Christian!

19
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,817
- But you can save me!
- They're coming, Robin.

20
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,529
Christian!

21
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,906
- Why should I?
- For pity's sake.

22
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,034
- Mine is a sentence of death.
- He's a Moor! Don't listen!

23
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,412
Set me free! I will show you a way out.

24
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,999
- Why should we?
- Lf you do not, we are all dead men.

25
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,043
No, Robin, for God's sake!
Robin, they're coming!

26
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,429
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry! Come, Christian! Come!

27
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,438
This way!

28
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,281
Thanks. I misjudged you.

29
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,782
You are fast with a sword.

30
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,578
Five years I have waited to smell
free air. That makes a man fast.

31
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,457
Peter!

32
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,129
It's mortal.

33
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,797
Leave me.

34
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,302
Give this ring to my sister, Marian.

35
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,721
Now swear you'll protect her for me.

36
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,849
His wound is by the heart.
We cannot save him.

37
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,143
Swear it, Robin!

38
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,854
- I swear it.
- They're coming!

39
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,815
Tell Marian I died a free Englishman.

40
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,903
Peter! Peter. Peter!

41
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,905
For England!

42
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,829
Come, my friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honor.

43
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,664
Come now!

44
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,403
Why did you cut me free, Christian?

45
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,575
Whatever blood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

46
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,708
Farewell, friend.

47
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,836
God speed your way.

48
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,505
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

49
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,756
What?

50
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,591
You have saved my life, Christian.

51
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,428
I will stay with you until I have saved yours.
That is my vow.

52
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,391
Thanks, but I go to England.
I relieve you of your obligation.

53
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,643
Only Allah can do that.

54
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,063
What if I say no?

55
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,648
You have no choice.

56
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,235
I am Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir.

57
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,529
You may call me Azeem.

58
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,534
Robin of Locksley.

59
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,175
Kindest sir:

60
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,261
It is rumored you fought
in King Richard's Crusade...

61
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,930
...with my beloved son, Robin.

62
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,851
I fear you have returned home
to desperate times...

63
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,771
...when dark forces
plot against our absent king.

64
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,858
I am anxious for word of my son.

65
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,278
Were you present at his capture
near Jerusalem?

66
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,865
Do you know the name of the potentate
who holds him?

67
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,118
Does he still bear me ill will?

68
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,621
A little news, please, sir.

69
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,958
I would give all that I own
for his release.

70
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,725
- Stop there!
- Help me, my lord!

71
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,394
You should have waited!

72
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,566
- I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.
- Duncan, it's all right. Let him go.

73
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,113
They've taken my Gwen.
My daughter!

74
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,408
- Who's taken her?
- Men! On horses.

75
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,619
In masks.

76
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,829
We tried to stop them, but...

77
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,791
My son is dead.

78
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,668
He's dead.

79
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,138
Master, stay.
There is an evil moon tonight.

80
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,016
Never fear, Duncan.
Good will overcome.

81
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,310
Trust in that.

82
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,536
I'm sorry, my lord.
I had no choice.

83
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,379
You!

84
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,840
Locksley.

85
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,134
The king shall hear of this!

86
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,052
Join us.

87
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,846
Never.

88
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,598
Join us...

89
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,684
...or die.

90
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,815
God and King Richard!

91
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,952
Thank you, Lord.

92
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,878
I'm home!

93
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,132
You are strange, Christian.

94
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,635
Yes. But I'm free!

95
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:04,139
Now I beg you to free yourself of your vow.
Return with the boat.

96
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,976
I know how it feels to be so far
from your home and family.

97
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,815
Because I love them so much,
I cannot dishonor them.

98
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,736
I thought you'd say that.

99
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,756
No man controls my destiny.

100
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,552
Especially not one who attacks
downwind and stinks of garlic.

101
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
Come, Azeem!

102
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,230
Our fighting days are done.

103
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,568
By nightfall,
we'll celebrate with my father.

104
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,699
You understand, of course...

105
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,409
...I had to try.

106
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,661
I would have succeeded.

107
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,170
Why must you walk in back of me?

108
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,047
In your country, am I not the infidel?

109
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,845
It seems safer to appear as your slave
rather than your equal.

110
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,806
For an infidel you have
uncommon clarity of thinking.

111
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,185
Yet you tell me of nothing of yourself.
For instance, your name.

112
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,896
- Azeem. What does it mean?
- It means "great one."

113
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,608
Great one, really?
Did you give yourself this name?

114
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,154
It's a joke.

115
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,744
Azeem the great one, I am home!

116
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,665
Look!

117
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,002
Mistletoe.

118
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,716
Many a maid's lost her resolve to me
thanks to this little plant.

119
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,846
In my country, we talk to our women.

120
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,599
We do not drug them with plants.

121
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,060
What do you know of women?

122
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,981
Where I come from, Christian...

123
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,486
...there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man's mind so...

124
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,113
...that he would be willing
to die for them.

125
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,202
Wait. Is that why
you were to be executed?

126
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,663
Because of a woman?

127
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,960
That's it, isn't it?

128
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,795
That's it!

129
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,384
It is close to sunset.

130
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,136
You painted old dog.
Who was she?

131
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,347
The mullah's daughter?

132
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,350
Huh?

133
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,686
Another man's wife?

134
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,480
What's her name?

135
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,360
Is there no sun in this cursed country?!

136
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,821
Which way is east?

137
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,323
- Her name?
- East!

138
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,325
Her name.

139
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,456
Jasmina.

140
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,500
That way.

141
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,169
- You are sure?
- I'd know blindfolded.

142
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,505
I'm five miles from home.

143
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,096
Was she worth it?

144
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,558
Worth dying for.

145
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,328
Come on, boy, run!

146
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,375
You're dog's meat, son!

147
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,738
You're dog's meat, son,
do you know that?

148
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,785
Get down here! You know what
you've done. Come down here!

149
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,538
- Down!
- You're not playing by the rules, boy.

150
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,208
Deer don't climb trees.

151
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,794
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

152
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,630
Shall we teach him to fly?

153
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,925
Get him down.

154
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,469
Hold.

155
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:58,266
I'm curious as to what manner of creature
is so fearsome it takes six men to attack it?

156
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,478
Stand down. This is no affair of yours.

157
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,648
Well, have we treed the devil himself?
Let me see.

158
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,152
A small boy, a truly dangerous animal.

159
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,948
This boy killed one
of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

160
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,659
You starve us! We needed the meat.

161
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,287
I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
This is the sheriff's land.

162
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,997
Wrong.

163
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:25,836
This is my land and my tree. Therefore
whatever's in it also belongs to me.

164
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:32,676
Might I have the pleasure of your name
before I have you run through?

165
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,804
Robin of Locksley.

166
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,019
Well, well...
Locksley.

167
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,273
Welcome home.

168
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,152
- Kill him!
- To arms, swords!

169
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,237
- Come on, hurry up!
- He's armed!

170
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,491
Azeem! It's time to redeem that vow!

171
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,870
Unleash the hounds!

172
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,081
Get off your damn knees!

173
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,670
Look out!

174
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,887
Yeah!

175
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,518
Now, sir...

176
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,731
...if you'd be so kind as to give me
your name before I run you through.

177
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,735
Guy of Gisborne, the sheriff's cousin.

178
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,157
- That little bastard was poaching deer.
- Poach?

179
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,035
Is it not a greater crime
to starve a family?

180
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,371
Go on, Locksley.

181
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,499
Go on.

182
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,462
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

183
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,381
Now get off my land.

184
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,351
Tell Nottingham what happens to his scum
when they pick on small children.

185
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,397
You.

186
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,527
You travel 10,000 miles to save my life,
then leave me to be butchered?!

187
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,238
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

188
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,407
Which does not include prayer times
or meal times...

189
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,827
...or any time I'm outnumbered 6 to 1.

190
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,371
You whine like a mule.

191
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,415
You are still alive.

192
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,716
Have no fear. Come down, boy.

193
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,849
Is it true, boy? Did you kill a deer?

194
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,435
Hundreds of them.

195
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,900
You scared him.

196
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,950
Interesting place, this...

197
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,702
...England.

198
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,225
Hold up, Sir Guy.
The sheriff's not to be disturbed.

199
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,152
Cousin.

200
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,656
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

201
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:47,579
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people.

202
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,123
Who told you to cover up?

203
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,500
His name?

204
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,753
Robin of Locksley.

205
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,213
The prodigal son returns.

206
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,383
He's a whelp!
This girl could best him.

207
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,677
Put it there!

208
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,101
Yes, well, this whelp
bested four of my men.

209
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,772
Yes, well, your men were probably drunk.

210
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,069
- Yet you survived, cousin.
- I barely survived.

211
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,202
- Markings of Islam.

212
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,872
I'm sure it will take an army
to match these rogues.

213
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,628
I trust Locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning.

214
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,590
Time for portents, cousin.

215
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,853
Mortianna?

216
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,789
Shut up.

217
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,634
You called, madam?

218
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,126
What do you see?

219
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,257
- The son of a dead man.
- Locksley.

220
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,304
- Does he affect us?
- He precedes the Lionheart.

221
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,766
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
That could prove awkward...

222
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,518
...and will soften the spines
of the barons. Soon?

223
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,479
Make haste.

224
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,190
But my plan is still intact?

225
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,278
What is wrong?

226
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,948
I have seen our death.

227
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,452
The painted man,
he haunts my dreams.

228
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,539
Adorned with strange,
foreign markings.

229
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,084
Locksley's companion!

230
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,713
Kill him. Kill them both.

231
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,931
Father?

232
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,769
Father! Anyone here?

233
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,813
Duncan!

234
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,357
Father!

235
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,619
No.

236
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,083
No!

237
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,503
- Who is it?
- It's my father.

238
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:34,556
Who's there?

239
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,516
Master Robin?

240
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,561
Is that you?

241
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,146
Duncan?

242
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,899
Praise be! I thought God
had abandoned us.

243
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,401
Duncan, my father...

244
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,695
- It's a miracle!
- Why...?

245
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,781
- Why didn't you cut him down?
- It's a miracle, I never thought...

246
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,034
- Damn you, Duncan, are you deaf?!
- Easy!

247
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,870
Look at him.

248
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,166
I would have done if I could see.

249
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,297
Who did this to you, Duncan?

250
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,592
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

251
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,720
With the sheriff and his witch
looking on.

252
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,432
- Why?
- They say the sheriff captured your father...

253
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,309
...worshipping the devil.

254
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,812
That he signed a confession
before the bishop.

255
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,983
No, that's not possible.

256
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:31,154
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

257
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,115
Did you believe the charges?

258
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,369
Not even when they took my eyes.

259
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,549
We must go.

260
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,348
He loved you to the end, young master.

261
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,309
He never gave up hope of your return.

262
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,645
I should have been here.

263
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,067
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

264
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:13,655
He said it was vanity to force
other men to our religion.

265
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,282
But you must flee now.

266
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,744
Head south to safety.
Gisborne will surely seek revenge.

267
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,080
I hear you, Duncan.

268
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,667
You should go home.

269
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,379
My world is turned upside down here.

270
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,423
I cannot ask you to come
where I am going.

271
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,135
Alone, Christian,
you will only get yourself killed.

272
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,180
Besides...

273
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:43,142
...there is nothing left
for me to go home to.

274
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:51,234
I will not rest
until my father's avenged!

275
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,198
I swear it...

276
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,409
...by my own blood.

277
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,714
What is this place?

278
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,549
Peter's home.

279
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:18,136
It's nearly six years
since we left together.

280
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,139
We'll find food and shelter here.

281
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,728
No more beggars!

282
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,073
Tell the mistress of the house
Robin of Locksley's at her door.

283
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,617
Her ladyship's not here.

284
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,954
Is the child Marian at home?

285
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,623
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

286
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,465
The hospitality in this country
is as warm as the weather.

287
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,926
- It's a joke.
- Really?

288
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,179
Leave your weapons.

289
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,975
Just you.

290
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,700
Wait here.

291
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,411
Right here?

292
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,295
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

293
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:39,592
Were it not for their ungodly ways,
Master Robin would never have left.

294
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,556
What manner of name is Azeem?

295
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,393
Irish? Cornish?

296
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,020
Moorish.

297
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,943
Who are you?

298
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,655
Robin of Locksley.

299
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,365
You lie. Robin is dead.

300
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,201
Step into the light.

301
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,125
Turn around.

302
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,423
Am I to dance next?

303
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,095
- Who are you?
- I am the Maid Marian.

304
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,182
Well, then show yourself, child,
for we knew each other well.

305
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,945
The years have...

306
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,614
...been kind.
- Thank you.

307
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,410
With the king away,
we must guard against villainous outlaws...

308
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:51,747
...who would kidnap a relative of his.
- You can see I am not one of those.

309
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,875
Perhaps.

310
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,253
Now remove yourself from this house.

311
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,425
I would, my lady,
but I'm sworn to protect you.

312
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,302
Protect me?

313
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,055
Robin of Locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully.

314
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:14,270
And besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

315
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,397
Marian, wait!

316
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:22,028
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

317
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,083
Point me toward danger, Azeem!
I'm ready!

318
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,580
Hello, Marian.

319
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,715
His last thoughts were of you.

320
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,472
Oh, Peter.

321
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,769
I'm sorry, Marian.

322
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,355
I'm sorry.

323
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:45,194
How do I know you didn't abandon him
to save your own skin?

324
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,322
No one feels his loss more than I.

325
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,951
Next time I'm in London,
I'll give my mother your condolences.

326
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,165
I would think for your safety
that you would join her there.

327
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,876
I have no interest in life at court.

328
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,297
All that gossipmongering
and currying favor.

329
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,633
But you're alone here.

330
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,680
Hardly.
These years have left us many in need.

331
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,810
While you and my brother played heroes,
Nottingham plundered the shire.

332
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,521
I see you still have your lands.

333
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,818
Because I give him
no excuse to take them.

334
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:31,365
I am the king's cousin. It is my station
to look after these people until his return.

335
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,370
Marian.

336
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:41,459
Marian. Marian.

337
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,714
My purpose in coming here
was not to hurt you.

338
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,218
I swore... I swore to your brother
that I would protect you.

339
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,889
You cannot replace my brother.

340
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,351
I don't want to replace him.

341
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:03,064
I've returned to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered.

342
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,234
The only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old blind man.

343
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,239
All I remember of you
is a spoiled bully...

344
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,785
...who used to burn my hair as a child.

345
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,998
Please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man.

346
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,715
Robin, whatever happened between you
and your father, you mustn't believe...

347
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,176
...what they accused him of.

348
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,095
I don't.

349
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,347
Christian!

350
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,607
Look.

351
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,401
Look!

352
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,593
How did your uneducated kind
ever take Jerusalem?

353
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,845
God knows.

354
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,430
What is it?

355
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,816
- What is it?
- It's Nottingham's soldiers.

356
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,986
Coming here? Is this your protection?

357
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:35,322
- I killed some of the sheriff's men.
- Oh, dear.

358
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,159
I fear I have placed you in danger.

359
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,619
I can take care of myself.
Just go!

360
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,913
No, that's my horse!

361
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,416
A truly magnificent animal, my lady.

362
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,171
Come on!

363
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,259
- Go!
- I said, I'm sworn to protect you.

364
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,595
And I say no more boyish gestures.

365
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,764
I'm not leaving.

366
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,811
Stop them!
They're stealing my horses!

367
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,690
- You're so kind, Marian.
- Ooh!

368
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,377
Been sheltering outlaws,
Lady Marian?

369
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:35,007
- They're thieves, you imbecile.
- Lucky he didn't steal your virtue as well.

370
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,469
A crown to the man who brings me
Locksley's head! My lady.

371
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,347
Have we lost them?

372
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,599
No!

373
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,728
My horse carries two. Yours is lame.
We cannot outrun them.

374
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,399
Leave me, Master Robin!
I slow your escape.

375
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:38,112
- We can lose them in the forest.
- Sherwood Forest is haunted.

376
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:42,366
Either we take our chances with ghosts
or become ghosts ourselves.

377
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,223
Come on, damn you!

378
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,892
There are only three of them!

379
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,729
It's not the men we fear, sir.
It's the evil spirits.

380
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,981
Robin of the Hood!

381
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,525
Son of a devil worshipper!

382
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,652
Your father died a coward...

383
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,573
...cursing your name
and squealing like a stuck pig!

384
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,744
You will bring no justice to your father
by dying today.

385
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,524
Master Robin?

386
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,361
There are your ghosts, Duncan.

387
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,237
Wind chimes.

388
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,032
A child's toy put to good use.

389
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:09,244
You scare easily, my painted Moor.

390
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,376
This forest has eyes.

391
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,544
I swear it.

392
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:40,109
In my dreams alone
have I imagined such a place.

393
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,238
Then imagine a way to cross it.

394
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,855
There's hope!

395
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,279
There was a rich man from Nottingham

396
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,448
Who tried to cross the river

397
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,034
What a dope
He tripped on a rope

398
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,453
Now look at him shiver

399
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,414
Beg for mercy, rich man!

400
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,294
I beg of no man.

401
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:56,018
This here is our river, and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax.

402
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,562
I will pay no tax.

403
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,149
As you can see, I have nothing.

404
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,944
- Not even my sword.
- Bollocks!

405
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,156
Any man who travels with two servants...

406
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:12,159
...and claims he's got no bloody money...

407
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:17,164
...is either a fool or a liar.
- Yeah, he's a liar!

408
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,375
- Who are you?
- John Little.

409
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,421
Best man of the woods.
Eh, lads?

410
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,091
Tell him, John!
That's right!

411
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:32,513
Well, best man, you lead this rabble?

412
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,681
Yes, I do, mate.

413
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,853
And if you tosspots want to travel through
Sherwood Forest, it's gonna cost you...

414
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,606
...that gold medallion.

415
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,029
This is sacred to me.

416
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,615
It's sacred to us too, mate.

417
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,577
That there will feed us
for a blooming month.

418
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,705
- You'II have to fight me for it.
- Ooh!

419
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,707
Love to, mate.

420
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,715
Be careful, Father.

421
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,009
He walloped 12 of the sheriff's men.

422
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,053
Is that so?

423
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,722
Reckon I'm gonna enjoy this.

424
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,058
Hey.

425
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,311
That's your father?

426
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,734
You should help me.

427
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,135
Wee!

428
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,054
He's drowning!

429
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,433
Lost something?

430
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,188
Thanks for the taxes.

431
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,941
Looks like the little rich boy's
lost for words, eh?

432
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:13,488
- Any great ideas?
- Get up! Move faster!

433
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,450
Move faster. Great idea.

434
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,709
Watch it, John!

435
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,300
- We're not through yet.
- All right, my old cocker.

436
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,802
You want another good walloping?

437
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,846
You shall have one.

438
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,110
Seems I've made it past the gate,
John Little.

439
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:56,615
- Or should I call you Little John?
- Hit him, Father! Wallop him!

440
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,919
- You can do it!
- Good shot!

441
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,714
You've bloodied him, John,
you've bloodied him.

442
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,431
Swimming time again, old chum.

443
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,699
Where is he? Do you see him?

444
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,755
It's a blooming shame!

445
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,924
He was a brave lad!

446
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,556
Help!

447
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:06,643
- Do you yield?
- I can't bloody swim!

448
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,564
- Do you yield?
- Yes!

449
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,359
Good. Now put your feet down.

450
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,866
I'll be buggered.

451
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:26,413
- The medallion.
- Give me your name first.

452
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,665
Robin of Locksley.

453
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,294
Well, Robin of Locksley...

454
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:35,339
...you got balls of solid rock.
Come on.

455
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,596
That's Much, the miller's son,
Harold Brownwell.

456
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:48,018
That stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the lads all calls him Bull.

457
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,979
- Because you're short?
- Nope.

458
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,899
It's because I'm so long!

459
00:44:56,903 --> 00:45:01,615
- They ought to have a look.
- No, Bull, save it! Save it for the ladies.

460
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,618
Give the man some mead.

461
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,623
Now, I made that myself.

462
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,961
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years...

463
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,798
...that a friend of mine's not welcome
at this table?

464
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,342
But he's a savage, sire!

465
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,303
That he is.

466
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,432
But no more than you or I.

467
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,853
And don't call me sire.

468
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,192
With regret, I must decline.

469
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,279
- Allah forbids it.
- Your bloody loss, mate.

470
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,366
How is it there are so many of you
in hiding?

471
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:48,328
We're all outlaws.
Got prices on our heads.

472
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,996
Even the young lad there.

473
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:54,376
It's that blasted sheriff,
he says we owes him taxes.

474
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:58,755
You know, your ghosts will only keep
the sheriff's men at bay so long.

475
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,883
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

476
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,142
We can always fight back.

477
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,189
I reckon I must've cracked
that noble head of yours.

478
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,692
These are all good lads here.

479
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,361
They've got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

480
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,824
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

481
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,743
They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

482
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,246
- A witch?
- She knows every man's thoughts.

483
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:35,417
- You can see through her. And she flies.
- That's a load of codswallop.

484
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:39,212
What does the rich son of a devil worshipper
care what happens to outlaw peasants?

485
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,923
My lord was a kind and generous man!

486
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,177
Who among you dares
believe him capable...?

487
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,929
My father was no devil worshipper.

488
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:52,309
And I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

489
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,022
But he's right.

490
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,401
I was a rich man's son.

491
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,573
But when I killed the sheriff's men...

492
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,702
...I became an outlaw like you.
- You are nothing like us.

493
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,957
That there's Will Scarlett.

494
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,544
Don't take no notice of him.
He's full of piss and wind.

495
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,422
Come on, lads, drink up.

496
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,175
Stop talking so much bloody rubbish.

497
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,970
This here is the best
that we simple men can expect.

498
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,306
Here we're safe.

499
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:35,060
Here we are kings.

500
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,296
- Too much mead, old friend?
- Forgive me, I oversleep.

501
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,174
No. No, no. Rest yourself.

502
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,187
- What day is it, Duncan?
- Sunday, I think.

503
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,233
Do they still give alms
to the poor at Mass?

504
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,776
That they do.

505
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,947
These days, the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

506
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:47,132
Well, my other god calls.

507
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,261
Oh, don't upset yourself, Mortianna.

508
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,348
Appearances are important to that lot,
especially on a Sunday.

509
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:59,936
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

510
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,690
Although...

511
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,943
...frankly, sometimes...

512
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,031
...I can't see much difference.

513
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:18,496
Did my parents truly tell you
to instruct me in all this?

514
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,791
Their dying wish.

515
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,751
We beseech thy blessing, Lord...

516
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:09,756
...on all your people,
but most especially...

517
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:13,259
...on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

518
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,597
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

519
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,266
...our glorious city.

520
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,769
Grant him also the strength...

521
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,606
...to bring to justice
the lawless men...

522
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:31,152
...who would threaten its safety
and prosperity.

523
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,030
And the judgment
to punish them...

524
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,492
...in your name. Amen.

525
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,245
Amen.

526
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,205
Go in peace.

527
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,424
- Sarah?
- Yes.

528
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,596
- That's all I have.
- God bless you, ma'am.

529
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,534
Alms for a blind man, my lady?

530
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,246
For one who cannot see your beauty?

531
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,544
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

532
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,172
Searching my soul.

533
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,508
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

534
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,178
Do you prefer the company of Nottingham?

535
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,054
There's a price on your head.

536
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,724
- How much?
- One hundred gold pieces.

537
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,684
Is that all?

538
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:48,730
I shall have to annoy the good sheriff more.
Soon it will be 1000.

539
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,483
For 1000, I would turn you in myself.

540
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,027
Nottingham is mounting an army.

541
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:58,531
He has every blacksmith in the county holed
up in the castle making swords and armor.

542
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,950
- What is he planning?
- I don't know.

543
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,995
But there's no limit
to the man's ambitions.

544
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,750
- Go. Quickly, go!
- Thank you.

545
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,336
Robin, do something for me.

546
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,713
- What?
- Take a bath.

547
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,882
Take a bath?

548
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:38,279
These are my private chambers, my son.

549
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,158
I have priests who would
hear your confession.

550
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,202
- Ah!
- Shh.

551
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,836
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

552
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,422
Welcome home, Robin.

553
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,135
You shine like the sun, my lady.

554
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,097
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

555
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:08,393
My cousin tells me the knave
deprived you of some horses.

556
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,521
- Yes, a most disagreeable experience.
- Yes, I know.

557
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,690
And for inflicting that upon you...

558
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,734
...l'm going to hang him from the walls
by his entrails.

559
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,944
I'd like to see that.

560
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,697
If you'd bring your household
within the city...

561
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,199
...I could give your needs
personal attention.

562
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,871
I do thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

563
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,916
Well, then perhaps
you'd do me the honor...

564
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:36,796
...of accepting a small token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

565
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:44,804
King Richard would be deeply moved
to hear of your concern for my welfare.

566
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,681
Yes. Um...

567
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:50,393
I'm afraid the king has many enemies
both abroad and at home.

568
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,645
I fear for his safe return.

569
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,607
Oh, no, fear not, dear sheriff.
He will return.

570
00:53:55,774 --> 00:54:00,361
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

571
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:09,495
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one...

572
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,125
...because his answer vexed me
so grievously.

573
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,669
He said...

574
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:22,091
...he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

575
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,728
You lie.

576
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,279
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

577
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,415
You bastard! In there!

578
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:55,959
Get him!

579
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,383
Locksley!

580
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,387
I'm going to cut your heart out
with a spoon!

581
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,973
Then it begins.

582
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:29,826
- He's taking the sheriff's horse!
- He's stealing the sheriff's horse!

583
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,955
Close that gate!

584
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:39,043
The sheriff's horse! Close the gate!
He's stolen the sheriff's horse.

585
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,397
What are you looking at?!

586
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,002
Water!

587
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,838
- Thank you.
- For the animal.

588
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:27,925
How can I protect you, Christian,
if I know not where you go?

589
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,387
You've hardly raised a finger
when you do know...

590
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,347
...great one.

591
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,433
I prefer to have the choice.

592
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,852
Wonderful! You've stolen
the sheriff's horse?

593
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,980
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

594
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,816
- Are you afraid, John?
- Yeah, a little.

595
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:48,321
So is the sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

596
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:52,533
- You fool! You've started a war!
- We're already at war.

597
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,996
Bread.

598
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:01,667
And I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes...

599
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,212
...and would hunt our children.
- We?

600
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,673
You planning to join us then, matey?

601
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,676
No, to lead you.

602
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,599
Christian.

603
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,851
These are simple people.

604
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,145
They are not warriors.

605
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,357
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

606
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:28,861
You forget yourself, Azeem.
I do not ask for your company or council.

607
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,534
Why a spoon, cousin?
Why not an ax?

608
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:38,996
Because it's dull, you twit!
Lt'll hurt more!

609
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,542
I want this brigand found.

610
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,293
Starve them out!

611
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,380
Slaughter their...
No, take their livestock.

612
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:50,800
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

613
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:54,053
Perhaps we could create a name for him.

614
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,014
Something to drive fear into the hearts
of the populace.

615
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,393
- "Locksley the Lethal" or "Wreaking Robin."
- Whatever.

616
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:04,397
I want him dead by the next full moon,
before the barons come back.

617
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,691
Now sew!

618
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:11,445
And keep the stitches small.

619
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,175
He's not here, sir.

620
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,595
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

621
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,599
- He died last winter.
- Burn it down!

622
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,358
Leave us the sow. Her young
will feed us through winter.

623
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,446
- You heard of the Sherwood bandit?
- Robin of the Hood? Yes, sir.

624
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:56,782
Pray he is brought to us
before winter.

625
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,749
Over here!

626
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:10,588
Alfred! What's happened to you?

627
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,137
- Oh, John!
- Fanny!

628
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,349
- Will, they burned it, all of it.
- Are you all right?

629
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,852
Where is this Robin Hood?

630
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:26,729
He's there.

631
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,234
Look! Look what they've done!

632
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,823
If it's fame you seek, Christian...

633
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,868
...I think you have it.

634
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,665
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

635
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:50,044
- It's Nottingham trying to divide us.
- We are divided, rich boy.

636
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,255
I'm not blind as that old man
over there.

637
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,508
You're still trying to be lord of the manor.

638
00:59:55,676 --> 01:00:00,972
I heard today that the sheriff
now values your neck at 500 gold pieces.

639
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,600
I say we take him in.

640
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:10,856
Will, do you think the sheriff will give
everything back after I'm gone?

641
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,318
- He'll give us the reward and our pardons.
- Wrong!

642
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,323
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

643
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,742
What would you have us do?

644
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,247
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and our bare hands?

645
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,291
If needs be.

646
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,753
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you, Will.

647
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,214
Courage.

648
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,640
Look out!

649
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,073
Thank you, Wulf.

650
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,118
- You wish to end this?
- Yeah.

651
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,162
- You wish to go home?
- Aye.

652
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,082
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves...

653
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,127
...and face that the price for it
may be dear.

654
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,588
I, for one, would rather die...

655
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,215
...than spend my life in hiding.

656
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,760
The sheriff calls us outlaws.

657
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,637
But I say we are free.

658
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,390
And one free man defending his home...

659
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:30,144
...is more powerful than 10 hired soldiers.

660
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,774
The Crusades taught me that.

661
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,404
I will make you no promises save one.

662
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:46,160
That if you truly believe
in your hearts that you are free...

663
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:49,038
...then I say we can win.

664
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,415
They got armor!

665
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,626
They got armor, Bull?

666
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:56,962
Even this boy can be taught
to find the chinks in armor.

667
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,131
But we ain't got nothing to eat!

668
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:03,511
What do we need that the forest
cannot provide? We have food.

669
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,888
Wood for weapons.

670
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,224
We'll find safety and solace
in her trees.

671
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:14,271
Yeah, but what about our kin?
Sheriff's taken all they got too!

672
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,567
Then, by God, we take it back.

673
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,798
What's the meaning of this?

674
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:09,512
Milady. A woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations.

675
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,598
How dare you!

676
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,777
Please don't take that!
Don't take that!

677
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:30,282
- Please, sir! Those belong to our Lord.
- Now they belong to my lord sheriff!

678
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,297
Give it back.

679
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:47,716
Good.

680
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:53,556
Tell the sheriff for every harm he does these
people, I will visit it back on him tenfold.

681
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,775
Something vexes thee?

682
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,290
- What the devil?
- 'Tis a hot day, my friend...

683
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,792
...to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse.

684
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,086
The sheriff will hear of this!

685
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,259
I truly hope so.

686
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,228
There you go, love.
Buy yourself a new sow.

687
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:44,315
God bless you, Fanny.

688
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,066
And God bless Robin Hood!

689
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:55,034
We reckon he's nicked 3 to 4 million
in the last five months, sire.

690
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,203
All right then, fine.
Raise the bounty on his head.

691
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,039
Twenty-five thousand crowns.

692
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,877
Begging your pardon, it won't do no good
how much you raise it.

693
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:07,963
- Really, scribe, and why is that?
- Because, sire...

694
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,717
...the poor, you see.
He gives them what he takes.

695
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,970
So, well, sire, they love him.

696
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,225
Just a minute.

697
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,936
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket...

698
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,190
...forcing me to hurt the public...

699
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:29,068
...and they love him for it?

700
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,445
Yes.

701
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,406
That's it then!

702
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:37,117
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans.

703
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:40,120
No more merciful beheadings.

704
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:42,498
And call off Christmas!

705
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:45,793
The treasury is empty.

706
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,170
All day and all night
people plague my door...

707
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,924
...whining for tax relief and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

708
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,426
"We can't pay thee
what the highwayman's taken."

709
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,096
It's the shortest route to London, sire!

710
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,265
It's the only road to London,
you little ferret.

711
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,311
Sir Guy's patrols
have found nothing, sire?

712
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,980
No camp. Nothing!

713
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,945
This hooded viper
simply slithers into the forest.

714
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:17,616
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.
You, 10:45.

715
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,576
Bring a friend.

716
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,971
Tongue offends thee.

717
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:42,933
- Whose?
- One who writes all.

718
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:51,108
- That horrible little scribe, his tongue?
- Cut it out.

719
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,306
How many?

720
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:23,891
Twenty.

721
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,601
Twenty?!

722
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,145
How many?

723
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:30,189
Five.

724
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,650
- They can't count anyway.
- Come on.

725
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,903
Why scare them?

726
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,113
And they call me barbarian.

727
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,749
Friar!

728
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:52,503
You shall find it more difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet.

729
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,130
Yes, my lord.

730
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:01,845
- Shut up and help me move this log!
- This isn't a log, it's a tree!

731
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:04,097
Shut up! You're supposed to
be helping me!

732
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,016
I'm supposed to be meeting a girl!

733
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:16,777
You men in front, after me.
The rest stay with the wagon!

734
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,573
On to glory!

735
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,632
Bastards. Come on. Find them!

736
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,458
Go!

737
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,095
Welcome to Sherwood, friar!
Giddap!

738
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,498
Surrender your weapons!

739
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:57,711
Surrender your weapons,
and I give you my word you shall go free.

740
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,672
Don't do that!

741
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,051
What are you...?

742
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,528
I'll be buggered!

743
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:27,199
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

744
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:45,801
Good morning, my reverend friend.

745
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:49,638
You travel with poor company
when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers.

746
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,557
- Tax him!
- Tax him!

747
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,438
I'm Robin of Locksley.
And my men are thirsty.

748
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,608
- That's right.
- Robin Hood!

749
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:05,195
Lord bless me.

750
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:09,282
I mistook you for common thieves!

751
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,159
Kindly let me pass, sir.

752
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:17,749
Surely the Lord has the charity to spare
a few barrels for good Christian men. Yes?

753
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,128
We have much to celebrate.

754
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:25,507
Well, if you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew...

755
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,260
...you must best me for it!

756
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:37,269
Confess, Robin Hood,
that Friar Tuck is a braver...

757
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:41,273
...holier and wiser man than thou art!

758
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,293
He giveth and he taketh away.

759
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,550
Do you yield?

760
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:14,973
I'd rather roast in hell.

761
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,603
Shoot him! Shoot him!

762
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:38,080
I think the good friar's
taken us far enough.

763
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,124
Well done, friar.

764
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,961
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humility.

765
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,972
- Well, Tuck...
- Thanks for the beer.

766
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,934
...are these not the meek of the earth?

767
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,437
We're in need of an honest man
to minister to them.

768
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,940
What say you, friar?

769
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:12,322
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

770
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,368
- I accept.
- Good.

771
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,954
You will not regret it.

772
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,498
Aye, but you may!

773
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:55,490
We were ambushed, cousin.

774
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:04,499
Spanish steel. Much stronger
than our native blades.

775
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,628
Any losses?

776
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,672
Some.

777
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,887
In truth, all of them.

778
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:20,098
- And the gold?
- Taken.

779
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,435
Robin Hood?

780
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:26,980
They were woodsmen, cousin.

781
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,484
Robin Hood.

782
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,279
I tried.

783
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,657
- I tried.
- Cousin...

784
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:40,243
- I tried. I tried.
- Cousin...

785
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:42,120
...we must be strong.

786
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:45,790
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

787
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:49,252
And I can't allow a lieutenant...

788
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,755
...to fail me.

789
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:08,688
Well, at least I didn't use a spoon.

790
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:12,692
That's good steel.

791
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:27,499
- Take the one on the left.
- Which one's left?

792
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,670
- Which one you taking?
- What do you mean?

793
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:35,423
If you take the one on the left,
I'm taking the one on the right.

794
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,469
- Which one's the one on the right?
- The one next to the one on the...

795
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:42,430
Bollocks. We'll just jump out
and grab them.

796
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:44,808
- Now?
- Now!

797
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,521
Donation, if you please.

798
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:52,774
Donation? For what?

799
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:54,943
What?

800
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:59,197
- For passage through Sherwood.
- Very well.

801
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,242
Come and get it.

802
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,375
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us?

803
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,877
- It's me job, my lady.
- Job?

804
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,381
- And who is your employer?
- Robin Hood.

805
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,721
I insist on seeing him at once.

806
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,308
I'm trying to stop them!

807
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:31,062
- You cannot go down there!
- My lady, don't rush, you'II fall.

808
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,941
- He's not expecting you!
- My lady's intrusion is simply tit for tat.

809
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:37,402
- Out of the way, old traps!
- Don't "old traps" me!

810
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,404
I told you, you can't go down there!

811
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:50,248
- Ooh! Oh, I say.
- Cover your eyes.

812
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,418
My lady, don't!

813
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,305
You could've said!

814
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,935
Robin! You got visitors!

815
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,151
- It weren't my fault!
- Madam, you be careful there.

816
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,989
- It was Much!
- Careful you don't slip.

817
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,577
Hello.

818
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:32,123
What are you doing here?

819
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,171
Taking a lady's advice.

820
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,716
What happened to your eye, Bull?

821
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:44,010
- We was set upon by 10...
- Twelve!

822
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:47,138
- Fifteen large, big lads!
- Oh, yeah?

823
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,973
Yeah.

824
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,987
You've been busy.

825
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:06,199
- We have guests!
- Bring them down!

826
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,712
It works.

827
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,589
Kind of.

828
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,883
Of course it works.

829
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,387
Great shot!

830
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,265
Take your time, now.

831
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,273
That's good, Wulf.
But can you do it amidst distraction?

832
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,359
Can you make the shot when you must?

833
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,447
Show him, Wulf.

834
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,374
Can you?

835
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:00,044
- Well, go on, then.
- It was a dirty trick.

836
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:05,550
Aren't we all very serious?
Is his shirt coming off?

837
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,891
Fair's fair. Come on, chaps.
Fair's fair.

838
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,865
Well done. Well done.

839
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:34,245
This is grain, which any fool can eat...

840
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:39,626
...but for which the Lord intended
a more divine means of consumption.

841
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:44,130
Let us give praise to our maker
and glory to his bounty...

842
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:46,049
...by learning about...

843
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:48,051
...beer.

844
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,060
Did you bring me here to brag?

845
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,857
This is blood money, Marian.

846
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:06,402
It's intended to bribe King Richard's
enemies to unite against him.

847
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:10,031
We intercepted it.

848
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,368
- But who would...?
- Nottingham.

849
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:18,498
- He would not dare challenge the king.
- The king is not here to be challenged.

850
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,668
While he's away,
he may lose his country.

851
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,714
You thought...

852
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,301
You thought I was keeping it all,
didn't you?

853
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,804
Didn't you?

854
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,139
Well, here.

855
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,559
A contribution to your cause.

856
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,978
- Keep it.
- This dagger would fetch a great price.

857
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,647
- Keep it.
- It's not dear to me.

858
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,941
I mean, it is...
It's not.

859
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,528
I'm saying everything wrong.
I'll...

860
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,116
Cheers.

861
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,624
How do I get down?

862
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,297
Wait! Wait!

863
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,093
We don't go that way anymore.

864
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,761
I'm happy to hear that.

865
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,513
Grab on.

866
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,685
We have a rule here, you know.

867
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:24,814
Once someone has seen the way
to our camp, that person cannot leave.

868
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:27,775
There's too many lives at stake.

869
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,654
That's why Sarah and I
asked to be blindfolded.

870
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,615
Oh.

871
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,452
Well, perhaps you might join us
for dinner?

872
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:39,454
Perhaps.

873
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,515
Salaam, little one.

874
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:03,519
- Did God paint you?
- Did God paint me?

875
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,816
- For certain.
- Why?

876
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,779
Because...

877
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:15,406
...Allah loves wondrous variety.

878
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:22,705
You see, that is why
your hair is brown and your...

879
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:26,250
Keep thy heathen words
away from the ears of this innocent...

880
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,003
...or you'll answer to me.

881
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,756
You know nothing of our God.

882
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:37,553
Is not Allah the god
of Abraham...

883
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:38,763
...as is your God?

884
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:41,641
Don't trick me
with twists of the devil's tongue.

885
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:43,601
Come, child, come.

886
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:53,027
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman...

887
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:57,031
...has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth?

888
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:01,452
I've seen knights in armor panic
at the first hint of battle.

889
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:06,582
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body...

890
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,584
...to defend a dying horse.

891
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,630
Nobility's not a birthright.

892
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,758
It's defined by one's actions.

893
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,888
It's interesting to hear you say that.

894
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,807
I didn't.

895
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,684
My father did.

896
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,816
Did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him?

897
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,609
I don't know.

898
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:40,742
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

899
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,036
I was lost after my mother died.

900
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:48,166
My father too. And for a short time
he found comfort...

901
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,836
...in the arms of another woman.
A peasant woman.

902
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,758
I thought he was betraying
my mother's memory.

903
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:59,010
So he gave her up?

904
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:04,807
For the love of a 12-year-old boy
who would never forgive him.

905
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,440
Anyway, who...?

906
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,067
Who says I'm content?

907
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,237
I have my plans for the future.

908
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:24,494
- A grander scheme than this?
- No, a simpler one.

909
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:28,080
A home, family...

910
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:29,665
...love.

911
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,920
Men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

912
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:37,131
And when it doesn't,
'tis a burden to them.

913
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:40,968
Robin of the Hood, prince of thieves.

914
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,930
Is he capable of love?

915
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,394
Father!

916
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:53,397
Father!

917
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,692
It's Mother, she's dying!

918
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,203
Fanny.

919
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,831
Your baby has not turned.

920
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,501
It cannot be born without help.

921
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:18,256
He's the devil's seed sent to lead us astray.
Don't listen to him. He'll kill her!

922
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,591
If you do not listen to me...

923
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:23,594
...she will certainly die.
And the child.

924
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,433
The good friar's done all he can.

925
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:33,229
I suggest you let the Moor try.

926
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,278
- So be it.
- Then be it on your head! I warned you.

927
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:45,867
Marian. Get me a needle,
thread, water.

928
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,660
- And hurry.
- Yes.

929
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:50,288
Come with me. Come, John!

930
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,293
What are you going to do?

931
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:59,255
I've seen it many times...

932
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,090
...with horses.

933
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,927
With horses?

934
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,015
Bite down. Bite down, yes.

935
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,768
Help me, sadiq.

936
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,356
Give me your arms.

937
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,235
It will be all right.

938
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:33,331
I tell you, John,
the barbarian is killing her.

939
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:40,588
- No, Father!
- Out of the way, boy!

940
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:43,883
Quick, take him. Take him.

941
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:54,018
Ooh. What is it? Ooh, ooh.

942
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,361
Your son, milady.
There you are.

943
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:16,582
You truly are a great one.

944
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,711
My son!

945
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,967
Look at the lovely little baby.
Isn't he wonderful?

946
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,853
Today the Lord has taught me
a fine lesson.

947
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,691
That though I may think I am godly,
I know I am not worldly.

948
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:44,318
Please. Please.

949
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:53,119
Come, my barbarian friend, let's open
a barrel and try to save each other's souls.

950
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:58,124
- Alas, I am not permitted.
- Well, fine then. You talk, I'II drink.

951
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:09,593
- Milady!
- Sarah?

952
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,431
May I have this dance?

953
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,975
This lady is spoken for.

954
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,394
Why this way?

955
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:05,107
So you cannot find the way back
or be forced to tell others the way.

956
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:11,405
It was good to see you again, Marian.

957
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,241
It was good to be seen.

958
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,454
I have two favors to ask of you.

959
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:22,083
One.

960
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:26,295
Take Duncan with you. I fear for his health
with what may lie ahead.

961
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:30,216
Besides, I grow tired of his bellyaching.

962
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,510
You wish me to leave, Master Robin?

963
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,470
Old friend, listen to me.

964
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,182
Can you take Lady Marian safely home?

965
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,226
I fear for her safety.

966
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,895
- Of course, sire.
- Good.

967
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:45,022
Bull.

968
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,949
- And two?
- Yes, two.

969
01:30:57,911 --> 01:31:00,246
You're King Richard's cousin.

970
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:04,583
You can get word to him
of Nottingham's plan.

971
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,294
He would believe you.

972
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:11,382
If the sheriff found out,
I could lose all that I have.

973
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,052
That's true.

974
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:18,973
But will you do it for your king?

975
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:20,474
No.

976
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:25,980
I'll do it for you.

977
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,751
He fancies you, my lady.

978
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,883
I am blind, but some things
I can still see.

979
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:15,529
In 10 days' time, the barons are coming.

980
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,824
Robin Hood has stolen what I was to pay
for their allegiance.

981
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:23,537
And I am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations.

982
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,665
Tell me, Mortianna...

983
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,251
...am I thwarted?

984
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,360
Recruit the beasts that share our god.

985
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:58,113
Animals?

986
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:01,533
- From the North.
- You mean Celts.

987
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:04,161
They drink the blood of their dead.

988
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:06,830
Yoke their strength.

989
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:12,044
Hired thugs.

990
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:17,174
Brilliant.

991
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:24,473
Put thine own issue on the throne.

992
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,434
A child? How?

993
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:29,979
Ally with royal blood.

994
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,357
Who?

995
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:51,250
It's a personal matter, my lord.
But one of vital importance.

996
01:33:51,418 --> 01:33:54,044
I understand, my dear lady.

997
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,047
This is my most trusted emissary.

998
01:33:57,215 --> 01:34:01,719
You must travel to France immediately and
put that directly in the hands of the king.

999
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,221
My lady in waiting shall accompany you.

1000
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:08,559
My dear, I could not vouch
for her safety.

1001
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,644
The journey is fraught with danger.

1002
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:12,354
I appreciate your concern...

1003
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:15,733
...but Sarah's an accomplished rider,
and I insist she go along.

1004
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:18,736
As you wish.

1005
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:34,043
What is wrong?

1006
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:37,338
My horse is favoring his foreleg.

1007
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:27,679
What's this?

1008
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:35,229
- An appetizer.
- You promised us wagons of gold.

1009
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:40,150
Well, there are greater things than gold.

1010
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:44,905
More land and power
than you have ever dreamed of.

1011
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,200
When I rule this land...

1012
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:51,870
...it'll be divided between
just the seven of us in this room.

1013
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:54,706
You get Cornwall,
you can have Wales...

1014
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:57,000
...and Scotland is all yours.

1015
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,421
You recruit us to treason...

1016
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:03,632
...and yet you cannot even get gold
through your own forest.

1017
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:09,721
Why risk life and limb for a man who cannot
even snare the bandit who marked his face?

1018
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:12,141
Why, indeed?

1019
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,935
That's a good point, my lord.

1020
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:20,149
How can I control England
when I cannot even control my own county?

1021
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:24,445
I'm bringing in a little help.

1022
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,947
Audred!

1023
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,954
By God.

1024
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:36,874
You'd ally us with the Celts?

1025
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,085
What can these mercenaries do
that we cannot?

1026
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,993
Very impressive.

1027
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,412
All right, my lord sheriff...

1028
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:19,958
...but you must wed royal kin
before we act.

1029
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:22,794
Then your claim to the throne
will be...

1030
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:26,590
...legitimate.

1031
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:29,635
I'm as good as engaged.

1032
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:52,950
Duncan, is that you?

1033
01:37:56,955 --> 01:37:58,539
Hello?

1034
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:04,545
Rebecca?

1035
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:09,341
Ah! God!

1036
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:12,094
Nicodemus. Go.

1037
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:13,512
Find mice.

1038
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,806
- Ha-ha!
- Ah!

1039
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:21,019
I've never seen the breasts
of a noblewoman.

1040
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:37,160
- Pardon, my lady, we couldn't hold them!
- Someone wants a word with you.

1041
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,836
- No!
- That's it, sir. That's all of them.

1042
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:03,854
Easy.

1043
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:11,361
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.

1044
01:39:56,783 --> 01:40:00,494
Robin! The warning arrow!

1045
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,666
All is well! It's Duncan!

1046
01:40:08,086 --> 01:40:11,004
Duncan. Duncan.

1047
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:15,926
What happened?

1048
01:40:16,094 --> 01:40:18,595
I found you, Robin.
Thank God, I did it.

1049
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:22,516
- Nottingham's men attacked us.
- Marian?

1050
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,851
They took her.

1051
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:35,362
What is it?

1052
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:38,782
Over there! Look!

1053
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:41,159
On the hill!

1054
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:03,598
Celts! God help us!

1055
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:05,642
Allah, be merciful.

1056
01:41:06,144 --> 01:41:09,646
To the trees!
To the trees!

1057
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,899
Celts! They're coming!

1058
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:16,027
Poor old fool led them straight to us.

1059
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:19,406
Hide in the trees!

1060
01:41:20,867 --> 01:41:22,659
Get me prisoners.

1061
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:38,008
Children! Come to me!

1062
01:41:55,735 --> 01:41:57,611
Daddy!

1063
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:55,145
My God.

1064
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:10,201
Save us!

1065
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:25,383
Come! Hurry!

1066
01:44:26,886 --> 01:44:28,678
Save yourselves!

1067
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:35,101
We've gotta go, Robin!
We go now!

1068
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,607
Move!

1069
01:44:51,369 --> 01:44:53,995
This way, my lambs.
Come on!

1070
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:59,167
- Got you!
- Hold or I fire!

1071
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:05,882
It's gold! Gold!

1072
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:12,430
Fanny!

1073
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:16,643
Fanny!

1074
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:21,439
- John!
- Come on, girl!

1075
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:48,883
Fanny!

1076
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,094
Go! Save yourself, John!

1077
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:54,264
No, Fanny, I won't leave you!

1078
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:56,516
Go on, John!

1079
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,893
Never!

1080
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:01,521
Oh, God!

1081
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:14,200
- Okay.
- Oh, thank God.

1082
01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:20,498
- John, you'll have to catch her!
- Come on!

1083
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,550
I got you, girl!

1084
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:40,060
- Quick! Quick!
- Robin!

1085
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:50,195
- Come on!
- Come on!

1086
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,825
- Get over here!
- Go on!

1087
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:58,036
Come on!

1088
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,831
Don't wait for me!
John, go on!

1089
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:03,500
Hurry!

1090
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:32,737
Corpus Christi.

1091
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:34,364
Amen.

1092
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:54,050
My Lady Marian.

1093
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:58,805
By what right do you keep me prisoner?

1094
01:47:58,973 --> 01:48:02,016
You misunderstand my intentions.

1095
01:48:02,184 --> 01:48:04,519
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1096
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:10,525
- Protection from whom?
- From yourself.

1097
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:14,946
It seems that you've been
consorting with outlaws.

1098
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:19,868
Where do you hear such lies?

1099
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:23,329
By your own hand, my lady.

1100
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:30,920
I'm sorry, my child.

1101
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:34,799
I feared you were being led astray.

1102
01:48:37,595 --> 01:48:39,179
Come.

1103
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,190
It's over.

1104
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:54,527
Today I return justice to this land.

1105
01:48:55,779 --> 01:49:00,074
I shall have to hang the ringleaders,
of course, but I would like to be generous...

1106
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:04,454
...and give you the lives of the woodsmen
and their families.

1107
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:06,664
The children!

1108
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,459
And, of course...

1109
01:49:09,627 --> 01:49:13,379
...of your traitorous lady in waiting.
- Get in there!

1110
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:17,926
As a wedding gift.

1111
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:26,142
And just who am I supposed to marry?

1112
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:34,609
Search your heart, my child.

1113
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:38,071
Why not a union
with the house of Nottingham...

1114
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,698
...and heal the wounds in our land?

1115
01:49:40,866 --> 01:49:44,077
There is only one man who can heal
the wounds of this land.

1116
01:49:44,245 --> 01:49:46,079
Robin Hood.

1117
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,760
I'm truly sorry, my lady.

1118
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:04,889
He wasted his life.
How many more lives would you waste?

1119
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,944
What a beautiful child.

1120
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:23,825
So young.

1121
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:30,206
So alive, so unaware
of how precarious life can be.

1122
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:39,799
I had a very sad childhood.
I'll tell you about it sometime.

1123
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:44,345
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1124
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:57,692
Our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies.

1125
01:50:58,235 --> 01:51:00,111
You understand...

1126
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:05,074
...I cannot allow them
to grow up as my enemies.

1127
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:09,662
I have no choice.

1128
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:13,082
That's true.

1129
01:51:52,748 --> 01:51:54,374
Look!

1130
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:01,464
Christian.

1131
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:27,698
Leave him be!

1132
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,501
Sorry to keep you hanging about.

1133
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:47,176
Would you prefer pain
or death?

1134
01:52:48,345 --> 01:52:49,971
Death.

1135
01:52:50,139 --> 01:52:52,181
Torture him.

1136
01:52:53,267 --> 01:52:57,145
What about you?
Pain or death?

1137
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:58,855
Pain.

1138
01:52:59,022 --> 01:53:01,441
Torture him. You see?

1139
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:04,610
- It makes no difference.
- Spare me.

1140
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:10,491
Will you keep the noise down, please?!

1141
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:16,164
Now, I have heard that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1142
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:21,043
Either tell me where he may be hiding...

1143
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:24,755
...or you'll all be hanged, and we'll
catch him anyway and do the same to him.

1144
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:27,383
- I'd love to kill him for you.
- Will, no!

1145
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:34,474
So he is alive, then?

1146
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:36,601
I'm not really sure.

1147
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,729
Then why would I need you?

1148
01:53:40,564 --> 01:53:44,650
Because, my lord, if he is alive
I can get close to him.

1149
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:47,361
I'm one of his men.
He would never suspect me.

1150
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:50,114
- He knows you always hated him, traitor!
- Shut up!

1151
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:54,577
He's a trusting fool.
And if he doesn't believe me, he'll kill me...

1152
01:53:54,745 --> 01:53:57,246
...then you've lost nothing.

1153
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:01,626
If you fail...

1154
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:06,756
...I will personally remove
your lying tongue.

1155
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,427
And if I succeed...

1156
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:15,348
...I want my freedom
and the bounty on his head.

1157
01:54:15,516 --> 01:54:17,767
The lash, I think.

1158
01:54:17,935 --> 01:54:21,103
Sorry about that.
It'll make it more convincing.

1159
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:57,848
- My pride brought us to this.
- No, sadiq.

1160
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:02,103
It was you who gave pride
to these people.

1161
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:05,815
I was a fool.

1162
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:09,819
I was a fool to let him leave...

1163
01:55:10,404 --> 01:55:13,573
...to believe I planned it all so perfectly.

1164
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:19,161
I once heard a wise man say:

1165
01:55:20,414 --> 01:55:23,666
There are no perfect men
in this world...

1166
01:55:24,543 --> 01:55:26,127
...only perfect intentions.

1167
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:34,760
You were an honor
to your countrymen today, Azeem.

1168
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:40,266
You fought better
than 20 English knights.

1169
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,297
Will!

1170
01:56:12,257 --> 01:56:15,509
- I thought you were taken.
- I was.

1171
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:17,386
How did you escape?

1172
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:19,096
Traitor!

1173
01:56:19,264 --> 01:56:21,682
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1174
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:23,309
You get in there!
Get in there!

1175
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:27,521
Nobody escapes the sheriff,
not unless he's lining his pockets.

1176
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:29,607
Where are the others?

1177
01:56:29,775 --> 01:56:32,360
- Where's my son?!
- He'll have his blade in your side!

1178
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:35,821
I'll have your guts for garters,
you little toad!

1179
01:56:39,951 --> 01:56:41,911
- Bugger me!
- God!

1180
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:44,246
Let him speak.

1181
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,918
I bring a message...

1182
01:56:49,878 --> 01:56:51,921
...from Nottingham.

1183
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:55,466
Our men are to be hung
in the square at high noon tomorrow.

1184
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:57,843
And what about my boy?

1185
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,554
The boy too. Ten men in all.

1186
01:57:02,015 --> 01:57:06,852
The hangings are to be part
of the celebration for the sheriff's marriage.

1187
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,355
Marriage? To who?

1188
01:57:10,691 --> 01:57:12,692
Lady Marian.

1189
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:15,444
He takes a bride of royal blood.

1190
01:57:17,364 --> 01:57:19,156
And with King Richard gone...

1191
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:21,826
...he'll be after the bloody throne.

1192
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:26,789
You were to use this news to get
close to me and then kill me, right, Will?

1193
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:33,379
- What are your intentions?
- That depends on you, Locksley.

1194
01:57:34,548 --> 01:57:37,508
I've never trusted you,
that's no secret.

1195
01:57:37,676 --> 01:57:40,136
What I wanna know is,
are you gonna finish what you started?

1196
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:44,890
I want to know if he's gonna run like
the spoiled rich boy I always took him for.

1197
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:51,147
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlett?

1198
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:55,860
Where does this intolerable hatred for me
come from?

1199
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:08,914
From knowing...

1200
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:12,334
...that our father loved you
more than me.

1201
01:58:14,379 --> 01:58:16,213
Our father?

1202
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:18,924
We are brothers, Robin of Locksley.

1203
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:23,763
I am the son of the woman who replaced
your dead mother for a time!

1204
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:26,015
- Your anger drove them apart!
- It's a lie!

1205
01:58:26,183 --> 01:58:29,435
It's not a lie!
You ruined my life!

1206
01:58:42,032 --> 01:58:46,118
I have more reason to hate you
than anyone.

1207
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:49,747
But I found myself daring
to believe in you.

1208
01:58:50,457 --> 01:58:52,041
What I wanna know, brother...

1209
01:58:52,626 --> 01:58:56,295
...is will you stay with us
and finish what you've started?

1210
01:59:01,593 --> 01:59:03,928
I have a brother?

1211
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:09,433
I have a brother.

1212
01:59:12,938 --> 01:59:15,356
I will make my stand with you.

1213
01:59:15,524 --> 01:59:17,650
Side by side.

1214
01:59:17,818 --> 01:59:19,401
To the end.

1215
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:24,073
To the end!

1216
01:59:25,909 --> 01:59:28,077
We're all bloody in.

1217
01:59:28,245 --> 01:59:29,703
Daft buggers.

1218
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:35,668
We finish this.

1219
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:07,157
Overwhelmed with happiness,
thank you for asking.

1220
02:00:07,325 --> 02:00:10,411
Yes, all is well.
I got all my money back...

1221
02:00:10,579 --> 02:00:16,292
...Robin Hood's probably dead,
and I'm gonna be king, all as predicted.

1222
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:22,298
Now, I want you to tell the hangman...

1223
02:00:22,465 --> 02:00:25,676
...I don't want to see
any broken necks in the morning.

1224
02:00:25,844 --> 02:00:30,347
I wanna see some dancing!

1225
02:00:31,725 --> 02:00:34,894
Don't touch that!

1226
02:00:35,353 --> 02:00:38,230
I can do that myself.

1227
02:00:39,524 --> 02:00:43,152
Thank you very much.

1228
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:28,447
Have you been spying on me,
you little insect?

1229
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:36,038
Well, who else would have made a...?

1230
02:01:54,057 --> 02:01:56,517
Where are you?

1231
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:04,358
You come early.
The signs have not aligned yet.

1232
02:02:04,776 --> 02:02:07,778
And you can stop all that,
you old fake!

1233
02:02:08,655 --> 02:02:11,407
I will try for thee anyway.

1234
02:02:16,413 --> 02:02:20,124
The union. The blood of the lion
and the house of Nottingham...

1235
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:22,418
...new power, new soul.

1236
02:02:22,585 --> 02:02:25,337
I found the hole!

1237
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:28,674
You dare to spy on me?

1238
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:31,760
I want the truth.

1239
02:02:33,013 --> 02:02:34,596
Why?

1240
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:37,891
Truth has never served you before.

1241
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:42,271
Truth didn't put Nottingham
where he is today.

1242
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:43,439
Mortianna did.

1243
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:47,443
You freakish imp, I despise you.

1244
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,486
After the wedding,
you're on the streets.

1245
02:02:49,654 --> 02:02:52,072
The people will rip out
your heart and burn it!

1246
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:55,868
Without me, you're nothing.

1247
02:02:57,287 --> 02:03:01,040
You're straw. A fleabite.
A speck.

1248
02:03:03,168 --> 02:03:06,003
I birthed you from this body.

1249
02:03:06,171 --> 02:03:08,964
I stole a babe in this very castle
and killed it...

1250
02:03:09,132 --> 02:03:13,135
...so that you might rise in its place.

1251
02:03:14,929 --> 02:03:17,097
You're my son.

1252
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:22,811
You despise me?

1253
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:26,815
You are me.

1254
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:29,693
You know, from your empty soul,
that is the truth.

1255
02:03:31,362 --> 02:03:36,283
All my life, I've been a freak.

1256
02:03:36,451 --> 02:03:40,162
But when you stud the Lady Marian...

1257
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:43,957
...my grandchild takes the throne.
My blood.

1258
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:49,213
This twisted seed will rule through him.

1259
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:52,841
We'll see who's freakish then.

1260
02:04:27,627 --> 02:04:30,212
- Damn!
- What was that?

1261
02:04:30,964 --> 02:04:33,048
Truly, you are a wizard.

1262
02:04:33,216 --> 02:04:35,843
The mystery is in the black powder.

1263
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:38,720
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.

1264
02:04:40,098 --> 02:04:41,557
- Bull?
- Yeah.

1265
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:44,434
Position by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1266
02:04:44,602 --> 02:04:47,729
John, you sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1267
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:50,649
I will conceal myself here,
below the scaffold...

1268
02:04:50,817 --> 02:04:53,944
...to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1269
02:04:54,112 --> 02:04:56,446
I'll do that. You have to cover us
with your bow.

1270
02:04:56,614 --> 02:04:58,407
It's too dangerous, Will.

1271
02:04:58,575 --> 02:05:00,284
So is your aim.

1272
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:05,914
Whatever Azeem is concocting,
we must each be in place for it.

1273
02:05:06,082 --> 02:05:09,293
Now, our success depends
on total concert.

1274
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:12,379
- We may be only six men...
- Seven.

1275
02:05:12,547 --> 02:05:14,548
What are you doing?
Where's the little ones?

1276
02:05:14,716 --> 02:05:16,425
Safe with my mother.

1277
02:05:16,593 --> 02:05:18,760
You gone bleeding cracked?
You'd get hurt.

1278
02:05:18,970 --> 02:05:22,181
I've had eight babies.
Don't talk to me about getting hurt.

1279
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:25,350
I'm not just gonna sit here
and let one of them die.

1280
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:28,937
You should be bloody well minding
the other seven.

1281
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:31,023
Tell her, Rob.

1282
02:05:34,986 --> 02:05:36,778
Fanny...

1283
02:05:36,946 --> 02:05:39,531
...you will take position here.

1284
02:05:52,462 --> 02:06:00,969
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1285
02:06:01,304 --> 02:06:04,765
No blades, no bows.
No blades.

1286
02:06:05,391 --> 02:06:07,309
What have you got there, Father?

1287
02:06:07,477 --> 02:06:11,730
The Lord's finest brew
for the good sheriff's fighting men.

1288
02:06:11,898 --> 02:06:14,483
It has a mighty kick.

1289
02:06:18,154 --> 02:06:20,405
No blades, no bows.

1290
02:06:31,876 --> 02:06:34,419
- Don't anger him.
- He is a Celt.

1291
02:06:38,841 --> 02:06:42,511
Psst. John. John!

1292
02:07:15,086 --> 02:07:16,670
Hey, you.

1293
02:07:17,714 --> 02:07:21,008
- Do I know you?
- Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1294
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:23,051
Oh, my God, you stink.

1295
02:07:23,219 --> 02:07:27,889
- Pardon my blindness. I'm always falling...
- Get out of here!

1296
02:07:28,516 --> 02:07:32,394
- Thank you, sir.
- Careful, friar.

1297
02:07:34,772 --> 02:07:36,398
What are you doing?

1298
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:40,986
Distributing libations for the celebration
of the sheriff's nuptials.

1299
02:07:41,154 --> 02:07:44,740
- Why, is something amiss?
- Yeah, you are. Get this out of here!

1300
02:07:44,907 --> 02:07:49,077
Caesar has spoken, my leprous friend.
We shall collect our offerings and depart.

1301
02:07:49,245 --> 02:07:53,582
- Is this your finger?
- Leper, what? Get this cart out of here!

1302
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:57,502
Leaving bits and pieces of himself
all over England.

1303
02:08:05,595 --> 02:08:07,346
What are you doing here?

1304
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:10,515
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging, I do.

1305
02:08:10,683 --> 02:08:14,227
- What's in this bundle?
- That's firewood.

1306
02:08:18,608 --> 02:08:19,941
Hello, my lover.

1307
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:30,285
Make way for the Lord's work!
Make way, do you hear?

1308
02:08:30,453 --> 02:08:31,787
Make way for the Lord's work!

1309
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:35,624
A benediction for these poor bastards
who are about to stretch.

1310
02:08:36,292 --> 02:08:38,668
God, receive them in thy mercy...

1311
02:08:38,836 --> 02:08:42,547
...and show them the love
that they do so richly deserve.

1312
02:08:44,842 --> 02:08:48,136
Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.

1313
02:09:07,824 --> 02:09:11,284
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1314
02:09:12,245 --> 02:09:15,288
No more than your wedding present.

1315
02:09:18,584 --> 02:09:20,502
Bring them out!

1316
02:09:31,472 --> 02:09:33,932
Get your hands off me, you dog.

1317
02:09:54,162 --> 02:09:59,040
And suffer knowing the lord
and his ministers are watching over you.

1318
02:10:42,001 --> 02:10:43,710
Make way!

1319
02:10:56,057 --> 02:10:57,933
Traitor! Traitor!

1320
02:11:07,318 --> 02:11:09,319
What's going on?

1321
02:11:11,364 --> 02:11:12,822
Bring him here!

1322
02:11:14,283 --> 02:11:16,910
- I'll kill you!
- What do I do?

1323
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:27,796
Oh, the turncoat.

1324
02:11:27,964 --> 02:11:29,923
Did you succeed?

1325
02:11:30,091 --> 02:11:33,468
Well, I found his lair...

1326
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:37,097
...but he was already dead.

1327
02:11:37,265 --> 02:11:40,475
You sure?
You saw Hood's body?

1328
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:43,103
No.

1329
02:11:43,271 --> 02:11:45,814
I saw a grave.

1330
02:11:46,148 --> 02:11:48,233
We found this on him.

1331
02:11:52,154 --> 02:11:54,406
String him up with the others.

1332
02:11:58,578 --> 02:12:00,161
Put me down! Let go!

1333
02:12:04,667 --> 02:12:05,667
Let me go!

1334
02:12:10,756 --> 02:12:13,466
- Leave him! He's only a boy.
- Shut up!

1335
02:12:14,468 --> 02:12:17,762
Bastard!
You all right?

1336
02:12:18,681 --> 02:12:20,348
Now, Robin?

1337
02:12:35,656 --> 02:12:38,825
My lord, it appears there's no more room!

1338
02:12:39,368 --> 02:12:42,996
- I'm afraid I'll have to respectfully decline!
- Come on, you. Down!

1339
02:12:44,123 --> 02:12:45,165
Down.

1340
02:12:47,752 --> 02:12:50,128
Come on, move it. Hold your tongue!

1341
02:12:52,882 --> 02:12:56,134
There's always room for one more.

1342
02:13:29,543 --> 02:13:31,252
- No!
- That's my son!

1343
02:13:32,672 --> 02:13:34,506
I'm coming, Wulf!

1344
02:13:34,674 --> 02:13:36,174
My boy!

1345
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:11,459
- Locksley.
- Robin!

1346
02:14:42,366 --> 02:14:44,993
Get some troops in here!

1347
02:14:54,503 --> 02:14:57,172
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!

1348
02:15:09,268 --> 02:15:10,560
Help!

1349
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:48,890
- Wulf!
- Father!

1350
02:15:50,059 --> 02:15:51,226
Oh, thank God.

1351
02:15:53,479 --> 02:15:56,231
Come on, you milksops!

1352
02:15:56,398 --> 02:15:58,691
- Fight your way free.
- Look out!

1353
02:16:05,699 --> 02:16:07,200
This way! To the wall!

1354
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:11,746
My lord sheriff,
is this your idea of control?!

1355
02:16:13,249 --> 02:16:15,416
Shut up, you twit.

1356
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:18,169
- Come with me.
- Robin!

1357
02:16:20,506 --> 02:16:21,089
Marian.

1358
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:24,342
Marian!

1359
02:16:24,969 --> 02:16:26,845
English!

1360
02:16:27,012 --> 02:16:28,596
English!

1361
02:16:28,931 --> 02:16:32,934
Behold Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir!

1362
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:35,270
I am not one of you...

1363
02:16:35,437 --> 02:16:37,272
...but I fight!

1364
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,233
I fight with Robin Hood!

1365
02:16:40,401 --> 02:16:43,945
I fight against a tyrant
who holds you under his boot!

1366
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:46,656
If you would be free men...

1367
02:16:46,824 --> 02:16:51,286
...then you must fight!
Join us now!

1368
02:16:52,121 --> 02:16:54,622
- Join Robin Hood!
- Freedom!

1369
02:16:59,837 --> 02:17:01,045
Come on!

1370
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:23,192
- Marian!
- Oh! Robin!

1371
02:17:29,158 --> 02:17:30,825
John!

1372
02:17:32,661 --> 02:17:35,163
- Close the gate!
- No!

1373
02:17:35,331 --> 02:17:37,498
Guard it with your life!

1374
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:40,418
Bring the bishop to my chapel!

1375
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:43,713
Right there.

1376
02:17:44,965 --> 02:17:47,175
That's good, John. That's good.

1377
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:53,056
Is she worth it?

1378
02:17:53,223 --> 02:17:55,308
Worth dying for?

1379
02:18:00,606 --> 02:18:02,148
Will!

1380
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:13,117
Fuck me, he cleared it!

1381
02:18:17,915 --> 02:18:19,707
Marian!

1382
02:18:46,402 --> 02:18:48,736
We're doomed.

1383
02:18:53,283 --> 02:18:57,370
- 'Tis rebellion, my lord. We must escape.
- Marry us!

1384
02:18:57,997 --> 02:19:00,415
I will never marry you!

1385
02:19:02,626 --> 02:19:05,753
That's my wife, crone!

1386
02:19:06,672 --> 02:19:08,256
Get away!

1387
02:19:08,424 --> 02:19:11,384
She's ripe. She will give us a son.

1388
02:19:11,552 --> 02:19:13,219
You must take her now.

1389
02:19:13,387 --> 02:19:18,266
I will not take her
until we are properly wed!

1390
02:19:18,642 --> 02:19:23,938
For once in my life, I will have
something pure! Will you stop interfering?

1391
02:19:24,106 --> 02:19:26,607
'Tis madness to delay.

1392
02:19:28,444 --> 02:19:31,404
Marry them or face me!

1393
02:19:41,623 --> 02:19:50,131
Marian!

1394
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:54,677
Where is she?

1395
02:19:58,807 --> 02:20:02,560
- The Lady Marian?
- Up the stairs, that way!

1396
02:20:05,647 --> 02:20:07,482
Marian?

1397
02:20:08,776 --> 02:20:10,485
Marian!

1398
02:20:10,819 --> 02:20:12,111
Robin!

1399
02:20:12,279 --> 02:20:15,323
- Get on with it!
- Robin!

1400
02:20:18,911 --> 02:20:20,453
Statue.

1401
02:20:22,331 --> 02:20:25,833
Do you, George,
Sheriff of Nottingham...

1402
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:27,960
...take this woman to be your wife?

1403
02:20:36,678 --> 02:20:37,678
To have and to hold...

1404
02:20:39,264 --> 02:20:42,517
...in sickness and in health,
for better or worse, richer...

1405
02:20:42,684 --> 02:20:45,686
- Yes, yes! Come on!
- Make haste!

1406
02:20:45,854 --> 02:20:51,317
And do you, Marian of the house of Dubois,
take this man to be your husband?

1407
02:20:51,485 --> 02:20:53,694
Yes, of course she does.

1408
02:20:59,159 --> 02:21:00,535
Marian!

1409
02:21:00,702 --> 02:21:02,286
Damned English oak!

1410
02:21:02,454 --> 02:21:04,539
- Robin! Robin!
- Marian!

1411
02:21:04,706 --> 02:21:06,541
I'll try another way.

1412
02:21:18,512 --> 02:21:20,138
What do you want?

1413
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:28,312
I can't do this with all that racket!

1414
02:21:31,191 --> 02:21:34,485
How could you?
How could you?

1415
02:21:50,377 --> 02:21:53,212
- The painted man!
- The witch!

1416
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:57,175
I didn't know. I didn't know it was you.
Please, sire, have pity.

1417
02:21:57,342 --> 02:22:00,094
Don't harm an old woman.

1418
02:22:18,614 --> 02:22:23,451
You may take this body, but it will not
be me! It will not be me!

1419
02:22:24,286 --> 02:22:26,245
Not again!

1420
02:22:27,623 --> 02:22:31,125
I now pronounce you man and wife,
in the name of the Father...

1421
02:22:31,293 --> 02:22:34,462
...the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1422
02:22:42,471 --> 02:22:44,263
Robin.

1423
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:50,144
Do you mind, Locksley?

1424
02:22:51,146 --> 02:22:53,814
We've just been married.

1425
02:23:05,661 --> 02:23:07,703
Recognize this?

1426
02:23:09,498 --> 02:23:12,500
It belonged to your father.

1427
02:23:13,043 --> 02:23:17,296
Appropriate, don't you think,
that I now use it to send you to meet him?

1428
02:23:19,299 --> 02:23:22,218
I shall never fear my father's sword.

1429
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:24,303
Really?

1430
02:23:27,683 --> 02:23:29,892
Now we're even.

1431
02:23:42,114 --> 02:23:43,364
Robin!

1432
02:23:59,464 --> 02:24:02,967
If I must, I will take you
a piece at a time.

1433
02:24:06,138 --> 02:24:08,139
I'll do the only taking today.

1434
02:24:20,152 --> 02:24:23,321
You sold your soul to Satan, your grace.

1435
02:24:24,781 --> 02:24:29,618
You accused innocent men of witchcraft
and let them die.

1436
02:24:29,786 --> 02:24:35,541
Brother friar, you would not strike
a fellow man of the cloth.

1437
02:24:35,709 --> 02:24:38,711
No. No, I wouldn't.

1438
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:42,214
In fact, I'll help you pack
for your journey.

1439
02:24:42,382 --> 02:24:45,593
You're going to need lots of gold
to help you on your way.

1440
02:24:45,761 --> 02:24:49,430
You're a very rich man.
This too.

1441
02:24:49,598 --> 02:24:51,390
Enough!

1442
02:24:51,558 --> 02:24:54,101
Here's 30 pieces of silver...

1443
02:24:54,269 --> 02:24:57,271
...to pay the devil on your way to hell!

1444
02:25:50,992 --> 02:25:52,660
Robin!

1445
02:26:05,632 --> 02:26:07,716
Get ready.

1446
02:26:08,093 --> 02:26:09,427
No!

1447
02:27:37,974 --> 02:27:40,392
I have fulfilled my vow, sadiq.

1448
02:27:58,328 --> 02:28:00,538
You came for me.

1449
02:28:01,456 --> 02:28:03,707
You're alive.

1450
02:28:03,875 --> 02:28:06,293
I would die for you.

1451
02:28:14,219 --> 02:28:18,013
By the power vested in me
by God's holy church...

1452
02:28:18,181 --> 02:28:22,893
...I say any man who has reason
why these two should not be joined...

1453
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:25,271
...let him speak now...

1454
02:28:25,438 --> 02:28:28,065
...or forever hold his peace.

1455
02:28:31,570 --> 02:28:34,154
- Then I now pronounce you...
- Hold!

1456
02:28:34,322 --> 02:28:35,990
I speak.

1457
02:28:45,625 --> 02:28:48,794
- Richard!
- It's the king.

1458
02:28:57,721 --> 02:29:00,472
- I will not allow this wedding to proceed.
- My lord...

1459
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:02,349
Unless...

1460
02:29:02,934 --> 02:29:05,185
...l'm allowed to give the bride away.

1461
02:29:05,353 --> 02:29:07,771
You look radiant, cousin.

1462
02:29:10,650 --> 02:29:12,985
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.

1463
02:29:13,153 --> 02:29:16,488
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.

1464
02:29:16,656 --> 02:29:19,366
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.

1465
02:29:19,826 --> 02:29:21,660
Friar, proceed.

1466
02:29:29,169 --> 02:29:32,004
Husband and wife.

1467
02:29:33,173 --> 02:29:34,715
You may kiss the bride.

1468
02:29:34,883 --> 02:29:36,634
I know that.

1469
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:03,994
Now, get out of it.

1470
02:30:04,162 --> 02:30:06,914
We waste good celebration time.
