1
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,276
Oh I come from a land From a faraway place

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,738
 Where the caravan camels roam

3
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,450
Where it's flat and immense And the heat is intense

4
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:37,203
It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!

5
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,373
 When the wind's from the east and the sun's from the west

6
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,501
And the sand in the glass is right

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,171
Come on down, dance, Stop on by

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,881
Hop a carpet and fly

9
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:52,844
To another Arabian night!

10
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,222
Arabian nights

11
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:00,185
Like Arabian days

12
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,228
More often than not

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,400
Are hotter than hot In a lot of good ways

14
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:14,991
Arabian nights 'neath Arabian moons

15
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,162
A fool off his guard Could fall and fall hard 

16
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:24,084
Out there on the dunes.

17
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:31,007
Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend.

18
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,177
Please, please, come closer--

19
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,346
Too close, a little too close.

20
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,473
There.

21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:42,519
Welcome to Agrabah, City of mystery,

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:48,775
of enchantment, and the finest merchandise  this side 
of the river Jordan,on sale today, come on down!

23
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,443
Look at this! Yes!

24
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,070
Combination hookah and coffee maker--

25
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,948
also makes Julienne fries

26
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,950
Will not break

27
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,952
It broke.

28
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,287
Look at this!

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,959
I have never seen one of these intact before.
This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware

30
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,462
Listen.
Ah, still good.

31
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,464
Wait, don't go!

32
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,260
I can see that you're only interested 
 in the exceptionally rare.

33
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,763
I think then, you would be most rewarded to consider...

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,765
...this

35
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,351
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance.

36
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:29,024
Like so many things, it is not what is outside,
 but what is inside that counts.

37
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,942
This is no ordinary lamp!

38
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,945
It once changed the course of a young man's life.

39
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,991
A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he seemed.

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,452
 A diamond in the rough.

41
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,455
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale? 

42
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,500
It begins on a dark night

43
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:53,882
where a dark man waits, with a dark purpose.

44
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,140
You...are late.

45
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,851
A thousand apologies, O patient one.

46
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,144
You have it, then?

47
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,190
I had to slit a few throats but I got it!

48
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,986
Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure!

49
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,867
Trust me, my pungent friend.

50
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,913
You'll get what's coming to you. 
(What's coming to you!)

51
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,507
Quickly, follow the trail!

52
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,389
Faster!

53
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,993
At last, after all my years of searching,

54
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,415
the cave of wonders! 
(Cave of wonders!)

55
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,459
By Allah!

56
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,505
Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.

57
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:20,593
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!

58
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,770
Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?

59
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,163
Who disturbs my slumber?

60
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,960
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

61
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,965
Know this.  Only one may enter here.

62
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,054
One whose worth lies far within.  A diamond in the rough.

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,143
What are you waiting for?  Go on!

64
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:33,750
Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough.

65
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,967
I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it.

66
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,930
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!

67
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,431
Just forget it.

68
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,477
Look at this.  Look at this.  I'm so ticked off that I'm molting!

69
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,314
Patience, Iago.  Patience.

70
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,110
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

71
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,904
Oh, there's a big surprise.

72
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,950
That's an incred--
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from not surprise!

73
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:11,121
What're we gonna do?  We got a big problem here,a big--

74
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:15,166
Yes.  Only one may enter.

75
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,964
I must find this one, this...diamond in the rough.

76
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,301
Stop, thief!

77
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,264
I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat!

78
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:34,144
All this for a loaf of bread?

79
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,156
There he is!
-You won't get away so easy!

80
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,909
You think that was easy?

81
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,913
You two, over that way, and you, follow me.  We'll find him.

82
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,123
Morning, ladies.

83
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:59,127
Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we Aladdin?

84
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,129
Trouble?  No way.

85
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,630
You're only in trouble if you get caught--

86
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,298
Gotcha!

87
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,424
I'm in trouble!

88
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,719
...and this time--

89
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,805
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual! 
-Hello!

90
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,932
Come on, let's get outta here!

91
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,934
Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline

92
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,437
One swing ahead of the sword

93
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,399
I steal only what I can't afford.
That's everything!

94
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,901
One jump ahead of the lawmen

95
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:28,281
That's all, and that's no joke,
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke!

96
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,911
Riffraff! Street rat!Scoundrel! Take that!

97
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,498
Just a little snack, guys! 

98
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,543
Rip him open, take it back guys!

99
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,130
I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
You're my only friend, Abu!
-Who?!?

100
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,176
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

101
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,805
He's become a one-man rise in crime

102
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,850
I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!

103
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,563
Gotta eat to live,gotta steal to eat, 
Tell you all about it when I got the time!

104
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,234
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom

105
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,613
Next time gonna use a nom de plume.
-There he is!

106
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,908
One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock

107
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,912
I think I'll take a stroll around the block.

108
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,832
Stop, thief! Vandal! Outrage! Scandal!

109
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,877
Let's not be too hasty

110
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,841
Still I think he's rather tasty

111
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,928
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat,
 Otherwise we'd get along! 
-WRONG!

112
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,858
He's got a sword!

113
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,903
You idiots--
we've ALL got swords!!

114
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,870
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!
-Vandal!

115
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,872
One hop ahead of the hump!
-Street rat!

116
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,665
One trick ahead of disaster!
-Scoundrel!

117
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,292
They're quick--but I'm much faster 
-Take that!

118
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,754
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin',all I gotta do is...

119
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,799
jump!

120
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,432
SNIÅ½ENO GNOJIVO

121
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,523
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!

122
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:54,886
Here, go on--take it.

123
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,828
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

124
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,873
Another suitor for the princess.

125
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,337
Out of my way, you filthy brat!

126
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,383
Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners

127
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,887
Oh--I teach you some manners!

128
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,478
Look at that, Abu. 
 It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends!

129
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,733
You are a worthless street rat.

130
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,778
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat,

131
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,866
and only your fleas will mourn you.

132
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,456
I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.

133
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,087
Come on, Abu.  Let's go home.

134
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:22,015
Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy that.

135
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:26,061
If only they'd look closer

136
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:32,067
Would they see a poor boy?  No siree.

137
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:44,788
They'd find out, there's so much more to me.

138
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:54,339
Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.

139
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,385
We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.

140
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,850
I've never been so insulted!

141
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,437
Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are you?

142
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,815
Good luck marrying her off!

143
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,860
Oh, Jasmine!  

144
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,865
Jasmine! 
Jasmine!  

145
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,870
Confound it, Rajah!

146
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,292
So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out!

147
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,797
Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him, weren't you Rajah.

148
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,843
You were just playing with that overdressed, 
self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?

149
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:48,852
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call.

150
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,772
The law says you...
...must be married to a prince...

151
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,774
...By your next birthday.

152
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,276
The law is wrong.

153
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,237
You've only got three more days!

154
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,907
Father,  I hate being forced into this.

155
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,703
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

156
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,749
Jasmine, it's not only this law. 

157
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,713
I'm not going to be around forever,...and I...

158
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,844
I just want to make sure you're taken care of, provided for.

159
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,849
Please, try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my own.

160
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,811
I've never had any real friends.

161
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,981
Except you, Rajah.

162
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,984
 I've never even been outside the palace walls.

163
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,403
But Jasmine, you're a princess.

164
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,449
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore!

165
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,829
Allah forbid you should have any daughters!

166
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,639
I don't know where she gets it from.  
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

167
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:14,646
Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.

168
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,775
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

169
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,778
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

170
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,780
It's this suitor business.

171
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,783
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.  I'm at my wit's-end.

172
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,994
Wit's-end.

173
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,040
Have a cracker, pretty polly!

174
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,129
Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.

175
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:46,052
Now then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.

176
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,597
If anyone can help, it's you.

177
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,643
Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.

178
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,604
Uh, my ring?

179
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,481
But it's been in the family for years.

180
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:02,527
It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.

181
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:11,036
Don't worry.  Everything will be fine.
- Everything will be fine.

182
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,289
The diamond.

183
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,792
Here, Jafar. Whatever you need 

184
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:18,793
will be fine.

185
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,297
You are most gracious, my liege.

186
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:31,264
Now run along and play with your little toys. 
Yes...that'll be...pretty good.

187
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:40,982
I can't take it anymore! 
 If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

188
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,776
bam!

189
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,488
Calm yourself, Iago.
-Then I'd grab him around the head. 

190
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:54,621
Soon, I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit.
-And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!

191
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:18,353
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  
But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.  

192
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:25,819
I'll miss you.

193
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,579
Good bye!

194
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,591
Okay, Abu.  Go!

195
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,971
Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing.

196
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,851
Hey, get your paws off that.

197
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,896
Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!

198
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,942
Bye bye!

199
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,988
Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served.

200
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,788
Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass or silver.

201
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,084
Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  
Sugar dates and pistachios!

202
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,297
Would the lady like a necklace.  
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

203
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,593
 Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

204
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,678
I don't think so.

205
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,808
Oh, excuse me.

206
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:45,106
I'm really very sorry.

207
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,539
Oh, you must be hungry.

208
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,540
Here you go. 

209
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,252
You'd better be able to pay for that.

210
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:06,961
Pay?

211
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,756
No one steals from my cart!

212
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,257
 Oh, I'm sorry sir.

213
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,759
I don't have any money.

214
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:13,301
Thief!

215
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,930
 Please, if you let me go to the palace, 
I can get some from the Sultan.

216
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,266
 Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

217
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,560
No, no please!

218
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,938
Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found her.

219
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,232
I've been looking all over for you.

220
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,233
What are you doing? 

221
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,943
Just play along.

222
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,569
You know this girl?

223
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,573
Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little crazy.

224
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,743
She said she knows the Sultan!

225
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:42,789
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

226
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,795
-Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?

227
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,133
Tragic, isn't it?

228
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,969
But, no harm done.

229
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,762
Now come along sis. Time to see the doctor.

230
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,557
Oh, hello doctor. How are you?

231
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,143
No, no, no. Not that one.

232
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,188
Come on, Sultan.

233
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,066
 What is it?

234
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:14,070
Come back here, you little thieves!

235
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,492
 With all due respect, your rottenness, 

236
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,912
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

237
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,708
Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!

238
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,754
Yes, o mighty evil one.

239
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:36,760
Ah, sands of time--reveal to me
 the one who can enter the cave.

240
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:42,515
Yes, yes!

241
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,893
There he is.

242
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,519
My diamond in the rough!

243
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,688
That's him?!?! 

244
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,107
That's the clown we've been waitin' for?

245
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,653
Let's have the guards extend him 
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

246
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,743
Swell.

247
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,749
Almost there.

248
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,716
I want to thank you for stopping that man.

249
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,719
Uh, forget it.

250
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,765
So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?

251
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,310
Is it that obvious?

252
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:31,356
Well, you do kinda stand out.  I mean,

253
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,403
you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.

254
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:41,116
I'm a fast learner.

255
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:47,664
C'mon, this way.

256
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:51,710
Watch your head there.  Be careful.

257
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,670
Is this where you live?

258
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,465
 Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.

259
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,676
That sounds fabulous.

260
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:03,722
 Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view.

261
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,851
Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

262
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,853
 Oh, it's wonderful.

263
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:14,524
I wonder what it would be like to live there, 
to have servants and valets...

264
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,695
Oh, sure.   People who tell you 
where to go and how to dress.

265
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:23,700
 It's better than here. 
 Always scraping for food and ducking the guards.

266
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,660
You're not free to make your own choices.

267
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,662
Sometimes you feel so--

268
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,580
You're just--

269
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,625
--trapped.

270
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,173
So, where're you from?

271
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:42,218
What does it matter? 
 I ran away, and I am not going back.

272
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,138
Really?

273
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,683
How come?

274
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,852
My father's forcing me to get married.

275
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:54,898
 That's--that's awful.

276
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,568
Abu!

277
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,446
 What?

278
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,656
Abu says that--

279
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,159
--that's not fair.

280
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,455
Oh did he?
-Yeah, of course.

281
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,667
And does Abu have anything else to say?

282
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,712
 Well, uh, he wishes 
there was something he could do to help.

283
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:23,927
Hmm, tell him that's very sweet.

284
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,472
Here you are!

285
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,056
They've found me! 

286
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,474
They're after you?

287
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:30,850
My father must have sent them--

288
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:31,559
Do you trust me?

289
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,185
What?

290
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,687
Do you trust me?

291
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,146
Yes.

292
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:39,192
Then jump!

293
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:46,825
We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?

294
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,453
Run! 
Go! Get out of here!

295
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,457
It's the dungeon for you, boy.

296
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,667
Hey, get off of me!

297
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,751
Lethim go!

298
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,797
Look what we have here, men--a street mouse. 

299
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:05,719
Unhand him, by order of the princess.

300
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,679
Princess Jasmine.

301
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,848
The princess?

302
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,059
What are you doing outside the palace?  
And with this street rat?

303
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,645
That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  

304
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,147
Release him!

305
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,775
Well, I would, princess,except my orders come from Jafar.

306
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,652
You'll have to take it up with him.

307
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:26,698
Believe me, I will.

308
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,663
Jafar?

309
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:36,374
Oh, uh, princess.

310
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,168
Jafar, I'm stuck!

311
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,669
How may I be of service to you?

312
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:43,715
The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.

313
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,677
Your father's charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. 

314
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,678
The boy was a criminal.

315
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,180
What was his crime?

316
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,974
I can't breathe, Jafar!

317
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,185
Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.

318
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,146
If you could just--
--wow, that hurt!

319
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,649
He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!

320
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:05,695
Oh, dear!  Oh, how frightfully upsetting.

321
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,365
Had I but known.

322
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,657
What do you mean?

323
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:13,078
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.

324
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,662
What sentence?

325
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,164
Death.

326
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,458
By beheading.

327
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,462
No!

328
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:26,049
 I am exceedingly sorry, princess.

329
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,095
How could you? 

330
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,438
So, how did  it go?

331
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,484
I think she took it ...
...rather well. 

332
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,668
It's all my fault, Rajah.

333
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:06,047
 I didn't even know his name.

334
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:28,486
She was the princess.  I can't believe it.

335
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:32,657
I must have sounded so stupid to her.

336
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,664
 Abu!  Down here!

337
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:44,169
Hey, c'mon--help me outta these.

338
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:53,470
Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.

339
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,640
Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.

340
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,435
I'm a street rat, remember, and there's a law.

341
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:04,481
She's gotta marry a prince, she deserves a prince.

342
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,611
I'm a--I'm a fool

343
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:13,615
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

344
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,116
Who are you?

345
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:19,120
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,

346
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,623
perhaps we can be more.

347
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,624
I'm listening.

348
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:26,670
There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders. 

349
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:31,049
Filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.

350
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:36,846
Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.

351
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,642
Jafar, can ya hurry it up? I'm dyin' in here!

352
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,436
But the law says that only a prince can--

353
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,605
You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?

354
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,609
 Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

355
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:53,029
So why would you share 
all of this wonderful treasure with me?

356
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:57,075
I need a young pair of legs 
and a strong back to go in after it.

357
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:02,080
Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?

358
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:07,168
Things aren't always what they seem.

359
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:12,549
So, do we have a deal?

360
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,274
Who disturbs my slumber?

361
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,155
It is I, Aladdin.

362
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:39,659
Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.

363
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:46,166
Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, 
and then you shall have your reward.

364
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:53,673
 C'mon, Abu.

365
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:09,647
Would ya look at that!

366
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:14,277
Just a handful of this stuff 
would make me richer than the sultan!

367
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:21,868
Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.

368
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:59,572
Abu, will ya knock it off?

369
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:24,597
Abu, what are you--crazy?

370
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:29,602
A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.

371
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:34,190
I'm not gonna hurt you.

372
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,534
Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite.

373
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,589
Hey, wait a minute.Don't go. 
 Maybe you can help us.

374
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,848
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.

375
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,894
I think he knows where it is.

376
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:29,579
Wait here!

377
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,074
 This is it?  This is what we came all the way down here to--

378
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,160
Abu-
 NO!

379
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:13,123
Infidels!

380
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:17,168
You have touched the forbidden treasure.

381
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:23,800
Now you will never again see the light of day!

382
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:04,090
Carpet, let's move!

383
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:23,026
Abu, this is no time to panic! 

384
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:27,072
Start panicking.

385
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:56,518
Help me out!

386
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,686
Throw me the lamp!

387
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,480
I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.

388
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:04,526
First give me the lamp!

389
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:15,036
Yes!  At last!

390
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,497
What are you doing?

391
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,000
 Giving you your reward.

392
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:24,045
Your eternal reward.

393
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,534
It's mine.  It's all mine!---

394
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:58,997
where is it?  No. 

395
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,043
NO!!

396
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,800
Jasmine?

397
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:14,846
Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?

398
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:20,643
Jafar...has...done something... terrible.

399
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,524
There, there, there, my dear--we'll set it right.

400
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:31,821
Now, tell me everything.

401
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:43,541
Oh, my head.

402
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:49,047
We're trapped. That two faced son-of-a-jackal!

403
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:54,052
Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.

404
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:00,183
 Why, you hairy little thief!

405
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:03,520
Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.

406
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:07,482
Hey, I think there's something written here,

407
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:11,528
but it's hard to make out.

408
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:25,333
Aaaaahhhhh!  OY! 

409
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:32,048
Ten-thousand years will give ya such a crick in the neck!
Hang on a second!

410
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:38,013
 Whoa!  Does it feel good to be outta there!

411
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,598
I'm telling ya, nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. 
 Hi, where ya from?

412
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,684
What's your name?

413
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:43,810
 Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
-Aladdin!

414
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:46,479
Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.

415
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:51,526
Can we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?' 
Or how bout Laddi? Sounds like 'Here, boy!  
C'mon, Laddi!'

416
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,488
I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

417
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,491
Do you smoke?  Mind if I do?

418
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,494
Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I didn't singe the fur!

419
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:05,540
Yo, Rugman!  Haven't seen you in a few millennia!  
Slap me some tassel!

420
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:12,964
Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master.
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

421
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:18,303
Look at me from the side--do I look different to you?
-Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?

422
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:22,349
That's right!  He can  be taught!! 
What would you wish of me,  

423
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:26,519
the ever impressive, the long contained,

424
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:29,189
often imitated, but never duplicated--

425
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,108
 Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.

426
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,196
Genie Of The Lamp!

427
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:41,493
Right here direct from the lamp,
 right here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment.Thank youuuuu!

428
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:48,083
Wish fulfillment?
-Three wishes to be exact. 
 And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.

429
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,463
Uno, dos, tres.No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.

430
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,673
Now I know I'm dreaming.

431
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:58,468
Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here!

432
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:04,516
So why don't you just ruminate, 
whilst I illuminate the possibilities.

433
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:10,438
Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
Scheherazadie had a thousand tales,

434
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,026

Do your friends do that?

446
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:23,553
Do your friends pull this 
out their little hat

460
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,307
Friend...

462
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,947
PLJESAK

463
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,119
So what'll it be, master?

464
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,750
You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right?
-Ah, almost.  There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos

465
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:41,256
Like?
-Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody. 

466
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:48,555
So don't ask.
Rule number  two: I can't make anybody fall in love 
with anybody else.

467
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:53,476
You little punim, there.
Rule three: I can't bring people back from the dead.

468
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:58,398
It's not a pretty picture, I don't like doing it!

469
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,444
Other than that, you got it

470
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,530
Ah, provisos?

471
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,908
You mean limitations?  On wishes?

472
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,912
Some all powerful genie--can't even bring people back from the dead.

473
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:16,416
I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even get us out of this cave.

474
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,835
Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here--

475
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:22,505
Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at me?  

476
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,007
Did you rub my lamp?

477
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:27,344
Did you wake me up, did you bring me here?

478
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:32,098
And all of a sudden, you're walkin' out on me?
Idon't think so, not right now.

479
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,727
You're gettin' your wishes, so siddown!

480
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:39,773
In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here,
 here,here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, anywhere!

481
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:45,487
Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet. 
 Weeee'rrrrrreee...

482
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:48,198
outta here!

483
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:51,368
Jafar, this is an outrage.

484
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:55,372
If it weren't for all your years of loyal service...

485
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:59,167
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me,

486
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:01,461
before they are beheaded.

487
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,881
I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again.

488
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:12,389
Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy business behind us. 
Please?

489
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:20,313
My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, princess.
-At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. 

490
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,525
When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.

491
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:31,408
Well, now, that's nice.  All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business,

492
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:34,911
Jasmine?
Jasmine?

493
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:39,833
If only I had gotten that lamp!

494
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:43,628
I will have the power to get rid of you!

495
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:48,174
To think--we gotta keep kissing up to that scum,
 and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives...

496
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:52,178
To think--we gotta keep kissing up to that scum,
 and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives...

497
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,224
No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband.

498
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:01,229
Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded!

499
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:09,529
 Wait a minute!  Wait a minute! Jafar? 
 What if YOU were the chump husband?

500
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:10,780
What?

501
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,409
 Okay, you marry the princess,all right?

502
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,372
Then, uh, you become sultan!

503
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:23,710
Marry the shrew?  I become the sultan.

504
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:27,881
The idea has merit!
-Yes, merit! Yes! 

505
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:35,388
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff!

506
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:43,730
 Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!

507
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:56,368
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs.

508
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:59,621
Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop.

509
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:03,667
Thank you.  Good bye, good bye!  Thank you! Good bye!

510
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:07,629
Well, now.  How about that, Mr.  doubting mustafa?

511
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,340
Oh, you sure showed me.

512
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,634
Now about my three wishes--

513
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:15,345
Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three?

514
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:18,348
You are down by ONE, boy!

515
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,351
Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the cave.

516
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:24,979
You did that on your own.

517
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:27,649
Well, don't I feel just sheepish? 

518
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:31,319
All right, you baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies.

519
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:35,365
Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be good.

520
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,118
What would you wish for?

521
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,163
Me?  No one's ever asked me that before.

522
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,333
Well, in my case, ah, forget it.

523
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,379
What?  C'mon, tell me.

524
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:51,840
Freedom.

525
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:53,550
 You're a prisoner?

526
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,635
It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig.

527
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:59,347
Phenomenal cosmic powers!

528
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,349
Itty bitty living space

529
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,351
Genie, that's terrible.

530
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:05,645
But, oh--to be free.

531
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:11,276
Not have to go "Poof! What do you need?
 Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?" 

532
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:18,992
To be my own master, such a thing would be greater 
than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world!

533
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:25,331
But what am I talking about?  Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus

534
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:31,129
Why not?
-The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.

535
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,340
So you can guess how often that's happened.

536
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:38,178
 I'll do it. I'll set you free.
-Aha, yeah, right.

537
00:44:38,386 --> 00:44:44,642
No, really, I promise. After make my first two wishes, 
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

538
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:49,606
Well, here's hopin'. 
Alright.
Let's make some magic! 

539
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:52,484
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

540
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:55,570
Well, there's this girl--

541
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:56,571
Wrong!

542
00:44:56,613 --> 00:45:00,075
I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?

543
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:04,662
Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and...

544
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:06,289
Pretty?
- Beautiful.

545
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:09,876
She's got these eyes that just...and this hair,

546
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:13,588
...and her smile.

547
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,299
 Ami.  C'est l'amour.

548
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:20,303
But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd have to be a--

549
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,304
hey,

550
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,307
can you make me a prince?

551
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,602
Let's see here. Uh, chicken a'la king? Nope.

552
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:31,356
Alaskan king crab? Ow, I hate it when they do that.

553
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,274
Caesar's salad? Et tu, Brute? No!

554
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:39,698
Aha, to make a prince. Now is that an official wish?
Say the magic words!

555
00:45:39,906 --> 00:45:42,075
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!

556
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:45,286
All right! 

557
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:49,082
First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century.

558
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:51,292
These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No!

559
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:54,796
Let's work with me here.

560
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,590
I like it, muy macho!

561
00:45:57,632 --> 00:46:01,302
Now, still needs something. 
 What does it say to me? It says...

562
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:06,808
mode of transportation! 
Excuse me, monkey boy!  Aqui; over here!

563
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:11,312
Here he comes,And what better way 
to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, 

564
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:14,733
than... riding your very own brand new...

565
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:16,401
camel!  Watch out, they spit!

566
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:22,866
Hm, not enough.
Still not enough. Let's see.  What do you need, what you need?

567
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:28,329
Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  

568
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:34,336
Talk about your trunk space, check this action out!

569
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,302
Abu, you look good.

570
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:46,348
He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant,
 but we're not through yet.

571
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,643
Hang on to your turban, kid, we're gonna make you a star!

572
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:04,115
Sir, I have found a solution to the problem with your daughter.

573
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,286
Oh, really?

574
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,288
Right here.  

575
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:17,921
"If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
 then the sultan shall choose for her."

576
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:20,298
But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  

577
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,553
How could I choose someone she hates?
-Not to worry, my liege.There is more.  

578
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:29,599
If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found,

579
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:38,358
a princess must then be wed to...
...hmm...interesting.

580
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:46,241
What?  Who?
-The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!

581
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:50,286
But, I thought the law says that only a prince 
can marry a princess, I'm quite sure.

582
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:55,291
Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.

583
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:59,254
Yes...desperate measures...

584
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:02,757
You will order the princess to marry me.

585
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:06,803
I...will order...the princess...to...

586
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,849
...but you're so old!

587
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,769
The princess will marry me!

588
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:18,732
The princess will marry...
What? What is that?  

589
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:22,777
That music!  

590
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:28,700
Jafar, you must come see this!

591
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:33,788
Make way for Prince Ali!

592
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:40,295
Say hey!  It's Prince Ali!

593
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:49,763
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, 
Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star,
Oh, come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!

594
00:48:50,555 --> 00:48:55,810
Make way, here he comes, ring bells, bang the drums,
You're gonna love this guy

595
00:48:55,852 --> 00:49:00,398
Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!

596
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,444
Genuflect, show some respect, Down on one knee

597
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:10,492
Now try your best to stay calm 
Brush up your Sunday Salaam

598
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:14,537
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie.

599
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:19,209
Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa!

600
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,254
Strong as ten regular men, definitely

601
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:29,219
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords

602
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,224
Who sent those goons to their lords, 
why Prince Ali!

603
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:38,895
He's got seventy-five golden camels! 
-Don't they look lovely, June? 

604
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:43,692
Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three!
-Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers! 

605
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:52,200
When it comes to exotic type mammals
Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you 
It's a world class menagerie!

606
00:49:52,242 --> 00:50:01,418
Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
 That physique, how can I speak Weak at the knee

607
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:06,423
Well, get on out in that square
 Adjust your veil and prepare

608
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:10,218
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!

609
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,181
He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!)

610
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:19,769
And to view them, he charges no fee! 
(He's generous, so generous)

611
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:23,106
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies!

612
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:25,817
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim, love serving him

613
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:33,324
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  
Prince Ali!

614
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,454
Prince Ali! Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa

615
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:43,793
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!

616
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:47,547
And that, good people, is why 
He got dolled up and dropped by

617
00:50:48,256 --> 00:50:52,218
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions, A brass band and more

618
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:58,058
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers 
His birds that warble on key,
Make way

619
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:03,229
 for HIM, for HIM!!

620
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:10,195
Splendid, absolutely marvelous.

621
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:14,240
Your majesty, I have journeyed from afar 
to seek your daughter's hand.

622
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:19,537
Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to meet you.

623
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:24,209
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted too.

624
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:29,214
Ecstatic. 
 I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo--
--Ababwa!

625
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:34,594
Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to--

626
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:38,264
- By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.

627
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,519
 I don't suppose I might...

628
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,523
Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me.

629
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:50,068
Sire, I must advise against this--

630
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,530
--Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun.

631
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:06,209
Just where did you say you were from?

632
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:10,255
Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.

633
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:15,260
Try me. 
(- Look out, Polly!)

634
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:20,265
 Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!

635
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:32,694
Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar, watch this!

636
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:34,487
Spectacular, your highness.

637
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:40,118
Ooh, it was lovely. 
 Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it. 

638
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:44,748
This is a very impressive youth. And a prince, besides.

639
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:49,169
If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.

640
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,462
I don't trust him, sire.

641
00:52:50,503 --> 00:52:57,177
Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, 
I'm an excellent judge of character.

642
00:52:57,218 --> 00:53:00,764
Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...
NOT!!!

643
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:05,518
Jasmine will like this one!
-And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine!

644
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:11,816
Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different from the others.

645
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:19,532
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
-Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! Just let her meet me.

646
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:22,869
I will win your daughter!
-How dare you! 

647
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:26,623
All of you, standing around deciding my future?

648
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:29,793
I am not a prize to be won! 

649
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,172
Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.

650
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:37,175
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

651
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:41,221
I think it's time to say good bye to Prince Abooboo.

652
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:50,146
What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

653
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:54,192
I should have known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.

654
00:53:57,195 --> 00:54:01,199
So move!

655
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:04,160
That's a good move.

656
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,956
I can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug.

657
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,168
Genie, I need help.
-All right, sparky, here's the deal.

658
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:17,090
If you wanna court the little lady, 
you gotta be a straight shooter, do ya got it?

659
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:20,010
What?
-Tell her the ...

660
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:25,223
TRUTH!!!
-No way! If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat,

661
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:27,559
she'd laugh at me.

662
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,146
A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!

663
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:37,986
Al, all joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself.
-Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.

664
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:45,660
OK, I'm gonna go see her...I just...
  I gotta be smooth, cool, confident. 

665
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:48,747
How do I look?

666
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:52,792
Like...
a prince.

667
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:06,473
 Princess Jasmine?

668
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:13,605
Who's there?
-It's me--Prince Ali. 
 Prince Ali Ababwa.

669
00:55:13,813 --> 00:55:18,193
I do not want to see you.
-No, no, please princess. Give me a chance. 

670
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:19,861
Just leave me alone.

671
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:21,154
Down kitty!

672
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:25,158
How's our beau doing?

673
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,162
Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty.

674
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:32,165
 Wait, wait.  Do I know you?

675
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:34,167
Uh, no, no.

676
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:38,213
You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.

677
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:42,717
The marketplace?  I have servants that go to the marketplace for me.

678
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:51,142
Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace
 for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met.

679
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:55,146
No, I guess not.

680
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:57,148
Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk about her!

681
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,194
She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes.
  Anything--pick a feature!

682
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:08,034
Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very...
-Wonderful,  magnificent, glorious, punctual!

683
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:09,285
Punctual!
-Punctual?

684
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:12,747
Sorry.
-Beautiful.
-Nice recovery.

685
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:15,166
 I'm rich too, you know.

686
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,459
Yeah!

687
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,169
The daughter of a sultan

688
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:20,171
I know.

689
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:24,175
A fine prize for any  prince to marry.

690
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:27,178
 Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me.

691
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,180
Warning! Warning!

692
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:35,353
 Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt,
 swaggering, peacock I've met!

693
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,648
Mayday! Mayday!

694
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,650
Just go jump off a balcony!

695
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:44,112
What?
-Stop her! Stop her!  Want me to sting her?

696
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:49,325
Buzz off!
Okay, fine. But remember--bee yourself!

697
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:50,994
Yeah, right!
- What!?!

698
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:54,122
Uh, you're right.

699
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:58,376
You aren't just some prize to be won.

700
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:01,379
You should be free to make your own choice.

701
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,297
I'll go now.

702
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:03,089
No!

703
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:05,091
What?  What?

704
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:08,094
How--how are you doing that?

705
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,888
It's a magic carpet.

706
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,599
It's lovely. 

707
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,644
You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you?

708
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:19,898
We could get out of the palace, see the world.

709
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:24,319
Is it safe?
-Sure.  Do you trust me?

710
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:28,740
What?
-Do you trust me?

711
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,619
Yes.

712
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:49,636
I can show you the world

713
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:54,599
Shining, shimmering, splendid.

714
00:57:54,641 --> 00:58:01,898
Tell me princess, now when did you last 
Let your heart decide?

715
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:05,443
I can open your eyes

716
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:09,614
Take you wonder by wonder

717
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:12,575
Over, sideways, and under

718
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:16,371
On a magic carpet ride

719
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:19,666
A whole new world!

720
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:23,378
A new fantastic point of view

721
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,090
 No one to tell us no

722
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:29,384
Or where to go

723
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:32,053
Or say we're only dreaming

724
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,597
A whole new world

725
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,643
A dazzling place I never knew

726
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:42,063
 But when I'm way up here

727
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:43,064
 It's crystal clear

728
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:48,611
That now I'm in a whole new world with you!

729
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:52,532
Now I'm in a whole new world with you!

730
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:59,039
Unbelievable sights, Indescribable feeling

731
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,584
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

732
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:05,378
Through an endless diamond sky

733
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,674
A whole new world!
-Don't you dare close your eyes

734
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:14,471
A hundred thousand things to see
(-Hold your breath--it gets better!)

735
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:16,097
 I'm like a shooting star,

736
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:17,599
I've come so far

737
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:23,813
I can't go back to where I used to be!
-A whole new world!

738
00:59:23,855 --> 00:59:26,066
-Every turn a surprise

739
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:29,069
With new horizons to pursue
-Every moment, red-letter

740
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:33,073
I'll chase them anywhere,There's time to spare

741
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:37,118
Let me share this whole new world with you

742
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:44,709
A whole new world

743
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:48,672
That's where we'll be

744
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:57,639
A thrilling chase, A wondrous place 
For you and me!

745
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:14,114
It's all so magical.
-Yeah.

746
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:18,076
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

747
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:22,122
Nah.  He hates fireworks.
He doesn't really like flying either.

748
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:26,835
That is...oh no!

749
01:00:26,876 --> 01:00:30,380
You are the boy from the market!  I knew it. 
 Why did you lie to me?

750
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:33,717
Jasmine, I'm sorry.
-Did you think I was stupid?
-No!

751
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:37,679
That I wouldn't figure it out?
-No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.

752
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:39,389
No, that's not what I meant.

753
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:41,099
Who are you?  Tell me the truth!

754
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:45,061
The truth? 

755
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:49,107
The truth...the truth is...

756
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:56,364
I sometimes dress as a commoner 
to escape the pressures of palace life.

757
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:04,372
 But I really am a prince!
-Why didn't you just tell me?

758
01:01:04,372 --> 01:01:12,088
Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the city in disguise, 
it sounds a little strange, don't you think?

759
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:16,593
Not that strange.

760
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:40,658
Good night, my handsome prince.

761
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,704
Sleep well, princess.

762
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:09,688
Yes!

763
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:16,319
For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.

764
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:24,703
Hold him!

765
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:33,211
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince  Abooboo.

766
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:37,716
Make sure he's never found.

767
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:23,261
Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.

768
01:03:23,303 --> 01:03:27,307
Hello. Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it!

769
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:32,645
You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you unless you make a wish.
  You have to say

770
01:03:32,687 --> 01:03:36,691
"Genie I want you to save my life."  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon Aladdin!! 

771
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,322
I'll take that as a yes. Up scope!

772
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,959
Don't you scare me like that!

773
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:59,005
Genie, I--uh, I-uh...

774
01:04:01,716 --> 01:04:04,177
Thanks, Genie.

775
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:08,223
Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  
Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything.

776
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:17,065
 Jasmine!

777
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:21,111
Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I'm so happy.

778
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:28,743
You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.
-What?

779
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:32,664
You will wed Jafar.

780
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:35,667
You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a wife.

781
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:40,672
I will never marry you.
Father, I choose Prince Ali!

782
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:41,965
Prince Ali left!

783
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:43,675
Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar!

784
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:45,677
Prince Ali!

785
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:48,972
How in the he--

786
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:52,976
Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me killed.

787
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:56,980
What?  Ridiculous nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying.

788
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,942
Obviously...lying.

789
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,235
Father, what's wrong with you?

790
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:06,281
I know what's wrong!

791
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:10,618
Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this! 

792
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:14,664
What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor!

793
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,626
Your majesty, all of this can be explained.

794
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:20,628
Guards! Guards!

795
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:24,632
Well, that's it--we're dead, forget it. 
 Just dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead.

796
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:27,761
Arrest Jafar at once!

797
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:32,182
This is not done yet, boy!

798
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:37,145
Find him, search everywhere!

799
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:39,606
Jasmine, are you all right?

800
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:42,609
 Jafar, my most trusted counselor,

801
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:46,613
plotting against me all this time. This is horrible, just horrible. 

802
01:05:46,654 --> 01:05:52,994
 How will I ever-
Can this be true? 

803
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:57,665
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?

804
01:05:58,249 --> 01:06:04,047
Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!

805
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:09,260
I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  
But you two will be wed at once!

806
01:06:09,302 --> 01:06:15,517
Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, 
and then my boy, you will become sultan!

807
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:18,853
Sultan?
-Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself,

808
01:06:18,895 --> 01:06:24,567
a person of your unimpeachable moral character 
is exactly what this kingdom needs!

809
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:28,196
We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get-- 
 I gotta start packing, your highness. 

810
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:31,991
Only essentials.We gotta travel at light! 
Bring the guns,the weapons, the knives!

811
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:35,620
And how about this picture? 
 I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it.

812
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:43,044
Oh, boy--  He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.

813
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:46,631
Jafar? Jafar? Get a grip!

814
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:49,175
Good grip!

815
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:52,595
Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin.

816
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:56,099
He has the lamp, Iago.
-Why that miserable--

817
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:58,601
But you are going to relieve him of it!

818
01:06:58,643 --> 01:07:02,605
  Me?

819
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:07,110
Sultan?  They want me to be sultan?

820
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:14,617
Hail the conquering hero!

821
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:23,084
Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess.

822
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:27,130
What are you gonna do next?

823
01:07:31,926 --> 01:07:36,848
Psst, your line is "I'm going to free the genie."  

824
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:38,516
Anytime.

825
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:40,101
Genie...I can't.

826
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:44,105
Sure you can.  You just go "Genie, I wish you free." 

827
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:48,568
 I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am.

828
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:52,614
 But they want to make me sultan--no!, 
They want to make Prince Ali sultan.

829
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:56,201
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

830
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:57,369
Al, you won!

831
01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:01,414
Because of you! The only reason 
anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you.

832
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:05,627
What if they find outI'm not really a prince?  
What if Jasmine finds out?

833
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:10,131
I'd lose her.  Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.

834
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:14,594
I...I can't wish you free.

835
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:18,598
Fine, I understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

836
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,601
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

837
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:25,605
Now, if you'll excuse me, MASTER.

838
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:35,240
Genie, I'm really sorry...
Well, fine!! Then just stay in there!

839
01:08:36,616 --> 01:08:40,620
What are you guys looking at?

840
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:48,628
Look, I--I'm sorry. Abu--
I'm sorry, I didn't-- wait, c'mon.

841
01:08:54,592 --> 01:08:59,848
What am I doing? 
Genie's right--

842
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:03,560
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

843
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:07,564
Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?

844
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:10,525
Well, here goes.

845
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:13,528
Jasmine?  Where are you?

846
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:18,575
--In the menagerie, hurry.
-I'm coming.

847
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:24,581
Ya got a problem, pinky? 

848
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:30,837
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you!

849
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:32,547
Excellent work, Iago!

850
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:37,761
Ah, go on. -No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are eleven.

851
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:41,890
Ah, Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm  blushing.

852
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:50,482
People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a  suitor!

853
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:52,859
Jasmine?

854
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:55,362
Ali, where have you been?

855
01:09:55,403 --> 01:09:57,739
Jasmine, there's something I've got to tell you.

856
01:09:57,781 --> 01:10:01,785
The whole kingdom has turned out for father's announcement!
No! But Jasmine, 

857
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:05,038
listen to me, please! You don't understand--
-Good luck! 

858
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,084
...Ali Ababwa!
-Oh, boy!

859
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:15,590
Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.

860
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:20,553
Let them cheer.

861
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:24,557
You know Al, I'm getting reallyyyyyy--
I don't think you're him. 

862
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:28,603
Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, 
dark and sinister ugly man.

863
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:30,522
I am your master now.

864
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:32,524
I was afraid of that.

865
01:10:32,565 --> 01:10:35,026
Genie, grant me my first wish.

866
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:39,072
I wish to rule on high, as sultan!!!

867
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:52,877
Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on?
-Father!

868
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:58,550
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

869
01:10:58,591 --> 01:11:01,553
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

870
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:05,598
Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that! 
The lamp!

871
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:10,562
Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

872
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:27,704
Genie!  No!

873
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:31,166
Sorry, kid--I got a new master now. 

874
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,169
Jafar, I order you to stop!

875
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,340
Oh, but there's a new order now--
MY order!

876
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:43,553
Finally, YOU will bow to ME!
-We'll never bow to you!

877
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:45,847
Why am I not surprised?

878
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:51,853
If you will not bow before a sultan,
 then you will cower before a sorcerer!

879
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:56,649
Genie, my second wish--
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer

880
01:11:56,691 --> 01:11:59,527
IN THE WORLD!!!

881
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:03,531
Genie, stop!

882
01:12:03,573 --> 01:12:07,535
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for

883
01:12:07,577 --> 01:12:10,538
Sorcerer Jafar!

884
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:17,128
Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation!

885
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:23,093
Down, boy!

886
01:12:23,593 --> 01:12:27,597
 Oh, princess--
--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to.

887
01:12:27,889 --> 01:12:29,057
Jafar!  Get your hands off her!

888
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:31,559
Prince Ali,Yes, it is he,

889
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:33,561
But not as you know him.

890
01:12:33,603 --> 01:12:37,565
Read my lips and come to grips With reality

891
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:43,530
 Yes, meet a blast from your past
 Whose lies were too good to last

892
01:12:43,571 --> 01:12:46,533
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

893
01:12:46,574 --> 01:12:49,536
 Or should we say Aladdin?

894
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:54,249
- Ali?
-Jasmine, I tried to tell you, I'm just--

895
01:12:54,457 --> 01:13:02,382
So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin.
Just a con, need I go on? Take it from me

896
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:07,804
His personality flaws.
Give me adequate cause

897
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:12,225
To send him packing on a one-way trip, 
So his prospects take a terminal dip

898
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:19,482
His assets frozen, the venue chosen 
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee! So long,

899
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:25,739
 Good bye, see ya!
-Ex-Prince Ali!

900
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:54,851
Abu? 
 Abu!

901
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:02,025
 Oh, this is all my fault--
I--

902
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:06,488
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.
 Abu!

903
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:09,741
Are you okay?  

904
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:18,708
I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of everything...somehow. 
 I gotta go back and set things right.

905
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:29,552
 Carpet! 

906
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:36,059
Abu, start digging!

907
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:39,562
That's it!

908
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:57,914
Yeah! Alright!

909
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:08,550
Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go!

910
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:16,808
Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker. 
Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have lots of crackers!

911
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:20,520
Stop it! 
Jafar, Leave him alone!

912
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:26,526
 It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.

913
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:34,784
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself
 should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.

914
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:39,414
What do  you say, my dear? 
 Why,  with you as my queen...

915
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:41,958
Never!

916
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,004
I'll teach you some respect!

917
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:52,552
No...
Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.

918
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:59,642
I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in  love with me.

919
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:08,443
Ah, master-- there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo-

920
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:11,446
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout! 

921
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:16,743
You will do what I order you to do, slave!

922
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:18,453
Jafar!

923
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:24,876
I never realized how incredibly handsome you are.

924
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:31,049
That's better.

925
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:35,512
Now, pussycat, tell me more about...myself.

926
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:44,270
You're...tall, dark...
... well dressed...

927
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,483
Al!  Al, little buddy!

928
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:54,364
 Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath, now. 

929
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:56,449
What are you gonna do?

930
01:16:56,449 --> 01:17:00,453
Hey--I'm a street rat, remember?
 I'll improvise.

931
01:17:03,456 --> 01:17:05,417
Go on.

932
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:11,381
And your beard...is so...
twisted! 

933
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:20,432
And the street rat?

934
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:24,477
What street rat?

935
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:37,907
That was--

936
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:44,330
You!!  How many times do I have to kill you, boy?

937
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:50,795
Get the lamp!

938
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,089
NO!

939
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:58,470
Princess--
Your time is up!

940
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,432
Jasmine!

941
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:05,727
Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- 

942
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:09,773
Don't toy with me!  

943
01:18:09,814 --> 01:18:10,815
Abu!

944
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:14,778
Things are unraveling fast, now boy.

945
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:21,451
Get the point? 

946
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:28,249
I'm just getting warmed up!

947
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:33,463
Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly  snake?

948
01:18:33,963 --> 01:18:36,508
A snake, am I?

949
01:18:36,549 --> 01:18:40,970
Perhaps you'd like to see how snake-like I can be!

950
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:00,865
 Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into  that snake!

951
01:19:00,907 --> 01:19:05,954
You stay out of it!
-Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it,
GREAT!

952
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:12,127
Aladdin!

953
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:25,473
 Jasmine, hang on!

954
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:29,436
You little fool! 

955
01:19:29,477 --> 01:19:35,275
You thought  you could defeat the most 
powerful being on earth!

956
01:19:35,316 --> 01:19:38,445
Squeeze him, Jafar--Squeeze him like a--! 

957
01:19:38,611 --> 01:19:43,742
Without the Genie, boy, you're nothing!
-The genie!

958
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:48,830
The genie!
The genie has more power than you'll ever have!

959
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:53,001
What!!?
- He gave you your power, he can take it away!

960
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:55,670
Al, what are you doing?  
Why are you bringing me into this?

961
01:19:55,712 --> 01:19:58,965
Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best!

962
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,470
You're right!  His power does exceed my own!

963
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:08,433
But not for long!

964
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:10,935
The boy is crazy.  He's a little punch drunk.

965
01:20:10,977 --> 01:20:12,896
One too many hits with the snake

966
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:16,941
Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be...

967
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:21,071
an all powerful genie!

968
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:27,952
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

969
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:39,506
Yes! Yes! 
The power!

970
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:46,471
The absolute power!

971
01:20:47,472 --> 01:20:50,725
 What have you done?
-Trust me!

972
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:54,771
The universe is mine to command, to control!

973
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:59,442
Not so fast, Jafar! 
 Aren't you forgetting something?

974
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:03,697
You wanted to be a genie, you got it!
-What?

975
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:09,285
And everything that goes with it!
-No!  No!

976
01:21:09,327 --> 01:21:11,621
I'm gettin' out of here! 
 -Phenomenal cosmic powers!

977
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:14,749
-Come on, you're the genie, I don't want---

978
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:19,921
-Itty bitty living space.
-Al, you little genius, you!

979
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:36,855
Get your blasted beak out of my face!

980
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:38,857
Oh, shut up, you moron!

981
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:41,359
Don't tell me to shut up!
-Allow me.

982
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:45,405
 Ten- thousand years
 in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out!

983
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:59,711
Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince.

984
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:04,716
I know why you did.

985
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:09,679
Well, I guess...
this... is goodbye? 

986
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:13,725
 Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you.

987
01:22:17,103 --> 01:22:19,564
Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.

988
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:22,108
Just say the word and you're a prince again.

989
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:25,236
But Genie, what about your freedom?

990
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:27,364
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude. 

991
01:22:27,405 --> 01:22:30,367
This...is love.

992
01:22:30,408 --> 01:22:33,870
Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.

993
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:37,374
Believe me, I know.  I've looked.

994
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:43,380
Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop 
 pretending to be something I'm not.

995
01:22:43,421 --> 01:22:47,425
 I understand.

996
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:53,807
 Genie, I wish for your freedom.
-One bona fide prince pedigree coming up--  I--what?

997
01:22:53,848 --> 01:22:58,436
Genie, you're free!

998
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:21,960
 I'm free. I'm free.
Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous. 

999
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:25,380
Say  "I...I want the Nile."   Wish for the Nile.  Try that!

1000
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:29,259
-I wish for the Nile.
-No way!! 

1001
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:34,889
Oh does that feel good! 
 I'm free!  I'm free at last!

1002
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:38,935
I'm hittin' the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I--

1003
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:51,364
Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you.

1004
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:55,410
Me too, Al.

1005
01:23:55,535 --> 01:24:01,374
No matter what anybody says, 
you'll always be a prince to me.

1006
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:06,379
That's right.  
You've certainly proven your worth 
as far as I'm concerned.

1007
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:10,133
It's that law that's the problem.

1008
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:13,470
-Father?
-Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1009
01:24:13,511 --> 01:24:19,392
From this day forth, the princess shall marry
 whomever she deems worthy.

1010
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:22,687
Him!  I choose...

1011
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:26,733
I choose you, Aladdin.

1012
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,363
 Call me Al.

1013
01:24:31,404 --> 01:24:35,408
Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug! Group hug! 

1014
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:39,371
Do you mind if I kiss the monkey? 
 Ooh, hairball! 

1015
01:24:39,412 --> 01:24:44,709
Well, I can't do any more damage around this popsicle stand. 
 I'm outta here!

1016
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:47,379
Bye, bye,  you two crazy lovebirds.

1017
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:51,424
Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm history! 
  No, I'm mythology!

1018
01:24:52,425 --> 01:24:56,429
No, I don't care what I am--I'm free!

1019
01:24:58,431 --> 01:25:00,392
A whole new world

1020
01:25:00,392 --> 01:25:03,269
A whole new life

1021
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:07,273
For you and me!

1022
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,043
Made ya look!
