1
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,080
Riggs, Homicide.

2
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,880
- Nobody's dead.
- The night's young.

3
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
This is Sergeant Murtaugh.

4
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,160
- Threat or a scare?
- Real thing.

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,520
He saw the device.

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,880
It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.
I wrote the license plate number.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,640
That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.

8
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
- You evacuated the building?
- It's clean.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,680
- Where's the bomb squad?
- Coming.

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Good. It's under control. Let's go.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,320
I think we ought to check this out.

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,200
- Hey, Riggs.
- What?

13
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,360
- Bomb squad's coming.
- There's no bomb.

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,880
- How do you know?
- Because it's a full moon.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,160
Moon, lunar, lunatics. They're everywhere.

16
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
- Is that Greek?
- No, Latin.

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
You surprise the shit out of me.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,400
There's no bomb.
It's probably a false alarm.

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,080
It happens. He probably saw a radio
on the back seat.

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,600
Let's not mess with it.
Wait for the bomb squad.

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
You're right. You sit tight,
I'll be right back.

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,440
What's the matter with you?

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
- There's a bomb in there!
- No, there's not.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
- There's a bomb in there!
- There is not.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
There's a bomb in there!

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,720
- You know how I know?
- How?

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,120
I've got eight days till retirement
and I won't make a stupid mistake.

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,120
There is no bomb.
I'll bet vital parts of my anatomy.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,040
Look.

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,040
Trust me. Okay?

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,560
That's usually my first mistake.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,840
Hey, wait. I'm coming.

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,120
Rog?

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,000
- Is your insurance paid up?
- Of course. Why?

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,360
- There could be a bomb in here.
- Oh, God!

36
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,840
- I hate it when I'm right.
- Learn to trust your instincts more.

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
Oh, God.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,720
The first impression
can often be the right one.

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,520
Drive shaft...

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,200
- I wonder if there's a bomb.
- Just don't touch it.

41
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,280
Just looking.

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you doing? Don't open the door!

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,280
Son of a bitch, just look at it.

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,840
That's all I'll do, just look.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,720
There's more plastic than Cher.

46
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,840
I love this job. This is amateur night.

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,720
Open the door. I can't hear you.

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,240
Open the door.

49
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't do nothing.

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,480
Not that one!

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,920
You son of a bitch.

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,920
This is a pretty shonky job.
I think I can dismantle it.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,040
It looks like Beirut to me. Let's go!

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,320
Everybody's outside. Just me, you
and the cat are dumb enough to be here.

55
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,600
Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?

56
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,440
- Relax, Rog. Relax.
- Right.

57
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Don't do nothing.

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,920
We've got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.
You know what we can do?

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,440
We could drive it out.

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
Fine, it's your turn to drive.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,760
No keys. I could hot-wire it.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,160
Don't even say "hot-wire"
around this stuff!

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,200
You're right.

64
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,320
Why am I doing this? Why?

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,240
We're going to have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you thinking?

67
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,480
What are you thinking?

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,960
- I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.
- Wait!

69
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,600
- That's not what I think.
- You think maybe the red?

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,880
No! No!

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm thinking it's 8 minutes and 42 seconds.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,560
We can go upstairs, wait for
the bomb squad, and have a cappuccino.

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,240
The bomb squad never gets here on time.
And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Rog, please.

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,760
Forget the cappuccino.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,960
- You know what they'll say?
- "Get the fuck out of here!"

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,200
But then they'll say: "Let's cut
the blue wire", which I'll do right now.

78
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
- Wait, wait!
- What?

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
How can you be so sure?

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
It's just a hunch.

81
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,760
A hunch?

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,720
Remember the bomb under your toilet?

83
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,400
- How could I forget?
- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.

84
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,360
This is more simplified,
but a bit more powerful.

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,280
From where I sat, I couldn't see.

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,040
Forget it. Come on, trust me.

87
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,160
Trust you?

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,360
Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?

89
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,480
What? What?

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,440
A minute ago you said blue.

91
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,400
I did?

92
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,120
You said blue.

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,920
- I meant red.
- Sure?

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
We can do it your way if you like.

95
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
- My way? I don't have...
- Quiet!

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm sure, okay?

97
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,880
Ah, shit!

98
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,880
Ready?

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,640
Rog?

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,040
What?

101
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,000
Won't you miss all this good stuff
when you retire?

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,720
Won't you miss it a little bit?

103
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm cutting the wire.

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,440
Snip. All done.

105
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Grab the cat!

106
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,000
Grab the cat?

107
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,760
Get out of there! Take cover!

108
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,480
Where are they?

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Bravo.

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,640
Whoops.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,320
Right. "Whoops."

112
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,480
Right.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,560
Seven days till retirement,
I'm busted down to patrolman.

114
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,920
I should've cut the red wire.

115
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,240
- You did.
- No, I cut the blue wire.

116
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
That's what I meant.

117
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,440
- We should've waited for the bomb squad.
- Must I hear this every day?

118
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,280
- Every day until I retire!
- That'll be a week too long.

119
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,880
- My feet are killing me.
- They're killing me, too.

120
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,480
- How?
- I have to listen to you bitch about them!

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,440
- Because you should've cut the red wire!
- I did cut the red wire!

122
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,440
What's this?

123
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
It's kind of soft. Not a bulletproof vest.

124
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,320
It won't keep anything out.

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,880
It'll keep my stomach in.

126
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,360
What have you got under there?

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
It's a girdle.

128
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,000
What?

129
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,880
It's a girdle.

130
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
Does Trish know?

131
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,520
It's a man's girdle.

132
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,040
They make girdles for men?

133
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
- Yes, they make girdles for men.
- They do?

134
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, they do.
I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,960
- Cleaners must have shrunk it.
- You should take it to Chin.

136
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,720
I did take it to Chin. Look at it.
It shrunk all up in here.

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,480
I have to hold my breath.

138
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,680
Did you see that?

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,360
- See what?
- Jaywalker.

140
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,960
Jaywalking?

141
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
Hold it right there, pal.
Step up here, please.

142
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,840
- Me?
- Yes, you.

143
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,360
- What'd I do?
- Stand there.

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,320
Jaywalking. I saw you.
I'll have to cite you.

145
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,920
Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on!

146
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,440
- Should I radio for backup?
- Smart-ass. Can you get the ticket book?

147
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,120
There are crimes in the city
and you're hassling me...

148
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,320
Shut up!

149
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,280
- Do you know how to fill one of these out?
- A long time ago.

150
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,040
I can't read it. The print is too small
without my glasses.

151
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,240
Can we speed this up?
You may have nothing to do, but I do.

152
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,440
No, we can't, so will you shut up?

153
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,520
- Jaywalking.
- Ask for his license.

154
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,360
- License, for jaywalking?
- Yeah.

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,240
I don't have it on me. I wasn't driving.

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,960
I was walking.
Do I need a walking license now?

157
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
- Let's just shoot him!
- Is he crazy?

158
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm going to drill him!
We'll make it look like suicide!

159
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,400
- Get out of the way!
- No, the video cameras!

160
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,120
I don't care! I'll drill him!

161
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,240
Get out of here, before he kills you!

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,880
- Go that way! Not that way!
- This way! Over here!

163
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,000
- Run!
- Now!

164
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,080
Run!

165
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,520
Wait a minute!

166
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You forgot to sign.

167
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
What was that?

168
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,200
Wait a minute.
You forgot to sign the form.

169
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Who are you?

170
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,760
You're not the regular guy?

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,280
- He's on vacation.
- On vacation?

172
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,680
Well, who the hell is that?

173
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,800
Get in the truck.

174
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,640
You fucking prick!

175
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,000
Are you a cop?

176
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.
Will continue transmission.

177
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
Call 911.

178
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,320
Okay, honey. Let me drive.
We're in pursuit.

179
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm driving! Don't worry.

180
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,920
This fool picked the wrong time
to mess with the wrong lady.

181
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,080
Just stay close.

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Right behind you, baby!

183
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
Take a good look!

184
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,600
Delores the Road Warrior
is dead on your raggedy ass!

185
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,240
Ram him!

186
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,520
- Watch out, Riggs!
- Come on!

187
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,600
Are you married, sugar?

188
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,640
What? Yes, 24 years. 24 years!

189
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,760
Yeah, but is it working?

190
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,080
- You can't get closer?
- I am. I'm getting closer.

191
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,520
Hold on, Riggs!

192
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,800
Hold on! We got you!

193
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,000
Hold on!

194
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,120
- I told you I could do it!
- Closer!

195
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,080
- Get me up there!
- Go!

196
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,920
I am!

197
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
Back off!

198
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,880
If he falls, don't hit him.

199
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,640
Don't worry, I've got something for you.

200
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,800
Thanks for the interest, sugar,
but one thing at a time.

201
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,080
- Catch him!
- All right!

202
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,880
Keep singing. Just stay close.

203
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,000
Relax, baby. Relax.

204
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,120
Keep your hands off my thighs!

205
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,160
- He's in trouble. Watch out!
- I got him!

206
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,680
I'm getting too old for this.

207
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,320
Not for me, you're not, sugar.

208
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,760
You have the right to remain unconscious.

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,880
Anything you say ain't gonna be much.

210
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,000
Hey, Riggs. Are you all right?

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,080
I'm okay. I think we've got to book
this guy for not wearing his seat belt.

212
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,080
That was dynamite driving.

213
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,160
- She's a dynamite driver.
- I'll show you dynamite.

214
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,880
Sho 'nuff!

215
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,880
What have you two been up to?

216
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,840
What do you mean? We were in pursuit.

217
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
- I saw you kiss her.
- I didn't. She kissed me.

218
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,080
It looked mutual to me.
Wipe that lipstick off...

219
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey, go spit, Riggs.

220
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
Are you okay?

221
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,960
Are you all right?

222
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,160
Back to bed. Back to bed.

223
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,440
Good morning, guys. Daddy.

224
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,320
How about treating your dad
to breakfast today?

225
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,920
- You've got six more days to go.
- Laundry service.

226
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,360
Hold this. Hangers?

227
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,800
I'm springing for the soap.
Nothing too fancy. Cute dog.

228
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,560
It's a Westie.

229
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,400
'Morning, Trish.

230
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,360
'Morning, Rog.

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
- Good morning, Nick.
- Spare me.

232
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,800
- What, you didn't brush your teeth?
- Hold it, mister.

233
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,720
Just looking for some orange juice.

234
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,440
Don't get any fingerprints on the door
and put the glass in the dishwasher.

235
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,160
Did somebody commit a murder?

236
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Someone's coming to see the house.

237
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,440
A little mess adds to the charm.

238
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,000
How's this?

239
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,040
Isn't this great? Okay?

240
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,480
Kelly's Pool Hall.

241
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,440
Right, Kelly, hi. Let me speak to Dad.

242
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,360
Hi, honey. How are you?
I thought I asked you not to call me here.

243
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,960
- It's for you.
- Me?

244
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,560
Who is it? Hello?

245
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,280
{y:i}Hi. It's my first day at work. Are you
{y:i}going to come by and wish me luck?

246
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,480
- Beautiful, huh? Come on, check it out.
- Beautiful lawn.

247
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,840
It's great.

248
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,040
See how quiet it is here? Listen.

249
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,680
Isn't that great? Come on.

250
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,840
- It's quiet.
- The inside's even better.

251
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,600
- It's the people to look at the house.
- And our broker.

252
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,880
Just want to make sure.

253
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,200
I'll show you this room first.
It's my favorite.

254
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
Is that it? Does that say it all?

255
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,120
It's very nice.

256
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,120
I love that picture window.

257
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,640
- It's just been completely replaced.
- Why?

258
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,760
A drug dealer came through with his car
and crashed right in.

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,480
Shot up the whole place.

260
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,760
Son of a bitch!
I'm going to cut him off at the knees.

261
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,160
It's true. It's true. True.
Okay, anyway, look.

262
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,680
Do you like the drapes?
Maybe she'll leave them.

263
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,600
- I thought you quit.
- I did.

264
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,360
- You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.
- I'm itching to.

265
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,280
Here.

266
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,880
Chew on these.

267
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,800
I have to tell you this. It's the law.
It's called "full disclosure".

268
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,400
Anything else you want to disclose
before we go on?

269
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,840
Now that you mention it, the bathroom
has been completely remodeled...

270
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,720
...due to unexpected bomb damage.

271
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,280
Hey, come on. It's okay.

272
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,800
Son of a bitch!

273
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,080
Don't, don't. You'll never sell the house.

274
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,440
Okay. We saw enough of the kitchen.
I'll show you the upstairs.

275
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,920
Wait till you see it.
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

276
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,200
They're gone. Leo Getz,
I'm going to kill him.

277
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,640
Son of a bitch. I'm going to kill him!

278
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,280
You have to let me, Riggs!

279
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,400
They weren't going to buy it anyway!

280
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,560
- You scared them away!
- They couldn't afford to buy it!

281
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,080
- Oh, I see.
- Okay, relax.

282
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,520
I had to tell them everything.
It's the law. "Full disclosure."

283
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,720
- You must have heard of it?
- I'm a cop. I'm the law!

284
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,480
- Get off me! What is it with you?
- Hold it!

285
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Okay, okay.

286
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,800
At least he didn't tell them
about the nail-gun incident.

287
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,040
I forgot. Did you have a permit
when you built over the garage?

288
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,240
Permit?

289
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,760
Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,840
I'll make some calls.
We'll get some back-dated permits.

291
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,960
- Which phone can I use?
- Sunroom.

292
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,520
- It must be easier than this.
- Count on Leo Getz.

293
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,960
You need less aggravation.
Come to work with me.

294
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch.

295
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,520
Did you forget something?

296
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,560
This.

297
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,880
You wear it. You sleep in it. You eat in it.

298
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,760
Okay?

299
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,920
Six more days.

300
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,200
And you...

301
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,240
...keep an eye on him.

302
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
Sure.

303
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,960
She loves me.

304
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Stop fronting yourself.
You know what I'm saying?

305
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
Swing with me and my crew.

306
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,000
- I got school.
- Forget school.

307
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,960
Here comes your pops.

308
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,880
- Later.
- All right, gotcha.

309
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,160
Next time.

310
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,200
- 'Morning, Rog.
- How are you doing?

311
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,600
Hey, Nick?

312
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,400
- Wasn't that Darryl?
- Yeah.

313
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,240
I haven't seen him around in a while.

314
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,920
He dropped out of high school.

315
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,120
Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.

316
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,680
Yeah, I know.

317
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,800
Hey, Nick?

318
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,960
Yeah, Dad?

319
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,800
Be good.

320
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,400
Word.

321
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,000
"Word", Nick.

322
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,840
Word.

323
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,360
"Word", Riggs.

324
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,160
"Word", Rog.

325
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
- What are we talking about?
- "Word."

326
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,280
Four letters. Starts with a "W",
"O" in the middle, "D" at the end.

327
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,640
Oh, yeah, that word.

328
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,320
"Word."

329
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,680
- Tyrone, my man, how are you?
- Jack, how's it going?

330
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,880
- Let's take a walk.
- Wait here for me.

331
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,640
Look around. This is my dream
and it's all coming true.

332
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,240
You sank your money into this,
out here in the middle of the desert?

333
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,680
- Know why it'll be a gold mine?
- Do tell.

334
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,440
Because no one wants to live
next door to a menace like you.

335
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I came to do business,
not to be insulted by you.

336
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,280
Relax, Tyrone.

337
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,000
Like houses,
friendships need strong foundations.

338
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,080
Smitty, come here. Come here.

339
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,080
What's wrong with you?
Don't I pay you good and take care of you?

340
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,560
- Sure you do.
- What about the stunt you and Billy pulled?

341
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,760
- It was a good plan. It worked.
- It worked? It didn't work.

342
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,520
You got nailed, first time out.

343
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,440
Nobody who works for me
goes into business for themselves.

344
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,480
Do you understand me?
See how that can jeopardize everything?

345
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,840
- Right?
- Whatever.

346
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,560
Especially trying to pop an armored car.

347
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,120
Okay, Billy got caught.
There's nothing I can do about that now.

348
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,800
He'll have to face the music on his own.

349
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,520
But you and me...

350
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
...we're gonna start over.

351
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,680
You know what I mean?

352
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,640
- Whatever you say.
- Good.

353
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,800
Glad you understand
what I'm talking about.

354
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,120
Now we've got a relationship
we can build on.

355
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,800
- Employee problems. You know how it is?
- Yeah, right.

356
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,360
You invest time and energy
into training somebody.

357
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,080
Then they get greedy and do something
stupid that jeopardizes everything.

358
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
It's a bitch!

359
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,640
Stick around. This is the good part.

360
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,960
We can put our initials in there.

361
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,040
Jesus Christ!

362
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,440
Lankershim and Vineland.
Where are we going?

363
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,160
Right here. Rianne's got a new job.
I promised her I'd stop by.

364
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,520
That's a good reason.

365
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,800
All right. Here we are.

366
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
- You got any silver, any change?
- We're cops.

367
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,280
That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.
I'll get change.

368
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,320
Get down! All of you!

369
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,400
Get down!

370
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,280
How do you like me?

371
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,720
What are you doing with a rubber gun?

372
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,080
This is a film.

373
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,200
Cut, cut! Who the fuck is this lunatic?

374
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,800
- Get him off my set.
- This isn't part of the story.

375
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,320
- Where did you come from?
- Can we get a cop on set?

376
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,640
Rianne, I'm so sorry.
I feel like a microbe right now.

377
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,520
- You really thought I was in trouble?
- I did.

378
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,280
A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.

379
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
- Are you a fucking idiot?
- I apologize.

380
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,920
He's a friend of mine, a policeman.
He thought I was in trouble.

381
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
We're both...

382
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
He's a friend of yours?

383
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,880
Let me tell you something:
You're fired. Have a nice day.

384
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
Fired? Riggs, what'd you do?

385
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,800
You're not fired.

386
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,160
No, you're not. Just take it easy.

387
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
You can't fire her for something I did.

388
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,720
I don't care whose mistake it was.
She's fired.

389
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
I apologize to everyone.

390
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Don't push him!

391
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760
All of you, go!

392
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,680
Just take it easy. Don't push him.

393
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,960
Get off my set, all right?
What are you, deaf?

394
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Get off my set!

395
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,440
On any normal day,
I'd smack you in the mouth.

396
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,480
Is that so?

397
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,360
Don't!

398
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,280
It's a normal day.

399
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay? I'm sorry.

400
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,440
I'm all thumbs. He fell down.
Let me help you.

401
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,080
I said don't hit him!

402
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,040
- Is she fired?
- Yes, she's fired.

403
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,400
- Is she fired?
- No, no.

404
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,240
- It's okay.
- Does she get a raise?

405
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
- Yes. I said, "yes".
- Good.

406
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,200
Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.

407
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,800
We'd like you to come back.

408
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,800
You can't settle every problem
with your fists.

409
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,920
- I couldn't use my gun with that crowd.
- Six more days.

410
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,720
I don't want to hear that anymore.

411
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,520
Did Rianne get her job back?
Did she get a raise?

412
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
I don't hear a "thank you".

413
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,720
Maybe I should become a Hollywood agent.
What do you think?

414
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,560
- It won't work.
- Why?

415
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,720
You don't have that killer instinct.

416
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,800
Son of a bitch!

417
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,920
- We should've put a bag on the meter.
- I'll put it in the glove compartment.

418
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,520
I don't do that anymore.

419
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh, yeah? Good man.

420
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,840
It's full. Put it in the back seat.

421
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,720
- You really like those things?
- These? They're good.

422
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,120
You can eat a box of them
and still be dying for a cigarette.

423
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
- Did you cut yourself shaving?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,880
Old razor?

425
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,760
Old face.

426
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,840
You're letting this retirement thing
get you down.

427
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,800
Spend a few more years
getting used to the idea. Why quit?

428
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,600
- I've got plans for my retirement.
- Oh, yeah, plans.

429
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,400
- I do. Big plans.
- Big plans?

430
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
- I've had them for a long time.
- Like what?

431
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,240
Like...

432
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,680
- Things, man.
- Things.

433
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,720
Things.

434
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
Things I've put off for too long.

435
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
Oh, those things. I've got those, too.

436
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,520
I see you've given this a lot of thought.

437
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,360
Yeah.

438
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,080
I've given it a lot of thought.

439
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,520
Goddamn it!

440
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,680
- What's going on?
- I'm pissed off. You need a reason?

441
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,560
- I thought I heard gunfire.
- Get your hearing checked! Put that away!

442
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,960
What are you looking at?

443
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Hey, man. Peace.

444
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,680
Why'd you call us down here?

445
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,640
How are you doing, son?

446
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,600
Does your mother know you're here?

447
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,800
- Did you do this?
- Nice shooting.

448
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Better than Billy the Kid.

449
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,080
Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?

450
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,240
Give it to your mom.
Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.

451
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,360
- Can I borrow your glasses?
- Yeah.

452
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Who's wearing?

453
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,000
Roger, you are.

454
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,920
Why me? You guys should be wearing.

455
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,680
Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.

456
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,680
I don't need help.
I've been dressing myself since I was 30.

457
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
- Okay, man, just trying to help.
- Get back.

458
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,720
All you perverts, turn your heads.

459
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,360
- Take it off, baby.
- Hold this shirt.

460
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,120
You're wearing a girdle.

461
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
- He's got a girdle.
- This is not a girdle.

462
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,280
This is not a girdle. It's my back.

463
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,240
My back went out on me.

464
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,080
I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
What are you talking about?

465
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,440
I saw him do it.

466
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,960
Everybody, listen up.

467
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,840
I want you all to look at these.
Lovely bullets.

468
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,640
Cute.

469
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,760
Notice the smooth jacket.
Pay particular attention to the tip.

470
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,880
Now, you've all seen these vests stop
a.357 Magnum bullet.

471
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,360
Observe.

472
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,760
Son of a bitch.

473
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,160
- Armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah, cop killers.

474
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,080
Those bullets came from the gun
of a suspect we arrested yesterday.

475
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,160
They're out there on the streets.

476
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Vests are optional, boys and girls.
Especially boys.

477
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,400
See you, Riggs.

478
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,240
Cop killers.

479
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,960
Son of a bitch.

480
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,760
I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.
I'll have him brought in for interrogation.

481
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,800
I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.

482
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,680
- Can I see your ID, please?
- Sure.

483
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,120
William Phelps, armored car suspect.
He's been moved to Interrogation.

484
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,680
- Do you know where that is?
- Sure. I've been there a lot.

485
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,360
Same floor.

486
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,640
I guess now you're retiring, that Swiss
bank account will come in pretty handy.

487
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
How much you got in there, $1 million?
$1.5 million?

488
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,320
- $5 million.
- $5 million?

489
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,240
Well, you deserve it.

490
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,840
It's better than those
miserable drug dealers getting it.

491
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,080
What are you talking about?

492
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,040
Don't sweat it. You laundered it,
didn't you? They can't trace it.

493
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,920
- They can't trace it.
- What?

494
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,200
So long as I get an invite
to "casa de" Murtaugh, I'm happy.

495
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
"Casa" what?

496
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,840
- I've never been to Portugal.
- Stop joking.

497
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,960
She's a cop.

498
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,920
I know she's a cop.
She's probably on the take, too.

499
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,880
The whole Force is bent.

500
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,600
She may be wearing a skirt,
but we're all brothers.

501
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,040
You know I have nothing.
I ain't been to Portugal.

502
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,760
Listen to me.

503
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,440
Son of a bitch.

504
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,400
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

505
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,080
- Who is it today?
- Billy Phelps.

506
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,000
Who are you?

507
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,320
Fly me. I'm your friendly
Portuguese airline.

508
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,760
She's Infernal Affairs.

509
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,800
How'd you know?

510
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,480
I took the liberty
of looking at your file folder.

511
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,520
Lorna Cole.

512
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,440
- And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.
- I used to be.

513
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,480
What's Infernal Repairs
want with our collar?

514
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,040
We're taking over, thanks.

515
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,040
Nobody told us they were taking over.

516
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,320
Nobody has to tell you anything,
Patrolman.

517
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,280
I want to go and see the captain.

518
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,000
You want to see the captain?
Let's go see the captain.

519
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,680
- And put on a vest.
- Oh, are you wearing one?

520
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,400
Just take it easy, man.

521
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,520
Hey, guys. Phelps, William.
Actually, his name's Billy.

522
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,880
You, too?

523
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,960
- Popular guy today.
- Somebody with him?

524
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,120
No, not really.
He's down the hall to the right.

525
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,720
Want to sign in here, Sarge?

526
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,200
Miss.

527
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,880
- What's Internal Affairs doing here?
- Don't start. I just found out myself.

528
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,280
This is Herman Walters,
Chief of Intelligence.

529
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,440
You haven't met his daughter,
Lorna Doone.

530
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,760
Pleased to meet you.

531
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,720
The Phelps case has been transferred
to Internal Affairs.

532
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,640
Why?

533
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,680
- I can't tell you.
- That's classified.

534
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,280
We busted our buns busting this guy.
We busted him.

535
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,920
Busted is right.
He spent the night in the hospital.

536
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,040
- He didn't buckle up.
- We even cited him.

537
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,000
I know, I read your report.

538
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,520
Our cases have, unfortunately,
crossed paths here.

539
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,960
That's all I can say.
We'll take over from here.

540
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,280
Captain, what is she talking about here?

541
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,960
- That's classified.
- No, I'm talking to him.

542
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,240
I'm telling you...

543
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,880
No, I said, "Captain".
I'm talking to the captain.

544
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,880
- That's classified.
- I'm talking to him.

545
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,960
That's bullshit!

546
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,120
Maybe these guys
can contribute something to this case?

547
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,120
From their records,
they only contribute mayhem and chaos.

548
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,520
No, I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.
We're a double act.

549
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,800
What are we,
required reading or something?

550
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,480
As a matter of fact, you are.

551
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,240
It's a cross between "Police Gazette"
and "Mad" magazine.

552
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,160
- What's wrong with "Mad"?
- Nothing, I used to read it...

553
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,760
You've got some taste.

554
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
...when I was 12.

555
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,800
- Riggs, let's go.
- I'm out of here.

556
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,840
We busted him, we can talk to him.

557
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,120
- Captain.
- Riggs. Murtaugh.

558
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,840
Get your asses back here.

559
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,600
You'll be needing these.

560
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm reinstating both of you.

561
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,560
- Don't you just love him?
- Yeah.

562
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,280
God!

563
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,360
You really are a beautiful man.

564
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,840
Just get rid of the blues.

565
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,280
- They don't go with your ponytail.
- Absolutely not.

566
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,280
Yeah, right.

567
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,360
Get a haircut!

568
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,680
Of course, I won't.

569
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,800
You've exceeded your authority, Captain.

570
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,800
- That's not how I see it.
- That's how the chief will see it.

571
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,920
- Take it up with him.
- I think I will.

572
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,400
Catch up with them. We don't want this
screwed up with cowboy tactics.

573
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,240
Son of a bitch.

574
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,560
Hi, Billy.

575
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,800
Jack.

576
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,560
'Bye, Billy.

577
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,480
See you, Billy.

578
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,200
Sergeant, did you get what you need?

579
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,240
Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.

580
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,360
How long has Phelps been doing this?

581
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,240
- Doing what?
- This armored-car thing.

582
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,800
I wouldn't know.
I'm not interested in armored cars.

583
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320
I don't think she's telling us everything.

584
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,680
I think you're right.

585
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,280
Boy, these six days are going to be rough.

586
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,760
God, be good to me, please.

587
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,320
Shit, son of a bitch knew there was
a camera in the wall.

588
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,240
Damn it!

589
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,920
He didn't know there was one
in the interrogation room.

590
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,840
There isn't.

591
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,720
We installed them six months ago.

592
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,400
- Every station.
- That's great.

593
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,400
Six months and we don't know about it?

594
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,360
This is the "police police", Captain.

595
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,160
"Police police." Very good. Can you say
that three times in a row, real fast?

596
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,840
- Why? Am I getting to you?
- Are you trying to bait me?

597
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,200
I'm a master at it.

598
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,320
That figures.

599
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,960
Baiting master. Great, man,
try all the tricks.

600
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,720
Freeze that. Stop it.

601
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,280
Jack Travis.

602
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,280
Who?

603
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.

604
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,720
He was one of us.

605
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,880
Hell of a brutal cop.
He could beat a confession out of anyone.

606
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,400
One hell of a dirty cop.

607
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,120
I've never seen so many suspensions
and reprimands and charges of misconduct.

608
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,600
He's also as tough as they come.

609
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,960
What happened to him?

610
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,160
I don't know.

611
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,040
His partner and him were on a stakeout.
He went for coffee, never came back.

612
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,640
Looks like he's had
one cappuccino too many.

613
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,560
We'd better brief Walters.

614
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,760
Excuse me, cute stuff.

615
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,040
- That's harassment.
- "Cute stuff." That's you.

616
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,520
- Captain.
- Boys. It's just the captain.

617
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,000
Your involvement in this case ended
when Phelps hit the floor.

618
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,200
Why don't you just go back
and beat your street?

619
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,200
- Now's the time to buy.
- Not now.

620
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,280
- Hey, Roger.
- Not now, Leo.

621
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,840
- Not now!
- We got to talk, babe, okay?

622
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
You're in trouble. You've got termites.

623
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
Termites?

624
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,520
- Oh, God!
- You're infested!

625
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,080
The only thing holding up your house
is the paint.

626
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,200
We should go.

627
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,280
Leo, could you get the place fumigated?

628
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,640
We should pull every file on this guy.

629
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,000
I know this guy.
Are you watching "Geraldo"?

630
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,520
- What?
- I know the guy.

631
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,200
- How do you know him?
- I've seen the guy before.

632
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
- Where?
- I don't know. I recognize him...

633
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,800
His name is Jack Travis.
Does that ring a bell?

634
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Hands off the clothes. Okay?

635
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,600
I'm thinking. Let me think.

636
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,200
It was a big party.

637
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,520
Someone brought a monkey
that knocked over the salad bar.

638
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,800
And this guy comes in
and introduces me to another guy...

639
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,000
...who wants a favor.

640
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,760
- I got it!
- What?

641
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,040
He's got it!

642
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,160
- I remember!
- You remember!

643
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,280
Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.

644
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,560
- We're back. We're back!
- Yeah.

645
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,640
Listen. Can I have a gun this time?

646
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Okay, this is it! These guys always
wanted me to do favors for them!

647
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,160
Like, some guys wanted broads,
another guy wanted Cuban cigars.

648
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
Your guy, hockey.

649
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,520
The best seats in the house.

650
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,240
- Where're the seats?
- Yeah?

651
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,720
Probably by the glass.

652
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,320
Does "needle in a haystack"
mean anything to you?

653
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
Why don't we spread out?

654
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,360
If we all take a different direction,
it'd be like old times.

655
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,240
Don't push, lady.
I'm on police business here.

656
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,680
Just take it easy.

657
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,000
{y:i}Los Angeles penalty. Number 15.

658
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,960
{y:i}Two minutes for high-sticking.

659
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,720
{y:i}Time, 5:15.

660
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,880
{y:i}Mr. Jack Travis?

661
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,880
{y:i}Mr. Jack Travis, this is the LAPD.

662
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,440
{y:i}We know you're in here.

663
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,720
{y:i}We know where you are.
{y:i}Just stay in your seat.

664
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,240
{y:i}Don't be stupid.

665
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,600
{y:i}I'll be there to escort you out in a minute.

666
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,840
{y:i}There's a policeman at every exit,
{y:i}so it's no use trying to run.

667
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,040
Smart son of a bitch.

668
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,560
{y:i}Just stay where you are.

669
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,360
{y:i}Thanks for your cooperation.
{y:i}Play on, boys.

670
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,320
Come on, let's go!

671
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,440
Get out of my fucking way!

672
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,360
Excuse me.

673
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,120
You can't be on the ice!

674
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,440
I got him!

675
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,600
You have the right... You're under arrest!

676
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,440
Fucking weasel!

677
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,360
What the hell's going on here?

678
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,120
I'm LAPD!

679
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,080
I don't care. You can't be on the ice.

680
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,800
I got him!

681
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,520
You're all right, pal. Stay calm.

682
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,280
Make sure you tell my mother.

683
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,600
Where'd he go?

684
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,520
Down there.

685
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,920
Son of a bitch!

686
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,400
He thinks I don't know I'm dying.
I know it.

687
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,640
- You'll be okay.
- I'm dying, Roger.

688
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm choking, see?

689
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
This is what they do when they die.

690
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,120
Leo, it's going to be okay.

691
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,080
My body's numb. I can't feel it.

692
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,160
I'm going to die, I know it. What?

693
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,600
You're lying on the ice.

694
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,040
- That's why I'm cold?
- That's why you're cold.

695
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,480
- That's why I'm numb?
- That's why you're numb.

696
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,520
But he shot me. Look at all the blood.

697
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,640
- It's just a flesh wound.
- So it's okay.

698
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,280
He's okay. He's going to make it.
He's alive!

699
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,320
- Bring him this way.
- I can't believe this.

700
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,400
- I can't believe I got shot.
- Calm down.

701
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,680
Riggs, are you here?

702
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,440
We're all the same now. We all got shot.

703
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,200
You'll be fine.

704
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,080
Relax.

705
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.
I can take this.

706
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Calm down. We'll take care of it.
You'll be out of here tonight.

707
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,400
It's no big deal.

708
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,120
That's not a good idea.
You shouldn't rush this, Doc.

709
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
You should rest up.

710
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,400
A dum-dum wound can be serious.

711
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,400
What's a "dum-dum wound"?

712
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,320
You don't know? A guy on the Force
got his thumb shot off by a dum-dum.

713
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,600
From the shock,
he was dead two days later.

714
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,160
"Dead two days later"?

715
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,720
He died from dum-dums?

716
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,200
- We'll keep you overnight.
- Make it two.

717
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,280
Two days?

718
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,200
Okay, we'll keep him in two days.

719
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,920
Is that Leo's chart?

720
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,160
- Two days, then you'll be as good as new.
- I should be with them.

721
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,560
I should be with...

722
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,360
How do you spell, "proctological"?

723
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,280
Rectal exam?

724
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,160
- No, you can't do that to Leo.
- Sure, we can.

725
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,160
Why's she...

726
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,040
Please, Mr. Getz.

727
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,400
You've been shot in the arm?
Let her take it. You'll get it back.

728
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,040
There's a clock in your room.

729
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,920
Does this look like a "dum-dum wound"?

730
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,400
- It sounded like one when it happened.
- Shit.

731
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,360
- Take it easy. Two days.
- Two days and you'll be out. No problem.

732
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,200
- I'll see you guys.
- We won't make a move without you.

733
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,400
I thought that bullet sounded different.

734
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,160
- Relax. They'll be there when you get out.
- I'm fine.

735
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,160
- You own your house, Doc?
- What?

736
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,160
- You don't recognize my face?
- No, sir.

737
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,080
Watch.

738
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,800
It's about time.

739
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,680
These doggy treats are okay,
but I need some human food.

740
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,160
Don't worry. I'll make you the best thing
you've ever had.

741
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,840
Good.

742
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,080
- You ever eaten one of my hamburgers?
- I've been lucky so far.

743
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,360
Hey, Fast Eddie.

744
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,680
- How's business?
- Booming. Can't you tell?

745
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,200
Yeah, I'm looking at it.
Did you meet my partner?

746
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,880
I want to cook one
of those monster burgers for him.

747
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,440
- Go for it.
- All right.

748
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,800
You'll let him cook?

749
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,560
- Do I have a choice?
- No, because it's Wednesday.

750
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,400
He's too big to argue with.

751
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,440
In that case, give me a MacRog.

752
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,320
Hold the hair.

753
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,720
Did you wash your hands?

754
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,320
Keep joking. But I guarantee
you're gonna like this burger...

755
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,200
...and you're gonna come back
with your friends.

756
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,720
I haven't got any friends,
you know that, except you.

757
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,440
He's a comedian in his spare time.

758
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,560
When is he gonna say something funny?

759
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,120
Are you gonna put that out?

760
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,880
You're finished with it, yeah?

761
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,280
Do you mind? Thanks.

762
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,840
Sorry. I was just looking at it.

763
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,600
Chew on this onion.

764
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,240
He's quitting, so help him.

765
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,640
I was only looking at it.

766
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,480
The first thing is the fat.

767
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,040
Everyone says, "Cut the fat".

768
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,200
My uncle said, "You cut the fat,
you kill the burger". Right?

769
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,920
Yeah.

770
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,880
There's an art to it.
You just can't plop this on the grill.

771
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,400
Gently coax the flavors out.

772
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,520
Hey, what's the problem?

773
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,880
A little pepper,
then you massage it a little bit.

774
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,200
Just a little bit.

775
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,280
"Sweet, sweet meat"

776
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,600
Shit, man, feel it.

777
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,840
Okay, guys!

778
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,680
LAPD. Let me see your hands.

779
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,040
Let me see your hands. Get them up!

780
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,320
In the car! Get them up there!
Let me see both of them! Come on!

781
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,560
Hey, Riggs!

782
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,080
Don't you love me? Five days.

783
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,560
Don't do that to me.

784
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,520
- Riggs, are you okay?
- Yeah.

785
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,480
Who did it?

786
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,520
All right, asshole!

787
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,400
I want to see your hands, right now!

788
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,960
Back me up, Riggs.

789
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,880
Darryl?

790
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,400
Fuck, no!

791
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,520
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance! Breathe!

792
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,440
Please, breathe.

793
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,800
Breathe!

794
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,600
Call an ambulance!

795
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,880
Come on! Breathe! Oh, God!

796
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,120
Fuck, it's Darryl!

797
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,360
Oh, God, don't do this to me! Breathe!

798
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,920
- He's dead.
- Breathe!

799
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,480
- God, don't do this!
- He's dead.

800
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,840
Rog, he's dead!

801
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,600
He's dead, Rog.
Don't mess with the corpse.

802
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,800
He's dead. Come on, man,
it was a clean shoot.

803
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
It's okay, it was a clean shoot.

804
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,120
He was gonna do you
and he was gonna do me.

805
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,400
It's okay. Are you okay?

806
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,080
It's not okay.

807
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,240
I know that kid.

808
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,760
I know that kid.

809
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,120
He's Nick's friend.

810
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,720
- I got it, Mom.
- I'll get it.

811
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,120
Hello?

812
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,040
Hi, Martin.

813
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,040
He's not here.

814
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh, my God!

815
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,160
Thanks.

816
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,760
Fuck!

817
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,960
How are you doing? Taking your vitamins?

818
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,480
- Riggs, how's Murtaugh?
- He's good. He's fine.

819
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,480
- I'm sure he's anything but fine.
- Really, he's okay.

820
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,960
- I'd really like to talk to him.
- That's not such a good idea.

821
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,240
The best thing to do is to leave him alone.

822
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,920
- Let's get something for your cold.
- I know what I'm talking about.

823
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,920
- We have to talk.
- Talking to you is bad for my image.

824
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,040
- I'm afraid I insist.
- Oh, you insist?

825
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,520
In that case, let's find someplace private.
Step into my orifice.

826
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,520
- Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
- Hey, Riggs.

827
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,680
- Clip any wrong wires lately?
- I haven't done that for a couple of days.

828
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,840
Next time, wait for the bomb squad.

829
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,040
Yeah, it's our job.

830
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,600
I'll remember that.
We saved a cat, though.

831
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,040
Great. I love cats.

832
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,960
Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.

833
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,160
You purposefully withheld information
concerning a case under my investigation.

834
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,520
Damn right, I did.

835
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,600
Careful, she's Internal Affairs.

836
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,520
You had a tip on Travis.
You should have shared it with me.

837
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,840
No, I take that back.

838
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,400
You were required to share it with me.

839
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,960
I was "required" to share it with you?

840
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,040
I don't have to share shit with you.

841
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,440
Schoolyard rules: If you don't scratch
my back, I don't throw you...

842
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,480
- Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that!
- Yes, you can!

843
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,840
Why don't you cut out
this classified bullshit!

844
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,000
Right now! It's giving me the shits!

845
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,600
We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.
We're both on the same side, right?

846
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,720
- Right?
- Right!

847
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,400
Good! Why don't we start to act like it?

848
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,760
There are kids out there.
Babies. No brains.

849
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,600
But they got automatic weapons.

850
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,440
- Yesterday, my partner nailed this kid...
- I know about Murtaugh.

851
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,080
And I'm sorry, Riggs.

852
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,720
Yeah.

853
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,600
Why don't you let me in on this?
I can help you.

854
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,880
I really want to help you,
if you'll let me. Let me.

855
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,600
What do you say? Have we got a deal?

856
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,720
Wash your hands...

857
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,440
...and meet me in my office.

858
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,360
I'll be right there.

859
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,400
I'll be right there.

860
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,360
MAC-10, 9-mm, semi-automatic...

861
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,520
...converted to automatic
with 36 rounds in the magazine.

862
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,440
"On a sesame seed bun."

863
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,960
Very illegal.

864
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
That gun has a history.
Wanna know about it?

865
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,800
Tell me.

866
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,080
"Killed a convenience store clerk
in LA County, July 1990."

867
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,480
"Used in a drive-by shooting
in San Bernardino County, August 1990."

868
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,360
"Confiscated by a truant officer
of the LA School Board, October 1990."

869
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,920
Scheduled for destruction by the LAPD
six weeks ago.

870
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,480
"Scheduled" for destruction.

871
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,880
But it never got there.

872
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,120
Instead, it found its way
into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...

873
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,640
...who fired it on a police officer,
your partner.

874
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,280
I thought it looked familiar.

875
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,320
That gun and 15,000 others like it...

876
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,040
...were stolen from a police storage facility
before they could be destroyed.

877
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,840
They should be paper clips right now,
or license plates.

878
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,440
Anything but a gun. Here we are
busting our asses on the streets...

879
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,560
...getting these weapons out of circulation
and now they're headed back out.

880
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,240
By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto
something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.

881
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,920
That's why Internal Affairs is onto this.
They think this is an inside job.

882
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,200
That's right. They knew police procedures.

883
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,880
They knew where the guns were stored
and how to get in.

884
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,600
They even knew the sorting codes
on the containers...

885
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,640
...because they took the automatics
and left the junk behind.

886
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,960
- It all pointed to a cop.
- Or an ex-cop.

887
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,960
Right.

888
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,640
Travis.

889
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,480
And you let him slip through your fingers.

890
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,400
That's closer than you ever got.

891
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,960
Close, Riggs?

892
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,520
Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window.

893
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,040
Do you want to go for a ride?

894
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,080
Sure, where are we going?

895
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,120
It's a surprise.

896
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,320
Oh, I love surprises.

897
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,480
What is this place?

898
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,200
I accessed Billy Phelps'phone records
on my computer.

899
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,320
He made a dozen calls to this address.

900
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,800
That was nice of you
to steal that information.

901
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,520
- Semantics, Riggs.
- "Semantics"?

902
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,160
I'm always up for some antics.

903
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,160
Let's go on three.

904
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,200
One.

905
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,440
- On three, or three and then go?
- What?

906
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,160
Never mind. One, two, three.

907
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,800
I've got you.

908
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,880
It looks like Billy's grandmother
owns a big dog.

909
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,840
It's not a dog. It's a horse.

910
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,200
I hate dogs, Riggs.

911
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,520
I don't get it.

912
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,080
You don't get what?
It's a dog. It's a fucking dog.

913
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,640
I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window." I don't get it.

914
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,400
Later.

915
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,200
What are you doing?

916
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,360
I can't shoot a dog.
People, okay, but not dogs.

917
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,760
I should try to make friends with him.

918
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,080
"Make friends"?

919
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,240
Now don't run, because he'll only
chase you down and kill you.

920
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,280
Here, boy.

921
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,040
Here, boy.

922
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,560
Shit!

923
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,480
Good boy.

924
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,440
Riggs?

925
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,760
You're crazy.

926
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,960
Want some?

927
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,680
Are you hungry?

928
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,360
You're a hungry boy.

929
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,320
Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.

930
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,760
Here's one. Leave some for me.

931
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,400
Very slowly, as if you're not here,
just walk away.

932
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,720
You want me to go?

933
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,560
Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.

934
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,160
"Guy sort of thing"?

935
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,160
Are you all alone in here?

936
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,040
Stay, stay.

937
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,680
Come on, let's go.

938
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,640
How many is that?

939
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,560
- Fifty-five.
- Fifty-five. All right, we've got eight more.

940
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,200
We'll get these later. Let's go.

941
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,240
Hi, fellas.

942
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,640
What's in all these boxes?

943
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:37,680
Easy, let's not kill him, yet.
Let's see who he is first, all right?

944
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,800
You have the right to remain silent.

945
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,840
Shut him up!

946
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,480
"Sergeant Martin Riggs."

947
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,840
- Get the truck ready.
- Right.

948
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,640
So, Sergeant Riggs...

949
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,280
...how did you find us?

950
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,840
Freeze! Police!

951
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,520
Another one?

952
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,280
We need a new fucking dog.

953
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,280
Get your hands up, asshole.

954
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,240
Get them up!

955
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,400
A little bit higher.

956
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,680
That's better.

957
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,680
Very good.

958
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,720
Drop it, miss.

959
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,920
Now, look!

960
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,200
Okay, I'm on! No, wait!

961
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Wait, wait!

962
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,400
Sergeant Cole!

963
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,760
Get down!

964
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,480
Get those cases and kill that dog!

965
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,240
Stop!

966
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,080
The dog.

967
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,280
- Where'd you learn to fight?
- Catholic school. Forget the dog!

968
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,280
Here, boy! We're waiting for the dog!

969
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,440
Hold it.

970
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,840
Come on, dog!

971
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,840
Good dog. Good puppy. Go!

972
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,920
Stop!

973
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:48,920
What?

974
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,640
- It's full of guns.
- Grab one!

975
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,400
- You grab one!
- Chicken.

976
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,000
Step on it.

977
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,400
Get that crate! Come on!

978
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,400
{y:i}Hatchett, you said not to worry about
{y:i}the police, but the cops are all over you!

979
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,000
They got my guns.
They'll come after me, next!

980
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,280
As far as I'm concerned, the deal's off!

981
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,320
Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone.
We have a deal.

982
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,520
Nobody backs out.

983
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,720
{y:i}You said you had the cops under control.

984
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,960
I see that isn't so. Give me one reason...

985
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,920
{y:i}... why I should do business with you.

986
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,600
I'll give you a good reason.

987
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,400
Tyrone, this is Travis.

988
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,640
You back out now, and I'll make sure
only your dentist can identify the body.

989
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,760
Is that a good enough reason for you?

990
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,880
But I need ammo.

991
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm out of business without ammo.

992
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,520
I need the good stuff.

993
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,000
You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.

994
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,640
"The good stuff." Jesus.

995
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,560
Time to pay another visit to the LAPD.

996
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,240
You look like I feel.

997
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
Have you got anything
I can put on my head?

998
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,120
There's a hat in the closet.

999
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,000
You're all heart. Here, I thought
you'd get all tender and maternal.

1000
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,000
I was raised with four brothers.

1001
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:21,560
We got hurt often, but if no bones were
broken or blood gushed, nobody cared.

1002
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,040
Look, blood. See? Blood.

1003
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,600
It's not gushing.

1004
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,160
It was free flowing earlier.

1005
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,400
Could you bring me a needle and thread?
Some peroxide. I'll patch it up myself.

1006
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,040
Don't touch anything.

1007
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,040
I wasn't.

1008
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,320
What's with you?

1009
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,440
What are you doing?

1010
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,120
- I said not to touch anything.
- It came on by itself.

1011
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,240
All by itself? What are you, a wise guy?

1012
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,320
You don't like to share your toys, do you?

1013
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,240
- This isn't a toy.
- What is it?

1014
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,160
- This is a weapon.
- A weapon?

1015
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,480
Used properly, a very effective weapon.

1016
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,480
What, do you throw it at people?

1017
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,280
You'll give yourself a hernia.
Come here. Sit down.

1018
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,480
Right here.

1019
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,840
- Take a little off the top...
- Right here.

1020
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,600
Do you bring all your interrogations home?

1021
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,040
- What are we talking about?
- It's back here.

1022
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,840
- Careful, careful.
- Turn your head.

1023
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,320
- Careful.
- This?

1024
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,960
- This scratch?
- It feels like the Grand Canyon.

1025
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,800
Oh, God.

1026
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,160
Hold still.

1027
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,400
Oh, God. We haven't even started.

1028
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,320
Be gentle with me.

1029
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,840
I see this isn't virgin territory.
What is this? A knife?

1030
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,880
That's an ax.
Some guy mistook my head for a log.

1031
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,640
- That's a natural mistake.
- What, I have a wooden head?

1032
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,160
- Look at that.
- A knife.

1033
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,120
Knife? That's very nice.

1034
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,360
This is all right.

1035
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,880
That's a pavement,
dragged down Crenshaw.

1036
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,920
That's great. Look at that texture.
Look at this.

1037
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,040
Same thing. Third and Highland.

1038
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,840
- Dragged for about half a block.
- That's a good one.

1039
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,120
Feel that texture. Cheese-grater time.

1040
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,160
- Moving truck.
- Moving truck?

1041
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,200
Moving bullet.

1042
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,360
- Moving bullet?
- Here. This is the best.

1043
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,200
- It goes all the way through to the back.
- Right through?

1044
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,920
You're lucky. Was it a.22?

1045
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,520
It's a.38.

1046
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,400
- It's a.38.
- That? That's wimpy. This is a.38.

1047
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,320
Yours is bigger than mine?
I don't think so.

1048
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,720
Maybe not, but look.

1049
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,720
A whole family of.44s on the back.

1050
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,800
There they are.

1051
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,080
That's impressive.

1052
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,440
One hit my lung. I was breathing
blood bubbles. It was disgusting.

1053
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,800
Blood bubbles. Okay.

1054
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,800
You got one?

1055
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,160
Pump-action. 12-gauge.

1056
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,000
Right down here. Went through.

1057
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,600
- That must have hurt.
- Right.

1058
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,640
Not too close.

1059
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,960
Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.

1060
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,440
I can beat it.

1061
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,960
- I'll take your word for it.
- You gotta see this.

1062
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,960
- I believe you.
- This guy had a knife.

1063
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,120
You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg
and ran it around eight times.

1064
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,280
- I'll take your word for it.
- Look!

1065
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,760
No, I said forget it.

1066
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,360
This is a blue-ribbon event.

1067
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,400
Forget it.

1068
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,720
You started this.

1069
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,400
- Yeah, I can end it.
- You know what?

1070
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,440
You're a very poor loser.

1071
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,480
I didn't lose.

1072
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,840
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't lose.

1073
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,240
- You lost.
- I conceded.

1074
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,720
There's a difference between losing
and conceding.

1075
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,680
You conceded or you're conceited?

1076
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,520
- You think I'm conceited?
- Yeah.

1077
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,560
Tell me you lost. Admit to it.

1078
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,960
I'll get you a Band-Aid.

1079
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,240
- Tell me you lost.
- I said don't touch anything...

1080
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,440
You're going to smack
the shit out of me, right?

1081
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,960
I can do better than that.

1082
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,840
This could be a serious ethical breach here.

1083
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,280
I never made it
with another sergeant before.

1084
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,160
Shut up, Riggs.

1085
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,360
{y:i}I'm as hungry as a whale.
{y:i}Bring on the food.

1086
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,600
He's got a sense of humor.

1087
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,160
Watch this. This is a good bit.

1088
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,560
I think you're gonna get on just fine.

1089
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,680
If you could pry yourself away
from doggie heaven, I'm finished out here.

1090
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,360
- You wanna take a look?
- Sure. Let's go outside for some air.

1091
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,720
One for you.

1092
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,240
One for you. No favorites.

1093
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,600
I just have to finish the flashing here...

1094
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,240
...and the roofing shingles
about another few bundles.

1095
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,560
Unless it rains, it should hold up all right.

1096
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,400
That's comforting.

1097
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,840
I like a man who takes pride in his work.

1098
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,720
Do you know where I can find one?

1099
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,000
Like trying to find a cop
when you need one.

1100
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,600
We're not mind readers.

1101
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,520
You have to have a mind to read.

1102
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,720
Read it and weep.

1103
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,360
With these prices
you're promoting graft in the port.

1104
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,640
If there's anybody
who knows about graft, it's you.

1105
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,600
- Hi, Martin.
- How are you doing?

1106
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,120
- Hi, Mickey.
- Hi, Rianne.

1107
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,520
What are you doing here?

1108
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,040
Or shouldn't I ask?

1109
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,120
You got a sink to unplug?

1110
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,920
- I got your sink.
- Good. Go do it.

1111
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,960
I'll see you next week.

1112
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,000
What's up?

1113
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,960
Dad didn't come home last night.

1114
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,160
He always comes home.

1115
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,560
Oh, damn, Riggs.

1116
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,480
What do you want?

1117
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,720
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

1118
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,760
Who sent you? Trish?

1119
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,160
You're doing pretty well.
Trish didn't send me.

1120
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,720
Rianne came to see me.
She asked me to find you.

1121
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,840
To your place?

1122
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,240
Well, that's where I am.

1123
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,160
- My daughter came to your trailer?
- Yeah.

1124
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,480
- My daughter came to your trailer?
- Come on, she was worried.

1125
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,360
Get off of my boat, Riggs!

1126
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,280
- Come on.
- Get off my boat!

1127
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,840
You're drunk.

1128
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,080
That's something you should know about.

1129
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,800
- This isn't going to do you any good.
- Give me that.

1130
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:30,920
Give me that.

1131
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,840
Roger, please don't do this.

1132
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,040
You got three days until you retire.
This won't do you any good.

1133
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,760
You self-righteous bastard! Give it...

1134
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,640
Don't do this, okay? Please?

1135
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,080
Give it to me, damn it.

1136
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,680
What are you going to do now, shoot me?

1137
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,680
There.

1138
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,360
Take your finger out of my bottle.
Give me that gun.

1139
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,760
The bottle's going sailing.

1140
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,960
Son of a bitch!

1141
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,040
Not bad for an old man.

1142
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,320
Are you finished?

1143
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,120
No, I got another bottle in the galley
and I'll get it.

1144
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,320
No, you're not.

1145
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,440
Don't do this to yourself.

1146
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,280
You gotta cut this out.

1147
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,840
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1148
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,120
Come on. Sit down.

1149
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,040
- You hit me.
- Cool it, will you?

1150
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,960
Cut it out. Give it up, okay?

1151
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,160
Go ahead.

1152
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,080
Go ahead. Hit me again.

1153
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,680
I don't want to hit you.
You think I like this shit?

1154
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,360
Hit me again. You think I'm afraid of you...

1155
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,920
- I know you're not.
...and that kung-fu shit?

1156
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,240
Please, Rog.

1157
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,680
That kid was a killer, all right.
That wasn't a toy in his hand.

1158
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,240
That was a machine pistol
with twin carbines and all the trimmings.

1159
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,800
He would have drilled you, me,
anybody that came along.

1160
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,480
You had no choice.

1161
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,800
It didn't happen to you. It happened to me.

1162
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,320
It happened to me!

1163
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,560
My God, I killed that kid!

1164
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,000
I killed that boy.

1165
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,000
You've killed a lot of people.

1166
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,440
You've killed a fucking lot of people!
You don't kill a baby.

1167
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,680
You've got ice in your veins.
You don't kill a boy like Nick.

1168
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,320
You selfish bastard!

1169
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,160
You selfish bastard!

1170
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,560
You're just thinking about yourself.

1171
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,480
What about me?

1172
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,520
We're partners. We are partners.

1173
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,360
What happens to you, happens to me.

1174
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,640
After all the shit we've been through,
don't you get it?

1175
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,880
Don't you get it?

1176
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,280
When you retire, you're not just
retiring you, you're retiring us.

1177
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,560
- You're retiring us.
- That's not my problem.

1178
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,520
Yes, it is.

1179
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,280
- It's not my problem.
- You're the only family I've got.

1180
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,320
I've got three beautiful kids.
I love them and they're yours.

1181
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,560
Trish does my laundry.
I live in your icebox. I live in your life!

1182
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,160
What am I going to do?

1183
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,760
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do.

1184
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,280
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do.

1185
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,520
I don't care!

1186
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,680
Yes, you do!

1187
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,680
- I don't care.
- You do so.

1188
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,800
I don't care!

1189
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:55,480
I don't know what I'm saying anymore.
I don't know what I'm thinking.

1190
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,320
I had three days, and now this.

1191
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,520
I'm sorry.

1192
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,560
- That's all right.
- No, I'm really sorry.

1193
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,120
I didn't realize that my retirement
was gonna screw you up.

1194
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,720
Forget it. I haven't got any problems.
I was out of line saying that shit.

1195
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,080
Look, man...

1196
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,040
Riggs, look...

1197
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,040
You know I love you.

1198
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:25,320
You know I love you, Riggs.
And your problems are my problems.

1199
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,200
Like you said, "What happens to you...

1200
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,520
...happens to me." So try me.

1201
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,480
I'm here for you.

1202
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,200
I haven't got any problems.

1203
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,280
Yes, you do. We all have problems.
You help me...

1204
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,600
...and I'm gonna help you.

1205
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,400
I do have a little problem.

1206
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,880
You don't want to hear it.
This is piddly shit.

1207
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,760
Yes, I do. I want to hear it.

1208
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,840
- Tell me.
- This is ridiculous.

1209
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,840
- You don't want to hear it.
- No. I'm here.

1210
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,840
Well...

1211
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:04,360
I think maybe I slept with someone
that I probably shouldn't have.

1212
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,640
You son of a bitch!

1213
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,000
Help me.

1214
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,360
I ought to let you drown, you traitor.

1215
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,600
Help me.

1216
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,800
Come on in.

1217
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,480
What did you hit me for?

1218
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,760
'Cause you slept with Rianne.

1219
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,800
I did not.

1220
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,280
- Who did you sleep with?
- I slept with Sergeant Cole.

1221
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,960
Sergeant Cole from Traffic?

1222
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,080
No, not Sergeant Cole from Traffic.

1223
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,120
Lorna. Sergeant Cole from Traffic
is her uncle.

1224
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,320
- Okay. That's okay.
- Oh, I don't know.

1225
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,640
Sheriff's Department.

1226
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,680
Sheriff...

1227
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,240
We're LAPD.

1228
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,880
What are you boys doing down there?

1229
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,440
- We're in the middle of a case.
- Yeah.

1230
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,240
Of Scotch.

1231
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,000
Let's get out of here.

1232
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,240
Go with the grain.

1233
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,120
I'll show you. Here.

1234
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,360
You're going against the grain.

1235
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,200
- Like that.
- Okay.

1236
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,120
Are you okay?

1237
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,240
Darryl was my friend, Dad.

1238
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,480
I know. I'm sorry, son.

1239
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,720
I hope you don't blame me.

1240
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,280
I don't blame you, Dad.

1241
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,400
I blame Darryl.

1242
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,000
What's this right here?

1243
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,520
I love you, Dad.

1244
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,160
I love you, son.

1245
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,760
"May he find the peace in Heaven
that eluded him on Earth."

1246
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,600
"And may the scourge of violence...

1247
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,160
...claiming the lives of our children
be lifted by Your grace...

1248
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,600
...and infinite wisdom."

1249
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,400
"Amen."

1250
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,480
Wait here.

1251
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,040
Mrs. Smithers...

1252
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,800
Ma'am?

1253
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,680
I just don't know...

1254
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,800
You want to do something,
Sergeant Murtaugh?

1255
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,320
You find the man...

1256
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,160
...that put the gun in my son's hand.

1257
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,440
Take your mama to the car.

1258
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,360
Are you okay?

1259
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,120
Yeah.

1260
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,160
Who's got the gun?

1261
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,640
- You got it.
- Yeah.

1262
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,160
- Where did this gun come from?
- Fuck you!

1263
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,600
Ever heard of the word "genocide"?
Have you, stupid motherfucker?

1264
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,400
Have you ever heard of genocide?

1265
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,040
You fools are killing yourselves!
You're killing us!

1266
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,000
I'm tired of it!

1267
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,440
You'd better tell me where this
comes from or I'll blow your head off.

1268
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,360
I want to know, now!
Where did it come from?

1269
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,360
Do you see this gun? I want to know
where it came from. Now!

1270
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,720
I want a name!

1271
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,760
Do you see that car?
I want a name, asshole!

1272
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,080
I want a name! I want a name now!

1273
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:56,880
One!

1274
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,280
Are you crazy?

1275
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,640
Ready?

1276
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,440
Watch your hands.
That tire will rip them right off.

1277
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,360
- Two!
- I'm getting excited.

1278
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,360
Very excited.

1279
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,600
- Your face is going to be a skidmark!
- No!

1280
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,400
It's Jack Travis!

1281
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,000
That's what I wanted, baby.

1282
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,400
Three!

1283
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,600
Wrong...

1284
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,360
Women drivers, baby.

1285
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,120
We're looking for your friend, Travis.

1286
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,400
I've never heard of him.

1287
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,960
Wrong answer.

1288
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,000
You're pulling on the wrong string.

1289
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,920
That's not a very professional attitude.

1290
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,280
Who the fuck are you guys?

1291
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,520
Sorry, LAPD.

1292
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,800
We're doing a few routine inquiries.
Have you been checked for lumps recently?

1293
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,320
Give me my fucking wallet!

1294
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,840
Keep your hands down!

1295
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,200
My fucking wallet!

1296
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,560
Get up! We don't need this.

1297
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,800
We have a license that belongs to Hubert
Bartholomew Smith. Nice picture.

1298
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:01,760
Fuck you!

1299
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,080
Hey, there's a lady here.

1300
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,800
What the hell's going on here?

1301
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,080
- Maybe they know something.
- I'll go find out.

1302
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,160
- Want me to come with you?
- No, I got it.

1303
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,080
Maybe I should go with her.

1304
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,400
No, I want you to see something.
She has a gift. Watch this.

1305
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,600
Good morning, gentlemen. LAPD.

1306
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,040
I've got a few questions.

1307
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,440
Are you on parole?

1308
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,120
- I got a job...
- Who asked you?

1309
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,080
Do any of you know a Mr. Travis?

1310
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,520
You got a warrant?

1311
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,160
No, but I can get one.

1312
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,440
Until you do...

1313
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,920
...fuck off.

1314
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,240
That's not a nice thing to say to a lady.

1315
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,760
Fuck you.

1316
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,800
I don't think so.

1317
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,320
Backspin kick.

1318
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,280
Are you okay, honey?

1319
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,040
Just great.

1320
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,520
- "Honey"?
- How are you doing?

1321
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,240
This guy's on parole.

1322
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,160
This guy's an asshole!

1323
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,080
- Riggs, there's five of them.
- I know.

1324
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,480
Look at that.

1325
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,880
Grabbed his clusters!

1326
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,240
Let me help her.

1327
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,000
Stay still.

1328
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,720
My girl.

1329
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,960
This PMS is murder.

1330
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,240
I know what you mean.

1331
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,880
I've been married 25 years.

1332
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,880
So, tell me about Travis.

1333
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,800
I told you before, moron,
I don't know Jack Travis.

1334
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,640
I didn't say his name was Jack.

1335
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,440
You better start telling me
more than jackshit.

1336
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,640
- Men cross the street when they see me.
- I didn't have enough time.

1337
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,400
I'm not your enemy, Captain.
I'm just trying to do my job.

1338
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,360
- Have you eaten?
- I already ate. I've gotta go downtown.

1339
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,560
- What, do you eat alone?
- I'm used to it.

1340
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,160
It's bad for the digestion.

1341
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,600
Tomorrow, you'll have lunch with me,
but I'm not paying.

1342
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,560
Are you all right?

1343
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,440
Two fingers, Murph.

1344
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:38,560
- Jack, what the fuck?
- Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.

1345
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,000
After watching Lorna
handle herself so well...

1346
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,360
...I'm changing my mind about kung fu.

1347
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,280
Want to try it sometime?

1348
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,080
- No.
- Come on.

1349
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,600
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

1350
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,800
"Old dog", my ass.

1351
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,240
Let's try something. Watch this.
It's called a backspin kick.

1352
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,440
Pivot on the right, kick with your left...

1353
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,520
...and you whip that head around
to catch the target over there.

1354
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,120
Like this. Get that head around
and follow through.

1355
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,200
Like so.

1356
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,840
So you whip the head.

1357
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,440
All right?

1358
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,400
Thank you. Now you try it.

1359
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,400
Here's your target. All right?

1360
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,560
Remember, pivot right, kick left,
get that head around, spot that target.

1361
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,000
- Like that.
- Yeah. Follow the head around.

1362
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,880
Back up a bit. We don't want you
to bump into the pole.

1363
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,760
Just back up a little bit.
A little bit more. Okay, good.

1364
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,800
Mind and body strong, now, grasshopper.

1365
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,480
Okay.

1366
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,960
Go.

1367
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,240
He can't hold his water.

1368
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,160
Get back to work!

1369
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,240
Okay, back to work, everybody.

1370
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,400
Oh, Rog, I'm sorry.

1371
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,560
Sergeant Murtaugh,
you could be experiencing...

1372
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,240
...some transitional anger
caused by the shooting.

1373
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,840
Do you want to talk about it?

1374
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,680
- He's okay for a change.
- Are you sure?

1375
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,160
You look good in red. That's your color.

1376
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,200
- I've got a little extra time now.
- I'm fine, Doctor.

1377
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,080
Oh, shit!

1378
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,080
Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?

1379
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,120
What?

1380
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,720
It's her.

1381
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,880
Can you tell me where I can find
the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?

1382
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,560
Hi, skinny!

1383
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,840
- Delores. Remember me?
- I remember you.

1384
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,920
Can you tell me where I can find
the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?

1385
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:39,120
Actually, he's cowering down
on all fours right behind this counter.

1386
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,240
- Where is the sergeant?
- He's not here right now.

1387
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,640
But he's talked of nothing but you all week.

1388
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,800
Shut my mouth.

1389
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,240
The man's on fire.

1390
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,560
- What's the matter, baby?
- A little sciatica.

1391
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,200
You tell him Delores was here.

1392
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,000
You tell that man...

1393
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,120
...that he's the jam in my jellyroll.

1394
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,200
I'll see you, baby, okay. Bye-bye.

1395
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,840
See you.

1396
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,760
Delores says
you're "the jam in her jellyroll".

1397
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,560
I heard.

1398
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,480
That's a lot of woman.

1399
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,000
She calls me all the time.

1400
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,320
She leaves me notes.
What am I going to do?

1401
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,080
You shouldn't have led her on.

1402
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,120
Led her on? I didn't do anything.

1403
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,600
Sergeant, we have got to talk.

1404
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,360
You've got to come see me.

1405
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,920
We've got to work. Come on. Let's go.

1406
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,560
- Thanks anyway, for your concern.
- Thanks, Doc. You're a beauty.

1407
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,920
- Coming?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

1408
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,360
Good afternoon, Captain.

1409
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:50,680
That's good. See how easy that was?

1410
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,200
I love it down here. Don't you?

1411
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,320
This place is better than the swap meet.
Best bargains in town.

1412
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,200
Give me the lock-up keys.

1413
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,920
Those guys from the garage,
they're all ex-cons.

1414
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:12,200
They were all busted by the same
police officer, Jack Edward Travis.

1415
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,600
Early paroles
on the work-furlough program.

1416
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,840
Employed by a company called
Mesa Verde Construction.

1417
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,560
You can't go in there.
You don't have a pass.

1418
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,440
- May I see your pass?
- My pass?

1419
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,560
Here's my fucking pass.

1420
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,320
- I got shot in the line of duty.
- He's with us.

1421
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,880
- "He's with us"?
- I said that?

1422
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,360
Where'd you get her from?

1423
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,080
Why aren't you in the hospital?

1424
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,680
Don't mention it.
I told you not to leave me there.

1425
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,640
They tried to take my appendix out.
They gave me a lapotomy.

1426
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,440
- Brain surgery?
- A lapotomy.

1427
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,720
Not a lobotomy.
Cut your hair so you can hear.

1428
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,320
What's the difference?

1429
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,800
The difference is, for a lapotomy,
they shave your nether regions.

1430
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,320
Nether what?

1431
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,720
Nether... I can't say it in front of her.

1432
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,840
Point to it.

1433
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,240
- Here.
- It must be itchy.

1434
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,880
It is itchy. These doctors are savages.

1435
01:22:56,120 --> 01:23:00,760
Where does it say that a gunshot wound
requires a rectal exam?

1436
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,200
Yeah. With a telescope big enough
to see Venus.

1437
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,160
I guess all they saw was Uranus.

1438
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,360
That's great. Thank you.

1439
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,840
You know what I say?

1440
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,480
They fuck you in the hospital.
First they drug you, then they fuck you!

1441
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,920
When they're done...

1442
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,080
...the insurance company comes
and fucks you some more!

1443
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,320
$10 for a fucking aspirin
and it isn't even covered!

1444
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,520
That's enough!

1445
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,040
We're trying to work here.

1446
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,080
So, what's new on our case?
Anything new? You got Travis yet?

1447
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,600
Did you guys advertise?

1448
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,240
- He's family.
- Who's she?

1449
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,400
- Sergeant Cole.
- How are you? Leo Getz.

1450
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,920
- Anything you need, Leo "gets". Get it?
- I get it.

1451
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,320
It's real estate now...

1452
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,800
Listen, come on, you guys,
give me a break.

1453
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,040
I owe this guy one.
Give me something to do.

1454
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,720
You can get us a cup of coffee.

1455
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,400
That's great. I take one for you
and that's what you tell me?

1456
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,320
- He could check this out.
- That's all I'm good for?

1457
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,120
We've got something for you to do.

1458
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,000
Check out Mesa Verde Construction.
Find out all the information you can.

1459
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,600
- Sure, I can do this.
- Can you remember that name?

1460
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,320
Mesa Verde, I got it.

1461
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,320
- Wait. What are you doing?
- If there's any shit there, he'll find it.

1462
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,880
- Who is that guy?
- It's a long story.

1463
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,680
Here are your keys, Captain.

1464
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,880
You motherfucker!

1465
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,880
- Don't be stupid.
- What the fuck?

1466
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,320
Take the elevator, get the other guys.
Keys. Give me those fucking hands.

1467
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,320
Goddamn you, Travis. What the fuck?

1468
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,720
Stand there.

1469
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,480
I can get faster results
than that real estate broker.

1470
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,960
Leo's not just a real estate broker.

1471
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,760
He's a pain in the ass
with a lot of connections.

1472
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,320
This is what we came for.
Load everything on the elevator.

1473
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,920
- How'd you know where to find them?
- We got it all.

1474
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,640
The world of computers.

1475
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,680
You used to be one of us, for Christ's sake.

1476
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,920
You know what future a cop has? None.

1477
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,000
Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.

1478
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,720
Pension.

1479
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,840
Nothing to do.

1480
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,280
Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain
by evening. Not for this kid.

1481
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,480
Police Department's got it all:

1482
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,160
Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.

1483
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,680
It's a one-stop shopping center
if you've got the balls and the brains.

1484
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,560
Not a thing anybody can do about it.

1485
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,880
You're already fucking history
and you know it.

1486
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,320
Sorry. I'm just getting started.

1487
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,400
Something's wrong.

1488
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,120
The program's been accessed
by someone from the outside.

1489
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,680
What's been accessed?

1490
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,520
After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs
moved the confiscated ammunition.

1491
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,960
Armor-piercing bullets?

1492
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,000
Thousands of rounds
to a more secure location.

1493
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,560
- That's what's been accessed.
- Someone else knows.

1494
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,560
Where's this store? Where'd they move it?

1495
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,160
Let's go.

1496
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,880
- I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.
- That's a switch.

1497
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,840
- Right here in the building.
- Where?

1498
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,920
- I'm showing you.
- Something's going down.

1499
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,160
- Nothing's going down.
- I'm going with you.

1500
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,560
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two today.

1501
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,640
Come on.

1502
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,240
Have you got protection?

1503
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,000
- Right here in my wallet.
- No, your vest, you dummy.

1504
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,520
Should we take him?

1505
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,520
- Okay, but keep your head down.
- Stay behind me.

1506
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,000
Come on, let's go. Quiet!

1507
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,480
You were my ticket in.

1508
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,560
It's too bad you won't be coming with me.

1509
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,760
They got it all.

1510
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,200
- He's dead.
- How'd they get it out of here?

1511
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,440
- I don't know.
- Not upstairs.

1512
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,480
Elevator.

1513
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,200
Shit. It's down.

1514
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,600
The subway's down there.

1515
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,760
- Let's take the stairs.
- LA has subways?

1516
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,320
- Where've you been?
- Read something besides the comics.

1517
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,080
All right. Come on, let's hustle!

1518
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:54,040
Hurry up, guys.

1519
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,440
LAPD! Come here!

1520
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,920
Come here! Step on it!

1521
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,360
Son of a bitch!

1522
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,600
Did you see anybody or anything strange?

1523
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:17,320
- Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.
- Split now. Just get out of here.

1524
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,680
- I'm going across.
- I got it.

1525
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,120
Get rid of Murphy, now!

1526
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:37,280
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Let's go.

1527
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,000
Let's get out of here.

1528
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,600
Cover me.

1529
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,400
Let's go.

1530
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,760
Stay still.

1531
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,880
Happy birthday, kid.

1532
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,400
Another baby.

1533
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,800
Is he dead? Check the body.

1534
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,840
Get me out of here!

1535
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,600
Stupid son of a bitch!

1536
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,640
Stop that.

1537
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:35,720
Cut it out.

1538
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,520
- Don't shoot.
- LAPD!

1539
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:38,880
Where does this lead?

1540
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,440
- Pico Station.
- Thanks.

1541
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,640
Not that way.

1542
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,400
Take the stairs, it's faster.

1543
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,680
Gangway!

1544
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,960
Get out of the way!

1545
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,720
Holy shit!

1546
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,480
Son of a bitch!

1547
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,320
Police!

1548
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,800
Step on it. There he is.

1549
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,680
Goddamn!

1550
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,560
Put your foot down!

1551
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,040
Police!

1552
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,240
I need your bike.

1553
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,880
This is bullshit.

1554
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,800
Sergeant Riggs, call it in.
I need a couple of clips, too.

1555
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,280
Okay, we lost him.

1556
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,040
Where's Riggs?

1557
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,320
Keep me in touch
with the motorcycle pursuit.

1558
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,040
- Shit!
- Take a right, now.

1559
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,040
Take a right.

1560
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,560
Go!

1561
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,080
Take a right! No, left!

1562
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,160
This is 6-William-6.
I'm at the freeway construction site.

1563
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,280
Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?

1564
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,800
Come back to me, Central.

1565
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:41,000
Where the hell is Riggs?

1566
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,440
Take a left here! Get off!

1567
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,560
Get off the freeway!

1568
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,040
Stop! Hold it!

1569
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,720
Shit!

1570
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,360
Hang on!

1571
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,760
Where is the pursuit?

1572
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,480
Shit!

1573
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,400
Relax, Riggs.

1574
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:40,240
Relax?

1575
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,520
Shit!

1576
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,560
Just get back. Get back!

1577
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,120
Riggs, talk to me.

1578
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,800
Riggs, you're alive.

1579
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,440
Don't move.

1580
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,520
Just get back.

1581
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,480
Are you all right?

1582
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,960
Don't touch me!

1583
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,440
Okay! I'm not touching you!

1584
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,880
Don't touch me!

1585
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:33,080
- Don't touch me.
- I won't touch you.

1586
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,920
- Are you okay now?
- I'm pissed. Now I'm pissed.

1587
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,360
- Now what?
- That bastard!

1588
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,600
He's done this twice now. Damn!

1589
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,600
Son of a gun,
I'll suck his eyes down through his nose.

1590
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,000
That's twice he's got away.
Nobody gets away from me.

1591
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,800
Just relax.

1592
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,720
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1593
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,320
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1594
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,200
- I'm having that.
- You quit!

1595
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,640
I ran out of biscuits, okay?
Give me a break.

1596
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,200
Oh, shit!

1597
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,480
Perfect.

1598
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,320
What'd I miss?

1599
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,640
- What are you doing here?
- Great car chase.

1600
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,760
- Great chase.
- What are you doing here?

1601
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,720
- How'd you find us?
- Police scanner.

1602
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,760
What are you doing with a police scanner?

1603
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,320
Hello, Car 54, where are you?
I cracked this case for you guys.

1604
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,200
Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.

1605
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,680
They got a housing project,
called Rancho Arroyo.

1606
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,200
- I know where that is.
- Why don't we check it out?

1607
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,000
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah, okay.

1608
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,320
I'll come with you.

1609
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,320
- You're not coming with us.
- Yes, I am.

1610
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,560
I'll take my car.

1611
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,440
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

1612
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:50,720
I can't believe you did that! I got a spare!

1613
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:53,880
- You're driving.
- No, I'm driving.

1614
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:58,240
How could you do that?
I can't believe you did that.

1615
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,600
Where's Lorna?

1616
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,200
I can't believe you did that!

1617
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,000
I can't believe it.

1618
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:08,040
How could you do that to me?

1619
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,320
Did you see that?

1620
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,840
They're my partners.
I can't believe they did that!

1621
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,040
Do you own your own home?

1622
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,360
- Looks like we came to the right place.
- Yeah.

1623
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,440
Move on out to Travis Town.

1624
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,960
Great place to raise a family.

1625
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,200
Built on guns and bloodshed.

1626
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,720
One hell of a retirement plan
this asshole's got.

1627
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:01,800
Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.

1628
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,120
- Say, is that...
- Darryl's gun.

1629
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,880
- I've been saving it for the right occasion.
- This is it.

1630
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,320
- How many men do you think he has?
- Who knows?

1631
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,440
Maybe I should run over there
and ask him?

1632
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,840
That'd be too easy.

1633
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,440
Wish I had some grenades
or a rocket launcher.

1634
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,840
Maybe a ground-to-air missile.

1635
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,920
I wonder what Murphy's got in his trunk.

1636
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,000
It's obvious Murphy
was never a Boy Scout.

1637
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,640
Not even a good spare.

1638
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,880
Put your hands down...

1639
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:35,080
...it's embarrassing.

1640
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,560
How are you doing?

1641
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,600
Kissing.

1642
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,040
Fresh ones?

1643
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:40,880
Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.

1644
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,440
No points for those.

1645
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:45,240
- How'd you get here?
- Drove.

1646
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:48,600
I ran into Leo at the police station.
He talked to me first.

1647
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:50,920
- Any ideas?
- Lucky thing we've got a plan.

1648
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,520
Lucky thing. What is it?

1649
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,960
I want it to be a surprise.

1650
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,200
I like surprises.

1651
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,760
Move it!

1652
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,800
- Check it out.
- Let's go.

1653
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,160
- Look what they did to Murph's car.
- It could've been worse.

1654
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:30,600
- It could've been yours.
- Worse, it could've been Trish's car.

1655
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,000
- On three.
- Three.

1656
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,280
Three?

1657
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,480
One...

1658
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:37,680
...two...
- Three!

1659
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,440
Police! Freeze!

1660
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,320
Oh, shit!

1661
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,000
- Let's go!
- Right now!

1662
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:03,560
What's wrong with you?
I said go on three, not two.

1663
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:04,920
On three.

1664
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,280
It's always three.

1665
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,080
Boys!

1666
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:12,600
What are we doing here?
Losing our heads in a crisis?

1667
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:17,080
Cover me!

1668
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,960
Exxon.

1669
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,480
- What?
- Count to 20.

1670
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:42,240
What?

1671
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:46,040
Count to 20 and then light me.

1672
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,320
Shit!

1673
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,800
Riggs, it's loaded with ammo!

1674
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,640
- Cover me.
- Cover you?

1675
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,240
Cover you, cover Riggs.

1676
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,280
When's someone gonna cover me
for a change?

1677
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,600
What's that, 13, 14? To hell with it.

1678
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,680
It's the cops. They're burning everything.

1679
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,160
Son of a bitch!

1680
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,440
Crazy motherfucker!

1681
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:58,880
Damn!

1682
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,680
Riggs, the ammo! Get out of there!

1683
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,880
You crazy son of a bitch!

1684
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,560
Yeah!

1685
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:39,160
Son of a bitch. You're full of shit.

1686
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,920
Stay there.

1687
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,040
Shit, where's Riggs?

1688
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,240
Son of a bitch! No clip.

1689
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,920
Lorna, no, don't!

1690
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,760
Come on in, bitch.

1691
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,560
The door's open!

1692
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:39,640
I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!

1693
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,360
Son of a bitch.

1694
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,280
Shit!

1695
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,200
Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.

1696
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,720
Cop killers.

1697
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:33,080
You're coming with me!

1698
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,560
Fuck you, asshole!

1699
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,000
Get up!

1700
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,400
Get up!

1701
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:06,600
Killed in the line of duty.

1702
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:12,880
You'll get a great funeral
from the Department.

1703
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,240
Cop killers.

1704
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:33,160
Ex-cop killers.

1705
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:44,400
Go to hell, Riggs.

1706
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:47,280
You first.

1707
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,880
Crazy son of a bitch!

1708
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:06,960
Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.

1709
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,440
Just hold still.

1710
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,800
Get a chopper, man.

1711
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,120
She had two vests on.
She's gonna be okay.

1712
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,480
A couple of bad ones.
We need to get a chopper.

1713
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:20,520
You're all right, partner. Hang on.

1714
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,560
It's okay. Just lie still.

1715
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:26,880
Just a romantic evening by the fire,
just the two of us.

1716
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,720
Just be still.

1717
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,680
Honey, open your eyes.

1718
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:43,640
Open your eyes.

1719
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,880
What are you trying to prove out there?

1720
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,800
Why do you do that?

1721
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:53,240
- Can I take this off?
- Yeah.

1722
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:59,000
You're supposed to grow old
with someone, not because of them.

1723
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,000
I'm gonna be with you.

1724
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:07,280
I'm with you now. Look, I'm right here.

1725
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,960
We're both here, right? Right.

1726
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,880
Come on, I want to be with you.

1727
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,680
What have you got to lose?

1728
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,320
You.

1729
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,560
Not likely.

1730
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:28,200
- Hey, Lorna.
- Yeah?

1731
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,040
Let's live to regret this.

1732
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,640
- We've got to go, sir.
- Okay.

1733
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:40,760
She's gonna be fine.

1734
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,640
Can you hear me?

1735
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,440
I love you.

1736
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:08,160
"Happy retirement, Daddy"

1737
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,360
"Happy retirement, Daddy"

1738
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,240
This is it. This is the day.

1739
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,440
Everybody? Daddy?

1740
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,520
I want you to know there's a candle
for every year in the Force.

1741
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,760
Yes! A lot of years.

1742
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,680
- You have to blow it out.
- Come on.

1743
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,240
I can't.

1744
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:30,120
- Come on, blow it out.
- That's not what I mean.

1745
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,760
What?

1746
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,720
I can't retire.

1747
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,120
I thought I could. I wanted to.

1748
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,920
But I can't.

1749
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,920
That means you're gonna
stay with the Force?

1750
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:50,000
That means I'm staying
with the Force, baby.

1751
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,560
This cake's about to explode,
so you'd better blow out these candles.

1752
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,040
I want you to know
that I'm behind you all the way.

1753
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,880
- Me, too.
- So am I, Dad.

1754
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,000
It's okay.

1755
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:07,040
Well, the streets will be safer
for another couple of years.

1756
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,640
"Word", Nick?

1757
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,480
"Word", Dad.

1758
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,080
Blow them out!

1759
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:16,360
Hello?

1760
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,720
Hello! In here!

1761
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,200
Hello. I gotta talk to Roger.

1762
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,560
Oprah should see this.

1763
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,920
I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.

1764
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,560
What is it?

1765
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:31,240
Where's Riggs? I didn't know
he could hold his breath that long.

1766
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,960
I'm taking a bath, Leo.

1767
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:37,200
I can see that. And it's cold water, too.
There goes your image.

1768
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,920
Listen, I got great news.

1769
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:41,840
Once again, Leo Getz has delivered.

1770
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,520
Okay, I have sold this turkey.

1771
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:48,920
This termite-infested dump is now gone.
Okay?

1772
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:52,880
All you have to do is sign the contract
before the suckers change their mind.

1773
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,160
Okay? I did it!

1774
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,800
The house is off the market.

1775
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:00,600
We're gonna stay in this "termite-infested turkey"
for another ten years.

1776
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,720
- At least.
- Maybe I'll get married here.

1777
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,720
- Come on, out.
- You can't do this.

1778
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,520
- Out.
- No, you can't do that.

1779
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,320
You can't do that. I have contracts signed.

1780
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,720
Because we're partners,
no commission. Okay?

1781
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:14,640
Partners?

1782
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,960
You and Riggs owe me two new tires.

1783
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:17,960
Why?

1784
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,200
Because bullets aren't covered
in normal road hazard. That's why!

1785
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,360
I want those tires. No conditions.

1786
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:24,880
Leo, get out of here!

1787
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,080
- Don't tell me to get out!
- Out!

1788
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:31,520
Okay, I'm going.
You're lucky your wife's here.

1789
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,120
Don't come crying to me if...

1790
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,040
Get out!

1791
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:40,400
- Termites get...
- No more!

1792
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,080
Your friends.

1793
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:48,240
Ten more years till forced retirement.

1794
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,360
That's 3,650 days.

1795
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:55,880
- Forty-nine.
- Oh, yeah.

1796
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:08,960
I gotta improve my image.

1797
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,360
'Bye, Daddy!

1798
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,080
'Bye, baby.

1799
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,560
What are you smiling at?

1800
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,320
Why weren't you at my party?

1801
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,120
I knew you weren't going to retire.

1802
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:42,000
I've been wrong about a few things
in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.

1803
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:44,040
Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.

1804
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:46,720
I'm smoking to forget
my dog-biscuit problem.

1805
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,560
What dog-biscuit problem?

1806
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,560
I've been chasing more cars lately...

1807
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,920
...and when I try to lick my balls,
I keep falling off the couch.

1808
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,280
Jesus Christ.

1809
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,920
I'm driving. Other side.

1810
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:00,040
I've got no dispute. I just came over
to open the door for you.

1811
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,480
Thank you for opening it.

1812
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,200
An old fella like you
needs all the help he can get.

1813
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:05,480
I'll show you.

1814
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,480
- Who's a grumpy bastard?
- I'm a grumpy bastard.

1815
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:10,000
- You know something?
- What?

1816
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:13,880
When I do retire,
I hope your next partner is just like you.

1817
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:17,760
There's winners and there's losers,
and God wouldn't do that to me.

1818
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,800
He did it to me.

1819
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,080
I know.

1820
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,120
See what I mean?

1821
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,840
My point exactly.

1822
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,960
Son of a bitch!

1823
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,240
Stay away from my daughter!

1824
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,720
You can't be serious?
What are you talking about?

1825
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,240
I saw you kiss Rianne.

1826
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,520
She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.

1827
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,560
- That's not the point!
- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.

1828
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:45,240
If it's just friendship,
try shaking hands next time.

1829
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:48,760
- Are you getting enough fiber in your diet?
- I'm getting enough fiber!

1830
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,080
I'm spoken for, okay?

1831
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:53,040
I'm gonna pick Lorna up
from the hospital this afternoon.

1832
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,480
We're practically...

1833
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:57,000
- You're serious?
- We've got a dog and everything.

1834
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:59,440
I figure I can make ends meet.

1835
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:04,600
English subtitles conformed by
SOFTITLER

1836
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,760
{y:i}All units! All units! Code 2, High.

1837
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,480
Don't even think about it. Don't even try.

1838
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:16,640
This is us, rolling to Code 2, High,
at Verrina Place.

1839
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,480
Shit. This time
we wait for the bomb squad.

1840
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:23,560
Do you think I want to end up
in uniform again?

1841
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:21,160
{y:i}20-William-12,
{y:i}the REA Bomb Squad's en route. All units.

1842
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,800
{y:i}Those guys gonna get in the way again?

1843
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,960
There it is. Happy? Let's go.

1844
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,040
We ain't seen nothing yet, Rog.

1845
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,440
- Get me closer.
- It's roped off.

1846
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:33,960
- Can't see the bomb squad anywhere.
- They're coming.

1847
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,320
Stop here and I'll just get out.

1848
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,920
No, don't get out of the car, Riggs!

1849
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,320
Tell me, was it the red wire or blue...

1850
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,560
- Let's get out of here.
- Step on the gas.

1851
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,040
They'll never believe this!

1852
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,760
- I hope nobody saw us.
- They'll blame us.

1853
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,080
Let's keep cool. You'd better
get your girdle out of mothballs.

1854
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,480
They'll say, "Back in uniform again."

1855
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:55,840
Ten more years of this!

1856
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:00,560
{y:i}I'm too old for this shit.
