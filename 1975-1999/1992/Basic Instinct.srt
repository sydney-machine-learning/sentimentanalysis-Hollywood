1
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:30,476
- Here we go, Nick.
- All right.

2
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:35,346
- Good morning, Detective.
- I want a shot of the two detectives.

3
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,436
Keep it back, folks.

4
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:39,446
- Howdy.
- Morning.

5
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:44,016
Up there.

6
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,456
- How's it going, Gus?
- Morning, Pete.

7
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:54,926
- Who was this fucking guy?
- Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

8
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:57,126
- Never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.

9
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,536
- Hey, Ronny, where they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.

10
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,166
Mid '60s, had five or six hits. 
Got a club down on Fillmore now.

11
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:04,896
Not now, he don't.

12
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:08,506
- Do we have a time of death? 
- Almost. 

13
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:11,046
- Do you guys know Captain Tallcott?
- Sure.

14
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:14,376
- What's the Chief's office doing here?
- Observing.

15
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,376
- What's it say, Doc?
- Ninety-two degrees. About six hours.

16
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:23,016
Puts time of death at around 2:00 a.m.

17
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:26,426
Can somebody close the drapes over there?

18
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:29,126
Maid came in about an hour ago 
and found the body.

19
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,536
- She's not a live-in.
- Maybe the maid did it.

20
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,136
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.

21
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,666
- No bruises on the body.
- It ain't the maid.

22
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:38,136
Never know.

23
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,416
Sorry.

24
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,006
He was last seen leaving the club 
with his girlfriend about midnight.

25
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:50,916
- What was it?
- Ice pick. Left it in the living room.

26
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:56,456
There's come stains all over the sheets.

27
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:07,496
- Very impressive.
- He got off before he got off.

28
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,636
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.

29
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,406
Mr. Boz was a major contributor 
to the mayor's campaign.

30
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:14,966
He was chairman of the board 
of the Palace of Fine Arts.

31
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:17,016
I thought he was a rock and roll star.

32
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:19,106
He was a retired rock and roll star.

33
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:22,446
A civic-minded, 
very respectable rock and roll star.

34
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,046
Then, what's that over there?

35
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,456
Looks like civic-minded, 
very respectable cocaine.

36
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,896
Listen to me, Curran. 
I'm gonna get a lot of heat on this.

37
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:37,896
I don't want any mistakes.

38
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,306
What's Boz's girl friend's name?

39
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:50,466
"Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero."

40
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,186
- Always a pleasure, Captain.
- He's up bright and early.

41
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:03,316
He doesn't usually punch in 
'til after his 18 holes.

42
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,896
Johnny and the mayor 
must have been very tight.

43
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,336
Nick, keep your 3:00.

44
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,196
You want me to work the case...

45
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,026
- I said, keep it!
- All right.

46
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:13,896
I'll keep it.

47
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:49,296
Good morning. I'm Detective Curran. 
This is Detective Moran.

48
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:54,006
San Francisco Police Department. 
I'd like to speak to Catherine Tramell.

49
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,276
Come in.

50
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:05,356
Sit, please. Just a moment.

51
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,956
Ain't that cute? 
They got his and hers Picasso's.

52
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,326
- I didn't know you knew a Picasso.
- Sure I do. It says right here.

53
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,356
Hers is bigger.

54
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:34,246
Sorry to bother you. 
We just got a couple of questions.

55
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:37,046
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.

56
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:38,886
What do you want?

57
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:41,426
When was the last time you saw John Boz?

58
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:44,256
Is he dead?

59
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,366
Why do you think he's dead?

60
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:50,096
Well, you wouldn't be here otherwise, 
would you?

61
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,326
Were you with him last night?

62
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:56,936
You're looking for Catherine, not me.

63
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:01,206
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxy.

64
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,276
I'm her friend.

65
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:12,086
Well, Roxy, 
do you know where your friend is?

66
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:18,386
She's out at the beach house at Stenson. 
Seadrift 1402.

67
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:19,956
Thanks.

68
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,966
You're wasting your time.

69
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:29,966
Catherine didn't kill him.

70
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:46,206
Miss Tramell?

71
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:07,136
Good afternoon. I'm Detective Curran. 
This is Detective Moran.

72
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,366
- We're with the San Francisco Police...
- I know who you are.

73
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:13,436
So, how did he die?

74
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,006
He was murdered.

75
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:16,446
Obviously.

76
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,076
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.

77
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,426
How long were you dating him?

78
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:30,446
I wasn't dating him. 
I was fucking him.

79
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:34,356
What are you, a pro?

80
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,226
No, I'm an amateur.

81
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,496
How long were you having sex with him?

82
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,406
About a year and a half.

83
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:45,036
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.

84
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,236
Did you leave the club with him?

85
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,906
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?

86
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:52,916
No. We had a drink at the club. 
We left together.

87
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:54,916
He went home, and I came out here.

88
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:57,116
Was there anyone with you last night?

89
00:11:57,156 --> 00:12:00,416
No. I wasn't in the mood last night.

90
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:12,196
Let me ask you something, Miss Tramell.

91
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:14,396
Are you sorry he's dead?

92
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,436
Yeah.

93
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,036
I liked fucking him.

94
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,476
Look, I don't really feel like talking anymore.

95
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,956
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown, 
if you want.

96
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,046
So read me my rights and arrest me...

97
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,286
and then I'll go downtown.

98
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:43,096
Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.

99
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:52,196
Please.

100
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,626
Nice girl.

101
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,686
I'm sorry, Beth. 
I got hung up in Stenson.

102
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:42,386
- How are you, Nick?
- I'm fine.

103
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:45,396
Come on, Beth. You know I'm fine.
How long do we have to keep doing this?

104
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:48,456
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, 
I suppose.

105
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,486
- Have a seat.
- It's bullshit. You know it is.

106
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:55,656
I know it is. But sit down, anyway, 
so we can get it over with, okay?

107
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:06,376
So, how are things?

108
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,416
Things are fine.

109
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,286
I told you, all right? 
Things are fine.

110
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:14,256
How is your personal life?

111
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,286
My sex life is fine.

112
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:22,296
My sex life is actually pretty shitty 
since I stopped seeing you.

113
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:28,166
I started developing calluses.

114
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:35,176
Sorry.

115
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:37,506
How's the booze?

116
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,146
Haven't had a drink in three months.

117
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:43,316
- What about the coke?
- No.

118
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:47,486
No. I'm working my ass off. 
I'm off the sauce.

119
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,646
I even stopped smoking.

120
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:52,356
How is not smoking?

121
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,416
It sucks.

122
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,496
Now, will you tell I.A. 
I'm just your average...

123
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,166
healthy, totally fucked up cop...

124
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,196
and let me out of here, please?

125
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,876
Yes.

126
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,906
Thank you.

127
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,686
I still miss you, Nick.

128
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,436
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

129
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:40,476
Tallcott's in there. They're waiting. 
How did it go?

130
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,376
She misses me.

131
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:45,416
Boy, when that girl mates, 
it's for life.

132
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,676
All right, let's start. 
Harrigan.

133
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,186
Well, we got 31 stab wounds, 
neck and the chest.

134
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,916
No usable prints, no forceable entry, 
nothing missing.

135
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:56,446
No prints on the ice pick, either. 
You can pick it up at any K-Mart.

136
00:15:56,526 --> 00:15:59,496
The scarf was Hermes. 
It's expensive.

137
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,656
They sell about 20,000 a year, worldwide.

138
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:06,696
Bottle was cocaine. High quality, high content. 
He inhaled it.

139
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:09,926
There were minute quantities 
on his lips and penis.

140
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:11,936
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million.

141
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,976
No direct survivors. 
No criminal record.

142
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:18,306
He liked his drugs. He liked his girls. 
He liked his rock and roll.

143
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:20,006
He liked the mayor too, right?

144
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,476
What about his girlfriend?

145
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:30,686
- Is she relevant here? Is she a suspect?
- She's a suspect.

146
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,296
On what basis?

147
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:35,456
"Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell. Age 30. 
No priors. No convictions.

148
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:38,026
Magna cum laude at Berkeley, 1983.

149
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:40,706
Double major: Literature and psychology.

150
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:43,336
Daughter, sole survivor, 
Marvin and Elaine Tramell...

151
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,936
killed in a boating accident, 1979.

152
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:50,346
Catherine Tramell, sole heir. 
Estimated assets: $110 million."

153
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,386
You're shitting me.

154
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,216
"Formerly engaged to Manuel Vasquez, deceased."

155
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:57,876
Whoa, whoa! Manny Vasquez?

156
00:16:57,956 --> 00:17:01,326
Former middleweight contender. 
Killed in the ring, Atlantic City, 1984.

157
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,626
I love it. She's got 100 million bucks.

158
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,886
She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars...

159
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:08,026
and she's got a degree 
in screwing with people's heads.

160
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,066
You forgot about her degree in literature. 
She's a writer.

161
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:15,266
She published a novel under a pen name. 
Want to know what it's about?

162
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:20,276
It's about a retired rock and roll star 
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

163
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:35,326
Page 67, cowboy.

164
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,916
You know how she does the boyfriend?

165
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,456
With an ice pick, in bed...

166
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:45,056
his hands tied with a white silk scarf.

167
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,506
Dr. Garner.

168
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:56,876
I've asked Dr. Lamont to consult with us. 
This isn't really my turf.

169
00:17:56,946 --> 00:18:00,076
Dr. Lamont teaches the pathology 
of psychopathic behavior at Stanford...

170
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,916
and also on the Justice Department 
Psychological Profile Team.

171
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:05,956
Dr. Lamont.

172
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:09,886
I see two possibilities.

173
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,896
One: The person who wrote this book 
is your murderer...

174
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:18,096
and acted out the killing described 
in ritualistic, literal detail.

175
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,326
Two: Someone who wants to harm the writer...

176
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:25,036
read the book and enacted the killing described 
to incriminate her.

177
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:27,876
What if the writer did it? 
Then what are we dealing with?

178
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:31,276
You're dealing with a devious, 
diabolical mind.

179
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:34,946
You see, this book had to have been written 
at least six months...

180
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:37,916
maybe even years... 
before it was published...

181
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:41,486
which means the writer must have planned the crime 
in the subconscious back then.

182
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,956
Now, the fact that she carried it out...

183
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,086
indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior...

184
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,166
in terms not only of the killing itself...

185
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:52,036
but also in terms 
of the applied advance defense mechanism.

186
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:57,066
Sometimes I can't tell shit from shinola, Doc.

187
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,666
What was all that you just said?

188
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,176
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.

189
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:04,076
She's going to say, "Do you think 
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone...

190
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,416
in the exact way I described in my book?"

191
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,886
I wouldn't do that 
because I know I'd be the suspect.

192
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,516
So, what if it's not the writer? 
What if it's someone who read the book?

193
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:17,126
You're dealing, then, 
with someone so obsessed...

194
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,426
that he or she is willing to kill 
an irrelevant and innocent victim...

195
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:24,696
in order to place the blame 
on the person who wrote that book.

196
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:28,466
I'm talking about 
a deep-seated obsessional hatred...

197
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:31,436
and an utter lack of respect 
for human life.

198
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:42,376
So, we got a once in a lifetime, 
top of the line looney-tuney.

199
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,516
That's what you're saying, right, Doc?

200
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:49,456
You're dealing with someone very dangerous...

201
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,186
and very ill.

202
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,226
You know there's no case here. 
You've got no physical evidence.

203
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:03,026
She hasn't got an alibi.

204
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:06,036
She hasn't got a motive, either. 
Believe me...

205
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:09,046
her defense would just beat us to death 
with this copycat thing.

206
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:12,416
Anybody who read the book could have done it.

207
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:16,906
- What do you want to do now? Nothing?
- We call her in for questioning.

208
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:18,946
She's got enough money 
to burn the department down...

209
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:22,186
She was the last person seen with the guy.

210
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:25,026
I'll take the responsibility.

211
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,066
It's yours.

212
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:30,896
It won't do any good.

213
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:33,056
She'll just waltz 
in with some superstar lawyer...

214
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,036
who'll get us all canned 
for wasting the taxpayers' money.

215
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,476
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No, she won't.

216
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,006
I don't think she'll hide behind anybody.

217
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:46,136
I don't think she's gonna hide at all.

218
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:49,146
Then she's as crazy as you are, Curran.

219
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,146
You know what they say:

220
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:58,956
Takes one to know one.

221
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:27,286
Miss Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown 
to answer a few questions.

222
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,456
Are you arresting me?

223
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,516
If that's the way you want to play it.

224
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:35,996
Could I change into something more appropriate?

225
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:38,326
It'll only take a minute. 
Come on in.

226
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:45,506
Make yourselves comfortable. 
I'll be right back.

227
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:04,286
- Hey, Gus. 
- Hmm?

228
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:08,286
- So, how long is this gonna take?
- I don't know.

229
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:15,966
Do you always keep old newspapers around?

230
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:18,976
Only when they make interesting reading.

231
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:37,216
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.

232
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:39,956
Why would I need an attorney?

233
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:53,036
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

234
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:55,046
Yes, you do.

235
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:59,546
- I quit.
- Congratulations.

236
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:13,926
I thought you didn't have any cigarettes.

237
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:16,396
Oh, I found some in my pocket. 
Would you like one?

238
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:21,926
I told you, I quit.

239
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:24,166
It won't last.

240
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,376
- You working on another book?
- Yes, I am.

241
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,216
It must really be something 
making stuff up all the time.

242
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,986
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.

243
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:41,986
How's that?

244
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:46,966
You make up believable stuff. 
It's called suspension of disbelief.

245
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:50,326
I like that! 
Suspension of disbelief.

246
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:55,126
What's your new book about?

247
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,006
A detective. 
He falls for the wrong woman.

248
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:08,206
What happens?

249
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,376
She kills him.

250
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:25,166
I'm John Carreli, Miss Tramell, 
assistant district attorney.

251
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:27,226
I have to inform you 
this session's being taped.

252
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:30,166
- This is Captain Tallcott.
- My pleasure.

253
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,266
- And Lieutenant Walker.
- Hi.

254
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,006
- Can we get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

255
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:37,046
Are your attorneys going to join us?

256
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,206
Miss Tramell has waived her rights 
to an attorney.

257
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,256
Did I miss something?

258
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:47,256
I told them you wouldn't want 
an attorney present.

259
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,196
Why have you waived your right 
to an attorney, Miss Tramell?

260
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:53,196
Why did you think I wouldn't want one?

261
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,386
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.

262
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:58,166
I have nothing to hide.

263
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,276
There's no smoking in this building.

264
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:18,386
What are you gonna do? 
Charge me with smoking?

265
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:35,166
Would you tell us the nature 
of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

266
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:38,176
I had sex with him 
for about a year and a half.

267
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:42,436
I liked having sex with him.

268
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:46,106
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.

269
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:49,206
I like men like that.

270
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,376
Men who give me pleasure.

271
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:55,456
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

272
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:05,126
You ever engage in any sadomasochistic activity?

273
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,936
Exactly what did you have in mind, Mr. Carreli?

274
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,376
- You ever tie him up?
- No.

275
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,036
You never tied him up?

276
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,076
No.

277
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:21,016
Johnny liked to use his hands too much.

278
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:24,056
I like hands and fingers.

279
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:28,316
You describe a white silk scarf in your book.

280
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,126
I've always had a fondness 
for white silk scarves.

281
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:33,166
They're good for all occasions.

282
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:36,966
But you said you liked men 
to use their hands, didn't you?

283
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,366
No, I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.

284
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,426
I don't make any rules, Nick. 
I go with the flow.

285
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:49,406
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Miss Tramell?

286
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:52,446
I'd have to be pretty stupid 
to write a book about killing...

287
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:55,486
and then kill somebody 
the way I described it in my book.

288
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:59,416
I'd be announcing myself as the killer. 
I'm not stupid.

289
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,386
We know you're not stupid.

290
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,356
Maybe that's what you're counting on 
to get you off the hook.

291
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:05,186
Writing the book gives you an alibi.

292
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:06,986
Yes, it does.

293
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:13,366
The answer's no. I didn't kill him.

294
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:19,206
- Do you use drugs, Miss Tramell?
- Sometimes.

295
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:22,206
- Did you ever use drugs with Mr. Boz?
- Sure.

296
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:23,406
What kind of drugs?

297
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:25,636
Cocaine.

298
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,986
Have you ever fucked on cocaine, Nick?

299
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,036
It's nice.

300
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,406
You like playing games, don't you?

301
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,416
I have a degree in psychology. 
It goes with the turf.

302
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:02,316
Games are fun.

303
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:06,086
What about boxing? That's a game. 
Is that fun too?

304
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:09,246
I don't think that's relevant to this inquiry.

305
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:11,696
Boxing was fun 'til Manny died.

306
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,656
How did you feel when he died?

307
00:28:14,696 --> 00:28:16,286
I loved him. It hurt.

308
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,666
How did you feel when I told you 
Johnny Boz had died?

309
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,636
I felt like someone had read my book 
and was playing a game.

310
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:24,196
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.

311
00:28:24,276 --> 00:28:25,636
- Because you didn't love him?
- That's right.

312
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:27,196
Even though you were fucking him?

313
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,206
You still get the pleasure.

314
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:32,146
Didn't you ever fuck anybody else 
when you were married, Nick?

315
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:33,676
How'd you know he was married?

316
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:36,176
Maybe I was just guessing.

317
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,416
What difference does it make?

318
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,316
Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

319
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:55,166
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

320
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,306
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

321
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:03,866
I wanted to write a book about the murder 
of a retired rock and roll star.

322
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:07,316
I went down to his club, I picked him up 
and I had sex with him.

323
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,646
You didn't feel anything for him? 
You just had sex with him for your book?

324
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:17,346
In the beginning. 
Then I got to like what he did for me.

325
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,366
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

326
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,156
I'm a writer. 
I use people for what I write.

327
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:26,296
Let the world beware.

328
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,606
Do you want me to take a lie detector test?

329
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:42,186
<i>Wait here, please.</i>

330
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:52,156
No blips, no blood pressure variations, 
no pulse variance.

331
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:55,326
Either she's telling the truth, 
or I've never seen anyone like her.

332
00:29:57,966 --> 00:30:00,436
I guess that settles it.

333
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:05,866
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can't fool the machine.

334
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,306
Trust me. It can be done.

335
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:09,206
And what makes you such an expert?

336
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,936
Because I know people that have done it.

337
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:18,876
Thank you.

338
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:21,926
Thanks for coming in, Miss Tramell. 
Sorry to inconvenience you.

339
00:30:21,956 --> 00:30:24,446
Could someone give me a ride home?

340
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:26,496
Sure.

341
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:29,526
Thank you.

342
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,656
Want to get a drink?

343
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:49,316
- Rough day?
- Not really.

344
00:30:49,356 --> 00:30:51,876
Beating that machine can't be easy.

345
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:57,416
If I was guilty and wanted to beat that machine, 
it wouldn't be hard.

346
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:01,356
It wouldn't be hard at all.

347
00:31:03,496 --> 00:31:07,956
You took a lie detector test 
after you shot those two people, didn't you?

348
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:11,666
I passed.

349
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:16,506
You see? 
We're both innocent, Nick.

350
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:38,026
You seem to know an awful lot about me.

351
00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:40,536
You know an awful lot about me.

352
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,866
I don't know anything 
that's not police business.

353
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:51,506
You know I don't wear any underwear. 
Don't you, Nick?

354
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:02,886
Thanks for the ride.

355
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,996
Would you like another glass of wine?

356
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,506
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.

357
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,246
What's all this "Nick" stuff?

358
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:28,906
"Nick, do you want a cigarette? 
Nick, can I have a ride?"

359
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:31,546
She didn't ask me to give her a ride. 
She asked anybody.

360
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:34,286
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?

361
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:37,686
No, Chuckie. 
Get me a double blackjack on the rocks, please.

362
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:41,466
What you doing, Hoss?

363
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:45,456
I haven't had a drink in three months.

364
00:32:45,536 --> 00:32:48,966
All right with you, cowboy?

365
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:51,996
- She doesn't know me, okay?
- Here you go.

366
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,036
I never seen her before Gus and I 
talked with her.

367
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,046
- Thanks, Chuck.
- You're sure?

368
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:59,106
Yes, I'm sure.

369
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:01,076
Cheers.

370
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:09,946
Now what?

371
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:11,956
What "now what"? 
Now nothing.

372
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:13,966
She passed the polygraph. 
That's it.

373
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,056
She knew how to beat it, 
that's why she took it.

374
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:19,326
How in the fuck do you know? 
What is it with you and this broad?

375
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,996
Come on, Phil. 
Don't let this one slide.

376
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,336
What about her parents? 
What about what else she published?

377
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:26,376
Maybe all her books come true.

378
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:29,436
Her parents died in an accident. 
I don't care what else she published.

379
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:31,876
What are you, a book critic?

380
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:35,046
How'd they die? 
Was there an investigation?

381
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:38,386
You're saying she killed her parents? 
Did she kill Manny Vasquez too?

382
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:43,546
Not unless she climbed into the ring 
and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

383
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,086
Maybe she did. 
Maybe she grew herself an afro...

384
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,956
developed a hell of a left hook 
and put shoe polish all over her face.

385
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:52,436
- Let's polygraph her again.
- Fuck you.

386
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,006
Fuck you too.

387
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:56,336
Don't worry, Phil. 
Nick'll fuck himself.

388
00:33:56,376 --> 00:34:00,176
You guys are very funny. 
Hey, Chuckie, get me another double.

389
00:34:00,346 --> 00:34:02,906
Hey, shooter!

390
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:05,876
Are you back on the blackjack, shooter?

391
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:09,406
- We're discussing a case here.
- I know that. I have no doubts.

392
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:12,386
Here you go, Nick.

393
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:15,426
A double, huh, shooter?

394
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,496
I'm off duty, Nilsen.

395
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:27,666
You hear me? 
I'm off duty discussing a case.

396
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:30,376
Now, I.A. shouldn't have a problem with that.

397
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:35,006
Maybe I should put in for some overtime?

398
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:41,406
Don't work too hard, shooter. 
It might drive you to drink.

399
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:47,886
Stop riding me, man! 
I'll kick your fucking teeth in!

400
00:34:47,956 --> 00:34:51,416
- What's the problem?
- No problem, Doctor.

401
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,526
Here comes the shrink, just in time 
to save her favorite patient.

402
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,126
Just fuck off, Marty!

403
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:01,456
You kids have a good time tonight, huh?

404
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,076
- He's asking for it.
- That's right, so don't take the bait.

405
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:16,146
Do you want to go?

406
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:19,516
- Yes.
- Let's go.

407
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:26,516
Sometimes I think he started banging her 
just to get Internal Affairs off him.

408
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:30,966
He ain't that way. 
He's got a heart.

409
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:45,126
What was she like?

410
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,926
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.

411
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,976
You had her pegged. 
She used her book as an alibi.

412
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:58,176
I met her at Berkeley.

413
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:03,146
We were in some of the same classes.

414
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:05,986
Why didn't you tell me?

415
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:08,026
I'm telling you.

416
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:21,306
You've never been like that before. Why?

417
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:23,306
You tell me. 
You're the shrink.

418
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:29,306
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?

419
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:31,976
You weren't making love.

420
00:38:36,286 --> 00:38:37,946
I need a cigarette.

421
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:40,216
I thought you said you quit.

422
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,166
It's the top drawer in the foyer.

423
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,156
Get it on your way out!

424
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,906
- Have you started?
- Waitin' on you.

425
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:08,146
- You look like dog shit.
- No, he looks a little shrunk is all.

426
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:10,446
And not just in the head.

427
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,286
All right, I made a couple of calls to Berkeley.

428
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:16,086
There was a murder in '80. 
A professor.

429
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:20,216
In his bed, multiple stab wounds, 
with an ice pick.

430
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,396
Tramell was there then, wasn't she?

431
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:29,126
University records say she was.

432
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,006
Okay, let's move on this. 
Gus, get out to Berkeley.

433
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:34,096
Harrigan, find out what else she's published.

434
00:39:34,176 --> 00:39:35,906
Andrews, get me that file 
on the parents' accident.

435
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,466
Copy Beth on everything. 
I want psychological input.

436
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:42,106
- What about me?
- You're already getting input.

437
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:45,116
You go soak your head 
in a tub of ice water.

438
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:55,426
You see where she leads.

439
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:22,396
You have a good weekend.

440
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,136
You too.

441
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:25,506
Drive carefully.

442
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:28,166
- I will.
- Bye-bye.

443
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,476
I'll call you.

444
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:54,516
Ain't you got nothing better to do 
than to jack off the damn machine?

445
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,416
What are you doing here, cowboy?

446
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:59,516
I came in here 
to jack off the damn machine.

447
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,256
One dead psychology professor.

448
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:06,356
Dr. Noah Goldstein. 
And guess what?

449
00:46:06,436 --> 00:46:09,306
He was her counselor.

450
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:10,676
Was she a suspect?

451
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:13,666
No, sir. 
They never even got a statement from her.

452
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:17,376
Hazel Dobkins?

453
00:46:17,446 --> 00:46:19,306
Do you know her?

454
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,906
Couldn't get it out of my head for years.

455
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:24,506
Nice little housewife. 
Three little kids.

456
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:28,356
Nice husband wasn't porking around. 
No financial problems.

457
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:33,256
One day, out of the clear blue sky, 
she does them, all of them.

458
00:46:33,296 --> 00:46:36,356
Used a knife she got for a wedding present.

459
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:39,696
Didn't even deny it. 
Sweet as honey.

460
00:46:39,936 --> 00:46:42,666
Said she didn't know why she'd done it.

461
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:58,386
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?

462
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,416
No, come on in.

463
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:04,426
Let's go upstairs.

464
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:23,536
I'm using you for my detective in my book.

465
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,906
You don't mind, do you?

466
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:32,416
I was just gonna make myself a drink.

467
00:47:32,456 --> 00:47:34,446
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

468
00:47:34,526 --> 00:47:38,456
Oh, right. 
You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

469
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,326
I've got a few more questions to ask you.

470
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:47,456
I have some for you too. 
For my book.

471
00:47:57,476 --> 00:48:00,466
Do you have something against ice cubes?

472
00:48:00,516 --> 00:48:02,506
I like rough edges.

473
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,546
So, what did you want to ask me?

474
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:08,116
How does it feel to kill someone?

475
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:12,426
You tell me.

476
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,986
I don't know, but you do.

477
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:20,466
It was an accident.

478
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:22,436
They got in the line of fire.

479
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:29,506
Four shootings in five years, 
all accidents?

480
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:34,376
They were drug buys. 
I was working undercover.

481
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,186
You want to tell me 
about Professor Goldstein?

482
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:44,526
Well, there's a name from the past.

483
00:48:44,596 --> 00:48:47,896
You want a name from the present? 
What about Hazel Dobkins?

484
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,466
Noah Goldstein was my counselor, 
my fresh man year. 

485
00:48:53,536 --> 00:48:56,996
That's probably where I got the idea 
for the ice pick for my book.

486
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,166
Funny how the subconscious works.

487
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:02,866
Hilarious.

488
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:08,986
- Hazel's my friend.
- Your friend took out her whole family.

489
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:12,146
Yes, she helped me understand homicidal impulse.

490
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:14,156
I thought you would have learned that at school.

491
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:17,926
Only in theory.

492
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:23,126
But you know all about homicidal impulse, 
don't you, shooter?

493
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:28,096
Not in theory, in practice.

494
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:31,966
What happened? 
Did you get sucked into it?

495
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:34,876
Did you like it too much?

496
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:39,376
I don't know what you're talking about.

497
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:43,976
Tell me about the coke, Nick.

498
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:49,046
The day you shot those two tourists...

499
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:51,096
how much coke did you do?

500
00:49:54,896 --> 00:49:58,096
Come on, you can tell me.

501
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:07,906
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

502
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:11,176
They never tested you, did they?

503
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,186
Internal Affairs knew.

504
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,246
Your wife knew too, didn't she?

505
00:50:24,556 --> 00:50:27,086
She knew what was going on.

506
00:50:29,966 --> 00:50:31,956
I think you got too close to the flame.

507
00:50:39,976 --> 00:50:41,966
I think you liked it.

508
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,076
That's why she killed herself.

509
00:51:04,296 --> 00:51:06,286
Hi, hon.

510
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:13,996
You two have met, haven't you?

511
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:26,076
You're gonna make a terrific character, Nick.

512
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:38,600
She's on the phone. 
She'll be right with you.

513
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:43,296
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Detective, you can't go in...

514
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:46,066
- Who's got access to my file?
- What are you talking about?

515
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:48,196
Who has access to my goddamn file?

516
00:51:48,276 --> 00:51:52,106
Nobody. It's a confidential psychiatric record. 
It would be illegal.

517
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:54,946
Don't you fucking lie to me!

518
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:56,986
It was Internal Affairs, wasn't it?

519
00:51:57,056 --> 00:51:58,076
No, please.

520
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,126
- Who?
- It's Nilson.

521
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:14,336
What do you want, Curran?

522
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:16,026
You sold her my file, didn't you?

523
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,126
Who are you talking about?

524
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,576
Catherine Tramell. 
How much did she pay you?

525
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:25,246
Hey, Curran, come on! 
Damn it, stop it!

526
00:52:25,316 --> 00:52:26,576
How much?

527
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:32,576
Hey, back off! 
Back off, Curran!

528
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,956
Nice and easy now. 
Nice and easy.

529
00:52:36,026 --> 00:52:38,956
You fucked yourself, shooter. 
You hear me? You are out!

530
00:52:39,026 --> 00:52:41,426
- Curran, take it easy.
- You are out!

531
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:44,596
Save it, save it.

532
00:52:48,106 --> 00:52:50,296
- What's going down, Hoss?
- Nothing. I'll be okay.

533
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,636
- They're gonna want your badge.
- I'm tired of being played with.

534
00:52:53,976 --> 00:52:56,306
You got a real conclusive way 
of demonstrating that.

535
00:53:02,286 --> 00:53:05,916
She knows where I live and breathe.

536
00:53:07,386 --> 00:53:09,356
She's coming after me, Gus.

537
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:12,296
What is it you got between you?

538
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:19,956
- I don't know.
- Something, though.

539
00:53:20,036 --> 00:53:23,096
Something.

540
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:44,156
Nick, are you there?

541
00:53:44,196 --> 00:53:47,126
Go away, Beth. 
I don't want to see you.

542
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:56,196
I still have my key.

543
00:53:58,006 --> 00:53:59,936
Put them on the table and leave.

544
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,176
Put them on the goddamn table and leave!

545
00:54:05,246 --> 00:54:08,276
Damn it! Don't shove me out! 
You owe me more than that!

546
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,356
I don't owe you anything!

547
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:16,256
And you don't owe me anything.

548
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:19,386
We went to bed, what, 10, 15 times?

549
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:23,256
It wasn't memorable enough 
to carry an obligation.

550
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:27,926
Sometimes I really hate you.

551
00:54:27,966 --> 00:54:30,456
Why don't you get yourself 
some friendly little therapist...

552
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,166
to work out some of that hostility?

553
00:54:33,206 --> 00:54:36,336
And maybe you can get off once in a while.

554
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:42,076
Are you nuts?

555
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:52,456
I'm sorry.

556
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:57,326
I don't usually act like that.

557
00:54:57,396 --> 00:55:00,166
How could you give him my file?

558
00:55:00,236 --> 00:55:01,926
I had to!

559
00:55:02,006 --> 00:55:05,936
He was going to recommend 
your discharge from the force.

560
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:09,166
He didn't buy my evaluation. 
He said I wasn't objective.

561
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:13,116
So I made a deal with him 
to review the session notes himself.

562
00:55:13,116 --> 00:55:15,346
I didn't think he'd show them to anybody.

563
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:18,286
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

564
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,086
I care about you. I did it for you.

565
00:55:26,296 --> 00:55:30,026
Go away. Please, just go away.

566
00:56:04,396 --> 00:56:07,336
I'm on my way.

567
00:56:57,556 --> 00:57:02,116
One shot. Close range. 
Probably a .38 caliber revolver.

568
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,016
Give me your gun, Nick.

569
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:17,466
You think that...

570
00:57:21,376 --> 00:57:25,276
I don't, Hoss. 
But I got the minority opinion.

571
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:34,276
Okay, I went after him! 
I lost my temper.

572
00:57:34,356 --> 00:57:37,346
Do you have any evidence that he showed 
your psychiatric file to anyone?

573
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,296
We'll speak with you afterwards, Dr. Garner.

574
00:57:46,336 --> 00:57:48,326
- I'd like to sit in.
- I'd really rather wait...

575
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:52,336
It's all right if Dr. Garner sits in, 
if Detective Curran doesn't object.

576
00:57:58,246 --> 00:58:01,216
- Where were you last night?
- Home, watching TV.

577
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:03,046
All night?

578
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:05,246
Yes, all night.

579
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,476
Were you drinking?

580
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:13,086
Yeah, I was drinking.

581
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:16,096
- When did you start drinking again?
- A couple of days ago.

582
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:19,366
I saw Detective Curran at his apartment 
about 10:00 last night.

583
00:58:19,436 --> 00:58:21,336
He was sober and lucid.

584
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:24,166
I asked him, in my capacity 
as his departmental therapist...

585
00:58:24,206 --> 00:58:26,296
about his altercation with Lieutenant Nilsen.

586
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,636
He expressed regret 
and displayed no hostility.

587
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:33,476
- How long were you at his apartment?
- About 15 minutes.

588
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:37,136
I saw there was no reason 
for my concern and left.

589
00:58:37,216 --> 00:58:39,876
There's no smoking in this building, Detective.

590
00:58:42,126 --> 00:58:44,086
What are you gonna do? 
Charge me with smoking?

591
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:49,326
Oh, for Christ's... All right, Nick, 
I'm gonna ask you this just once.

592
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:52,666
For the record, did you kill Marty Nilsen?

593
00:58:54,466 --> 00:58:56,496
No.

594
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,296
I'm gonna storm into his office 
in front of everybody...

595
00:58:59,376 --> 00:59:01,346
in the middle of the day 
and kill him that night?

596
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:03,346
I'm not that dumb.

597
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:07,366
Going after him before gets you off the hook 
for killing him. That's your alibi.

598
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:11,076
Like writing a book about killing a guy 
gets you off the hook for killing him.

599
00:59:11,156 --> 00:59:12,136
Good point.

600
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,156
What are you talking about?

601
00:59:14,186 --> 00:59:17,486
- A private joke, asshole.
- I don't think it's funny.

602
00:59:17,656 --> 00:59:19,126
You're going on leave...

603
00:59:20,196 --> 00:59:23,456
pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation.

604
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:38,206
I'll get my stuff in a minute.

605
00:59:42,586 --> 00:59:43,916
Thank you.

606
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:50,446
It's the least I could do.

607
00:59:50,526 --> 00:59:53,356
Considering I got you into this mess 
with those reports.

608
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:56,196
No, I mean it. 
Thank you.

609
00:59:57,996 --> 01:00:00,966
How do you know 
Catherine Tramell saw your file?

610
01:00:01,006 --> 01:00:04,666
She knows things about me 
that I only told you.

611
01:00:04,906 --> 01:00:07,306
She must really be something.

612
01:00:07,376 --> 01:00:09,866
From a clinical point of view.

613
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:12,506
- What was she like in school?
- I hardly knew her.

614
01:00:12,546 --> 01:00:14,346
She gave me the creeps.

615
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:16,346
I don't know why.

616
01:00:20,456 --> 01:00:23,476
Get some rest. 
Promise?

617
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:32,486
- I didn't mean what I said about...
- Yes, you did.

618
01:00:32,566 --> 01:00:35,536
I'm a big girl. 
I can handle it.

619
01:00:59,396 --> 01:01:02,486
- You take care of yourself.
- What'd you find out about the parents?

620
01:01:02,566 --> 01:01:05,496
No lead, man.

621
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:08,896
You're on psycho leave. 
I'm talking to a possible wacko!

622
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:11,906
You know I'm wacko. 
What'd you find out?

623
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:19,006
The boat blew. 
There was a leak in the fuel line.

624
01:01:19,216 --> 01:01:23,046
There were two previous repairs 
and a five mil policy on both of them.

625
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,416
A real heavy investigation 
but they got zilch.

626
01:01:25,456 --> 01:01:28,286
Big goose egg. 
It was an "accident."

627
01:01:28,326 --> 01:01:31,916
I.A.'s gonna talk to you about Nilsen. 
They're handling the investigation.

628
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:34,486
Stay in touch with Dr. Garner. 
It'll help on the evaluation.

629
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:38,256
She killed him.

630
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:39,896
Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?

631
01:01:39,936 --> 01:01:41,866
Catherine Tramell. 
It's part of her game.

632
01:01:41,936 --> 01:01:45,966
First you got her stealing your file, 
now she's killing Nilsen?

633
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,976
Forget about her! 
Go somewhere, sit in the sun.

634
01:01:49,046 --> 01:01:52,446
- Get her the hell out of your system!
- You don't buy it, do you?

635
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:54,876
She knew nobody'd buy it.

636
01:01:54,946 --> 01:01:58,316
She knew I'd say she did it 
and nobody'd buy it!

637
01:01:58,356 --> 01:02:01,516
She is screwing with your head! 
Stay away from her!

638
01:02:29,086 --> 01:02:30,516
I heard what happened.

639
01:02:39,296 --> 01:02:42,356
What good's a shooter without his gun?

640
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,396
- How exactly did you find out?
- I have attorneys.

641
01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:48,436
They have friends. I have friends.

642
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:51,096
Money buys a lot of attorneys and friends.

643
01:02:51,306 --> 01:02:53,436
I wouldn't know about that. 
I don't have any money...

644
01:02:53,506 --> 01:02:57,306
I don't have any attorneys, 
and Gus is my only real friend.

645
01:02:57,376 --> 01:02:59,436
I wasn't talking about real friends.

646
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,316
Why doesn't Gus like me?

647
01:03:07,086 --> 01:03:09,116
I like you.

648
01:03:09,326 --> 01:03:11,886
- You do?
- Yes.

649
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:16,126
You want to go upstairs and have a drink?

650
01:03:17,396 --> 01:03:19,126
I didn't think you'd ask me.

651
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:23,136
I guess you don't know your character that well.

652
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:27,036
Maybe, but I'm learning.

653
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:29,936
Pretty soon I'll know you better 
than you know yourself.

654
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:32,106
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?

655
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:34,946
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?

656
01:03:44,996 --> 01:03:47,156
You should put some warmth into the place.

657
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:49,956
You don't want it 
to reflect your personality.

658
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:51,556
I'm not trying to fool anybody.

659
01:03:51,636 --> 01:03:54,466
Jack Daniels all right? 
It's going to have to be.

660
01:03:54,506 --> 01:03:56,466
- Ice?
- Great.

661
01:04:04,976 --> 01:04:06,066
I was expecting you.

662
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,546
K-Mart. 
A buck, sixty-five.

663
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:21,156
Why don't you let me do this for you.

664
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:31,406
You like watching me do it, don't you?

665
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:37,006
Could I have a cigarette too, please?

666
01:04:37,046 --> 01:04:39,516
I told you you'd start smoking again.

667
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:42,536
Would you light it for me?

668
01:04:47,756 --> 01:04:49,686
Thanks.

669
01:04:51,386 --> 01:04:55,916
So how much did you pay Nilsen for my file?

670
01:04:55,956 --> 01:05:00,416
Isn't he the policeman 
that you shot, shooter?

671
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,796
What if I ask you 
not to call me "shooter"?

672
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:06,426
Okay. How about if I call you Nicky?

673
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:10,496
My wife used to call me Nicky.

674
01:05:10,846 --> 01:05:15,146
Yeah, I know. 
I like it.

675
01:05:18,516 --> 01:05:21,386
Cheers. 
My friends call me Catherine.

676
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,186
What did Manny Vasquez call you?

677
01:05:24,226 --> 01:05:26,056
Bitch, mostly.

678
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:28,456
But he meant it affectionately.

679
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:32,116
Do you have any coke?

680
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:35,456
I just love coke with Jack Daniels.

681
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,466
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

682
01:05:37,536 --> 01:05:41,096
It's not really the same thing now, is it?

683
01:05:41,406 --> 01:05:43,376
No, it's not.

684
01:05:46,386 --> 01:05:48,346
So where's this going?

685
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:54,116
What do you want from me?

686
01:05:56,456 --> 01:06:00,186
Say, "what do you want from me, Catherine?"

687
01:06:01,496 --> 01:06:05,126
What the fuck do you want from me, Catherine?

688
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:14,096
Brought you something.

689
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:23,246
Aren't you going to say thank-you?

690
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:26,586
- What's it about?
- It's about a boy who kills his parents.

691
01:06:26,656 --> 01:06:29,646
They have a play, 
and he makes it look like an accident.

692
01:06:32,996 --> 01:06:34,156
Why did he do that?

693
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:38,656
To see if he could get away with it.

694
01:06:41,406 --> 01:06:43,066
When did you write this?

695
01:06:44,106 --> 01:06:47,076
You mean, did I write it 
before my parents died?

696
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:54,676
No. I wrote it years afterwards.

697
01:06:56,416 --> 01:07:00,116
You wont stop following me around now 
just because you're on leave?

698
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:01,456
Absolutely not.

699
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:05,256
Good, I'd miss you.

700
01:07:05,326 --> 01:07:07,486
You could get in trouble. 
You're not really a cop anymore.

701
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:10,656
- I'll risk it.
- Why take the risk?

702
01:07:10,996 --> 01:07:13,936
To see if I can get away with it.

703
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:19,636
- How's your new book?
- Practically writing itself.

704
01:07:20,976 --> 01:07:24,176
I'll be leaving about midnight, 
in case you are going to follow me.

705
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:30,446
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.
- I'll meet you there.

706
01:07:32,086 --> 01:07:34,016
Hi, Gus.

707
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:53,266
Forgive me for asking, 
and I don't mean to belabor the obvious... 

708
01:07:53,306 --> 01:07:57,336
but why've you got your head 
so far up your own ass?

709
01:07:57,416 --> 01:08:00,436
She wants to play. 
Fine, I can play.

710
01:08:02,216 --> 01:08:04,416
Everybody she plays with dies.

711
01:08:05,486 --> 01:08:08,076
I know what that's like.

712
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:04,476
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

713
01:16:37,096 --> 01:16:40,066
If you don't leave her alone, 
I'll kill you.

714
01:16:46,136 --> 01:16:48,406
Let me ask you something, "Rocky."

715
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:51,576
Man to man.

716
01:16:54,046 --> 01:16:56,646
I think she's the fuck of the century.

717
01:17:00,526 --> 01:17:02,516
What do you think?

718
01:17:07,026 --> 01:17:08,556
How long you been here?

719
01:17:10,196 --> 01:17:13,096
You like watching, don't you?

720
01:17:16,566 --> 01:17:18,566
She likes me to watch.

721
01:18:03,186 --> 01:18:05,156
Oh, God.

722
01:18:10,026 --> 01:18:12,186
<i>The beach C</i>

723
01:18:55,206 --> 01:18:57,136
Good morning.

724
01:18:58,236 --> 01:19:00,536
I guess Roxy's not taking this too well.

725
01:19:01,476 --> 01:19:04,566
She's seen me fuck plenty of guys.

726
01:19:04,616 --> 01:19:09,446
Well, maybe she saw something 
she's never seen before.

727
01:19:09,486 --> 01:19:11,216
She's seen everything before.

728
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:14,656
Honey, I thought I'd seen everything before.

729
01:19:14,986 --> 01:19:17,286
Did you really think it was so special?

730
01:19:17,496 --> 01:19:21,156
I told her I thought 
it was the fuck of the century.

731
01:19:26,236 --> 01:19:27,966
What do you think?

732
01:19:28,036 --> 01:19:32,026
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

733
01:19:35,946 --> 01:19:37,206
What about Roxy?

734
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:39,546
Is she more fun?

735
01:19:39,616 --> 01:19:42,546
Would you like her to join us sometime?

736
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:47,346
- Did she join you and Johnny?
- No, he felt intimidated.

737
01:19:47,526 --> 01:19:49,616
Look what happened to him.

738
01:19:49,686 --> 01:19:52,596
Tell me, were you frightened last night?

739
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:54,186
That's the point, wasn't it?

740
01:19:54,266 --> 01:19:56,256
That's what made it so good.

741
01:19:57,636 --> 01:20:01,626
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.

742
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:03,106
You're in over your head.

743
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:07,096
Maybe, but this is how I'll catch my killer.

744
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:16,576
I'm not going to confess all my secrets 
just because I have an orgasm.

745
01:20:16,576 --> 01:20:19,276
You won't learn anything 
I don't want you to know.

746
01:20:19,316 --> 01:20:23,616
Yes, I will. 
Then I'll nail you.

747
01:20:23,616 --> 01:20:27,256
You'll just fall in love with me.

748
01:20:27,296 --> 01:20:29,316
I'm in love with you already.

749
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:35,366
But I'll nail you anyway.

750
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:39,096
You can put that in your book.

751
01:20:43,346 --> 01:20:44,576
<i>No</i>

752
01:20:44,616 --> 01:20:48,566
<i>Not that bar again</i>

753
01:20:50,186 --> 01:20:53,416
<i>Oh, I want to know you're the one</i>

754
01:20:53,586 --> 01:20:56,746
<i>And I don't mean the one I regret</i>

755
01:20:59,196 --> 01:21:01,096
<i>The heart's still going</i>

756
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:04,256
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Where the fuck you been?

757
01:21:04,296 --> 01:21:08,136
- I've been over to your place.
- Easy, cowboy, easy.

758
01:21:09,266 --> 01:21:13,176
- I wasn't there.
- I went over last night too.

759
01:21:14,246 --> 01:21:16,406
Well, I wasn't there either.

760
01:21:22,246 --> 01:21:23,716
You fucked her.

761
01:21:24,576 --> 01:21:27,616
God damned, dumb son of a bitch!

762
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,116
You fucked her!

763
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:32,286
God damn! You are one...

764
01:21:32,356 --> 01:21:34,346
dumb son of a bitch!

765
01:21:34,396 --> 01:21:35,586
Next time, I'll use a rubber.

766
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:40,396
I don't give a flying, 
chili bean fart about that!

767
01:21:40,466 --> 01:21:43,436
- How about it, Harry. How much?
- Thirty-two.

768
01:21:43,606 --> 01:21:46,166
I'm worried about him, 
he's worried about rubbers.

769
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:48,136
You really gotta protect yourself.

770
01:21:48,206 --> 01:21:50,736
What in the hell for?

771
01:21:51,076 --> 01:21:56,276
You think I'm getting any? 
Sure, I can get laid by blue haired women!

772
01:21:56,346 --> 01:22:00,046
- I don't like them!
- Don't knock it 'til you tried it!

773
01:22:06,196 --> 01:22:07,286
Feeling better?

774
01:22:07,326 --> 01:22:10,266
I feel fine.

775
01:22:10,296 --> 01:22:11,456
How could you fuck her?

776
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,436
Come on.

777
01:22:18,336 --> 01:22:20,466
You want to die, Hoss?

778
01:22:20,676 --> 01:22:22,646
What is it? 
Those tourists?

779
01:22:24,116 --> 01:22:28,446
You still so bad about that, 
you're wiggling your way into an ice pick?

780
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:31,646
Got too many god damn tourists 
coming here anyway!

781
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:35,516
- Hold it down.
- Plenty more where they came from!

782
01:22:45,396 --> 01:22:47,196
I'm not afraid of her.

783
01:22:47,236 --> 01:22:48,466
Why the hell not?

784
01:22:51,336 --> 01:22:53,306
I don't know.

785
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:54,496
I'm just not.

786
01:22:54,706 --> 01:22:57,196
That's her pussy talking! 
It ain't your brain!

787
01:22:57,276 --> 01:22:59,506
Come on.

788
01:23:08,086 --> 01:23:12,256
I.A. did a track on Lieutenant Martin 
D-for-dickhead Nilsen. 

789
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:15,486
They found a safety deposit box 
with $50,000 in it...

790
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:18,726
taken out three months ago 
and not used since.

791
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:23,536
That doesn't make any sense. 
She didn't know me three months ago.

792
01:23:23,536 --> 01:23:25,466
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.

793
01:23:25,536 --> 01:23:28,376
Maybe the money was for something else. 
How the fuck do I know?

794
01:23:31,536 --> 01:23:37,006
I'm just an old city cowboy 
trying not to fall out of his saddle.

795
01:23:50,566 --> 01:23:53,496
- All right, cowboy?
- Yeah.

796
01:23:53,496 --> 01:23:55,496
Come on. 
I'm going to drive you home.

797
01:23:55,496 --> 01:23:58,196
In that little piss-ant car of yours?

798
01:23:58,236 --> 01:24:02,296
Hell, no. I ain't getting 
no back pain disability retirement.

799
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:07,436
I'm gonna get a full pension 
and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

800
01:24:07,516 --> 01:24:09,116
I'm driving you...

801
01:24:09,116 --> 01:24:11,316
You're not driving my Cadillac car!

802
01:24:11,386 --> 01:24:16,256
I won't let no head-up-his-ass person 
drive my Cadillac car!

803
01:24:16,326 --> 01:24:17,486
So long!

804
01:26:17,446 --> 01:26:19,416
You wanna play? Come on!

805
01:27:30,146 --> 01:27:32,276
Lieutenant! 
I got the information.

806
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:34,326
Get it down here!

807
01:27:34,326 --> 01:27:36,656
You signed your name 
to this crock of shit?

808
01:27:36,656 --> 01:27:38,316
Why not? 
It was an accident.

809
01:27:38,356 --> 01:27:42,386
"Your driving around North Beach 
and this car won't get out of the way."

810
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,326
I don't think she meant to go off the edge.

811
01:27:44,366 --> 01:27:47,166
- Could we have him for a minute?
- No, you can't!

812
01:27:47,196 --> 01:27:51,156
Don't fuck with me on this. 
I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

813
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:54,466
Full name is Roxanne Hardy. 
Last known address, Cloverdale, California.

814
01:27:54,506 --> 01:27:56,496
No priors, no convictions.

815
01:27:56,576 --> 01:27:59,736
Car is registered to Catherine Trammel.

816
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:01,936
- You knew her!
- I met her at Trammel's house.

817
01:28:01,986 --> 01:28:03,446
All I did was write her name down.

818
01:28:03,516 --> 01:28:06,606
You wrote her name down 
and then big surprise...

819
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,346
she rolls her car down a hill and dies.

820
01:28:09,426 --> 01:28:13,286
- Is that what you're telling me?
- That's all I know.

821
01:28:13,326 --> 01:28:16,416
You know what then? Fuck you!

822
01:28:18,396 --> 01:28:21,386
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office...
- I told you to stay away from Trammel!

823
01:28:21,436 --> 01:28:23,196
You didn't tell me 
to stay away from the car!

824
01:28:23,236 --> 01:28:27,536
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office!
- Who are you selling my file to now?

825
01:28:29,276 --> 01:28:32,436
You are out of control, Curran. 
You hear me?

826
01:28:41,756 --> 01:28:44,656
Hello, Nick. 
This is Dr. Myron...

827
01:28:44,726 --> 01:28:46,656
and Dr. McElwaine.

828
01:28:48,296 --> 01:28:53,166
They've been asked to consult with me 
on this psychiatric evaluation.

829
01:28:53,336 --> 01:28:55,126
Sit down.

830
01:29:02,146 --> 01:29:05,576
We understand you're having difficulty 
controlling your temper lately.

831
01:29:05,646 --> 01:29:08,376
Only in regard to one person.

832
01:29:09,446 --> 01:29:13,316
Do you think Lieutenant Nilsen 
deserved to die?

833
01:29:14,486 --> 01:29:16,426
I didn't know him well enough.

834
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:17,686
I won't miss him.

835
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:23,356
When you recollect your childhood...

836
01:29:23,426 --> 01:29:26,056
are your recollections pleasing to you?

837
01:29:29,066 --> 01:29:33,476
Number one: I don't remember how often 
I jerked off, but it was a lot.

838
01:29:33,506 --> 01:29:35,736
Number two: 
I wasn't pissed off at my dad...

839
01:29:36,076 --> 01:29:38,666
even when I was old enough to know 
what he and mom did in the bedroom.

840
01:29:38,746 --> 01:29:42,076
Number three: 
I don't look in the toilet before I flush.

841
01:29:42,146 --> 01:29:45,486
Number four: 
I haven't wet my bed for a long time.

842
01:29:45,556 --> 01:29:47,676
Number five...

843
01:29:47,756 --> 01:29:50,156
why don't the two of you go fuck yourselves.

844
01:29:50,186 --> 01:29:52,156
I'm out of here.

845
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:01,556
What's your problem? 
I'm trying to help.

846
01:30:01,636 --> 01:30:03,466
- Why won't you let me?
- I don't want your help!

847
01:30:03,536 --> 01:30:05,436
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do!

848
01:30:05,506 --> 01:30:07,496
Something's going on.

849
01:30:07,576 --> 01:30:09,596
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

850
01:30:09,646 --> 01:30:13,606
- Why are you interested in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.

851
01:30:13,646 --> 01:30:15,616
She seduces and manipulates people.

852
01:30:15,686 --> 01:30:18,376
- She'll do anything she can...
- I thought you hardly knew her?

853
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:20,746
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
- That means...

854
01:30:21,086 --> 01:30:23,576
you manipulate people too!

855
01:30:23,656 --> 01:30:25,746
You're a practicing psychologist.

856
01:30:26,126 --> 01:30:28,186
You're better at it than she is!

857
01:30:29,726 --> 01:30:32,696
I feel sorry for you!

858
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:32,146
I should have known.

859
01:31:36,226 --> 01:31:38,756
I came in to the house.

860
01:31:38,836 --> 01:31:40,696
When we were down on the beach...

861
01:31:42,466 --> 01:31:45,126
she looked at me so strangely.

862
01:31:47,636 --> 01:31:49,806
She left right after you.

863
01:31:54,546 --> 01:31:56,536
I...

864
01:31:57,586 --> 01:32:00,646
I shouldn't have let her watch us.

865
01:32:02,586 --> 01:32:05,246
She wanted to watch me all the time.

866
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:15,756
She tried to kill you, didn't she?

867
01:32:16,106 --> 01:32:20,296
- Did you like her to watch you?
- You think I told her to kill you?

868
01:32:20,506 --> 01:32:22,306
No.

869
01:32:25,276 --> 01:32:29,216
Everybody that I care about...

870
01:32:29,286 --> 01:32:31,246
dies.

871
01:32:50,736 --> 01:32:52,676
Make love to me.

872
01:33:12,226 --> 01:33:16,186
You think she killed Johnny Boz?

873
01:33:16,226 --> 01:33:19,286
For what, to set me up?

874
01:33:19,366 --> 01:33:21,736
She loved me. 
She wouldn't frame me.

875
01:33:22,736 --> 01:33:27,106
- Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.
- No, she didn't.

876
01:33:27,176 --> 01:33:30,146
She'd never get jealous before.

877
01:33:30,206 --> 01:33:32,196
She got excited.

878
01:33:35,246 --> 01:33:38,216
I don't have luck with women.

879
01:33:39,686 --> 01:33:41,816
There was this girl...

880
01:33:42,156 --> 01:33:44,626
I met when I was in college.

881
01:33:44,656 --> 01:33:46,216
I slept with her once.

882
01:33:46,296 --> 01:33:50,786
She started following me around, 
taking my picture.

883
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:55,296
She dyed her hair, copied my clothes.

884
01:33:55,366 --> 01:33:57,336
Lisa...

885
01:33:58,376 --> 01:34:00,306
something, Oberman.

886
01:34:04,376 --> 01:34:06,366
It was awful.

887
01:34:08,386 --> 01:34:10,376
I thought you didn't make confessions.

888
01:34:14,686 --> 01:34:16,716
I never did before.

889
01:34:27,136 --> 01:34:28,296
Another nice girl.

890
01:34:47,286 --> 01:34:48,756
How old was she when it happened?

891
01:34:48,786 --> 01:34:50,776
Sixteen.

892
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:53,386
We seal juvenile records 
until they're deceased.

893
01:34:53,456 --> 01:34:55,396
That's why you couldn't find it 
in your computer.

894
01:34:55,466 --> 01:34:58,256
What was the motive?

895
01:34:58,336 --> 01:35:01,236
She said she didn't know. 
Just sort of did it on impulse.

896
01:35:01,266 --> 01:35:05,256
The razor just happened to be there. 
That's what she said.

897
01:35:10,776 --> 01:35:14,716
- Help yourself to some coffee.
- Thanks.

898
01:35:14,776 --> 01:35:17,716
I don't understand what the hell 
is going on here.

899
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:20,246
It ain't hard, Hoss. 
This young farm girl...

900
01:35:20,286 --> 01:35:23,656
got tired of all that attention 
going to her little brothers...

901
01:35:23,686 --> 01:35:25,786
so she fixed them.

902
01:35:26,126 --> 01:35:29,116
Just like old Hazel Dobkins 
fixed her whole family.

903
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:31,726
Except young Roxy here, 
didn't use a wedding present.

904
01:35:31,796 --> 01:35:34,396
She used daddy's razor.

905
01:35:43,376 --> 01:35:45,276
Sure makes you wonder what they talk about...

906
01:35:45,346 --> 01:35:48,336
when they sit in front 
of the campfire at night.

907
01:35:48,386 --> 01:35:51,786
You ever met a friend of hers 
that hasn't killed somebody?

908
01:35:51,816 --> 01:35:54,816
Must of beat your ordinary, 
every day girl talk.

909
01:35:54,816 --> 01:35:57,416
I'm not sure, anymore, she did it.

910
01:35:57,456 --> 01:35:59,516
Which one we talking about now?

911
01:35:59,696 --> 01:36:02,786
We know Hazel did it. 
We know young Roxy did it.

912
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:04,356
And the other one...

913
01:36:04,396 --> 01:36:09,736
She's got that magna cum laude pussy 
that fried up your brain.

914
01:36:28,856 --> 01:36:31,416
"Oberman, Mark W., Donald M."

915
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:33,856
Sorry, no "Lisa."

916
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:36,596
You sure about the year?

917
01:36:36,766 --> 01:36:39,756
Catherine Tramell graduated in '83.

918
01:36:39,796 --> 01:36:43,566
She said Lisa Oberman was here 
at the same time.

919
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,136
Yeah, we have Tramell.

920
01:36:51,576 --> 01:36:53,166
But no Lisa Oberman.

921
01:36:53,216 --> 01:36:55,546
Are you sure? 
There can't be a mistake?

922
01:36:57,346 --> 01:36:59,746
Only if you're making it, Detective.

923
01:37:14,336 --> 01:37:17,136
Hazel, this is Nick. 
I told you all about him.

924
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,196
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.

925
01:37:19,276 --> 01:37:21,326
You're the shooter, aren't you?

926
01:37:21,406 --> 01:37:23,376
How are you?

927
01:37:23,406 --> 01:37:26,206
Fine, thank you. 
Can I speak to you for a minute?

928
01:37:26,276 --> 01:37:30,576
Would you wait for me in the car? 
I'll be right there.

929
01:37:31,786 --> 01:37:33,586
Good-bye, shooter.

930
01:37:35,326 --> 01:37:38,186
You like to hang out with murderers, or what?

931
01:37:38,256 --> 01:37:41,316
- You know that Roxy was involved...
- Yes, of course, I knew.

932
01:37:41,396 --> 01:37:44,326
I write about unusual people,
 and sometimes when I do my research...

933
01:37:44,366 --> 01:37:46,626
I get involved with them.

934
01:37:46,666 --> 01:37:49,256
It happened with you.

935
01:37:50,436 --> 01:37:53,336
Killing isn't like smoking.

936
01:37:53,376 --> 01:37:55,566
You can quit.

937
01:37:57,846 --> 01:38:00,276
I gotta go.

938
01:38:01,476 --> 01:38:03,506
I promised I'd get her home by 6:00.

939
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:06,376
She just loves "America's Most Wanted."

940
01:38:06,416 --> 01:38:10,186
There was no Lisa Oberman 
when you were at Berkeley.

941
01:38:10,226 --> 01:38:13,416
What are you doing? 
Checking up on me?

942
01:38:13,456 --> 01:38:16,516
For what? 
I said "Hoberman."

943
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:23,306
"Hoberman." Lisa Hoberman, with an H.

944
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:26,636
You do?

945
01:38:28,646 --> 01:38:31,506
All right. 
Thank you very much.

946
01:38:35,476 --> 01:38:37,386
You know I can get my butt kicked for this.

947
01:38:37,446 --> 01:38:39,616
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- Come on, Sam.

948
01:38:39,686 --> 01:38:42,416
- This is only gonna take a minute.
- Yeah.

949
01:38:51,326 --> 01:38:53,226
Bring it up.

950
01:38:55,606 --> 01:38:58,296
That's Dr. Garner, isn't it?

951
01:39:00,276 --> 01:39:02,606
Bring up '83.

952
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:21,616
You shouldn't leave your door open.

953
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:26,596
I didn't. 
There's something wrong with my lock.

954
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:28,256
What do you want?

955
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:29,456
Tell me about Catherine.

956
01:39:32,376 --> 01:39:35,136
She told you, didn't she?

957
01:39:35,176 --> 01:39:37,666
What did she tell me?

958
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:43,346
I slept with her once in school.

959
01:39:43,386 --> 01:39:46,576
I was just a kid. 
I was experimenting.

960
01:39:46,656 --> 01:39:50,216
It was just that one time.

961
01:39:50,286 --> 01:39:52,726
She developed a fixation on me.

962
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:56,256
She styled her hair like mine, 
wore the same kind of clothes as I did.

963
01:39:56,326 --> 01:39:58,316
It scared me.

964
01:40:01,336 --> 01:40:04,266
Isn't that what she told you?

965
01:40:04,336 --> 01:40:06,676
She said it was you.

966
01:40:06,676 --> 01:40:08,666
You dressed like her. 
You dyed your hair blonde...

967
01:40:08,746 --> 01:40:10,736
I did dye my hair. 
It had nothing to do with her.

968
01:40:10,776 --> 01:40:13,546
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

969
01:40:13,576 --> 01:40:15,706
- I had him for two classes.
- You saw all the reports.

970
01:40:16,216 --> 01:40:17,516
Phil copied you. 
You never said anything!

971
01:40:17,586 --> 01:40:19,376
What am I supposed to say?

972
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:22,686
"I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect"?

973
01:40:24,586 --> 01:40:29,526
I was embarrassed. 
It was the only time I'd been with a woman.

974
01:40:31,326 --> 01:40:33,386
She's really sick, you know.

975
01:40:33,466 --> 01:40:35,296
Do you know what she's doing?

976
01:40:35,336 --> 01:40:38,466
She knows I went to Berkeley. 
She knows I knew Noah.

977
01:40:38,536 --> 01:40:40,506
She makes up this story about me.

978
01:40:40,536 --> 01:40:43,236
She's handing you somebody 
who's obsessed with her.

979
01:40:43,276 --> 01:40:45,266
She didn't hand you to me. 
She doesn't know who you are.

980
01:40:45,346 --> 01:40:46,746
You told me about a Lisa Hoberman.

981
01:40:47,216 --> 01:40:50,376
She knows you'd find out who Lisa is. 
You're a good cop.

982
01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:53,556
She tell you casually?

983
01:40:53,616 --> 01:40:55,676
Make it seem irrelevant?

984
01:40:57,486 --> 01:40:59,476
Did she tell you in bed?

985
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:05,256
That's what I'd do.

986
01:41:07,596 --> 01:41:09,536
Why'd you change your name?

987
01:41:09,566 --> 01:41:12,536
I got married. 
He called me "Beth."

988
01:41:12,606 --> 01:41:15,166
He was on staff at the clinic in Salinas.

989
01:41:15,246 --> 01:41:17,436
Didn't last long.

990
01:41:20,576 --> 01:41:23,446
Do you really think 
that I could kill someone?

991
01:41:23,516 --> 01:41:25,416
I never even met Johnny Boz!

992
01:41:25,456 --> 01:41:28,746
And what about Nilsen? 
What motive would I have to kill him?

993
01:41:29,226 --> 01:41:31,716
- You should get that lock fixed.
- God...

994
01:41:31,756 --> 01:41:35,456
She's evil! She's brilliant!

995
01:42:00,416 --> 01:42:02,756
Did I scare you?

996
01:42:02,756 --> 01:42:05,346
I wanted to surprise you.

997
01:42:05,426 --> 01:42:08,356
- What's wrong?
- I found Lisa Hoberman.

998
01:42:08,426 --> 01:42:10,416
Oh, you did? 
What's she doing?

999
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:16,496
You're not going to tell me 
what she's doing.

1000
01:42:16,566 --> 01:42:19,736
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.

1001
01:42:20,206 --> 01:42:21,696
She said you got it backwards.

1002
01:42:21,736 --> 01:42:24,576
She said you styled your hair like she did.

1003
01:42:24,646 --> 01:42:26,666
And you believed her.

1004
01:42:27,746 --> 01:42:33,546
I had to go to the campus police 
and file a report about her.

1005
01:42:33,586 --> 01:42:37,446
- I suppose you still think I kill people too?
- No.

1006
01:42:41,426 --> 01:42:43,326
Liar.

1007
01:42:46,736 --> 01:42:50,566
- Who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide, San Francisco.

1008
01:42:53,336 --> 01:42:55,436
Here we go.

1009
01:42:55,506 --> 01:42:57,476
Kind of.

1010
01:42:57,506 --> 01:43:00,036
There was a report about Lisa Hoberman, 
January, 1980.

1011
01:43:00,076 --> 01:43:02,636
- But it's out of here.
- Who's got it?

1012
01:43:03,716 --> 01:43:05,706
One of your guys. Nilsen.

1013
01:43:06,086 --> 01:43:08,346
- You know him?
- Yeah.

1014
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:10,586
Thanks a lot.

1015
01:43:10,626 --> 01:43:13,556
Tell him to bring it back. 
He's had it a whole year.

1016
01:43:14,096 --> 01:43:17,086
So Nilsen had a report on Beth. 
You don't know what was in it.

1017
01:43:17,126 --> 01:43:19,616
- Catherine told me what was in it.
- If she's telling you the truth.

1018
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:21,426
Gus, don't you get it?

1019
01:43:21,496 --> 01:43:23,496
If Beth killed Johnny Boz 
to frame Catherine...

1020
01:43:23,536 --> 01:43:25,506
she wouldn't want anybody to know 
what happened in Berkeley!

1021
01:43:25,536 --> 01:43:28,596
But Nilsen found out about it. 
That gives her the motive to kill him.

1022
01:43:28,676 --> 01:43:31,646
How did she know Nilsen found out, 
if it happened?

1023
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:34,106
He probably asked her!

1024
01:43:34,316 --> 01:43:36,676
She'd have to be nuttier 
than a 20 pound fruitcake!

1025
01:43:36,746 --> 01:43:39,616
She's not the one who hangs out 
with multiple murderers!

1026
01:43:39,656 --> 01:43:42,316
- You're girlfriend is! 
- She's a writer! That's her job!

1027
01:43:42,386 --> 01:43:45,486
I don't buy it. There must be somebody 
at Berkeley who knows what happened!

1028
01:43:45,556 --> 01:43:47,496
I know what happened! 
Catherine told me!

1029
01:43:47,556 --> 01:43:50,616
- Everything she says has checked out!
- You got tweety birds...

1030
01:43:50,696 --> 01:43:52,726
fluttering around in your head!

1031
01:43:52,796 --> 01:43:55,126
You think you can fuck like minks, 
raise rug rats...

1032
01:43:55,296 --> 01:43:57,296
and live happily ever after?

1033
01:43:57,336 --> 01:43:59,306
Oh, man!

1034
01:44:11,386 --> 01:44:13,746
How'd you get in here?

1035
01:44:13,786 --> 01:44:15,656
What's this?

1036
01:44:15,726 --> 01:44:18,786
I decided to give you a second chance.

1037
01:44:19,126 --> 01:44:23,186
- I missed you.
- I wasn't gone long enough.

1038
01:44:23,366 --> 01:44:25,386
Did you miss me?

1039
01:44:25,466 --> 01:44:26,396
No.

1040
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:41,206
Why don't you come over here 
and tell me no.

1041
01:44:44,186 --> 01:44:46,376
- I've seen them before.
- Yeah?

1042
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:49,216
Well, you might not see them again.

1043
01:44:49,386 --> 01:44:51,416
My book's nearly finished.

1044
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,686
My detective's almost dead.

1045
01:44:53,756 --> 01:44:55,556
So I've got time for a last cigarette?

1046
01:44:55,626 --> 01:44:56,786
Afterwards.

1047
01:45:09,706 --> 01:45:12,476
I've got to do some research 
tomorrow morning.

1048
01:45:12,546 --> 01:45:15,516
I'm good at research. 
I'll help you.

1049
01:45:15,546 --> 01:45:17,416
No, thanks.

1050
01:45:17,486 --> 01:45:19,576
What are you researching?

1051
01:45:19,656 --> 01:45:21,206
Oh...

1052
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:23,756
a new ending to your book.

1053
01:45:24,126 --> 01:45:27,116
Oh, really? 
What's the twist?

1054
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:31,156
The detective falls for the wrong girl.

1055
01:45:31,196 --> 01:45:33,726
But he doesn't die.

1056
01:45:35,606 --> 01:45:38,596
So what happens to him?

1057
01:45:39,706 --> 01:45:43,196
They fuck like minks, raise rug rats...

1058
01:45:43,406 --> 01:45:45,206
and live happily ever after.

1059
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:48,646
It won't sell.

1060
01:45:49,746 --> 01:45:51,186
Why not?

1061
01:45:52,816 --> 01:45:55,446
Somebody has to die.

1062
01:45:58,126 --> 01:45:59,586
Why?

1063
01:46:00,726 --> 01:46:03,756
Somebody always does.

1064
01:46:20,716 --> 01:46:23,176
Morning. 
I'm looking for a Dr. Garner.

1065
01:46:23,216 --> 01:46:26,746
She doesn't work here anymore. 
She's in San Francisco with the police.

1066
01:46:26,786 --> 01:46:28,546
Actually, I'm looking for her husband.

1067
01:46:28,586 --> 01:46:31,746
- He works here too, doesn't he?
- Dr. Joseph Garner?

1068
01:46:31,786 --> 01:46:33,686
- She married?
- You know him?

1069
01:46:33,726 --> 01:46:36,626
He died about five or six years ago.

1070
01:46:36,666 --> 01:46:40,596
- How did he die?
- He was shot.

1071
01:46:42,666 --> 01:46:44,726
Thank you.

1072
01:46:46,506 --> 01:46:48,676
He was walking home from work.

1073
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:51,236
He only lived a couple of blocks 
from the clinic.

1074
01:46:51,276 --> 01:46:52,706
Somebody just drove by and shot him.

1075
01:46:52,776 --> 01:46:56,576
- What was the murder weapon?
- Revolver, .38. Unrecovered.

1076
01:46:56,646 --> 01:46:59,276
- Watch yourself.
- Were there any suspects?

1077
01:46:59,316 --> 01:47:02,716
No suspects, no motive. 
Unsolved.

1078
01:47:02,756 --> 01:47:05,246
Was his wife ever a suspect?

1079
01:47:06,726 --> 01:47:09,756
One of your guys was down here 
from Frisco a year ago.

1080
01:47:10,096 --> 01:47:12,326
He was asking the same, exact thing.

1081
01:47:12,536 --> 01:47:14,296
You mind telling me what's going on?

1082
01:47:14,496 --> 01:47:17,126
Routine.

1083
01:47:17,206 --> 01:47:19,176
That's exactly what he said.

1084
01:47:19,176 --> 01:47:22,176
Now I got two of you guys 
telling me it's "routine."

1085
01:47:22,176 --> 01:47:24,506
You remember what the other guy's name was?

1086
01:47:25,646 --> 01:47:29,706
No. I can't really say that I do.

1087
01:47:29,746 --> 01:47:32,516
Nilsen?

1088
01:47:32,586 --> 01:47:34,516
Yeah. That was it.

1089
01:47:36,786 --> 01:47:39,626
- So was she ever a suspect?
- No.

1090
01:47:40,696 --> 01:47:42,186
There was some talk.

1091
01:47:42,226 --> 01:47:44,256
But it never panned out.

1092
01:47:44,326 --> 01:47:47,296
- What kind of talk?
- Girlfriend.

1093
01:47:47,496 --> 01:47:49,596
He had a girlfriend?

1094
01:47:49,666 --> 01:47:51,136
No.

1095
01:47:52,776 --> 01:47:54,606
She did.

1096
01:47:56,676 --> 01:48:00,136
But like I said, it never panned out.

1097
01:48:02,216 --> 01:48:04,706
- Thank you.
- Hope that helped you out.

1098
01:48:05,086 --> 01:48:09,216
Yes, you did. You sure did.

1099
01:48:39,386 --> 01:48:40,646
I missed you.

1100
01:48:42,826 --> 01:48:44,186
I finished my research.

1101
01:48:44,256 --> 01:48:47,626
- I finished my book.
- So how does it end?

1102
01:48:48,696 --> 01:48:50,666
I told you.

1103
01:48:50,726 --> 01:48:52,666
She kills him.

1104
01:48:55,336 --> 01:48:57,426
Good-bye, Nick.

1105
01:48:59,176 --> 01:49:01,226
Good-bye?

1106
01:49:01,306 --> 01:49:04,206
Yeah. I finished my book.

1107
01:49:06,676 --> 01:49:08,736
Didn't you hear me?

1108
01:49:08,816 --> 01:49:10,646
Your character's dead.

1109
01:49:12,456 --> 01:49:14,076
Good-bye.

1110
01:49:18,356 --> 01:49:20,416
What do you want, flowers?

1111
01:49:20,456 --> 01:49:22,756
I'll send you an autographed copy.

1112
01:49:24,726 --> 01:49:27,326
What is this, some kind of joke?

1113
01:49:32,166 --> 01:49:33,366
You playing a game here?

1114
01:49:34,476 --> 01:49:36,406
The games are over.

1115
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,646
You were right.

1116
01:49:39,716 --> 01:49:44,146
It was the fuck of the century, shooter.

1117
01:49:57,426 --> 01:49:58,826
I'll be right there.

1118
01:50:26,426 --> 01:50:28,396
Catherine Tramell's roommate, 
freshman year? 

1119
01:50:28,426 --> 01:50:32,386
I just got a call from her. 
She's in Oakland. Come on!

1120
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:36,486
I've been phoning people 
from her dorm all day. 

1121
01:50:36,706 --> 01:50:38,326
She must've heard I was trying to reach her.

1122
01:50:38,406 --> 01:50:42,396
Says she knows all about Catherine 
and Lisa Hoberman.

1123
01:50:44,776 --> 01:50:46,336
You feeling okay?

1124
01:50:48,376 --> 01:50:49,846
Here's something else.

1125
01:50:50,186 --> 01:50:53,446
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist 
has an office on Van Ness.

1126
01:50:53,516 --> 01:50:55,386
Guess who he shares space with?

1127
01:50:55,416 --> 01:50:58,256
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1128
01:51:00,826 --> 01:51:04,386
What in the hell's the matter with you?

1129
01:51:17,376 --> 01:51:20,406
I'll be in suite 405.

1130
01:51:22,416 --> 01:51:24,746
- Where the hell you going?
- I'm going with you.

1131
01:51:24,816 --> 01:51:26,756
You're on leave, Hoss.

1132
01:51:26,756 --> 01:51:29,746
It ain't gonna take long.

1133
01:53:52,326 --> 01:53:53,596
Freeze!

1134
01:53:53,666 --> 01:53:55,296
What are you doing here?

1135
01:53:55,366 --> 01:53:57,266
Put your fucking hands up!

1136
01:53:57,336 --> 01:53:59,266
I got a message to meet Gus here.

1137
01:53:59,336 --> 01:54:01,426
- Where is he?
- Don't you move!

1138
01:54:01,506 --> 01:54:04,306
I know about your husband! 
You still like girls, Beth?

1139
01:54:05,346 --> 01:54:08,646
- What?
- Take you hands out of your pocket!

1140
01:54:08,716 --> 01:54:11,306
- Take them out!
- What's wrong with you?

1141
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:12,676
Take them out!

1142
01:54:32,566 --> 01:54:34,536
I loved you.

1143
01:54:50,786 --> 01:54:52,726
Oh, God!

1144
01:55:15,716 --> 01:55:18,446
What made you think she had a gun?

1145
01:55:20,216 --> 01:55:23,706
What was she doing here? 
What was Gus doing here?

1146
01:55:27,396 --> 01:55:29,326
Lieutenant.

1147
01:55:57,326 --> 01:55:58,656
One of ours.

1148
01:56:01,456 --> 01:56:04,156
Jesus.

1149
01:56:04,226 --> 01:56:06,566
We'll have to check Beth's apartment.

1150
01:56:09,636 --> 01:56:11,366
Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

1151
01:56:11,436 --> 01:56:14,236
In the bookcase, behind some books.

1152
01:56:16,576 --> 01:56:19,666
Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.

1153
01:56:19,716 --> 01:56:23,336
Lieutenant. 
You better come in here.

1154
01:56:51,646 --> 01:56:54,446
I guess that's it.

1155
01:57:09,596 --> 01:57:14,256
Definitely not. We feel all the evidence 
points to Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1156
01:57:14,296 --> 01:57:16,286
We checked. It's her size.

1157
01:57:16,366 --> 01:57:18,526
She probably heard you on the stairway 
and dumped this stuff.

1158
01:57:18,566 --> 01:57:20,336
There's no suite 405.

1159
01:57:20,406 --> 01:57:22,336
Catherine Tramell's freshman roommate is dead.

1160
01:57:22,406 --> 01:57:24,346
She died of leukemia two years ago.

1161
01:57:24,406 --> 01:57:27,036
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- What about Salinas?

1162
01:57:27,246 --> 01:57:30,076
Yeah, hold on. Jack!

1163
01:57:31,616 --> 01:57:33,676
Did you check Nilsen's office 
for any files on Beth Garner?

1164
01:57:33,756 --> 01:57:37,616
No police report from Berkeley. 
Nothing at all about Salinas.

1165
01:57:37,656 --> 01:57:38,786
I'm back.

1166
01:57:40,526 --> 01:57:41,786
Great.

1167
01:57:42,456 --> 01:57:45,656
Ballistics says the .38 we found 
in her apartment was used on Nilsen.

1168
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:48,256
No registration. 
They're checking with Salinas.

1169
01:57:48,296 --> 01:57:51,096
The ice pick was the same brand and model 
as the Boz weapon.

1170
01:57:51,306 --> 01:57:53,536
Checked the tape machines 
at Dr. Garner's apartment and office...

1171
01:57:53,606 --> 01:57:55,266
both here and the one on Van Ness.

1172
01:57:55,306 --> 01:57:56,636
There's no message from Gus on any of them.

1173
01:57:56,676 --> 01:57:58,646
The tape in her apartment was unused.

1174
01:57:58,706 --> 01:58:01,476
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist 
says he thinks he remembers...

1175
01:58:01,546 --> 01:58:04,636
Dr. Garner and Boz meeting 
at a Christmas party at his house.

1176
01:58:04,716 --> 01:58:06,686
A year ago.

1177
01:58:09,586 --> 01:58:12,616
You just can't tell about people, can you?

1178
01:58:14,396 --> 01:58:18,696
Even the ones 
you think you know inside and out.

1179
01:58:21,736 --> 01:58:24,496
Congratulations, Curran.

1180
01:59:24,196 --> 01:59:26,096
I heard about what happened.

1181
01:59:28,396 --> 01:59:31,366
On TV.

1182
01:59:42,376 --> 01:59:46,176
I can't allow myself to care about you.

1183
01:59:49,216 --> 01:59:52,156
I can't allow myself...

1184
01:59:52,186 --> 01:59:54,716
to care.

1185
01:59:57,766 --> 02:00:00,166
I don't want to do this.

1186
02:00:00,236 --> 02:00:03,096
Please. 
I don't want to do this.

1187
02:00:04,566 --> 02:00:07,406
I lose everybody.

1188
02:00:07,476 --> 02:00:10,406
I don't want to lose you.

1189
02:01:55,776 --> 02:01:57,746
What do we do now?

1190
02:01:59,516 --> 02:02:02,816
Fuck like minks...

1191
02:02:03,156 --> 02:02:06,556
raise rug rats and live happily ever after.

1192
02:02:17,606 --> 02:02:19,156
I hate rug rats.

1193
02:02:22,176 --> 02:02:25,146
Fuck like minks, forget the rug rats...

1194
02:02:25,206 --> 02:02:28,176
and live happily ever after.
