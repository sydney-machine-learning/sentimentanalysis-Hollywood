1
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,041
<i>This is the world. There are
almost six billion people on it.</i>

2
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:51,671
<i>When I was a kid there were three.
It's hard to keep up.</i>

3
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,218
<i>There, that's better. That's America.</i>

4
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:59,763
<i>America still sets
the tone for the world.</i>

5
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,811
<i>In Indiana, Clark Hodd.
The country's best point guard.</i>

6
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:10,399
<i>Last week he scored 100 points
in a single game.</i>

7
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:14,779
<i>Erica Sorgi.
You'll see her in the next Olympics.</i>

8
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:18,742
<i>In Seattle, Dallas Malloy, 16.</i>

9
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:22,120
<i>Her lawsuit paved the way
for women boxers.</i>

10
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:25,457
<i>She's picturing her ex-boyfriend.</i>

11
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,169
<i>In Indio, California. Art Stallings.</i>

12
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,963
<i>Check out what pure joy looks like.</i>

13
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:36,093
<i>In Odessa, Texas.
The great Frank Cushman.</i>

14
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:41,891
<i>This April, 26 teams will be falling
over themselves to sign him.</i>

15
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:44,602
<i>He's my most important client.</i>

16
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,730
When are you gonna try
and concentrate?!

17
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,985
<i>There's genius everywhere.
It's like popcorn. Some pop...</i>

18
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:56,239
Coach, you don't know
diddly about golf!

19
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:57,783
<i>... some don't.</i>

20
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,120
<i>I'm the guy you don't usually see.</i>

21
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,666
<i>I'm behind the scenes.
I'm the sports agent.</i>

22
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,627
I'm gonna hurt you this year.

23
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:13,215
My door's always open if you
want to get a real agent.

24
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,218
You're welcome, Johnny.

25
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:19,764
I'll go to a meeting now to talk
about you. I'd kill for you.

26
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:22,684
- We've gotta win.
- I hail you.

27
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,936
Jerry, how are you doing?

28
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,774
- How much is this going to cost?
- We both know what you can afford.

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,318
I'll just write it down.

30
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:37,991
- I can't afford that.
- Winning isn't cheap.

31
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,579
<i>You know the photos of
the new player with the owner?</i>

32
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,665
<i>That's me on the left.</i>

33
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,753
<i>This is where I work. SMI.
Sports Management International.</i>

34
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,134
<i>Thirty-three agents
guiding the careers...</i>

35
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:59,180
<i>... of 1685 of the most
finely tuned athletes alive.</i>

36
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,767
<i>I handle the lives and dreams...</i>

37
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:06,813
<i>... of 72 clients and get
264 phone calls a day.</i>

38
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:10,316
I will not rest until
you hold a Coke...

39
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,528
...in a new commercial
starring you...

40
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:17,533
...broadcast during a Super Bowl
game you're winning.

41
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:20,119
<i>It's what I do best.</i>

42
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:24,206
<i>I noticed a few years ago,
and didn't say a word.</i>

43
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:26,751
Was the girl 16 or 17?

44
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:29,920
<i>Wanting the big dollar,
things went wrong.</i>

45
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:35,510
There's no proof of anything.
This guy is a sensational athlete.

46
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:39,139
Are you Calvin Nack?
Can you sign my card?

47
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:44,519
I'm sorry, fella, I can't sign this.

48
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,733
- Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
- Just wanted an autograph.

49
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,861
<i>Lately, it's gotten worse.</i>

50
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,616
<i>Oh, he goes down!</i>

51
00:03:58,785 --> 00:03:59,869
Hi, baby.

52
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:03,081
Do you know your name?

53
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:14,968
Wait, it's coming.
My name is Steve Remo.

54
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:18,972
I play for Chicago.
This lady here is my wife.

55
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,225
Hi, baby.

56
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:24,978
This is my boy. And this is...

57
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:28,315
Wait.

58
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:31,568
My agent. My agent.

59
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:35,824
I gotta play this weekend.
If I play at 65 percent...

60
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:39,577
...I get a bonus.
I gotta get the bonus.

61
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:44,999
- Okay, Jesse. Take care, little guy.
- Mr. Maguire?

62
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,754
This is his fourth concussion.
Shouldn't he stop?

63
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:53,133
It would take a tank
to stop your dad.

64
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:55,386
It would take all five...

65
00:04:55,594 --> 00:05:00,474
...Super Trooper VR Warriors
to stop your dad.

66
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:01,892
Right?

67
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,229
Right?

68
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:08,566
Fuck you!

69
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:15,031
<i>Who had I become?
Just another shark in a suit?</i>

70
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:38,097
<i>- Skyrocketing salaries, and you
are one of the guys responsible.</i>

71
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:41,309
<i>He's a sensational athlete.</i>

72
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:46,481
<i>Two days later, at our Miami
conference, a breakthrough.</i>

73
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,649
<i>I have $18 million...</i>

74
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,778
<i>Breakdown? Breakthrough.</i>

75
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:55,656
<i>- I just wanted an autograph.
- Do you know your name?</i>

76
00:05:57,242 --> 00:06:00,913
<i>I couldn't escape one simple thought:</i>

77
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:04,666
<i>I hated myself.</i>

78
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,920
<i>No, here's what it was:</i>

79
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:12,174
<i>I hated my place in the world.</i>

80
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:21,309
<i>I had so much to say,
no one to listen.</i>

81
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,313
<i>And then it happened.</i>

82
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:33,071
<i>It was the oddest,
most unexpected thing.</i>

83
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:38,077
<i>I began writing what they call
a mission statement, not a memo.</i>

84
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:41,789
<i>A suggestion
for the future of our company.</i>

85
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:47,837
<i>A night like this doesn't
come along often. I seized it.</i>

86
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:53,592
<i>What started out as one page
became 25.</i>

87
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:57,014
<i>Suddenly, I was
my father's son again.</i>

88
00:06:57,222 --> 00:07:01,393
<i>I was remembering
the simple pleasures of this job.</i>

89
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:05,897
<i>The way a stadium sounds
when my player performs well.</i>

90
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:10,610
<i>The way we're meant to protect them,
in health and in injury.</i>

91
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:14,990
<i>With so many clients,
we had forgotten what was important.</i>

92
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,288
<i>I wrote and wrote and wrote.
And I'm not even a writer.</i>

93
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:25,418
<i>I was remembering my mentor's words,
Dicky Fox, who said:</i>

94
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:29,714
The key to this business
is personal relationships.

95
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:35,428
<i>Suddenly, it was all pretty clear.
The answer was fewer clients.</i>

96
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,973
<i>Less money. More attention.</i>

97
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:41,268
<i>Caring for them,
caring for ourselves.</i>

98
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:44,146
<i>Just starting our lives really!</i>

99
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:49,401
<i>I'll be the first to admit,
what I was writing was touchy-feely.</i>

100
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:53,030
<i>I didn't care.
I've lost the ability to bullshit.</i>

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,077
<i>It was the me I'd always
wanted to be.</i>

102
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:03,458
<i>I took it to a Copymat
and printed up 110 copies.</i>

103
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,128
<i>The cover looked like
Catcher in the Rye.</i>

104
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,092
<i>I entitled it,
The Things We Think and Do Not Say:</i>

105
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,594
The Future of Our Business.

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,349
That's how you become great, man.

107
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,352
Hang your balls out there.

108
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:23,979
Thanks.

109
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:29,860
<i>- Everybody got one.
- Some animals walk on two feet.</i>

110
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,154
<i>They don't want peace.</i>

111
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:37,577
<i>Society needs protection
from these warped minds.</i>

112
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,344
<i>Boom!</i>

113
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:59,684
This is Jerry Maguire.
Did those manuscripts...?

114
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:02,186
<i>- They've all gone out.
- They did?</i>

115
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:05,314
No, that's fine.

116
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,150
Thank you.

117
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:37,807
Finally, somebody said it.

118
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:43,229
- Good work, Maguire.
- Yeah, yeah!

119
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:02,416
<i>I was 35.</i>

120
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,252
<i>I'd started my life.</i>

121
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:09,298
- How long do you give him?
- About a week.

122
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:22,854
- You're with the sports people?
- Jerry Maguire, SMI.

123
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:27,150
Bobbi Fallon, BPI.
I'm producing the Coke commercials.

124
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,319
Well, good luck with that.

125
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,701
Hi, my son is allergic
to the blankets. I was wondering...

126
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:38,496
That's all we have, okay?

127
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:48,089
- I'm sorry if I was rude just now.
- That's okay. We're in it together now.

128
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,301
Why is it so easy to talk with you?
Tell me about your fiancée.

129
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,888
- We're not at your pitch yet.
- Tell me how you proposed.

130
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:59,351
Honey, are you all right?
Do you want some juice?

131
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:05,566
Thank you.
We're hiking up through the pools.

132
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:09,987
Got the ring in my pocket.
I'm a little nervous.

133
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:13,115
I'm lagging. She says to me...

134
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:16,493
...get this:
"Hurry up, klutz."

135
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:21,458
It bothered me somewhat.
I got quiet. Then she got quiet.

136
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:26,337
I decide I'm not gonna propose.
The mood is not right.

137
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:32,093
At this point I know she knows
that I was gonna propose.

138
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:33,386
She knows I know.

139
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:36,389
- So we check back into the hotel.
- How sad.

140
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:42,355
Little do I know that my assistant
assumed that I've now proposed.

141
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:47,318
She's got a band to play " Here Comes
The Bride" when we walk in.

142
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:51,072
- I love it.
- All the football guys are watching.

143
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,908
There's even an ESPN crew.

144
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:57,578
So I turn to her, sort of grandly say:

145
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:00,582
"This is me, klutz, asking you...

146
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,503
...goddess of rock climbing,
to marry me."

147
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:10,133
I took out the ring. I mean,
I don't much like big scenes...

148
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,595
...but she said yes right there.

149
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:16,807
Some of the toughest men
in football wept.

150
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,773
- We're getting married in February.
- You'll be married forever.

151
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:34,951
- What's wrong, Mom?
- First class is what's wrong, honey.

152
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:39,038
It used to be a better meal,
now it's a better life.

153
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:46,755
Ray?

154
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:49,883
Ray?!

155
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:52,219
Come on, buddy!

156
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,555
- High five!
- Ray!

157
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,767
- Oh, God. Ray!
- Excuse me, can I help you?

158
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,563
Jerry Maguire.

159
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:05,316
I work in your office.
I was on a junket.

160
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,153
I know, Dorothy Boyd in Accounts.

161
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:13,491
You have this poster of Einstein's
face on Shaquille O'Neal's body.

162
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,745
That's pretty good.

163
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,584
- What did you lose?
- My son, my mind.

164
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,172
Ray! Ray!

165
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:29,008
Listen, Dorothy. Dorothy?

166
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:32,678
While I go look for him,
grab this gentleman here.

167
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,066
You scared me. You scared me!

168
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:47,694
- Don't do that again, ever!
- Okay, Mommy.

169
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,697
Ever, ever, ever! Okay? Ever!

170
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:52,282
Dorothy?

171
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,994
- Take care.
- Thank you so much.

172
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,626
I loved your memo, by the way.

173
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,838
- You did?
- Yeah.

174
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:13,304
Thanks. Actually, it was
just a mission statement.

175
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:16,891
In this age,
optimism is a revolutionary act.

176
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,310
- You think so?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,565
I appreciate that.
I didn't know if I should write it.

178
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:29,196
It was 2:00 in the morning.
Some of the stuff I just, you know...

179
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:34,243
No. That part about
embracing what is virginal...

180
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,078
Just a second.

181
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:41,710
...and force commerce to give
a little back for the greater good.

182
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:46,840
God, I was inspired,
and I'm an accountant, you know?

183
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:51,594
I mean, to respect yourself
enough to say it out loud.

184
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:56,224
To put yourself out there
like that, so nakedly.

185
00:14:57,517 --> 00:15:00,437
I don't know. It got me.

186
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:07,153
Is this bothering you?

187
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:10,865
No, this is great.

188
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:13,826
- It's great.
- One, two, three!

189
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,704
Do you need a ride? You okay?

190
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,372
- What?
- Need a lift?

191
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,795
Oh, no! Yeah, I'm sure
that would just make your day.

192
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:27,966
To drive us out to Manhattan Beach.
Little tiny streets.

193
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:32,637
Playing chicken with traffic.
Your life flashing before you.

194
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:37,392
- I've obviously had too much coffee.
- No problem.

195
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:42,565
Oh, there's my sister, Laurel,
to pick us up.

196
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,403
Ray...

197
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,030
...Dorothy.

198
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:51,115
Pleasure.

199
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,618
Bye.

200
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,713
Hey, Ray, hey you.
I'm double-parked, let's go.

201
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,800
Sorry, honey. Is this everything?

202
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,262
- Come here.
- Dorothy?

203
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,684
Man, whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

204
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:24,401
Don't ever stop fucking me!

205
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,071
Sooner or later we'll have to stop!

206
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,867
Never been better! Never better!

207
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,662
Never better!

208
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,792
Open your eyes.

209
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:46,424
If you want me to be with another
woman for you, I would do it.

210
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:50,553
I'm not interested in it.
At a time it felt normal.

211
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,931
But it was a phase. A college thing.

212
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,643
Like torn Levi's
or law school for you.

213
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,937
Want anything from the kitchen?

214
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,782
You don't have to tell me everything.

215
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:13,118
This is what intimacy is.

216
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:16,621
We have dinner
with Wade Cooksy tomorrow.

217
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,915
I know about the party.

218
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:22,378
Your buddy worked
his ass off for this.

219
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:26,007
All the guys from the office
are coming.

220
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:31,679
Calm down, relax, act surprised,
and have an amazing time.

221
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,194
- Oh, my God. You! You!
- Sorry.

222
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:47,237
Jerry!

223
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:49,782
Got you!

224
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:58,499
- Hey, college buddy. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

225
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,335
- For you.
- Thank you.

226
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:06,925
And this is for you.
Finest cigar my club has to offer.

227
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,094
This is what it's all about, man.

228
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:12,347
Everybody loves you.

229
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,476
Pisses me off!

230
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:20,897
<i>Whether you're country,
redneck or a freak...</i>

231
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:25,277
<i>... young or old, from Moscow,
London or Memphis...</i>

232
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:29,615
<i>... Jerry Maguire will still
be the king of rock 'n' roll.</i>

233
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:36,122
<i>- Little black book.
- When I think of him, my heart pounds.</i>

234
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:40,501
<i>- I know Jerry pretty well.
- Hi, Jerry, remember me?</i>

235
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,503
We still on for lunch?

236
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:44,715
<i>He was no slouch in bed.</i>

237
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,176
This is the funniest thing.
See you later.

238
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,806
<i>- Good idea that Jerry get married.
He won't be alone.</i>

239
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:55,434
<i>- He cannot be alone.
- He can't be alone.</i>

240
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:56,893
<i>He's almost phobic.</i>

241
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:01,648
<i>Jerry is great at friendship,
he's just bad at intimacy.</i>

242
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,986
<i>- He can't be alone.
- He can't be alone.</i>

243
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:10,324
<i>- He can't say, "I love you."
- He's an agent. He lies.</i>

244
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,995
<i>- I love you too.
- Hey, love you too.</i>

245
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,748
<i>- Love you too.
- Love you.</i>

246
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,124
I love you, man.

247
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,048
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

248
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:41,607
- Morning, Jenny.
- Sorry I missed the party.

249
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:44,402
Good morning, Jerry. Marcee's here.

250
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:47,572
She's late for her plane to Phoenix.

251
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,867
- Marcee.
- You finally made it.

252
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:53,286
Rod is very, very upset.

253
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:56,081
- Tyson, no!
- Okay, Mommy.

254
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:59,542
- Tyson, hello.
- Long time no see!

255
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:02,253
- Tyson!
- How can I help?

256
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:06,592
Jerry, I'm pregnant,
and I'm incapable of bullshit.

257
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,469
Where is our offer?

258
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:12,014
- Cronin's for lunch?
- This is Bob Sugar.

259
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:13,766
- Knock.
- Pleasure.

260
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:17,812
- You've called our house.
- Sorry to interrupt.

261
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:23,819
I don't know what you do,
but my husband has an image.

262
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:29,074
Putting him in a waterbed commercial?
You're making him common.

263
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:34,037
He deserves the big four:
Shoe, car, clothing, soft drink.

264
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:36,915
I know about the four
endorsement jewels.

265
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,627
- Wow.
- He and I majored in marketing.

266
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:42,003
We came to play!

267
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:46,050
The dirty man is back!

268
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:51,222
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

269
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,227
You okay?

270
00:20:58,146 --> 00:21:02,483
- Fine. What's up?
- Came here to let you go.

271
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:07,156
- Pardon me?
- Came here to fire you, Jerry.

272
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:14,913
It's real.
You should say something.

273
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,591
Shit.

274
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:30,138
A crowded restaurant
so there won't be a scene.

275
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:45,071
- You ungrateful...
- You need to see yourself.

276
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:48,824
You said fewer clients,
you put it on paper.

277
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:52,703
You know what I went through?
Fire my mentor?

278
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:57,041
Carrying that for a week?
Could you get past yourself?

279
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,669
- You'll lose.
- You want smaller.

280
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,298
Now I want all my clients
and yours too.

281
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,885
Whatever.

282
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:27,573
Wendy, bring me my numbers.

283
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:44,716
<i>- Cush.
- Cush, it's Sugar.</i>

284
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:51,140
<i>Look, you're the most important guy
in sports. How does that feel?</i>

285
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:55,394
I just wanna play football.
Dad, one of the agents.

286
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:59,648
Wendy, Cushman's line is busy!
Call till you get through.

287
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:01,734
And bring me my numbers!

288
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:05,739
J.J., what's up?
Have you talked to Maguire?

289
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:09,951
He had a meltdown.
I've talked to Doritos about you.

290
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:12,620
They're interested. Talk to Rick.

291
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,497
Martinez...

292
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:18,585
Carlo, right now you
pay 25 percent to SMI.

293
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:21,296
I'd cut my commission by 7 percent.

294
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:25,176
I don't know if it was drugs,
but the guy freaked.

295
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:29,430
Do you want him representing you?
How's your mom?

296
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:32,641
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

297
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:35,770
Just what does your heart tell you?

298
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:39,398
Sorry to hear that.

299
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:49,367
- Hey, what's going on?
- They've fired Jerry Maguire.

300
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:53,497
SMI, this is Cleo. Hey!

301
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:00,295
You're making a mistake.

302
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:05,300
I'm concerned about your family
and your future.

303
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,846
I have a long relationship with SMI.

304
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,724
Does he know what it's like
to be black?

305
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,394
Bob Sugar? He's...

306
00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:17,063
He's entertaining, funny.

307
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:21,234
I don't know what it's like
to be black? I'm Mr. Black People!

308
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:23,945
Don't make it harder than it is.

309
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:28,575
I've got to be honest,
this is very distressing for me.

310
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:32,746
Remember that stripper's name?
I do, it was April.

311
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:38,377
That's my job. It's not about
the money, I do it all for you.

312
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:42,965
- Still holding for Katarina.
- I'm talking about money.

313
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:45,676
It's been a great day.

314
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:49,013
Are you in or out? It's show business.

315
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,100
You are in.

316
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,522
- That's good.
- I wanna cry for what they did to you.

317
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:02,902
<i>If it wasn't for the Acura deal,
you know I'd go with you.</i>

318
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:07,742
Oh, Jerry. Oh, God!

319
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:13,581
Call waiting.
Who could be calling me now?

320
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,167
- Hi, Kathy Sanders.
- Still me.

321
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:25,634
Kathy, why are you crying?
Oh. So you're in?

322
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:28,805
Rod, Jerry Maguire. How are you doing?

323
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:32,976
Jerry Maguire! How am I doing?

324
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:36,646
I'll tell you.
I'm sweating my contract.

325
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:40,692
Bob Sugar says
I'm missing out by being with you.

326
00:25:40,942 --> 00:25:45,113
<i>- That's how I'm doing.
- That's why I'm calling.</i>

327
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:49,452
No, I hear that.
But do you truly hear what I'm saying?

328
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,665
- I heard you say it, Daddy.
- The best thing is getting together.

329
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:59,295
<i>- Would you mind holding?
- Didn't you say more attention?</i>

330
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:05,593
- Didn't you tell my wife that?
- I said more personal attention.

331
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:11,100
<i>Good! We're just getting started
on the things you need to know.</i>

332
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:14,061
I will kill for you.
I will maim for you.

333
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:17,398
I am a valuable commodity!

334
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:23,070
I see a dude out to kill me,
I tell myself, "Catch the ball."

335
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,156
Touchdown! I make miracles happen.

336
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:28,201
Are you in or out?

337
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,996
<i>I'm from Arizona.
I broke Arizona records.</i>

338
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:35,458
I went to Arizona State!
I'm a Sun Devil!

339
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:39,003
- And now you want Arizona dollars.
- Exactly.

340
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:43,883
Jerry, I'm sitting here
with an ant problem. I got ants.

341
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:46,594
My brother's room is flooded.

342
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:49,932
<i>- Rod.
- We got a flood in his room.</i>

343
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:51,725
Say hello to Maguire.

344
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:54,562
- Hello, brother Maguire.
- Hello, Tee Pee.

345
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,192
My house is falling apart!
Nobody's looking out for Rod Tidwell.

346
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:03,946
And I'm supposed to be a superstar.

347
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,449
I need a decision. In or out?

348
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:10,370
You're gonna be so happy
you stayed with Bob Sugar!

349
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,584
<i>I am a role model.
I have a family to support! Hear me?</i>

350
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,503
I want my contract in Arizona!

351
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:21,631
<i>But I like you. Yes, I like you.</i>

352
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:25,802
My wife likes you.
You're good to my wife.

353
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,140
- I will stay with you.
- That's great.

354
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,641
<i>- Are you listening?
- Yes.</i>

355
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,936
<i>That's what I'm gonna do for you.
God bless.</i>

356
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:37,732
<i>This is what you'll do for me...
Are you listening?</i>

357
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:41,903
What can I do for you?
Just tell me, what can I do?

358
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:46,074
It's a very personal,
very important thing.

359
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:48,035
It's a family motto.

360
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:49,620
<i>- You ready?
- Ready.</i>

361
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,914
<i>Making sure you are, brother.</i>

362
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:54,166
Here it is:

363
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,711
Show me the money.

364
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,215
Show...

365
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:05,344
<i>... me the...</i>

366
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:07,346
...money!

367
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,433
Doesn't that make you feel good?

368
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:14,395
<i>- Say it with me, Jerry.
- Show you the money.</i>

369
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:17,816
You can do better than that! Say it!

370
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:22,153
<i>- Bob Sugar's on the other line.
- Show you the money.</i>

371
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:26,825
<i>- No, not you, show me the money.
- Show me the money.</i>

372
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:29,078
- Louder!
- Show me the money.

373
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:32,123
<i>- You got to yell!
- Show me the money!</i>

374
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:36,001
<i>- I need to feel you.
- Show me the money!</i>

375
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,838
Show me the money!

376
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,716
Show me the money!

377
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:46,178
- You love this black man.
- I love the black man!

378
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:49,516
- Show me the money!
- I love black people!

379
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,393
I love black people!

380
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:55,355
- Who's your motherfucker?
- You're my motherfucker!

381
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:59,860
- What you gonna do, Jerry?
- Show me the money!

382
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:02,863
Congratulations,
you're still my agent.

383
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:36,899
Well, don't worry.

384
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:41,278
I won't do what you think I will...

385
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:43,572
...which is just flip out!

386
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:51,706
Let me just say...

387
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,377
...as I ease out
of the office I helped build.

388
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,339
I'm sorry, but it's a fact...

389
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,802
...that there's such a thing
as manners.

390
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,764
A way of treating people.

391
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,478
These fish have manners.

392
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,356
These fish have manners.

393
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,485
In fact, I'm starting a new company...

394
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,696
...and the fish will come with me.

395
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:25,908
Call me sentimental...

396
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:29,121
...but the fish are coming with me.

397
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,090
Okay.

398
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:47,389
If anybody else
wants to come with me...

399
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,768
...this will be a moment
of something...

400
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,188
...real and fun and inspiring...

401
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:57,191
...in this godforsaken business...

402
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,944
...and we will do it together.

403
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,490
Who's coming with me?

404
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,367
Who's coming with me?

405
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:09,496
Who's coming with me?!

406
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:17,254
Who's coming with me
besides Flipper here?

407
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:25,888
This is embarrassing.

408
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:32,645
All right.

409
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,690
Wendy.

410
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:38,818
- Shall we?
- Oh, Jerry...

411
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:42,405
...I'm three months away
from the pay increase.

412
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:48,495
Okay.

413
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,998
Okay.

414
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:01,300
I will go with you.

415
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:04,762
Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

416
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:13,730
Right now?

417
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:17,901
Don't do it.

418
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:25,826
Bye.

419
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:38,965
We'll see you all again.
Sleep tight.

420
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:43,761
Let's see how they do without us.

421
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:58,986
Thank you.

422
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:03,031
You will have
a medical program, right?

423
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,659
Sure, yes, medical.

424
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:08,579
I don't know.

425
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:13,710
When you think about
what you did, don't panic.

426
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,171
We're gonna be great.

427
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:20,049
We're gonna be great!

428
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:55,295
I wonder what he said.

429
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,340
My favourite aunt is hearing-impaired.

430
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,927
He just said, "You complete me."

431
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:27,745
That's a good point.
We come to support each other...

432
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:30,790
...but we don't listen to one another.

433
00:34:30,998 --> 00:34:35,546
Women are taught not to
see each other as good people.

434
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:39,925
We see each other as enemies.
We compete over men, jobs...

435
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:45,264
- It's true, we compete.
- I used to really hate women.

436
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:49,643
And then I met you guys,
and you're like me.

437
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:53,565
It's important because
I know you can be my friends.

438
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,026
- What about medical?
- Of course.

439
00:34:57,277 --> 00:34:59,737
A single mother can't be frivolous.

440
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:05,326
If you read what he wrote, you'd have
left too. And there are other jobs.

441
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:09,539
- Do you know the cost of child exams?
- Yes, $150.

442
00:35:09,748 --> 00:35:11,584
And that's when he's well.

443
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:15,504
- Where is Ray?
- Asleep in the living room.

444
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,757
Next time you lecture me...

445
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:22,428
...don't leave my boy alone
with that divorced women's group.

446
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:26,849
So I finally, finally
got in touch with my anger.

447
00:35:36,026 --> 00:35:38,320
What did I do?

448
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:43,325
Function, function.
Forward motion is everything.

449
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:46,036
Cush saves all.

450
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:50,707
You go to Texas. Keep one superstar,
and they'll all follow.

451
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:52,585
There's no loyalty.

452
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:56,130
The first person
who told me that was you.

453
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:00,051
- I was trying to sleep with you.
- Well, it worked.

454
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:05,473
And I will not let you fail.
You are Jerry Ma-fucking-guire!

455
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:08,476
- That's right.
- King of the house calls!

456
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:11,604
- Master of the living room.
- Okay, okay.

457
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:16,318
- Okay, this is working.
- You are not a loser.

458
00:36:18,278 --> 00:36:23,575
- Who said anything about "loser"?
- Mistake. Wrong word! Let's leave.

459
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:55,484
I'm in the back den, Jerry.

460
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:59,697
- Would you like a bloody beer?
- I'm fine.

461
00:36:59,947 --> 00:37:02,158
Beer and tomato juice.

462
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:04,243
I'm fine.

463
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:07,288
We've spent a lot
of time together, Matt.

464
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:10,082
You know I care about you
and your son.

465
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:14,337
You know I'm a straight shooter.
If you stay with SMI...

466
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:17,466
We decided to stay with you.

467
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:26,600
I'm not really a hugger.

468
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,311
I can't let go.

469
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,609
I told myself, " If he shows up,
we stick with him."

470
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:39,697
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Cush.

471
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:41,699
How are you?

472
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:44,660
- You remember Keith?
- Yeah.

473
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:49,415
I want him to go number one
in the draft, and I want him to play.

474
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:53,212
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.
He'll go first.

475
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,672
I'll either surf or ski.

476
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:59,510
- Denver's where he should be.
- I'll give it everything.

477
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:04,640
You know I don't do contracts,
but what you do have is my word.

478
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:08,894
And it's stronger than oak.

479
00:38:59,614 --> 00:39:02,701
- Hello.
- Dorothy? Jerry Maguire.

480
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:07,372
- Is Avery there?
- She had an NFL meeting in Atlanta.

481
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:12,961
- Jerry.
- Hello? Hello?

482
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:16,966
Sorry, that was my son and the nanny.

483
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:21,929
<i>- They're in our office?
- Nanny? I prefer child technician.</i>

484
00:39:22,138 --> 00:39:26,893
I had the calls transferred
to my house so I could work here.

485
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:29,604
<i>That's fine. Dorothy, we are back.</i>

486
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:32,982
We are so very, very back.

487
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:35,319
I re-signed Cush. We're set.

488
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:38,989
- I am so happy for you.
- Happy for us.

489
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:42,493
Happy for us. Okay, happy for us.

490
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:45,370
Rod, being at the draft is good.

491
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:49,875
No, Rod, just get on the plane
and meet us at the gate.

492
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,753
<i>- Good. See you there.
- God bless.</i>

493
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:56,424
Avery will meet you
at the B-gate at 4: 15.

494
00:39:56,674 --> 00:40:00,595
Do you know the human head
weighs eight pounds?

495
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:07,143
Did you know Troy Aikman, in six
years, has passed for 16,303 yards?

496
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:13,108
- Bees and dogs can smell fear.
- I booked Tidwell at the Marriott.

497
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:15,736
- Does he smoke?
- I don't know.

498
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:21,325
Did you know Pete Rose has 4256 hits
and he's not in the Hall of Fame?

499
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:25,830
Do you know that my neighbour
has three rabbits?

500
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:29,708
I can't compete with that.

501
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,339
- So did we go over everything? Yes?
- Yep.

502
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:38,009
- Back on Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

503
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:43,181
Ray, have fun at school. Wish me luck.

504
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,517
Luck!

505
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:08,040
- Hey, Rod.
- Hey, Jerry...

506
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,628
Cush, how are you, man?

507
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,674
Jerry, we should be selling these.

508
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:19,428
This is my agent,
you might want his autograph.

509
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,346
My hand's getting tired.

510
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:24,433
- Excuse me.
- What's happening?

511
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:26,435
Are you Hootie?

512
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:30,689
No, I am not Hootie.

513
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:39,115
What it's gonna be,
San Diego or Denver?

514
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:41,242
I'll surf or ski.

515
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:47,665
He'll either surf or ski.

516
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,053
Rod, at last I find you.

517
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:03,307
Why am I here? It's like I'm
five years late for the prom.

518
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:08,729
- Nobody gives a damn about me.
- Let's walk through this lobby.

519
00:42:08,938 --> 00:42:14,360
I want all the media and player reps
to see you for what you are:

520
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:17,614
The best-kept secret in the NFL.

521
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:23,787
The most commanding wide receiver.
You're fast, fierce, charismatic.

522
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:26,832
You're the man.
You are the man! Ready?

523
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,916
Let's go.

524
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,793
Let's walk.

525
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:34,005
The fiercest. You are the man.

526
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:38,636
- Let's do it.
- Hi, Mel. Hi, Tom.

527
00:42:38,886 --> 00:42:40,054
Where's Cush?

528
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:44,308
Good thing you held onto Cushman.
San Diego or Denver?

529
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,981
I want you to meet Rod Tidwell,
110 catches, 1550 yards last year.

530
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:13,547
Now I wanna talk about Rod Tidwell.
A fierce receiver.

531
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:27,771
I came all that way
just to walk the lobby.

532
00:43:28,354 --> 00:43:30,106
It might have even worked.

533
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:34,027
Yeah? Let's do that shit again.

534
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,534
Shooting a Reebok ad down there.
Where are my endorsements?

535
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:45,122
I didn't get no love from Chevy,
no love from Pepsi.

536
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,918
I didn't get no love from
that Energizer Bunny or Nike.

537
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,879
Obviously, I didn't get
love from Reebok.

538
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:56,468
- Did I tell you my Reebok story?
- I gotta get back to Cush.

539
00:43:56,718 --> 00:44:01,973
Oh, your golden paycheck.
But wait, I'll boil it down for you.

540
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:03,892
Fuck Reebok!

541
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,978
All they do is ignore me.
Always have.

542
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:09,064
Always have.

543
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:14,277
You know what was great down there?
You unloaded that large chip...

544
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,154
...on your shoulder.

545
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,866
And you let people in.

546
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:22,328
You were brilliant.

547
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:24,831
- Brilliant?
- Brilliant.

548
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:28,584
- Really?
- Take care, I'll see you tomorrow.

549
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:32,713
- You love me now?
- I'm about showing you the money!

550
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:36,927
I was just testing you,
but to hear you say that...

551
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:40,514
...makes me love you, baby.
You know?

552
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,850
Jerry, come back!

553
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,105
- How was your flight?
- Good.

554
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:50,399
- What size are you?
- 12 and a half.

555
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,278
Grab a couple pairs
of them new shoes by the door.

556
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:05,582
Cush, Matt, we have
a decision to make.

557
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:11,546
San Diego just came in with
a last-minute scenario. It's big.

558
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,715
He's got to go number one.

559
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:18,721
San Diego wants to trade up
with Denver. They want him bad.

560
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:23,309
- What about Denver?
- This stuff happens before a draft.

561
00:45:23,517 --> 00:45:24,977
San Diego, Matt...

562
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:29,857
...they're offering seven years
for 30. Signing bonus of 8.

563
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:33,736
- Should I unplug the phone?
- Reporters keep calling.

564
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:37,365
You just be friendly
and say, "No comment."

565
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:41,369
I'm no good at talking
and saying nothing.

566
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,332
Well, let me...

567
00:45:45,582 --> 00:45:49,628
For you, it's a pleasure.
This is Cush.

568
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:54,800
<i>It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?
Sniff if he is.</i>

569
00:45:55,008 --> 00:45:58,554
Remember, you're in
with the big boys now.

570
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:02,809
<i>Let your dad talk,
and know that I got you the deal.</i>

571
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:06,562
<i>This is business, not friendship.
Be strong...</i>

572
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:09,148
<i>... because you're global now.</i>

573
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:13,277
Okay, buddy? See you later.

574
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,243
No comment.

575
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:29,044
- He's got it wrong.
- You're on TV again.

576
00:46:29,294 --> 00:46:32,005
I'm sick of me, already.

577
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:48,648
Before I go back to Denver,
we should put something on paper.

578
00:46:48,898 --> 00:46:51,442
Something that says you're with me.

579
00:46:51,693 --> 00:46:54,112
Not right now, Jerry.

580
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:03,998
Do I know everything
there is to know here, Matt?

581
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,713
You're not talking
with Bob Sugar, are you?

582
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:15,092
Apparently, Denver would only
deal with him.

583
00:47:15,926 --> 00:47:18,805
Said who? Sugar?

584
00:47:19,764 --> 00:47:21,224
I'm learning as I go.

585
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:26,980
So you empowered him
to deal with Denver behind my back?

586
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:29,316
I'm sorry...

587
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:34,154
- I love my son.
- I love your son!

588
00:47:34,863 --> 00:47:39,410
I brought Denver to 20 million.
They always deal with me.

589
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,831
You listened to Sugar.
Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child.

590
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,752
You let that snake in the door?

591
00:47:50,463 --> 00:47:55,843
Listen, rookie mistake.
I'll fix this Denver thing for you.

592
00:47:56,093 --> 00:47:59,139
You didn't sign anything
with Sugar, right?

593
00:48:01,517 --> 00:48:05,979
Matt? Tell me you didn't sign.

594
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:09,733
Because I'm still sort of
moved by your...

595
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,904
..."my word is stronger
than oak" thing.

596
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:18,450
We signed an hour ago.

597
00:48:19,327 --> 00:48:23,206
You were in the lobby
with the black fella.

598
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:29,754
Sorry, Jerry.
I just want to play football.

599
00:48:32,757 --> 00:48:37,387
- What do I do? How do I spin it?
- Honey, it's spun.

600
00:48:37,595 --> 00:48:40,015
What did I do to you?

601
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,059
It's all about you, isn't it?

602
00:48:42,268 --> 00:48:47,314
"Soothe me, save me, love me."
I have to finish my job.

603
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:49,567
Everything's on the run.

604
00:48:49,817 --> 00:48:53,362
You and I are sales people.
We sell.

605
00:48:53,571 --> 00:48:57,366
It's not "Love me"
or "Trust my handshake"...

606
00:48:57,616 --> 00:49:00,704
...it's " Make the sale!
Get it signed."

607
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:03,582
Jump right into my nightmare.

608
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:06,209
So now I can't be honest?

609
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:11,465
- I'd prefer loyalty.
- What'd we say when we got together?

610
00:49:11,673 --> 00:49:13,592
Brutal truth. Remember?

611
00:49:14,468 --> 00:49:16,970
I think you added the "brutal."

612
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:22,602
There's a sensitivity thing that some
people have. I don't have it.

613
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:25,980
I don't cry at movies,
or gush over babies...

614
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,191
...I don't do Christmas early...

615
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:32,069
...and I don't tell a man who
screwed up our lives:

616
00:49:32,278 --> 00:49:35,948
"Oh, poor baby."
That's me, for better or worse.

617
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:37,992
But I do love you.

618
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:45,459
- Avery, it's over.
- I didn't hear it.

619
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:50,005
- Something is missing.
- You've never been alone.

620
00:49:50,214 --> 00:49:52,132
- Listen.
- You can't be alone.

621
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:55,010
It's over.

622
00:49:57,971 --> 00:50:00,850
No one has ever dumped me.

623
00:50:02,018 --> 00:50:04,187
I'm not trying to make history.

624
00:50:05,063 --> 00:50:08,650
I climbed to the top of El Capitan...

625
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,154
...in 18 hours and 23 minutes.
I can make this work.

626
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:17,992
No.

627
00:50:18,868 --> 00:50:21,122
Oh, Jerry.

628
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:32,383
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

629
00:50:41,977 --> 00:50:47,399
I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
I'm too strong for you. Loser!

630
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:56,074
Roll with the punches.
Tomorrow's another day.

631
00:50:57,826 --> 00:50:59,286
Taxi!

632
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:02,206
You're loving me now, aren't you?

633
00:51:02,915 --> 00:51:05,585
Very much. Taxi!

634
00:51:05,835 --> 00:51:09,297
Is it my imagination?
Didn't we arrive in a limo?

635
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:14,927
<i>The question is... I hope I don't
sound like a shrink here, but...</i>

636
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:20,726
<i>... what's wrong?
- Man, I'm just a big disappointment.</i>

637
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:25,272
Jerry, everybody cries on this show.

638
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:28,358
If you tested positive,
quit doing blow.

639
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:34,323
Upset about your baby? Why'd you leave
her mother? I knew her, she's okay.

640
00:51:34,531 --> 00:51:39,620
<i>The media don't understand
the pressures $54 million comes with.</i>

641
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,542
- This is some bullshit.
- What are you doing with me, Rod?

642
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:50,381
- What?
- Don't you even see? I'm finished.

643
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,510
I am fucked!

644
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:56,846
Twenty-four hours ago I was hot!

645
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,723
Now...

646
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,477
...I'm a cautionary tale.

647
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:07,149
I don't need this jacket,
because I'm cloaked in failure!

648
00:52:07,399 --> 00:52:10,569
I lost him the night before the draft.

649
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:12,738
Why? Let's recap.

650
00:52:12,947 --> 00:52:17,576
Because a hockey player's kid
made me feel superficial.

651
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:21,915
I ate some bad pizza, went to bed
and grew a conscience!

652
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:26,586
Well, boo-fucking-hoo!

653
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,299
I got a shelf life of 10 years.

654
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:36,805
My next contract has to bring
the dollars that'll last a long time.

655
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:39,474
I'm done in five years.

656
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:42,103
What's my family gonna live on?

657
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:45,356
Huh? What you get me.

658
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:47,567
So I won't hear your shit.

659
00:52:47,817 --> 00:52:52,738
"Oh, I lost Cush and Avery..."

660
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:55,575
Could I have another drink, please?

661
00:52:55,825 --> 00:52:58,828
Anybody else would have
left you by now...

662
00:52:59,078 --> 00:53:02,416
...but I'm sticking with you.
I said I would.

663
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:06,503
If I gotta ride your ass,
you gonna show me the money.

664
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:09,214
You gonna show me the money.

665
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:16,305
We together on this. You know
what I'm saying? We gonna be one.

666
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:21,018
The both of us! You know?!

667
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,605
Oh, my God.

668
00:53:27,817 --> 00:53:30,695
<i>You have no messages.</i>

669
00:53:56,555 --> 00:54:01,435
He's coming. He just lost his
best client. I invited the guy over.

670
00:54:01,645 --> 00:54:07,067
This is not a guy. It's a syndrome.
"Early midlife, hanging by a thread...

671
00:54:07,275 --> 00:54:12,155
...I can't be alone, I'll call
my long-suffering assistant" syndrome.

672
00:54:12,364 --> 00:54:16,785
- But if that's what you want...
- Honey, he's engaged.

673
00:54:17,035 --> 00:54:21,540
And for the first time,
I'm part of something I believe in.

674
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:24,961
Okay. But he better not
be good-looking!

675
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:32,927
I'm Jerry Maguire.

676
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,850
Hello. You're just the way
I pictured you.

677
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:43,272
- I'm her disapproving sister, Laurel.
- Honesty.

678
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:45,065
Thank you.

679
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,112
Thank you. Dorothy!

680
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,994
Dorothy, your boss is here.

681
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,871
Hello.

682
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,544
Hey, you.

683
00:55:04,752 --> 00:55:07,422
- Thanks for inviting me over.
- Sure.

684
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:11,176
Where's the little guy?

685
00:55:11,426 --> 00:55:13,219
- He's sleeping.
- Sleeping.

686
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:20,935
I'm so glad you're home.
That alone thing is not my specialty.

687
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:22,938
Oh, my God!

688
00:55:27,735 --> 00:55:30,362
Well, I broke up with Avery.

689
00:55:36,076 --> 00:55:40,915
- Gosh, you know, that's too bad.
- No, it's better...

690
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:45,795
...because we'll still be friends.
It's better now than later.

691
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:52,469
- I'm dying here, aren't I?
- It's a really bad cut.

692
00:55:52,677 --> 00:55:56,014
Just think if I got her
the ring she really wanted.

693
00:56:02,103 --> 00:56:04,357
Why don't you have a seat?

694
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:11,030
I'll get some aloe vera for the cut.

695
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:14,617
- Do you have something to drink?
- Sure.

696
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:21,874
I heard.

697
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:26,255
No kidding. I saw the shadow
of curious shoes under the door.

698
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:30,634
He'd go home with a gardening tool
if it showed interest.

699
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:33,846
Use the frosted glasses.

700
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:35,848
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

701
00:56:36,056 --> 00:56:40,060
- I warmed up some chicken.
- That's the girl I love!

702
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,858
I'll only say this: You've always
been responsible with Ray.

703
00:56:45,108 --> 00:56:48,778
He shouldn't hear
a strange man's voice here.

704
00:56:48,987 --> 00:56:52,949
- Some drunken stranger.
- As opposed to 10 angry women?

705
00:56:54,617 --> 00:56:57,579
Lean forward. Okay, I've got it.

706
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:00,665
It's still edible. Change your shirt.

707
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,216
Hi, Jerry.

708
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:15,931
Hi, Ray. Aren't you
supposed to be in bed?

709
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,391
Yeah.

710
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:22,521
Don't worry, I won't tell.

711
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,943
The human head weighs eight pounds.

712
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,832
- Jerry Maguire.
- I think it's this one.

713
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:48,216
<i>You should dream about me.
I should be on your mind constantly.</i>

714
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:52,553
<i>That's when the dollars will flow.
The kwan will appear.</i>

715
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:56,808
- Who is this?
- Who is this? This is the Rod Tidwell.

716
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:59,310
I need to speak with my agent.

717
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:02,605
- We should be one.
- You a football player?

718
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:07,402
<i>A football player? I'm a teacher
about to whomp your ass!</i>

719
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:09,321
Put Jerry on the phone!

720
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:13,075
You just can't fall
for some drowning man.

721
00:58:13,325 --> 00:58:15,118
- Be practical.
- Practical?

722
00:58:15,327 --> 00:58:18,914
Turtleneck, sensible.
V-neck, sexy. Turtleneck.

723
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:23,962
Don't say that. What are other women
my age doing right now?

724
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:27,549
They're out partying,
trying to get a man.

725
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:31,803
Trying to keep a man.
Not me, I'm trying to raise a man.

726
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:37,600
This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day
reminder of Roger for my whole life.

727
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:42,272
- I've had three lovers in four years.
- That's not bad.

728
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:47,194
All of them ran a distant second
to a good book and a warm bath.

729
00:58:47,403 --> 00:58:51,615
Look at me. I'm the oldest
26-year-old in the world.

730
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:53,951
- Now, how do I look?
- Good.

731
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:55,995
Yeah? Thanks.

732
00:58:56,203 --> 00:59:00,666
<i>72%% % of new buyers are
African-American. That's what I am.</i>

733
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:05,213
- You talk too much.
- Talking is primitive communication.

734
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:08,758
<i>- It was fun talking to you. Bye.
- Jerry...!</i>

735
00:59:09,718 --> 00:59:13,388
- I'll make a ham sandwich.
- I wanna say one thing.

736
00:59:13,597 --> 00:59:17,726
- You do listen to me.
- Well, I love you. Mayo?

737
00:59:17,976 --> 00:59:20,729
- Repression, as a religion.

738
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:25,026
When my daddy retired from
the United Way after 38 years...

739
00:59:25,276 --> 00:59:30,239
...he said, " I wish they'd given me
a more comfortable chair."

740
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,116
And then my dad died.

741
00:59:32,366 --> 00:59:36,746
My mom took me to the zoo,
and I loved the zoo. And...

742
00:59:36,954 --> 00:59:38,080
Wait.

743
00:59:38,372 --> 00:59:43,127
- I want to tell you more about my dad.
- No, let's go to the zoo.

744
00:59:46,507 --> 00:59:47,925
You're right.

745
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:52,554
It's just my whole life,
I've been trying to talk.

746
00:59:52,804 --> 00:59:55,265
I mean, really talk.

747
00:59:55,516 --> 00:59:59,353
But no one wants to listen.
You know that feeling?

748
00:59:59,561 --> 01:00:03,607
- They just look at you...
- Let's go to the zoo, right now.

749
01:00:03,816 --> 01:00:08,571
The zoo, you know...
The fucking zoo's closed.

750
01:00:11,533 --> 01:00:13,576
You said "fuck."

751
01:00:14,702 --> 01:00:16,704
Yeah, I did.

752
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:19,457
- Is that...?
- I won't tell.

753
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:27,341
Well, then I'm gonna
have to take you to the zoo.

754
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:33,639
- I gotta go to bed, my mom's coming.
- Oh, wait...

755
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:37,685
I hear my mom. I gotta go to bed.

756
01:00:38,227 --> 01:00:41,105
- Thanks for listening.
- Sure.

757
01:00:43,023 --> 01:00:47,571
Okay. Drinks, food,
and I called you a cab.

758
01:00:50,115 --> 01:00:53,952
- Good idea.
- Quiet, I have a little boy asleep.

759
01:00:56,204 --> 01:00:57,247
Right.

760
01:00:58,165 --> 01:00:59,207
Our company.

761
01:01:03,461 --> 01:01:08,426
Look. A little...
A little speech before I go.

762
01:01:13,723 --> 01:01:18,561
Do not worry about your future.

763
01:01:18,895 --> 01:01:23,858
You and your son,
we, are just fine.

764
01:01:24,108 --> 01:01:25,944
You still have a job.

765
01:01:26,528 --> 01:01:31,575
But let me tell you something
about Jerry Maguire, okay?

766
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:35,996
You come after me, and you will lose.

767
01:01:36,747 --> 01:01:41,418
No, because I am a survivor.
I'm a survivor!

768
01:01:42,085 --> 01:01:47,509
Dorothy Boyd, you are
with the Lord of the Living Room.

769
01:01:47,842 --> 01:01:50,803
The King of the Kingdom!

770
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:53,264
And I am...

771
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,394
...drunk.

772
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,740
We meet again.

773
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:25,256
Here.

774
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,852
Truth?

775
01:02:38,603 --> 01:02:43,316
- Sure.
- I care about the job, of course.

776
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:46,946
But mostly,
I just want to be inspired.

777
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,493
- Me too.
- What you wrote inspired me.

778
01:02:55,788 --> 01:02:59,208
I'm working with you
because of that memo.

779
01:03:01,002 --> 01:03:02,879
I loved that memo.

780
01:03:06,758 --> 01:03:08,802
It's a mission statement.

781
01:03:22,316 --> 01:03:23,775
Well...

782
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:27,113
Sorry about the hand.

783
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:33,786
You know that feeling?

784
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:37,749
You're not completely
embarrassed yet...

785
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:41,169
...but you glimpse
tomorrow's embarrassment?

786
01:03:41,377 --> 01:03:44,422
Don't worry about it, boss.

787
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:47,301
Oh, shit. You said "boss."

788
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,930
- Yeah, I did.
- Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

789
01:03:51,138 --> 01:03:55,643
- No, don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
- I do. I feel like him.

790
01:03:55,851 --> 01:04:00,564
- I'm, like, harassing you right now.
- Well, I may not sue.

791
01:04:13,453 --> 01:04:15,831
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

792
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:21,878
Look, don't worry, okay?
I mean, don't...

793
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:27,885
We'll be okay because
I am gonna take my one client...

794
01:04:29,428 --> 01:04:32,181
...and we are gonna go all the way.

795
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:37,478
Because, hey...
I'm back.

796
01:04:39,856 --> 01:04:42,191
Don't worry.

797
01:04:57,499 --> 01:05:01,795
- Way to go, Rod. Good catch.
- You can't...

798
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:05,132
All right, good job.

799
01:05:08,094 --> 01:05:13,141
- Gotta talk about his contract, Dennis.
- Meet me at The Crocodile, 8:00.

800
01:05:14,184 --> 01:05:15,560
You bet.

801
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:36,874
Thank you.

802
01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:40,836
<i>Tell me you got lost.
I thought I was your friend.</i>

803
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:45,382
<i>- Something came up.
- Okay. $10 million for four years.</i>

804
01:05:45,591 --> 01:05:48,720
<i>- You're dreaming.
- Ten for four. It's a deal.</i>

805
01:05:50,388 --> 01:05:55,060
- He's got an attitude problem.
- He listens to me. I can help you.

806
01:05:55,268 --> 01:05:59,731
- He's a shrimp.
- He broke all the records last year.

807
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,985
I want a prototypical
wide receiver who's 6'3", 220.

808
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:07,447
<i>Not some guy who's 5'10" and bitches.</i>

809
01:06:07,656 --> 01:06:11,035
Dennis, I'm asking you...

810
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:13,788
...for a favour.

811
01:06:14,455 --> 01:06:19,627
<i>I introduced you to your wife.
We've spent Christmases together.</i>

812
01:06:19,836 --> 01:06:23,965
<i>- Holiday cheer.
- Jerry, you're reaching.</i>

813
01:06:24,173 --> 01:06:28,804
I'm asking for a favour.
Don't do this to me. We have history.

814
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:33,851
We got history, all right.
You drove the prices up for years.

815
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:39,481
- It's your turn at the end of the line.
- Dennis, don't...

816
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:48,575
I talked with Dennis Wilburn
about your renegotiation.

817
01:06:52,912 --> 01:06:54,205
Talking?

818
01:06:54,664 --> 01:07:00,086
Jerry Rice, Andre Reed, Chris Carter.
I smoked all these fools!

819
01:07:01,171 --> 01:07:03,882
Yet they're making the big dollars.

820
01:07:04,132 --> 01:07:08,804
They are making the kwan.
And you're talking.

821
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:15,978
- Kwan? That's your word?
- Hell yeah, that's my word.

822
01:07:16,187 --> 01:07:20,149
Some dudes might have coin,
but they'll never have kwan.

823
01:07:20,357 --> 01:07:21,483
What is...?

824
01:07:21,692 --> 01:07:27,114
It means love, respect, community
and dollars. The entire package.

825
01:07:29,284 --> 01:07:30,327
The kwan.

826
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:32,579
Great word.

827
01:07:34,664 --> 01:07:37,584
- Towel?
- No, I air-dry.

828
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:44,549
Listen, Rod. I say this
with great respect for you.

829
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,597
But those players you mentioned
are marquee players.

830
01:07:51,265 --> 01:07:55,186
- And this deal where, you know, we...
- Marquee?

831
01:07:55,394 --> 01:07:59,065
This is a renegotiation.
We want more from them.

832
01:07:59,273 --> 01:08:02,735
Show them your pure joy of the game.

833
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:05,780
Bury the attitude a bit,
and show them...

834
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:07,406
Wait.

835
01:08:07,823 --> 01:08:11,578
- You're telling me to dance.
- No. I'm saying...

836
01:08:12,287 --> 01:08:16,250
...to get back to the guy
who first started playing.

837
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:21,380
Way back when you were a kid, it
wasn't just about the money, was it?

838
01:08:22,256 --> 01:08:23,674
Was it?

839
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,926
Was it?

840
01:08:28,095 --> 01:08:31,641
Do your job.
Don't you tell me to dance!

841
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:33,685
- Fine.
- Hey. Hey!

842
01:08:33,893 --> 01:08:35,603
I am an athlete.

843
01:08:35,854 --> 01:08:38,273
- I am not an entertainer!
- Fine!

844
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:43,903
I do not dance, and I do not start
pre-season without a contract!

845
01:08:44,445 --> 01:08:48,116
- Fine, fine, fine!
- Jerry, talk to me.

846
01:08:49,284 --> 01:08:52,037
Breathe! Breathe, Jerry.

847
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,959
I am out here for you.

848
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:00,838
You don't know
what it's like to be me.

849
01:09:01,046 --> 01:09:05,176
It is an up-at-dawn,
pride-swallowing siege...

850
01:09:05,384 --> 01:09:09,138
...that I will never fully
tell you about, okay?!

851
01:09:12,475 --> 01:09:13,935
God. Help me!

852
01:09:15,061 --> 01:09:18,106
Help me, Rod. Help me help you.

853
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:23,069
Help me help you.

854
01:09:23,737 --> 01:09:26,656
Help me help you.

855
01:09:33,581 --> 01:09:35,208
I'm sorry.

856
01:09:36,334 --> 01:09:40,421
You are hanging on
by a very thin thread.

857
01:09:41,464 --> 01:09:43,549
And I dig that about you!

858
01:09:45,426 --> 01:09:49,639
No contract? I'll help me,
I'll help you, help everybody!

859
01:09:50,057 --> 01:09:54,561
- That's my man.
- Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

860
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,064
Help me! Help me!

861
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:02,945
- See you in Los Angeles.
- Jerry. Come on, man.

862
01:10:03,403 --> 01:10:06,198
See, that's the difference between us.

863
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:10,202
You think we're fighting.
I think we're talking.

864
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:19,045
Unless you love everybody,
you can't sell anybody.

865
01:10:28,972 --> 01:10:33,894
Dennis Wilburn is faxing his offer
for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

866
01:10:34,103 --> 01:10:37,940
- He said you'd be happy... Glad.
- He say happy or glad?

867
01:10:39,483 --> 01:10:42,319
Glad. He said glad. Glad.

868
01:10:43,487 --> 01:10:48,158
- Glad is good.
- We could sure use that commission.

869
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:52,372
Here. I did a rundown
on where you stand financially.

870
01:10:55,667 --> 01:11:00,505
- My condo was devalued.
- You don't have to explain.

871
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:04,801
The other night, I wanna apologize.

872
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,970
What happened there?

873
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:10,432
We're coworkers.
We can't have atmosphere.

874
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,060
I'm very relieved you said that.

875
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,606
You know, the other night,
I was lonely.

876
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,150
I felt you understood something.

877
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,987
We've got a company to think about.

878
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:26,240
I'll never take advantage
of you again.

879
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,827
- Good.
- You walked out on a job for me.

880
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,080
Can this be right?

881
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:34,249
Exactly.

882
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:39,546
I know you need to be alone
with your thoughts.

883
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:42,883
Think about what's wrong
and how to fix it.

884
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,761
And, you know, just be alone.

885
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:48,055
Alone.

886
01:11:54,062 --> 01:11:57,732
- You wanna go out to dinner?
- I know a great place.

887
01:11:57,941 --> 01:12:02,445
I broke up with that loser,
and then he started stalking me.

888
01:12:02,654 --> 01:12:07,033
- What do you mean by stalking?
- Coming over uninvited.

889
01:12:07,534 --> 01:12:12,248
"Coming over uninvited"?
So Romeo on your balcony is a stalker?

890
01:12:23,092 --> 01:12:25,386
Excuse me. Ladies?

891
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:31,433
Good evening,
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

892
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:36,648
- She's in the kitchen.
- Laurel. Hello.

893
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:42,445
- Where are you taking her tonight?
- You're the nanny?

894
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:45,824
- Au pair.
- Au pair? I see.

895
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:52,623
He likes you.

896
01:12:54,292 --> 01:12:57,378
My goodness.
I've got some gifts for you.

897
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:01,883
Do you like presents?
Good, all right.

898
01:13:02,592 --> 01:13:06,554
Arizona Cardinals.
It's the team Rod plays for.

899
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:10,266
- Dropping your laundry off?
- Want a Steelers hat?

900
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:13,020
- For me?
- I got some things.

901
01:13:13,228 --> 01:13:15,772
- I've got it in gray too.
- Thanks.

902
01:13:16,023 --> 01:13:19,693
You're very welcome.
Look what I've got here.

903
01:13:19,902 --> 01:13:23,155
An energy bar.
It'll keep you up all night.

904
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:27,701
That's not a good idea.
Aunt Laurel will eat that.

905
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:33,374
It looks like you've got a fan.

906
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:39,589
That's more than a dress,
that's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

907
01:13:39,797 --> 01:13:44,010
I got revved up at the thought
of an evening among adults.

908
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:47,222
- No offence, buddy.
- Jerry, you meet Chad?

909
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,683
Am I dressed okay? I didn't realize...

910
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:57,399
Don't let him stay up too late.

911
01:13:57,608 --> 01:14:02,071
Tonight, I'm gonna teach
Ray about jazz.

912
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,532
That'll put him to sleep early.

913
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:08,077
I want to go too.

914
01:14:08,285 --> 01:14:13,625
No, sweetheart, you stay here
with Chad and be good. Kiss me.

915
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:16,127
Let's go.

916
01:14:18,547 --> 01:14:20,173
- Good night.
- Good night.

917
01:14:20,382 --> 01:14:22,384
Give me a hug.

918
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:07,639
- I'll meet you at the car.
- Okay.

919
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,892
You forgot your keys.

920
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:14,355
I've never seen him kiss a man
just like a dad!

921
01:15:14,814 --> 01:15:19,194
Wasn't that thrilling?
He must have been needing that.

922
01:15:19,402 --> 01:15:23,907
Don't cry at the start of a date.
Cry at the end, like I do.

923
01:15:25,074 --> 01:15:28,286
Don't be a shoulder
for him to cry on either.

924
01:15:28,578 --> 01:15:31,206
- Keys.
- Oh, keys.

925
01:15:32,665 --> 01:15:34,335
Oh, dear.

926
01:15:59,945 --> 01:16:03,740
Ever since you've met me, I've been...

927
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:13,083
It was laziness, my breakup
with Avery. You know that saying?

928
01:16:13,291 --> 01:16:17,964
"It's nobody's fault." It's a lie.
Somebody is always to blame.

929
01:16:18,172 --> 01:16:22,176
You go for it like you do a job.
You work at it.

930
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:26,597
But maybe love shouldn't be
such hard work.

931
01:16:27,807 --> 01:16:30,017
Yeah, maybe so.

932
01:16:31,143 --> 01:16:36,066
But it's not every day
you say goodbye to a woman like that.

933
01:16:38,318 --> 01:16:41,572
- A song for the lovers?
- No, thank you.

934
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:47,202
- No, no, we work together.
- This is like an office meeting.

935
01:16:47,995 --> 01:16:50,038
But I know what you mean.

936
01:16:50,622 --> 01:16:56,045
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger
was any good, even before...

937
01:16:58,548 --> 01:17:00,258
Before?

938
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:04,554
- Jerry?
- What?

939
01:17:05,471 --> 01:17:08,600
Let's not tell our sad stories.

940
01:17:13,271 --> 01:17:16,775
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

941
01:17:46,181 --> 01:17:49,851
They sting. Let Chad
catch the bee in the glass.

942
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:55,107
He won't hurt him. You've got such
a good heart, buddy. I love you.

943
01:18:23,428 --> 01:18:26,807
Well, this would be good night.

944
01:18:27,474 --> 01:18:28,892
Good night.

945
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,646
I'll see you tomorrow.
It's a big day.

946
01:18:59,008 --> 01:19:00,092
Good night.

947
01:19:01,844 --> 01:19:03,304
Good night.

948
01:19:35,463 --> 01:19:36,505
Oops.

949
01:19:41,135 --> 01:19:45,014
- Let me fix this.
- Good idea.

950
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:42,157
I think you should not come in.

951
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:46,328
Or come in.

952
01:20:48,622 --> 01:20:53,627
- Depending on how you feel.
- The same to you.

953
01:20:56,214 --> 01:20:58,425
I have to go in.

954
01:20:59,759 --> 01:21:01,761
I live here.

955
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:11,146
Right.

956
01:21:15,817 --> 01:21:17,403
I'll come in.

957
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:21,365
Good.

958
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:33,044
Are you sure we want to do this?

959
01:21:37,174 --> 01:21:39,092
Oh, hell, yes.

960
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:52,105
- Did he have a good night?
- Yeah, he's asleep.

961
01:21:52,314 --> 01:21:56,401
- How did it go with sport-boy?
- Still going.

962
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,031
All right.

963
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,621
How are you?

964
01:22:09,332 --> 01:22:10,708
Treat her right.

965
01:22:15,255 --> 01:22:17,049
She's great.

966
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:26,725
I know this might be a bit awkward,
but I want you to use this.

967
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:29,395
No, look.
God...

968
01:22:31,105 --> 01:22:35,943
This is Miles Davis and John Coltrane.

969
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:39,030
Stockholm 1963.

970
01:22:39,614 --> 01:22:44,119
Two masters of freedom, playing
before their art was corrupted...

971
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:47,205
...by cocktail-lounge performers...

972
01:22:47,414 --> 01:22:52,836
...who destroyed the legacy
of the only American art form:

973
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:56,423
Jazz.

974
01:22:57,884 --> 01:23:00,636
I've put some Mingus on there too.

975
01:23:08,227 --> 01:23:13,441
- No barriers, no boundaries.
- Chad, I got it.

976
01:23:46,726 --> 01:23:48,186
Come here.

977
01:24:06,914 --> 01:24:10,292
You know this is gonna
change everything.

978
01:24:13,504 --> 01:24:15,089
Promise?

979
01:24:21,221 --> 01:24:23,848
What is this music?

980
01:24:57,967 --> 01:25:01,722
I love getting up in the morning!
I clap and say:

981
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,724
"This will be a great day!"

982
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:10,480
Great!
Did you really need to do this?

983
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:26,205
I'm getting him up, so don't worry.

984
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:30,168
What? I'm just waiting for coffee.
I don't care.

985
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:33,421
- Just tell me one thing.
- No.

986
01:25:36,925 --> 01:25:38,134
- Why...?
- I'm worried...

987
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:43,766
...you'll believe in a guy who may not
have an emotional marble in his head.

988
01:25:43,974 --> 01:25:46,602
- Please, if I start talking...
- You "please."

989
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:50,064
What am I for taking the opportunity?

990
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:55,569
- This guy's on the bottom rung.
- Maybe I am taking advantage.

991
01:25:55,778 --> 01:25:58,949
Does that make me a bad person? Huh?

992
01:25:59,157 --> 01:26:04,579
I found someone popular and charming
and not so nice to me, and he died.

993
01:26:04,871 --> 01:26:07,040
Why should I let this guy go...

994
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:11,962
...when everything in my body
says that this one is the one?

995
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:15,298
Take it easy.
I just wanted a few fun details.

996
01:26:16,508 --> 01:26:18,552
Why didn't you say so?

997
01:26:19,053 --> 01:26:23,349
Well, you might be interested
in this one little detail.

998
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:26,060
I was just about to tell you...

999
01:26:27,687 --> 01:26:30,022
...that I love him.

1000
01:26:31,315 --> 01:26:35,736
I do! I love him,
and I don't care what you think.

1001
01:26:35,945 --> 01:26:39,031
I love him for the man
he wants to be...

1002
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:42,452
...and for the man that he almost is.

1003
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:45,872
I love him, Laurel. I love him.

1004
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:49,626
- I love him!
- Hi, Jerry.

1005
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:53,839
Act natural.

1006
01:26:59,429 --> 01:27:02,765
- Tell me he's not there.
- He's not there.

1007
01:27:03,016 --> 01:27:04,851
Oh, God.

1008
01:27:05,101 --> 01:27:08,187
- Easy, ladies, easy.
- Coffee?

1009
01:27:09,105 --> 01:27:13,401
No, thanks. We bottom-feeders
prefer cereal first.

1010
01:27:14,027 --> 01:27:18,615
- Let's have Apple Jacks.
- Apple Jacks it is.

1011
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:22,995
Good morning, darling.

1012
01:27:25,748 --> 01:27:26,916
Morning.

1013
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:29,835
- What's going on?
- A lot, actually.

1014
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:33,881
We've got a big fax today.
We need this commission.

1015
01:27:34,256 --> 01:27:36,342
Need this commission. Milk?

1016
01:27:38,677 --> 01:27:40,305
Cheers.

1017
01:27:47,437 --> 01:27:50,523
That was really great
of you this morning.

1018
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:56,613
Let's just root for a big offer
so we can move out of this room...

1019
01:27:56,863 --> 01:27:59,282
...into a real office.

1020
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:02,203
Would you mind? Thanks a lot.

1021
01:28:10,628 --> 01:28:12,213
Shit.

1022
01:28:18,094 --> 01:28:22,266
1.7 for three years?
Man, we owe more than that!

1023
01:28:22,474 --> 01:28:25,394
This is the game.
I'll get back to them.

1024
01:28:25,602 --> 01:28:29,398
And say what? " Please remove
your dick from my ass"?

1025
01:28:29,606 --> 01:28:32,943
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little pregnant right now.

1026
01:28:33,151 --> 01:28:38,282
- I feel like crying.
- Let's not take this emotionally.

1027
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:42,704
- We'll roll with the problem.
- Why are you so calm?

1028
01:28:42,912 --> 01:28:46,583
Roll with this problem?
Don't take it emotionally?

1029
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:50,128
You haven't gotten emotional
enough over him!

1030
01:28:50,336 --> 01:28:53,339
- Get me Bob Sugar on the phone.
- Marcee...

1031
01:28:56,175 --> 01:29:00,931
- You wanna leave me?
- A lot of agents say a lot of shit.

1032
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,183
What do you stand for?!

1033
01:29:03,392 --> 01:29:08,564
How about integrity?
There's so much greed in the world...

1034
01:29:08,772 --> 01:29:11,734
...I don't know what to tell my son!

1035
01:29:11,942 --> 01:29:15,279
This guy isn't yelling,
"Show me the money!"

1036
01:29:15,487 --> 01:29:20,492
Do you know he's broke
and working for you for free?

1037
01:29:21,536 --> 01:29:24,789
Broke! Broke, broke, broke.

1038
01:29:25,415 --> 01:29:29,961
- I'm not as good at insults as she is.
- That was pretty good.

1039
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:32,088
No shit.

1040
01:29:33,381 --> 01:29:35,842
Let me show you something.

1041
01:29:39,429 --> 01:29:44,185
- Here. Rod, read this.
- No, no, no, no.

1042
01:29:44,685 --> 01:29:48,564
I just think that...
I think it's important.

1043
01:29:48,981 --> 01:29:51,234
I appreciate this, but...

1044
01:29:51,442 --> 01:29:54,820
You should be proud.
They should read it.

1045
01:29:55,529 --> 01:30:00,785
Tell me what to do. Tell me to eat
lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

1046
01:30:01,912 --> 01:30:04,831
You say this is the best,
all we can get...

1047
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,418
- All we can get?
- I'm talking with my agent.

1048
01:30:08,627 --> 01:30:14,049
This is what you're gonna do. You're
gonna reject that shitty contract.

1049
01:30:14,508 --> 01:30:19,930
Play out your existing shitty contract,
and next year, you're a free agent.

1050
01:30:20,764 --> 01:30:26,104
Baby, this is us. You and me.
We determine our worth.

1051
01:30:26,396 --> 01:30:28,690
You are a strong, proud...

1052
01:30:28,898 --> 01:30:32,569
...surviving, splendid black man.

1053
01:30:35,154 --> 01:30:36,573
Marcee...

1054
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:39,867
...you are the shit.

1055
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:44,873
Oh, baby.

1056
01:30:47,418 --> 01:30:52,548
- If you get injured, you get zero.
- Won't happen. I'm strong in mind.

1057
01:30:56,010 --> 01:31:00,848
- It's a risk.
- You bet on me, like I bet on you.

1058
01:31:07,105 --> 01:31:10,108
You know? My man!

1059
01:31:13,653 --> 01:31:15,822
You know, baby?

1060
01:31:17,365 --> 01:31:21,161
- You're so crazy.
- I love you, baby.

1061
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,291
- Let me kiss that head.
- Thank you.

1062
01:31:34,091 --> 01:31:38,679
- I'm taking that job in San Diego.
- Don't talk about that yet.

1063
01:31:39,013 --> 01:31:44,436
- You can't afford me.
- I'll find something fast for Tidwell.

1064
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:48,565
- I refuse to be a drain.
- We'll stay afloat.

1065
01:31:48,774 --> 01:31:53,237
We'll stay afloat. Don't leave.

1066
01:31:53,445 --> 01:31:57,241
- Get on the camel.
- You've been on my ass all day.

1067
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:00,244
- He's my client.
- Get him on the camel.

1068
01:32:00,452 --> 01:32:03,164
- I will.
- We don't need a camel.

1069
01:32:03,373 --> 01:32:07,752
- It's Camel Chevrolet.
- You see that? That's how I feel.

1070
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:10,964
- He's feeling my pain!
- Get on the camel!

1071
01:32:11,172 --> 01:32:16,094
- I'm pulling him from this.
- It's okay. Just get rid of the camel.

1072
01:32:16,302 --> 01:32:19,973
- This isn't what I had in mind.
- You're pulling him?

1073
01:32:20,181 --> 01:32:22,058
Right, let's bounce.

1074
01:32:22,977 --> 01:32:27,314
Pulling him? Then you shouldn't
have begged me to hire him.

1075
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:32,570
I know you needed that commission,
but we won't get Reebok...

1076
01:32:32,778 --> 01:32:35,614
...with no regional Camel ad.
Excuse me.

1077
01:32:35,906 --> 01:32:41,036
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Are we gonna be friends now?

1078
01:32:41,287 --> 01:32:46,251
- What do you know about single moms?
- I was raised by one.

1079
01:32:46,459 --> 01:32:51,840
Tell me. Because after this, she'll
have to take that job in San Diego.

1080
01:32:52,048 --> 01:32:56,344
First of all, single mothers
don't date. Watch yourself.

1081
01:32:56,553 --> 01:33:01,057
They've been to the circus.
You know what I mean?

1082
01:33:01,266 --> 01:33:05,062
They've been to the puppet show
and seen the strings.

1083
01:33:05,271 --> 01:33:07,815
- You love her?
- How do I know?

1084
01:33:08,024 --> 01:33:10,234
You know when you know.

1085
01:33:10,443 --> 01:33:15,156
I don't want her to go. I've been
hanging out at her place a lot.

1086
01:33:15,364 --> 01:33:19,327
That right there is bullshit!
You gotta be fair to her.

1087
01:33:19,535 --> 01:33:24,041
Single mothers are a sacred thing.
You gotta have the talk.

1088
01:33:25,876 --> 01:33:30,881
She loves you. If you don't love her,
you have got to tell her.

1089
01:33:33,842 --> 01:33:37,554
The kid's amazing. He...

1090
01:33:39,973 --> 01:33:42,559
I feel you. I feel you, dog.

1091
01:33:42,768 --> 01:33:47,357
But a real man wouldn't shoplift
the pootie from a single mother.

1092
01:33:48,483 --> 01:33:51,653
I didn't shoplift the pootie.

1093
01:33:56,950 --> 01:34:01,371
All right. I shoplifted the pootie.

1094
01:34:10,214 --> 01:34:15,135
You know, John Coltrane
once said to Miles Davis...

1095
01:34:15,803 --> 01:34:20,891
When you say goodbye to him, just
be cool. What's meant to be will be.

1096
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:26,439
You'll see each other. I'm losing
the only person who listens to me.

1097
01:34:26,648 --> 01:34:30,277
- Quit making me laugh.
- You're doing the right thing.

1098
01:34:30,485 --> 01:34:33,947
Start your life.
Don't cushion the fall for him.

1099
01:34:34,155 --> 01:34:37,409
Check out Exhibit A on the front lawn.

1100
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,831
- I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.
- Goodbye.

1101
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:44,917
All right. Goodbye.

1102
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,505
Bye.

1103
01:34:56,429 --> 01:35:00,141
Listen, you're gonna
like it in San Diego.

1104
01:35:04,646 --> 01:35:08,942
It's gonna be great there.
You'll make a lot of friends.

1105
01:35:09,818 --> 01:35:14,323
- I'm gonna see you this weekend.
- Go ahead and go.

1106
01:35:19,703 --> 01:35:22,039
Go ahead and go.

1107
01:35:32,926 --> 01:35:37,055
- Sure you're okay to drive this?
- This rig? No problem.

1108
01:35:37,263 --> 01:35:42,310
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

1109
01:35:42,518 --> 01:35:47,191
I'll see you in a couple of days,
and I love you.

1110
01:35:48,525 --> 01:35:50,611
I love you too.

1111
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:54,114
- What?
- Nothing.

1112
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:56,659
I'll see you soon.

1113
01:35:57,576 --> 01:36:02,164
Look, if this weekend
should turn into next month...

1114
01:36:02,373 --> 01:36:07,754
...and next month turns into whenever,
don't make a joke of your life.

1115
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:11,091
Go back and read what you wrote.

1116
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:16,721
You're better than the Bob Sugars.
Don't forget that.

1117
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:37,702
- Wait! Wait a second.
- No, no! Oh, God.

1118
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:44,417
- We can save on medical, rent...
- Don't listen to him.

1119
01:36:44,626 --> 01:36:48,380
What if we stay together?
What if we got married?

1120
01:36:49,715 --> 01:36:55,137
- If I said that, would you stay?
- Don't do that. Don't say that unless...

1121
01:36:55,387 --> 01:36:58,599
Well, say it if you want to.

1122
01:37:04,021 --> 01:37:05,481
Will you marry me?

1123
01:37:11,904 --> 01:37:13,615
What are you thinking?

1124
01:37:48,318 --> 01:37:50,528
We're getting married.

1125
01:37:51,571 --> 01:37:56,409
Do you, Jerry Maguire,
take this woman to be your wife?

1126
01:37:56,826 --> 01:37:57,869
Not yet.

1127
01:37:58,078 --> 01:38:03,500
And do you, Dorothy Boyd,
take this man to be your husband?

1128
01:38:04,668 --> 01:38:05,795
Almost.

1129
01:38:06,003 --> 01:38:08,547
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1130
01:38:08,798 --> 01:38:11,217
- Okay, sweetie.
- Oh, yeah.

1131
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:52,093
I should go.

1132
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:57,932
Come on, brother. Talk to me, brother.

1133
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,365
We did it.

1134
01:39:14,783 --> 01:39:16,493
We sure did.

1135
01:39:36,139 --> 01:39:38,725
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

1136
01:39:45,231 --> 01:39:47,568
I'm glad we had this talk.

1137
01:39:49,737 --> 01:39:51,822
Oh, look at them.

1138
01:39:54,533 --> 01:39:57,370
She is so beautiful.

1139
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:16,556
I do not believe
they have this on tape.

1140
01:40:17,849 --> 01:40:20,102
Hey, that's my bro.

1141
01:40:23,313 --> 01:40:26,985
See, now I'm gonna
release this to ESPN.

1142
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:34,075
- You think I'm joking.
- No, it's okay. I know where you live.

1143
01:40:36,786 --> 01:40:39,706
You didn't have the talk, did you?

1144
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,668
No.

1145
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:48,257
Well, this definitely
was another way to go.

1146
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,137
Hey, Dorothy, come here.

1147
01:40:53,345 --> 01:40:57,016
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Maguire.

1148
01:40:57,641 --> 01:41:00,352
We're gonna have a great season!

1149
01:41:09,112 --> 01:41:11,531
Scotty, Tidwell did four for 36.

1150
01:41:14,743 --> 01:41:16,578
- Jerry.
- Dennis.

1151
01:41:16,828 --> 01:41:19,205
- He's having a good game. So far.
- He is.

1152
01:41:19,623 --> 01:41:21,833
You're gonna miss him next year.

1153
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:25,003
<i>Loser.</i>

1154
01:41:27,423 --> 01:41:31,302
<i>I've got a great team behind me
and I'm loving it.</i>

1155
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,810
That's my mo'fo!

1156
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:42,313
Come here.

1157
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:49,279
Why don't you be the first man
in your family not to use that word?

1158
01:41:49,529 --> 01:41:53,533
And we'll let you live.
Now go kiss Daddy, quick.

1159
01:41:56,578 --> 01:41:57,663
Come on, now!

1160
01:41:58,622 --> 01:42:00,832
Come on, Rod!

1161
01:42:04,044 --> 01:42:07,047
I saw you limping
after the first quarter.

1162
01:42:07,256 --> 01:42:08,967
Yeah, I...

1163
01:42:11,427 --> 01:42:15,431
I sprained my ankle on the ice
out there. It was cold.

1164
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,141
All right. Thanks.

1165
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:22,063
That went well.
Anybody else worth talking to? No.

1166
01:42:22,272 --> 01:42:23,982
Let's get out of here.

1167
01:42:25,566 --> 01:42:28,362
- How's your head?
- Bubblicious.

1168
01:42:29,697 --> 01:42:31,824
- How are you?
- Hey, Rod.

1169
01:42:32,032 --> 01:42:35,160
- How you doing, man?
- Hanging in there.

1170
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:42,918
That quarterback sucks.
He's gonna get me killed.

1171
01:42:43,127 --> 01:42:46,630
He's throwing high
and across the middle.

1172
01:42:46,839 --> 01:42:50,635
My brain's blown because
you weren't asshole enough...

1173
01:42:50,844 --> 01:42:54,014
...to get me my 10 million
three months ago.

1174
01:42:56,349 --> 01:43:00,895
Take care of yourself on that field.
You're my entire client roster.

1175
01:43:01,104 --> 01:43:05,317
Don't I know this.
Now go home to your wife.

1176
01:43:05,525 --> 01:43:08,487
- What's that mean?
- What are you doing here?

1177
01:43:08,696 --> 01:43:13,200
- You could've told me on the phone.
- How about personal attention?

1178
01:43:13,409 --> 01:43:16,829
- You don't want to go home.
- What are you saying?

1179
01:43:17,038 --> 01:43:21,417
I'm just trying to talk to you.
How's your marriage?

1180
01:43:21,626 --> 01:43:24,670
The husband and wife thing,
how is that?

1181
01:43:32,054 --> 01:43:36,767
- Not everyone has what you have.
- Why did you get married?

1182
01:43:37,601 --> 01:43:41,563
- I'm just asking as a friend.
- You want an answer?

1183
01:43:41,855 --> 01:43:43,440
Loyalty.

1184
01:43:44,524 --> 01:43:46,151
She was loyal.

1185
01:43:50,698 --> 01:43:55,119
I mean, you know,
everything grew from there.

1186
01:43:55,536 --> 01:43:57,455
It just...

1187
01:43:58,498 --> 01:44:00,124
...grew from there.

1188
01:44:01,417 --> 01:44:05,546
- That's an answer.
- That's the answer.

1189
01:44:05,838 --> 01:44:10,594
It's not sexy. Shit!
But that's an answer.

1190
01:44:10,803 --> 01:44:15,349
"Tell him what he's won, Bob."
"A beautiful marriage!"

1191
01:44:15,724 --> 01:44:17,351
Shit!

1192
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:22,439
Well, I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, Rod.

1193
01:44:25,776 --> 01:44:27,903
I have a question for you.

1194
01:44:28,153 --> 01:44:30,156
- Are we really friends?
- Why not?

1195
01:44:30,407 --> 01:44:35,370
Friends can tell each other anything
if we have our friends hats on, right?

1196
01:44:35,578 --> 01:44:37,205
- I think so.
- All right.

1197
01:44:38,498 --> 01:44:41,626
Here's why you don't
have your $10 million.

1198
01:44:41,835 --> 01:44:46,715
You're a paycheck player. You play
with your head, not your heart.

1199
01:44:46,923 --> 01:44:49,218
In your personal life? Heart.

1200
01:44:49,427 --> 01:44:52,805
On the field,
it's about what you didn't get.

1201
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:55,433
Who's to blame, who underthrew...

1202
01:44:55,641 --> 01:44:59,854
...who has the contract you don't,
who's not giving you love!

1203
01:45:00,062 --> 01:45:05,067
That is not what inspires people!
That is not what inspires people!

1204
01:45:05,276 --> 01:45:09,323
Just shut up!
Play the game from your heart.

1205
01:45:09,531 --> 01:45:13,827
Then I'll show you the kwan.
And that's the truth!

1206
01:45:14,036 --> 01:45:18,957
Can you handle it? It's just
a question from a friend. You know?

1207
01:45:21,168 --> 01:45:24,880
When they call you shrimp,
I'm the one who defends you!

1208
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:27,924
- I don't wanna be friends no more.
- Fine.

1209
01:45:28,133 --> 01:45:31,554
Quit using that word "kwan."
That's my word!

1210
01:45:31,763 --> 01:45:34,432
- I'll see you in L.A.
- No heart?!

1211
01:45:35,558 --> 01:45:38,353
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

1212
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:20,855
- How many concussions has he had?
- I can't get no respect.

1213
01:46:21,064 --> 01:46:23,024
I'm making miracles happen.

1214
01:46:41,419 --> 01:46:45,756
I went to see this so-called
black film the other day.

1215
01:46:46,215 --> 01:46:49,468
No more salt.
Your biggest game is coming up.

1216
01:46:49,677 --> 01:46:53,432
<i>I don't want you dehydrated
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1217
01:46:55,559 --> 01:47:00,856
Twenty minutes of coming attractions.
All black films, all violent.

1218
01:47:01,064 --> 01:47:06,236
- Brothers shooting brothers.
- I hate you seeing movies alone.

1219
01:47:06,445 --> 01:47:10,742
- Baby.
- My Pisces queen.

1220
01:47:13,328 --> 01:47:15,830
I hate seeing movies without you.

1221
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:21,586
I won't do it anymore, okay?

1222
01:47:31,013 --> 01:47:33,474
- Baby.
- Baby!

1223
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,188
- Now?
- Baby now!

1224
01:47:40,856 --> 01:47:44,818
- Ray, it's time to go.
- You got them?

1225
01:47:45,027 --> 01:47:47,863
Do you take Visa? Take it!

1226
01:47:49,239 --> 01:47:51,493
What were you thinking tonight...

1227
01:47:51,701 --> 01:47:56,665
...watching them go through
the entire human emotional experience?

1228
01:47:56,915 --> 01:47:59,876
"I hope he doesn't get injured."

1229
01:48:02,087 --> 01:48:03,838
I felt responsible.

1230
01:48:05,548 --> 01:48:10,178
Sometimes I can't tell at all
what's going on in your head.

1231
01:48:16,269 --> 01:48:19,563
And I don't know your noises yet.

1232
01:48:20,398 --> 01:48:25,820
- Well, when you wonder, ask me.
- Okay, I will.

1233
01:48:27,154 --> 01:48:29,365
I thought I just did.

1234
01:48:34,579 --> 01:48:37,416
- Why do you love me?
- Why do you love me?

1235
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:40,544
Can I come and watch TV?

1236
01:48:40,919 --> 01:48:43,547
- In just a minute.
- For a few minutes.

1237
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:05,028
<i>Hang in there.
He's not going anywhere.</i>

1238
01:49:05,653 --> 01:49:07,113
I know.

1239
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:11,493
- Can we talk about something else?
- I don't think so.

1240
01:49:11,702 --> 01:49:16,707
I'm incapable of small talk.
But that's why you love me, right?

1241
01:49:30,137 --> 01:49:33,642
I'm about personal attention.
This is my life.

1242
01:49:33,892 --> 01:49:36,561
I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

1243
01:49:36,811 --> 01:49:40,774
<i>I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1244
01:49:40,982 --> 01:49:44,527
I can be in Indiana
by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

1245
01:49:44,736 --> 01:49:46,738
Just give me 20 minutes.

1246
01:49:47,364 --> 01:49:50,283
I'm not asking for an answer now.

1247
01:49:50,492 --> 01:49:54,664
I'll call you tomorrow.
Just enjoy your day. Tell Doug hi.

1248
01:49:55,164 --> 01:49:58,459
All right, thank you.
Same to you, Marilee.

1249
01:50:01,796 --> 01:50:05,508
Indiana, Tuesday. I'll be there.

1250
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,013
It's my fault.

1251
01:50:13,642 --> 01:50:14,851
What?

1252
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,021
It's not fair to you,
this whole thing.

1253
01:50:21,733 --> 01:50:23,026
Come here.

1254
01:50:24,278 --> 01:50:27,197
Tell me. Let me help.

1255
01:50:27,656 --> 01:50:31,535
I took advantage of you.
Worst of all, I'm not alone.

1256
01:50:31,743 --> 01:50:34,289
I did this with a kid.

1257
01:50:34,539 --> 01:50:39,627
I was just on some wild ride
where I thought that...

1258
01:50:39,877 --> 01:50:44,507
...I was in love enough
for both of us.

1259
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,553
I pretended your proposal was real...

1260
01:50:48,761 --> 01:50:52,015
...when it might have been
a hypothetical.

1261
01:50:54,601 --> 01:50:56,603
I did this.

1262
01:50:57,021 --> 01:51:00,357
At least I can do something
about it now.

1263
01:51:01,233 --> 01:51:03,944
I'm not a guy who runs.

1264
01:51:04,194 --> 01:51:05,988
I stick.

1265
01:51:08,115 --> 01:51:11,201
Well, I don't need you to stick.

1266
01:51:11,785 --> 01:51:14,873
What do you want?
My soul or something?

1267
01:51:15,081 --> 01:51:20,503
- Why not? I deserve that.
- What if I'm not built that way?

1268
01:51:22,881 --> 01:51:26,843
- I think we made a mistake.
- What if it's true?

1269
01:51:29,179 --> 01:51:32,516
"Great at friendship,
bad at intimacy."

1270
01:51:32,725 --> 01:51:36,687
It's the theme of my bachelor film,
for God's sake.

1271
01:51:36,896 --> 01:51:41,692
I know, I watched it.
I sort of know it by heart.

1272
01:51:45,154 --> 01:51:48,532
- I don't like to give up.
- Please.

1273
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:55,207
My need to make the best of things,
and your need to be responsible...

1274
01:51:55,415 --> 01:52:00,212
If we don't say something about
it now, we could lose 10 years...

1275
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,297
...being polite.

1276
01:52:04,299 --> 01:52:08,971
Let's just call this next road trip
what it really is:

1277
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:12,516
A nice long break.

1278
01:52:20,942 --> 01:52:22,735
What about Ray?

1279
01:52:26,656 --> 01:52:29,200
Well, you'll be friends.

1280
01:52:30,326 --> 01:52:31,911
Friends?

1281
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:40,921
- Of course you'll be friends.
- I'll take him to the zoo.

1282
01:52:45,134 --> 01:52:48,220
So this break is a breakup? That's...

1283
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:52,975
Come on, Jerry.
You know this isn't easy for me.

1284
01:52:53,893 --> 01:52:56,730
On the surface,
everything looks fine.

1285
01:52:57,605 --> 01:53:00,692
I've got this great guy.

1286
01:53:01,526 --> 01:53:04,446
And he loves my kid.

1287
01:53:06,781 --> 01:53:09,659
And he sure does like me a lot.

1288
01:53:16,208 --> 01:53:19,045
And I can't live like that.

1289
01:53:22,048 --> 01:53:24,884
It's not how I'm built.

1290
01:53:57,502 --> 01:54:02,215
If this is empty,
this doesn't matter.

1291
01:54:24,321 --> 01:54:26,824
It was just a mission statement.

1292
01:54:42,841 --> 01:54:44,968
Put your arms up, please.

1293
01:54:58,941 --> 01:55:03,029
Hey, buddy. I wondered
where you were. How's it going?

1294
01:55:03,321 --> 01:55:05,197
Get out of here. Go.

1295
01:55:07,867 --> 01:55:11,245
- Where's your agent?
- I don't know.

1296
01:55:11,829 --> 01:55:16,543
You belong with the big boys.
You belong with the big money.

1297
01:55:16,752 --> 01:55:21,131
- You're fucking Rod Tidwell!
- Get away from my guy.

1298
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:25,469
- I was just telling...
- Just go. Flee.

1299
01:55:25,677 --> 01:55:30,015
This is a nice moment for you.
I'm gonna let you have it.

1300
01:55:32,142 --> 01:55:35,188
Give me a call, Rod.
Say hi to Marcee.

1301
01:55:42,945 --> 01:55:45,782
- Thanks for coming.
- I missed you.

1302
01:55:48,409 --> 01:55:52,121
What can I say?
You're all I've got.

1303
01:55:54,415 --> 01:55:59,838
Frank Gifford with Al Michaels and
Dan Dierdorf at the Sun Devil Stadium.

1304
01:56:00,089 --> 01:56:04,635
<i>The story is the Cardinals
are still alive for a playoff spot.</i>

1305
01:56:04,843 --> 01:56:09,598
<i>The reason for that is
the outstanding play of Rod Tidwell.</i>

1306
01:56:09,807 --> 01:56:11,892
<i>We'll talk about that too.</i>

1307
01:56:12,101 --> 01:56:15,730
The Dallas Cowboys
know they're in the playoffs.

1308
01:56:15,939 --> 01:56:18,984
<i>Going for a consecutive Super Bowl.</i>

1309
01:56:19,401 --> 01:56:22,696
If Arizona wins tonight
and next week...

1310
01:56:22,904 --> 01:56:28,326
<i>... they'll make the playoffs
for the first time in 21 years.</i>

1311
01:56:29,077 --> 01:56:32,747
<i>Better not mess up
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1312
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:37,503
What did I say? He's always
nervous for televised games.

1313
01:56:37,712 --> 01:56:42,508
<i>The Cowboys continue their mission
on Monday Night Football.</i>

1314
01:56:50,057 --> 01:56:52,393
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi, good game.

1315
01:56:52,643 --> 01:56:55,731
- Great column this morning.
- Thanks.

1316
01:57:01,153 --> 01:57:02,529
Fuck you, punk!

1317
01:57:09,786 --> 01:57:12,164
It's a real bruiser out there.

1318
01:57:12,372 --> 01:57:16,628
<i>The Cardinals refuse to go
quietly into the desert night...</i>

1319
01:57:16,836 --> 01:57:21,674
...as the interminable season winds
down. Just trying to be poetic.

1320
01:57:21,883 --> 01:57:23,885
<i>Wax on, Al. Wax on.</i>

1321
01:57:26,012 --> 01:57:28,014
<i>A tough hit on Tidwell.</i>

1322
01:57:28,222 --> 01:57:29,641
Nothing poetic about that.

1323
01:57:29,807 --> 01:57:34,354
<i>- I'd have made that a touchdown.
- That's his sixth catch tonight.</i>

1324
01:57:34,562 --> 01:57:37,399
<i>Split to the right. Swenson looks.</i>

1325
01:57:37,608 --> 01:57:40,194
<i>A first down at the 19-yard line.</i>

1326
01:57:41,445 --> 01:57:45,783
<i>Another savage hit
across the middle on Rod Tidwell.</i>

1327
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:48,661
<i>They're working Tidwell, aren't they?</i>

1328
01:57:48,869 --> 01:57:53,707
- What does Daddy always say?
- It looks worse than it really is.

1329
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:56,962
He's gonna kill himself.

1330
01:57:57,170 --> 01:57:59,130
- Be quiet.
- What did I say?

1331
01:57:59,339 --> 01:58:02,676
Two minutes to play.
Dallas leading by three.

1332
01:58:02,884 --> 01:58:07,389
<i>Second down and one now
at the Dallas 11-yard line.</i>

1333
01:58:07,597 --> 01:58:11,059
<i>Swenson backs to pass. A blitz!</i>

1334
01:58:11,267 --> 01:58:14,187
<i>Down he goes!
Sacked for a six-yard loss.</i>

1335
01:58:14,396 --> 01:58:17,650
<i>Good move coming with a blitz
after Swenson.</i>

1336
01:58:17,858 --> 01:58:22,655
<i>He had too many men in that pattern.
They couldn't pick up the blitz.</i>

1337
01:58:24,573 --> 01:58:27,702
90 razor, X-out on one, ready?

1338
01:58:29,328 --> 01:58:31,080
Here we go!

1339
01:58:31,288 --> 01:58:34,250
<i>He had a chance to get rid of it.</i>

1340
01:58:34,458 --> 01:58:37,796
<i>They've now gone to third and seven.</i>

1341
01:58:38,005 --> 01:58:43,010
<i>In the waning moments of this game,
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.</i>

1342
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:47,389
<i>Tidwell in motion.
Moving back to his left now.</i>

1343
01:58:47,597 --> 01:58:52,477
<i>Play fake. Swenson, protected well,
lofts one into the end zone.</i>

1344
01:58:52,686 --> 01:58:55,230
<i>Tidwell! Touchdown, Cardinals!</i>

1345
01:58:55,439 --> 01:58:59,152
<i>- Did you see him go up on that ball?
- He held onto it.</i>

1346
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:03,990
<i>He's still down. Tidwell, upside down,
hits the ground hard.</i>

1347
01:59:04,198 --> 01:59:08,661
<i>- He maintains control of the football.
- He's hurt too.</i>

1348
01:59:08,870 --> 01:59:10,538
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

1349
01:59:10,747 --> 01:59:15,668
<i>- Concerned look on the players' faces.
- Get up, baby.</i>

1350
01:59:17,004 --> 01:59:20,424
<i>The trainer out.
It's Tidwell's ninth catch.</i>

1351
01:59:20,633 --> 01:59:24,219
<i>- Oh, my God.
- He gives Arizona the lead.</i>

1352
01:59:32,353 --> 01:59:36,315
- Can you hear me?
- Blink! Come on, blink!

1353
01:59:43,823 --> 01:59:47,369
Commercial! Show me
what's wrong with my husband.

1354
01:59:47,577 --> 01:59:50,747
- I said he was too small for the NFL.
- Shut up.

1355
01:59:50,955 --> 01:59:55,752
- It's the truth. I'm keeping it real!
- Tee Pee, shut up!

1356
01:59:55,960 --> 02:00:01,342
Can't you be loyal to your brother?
Get the hell out of my house!

1357
02:00:02,051 --> 02:00:05,429
Hello? Hold on.
It's Jerry Maguire.

1358
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:07,807
Punk!

1359
02:00:10,101 --> 02:00:13,437
Jerry? Oh, my God,
I am freaking out.

1360
02:00:13,646 --> 02:00:16,190
Marcee, he's unconscious.

1361
02:00:16,399 --> 02:00:21,113
Just stay calm. Keep the lines open,
I will call you back.

1362
02:00:21,321 --> 02:00:23,991
There are good doctors. Stay calm.

1363
02:00:24,199 --> 02:00:27,995
You have to tell me something.
I am freaking here.

1364
02:00:28,203 --> 02:00:32,833
We gotta stay calm.
Your family needs you to stay calm.

1365
02:00:33,333 --> 02:00:37,295
I know, but my whole life
is this family...

1366
02:00:37,505 --> 02:00:40,550
...and it does not work without him!

1367
02:00:41,259 --> 02:00:45,638
<i>All eyes at Sun Devil Stadium
are focused on Rod Tidwell.</i>

1368
02:00:45,847 --> 02:00:49,726
I am so sorry about
everything I said about your job.

1369
02:00:49,934 --> 02:00:53,688
Just do whatever you can
to get Rod to me, please.

1370
02:00:53,896 --> 02:00:58,152
Just do whatever you can.
Please, Jerry.

1371
02:00:58,736 --> 02:01:03,657
<i>At a time like this, you just hope
his family is not watching this.</i>

1372
02:01:04,825 --> 02:01:08,078
It could be his neck.
It could be his back.

1373
02:01:12,082 --> 02:01:15,169
Blink, baby! Come on, wake up!

1374
02:01:17,171 --> 02:01:19,466
We love you, Rod!

1375
02:01:29,225 --> 02:01:31,227
Can you hear me?

1376
02:01:31,853 --> 02:01:33,563
Can you hear me?

1377
02:01:33,772 --> 02:01:36,232
Do you know where you are?

1378
02:01:36,441 --> 02:01:39,445
<i>The trainer's still trying
to revive him.</i>

1379
02:01:39,654 --> 02:01:41,989
We'd love to see some movement.

1380
02:01:42,198 --> 02:01:45,493
- Rod?
- Let's get him off the field.

1381
02:01:45,701 --> 02:01:48,829
- No.
- Get the gurney. Get him off the field.

1382
02:01:49,038 --> 02:01:53,751
Wait, wait. Just let me
enjoy this for a minute.

1383
02:01:53,959 --> 02:01:58,340
<i>We're looking for some movement.
Is that his head coming up?</i>

1384
02:01:59,091 --> 02:02:01,134
<i>He's trying to get up.</i>

1385
02:02:02,844 --> 02:02:04,388
<i>He is getting up.</i>

1386
02:02:12,938 --> 02:02:16,024
Look at him! Oh, Mommy, he's okay.

1387
02:02:20,029 --> 02:02:22,907
<i>The whole stadium is standing.</i>

1388
02:02:23,116 --> 02:02:25,743
He's up on his feet
and the crowd loves it.

1389
02:02:54,189 --> 02:02:59,612
Here's a guy who's normally very
truculent with the media, aloof...

1390
02:03:15,045 --> 02:03:18,590
<i>- We're happy for you.
- He'll get a flag on this.</i>

1391
02:03:18,798 --> 02:03:20,634
<i>Who cares!</i>

1392
02:03:36,067 --> 02:03:39,154
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Helluva game.

1393
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:42,074
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1394
02:03:50,207 --> 02:03:52,501
<i>You are gonna pay.</i>

1395
02:03:52,709 --> 02:03:55,420
I know. I know.

1396
02:04:15,316 --> 02:04:17,318
Where's Jerry?

1397
02:04:37,214 --> 02:04:39,008
You did it.

1398
02:04:39,425 --> 02:04:41,094
You did.

1399
02:04:42,804 --> 02:04:45,890
Why don't we have
that kind of relationship?

1400
02:04:54,816 --> 02:04:57,152
Is that your porty or mine?

1401
02:05:00,364 --> 02:05:01,949
Dorothy?

1402
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:06,329
Marcee. No, he's right here.

1403
02:05:06,579 --> 02:05:10,291
It's Marcee. She couldn't
get through on your phone.

1404
02:05:12,668 --> 02:05:17,214
We did it. I love you.
I love you so much!

1405
02:05:21,636 --> 02:05:23,638
I love you!

1406
02:05:28,685 --> 02:05:32,064
I love you, Tyson.
I love you, baby.

1407
02:05:32,272 --> 02:05:34,900
How's the baby? How's Katie?

1408
02:05:35,609 --> 02:05:38,445
Oh, I love you so much.

1409
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:43,242
You know ain't nothing
gonna happen to me.

1410
02:05:51,626 --> 02:05:56,631
The problem is, like you were
saying earlier, the biorhythms.

1411
02:05:58,049 --> 02:06:01,178
I was saying
the neural pathways are set.

1412
02:06:01,387 --> 02:06:06,225
That's why it's hard
for people to change.

1413
02:06:09,895 --> 02:06:14,566
I'm sorry, these stupid holidays
make me feel more divorced.

1414
02:06:15,025 --> 02:06:19,738
You know? With the songs,
the constant chocolate-eating...

1415
02:06:35,755 --> 02:06:38,717
I have a confession to make.

1416
02:06:39,217 --> 02:06:44,098
I've listened to you all
tell a thousand sob stories.

1417
02:06:44,306 --> 02:06:46,684
I've been very judgmental.

1418
02:06:46,892 --> 02:06:51,188
Maybe you're all correct.
Men are the enemy.

1419
02:06:51,397 --> 02:06:54,984
No, they're not the enemy.

1420
02:06:55,234 --> 02:06:58,529
But I still love the enemy.

1421
02:07:12,461 --> 02:07:13,754
Hello.

1422
02:07:16,214 --> 02:07:18,592
I'm looking for my wife.

1423
02:07:31,105 --> 02:07:32,273
Wait.

1424
02:07:42,576 --> 02:07:47,122
If this is where it has to happen,
then it's where it happens.

1425
02:07:48,248 --> 02:07:53,170
I'm not letting you get rid of me.
How about that?

1426
02:07:58,759 --> 02:08:02,931
This used to be my specialty.
I was good in a living room.

1427
02:08:03,139 --> 02:08:04,766
I'd do it alone.

1428
02:08:05,558 --> 02:08:07,560
And now, I just...

1429
02:08:13,608 --> 02:08:15,068
I don't know.

1430
02:08:20,573 --> 02:08:22,368
But tonight...

1431
02:08:23,285 --> 02:08:28,624
...our little project, our company
had a very big night.

1432
02:08:29,125 --> 02:08:33,421
A very, very big night.

1433
02:08:36,382 --> 02:08:38,426
But it wasn't complete.

1434
02:08:40,928 --> 02:08:46,560
It wasn't nearly close to being
in the same vicinity as complete...

1435
02:08:47,019 --> 02:08:49,688
...because I couldn't
share it with you.

1436
02:08:51,023 --> 02:08:53,066
I couldn't hear your voice...

1437
02:08:55,402 --> 02:08:58,030
...or laugh about it with you.

1438
02:09:00,407 --> 02:09:03,578
I missed my... I missed my wife.

1439
02:09:19,927 --> 02:09:25,142
We live in a cynical world.
A cynical world.

1440
02:09:25,642 --> 02:09:30,356
And we work in a business
of tough competitors.

1441
02:09:40,032 --> 02:09:41,825
I love you.

1442
02:09:42,076 --> 02:09:43,495
You...

1443
02:09:45,205 --> 02:09:47,040
...complete me.

1444
02:09:48,458 --> 02:09:50,543
- And I just...
- Shut up.

1445
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:53,505
Just shut up.

1446
02:09:54,214 --> 02:09:56,424
You had me at "hello."

1447
02:09:57,634 --> 02:09:59,969
You had me at "hello."

1448
02:10:12,566 --> 02:10:15,277
This is my best discussion group.

1449
02:10:15,486 --> 02:10:20,199
Your father leaves home on
Christmas Eve, abandoning your family.

1450
02:10:20,408 --> 02:10:24,871
Your mother had to sweep up
at the prison to pay your tuition.

1451
02:10:25,288 --> 02:10:28,667
Your brother lost a leg
in a fishing accident.

1452
02:10:28,875 --> 02:10:32,963
You've had a list of horrific
things happen in your life.

1453
02:10:33,171 --> 02:10:36,842
- I'm not gonna cry, Roy.
- I've got some good news.

1454
02:10:37,050 --> 02:10:39,928
I've just been handed a signed memo.

1455
02:10:40,137 --> 02:10:44,350
It's a contract.
Arizona Cardinals. Four years.

1456
02:10:44,559 --> 02:10:49,689
$11.2 million and you'll play
in your home state, where it started.

1457
02:10:49,897 --> 02:10:51,858
What do you think of that?

1458
02:11:11,962 --> 02:11:16,592
I love everybody.
I love my wife! Marcee!

1459
02:11:17,843 --> 02:11:21,930
I love my kids!
Tyson and my new baby, Katie.

1460
02:11:22,139 --> 02:11:27,270
My older brother, who got one leg,
and my younger brother, Tee Pee.

1461
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:31,232
You're militant, but I ain't
mad at you. I love you.

1462
02:11:31,441 --> 02:11:34,569
I love my teammates.
I'm omitting someone.

1463
02:11:34,819 --> 02:11:40,075
- We only have a half-hour show.
- I send love to my offensive line.

1464
02:11:41,076 --> 02:11:45,289
Nice to see you. Congratulations.
Good for you.

1465
02:11:45,956 --> 02:11:50,086
- You remember Troy from the Super Bowl?
- We met in '93.

1466
02:11:50,336 --> 02:11:53,881
- That's right. I enjoyed your memo.
- Thank you.

1467
02:11:54,215 --> 02:11:59,220
- A little slow but you come around.
- We're out of time.

1468
02:11:59,428 --> 02:12:01,347
I'm forgetting somebody.

1469
02:12:03,057 --> 02:12:05,102
Jerry Maguire...

1470
02:12:05,811 --> 02:12:07,604
...my agent.

1471
02:12:10,774 --> 02:12:13,860
You are my ambassador of kwan, man.

1472
02:12:15,404 --> 02:12:19,491
Thank you. Congratulations.
We'll be right back.

1473
02:12:23,328 --> 02:12:27,834
- How did you like the zoo, buddy?
- It was great!

1474
02:12:28,042 --> 02:12:30,128
One, two, three.

1475
02:12:33,631 --> 02:12:35,842
Hey, kid, throw the ball.

1476
02:12:45,978 --> 02:12:47,312
Good throw, man.

1477
02:12:50,357 --> 02:12:52,026
Did you see?

1478
02:12:52,693 --> 02:12:55,362
Oh, no. Let's go.

1479
02:12:55,779 --> 02:13:00,784
What? I'm not saying we'll throw him
into the major leagues tomorrow...

1480
02:13:00,993 --> 02:13:03,787
...but he's got natural talent.

1481
02:13:03,996 --> 02:13:08,501
I know the right people
that'll help develop his talent.

1482
02:13:21,514 --> 02:13:24,560
Hey, I don't have all the answers.

1483
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:30,232
In life, to be honest, I've failed
as much as I've succeeded.

1484
02:13:30,566 --> 02:13:34,111
But I love my wife,
I love my life...

1485
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:37,156
...and I wish you my kind of success.
