00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:58,938
Did you check this?
You have to check it.

186
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:00,338
You want me
to clean that out'?

187
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:02,706
Not unless you want
to sketch the tornadoes.

188
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:04,210
Hey, welcome back, huh?

189
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,644
I'm not back.

191
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,281
So you want the papers?

192
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:12,808
I did drive all the way
out here for them.

193
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,377
They're signed
and ready.

194
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:16,081
Good. Good.
Let's see them.

195
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:17,715
Do you need them
right this second?

196
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,986
It'd be nice.

Yeah.

Is it Melinda?

203
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,036
Melissa.

204
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,876
Wasn't there a Melinda
in there somewhere?

205
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,610
No, there's only been
Melissa since you.

206
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:44,652
Boy, not much
for browsing, are you?

207
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,311
No, I guess I'm not.

00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:50,924
There you go.

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,152

it was in December.

so we can get out of here?

00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:36,032
Yes, she's here.
She's over with Dusty.

Now would you please
sign the document?

You left her with Dusty?

00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:42,743

It's the point...

235
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,119
basically,

236
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:57,123
at which the twister

That's not the technical term
for it obviously,

239
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:01,754

Oh, hello.
Nice to meet you.

242
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,734
Bill just told me
the happy news.

243
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:07,699
Which?

244
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:08,735
Us. Marriage.

245
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,701
Jo, Melissa.

246
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,999
It's happy news.

247
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,939
I guess it probably
seems kind of sudden.

248
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:15,168
Seems sudden?

249
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,178
Dude, you taking the vows?
That's sweet.

250
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:20,714
Well, we--we just
wanted to get it done

251
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,249
before Billy started
his new job.

252
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:23,079
That's right.
Right, right, right. Weatherman.

253
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,083
- What?
- What?

254
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,244
Say it.

255
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:27,788
I said weatherman.
I think it's great.

256
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:29,379
You had that tone.

257
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:30,856
There was no tone. If you have
a problem being a weatherman--

258
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:33,792
I don't have a problem
being a weatherman.

Very nice
to meet you.

You, too. Billy.

267
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,262
What? No.

268
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,240
Uh-huh.

269
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,365
New truck?

270
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:51,537
That's right.

new wife.

It's like
a whole new you.

275
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,720
This is very awkward.

276
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:02,255
I know. Tell me about it.

277
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:03,881
I thought you'd be
coming out here alone.

278
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:05,857
I wasn't expecting
on coming out here at all.

279
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,326
You said you'd meet me--

280
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:08,828
It's about Dorothy.

281
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:11,330
Dorothy? What about her?

282
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:13,867
She's here.

283
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,732
Show me.

284
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:33,444
I can't believe
you did it.

285
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,455
We built four of them.

286
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:36,819
Does she work?

287
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:52,730
Thought you'd want to be here
for her first time out.

288
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:55,935
It wouldn't be right
if you weren't here.

289
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:58,945
Whoo-hoo! This is
going to be good.

Ooh, The Extreme.
It came from his brain.

294
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:06,809
Ohh, The Extreme.
It came from his brain.

295
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,546
I had a hand in it.

296
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,716
Wow, it is great.

297
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,225
What is it?

298
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:16,228
It's an instrument pack
for studying tornadoes.

299
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,230
The first one in history.

300
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,526
It's very exciting.

301
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:21,965
Scientists have been studying
tornadoes forever,

302
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:24,970
but still nobody knows
how a tornado works.

303
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:26,869
We've no idea what
is going on inside

304
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:28,339
because nobody's
ever been able

305
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:31,240
to take scientific measurements
from inside the funnel.

306
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:33,370
That's what she's
going to do.

307
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,538
How?

308
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:37,515
We put her up
inside a tornado.

309
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,245
She opens...

310
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:44,886
and releases hundreds
of these sensors

311
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:47,927
that measure all parts of
the tornado simultaneously.

312
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,428
You see, Melissa,
it's like this.

313
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:52,931
These sensors
go up the funnel

314
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:55,968
and radio back information
about the internal structure,

315
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:59,335
wind velocities,
flow, asymmetries.

316
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:00,372
We can learn more
in 30 seconds

317
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:02,339
than they have in
the past 30 years,

318
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:03,899
get a profile of a tornado
for the first time.

319
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,603
And what will that do?

320
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,578
If we knew how
a tornado really worked,

321
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:10,081
we could design
an advance warning system.

322
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:11,640
Aren't there already
tornado warnings?

323
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:12,810
Well--

324
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:13,978
They're not good enough.

325
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,282
They're nowhere near
good enough.

326
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:16,788
Right now,
it's three minutes.

327
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,791
If we can get
this new information,

328
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:20,292
we can increase warning time
to 15 minutes.

329
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:22,487
Give people a chance
to get to safety.

330
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,997
At least, that's what
these guys are trying to do.

331
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,499
- Whoo-hoo!
- That's right!

332
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:28,932
Oh, yeah!

333
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:33,338
I can't believe
you actually did it.

334
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:34,873
Well, we did it.

335
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:36,374
All right.

336
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:38,877
How do you get it
in the tornado?

337
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:41,880
You got to get
in front of the tornado

338
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:43,882
and put it
in the damage path

339
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,611
and then get out again
before it picks you up, too.

340
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:47,118
It's the suck zone.

341
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,711
Oh.

342
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,187
Excellent!

00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:03,001

00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,604
They can handle this.

360
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,333
They know what
they're doing.

361
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:41,669
This is what they do.

362
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,174
They--They live for this.

363
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:44,175
Uh-huh.

00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:46,143

[Ring]

545
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,139
Dr. Melissa Reeves here.

546
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:10,266
Oh.

547
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:11,309
Oh.

548
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:13,174
Oh, hello, Donald.

549
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:15,578
<i>Yes, you got me in my car.</i>

550
00:26:15,636 --> 00:26:20,642

This feeling of inadequacy

00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,528
Julia doesn't resent you.

555
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:32,996
We've talked about this before.

556
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:35,431
She did not marry your penis.

557
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:36,661
Oh, O.K.

558
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:39,830
She didn't only
marry your penis.

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,038
So...

563
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:50,139
Amazing coloring
there, isn't it?

564
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:52,081
Yeah, look at those mammatus.

565
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:55,052
Bet those tops have got
to be spiking above 40,000.

566
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:56,554
That's a good thing.

567
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,714
That's a very good thing.

568
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,857
She work at the station?
Is that where you met her?

569
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,361
Jo, I don't want to fight.

570
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,328
I'm not fighting.
I'm talking.

571
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:07,388
I don't want to fight.

572
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:09,960
She's nice.

573
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:11,128
Hag

574
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:12,636
Uh-oh.
She's not nice?

575
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:14,138
I know what
you meant.

576
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:15,332
You do?

577
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,376
Yes, so don't do this.

578
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,411
O.K. I'm making
extremely civilized conversation.

579
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,377
You're biting my head off.

580
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:23,473
Jesus.

581
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:26,347
Yes, she's very nice.

582
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:29,684
No, she does not
work at the station.

583
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:30,813
She's a...

584
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:34,722
She's a therapist.

585
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:39,921
Oh.

586
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:43,501
Yours?

587
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:45,332
Christ! You couldn't
resist, could you?

588
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:47,338
What? I'm not saying
you need therapy.

589
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:48,839
- What?
- I'm not.

590
00:27:48,896 --> 00:27:49,874
I need therapy?

591
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,840
I didn't say that.

592
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:51,968
I need a therapist?

593
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:53,534
What could I possibly need
a therapist for?

594
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:55,478
You're the doctor.
Tell me.

595
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:57,846
I don't know...

596
00:27:57,905 --> 00:27:59,748
An inability
to finish things.

597
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:00,877
I don't finish things?

598
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,784
Rushing into things you
can't quite commit to.

599
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:04,015
Commitment?

600
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:05,819
You asked me.
You asked me.

601
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:07,790
No, that is bullshit.

602
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,293
Look, I may have walked out,

603
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,330
but at least I showed up
in the first place.

604
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,296
O.K., there's
a whole road thing goi--

605
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:15,334
You never had
the slightest idea about commitment,

606
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:16,800
what being
married means,

607
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:18,803
like stability,
supportiveness, the house,

608
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:21,806
and all kinds
of neat stuff like that.

609
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:22,806
- Can I drive?
- No!

610
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:24,399
Then would you?

611
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:25,842
Whoa!

612
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:29,446
Damn.

613
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:34,817
Somebody should warn her
about your temper.

614
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:36,319
Jo, I swear
if you don't--

615
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:38,219
She obviously has no idea
what she's getting herself into.

616
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:39,313
Stay the hell out of it.

617
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:40,824
I know exactly what
I'm doing.

618
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,858
What am I doing?

619
00:28:41,915 --> 00:28:43,917
I think they're
getting better at this.

620
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:47,294
You know what?
As long as you're happy...

621
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:48,264
Thank you.

622
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:49,823
I am happy-

623
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:51,766
I'm a happy person.

624
00:28:51,825 --> 00:28:53,327
I'm happy with my life.

625
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,839
I'm happy with the way
things are going in my life.

626
00:28:55,895 --> 00:28:57,374
I'm happy
with--with--with--

627
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,374
Melissa.

628
00:28:58,431 --> 00:28:59,842
I know her name.

629
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,879
Yes, I'm happy
with Melissa.

630
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:02,845
O.K. You look happy.

631
00:29:02,902 --> 00:29:03,778
I am,

632
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:06,347
Shit! Shit!

633
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:12,787
Hey, are you guys going to
wrap this up pretty soon?

634
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:13,881
What?

635
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:15,290
Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering

636
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:16,793
if we were going to
chase this tornado,

637
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,558
or if you just want
to catch the next one.

638
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:20,620
Shit!

639
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:22,598
Beltzer, is it
on the ground?

640
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:23,793
I got it!
I got it!

641
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:25,894
Easy, easy, easy.

642
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:40,310
We have to bear right.
It's on an easterly course.

643
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:43,752
The national weather service
has issued a tornado warning,

644
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,414
effective until 11 a.m.,
for north and western...

645
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:46,855
Uh, Dr. Miller.

646
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:47,823
Yes?

647
00:29:47,881 --> 00:29:50,361
I think they turned left here.

648
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:51,418
Do it.

649
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,863
We're moving
to intercept, guys.

650
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:00,268
Get ready to set up.

651
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:01,930
You got it.

652
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,843
You've got to get
further ahead of it.

653
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:13,384
I know
what I'm doing.

654
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,783
Cut across
the field, Bill.

655
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:16,013
I know I have to
get ahead of it.

656
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,281
You're going to have to
get into that field.

657
00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:18,845
- Do you want to drive?
- I'm just saying--

658
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:20,016
Would you like to drive?

659
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,353
Yes, I'd love to.

660
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:23,519
Listen, it's about
3 miles southeast.

661
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,960
Let's see what she does.

662
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:30,833
Go in there!
Go in there!

663
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,800
Just wait.

664
00:30:31,858 --> 00:30:32,802
You're going to miss it.

665
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:34,668
Just hold on a second.

666
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:36,502
Have you lost your nerve?

667
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:40,468
Tighten your seat belt.

668
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:46,883
Bill, Jo, where are you?

669
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,647
We lost visual.

670
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,321
Are we having fun yet?

671
00:30:57,383 --> 00:30:59,124
We got to get out of this.

672
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:00,323
Really?

673
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:05,359
2 miles now.
Picking up speed.

674
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:07,871
Bill, sometime this week
would be good.

675
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:10,737
I'm trying to get it out.

676
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:12,242
Are you mad?

677
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:13,572
I'll be mad later.

678
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,579
Right now I'm trying
not to kill us.

679
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:17,706
Funnel getting thicker.
It's moving fast.

680
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,477
Corning towards you, Jo.

681
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,047
It's starting to turn.

682
00:31:27,113 --> 00:31:28,148
Where? I can't see.

683
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:29,158
You will.

684
00:31:29,215 --> 00:31:30,660
Jo, you're too close!

685
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:33,061
It's not going to work!
Get out of there!

686
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,154
Oh, shit!

687
00:31:36,456 --> 00:31:39,096
I can't get out.
It's too steep.

688
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:41,434
This was a great idea.

689
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:54,378
See? That wasn't so bad.

690
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,420
Let's get her out!
Let's go!

691
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:58,979
Why can't we spend
a normal day together?

692
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:04,855
We're right in
the damage path!

693
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,363
Jo, this is crazy!

694
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:07,363
Let me go!

695
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,831
There's no time!

696
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:10,333
We can still do this!

697
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,960
Come on! Come on!

698
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,842
Find something
to grab ahold of!

699
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:20,206
I know!

700
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:32,856
What are you doing?

701
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:35,392
I want to see it!
I want to see it!

702
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,155
I want to see it!

703
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,957
Bill!

704
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:54,473
Look out! Look out!

705
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:31,780
Oh, my God.

706
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,941
It's gone.

707
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:36,943
It's gone.

708
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:40,113
Where's my truck?

709
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:43,825
Aah!

710
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:47,354
- There it is.
- Melissa?

711
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,629
Oh, God!

712
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,135
Are you O.K.?

713
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,535
Melissa! Melissa!

714
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:56,073
Are you O.K.?

715
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:57,039
Aah!

716
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:59,042
You--You just
missed that truck!

717
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:00,133
That's awesome!

718
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,269
That's awesome!

719
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,278
[Laughing]

720
00:34:02,335 --> 00:34:03,279
Melissa!

721
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,212
On, Billy!

722
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,180
Billy!

723
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:06,683
Are you O.K.?

724
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:08,184
Oh, God. I'm O.K.

725

"Have a drink."

into the twister,

was a strong F-2,
F-3 maybe.

1063

some F-4s today.

1083
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:13,465
Is that so much to ask?

1084
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:19,471
I don't know.

1085
00:51:20,471 --> 00:51:22,382
Bill always went
his own way,

1086
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,978
which was usually the same way
you were going.

1087
00:51:26,978 --> 00:51:29,549
Seems like a long time ago.

1088
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:32,583
Not so long, Jo.

1089
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:36,931
He's here, isn't he?

[Wind Mobiles Chiming]

1091
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,461
That is so beautiful.

1092
00:51:43,528 --> 00:51:45,667
We have a serious
weather situation...

1093
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,903
We got one, baby!

1094
00:51:47,965 --> 00:51:51,412
F-3! Mile outside of Parlaine!

1095
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:54,416
This is for Garfield County
including the city of Enid.

1096
00:51:54,472 --> 00:51:56,418
This is a storm
that has developed

1097

15 minutes.

a very intense storm.

You ride along with Dusty, O.K.?
Is that cool?

1101
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:07,360
- What's the word from SELS?
- The word is big.

1102
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:08,863
All right, let's go, people!

1103
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,399
We know where Jonas is?

1104
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:11,899
Yeah, he's still in Milston.

1105

More than 30 miles from it.

1106
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:13,867
Can we beat him?

1107
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:14,869
I'm working on it.

Hang on.

00:52:48,726 --> 00:52:49,966
Let's go right
through Wakita.

We're going to take a walk
in the woods.

spends his life

O.K., Bill, turn left here
toward that farm.

1148
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:49,647
You sure about that?

right in front of you?

- Beyond what?
- "Beyond what"?

Oh, urn, it's the highway.
It's the highway.

Where's the road, Rabbit?

Yeah, where's the road, man?

get somebody killed?

Oh, really, Jonas?
It was so nice of you

1171
00:55:41,465 --> 00:55:45,174
to stop back there
and make sure we were all right.

1172
00:55:45,236 --> 00:55:47,182
It was very considerate
to see 10 people

1173
00:55:47,238 --> 00:55:49,115
on the side of the road
and not stop!

1174
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:50,151

We're going to have to
get off of this road.

This is no time to guess.

1178

a right turn. Trust me.

Looks like it's
coming down Route 33.

35 miles an hour.

00:56:57,441 --> 00:56:58,818
I cannot see this.

- Where, where, where?
- Direction, Rabbit.

No, but I can...

I got it, Billy.

1214
00:57:27,771 --> 00:57:29,648
It's the best motion
we've ever seen.

1215
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:32,187
It's like the base
of this fatty's

1216
00:57:32,243 --> 00:57:33,984
over a half a mile wide.

[Bill]
Rabbit.

1218
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:36,615
If you're going
east on 7,

1219
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,320
it should be coming over that hill
in a matter of minutes.

1220
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:41,318
[Sanders]
This is the one, man. I feel it.

[Sanders] This is the one man.
I feel it.

1222
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:43,022
It's got to be there.

1223
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:45,795
Maybe it stalled.

1224
00:57:45,856 --> 00:57:48,393
No, I think Rabbit's right.

1225
00:57:48,459 --> 00:57:53,101
It's going to show its ugly face
right over that hill.

to go for it, Jo?

I'm checking it.
She's almost up.

This is it.

1241
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:49,729

right towards the core.

He's not talking
about Billy, is he?

He's not talking
about Billy, is he?

Are you O.K.?

Nice and slow.

1613
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,604
O.K.

1614
01:21:51,665 --> 01:21:52,905
O.K.

1615
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:04,418
Bill!

1616
01:22:04,478 --> 01:22:05,786
Grab Mose for me.

1617
01:22:05,846 --> 01:22:08,122
I think he's
a little shaken up.

1618
01:22:08,182 --> 01:22:10,423
Don't worry.
I'll get him.

1619
01:22:10,484 --> 01:22:11,519
Mose!

1620
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,296
Is she O.K.?

1621
01:22:16,357 --> 01:22:18,667
We'll probably keep her
overnight just to be safe.

1622
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:20,706
Overnight? Forget it.
I'm all right.

1623
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:22,365
You're going
to the hospital.

1624
01:22:22,429 --> 01:22:25,535
O.K., I'll go,
but I'm going to drive myself.

1625
01:22:25,599 --> 01:22:29,012
Honey, your car's in a tree
around the corner.

1626
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,174
Ohh!

1627
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:32,740
It's O.K.

1628
01:22:32,806 --> 01:22:35,047
It's O.K.

1629
01:22:38,512 --> 01:22:40,389
Whoa!

1630
01:22:40,447 --> 01:22:41,755
Oh!

1631
01:22:46,153 --> 01:22:47,860
The F-4 that hit Wakita

1632
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,832
has now moved on
to the northeast.

1633
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,369
I've just gotten word in

1634
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,802
that an even stronger tornado

1635
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:55,841
has now started to form
25 miles south of Wakita

1636
01:22:55,896 --> 01:22:57,637
right where
the two storm systems

1637
01:22:57,698 --> 01:22:59,371
have finally met
and combined forces.

1638
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:02,175
The weather service is saying
that this is highly unusual,

1639
01:23:02,236 --> 01:23:05,149
and they are saying that this
latest funnel, this latest tornado

1640
01:23:05,205 --> 01:23:07,048
could be the strongest
F-5 tornado

1641
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,849
that this state has seen
in more than 30 years.

1642
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,116
Let's break it down, folks.

1643
01:23:11,178 --> 01:23:13,522
We're talking winds
in excess of 300 mph.

1644
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,524
Hey, what are you doing?

1645
01:23:14,581 --> 01:23:16,527
I want to see how you are.

1646
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:17,323
- All right.
- How is she?

1647
01:23:17,384 --> 01:23:19,523
I was worried about you.

1648
01:23:22,256 --> 01:23:23,462
Look at this.

1649
01:23:23,524 --> 01:23:24,832
It's nothing.

1650
01:23:26,326 --> 01:23:29,239
He says I have
a bump on the head

1651
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,469
and maybe
a broken wrist.

1652
01:23:31,532 --> 01:23:33,011
Let me see that.

1653
01:23:33,067 --> 01:23:34,341
There's nothing to see.

1654
01:23:34,401 --> 01:23:36,074
See? It doesn't even hurt.

1655
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:39,478
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1656
01:23:40,741 --> 01:23:42,311
Stop blaming yourself.

1657
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:45,050
You got me out of the house.

1658
01:23:46,113 --> 01:23:47,888
Jo, it's got to stop.

1659
01:23:47,948 --> 01:23:49,757
I didn't have any warning.

1660
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:53,230
The sirens went off
a few seconds before it hit.

1661
01:23:53,287 --> 01:23:55,494
I didn't even get downstairs.

1662
01:23:55,556 --> 01:23:56,967
Jo.

1663
01:23:57,024 --> 01:23:59,527
I'm sorry. Uh...

1664
01:23:59,593 --> 01:24:01,573
I was listening to the radio,

1665
01:24:01,628 --> 01:24:05,940
and I don't even know if you want
to know, but it's happening.

1666
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,980
NSSL's predicting an F-5.

1667
01:24:10,204 --> 01:24:12,514
Jo...

1668
01:24:12,573 --> 01:24:15,554
it's going to happen
to somebody else.

1669
01:24:15,609 --> 01:24:19,056
You...You go stop it.

1670
01:24:19,113 --> 01:24:21,593
I don't know how.

1671
01:24:21,648 --> 01:24:24,151
Well, I think you do.

1672
01:24:24,218 --> 01:24:26,528
You've been chasing these things

1673
01:24:26,587 --> 01:24:29,295
since you were a little kid.

1674
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:30,858
It's what you do.

1675
01:24:30,924 --> 01:24:32,699
Go. Do it.

1676
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,213
And let's see here.

1677
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:54,384
NSSL severe storm staff
now confirms...

1678
01:24:54,448 --> 01:24:55,688
You all right?

1679
01:24:55,749 --> 01:24:58,025
I thought you were
going to go

1680
01:24:58,085 --> 01:25:00,497
to the hospital with Meg.

1681
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:03,963
Jo?

1682
01:25:04,024 --> 01:25:06,470
What is it?

1683
01:25:06,527 --> 01:25:08,632
It's been an absolutely
incredible day.

1684
01:25:08,695 --> 01:25:10,936
We know Wakita
has just been leveled.

1685
01:25:10,998 --> 01:25:12,671
What is it?

1686
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:15,373
I know how to make Dorothy fly.

1687
01:25:15,435 --> 01:25:17,711
Uh, it's just
an unparalleled display

1688
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:19,717
of the savage power
of nature.

1689
01:25:19,773 --> 01:25:21,719
There's going
to be more tornadoes.

1690
01:25:21,775 --> 01:25:23,808
Let me just say to you,

1691
01:25:23,809 --> 01:25:23,843
Let me just say to yo",

1692
01:25:23,942 --> 01:25:26,650
if you're in the path
of any of these storms,

1693
01:25:26,711 --> 01:25:27,781
just stay alert,

1694
01:25:27,846 --> 01:25:30,156
and news 89
will keep you advised.

1695
01:25:30,215 --> 01:25:32,752
Of course.

1696
01:25:32,818 --> 01:25:34,559
Of course.

1697
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:37,031
I need every aluminum can
you can find.

1698
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:38,795
We need cutters
and duct tape.

1699
01:25:38,857 --> 01:25:41,394
Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get
the last Dorothy

1700
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:43,063
on the back of my truck,

1701
01:25:43,128 --> 01:25:46,109
and I want to get them
both on there right now.

1702
01:25:46,164 --> 01:25:47,802
We're gone.

1703
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:53,871
Dusty, you ready for us?

1704
01:26:53,932 --> 01:26:56,139
Yeah, yeah. We're good.

1705
01:26:57,836 --> 01:26:59,440
- We're good?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1706
01:26:59,504 --> 01:27:01,211
We're good.
We're very good.

1707
01:27:08,413 --> 01:27:09,687
Let's go. Come on!

1708
01:27:09,748 --> 01:27:11,591
Did you get them done?

1709
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,391
I think so.

1710
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:14,725
Beautiful!

1711
01:27:17,522 --> 01:27:19,559
O.K., O.K.

1712
01:27:28,533 --> 01:27:29,603
Good?

1713
01:27:29,668 --> 01:27:31,272
Yeah.
Great job, you guys.

1714
01:27:31,336 --> 01:27:32,940
- Just be ready to record.
- Right.

1715
01:27:33,004 --> 01:27:34,244
Be careful, all right?

1716
01:27:34,306 --> 01:27:35,614
Don't follow too close.

1717
01:27:35,674 --> 01:27:37,620
All right.
You got it, boss.

1718
01:27:37,676 --> 01:27:38,677
O.K.

1719
01:27:43,515 --> 01:27:45,188
We're back in business.

1720
01:27:49,754 --> 01:27:51,290
Come on, let's go.

1721
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:56,329
[Jo]
Half a mile more?

1722
01:27:56,394 --> 01:27:57,839
[Bill]
Sounds right.

1723
01:27:57,896 --> 01:28:01,503
I figure--put her right
in the middle of the road.

1724
01:28:01,566 --> 01:28:03,842
Unless you think
somebody will hit it.

1725
01:28:03,902 --> 01:28:07,213
Nobody will be there.

1726
01:28:18,249 --> 01:28:21,355
Hurry!
Let's go! Come on!

1727
01:28:27,459 --> 01:28:28,733
[Beep Beep Beep]

1728
01:28:28,793 --> 01:28:31,137
O.K., that's good!

1729
01:28:32,097 --> 01:28:33,235
You got it?

1730
01:28:33,298 --> 01:28:34,709
Let's go!

1731
01:28:37,802 --> 01:28:40,783
Dusty, you in position?

1732
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:43,376
Yeah, we're prime.
Ready for contact.

1733
01:28:43,441 --> 01:28:45,250
[Tires Screech]

1734
01:28:51,549 --> 01:28:53,051
This is it.

1735
01:28:53,118 --> 01:28:54,495
It's going to work.

1736
01:28:56,554 --> 01:28:58,056
Just another minute,
Dusty.

1737
01:28:58,123 --> 01:29:00,069
We're ready for it!

1738
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:18,712
Come on, come on, take her!

1739
01:29:18,777 --> 01:29:20,688
- It's too light.
- No, it's not.

1740
01:29:24,849 --> 01:29:25,793
We're losing it.

1741
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:28,194
No, we're not.
She can still fly.

1742
01:29:38,863 --> 01:29:39,967
Get in!

1743
01:29:40,031 --> 01:29:41,704
Let's go!

1744
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:51,778
[Tires Screech]

1745
01:29:51,843 --> 01:29:53,151
[Bill]
My God.

1746
01:29:53,211 --> 01:29:54,519
[Jo]
Oh, my God.

1747
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:55,523
Come on!

1748
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:57,059
Get us off this thing!

1749
01:29:57,115 --> 01:29:58,059
Come on!

1750
01:29:58,116 --> 01:29:59,322
Bill, punch it!

1751
01:29:59,384 --> 01:30:00,727
- She's stuck!
- Bill!

1752
01:30:01,786 --> 01:30:03,094
Bill, go right now!

1753
01:30:03,154 --> 01:30:05,225
Hurry!

1754
01:30:11,229 --> 01:30:12,572
What is that?

1755
01:30:20,205 --> 01:30:21,980
What is that?

1756
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,417
Bill, hurry.

1757
01:30:23,475 --> 01:30:25,921
Hurry! Hurry!

1758
01:30:27,812 --> 01:30:29,814
This is not good.

1759
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:39,867
Hurry!

1760
01:30:42,694 --> 01:30:44,037
Hold on!

1761
01:30:53,505 --> 01:30:54,813
Let's go!

1762
01:31:17,595 --> 01:31:20,007
Son of a bitch.

1763
01:31:20,165 --> 01:31:22,145
Jo, Bill,
are you all right?

1764
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,840
Hey, can you guys hear me'?
You O.K.'?

1765
01:31:24,903 --> 01:31:26,246
We're O.K.

1766
01:31:26,304 --> 01:31:29,046
Jo, Bill, did you see
that explosion?

1767
01:31:30,909 --> 01:31:32,217
We saw it.

1768
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,586
This monster's still moving
northeast on 80.

1769
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:39,685
You copy?

1770
01:31:39,751 --> 01:31:41,389
This is it.

1771
01:31:41,452 --> 01:31:42,863
Last one.

1772
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:45,262
Last time.

1773
01:31:46,324 --> 01:31:47,894
Mobile lab to mobile one,

1774
01:31:47,959 --> 01:31:49,666
Groundspeed is increasing.

1775
01:31:49,727 --> 01:31:52,401
The base must be
at least a mile wide.

1776
01:31:52,463 --> 01:31:53,942
We can't see it anymore.

1777
01:31:53,998 --> 01:31:55,238
What is your location?

1778
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:58,474
We're right alongside her.
She's beautiful.

1779
01:31:58,536 --> 01:32:00,447
All right, we're
getting ready to play,

1780
01:32:00,505 --> 01:32:02,883
So pull back
and prepare to monitor.

1781
01:32:07,011 --> 01:32:08,718
They had to be there
somewhere.

O.K., path is stable.

Men, this is it.

1785
01:32:13,284 --> 01:32:14,854
This is the one.

1786
01:32:14,919 --> 01:32:16,728
Stay sharp back there.

1787
01:32:16,788 --> 01:32:19,064
They have position.

1788
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:22,904
They could make it.

1789
01:32:24,128 --> 01:32:26,802
Not unless
they anchor the pack.

The pack is too light.

and if she does,

right at you.
