00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,710
if you're not gonna
turn it on?

184
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,547
It was turned on.
I was ignoring you.

185
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:36,712
Hello.
What's the, uh...

186
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:38,220
What's
the big emergency?

187
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,722
It started this morning.

188
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,724
Every station's making
like it's the 1950s.

189
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,726
We got static.
We got snow.

190
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,056
All kinds
of distortions.

191
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:46,391
- Nobody knows--
- Marty--

192
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,522
What the hell
are you doing?

193
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:48,564
There's a reason

194
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,725
we have bins
labeled " recycle."

195
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,233
What the hell
is going on?

196
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,234
My God in heaven.

197
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,238
So sue me. David!
We got a problem.

198
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,740
Did you try to switch
transponder channels?

199
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:59,742
Oh, please.
You think I'd be this panicked

200
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,243
if it was something simple?

201
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,644
OK. Let's point the dish
at another satellite.

202
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,478
We tried that.
It didn't work.

203
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,848
It's almost as though
they weren't even there.

204
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:11,649
All right. All right.
What've we got here?

205
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:17,827
This is impossible.

206
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,830
TV: We created
a race of robots.

207
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:21,830
Their function...

208
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,924
Miguel, the signal's
all screwed up.

209
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,627
Stop it.
Just leave it alone.

210
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,364
You're gonna break it,
all right?

211
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:28,666
It's so fuzzy.

212
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,411
[Horn Honks]

213
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,877
[Horn Honks]

214
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh, no.

215
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,784
Good morning, Lucas.

216
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,288
You see these?

217
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,825
I got a whole god damn
crop full of these.

218
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,827
If your father's
not in the air

219
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,294
in 20 minutes...

220
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:54,126
I'm getting
someone else.

221
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,034
Hey!

222
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,039
Russell!

223
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:05,871
Hey, Miguel!

224
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:09,413
Ha ha ha ha ha!

225
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:11,141
Whoaaaa!

226
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,183
Whooooo!

227
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:19,085
Yahhhh-hoooo!

228
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,556
Russell!
What are you doing?

229
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,990
Whoo!

230
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:39,640
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

231
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:40,642
Whoa! Ohh!

232
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,076
Oh!

233
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,306
It's the wrong field,
you idiot.

234
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:48,147
Lucas' farm is
on the other side of town.

235
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,222
[Rooster Crows]

236
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,722
Are you sure?

237
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,988
[Speaking Spanish]

238
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,403
[Rumbling]

239
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:34,196
CNS is running a story
that we're covering up

240
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,857
some type of nuclear
testing experiment.

241
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,366
Tell them to run with it

242
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:38,868
if they want to
embarrass themselves.

243
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,870
NASA's been on my butt
all morning.

244
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:42,371
They want to know
our position.

245
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,873
Our official position is

246
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,374
we have no official
position.

247
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,377
Connie,
what is going on here?

248
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,379
Come on, would I keep you
out of the loop?

249
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,005
- Yes, absolutely.
- In a second.

250
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,878
What? I can't hear you.

251
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,281
At the moment,

252
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:55,784
our satellites are
somewhat unreliable.

253
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:56,876
Isn't it possible

254
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,888
that this thing may
just pass us by?

255
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,890
What if it doesn't
"pass us by" ?

256
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,654
Let's retarget some ICBMs
to blow it outta the sky.

257
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,160
And risk turning one
dangerous falling object

258
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,355
into many?

259
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,362
We don't yet know
enough

260
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:08,591
about what
we're dealing with

261
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,600
to make any kind
of intelligent judgments.

262
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,602
Luckily, the press is
making up their own story

263
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:13,728
at this point.

264
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,567
But that's not
gonna keep.

265
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:18,073
We may need to upgrade
to Defcon Three.

266
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,575
Absolutely.
General, contact NORAD.

267
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,645
You tell them we've upgraded
to Defcon Three.

268
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,873
That's not what
the president said.

269
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:24,880
That's a little
premature.

270
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:25,950
I don't think so.

271
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,915
We have more than 50%
of the armed forces

272
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:28,951
out on weekend leave,

273
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,419
not to mention
the commanders and troops

274
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:32,649
that are in town
for the 4th ofJuly parade.

275
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:34,088
Go ahead, Commander.

276
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,250
Our intelligence
tells us

277
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
the object has settled
into a stationary orbit.

278
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:38,027
Well, that's
good news.

279
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:39,323
Uh, not really, sir.

280
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,590
Part of it
has broken off

281
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:41,790
into nearly three
dozen other pieces...

282
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,833
smaller than
the whole, sir,

283
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:47,545
yet over 15 miles
in width themselves.

284
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,754
Where are
they heading?

285
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,257
They should be entering
our atmosphere

286
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,259
within
the next 25 minutes.

287
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,297
Take us to Defcon Three.

288
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:08,506
[Beeping]

289
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:10,303
[Beeping]

290
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,513
Please tell me we're
gettin' somewhere.

291
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,276
Oh, there's good news,
and there's bad news.

292
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,010
All right,
what's the bad news?

293
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:22,642
The bad news is that
you're in meal penalty

294
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:23,811
for disturbing my lunch.

295
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:26,151
And the good news is
you're not gonna charge me.

296
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:28,691
Uh, no. The good news is
that I've found the problem.

297
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,192
It's not our equipment.

298
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:32,285
There's some kinda weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

299
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:33,328
And that's the good news?

300
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:34,830
Yeah, 'cause this signal

301
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:35,990
has a definite
sequential pattern,

302
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,829
so as soon as I find
the exact binary sequence,

303
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,835
then I can calculate
the phase reversal

304
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:40,926
with that analyzer

305
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:42,369
I built you for your
birthday and apply it,

306
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,566
we should be able to
block it out completely.

307
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,609
And then we'll be
the only guys in town

308
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,076
with a clear picture?!

309
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,578
Yes! Yes! Yes!

310
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,908
Oh, David,
that's why I love you!

311
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:51,949
I know.
That's unnecessary.

312
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,983
Oh, yes! Yes!

313
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,017
You're too kind.

314
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,867
[Rumbling]

315
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,707
This better be good.

316
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:26,042
Captain on deck!

317
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:31,853
Sir, we're looking
at a total radar blackout

318
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,354
over a 13 kilometer area.

319
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,855
Let's do a diagnostic
check--

320
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,016
Excuse me, sir.

321
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,524
The radar may be
malfunctioning,

322
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:38,616
but the infrared

323
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,457
is totally
off the map.

324
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:45,492
Jeez.

325
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,098
Get me Atlantic Command
on the line.

326
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:54,875
Hang on, sir.

327
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:56,536
Sir, we have
visual range

328
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,204
with incoming
over Iraqi airspace.

329
00:15:58,314 --> 00:15:59,440
Second sighting?

330
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:02,712
Yes, sir. This just came in
from the Persian Gulf.

331
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:03,911
Correction, sir.

332
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,920
We now have two
confirmed visual contacts.

333
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,284
That's affirmative.
Mr. President.

334
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,790
They're tracking another one
off the California coastline.

335
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:10,790
[Whispers]

336
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:12,793
All right, go ahead.
Put it on.

337
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:14,795
General, you might
want to watch this.

338
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,499
TV: Ladies and gentlemen...

339
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,000
ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,593
we are interrupting
our regular broadcast

341
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:23,262
to bring you
extraordinary events

342
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,364
taking place
in the Russian Republic.

343
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,874
This unexplained disturbance

344
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,136
and the hysteria
that it's causing

345
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:29,336
are incredible.

346
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:30,844
Woman: How
would you describe

347
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:31,879
what you're seeing?

348
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,881
It is clearing
the mountains...

349
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:35,848
moving too slowly

350
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:38,352
to be a comet
or meteor.

351
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:41,890
Widespread panic has
gripped the countryside

352
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:44,357
as thousands have
taken to the streets.

353
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,859
It is confirmed.

354
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,589
The unexplained
phenomenon

355
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,096
is headed
for Moscow.

356
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:50,096
Mr. President,

357
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,598
we have an AWAC
off the West Coast.

358
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:54,966
ETA with contact point:
three minutes.

359
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,971
I don't
understand it, sir.

360
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:57,971
Side radar
doesn't see it.

361
00:16:58,074 --> 00:16:59,974
I know. It's blind, sir.

1079
00:45:17,688 --> 00:45:18,586
OK.

1080
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:20,418
Um...

1081
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:23,891
Let's say that you want to
coordinate with spaceships

1082
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:25,825
on different sides
of the Earth.

1083
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,592
You couldn't send
a direct signal, right?

1084
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,631
You're talking about
line of sight.

1085
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,134
Yeah, that's right.
Exactly.

1086
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:34,898
The curve of the Earth
prevents it.

1087
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:36,302
You'd need satellites
to relay that signal

1088
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:38,375
in order to reach
each ship.

1089
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:40,910
Well, I found a signal

1090
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:44,777

satellite system.

They're starting.

1094
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:55,523
They're using our own
satellites against us...

1095
00:45:59,129 --> 00:46:00,494
and the clock is ticking.

General Grey, coordinate
with the Atlantic Command.

1102
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:27,389
Tell them to evacuate
as many people

1103
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:29,391
out of the cities
as they can.

1104

away from the ship.

It looks like there's some
kind of activity here.

This may be some type
of response, Echo One.

Can't identify it.

another one, sir.

out of there.

do you read?

fast enough.

Where's the picture?

on rice, big daddy.

1324

They ain't got
nothing for us.

01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:23,732

We've got to go.

I can't shake him.

1327

Yes, you can.
Just the way I showed you.

1328
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,269
Check me out. I'm going
to try something.

1329
01:03:29,379 --> 01:03:30,812
Don't do nothing stupid
over there.

1330
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:31,812
You know me.

1331
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:33,382
That's what
I'm talking about.

1332
01:03:33,483 --> 01:03:35,781
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed.

1333
01:03:36,986 --> 01:03:37,884
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

1334

Jimmy! No!

1339
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:55,629
That's affirmative.
We have incoming.

1340
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:56,636
Let me have it, son.

1341
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:58,570
You got it.

1342
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:00,768

1344
01:04:02,245 --> 01:04:03,610

Oh, what are you
shooting at?

1349
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:42,811
Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!

1350

Aw, you can't hit nothing!

Whoa! Low bridge!

1354
01:05:12,982 --> 01:05:14,813
See if you can fly
that thing undercover.

1355
01:05:18,488 --> 01:05:21,321
Ha ha. Hope you got
an air bag.

1356
01:05:23,192 --> 01:05:24,352
Whoa!

1357
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,912

Aah!

1362
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,962
That's right!
That's right!

1363
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,833
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1364
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:10,405
That's what you get!

1365
01:06:10,506 --> 01:06:12,474
Ha ha!
Look at you!

1366
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:14,133
Ship all banged up!

1367
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:15,540
Who's the man?

1368
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:17,237
Huh? Who's the man?

1369
01:06:17,346 --> 01:06:18,779
Wait until I get
another plane!

1370
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:21,372
I'm lining all your friends
up right beside you!

1371
01:06:22,952 --> 01:06:24,249
Where you at, huh?

1372
01:06:24,353 --> 01:06:25,684
Huh? Where you at?

1373
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,625
Welcome to Earth.

1374
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:52,804
Now, that's what I call
a close encounter.

1375
01:06:57,086 --> 01:06:57,984
Baby,
stay right here.

1376
01:06:58,087 --> 01:06:59,645

Yes!

Come on, baby.
Come on.

1381
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:16,205
Come on.

1382
01:07:16,272 --> 01:07:17,239
Yes!

with the exact
same results.

1386
01:07:24,337 --> 01:07:26,805
You're just like your
mother, you know that?

1387
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:29,137
She was stubborn, too.

1388
01:07:29,242 --> 01:07:31,142
Had to twist her arm

1389
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,644
to get her
to take her medicine.

1390
01:07:33,747 --> 01:07:35,772
You're gonna
be all right.

1391
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:36,940
You're gonna be fine.

1392
01:07:39,452 --> 01:07:43,320
See, Troy? You're
feeling better already.

1393
01:07:43,423 --> 01:07:45,823
I couldn't find anything.

1394
01:07:45,926 --> 01:07:47,587
Everyone's packing up.
They're leaving.

1395
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:49,685
They said there's a spaceship
heading this way.

1396
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:51,229
We'd better leave,
too, then.

1397
01:07:51,331 --> 01:07:53,094
[Knocking]

1398
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:54,131
Penicillin.

1399
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:56,031
At least it'll help
keep his fever down.

1400
01:07:56,136 --> 01:07:57,034
Oh, thank you.

1401
01:07:57,137 --> 01:07:59,367
It's really nice
of you to help us.

1402
01:07:59,472 --> 01:08:01,906
I wish I could do more,
but we're moving out.

1403
01:08:02,008 --> 01:08:04,306
I-I'm going with you.

1404
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,080
Um...Well, I--I just--

1405
01:08:09,182 --> 01:08:11,412
I mean, that--that
we're going, too.

1406
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:12,644
Cool.

1407
01:08:12,752 --> 01:08:15,846
Tell that punk to shut
the door. We're outta here.

1408
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:17,389
Go sniff around
somewhere else.

1409
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:18,388
- Bye.
- Bye.

1410
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:25,696
Uhh...

1411
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:29,189
It's Air Force One,
for crying out loud.

1412
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,267
Still he gets sick.

1413
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:32,427
Oh, boy.
I don't feel so good.

1414
01:08:32,537 --> 01:08:34,368
Look at me, huh?
Like a rock.

1415
01:08:34,472 --> 01:08:35,803
Could be bad weather,
could be good weather.

1416
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:36,965
It doesn't matter.

1417
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:38,406
We could go up.
We could go down.

1418
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,273
We can go back.
We can go forward.

1419
01:08:40,378 --> 01:08:41,504
We can go
side to side--

1420
01:08:44,716 --> 01:08:45,614
What'd I say?

1421
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:49,945
He still
gets airsick, huh?

1422
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:51,488
Yeah.

1423
01:08:51,589 --> 01:08:54,820
Julius, with
all of this, I, uh...

1424
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:58,362
I didn't get a chance
to thank you two.

1425
01:08:58,463 --> 01:09:00,693
All he could think of
was getting to you.

1426
01:09:03,568 --> 01:09:05,798
There's still love there,
I think.

1427
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,305
Love was never
our problem.

1428
01:09:10,408 --> 01:09:13,275
" All you need is love."

1429
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:14,436
John Lennon.

1430
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:15,604
Smart man.

1431
01:09:15,714 --> 01:09:17,648
Shot in the back.
Very sad.

1432
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,884
We've moved
as many of our forces

1433
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:22,646
away from our bases
as possible,

1434
01:09:22,754 --> 01:09:25,154
but we've already
sustained heavy losses.

1435
01:09:25,256 --> 01:09:27,156
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

1436
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:29,749
They agree we must launch
a counteroffensive

1437
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,590
with a full
nuclear strike.

1438
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,220
Over American soil?

1439
01:09:33,331 --> 01:09:34,389
You're saying,
at this point,

1440
01:09:34,499 --> 01:09:35,727
we should sacrifice
more innocent

1441
01:09:35,834 --> 01:09:37,734
American civilians?
Is that right?

1442
01:09:37,836 --> 01:09:39,133
Sir, if we don't
strike soon

1443
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:41,102
there may not be much
of an America left to defend.

1444
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:43,174
Sir, they've
taken out NORAD.

1445
01:09:43,274 --> 01:09:44,172
What?

1446
01:09:44,275 --> 01:09:45,299
It's gone, sir.

1447
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,241
My God.

1448
01:09:47,345 --> 01:09:49,813
The vice president,
joint chiefs.

1449
01:09:49,914 --> 01:09:52,382
Mr. President,

1450
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:53,974
we must launch.

1451
01:09:54,085 --> 01:09:55,677
A delay now
would be more costly

1452
01:09:55,787 --> 01:09:58,654
than when you waited
to evacuate the cities.

1453
01:09:58,757 --> 01:10:00,281
No, no. You're not going
to launch nuclear weapons.

1454
01:10:00,391 --> 01:10:02,450
You're going to kill them
and us at the same time.

1455
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,959
If we fire nukes,

1456
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:04,960
then everybody else
is going to fire them.

1457
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:06,030
You are a guest here.

1458
01:10:06,131 --> 01:10:07,029
Ever hear of
nuclear winter?

1459
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:08,929
It's the end of life
as we know it.

1460
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:09,931
Do you hear what
they're talking about?

1461
01:10:10,034 --> 01:10:10,932
Don't even think
about it.

1462
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:12,059
I don't have to go.

1463
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,102
It can't be allowed.

1464
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:14,933
Shut up! Captain,
get him out of here!

1465
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,165
Hey, don't tell him
to shut up!

1466
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:21,541
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David.

1467
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:23,273
None of you did anything
to prevent this.

1468
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:24,678
There was nothing
we could do.

1469
01:10:24,783 --> 01:10:27,115
We were totally
unprepared for this.

1470
01:10:27,218 --> 01:10:28,583
Aw! Don't give me
unprepared.

1471
01:10:28,686 --> 01:10:29,675
Come on,Julius.

1472
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:32,655
It was in the 1950s.
You had that spaceship.

1473
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:34,156
David: Dad.

1474
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:37,023
Julius: Yeah, that thing
that you found in New Mexico.

1475
01:10:37,128 --> 01:10:39,323
Dad, no.
Not the spaceship.

1476
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,692
Roswell.
Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah.

1477
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:43,267
You had the spaceship,
and you had the bodies.

1478
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,426
They were all
locked up in a bunker.

1479
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:45,696
Where was that?

1480
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:48,398
David?
In Area 51, right?

1481
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:49,905
Area 51.

1482
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:51,839
You knew then,
and you did nothing.

1483
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:54,777
Sir, regardless of what

1484
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:58,007
you may have read
in the tabloids,

1485
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:00,175
there have never been
any spacecraft

1486
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:02,116
recovered
by our government.

1487
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,950
Take my word for it,
there's no Area 51.

1488
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:06,990
There's no
recovered spaceship.

1489
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:10,219
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. President?

1490
01:11:10,328 --> 01:11:14,230
That's not
entirely accurate.

1491
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,800
What? Which part?

1492
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:29,410
Hold on, everybody!
Hold on!

1493
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:32,342
Sorry.

1494
01:11:50,033 --> 01:11:51,967
The end hath come!

1495
01:11:52,069 --> 01:11:55,630
He spaketh His word,
and the end hath come!

1496
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:56,637
Hop on!

1497
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,072
We're heading out
to El Toro.

1498
01:11:59,176 --> 01:12:02,873
You cannot defy
what hath come.

1499
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:04,503
It is the end!

1500
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:05,774
[Sobbing]

1501
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:12,314
El Toro?!

1502
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:20,444
Jasmine: Can you
give me a hand?

1503
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:21,604
Yeah, sure.

1504
01:12:29,589 --> 01:12:30,556
Oh, my God.

1505
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:37,457
[Boomer Barks]

1506
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,690
OK, OK. Let's--
Let's get this off.

1507
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:41,426
Here. Let me help you.

1508
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:47,138
She's hurt
pretty badly.

1509
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:55,570
You know, this was supposed
to be my weekend off.

1510
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:57,980
But no.

1511
01:12:58,084 --> 01:13:01,019
You got me out here
dragging your heavy ass

1512
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,644
through
the burning desert,

1513
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:04,154
with your dreadlocks

1514
01:13:04,257 --> 01:13:05,485
sticking out the back
of my parachute.

1515
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:08,492
You've got to come down here
with an attitude,

1516
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:10,653
acting all big and bad.

1517
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:15,962
And what the hell
is that smell?!

1518
01:13:16,069 --> 01:13:17,832
Aah!

1519
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:21,197
I could've been
at a barbecue!

1520
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:24,170
But I ain't mad.

1521
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:26,211
It's all right.

1522
01:13:26,312 --> 01:13:27,802
That is all right.

1523
01:13:43,029 --> 01:13:44,189
Hey!

1524
01:13:44,297 --> 01:13:46,162
Hey!

1525
01:13:46,265 --> 01:13:47,163
Hey!

1526
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:53,671
Hey!

1527
01:14:06,753 --> 01:14:08,914
You need a lift,
soldier?

1528
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:10,387
When I flew overhead,

1529
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,014
I saw a base
not too far from here.

1530
01:14:15,261 --> 01:14:16,250
It ain't on the map.

1531
01:14:16,362 --> 01:14:19,559
Trust me. It's there.

1532
01:14:35,181 --> 01:14:36,375
Ten-hut!

1533
01:14:40,286 --> 01:14:42,550
Mr. President.
General.

1534
01:14:42,655 --> 01:14:44,384
Welcome to Area 51.

1535
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,514
Please follow me.

1536
01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:49,622
We're now 2 4 floors
beneath the surface,

1537
01:14:49,729 --> 01:14:52,562
and here's our main
research facility.

1538
01:14:52,665 --> 01:14:53,654
Let's see it.

1539
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:54,755
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a clean room.

1540
01:14:54,867 --> 01:14:56,129
We have to keep it
static-free.

1541
01:14:56,235 --> 01:14:57,167
If we'll all
go to decontamination--

1542
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,500
Open the door.

1543
01:15:01,474 --> 01:15:02,634
Yes, sir.

1544
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:27,258
My God. Why the hell wasn't
I told about this place?

1545
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:28,924
Two words,
Mr. President:

1546
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:31,902
plausible
deniability.

1547
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:39,969
I don't understand.

1548
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:41,478
Where does all this
come from?

1549
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:43,981
How do you get funding
for something like this?

1550
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,482
You don't actually think

1551
01:15:45,585 --> 01:15:46,882
they spend $20,000
on a hammer,

1552
01:15:46,986 --> 01:15:49,454
$30,000 on a toilet seat,
do you?

1553
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:54,082
Mr. President,
this is Dr. Okun.

1554
01:15:54,193 --> 01:15:55,353
He's been heading up
the research department

1555
01:15:55,461 --> 01:15:57,520
on this project
for the last 15 years.

1556
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:01,266
How do you do.

1557
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:04,165
Mr. President.

1558
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,431
Wow.

1559
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,339
This--
What a pleasure.

1560
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:12,206
As you can imagine,

1561
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:13,972
they don't let us
out much.

1562
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:17,344
I can understand that.

1563
01:16:19,252 --> 01:16:22,153
Well, I guess
you'd like to see

1564
01:16:22,255 --> 01:16:24,246
the big tamale, huh?

1565
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:25,722
Follow me.

1566
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:37,101
[Assistant
Enters Code]

1567
01:17:16,475 --> 01:17:18,875
She's a beaut,
ain't she?

1568
01:17:21,314 --> 01:17:22,303
Dr. Okun: As you can see
from the repairs,

1569
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:24,110
we've been trying
to put her back together

1570
01:17:24,217 --> 01:17:26,617
since the late 1960s.

1571
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:27,777
Don't tell me

1572
01:17:27,887 --> 01:17:28,819
you've had this
for 40 years,

1573
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:29,819
and you don't know
anything about them?

1574
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:31,116
Oh, hell, no. No, no.

1575
01:17:31,224 --> 01:17:33,351
We know tons about them.

1576
01:17:33,459 --> 01:17:35,256
But the neatest stuff--
the neatest stuff

1577
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:39,229
has only happened
in the last few days.

1578
01:17:39,332 --> 01:17:41,664
See, we can't duplicate
their type of power,

1579
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:44,133
so we've never been able
to experiment.

1580
01:17:44,237 --> 01:17:45,602
But since these guys
started showing up,

1581
01:17:45,705 --> 01:17:50,039
all the little gizmos
inside turned on.

1582
01:17:50,142 --> 01:17:53,043
The last 2 4 hours have
been really exciting.

1583
01:17:53,145 --> 01:17:55,511
Exciting?
People are dying out there.

1584
01:17:55,615 --> 01:17:56,980
I don't think " exciting"

1585
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,018
is the word I'd choose
to describe it.

1586
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:02,212
You guys are hoping
to fly this thing, huh?

1587
01:18:02,321 --> 01:18:04,653
You said you can repair
their technology.

1588
01:18:04,757 --> 01:18:06,520
Can you tell us anything
useful about them?

1589
01:18:06,626 --> 01:18:08,116
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1590
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:09,626
Well, I mean,

1591
01:18:09,729 --> 01:18:11,663
they're not all that
dissimilar from us.

1592
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:13,698
Breathes oxygen.

1593
01:18:13,799 --> 01:18:16,063
Comparable tolerances
to heat, cold.

1594
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:17,567
Probably why
they're interested

1595
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:19,865
in our planet.

1596
01:18:19,972 --> 01:18:21,496
Hey.

1597
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:22,505
Hey.

1598
01:18:24,977 --> 01:18:26,239
You guys
want to see them?

1599
01:18:27,647 --> 01:18:29,274
Hmm?

1600
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:40,182
This is--
This is the vault,

1601
01:18:40,293 --> 01:18:43,922
or as some of us have
come to call it,

1602
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:44,962
" The Freak Show."

1603
01:18:45,064 --> 01:18:47,430
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1604
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:48,431
" The--"

1605
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:09,780
When we found them,

1606
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:13,825
they were wearing some sort
of biomechanical suits,

1607
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:14,915
but once we got them off,

1608
01:19:15,027 --> 01:19:17,154
we learned a great deal
about their anatomy.

1609
01:19:17,263 --> 01:19:20,824
Eyes, ears,
no vocal chords.

1610
01:19:20,933 --> 01:19:22,958
We're assuming they
communicate with each other

1611
01:19:23,069 --> 01:19:24,832
through some other means.

1612
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:25,995
You're obviously
not thinking about

1613
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:28,335
hand signals
and body language.

1614
01:19:28,441 --> 01:19:29,339
It's
some kind of

1615
01:19:29,442 --> 01:19:31,273
extrasensory
perception.

1616
01:19:31,377 --> 01:19:32,708
Telepathy.

1617
01:19:34,013 --> 01:19:34,980
So...

1618
01:19:37,183 --> 01:19:39,310
It's an organic life form.

1619
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,312
Can they be killed?

1620
01:19:44,423 --> 01:19:46,084
Their bodies are
just as frail as ours.

1621
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:48,285
These two
died in the crash.

1622
01:19:48,394 --> 01:19:50,726
This one,
a few weeks later.

1623
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:51,854
You just--

1624
01:19:51,964 --> 01:19:53,989
You have to get through
their technology,

1625
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,967
which is,
I'm sorry to say,

1626
01:19:57,069 --> 01:19:58,229
far more advanced.

1627
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:03,099
David, you unlocked
part of that technology.

1628
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:04,233
You cracked the code.

1629
01:20:04,343 --> 01:20:05,275
Oh, no, no.

1630
01:20:05,378 --> 01:20:07,903
All I did was stumble
onto their signal.

1631
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:10,982
I don't know
how helpful I can be.

1632
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:15,110
Why don't you show them
what you've discovered so far,

1633
01:20:15,221 --> 01:20:18,554
figure out what they haven't
thought of yet,

1634
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:20,056
and we'll see

1635
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,356
if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1636
01:20:33,372 --> 01:20:34,771
What code?
