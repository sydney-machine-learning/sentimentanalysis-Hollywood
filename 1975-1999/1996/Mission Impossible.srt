1
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:26,628
It was good ...

2
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:31,758
... that you called us.

3
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:35,387
I don't know what happened.

4
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:39,349
We were at the bar...

5
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:45,105
... drinking, having fun ...

6
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:50,777
I don't even know how I got there.

7
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:55,031
Come on, she's been under too long.

8
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:58,994
You're the only one who can help me.

9
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,084
Come on, come on ...

10
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:11,965
- Tell me what I need to know.
- They'll kill me.

11
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,972
You asked for my help.

12
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:21,891
Come on.

13
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,479
The contact in Minsk ...

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,149
Give us the name.

15
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,529
Dimitri ... Miediev.

16
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:54,007
- What now?
- Now we drink.

17
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:56,217
To friends.

18
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:19,324
Get rid of that scum.

19
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,739
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

20
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,967
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?

21
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:10,644
- Care to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?
- No, I prefer the theatre.

22
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:15,231
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

23
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:18,944
Perhaps you'd choose one for me.

24
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,115
Thank you.

25
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:52,811
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.
This is Alexander Golitsyn, -

26
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:57,941
- an attachÃ© at our embassy
in Prague. He is also a traitor.

27
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:01,486
He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list -

28
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,990
- of all our deep cover agents
in Eastern Europe.

29
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,661
For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.

30
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:13,248
The portion Golitsyn has
contains code names.

31
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:18,878
It is useless without its mate, which
matches the codes with true names.

32
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:25,427
It is this half Golitsyn plans to steal
at an embassy reception tomorrow.

33
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:30,807
Your mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to obtain proof of the theft.

34
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:35,645
Shadow Golitsyn to his buyer
and apprehend them both.

35
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:39,733
I've dispatched a team
selected from your group.

36
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:44,988
Sarah Davies is undercover now. Jack
Harmon can hack into their system.

37
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:50,201
Hannah Williams will do surveillance.
Your wife, Claire, will cover transport.

38
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:54,456
And Ethan Hunt
will be your pointman, as usual.

39
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:59,002
He is now in Kiev and
will rendezvous with you in Prague.

40
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:03,715
Should any member of your IM force
be caught or killed, -

41
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,928
- the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.

42
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:12,682
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.

43
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:37,707
A very straightforward objective.

44
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:42,420
We photograph Golitsyn stealing the
NOC list, follow him to his buyer, -

45
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:47,759
- apprehend both of them.
Now, here's the plot. Ethan ...

46
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:53,223
You go into the embassy in character,
during a party. Hide in plain sight.

47
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:56,768
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

48
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:02,274
Sarah, you're there as the embassy's
Washington visitors' liaison.

49
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,402
You and Ethan will run the game.

50
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:11,241
- I haven't a thing to wear.
- Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

51
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:20,083
Mark Golitsyn and hand him off
to Hannah. Hannah, you stay on him.

52
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:25,588
Jack, fingerprint security is accessed
through the elevator shaft here.

53
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:32,178
- So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.
- Open, close, get out.

54
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:35,682
Claire, you're in the vehicle.

55
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:41,563
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior. You two stay on him.

56
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:45,567
If I call "abort",
everybody walk away immediately.

57
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,904
Regroup here at 4:00 a.m.

58
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:53,491
Any questions?

59
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:59,122
Can we get a cappuccino machine?
I don't know what you call this.

60
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:03,793
- I call it cruel and unusual.
- I made that coffee.

61
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,256
Is it possible that it's worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev?.

62
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:14,554
- Hey, take it easy on my wife's coffee.
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.

63
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:19,309
- Off on a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

64
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,312
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

65
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:27,317
- Punishing! 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

66
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,320
He's getting soft in his old age.

67
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,824
Okay, listen. If that list
gets out into the open, -

68
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:39,996
- the names of our agents will be
up for grabs to the highest bidders.

69
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:47,545
Terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords.
Everyone who wants to get rid of us.

70
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:51,549
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

71
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:59,266
I'll run the whole show from here.
Let's punch out the details.

72
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:05,981
There's a camera built into the bridge.
It transmits what you see back here.

73
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:13,446
Can you hear me?
No, you need an earpiece.

74
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:22,080
You have lovely eyes ...
Can you hear me now?.

75
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,460
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls,
stay with him no matter what.

76
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:34,551
- You should check out these streets.
- What do you think I've been doing?

77
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:38,346
- We're using Waltzer?.
- He's our guy.

78
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:43,727
- Isn't he chairing a hearing?
- Not this week.

79
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:50,025
This week he's fly-fishing in County
Kildare with one of our lrish guides.

80
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:54,154
And he won't be back anytime soon.

81
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:02,245
Senator, it sounds as lf
you want to lead the kind of charge -

82
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:09,878
- that Sen. Church led in the 70's, and
destroy the US's intelligence capability.

83
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:14,883
I want to know who they are and how
they're spending the taxpayers'money.

84
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:18,678
This is still a democracy.

85
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:25,560
Stick of gum, right?
No. Red light, green light.

86
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,774
You have a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together ...

87
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:36,154
Hasta lasagne, don't get any on ya'.
You'll have about five seconds.

88
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:41,117
Just don't chew it.

89
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:22,200
Ethan, Jack's inside.
Let's go.

90
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:31,334
How do you do, Senator?
How was the opera?

91
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:37,507
- It was boring.
- Let me see if I can steer you through.

92
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,400
- Windows open by 2300.
- Mr Brandl, the mayor, and Mrs Brandl.

93
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,572
Senator,
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

94
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:05,994
- Of course. How are you, Ms Norman?
- He's in pocket, on the stairway.

95
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:12,834
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.

96
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,088
Hannah.

97
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:22,636
Pull the shade.

98
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:35,273
Sarah, mark the package
and go to two.

99
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:45,909
Your advance team said you'd like
a tour of the facility. This way.

100
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:59,005
Oh, great.

101
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:05,178
... which leads to the Denied Area,
the only limited access area here.

102
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:33,081
Governor's in position now.

103
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:47,554
- Can I help you?
- As you can see, there's surveillance.

104
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:51,683
I'm sorry,
I know it's in here somewhere.

105
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,936
Sergeant, why are you not in uniform?

106
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:58,940
We've been ordered
to wear civilian clothes, sir.

107
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:04,404
Be right back.

108
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:11,620
- Do you have a Jack on your staff?
- I believe we did.

109
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,208
An unreliable fellow, as I recall.
Constantly late and behind in his work.

110
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:26,301
We were forced to tie him to a horse
and drag him around mybarn.

111
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm working on it.

112
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:46,404
Sorry.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.

113
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,586
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

114
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:33,159
Higher.

115
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:39,541
He's heading to the Denied Area.

116
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:46,214
Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.

117
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:58,268
Jack ...

118
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:03,023
Jack, we're in position here.

119
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,734
I didn't touch it.

120
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:12,741
- What about my coat? I'll freeze.
- Jack, open the doors.

121
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:24,252
He's in the box, Ethan.

122
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:28,465
- We'll take his exit. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

123
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:32,886
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

124
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:18,515
- He's got it.
- All right.

125
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:23,353
- I saved your ass again, Jack.
- Such a nice ass.

126
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:27,565
- And a lonely ass.
- Transport in five minutes.

127
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,574
Jack, we're in position. Open the doors
and let the package roll.

128
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:23,079
Stairway, you're wrapped.
Go to transport.

129
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,133
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

130
00:18:40,347 --> 00:18:45,018
I don't have control, Jack.
Cut the power.

131
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:51,650
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.

132
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,620
Jack ...

133
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:09,376
Jack ...
Jack?.

134
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:14,923
- Jack, do you copy?
- Man down, Ethan.

135
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:17,842
Man down.

136
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:41,324
Ethan, stay where you are.
I'm coming to you.

137
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:59,759
The package is out in the open.

138
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:06,600
- Jim, he's in the open.
- En route.

139
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:29,623
Jim, he's in the open.

140
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:34,085
Jim, the package is in the open.

141
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:41,635
I've got a shadow.
I can't lose him. Abort!

142
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:45,305
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

143
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:52,562
- I can't do that.
- We're being ambushed. Abort!

144
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:58,151
- Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
- No, dammit, I said abort!

145
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:12,332
- Eye on the package. Jim, I'm coming.
- Jim gave an abort.

146
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:18,421
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me? Now go!

147
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:54,249
- Where are you?
- 200 yards from the bridge.

148
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:57,085
They're covering the frequency.

149
00:21:57,335 --> 00:22:01,172
Cut all radio communication.

150
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:28,408
Ethan ...

151
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:04,235
Sarah, abort.
Repeat: abort!

152
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,075
Abort! Do you read me?

153
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:16,873
Sarah ...

154
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,284
Oh my God!

155
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,145
- Satcom 7.
- Central Europe, unsecured.

156
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:48,608
- Designator?
- Bravo, echo, one, one.

157
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,448
- This is Kittridge.
- Go secure.

158
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,912
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

159
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:05,625
- Who's dead?
- My team. My team is dead!

160
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:12,090
Golitsyn's gone. They knew
we were coming. The disk is gone.

161
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,554
- Are you intact?
- The list is in the open!

162
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:23,059
Let's just bring you in safely,
then we'll worry about that.

163
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:28,440
- Were you followed?
- I don't think so.

164
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,818
Don't think. Be sure.
Are you clean?

165
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,112
Yes.

166
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:39,075
Location Green, one hour.
I'llbe there myself.

167
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:42,287
- You're in Prague?
- One hour.

168
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,556
I ... I can't tell you how sorry I am.

169
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:48,687
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you.

170
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:54,359
- Personally as well as professionally.
- Yeah ...

171
00:27:58,446 --> 00:28:02,659
Here's a passport and visa. Usual drill.

172
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:05,954
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada -

173
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:10,250
- and throw the Prague police a bone,
toss them a few suspects.

174
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:20,594
- You follow me?
- Yeah, I follow you.

175
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:27,601
- We've lost enough agents for tonight.
- You mean, I have.

176
00:28:29,394 --> 00:28:34,941
- You're bent on blaming yourself.
- Who else is left?

177
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:40,405
Yeah, I see your point.

178
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:48,788
- Why was there another team?
- What?

179
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:53,335
The IMF agents at the embassy.

180
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:58,715
I don't quite follow you.

181
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:03,178
Then follow me around the room.

182
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:08,224
The drunk Russians on
the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock.

183
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:15,774
The couple waltzing around me,
the waiter standing behind Hannah.

184
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:20,654
Bow tie at 12 o'clock.
The other IMF team.

185
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:23,823
You're worried about me. Why?.

186
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:30,538
For two years
we've been spotting a blowback -

187
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:34,292
- in IMF operations.
We have a penetration.

188
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:39,631
We've decoded an lnternet message
from a Czech we know as "Max'.

189
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:43,093
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

190
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:50,850
Max has a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

191
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:57,524
This time he got on the inside,
in a position to buy our NOC list.

192
00:29:57,774 --> 00:30:03,780
An operation he called "Job 3-14". He
thought Golitsyn was doing it tonight.

193
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,705
- The list he stole was a decoy.
- That's correct.

194
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:16,626
The actual list is secure at Langley.
Golitsyn was one of ours.

195
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:24,092
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

196
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:33,643
- The whole operation was a mole hunt.
- Yeah.

197
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:39,357
The mole's deep inside.

198
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:45,280
And like you said ...

199
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,199
... you survived.

200
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:52,787
I want to show you something.

201
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:59,836
Since your father's death, your
family's farm has been in receivership.

202
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:04,007
Suddenly, they have 120 grand
in the bank.

203
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:08,011
The illness was supposed to have
wiped out that account.

204
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:13,892
Dying slowly in America can be
a very expensive proposition.

205
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:22,067
So why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

206
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:29,866
- I can understand you're very upset.
- You've never seen me very upset.

207
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:32,535
Enough is enough.

208
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:37,374
You've bribed and killed,
using loyalties on the inside.

209
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:42,337
You want to shake hands with the
devil? Fine, but you'll do it in hell.

210
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:46,294
Money, money ...
Where's the damn money?.

211
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:18,868
We've decoded an lnternet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".

212
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,000
He got in a position to buy our NOC
list. An operation he called "Job 3-14".

213
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:43,536
"... asleep and at rest with kings
and counsellors of the earth ..."

214
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:49,084
You son of a bitch.

215
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:30,852
Ethan ...

216
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:36,524
What are you doing?
I needed you.

217
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:39,945
On the bridge.

218
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:43,531
But you weren't there.

219
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:03,009
- Don't move.
- Ethan ...

220
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:13,353
- You were in the car.
- No, I wasn't.

221
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:20,777
- I heard on the radio ...
- I saw you, you were in the car.

222
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:26,241
No, I got out of the car. I ran to
the bridge. He said someone was ...

223
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:30,954
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.
There was nobody there.

224
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:36,918
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead! They're all dead!

225
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,847
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead ...

226
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:54,894
Take off your coat.

227
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:13,079
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

228
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:20,045
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you? Did they send you?

229
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:23,882
No one sent me.

230
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:29,804
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock if we abort.

231
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:34,643
0400. Four a.m. Four o'clock.
It's four o'clock.

232
00:39:34,893 --> 00:39:38,813
If we abort ... four a.m.

233
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,878
I've been disavowed.

234
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:11,721
They actually think
I killed Jim and everyone else.

235
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:20,563
Somehow, $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

236
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:26,319
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole,
employed by an arms dealer, Max, -

237
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:30,991
- for the last two years,
to get him our NOC list.

238
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:37,998
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.

239
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:42,502
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

240
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,382
Whoever the mole is,
he goes by the name of Job.

241
00:40:47,632 --> 00:40:52,846
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list, he'll find me.

242
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:58,101
I'm going to go in and tell Kittridge
you have nothing to do with this.

243
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:04,274
Claire, if you're not dead,
he'll assume you're with me.

244
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:23,126
The message is for Job.

245
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:26,838
That's right.
And I'm going to answer it.

246
00:41:50,528 --> 00:41:55,200
Excuse me,
could I trouble you for a match?

247
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:14,761
Remove your hat, please.

248
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:20,308
- Why?.
- You wish to meet Max?.

249
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:23,728
The price of admission.

250
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:38,994
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood. No one sees Max.

251
00:42:39,244 --> 00:42:45,584
- Then why the hell am I here?
- So he can hear what you have to say.

252
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:49,421
I don't communicate well
through a shroud.

253
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:55,594
If Max doesn't like what you say,
you'll be wearing it indefinitely.

254
00:42:57,137 --> 00:43:00,682
I'm willing to take the chance.

255
00:43:04,686 --> 00:43:07,147
Very well.

256
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:14,696
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

257
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:18,199
I need $150,000.

258
00:43:19,868 --> 00:43:22,078
Really?.

259
00:43:24,748 --> 00:43:30,337
And you thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?

260
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:34,299
Why not? You gave Job 125.

261
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:41,264
The penny drops. You are not Job.

262
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:48,104
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

263
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:54,402
Its tone was aggressive but playful.
Job is not playful.

264
00:43:56,029 --> 00:44:01,451
- So you are something of a paradox.
- Well, that depends.

265
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:05,580
- On what?
- Whether you like a paradox.

266
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:13,171
- I want $150,000 today.
- That's quite out of the question.

267
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:19,135
The disk Job sold you is worthless.

268
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:23,556
It's bait. Part of an internal mole hunt.

269
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:31,856
And how might you know that?

270
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:35,986
Are you another company man?

271
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:39,698
Like Job?

272
00:44:41,658 --> 00:44:45,495
We're asking about you.

273
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:50,417
I'm NOC. Was ...
Now disavowed.

274
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:56,423
- Why, may I ask?.
- That's what I want to ask Job.

275
00:44:56,673 --> 00:45:01,886
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.

276
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:05,932
You could arrange an introduction.

277
00:45:06,182 --> 00:45:10,645
- Why should l?
- I can deliver the actual NOC list.

278
00:45:10,895 --> 00:45:17,027
Your list is worthless, and it's probably
equipped with a homing device.

279
00:45:21,072 --> 00:45:27,287
Boot it up. In 10 minutes you'll have the
CIA hopping around you like rabbits.

280
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:37,380
It's easy to say it's worthless if I can't
look at it to see if it's worthless.

281
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:43,094
- Not a tenable position, sir.
- Okay, use it.

282
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:47,807
But I'd suggest you pack first.

283
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:08,078
- 26-27. So far, so good.
- Not so good for you, my friend.

284
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:12,207
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

285
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:48,034
- 32 and 33.
- Doesn't mean it's a signal.

286
00:46:55,584 --> 00:46:59,254
44 and 45.

287
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:51,222
The man's gone black, Barnes.
He's under until he decides to surface.

288
00:47:51,473 --> 00:47:57,854
- We can cut off his transportation.
- What can we do, Barnes?

289
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:02,192
Put a guy at the airport?
How many identities does Hunt have?

290
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:06,529
How many times
has he slipped past customs?

291
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,576
These guys are trained to be ghosts.
We taught them!

292
00:48:11,826 --> 00:48:15,163
What do you suggest?

293
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:19,000
Let's make him come to us.

294
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:25,757
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.

295
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:35,392
GÃ¼nther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.

296
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,898
- Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
- Thanks, Max.

297
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:46,319
Or is it Maxine?

298
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:50,824
I don't have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity is in my profession.

299
00:48:52,158 --> 00:48:55,453
It's like a warm blanket.

300
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:04,045
My deal with Job was subject to
a successful boot scan. The deal's off.

301
00:49:06,172 --> 00:49:10,302
- What was your deal with Job?
- Six million dollars.

302
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:15,432
I'll give you the same, for the
complete list, not just Eastern Europe.

303
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:19,603
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

304
00:49:19,853 --> 00:49:26,901
10 million, in negotiable US Treasury
certificates, coupons attached.

305
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:30,030
And one more thing ...

306
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,243
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

307
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:58,391
- Max made a deal with you?
- I deliver the list, Max delivers Job.

308
00:50:00,518 --> 00:50:04,981
We've 75 rounds for the Beretta,
but only 20 for the Sig-Sauer.

309
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:09,110
One pair of Visco glasses.

310
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:12,238
Plenty of passports ...

311
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:22,332
Well, you said it yourself.
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

312
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,712
- Are you sure?
- Jim was my husband.

313
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:32,634
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

314
00:50:32,884 --> 00:50:38,890
- We need help. They'll have to be local.
- What kind of help?

315
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,804
Simple game. Four players.

316
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:22,434
Exfil opens the pocket,
cyber ops lifts the wallet.

317
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:26,980
- Bank?.
- IMF mainframe.

318
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,818
- Where exactly is it?
- In Langley.

319
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:37,616
In Langley?.
The one in Virginia?

320
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,704
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?.

321
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:46,416
- Is he serious?
- Always.

322
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:52,589
Why don't we drop by Fort Knox?.

323
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:57,052
I can fly a helicopter into the vault.

324
00:51:57,302 --> 00:52:01,181
It would be easier
than breaking into the CIA.

325
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:06,394
- What kind of information is it?
- Profitable.

326
00:52:08,146 --> 00:52:11,191
Payment on delivery.

327
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:16,446
I don't know.
I just don't know.

328
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:22,244
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

329
00:52:22,494 --> 00:52:26,957
What did they used to call you?
The Net Ranger?.

330
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:30,085
The only man to hack NATO Ghostcom.

331
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:35,840
There was never any evidence
that I had anything to do with that ...

332
00:52:36,091 --> 00:52:39,511
... with that exceptional piece of work.

333
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:48,687
You don't know what you're missing.
This is the Mt Everest of hacks.

334
00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:55,527
You're kidding yourselves. Even with
top of the line crypto, Stu 3's ...

335
00:52:55,777 --> 00:53:00,865
- Krieger can get it. Right?
- It may take a little time.

336
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:04,786
That's not what Claire says about you.

337
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:09,124
Thinking Machine laptops.

338
00:53:09,374 --> 00:53:14,796
The 686 prototypes,
with the artificial intelligence Risc chip.

339
00:53:15,046 --> 00:53:17,799
24 hours.

340
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:22,470
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

341
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:27,684
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.

342
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:34,482
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

343
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:40,864
No modem access to a mainframe.
It's in what we call a "stand-alone".

344
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:46,578
Which means I'd have to be
physically at the terminal.

345
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:50,665
Relax, it's much worse than you think.

346
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:53,668
It's in a black vault lock-down.

347
00:53:53,919 --> 00:54:00,342
The onlyperson allowed in the room
has to pass through security checks.

348
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:06,014
The first is a voiceprint identifiication
and a six-digit access code.

349
00:54:08,642 --> 00:54:12,187
This only gets him into the outerroom.

350
00:54:12,437 --> 00:54:16,149
Next he has to pass a retinal scan.

351
00:54:18,109 --> 00:54:24,366
And the intrusion countermeasures are
deactivated by an electronic key card.

352
00:54:24,616 --> 00:54:28,119
Which we won't have.

353
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:35,502
Inside the black vault, three systems
operate whenever the technician is out.

354
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:41,800
The first is sound sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.

355
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:45,303
The second system detects
any increase in temperature.

356
00:54:45,553 --> 00:54:51,893
The bodyheat of an intruder will trigger
it if the temperature rises one degree.

357
00:54:56,731 --> 00:55:01,194
That temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning duct, -

358
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:04,864
- 30 feet above the floor.

359
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:07,993
That vent is guarded by a lasernet.

360
00:55:11,246 --> 00:55:15,959
The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.

361
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:20,505
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.

362
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:26,761
If any one of these systems is set off,
it will activate an automatic lock-down.

363
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:33,018
Believe me when I tell you,
all three systems are state of the art.

364
00:55:37,606 --> 00:55:40,775
And you really think we can do this?

365
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:44,154
We're going to do it.

366
00:56:17,896 --> 00:56:20,607
Alarms in sectors 3, 7 and 12.

367
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:25,695
- What sector's the air conditioning?
- 21. But there's no alarm in 21.

368
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:37,916
No one goes into any sector where the
alarm hasn't gone off, and it hasn't...

369
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:46,341
- It's gone off. Let's go.
- Let's move.

370
00:56:57,477 --> 00:57:01,314
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

371
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:06,069
21's through here.

372
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:16,121
- He's recruiting. For what purpose?
- Survival.

373
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:21,293
Too short-sighted. This guy initiates.
The question is, what does he want?

374
00:57:21,543 --> 00:57:26,298
Where does he need to get it?
Barnes, what the hell is that noise?

375
00:57:26,548 --> 00:57:32,262
- Fire alarm, Gene.
- Do we have to evacuate?

376
00:58:19,893 --> 00:58:22,687
Hey, where's the other guy?.

377
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:29,319
- Zero body count.
- We'll see.

378
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:06,166
Hi, there.

379
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,604
One, two, three.

380
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:13,191
Toast, toast.

381
01:01:13,441 --> 01:01:18,863
- Check.
- Good. Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

382
01:01:19,114 --> 01:01:23,952
Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?

383
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:35,672
- Damn.
- Krieger, from now on, total silence.

384
01:02:52,249 --> 01:02:54,918
He's rolling to you.

385
01:02:57,879 --> 01:03:01,633
- He's at the voiceprint corridor.
- William Donloe.

386
01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:19,734
Outer room.

387
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:26,449
He's coming in the vault.

388
01:03:30,495 --> 01:03:32,998
Come on, move.

389
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:03,838
He's in the bathroom.

390
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:22,292
A-W-9 -

391
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:24,961
- 6-B-6.

392
01:06:43,939 --> 01:06:45,815
Holy mother of God.

393
01:06:46,066 --> 01:06:48,151
A NOC list.

394
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:48,456
He's at the vault.

395
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,970
Four yellows.

396
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:07,976
One red.

397
01:10:17,736 --> 01:10:20,071
Get moving.

398
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:25,368
Toast.

399
01:11:25,971 --> 01:11:28,265
Oh, my God.

400
01:11:44,072 --> 01:11:48,451
- It's for you.
- Kittridge.

401
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:15,854
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops.

402
01:12:16,104 --> 01:12:19,566
- It never happened.
- What about him?

403
01:12:19,816 --> 01:12:24,154
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

404
01:13:04,402 --> 01:13:09,407
Are you contacting your buyer?
Ethan?

405
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:25,548
Ethan?

406
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:30,553
Oh, excuse me. "Mr Hunt".

407
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:43,441
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

408
01:13:43,692 --> 01:13:48,572
My contact is extremely shy.

409
01:13:48,822 --> 01:13:52,909
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders.

410
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:56,454
- Not while I'm holding this.
- Krieger ...

411
01:13:56,705 --> 01:13:58,790
Shut up.

412
01:14:03,295 --> 01:14:06,756
- You mean this?
- That's not the list.

413
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:10,468
You've never seen this trick?.

414
01:14:17,976 --> 01:14:20,645
Where did it go?

415
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:26,318
It's gone.

416
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:30,113
- What?
- You ... no?

417
01:14:37,162 --> 01:14:39,623
But not too far.

418
01:14:42,584 --> 01:14:45,337
I know what you're thinking.

419
01:14:45,587 --> 01:14:51,134
"ln the computer room, I was up here
and he was down there."

420
01:14:52,469 --> 01:14:57,307
"He was carrying two disks."

421
01:15:00,018 --> 01:15:04,230
- It's hard to keep track of these things.
- Where is it?

422
01:15:19,704 --> 01:15:23,875
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

423
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:29,756
Try any sleight of hand with my money
and I'll cut your throat.

424
01:15:54,864 --> 01:15:59,202
- On a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

425
01:15:59,452 --> 01:16:03,081
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

426
01:16:04,082 --> 01:16:06,960
I'm so sorry.

427
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,468
Krieger was my call.

428
01:16:20,307 --> 01:16:24,227
I'm sorry, Ethan.

429
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:30,859
We did what we had to do.

430
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:34,738
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

431
01:17:12,067 --> 01:17:15,987
Krieger did have the NOC list?

432
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:29,960
Hold on to it. If you knew what you were
getting into, you wouldn't have done it.

433
01:17:36,258 --> 01:17:39,886
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

434
01:17:40,136 --> 01:17:46,476
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on
the train. Don't let it get out in the open.

435
01:17:53,149 --> 01:17:57,946
- What is the range of this thing?
- It's hard to tell. I'll have to be close.

436
01:18:03,702 --> 01:18:08,415
The unlikely setting, a farm in the
heartland of America, Wisconsin.

437
01:18:08,665 --> 01:18:13,128
Here, Federal agents found the brains
behind an international drug ring:

438
01:18:13,378 --> 01:18:18,508
Margaret Ethan Hunt and her
brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.

439
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:24,097
They were arrested this morning
in a major sting operation -

440
01:18:24,347 --> 01:18:30,061
- designed to expose the
illegal manufacture of the drug "khat".

441
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:32,814
- What we have here is a case ...
- Kittridge.

442
01:19:04,012 --> 01:19:06,348
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

443
01:19:06,598 --> 01:19:09,893
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

444
01:19:10,143 --> 01:19:13,146
Been watching a little TV?

445
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:18,485
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

446
01:19:18,735 --> 01:19:21,238
- He's in England.
- Get Ml5.

447
01:19:21,488 --> 01:19:26,034
My first order of business
after you come in -

448
01:19:26,284 --> 01:19:32,374
- is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped.

449
01:19:32,624 --> 01:19:35,418
If you come in now, -

450
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:40,548
- we can play down
the charges against you, as well.

451
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:45,428
- Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
- Certainly, Ethan.

452
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,931
If you're dealing with someone -

453
01:19:48,181 --> 01:19:51,268
- who's crushed, stabbed, -

454
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:54,229
- shot and detonated -

455
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:58,817
- fiive members ofhis own IMF team, -

456
01:19:59,067 --> 01:20:04,322
- how devastated will you make him
by arresting Ma and Uncle Donald?

457
01:20:04,573 --> 01:20:10,120
I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?

458
01:20:11,121 --> 01:20:15,292
Lost him.
We needed three more seconds.

459
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:19,337
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

460
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:35,854
You're a hard man to catch up with.

461
01:20:42,736 --> 01:20:46,698
The next day I dragged myself
back to the safe house.

462
01:20:46,948 --> 01:20:51,202
- I checked our aliases.
- And you picked us up in the States.

463
01:20:51,453 --> 01:20:54,748
But you'd gone,
and I could check just so many places.

464
01:20:54,998 --> 01:20:59,461
Some European countries
don't computerise customs records.

465
01:20:59,711 --> 01:21:03,089
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

466
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:09,137
- You know I like Liverpool St. rentals.
- I showed them to you.

467
01:21:09,387 --> 01:21:12,515
I remember.

468
01:21:12,766 --> 01:21:18,688
A doctor's got to look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

469
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:26,196
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well. Sit down.

470
01:21:27,906 --> 01:21:32,744
Ethan ... I saw who shot me.

471
01:21:32,994 --> 01:21:35,789
I saw the mole.

472
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:39,626
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge ...

473
01:21:39,876 --> 01:21:42,545
Kittridge, Ethan!

474
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:52,138
Kittridge is the mole.
My God. Of course, you're right.

475
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:03,149
He was at the embassy that night.

476
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,696
First he took out Jack, at the elevator.

477
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:19,207
He shot you on the bridge.

478
01:23:02,626 --> 01:23:07,422
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

479
01:23:24,731 --> 01:23:28,652
How did he do Hannah?

480
01:23:51,716 --> 01:23:55,387
No, he could've done Hannah himself.

481
01:24:22,205 --> 01:24:26,418
Why, Jim?
Why?

482
01:24:29,546 --> 01:24:34,884
When you think about it,
it was inevitable. No more Cold War.

483
01:24:35,093 --> 01:24:41,224
No more secrets to keep
from everyone but yourself.

484
01:24:41,474 --> 01:24:47,772
Then suddenly the President is running
the country without your permission.

485
01:24:48,023 --> 01:24:54,070
The son of a bitch, how dare he?
And you realise it's over.

486
01:24:54,321 --> 01:25:00,035
You're obsolete hardware, with
a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.

487
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:07,125
Kittridge. We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch, big time.

488
01:25:12,213 --> 01:25:16,718
We won't have to.
He'll come after us.

489
01:25:16,968 --> 01:25:22,057
- What's going to make him do that?
- What he didn't get in Prague.

490
01:25:22,307 --> 01:25:25,685
The NOC list.

491
01:25:25,936 --> 01:25:28,939
Jesus, Ethan.

492
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:32,609
Good for you.

493
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:40,742
- We meet tomorrow, the TGV to Paris.
- Tight security. No guns. Real plus.

494
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:45,830
I deliver the NOC list to Max,
Max delivers Job to me.

495
01:25:46,081 --> 01:25:51,670
Claire and Luther will be on the train.
Krieger will have a helicopter in Paris.

496
01:25:55,006 --> 01:25:57,676
Jim?

497
01:26:05,475 --> 01:26:08,853
I was in a cafe, waiting for you ...

498
01:26:10,397 --> 01:26:12,774
... and there she was.

499
01:26:13,024 --> 01:26:18,697
Standing in the rain, alive and beautiful,
thinking I'm dead and gone.

500
01:26:22,701 --> 01:26:27,706
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going.

501
01:26:32,252 --> 01:26:36,089
She can't know about me. No one can.
Not till this is over.

502
01:26:36,339 --> 01:26:42,053
- You're probably right.
- There's too much at stake.

503
01:26:42,304 --> 01:26:47,642
Once we leave the safe house,
you get in there and crash.

504
01:26:47,892 --> 01:26:51,855
- I'll call from Paris.
- You got it.

505
01:27:14,878 --> 01:27:17,881
What happened?

506
01:27:20,216 --> 01:27:24,220
I sent the message to Max.

507
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:30,226
We're on for tomorrow.

508
01:27:35,857 --> 01:27:38,443
Okay.

509
01:27:47,744 --> 01:27:50,288
Come here.

510
01:28:31,037 --> 01:28:34,583
- What's this?
- Incoming for you.

511
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:38,628
X-ray's clean. Non-explosive.

512
01:28:49,055 --> 01:28:52,225
Gene.

513
01:28:55,478 --> 01:28:59,900
How long to the London terminus?
We've got 10 minutes. Move!

514
01:29:38,647 --> 01:29:41,858
- Give me Max.
- It's him.

515
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:50,533
- This was not what we discussed.
- My apologies. It couldn't be helped.

516
01:29:50,784 --> 01:29:54,079
You'll find the disk under your seat.

517
01:30:29,197 --> 01:30:35,829
Dear boy, I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

518
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:41,543
- Not if you tell me where the money is.
- The mere chance is worth 10 million.

519
01:30:41,793 --> 01:30:47,674
Baggage car, rack 3,
silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

520
01:30:47,924 --> 01:30:53,388
- What about Job?
- I wouldn't worry, he'll find you.

521
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:14,576
- What's the matter?.
- It's not transmitting.

522
01:31:14,826 --> 01:31:19,873
We've got to get this through
before we hit the tunnel.

523
01:31:31,885 --> 01:31:36,765
- What's the problem?
- "Connection denied."

524
01:31:37,015 --> 01:31:41,436
- Did you check the batteries?
- I always check the batteries.

525
01:31:41,686 --> 01:31:44,898
Run it through from the top.

526
01:31:47,317 --> 01:31:50,695
We don't know what Max looks like.

527
01:31:50,946 --> 01:31:57,035
If he's got that list, he'll want
to check it. That means laptops.

528
01:32:08,046 --> 01:32:10,840
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

529
01:32:17,555 --> 01:32:22,894
- Is everything all right?
- It's working.

530
01:32:34,197 --> 01:32:36,324
He's in the baggage car.

531
01:32:37,659 --> 01:32:44,332
- Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.
- I'll meet you in the baggage car.

532
01:33:01,099 --> 01:33:03,143
Barnes.

533
01:33:40,305 --> 01:33:45,101
Ethan's right behind me.
Listen, Jim ...

534
01:33:45,352 --> 01:33:48,104
Is it such a good idea to kill him?

535
01:33:52,108 --> 01:33:54,778
Kittridge is here.

536
01:33:57,614 --> 01:34:01,618
We take the money,
Ethan takes the blame.

537
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:07,582
No one else has seen you alive.

538
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:11,586
No one will believe him.

539
01:34:38,863 --> 01:34:44,661
Of course, I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

540
01:34:46,788 --> 01:34:52,377
- Ethan.
- Yes, Ethan Hunt. You remember him.

541
01:34:55,589 --> 01:35:00,385
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

542
01:35:00,635 --> 01:35:05,098
When he knew is a good question.
Mind telling me, Ethan?

543
01:35:05,348 --> 01:35:08,602
Before or after I showed up in London?

544
01:35:09,853 --> 01:35:14,399
Before London. After you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

545
01:35:15,984 --> 01:35:19,112
They stamped it, didn't they?
Damned Gideons.

546
01:35:20,572 --> 01:35:24,409
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why ..?

547
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:29,539
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?.

548
01:35:29,789 --> 01:35:34,169
You've asked the question ...
and you are the answer.

549
01:35:34,419 --> 01:35:39,424
- I knew about Jim.
- But he didn't know about you.

550
01:35:39,674 --> 01:35:44,930
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

551
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,725
But I was confident,
having tasted the goods.

552
01:35:50,936 --> 01:35:55,190
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife."

553
01:35:57,859 --> 01:36:02,656
- Let's just get the money and get out.
- Yes, let's get the money.

554
01:36:02,906 --> 01:36:06,826
Ethan, the money.

555
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:11,998
Give her the money.

556
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:17,003
You've earned it.

557
01:36:22,717 --> 01:36:27,555
- All 10 million.
- Claire was wrong about one thing.

558
01:36:27,806 --> 01:36:30,767
Oh, what's that?

559
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:53,582
Good morning, Mr Phelps.

560
01:36:53,832 --> 01:36:57,627
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

561
01:36:59,504 --> 01:37:03,633
- You son of a bitch.
- It's over, Jim.

562
01:37:09,848 --> 01:37:13,435
- Don't. Don't, Jim.
- "Don't, Jim"?

563
01:40:29,047 --> 01:40:35,095
No, he's in the tunnel.
He'll crash into us! Accelerate!

564
01:42:37,592 --> 01:42:41,304
Red light ... green light.

565
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:38,028
I think this is what you're looking for.

566
01:43:42,908 --> 01:43:45,160
Hello, Max.

567
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:50,999
My lawyers will have a field day with it.
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict ...

568
01:43:51,249 --> 01:43:55,378
Maybe we'll just leave the courts
out of this one.

569
01:43:57,297 --> 01:44:01,051
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

570
01:44:02,427 --> 01:44:07,098
In a freak accident, a helicopter
lost altitude, veered into a tunnel, -

571
01:44:07,349 --> 01:44:11,144
- and collided with a high-speed train.

572
01:44:11,394 --> 01:44:16,733
The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt...

573
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:23,740
- You call your folks? How do they feel?
- About what?

574
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:30,330
The Justice Department apology,
VIP treatment, the whole nine yards.

575
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:37,921
My mom didn't know how the DEA
mistook them for drug smugglers.

576
01:44:40,882 --> 01:44:44,886
- Cheers.
- To you, Luther.

577
01:44:45,136 --> 01:44:49,891
- And being off the disavowed list.
- Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

578
01:44:52,185 --> 01:44:56,356
Why don't you come back with me?

579
01:44:56,606 --> 01:45:00,443
I just don't know why
I'd be doing it.

580
01:45:02,988 --> 01:45:08,118
I've got to catch my flight ...
How does it feel to be a solid citizen?

581
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:16,918
Man, I don't know.
I'm going to miss being disreputable.

582
01:45:17,168 --> 01:45:22,424
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll always think of you that way.

583
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:36,354
Excuse me, Mr Hunt.

584
01:45:36,605 --> 01:45:39,774
Would you like to watch a movie?

585
01:45:40,025 --> 01:45:43,194
No, thank you.

586
01:45:43,445 --> 01:45:49,075
Would you consider the cinema
of the Caribbean?

587
01:45:49,326 --> 01:45:52,287
Aruba, perhaps.
