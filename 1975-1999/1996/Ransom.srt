1
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,996
- Peter, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

2
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,236
- I'm wonderful. How are you?
- Good, good.

3
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,874
Is this a night
for a party or what?

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,160
- I mean, this huge mix-up--
- Okay, everyone.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,158
- I found his commercial. Come on in.
- Oh, I can't wait to see it.

6
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,350
Oh, he-- he can't weasel out
of this one. We're gonna show it.

7
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,675
It's show time, folks.
Let's go.

8
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,597
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
- Hey, quiet!

9
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,836
I came from fairly humble beginnings
from upstate New York.

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,679
- And to be honest, I'd never
even been on an aeroplane before.
- Nice make-up.

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,758
Not until the Air Force
taught me to fly in 1969.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,997
I ended up doing 28
combat missions for them.

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,475
In, uh, 1971--
Oh, a tough year--

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,477
I threw everything I owned
into a charter service.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,397
- You look better than those frogs
in that beer commercial.
- When we kicked off...

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,195
we had a six-seater and one DC-3,
and we would fly anywhere.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,151
We were like
the yellow cabs of the sky.

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,035
In 1979, we started Endeavor, and
we only flew to four different cities.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,119
But, uh, I think the passengers
picked up on my, my joy in flying.

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,913
And we've grown
to 37 countries worldwide.

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,031
We're still pretty small
in the scheme of things.

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,628
But then, I never wanted
to be the biggest, just the best.

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,072
The most important thing
to me these days: family.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,270
Mine. Yours.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,197
That's the good thing
about an airline.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,675
It actually brings families
closer together, among other things.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,918
And that makes me
feel good. 1971. Man.

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,079
I had the devil in me back then.
But today-- people change.

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,350
Sort of.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,994
- He really didn't want to do it.
- I thought he was great.

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,033
- He was good.
- Author!
- Where did he go?

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,957
Okay, get it over with,
you pack of freeloaders.

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,230
- Put it there. I got big shoulders.
- When's it air?

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,998
I was afraid to ask, actually. No,
you're too kind. No, you're too kind.

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,315
Actually, I'm contemplating
suicide before it airs.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,317
Oh, yes, of course.
Because he's so shy.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,273
And next month, he's doing the underwear
billboard in Times Square. Ow!

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,757
You should have seen-- You should
have seen the look on his face.

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,677
He couldn't figure out
where I got that information.

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,995
- And where did you?
- I took safe-cracking at MIT.

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,429
- No, the guy couldn't believe it.
- Hey, Sean, you eat something?

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,198
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Good.

43
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,436
You know, the guy's a wacko.
I mean, seriously, he's, like, whoo!

44
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,154
- Unbelievable, unbelievable.
- What I can't figure out is how
someone expects you to bite...

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,555
without expecting you to know
everything about his business.

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,514
- I agree.
- Yeah. Anyway, uh,
David's on the carpet.

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,195
- All right, time to fold
the tent, fella. Come on.
- Tom?

48
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,515
- Yeah?
- Where did you get the tile
in the kitchen? It's great.

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,517
Oh, God, Louisa,
that's a Kate question.

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,110
See, I only answer Tom questions
like, uh, you know, what's wrong
with my chain saw?

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,755
- What's the best time of day
to kill a grizzly bear?
- I have a perfect Tom question.

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,269
How do you feel about Jackie Brown
filing a civil suit against you...

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,358
from his prison cell?

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,029
Sean, why don't you, uh, brush,
get ready. I'll be down in a minute.
David, would you get Bob, please?

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,118
- And you are?
- I'm just givin' you heads-up
because this Brown guy now says...

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,550
that he has proof that you paid him
to head off the machinists' strike.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,557
Well, that's not novel. I mean,
he's been saying that for months.

58
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,468
I know, I know. But now he says he has
proof that you even initiated the bribe.

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,558
I'm Sammy Adler from
the Daily News. I just thought
if we could spend a couple seconds--

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,956
- Oh, oh, Bob Stone,
Sammy Adams from the Daily News. Uh--
- Adler.

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,116
- Why don't you make sure
he gets home safe?
- Can we get-- Can we do
something for two seconds?

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,993
- I hope you had
a good time here. Drive safely.
- All right, all right.

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,633
- We're very civil here.
- Guys, I'm a reporter. All right?

64
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,637
- We know who you are.
- I'm not a stalker, guys.

65
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,399
Listen, your boss is gonna
have to deal with this.
Jackie Brown says he was set up.

66
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,238
I think you gotta find
someone else to talk to.

67
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,828
- He's in the clear,
you understand, Sammy?
- Listen, if I was--

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,393
- I came from humble--
- Cut.
- Sean?

69
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,317
- Okay, try it again.
- About four cities, but l--

70
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,159
- Sean?
- But people picked on my--
- Oh, I guess he's not here.

71
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,319
So I'll lie down and take a nap
while I wait for him to turn up.

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,079
God, this mattress is lumpy.
And damned noisy too.

73
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,431
And it's got hair and-- what?
This mattress needs to be tickled!

74
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,152
No laughing.
No laughing allowed.

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,077
And why are you watching
my goof-ups again?

76
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,077
- What is this bug in the-- Sorry.
- Cut.

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,998
- That's funny.
- Yeah? Well, must make you
feel good inside...

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,951
to know your old man
can't even talk.

79
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,992
Grobe?
A shrinking grobe?

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,315
Was that guy mad
at you upstairs?

81
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,718
No. He's, uh, not mad.
He's, uh, he's curious. Yeah.

82
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,709
- It's his job, you know. He's gotta--
- It seems like someone's
always mad at you.

83
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,559
- That the way that seems?
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,638
Well, I guess that--
You're not mad at me, are you?

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,150
- No.
- Well, I can-- I can fix that.

86
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,235
- A knuckle sandwich before bedtime.
- Stop it! Stop it!

87
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,430
I said get your ass movin'!

88
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,949
- Get on the car! Shut the fuck up!
- I ain't do nothin'!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

89
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,036
- Shut up, Romeo.
- Calm down. Joey! Joey!
Take it easy. Take--

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,833
- Get him outta here.
- A fuckin' track star, huh?

91
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,269
- You little faggot.
- Faggot? What?

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,755
- You're lucky I don't put one
in your back, you fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,836
- All right? You all right?
- I'm all right.
- All right.

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,713
Honey, you better work the door.
I think the Mayor wants to leave.

95
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,751
Oh, thank God. You okay?

96
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,791
- Yeah.
- Good.

97
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,150
Okay, did you brush your teeth?

98
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,352
-I brushed them this morning.
-No, no, no. We're gonna brush them now.

99
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,957
45-Adam to Central-K.
207 West 30th Street.

100
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,868
- Two unidentified suspects--
- Hey, hey. What are they, mink?

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,797
Yeah, why? You wanna buy one?
Take a walk.

102
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,873
Oh, God. I'm beat.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,356
So where was that guy from?
Daily News?

104
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,155
- Does it make a difference?
- Ohh! I'd like to kill those bastards.

105
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,431
When they come after you,
they come after us.

106
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,518
It's freezing.

107
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,552
- Oh, God.
- I'd like to come after the contractor.

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,910
- Yeah, well, you gotta find him first.
- Yeah, really.

109
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,670
It's freezing in here.
Oh, that feels good.

110
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,950
Don't let those guys
get to you, okay?

111
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,674
- Yeah.
- That's what they want.

112
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,832
I just wanna say

113
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,190
Singin' makes me feel so fine

114
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,029
Drivin' in my truck, man
I'm always on the go

115
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,311
Makin' my deliveries
from here to Tupelo

116
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,237
- Tupelo
- But singin' bass--

117
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,831
Okay, now I'd like to introduce
to you the person responsible
for this wonderful event.

118
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,590
Uh, a fantastic lady. In fact,
chairlady of the Junior Science Fair...

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,109
Mrs Katherine Mullen.

120
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,196
- All right! Yea!
- Thank you.

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,034
Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.

122
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,073
And welcome to the tenth annual
New York City Junior Science Fair.

123
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
We have 54 young inventors
competing today...

124
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,033
- representing 22 schools--
- Dad?
- Yeah?
- Why can't I enter?

125
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,515
Well, it wouldn't be fair, Sean.
Your mother's a judge here.

126
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,351
- And, uh, how would that
look if you won?
- Why don't I enter
under a different name?

127
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,711
- What, you mean, like John Smith?
- No. Like Professor X.

128
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,037
Well, I don't think you'd get
away with that, Professor X.

129
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,789
I mean, you're too young to have
a degree. You got to be bald,
have an eye patch. You know.

130
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,276
No, better.
Professor von X.

131
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,312
And the third judge, I regret to say,
is myself, Katherine Mullen...

132
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,716
Events Chair for
the 125th Anniversary of Central Park...

133
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,674
and former teacher of biology
at Evander Childs High School.

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,549
So let the games begin.

135
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,353
Our judges will now
begin circulating.

136
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,552
- So all of our inventors
should be with their booths.
- Wow. Destination: Yonkers.

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,593
That's gotta be the best project out
here. Don't you think it's gonna win?

138
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,110
- Whoa!
- Oh, look, there's me!

139
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,310
Yeah, the wind is taking it.
Down left rudder.

140
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,831
Remember, we're going to want
all of today's winners on stage
at 1:00 to receive their award.

141
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,394
- Good luck, everybody.
- It's not fair, Dad.
I worked really hard.

142
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,876
I know. I know you worked really hard,
and you did an amazing job.

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,195
- But we talked about this before,
didn't we, Sean?
- Yes.

144
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,835
Okay? Come on.
Lighten up a little. Enjoy the day.

145
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,599
- Okay.
- Anyone else that has not registered...
- Tom!

146
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,439
- Hey!
- Hey, how are you?
- must have their registration
cards in right now.

147
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,471
This is your last chance.

148
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,517
- P.S. 41.
- Okay, P.S. 41. Yeah.

149
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,757
Solar system here?
And this big guy here is what?

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,950
- The sun.
- Okay.

151
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,877
- And how many planets
do we have around it?
- Nine.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,275
- Nine.
- I see Mars.

153
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,551
Okay, folks, we'd like to thank
the Friends of Central Park...

154
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,593
and Mayor Barresi
for allowing this event...

155
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,111
to take place here
at the beautiful Bethesda Fountain.

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,949
- And a special thanks to our--
- Hey, Katie, look at the blimp.

157
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,752
- Me too.
- Looking forward to it.

158
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,633
...for ten years strong. Lisa?

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,078
Well, folks, there's still
a few of those souvenir
science fair T-shirts left.

160
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,755
- She's incredible. I mean,
the work she's put into this.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,589
Well, I don't know
where she gets the energy.

162
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,029
- And who is this orange guy over here?
- That's Venus.

163
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,879
That's Venus.
Where's Earth?

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,754
- Earth is this one.
- There's Earth.

165
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,398
Mr Vincent Barnes, we have not
received your class's registration cards
for Curtis High School--

166
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,397
For the workshop.

167
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,876
- See Mrs Moran at the exhibit.
- Excuse me for a minute.

168
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,795
Sean?

169
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,151
Sean?

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,795
Brooklyn, Queens to my left, Bronx,
Manhattan and Staten lsland to my right.

171
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,629
- You're it.
- We ask you to stay with your boroughs.

172
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,591
- Teachers, please keep a head count.
- Sean.

173
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,109
What do you think, Kate?

174
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,117
Kate?

175
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,869
- Kate. The score.
- I-l-l scored it.

176
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,277
Sean?

177
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,915
Sean?

178
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,953
Sean?

179
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,395
- Cassandra, have you seen Sean?
- No. Kate, are you all right?

180
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,317
Okay.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,514
Sean.

182
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,033
Sean. Sean Mullen,
please come to the judge's stand.

183
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,315
Sean?

184
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,591
Oh, please, God.

185
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,508
He's probably just
bustin' chops, you know, 'cause
we wouldn't let him enter the contest.

186
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,437
Who didn't we call?

187
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,956
- Sean?
- You have E-mail.

188
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,880
- I have your son.
- Oh, Jesus!

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,673
- I want $2 million
in fifties and hundreds.
- Oh, God!

190
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,598
No consecutive
serial numbers.

191
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,790
No new bills.
No marked bills.

192
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,233
The money will fit into two Samsonite
hard-shell suitcases, model #260.

193
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,956
Do not involve the police or the FBl.
If you do, I will kill him.

194
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,356
Do not inform the media,
or I will kill him.

195
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,713
No tracking devices in the money
or the cases, or I will kill him.

196
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,391
You have 48 hours to get the money.
I will contact you.

197
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,152
Open your mouth. Open your mou--
Would you open your mouth now?

198
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,511
Open it. Swallow it.

199
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,876
You little prick.

200
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,758
- What are you doing?
- Why don't you just clean your shirt?

201
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,030
Look, we talked about this.

202
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,594
Oh, yeah. Forgot.

203
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,996
Bitch.

204
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,792
Kate. Kate! Who are you calling?
He said no police.

205
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,831
- Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
- He said he'd kill him
if you called the police.

206
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,075
- I can have the money inside 3 hours.
- Why did you leave him?

207
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,997
- Why did you leave him?
- I didn't.

208
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,669
I saw you.
You walked away.

209
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,277
All right.

210
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,756
- All right, I'm calling the police.
- Call the FBl.

211
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,758
- For Christ's sake,
just let me pay this bastard.
- Tom, please, call the FBl.

212
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,519
Kate, the FBI just spent
three months trying to bury us.

213
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,030
- Do you think they give
a good goddam about you or me or--
- Tom, they know us.

214
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,913
They know us. Please.

215
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,233
All right.

216
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,230
- Lennon Paints.
- Wait. What? What?
- We're the painters.

217
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,238
Yeah, we're goin' to
the Mullen apartment. Uh, we're
just finishin' work on the library.

218
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,954
Oh, yes. Yeah. I get this call.
Go ahead. Okay.

219
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,516
- Behind you.
- Mr and Mrs Mullen are waiting for you.
- Thank you.

220
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,677
Uh, Mr Mullen, how are you?
Lonnie. Hawkins.

221
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,872
-Uh, we got Kimba Welch, Jack Sickler...
-How do you do?
-How are you, sir?

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,309
- David Levin, Ron Lambert.
- How do you do?

223
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,715
- Find the phone panel.
- Fatima, could you show these gentlemen
everything they want to know?

224
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,674
- Paul.
- Who's sweepin'?

225
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,518
- And this is Paul Rhodes.
- How do you do?

226
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,269
- Hi. How you doing?
- This here is as close as
we could get to a look-alike.

227
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,870
- Oh, I see.
- Now, look, Mr Mullen, I'm not
allowed to advise you on this...

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,434
- but if you decide to pay the money--
- It's here. It's right over here.

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,468
- This the money?
- Yeah, $2 million.

230
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,195
- Well, Paul here can make
the drop for you.
- Sure, sure.

231
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,117
- Tom?
- Yeah, David?

232
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,037
- Bob's got some stuff
for you right here.
- Tom, this is all I could get...

233
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,628
- from the National Center
for Missing Children.
- Good, good.

234
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,194
- Uh, Agent Hawkins,
this is David Torres.
- Pleased to meet you.

235
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,153
- What about the electric files?
- Where's your phone panel, Mrs Mullen?

236
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,635
- I-l have no idea.
- That's okay. We'll find it.

237
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,834
You know, what I don't
understand is these people--
this he, she, it, whoever--

238
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,270
has got enough brains to snatch
my son right from under my nose...

239
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,197
but they only ask me
for $2 million.

240
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,791
- Don't they know what I'm worth?
- No, no. He's being smart, okay?

241
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,115
Keepin' it nice
and simple for you.

242
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,630
Now, he knows you got it. Knows you
won't have a problem coughin' it up.

243
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,320
Maybe, uh, that's all he needs.

244
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,188
Uh, uh, can l-- can I just, uh--

245
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,119
Look, the-the reason
you're here and not the police...

246
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,391
is that we, my wife and l, we believe
that this might be somehow connected...

247
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,354
- with the, uh, machinists'
union indictments.
- Okay.

248
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,233
So, uh, Jackie Brown.

249
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,351
The man was caught on tape
takin' a pay-off...

250
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,677
during contract negotiations
with another airline, uh, lnfinite Air.

251
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,360
It was a sting, okay?
So there he is, dead in the water.

252
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,630
He says to your people,
"Can we do something here?"

253
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,832
And, uh, so he offers me up.

254
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,757
Yeah, he said Tom gave him
a quarter of a million dollars...

255
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,791
for a sweetheart deal
with the union.

256
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,836
Now, I have been investigated
exhaustively; me, my company,
my-my family. My family.

257
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,999
We've been dragged through
the tabloid mud, courtesy of FBI leaks,
and nothing. All right? Nothing.

258
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,430
Now Jackie Brown's in jail
where he belongs, and he's pissed,
and I think he's got some pretty
unsavoury associates out there.

259
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,348
- Uh, Mr Mullen, obviously we're
very aware of the Jackie Brown
situation, Mr Mull--
- An-And?

260
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,313
- We're still working on it.
- Jesus Christ, I think you
should pay a little more attention.

261
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,556
- We're paying-- No.
Can I make a suggestion, Mr Mullen?
- What? What?

262
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,559
Now, we are going to get
into all of this in time,
but for now, just hang loose.

263
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,717
- Just sit tight so we can get a plan--
- Hang loose? Hang loose?
Sit tight? Which one?

264
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,070
Tom, just let him finish.

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,272
- No, it's okay. It's okay.
No, look, look.
- I'm sorry.

266
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,073
If this were my child,
I'd be the same way. Believe me.

267
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,555
It's not a problem at all.

268
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,430
All right, kid, I know
this is hard on you, all right?

269
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,278
But you gotta hang in there.

270
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,549
- How many kidnappings
have you worked before?
- All together, 33.

271
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,639
Uh, now you take away the custodial,
gang, drug-related, I've worked ten.

272
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,673
Now, that's ten traditional,
ransom-oriented abductions
in the last five years.

273
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,349
Now, that's a lot. Believe it or not,
this kind of thing is kind of rare.

274
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,109
Well, um, out of the ten,
how many did you get back?

275
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,037
Got back seven.

276
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,719
Well, the others.
What, um, went wrong?

277
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,753
Oh, life.
What we call the "X" factor.

278
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,269
What's the "X" factor?
What is that?

279
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,197
- Are we set?
- No!

280
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,788
Shit, Jack!

281
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,354
Any demands that come up,
now, you just agree.

282
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,711
Let him know he's in charge. Your only
priority is getting your boy back.

283
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,593
Get your boy back.
You follow me?

284
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,517
Now, you've got to give us
some time, Mr Mullen.

285
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,835
You ask to speak to your son.
Ask for some sign that he's alive.

286
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,590
Any information you can get.
Then tell him he has an allergy,
he has, uh, some medical condition.

287
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,349
You want to know what kind of weather
is he in. Is he indoors? ls he outdoors?

288
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,516
- Are we set?
- Go!

289
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,835
- Get your boy back.
- Okay.

290
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,713
Hello?

291
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,631
Cancel it.

292
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,709
We got it. Brenda Chance,
4108 Utopia Parkway.

293
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,711
That's his secretary.

294
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,070
Yeah, we know.

295
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,431
Is our son dead?

296
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,357
Don't ever think that.

297
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,713
Open your mouth.
It's all right. It's food.

298
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,712
So, why can't you starve
in the desert?

299
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,469
'Cause of all
the sandwiches there.

300
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,395
What are you doin'?

301
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,756
What the--

302
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,838
- Voters on Manhattan's East Side...
- What are you thinkin'?

303
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,757
- will be headed to the polls tomorrow--
- What the hell is going on?

304
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,711
I was tellin' the kid a joke.
What's the big deal?

305
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,355
You like this kid? You wanna get to know
him? Get a little relationship goin'?

306
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,710
You think that's gonna make
things easier or harder?

307
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,718
- Make what easier, Maris?
- Is he for real?

308
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,876
- Yeah, I'm for real, bitch.
Are you for real?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

309
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,276
Whoa! Whoa. Why don't you
just back off, all right?

310
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,231
You step up,
and I'll back off.

311
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,639
Come here.

312
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,433
Listen to me. Look.

313
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,509
With the candy bars and shit--

314
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,279
It's just that you might be makin' beds
in a burnin' house.

315
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,592
You understand what I'm sayin'?

316
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,712
Yeah, but, Clark, man,
the kid's in a cocoon.

317
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,400
And he can't ID anybody.

318
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,239
What the hell
he's supposed to tell 'em?

319
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,996
Wait a goddam second, man.
Clark, you never said nothin'
to me about killin' no kids!

320
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,315
Do you understand
what is goin' on now?

321
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,113
You do not joke with this kid. You don't
play with him. You don't talk to him.

322
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,037
- Don't talk to my brother, all right?
- He is not your pet.

323
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,991
- This is real.
- You don't gotta talk
to my brother, all right?

324
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,953
You got nothin' to say to him.
Who do you think you are? What do you--

325
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,719
- You think you're runnin' shit here?
- No, I'm not runnin' shit.
My man is runnin' shit.

326
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,115
- Oh. Your man. Right.
- But if I have a problem,
I'm going to address it.

327
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,435
- Yeah, I understand. All right.
- I gotta tell you, boys.

328
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,358
She's scarin'
the bejeepers outta me.

329
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,153
- And you're fuckin' drinkin' again.
- Well, that's okay, though...

330
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,272
see, 'cause I haven't
been drinkin' with the kid.

331
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,869
I have to tell you something
that I think you should know.

332
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,479
Okay.

333
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,198
I paid him off.

334
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,155
You understand I'm not a priest. I'm not
a psychiatrist. I'm not a lawyer.

335
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,272
Tom, this is not
a protected conversation.

336
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,356
I understand.

337
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,358
See, most guys at the top,
they've acquired their airline.

338
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,677
But not me, no, I built Endeavor
from the ground up.

339
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,315
And it's mine, and no bastard's
takin' it away from me.

340
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,069
No union, no government,
no gangster like Jackie Brown.

341
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,918
I initiated the bribe.
I had a business to run.

342
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,235
I had 2,000 employees,
God knows how many customers...

343
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,670
and I didn't have time
for a goddam machinists' strike.

344
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,035
So, after what I did--
what I proposed and, and carried out--

345
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,671
he's in jail and I'm not.

346
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,510
So my question to you is:
Did Jackie Brown take my son?

347
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,432
Do you wanna go ask him?

348
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,119
I been thinking about you.

349
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,269
- Where's my son?
- What?

350
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,631
Do you think that ending up
in this place is the worst thing
that can happen to you?

351
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,673
- What are you talkin' about?
- Where is my son?

352
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,358
Oh.

353
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,029
Somebody nabbed your kid...

354
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,119
and you think that it's me.

355
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,073
How?

356
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,953
I don't got no connections.

357
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,355
I don't got no friends.

358
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,517
I got no job.

359
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,835
I got no money.

360
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,713
And you, motherfucker,
are accusing me?

361
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,990
Hey! Hey, get off of him!

362
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,953
I got six of my own kids,
and I would die for every one of them.

363
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,312
- Get him outta here!
- And I haven't seen them since I got
locked up in here because of you!

364
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,590
- Get him outta here. Come on!
- Why aren't you in here? Huh?

365
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,995
You fuckin' belong in jail!
Who did you bribe?

366
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,510
- I ain't done with you,
you fuck! I'll kill you!
- Get him out! Get him outta there!

367
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,110
- Who'd you pay to set me up, you fuck?
- Get him outta here!

368
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,396
Come on. You tell me that again.
Say it again. Come on.

369
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,876
- I said that I wasn't
runnin' out this door--
- You weren't runnin'?

370
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,594
Damn, man. I said
I wasn't runnin' with him.

371
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,473
I was runnin' away from him
'cause he was, like, chasin' me.

372
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,034
Yeah, look me in the eye
and tell me that now.

373
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,754
- I was, I was runnin',
but I was runnin--
- Yeah, where were you goin'?
- Got the gat, Jimmy.

374
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,553
Huh? Whoa, whoa. Hey.
Look at that.

375
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,477
- You ever seen that before?
- Uh-uh.

376
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,034
- No? I'm not gonna find
your prints on there?
- No.

377
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,913
No? Bag that up.

378
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,674
Jimmy, uh, we got a problem here.
This guy doesn't want to close
his store right now.

379
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,791
Fuck it. Forget about it.
Now, tell me about your buddy.

380
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,115
Oh, man. Uh, I don't know.
I never saw him before.

381
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,515
- It was the first time I saw him.
- Here. Feel that.

382
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,359
- Christ, this thing's pumpin' Kool-Aid.
- Yeah, you got a heart problem, there?

383
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,552
- I was runnin'. I wasn't--
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

384
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,036
Wait. I smell a little bullshit here.
I think he's runnin' a game on me.

385
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,879
- I think he's an LAD.
- You a lyin'-ass dog?

386
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,436
- You got any, uh, Frankenberry
cereal with the marshmallows?
- The guy was chasin' me and l--

387
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,235
- Yo, you get me a lawyer, all right?
- You get your own fuckin' lawyer.

388
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,357
Yo, man, these cuffs
are too tight, man.

389
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,199
That's cause they're new.
They'll stretch. You gotta
give them a little time.

390
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,915
- Get in the car. You want a pizza?
You want a hot dog? What do you want?
- Here you go, Jimmy.

391
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,157
- Thanks.
- Let's go back to the house.

392
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,437
Are you a known scumbag in
this precinct or not? Shake your head.

393
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,516
Go on.

394
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,155
Now, a high-profile kid
got snatched yesterday.

395
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,308
You have no idea who knows
about it, huh? NYPD, FBl. Do you?

396
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,591
Shake your head.

397
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,154
No. So what do you do?

398
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,400
You, a known scumbag, walks into
a grocery store filled with cops...

399
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,317
and you ask for a box
of kiddie cereal.

400
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,115
I don't know about you, but I think
that makes you a four-star asshole.

401
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,470
What do you think?

402
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,910
What the hell were you
gonna do with the videos? Huh?

403
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,998
The kid's got tape on his eyes,
for Christ's sake.

404
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,951
I thought he could
listen to 'em.

405
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,551
Don't be stupid again.

406
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,793
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

407
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,195
I was just dreamin' about you.

408
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,232
- Was it good?
- Mm-mmm.

409
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,753
No. My father was back,
and then he was beating me up again.

410
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,476
And then you were there,
but you-- you didn't do anything.

411
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,591
You were just standing
there and watching.

412
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,315
Yeah, well, you know
that's just a dream.

413
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,591
- I locked his ass up, remember?
- Yeah. I know.

414
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,828
Where you been, man?
I'm goin' out of my mind here, you know.

415
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,269
Hey, it's all right.

416
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,198
These guys--
These guys are wacko.

417
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,629
They don't listen to me.
They don't respect me.

418
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,354
- I don't trust them.
- Don't worry about them.
They're afraid of me.

419
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,029
- Why do we need them? Why?
- We can't do this alone.

420
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,594
And the kid.
I'm scared shit of this kid.

421
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,517
I think we should just do this now.
Get rid of him.

422
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,236
- Get it over with,
'cause he's like a time bomb.
- Hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

423
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,354
You think you're scared
of the kid, but you--
you know what you're really scared of?

424
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,790
Your own humanity.

425
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,356
Your own decency.

426
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,389
'Cause you're good, and that's okay.
That's all right.

427
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,398
That's what I need from you.

428
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,949
When the time comes, the kid's
my problem, not yours. All right?

429
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,196
Well, you still trust me, don't you?

430
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,440
Yeah? 'Cause you know
I can do this, right?

431
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,790
- Yeah.
- Right?
- Yeah.

432
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,069
Good.

433
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,156
'Cause it's time to get paid.

434
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,155
- Is there anything in the reports?
- Yeah.

435
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,834
A lot of stuff we already know.

436
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,428
A lot of stuff we don't know.

437
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,314
Stuff you don't want to know.

438
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,750
You know, you tell yourself--
No, you lie to yourself...

439
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,318
that, uh, you're doing all this...

440
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,873
for your family.

441
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,468
Security, money, the future.

442
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,229
All this-this-this king
of the mountain bullshit.

443
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,796
It's bullshit.

444
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,152
I keep seeing him tied up like that
with those handcuffs, and, uh...

445
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,350
I can't help him.

446
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,034
I can't help him. I can't--

447
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,358
- It's upstairs.
- Kate, where's Tom? Come on, now.

448
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,268
Let's do this.
Come on. Come on.

449
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,868
- Comin' in.
- All right, here they come.
Here they come.

450
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,991
Remember the drill. Jack!

451
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,037
Hello?

452
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,435
- Mr Mullen?
- Yes.

453
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,711
- Are you good to go?
- Am l-- Am l-- Am I what?

454
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,590
Get in the car and drive.
96th Street West. Come alone.

455
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,915
Take the Westside Highway North.

456
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,191
I'm-- I-l-l don't have the money yet.
Not yet. But I need more time.

457
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,276
- I'll get it. I-l just--
- Don't fuck with me.

458
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,231
I want, I want to talk to my son.

459
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,510
- Come alone.
- Wait. Hold on, uh. S--

460
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,518
Uh, Sean has asthma.
Uh, it's very serious.

461
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,473
So, what's the weather like?

462
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,750
Is it rainy? Damp?

463
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,559
Is he in a cellar?
On a mountaintop?

464
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,673
Please, don't.
My son gets vertigo.

465
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,997
- How's the linguist
doing with my accent?
- The w-what? The ling--

466
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,315
N-- Hey, there's no one here.
Just me.

467
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,994
- Are you sure?
- Hey, you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

468
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,476
- I want to get this over with.
- Very good.

469
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,319
- Let's keep it that way.
- So how do I get my son back?

470
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,113
- Are you going to pay me?
- Of course I am.

471
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,311
Then it shouldn't be a problem.

472
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,159
- He'll call you.
- He'll-- When? Who? No, you'll call?
He'll call me?

473
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,555
- When?
- 96th Street. Come alone.

474
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,754
- Goddam it!
- Yes. Sweet and pretty.

475
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,189
They jammed us.
Everything's frozen.

476
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,471
Um, did you get it? Where--
Where did you trace it to?

477
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,556
They crashed the computer.

478
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,791
- Did I pick the right guy or what?
- Yeah.

479
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,797
- Huh? What'd I tell you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,673
We're gonna get it.

481
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,997
- Let's get Paul wired up.
- Whoa, whoa. I'll do it.

482
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,909
I'll do it. Let me.

483
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,714
- He gonna be all right?
- He's gonna be great.

484
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,354
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

485
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,596
He better be.

486
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,474
I got a situation here. Legally,
I can't stop you from doing this.

487
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,511
Understand that this guy--
I don't know where he's coming from...

488
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,517
and I think he's a professional.

489
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,437
Now, if he starts throwing us
curve balls out there...

490
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,633
we are gonna have to improvise,
and we might not be able
to protect you, Mr Mullen.

491
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,435
I think it would be wiser if you just
let one of our guys make the drop.

492
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,438
- Ma-Maybe you shouldn't do it.
- Look, I'm okay. I'm okay, really.

493
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,438
I-- I just want to give him
what he expects.

494
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,233
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

495
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,352
Look. It's almost over, kid.

496
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,711
I'm gonna get you back
with your parents. Promise.

497
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,195
- When?
- Soon.
- When?

498
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,789
When?

499
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,753
-There are tracking devices in the bags.
-Monty wants the packages--

500
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,677
- Do you have any other questions?
- All right, the car's completely wired.

501
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,633
- Any problems, we'll be right there.
- He said I was to come alone.

502
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,478
- All we're doin' is
following the money, Tom.
- Okay.

503
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,113
- We'll always be a safe distance away.
- Okay.

504
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,037
Listen. Let me give you a tip.

505
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,310
This here's a business
transaction. All right?

506
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,112
You're a businessman.
He's a businessman.

507
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,674
You think of this as business,
you'll be fine.

508
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,077
All right?

509
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,037
Get him back.

510
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,430
CP to S.O. units. All units
converge on 269 West 125 Street.

511
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,552
500 Unit to CP.
We have a visual on the package.

512
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,312
Yeah?

513
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,829
Okay, listen up.
I'm only gonna say this once.

514
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,475
Get off at 125th Street,
go right three blocks...

515
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,909
to the Kasarda Rec Center.

516
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,794
- Take the suitcases inside with you.
- Son of a bitch is scrolling us.

517
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,959
In the swimming pool, there's
a locker key down by the drain...

518
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,196
in the deep end.

519
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,356
There'll be somebody watching you.

520
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,311
You won't see them,
but they'll see you.

521
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,829
I want you to get that key.

522
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,793
I want you fully clothed
when you do.

523
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,198
You so much as remove
your wristwatch, your son dies.

524
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,029
When you have the key,
go find the locker.

525
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,549
- You got seven minutes.
- All right, I'll do everything you say.

526
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,591
I just need you to repeat it
so I could be very clear.

527
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,632
- Seven minutes.
- To do what? To get there?
To jump in the pool?

528
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,673
Goddam it. Ah, Jesus.

529
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,597
- We got it.
- He what?

530
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,314
- Blocked out the trace.
Should we pull it?
- No.

531
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,556
Run the trace again.

532
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,911
All right, let's start
dumping hackers and phreakers
in the profile. Anybody high tech.

533
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,113
Uh, we'll cross match that with military
background, police background...

534
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,152
uh, security training,
uh, hostage negotiations.

535
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,512
- Where's the pool?
- It's over there.

536
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,518
Hands in front of you.
Hands straight out.

537
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,712
Hands to the side. Push.
Hands in front.

538
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,637
Hands up.

539
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,951
Hands in front of you.

540
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,279
Shit! We lost him.

541
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,628
Damn it.

542
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,997
Track all unsubs
that exit the building.

543
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,194
You're going too slow.
Get your ass moving.

544
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,595
Now, put on the hat
and the overalls.

545
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,518
Take the canvas bags downstairs
to the boiler room.

546
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,712
Use the stairs by the shower.

547
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,559
Put the money into the new bags.

548
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,513
Then leave the building
and find a Monte Carlo.

549
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,313
There's a key taped
to the phone.

550
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,749
Leave the phone with the suitcases
and drive to the Holland Tunnel.

551
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,474
We'll be watching you, Tom.

552
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,508
We're getting a reading on
those suitcases. They haven't moved.

553
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,710
Tell the S.O. Ieader
I want that building cleared.

554
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,193
500 to S.O. units.
We got an eyeball. We got the car.

555
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,992
The car has not moved.

556
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,749
S.O. 15 to CP.
Located the packages. They're empty.

557
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,396
Sir, we've got four vehicles ID'd in the
perimeter, one with a broken taillight.

558
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,637
Put out a description
of those vehicles.

559
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,671
Have all units grid out
and locate them.

560
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,714
Pick me up, asshole.

561
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,037
Now what?

562
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,390
So how you holding up?
Did you have a nice swim?

563
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,034
Not bad. How're you doing?

564
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,311
Hey, I'm good. I'm good.
You know, thanks for asking.

565
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,150
- How's Sean?
- Havin' the time of his life.

566
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,272
Hey, I saw your TV commercial.
It's not bad. It's pretty good.

567
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,960
But let me ask you something.
You got a frequent flyer programme?

568
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,878
'Cause if you do,
maybe when this is over...

569
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,230
I might just take an Endeavor flight
the hell outta here.

570
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,351
Why? Why me?

571
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,277
Why you?

572
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,790
'Cause you buy your way
out of trouble.

573
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,549
Don't you? I read about you
and that union guy.

574
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,276
You should've gone to jail
for that, but I guess you're
a pretty goddam good liar, huh?

575
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,396
I saw you on TV, Tom...

576
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,512
telling everybody
how innocent you were.

577
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,518
I looked at your eyes.

578
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,555
You know what?
You're a lyin'-ass dog, pal.

579
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,990
I know you paid that guy off.

580
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,076
You're a payer.

581
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,794
You did it once.

582
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,354
Now you're gonna do it again.

583
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,753
- You okay?
- Yeah.

584
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,950
- Listen, Cub. You want me to do this?
- Jimmy said me.

585
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,038
- Fuck what Jimmy said.
- Look, I know the job, man.

586
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,714
Clark, man.

587
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,515
I ain't giving Jimmy
the money until he cuts the kid loose.

588
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,475
I-- I just ain't
gonna do it, man.

589
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,194
What are you-- Cub.

590
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,837
You a movie fan, Tom?

591
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,229
- Ever see that movie The Time Machine?
- No.

592
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,113
It's the, uh,
land of the future, right?

593
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,789
There's only two kinds
of people in the world now:

594
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,992
the Morlocks and the Eloi.

595
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,476
- Okay.
- And the Elois, they live above ground.

596
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,160
They wear togas.
They're all blond.

597
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,191
They eat grapes
and shit like that.

598
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,117
But it's like
the Garden of Eden there.

599
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,519
I mean, basically, everybody
just lays around, listens to harp music.

600
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,473
- How do I get my boy back?
- Now, the Morlocks...

601
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,916
they live underground, right?

602
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,636
Big, hairy, ugly suckers
like you wouldn't wish on an ape, right?

603
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,718
They're down there with all this
machinery. They're doing all the labour.

604
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,755
They're making sure that the Elois
have enough food and-- and togas.

605
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,953
- Are you gonna answer me?
- Well, this is a great deal
if you're an Eloi, right?

606
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,753
There's only one thing.

607
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,633
Every once in a while,
a Morlock comes up to the surface...

608
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,231
and snatches an Eloi,
takes him down there.

609
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,796
All right, I'm done driving 'til
you tell me what I want to know.

610
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,718
The Morlocks,
they don't eat grapes.

611
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,116
They're cannibals.
They eat Elois.

612
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,876
So when I think about,
uh, The Time Machine...

613
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,673
it kind of reminds me
of New York City, you know?

614
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,598
See, you're an Eloi.

615
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,154
You and all your friends,
walking around like zombies...

616
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,192
with no fuckin' idea of the shit
goin' on down below.

617
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,748
So does this make me a Morlock?

618
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,469
I don't like to think
of myself like--

619
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,830
I guess it does.

620
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,078
And every once in a while,
one of you gets snatched.

621
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,549
I guess that's--

622
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,631
See ya.

623
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,639
What a city.
See you at the Whitney.

624
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,800
See you at the Four Seasons.

625
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,957
See you at the Met. See ya.

626
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,110
See you.

627
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,037
See you.

628
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,549
- You on the move again, Tom?
- Yeah.

629
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,593
Okay, here we go.
About a mile up ahead, the road splits.

630
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,679
Take the exit onto Saddle River Road,
go to the stone quarry.

631
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,030
Drive ten miles an hour.

632
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,958
I'm jumpin' through all your goddam
hoops. How am I gonna get my boy back?

633
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,595
We'll swap. You give me the bags,
I'll give you an address.

634
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,560
Good luck to you, laddie.

635
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,279
Get back in the fucking car!

636
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,630
Now, throw out the keys.

637
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,276
Give me the money, man.

638
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,436
- Give me the address.
- Give me the fuckin' money, man!

639
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,712
- You said you were gonna
give me the address.
- What?

640
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,992
Do you want to see your kid again, man?
Then give me the money!

641
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,237
Goddam it! Give me
that address, goddam you!

642
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,193
- Don't be fuckin' stupid, man!
- This is the FBl.

643
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,039
Drop the gun and step away
from the vehicle.

644
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,835
- Put your hands in the air.
Step away from the vehicle.
- Son of a bitch!

645
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,078
- Mullen, stay back. Get down.
- CP, need some help here.

646
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,111
He's surrounded.
We've gone overt.

647
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,630
We have one subject
on the ground operating an ATV.

648
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,513
A white male armed
with a handgun, and he's got--

649
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,677
- We have an eye on him.
- Good.
- Who is that?

650
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,675
Come on, Cubby. Come on, Cubby.

651
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,472
- Stop, or we'll shoot.
- Get off the vehicle and lie down.

652
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,397
You have no way out.

653
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,829
You are surrounded.
Give yourself up.

654
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,190
- This is the FBl.
- You've got nowhere to go.

655
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,515
We have agents on the ground.

656
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,635
This is your last warning.

657
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,918
Surrender yourself now!

658
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,554
This is the FBl.

659
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,194
There is nowhere to go.

660
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,517
Drop the gun. Stop at once.

661
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,675
Move! Move!

662
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,031
SWAT Team Leader to CP.
We have deployed. We're movin' in.

663
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,277
Got a green light!
Take him out!

664
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,357
Oh, shit.

665
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,359
SWAT Team Leader to CP. We have
an agent down. We have a subject down.

666
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,470
Who got shot?
Who the hell was shot?

667
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,674
Where is he?
What have you done with him?

668
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,674
What?

669
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,598
Say it. Come on.

670
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,075
- Stand back. Come on. Step back.
- No, no, he--

671
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,395
- He's trying to tell me something.
- Look, back off. Let us stabilize him.

672
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,239
- Medic!
- He's trying to tell me
where my son is. I'm sure of it.

673
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,750
What are you people do--
I did not authorize this!

674
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,395
- We're here under orders.
- That fucking liar!

675
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,431
- Oh, we're losin' him.
- Don't let him die.

676
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,755
Jesus Christ, don't let him die.
God, don't let him die.

677
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,114
- Come on, man.
Don't give up. Don't give up.
- Get the choppers.

678
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,629
Stay with him. Come on.

679
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,033
- Shit!
- What?

680
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,515
Ten-seven, sir.

681
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,597
He's dead.

682
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,510
How-- How am I
gonna find Sean now?

683
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,432
You killed my son.

684
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,949
SWAT Team Leader to CP.
We're movin' out.

685
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,640
S.O. Leader, you've got it.

686
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,552
Give me as much as you can.
This guy's got to be on parole,
probation, something.

687
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,558
- Get the name of--
- I told you no cops.
- Ah, jeez!

688
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,438
- You were supposed to follow the money!
- They were following the money, Tom.

689
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,835
The guy had a gun in your face.
They didn't have a choice.

690
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,632
They thought you were
in direct danger.

691
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,320
What does that mean? What does-- What
does "wrong" mean? I mean, is he dead?

692
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,830
Because if he's dead,
just say he's dead.
Don't tell me something went wrong.

693
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,794
- Just say my son is dead!
- Kate, we are operating
under the assumption that he's alive.

694
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,435
You mean you don't know! You don't know
where he is! You don't know if he is!

695
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,120
You're the goddam FBl,
and you don't know shit!

696
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,708
- We have every agent-- every agent--
- You killed the son of a bitch
and now-- What?

697
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,149
- Katie. Katie.
- Get-- God!

698
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,318
Go. Go away. Go. Go.

699
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,119
We know that the kidnapper
at the quarry was not alone.

700
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,879
We know that.

701
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,232
We also have a real good idea
about who he was teamed up with.
Now, let me show you something.

702
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,477
The guy at the quarry, Cubby Barnes,
has been in jail twice for burglary.

703
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,636
This is no high-tech mastermind.

704
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,356
This guy right here--
Kate, Tom, you recognize him?

705
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,118
- Do you?
- No.
- Okay.

706
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,437
Now, this is Clark Barnes,
brother to the subject.

707
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,599
Now, we went back and we found him
in your son's video of the park.

708
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,950
This guy is the brains
in the family...

709
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,277
and we also know he's a lot higher up
the criminal food chain.

710
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,790
According to the NYPD,
this guy Clark, his brother Cubby,
they're supposed to be inseparable.

711
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,229
Now, I guarantee you,
we are gonna do our homework on this...

712
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,191
and we will come up
with another player.

713
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,390
In the meantime,
what we gotta do--

714
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,715
Aw, Christ. Not this shit.

715
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,149
- We got a cameraman.
- Jack.

716
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,589
Can we get some agents out there?

717
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,757
- This just in. A breaking story
from our New York bureau.
- Lonnie. It's out.

718
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,273
State police sources tell us
a man has been shot and killed
in an apparent botched ransom drop.

719
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,678
There's also word
that multimillionaire airline mogul
Tom Mullen has been placed at the scene.

720
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,268
With more on that story,
let's go to Donna Hanover live...

721
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,914
-in front of Tom Mullen's New York home.
-Goddam.
-Donna.

722
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,793
We have no official report yet
on the identity of the victim...

723
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,354
or his role in
the Sean Mullen kidnapping.

724
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,313
Hopefully, we'll have more information
for you later in this hour...

725
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,149
but details have been slow to come
from the police and FBI sources.

726
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,111
We'll bring you full
developments tomorrow morning...

727
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,310
beginning with
Good Day, New York, and, of course...

728
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,908
- as things happen here at
the Mullen apartment building,
- Hey, wh-what are you doing?

729
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,429
- we'll bring you the information.
- Calling my mother.
- No, man, you can't do that.

730
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,950
- Not from this phone.
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Hey, hey, put the phone down.

731
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,073
What's the matter, Jimmy?
You don't want my mother to know that
her son's dead 'cause you fucked up?

732
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,590
-Turn that shit off.
-I mean, that's what happened, isn't it?

733
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,359
I mean, it's not exactly like
this guy just rolled over, is it, Jim?

734
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,358
Just take it easy.
Put the goddam phone down.

735
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,958
He's a fuckin' kid.

736
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,877
Oh, shit!

737
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,834
Hey, hey, calm down.
Take it easy.

738
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,475
You want me to calm down, huh?
You want me to fucking calm down?

739
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,558
You realize they're looking for me
right now, Jimmy? I'm fingered!

740
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,592
- I can't go back to my life!
What do you want me to do? You tell me!
- Shut up.

741
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,951
- You tell me, huh?
- You know, you're not gonna
be able to go to your brother's
funeral either, man.

742
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,992
Shut the fuck up!
The kid goes in the ground, Jim.

743
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,190
That's it. That's it.
Fuck the money.

744
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,515
- We do the kid, and I'm outta here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

745
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,234
He's right. I mean,
you said you were gonna do it anyhow.

746
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,749
Shut up!

747
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,348
- Where are you goin'?
- Get out of my fuckin'--

748
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,591
Take a breath.

749
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,234
Come on, come on. Take a breath.

750
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,474
I brought you in on this
'cause you had brains and balls.

751
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,999
Think.

752
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,112
Hmm? The kid's gonna die...

753
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,470
when we don't need him any more.

754
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,115
Now, use your fuckin' head.

755
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,155
Go check on the kid.

756
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,190
It's all right. Go on.

757
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,117
Go on.

758
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,956
They kill your brother,
and you wanna walk away?

759
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,116
What the hell does that make you?

760
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,435
This thing is not over.

761
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,915
I swear to you right now...

762
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,589
now, more than ever...

763
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,030
this guy will pay.

764
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,354
Can I have a chocolate bar?

765
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,953
- I know you.
- No, you don't.

766
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,913
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.

767
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,032
Chocolate bar. What,
do you think this isn't happening?

768
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,913
What, you think your dad's gonna come in
and save you? ls that what you think?

769
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,474
Well, he ain't.
Nobody's comin', all right?

770
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,910
You understand that? Nobody's comin',
'cause this is it for you.

771
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,993
...surfacing surrounding
the high-profile kidnapping case
of Tom Mullen's son, Sean.

772
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,556
- New York One has
exclusive information about--
- You know what the brothers call this?

773
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,069
This is "more drama," right?

774
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,479
Like, "Shit, man, more drama?
Best stay indoors today."

775
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,717
You ever hear that?
"More drama."

776
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,196
More drama. More Dramamine.

777
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,153
Drambuie.

778
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,795
- You all right?
- No, yeah. Yeah, good.

779
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,717
Yeah.

780
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,350
- Kimba, listen to this.
- It shouldn't be a problem.
- That.

781
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,472
After "lt shouldn't be
a problem," what do you hear?

782
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,795
Wait. Play it back again.

783
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,235
- It shouldn't be a problem.
- It sounds like some kind of horn.

784
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,432
Yeah, I know it's a horn,
but what-- It's like--

785
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:32,111
- It's like there's a horn,
a sort of foghorn.
- It's too fast for a ferry.

786
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,916
It shouldn't be a problem.

787
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,795
In the meantime,
now you give her a big hug from me.

788
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,559
Nah, I don't care.
You wake her up.

789
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,035
Nah, don't wake her up.
I'm just--

790
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,948
Ah, girl, I am so glad
we are not rich.

791
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,312
You just gotta thank God
for what you have.

792
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,193
I love you too. I gotta go.
I'm gonna call you back.

793
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,869
Okay. Bye-bye. Hey.

794
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,757
Why--

795
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,549
Why would this guy, these people--
Why would they--

796
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,829
Why would they ever let
my son go no matter what I do?

797
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,636
I mean, no matter what I do.
I mean, pay, don't pay, comply,
tell him to go fuck himself.

798
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,637
Why would they give him back?

799
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,910
I mean, he's a witness
any way you cut it.

800
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,477
It's all bullshit. It's all just--
just seven out of ten.

801
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,750
What are you saying?

802
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,277
All right.

803
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,029
Morlock Man gets his money,
I don't think we'll ever see Sean again.

804
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,116
That's if he's still alive
to begin with.

805
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,878
- Well, now...
- Tom?

806
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,797
are you talkin' about not paying?

807
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,037
- No. No, we pay him.
- Now, wait a minute. Listen to me.

808
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,675
Morlock Man says the pick-up guy
will give me an address for Sean.

809
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,234
I get there, the guy
sticks a gun in my face.

810
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,157
I said, "You want the money? Now give me
the address. Where's the address?"

811
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,350
You should have seen his face.

812
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,075
He had no, absolutely no idea
what I was talking about. None.

813
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,909
- Okay.
- This is not business to him.
This is very personal.

814
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,191
I tell you that everybody pays,
and we get back seven out of ten.

815
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,472
- If we give him what he wants,
he will kill Sean.
- Tom, you gotta play the odds, man.

816
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,160
I've been doing this
for 18 years.

817
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,353
And if I were a betting man,
I would bet on the people who pay
every time out of the gate.

818
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,159
Did you bet on the ones
where you got back a corpse?

819
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,433
Kate.

820
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,353
If you want to see your child again...

821
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,836
you gotta help me with him.

822
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,438
- Stations!
- Mark it.

823
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,394
-Mullen.
-You think you can run a game on me
and fuck me out of my money?

824
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,875
No, l--

825
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,231
It was out of my control.
I did exactly what you said.

826
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,510
You did?

827
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,757
This is how you want to play it, huh?
You're gonna bullshit me, Tom?

828
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,836
Who do you think
you're dealin' with?

829
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,793
They told you they were
just gonna follow the cash, right? Huh?

830
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,070
Who's the asshole
you're listening to over there?

831
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,397
Is he a fed? I said no cops.

832
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,274
No FBl. You pay me.
It shouldn't be a problem.
Now we got a fuckin' circus out there.

833
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,595
All right. Just say
what you want to say.

834
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,075
- The money.
- I want to talk to my son.

835
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,033
Take the FDR Drive down
to the Williamsburg Bridge exit.

836
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,790
- No. I know he's dead.
- You don't know shit.

837
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,515
- Take FDR Drive down
to the Williamsburg Bridge--
- My son is dead. Go to hell!

838
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,359
What did you do?
Tom, what did you do?

839
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,359
Oh, God. Please, God. Please, God.
Please, God. Please. Please, God.

840
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,312
Mullen.

841
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,476
- Dad?
- Sean?

842
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,597
Williamsburg Bridge.

843
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,837
And you assholes listening in, if
I smell you clowns within ten miles...

844
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,599
of that money,
I'll gut this kid like a fish.

845
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,637
Is there anything else
we can use?

846
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,272
Uh, give me Mr Wallace.

847
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,956
I'm going alone.

848
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,957
Is that understood?

849
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,356
No helicopters, no wires.
Just me.

850
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,200
- You got the phone?
- Yeah, I got the phone.

851
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,154
You gonna be all right?

852
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,999
- Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.
- Okay.

853
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,597
Hey, hey, here he comes.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

854
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,834
Mr Mullen! Mr Mullen!

855
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,191
- Mullen!
- Mr Mullen!
- Mr Mullen!

856
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,072
Mr Mullen-- It's not Mullen.

857
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,237
Let's go. That's him.

858
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,840
- Hey, John, keep shooting.
- Man, this is fucking great.

859
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,597
Hey!

860
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,557
Come on!

861
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,034
Endeavor Airline CEO
Tom Mullen and his family...

862
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,754
are no strangers
to the public eye.

863
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,996
As head of the country's
fourth largest airline...

864
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,590
Tom Mullen, whose personal stake in the
company was reported earlier this year--

865
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,232
But nothing in his triumphant,
high-profile life...

866
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,477
could prepare Mullen for the drama
presently unfolding around him--

867
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,639
the taking of his nine-year-old son
by unidentified kidnappers.

868
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:31,119
- Where are you at now?
- I don't know.

869
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,596
Head up to Houston and Broadway.

870
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,279
- But for now, the city and
the country anxiously await word--
- You hear me?

871
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,950
Mullen?

872
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,875
- Change of plan.
- What?

873
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,958
Turn on your TV.
Channel 5. Keep watching.

874
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,913
It shouldn't be more
than an hour or two.

875
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,915
You understand
what I'm telling you?

876
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,837
Mullen, what the fuck--

877
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,155
It's mine. Hello?

878
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,592
David, I need you
to contact Don Campbell at WNYW.

879
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,720
- All right.
- Good.

880
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,515
- Bob, can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

881
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,670
David.

882
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,316
- All right, here we go.
- Okay, they're ready.

883
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,671
Pull out of it.
All right, everyone. Look alive.

884
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,555
Mr Mullen, we're gonna
get you set up right over here.
We'll get you wired up with a mike.

885
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,150
I will signal to you
from next to the camera.

886
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,033
Ready to go? On five, four...

887
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,879
three, two--

888
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,073
Good afternoon.
We are interrupting this programme
to bring you an exclusive report.

889
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,318
As you know, we've been
following the Mullen kidnapping
for about a day or so.

890
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,432
We will get back to
our regular programme, but right now
we're going to show you something...

891
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,630
that you will only see
right here--

892
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,115
Tom Mullen,
Sean Mullen's father.

893
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,959
Mr Mullen?

894
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,877
Tom, you're on.

895
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,112
The whole world now knows...

896
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,549
my son, Sean Mullen, was kidnapped...

897
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,796
for ransom three days ago.

898
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,480
This is a recent
photograph of him.

899
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,592
Sean, if you're watching,
we love you.

900
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,478
And this--

901
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,273
Well, this is what waits
for the man that took him.

902
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,231
This is your ransom.

903
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,191
Wait. Shh, shh.
I want to see this.

904
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,754
Two million dollars
in unmarked bills, just like you wanted.

905
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,998
- Oh-ho!
- But this is as close
as you'll ever get to it.

906
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19,192
You'll never see one dollar
of this money...

907
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,949
because no ransom will ever
be paid for my son.

908
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,799
Not one dime. Not one penny.

909
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,072
Instead, I'm offering this money
as a reward on your head.

910
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,438
Dead or alive.
It doesn't matter.

911
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,791
So congratulations. You've just
become a $2 million lottery ticket.

912
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,196
Except the odds
are much, much better.

913
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,312
Do you know anyone that wouldn't
turn you in for $2 million?

914
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,591
I don't think you do.
I doubt it.

915
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,918
So wherever you go and whatever you do,
this money will be tracking you
down for all time.

916
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,191
And to ensure that it does,
to keep interest alive...

917
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,359
I'm running a full-page ad
in every major newspaper every Sunday...

918
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,357
for as long as it takes.

919
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,598
But-- and this is
your last chance--

920
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,679
if you return my son
alive, uninjured...

921
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,438
I'll withdraw the bounty.

922
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,996
With any luck,
you can simply disappear.

923
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:20,194
Understand-- you will never see
this money. Not one dollar.

924
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,710
So you still have a chance
to do the right thing.

925
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,153
If you don't, well, then God
be with you because nobody else
on this Earth will be.

926
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,555
Well, he's got nerve.

927
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,396
That's it.

928
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,795
Well, there you have it, Rosanna.
A shocking turn of events.

929
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,309
The ransom has turned
into a $2-million bounty.

930
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,795
Tony, it's obviously
a very dangerous situation.

931
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,673
Anything could happen. Of course,
we wish him the best of luck.

932
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:54,191
Did you notice he,
uh, described the kidnapper
as a $2 million lottery ticket?

933
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,834
- The stakes are high on this one.
- Yeah, as you mentioned also--

934
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,153
- Could you turn it off?
Could you turn it off?
- Mr Mullen also appealed to his son.

935
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,748
He said, "Sean, if you're
out there listening, I love you."

936
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,519
- It was very heartbreaking.
- Also, our producer is telling me, uh--

937
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,631
- Yeah.
- Mullen, you're a fool!

938
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,557
Stupid ass!

939
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,391
I'm proud of you!

940
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,078
A pair of armed bandits
held 'em up last night.

941
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,273
Police say a pair of gun-toting crooks
went into the Korean church
at Murray Street...

942
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,391
in Flushing last night
and announced a robbery.

943
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,159
- They took wallets, handbags--
- Hey, where'd they take the kid?

944
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,475
You know. The place we said.

945
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,672
I had to do this.

946
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,950
You had to do this?

947
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,678
You had to do this?

948
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,678
Kate, please.

949
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,509
I'm so scared, but I know if
I give him the money, he'll kill Sean.

950
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,154
- I would if I was him.
- What did you just say?

951
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,236
Just look at it
from his point of view.

952
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,999
You think you're smart.
You've got everybody off balance.

953
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,714
- You think you've
got it all figured out.
- You tryin' to screw me?

954
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,150
And then suddenly,
out of left field, the one thing
you thought would never happen does.

955
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,111
- We gotta end this.
- What are you doin'?

956
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,198
No ransom, no money, no profit.
Nothing. Nothing but downside.

957
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:22,235
Because you've got this boy's father--
he's coming on like a stark,
raving mad lunatic.

958
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,796
- You turned her around, didn't you?
- I mean, the guy can piss $2 million...

959
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,036
- but he's willing to risk everything
just to fuck you up.
- Don't!

960
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,958
How can you negotiate with
a lunatic like that, huh? You can't.

961
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,992
- Now you're off balance.
- Get down. Lay down!

962
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,192
You wanna stay down there forever,
maggot? Did I get my money?

963
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,676
Pretty soon you realize if you don't
return this kid in mint condition
as soon as possible...

964
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,155
you're gonna be the most hunted man
on the face of the Earth.

965
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,432
And this maniac will never,
ever quit until he's got you.

966
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,597
Nobody pulls out on me.

967
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,188
You know me.

968
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,232
This is my show.
I say when it's over.

969
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,635
- Take it back.
- No.
- Tell him that you were wrong.

970
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,830
- Kate, no, I can't. No, Kate,
there is no other way. None.
- Take it back.

971
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,077
- He's my son too,
and I want you to pay him.
- Kate. They will kill him.

972
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,316
Please, all we have
is each other.

973
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,638
Do you think any of them--
Do you think they give-- It's just us.

974
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,035
Do you think I don't
want him back? ls that it?

975
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,515
You think I wouldn't do absolutely
everything in my power to get him back?

976
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,395
I'd cut my arm off.
I'd-- I want him back so bad.

977
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,990
Katie, please. I don't think
I can take this if you're not with me.

978
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,717
Don't quit on me.

979
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,718
Tom. Now--

980
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,793
I think what you did was wrong.

981
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,593
You put your son at greater risk.

982
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,553
Now, I need you
to withdraw that reward.

983
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,319
Just pay this bastard.

984
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,035
Now, I believe that
you will get your son back.

985
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:17,039
And when we do,
we will nail this son of a bitch.

986
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,990
Now, God forbid you don't...

987
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,917
your son--

988
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,952
I swear to you
I will work on nothing else.

989
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,355
If I have to, I will take
a leave of absence from the FBl...

990
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,994
and you can hire me as
your personal security consultant.

991
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,953
And I will work on this
as long as I am physically able.

992
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,877
- Lonnie, please. I--
- Tom.

993
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,434
I never told anybody,
any of my people...

994
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,758
about you and Jackie Brown, the real
truth of it, and maybe I never will.

995
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,880
You think I'm worried
about going to jail?

996
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,111
Mayor Barresi today voiced his
disapproval of Tom Mullen's decision.

997
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,277
- Donna Hanover joins us
later in the broadcast.
- You, uh, care for an update?

998
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,516
Oh, yeah.

999
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,077
Well, in the last two hours
since your husband's TV thing,
we've had 4,000 calls.

1000
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,716
- And you know how
many real, good, solid leads?
- How many?

1001
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,389
Zero. And every time
one of these...

1002
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,830
greedy little whack jobs calls...

1003
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,191
that is one less agent
looking for your child.

1004
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,550
Now, I gotta tell you, Kate.

1005
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,674
I have never been confronted with such
an unbelievable act of sabotage...

1006
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,711
by a parent toward
the recovery of their child...

1007
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,831
as what your husband
pulled off here today.

1008
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,795
It is all on you now to talk to your
husband, get him to withdraw this money.

1009
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,514
- Otherwise we are in deep trouble.
- Withdraw the mo-- What if he's right?

1010
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,031
What if they have no intention
of returning Sean at all?

1011
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,879
- I trust him.
- You trust him?

1012
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,197
Yeah. I believe in him.

1013
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,959
I stick with Tom...

1014
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,674
and we always manage
to land on high ground.

1015
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,672
High ground? Huh.

1016
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,751
Like with the Jackie Brown situation?

1017
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,311
Yeah.

1018
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,315
What exactly did
your husband tell you...

1019
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,556
about Jackie Brown?

1020
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,118
- David?
- Yeah.

1021
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,913
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

1022
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,033
Look, Hawkins said that if I can come up
with the $2 million, that he'd work it
so that I can make the drop.

1023
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,594
- Come on, Kate--
- Now, all I can raise is
about a half a million.

1024
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,836
I know you have access
to a discretionary fund.

1025
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,757
Kate. Jesus, please. Listen,
you should talk to Tom about this.

1026
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,111
- This isn't about Tom.
- Really.
- This is Sean.

1027
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,993
I'm doin' okay.
I'm holdin' up all right.

1028
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,997
Uh, Kate, l-l can't do it.
All right?

1029
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,951
I--

1030
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,837
He told you not to give me
any money, didn't he?

1031
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,554
Kate, he's my boss. Okay?

1032
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,517
Okay, eat this.

1033
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,757
Thank you.

1034
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,718
Again, I say if it
were my kid, I would pay.

1035
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,229
I like the idea, "Yeah, you want
the money, come and get it."

1036
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,999
And when he comes and gets it, I hope
somebody cuts their heads off, you know?

1037
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:46,636
I'd get my boys from the Bronx,
and we'd just totally--

1038
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,671
- Take care of him.
- We'd mess him up big time.

1039
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,314
I think he's risking
his son's life.

1040
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,749
I think he's a fool.
His child's life is in danger.

1041
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,677
Pay the money.
Get on with your life.

1042
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,588
I'd beg, borrow and steal,
if I had to. He should pay.

1043
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,517
What?

1044
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,871
- A man calls me at my home today.
- Mm-hmm.

1045
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,958
He ask me to look in my mailbox.

1046
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,436
He told me to give you this,
and nobody else.

1047
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,109
He said if the police
know anything about this...

1048
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,119
if Mr Mullen knows about this...

1049
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,834
they'll kill Sean.

1050
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,757
Okay.

1051
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,795
Who is it?

1052
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,149
Oh, God!

1053
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,630
It's very simple.

1054
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,116
I'm growing very, very tired
of this bullshit.

1055
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,915
- Then could you--
- Now it's up to you.

1056
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,350
Get him to take back the reward
and pay me my money...

1057
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:42,917
or you're gonna find pieces
of your little boy all over New York.

1058
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,396
I'm not gonna waste a bullet.

1059
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,318
I'm just gonna sharpen my knife.

1060
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:55,315
Oh, God! Please!

1061
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,353
And he never raised
his voice at all, Kate?

1062
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,755
No, he-- No, he was whispering.

1063
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,474
I-- He was whispering.

1064
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,269
Okay. Come on.
We'll take it to the lab.

1065
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,916
You paid off
to save your airline.

1066
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,679
Why won't you pay off
to save your son?

1067
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,839
I'm not a marriage counsellor.
I'm here to get your boy back.

1068
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,752
I'm sorry.

1069
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,277
I hope...

1070
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,868
that you can
forgive me for that.

1071
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,517
And for what I have to do now.

1072
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,430
Get the shirt to Forensics.

1073
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,120
- Make sure they check for
more than one blood type.
- Sure, Lonnie.

1074
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,119
Where are you goin', Tom?
Where are you goin'? What you--

1075
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,477
I'm not-- All right.

1076
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,672
Just think before you act.

1077
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,669
- There he is.
- Mr Mullen!
- Mr Mullen!

1078
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,995
- I'd like to make a statement.
- Quiet.

1079
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,272
And that is that I'm undeterred
in my course of action.

1080
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,751
And I'm raising the reward.

1081
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,510
Uh, I'm raising it
by $2 million.

1082
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:17,030
- Mr Mullen, why are you doing this?
- I want my son back.

1083
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,590
Thank you. Thank you.

1084
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,757
The FBl's efforts
in this area--

1085
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,278
This just in: Tom Mullen
has reportedly raised the reward money
for his son's life...

1086
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,517
by $2 million.

1087
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,520
Hey.

1088
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,596
Where are you goin'?

1089
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,111
You've ruined my life.

1090
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,392
Who the hell you think
I'm doing this for?

1091
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:18,673
A stunning development tonight as
Tom Mullen doubles the reward money...

1092
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,473
to $4 million
for the capture of--

1093
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,189
- What?
- Wanna talk to your son?

1094
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,035
- Yes, of course I do.
- Mmm, Daddy? Dad?

1095
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,878
Sean.

1096
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,709
- Sean. Sean. Son.
- Sean? I wanna listen.

1097
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,400
- That's enough.
- No, put him back on.
I wanna-- I wanna talk to him.

1098
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,158
You just did.

1099
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,511
Now, you listen...

1100
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,108
real, real good.

1101
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,755
You got one more chance to pay up
or you're never gonna talk to him again.

1102
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,075
No more fuckin' around.

1103
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,714
This is it right now.

1104
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,831
What's it gonna be?

1105
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,275
No. Bullshit. You're not gonna
touch him. You can't be that stupid.

1106
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,516
Do you have any idea
the rain of shit I can put on you?

1107
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:15,156
Look at your wife.
Look at her face, motherfucker.
Do you know what I can do to your boy?

1108
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,589
Is it dark where you're calling from?
You got the shades drawn?

1109
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:21,156
Kind of like a cellar, right? Like a
cave? Well, you better get used to that.

1110
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,316
You better get used to crawling
in the dark for the rest of your days...

1111
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,671
because I am going to get the best group
of manhunters in this country...

1112
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,916
and I am gonna dedicate my life
to tracking you down!

1113
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,996
- You understand?
- Hey, hey, get your head
out of your ass!

1114
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,192
You think you can threaten me, huh?
Who do you think you're dealing with?
Give me the money!

1115
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:39,189
Fuck you and your $2 million!
Don't you understand English, you
useless piece of shit? No money! None!

1116
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,914
Let me tell you something. You think
you're suffering right now? Huh?

1117
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:46,318
You got no idea what suffering is.
If I don't get the cash in one hour,
this kid is dead!

1118
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,910
I don't get my son back, and I mean
real soon, you better kill yourself...

1119
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,157
because when I catch up with you
I'm gonna take my goddam time!

1120
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,748
By the time we're finished,
you're gonna wish you weren't born!

1121
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,030
I'll have your head on a fuckin' pike!
You understand me?

1122
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,276
Fuck you! I'll fuckin'
kill him right now!

1123
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,233
- I wanna talk!
- You kill him, you kill yourself,
you motherfucker!

1124
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,749
- Give me back my son!
- Hello!

1125
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,519
- You want him?
- Yes!
- You want him?

1126
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,278
Daddy!

1127
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,233
Oh! Jesus! Jesus!

1128
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,750
Oh, Jesus! Oh! Oh!

1129
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,189
Oh! Oh, God!

1130
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,999
I'll fuckin' kill you, Mullen!

1131
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:38,798
You son of a bitch! You killed him,
you son of a bitch! Goddam it!

1132
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,037
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Come on. Easy. Come on.
- Kate!

1133
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,550
- Both of you listen to me!
- You killed him! Not them! You!

1134
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,910
No, Kate! Kate.
Okay, it's all right.

1135
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,873
- Take her in the other room.
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

1136
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,434
- Oh, God. I wanted to talk to him.
- I know.

1137
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:57,189
- I wanted to talk to him.
- You'll talk to him, honey.
You will. You will.

1138
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,069
- What do we do about this kid?
- Ain't my problem any more.

1139
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,316
Can't ID anybody, right? Fuck 'im.

1140
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,512
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1141
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,996
Oh, please, help me. Please.

1142
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,078
Okay, Katie, all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

1143
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,430
Oh, God. Oh, no.

1144
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,636
- Ohh! Ohh!
- Oh, Tom.

1145
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,189
South 44 to Base.

1146
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,392
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- South 44, go.

1147
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,718
2627 18th Street.
10-13. Officer needs assistance.

1148
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,513
I have several armed men in a house.
Possible kidnap situation.

1149
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,710
Repeat, possible kidnap situation.

1150
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,832
10-13. Officer
in civilian clothes.

1151
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,711
- Police!
- Shit.

1152
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,436
- Get the fuck out of the van!
- Go, man. Come on.

1153
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,396
Drop the gun!

1154
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,189
Move! Move! Go!

1155
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,631
Clear!

1156
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,352
Clear!

1157
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,870
- Police! Freeze!
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm a cop!

1158
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,434
- Clear!
- Hold your fire. I'm a cop.

1159
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,357
He's all right.

1160
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,757
I'm a cop.

1161
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,637
Kate. Tom.

1162
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,877
FBl. Comin' through.
Comin' through.

1163
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,753
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Comin' through, fellas. Comin' through.

1164
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,997
Wh-- Where is-- Where is--

1165
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,630
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1166
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,677
Wh-Where is--
L-Lonnie? Where's Sean?

1167
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,314
In the house. In the house.
Right over here.

1168
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,273
Don't stop here, guys.
Keep movin' all the way through.

1169
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,198
-Clear the doorway here, okay?
-The boy's in there.
-All right, here comes the boy's father.

1170
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,914
Sean? Sean?
I'm-- I'm the father.

1171
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,474
Sean?

1172
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,990
- Who is it?
- Sean. It's me. It's Daddy.

1173
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,315
Daddy?

1174
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,829
Is he-- Is he all right?
C-Can I pick him up?

1175
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,757
- Can I hold him?
- Oh, he's gonna be all right.
- Oh, Sean.

1176
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,758
He's just got a nasty cut on his hand,
and he's, uh, a little dehydrated.

1177
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,394
- Sean, it's Mommy.
- You're okay, buddy.
You're okay. We got ya.

1178
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,078
- We got ya now.
- Hi, Mom.

1179
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,033
- Hi, sweetheart.
- You're okay.

1180
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,636
- Take me home, okay?
- Oh, sure. Sure.

1181
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,149
- Take me home.
- Okay, honey.

1182
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,237
- I love you, Sean.
- Me too.

1183
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,836
Mama's here, Sean.

1184
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,117
You're okay.

1185
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,351
-Is-ls-ls-ls he seriously injured?
-Here's your man. He's right over there.

1186
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,835
He's gonna be okay.
Step to the side, please.

1187
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,272
- All the way to the right.
- Lieutenant, we--
- All the way back. Get back.
- Back off.

1188
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,879
- Mr Shaker?
- Step back, please.
Step back. Step back.

1189
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,514
Did you get a chance
to talk to him?

1190
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,677
- I said step back.
- Thank you.
- Call it justice.
It's a department courtesy.

1191
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,351
- All right, now, if you please.
- Move. Move.

1192
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,277
- Guys, help us out, will ya?
- Thank you.

1193
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,990
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1194
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:59,999
Tom. Tom? Just come this way.

1195
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,917
What-- What-- Mr Mullen!

1196
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,318
You know her?

1197
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,590
Yeah.

1198
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,358
I do.

1199
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,832
Jesus Christ. I mean,
she w-worked for me.

1200
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,951
Catering.

1201
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,796
Please, sir! Here!

1202
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,076
- Mr Mullen! Tom! Tom!
- Mr Mullen, this way!
- Mr Mullen, this way!

1203
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,432
Wait! This way! Right here!
Right here! Look over here, please!

1204
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,199
- You okay?
- Not now. Come on, back off.

1205
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,993
Not now. Leave 'em alone.

1206
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,475
- Give us a break now!
- Sean, here!

1207
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,718
-Sean! Mr Mullen!
-Mr Mullen, this way! Mr Mullen, please!

1208
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,638
Aaah! Turn the lights on!
Turn the lights on!

1209
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,955
- Hey.
- It's all right.

1210
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,958
- I'm afraid of the dark.
I don't like the dark.
- You're all right.

1211
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:57,073
- Leave the light on.
- Yeah, we'll leave 'em on.
We'll leave 'em on all the time.

1212
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,077
Okay?

1213
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:03,239
Next thing I know,
one guy starts blastin' away at me.

1214
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:08,036
The-- The other guy,
he goes to run me over.

1215
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,550
So, you know,
I just did what I had to do.

1216
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,477
What about the woman?

1217
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,197
Jimmy?

1218
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,836
Uh, you know, I just, uh,
got spun around by the bullet.

1219
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,554
I didn't know
it was a woman 'til after.

1220
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,269
He's a, an honest cop.
He does a hell of a job.

1221
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,152
- He's kind of a to-himself
type of a guy.
- No, just one.

1222
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,679
- But I tell you what,
when the chips are down...
- Cancel the other one.

1223
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,189
this is the one
I'd want with me.

1224
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,436
- How do I feel?
- No.
- I'll tell ya, this is
the second time...

1225
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,357
- Jimmy Shaker's been shot.
- Just one-way.

1226
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,119
He got clipped once before in 1992,
and this guy keeps coming back.

1227
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,879
Yeah. Uh, Mr Kinney.
Yeah. Thanks.

1228
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,434
Continuing our coverage
of the Mullen kidnapping case...

1229
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,552
questions still surround
Maris Conner.

1230
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,753
With no prior criminal record,
authorities are interrogating
family and friends...

1231
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,032
seeking any associations that would
connect her to the other slain suspects.

1232
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,277
Sources reveal today that
the investigation continues...

1233
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,517
and the search for
other suspects is by no means over.

1234
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,235
Many investigators believe that,
indeed, the mastermind
of the Mullen kidnapping...

1235
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,157
may still be at large.

1236
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,716
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1237
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:23,513
- We can make it.
- Oh, sh--
- Ohh!

1238
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,995
- You cold, honey?
- Yeah. My hands.

1239
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,156
- Do you wanna go home?
- I didn't bring my gloves.
- No. No. No.

1240
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,635
You sure? Hey, you're squinting a
little. Is the sun still bothering you?

1241
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,557
- Put these on.
- Yeah.

1242
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,955
- I'll go get your gloves.
- Okay.

1243
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,150
You'd better practise.
I'll be back.

1244
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:42,356
Look at me.
You look good in those, honey.

1245
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,311
- Look at my glasses. Can you see?
- Mm-hmm.

1246
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,078
Look like your daddy
in those.

1247
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:50,433
Well, David, it's a little hard
to focus right now. Can it wait?

1248
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,916
No? Well, the hell with it, then.
Let him have it. Let it go.

1249
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:57,396
Yeah. Listen, I got Sean waitin' for me
in the park, so maybe we--

1250
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,873
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.

1251
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,797
Uh, I'll call you back, David.
Call you back.

1252
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,832
- Mr Mullen.
- Uh--
- The doorman just called up.

1253
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,599
- Mr Shaker wants to see you.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry
to show up like this.

1254
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,711
Oh, hell, no. Come in.
I-l wanna talk to you.

1255
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,832
- Thanks.
- Come in. Come in. How's the shoulder?

1256
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,837
Ahh, you know. I'll live.

1257
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,916
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised
to see you up and about so quick.

1258
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,838
- Uh, uh, Fatima,
this is, uh, Jimmy Shaker.
- Hi.

1259
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,599
I'm very proud to meet you.

1260
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,517
- Very proud.
- Thanks.

1261
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,476
How's the, uh, kid doin'?

1262
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,068
Oh, he's fine, you know,
all things considered.

1263
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,316
- It'll take a while.
- Yeah.

1264
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,671
Um, uh, forgive me.

1265
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,110
I, uh, I thought
we were gonna meet on Monday.
M-Maybe I screwed up. I don't-- I--

1266
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:44,313
Uh, yeah, uh, you're right.
Monday. We-- That's what we said, uh--

1267
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,715
See the special officer
holding 4-5-9--

1268
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,676
Look, I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me here...

1269
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,351
but I was hopin'
we could do this today.

1270
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,914
- You know, the reward and all?
- Oh. Of course. Oh, Jesus.
- 'Cause I gotta tell ya...

1271
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,589
it's, uh, kinda crazy
around me, you know,
with the, the press and everything.

1272
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:05,756
Oh, I understand. Yeah.
Look, they're maniacs.

1273
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,155
- Yeah.
- Nothin' easier. Follow me.

1274
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:12,068
I'm not used to this, you know.
I-- I just gotta get outta here.

1275
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,912
Kind of a private person,
you know.

1276
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:21,953
To tell you the truth,
I never killed anybody before.

1277
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,310
Havin' a hard time with it.

1278
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,516
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

1279
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,632
Uh, I'm glad you did
what you did.

1280
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,917
But I'm sorry.

1281
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:37,435
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

1282
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:41,439
Uh, so, is it, uh--
is it Jimmy? James?

1283
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,757
James.

1284
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,439
James'll do.

1285
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,637
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

1286
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,669
Why didn't you pay the ransom?

1287
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,396
Well, because I was dealing
with human garbage.

1288
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,432
No contract would have been honoured,
not by them.

1289
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,676
You know, the funny thing is,
I would have paid ten times as much...

1290
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,837
if I had any sense that
they'd stick to the deal, but no.

1291
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,757
- Really.
- Oh, yeah. Really.

1292
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,791
The thing that really kills me
about that is the woman.

1293
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,276
She'd been in this house five,
six times over the last year.
Nice. Pleasant. You know.

1294
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,436
You just can't, uh--

1295
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,233
I-l don't know how people
can walk around with that--

1296
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:45,113
That cold-blooded, two-faced--

1297
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,515
That bitch.

1298
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,871
Well, uh, you know,
in fairness to the dead...

1299
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,912
we're all a little two-faced
in this day and age.

1300
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,754
It's a survival mechanism. You kn--
You know what I'm saying?

1301
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,077
I mean, you know, as a cop...

1302
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,192
you should hear some of the stuff that's
been thrown my way over the years.

1303
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,278
Tom, just forget about the gloves,
honey. He wanted to come home.

1304
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,710
- Kate, uh--
- Hi, Tom.
- Mr Shaker's here.

1305
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,990
Mr Shaker.

1306
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,716
Ohh, um--

1307
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,029
God bless you.
Uh, thank you.

1308
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,195
- You're welcome.
- Listen, you-- you gotta meet Sean.

1309
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,038
I'll go get him.

1310
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:45,631
No, uh, he's, you know, had enough.
Let's give him a breather. Yeah?

1311
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:52,198
Yeah, yeah.
He's-He's had enough.

1312
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,550
Okay. Uh, can I get you anything?

1313
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,557
No, I'm fine.

1314
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,557
Oh, well, again, l--
I can't even begin to--

1315
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,035
I understand.
Don't mention it.

1316
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,159
Okay.

1317
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:09,911
Fatima, would you please help me
with some things downstairs?

1318
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,873
I'll be right there.

1319
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,638
Well, this is, uh,
one hell of a deposit you've got here.

1320
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:25,359
Shouldn't be a problem.

1321
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,954
Well, you'll probably
wanna be on your way.

1322
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,833
Uh, unless there's anything else
I can do for you.

1323
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,072
Good. Right.

1324
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:50,079
Well, I know how these vultures
out there can drive ya nuts, so--

1325
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,237
You know, there's a back door
out if you, you know,
wanna be a little more s--

1326
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,750
This check is bullshit, Tom.

1327
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,192
What'd you think,
I'm just gonna waltz outta here,
you lying motherfucker? Huh?

1328
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:06,348
Let you make a phone call,
have half the cops in New York
waitin' for me while I cash this thing?

1329
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,277
- You can't lie to me.
- Look--

1330
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,550
Shut your mouth.

1331
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,637
Fuck!

1332
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,595
You know who I am.
Now you sit down.

1333
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,716
Everybody was gonna make out fine.

1334
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,195
But you had to go
and put it together...

1335
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:41,553
and now we got
a little problem here, don't we?

1336
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:44,035
Tell me that part again about
why you didn't pay the ransom.

1337
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,037
- I think we can do something here--
- Say it!

1338
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,469
You were dealing with what?

1339
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,872
- You had my son.
- You have no idea what
human garbage is, motherfucker.

1340
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,878
Do you know what the fuck you're
talking about? No, I don't think you do.

1341
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,073
'Cause look where you fuckin' live, man.
Look at the airline man here.

1342
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,909
This fucker won't pay one cent
to save his only kid.

1343
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,350
- It wasn't gonna get him back, was it?
- Hey, did you read the papers? Huh?

1344
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,277
Did you see the TV?

1345
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:14,597
I took a bullet.
I risked my life to save your kid.

1346
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,110
I took a bullet, and now you're gonna
try to fuck me out of my money. Huh?

1347
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,993
- What's over here?
- Where are you going?
- Where's Mommy and Junior?

1348
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:24,032
- Now I'll pay. Now.
- Oh, yeah.

1349
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:27,470
You're gonna pay, all right.
Right now.

1350
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,751
Do you have an account I can wire
the money to? I mean, you got to have
been all set up for this, right?

1351
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,158
I mean, you're not dumb. You and me,
we go right now to my bank...

1352
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,157
and we wire the money
from my account to yours.

1353
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,396
Just the push of a button.
Just like that.

1354
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:44,036
We'll just go down to the bank
and get it done.

1355
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:46,913
Pick up the phone.
Wire it from here.

1356
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:53,150
Uh, no, we'll go to the bank
and do it.

1357
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,478
And you'll get the money and all I want
in return is you out of this house now.

1358
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,837
Hey. You do not call the shots.

1359
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:08,272
Well, then, you just go ahead
and kill me right here and now,
you son of a bitch.

1360
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,551
You fuck! Fuck you!
I'm not pickin' up that phone.

1361
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,638
You got that?
I'm not pickin' it up.

1362
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:18,514
Look, uh, you can kill me.
Go ahead. Kill me. Just kill us.

1363
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,108
Let us live. Doesn't matter.
Any way you cut it, you're on the run.

1364
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:24,312
Now, you can come with me to the bank
and be on the run with $4 million...

1365
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:28,069
or you can just start shootin'
and be on the run with whatever
you got in your wallet.

1366
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:29,997
It's up to you.

1367
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:34,318
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go to the bank.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1368
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:38,274
I got what I want.
Bottom line: I got my son back.

1369
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,516
And you d-- you delivered him.

1370
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:44,838
I got my own plane. I can fly you out
of here myself anywhere you wanna go.

1371
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:49,238
You can still win this thing.
Think. You can still win.

1372
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,110
We do what you say.
We go to the bank.

1373
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:14,678
If anything goes wrong, you're gonna
turn around and I'll be gone.

1374
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,155
Okay? And if that happens...

1375
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,236
from this day on...

1376
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:22,352
any time your kid leaves
this house to go to school...

1377
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:26,109
go play, see a friend...

1378
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,312
to buy a fuckin' comic book,
you're gonna have to ask yourself:

1379
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,674
Is today...

1380
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:36,189
Jimmy Shaker day?

1381
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,959
I got to him once.

1382
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,435
I'll get him again.

1383
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,233
And when I do...

1384
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:47,955
I'm not gonna want money any more.

1385
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,548
Do we understand each other?

1386
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:51,954
Sure.

1387
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,199
That's from Maris.

1388
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,397
Call the airport.

1389
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:29,276
Where are we goin'?

1390
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,709
Mexico. Guadalajara.

1391
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:41,360
David, this is Tom. Uh, fuel up the jet.
I'm going to Guadalajara.

1392
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:44,517
Yeah, well, something came up.
I'm on my way to the bank now.

1393
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,836
- Is the kidnapper with you?
- Absolutely.

1394
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:54,078
I'll explain everything later.
Give Katie a call. Bye.

1395
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,877
Antone, get me the Mullen house.

1396
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,116
Sean, what's the matter, honey?

1397
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,636
Come here.

1398
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,715
Taxi! Taxi!

1399
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,477
Stay on my right.

1400
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:17,470
What are you guys doin'?
You can't park there.

1401
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,716
Oh, we're just goin'
to the bank. Five minutes.

1402
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,710
- Shaker?
- Yeah.

1403
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,197
- How you doin', Jimmy?
- How are ya?

1404
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,470
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah? You too.

1405
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,670
- How you doin', Mr Mullen?
Good to meet you.
- Hey.

1406
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,189
Just wanna shake your hand, boss.
You made us proud.

1407
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,117
- Well, you know, just doin' the job.
- Yeah.

1408
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:40,038
What do you think
of this guy, Mr Mullen?

1409
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:42,390
- Well, what can I say? He's the man.
- Yeah!

1410
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,909
- Okay, guys, uh, take it easy.
- Later, Jimbo.
- Okay.

1411
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:47,315
- You guys take it easy now.
- All right.
- You guys not gonna be long, right?

1412
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,795
- No, just five minutes.
- No, no, no.
