1
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,880
- How are you?
- Okay.

2
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:35,080
Your leg will be fine.

3
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,817
A lot of shrapnel came out.
I saved you the pieces.

4
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:41,019
You are the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.

5
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,857
I don't think so.
Here.

6
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:46,524
- Would you kiss me?
- No. I'll get you some tea.

7
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,502
- It would mean such a lot to me.
- Would it?

8
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,343
Thank you.

9
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:04,173
- Nurse, I can't sleep.
- Would you kiss me?

10
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,048
- You're so pretty.
- Will you tuck me in, please?

11
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,918
Very funny.
Go to sleep now.

12
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,959
- Where's the doctor?
- Don't ask.

13
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:37,665
God, I hate giving blood.
Can't stand needles.

14
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:47,119
Is there anybody from Picton?

15
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:50,213
Picton?
I don't know.

16
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,317
I'd like to see somebody from home 
before I go.

17
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:04,903
- Do we have anybody from Picton?
- Why Picton?

18
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,769
He's from there. Edge of Lake Ontario,
right, soldier?

19
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:11,368
<i>That's where your sweetie's from, 
isn't it? Around there?</i>

20
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:14,140
Ask him what company he's with.

21
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:18,412
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.

22
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,585
Does he know Captain McGan?

23
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:28,116
He bought it yesterday.
Shot to bits.

24
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,754
- What did he say?
- Doesn't know him.

25
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,101
<i>Hana, get down!</i>

26
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:43,034
He's dead. He's dead.

27
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,239
He's dead.

28
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:50,282
He's dead.

29
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:17,630
<i>Name, rank, serial number?</i>

30
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,729
<i>No, sorry.</i>

31
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,468
I think I was a pilot.

32
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:26,137
I was found in the wreckage of a plane
at the beginning of the war.

33
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:28,146
Can you remember where you were born?

34
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:30,876
Am I being interrogated?

35
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,750
You should be trying to trick me, 
make me speak German.

36
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:37,153
- Which I can, by the way.
- Why?

37
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,953
- <i>Are you German?</i>
- No.

38
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:43,894
<i>How do you know you're not German
if you don't remember anything?</i>

39
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,659
Might-- Might I have a sip of water?

40
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,804
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

41
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,016
I remember lots of things.

42
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:09,578
I remember her garden,
plunging down to the sea.

43
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:13,023
- <i>Nothing between you and France.</i>
- This was your garden?

44
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:16,027
- Or my wife's.
- <i>You were married then?</i>

45
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:20,464
I think so. Although I believe that
to be true of a number of Germans.

46
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,603
<i>Look.</i>

47
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:28,402
I have this much lung.

48
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,908
The rest of my organs are packing up.

49
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:34,344
What could it possibly matter
if I'm a Tutankhamen?

50
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:38,373
I'm a bit of... toast, my friend.

51
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:42,012
Sorry I can't help you.

52
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,564
Are you all right?

53
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,664
I know you hate to be moved.
I'm sorry.

54
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,374
Hana!

55
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,849
- Jan?
- Hana!

56
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:15,752
There's meant to be lace in the next village. 
The boys are gonna take me.

57
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,222
- You don't have any money, do ya?
- No.

58
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,986
- Just in case there's a sale.
- <i>No.</i>

59
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,686
Hana, I know you do.
Come on.

60
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,319
- No!
- Oh, come on.

61
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,921
I swear to God,
this'll be the last time. I swear.

62
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,593
She's a softie.
She loves me.

63
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:34,066
I'll pay you back! I promise!

64
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,007
I'm not sewing anything else for you.

65
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,271
I love you!

66
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:42,576
Whoa!
Pienza, boys!

67
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,900
<i>Get some water over here!</i>

68
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:06,098
Jan!
Oh, no!

69
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,567
<i>Hana, where're you going?</i>

70
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,908
- Stay back!
- Stop, Hana!

71
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:18,245
Stay--

72
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,917
No!

73
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,584
No!

74
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,938
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't move!

75
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,974
Don't move!
Don't move!

76
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:18,272
Stand absolutely still!

77
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,074
<i>You're walking in a mine field!</i>

78
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:26,251
Good.

79
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,152
That's good.

80
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:32,350
Just stay still for me...

81
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:34,689
and we'll be fine.

82
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,760
What are you doing?

83
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:41,994
What the bloody hell 
do you think you're doing?

84
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:46,137
<i>It's Jan's.</i>

85
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,493
<i>Are you in pain?
Do you need something?</i>

86
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:18,503
- Yes.
- Okay.

87
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,935
Are you okay?

88
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:26,274
- You and Jan were--
- We keep moving him in and out of the truck.

89
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,439
Why? He's dying. 
What's the point?

90
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,109
We can hardly leave him.
Do you mean leave him?

91
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:34,779
No, no, I don't mean leave him.

92
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:46,724
This will help you.

93
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:51,025
I must be a curse.

94
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:54,595
Anybody who loves me...

95
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,574
anybody who gets close to me--

96
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,109
Oh, I must be cursed.

97
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,387
Which is it?

98
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:39,467
- When he dies, I'll catch up.
- It's not safe here.

99
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:43,311
The whole country's crawling 
with bandits and Germans and God knows what.

100
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:45,873
- It's madness! I can't allow it.
- The war is over.

101
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:47,851
How can it be desertion?

102
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,253
It's not over everywhere.
I didn't mean literally.

103
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,350
This is normal, a shock,
for all of us, Hana.

104
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:57,828
I need morphine, a lot.
And a pistol.

105
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:05,866
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

106
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,705
We're heading for Leghorn.

107
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:14,075
"Livorno", the Italians call it.

108
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,910
We'll expect you.

109
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:27,925
Fine.

110
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,634
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

111
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:42,806
- Oh, Hana.
- I'll be okay.

112
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,901
I'll catch up.
Good.

113
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:55,079
What-- What was all that banging?

114
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:59,777
Are you-- Are you fighting rats
or the entire German army?

115
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:05,253
No. I was repairing the stairs.

116
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:09,590
I found a library,
and the books were very useful.

117
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:13,029
Before you find too many uses for those books,

118
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,566
you might read some to me.

119
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:18,228
I think they're all in Italian,
but I'll look, yes.

120
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,966
- What about your own book?
- My book?

121
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,134
Oh, yes, the Herodotus.

122
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,202
<i>Yes, you can read him.</i>

123
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,271
Oh. I found plums.

124
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:34,115
We have plums in the orchard. 
There.

125
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,984
We have an orchard.

126
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:41,152
Herodotus is the father of history.

127
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,923
- Do you know that?
- I don't know anything.

128
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,207
Hmm.

129
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:06,547
<i>It's a--</i>

130
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:09,884
It's a very plum...

131
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:11,923
plum.

132
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:41,512
A mountain the shape of a woman's back. 
Good, good.

133
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:09,131
- Hello, Geoffrey!
- Madox, hello!

134
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,644
- <i>Welcome to the expedition.</i>
- <i>How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton.</i>

135
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,110
Splendid to finally meet you all.

136
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,113
This is Dante D'Agostino and Diggy Bermann, 
our archaeologist.

137
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,581
- Beautiful plane.
- This is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist.

138
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:21,643
- And this is my wife, Katharine.
- Hello.

139
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,620
<i>We're your new apprentices.</i>

140
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:26,180
<i>Welcome to the International Sand Club.</i>

141
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:30,024
- To the International Sand Club.
- I'll get cups.

142
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,529
- Marvelous plane. Did you look?
- Yes.

143
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:35,658
Isn't it? A wedding present
from Katharine's parents.

144
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:37,793
We're calling it Rupert Bear.

145
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,270
- Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
- Almasy.

146
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:43,740
We can finally consign my old bird
to the scrap heap.

147
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,277
<i>Mrs. Clifton, I'd like to present...</i>

148
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:49,280
- Count Almasy.
- Hello.

149
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:52,181
Geoffrey gave me your monograph
and I was reading up in the desert.

150
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:54,879
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

151
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:58,354
I wanted to meet the man who could write
a long paper with so few adjectives.

152
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:02,383
Well, a thing is still a thing,
no matter what you place in front of it.

153
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:06,397
<i>Big car, slow car,
chauffeur-driven car.</i>

154
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:09,400
- <i>Broken car.</i>
- It's still a car.

155
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:12,767
- Not much use, though.
- <i>Love?</i>

156
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:16,501
Romantic love, platonic love, filial love.

157
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:19,043
- Quite different things, surely.
- <i>Uxoriousness.</i>

158
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:23,605
That's my favorite kind of love.
Excessive love of one's wife.

159
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:27,482
Now there you have me.

160
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:30,147
- They're tourists.
- Absolute rot.

161
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:32,690
They're highly recommended
by the Royal Geographic Society.

162
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,749
She's charming and has read everything.

163
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:37,660
- He's meant to be a ruddy good flier.
- We don't need another pilot.

164
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,755
He can make aerial maps of the whole route.

165
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,494
<i>You can't explore from the air, Madox.</i>

166
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:45,560
<i>If you could explore from the air,
life would be very simple.</i>

167
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,062
Contact.

168
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,110
Contact.

169
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:11,312
I should try and move the bed.

170
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,881
I want you to be able to see the view.

171
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:17,190
It's good. 
It's a view from a monastery.

172
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:20,720
- I can already see.
- How?

173
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,529
- How can you see anything?
- No, no, not the window.

174
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:26,298
I can't bear the light anyway.

175
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,862
I can see all the way to the desert.

176
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,841
I'm turning you.

177
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,276
Exploring before the war,
making maps.

178
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:37,577
Is there sand in my eyes?
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

179
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:41,176
No sand.
That's your morphine speaking.

180
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:51,555
I can see my wife in that view.

181
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:57,024
Are you remembering more?

182
00:25:57,102 --> 00:26:00,367
- Could I have a cigarette?
- Are you crazy?

183
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:09,310
Why-- Why are you so determined
to keep me alive?

184
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,839
Because I'm a nurse.

185
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,200
<i>Bravo.</i>

186
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:05,862
<i>We have an old-fashioned tomato</i>

187
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:08,338
<i>A Long Island potato</i>

188
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,535
<i>But yes
We have no bananas</i>

189
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,874
<i>We have no bananas today</i>

190
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:28,689
- <i>Next!</i>
- <i>Katharine!</i>

191
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,795
"The King insisted that he would find some way...

192
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,854
"to prove beyond dispute...

193
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:38,062
"that his wife was fairest of all women.

194
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:41,765
"'I will hide you in your room where we sleep', 
said Candaules--

195
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,434
- said Candaules."
- Candaules.

196
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,137
"Candaules."

197
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:49,339
Candaules.

198
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:53,407
Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen 
has the same practice every night.

199
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:56,454
She takes off her clothes...

200
00:27:56,521 --> 00:28:00,457
and puts them on the chair
by the door to her room.

201
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:02,993
<i>"And from where you stand,</i>

202
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:06,588
<i>you will be able to gaze on her 
at your leisure."</i>

203
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:11,594
And that evening, it's exactly as
the King has told him.

204
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,604
She goes to the chair,

205
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:15,799
removes her clothes one by one,

206
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:19,901
until she's standing naked
in full view of Gyges.

207
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:24,642
And indeed, she was more lovely
than he could have imagined.

208
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:28,311
But then, the Queen looked up...

209
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:32,517
and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows.

210
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:35,185
And although she said nothing, she shuddered.

211
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,563
And the next day,

212
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:47,366
she sends for-- for Gyges and challenged him.

213
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:51,842
- <i>And hearing his story, this is what she said.</i>
- Off with his head!

214
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:59,140
She said, 
"Either you must submit to death...

215
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:02,152
"for gazing on that which you should not,

216
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,745
"or else kill my husband who has shamed me...

217
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,719
<i>and become King in his place."</i>

218
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,558
So Gyges kills the King,

219
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:18,763
marries the Queen 
and becomes ruler of Lydia for 28 years.

220
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:22,673
The end.

221
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,040
Shall I spin the bottle?

222
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:30,707
So, Geoffrey, let that be a lesson to you.

223
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:33,216
- D'Agostino!
- D'Agostino!

224
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,853
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

225
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:40,517
Yes.

226
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:43,857
No. I'm dropping off.

227
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:29,305
Go away!

228
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:32,002
Go! Go!

229
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,693
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

230
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:52,864
- <i>Hana?</i>
- What do you want?

231
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:55,866
I met your friend Mary.

232
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:59,199
She said I should stop and see
if you were all right.

233
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:04,072
<i>Apparently we're neighbors. 
My house is two blocks from yours in Montreal.</i>

234
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,838
<i>Cabot, north of Laurier.</i>

235
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:09,779
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

236
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,108
For you.

237
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:16,381
<i>I'd like to take credit for it,
but it's from Mary.</i>

238
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:20,049
My name is David Caravaggio,
but nobody ever called me David.

239
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:24,721
Caravaggio they find too absurd to miss out on.

240
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:26,457
Oh!

241
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:28,999
Oh!

242
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,297
Oh, shit.
Stupid hands.

243
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:34,770
<i>Let me do that.</i>

244
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:43,174
They're fresh.

245
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:45,682
I haven't had an egg in--

246
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:50,678
Have you noticed there are chickens?

247
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:52,950
In Italy, you get chickens but no eggs.

248
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:55,822
In Africa, they're always eggs
but never chickens.

249
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:59,330
- Who's separating them?
- You were in Africa?

250
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:01,262
Yes, I was.

251
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,302
So was my patient.

252
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,361
Look, I'd like to stay for a while.

253
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,407
I have to do some work here.

254
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:12,841
<i>I speak the language.
There are partisans to be disarmed.</i>

255
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:16,711
We embrace them and see
if we can relieve them of their weapons,

256
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:18,840
you know, while we hide.

257
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:22,478
I was a thief, 
so the army thought I'd be good at it.

258
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:25,352
- So you can shoot a pistol?
- No.

259
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:28,290
Do you have a problem with those?

260
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:31,595
No.

261
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:34,291
- I should look at them before you go.
- <i>Look.</i>

262
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,766
It's a big place.
We needn't disturb each other.

263
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:39,099
<i>I'll sleep in the stable.</i>

264
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,195
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don't sleep.

265
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:44,367
I don't know what Mary told you about me, 
but I don't need company.

266
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:47,536
I don't need to be looked after.

267
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:54,914
There is a man downstairs.

268
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:58,387
He brought us eggs.
He might stay.

269
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:01,323
Why?
Can he lay eggs?

270
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:03,486
He's Canadian.

271
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:07,588
Why are people always so happy 
when they collide with one from the same place?

272
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,567
What happened in Montreal
when you passed a man in the street?

273
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:13,729
Did you invite him to live with you?

274
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,438
He needn't disturb you.

275
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:20,069
He can't.
I'm already disturbed.

276
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:26,916
There's a war. 
Where you come from becomes important.

277
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:30,546
<i>Why? I hate that idea.</i>

278
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:38,663
Ah!
It's gonna work.

279
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:42,325
<i>Gently.</i>

280
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,372
Can I help?

281
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,340
It's finished.

282
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,672
So, you're our Canadian pickpocket?

283
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:55,406
<i>Thief</i> I think is more accurate.

284
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,076
I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?

285
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:02,745
Oh, all over.

286
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:06,086
All over?

287
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:09,684
I kept trying to cover a very modest portion 
and still failed.

288
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:12,730
- <i>Are you leaving us?</i>
- Yes.

289
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:15,357
Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.

290
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:18,732
Then I'm definitely going.

291
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:25,140
Does she have war wounds?

292
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,440
I think anybody she ever loves...

293
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:29,810
<i>tends to die on her.</i>

294
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:32,907
- <i>Are you planning to be the exception?</i>
- <i>Me?</i>

295
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:35,282
<i>I think you've got...</i>

296
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,651
the wrong end of the stick, old boy.

297
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:40,486
<i>So...</i>

298
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,492
<i>Caravaggio.</i>

299
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,825
Hana thinks you invented your name.

300
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,491
And you've forgotten yours.

301
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:53,697
I said that no one would ever invent
such a preposterous name.

302
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:56,104
And I said you can forget everything,

303
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:00,644
but you never forget your name.

304
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:03,078
Count Almasy.

305
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:05,480
<i>That name mean anything to you?</i>

306
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,916
<i>Or Katharine Clifton?</i>

307
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:18,462
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,693
- How much did you pay?
- Oh, hello.

309
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:25,668
They don't see foreign women in this market. 
How much did you pay?

310
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:28,433
Um, £7, £8, I suppose.

311
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,940
- Which store?
- Why?

312
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:34,376
You've been cheated.
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.

313
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:36,380
I don't want to take it back.

314
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:39,679
- This is not worth £8.
- It is to me.

315
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:42,242
- Did you bargain?
- I don't care to bargain.

316
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,515
That insults them.

317
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:49,821
I don't believe that. 
I think that you're insulted by me somehow.

318
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:53,261
I'd be very happy to obtain
the correct price for this.

319
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:56,027
I apologize if I appear abrupt.

320
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm rusty at social graces.

321
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,966
How do you find Cairo?

322
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:08,843
- Did you visit the pyramids?
- Excuse me.

323
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,575
Or the Sphinx?

324
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:19,120
<i>Latitude, 25, 33.
Longitude, 25, 16.</i>

325
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,126
<i>We attempt to drive northeast of Kofer,
we'll leave our bones in the desert.</i>

326
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:25,628
- I disagree.
- You're Hungarian. You always disagree.

327
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:27,756
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

328
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:29,925
- How is your charming wife?
- <i>Marvelous.</i>

329
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:32,299
She's in love with the hotel plumbing.

330
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,497
<i>She's either in the swimming pool.
She swims for hours.</i>

331
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:37,507
She's a fish. It's quite incredible.
Or she's in the bath.

332
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:40,703
Actually, she's just outside.

333
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:44,343
Chaps only in the Long Bar.

334
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:50,754
Mrs. Clifton.

335
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:55,282
<i>You'll have to forgive us. 
We're not accustomed to the company of women.</i>

336
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,057
Not at all. 
I was thoroughly enjoying my book.

337
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,997
- The team is in mourning, darling.
- Oh, really?

338
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:05,399
I'm afraid we're not having much luck
obtaining funds for the expedition.

339
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,404
Oh. Well, what'll you do?

340
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:09,906
More modest expedition,
or even wait a year.

341
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:12,966
- It's a disaster.
- Remind our families we still exist.

342
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:15,035
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?

343
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:18,241
Very much so.
We all are.

344
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:20,750
- <i>Save my friend Almasy here.</i>
- I feel much better.

345
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:24,549
Don't you, darling?
We were feeling rather self-conscious.

346
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:26,749
Let's toast, then.
Absent wives.

347
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:29,554
- Absent wives.
- And present ones.

348
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:31,254
And future ones.

349
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:54,251
Thank you.

350
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,117
Excuse me.
May I?

351
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:15,170
- Why did you follow me yesterday?
- I'm sorry. What?

352
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,833
After the market,
you followed me to the hotel.

353
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:22,039
I was concerned. 
A woman in that part of Cairo, a European woman.

354
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:24,604
- I felt obliged to.
- You felt obliged to?

355
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:27,549
As the wife of one of our party.

356
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:30,679
So why follow me?
Escort me, by all means.

357
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:34,020
But following me is predatory, isn't it?

358
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:19,861
Could I ask you to move?

359
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:23,065
I'm sorry, but I--

360
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:27,845
I'm sorry.
Of course.

361
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:30,847
- <i>It's just when you move.</i>
- How stupid of me.

362
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:35,545
- I can't really bear the pressure--
- Are you all right?

363
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,952
I was dreaming.
Awful.

364
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:30,640
Hana.

365
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:36,939
Hana, are you all right?

366
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,608
Leave me alone.

367
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,935
You're in love with him, aren't you?

368
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:06,067
<i>Your poor patient.</i>

369
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:09,079
<i>You think he's a saint
because of the way he looks.</i>

370
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:12,241
I don't think he is.

371
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:14,614
I'm not so in love with him.

372
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:18,985
I'm in love with ghosts.

373
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:22,150
So is he.
He's in love with ghosts.

374
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:24,524
What if I told you he did this to me?

375
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:31,031
How could he have?
When?

376
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:33,662
I'm one of his ghosts,
and he wouldn't even know it.

377
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:37,640
- I don't know what that means.
- <i>Ask your saint who he is.</i>

378
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:40,975
Ask him who he's killed.

379
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:48,685
Please, don't creep around this house.

380
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,153
<i>See, I don't think
he's forgotten anything!</i>

381
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:54,089
<i>I think he wants to forget!</i>

382
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:58,325
<i>Gentlemen, to mapmaking.</i>

383
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:00,296
To mapmaking!

384
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:02,730
And a special thank you 
to Geoffrey and Katharine,

385
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,998
without whose fund-raising heroics,
we'd still be kicking our heels.

386
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:09,505
- To arm-twisting.
- Arm-twisting.

387
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:13,670
Did Katharine say Geoffrey
has to fly back to Cairo?

388
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:16,508
Return the favor.
Take a few photographs for the army.

389
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:18,981
Oh, um, what kind of photographs?

390
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,984
Portraits.

391
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:23,520
The brigadier, the brigadier's wife,

392
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:27,615
the brigadier's dog, brigadier by the pyramids, 
brigadier breathing.

393
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:30,183
<i>And I shall, of course, be bereft.</i>

394
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:33,094
I'll finally be able to explore 
the Cairo nightlife.

395
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:36,099
I shall produce an authoritative guide
to the zinc bars and--

396
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,897
I want to say <i>hareems</i>. 
Are we in the right country for <i>hareems</i>?

397
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,938
<i>Harems.</i>

398
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,603
- Bye, my love.
- Keep safe.

399
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:50,943
Catch up in a week.

400
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:56,917
Clifton, safe journey.

401
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:01,254
You too. Good luck.
Glad the funds have turned up.

402
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:04,294
Clifton.

403
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:09,992
This is probably none of my business.

404
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:12,900
Your wife.

405
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,269
- Think it's appropriate to leave her?
- Appropriate?

406
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,106
Well, the desert is, it's, uh--
for a woman, it's very tough.

407
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:22,441
I wonder if it's not too much for her.

408
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:25,004
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.
She told me yesterday.

409
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:28,108
- All the same, were I you--
- I've known Katharine since she was three.

410
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:30,881
We were practically brother and sister
before we were man and wife.

411
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:33,389
I think I'd know what is and what isn't
too much for her.

412
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:36,290
I think she'd know herself.

413
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,328
Very well.

414
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:41,297
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?

415
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:26,136
I have come to love...

416
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,010
that little tap of the fingernail 
against the syringe.

417
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:33,812
Tap.

418
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:36,751
Tap.

419
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:38,755
Tap.

420
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:03,106
Stop playing! Please, stop playing.

421
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:10,720
I don't have the key to that door. You--

422
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:16,922
The Germans were here.
The Germans were all over this area.

423
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:19,462
They left mines everywhere.

424
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,021
And pianos were their favorite hiding places.

425
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:24,533
I see.
Sorry.

426
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,606
Then maybe you're safe
as long as you only play Bach.

427
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:37,276
He's German.

428
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:41,178
Is something funny?

429
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:43,652
No. I'm sorry.

430
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:00,567
I've met you before.

431
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:04,130
I don't think so.

432
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:16,353
Look. See?

433
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,446
Move that, and no more Bach.

434
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:22,959
Lieutenant!
Are you all right, sir?

435
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:25,495
<i>Fine, Sergeant.</i>

436
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:27,463
So you're working with the Italians.

437
00:46:27,531 --> 00:46:29,624
Yeah, trying to get them
to give up their weapons.

438
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,396
<i>I was a thief,
so the army thought I'd be good at it.</i>

439
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,870
<i>I like the Italians.</i>

440
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:37,237
<i>He wants us to move out.</i>

441
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:40,800
He says there could be 50 more mines 
in the building.

442
00:46:40,878 --> 00:46:45,247
<i>He thinks I'm mad
because I laugh at him.</i>

443
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:48,308
He's Indian.

444
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:52,219
- He wears a turban.
- No, he's Sikh.

445
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:54,723
<i>If he wears a turban, he's Sikh.</i>

446
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:56,817
I'll probably marry him.

447
00:46:56,894 --> 00:47:00,091
Really?
That's sudden.

448
00:47:00,164 --> 00:47:02,155
My mother always told me...

449
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:05,964
I would summon my husband
by playing the piano.

450
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:16,112
- I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
- Why? Is he staying?

451
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,910
With his sergeant, a Mr. Hardy.

452
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:24,243
We should charge.
Doesn't anyone have a job to do?

453
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:28,257
They have to clear all the roads of mines. 
That's a big job.

454
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:31,522
<i>In that case, 
I-- I suppose we can't charge.</i>

455
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:34,086
No, we can't.

456
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:39,435
Thank you.

457
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:21,610
<i>Flat foot floogee with the floy floy</i>

458
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:29,213
<i>Flat foot floogee with the floy floy</i>

459
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:31,811
<i>Flat foot floogee with the floy floy</i>

460
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:36,258
I've been thinking. How does someone like you 
decide to come to the desert?

461
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:38,227
What is it? You--

462
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:41,560
You're doing whatever you're doing in your castle, 
or wherever it is you live,

463
00:48:41,632 --> 00:48:45,295
and one day you say,
"I have to get to the desert", or what?

464
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:50,102
I once traveled with a guide
who was taking me to Faya.

465
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:54,042
He didn't speak for nine hours.

466
00:48:56,547 --> 00:49:01,246
<i>At the end of it, 
he pointed at the horizon and said, "Faya".</i>

467
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,253
That was a good day.

468
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:17,458
Actually, you sing.

469
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:21,794
- What?
- You sing.

470
00:49:21,872 --> 00:49:24,340
All the time.

471
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:26,535
- I do not.
- Ask Al Auf.

472
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:29,879
Al Auf!

473
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:44,784
<i>You'd better be ready 
about half past 8:00</i>

474
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:47,057
<i>Remember, honey
Don't be late</i>

475
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:50,897
<i>'Cause I'll be there
when the band starts playing</i>

476
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:52,993
<i>Gonna dance off both my shoes</i>

477
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,470
<i>When they play the Jelly Roll blues</i>

478
00:49:55,539 --> 00:50:00,306
<i>Tomorrow night at the 
dark-town strutter's ball</i>

479
00:50:12,823 --> 00:50:15,417
Give me your hand.

480
00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:19,262
Thanks.

481
00:51:55,392 --> 00:51:58,122
<i>Madox!</i>

482
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:00,220
<i>Madox!</i>

483
00:52:00,297 --> 00:52:02,231
<i>Madox!</i>

484
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:05,666
- Come quickly! I've found something!
- What is it?

485
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:09,695
D'Ag! Bermann!
Quick!

486
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:28,915
My God.

487
00:52:30,627 --> 00:52:32,891
They're swimming.

488
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:40,369
<i>They're swimming.</i>

489
00:53:09,132 --> 00:53:11,191
Ow!

490
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:17,404
- You okay?
- Yeah.

491
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:44,765
<i>How do you explain...</i>

492
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:48,104
to someone who has never been here,

493
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:52,704
feelings which seem quite normal?

494
00:53:55,784 --> 00:53:59,117
I don't know, my friend.

495
00:53:59,187 --> 00:54:01,712
I don't know.

496
00:54:05,193 --> 00:54:07,491
- Aaah!
- Kamal!

497
00:54:07,562 --> 00:54:09,655
<i>Bermann, what are you doing?</i>

498
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:11,858
Bermann!

499
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:15,830
Watch out!
Watch out!

500
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:29,083
- Get them out of the car!
- Let me help!

501
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,516
Almasy, are you all right?

502
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:34,646
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

503
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:39,317
My wrist!
Ah!

504
00:54:53,007 --> 00:54:57,842
I'll be back as quick as I can,
36 hours at the outside.

505
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:00,176
Try to get an additional radiator.

506
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:05,151
We can store it between here and Pottery Hill. 
And a better jack.

507
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,678
- We planned badly.
- Bermann?

508
00:55:22,137 --> 00:55:24,037
Safe journey.

509
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,801
Now what?

510
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:32,108
<i>Let's get all this stuff off.</i>

511
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,149
- I'll stay behind, of course.
- Certainly not.

512
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:38,151
- I caused the problem. I shall stay.
- You can't. None of you can.

513
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:41,086
<i>No, I insist. 
There clearly isn't room for all of us.</i>

514
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:44,125
I'm the least able to dig, 
and I'm not one of the walking wounded.

515
00:55:44,192 --> 00:55:46,126
It's only one night.

516
00:55:46,194 --> 00:55:49,630
If I remain, it's the most effective method 
of persuading my husband...

517
00:55:49,697 --> 00:55:53,133
to abandon whatever he's doing
and come and rescue us.

518
00:55:53,201 --> 00:55:55,795
- All right.
- Come on, let's get going.

519
00:56:40,048 --> 00:56:43,449
I thought you might like to paste them 
into your book.

520
00:56:50,191 --> 00:56:52,659
<i>Well, we--</i>

521
00:56:52,727 --> 00:56:55,195
We took photographs.

522
00:56:57,398 --> 00:56:59,696
There's no need.

523
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:03,395
No, really.
I'd like you to have them.

524
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:05,962
Well, there's really no need.
This is, um--

525
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,840
<i>This is just a scrapbook.
They are too good.</i>

526
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:13,642
I should feel obliged.
Thank you.

527
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:31,424
And that would be unconscionable,
I suppose, wouldn't it?

528
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:34,093
To feel any obligation.

529
00:57:37,305 --> 00:57:40,240
Yes, of course it would.

530
00:58:09,704 --> 00:58:12,229
You should come into the shelter.

531
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:14,298
I'm quite all right, thank you.

532
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:18,243
- Look over there.
- What am I looking at?

533
00:58:18,313 --> 00:58:20,679
Do you see what's happening to them,
the stars?

534
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:24,240
- They're so untidy. I was trying to rearrange them.
- <i>No, no.</i>

535
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,287
Over there.

536
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,885
<i>In a few minutes, there'll be no stars.</i>

537
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,326
The air is filling with sand.

538
00:59:38,459 --> 00:59:42,088
- This is not very good, is it?
- No.

539
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,129
- Will we be all right?
- Yes.

540
00:59:49,203 --> 00:59:51,137
Yes.

541
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,404
Absolutely.

542
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:57,842
"Yes" is a comfort.
"Absolutely" is not.

543
01:00:13,995 --> 01:00:17,362
<i>Let me tell you about winds.</i>

544
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:20,299
<i>There is a, a whirlwind
from southern Morocco,</i>

545
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:22,632
the Aajej,

546
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:26,469
against which the Fellahin
defend themselves with knives.

547
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:32,145
And there is a, a Ghibli from Tunis.

548
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,545
- A Ghibli?
- A Ghibli.

549
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:38,381
Which rolls and rolls and rolls 
and produces a--

550
01:00:38,453 --> 01:00:41,911
a rather strange nervous condition.

551
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:48,118
And then there is the, the Harmatten,

552
01:00:48,196 --> 01:00:52,997
a red wind, which mariners call
"the sea of darkness".

553
01:00:54,268 --> 01:00:56,259
And red sand from this wind...

554
01:00:56,337 --> 01:00:59,238
has flown as far as
the south coast of England,

555
01:00:59,307 --> 01:01:01,741
apparently producing...

556
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:05,210
showers so dense that they were
mistaken for blood.

557
01:01:05,279 --> 01:01:08,043
Fiction!

558
01:01:08,115 --> 01:01:12,142
We have a house on that coast
and it has never, never rained blood.

559
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,155
No, it's all true.
Herodotus, your friend.

560
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:17,487
- My friend.
- Your fri--

561
01:01:17,558 --> 01:01:20,152
He writes about it...

562
01:01:20,228 --> 01:01:23,686
and he writes about...

563
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:27,165
a, a wind, the Simoon,

564
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:29,931
which a nation thought was so evil,

565
01:01:30,004 --> 01:01:33,440
they declared war on it
and marched out against it.

566
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:37,141
In full battle dress.

567
01:01:39,347 --> 01:01:42,214
<i>Their swords raised.</i>

568
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:10,477
Katharine, Katharine, 
I need to get out your side, quickly.

569
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:12,911
A car!
Let me out!

570
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,744
Of course.
I'm sorry.

571
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:18,046
Ridiculous to fall asleep!

572
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:20,178
Unforgivable!

573
01:02:20,254 --> 01:02:22,688
Damn!
The flare!

574
01:02:24,058 --> 01:02:25,992
Stop!
Over here!

575
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,290
<i>Here!</i>

576
01:02:28,362 --> 01:02:30,853
Stop!

577
01:02:30,932 --> 01:02:34,060
Madox!

578
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:37,536
<i>Madox! Madox!</i>

579
01:02:51,052 --> 01:02:53,247
Our tracks have disappeared.

580
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:56,813
Madox will calculate how many miles.
He'll soon turn around.

581
01:03:01,796 --> 01:03:04,765
Could I ask you, please, to...

582
01:03:04,832 --> 01:03:08,268
paste your paintings into my book.

583
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:10,531
<i>I-- I should like to have them.</i>

584
01:03:10,605 --> 01:03:13,073
I should be honored.

585
01:03:15,743 --> 01:03:18,906
The others!

586
01:03:20,081 --> 01:03:22,572
- Oh, God.
- <i>Quick!</i>

587
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:30,521
Oh, how awful!
We've got to get them out.

588
01:03:30,591 --> 01:03:33,321
Quick!
Get the other shovel!

589
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:39,900
Am I a terrible coward to ask 
how much water we have left?

590
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:43,926
A little in our can. We have, uh, 
water in the radiator, which can be drunk.

591
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:48,203
And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.
It's extremely practical.

592
01:03:48,275 --> 01:03:51,642
We, uh-- Oh, come on!
Come on!

593
01:03:51,712 --> 01:03:55,739
There's also a plant.

594
01:03:55,816 --> 01:04:00,185
I've never seen it, but I believe you can cut 
a piece the size of a heart from this plant,

595
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:03,690
and the next morning it'll be filled
with a delicious liquid.

596
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:07,592
Find that plant, cut out its heart.

597
01:04:11,532 --> 01:04:14,467
Here.

598
01:04:19,807 --> 01:04:22,173
Here's the window.

599
01:04:22,243 --> 01:04:25,212
<i>Clear the glass. I'll clear the door.
Mind your hands.</i>

600
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:28,339
It's okay. We're here.

601
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:30,976
Come on, clear it quickly.

602
01:04:33,054 --> 01:04:36,046
Hang on.
Coming.

603
01:04:44,398 --> 01:04:48,528
- I've got it. I've got it.
- Help them out. Here.

604
01:05:58,739 --> 01:06:01,105
<i>Katharine.</i>

605
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:07,880
<i>Water.</i>

606
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:26,429
<i>Geoffrey's not in Cairo.</i>

607
01:06:29,837 --> 01:06:32,670
He's not actually a buffoon.

608
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,731
The plane wasn't a wedding present.

609
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:37,505
It belongs to the British government.

610
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:40,945
They want aerial maps
of the whole of North Africa.

611
01:06:41,015 --> 01:06:43,779
So I think he's in Ethiopia.

612
01:06:45,853 --> 01:06:49,050
In case you're counting
on his sudden appearance.

613
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,721
And the marriage.

614
01:06:55,796 --> 01:06:58,060
Is that a fiction?

615
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:03,128
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

616
01:07:08,142 --> 01:07:11,202
Oh, thank God.

617
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,303
Thank God.

618
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,440
Madox.
It's Madox.

619
01:07:21,655 --> 01:07:24,522
Am I K in your book?

620
01:07:24,592 --> 01:07:26,856
I think I must be.

621
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:51,541
<i>Chapter one.</i>

622
01:07:51,619 --> 01:07:56,249
<i>"He sat in defiance of municipal orders
astride the gun Zamzammah--"</i>

623
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:59,884
<i>I can't read these words. I can't read them. 
They stick in my throat.</i>

624
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,360
<i>Because you're reading it too fast.</i>

625
01:08:02,429 --> 01:08:05,227
- Not at all.
- <i>You have to read Kipling slowly.</i>

626
01:08:05,299 --> 01:08:09,133
<i>Your eye is too impatient.
Think about the speed of his pen.</i>

627
01:08:09,203 --> 01:08:12,229
What is it?
"He sat, comma,

628
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:15,503
<i>"in defiance of municipal orders, comma,</i>

629
01:08:15,576 --> 01:08:18,545
"astride the gun Zamzammah...

630
01:08:18,612 --> 01:08:22,378
on her brick--"
What is it?

631
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:25,282
"Brick platform,
opposite the old Ajaib-Gher."

632
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:30,187
<i>"The wonder house, comma,</i>

633
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:33,852
as the natives called the Lahore Museum."

634
01:08:33,928 --> 01:08:37,193
<i>It's still there, the cannon,
outside the museum.</i>

635
01:08:37,264 --> 01:08:41,064
Made of metal cups and bowls taken
from every household in the city as tax,

636
01:08:41,135 --> 01:08:43,399
then melted down.

637
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,531
Then later, they fired the cannon 
at my people,

638
01:08:47,608 --> 01:08:51,374
comma, the natives.

639
01:08:51,445 --> 01:08:53,379
Full stop.

640
01:08:55,449 --> 01:08:57,383
What exactly is it you object to?

641
01:08:57,451 --> 01:09:00,352
The writer, or what he's writing about?

642
01:09:00,421 --> 01:09:04,289
What I really object to, Uncle,

643
01:09:04,358 --> 01:09:06,656
is your finishing all my condensed milk.

644
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:09,662
And the message everywhere in your book,
however slowly I read it,

645
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:12,858
that the best thing for India
is to be ruled by the British.

646
01:09:12,933 --> 01:09:16,300
Hana, we have discovered a shared pleasure, 
the boy and I.

647
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,930
- Arguing about books?
- <i>Condensed milk.</i>

648
01:09:19,006 --> 01:09:21,236
One of the truly great inventions.

649
01:09:21,308 --> 01:09:24,209
I'll get another tin.

650
01:09:24,278 --> 01:09:27,907
I didn't like that book either.
It's all about men.

651
01:09:27,982 --> 01:09:31,440
Too many men.
Just like this house.

652
01:09:31,518 --> 01:09:34,954
You like him, don't you?
Your voice changes.

653
01:09:35,022 --> 01:09:37,456
No, I don't think it does.

654
01:09:37,524 --> 01:09:40,015
Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

655
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:43,222
<i>I don't think it's indifference.</i>

656
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:45,788
- <i>Hana was just telling me, you're indifferent...</i>
- Hey!

657
01:09:45,866 --> 01:09:47,959
to her cooking.

658
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:51,427
Well, I'm indifferent to cooking.

659
01:09:51,505 --> 01:09:54,303
Not Hana's cooking in particular.

660
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:57,640
Have either of you tried
condensed milk sandwiches?

661
01:09:59,713 --> 01:10:02,614
They're very good with salt.

662
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:25,434
Welcome back, Madam.

663
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:40,109
Will you not come in?

664
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:42,382
No.

665
01:10:42,456 --> 01:10:45,516
- <i>I should go home.</i>
- Will you please come in?

666
01:10:46,727 --> 01:10:48,661
Mrs. Clifton.

667
01:10:51,165 --> 01:10:53,793
Don't.

668
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:55,835
I believe you still have my book.

669
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:13,910
Thank you.

670
01:12:38,105 --> 01:12:41,040
You still have sand in your hair.

671
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:07,399
<i>It wouldn't be make-believe</i>

672
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:10,868
<i>If you believe in me</i>

673
01:13:10,938 --> 01:13:14,430
<i>Without your love</i>

674
01:13:14,508 --> 01:13:16,874
I'm impressed you can sew.

675
01:13:16,944 --> 01:13:18,878
Good.

676
01:13:25,953 --> 01:13:28,581
You sew very badly.

677
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:30,987
Well, you don't sew at all.

678
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:32,992
A woman should never learn to sew,

679
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,654
and if she can,
she shouldn't admit to it.

680
01:13:43,437 --> 01:13:46,463
Close your eyes.

681
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,566
It makes it harder still.

682
01:13:52,379 --> 01:13:54,313
Hmm.

683
01:13:57,784 --> 01:14:00,048
When were you most happy?

684
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,816
Now.

685
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:06,489
And when were you least happy?

686
01:14:09,062 --> 01:14:11,053
Now.

687
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:17,834
- What do you love?
- What do I love?

688
01:14:17,904 --> 01:14:21,931
- Say everything.
- Let's see.

689
01:14:22,009 --> 01:14:24,102
- Water.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

690
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:29,109
Fish in it.

691
01:14:29,182 --> 01:14:32,083
And hedgehogs.
I love hedgehogs.

692
01:14:32,152 --> 01:14:34,086
And what else?

693
01:14:34,154 --> 01:14:37,089
Marmite.
I'm addicted.

694
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:42,158
And baths.
But not with other people.

695
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:48,926
Islands.

696
01:14:51,038 --> 01:14:53,472
And your handwriting.

697
01:14:55,442 --> 01:14:58,468
- Mmm.
- I could go on all day.

698
01:14:58,545 --> 01:15:00,536
Go on all day.

699
01:15:08,555 --> 01:15:10,887
My husband.

700
01:15:12,826 --> 01:15:15,260
And what do you hate most?

701
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:21,163
A lie.

702
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:25,666
What do you hate most?

703
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:31,503
Ownership.

704
01:15:31,578 --> 01:15:33,671
Being owned.

705
01:15:34,848 --> 01:15:37,612
When you leave,
you should forget me.

706
01:16:07,748 --> 01:16:11,206
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- <i>Don't you recognize me?</i>

707
01:16:11,284 --> 01:16:15,015
Is it you? So fat.

708
01:16:20,127 --> 01:16:22,391
- Hmm.
- <i>That's a Christmas cracker.</i>

709
01:16:22,462 --> 01:16:24,555
<i>Firecracker.</i>

710
01:16:24,631 --> 01:16:27,566
- This isn't your handwriting, is it?
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

711
01:16:29,136 --> 01:16:31,900
"December 22nd.

712
01:16:31,972 --> 01:16:35,464
"Betrayals in war are childlike...

713
01:16:35,542 --> 01:16:38,705
"compared with our betrayals during peace.

01:16:38,779 --> 01:16:43,045
"New lovers are nervous and tender...

715
01:16:44,184 --> 01:16:46,448
"but smash everything.

716
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:51,583
<i>For the heart is an organ of fire."</i>

717
01:16:54,261 --> 01:16:57,287
"For the heart is an organ of fire."

718
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,966
I love that.

719
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,029
I believe that.

720
01:17:08,341 --> 01:17:10,275
K?

721
01:17:11,645 --> 01:17:14,580
- Who is K?
- <i>K...</i>

722
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,316
is for Katharine.

723
01:17:28,962 --> 01:17:31,055
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

724
01:17:37,037 --> 01:17:40,268
- Say you're sick.
- What? No.

725
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:43,309
Say you're feeling faint.
The heat.

726
01:17:43,376 --> 01:17:46,243
- No.
- I can't work.

727
01:17:46,313 --> 01:17:50,579
- I can't sleep.
- <i>Katharine.</i>

728
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:52,811
Coming.

729
01:17:54,354 --> 01:17:57,687
I can't sleep. I wake up shouting
in the middle of the night.

730
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:02,091
- Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, trauma.
- I can still taste you.

731
01:18:05,665 --> 01:18:08,634
- Fill up this. It's empty.
- Oh.

732
01:18:08,702 --> 01:18:12,570
I try to write,
with your taste in my mouth.

733
01:18:15,842 --> 01:18:18,777
Swoon.

734
01:18:18,845 --> 01:18:21,473
They'll catch you.

735
01:18:24,184 --> 01:18:27,449
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

736
01:18:37,397 --> 01:18:40,628
- Come along with me now!
- Merry Christmas, everyone!

737
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,691
Merry Christmas!

738
01:18:42,769 --> 01:18:45,704
- <i>Katharine! Oh, my goodness!</i>
- Oh.

739
01:18:45,772 --> 01:18:47,797
<i>Fetch a chair.</i>

740
01:18:47,874 --> 01:18:49,842
No, I'm fine.

741
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:52,174
- It's this heat. It's terrible.
- Is she all right?

742
01:18:52,245 --> 01:18:55,078
- She's quite all right.
- Oh, good.

743
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,912
- Are you pregnant?
- Oh, I don't think so, no.

744
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,975
How romantic.

745
01:19:00,053 --> 01:19:02,385
With Fiona, I fell over 
every five minutes.

746
01:19:02,455 --> 01:19:05,549
Ronnie christened me "Lady Downfall."

747
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:09,789
Do you know, I think I might go inside
and sit down for a few minutes.

748
01:19:09,863 --> 01:19:12,957
- I'll come with you.
- No, I'll be all right. You stay here.

749
01:19:13,033 --> 01:19:15,365
Are you sure?

750
01:20:01,147 --> 01:20:05,584
<i>Silent night</i>

751
01:20:05,652 --> 01:20:09,952
<i>Holy night</i>

752
01:20:10,023 --> 01:20:13,925
<i>All is calm</i>

753
01:20:13,994 --> 01:20:18,693
<i>All is bright</i>

754
01:20:18,765 --> 01:20:23,395
<i>Round yon virgin</i>

755
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:26,405
<i>And her child</i>

756
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:45,055
<i>Silent night</i>

757
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:49,118
<i>Holy night</i>

758
01:20:49,195 --> 01:20:54,428
<i>All is calm</i>

759
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:58,528
<i>All is bright</i>

760
01:21:28,435 --> 01:21:35,637
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

761
01:21:38,578 --> 01:21:41,172
Happy Christmas!

762
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:48,010
<i>God save our gracious king</i>

763
01:21:48,088 --> 01:21:50,784
- Have you seen Katharine?
- What?

764
01:21:50,857 --> 01:21:53,121
- It's Clifton under here.
- <i>Oh.</i>

765
01:21:53,193 --> 01:21:56,060
No, I haven't. Sorry.

766
01:21:57,130 --> 01:22:01,032
<i>Send him victorious</i>

767
01:22:01,101 --> 01:22:04,298
Darling, I just heard.

768
01:22:05,972 --> 01:22:08,406
You poor sausage.
Are you all right?

769
01:22:08,475 --> 01:22:11,069
I'm fine.
I'm just too hot.

770
01:22:11,144 --> 01:22:13,612
Lady H thought you might be pregnant.

771
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,673
I'm not pregnant. I'm just hot.
Too hot, like you.

772
01:22:17,751 --> 01:22:20,720
I'm sweltering, in fact.

773
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:26,588
Come on, I'll take you home.

774
01:22:26,659 --> 01:22:31,221
Can we really go home?
I can't breathe.

775
01:22:31,297 --> 01:22:35,165
<i>I am dying for green.
Anything green, or rain.</i>

776
01:22:35,235 --> 01:22:40,366
It's Christmas and it's all--
Oh, I don't know.

777
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:49,107
If you asked me, I'd go home tomorrow.
If you wanted.

778
01:22:49,182 --> 01:22:53,141
Darling, you know we can't go home.
There might be a war.

779
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,894
Oh, Geoffrey,
you do so love a disguise.

780
01:23:01,961 --> 01:23:03,952
I do so love you.

781
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:08,333
Mmm.

782
01:23:09,602 --> 01:23:12,537
- What do you smell of?
- What?

783
01:23:14,541 --> 01:23:18,807
Marzipan. I think you've got marzipan 
in your hair.

784
01:23:18,878 --> 01:23:21,369
No wonder you're homesick.

785
01:23:43,069 --> 01:23:45,003
Is it you?

786
01:23:46,072 --> 01:23:47,505
What?

787
01:23:48,808 --> 01:23:50,799
If I said "Moose"--

788
01:23:50,877 --> 01:23:53,846
Moose?
Who the hell's Moose?

789
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:58,742
I look different.

790
01:23:58,818 --> 01:24:01,252
Why shouldn't you?

791
01:24:07,327 --> 01:24:09,386
<i>I heard your breathing.</i>

792
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:13,421
I thought it was the rain.
I'm dying for rain.

793
01:24:13,499 --> 01:24:16,730
Well, I'm dying anyway, but I--

794
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:20,136
I long for the rain on my face.

795
01:24:20,206 --> 01:24:23,232
First wedding anniversary,
what do you call it?

796
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,767
Ha, I don't know.
Paper?

797
01:24:26,846 --> 01:24:30,145
<i>Is it?
I don't know.</i>

798
01:24:30,216 --> 01:24:32,150
Paper.

799
01:24:33,218 --> 01:24:34,584
Paper?

800
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:36,815
Darling, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry, something's come up.

801
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:39,518
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- Now don't sulk. I'll be back tomorrow evening.

802
01:24:39,592 --> 01:24:42,425
<i>I'm going to sulk, and I'm not moving
till you get back here.</i>

803
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:44,520
Promise?
That's good.

804
01:24:44,597 --> 01:24:47,031
Okay, my sausage, I love you.

805
01:24:50,036 --> 01:24:52,971
- I didn't know you were going anywhere.
- I'm not.

806
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:57,442
I'm going to surprise her. It's our anniversary. 
She's forgotten, of course.

807
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,910
What's the symbol of your first anniversary? 
I should get something.

808
01:24:59,979 --> 01:25:01,947
<i>Is it cotton or paper?</i>

809
01:25:02,015 --> 01:25:05,075
Your first anniversary? I thought you two'd 
been married for donkey's years.

810
01:25:05,151 --> 01:25:08,416
We've been friends for donkey's years.
Best friends.

811
01:25:08,488 --> 01:25:11,423
She was always crying on my shoulder 
about somebody.

812
01:25:11,491 --> 01:25:15,427
I finally persuaded her to settle for my shoulder. 
A stroke of genius.

813
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,890
- Moose, are you there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

814
01:25:20,967 --> 01:25:24,903
- First anniversary. Is that cotton?
- Uh, is what cotton?

815
01:25:24,971 --> 01:25:27,735
First wedding anniversary.

816
01:25:27,807 --> 01:25:30,503
Your first anniversary is... paper.

817
01:25:43,489 --> 01:25:46,617
- Stop.
- Please?

818
01:25:46,693 --> 01:25:48,684
S-- Stop here.

819
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:51,025
- Here?
- <i>Just stop right here.</i>

820
01:25:51,097 --> 01:25:53,224
Yes, sir.

821
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,600
This--
What is this?

822
01:26:33,072 --> 01:26:35,506
It's a folk song.

823
01:26:35,575 --> 01:26:38,635
- <i>Arabic.</i>
- No, no, it's Hungarian.

824
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:43,104
My <i>daijka</i> sang it to me.

825
01:26:43,182 --> 01:26:46,913
When I was a child growing up in Budapest.

826
01:26:53,926 --> 01:26:55,917
It's beautiful.

827
01:26:55,995 --> 01:26:58,156
Hmm.

828
01:26:58,231 --> 01:27:00,597
What's it about?

829
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,657
<i>Szerelem</i> means love.

830
01:27:02,735 --> 01:27:05,966
And the story--
Well, there's, um,

831
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:08,599
this Hungarian count.

832
01:27:08,674 --> 01:27:10,665
He's a wanderer.
He's a fool.

833
01:27:10,743 --> 01:27:14,941
<i>And for years he's 
on some kind of a quest for...</i>

834
01:27:15,014 --> 01:27:17,448
who knows what.

835
01:27:17,517 --> 01:27:23,319
And then one day, he falls under the spell 
of a mysterious English woman,

836
01:27:23,389 --> 01:27:27,120
a harpy, who beats him and hits him.

837
01:27:27,193 --> 01:27:30,788
And he becomes her slave
and he sews her clothes and worships--

838
01:27:30,863 --> 01:27:32,854
Stop!
Stop it!

839
01:27:32,932 --> 01:27:35,526
Stop! You're always beating me.

840
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:37,626
Bastard.

841
01:27:37,703 --> 01:27:40,001
You bastard!
I believed you!

842
01:27:40,073 --> 01:27:43,474
You should be my slave.

843
01:27:49,082 --> 01:27:53,815
I claim this shoulder blade--

844
01:27:53,886 --> 01:27:57,686
No, wait. No, I want--
Turn over.

845
01:27:57,757 --> 01:28:01,750
I want this, this-- this place.

846
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:06,892
I love this place.
What's it called?

847
01:28:09,602 --> 01:28:12,469
This is mine.

848
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:16,872
I'm going to ask the king permission
to call it the Almasy Bosphorus.

849
01:28:20,046 --> 01:28:23,174
I thought we were against ownership.

850
01:28:31,824 --> 01:28:34,224
I can stay tonight.

851
01:28:40,533 --> 01:28:42,694
Madox knows, I think.

852
01:28:42,768 --> 01:28:45,430
He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.

853
01:28:45,505 --> 01:28:49,066
I think it's his idea 
of a man-to-man chat.

854
01:28:49,142 --> 01:28:51,872
Well, it's my idea
of a man-to-man chat.

855
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:00,917
This is a different world,
is what I tell myself.

856
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:06,524
A different life.

857
01:29:08,261 --> 01:29:11,788
And here I'm a different wife.

858
01:29:14,467 --> 01:29:16,992
Yes.

859
01:29:17,069 --> 01:29:20,561
Here you are a different wife.

860
01:29:56,943 --> 01:29:59,878
Oh, they're darling.
What are they? Thimbles?

861
01:29:59,946 --> 01:30:03,040
Yes, and they're quite old.

862
01:30:03,115 --> 01:30:05,242
It's full of saffron.

863
01:30:05,318 --> 01:30:09,015
Just in case you think I'm going to 
give it to you to encourage your sewing.

864
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:19,163
I don't care to bargain.

865
01:30:20,633 --> 01:30:23,295
That day, did you follow me
to the market?

866
01:30:23,369 --> 01:30:25,633
Yes, of course.

867
01:30:31,744 --> 01:30:34,406
Shall we be all right?

868
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,414
Yes.

869
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:39,350
Yes.

870
01:30:41,954 --> 01:30:43,945
Absolutely.

871
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:45,957
Oh, dear.

872
01:30:47,293 --> 01:30:50,592
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

873
01:30:50,663 --> 01:30:53,598
<i>Oh, I love to go out fishing</i>

874
01:30:56,569 --> 01:30:59,732
<i>But I don't enjoy it half as much</i>

875
01:30:59,805 --> 01:31:02,865
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

876
01:31:02,942 --> 01:31:05,342
<i>Dance with me</i>

877
01:31:05,411 --> 01:31:08,244
<i>I want my arms about you</i>

878
01:31:08,314 --> 01:31:11,374
<i>The charm about you</i>

879
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:16,012
<i>Will carry me through to heaven</i>

880
01:31:16,088 --> 01:31:19,683
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

881
01:31:19,759 --> 01:31:26,062
<i>And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak</i>

882
01:31:29,035 --> 01:31:32,061
<i>And I seem to find the happiness I seek</i>

883
01:31:32,104 --> 01:31:37,565
<i>When we're off together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

884
01:31:39,445 --> 01:31:42,642
- Thought you'd never wake up.
- What?

885
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:46,612
- Where did you find that?
- I liberated it.

886
01:31:46,686 --> 01:31:51,282
- I think that's called looting.
- No one should own music. The real question is:

887
01:31:51,357 --> 01:31:52,790
- Who wrote the song?
- Irving Berlin.

888
01:31:52,858 --> 01:31:54,291
- For?
- <i>Top Hat.</i>

889
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,590
Is there a song you don't know?

890
01:31:56,662 --> 01:31:59,961
<i>Nope. He sings all the time.</i>

891
01:32:00,032 --> 01:32:03,763
Good morning. Did you know that?
You're always singing.

892
01:32:03,836 --> 01:32:06,703
I've been told before.

893
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:10,299
Kip's another one.

894
01:32:14,313 --> 01:32:16,941
"Wang Wang Blues."

895
01:32:17,016 --> 01:32:18,779
You're incredible.

896
01:32:27,393 --> 01:32:29,657
- Good mornin', Miss.
- Hello.

897
01:32:29,729 --> 01:32:32,493
<i>You saved my life.</i>

898
01:32:32,565 --> 01:32:36,126
I haven't forgotten.

899
01:32:36,202 --> 01:32:38,966
<i>I thought you were very, very tall.</i>

900
01:32:39,038 --> 01:32:43,202
You seemed so big and... giant.

901
01:32:43,275 --> 01:32:45,971
I felt like a child
who can't keep her balance.

902
01:32:46,045 --> 01:32:49,845
- A toddler.
- A toddler.

903
01:33:13,606 --> 01:33:16,040
My hair was long at some point.

904
01:33:19,311 --> 01:33:23,577
I've forgotten what a nuisance 
it is to wash.

905
01:33:25,885 --> 01:33:29,013
Try this. I found a great jar of it.

906
01:33:29,088 --> 01:33:31,022
Olive oil.

907
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:33,024
Thank you.

908
01:33:41,567 --> 01:33:44,400
Is this for my hair?

909
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:47,564
Yes, for your hair.

910
01:33:55,648 --> 01:33:58,344
There was a general who wore a patch...

911
01:33:58,417 --> 01:34:01,284
over a perfectly good eye.

912
01:34:01,353 --> 01:34:04,481
<i>The men fought harder for him.</i>

913
01:34:10,196 --> 01:34:13,597
Sometimes I think
I could get up and dance.

914
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:16,894
What's under your mittens?

915
01:34:23,008 --> 01:34:25,033
What's under your mittens?

916
01:34:47,132 --> 01:34:49,566
He's waiting for you.

917
01:34:49,635 --> 01:34:51,125
I'll see you tonight?

918
01:34:54,073 --> 01:34:56,371
Look, Moose, we need you
to stay in Tobruk.

919
01:34:56,442 --> 01:35:00,469
I know it's a bit of a short straw,
but Jerry's got our maps, you know.

920
01:35:00,546 --> 01:35:03,413
And now they're getting their spies 
into Cairo using our maps.

921
01:35:03,482 --> 01:35:06,144
They'll get Rommel into Cairo
using our maps.

922
01:35:06,218 --> 01:35:09,813
The whole of the desert's like a bloody bus route, 
and we gave it to 'em!

923
01:35:09,889 --> 01:35:11,823
Any foreigner who turned up:

924
01:35:11,891 --> 01:35:14,451
"Welcome to the Royal Geographic.
Take our maps."

925
01:35:14,527 --> 01:35:16,461
Old Madox went mad, you know.

926
01:35:16,529 --> 01:35:18,588
- Did you know Peter Madox?
- Yeah.

927
01:35:18,664 --> 01:35:21,258
Magnificent explorer.
Thanks, Aicha.

928
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:23,995
And after he found out
he'd been betrayed by Almasy.

929
01:35:24,069 --> 01:35:26,333
His best friend.

930
01:35:26,405 --> 01:35:29,135
Absolutely destroyed the poor sot.

931
01:35:48,861 --> 01:35:51,125
<i>Hey, Commandant, stay in line!</i>

932
01:36:09,248 --> 01:36:13,207
Hello, little Tommy.
Little baby, hello.

933
01:36:14,587 --> 01:36:16,885
- <i>Recognize him? British friend?</i>
- No.

934
01:36:17,956 --> 01:36:19,948
Aaah!

935
01:36:22,394 --> 01:36:25,022
- Get up!
- No!

936
01:36:25,097 --> 01:36:27,031
<i>Get up at once!</i>

937
01:36:27,099 --> 01:36:30,034
<i>No, I don't have a boyfriend.</i>

938
01:36:30,102 --> 01:36:32,662
<i>I don't know anybody!</i>

939
01:36:32,738 --> 01:36:35,229
Halt!

940
01:36:35,307 --> 01:36:39,243
<i>No! No!</i>

941
01:36:48,354 --> 01:36:50,948
<i>David Caravaggio.</i>

942
01:36:51,023 --> 01:36:54,720
- No.
- <i>This was taken in Cairo at British headquarters.</i>

943
01:36:54,793 --> 01:36:57,523
July '41.

944
01:36:57,596 --> 01:36:59,723
And so was this.

945
01:36:59,798 --> 01:37:03,199
August '41.
And this.

946
01:37:03,268 --> 01:37:05,236
February '42.

947
01:37:05,304 --> 01:37:08,068
It's possible.

948
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:11,439
I was buying or selling something.
I've been to Cairo many times.

949
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:15,412
You are a Canadian spy
working for the Allies.

950
01:37:15,481 --> 01:37:18,575
Code name: Moose.

951
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:30,962
Can you get me a doctor?
I'm sick.

952
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:34,466
<i>I'm leaking blood!</i>

953
01:37:34,533 --> 01:37:36,501
You want a doctor?

954
01:37:36,568 --> 01:37:38,661
I've been askin' for weeks, months--

955
01:37:38,737 --> 01:37:40,830
We don't have a doctor.

956
01:37:40,906 --> 01:37:43,272
But we do have a nurse.

957
01:37:43,342 --> 01:37:45,606
Sure, great.
A nurse would be great.

958
01:37:47,746 --> 01:37:51,978
Look, give me something.
A name, a code.

959
01:37:52,051 --> 01:37:54,747
So we can all get out of this room.

960
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:58,654
I can't think in this heat.

961
01:37:58,724 --> 01:38:02,319
- It's too hot.
- I slept with a girl.

962
01:38:04,029 --> 01:38:06,657
I've got a wife in Tripoli.

963
01:38:06,732 --> 01:38:11,226
<i>A girl comes up and points at you, 
you only see trouble.</i>

964
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:14,500
<i>Fire!</i>

965
01:38:16,008 --> 01:38:18,272
<i>I'll tell you what I'm going to do.</i>

966
01:38:18,343 --> 01:38:21,005
This is your nurse, by the way.

967
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,878
She's Muslim, 
so she'll understand all of this.

968
01:38:23,949 --> 01:38:27,908
What's the punishment for adultery?
Let's leave it at that.

969
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:31,444
You're married and you were fucking 
another woman, so that's, uh--

970
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:35,892
Is it the hands that are cut off?

971
01:38:35,961 --> 01:38:38,896
Or is that for stealing?
Does anyone know?

972
01:38:38,964 --> 01:38:42,161
Well, you must know.
You were brought up in Libya, yes?

973
01:38:42,234 --> 01:38:44,702
- Don't cut me.
- Or was it Toronto?

974
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:47,705
Ten fingers.

975
01:38:47,773 --> 01:38:49,707
How about this?

976
01:38:49,775 --> 01:38:52,505
You give me a name for every finger.
It doesn't matter who.

977
01:38:52,578 --> 01:38:55,547
<i>I get something, you keep something.</i>

978
01:38:55,614 --> 01:38:57,912
- <i>I'm trying to be reasonable.</i>
- Don't cut me. Come on!

979
01:39:02,254 --> 01:39:04,313
Are thumbs fingers?

980
01:39:12,431 --> 01:39:15,161
- I get no help from these people.
- Telephone.

981
01:39:15,234 --> 01:39:19,330
<i>I'm sick of this room, 
I'm sick of this heat and I'm sick of this phone!</i>

982
01:39:26,845 --> 01:39:28,710
<i>Ah! The Geneva Convention!</i>

983
01:39:28,781 --> 01:39:32,114
Hey, come on!
You can't do that!

984
01:39:32,184 --> 01:39:34,675
- Come over here.
- I'll give you names.

985
01:39:34,753 --> 01:39:37,916
- <i>You!</i>
- <i>I'll give you names!</i>

986
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:40,015
- Come on!
- What names did you say?

987
01:39:40,092 --> 01:39:44,586
<i>Aaah! Aaah! Let me think!
Just let me think!</i>

988
01:39:44,663 --> 01:39:47,894
<i>I can't think! I know them!
Please, let me think!</i>

989
01:39:47,966 --> 01:39:50,230
I promise!
Oh, please, please, no!

990
01:39:50,302 --> 01:39:53,430
- What name did you say? I knew them!
- Come on!

991
01:39:53,505 --> 01:39:56,770
- I can't think of any names! Not my hands! Oh, dear God!
- <i>What are you waiting for?</i>

992
01:39:56,842 --> 01:39:59,902
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, no!

993
01:39:59,978 --> 01:40:02,538
I promise!
Oh, please, not my hands!

994
01:40:02,614 --> 01:40:06,710
<i>No! Jesus!
Jesus! Oh, dear God!</i>

995
01:40:06,785 --> 01:40:08,650
- <i>Please don't cut me!</i>
- Come on!

996
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:11,314
Aaah!
No!

997
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:13,551
<i>Please don't cut!</i>

998
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:15,528
<i>Don't!</i>

999
01:40:18,597 --> 01:40:22,192
<i>The man who took my thumbs?</i>

1000
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:26,260
<i>I found him eventually.
I killed him.</i>

1001
01:40:26,338 --> 01:40:28,932
The man who took my photograph?
I found him too.

1002
01:40:29,007 --> 01:40:33,205
That took me a year.
He's dead.

1003
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,542
Another man showed the Germans...

1004
01:40:35,614 --> 01:40:38,412
a way to get their spies into Cairo.

1005
01:40:38,483 --> 01:40:41,748
I've been looking for him.

1006
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:44,584
<i>You can't get through there.
It's impossible.</i>

1007
01:40:44,656 --> 01:40:47,056
<i>I was looking again 
at Bell's old maps.</i>

1008
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,252
<i>If we can find a way through the Wadi,</i>

1009
01:40:49,328 --> 01:40:52,126
<i>we can drive straight into Cairo.</i>

1010
01:40:52,197 --> 01:40:54,995
- This whole spur is a real possibility.
- <i>So on Thursday,</i>

1011
01:40:55,067 --> 01:40:57,763
you don't trust Bell's map, Bell was a fool, 
Bell couldn't draw a map.

1012
01:40:57,836 --> 01:41:00,669
But on Friday,
he's suddenly infallible.

1013
01:41:00,739 --> 01:41:03,640
- And where are the expedition maps?
- In my room.

1014
01:41:03,709 --> 01:41:06,143
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.

1015
01:41:06,211 --> 01:41:09,044
They shouldn't be left lying around for 
any Tom, Dick or Harry to have sight of.

1016
01:41:09,114 --> 01:41:11,708
What on earth's the matter with you?

1017
01:41:11,783 --> 01:41:15,014
Don't be so bloody naive!
You know there's a war breaking out!

1018
01:41:22,127 --> 01:41:24,322
This arrived this morning.

1019
01:41:24,396 --> 01:41:26,660
"By order of the British Government,

1020
01:41:26,732 --> 01:41:31,101
all international expeditions
to be aborted by May, 1939."

1021
01:41:34,539 --> 01:41:38,031
What do they care about our maps?

1022
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:40,578
What do we find in the desert?

1023
01:41:40,646 --> 01:41:43,240
Arrowheads, spears.

1024
01:41:43,315 --> 01:41:46,250
In a war, if you own the desert,
you own North Africa.

1025
01:41:46,318 --> 01:41:48,980
Own the desert?
Ha!

1026
01:41:50,055 --> 01:41:53,752
Um, Madox?
That place--

1027
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:59,357
That place at the base of a woman's throat.

1028
01:42:00,966 --> 01:42:04,493
<i>You know, the hollow here.</i>

1029
01:42:04,569 --> 01:42:06,867
Does it have an official name?

1030
01:42:08,941 --> 01:42:12,672
For God's sake, man,
pull yourself together.

1031
01:42:23,188 --> 01:42:26,123
<i>Nowhere is there any 
wild patriotic excitement,</i>

1032
01:42:26,191 --> 01:42:28,250
<i>but everywhere there is
a deep hatred of war.</i>

1033
01:42:28,327 --> 01:42:30,989
<i>The answer lies with one man,</i>

1034
01:42:31,063 --> 01:42:34,624
<i>and the solid mass of the crowd
surging round his car...</i>

1035
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:38,397
<i>are a symbol that the British people 
are more firmly of one mind today...</i>

1036
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:41,701
<i>than at any other time
in our history.</i>

1037
01:42:46,845 --> 01:42:49,905
<i>There's a great to-do in Sandown Bay,</i>

1038
01:42:49,982 --> 01:42:53,816
<i>with rowing and sailing, 
and no end of sport for every water baby.</i>

1039
01:42:56,655 --> 01:42:59,419
Sorry.

1040
01:43:02,327 --> 01:43:05,057
I can't--
I can't do this.

1041
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:11,869
I can't do this.
I can't do this anymore.

1042
01:43:40,499 --> 01:43:42,763
I'd better go now.

1043
01:43:45,203 --> 01:43:47,637
Say goodbye here.

1044
01:43:47,706 --> 01:43:51,403
I'm not agreeing. 
Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.

1045
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:53,501
Any minute now, he'll find out.

1046
01:43:53,578 --> 01:43:55,569
We'll barge into someone.
It'll kill him.

1047
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:57,740
Don't go over it again, please.

1048
01:44:08,627 --> 01:44:11,323
Katharine?

1049
01:44:15,267 --> 01:44:17,497
I--

1050
01:44:17,569 --> 01:44:20,663
I just want you to know I'm--

1051
01:44:20,739 --> 01:44:23,401
I'm not missing you yet.

1052
01:44:25,744 --> 01:44:29,646
You will.
You will.

1053
01:45:02,513 --> 01:45:04,949
I believe I'm rather late.

1054
01:45:06,318 --> 01:45:08,843
Good.
We're all here.

1055
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:13,050
<i>A toast to the International Sand Club.</i>

1056
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:15,525
May it soon resurface.

1057
01:45:15,594 --> 01:45:17,494
The International Sand Club.

1058
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:22,590
The International Sand Club:
misfits, buggers, fascists and fools.

1059
01:45:22,667 --> 01:45:25,261
God bless us, every one.
Oops!

1060
01:45:25,337 --> 01:45:28,932
Mustn't say "International".
Dirty word, filthy word.

1061
01:45:29,007 --> 01:45:32,272
<i>His Majesty, die Fuhrer, il Duce--</i>

1062
01:45:32,344 --> 01:45:33,811
Sorry.
What's your point?

1063
01:45:33,879 --> 01:45:36,905
And the people here don't want us.
You must be joking.

1064
01:45:36,982 --> 01:45:40,941
Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the colonials. 
Isn't that right, Fouad?

1065
01:45:41,019 --> 01:45:44,318
<i>Some of their best people 
getting down on their hands and knees,</i>

1066
01:45:44,389 --> 01:45:46,880
begging to be spared the Knighthood.

1067
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:50,416
Isn't that right? Hmm?
Isn't that right, Sir Ronnie?

1068
01:45:50,495 --> 01:45:54,329
What's my point?
Oh, I've invented a new dance.

1069
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:56,492
<i>Anybody up for it?
It's called--</i>

1070
01:45:56,568 --> 01:45:59,128
It's called the Bosphorus Hug.

1071
01:45:59,204 --> 01:46:00,899
Madox?

1072
01:46:00,972 --> 01:46:05,432
<i>Bermann?
You'll dance with me? Hmm?</i>

1073
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:08,445
D'Ag.
Come on, Daggers.

1074
01:46:08,513 --> 01:46:11,004
<i>Let's eat first.
Sit down.</i>

1075
01:46:13,852 --> 01:46:17,253
<i>We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten</i>

1076
01:46:17,322 --> 01:46:20,086
<i>When you're in your bathing suit so thin</i>

1077
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:22,752
<i>We'll make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin</i>

1078
01:46:22,827 --> 01:46:25,819
<i>They're playing it far too slowly,
but these were the words,</i>

1079
01:46:25,897 --> 01:46:29,663
actually, before they were cleaned up.

1080
01:46:29,734 --> 01:46:32,828
Might be a song for you, Mrs. Clif--

1081
01:46:32,904 --> 01:46:35,338
<i>You either shut up or go home! 
You're completely blasted!</i>

1082
01:46:35,407 --> 01:46:38,205
- Sit down!
- Absolutely right! Shut up! Shut up!

1083
01:46:38,276 --> 01:46:42,713
<i>Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.</i>

1084
01:46:42,781 --> 01:46:45,477
I can't think what came over me.

1085
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:48,542
Lashings of apologies...

1086
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:50,815
all around.

1087
01:47:23,388 --> 01:47:24,855
Thank you.

1088
01:47:34,899 --> 01:47:38,164
- Why were you holding his collar?
- What?

1089
01:47:38,236 --> 01:47:41,672
"What"? That boy.
That little boy.

1090
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:44,903
You were holding his collar.
You were gripping his collar. What for?

1091
01:47:44,976 --> 01:47:47,444
Hmm?
Is he next?

1092
01:47:47,512 --> 01:47:50,174
Are you going to drag him
into your little room? Where is it?

1093
01:47:50,248 --> 01:47:52,148
Is this it?

1094
01:47:52,217 --> 01:47:54,481
- Don't do this.
- I've watched you.

1095
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:56,918
I've watched you at garden parties,

1096
01:47:56,988 --> 01:47:59,252
on verandas, at the races.

1097
01:47:59,324 --> 01:48:03,283
- How can you... stand there?
- Please.

1098
01:48:03,361 --> 01:48:06,228
How can you ever smile,

1099
01:48:06,298 --> 01:48:10,325
as if your life hadn't capsized?

1100
01:48:12,003 --> 01:48:14,471
You know why?

1101
01:48:17,075 --> 01:48:19,066
Dance with me.

1102
01:48:20,145 --> 01:48:22,545
No.

1103
01:48:22,614 --> 01:48:25,583
Dance with me.

1104
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:28,585
I want to touch you.

1105
01:48:28,653 --> 01:48:32,589
I want the things which are mine,
which belong to me.

1106
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:39,452
Do you think you're the only one 
who feels anything?

1107
01:48:39,531 --> 01:48:42,500
Is that what you think?

1108
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:04,345
Why don't you go?

1109
01:49:04,422 --> 01:49:08,085
- Get some sleep.
- Would you like me to?

1110
01:49:14,966 --> 01:49:17,799
Good night.

1111
01:50:22,367 --> 01:50:24,301
<i>Hana.</i>

1112
01:50:29,374 --> 01:50:31,672
Kip.

1113
01:51:05,555 --> 01:51:08,786
Just wait.
Don't look at anything yet.

1114
01:51:31,514 --> 01:51:33,573
Wait.

1115
01:51:49,899 --> 01:51:51,992
Kip!

1116
01:53:12,715 --> 01:53:15,047
Oh, thank you!

1117
01:53:16,052 --> 01:53:18,179
Mmm!

1118
01:53:31,834 --> 01:53:35,793
If one night I didn't come to see you,

1119
01:53:37,306 --> 01:53:39,866
what would you do?

1120
01:53:39,942 --> 01:53:42,775
I try not to expect you.

1121
01:53:45,648 --> 01:53:49,709
Yes, but if it got late and...

1122
01:53:49,785 --> 01:53:52,413
I hadn't shown up?

1123
01:53:53,856 --> 01:53:57,223
Then I'd think there must be a reason.

1124
01:53:58,294 --> 01:54:00,728
You wouldn't come to find me?

1125
01:54:03,065 --> 01:54:06,626
Hmm. That makes me never want to come here.

1126
01:54:11,507 --> 01:54:13,771
Then I'd tell myself,

1127
01:54:13,843 --> 01:54:17,108
he spends all day searching.

1128
01:54:17,179 --> 01:54:20,114
In the night, he wants to be found.

1129
01:54:25,521 --> 01:54:28,456
I do. I do want you to find me.

1130
01:54:29,525 --> 01:54:31,959
<i>I do want to be found.</i>

1131
01:54:49,478 --> 01:54:52,072
I was looking for Lieutenant Singh.

1132
01:54:52,148 --> 01:54:56,209
- He's sleeping.
- Only we've got to go to work.

1133
01:54:56,285 --> 01:54:58,753
I'll tell him.

1134
01:54:59,955 --> 01:55:02,549
What is it?
Is it a mine?

1135
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:05,355
It's a bomb by a viaduct.

1136
01:55:06,662 --> 01:55:09,324
- Does he have to go?
- Beg pardon?

1137
01:55:09,398 --> 01:55:13,334
What if you couldn't find him?
Sergeant, not today. Not this morning.

1138
01:55:13,402 --> 01:55:17,338
- What's happening? Am I needed?
- Afraid so, sir.

1139
01:55:19,407 --> 01:55:21,501
<i>Don't go.
I'm frightened.</i>

1140
01:55:21,577 --> 01:55:24,546
This is what I do.

1141
01:55:24,613 --> 01:55:27,605
I do this every day.

1142
01:55:46,602 --> 01:55:48,593
Hardy!

1143
01:55:48,671 --> 01:55:51,834
Serial number K-K-I-P...

1144
01:55:51,907 --> 01:55:54,705
2-6-0-0.

1145
01:55:54,777 --> 01:55:57,769
<i>K-K-I-P2600, sir!</i>

1146
01:55:57,847 --> 01:56:00,338
I'll get the oxygen.

1147
01:56:56,672 --> 01:56:59,664
<i>Hardy, what's happening?</i>

1148
01:56:59,742 --> 01:57:02,711
<i>Can't see, sir!
It's from the road!</i>

1149
01:57:04,246 --> 01:57:07,545
Corporal?

1150
01:57:07,616 --> 01:57:11,017
Tanks, sir!
I don't know what it's about!

1151
01:57:11,086 --> 01:57:14,021
- Stop 'em!
- Stop!

1152
01:57:14,089 --> 01:57:16,455
Stop!

1153
01:57:16,525 --> 01:57:19,926
- Hardy!
- Stop! Stop!

1154
01:57:19,995 --> 01:57:22,088
What is this, a bloody carnival?

1155
01:57:22,164 --> 01:57:24,189
The fuse has snapped!

1156
01:57:24,266 --> 01:57:28,100
<i>What's happened? Is it armed?</i>

1157
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:31,537
Hang on a second.

1158
01:57:31,607 --> 01:57:33,472
<i>I'll be right with you.</i>

1159
01:57:33,542 --> 01:57:36,909
<i>Can you see the detonator, sir?</i>

1160
01:57:36,979 --> 01:57:39,812
You've got to cut it, sir.
That frost won't last.

1161
01:57:41,183 --> 01:57:44,152
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

1162
01:57:48,357 --> 01:57:51,758
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

1163
01:57:51,827 --> 01:57:54,591
- Go away!
- Yes, sir.

1164
01:57:54,663 --> 01:57:58,429
- This is making me incredibly angry.
- I know, sir.

1165
01:57:59,501 --> 01:58:01,560
<i>Watch out!
That'll burn!</i>

1166
01:58:01,637 --> 01:58:03,468
Ow!

1167
01:58:08,377 --> 01:58:10,777
<i>Can you feel 'em?</i>

1168
01:58:20,723 --> 01:58:23,191
Cut it, sir.

1169
01:58:23,259 --> 01:58:25,750
- <i>You've gotta cut it!</i>
- I don't even know if this is the right wire.

1170
01:58:25,828 --> 01:58:29,423
<i>Choose. Just choose a loop 
and cut it.</i>

1171
01:58:51,687 --> 01:58:55,214
Get a blanket! Spaulding, 
get a blanket for Lieutenant!

1172
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:58,818
Sarge! Sarge!
It's over, sir! It's over!

1173
01:58:58,894 --> 01:59:01,886
- Jerry's surrendered!
- Yeah-ha!

1174
01:59:06,902 --> 01:59:08,836
Sir, congratulations.

1175
01:59:10,673 --> 01:59:15,804
<i>Heaven
I'm in heaven</i>

1176
01:59:15,878 --> 01:59:18,608
Kip? Kip?

1177
01:59:18,681 --> 01:59:20,615
Kip!

1178
01:59:20,683 --> 01:59:24,483
<i>And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak</i>

1179
01:59:24,553 --> 01:59:29,684
<i>And I seem to find
the happiness I seek</i>

1180
01:59:29,758 --> 01:59:32,056
Hey, we're goin' home!

1181
01:59:32,127 --> 01:59:37,121
<i>When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

1182
01:59:39,466 --> 01:59:41,698
It's raining.

1183
01:59:46,008 --> 01:59:49,774
<i>And the cares that hung around me 
through the week</i>

1184
01:59:52,548 --> 02:00:00,250
<i>Seem to vanish like
a gambler's lucky streak</i>

1185
02:00:00,322 --> 02:00:04,554
<i>When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

1186
02:00:07,363 --> 02:00:10,855
<i>Oh, I love to climb a mountain</i>

1187
02:00:10,933 --> 02:00:14,369
<i>And to reach the highest peak</i>

1188
02:00:14,436 --> 02:00:18,202
<i>But it doesn't thrill me half as much</i>

1189
02:00:18,273 --> 02:00:21,765
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

1190
02:00:25,681 --> 02:00:28,149
Kip, come and dance with us.

1191
02:00:28,217 --> 02:00:30,447
- Later.
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>

1192
02:00:33,288 --> 02:00:37,122
Clap now.

1193
02:00:37,192 --> 02:00:39,387
Yeah.

1194
02:00:55,577 --> 02:00:58,637
<i>Come on, Sarge!
Let's raise that flag!</i>

1195
02:00:58,714 --> 02:01:01,080
Hardy's coming!

1196
02:01:02,217 --> 02:01:04,651
Here comes the bomb squad!

1197
02:01:11,226 --> 02:01:13,353
Hey, where's my helmet?

1198
02:01:13,429 --> 02:01:16,489
Go on,
Sergeant Hardy!

1199
02:01:25,207 --> 02:01:28,005
Bring 'em home!

1200
02:01:28,076 --> 02:01:30,806
Hardy! Hardy! Hardy!

1201
02:01:35,951 --> 02:01:39,819
What was that?

1202
02:01:42,791 --> 02:01:45,225
<i>I'm never going to forgive myself.</i>

1203
02:01:45,294 --> 02:01:47,819
<i>I'm never going to bloody forgive myself.</i>

1204
02:01:51,166 --> 02:01:54,397
Sergeant Hardy, sir.
It was booby-trapped.

1205
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:58,201
They was runnin' up the Union Jack, sir,
up on that statue.

1206
02:01:58,273 --> 02:02:01,504
It just went off, sir.

1207
02:02:01,577 --> 02:02:04,978
Sergeant Hardy climbed up, Sir, 
just for a lark, sir.

1208
02:02:05,047 --> 02:02:07,106
It should've been me.
It was my idea.

1209
02:02:07,182 --> 02:02:10,413
- Sir, you don't wanna look.
- Ooh.

1210
02:02:10,486 --> 02:02:12,511
Who's that girl?

1211
02:02:12,588 --> 02:02:15,386
His fiancee, sir.

1212
02:02:15,457 --> 02:02:19,655
- Hardy's?
- He kept it a bit dark.

1213
02:02:27,769 --> 02:02:29,703
Kip?

1214
02:02:30,772 --> 02:02:33,070
Kip, it's me.

1215
02:02:34,276 --> 02:02:37,211
<i>I'm so sorry about what happened.</i>

1216
02:02:38,547 --> 02:02:41,675
<i>Can I talk to you?
Kip?</i>

1217
02:02:43,452 --> 02:02:46,387
Kip, why won't you talk to me?

1218
02:02:49,591 --> 02:02:51,855
Oh, Kip.

1219
02:02:55,864 --> 02:02:58,298
Oh, let me come in!

1220
02:03:24,626 --> 02:03:27,959
<i>Hana tells me you're leaving.</i>

1221
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:30,464
<i>There's going to be trials.</i>

1222
02:03:30,532 --> 02:03:32,796
<i>They want me to interpret.</i>

1223
02:03:32,868 --> 02:03:35,735
<i>Don't they know 
I'm allergic to courtrooms?</i>

1224
02:03:40,242 --> 02:03:42,176
So...

1225
02:03:43,979 --> 02:03:46,243
I come across the hospital convoy.

1226
02:03:46,315 --> 02:03:49,307
<i>They're looking for this stuff.</i>

1227
02:03:49,384 --> 02:03:51,750
<i>This nurse, Mary,</i>

1228
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:54,254
<i>tells me about you and Hana...</i>

1229
02:03:54,323 --> 02:03:56,757
<i>hiding in some monastery in--</i>

1230
02:03:56,825 --> 02:04:00,056
What do you call it?
Retreat?

1231
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,528
How you came out of the desert...

1232
02:04:02,598 --> 02:04:06,864
and you were burned
and you didn't remember your name,

1233
02:04:06,935 --> 02:04:09,529
but you knew the words
to every song that ever was...

1234
02:04:09,605 --> 02:04:13,507
and you had one possession:
a copy of Herodotus.

1235
02:04:13,575 --> 02:04:16,135
And it was filled...

1236
02:04:16,211 --> 02:04:18,475
with letters and cuttings.

1237
02:04:19,681 --> 02:04:22,115
Then I knew it was you.

1238
02:04:24,753 --> 02:04:27,347
Me?

1239
02:04:37,866 --> 02:04:39,800
I saw you...

1240
02:04:39,868 --> 02:04:44,828
<i>writing in that book
at the embassy in Cairo...</i>

1241
02:04:46,441 --> 02:04:50,400
when I had thumbs and you had a face...

1242
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:52,470
and a name.

1243
02:04:52,547 --> 02:04:54,481
<i>I see.</i>

1244
02:04:55,884 --> 02:04:58,182
Before you went over to the Germans,

1245
02:04:58,253 --> 02:05:02,986
<i>before you found a way to get Rommel's spy 
across the desert and inside British headquarters.</i>

1246
02:05:03,058 --> 02:05:05,356
He took some pretty good photographs.

1247
02:05:05,427 --> 02:05:08,828
I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk.

1248
02:05:08,897 --> 02:05:13,231
So, it made an impression.

1249
02:05:13,301 --> 02:05:17,738
I had to get back to the desert.
I'd made a promise.

1250
02:05:17,806 --> 02:05:19,899
The rest meant nothing to me.

1251
02:05:19,975 --> 02:05:22,466
What did you say?

1252
02:05:22,544 --> 02:05:26,036
That the rest... meant nothing to me.

1253
02:05:26,114 --> 02:05:28,674
There was a result to what you did.

1254
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:32,277
It wasn't just another expedition.
It did this.

1255
02:05:32,354 --> 02:05:35,323
<i>If the British hadn't 
unearthed that photographer,</i>

1256
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:37,483
<i>thousands of people could have died.</i>

1257
02:05:37,559 --> 02:05:41,120
Thousands of people did die.
Just different people.

1258
02:05:41,196 --> 02:05:45,360
- Yes, like Madox.
- What?

1259
02:05:45,434 --> 02:05:48,232
You know he shot himself,
your partner,

1260
02:05:48,303 --> 02:05:50,897
- <i>when he found out you were a spy.</i>
- What?

1261
02:05:53,175 --> 02:05:57,771
Madox thought I was a spy? No.

1262
02:05:57,846 --> 02:06:01,043
<i>No, I was never a spy.</i>

1263
02:06:01,116 --> 02:06:03,676
It's ghastly.
It's like a witch hunt.

1264
02:06:03,752 --> 02:06:06,186
Anybody remotely foreign is suddenly a spy.

1265
02:06:06,254 --> 02:06:08,745
- So watch out.
- Right.

1266
02:06:08,824 --> 02:06:12,157
We didn't care about countries, did we?

1267
02:06:12,227 --> 02:06:15,060
Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans--

1268
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:17,394
None of that mattered, did it?
It was something finer than that.

1269
02:06:17,466 --> 02:06:20,333
Yes, it was.

1270
02:06:21,803 --> 02:06:24,897
I'll leave the plane in Kufra oasis.

1271
02:06:24,973 --> 02:06:27,441
- <i>So, if you need it--</i>
- Right.

1272
02:06:27,509 --> 02:06:30,205
<i>Hard to know how long 
one's talking about.</i>

1273
02:06:30,278 --> 02:06:34,009
We might all be back in a month or two.

1274
02:06:37,319 --> 02:06:39,287
Hmm.

1275
02:06:42,991 --> 02:06:47,587
I have to teach myself 
not to read too much into everything.

1276
02:06:47,662 --> 02:06:51,189
It comes of too long having to read so much 
into hardly anything at all.

1277
02:06:56,738 --> 02:06:59,969
Good-bye, my friend.

1278
02:07:05,447 --> 02:07:07,506
There is no God.

1279
02:07:07,582 --> 02:07:10,881
But I hope someone looks after you.

1280
02:07:12,721 --> 02:07:16,179
In case you're still wondering,

1281
02:07:16,258 --> 02:07:19,284
this is called a suprasternal notch.

1282
02:07:23,198 --> 02:07:26,690
Come and visit us in Dorset
when all this nonsense is over.

1283
02:07:32,641 --> 02:07:34,836
You'll never come to Dorset.

1284
02:07:44,452 --> 02:07:48,218
<i>So, you didn't know Madox shot himself.</i>

1285
02:07:51,393 --> 02:07:53,327
No.

1286
02:07:53,395 --> 02:07:56,091
And you didn't kill the Cliftons?

1287
02:08:04,039 --> 02:08:06,007
Sh--

1288
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:14,214
She--

1289
02:08:17,352 --> 02:08:20,219
She die--

1290
02:08:20,288 --> 02:08:22,279
She--
I can't.

1291
02:08:26,294 --> 02:08:28,228
Well...

1292
02:08:29,431 --> 02:08:32,025
maybe I did.

1293
02:08:36,137 --> 02:08:38,901
Maybe I did.

1294
02:08:45,347 --> 02:08:48,145
<i>I was packing up our base camp...</i>

1295
02:08:48,216 --> 02:08:50,946
<i>at the Cave of Swimmers.</i>

1296
02:08:51,019 --> 02:08:55,683
<i>Clifton had offered to fly down
from Cairo to collect me.</i>

1297
02:08:55,757 --> 02:08:58,783
<i>He flew like a madman always,</i>

1298
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:01,420
<i>so I-- I took no notice.</i>

1299
02:09:10,038 --> 02:09:11,096
Aaah!

1300
02:09:35,964 --> 02:09:39,991
Katharine?

1301
02:09:40,068 --> 02:09:43,902
Dear God, Katharine,
what are you doing here?

1302
02:09:43,972 --> 02:09:47,408
I can't get out.
I can't move.

1303
02:09:50,946 --> 02:09:53,414
"Surprise", he said.

1304
02:09:54,816 --> 02:09:57,478
Poor Geoffrey.

1305
02:09:57,552 --> 02:10:02,285
He knew. 
He must've known all the time.

1306
02:10:02,357 --> 02:10:05,793
He was shouting, "I love you, Katharine.
I love you so much."

1307
02:10:08,263 --> 02:10:10,697
Is he badly hurt?

1308
02:10:12,334 --> 02:10:14,461
I have to get you out.

1309
02:10:14,536 --> 02:10:16,970
- Please don't move me.
- I have to get you out.

1310
02:10:17,038 --> 02:10:20,804
- It hurts too much.
- I know, darling, I know. I'm sorry.

1311
02:10:20,875 --> 02:10:22,809
Come on.

1312
02:10:24,079 --> 02:10:26,411
Now!

1313
02:10:44,566 --> 02:10:46,898
Why did you hate me?

1314
02:10:46,968 --> 02:10:48,902
What?

1315
02:10:51,406 --> 02:10:54,034
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

1316
02:10:54,109 --> 02:10:57,601
Shh.
Don't talk.

1317
02:10:57,679 --> 02:10:59,977
You speak so many bloody languages...

1318
02:11:00,048 --> 02:11:02,482
and you never want to talk.

1319
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:11,889
- <i>You're wearing the thimble.</i>
- Of course.

1320
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:14,520
You idiot.

1321
02:11:14,596 --> 02:11:18,259
I always wear it.
I've always worn it.

1322
02:11:18,333 --> 02:11:20,767
I've always loved you.

1323
02:11:56,504 --> 02:11:58,495
It's so cold.

1324
02:11:58,573 --> 02:12:01,098
I know.
I'm sorry.

1325
02:12:03,378 --> 02:12:05,812
I'll make a fire.

1326
02:12:10,018 --> 02:12:12,885
<i>Did you get Geoffrey out of the plane?</i>

1327
02:12:12,954 --> 02:12:15,855
- Yes, I did.
- <i>Good. That's good. Thank you.</i>

1328
02:12:20,695 --> 02:12:22,959
Listen to me, Katharine.

1329
02:12:23,031 --> 02:12:25,522
You've broken your ankle...

1330
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:28,125
and I'm going to have to try and bind it.

1331
02:12:28,203 --> 02:12:30,763
I think you've also broken your wrist...

1332
02:12:30,839 --> 02:12:34,434
and maybe some ribs, which is why
it's hurting you to breathe.

1333
02:12:34,509 --> 02:12:37,103
<i>I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.</i>

1334
02:12:37,178 --> 02:12:41,012
Although, given all the traffic
in the desert these days,

1335
02:12:41,082 --> 02:12:44,711
I'm bound to bump 
into one army or another.

1336
02:12:44,786 --> 02:12:48,222
<i>And then I'll come back
and you'll be fine.</i>

1337
02:12:48,289 --> 02:12:50,348
You promise?

1338
02:12:50,425 --> 02:12:53,519
<i>I wouldn't want to die here.</i>

1339
02:12:54,696 --> 02:12:57,164
I don't want to die in the desert.

1340
02:13:00,902 --> 02:13:03,837
I've always had a rather 
elaborate funeral in mind.

1341
02:13:05,807 --> 02:13:08,173
<i>Particular hymns.</i>

1342
02:13:08,243 --> 02:13:11,178
And I know exactly
where I want to be buried.

1343
02:13:12,647 --> 02:13:16,344
In our garden, where I grew up...

1344
02:13:16,417 --> 02:13:19,477
with a view of the sea.

1345
02:13:19,554 --> 02:13:22,352
So promise me you'll come back for me.

1346
02:13:22,423 --> 02:13:25,051
I promise...

1347
02:13:25,126 --> 02:13:27,390
I'll come back for you.

1348
02:13:28,796 --> 02:13:31,663
I promise...

1349
02:13:31,733 --> 02:13:35,032
I'll never leave you.

1350
02:13:38,606 --> 02:13:41,097
You have plenty of water...

1351
02:13:41,176 --> 02:13:43,337
and, um, food.

1352
02:13:43,411 --> 02:13:47,006
I'll open them for you.

1353
02:13:51,819 --> 02:13:53,844
A good read.

1354
02:13:57,525 --> 02:13:59,550
Don't waste this.

1355
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:05,632
Will you bury Geoffrey?

1356
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:12,598
I know he's dead.

1357
02:14:15,176 --> 02:14:17,440
I'm sorry, Katharine.

1358
02:14:19,447 --> 02:14:21,381
I know.

1359
02:14:28,556 --> 02:14:31,821
Every night...

1360
02:14:31,893 --> 02:14:34,259
I cut out my heart.

1361
02:14:38,766 --> 02:14:41,064
But in the morning it was full again.

1362
02:14:48,743 --> 02:14:50,677
Darling.

1363
02:14:52,313 --> 02:14:54,304
My darling.

1364
02:15:21,376 --> 02:15:24,607
<i>You'd better be ready
about half past 8:00</i>

1365
02:15:24,679 --> 02:15:26,943
<i>Now, honey
Don't you be late</i>

1366
02:15:27,015 --> 02:15:29,916
<i>I'm going to be there
when the band starts playing</i>

1367
02:15:29,984 --> 02:15:32,077
<i>Remember
When we get there, honey</i>

1368
02:15:32,153 --> 02:15:34,781
<i>An invitation to the strutter's ball</i>

1369
02:15:34,856 --> 02:15:36,983
<i>A very swell affair</i>

1370
02:15:37,058 --> 02:15:39,492
<i>All the highbrows will be there</i>

1371
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:43,223
<i>I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey</i>

1372
02:15:43,298 --> 02:15:47,462
<i>I stopped at noon and at twilight.</i>

1373
02:15:47,535 --> 02:15:51,995
<i>Three days there on foot,
I told her,</i>

1374
02:15:52,073 --> 02:15:56,009
<i>and three hours back by car.</i>

1375
02:15:58,079 --> 02:16:00,707
<i>Don't go anywhere.</i>

1376
02:16:01,716 --> 02:16:03,650
<i>I'll be back.</i>

1377
02:16:06,621 --> 02:16:08,885
<i>I'll be back.</i>

1378
02:16:25,707 --> 02:16:28,005
Just walked in from the desert, sir.

1379
02:16:29,243 --> 02:16:31,643
<i>Morning.</i>

1380
02:16:44,392 --> 02:16:47,452
Dear golly, 
where have you come from then?

1381
02:16:48,529 --> 02:16:50,895
There's been an accident.

1382
02:16:50,965 --> 02:16:53,525
I need a doctor...

1383
02:16:53,601 --> 02:16:56,934
to come with me,
and I need to borrow this car.

1384
02:16:57,004 --> 02:16:58,938
I'll pay, of course.

1385
02:16:59,006 --> 02:17:02,908
- And I need-- I need morphine.
- May I see your papers, sir?

1386
02:17:02,977 --> 02:17:05,172
What?

1387
02:17:05,246 --> 02:17:08,579
If I could just see
some form of identification.

1388
02:17:08,649 --> 02:17:12,141
I'm sorry, I'm not making sense.
Forgive me, I-- I'm not--

1389
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:14,711
I've been walking and--

1390
02:17:14,789 --> 02:17:19,658
A woman is badly injured at the Gilf Kabir, 
the Cave of Swimmers.

1391
02:17:19,727 --> 02:17:22,423
<i>I'm a member of the 
Royal Geographical Society.</i>

1392
02:17:22,497 --> 02:17:25,159
Right.

1393
02:17:25,233 --> 02:17:28,669
Now, if I could... 
just take your name.

1394
02:17:31,672 --> 02:17:36,336
Count Laszlo de Almasy.

1395
02:17:38,579 --> 02:17:42,640
"Almasy." 
Would you mind spelling that for me?

1396
02:17:42,717 --> 02:17:45,914
- Look, listen to me, will you?
- What nationality would that be?

1397
02:17:45,987 --> 02:17:50,185
A woman is dying.
My wife is dying.

1398
02:17:50,258 --> 02:17:54,456
I have been... walking--

1399
02:17:55,830 --> 02:17:58,424
<i>I have been walking for three days.</i>

1400
02:17:58,499 --> 02:18:00,967
I do not want to spell my name.

1401
02:18:01,035 --> 02:18:04,266
- I want you to give me this car.
- I understand you're agitated.

1402
02:18:04,338 --> 02:18:07,501
Perhaps if you'd like to sit down,
I can radio back to H.Q.

1403
02:18:07,575 --> 02:18:12,535
No. No, don't--
Don't radio anybody!

1404
02:18:12,613 --> 02:18:15,844
Just give me the fucking car!

1405
02:19:15,810 --> 02:19:20,008
Stop the car, please.
A woman is dying!

1406
02:19:20,081 --> 02:19:22,606
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen
to another word from you,

1407
02:19:22,683 --> 02:19:24,708
I'm going to give you
a fucking good hiding!

1408
02:19:24,785 --> 02:19:27,379
Fritz? 
What are you talking about, Fritz?

1409
02:19:27,455 --> 02:19:28,888
Well, that's your name, isn't it?

1410
02:19:28,956 --> 02:19:30,947
Count Fuckin' Asshole Von Bismarck!

1411
02:19:31,025 --> 02:19:33,755
- What's that supposed to be, Irish?
- Please!

1412
02:19:33,828 --> 02:19:37,764
You have to listen!
Katharine!

1413
02:19:37,832 --> 02:19:40,562
<i>Katharine!</i>

1414
02:19:52,313 --> 02:19:54,611
Excuse me.

1415
02:19:54,682 --> 02:19:58,618
- I also need to use the lavatory.
- You'll have to wait.

1416
02:19:58,686 --> 02:20:02,486
- It's urgent.
- Sarge!

1417
02:20:02,557 --> 02:20:05,720
Sarge, Jerry wants to use the lav.

1418
02:20:05,793 --> 02:20:08,125
Says it's urgent.

1419
02:20:10,197 --> 02:20:13,633
- Where are we going, please?
- Oh, up north to the coast.

1420
02:20:13,701 --> 02:20:16,169
Benghazi.
Soon be there.

1421
02:20:16,237 --> 02:20:18,262
<i>You can get your boat back home then.</i>

1422
02:20:18,339 --> 02:20:22,799
All right, go on then.
Here, you take him.

1423
02:20:22,877 --> 02:20:26,278
I've been up and down
this bloody train all day.

1424
02:20:41,495 --> 02:20:43,588
It doesn't open.

1425
02:20:57,178 --> 02:21:00,545
Aaah!

1426
02:21:53,534 --> 02:21:55,661
<i>So yes,</i>

1427
02:21:57,171 --> 02:22:00,265
she died because of me.

1428
02:22:03,077 --> 02:22:05,341
Because I loved her.

1429
02:22:08,949 --> 02:22:11,213
Because I--

1430
02:22:14,321 --> 02:22:16,915
Because I had the wrong name.

1431
02:22:26,867 --> 02:22:31,201
- And you never got back to the cave?
- <i>I did get back.</i>

1432
02:22:31,272 --> 02:22:34,139
I kept my promise.

1433
02:22:35,342 --> 02:22:38,641
<i>I was assisted by the Germans.</i>

1434
02:22:38,713 --> 02:22:41,079
<i>There was a-- a trade.</i>

1435
02:22:41,148 --> 02:22:44,549
<i>I had our expedition maps.</i>

1436
02:22:44,618 --> 02:22:47,712
<i>And after the British made me their enemy,</i>

1437
02:22:47,788 --> 02:22:51,690
<i>I gave their enemy our maps.</i>

1438
02:23:04,105 --> 02:23:06,733
<i>So I got back to the desert...</i>

1439
02:23:06,807 --> 02:23:09,275
<i>and to Katharine...</i>

1440
02:23:09,343 --> 02:23:11,641
<i>in Madox's English plane...</i>

1441
02:23:11,712 --> 02:23:14,112
<i>with German gasoline.</i>

1442
02:23:18,619 --> 02:23:21,281
When I arrived in Italy,

1443
02:23:21,355 --> 02:23:24,051
on my medical chart they wrote,

1444
02:23:24,125 --> 02:23:26,923
"English Patient."

1445
02:23:26,994 --> 02:23:29,690
Isn't that funny?

1446
02:23:29,764 --> 02:23:33,165
After all that, I became English.

1447
02:23:36,637 --> 02:23:40,664
You get to the morning 
and the poison leaks away, doesn't it?

1448
02:23:44,245 --> 02:23:46,509
Black nights.

1449
02:23:50,584 --> 02:23:53,849
- I thought I would kill you.
- You can't kill me.

1450
02:23:55,222 --> 02:23:57,486
I died years ago.

1451
02:24:01,462 --> 02:24:04,124
No, I can't kill you now.

1452
02:24:23,284 --> 02:24:26,412
We've been posted.
North of Florence.

1453
02:24:32,393 --> 02:24:36,329
I was thinking yesterday--

1454
02:24:36,397 --> 02:24:38,922
yesterday--

1455
02:24:38,999 --> 02:24:41,467
The patient and Hardy.

1456
02:24:41,535 --> 02:24:43,867
They're everything
that's good about England.

1457
02:24:45,039 --> 02:24:47,507
I couldn't even say what that was.

1458
02:24:49,410 --> 02:24:53,506
We didn't exchange two personal words,

1459
02:24:53,581 --> 02:24:56,243
and we've been together
through some terrible things.

1460
02:24:56,317 --> 02:24:58,683
<i>Some terrible things.</i>

1461
02:24:58,752 --> 02:25:02,882
He was engaged to a girl in the village.

1462
02:25:02,957 --> 02:25:05,551
I mean--

1463
02:25:05,626 --> 02:25:09,790
And us, he never once--

1464
02:25:09,864 --> 02:25:15,268
He didn't ask me if I could spin
the ball at cricket or Kamasutra or--

1465
02:25:28,616 --> 02:25:31,244
I don't even know
what I'm talking about.

1466
02:25:31,318 --> 02:25:34,253
You loved him.

1467
02:26:58,005 --> 02:26:59,973
Katharine.

1468
02:27:13,487 --> 02:27:16,115
I'm still here.

1469
02:27:17,558 --> 02:27:20,186
You'd better be.

1470
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:23,058
Don't depend on it, will you?

1471
02:27:24,365 --> 02:27:27,732
That little bit of air in my lungs,

1472
02:27:27,801 --> 02:27:31,498
each day it gets less and less.

1473
02:27:32,973 --> 02:27:35,305
Which is all right.

1474
02:27:35,376 --> 02:27:37,810
It's quite all right.

1475
02:27:39,913 --> 02:27:43,280
I've been speaking to Caravaggio,

1476
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:46,285
my research assistant.

1477
02:27:46,353 --> 02:27:49,880
He tells me there's a ghost in the cloisters.

1478
02:27:51,258 --> 02:27:53,783
I can join him.

1479
02:27:55,929 --> 02:27:58,659
- <i>Hana!</i>
- It's the boy.

1480
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:25,324
I'll always go back to that church.

1481
02:28:26,326 --> 02:28:28,954
Look at my paintings.

1482
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,400
I'll always go back to that church.

1483
02:28:37,438 --> 02:28:40,771
So one day we'll meet.

1484
02:30:30,450 --> 02:30:32,384
Thank you.

1485
02:30:44,264 --> 02:30:46,528
Read to me, will you?

1486
02:30:52,406 --> 02:30:54,840
<i>Read me to sleep.</i>

1487
02:31:17,864 --> 02:31:20,526
<i>"My darling,</i>

1488
02:31:20,601 --> 02:31:23,365
<i>"I'm waiting for you.</i>

1489
02:31:23,437 --> 02:31:26,736
<i>"How long is a day in the dark?</i>

1490
02:31:26,807 --> 02:31:29,071
"Or a week?

1491
02:31:37,517 --> 02:31:39,917
"The fire is gone now...

1492
02:31:39,987 --> 02:31:42,979
and I'm horr-- horribly cold."

1493
02:31:44,858 --> 02:31:47,622
<i>I really ought to drag myself outside,</i>

1494
02:31:47,694 --> 02:31:50,356
<i>but then there'd be the sun.</i>

1495
02:31:50,430 --> 02:31:52,694
<i>I'm afraid I waste the light...</i>

1496
02:31:52,766 --> 02:31:56,031
<i>on the paintings
and on writing these words.</i>

1497
02:31:59,306 --> 02:32:01,206
<i>We die.</i>

1498
02:32:01,275 --> 02:32:03,436
"We die.

1499
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:07,310
"We die rich with lovers and tribes,

1500
02:32:07,381 --> 02:32:10,646
"tastes we have swallowed,

1501
02:32:10,717 --> 02:32:13,584
"bodies we have entered...

1502
02:32:13,654 --> 02:32:15,884
and swum up like rivers."

1503
02:32:15,956 --> 02:32:19,323
<i>Fears we've hidden in,</i>

1504
02:32:19,393 --> 02:32:21,657
<i>like this wretched cave.</i>

1505
02:32:27,634 --> 02:32:30,228
<i>I want all this marked on my body.</i>

1506
02:32:32,572 --> 02:32:35,541
<i>We're the real countries.</i>

1507
02:32:35,609 --> 02:32:38,134
<i>Not the boundaries drawn on maps,</i>

1508
02:32:38,211 --> 02:32:40,805
<i>the names of powerful men.</i>

1509
02:32:51,658 --> 02:32:55,594
<i>I know you'll come and carry me out 
into the palace of winds.</i>

1510
02:33:03,503 --> 02:33:06,472
<i>That's all I've wanted,</i>

1511
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:10,476
<i>to walk in such a place with you,</i>

1512
02:33:10,544 --> 02:33:13,445
<i>with friends.</i>

1513
02:33:13,513 --> 02:33:15,947
<i>An Earth without maps.</i>

1514
02:33:21,321 --> 02:33:24,085
"The lamp's gone out,

1515
02:33:24,157 --> 02:33:27,593
"and I'm writing...

1516
02:33:27,661 --> 02:33:29,925
in the darkness."

1517
02:34:32,692 --> 02:34:35,354
<i>Hana?</i>

1518
02:34:35,429 --> 02:34:37,863
<i>Hana, come on!</i>

1519
02:34:39,599 --> 02:34:41,931
<i>Hana...</i>

1520
02:34:43,537 --> 02:34:45,471
this is Gioia.

1521
02:34:45,539 --> 02:34:48,508
- <i>Buon giorno.</i>
- <i>Buon giorno.</i>

1522
02:34:48,575 --> 02:34:50,566
She'll take you as far as Florence.

1523
02:34:50,644 --> 02:34:52,908
I can get in back.
