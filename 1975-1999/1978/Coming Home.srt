1
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,824
- Yeah!
- Baby.

2
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,412
- You ain't caught nothin'.
- You'll have to move out of the way.

3
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,291
We don't want no cheap seaters
around the table.

4
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,960
If Kenny's moving, you've got to move.

5
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,296
All right.

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,132
Would you go if you had the chance again?

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,260
- Would I go? Yeah!
- I'd go to Sweden.

8
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,470
No, not to Canada.

9
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,555
- Would you go back to 'nam again?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,806
You would?

11
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,600
- You're a fuckin' psycho.
- No.

12
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,269
- You'd go back? You'd go back?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,190
- I went over there for a purpose, man.
- What was your purpose?

14
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,443
A lot of it was curiosity,
but another thing is...

15
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,196
Now you can't be curious, man.
I mean, you were there.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,282
I said that was part of the reason.
Only part of it, man.

17
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,494
The other was a moral obligation.
Man, I feel that anybody...

18
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:23,499
Not for the country or anything like that,
for anybody.

19
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,169
Nobody's got the right
to tell anybody what to do...

20
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,630
Against their will if
they don't believe it.

21
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,840
That's what I went over there to fight for.

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,676
Do you know that they ran the French out
after 20 years?

23
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,137
Wait a minute, man!

24
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,934
You said that they're forced...
Shit, you call the draft not being forced?

25
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:46,021
I ain't saying the draft, our country.
I'm talking about another country...

26
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,690
That's having something
forced upon them.

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,485
It's our obligation
to go fight for somebody else?

28
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,822
I feel if you believe in it.
If you believe in it.

29
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:59,576
I can't see anybody saying
that after going and coming back...

30
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,622
To say that they would go again.
I just can't deal with that.

31
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:08,377
The reason I can see it is that some of us,
not all of us...

32
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,382
Some of us need to justify to ourselves
what the fuck we did there.

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,009
So if we come back to say
what we did was a waste...

34
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,096
What happened to us was a waste,
we can't live with it.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,432
- So they'd do it again.
- So they say...

36
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,561
Inside themselves,
they're lying to themselves continuously...

37
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:30,065
Saying, "what I did was okay,
because this is what I got from it, man.

38
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,902
"I have to justify being paralyzed.
I have to justify killing people.

39
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,863
"So I say it was okay."

40
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,784
But how many guys can make the reality,
and say, "what I did was wrong...

41
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:45,080
"...and all this other shit was wrong," and
still be able to live with themselves...

42
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,167
Because they're crippled
for the rest of their fuckin' life?

43
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,404
Re-box all weapons.

44
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,658
Place your weapons on the firing line
with the dust covers up.

45
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,702
Grease up the brass.

46
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,748
Word is it's turned into
a hell of a war over there, captain.

47
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,666
We're going there, pal.

48
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,003
We're in 'nam, combat city.

49
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,173
I am ready, really ready.

50
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,136
I'll pop some rounds with you, captain.
Marine!

51
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,848
How's vi taking to your leaving?

52
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,434
Sometimes I think she hates
everything military...

53
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,436
But she stands behind me.

54
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,688
She knows I want it
more than anything else.

55
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,108
- How about Sally?
- She's okay.

56
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,821
I don't think she really understands
it all, but she accepts it.

57
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,659
You can't ask for a hell of a lot more
than that, now, can you?

58
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,331
American spokesman
reported a barrage of rockets...

59
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,042
Artillery, and mortar fire hitting...

60
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,503
Remember Jim hanson?

61
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,007
He got blown away in the middle
of the street, right in Saigon.

62
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,887
That's an embarrassment, you know that?
Makes us look like the goddamn "b" team.

63
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,099
Word is from on top
that Charlie shot his wad...

64
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,186
With this tet offensive,
and it's just a matter of a mop-up time.

65
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,190
I'll tell you, Earl, I've waited a long
time for an opportunity like this.

66
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,693
- You're going to make major.
- Yeah?

67
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,737
- Major?
- Major.

68
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,865
Major and Mrs. Robert Hyde?

69
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,743
I'll have to get my skirts lengthened
for that one.

70
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,871
Start wearing girdles.

71
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,083
- You'll have to watch your language.
- Right. Very reserved.

72
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,755
I'll tell you something.
I'm actually excited!

73
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:50,385
And I never thought it would get like this.
I have competitive nervousness.

74
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,930
I feel like I'm off to the olympic games,
representing the us.

75
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,348
Bob is very sexy.

76
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,643
In 13 months, I'm gonna throw you
the damnedest party you ever saw.

77
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,105
A side of beef, a case of Jack Daniels...

78
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,357
And maybe even
a couple of congressmen.

79
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,443
- How do you like that?
- Fantastic.

80
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,571
In the meantime,
I'll bring you back a souvenir.

81
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,741
- Like what?
- A commie ak-47.

82
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,161
Robert? I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

83
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,414
I wanted to pass along
the colonel's best wishes.

84
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,585
- Isn't he gonna be able to come by later?
- No. Tonight's his chess night.

85
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,589
Now, Sally, you be sure and keep in touch.
Let us know where you are.

86
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,299
I will, Mrs. vickery.

87
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,843
- She'll be staying with my mom.
- How nice.

88
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,430
Earl, your Kathy's doing
a wonderful job on the paper.

89
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,682
Don't let that go to your head, young lady.

90
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,185
I've got a lot of ideas
I want to call you about.

91
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,270
Call me tomorrow.

92
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,108
- May God be with you, Robert.
- Thank you, Mrs. vickery.

93
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,697
That was very nice.

94
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,967
Now hear this.

95
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,807
It is exactly zero hour minus six.

96
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,644
Your orders for the day are...

97
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,608
Go directly to the bedroom.

98
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,488
Do not pass go.

99
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,490
Do not...

100
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,785
Collect dinner.

101
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,663
Aren't you hungry?

102
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,126
Does a bear make big potty in the woods?

103
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,214
"From the halls of montezuma

104
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,009
"to the shores of tripoli

105
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,306
"I will fight

106
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,269
"my country's battles

107
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,523
"on land

108
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,818
"and in the air"

109
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,341
Bob?

110
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,472
What are you doing?

111
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,975
This darn thing wouldn't pop up.

112
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,772
You never know
when you're going to want some toast.

113
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,702
I got to start getting ready.

114
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,456
You don't need to be afraid for me,
you know.

115
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,585
I am afraid.

116
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,090
But I'm proud of you.

117
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,677
There's nothing I could do
here in California.

118
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,887
I know.

119
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,100
And that's where I belong.

120
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,602
I am a marine.

121
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,438
Left, right, and a left.

122
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,315
I got to go.

123
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,275
Pay the bar bill.

124
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,238
Once and for all, let's get the
generator in this thing fixed.

125
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,366
You can call my mom
and let her know when you're coming.

126
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,868
I bought you a present, sweetheart.

127
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,413
I don't have anything for you.

128
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,921
Sally!

129
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,298
It's a little wedding ring.

130
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,095
Look how outstanding that is.

131
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,724
- I like it.
- Yeah.

132
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,146
- You'll take it off when you go on liberty.
- No way!

133
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,817
I'll never take this off. That's a promise.

134
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,779
This will be my good luck charm.

135
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,823
That's right.

136
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,702
Sir, we're ready to move out.
Can I stow your gear?

137
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,830
- We're war.
- Yo.

138
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,002
Let's go.

139
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,797
When I get back...

140
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,009
We'll get a little condominium
right on the beach.

141
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,344
Tell brother Billy to take care.

142
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,764
And a garage filled up with a Porsche.

143
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,682
Be a good girl. No foolin' around.

144
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,017
Just come back.

145
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,852
You got it.

146
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,063
This is dink. My wife Sally.

147
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,276
Hi, Mrs. Hyde. Vi, capt. Hyde's wife.

148
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,028
- Hi, vi.
- Hi.

149
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,698
Be careful.

150
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,994
- You've got a spot on your tie.
- What are you talking about?

151
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,884
Don't wear your skirts so short.

152
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,621
See you around.

153
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,052
- Vi?
- Yeah?

154
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,430
Do you want a drink? I mean,
could I buy you a drink or something?

155
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,599
Where's open? No place is open.

156
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,476
There's the officers club.

157
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,978
Anyplace but there.

158
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,275
Yeah, I guess.

159
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,280
That's that.

160
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,167
I live just a couple of Miles down.
Want to come over?

161
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,961
- Yeah.
- Stay close.

162
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,596
Park in there. It's empty.

163
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,723
Okay.

164
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,817
Don't mind the mess.

165
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,153
Come on up.

166
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,666
Don't turn it off.

167
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,983
Okay?

168
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,195
Yeah, I'm sorry.

169
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,074
Just tonight, especially,
I sort of felt superstitious.

170
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,660
Whatever gets you through the night.

171
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,913
- Guess it was the way I was brought up.
- Me, too.

172
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,707
- Is a beer okay? That's all I got.
- Sure.

173
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,551
You going to stay on in officers quarters?

174
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,887
Are you kidding?

175
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,390
- I couldn't, even if I wanted to.
- That's spooky.

176
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,767
Bob moves off,
and I gotta move off the base.

177
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,771
You're the hole in the doughnut, and when
the doughnut goes, there's no hole.

178
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,691
They say, "if the marine corps
wanted you to have a wife...

179
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,859
"...they'd have issued you one."

180
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,903
Is that you?

181
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,822
Me and my kid brother.

182
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,240
He's cute.

183
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:36,411
He inherited the brains, the beauty,
the personality, the talent.

184
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,454
Then he got drafted.

185
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,082
He's the main reason I hang out here.

186
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,084
Not dink? Dink the kink?

187
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,170
He's part of it.

188
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,091
But the kid's in the va hospital,
psycho ward.

189
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:54,470
They sent him home without an ignition,
so I'm stuck with him.

190
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,515
God.

191
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,227
- Must be really hard on you.
- I see him every day.

192
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,896
I work in the hospital, in the kitchen.

193
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,566
Is he going to get better?

194
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,235
Who knows? They don't.

195
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,487
I don't.

196
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,213
- Pee wee.
- How you doing, Mr. Martin?

197
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,176
I'm just fine, pee wee. Just terrific.
I only stink a little bit.

198
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,137
- Smells like booze to me.
- I need a bath, man.

199
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,599
I just have two hands,
and too many assholes to clean.

200
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,976
That's what you're being
paid for, isn't it?

201
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,063
Mr. Martin, you get more from Uncle
for your disability...

202
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,648
Than me and my old lady get
put together.

203
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,526
Maybe they shouldn't
put you together then.

204
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,071
Guy, your radiator's blowing over.

205
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,740
- Yeah? So's yours.
- Guy, I'm serious, man.

206
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,785
You better watch it
before you pop your melon.

207
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,329
Shit. I'm filled up.

208
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,997
Where's corrine?

209
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,090
You'd better watch that booze.
Mess up your kidneys.

210
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,526
Look, watch where you're... goddamn it!

211
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,403
Shit.

212
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,905
My God!

213
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,493
Would you please give me my canes?

214
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,453
I'm sorry.

215
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,789
Goddamn it!

216
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,709
Nurses, interns and orderlies!

217
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,505
Fucking nurses and fucking doctors!

218
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,218
You treat us like nobodies
in this fucking hospital!

219
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,929
Goddamn it, where are you people?

220
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,599
- Give them hell, Luke.
- Corrine, you're fucking late!

221
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,144
There's something on the floor for you.

222
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,895
You stay where you are, digroot.

223
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,983
You come near me,
I'll break your fucking head.

224
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,568
You understand?

225
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,405
Where the fuck were you?
You're so goddamn slow. Can't you move?

226
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,198
Come near me. I want to hit ya!

227
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,201
I want to hit something
that can't even fucking move!

228
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,911
What am I saying?

229
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,706
What am I doing?

230
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,420
- Having a little problem today, Luke?
- Shit!

231
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,423
Doctor, for Christ's sake,
I can't get my piss bag changed.

232
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,592
You want me out of this fucking hospital?

233
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,844
Give him 50 of thorazine.
Put him in a room.

234
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,222
Take care of me!
I'll get the fuck out of here.

235
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,433
Just take care of me!

236
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,936
Fucking hospital!

237
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,647
Shit!

238
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,711
- Are you fleta Wilson?
- Yes.

239
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,005
I think I'd like to volunteer.

240
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,134
I mean, I don't think.
I do want to volunteer.

241
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,472
Damn! Sit down, please.
I'll be with you in a moment.

242
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,104
Hot stuff.

243
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,663
Do you have him, Jerry?

244
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,499
- Are you ready?
- Okay. One, two, three.

245
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,467
Yeah, I know what you mean,
but you'll get used to it.

246
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,263
One guy had "born to lose"
tattooed on his arm.

247
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,600
"LA vida loca. " The crazy life.
That's my favorite one.

248
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,478
I talked to a guy
who had a gold earring in his ear.

249
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,521
Yeah?

250
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,274
Not used to those hippie types?

251
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,319
Bob would flip out
if he ever saw those characters.

252
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,864
That about does it.

253
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,452
I feel like I've lived in base houses
all my life.

254
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:36,460
Should have had the government move us.
They do that for officers.

255
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,878
- Yeah?
- Yep.

256
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,841
I didn't realize that we'd accumulated
so much stuff.

257
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,177
Don't worry. My rates are cheap.

258
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,892
You know, I think I must have moved
at least 15 times since I left home.

259
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,313
I went back once when my old lady died.

260
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,691
Nothing's left, man.

261
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,319
They tore down my past
and built a shopping center.

262
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,572
- Want to see something funny?
- I'd love to.

263
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,407
My yearbook.

264
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,996
Look at that dress.

265
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,248
- It was a nice dress.
- It's cute.

266
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,750
There's another one here.

267
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,336
It's so funny looking at the way
we used to look.

268
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,421
Doggie in the window?

269
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,589
Look.

270
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,635
"Sally bender. Nickname: Sal.

271
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,515
"What is the one thing she'd want
on a desert island?

272
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,934
"A husband."

273
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,229
- I was so ambitious.
- And so original.

274
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,649
Know that guy we were just talking about?

275
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,069
- He's in here somewhere.
- Yeah?

276
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,654
Look. "Luke Martin.

277
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,449
- "Nickname: The Duke."
- He's cute.

278
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,826
"Co-captain of the football team.

279
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,621
"What one thing would he want
on a desert island?

280
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,289
"A mirror."

281
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,919
- This is asinine, pee wee.
- Here. Take some.

282
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,589
Don't you get the feeling
that this is kind of silly shit?

283
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,352
Shit. I'm not saying, man,
this isn't entertaining, pee wee.

284
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,898
I'm not eating, pee wee.

285
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,987
I'm not eating, pee wee. Come on, man.

286
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,324
- Give me my arms. I can feed myself.
- Try a little milk.

287
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,203
- This is bullshit. I'm not a child, man.
- Try a little milk.

288
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,887
- Hello.
- Hello.

289
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,605
Juice and coffee!

290
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,525
Want some juice?

291
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,698
Excuse me,
do you want some juice or coffee?

292
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,035
Look at that brown-eyed chick, gang.

293
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,329
Come on, baby, light my fire.

294
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,666
Want to boom-boom?

295
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,043
- Short term?
- Like some juice?

296
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,130
I'm hard all over, sweet ass.
I'm a bargain in this ward.

297
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,590
Man, be cool. I told you.

298
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,884
We're playing cards. Get yourself together.

299
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,051
Want some juice?

300
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,555
Tits. Ass. You got it all, mama-San.

301
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,849
- Lay off, man.
- You have got it all.

302
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,727
- You shut up.
- Yes, sir, right away, sir.

303
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,230
You hear that, dummy?
You're disturbing these gentlemen.

304
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,691
- God!
- Can I kiss you? Can I sniff?

305
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,906
Luke?

306
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,826
Can I come in?

307
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,207
How you doing?

308
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,548
Do you remember me?

309
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,091
No.

310
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,136
I was at Lincoln high when you were there.

311
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:19,099
Sally Hyde.
I was Sally bender when I was there.

312
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,436
So?

313
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,111
- I just started volunteering today here.
- Terrific.

314
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,281
If I could get my hands loose,
I'd salute you.

315
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,956
You're a mess.

316
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,545
- Sally bender.
- Right.

317
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,842
- You were a cheerleader.
- That's right. Three years.

318
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,309
Were you wounded in 'nam?

319
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,644
Right.

320
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,646
When did it happen?

321
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,067
A long time ago.

322
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,865
- My husband just went over there.
- Poor bastard!

323
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,298
Sally?

324
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,552
Didn't we used to call you "bend 'er over"?

325
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,347
What? Who said that?

326
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,767
- "Bend 'er over." Everybody said it.
- They did not.

327
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,729
- Yes, they did, Sally.
- Come on! They did not.

328
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,648
What are you talking about?

329
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,191
Shit.

330
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,986
Sally, listen, can I ask
you for a big favor?

331
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,946
Sure.

332
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,741
Sure. How about...

333
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,036
How about unhitching me
from these things?

334
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,706
- No, I can't do that, Luke.
- Sure you can, Sally. It's easy.

335
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,584
No, I'm sorry. The doctor has to do that.

336
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,545
Come on. Please?

337
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,422
Please, Sally bender?

338
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,721
- Come on, just a little.
- What are you doing in here?

339
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,849
- I just was seeing if...
- We'll tend to Mr. Martin, Sally.

340
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,143
- You're needed on the ward.
- Okay.

341
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,563
Bender.

342
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,608
You almost got yourself a gold star.

343
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,285
Pee wee, I can crawl again.

344
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,753
'Morning.

345
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,760
I'm going to be feeding you this morning.
I'm a new volunteer here.

346
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,812
He ain't transistorized, honey.
You got to plug him in for sound.

347
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,856
Plug you in?

348
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,824
Is this going to hurt?

349
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,287
There. Is that okay?

350
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,000
- Thank you.
- Okay. Feel like some food?

351
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,712
Okay. There you go.

352
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,132
- God, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

353
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,551
You want me to... here.

354
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,761
Here. There you go.

355
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,392
It's all energy. You understand?

356
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,853
- You don't understand, do you?
- Sure.

357
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,647
You give out energy, you get it back.
See me smiling?

358
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,692
Take a look at that smile.
You dig them pearly whites?

359
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,861
Now, I smile my ass off now.

360
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:03,490
Hell, I mean, sometimes
I think I'm the good humor man.

361
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:08,245
Everyone wants a piece of my action now.
They think I'm one of the beach boys.

362
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,957
- Sally, this is my brother bill.
- Hi, bill.

363
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,836
You see that?

364
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,131
Me and her just had a whole conversation
in smile contact.

365
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,761
- Vi, do you have a jumper cable?
- Sure. Bridges?

366
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,054
Watch. You watching?

367
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,520
You two just did it. You smiled at her,
"see what I put up with?"

368
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,689
She smiled back at you, "he's harmless."

369
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,066
- Are you on uppers?
- I don't know.

370
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,903
Come on, bill. How 'bout a game of chess?

371
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,867
My brother, a miracle of modern medicine.

372
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,830
Wait.

373
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,793
My God, what a day.
Is he usually like that?

374
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,635
Try it!

375
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,972
Is it charging?

376
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,395
No!

377
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,148
I like this one.

378
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,193
It's just beautiful. It's a convertible.

379
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,405
I don't know how you keep warm.

380
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,242
It's got a great sound system.

381
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,911
Blaupunkt.

382
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,706
- Why is this one so much less expensive?
- That's two years older.

383
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,419
"I'm so tired when I come home at night,
I just fall right asleep.

384
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,049
"I know you didn't want me to get a job."
Thanks.

385
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,344
"But this isn't really a job,
since I don't get paid or anything.

386
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,805
"I hope you don't mind."

387
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,268
And then there's sort of a sexy ending.

388
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,853
"Love, Sally."

389
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,813
That's nice.

390
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,736
But you didn't tell him
the house you rented was on the beach.

391
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,614
I know.

392
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,202
And you didn't tell him
about the new car you bought.

393
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,623
I figure I'm going to save that
for when he gets home.

394
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,628
I got one from dink this morning.

395
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,171
Yeah?

396
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,049
All he said was, "got you another ear."

397
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,176
Poetic, huh?

398
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,930
A captain? Shit, bender.

399
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,975
You didn't go out and marry
a fucking captain, did ya?

400
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,352
That's right. Why? What were you?

401
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,813
A sergeant.

402
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,984
So? Sergeants have a lot
of responsibility, don't they?

403
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,029
Yes. They sent me my stripes
on the hospital ship.

404
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,615
My reward for getting so fucked up!

405
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,660
Why are you so cynical about that, Luke?

406
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,039
What are you doing here?

407
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,499
Why aren't you on the golf course
teeing up balls?

408
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,044
Doing something you're good at?

409
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,379
I'm just trying to keep busy.

410
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,007
It gives you something
to talk about over Martinis...

411
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,343
How you're helping
out the poor cripples.

412
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,891
I don't think that I deserve that, Luke,
at all!

413
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:20,604
Maybe you're just getting ready for your
husband to come back in a body bag.

414
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,529
Read someplace else, man.

415
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,450
Luke?

416
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,209
Stop and listen to me!

417
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,880
What is the matter with you?

418
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,888
Why do you have to be such a bastard?

419
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,695
Kevin.

420
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,322
I thought you died Wednesday, man.

421
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,743
You can get paralyzed in a war
that doesn't even make sense...

422
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,830
And come back,
and they don't have the decent courtesy...

423
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:23,917
To ask you how you're doing.
You know, "can I do anything for you?"

424
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,004
I got a purple heart
from a goddamn second lieutenant...

425
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,131
That wasn't even in the damn war.

426
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,009
They don't tell you
how to manage your finances.

427
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,720
They don't tell you
about going back into society.

428
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,888
Half the people today still can't.

429
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,809
What about your sex life?
They don't tell you anything about that.

430
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,645
I went out the first time
and didn't know what to do.

431
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:47,607
What happens if my gizmo busts?
What happens if I have a bowel movement?

432
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,861
What happens if I get there
and don't know how to react?

433
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,448
There's not enough beds,
there's not enough staff.

434
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,451
It's really crowded.
Guys have to wait in line.

435
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,329
They're not prepared for the number
of wounded guys that are being sent back.

436
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,791
I don't think we're really clear
on what you're asking us for, Sally.

437
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,005
It's what I said.
We could do an article in the paper...

438
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,132
Maybe using these photographs...

439
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,301
Interviewing some of the guys maybe.

440
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,637
Isn't it difficult for the men
to be around young women?

441
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,183
When I joined weight watchers,
I didn't want any candy around.

442
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,477
I don't think that that's our function.

443
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,645
It seems we're more a base gossip sheet.

444
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,149
- You know, fun and games for the fellas.
- I agree with you, Connie.

445
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:33,987
I'm sorry, Sally. I hope you understand.
What's next on the agenda?

446
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:41,703
We have the little league playoffs
and the officer-son baseball game.

447
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,623
That's the 25th and the 27th, isn't it?

448
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,335
I want to say that I'm really shocked.

449
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,671
I'm shocked that you'd rather
write about a goddamn home run...

450
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,424
Than about what's going on
in this hospital.

451
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,345
I mean, you wouldn't feel that
way if they were your husbands.

452
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,186
Well, that sure is a mind-blower.

453
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,648
That's the way it was done 150 years ago.

454
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,858
- Things have improved.
- They certainly have.

455
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,610
Now, picture this.

456
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,364
Picture yourself as a young man,
150 years ago...

457
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,867
Cuddling with one of the most beautiful
girls in the country.

458
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,537
There's a girl. You're crazy about her.

459
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,039
What's shaking, man?

460
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,333
One of them days, man.

461
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,462
I was flashing back
to when I got fucked up.

462
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,636
Get out of the way!

463
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,641
I hurt myself.

464
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,743
Senator Kennedy, would you comment
on the death of Dr. king?

465
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,590
I think he dedicated himself...

466
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:21,178
To justice and love
between his fellow human beings.

467
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,932
He gave his life for that principle...

468
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,686
And I think it's up to those of us
who are here...

469
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,569
It was a choice between
dealing with that or with...

470
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,446
This football game last week.

471
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,324
They just said, "it's not our function."

472
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,076
I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm naive.

473
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,458
Naive? She wants to know if she's naive.
Man. Now, that's cold.

474
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,043
I'm a cold man.

475
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,462
You've done your duty
and served your purpose...

476
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:59,216
And so they just toss you into the heap
like used kleenex.

477
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,468
Yeah, that's the way it is. That's just it.

478
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,845
What is our function,
if it isn't to deal...

479
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,681
With the problems
that you guys face every day?

480
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,977
- God, the smugness! I can't believe it.
- Give 'em hell.

481
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,646
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:16,274
It's not gonna do any good,
but I'm rooting for you, bender.

483
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,984
Thanks a lot, Luke.

484
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,655
Seriously,
if they'd put something in the paper...

485
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,949
Bender, you're beautiful
when you're excited.

486
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,317
God only knows what he saw over there...

487
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,777
Or did.

488
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,865
I don't understand it.
He was only in 'nam for two weeks.

489
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,495
You know, I worry a lot about dink, too.

490
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,665
He's so funny, you know?
So uncomplicated.

491
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,794
He's more than just a roll in the sack.

492
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,048
I just hope he doesn't get totaled.

493
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,314
I got it.

494
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,235
Bender.

495
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,197
- You got a chair.
- You changed your hair!

496
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,033
You like it?

497
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,577
Yeah. It's very nice.

498
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,996
- You're mobile.
- I'll help you. Go ahead.

499
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,914
- Thanks, Luke.
- Hi, Rick.

500
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,583
- Luke, how you doing?
- Okay.

501
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,376
Congratulations.

502
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,892
Would you like to come over for dinner?

503
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,853
Wouldn't you like
to get out of here one night?

504
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,314
I'm a good cook.

505
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,859
Okay?

506
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:09,489
Beat 'em, bash 'em, that's our custom!
Come on, team, readjust them!

507
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,125
I hit him after the whistle, man!

508
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,503
What are you talking about?
I hit him after the whistle was blown!

509
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,755
He grabbed my chair!
Did you grab my chair?

510
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,465
I didn't grab his chair, man.

511
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,728
Can't you morons kick a field goal?

512
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,981
Field goal. Come on! Field goal, morons.

513
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,321
B-u-s-t! Bust 'em!

514
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:55,577
Beat 'em, bash 'em, that's our custom!
Come on, team, readjust 'em!

515
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:11,634
"Around about July 1,
my pa's mind would start wandering.

516
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,097
"He wouldn't give a damn about the cattle,
and that got us kids pretty excited.

517
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,934
"At the park, they'd have flags flyin'
and games of chance...

518
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,562
"...kissing booths and wrestling matches.

519
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,025
"But let me tell you,
that day was always too long for me.

520
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:31,321
"When it got dark, the band would play
the star-spangled banner...

521
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,198
"...and the fireworks would start.

522
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,117
"And I'd start thinking
about how brave those men were...

523
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,537
"...that fought in the revolution.
I'd dream about those men...

524
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,832
"...how they went to war for our freedom.

525
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,627
"I guess that's when
I decided to be a soldier...

526
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,922
"...seeing the sky lit
up with those rockets.

527
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:53,927
"I enlisted when I became of age.
I served in Europe in world war ii...

528
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,096
"...and was involved in the
liberation of dozens of towns.

529
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:01,643
"As I passed through them,
as I saw the faces of the people...

530
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,938
"...I realized I had fulfilled my dream.

531
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:10,485
"I had become one of those men
who had gone to war for freedom.

532
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,613
"I sure wound up doing
what I wanted to do...

533
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,783
"...and that's what July 4 means to me."

534
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,170
- I bet you can't do that.
- I can't do that.

535
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,755
Can you do this?

536
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,802
- No. I can't even...
- Go ahead, try it.

537
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,472
I can't do it.

538
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,811
Billy the kid, let's show these guys
what real talent is. Come on.

539
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,354
Give me your arm.

540
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,524
You know,
the duet we worked up just last night?

541
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,655
Billy, you going to play that thing?

542
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,157
Yeah, come on, Billy, play your guitar.

543
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,411
Come on. I love when you play the guitar.

544
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,636
"What is tomorrow?

545
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,514
"What is it we need?

546
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,475
"What will it give us?

547
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,395
"A new life we can lead

548
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:32,984
"will the wind crack the limbs
of a few dying trees?

549
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:41,951
"Will the branches unite
and bend in the breeze?

550
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,954
"Tomorrow is hope

551
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,166
"for it is something I've not seen

552
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,211
"tomorrow is a sunny day

553
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,215
"to live in a sunny dream"

554
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,561
come on, Billy, that sounded great.

555
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,746
I can't play my fucking guitar.

556
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,765
God!

557
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,941
It's all right, man.

558
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,778
It's going to be all right.

559
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,493
I think it really helped him,
having you there.

560
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,787
I really do.

561
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,460
Luke, are you okay?

562
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,505
Yeah.

563
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,174
Should we do the dinner another night?

564
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,301
No.

565
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:54,125
I think you were really wonderful with him.
I really do.

566
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,430
Boy.

567
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,435
Just come down here,
and hold the chair for me.

568
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,898
Thanks.

569
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,119
If you could pick my ankles up...

570
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,589
Thank you. That's good.

571
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:48,137
It's warm 'cause I've had the oven on.
I've got one of those timing devices...

572
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,515
That cooks your food
while you're at work.

573
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,898
Let me just move you around a bit.

574
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,401
- You like margaritas?
- Yeah.

575
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,115
I just happen to have some.

576
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,079
Let me just...

577
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,753
Do you get a chance to go out very much?

578
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,714
- To go to people's homes?
- No, I don't.

579
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,974
Let's go in the living room.

580
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,270
I think you can make it. Okay?

581
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,785
Let's see.

582
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,791
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

583
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,461
- What?
- What am I lighting a fire for?

584
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,842
The old girl scout instinct's coming.
Let's see. I've got a dip.

585
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,805
Sit down, bender.

586
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,647
Are you nervous?

587
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,150
Yes.

588
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,946
Why are you nervous?

589
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,328
This isn't
have-a-gimp-over-for-dinner night, is it?

590
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,788
You're not one of those weirdoes?

591
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,462
No, I'm not, Luke.

592
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,176
I know you're not.

593
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:57,391
I'm just very happy to be here.

594
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,942
I'm glad you're here.

595
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,908
How about some music?

596
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,917
I don't think you're going to like
my records very much.

597
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,046
You probably won't like
the way I dance either.

598
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,139
Do you know that when I dream...

599
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,769
I'm not in the chair?
I don't even have a chair in my dream.

600
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,896
I have legs.

601
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,821
When I was a kid,
I used to jump in my mother's kitchen...

602
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,574
And touch the ceiling.
She used to get pissed off...

603
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,161
'Cause I'd leave my handprints
on the ceiling, you know?

604
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,750
I still check the snow reports,
the conditions at mammoth.

605
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,919
I'm still the same person.

606
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,423
It's funny. People look at me...

607
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,885
They see something else,
but they don't see who I am, you know?

608
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,936
I think people have a real hard time
seeing who other people really are.

609
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,648
People don't see me like I really am.

610
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,609
People look at me, I think, and they see...

611
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,488
Cheery Sally, the captain's wife.

612
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,790
Sometimes I feel like
I'm becoming what people see.

613
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:52,214
You know,
I spend 95% of my time at the hospital...

614
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,383
Thinking about making love with you.

615
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,603
I've never been unfaithful to my husband.

616
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,807
Don't wake him up.

617
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,226
Doc.

618
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,228
Wake up.

619
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,024
We sail with the morning tide.

620
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,403
Doc, why don't you go to bed?

621
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,572
- Hi, Sally.
- Hi, doc.

622
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:02,034
- You think you can make it, doc?
- Sure.

623
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,498
- Smooth sailing, doc.
- Right.

624
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,045
Do you want a ride?

625
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,181
You sure I'm not heavy?

626
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,058
I wouldn't know.

627
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,731
- What are you doing?
- I don't know where to put my hands.

628
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,568
Put them in your pockets.

629
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,617
It seems strange to be here at night.

630
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,411
Not for me.

631
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,475
Thank you for the ride.

632
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,895
Thank you for the dinner.

633
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,389
Good night.

634
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,811
This just came.

635
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,484
Do you want me to stay?

636
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,321
I'll be in my office.

637
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,167
Vi?

638
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,378
- Vi?
- Here.

639
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,173
Orders from the front.

640
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:06,593
Would you believe we ate 200 gallons
of chicken noodle soup last week?

641
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,263
How do you feel about going
to Hong Kong for a week?

642
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,556
Are you kidding?

643
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,435
Bob and dink just got their r and r,
and they want us to catch the first plane.

644
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,645
- Hong Kong?
- Will you check the schedules?

645
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,023
I gotta get my hair done, go to the bank.

646
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,692
I think it's already tomorrow there.

647
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,195
A week?

648
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,947
Five days.

649
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,742
I can't go!

650
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,415
What am I supposed to do?
Walk out on my job?

651
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,917
Walk out on my brother?

652
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,045
I just can't, Sally.

653
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,215
Yeah.

654
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,427
I'm going to miss you. So's dink.

655
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,805
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Yeah.

656
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,726
- Give him a kiss for me.
- Right.

657
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,438
On the cheek!

658
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,109
He can dribble!

659
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,529
- How do you like that?
- Get out the way.

660
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,325
Great shot.

661
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,452
My best pass.

662
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,621
- Pick and roll.
- Okay, baby.

663
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,997
I got him!

664
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,793
Good shot!

665
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,462
You're out.

666
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,297
Okay, beanie, over your head.

667
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,800
Bender!

668
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,262
- All right!
- That's my best shot!

669
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,432
Good news!

670
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,519
I'm getting released on Thursday.

671
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,313
- I'm getting out!
- That's great!

672
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,482
- How you doing?
- Where you gonna go?

673
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,402
- You gonna stay with someone?
- Yeah, I've got my own place.

674
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,571
I'm going to have wheels.
I'll be in touch with you.

675
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,490
I owe you a dinner.

676
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:59,540
I wanted to tell you,
I'm not gonna be around for a while.

677
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,251
I just heard from Bob.
He's getting his r and r.

678
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,630
I'm going to be meeting him in Hong Kong.

679
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:13,011
- Have a nice trip.
- Yeah, I'll see you soon.

680
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,307
- Quarterback!
- Beanie!

681
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,309
The iceman returns again!

682
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,988
- Great shot!
- Come on, you buzzard, put it in the hole.

683
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,865
Here we go.

684
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,412
Hard over here. Over here.

685
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,415
There you go. Over this way.

686
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,548
Let's go, move it up. Put it down, man.

687
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,634
Down.

688
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,511
Good.

689
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,597
- How you doing, Sally?
- Vi!

690
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,266
Where is she?

691
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,866
Why did you have to go to work
in the hospital?

692
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,081
- Because I wanted to.
- But it's the pits!

693
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,293
You didn't have to do that.

694
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,342
I just don't want you to work.

695
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,243
I just don't understand it.

696
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:45,247
Five days, that's all I wanted.
I ask you, is that too much to expect...

697
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:48,250
From somebody that you've
been with for two years?

698
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,336
You know, like, women and dogs...

699
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,840
You got to have a license
to show you're the owner.

700
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,092
Yeah.

701
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,971
Thanks very much for all the advice.

702
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,433
I really appreciate it.
Listen, tell the head honcho over there...

703
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,227
That I'm going across the street.
I'll see him later.

704
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,564
- I'm sorry, dink.
- No. Thanks for everything.

705
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,316
Excuse me.

706
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,444
If you see vi,
thank her for me, too, will ya?

707
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,446
Make sure of that.

708
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:31,752
What the fuck is the matter with him?
Where's he going?

709
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:36,548
He's upset because vi didn't come,
and because I suggested...

710
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:40,218
That maybe he didn't have the right
to just order her over here.

711
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,553
We got to go get him.

712
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,598
No, Bob,
let's just be alone for a few minutes.

713
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,436
We are alone.

714
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,356
There's something wrong.

715
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:56,526
It's not you. It's just fucked up.

716
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,446
I can't get all this bullshit about 'nam
out of my head.

717
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,658
Why don't you talk to me about it?
I want to know what it's like.

718
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:06,119
I don't know what it's like.
I only know what it is.

719
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,247
A TV show is what it's like.

720
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,255
They sure as hell don't show what it is.

721
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,978
I got to find him.

722
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,448
Does she love me, Raul?

723
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,955
- She loves me, man.
- I wouldn't let you down, man.

724
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,791
- Those new heads will work real good.
- I appreciate it.

725
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,085
- Have a good day, Raul.
- Take her easy.

726
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,628
All right, man.

727
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,982
- How are my plants?
- They're fine.

728
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,650
Nah, they died.

729
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,988
- They died?
- Yeah. Sorry.

730
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,407
What?

731
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:28,785
- They died.
- Man, I only got two plants.

732
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,831
What do you think about
that Kennedy assassination?

733
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,332
What do you think about it?

734
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:39,463
Sally, listen, I made up my mind...

735
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,467
And you can tell the kid I'll marry her
if you want to.

736
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,010
You tell her.

737
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:49,139
Come on, give me a break.
I'm serious about this.

738
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:54,895
I put it down all in writing,
and what I wanted you to do is...

739
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,064
Kind of talk to her about it.

740
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:02,152
Okay, of course. I'll be glad to.

741
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,987
Okay!

742
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,532
Would you have married me
if I wasn't a marine?

743
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,243
- In a second.
- See, there?

744
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,870
What did I tell you?

745
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:15,415
Didn't I tell you the uniform
always used to mean something?

746
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:22,214
The entire structure
of the marine corps is changing.

747
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,093
It used to really mean something
to be a marine.

748
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:31,973
We're no longer the elite.
We're not even equal.

749
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,569
Excuse me.

750
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,210
Thank you.

751
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,106
Big hook.

752
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,487
Mister, can you walk?

753
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:32,117
No, I can't walk.
That's why I'm in this chair.

754
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,955
- What happened to you?
- Yeah, what happened?

755
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,249
I got in an accident. I had a bad accident.

756
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,710
I got a little piece of metal in my back.

757
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:45,088
And after that, I couldn't walk.
Mary, I'm going to go around.

758
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,299
- I don't believe you.
- You don't?

759
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,968
- What's wrong with kids today?
- We don't believe you!

760
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,054
- What's the matter with you characters?
- We don't believe you.

761
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,389
I want a ride!

762
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,474
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

763
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,310
Here we go.

764
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,355
Are you going to help me out here?
Pull that back. That's it.

765
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,317
I'll show you a way out.
It's all right. We got it.

766
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,820
I'll show you a way out
when you don't pay, so you can sneak out.

767
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,076
My first week in combat...

768
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,582
We took this little Hamlet.

769
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:26,421
I got this second lieutenant, this...

770
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,759
Fucking camp lejeune whiz kid.

771
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,930
He comes whipping right on up to me:

772
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,182
"Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry to bother you...

773
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:40,936
"...but do you think it would be okay
if we put the heads on the poles?

774
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,189
"You know,
that really scares the shit out of the vc."

775
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,207
My men...

776
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,920
Were chopping heads off.

777
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,885
That's what they were into.

778
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,603
They were dead.

779
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,672
Do you like tiger balm?

780
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,092
Makes you feel real cool.

781
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,305
Put some on your back.

782
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,818
Is that the way you massage
the basket cases at the hospital?

783
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,644
It's open.

784
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:49,856
Hi.

785
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,444
Where's adrienne?

786
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,573
Couldn't make it.
She asked me to take her place.

787
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,327
I was kind of counting on adrienne.

788
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:06,998
I've been around this part
of the pool before.

789
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,792
With a gimp?

790
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,585
Yeah.

791
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,337
A guy in Reno.

792
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,298
Yeah.

793
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:18,176
- You want a drink?
- I'd love a drink.

794
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,678
"Well, there aren't many days

795
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,889
"and not enough time

796
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,146
"bedlam is silence

797
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,611
"and the stillness is fury"

798
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:41,699
Luke.

799
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,913
Put him on the phone. I'll talk to him.

800
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,331
Luke?

801
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,625
Hey, Luke.

802
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,378
Man, listen to this.

803
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,381
"When I opened my eyes

804
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,925
"a few were gone"

805
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,395
if I have to go, is this going to be okay?

806
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,604
Sure.

807
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:17,235
"I've got too many days, Luke

808
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,237
"and not enough time"

809
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,449
fucking shit.

810
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,918
Could I use your phone?
I should call my service.

811
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,420
Sure. Do what you want.

812
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:38,089
Just close the door when you leave, okay?

813
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,509
It's not your fault. You're a pretty lady.

814
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,764
Fuck off, man!

815
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,617
Munson, open the door, man.

816
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,048
Open up.

817
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,382
Open up the door.

818
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,885
- Let's go. Come on.
- Munson!

819
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,720
Come on, man.

820
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,972
- He won't even look at us.
- Is he loaded?

821
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,899
Come on. Open up the door.

822
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,752
Where the fuck is the goddamn nurse?

823
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,339
Come on!

824
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:05,927
Open the door!

825
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,470
No!

826
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,306
What's going on?

827
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,766
Come on!

828
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,188
Take it out!

829
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,040
The man went out.

830
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,840
- Make a hole.
- Come on!

831
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:45,717
Where the fuck have you been?

832
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,595
He had a syringe.

833
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,432
Did he do himself in?

834
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,392
Tell us something.

835
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:57,228
What's happening, man?

836
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:01,566
Some kid just bought it
by shooting air into his veins.

837
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,817
Did he do it?

838
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,736
Doc!

839
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,404
Yeah, he's dead.

840
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,364
All right, out of here!

841
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,949
It's all right.

842
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,873
Get out of my way. I want to find out.

843
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:21,210
Yeah, I'm gonna find out.
I'll let you know in a minute.

844
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,464
Shit. He's dead, man.

845
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:43,441
Vi!

846
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,623
He didn't even fucking call me.

847
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:04,295
Little bastard just wasted his life,
you know?

848
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:09,884
It's a big fucking relief,
if you know what I mean.

849
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,472
I mean, this nurse calls me
and says he's dead.

850
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,392
I don't even know her.

851
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,271
I just got to get out of here. Let's go.

852
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,358
Wait a second. I got to take a shower.

853
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:26,526
Yeah, me, too.

854
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:30,154
Have some wine or something.
I'll be right back, okay?

855
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,117
Don't go away.

856
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,994
I won't.

857
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,561
What do you think I should do, Sally?

858
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,401
I think I'm going to say yes.

859
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,571
To dink?

860
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,908
Congratulations, Mrs. mobley!

861
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:31,108
- Here you go, ladies.
- Did you order some more?

862
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:35,238
- We didn't order any more champagne.
- Those gentlemen over there did.

863
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,830
You're not calling them over?

864
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,208
They want us to come over!

865
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:50,086
I'll take care of this. You get your stuff.

866
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,101
We're the boys from number 9.

867
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,879
What...

868
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,131
In the fuck are you doing?

869
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,593
- Shit!
- I'm so happy.

870
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,308
- We'll get a little light.
- Are we here?

871
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:12,645
This is your honeymoon cottage.

872
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,825
Take off your coat.

873
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,618
You're such a good horse.

874
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,912
What's the matter with you? You insane?

875
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,914
You know you're on a military base?

876
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,791
Where do you think you are?

877
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,043
What are you doing?

878
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:43,676
- Corporal, what's this all about?
- This guy seems to be tied up to the fence.

879
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,429
I don't know what your beef is,
and I don't care...

880
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:48,973
But I want this chain off the fence now.

881
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,183
Why don't you pay attention,
motherfucker?

882
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,643
Buddy, there's still time.

883
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:56,313
- We need some entertainment.
- The lady wants some music.

884
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:59,692
We need some entertainment.
Sally, come on!

885
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,657
Yes, got it!

886
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,370
Appropriate music.

887
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,332
It's very entertaining.

888
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,502
- You guys ever been to a go-go club?
- Tonight.

889
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,796
No. That was not a go-go club.

890
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,842
- What does a real go-go look like?
- I'm going to show you.

891
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,177
Show us!

892
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,929
It's high up here.

893
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,700
She's very good. What does she do?

894
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,037
She's one of the nutritionists
at the va hospital.

895
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:00,211
I think I see some flesh here.

896
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,048
Take it easy, now. Now, Bruce is here, vi.

897
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,896
Easy does it, vi.

898
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,399
Take it easy.

899
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:28,989
You didn't have to do that.
Are you all right?

900
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:36,789
Sally!

901
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,501
My brother!

902
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,467
What happened? What's wrong?

903
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,803
I think she freaked out.

904
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,516
Maybe we should have turned on the TV.

905
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:58,435
He identified himself as Luke Martin.

906
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:01,564
He said he was a sergeant
in the marines in Vietnam.

907
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,776
He was arrested after
he chained himself here to the west gate.

908
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:09,363
He said he wants to stop any others
from going to Vietnam.

909
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:12,825
The reason why I'm here
is because a buddy of mine...

910
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:16,579
Who'd been in 'nam
took his own life today.

911
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:19,540
- This is kind of a funeral service.
- It's Luke.

912
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:22,167
I'm here because I'm trying
to tell people, man...

913
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:24,044
If we want to commit suicide...

914
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,589
We have plenty of reasons
to do it here at home.

915
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:30,217
We don't have to go to Vietnam
to find reasons for us to kill ourselves.

916
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,178
I just don't think we should be over there.
I think that...

917
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,098
Do you think this is a way to stop it?

918
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:39,310
- I don't know, man.
- Get him outta here.

919
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:42,479
Police had difficulty
getting sgt. Martin into the police car...

920
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:45,566
Because he also was chained
to his wheelchair.

921
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:00,998
Let me take you home.

922
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,484
I'm not a very nice person.

923
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,118
You are to me.

924
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,676
I want to spend the night with you.

925
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,364
- Where's your car?
- Over here.

926
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,595
Yeah, they're out of the car.

927
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,848
Goddamn thing has a curtain.

928
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,435
Coming around the side.

929
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:52,484
Is she pushing him,
or is he going under his own power?

930
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,194
She's pushing.

931
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,818
Make yourself comfortable.

932
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:37,988
I have some things to do in the bathroom.

933
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,658
I should be just a few minutes.

934
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:43,327
Okay.

935
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:25,369
Could you pull that sheepskin
toward the center?

936
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,123
Put the pillow up.

937
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:32,000
Put the pillow up against the back.

938
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:36,046
Like that?

939
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:16,170
Turn the light on. I want to see you.

940
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:29,558
What do I do?

941
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:32,019
Everything.

942
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:34,521
I want you to do everything.

943
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:37,065
Where can I touch you?

944
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,650
Where can you feel?

945
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:44,364
That's nice. I'm real sensitive,
all the areas that I feel.

946
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,408
I'm real sensitive there.

947
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:56,460
- Can you feel that at all?
- I can't feel it, but I can see it.

948
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,222
I wish you could feel me.

949
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,224
I feel you.

950
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:14,811
I want you.

951
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,135
Softly.

952
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,598
You're so beautiful.

953
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,001
That's never happened to me before.

954
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:17,392
How much am I paying you?

955
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:29,029
Going to paint this?

956
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:32,282
We'll paint it to look like steps,
so no one will know I'm here.

957
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:34,034
Are you ready?

958
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,498
Okay.

959
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:04,272
This, strangely enough, is our barber.

960
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,984
For 25 cents, you get a massage,
your hair cut, and your ears popped.

961
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:12,030
Impressive?
The water buffalo didn't like us, either.

962
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,573
There's a tunnel. Look.

963
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,700
They had a sophisticated tunnel network.

964
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:19,413
They've been working on it since wwii
when they were fighting the Japanese.

965
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:23,166
Then they fought against the French
and built more tunnels. Now they got...

966
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:27,796
That's a buddy of mine, Willie.

967
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:30,382
He didn't make it.

968
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:32,926
Pretty people.

969
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,387
That's my smile.

970
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,534
My God!

971
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:00,328
Got a letter from Kathy.

972
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,666
Something about the newspaper.

973
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,690
That letter was from Bob.

974
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:35,238
How is he?

975
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:38,200
I don't know.
I didn't get a chance to read it.

976
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:39,743
I guess he's okay.

977
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,749
Whatever he says...

978
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:51,671
It's 100 times worse
than what he can tell you.

979
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:54,841
I'm so perverse.

980
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,804
I'm just jealous because I know
when that thing's over, man...

981
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:02,057
He's gonna come back to you.

982
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:33,797
We never manage
to talk about Bob, do we?

983
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,258
No, we don't.

984
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:48,895
I don't know what's going to happen...

985
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,314
With Bob and me, Luke.

986
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,030
It's very scary for me...

987
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,867
To think that maybe
it's not going to work out with him.

988
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,160
I know.

989
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,499
Because we've been together for so long.

990
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:21,511
It's going to be very hard for him...

991
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:25,557
And he's not going to like
the fact that I've changed.

992
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:30,854
And I have changed.

993
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:37,652
You know that I've never
been on my own before?

994
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:05,347
- You like that, sid?
- She's got a nice ass for a white girl.

995
01:34:05,389 --> 01:34:08,058
You should have heard the tapes
we made at their pad.

996
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:12,395
- Do they get it on?
- I'll give him credit for that.

997
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:15,815
- You got a good angle?
- Yeah.

998
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:39,422
I don't know,
because everybody's different.

999
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:40,799
Don't you think so?

1000
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:45,095
It's cool. It's all right.

1001
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:46,846
Have a nice time.

1002
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:50,600
- Two, please.
- Okay.

1003
01:34:52,144 --> 01:34:53,561
If dink saw you...

1004
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:56,189
He'd probably think
you were a hippie faggot.

1005
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:59,776
- Here's to dink, vi.
- A toast to the host.

1006
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:02,904
Not here for a beer.

1007
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:08,118
- Don't.
- If that motherfucker sends me an ear...

1008
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:11,371
Are you listening?

1009
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:14,499
I just made up a poem,
and you're not even listening.

1010
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:30,557
Bye, guys. See you tomorrow.

1011
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,142
Bye, Rita.

1012
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:42,026
Hi.

1013
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:47,490
It's from Bob. I opened it.

1014
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:50,160
He's coming home.

1015
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,913
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's all right.

1016
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:57,917
He just got shot in the leg.
Nothing really too heavy.

1017
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,502
He's all right.

1018
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,561
Will you always be my friend?

1019
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:22,317
Yes.

1020
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:25,987
Say, "always."

1021
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:28,865
Always.

1022
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,284
I will always be your friend.

1023
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:35,205
Good.

1024
01:36:43,088 --> 01:36:44,881
I'm going to miss you.

1025
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:35,139
Hold on a second, will you?

1026
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:43,940
Yeah?

1027
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,276
Yeah, this is he.

1028
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:53,825
What I have to say to high-school kids
they're not ready for.

1029
01:37:57,621 --> 01:38:01,291
Yeah, that was television.
I was angry. I was upset.

1030
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:19,702
What the hell did you do to your hair?

1031
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:24,415
I've stopped straightening it.

1032
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:29,212
Where's all the demonstrators?
Some asshole on the plane...

1033
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:32,048
Told us there was gonna be
some flower heads out here.

1034
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:36,427
There's some kids out there,
but they can't come on the base.

1035
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:39,472
- Does your leg hurt?
- No.

1036
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,353
- What do you think?
- About what?

1037
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:46,813
Our new car.

1038
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:50,233
A speedster?

1039
01:39:52,903 --> 01:39:54,278
It's outstanding.

1040
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:59,242
- Absolutely outstanding.
- I'm glad you're back.

1041
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,748
One, two, three, four,
we don't want your rotten war!

1042
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,630
Peace, brother.

1043
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:15,091
Peace on you, too, brother.

1044
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:30,106
You never told me
that you were this close to the beach.

1045
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:32,275
I wanted to surprise you.

1046
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:34,986
You're full of surprises.

1047
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:42,160
Welcome back, hero!

1048
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:45,705
- Vi, how are you?
- Great.

1049
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:51,294
- So tell me, how's dink?
- Dink is fine.

1050
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:56,132
- He's kicking everybody's ass, as always.
- Great.

1051
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:01,054
No, ladies first,
but I'll have the number 2 one.

1052
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:04,348
My God, does this look good.

1053
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:05,641
Cheers.

1054
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:08,269
Are you hungry?

1055
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:10,813
I made some
Swedish meatballs to nibble on.

1056
01:41:10,856 --> 01:41:12,857
They go great with drinks.

1057
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:18,821
You like it?

1058
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,618
- How's the surf?
- It's good.

1059
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,870
Why don't you sit down, sweetheart?

1060
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:28,623
So, Bob, tell us about your foot.

1061
01:41:29,124 --> 01:41:32,376
It's not my foot. It's my leg.
And it's a goddamn bore.

1062
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:35,421
Just like this whole fucking war is boring.

1063
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:38,007
But, ladies...

1064
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:44,013
Bob has got to tell you one thing
that is not boring.

1065
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:47,809
That is the good old us of a Martini...

1066
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:52,230
Of which I am going to partake
as much as I can...

1067
01:41:52,314 --> 01:41:53,940
As quick as I can.

1068
01:41:54,024 --> 01:41:56,109
Drink it up. I made gallons.

1069
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:00,488
So, come on, Bob,
tell us the story about your leg.

1070
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:01,906
What happened?

1071
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:04,242
There's nothing to tell.
I'm a fucking hero.

1072
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:07,370
They're going to give me a medal.
That's the story of my leg.

1073
01:42:07,412 --> 01:42:08,871
Nothin' to it, is there?

1074
01:42:09,414 --> 01:42:11,374
- Great.
- It ain't great.

1075
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:13,084
How did it happen?

1076
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,714
Look, it's just a boring story.

1077
01:42:18,757 --> 01:42:20,716
I mean, I'm on my way to the showers.

1078
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:24,679
- Got an m-16 in one hand...
- On your way to the showers?

1079
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:27,098
Yeah. I mean, why not?

1080
01:42:27,182 --> 01:42:29,767
Everywhere you go,
you better carry an m-16...

1081
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:32,395
Particularly when you go to the showers.

1082
01:42:32,437 --> 01:42:34,647
There I am, like every other asshole...

1083
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:37,066
Trucking on down the road
to the showers...

1084
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:40,736
And I tripped and shot myself...

1085
01:42:41,738 --> 01:42:43,364
Right in the calf.

1086
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:46,159
- My God.
- And that's it.

1087
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,327
Dink should have thought of that.

1088
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:50,872
I didn't think of that!
That's the way it happened!

1089
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:53,958
- It was a goddamn accident!
- You don't have to get mad.

1090
01:42:54,084 --> 01:42:56,377
Yeah, but it was an accident.

1091
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:59,463
Why are they decorating you?

1092
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:03,759
- Where's the head?
- Right there.

1093
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:09,223
I promised a guy from 'nam...

1094
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:12,852
I'd have a drink with him
at the officers club, and I've got to go.

1095
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:16,439
I'll be back for dinner.

1096
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:31,287
Direct hit!

1097
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:34,248
You couldn't have done it better
if you had your lights on.

1098
01:43:37,502 --> 01:43:41,088
Man, if you'd keep your lights on,
you wouldn't hit things like that.

1099
01:43:41,506 --> 01:43:45,301
It looks like
a fucking smithereen job to me.

1100
01:43:45,928 --> 01:43:48,596
I feel like that fucking...

1101
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,890
Woman on the front of
the boats, you know?

1102
01:43:50,974 --> 01:43:53,142
Like the sss...

1103
01:43:56,188 --> 01:43:58,272
Sally, I'm sorry.

1104
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:02,652
I'm sorry, darling.
But, don't run out on me, you...

1105
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:05,863
These are two friends of mine.
No, Sally, wait a sec.

1106
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:11,494
My wife Sally.
This is... what was your name?

1107
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:12,578
Monty.

1108
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:19,835
I don't know them. Who are you?

1109
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,839
- Usa.
- My wife Sally...

1110
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:26,133
There's two things that smell like fish.

1111
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,927
One of them's fish.

1112
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,892
So go on already.

1113
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:37,478
"Avoid loud and aggressive persons.

1114
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:39,563
"They are vexations to the spirit."

1115
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,232
I'm passing out.

1116
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:45,027
"Keep interested in your own career,
however humble.

1117
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:49,115
"It's a real possession
in the changing fortunes of time."

1118
01:44:50,742 --> 01:44:52,952
What is that tank for up there?

1119
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:56,747
What's that turtle's name?
Let's give him a drink.

1120
01:44:56,832 --> 01:45:00,167
- No, don't.
- Don't pour the beer in there!

1121
01:45:01,044 --> 01:45:03,462
Wait! You'll kill the goddamn...

1122
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:06,590
No, damn it! You ain't feedin' no turtle!

1123
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:12,430
You nickel-dick, that's not even real.
That's a plastic turtle.

1124
01:45:12,514 --> 01:45:16,600
Don't look at that turtle.
I don't want you to look at that turtle.

1125
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:21,731
Did you hear about the female peanut
walking down the street at night?

1126
01:45:21,773 --> 01:45:23,316
She was a salted.

1127
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,989
That's the third time
he's told that joke tonight.

1128
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:32,992
She was assaulted, and he was insulted.

1129
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:24,877
- Capt. Hyde?
- Yeah.

1130
01:46:24,961 --> 01:46:26,629
The major's ready.

1131
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:42,061
Maj. Mailer, capt. Hyde.

1132
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:45,398
Capt. Hyde, this is Mr. ott.

1133
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:47,650
- How do you do, sir?
- Mr. Roberts.

1134
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:50,820
- Captain.
- They're with the FBI.

1135
01:46:51,446 --> 01:46:53,656
Would you like to have a seat?

1136
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:56,075
No, thank you.

1137
01:46:56,618 --> 01:47:00,538
Captain,
what can you tell us about Luke Martin?

1138
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,039
Aren't you going to park?

1139
01:47:48,044 --> 01:47:49,879
What are you going to do?

1140
01:47:50,547 --> 01:47:51,714
Drive.

1141
01:47:54,342 --> 01:47:56,010
I'll come with you.

1142
01:47:56,052 --> 01:47:57,595
No, I'd just...

1143
01:47:57,971 --> 01:47:59,722
Like to be by myself.

1144
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:02,391
Please?

1145
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:14,236
Are you going to be long?

1146
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:17,281
No.

1147
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:34,715
When that gun goes off,
you've got to uncoil like a spring...

1148
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:36,592
You've got to come.

1149
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:38,594
Just release.

1150
01:48:38,803 --> 01:48:40,638
Swimmers, take your marks.

1151
01:48:40,722 --> 01:48:44,266
I mean, you got to put
everything you have, you know...

1152
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:46,268
Into that moment, right?

1153
01:48:46,394 --> 01:48:48,103
And get as far toward the...

1154
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:51,440
I used to think about
the other end of the pool, you know.

1155
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:53,108
You Luke Martin?

1156
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:56,111
Depends.

1157
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:57,821
I'm Bob Hyde.

1158
01:49:03,954 --> 01:49:06,872
Let's take a little break, mark, okay?

1159
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:18,133
I told Sally I was going to do this.

1160
01:49:20,136 --> 01:49:22,513
You have a right to know
about the surveillance.

1161
01:49:22,597 --> 01:49:24,139
They were watching the house.

1162
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:27,226
They got pictures. They got tapes.

1163
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:37,736
Thanks...

1164
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:41,865
For letting me know.

1165
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:07,308
That's all I had to say.

1166
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,853
The rest is up to Sally.

1167
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:15,107
I guess.

1168
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:19,695
See you.

1169
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,570
Luke. What?

1170
01:51:01,696 --> 01:51:02,905
How am I taking what?

1171
01:51:03,114 --> 01:51:04,865
He didn't tell you?

1172
01:51:05,992 --> 01:51:08,035
I could have sworn that...

1173
01:51:09,537 --> 01:51:12,539
Listen, they probably had
some surveillance on me...

1174
01:51:12,582 --> 01:51:14,208
Because of the gate thing.

1175
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:15,793
Yeah?

1176
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:19,838
My God.

1177
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:21,757
Listen, I'm going to be here.

1178
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,552
If you need me, call me. I'm just here.

1179
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,286
I wanted to talk to you.

1180
01:53:16,873 --> 01:53:20,334
You seem so far away from me
since you came back.

1181
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:24,713
I've been scared.

1182
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,929
I love you.

1183
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:35,557
I do.

1184
01:53:41,105 --> 01:53:43,649
I'm not going to make excuses
for what happened.

1185
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:49,112
It happened.
I needed somebody. I was lonely.

1186
01:53:49,197 --> 01:53:52,658
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's not... Bob, I was lonely.

1187
01:53:52,742 --> 01:53:54,159
Don't bullshit me.

1188
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:55,327
It's not bullshit.

1189
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:56,912
- It's bullshit!
- Bob, please!

1190
01:53:56,955 --> 01:53:58,372
Goddamn it, it's bullshit!

1191
01:53:58,414 --> 01:54:00,958
Everybody needs somebody,
for Christ's sake!

1192
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:03,418
If it's over with us, it's over!

1193
01:54:05,463 --> 01:54:08,257
What are you saying?
That you won't even make the effort?

1194
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:13,095
What I'm saying is,
I do not belong in this house!

1195
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,806
And they're saying
that I don't belong over there.

1196
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:18,350
- Who's they?
- The people that make the decisions...

1197
01:54:18,434 --> 01:54:20,477
About the war! That's who "they" is.

1198
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:23,647
- I don't want to talk about the war.
- What should we talk about?

1199
01:54:23,731 --> 01:54:26,483
The fucking marriage? Think about that.

1200
01:54:26,568 --> 01:54:28,694
I can't talk to you when you're shouting.

1201
01:54:28,903 --> 01:54:31,446
I want to be your husband.

1202
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:34,575
I just don't deserve to be your husband.

1203
01:54:35,785 --> 01:54:38,453
I don't deserve the medal
I'm getting tomorrow either.

1204
01:54:38,496 --> 01:54:42,124
How can they give you a medal
for a war they don't want you to fight?

1205
01:54:42,166 --> 01:54:44,710
- Now, who is that?
- Bob? Sally? Can I talk to you?

1206
01:54:44,794 --> 01:54:47,004
It's Luke. Let me tell him to go away.

1207
01:54:47,088 --> 01:54:50,173
What? Now, wait a minute.
You just wait right there.

1208
01:55:10,028 --> 01:55:13,405
I don't want to make anything
more complicated than it already is.

1209
01:55:16,492 --> 01:55:19,286
I just thought there might
be a few things that...

1210
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:21,997
We should talk about.

1211
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:24,499
They're not very complicated.

1212
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:28,754
Actually, they're very simple.

1213
01:55:33,718 --> 01:55:35,510
I don't belong here.

1214
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:37,679
You belong here.

1215
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:41,767
I just wanted to get things straight...

1216
01:55:42,685 --> 01:55:44,561
What's going on with me...

1217
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:47,314
So you know where I'm coming from
and what happened.

1218
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:49,691
I know where you're coming from.

1219
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:53,362
And I know what happened.

1220
01:55:55,573 --> 01:55:58,033
I've just got to figure out...

1221
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,369
For myself...

1222
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:04,539
What happened
and how I'm going to deal with it.

1223
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:05,916
I can understand that.

1224
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,250
- Bullshit!
- Don't!

1225
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:10,379
- You Jody fuck! You get back!
- No, Bob...

1226
01:56:10,463 --> 01:56:12,214
Get back, slope cunt!

1227
01:56:15,718 --> 01:56:19,054
Now, you Jody motherfucker,
you explain to me...

1228
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:21,556
How it is you understand anything.

1229
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:23,976
I can understand because I'm a brother...

1230
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:26,436
And I've been in the same
place you're at now.

1231
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:27,980
That's why I feel so bad...

1232
01:56:28,064 --> 01:56:30,357
That I made it harder
for you than it is.

1233
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,025
That's bullshit.

1234
01:56:34,028 --> 01:56:37,698
She's here because she loves you,
and there was never any question of that.

1235
01:56:37,907 --> 01:56:39,574
Don't tell me that, goddamn it!

1236
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:41,410
It's true, what he's saying.

1237
01:56:41,619 --> 01:56:42,995
Bullshit!

1238
01:56:44,372 --> 01:56:47,958
If you give her a chance, she can help you.

1239
01:56:50,086 --> 01:56:51,670
She wants to listen to you...

1240
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,089
And she wants to understand you.

1241
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:55,966
Say something else, fuck.

1242
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:08,854
I'm not the enemy.

1243
01:57:11,733 --> 01:57:14,151
Maybe the enemy is the fucking war.

1244
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:20,532
But you don't want to kill anybody here.

1245
01:57:21,075 --> 01:57:23,702
You have enough ghosts to carry around.

1246
01:57:36,924 --> 01:57:38,508
Look at me.

1247
01:57:41,095 --> 01:57:42,596
My hand...

1248
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,979
I was shaking, and I'm...

1249
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:54,816
I'm sorry.

1250
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:00,655
I'm fucked.

1251
01:58:33,397 --> 01:58:36,191
I just want to be a hero...

1252
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:38,276
That's all.

1253
01:58:40,863 --> 01:58:43,073
I just want to be a fucking hero.

1254
01:58:45,034 --> 01:58:48,161
One day in my life, one moment.

1255
01:58:48,204 --> 01:58:50,122
I want to go out a hero.

1256
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:57,087
That way, I would've
done something that was mine...

1257
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,922
That I've done.

1258
01:59:34,041 --> 01:59:36,793
"Enemy forces captured
the north side of the bridge...

1259
01:59:36,878 --> 01:59:40,046
"...when lt. Roscoe charged forward,
firing his rifle.

1260
01:59:40,089 --> 01:59:42,674
"Lt. Roscoe's actions
so unnerved the enemy...

1261
01:59:42,758 --> 01:59:45,260
"...they withdrew from the position,
allowing him...

1262
01:59:45,344 --> 01:59:48,471
"...to secure the enemy position
until the rest of his company...

1263
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:51,266
"...could move forward
and consolidate their forces.

1264
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:55,353
"Lt. Roscoe maintained the position
against the repeated enemy attacks.

1265
01:59:55,479 --> 01:59:58,148
"Though wounded,
continued to inspire his men...

1266
01:59:58,232 --> 02:00:01,026
"...until reinforcements arrived
the following morning.

1267
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:05,280
"Lt. Roscoe has upheld the highest
traditions of the marine corps...

1268
02:00:05,323 --> 02:00:07,782
"...and of the united
states naval service."

1269
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:12,954
The marine corps builds
body, mind and spirit.

1270
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:14,539
Thank you.

1271
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:22,464
And now, with a different perspective,
we have Luke Martin...

1272
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:25,091
Combat veteran of the marine corps.

1273
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:48,740
- Sergeant, mind if I ask you a question?
- No, sir.

1274
02:00:49,325 --> 02:00:51,993
You can just call me sergeant.
That's what I was.

1275
02:00:54,038 --> 02:00:56,122
- Where were you stationed?
- Da nang.

1276
02:01:05,716 --> 02:01:08,301
I thought I'd go get some steaks
for a barbecue.

1277
02:01:08,344 --> 02:01:10,136
Would you like that?

1278
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:15,183
It's been a long time
since you've lit a barbecue, hasn't it?

1279
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:18,770
The charcoal's under the kitchen sink.

1280
02:01:18,854 --> 02:01:22,440
I'll see if vi wants to come with me.
I'll see you later.

1281
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:44,129
You know, you want to be a part of it,
be patriotic, and go out and...

1282
02:01:45,172 --> 02:01:48,842
Get your licks in for the us of a.

1283
02:01:53,389 --> 02:01:57,726
When you get over there,
it's a totally different situation.

1284
02:01:58,978 --> 02:02:00,228
I mean...

1285
02:02:02,606 --> 02:02:04,607
You grow up real quick...

1286
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:10,113
Because all you're seeing is
a lot of death.

1287
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:48,860
I know some of you will
look at that uniform...

1288
02:02:48,944 --> 02:02:53,907
And remember all the films
and think about the glory of other wars...

1289
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:56,951
And think about some vague...

1290
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:04,459
Patriotic feeling
and go off and fight this Turkey, too.

1291
02:03:32,488 --> 02:03:34,656
I'm tellin' you, it ain't like the movies.

1292
02:03:34,698 --> 02:03:37,158
That's all I want to say.
I didn't have a choice.

1293
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:38,993
When I was your age...

1294
02:03:39,328 --> 02:03:41,568
All I got was a guy
standing up like that

1295
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:43,832
and giving me bullshit,
which I caught.

1296
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:47,293
I was in good shape then.
I was the captain of the football team...

1297
02:03:47,336 --> 02:03:49,170
And I wanted to be a war hero.

1298
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:52,006
I wanted to go out and kill for my country.

1299
02:04:10,317 --> 02:04:12,152
And now I'm here to tell you...

1300
02:04:12,194 --> 02:04:15,280
That I have killed
for my country, or whatever...

1301
02:04:16,657 --> 02:04:18,992
And I don't feel good about it.

1302
02:04:23,205 --> 02:04:25,874
Because there's not enough reason.

1303
02:04:33,174 --> 02:04:35,383
To feel a person die in your hands...

1304
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:38,219
Or to see your best buddy
get blown away...

1305
02:04:43,893 --> 02:04:47,312
I'm here to tell you
it's a lousy thing, man.

1306
02:04:47,813 --> 02:04:50,023
I don't see any reason for it.

1307
02:04:54,069 --> 02:04:56,905
And there's a lot of shit
that I did over there...

1308
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,825
That I find fucking hard to live with.

1309
02:05:01,243 --> 02:05:03,870
I don't want to see people like you
coming back...

1310
02:05:03,913 --> 02:05:07,081
And having to face the rest
of your lives with that shit.

1311
02:05:07,124 --> 02:05:09,834
It's as simple as that.
I don't feel sorry for myself.

1312
02:05:09,919 --> 02:05:12,962
I'm a lot fucking smarter now
than when I went...

1313
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:18,635
And I'm just telling you...

1314
02:05:21,013 --> 02:05:23,598
There's a choice to be made here.

1315
02:05:25,623 --> 02:05:34,523
