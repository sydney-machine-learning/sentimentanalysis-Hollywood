1
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,650
Come on, come on.

2
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,312
Where the hell have you been?

3
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,144
Late.
That I figured.

4
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,563
Honey, this is
a big deal for me.

5
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,486
Well, Hendricks had the keys to the
jeep and I couldn't find the spares.

6
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,585
Terrific. Listen,
do me a favor

7
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,452
act as if you've been
here the whole time.

8
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,575
How do I do that?

9
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,743
Just look bored.

10
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,712
Thank you, Amity High School Band
for that eloquent selection.

11
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,789
We're happy once again...

12
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,415
Mama, Michael won't talk to me.

13
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,795
What are you doing here, tiger?

14
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,004
Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.
It's okay. It's okay.

15
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,970
And now, this year's Miss Amity,

16
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,517
Tina Wilcox...

17
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,053
...will cut the ribbon,

18
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,983
officially opening
this luxurious new hotel.

19
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,447
This money tree,
you may have noticed,

20
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,824
is donated by Len Peterson,

21
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,453
the builder of Amity
Shores Condominiums,

22
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,080
as a gesture of goodwill
towards the community.

23
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,002
Let's hear it for Len.

24
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,382
Thank you, Len.

25
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:02,431
$1,500 as a special gift to
the Amity Scholarship Fund.

26
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,346
Go ahead, Tina. Cut it.

27
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,355
Atta girl.

28
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,247
And now the Amity High Schoo!
Band once again.

29
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,920
Refreshments on
the patio, everyone.

30
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,463
Oh, boy.

31
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,461
Let's go get it.

32
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,863
Brody, how are you?
Hey, Len, how are you?

33
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,389
Hello, Martin.

34
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,814
I think it went well.

35
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,267
Oh, hell of a speech, Larry.

36
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,648
Terrific. Larry, it was
right on the money.

37
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,354
Thank you very much, Len.

38
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,485
Oh, Len, have you
met my son, Larry?

39
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,907
No, no.
Larry Junior.

40
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,663
Uh, Larry, would you
get over here, please?

41
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,327
Don't go away.
Here we go, Larry.

42
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,450
Say hello to Len.

43
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,906
How you doing?
Hi, Lar.

44
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,073
- Hi.
- Hi.

45
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,707
Nice lookin' boy.

46
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,251
Thank you.
Ellen.

47
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,834
Honey, would you be a love,
make sure that the bar is open

48
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,915
and everyone is taken
care of and happy? Hmm?

49
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,125
Happy. Sure.

50
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,509
Yes, sir, fantastic lady.

51
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,015
Don't know what
I would do without her.

52
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,640
Really? Neither do I.

53
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,684
How old is your cousin?

54
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,391
She's 17.
She's a senior.

55
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,103
I'm not crazy about blind dates.

56
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,489
Oh, they're okay if they got
little white canes and tin cups.

57
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,862
That's awful.

58
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,443
Oh, what the hell.

59
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,655
Did your mom
put all this together?

60
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,240
Yeah, it's her job.

61
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,705
Did she make the punch?

62
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,784
No.

63
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,869
Good. It's terrible.

64
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,284
Do you dance?

65
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,736
Nope.

66
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,287
Me neither.

67
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,703
Who you gonna ask next?

68
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,159
Tina Wilcox.

69
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,542
Ed's girlfriend.
You're crazy.

70
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,080
It doesn't hurt to ask.

71
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,963
Sometimes the most beautiful
girls are the loneliest.

72
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,008
That's a crock of shit!

73
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,339
I know.

74
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,307
Was it the fourth or fifth
night at the Jersey shore?

75
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,608
It was the fourth.

76
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,560
I thought you
wouldn't respect me.

77
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,271
I did. I did.

78
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,194
Why don't we get outta here?

79
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,617
Want to fool around?

80
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,326
Why not?

81
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,168
You're on.

82
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,873
This pipe has
more barnacles than you do.

83
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,126
What are you doing?
I told you...

84
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,833
Brush it off to your left.

85
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,088
Your other left.

86
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,753
Hey, I thought you're
supposed to be off duty.

87
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,053
Well, good morning.

88
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,882
Till noon.
This is on my own time.

89
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,467
Hey, Chief?

90
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,931
Yeah?

91
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,139
You got a gold-plater
in the main channel.

92
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,895
A big cruiser.

93
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,316
Whereabouts?

94
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,736
Off the Point.
No running lights.

95
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,480
Just a diver's flag.

96
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,523
Want me to run out there?

97
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,110
Yeah, would you? I can't run
this damn thing anyway.

98
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,910
Happy to do it.

99
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,466
Okay, I'll see you
back at the office.

100
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,865
And take the old man
of the sea with you.

101
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,122
All right, cast off the bowline.

102
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,670
And then cast off
the stern line.

103
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,170
And then cast off
the spring line. Let's go!

104
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,227
Look, we're only gonna be
here for a few minutes

105
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,423
<i>and then we're gem' out.</i>

106
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,970
Can't I come with you?
No.

107
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,055
Please? He can come
with me if he wants.

108
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,507
Yay!
No!

109
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,807
No yav?
No yay-

110
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,009
Boo, off the boat, brat.

111
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,016
Oh, he can help me
at least then. Come on.

112
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,181
Boo. Big brothers.

113
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,685
Hey, Sean, you ever
been an anchor before?

114
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,020
Come on! Whoa!

115
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,445
Hey, Mike, m.
Hi.

116
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,118
Going out right away?
No.

117
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,615
Good. I want you
to meet my cousin.

118
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,575
Look, don't worry, I'll meet her.
I'll meet her.

119
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,374
Okay, Tom, see you later.
Same time Thursday-

120
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,374
Hey, Andy!
Over here!

121
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,289
See you guys later!

122
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,684
What do we got?
What's the problem?

123
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,210
Uh, what isn't?

124
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,715
Brooke?

125
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,964
Brooke!

126
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,098
Jackie, hi!

127
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,473
Quick, quick, quick, who's that?
I think I'm in love.

128
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,792
Yeah, I hope that's the cousin.

129
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,895
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky!

130
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,373
Hey, Tim, did you see the
way she was looking at you?

131
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,149
Oh, she wants you, man.

132
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,155
No, she wasn't looking at me.

133
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,158
What are you saying? She was
staring at you and drooling.

134
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,582
No! I'm thin,
I wear glasses.

135
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,955
I live in Amity
Island year 'round.

136
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,912
I'm not good enough for her.

137
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,582
I guess you're right.

138
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,633
Probably wasn't lookin' at you.

139
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,508
Oh, Larry, look!
Larry, look!

140
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,215
What?
Look at her!

141
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,641
So glad to see you.

142
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,101
Oh, hi. Thanks.

143
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,646
She's got tits like a sparrow.

144
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,517
Do you have to talk like that?

145
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,652
What are you, my mother?
Will you undo the jib?

146
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,749
We're all going sailing.
Sailing?

147
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,125
Yeah, come on. I want
you to meet this guy.

148
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,492
Okay.
He's so cute.

149
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,525
Hey, look, I'm walking.

150
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,774
Leave him alone! He's tannin'
the soles of his feet-

151
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,450
Mike, over here!

152
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,995
Douglas!

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,502
I can't watch the news anymore,

154
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,509
I can't watch a ballgame anymore,
I can't even watch a movie!

155
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,598
All I hear is that damn
kid and his damn radio

156
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,597
<i>gem', “Breaker,
breaker, breaker.“</i>

157
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,098
Well, listen,
I'll do what I can,

158
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,613
but remember it's under
federal jurisdiction.

159
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,059
Well, call the FBI, will you?

160
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,825
Chief Brody, can I talk
to you for a minute?

161
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,351
Okay, one at a time,
one at a time.

162
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,857
Now, you two talk to Miss
Polly and you come with me.

163
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,361
Every time it's an out of
state car in my driveway...

164
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,609
Now, uh, what's this
about Grace Kinney?

165
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,990
Her bedroom window faces
my oldest boy's bedroom.

166
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,195
And she's teasing him.

167
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,031
She's dancing, dancing
around in her towel!

168
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,616
Dancing, huh?

169
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,997
Oh, Hendricks. Good, right this way.
Excuse us, please.

170
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,125
Now I want you to come in
here and check out this 908.

171
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,456
What the hell's a 908?

172
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,791
I never heard of a 908.

173
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,548
908 means get me outta
there-What's that?

174
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,549
A diver's camera. Tom
Andrews brought it up

175
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,096
from under the
abandoned cruiser.

176
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,719
Oh, the abandoned cruiser?

177
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,642
A couple of rich guys. Home
is Newport, Rhode Island.

178
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,095
You know, if I had
a $100,000 boat,

179
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,530
I wouldn't leave
it in the Channel.

180
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,353
If you had a $100,000 boat,
there'd be an investigation.

181
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,649
Very funny.

182
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,274
Grace Kinney is driving
my boy to distraction.

183
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,234
Dancing. You wanna check
out this dance for me?

184
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,406
Dance?

185
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,217
Wanna go back up?

186
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,262
Now back up, Mike!

187
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,981
Mike, it's twisted!

188
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,852
Underneath you, Mike.

189
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,142
Drop it down now.

190
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,110
Are you okay?

191
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,245
You okay?

192
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,009
Get down, Mike!

193
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,638
The weather
continues to <i>be</i> warm and clear.

194
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,216
<i>And now back to the
music 24 hours a day</i>

195
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,552
<i>from Plymouth,
the rock of New England.</i>

196
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,516
Wait. Take a break
for a minute, okay?

197
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,148
Hey, Tina?
Where you goin'?

198
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,002
Hey!

199
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,472
Eddie, come on, let's go skiing.
What's up?

200
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,647
What?

201
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,475
Come on, we can
use my uncle's boat.

202
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,481
Let's do it next week,
all right?

203
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,528
God, with you
everything is next week!

204
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,885
Terry?

205
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,994
Terry?

206
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,739
Terry?

207
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,447
WOW!

208
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,743
God!

209
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,048
I can't find anyone out here.

210
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,384
They must've gone to the bottom
or drifted with the tide.

211
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,436
Well, I've got witnesses that say
there <i>was</i> one person in the boat

212
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,479
and one person water skiing.

213
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,773
I told you, nothing here.

214
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,310
Well then, I want
you to try dragging.

215
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,938
For how long? Current's
moving everything around

216
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,773
and it's gonna be
dark pretty soon.

217
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,492
I don't care. I want you to
stay on it as long as it takes.

218
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,238
Ten-four.

219
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,796
We heard this noise like a boom,

220
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,223
and when we looked
there was this cloud of smoke.

221
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,515
That was the explosion.

222
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,720
One minute they were having a
wonderful time and the next...

223
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,016
And you've no idea what
could have caused this?

224
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,526
I don't know what
could have done that.

225
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,612
Were they
off-islanders?

226
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,943
I don't know.

227
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,653
Can we go now?

228
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,539
Chief?

229
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,328
Chief Brody, can we go, please?

230
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,963
Yes, thank you, Tina.

231
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,776
We've been over
this a dozen times.

232
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,072
I know, I know!

233
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,240
How much longer?

234
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,318
Until we find something.

235
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,530
I'm cold, bored!

236
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,239
You're bored?

237
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,710
Holy shit!

238
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,810
Jesus, this is heavy.

239
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,804
Aw, shit, drop it!

240
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,889
Well, what is it?
Drop it!

241
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,390
It's a power line.

242
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,562
Aw, terrific!

243
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,763
Let me untangle it.

244
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,100
We don't want a power
blackout on the island.

245
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,312
Let's get outta here
before we do find something.

246
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,326
That's your third smoke already.

247
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,666
With coffee.
Try a doughnut.

248
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,956
I want Fruit Loops.

249
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,412
Eat Cheerios.

250
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,497
You eat Cheerios.
I want Fruit Loops.

251
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,048
You eat Cheerios.

252
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,884
What are you guys up to today?

253
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,337
I don't know about him,
but I'm goin' sailing.

254
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,592
Again?

255
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,514
Well, what else is there to do?

256
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,433
How about that job you
were supposed to get?

257
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,894
Do I have to?

258
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,282
He doesn't really have to.
I mean, this is his vacation.

259
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,479
I wonder where I
left my date book.

260
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,822
Good morning.
Everybody up early today?

261
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,941
Something going on
I shouldn't know about?

262
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,367
Lots.

263
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,156
Look, this kid is 17.

264
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,238
We've talked about him
getting a job before.

265
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,538
I know, you're right.

266
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,926
I wish you could spend some time with him.
Take a half day off?

267
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,952
How can I? I'm in the
middle of a boat accident.

268
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,504
I've only got three regular
cops and a secretary.

269
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,957
And a deputy who's fallen in
love with the police launch.

270
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,292
And here's another one.

271
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,644
I mean, what is it
about this place?

272
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,090
Everybody's a boat freak.

273
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,130
It's an island.

274
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,891
I'm going.

275
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,721
Hold It, wait a minute.

276
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,698
I don't want you to go out
too far if it gets rough.

277
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,190
We've had a lot of
trouble out there.

278
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,394
Okay, I'll see you later.
I mean, be careful.

279
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,194
I'll be careful,
I'll be careful.

280
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,319
Tina, come back here.
Nope!

281
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,399
Come on.

282
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,411
Give me my hat!
Double nope!

283
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,864
Come on, Tina!

284
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,289
Come back here!

285
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,886
I wonder why they
decided to move?

286
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,012
Too hot in the lighthouse.

287
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,809
Too hot for those two?
I can't believe it.

288
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:12,900
Yuck!

289
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,472
I called you as soon
<i>as</i> I heard about this

290
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,840
because I hear the bites are big.
Really big.

291
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,589
Well, after we've
looked, we'll talk.

292
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,260
- All right.
- Here it is.

293
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,676
Uh, could you move back, please?

294
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,177
Could we have a little air?

295
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,724
That's right, move back.

296
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,678
Please just move
back? Thanks.

297
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,983
<i>Jesus.</i>

298
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,235
What do you think?

299
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,911
First things first.

300
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,538
Tip of the snout, please.

301
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,259
Length? Seven
and a half meters.

302
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,432
Seven and a half meters.

303
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,804
Correct.

304
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,768
You better check
the bite radius.

305
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,818
The what?
The shape of the mouth.

306
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,155
The whale's mouth?

307
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,447
Shark's mouth.

308
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,820
What shark?

309
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,446
The shark that did this.

310
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,162
But we don't know that, do we?

311
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,160
That's what we're
here to find out.

312
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,331
And we will.

313
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,876
Now, I can't hear you if you're
going to whisper.

314
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,874
111 centimeters.

315
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,626
111 centimeters.

316
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,706
Sixty-eight.

317
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,790
Sixty-eight.

318
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,961
I have had some
experience with sharks.

319
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,465
Oh, have you?

320
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,047
Yeah, and I think...

321
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,803
I think a great white
might've done this.

322
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,429
Carcharodon carcharias?

323
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,726
Right.

324
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,564
What makes you think there
might be one in these waters?

325
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,482
Well, it's obvious that...

326
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,732
That a big fish took
a bite outta this big fish.

327
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,485
This is a mammal, not a fish.

328
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,238
Don't quibble with me. Is it
a shark bite or isn't it?

329
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,735
Possibly.

330
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,245
Then again,
this is a killer whale.

331
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,120
It would have to be a shark
of considerable size.

332
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,461
Look, we know that sharks
are attracted by blood

333
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,791
and thrashing about.

334
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,217
And sound.

335
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:36,835
Sound?

336
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,841
Sound. Like
sonar or radar.

337
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,015
They hone in on unusualsounds,
irregular sounds,

338
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,969
almost any rhythmic
low-frequency vibration-.

339
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,850
That means that there
could be one around.

340
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,350
Not necessarily.

341
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,354
These wounds could have been inflicted
15 miles out to sea or more.

342
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,435
None of them were
immediately fatal.

343
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,580
Currents could have carried
the body 10 miles further.

344
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,322
We got a hell
of a tide this month.

345
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,570
Will you just take care
of the crowd, please?

346
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,696
Dad?

347
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,700
Mr. Hendricks, will you
take this down, please?

348
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,067
No more sailing today, okay?

349
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,468
And I'd like you to
come back with me.

350
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,584
We came out in my boat.

351
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,831
<i>Yeah, but Andy“ take K bash!</i>

352
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,834
I got a date.
She'll understand.

353
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,039
No, she won't.

354
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,225
Mike, for Christ's sakes, give
me a break here, will you?

355
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,047
Seventy-two centimeters,

356
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,878
allowing for salt water erosion

357
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,010
and subsequent small
predator tissue attacks.

358
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,685
It's either a great white
or another killer whale.

359
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,182
Well, I'd like to know which.

360
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,855
Well, it's impossible for me to
tell when the body's like this.

361
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,150
This animal has been
ashore for 10 or 12 hours

362
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,478
and drifting for a day at least.

363
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,983
Every little nibbler in
the sea's taken a bite.

364
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,900
I know that
dolphins communicate.

365
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,485
I mean, they send signals.

366
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,079
You don't think that
if a shark was destroyed,

367
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,282
that another shark could...
Could come and...

368
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,164
Sharks don't take things
personally, Mr. Brody.

369
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,129
Dad, can I please take my... No!

370
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,508
Hey, look, don't worry about it.

371
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,339
I'll take it back and
tie it up at the dock.

372
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,141
Bye, Mike, see you later.
I'm sorry.

373
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,719
It'll be okay, Mike. I'll see
you tomorrow. All right?

374
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,850
I appreciate it. Thanks.

375
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,880
Larry? Larry,
wait a minute.

376
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,975
I'm showing summer rentals.

377
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,552
I think we have a hell of a
good season going for us.

378
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,138
That's swell, Larry, but I
have to talk to you alone.

379
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,473
We're alone.

380
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,148
I think we may have
another shark problem.

381
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,697
Are you serious?

382
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,737
You bet I'm serious.

383
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,865
I've got a half-eaten
whale out on the beach.

384
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,696
I've got two persons missing.

385
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,157
This whale has got a bite
out of it about this big.

386
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,084
Martin, no one has seen
a shark. Be realistic.

387
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,162
I think the selectmen
should know about it.

388
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,294
I know it's just a feeling,
but you've got to understand.

389
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,594
Larry, for Christ sakes,
I not only have this attack,

390
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,842
but I've got... I've got two
water skiers who have...

391
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,641
A tragedy.
But a boating accident.

392
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,093
No fin, no sharks,

393
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,598
nothing but a boating accident.

394
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,905
But their boat's still missing.

395
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,433
We have a lot of deaths in these
waters that never turn up.

396
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,820
Are they all shark victims?

397
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,106
Maybe they are.

398
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,815
Oh, bullshit!

399
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,067
Bullshit?

400
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,487
Is it bullshit I got a whale on the
beach with a bite in it this big?

401
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,281
What am I, an ass?

402
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,953
When you called me, I called
Elkins and her bosses.

403
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,460
Nothing she saw is
proof of anything.

404
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,927
So that means we're not
gonna do anything, huh?

405
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,181
Martin, don't press
it this time.

406
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,429
Well, I've got to
get back to work.

407
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,233
Okay.

408
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,606
Okay, Larry, but you just
remember this conversation.

409
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,063
You just remember it!

410
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,602
Chief?

411
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,738
Yeah?

412
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,865
Chief? Hi.

413
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,784
Missed you at the funeral home.

414
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,536
Santos said you'd be here.

415
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,497
Yeah. Christ,
what a mess.

416
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,704
You didn't miss much.

417
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,623
Positive ID?

418
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,392
Well, we're pretty sure
it was the woman

419
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,963
aboard the boat, all right.

420
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,818
Yeah?

421
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,564
Thank you, operator,
just keep trying.

422
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,244
Anything new on
those two divers?

423
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,745
Nothing.

424
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,386
I think we ought to keep
sight-seers away from there.

425
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,055
Did you take a look
at that stuff in that box?

426
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,080
No.

427
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,040
How about that camera?

428
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,422
Might be something in it.

429
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,753
Yeah, right.

430
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,439
Why don't you take it over to
Fogarty's and get it developed?

431
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,816
I'll do it first
thing in the morning.

432
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,638
Why not now?
It's too late.

433
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,561
Christ, I'm late for dinner.

434
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,060
Listen, I'm expecting
a long distance call.

435
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,493
When it comes through, have them send
it over to the house, all right?

436
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,939
Okay, Chief.

437
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,150
Yes. Yes,
I can hear you.

438
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,361
Yes, I will. I'll give
him the message.

439
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,283
Thank you. MIKE: All right, now.
Look out.

440
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,909
That for me?
Oh, got it.

441
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,081
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.

442
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,328
Hi, gang.

443
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,039
Well, sort of.
Matt Hooper.

444
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,121
He's on the research
vessel Aurora,

445
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,956
presently in
the Antarctic Ocean,

446
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,809
and he won't be in radio
range till next spring.

447
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,551
Yeah, I gave him a call.

448
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,721
- Got you.
- Your point.

449
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,478
Martin?

450
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,738
Martin?

451
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,649
Yeah?

452
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,741
You're a mess.
Where were you?

453
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,324
I had to go over to Santos', I dragged
a body outta the ocean today.

454
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,825
Ugh.

455
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,041
Do you have any
idea what happened?

456
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,542
No, we don't know.

457
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,640
Santos seems to
think it might be one of

458
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,338
the victims from
that boat accident.

459
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,337
Do you wanna talk about it?

460
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,340
No.

461
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,517
Just routine.

462
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,352
Okay.

463
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,981
Hey, Mike, come here a minute.

464
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,186
Yeah? What is it?

465
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,942
I've got something
for you to do tomorrow.

466
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,614
Well, I kind of had plans.

467
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,861
What, sailing?

468
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,911
Oh, no, forget it. You're grounded.
Beached. That's it.

469
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,088
Hey, come on, Dad. BRODY: I
talked to John down at the beach.

470
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,392
He's got a job that's gonna last

471
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,716
right till you
go back to school.

472
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,458
Hey, that's all of summer.

473
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,012
I know it's all summer, but he
wanted a job and now he's got one.

474
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,084
I want that boat out of the
water by tomorrow night.

475
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,182
Dad, please,
can I just take it out...

476
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,207
By tomorrow night.

477
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,542
And I mean it!

478
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,563
Now, everybody here?

479
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,764
Just about.

480
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,982
Okay. Terrific.

481
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,319
Now, folks,
this is the town beach.

482
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,113
Now, the development naturally
has its own private access,

483
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,693
but what I wanted you to really
see was the concession area,

484
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,074
and take a look at this sand.

485
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,655
- It's like sugar.
- It's beautiful.

486
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:54,864
- Hmm?
- It really is.

487
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,915
You know, in the summer
time when the sun sets,

488
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,621
it goes right down there and the
whole beach looks incredible.

489
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,876
It really is. It can
be absolutely breathtaking.

490
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,333
I think you'll find this little
bandstand very interesting.

491
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,418
And, uh, we take quite
a bit of pride in this.

492
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,130
It was built in about...

493
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,341
Hello. Selling some
more of the good life?

494
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,141
Oh, yeah, piece of
this, piece of that.

495
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,343
It all adds up.

496
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,679
Your husband's been here all morning.
What's he doing?

497
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,059
His job.

498
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,779
Dad's got you working, huh?

499
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,235
- Yeah.
- I'm helping.

500
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,116
Good.

501
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,781
Do you happen to
know where your dad is?

502
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,241
Yeah, he's up there.

503
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,876
Oh, for Christ sake!

504
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,174
Well, if you have any questions,

505
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,473
any questions at alt about
recreational possibilities,

506
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,148
our lovely Ellen Brody here will
be only too happy to answer them.

507
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,594
Yeah, Len, Len.

508
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,946
Can I speak to you for a minute?

509
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,197
Sure. Excuse me
a moment, please.

510
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,501
Okay, anybody
have any questions?

511
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,435
Larry, I think we've got
a couple of live ones.

512
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,895
Brady's riding his tower.

513
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:09,864
Oh, shit!

514
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,236
Whoo! Let's go.

515
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,567
Let's go faster.

516
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,323
You got it, sweetheart!

517
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,951
Come on! Whoa!

518
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,243
Yeah.

519
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,124
This fast enough for you?

520
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,325
No, faster!

521
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,956
Faster?
Faster!

522
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,258
Hey, look, there's my dad.

523
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,427
Wave. Wave to my son.

524
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,011
Good.

525
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,764
How the hell do we
get him down from there?

526
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,312
Well, maybe nobody noticed.

527
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,723
Let's get 'em all
back in the van, huh?

528
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,103
Yeah, come on.

529
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,521
Renee wants to know, what's
that man doing way up there?

530
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,651
Man? What man?

531
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,779
Oh, he's, uh, watching.
You know, a lookout.

532
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:54,950
For what?

533
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,950
It's a shark tower.
I saw one in Florida.

534
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,952
He's looking for sharks.

535
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:04,206
Excuse me, dear, it's an
observation platform.

536
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,459
That's our chief of police,
he's just checking it.

537
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,539
That's right.

538
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,672
You see, normally it's used
for bird watching, you know?

539
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,254
Uh, weather,
uh, measurements and,

540
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,090
uh, nature observation,
that sort of thing.

541
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,390
Ellen, excuse me, uh...

542
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,594
Ellen, we're running
a little late, Ellen.

543
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,070
Well, if we can all
get back in the bus,

544
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,482
maybe we could show you the country
club and the flower shows.

545
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,356
Right. You see, uh,
the country club has...

546
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,417
Outta the water!
Outta the water now!

547
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,420
Everybody out!
Get out! Get outta there!

548
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,885
Get out!
Out of the water!

549
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,303
What the hell is
that idiot doing?

550
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,721
Everybody out!

551
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,138
Get outta there! Get out!

552
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,482
Everyone out!

553
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,904
Out of the water!
Get out! Get out!

554
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,445
Get outta the water!
Get out!

555
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,576
Get out! Get out!

556
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,169
Get out!

557
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,771
It's just blue fish.

558
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,312
Blue fish! Geez!
It's a school of blue fish.

559
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,275
It's just blue fish!

560
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,536
Martin!

561
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,680
Ellen, Ellen, Ellen.
It's all right.

562
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,830
Leave him alone.

563
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,546
Let's not make
it worse. Come on.

564
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,529
Okay, folks, it's
all over. Come on.

565
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,887
Let's get back to the truck, all right?
Let's break it up.

566
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,636
It's... It's okay.
It's just...

567
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,100
It's a false alarm!

568
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,850
It's all right, go back!

569
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,320
Oh, my God.

570
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,996
Come on, let's go. It's over.
Break it up. Come on.

571
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,268
Polly, no calls now, huh?

572
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,931
Fogarty?

573
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,651
Okay, put him on.

574
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,609
Yeah, Phil.

575
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,113
What pictures?

576
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,698
You're kidding.
I'll be right over.

577
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,285
Yeah.

578
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,039
This is the Orca.

579
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,624
Good lens, too.
Fast. One-four, I think.

580
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,268
You notice that
diffusion over there?

581
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,978
Look, Phil, don't jerk me around.
What else have you got?

582
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,346
Over here. I exposed
another bunch this morning

583
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,640
but I haven't had a chance
to develop 'em yet.

584
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,549
That's it.
That's the one.

585
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,060
Well, speak of the devil.

586
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,156
Martin, this is kind of
an official meeting.

587
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,074
Oh, good, I'm glad
you're all here.

588
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,948
I've got something to
show you. Look at this.

589
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,119
Fogarty just developed it.

590
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,573
It came out of that camera
from the missing divers.

591
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,286
Seaweed?

592
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,165
I don't know.
What is it?

593
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,468
It's underwater, isn't it'?
That's why it's so dark.

594
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,090
It's nothing I can see.

595
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,297
What are you talking about?

596
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,591
Look at this.
That's a shark!

597
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,228
Look at the outline.
Look at the mouth! The eyes!

598
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,017
Is that what it is?

599
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,974
Sorry, I just don't see it.

600
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,604
Neither do I, it's nothing.

601
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,653
Martin, it could be anything.

602
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,582
Oh, no, no, no. Waita minute.
Are you people telling me

603
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,042
I don't know what
a shark looks like?

604
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,570
Brody, this is nothing. Seaweed,
mud, something in the lens?

605
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:18,945
<i>(Lens my ass).!</i>

606
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,307
You're dammed
right it's your <i>ass!</i>

607
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,953
Now, uh, be
reasonable. Please.

608
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,375
Reasonable with what?
With him?

609
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,803
God damn it, will you
listen to the man?

610
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,329
Will you just listen to him?

611
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,755
Be reasonable?

612
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,380
Look, Brody,

613
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,379
you started a panic
on a public beach.

614
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,176
You shot up the damn place!

615
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:34,845
God knows who you
could've injured.

616
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,480
Now, what if somebody
decides to sue us?

617
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,265
Did you ever stop
to think about that?

618
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,967
It could ruin us!

619
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,278
You don't have to worry about
being sued, or being ruined.

620
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,863
If this turns out to
be what I think it is,

621
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,281
because there
won't be anybody here.

622
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,898
Yeah. Now, Martin,
let's not, uh...

623
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,317
Let's not what?
Larry, what?

624
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,565
Oh, Jesus. Larry, huh, come on?
Let's just forget it!

625
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,896
He won't listen!

626
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,623
Now, it's obvious the man
has made up his mind.

627
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,240
You bet your life
I've made up my mind.

628
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,293
But I'm telling you, and
I'm telling everybody

629
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,910
at this table that
that's a shark!

630
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,338
And I know what
a shark looks like,

631
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,659
because I've seen one up close.

632
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,299
And you'd better do
something about this one,

633
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,496
because I don't intend
to go through that hell again!

634
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,009
Martin.

635
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,337
Could you wait
here for a minute?

636
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,506
For what?

637
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,554
Please, just have a seat

638
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,144
while we look at the picture
and make up our own minds.

639
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,230
All right.

640
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,987
I'll have a seat.

641
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,615
For what it's worth.

642
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,109
Thank you.

643
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,032
Gentlemen, please.

644
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,849
Yeah!

645
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:41,006
Hey, Mike, saw your dad
over at the Town Hall.

646
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,340
I know.

647
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,972
Hey, did he really freak
out on the town beach?

648
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,765
I don't know.

649
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,268
Hey, don't worry about them,
it's all bullshit, anyway.

650
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,724
Hey, Ellen,

651
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,201
you know this is
the only dump in town

652
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,522
where the garbage man delivers?

653
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,749
Hey, does anybody wanna
go to the lighthouse?

654
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,025
Now? At night?

655
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,031
Tomorrow. Maybe
spend the day?

656
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:06,239
My dad left a couple of cases
of beer in the garage.

657
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,447
Is it Still there?

658
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,750
Well, it's kind of
vacationing on my boat.

659
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:10,951
All right!

660
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,916
Hey, Mike, you gonna go?

661
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,168
Yeah, why not?

662
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,249
Because you might be painting
toilets at the beach.

663
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,005
Very funny.

664
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,553
Hey, are we gonna have a picnic?

665
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,551
Yeah. You
bring the food.

666
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,733
Mike?
Hi.

667
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,153
I'd like to go to
the lighthouse with you.

668
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,571
Well, I'm not sure I can go.

669
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,151
I'm beached. I'm grounded-My dad
won't let me take my boat out.

670
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,992
Do you always do what
your parents tell you to?

671
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,249
No.

672
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,845
Good. Then I'll be
at the dock at 8:00.

673
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,670
8:00, everybody.

674
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,878
I don't know what I'd do.

675
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,250
Hey, what is this?

676
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,676
A wake for a funeral?

677
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,799
You surprised us.

678
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,798
Chief, I walked over as
soon <i>as</i> I heard about it.

679
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,719
They only fired me,
they didn't bury me.

680
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,346
Hello, baby, I'm home.

681
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,557
I know.

682
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,150
I know you know.

683
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,562
Listen, I got something for you.

684
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,942
This is gonna look
better on you, than on me,

685
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,616
because you're
a snappier dresser.

686
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,411
Oh, hey, you're
drinking the good stuff.

687
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:17,120
How about a toast?
A toast to the new chief.

688
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,795
Yeah.

689
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,420
Come on, Ellen, the new chief is
gonna need all the luck he can get.

690
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,835
No? Okay.

691
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,841
We'll do it together.

692
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,757
A toast to the new chief!

693
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,970
Hail to the chief.

694
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,315
Well, go on,
drink, for Christ sakes,

695
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,991
it's a milestone in your career.

696
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,158
Ease up, Martin.

697
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,611
Look, Chief,

698
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,867
not only don't I want your job,

699
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,870
but I came over to tell you that
I think you're the greatest.

700
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,041
And I...

701
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,791
Oh, Jeff, it's okay.

702
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:03,423
Come on, it's not
your fault, I know that.

703
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,181
Well, I gotta go anyway.

704
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,969
Thank you for coming by, Jeff.

705
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,739
You've really been a big help.

706
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:18,810
Thank you.

707
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,979
Good night, Jeff.
Good night.

708
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,478
Poor Hendricks.

709
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,859
They'll fire his <i>ass,</i> too.

710
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,945
You'll see.

711
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,658
Showed 'em
a picture of that shark.

712
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,032
They didn't see it.

713
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,950
They see only
what they wanna see.

714
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,918
But it's out there all right.

715
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,465
It's a big mother, too.

716
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,258
Is that why they fired you?

717
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,720
It wasn't just that.

718
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,594
Well, what was it?
The scene at the beach?

719
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,265
I was there,
I saw what happened.

720
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,594
Oh, I blew it. I blew it!

721
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,850
I shot off my mouth, I shot off my gun.

722
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,102
Four years down the drain.

723
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,029
Shot to hell.

724
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,201
What a dummy.

725
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,201
What else?

726
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,492
What else?

727
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,633
I never been fired before.

728
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,302
You know that?

729
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:40,187
I mean, once... Once when I was
17, when I was a kid, yeah,

730
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,394
but never from a real job.

731
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,434
Nobody...

732
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,195
Nobody ever told me
I couldn't hack it.

733
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,238
They're not saying that.

734
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,112
Yes, they are.

735
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,911
They are.

736
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,991
Maybe they're right.

737
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,786
I'm tired.

738
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,421
Tired.

739
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,263
Too damn tired.

740
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,771
Too damn drunk,

741
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,065
that's what you are.

742
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,102
Too dammed drunk.

743
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,034
Are you going out?
Yeah.

744
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,327
Are you going sailing?

745
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,916
Maybe.

746
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,585
Take me.
No.

747
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,625
I wanna go with you.

748
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,956
Quiet!

749
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,378
Michael!

750
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,179
All right, come on.
But be quiet.

751
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,399
Today's a better day.

752
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,860
Hello, Denise, love of my life.

753
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,576
If you're grounded, what are
we doing this for? Practice?

754
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:05,123
Yeah, practice.

755
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,759
Why are we here? Why don't
we go to the beach?

756
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,787
We can putz around, we can make
some money, pick up some girls.

757
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,558
Hey, look, if you're gonna get in
the way, you can just go home.

758
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,968
I'm not in the way.
Andy, am I in the way?

759
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,545
You're always in the way.

760
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,722
Is this guy causing you trouble?

761
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:22,383
Put me down!

762
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,026
Come on, you can
go out in my boat.

763
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,097
SEAN; Yeah!

764
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,762
You want him?
You can have him.

765
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,395
I think you just made
somebody very happy.

766
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,566
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

767
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,894
Mike, you going out?

768
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,729
Yeah. I thought you
were grounded-

769
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,613
I can go out if I want to.

770
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:38,736
You can?

771
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,071
Is there enough room
for all of us on the boat?

772
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,712
Oh, I don't know, we're a
little over-crowded <i>...</i>

773
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,660
Oh, yeah, we got plenty of room.
Here, come on aboard-

774
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:46,865
I guess so.

775
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,619
Brooke, I've got room.

776
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,128
Great.

777
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,920
You'll go with me?
Sure.

778
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,173
Thanks, guys, but I'm going with Timmy.
Come on.

779
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,088
Fantastic.

780
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,007
That's a big mistake.

781
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,370
Don't worry about it, all right?

782
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,268
Come on, you guys, I'm ready.

783
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,784
Hey, I thought you said
she was comin' with us?

784
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,310
Obviously she's not.

785
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,112
You wanna talk about it?

786
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,815
You wanna swim home?

787
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,919
Hey, Tom.

788
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,588
Hey, Nicholas, you're
supposed to be in class!

789
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,507
You dive for me.
I've got company.

790
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,551
I'm going for lobster!

791
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,128
Great! Bring me one!

792
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,305
I want mine drawn with butter.

793
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,053
You got that, Tom?

794
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:30,184
So long, turkeys.

795
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,637
Okay, Sparky's gonna
take you down today.

796
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,440
If everybody's ready,
let's buddy up and drop.

797
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,362
Get us in, for Christ sake!
Get us in!

798
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,777
Let's get him in
and keep him warm.

799
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:40,951
I think he'll be okay.

800
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,286
Okay.
Prepare the bowline.

801
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,620
Let's go!

802
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,309
Thank you.

803
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,355
So?

804
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:41,204
So I'll go down to the office, clean
out the desk, turn in the truck,

805
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:45,496
and maybe I'll get shitfaced and
rap your boss right in the mouth.

806
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,202
I think I better give notice.

807
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,504
Take it easy.
We may need the income.

808
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,341
Mike's gone.

809
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,253
He's breaking out
early these days.

810
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,963
He must be a morning man.

811
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,673
Like his father.

812
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,100
Good morning.
Hi.

813
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,397
Anything special today?

814
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:10,942
No. Sean must be out
playing somewhere.

815
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,777
Why don't you let him
have whatever he wants?

816
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:13,852
Okay.

817
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,859
Okay. Just keep him
away from the candy.

818
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,082
Am I still gonna get my ride?

819
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,153
Mmm.

820
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,670
Better call your
brother the plumber too.

821
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,617
That sink upstairs
is still screwed up.

822
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,289
Frankie? He's my cousin.

823
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,660
Ask him if he can
use an apprentice.

824
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:30,962
Have a nice day.

825
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,827
Do you wanna just leave
it pointed up like this?

826
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,575
Hold on a minute.

827
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,161
There we go.

828
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,867
Yeah, this is fine.

829
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,790
And what about sailing?

830
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,998
What about it?
Look, don't you worry.

831
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,173
We're gonna make It.

832
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:19,423
Yeah, we're gonna make it all the way
to Budapest if you're not careful.

833
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:21,220
Hey, what about the others?

834
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,638
What about them?

835
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:25,182
Look, I know the others'll
be there when we get there.

836
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,387
They'll have their bonfire and
blankets, clams, liquor...

837
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,721
Yeah?

838
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:30,896
Yeah, I suppose.

839
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,770
And what are we gonna
do in the meantime?

840
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:36,649
Well, in the meantime, we're gonna
have to think of something.

841
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,695
Wait a minute.

842
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,950
What?

843
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,657
Get out the blanket.

844
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,663
I got black and blue
marks all over my butt

845
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,040
and my mom's starting
to get uptight about it.

846
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:58,292
Okay. Out with
the blanket.

847
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:05,056
You really need a blanket, huh?
I don't need a blanket.

848
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,389
Hey, I can't come up with...

849
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,684
Or we could do something else.

850
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,060
Well.

851
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,018
Here's your blanket.

852
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,693
Eddie!

853
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,152
Help!

854
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:29,739
Eddie!

855
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,206
Tina!

856
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,282
Help me!

857
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,372
Tina.

858
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,290
Help!

859
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,110
Jesus!

860
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:08,783
Eddie, swim! Swim fast,
there's a shark, Eddie!

861
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,405
Swim!

862
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,540
Oh, God, Eddie, swim!

863
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,955
Faster! Hurry!

864
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:23,543
Come on, swim!
Come on, swim!

865
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,962
Hurry, Eddie, it's a shark!

866
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:29,219
Eddie, hurry, faster!
Come on, swim!

867
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,599
Hurry!

868
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,385
Hurry, Eddie!

869
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:38,683
Eddie!

870
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,766
Oh, Mama.

871
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,932
Please, make it go away.

872
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,565
Make it go away.

873
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,943
Make it go away!

874
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,661
Honey, it's not
your job anymore.

875
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,622
I know, I just
wanna take a look.

876
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:56,303
Come on, get outta there!
Come on, come on!

877
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,135
What happened?

878
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:32,009
Embolism. Air bubbles
in the blood.

879
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,682
He came up too fast, Chief.
He held his damn breath.

880
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,680
Something must have
scared him down there.

881
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:38,473
He just panicked.

882
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,431
Don't worry, we're taking good care of him.
Come on, Davidson.

883
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:42,686
Easy!

884
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:50,402
How did this happen?

885
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,196
Bite reflex.
Like a spasm.

886
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,573
Happened about an hour ago
right after the kids went out.

887
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,580
What kids?

888
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:01,751
Oh, Junior Vaughan, Brooke
Peters, Jackie, Mike, Andy.

889
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:02,952
Our Mike?

890
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,888
Yeah, they said they were
heading for the lighthouse.

891
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,038
Hey, where you goin'?

892
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,352
Look, Chief, you're
not chief anymore.

893
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:21,974
I can't let you take her out.

894
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,477
Mrs. Brody, look, if he
can't go then you can't go.

895
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,774
Neither one of you can go.

896
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,976
Ellen, get that line.

897
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,356
Chief, please.
Mike is out there.

898
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,154
But I've signed for the
boat. Mrs. Brody, please.

899
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,857
Aw, shit!

900
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,738
Chief, go on up to the bow.

901
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,160
You're doing all that wrong.

902
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,363
Go ahead, untie the bowline.

903
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,413
What the hell, they can't
fire both of us, right?

904
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,666
Somebody's gotta be in charge.

905
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,999
All right, which
direction you wanna go?

906
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,751
You said something
about a lighthouse.

907
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,628
- Let's go!
- All right.

908
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,812
Amity Launch
to Harbor Patrol, over.

909
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,192
This <i>is Harbor</i> Patrol.

910
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,273
Yeah, listen, Ed,

911
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,609
do you think you could
raise me a chopper?

912
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,865
<i>Is that you, Brody?
Not right away.</i>

913
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,912
<i>They're out checking
a buoy in the channel.</i>

914
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,116
I want you to get the chopper
out to the lighthouse.

915
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,872
There's some kids
day-sailing out there.

916
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,169
I want them
brought back to port.

917
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:30,748
<i>Affirmative. Turn the kids
day-sailing back to port.</i>

918
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,084
<i>I heard you.
Patrol out.</i>

919
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,128
Brody out.

920
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,723
Hurry up, suckers,
you're dragging.

921
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,770
Yeah, come on.
We're gonna lose you.

922
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:56,941
Hey, let's go
past the lighthouse.

923
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,694
I know a better spot.
Come about!

924
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:01,154
You got it!

925
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,917
I got it, Chief.

926
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:08,539
It's all right.
Come on. It's okay.

927
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,108
It's all right.
It's all right.

928
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,206
No!

929
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,664
Take it easy. Just take it easy.
You're all right.

930
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,292
You're all right. Ellen!

931
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,635
No!

932
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,508
It's all right.
It's all right.

933
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,799
It's all right.

934
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,054
Oh, Tina. Tina.

935
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,305
It's still there!

936
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,391
Tina, Tina, it's okay.

937
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,722
It's still there!

938
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,086
What's the matter? What's still there?
What's still there?

939
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,733
Shark!

940
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:42,656
Shark! Over there.

941
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,763
That boat's gonna take you in.

942
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,186
Where the hell are they?

943
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,934
About 10 degrees
off your starboard bow.

944
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,240
Take a heading
leeward of Sand Island...

945
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,686
Don't give me that shit, point!

946
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,274
There.

947
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,647
All right, I got it.

948
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,666
Mr. Christian. Mr. Christian.

949
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,630
Pump up this boat!

950
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,882
Shave off that
dreadful moustache.

951
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,972
England expects
every man to do his duty.

952
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,765
You may fire
when ready, Quigley.

953
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:53,685
Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead.

954
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:57,022
This will be our finest hour.

955
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,189
Oh, shit!

956
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,067
Hey, Bligh, someone
pop your balloon?

957
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,565
It's no problem.
No problem.

958
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,143
Balance the boat!

959
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,117
All right, all right, all right.

960
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:56,578
Watch out! Marge!

961
01:23:58,742 --> 01:23:59,914
Marge!

962
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,620
Kevin, do something!

963
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,123
Sean!

964
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,428
Timmy, Brooke!

965
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:17,269
Where is it?
Oh, I don't know.

966
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:18,391
Larry, get me outta here.

967
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,531
I'm gonna get you outta here.

968
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,898
Don't worry, I'm on my way!

969
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:23,396
Larry!

970
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,152
Turn!

971
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,741
God damn!

972
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,272
Let's get 'em outta the water.

973
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,723
Will you hurry up?
Mike's out there.

974
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,955
Hurry up.
Out of the water!

975
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,675
Somebody look out for Mike!

976
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,339
I can't feel my arms!

977
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,088
Hang on to something.

978
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,970
Mike!
Get outta there!

979
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,010
Come on, Mike!

980
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,690
Oh, my God!

981
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:06,526
Mike! Mike!

982
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,061
Brody!

983
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:09,567
Come on!
Let's hit it.

984
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:13,066
Okay, get his arms.

985
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:14,618
Oh, let's go.
Come on.

986
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,364
Get hold of his jacket.

987
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,875
Hurry up, please!

988
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,790
Get in!
Now, come on!

989
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:30,421
Come on!
Get him up!

990
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,295
Dave, help me!

991
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:12,092
He's bleeding pretty bad.

992
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,427
We gotta get Mike to a doctor!

993
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,348
Can you sail?

994
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,434
Yeah.
We'll take him in.

995
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,013
Then go for it and get
some help out here fast!

996
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,473
Let's go!

997
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,245
Okay, let's wrap this mess up!

998
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:48,128
Throw it to Brooke.

999
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:51,544
Brooke! Brooke, get this
and throw it to Marge!

1000
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:56,795
Marge, here, take it.

1001
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,298
Tie it forward around your mast.

1002
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,719
Easy.

1003
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:05,019
Let me help with that line.

1004
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,239
Come on, Larry,
pull it, come on.

1005
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:07,323
I don't know if it's gonna hold!

1006
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,816
All right!
Somebody put a fender up.

1007
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,895
I mean, we could use
another hand on this.

1008
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,150
Take it easy, just pull.

1009
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,074
Tie it off. All right.

1010
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,731
Amity Launch to Air Patrol One.

1011
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:57,531
Amity Launch to Air Patrol
One, do you read me?

1012
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,734
<i>This is Air Patrol.
Is that you, Brody?</i>

1013
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,411
Yeah. Listen, do you have
a fix on those kids yet?

1014
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,535
<i>Negative. I'm still down.</i>

1015
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,341
Well, you better get the hell up

1016
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,117
because I'm out here all alone!

1017
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,078
<i>Brody, I gotta
switch frequencies.</i>

1018
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,960
<i>Call my boss, I'll meet you
over by Francis Shoal.</i>

1019
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:15,461
<i>Harbor Air out.</i>

1020
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,757
Francis Shoal? Where the
hell is Francis Shoal?

1021
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,022
Shit!

1022
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:36,978
I'm all alone out here!

1023
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,565
Anybody wanna play charades?

1024
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,284
No.

1025
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:29,535
Listen, all we have to do is
land at Cable Junction and wait-

1026
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:31,974
Yeah, and how are we gonna do
that floating on this garbage?

1027
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:37,377
What's after Cable Junction?

1028
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,550
The Atlantic.
Then Ireland.

1029
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,927
God, I'm hungry.

1030
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,630
Air Patrol to Base.

1031
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:22,551
I have a positive location
on that sailing party.

1032
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,840
Disabled and adrift,

1033
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,220
about three quarters of a mile
west of Cable Junction.

1034
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:31,177
Wind and tide carrying
them about due East.

1035
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,314
<i>Is everybody all right?
Is anybody hurt?</i>

1036
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,526
<i>Now listen, I'm gonna give you
a tow to Cable Junction.</i>

1037
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,824
<i>Then I'm gonna call the Coast
Guard to send a cutter.</i>

1038
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,156
<i>Throw me a line!</i>

1039
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,034
Take it easy.
Here we go!

1040
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:35,824
Oh, what a day!

1041
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:36,908
Here you go!

1042
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,382
Okay!

1043
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:51,924
<i>Now hold onto something.</i>

1044
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,304
Okay.

1045
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,602
Better hang on.

1046
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:45,693
No!

1047
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,262
Bob!
Marge!

1048
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,844
Sean!

1049
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,684
Sean!

1050
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:06,561
Sean! Sean!

1051
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,527
All right,
get him up in the boat!

1052
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:11,820
Sean!

1053
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:12,943
Bob! Come on!

1054
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:14,820
Get him, Marge!
Get him!

1055
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,072
Hurry! Come on,
get him up in the boat!

1056
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:20,827
Come on!

1057
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:22,782
Come on. Come on.

1058
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,919
Will you pull me up?
I can't get up!

1059
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,006
No!

1060
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:37,172
No!

1061
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,924
No! No!

1062
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,114
Take her to the hospital and
meet me back at the office.

1063
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:46,435
On the double.

1064
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:52,313
Ellen, try to
understand my position.

1065
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,817
Tina's gonna be all right.

1066
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:55,274
Are you okay?

1067
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:59,493
Ellen, I'm sorry.
Believe me, I'm sorry.

1068
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,380
I was only thinking
of everyone's interest in...

1069
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:03,372
I don't give a damn
what you're thinking.

1070
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:07,294
All I know is a boy is dead and my
son and husband are still out there!

1071
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,927
Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.
Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.

1072
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:05,514
Amity Launch to Harbor...

1073
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:08,563
Damn! Damn it!

1074
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,065
Sean, catch the rope!

1075
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:19,820
Come on, God damn it!

1076
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,116
Come on, Sean.

1077
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:23,866
Sean, try and catch the rope!

1078
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:25,572
Sean, the rope!

1079
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:28,499
Come on, Sean!

1080
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,168
Come on, kid!

1081
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:32,336
Sean!

1082
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:33,959
Sean, catch the rope!

1083
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,290
The rope, Sean.

1084
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:37,501
Come on!
Come on, Sean!

1085
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,462
Come on, he's gotta help
or it's not gonna work.

1086
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,885
Well, will you stop?
Please.

1087
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,841
Come on, Sean, wake up!

1088
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,264
Look at us!

1089
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,642
Sean!

1090
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,103
Sean, God damn it!

1091
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:54,976
God damn it,
Sean, you look at me

1092
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,459
or I'll break your <i>ass,</i>
do you hear?

1093
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:01,987
Okay, come on. Come on.

1094
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:03,568
Okay. Okay.

1095
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:04,994
Okay, Sean, now listen.

1096
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,547
Listen now, we're gonna
throw you this rope

1097
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,824
and you damn well
better catch it. You hear?

1098
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,704
Okay, Sean, you ready?
Okay.

1099
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,831
Here it comes, kid.

1100
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:19,300
Get it, Sean!
Come on! Let's go!

1101
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,044
Sean, get it!

1102
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:24,218
Come on, get it.
Get it! Get it!

1103
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,342
Good, good. Okay, now, tie
it around the center board.

1104
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,218
Tie it tight!

1105
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:33,522
Okay, you ready?
Hold on!

1106
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:34,815
Hold onto that.

1107
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:36,076
All right. All right.
Hang on, okay?

1108
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,943
Here we go!
Hold on tight.

1109
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,616
Okay, kid, okay.

1110
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:55,040
Now take it easy.

1111
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:58,373
Come on, come on.

1112
01:37:58,456 --> 01:37:59,799
Okay, let's do it!

1113
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,091
Jesus Christ!
Get him out!

1114
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:07,803
Come on! Come on,
get him outta the water!

1115
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,651
Thank God!
You okay, kid?

1116
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,895
I thought we lost you.

1117
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:29,954
Cable Junction's ahead.

1118
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,244
Can we make it?

1119
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:33,370
I don't know!

1120
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:35,417
Hey, I was just asking!
I don't know.

1121
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,999
How's she doing?

1122
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,880
Just gotta keep her warm.

1123
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:47,505
Somebody give me a hand.

1124
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,761
We might be able
to steer this thing.

1125
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:52,094
What the hell are you guys
playing with the tiller for?

1126
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,769
I mean, at 7:46
when this tide goes...

1127
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,142
Hey, shut up!

1128
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,315
I'm sorry, Larry, I can't
stop thinking about this!

1129
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:58,437
Well, you better try!

1130
01:38:58,558 --> 01:38:59,605
Hey, come on!

1131
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:02,186
God, please help us!

1132
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,530
<i>Jesus.</i>

1133
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:08,986
Holy Mary, Mother of Christ,

1134
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:10,866
please help us.

1135
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,578
Please, help us.

1136
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,702
We're begging-

1137
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,583
Please save us.

1138
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,264
<i>Jesus.</i>

1139
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,113
Oh, thank Christ!

1140
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:38,875
Here, take that back
through to the cleat.

1141
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:45,172
What happened?

1142
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:46,249
I'm okay.

1143
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:47,375
You sure?

1144
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:50,211
A shark hit us.
Sean's out there.

1145
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:53,093
What?
He wanted to come.

1146
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:54,344
It's okay, wasn't it?

1147
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:55,637
Where are they?

1148
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:58,515
They're in the current drifting
towards Cable Junction.

1149
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:00,764
All right.

1150
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:03,033
You three get to the lighthouse
and stay there, you hear me?

1151
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:04,650
Stay there.
I'm sorry, Dad.

1152
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,411
I didn't know-That's all right.
Forget it now.

1153
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,937
Just get to the lighthouse.

1154
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:19,574
We're almost there!

1155
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:21,204
I don't think it's gonna work.

1156
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:22,706
Come on, Patrick, more to port.

1157
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:25,264
Keep it goin'! Keep it goin'! We're
gonna make it. Just keep it turning.

1158
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,585
We gotta land on it.

1159
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:27,891
Come on, more to
port, God damn it!

1160
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,041
It's all the way over.

1161
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:30,297
Shit!

1162
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:34,639
Larry! Larry, are we gonna
make it to the island?

1163
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:36,841
We're steering for it, kid.

1164
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:39,685
Yeah, but the
wind drift is lateral.

1165
01:41:40,303 --> 01:41:41,850
Oh, yeah, what does that mean?

1166
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,240
It means that
we're going sideways.

1167
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:45,075
For every yard we go that
way, we go that way a yard.

1168
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,819
But we had It. We were
heading right for it.

1169
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:48,109
We don't have it anymore.

1170
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:50,904
Shit! Shit,
shit, shit, shit!

1171
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:04,373
No, no, wait,
wait, stop paddling.

1172
01:42:04,452 --> 01:42:05,453
What about the island?

1173
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:06,537
The shark!

1174
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,152
What's happening?

1175
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:35,858
I don't know.
I think we're stuck.

1176
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,118
I think it's just the bottom.
Yeah.

1177
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:39,411
No, it's that thing.

1178
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:40,822
No, no, it's just the bottom.

1179
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:43,078
No, it's not the bottom,
it's that thing.

1180
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,660
I know it's gonna kill us!
It's gonna kill us!

1181
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:47,370
Now, I know it!
Jackie, shut up!

1182
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:48,500
No, it's gonna kill us!

1183
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:49,579
Jackie, shut up!

1184
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:51,391
That shark is gonna kill
all of us, Larry! Shut up!

1185
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,008
Oh, leave her alone!
Leave her alone!

1186
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:54,895
Then you take care of her,
you take care of her!

1187
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,021
Look, Larry, she's hysterical!

1188
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:57,522
Beating her head in is not gonna...
Sit down!

1189
01:42:57,546 --> 01:42:58,815
Knock it off, Larry.
She's crazy!

1190
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:00,011
Be quiet!

1191
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:02,806
Shut up!

1192
01:43:02,885 --> 01:43:03,885
Listen!

1193
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:04,988
I know that she
shouldn't freak out!

1194
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:06,559
Listen!

1195
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:10,985
Do you hear it?

1196
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:26,750
Over there!
It's coming towards us!

1197
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:31,709
It's Dad. It's Dad!

1198
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:40,598
Yay!

1199
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,042
Come on! Come on!

1200
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:23,966
Pull yourselves over. Gonna
get the hell out of here.

1201
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:25,426
We can't.

1202
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:26,852
We're stuck on the bottom here!

1203
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:29,639
I'll get you closer.
Then you'll come aboard.

1204
01:44:29,722 --> 01:44:31,269
Just move alongside.

1205
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:32,645
Please hurry!

1206
01:44:32,725 --> 01:44:34,227
All right, hold it steady.

1207
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:49,617
Watt! Wait! Walt!

1208
01:44:56,499 --> 01:44:57,500
Dad!

1209
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:11,013
I'm all right, hold on!

1210
01:45:20,523 --> 01:45:21,695
All right, take this!

1211
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,868
And I'll try and get you over.

1212
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:30,745
Right, tie it on!

1213
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:32,247
Okay.

1214
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:43,971
All right.

1215
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,219
Pull these hooks
over with the rope.

1216
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:48,050
And then secure
them to the raft!

1217
01:45:48,133 --> 01:45:50,636
And then I'll pull you back
with the winch. You got it?

1218
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,096
Okay!

1219
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:20,291
All right!
Now, pull it over!

1220
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,972
It's stuck!

1221
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:38,693
Wait a minute, I'll put...
I'll put it in reverse.

1222
01:47:23,604 --> 01:47:24,856
Lucy!

1223
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:27,358
Lucy! Look out!

1224
01:47:27,524 --> 01:47:29,071
Oh, my God, no!

1225
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,828
No!

1226
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:35,912
Lucy! Lucy!

1227
01:47:37,618 --> 01:47:39,712
It's all right!

1228
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:45,964
No!

1229
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:48,178
Oh, my God!

1230
01:47:49,755 --> 01:47:51,257
Dad!

1231
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:53,468
Dad!

1232
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:54,642
Hold on!

1233
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:25,215
No!

1234
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:34,509
Get away!

1235
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:36,935
No!

1236
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,398
Get away!

1237
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:54,495
Jackie! Jackie!

1238
01:49:04,288 --> 01:49:05,460
Sean!

1239
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,305
Dad!

1240
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:09,520
Where is he?

1241
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:10,946
No.

1242
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:33,044
There he is!
There he is over there!

1243
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,104
Chief!
What are you doing?

1244
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,197
What is he doing?

1245
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:55,445
Get outta there!

1246
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:58,159
Chief, he's
heading right for you!

1247
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:03,494
Watch out!

1248
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:05,076
Come on, you big bastard!

1249
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:06,744
Come on!

1250
01:51:07,536 --> 01:51:09,163
I got something for you now!

1251
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:11,498
Chief!

1252
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:15,591
That's it!
Atta boy! Come on!

1253
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,422
Right over here!

1254
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,881
Dad!

1255
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:20,761
That's it! Come on!

1256
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:23,719
Oh, no, get outta the way!

1257
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:25,145
He's coming!

1258
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:27,439
He's gonna take
hold of the wood!

1259
01:51:30,642 --> 01:51:33,065
Dad, watch out!

1260
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:34,271
Come on!

1261
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:36,106
Look out!
Come on!

1262
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,442
Come on, open wide!
Open wide!

1263
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:40,285
Say "Ah!"

1264
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:51,830
Oh, no!

1265
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:13,394
He got him!
He got him!

1266
01:52:39,086 --> 01:52:42,590
He did it! He did it!
Did you see it? He did it!

1267
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:44,892
Did you get it?
It's dead?

1268
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,268
It's dead!

1269
01:52:57,396 --> 01:53:00,149
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

1270
01:53:00,232 --> 01:53:02,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1271
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,917
And you!

1272
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,593
They made me go with 'em!

1273
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:26,512
Sure they did.
