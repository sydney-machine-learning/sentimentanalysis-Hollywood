I'm going back to Australia,
I might never see you again.

Don't- Don't talk that way, Sandy.

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,867

I've just had the best summer of my life

It isn't fair.

9
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,091
Danny, don't spoil it.

10
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,427
It's not spoiling it, Sandy,
it's only making it better.

Danny, is this the end?

You're not supposed to eat this,

Hey, that's a homemade lunch.

70
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,147
Old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

71
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,607
Sure, Putzie. She does it every year
on the first day of school.

72
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,984
Big deal.

73
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,488
- Kenickie! Over here, Kenickie.
- Kenickie.

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,658
- Hey, where you at?
- We're right here.

75
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,077
- Where were you all summer?
- What are you, my mother?

76
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,329
I'm just asking.

77
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,040
I was working, which is more than
any of youse kids can say.

78
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,624
- Working?
- That's right.

79
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,918
I was lugging boxes
at Bargain City, moron.

80
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,296
- Nice job.
- Eat me.

81
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,548
- I'm saving up to get me some wheels.
- Yeah?

82
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,175
- You wanna hear what I did?
- No.

83
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,426
Hey, there's Danny!

84
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,265
- Hey, Danny!
- Danny! Danny!

85
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,894
- Hey, hey!
- How you doing, huh?

86
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,354
Hey, Danny!

87
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,571
Hey, you seen any new broads
over there?

88
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,491
Nah, just the same old chicks
everybody's made it with.

89
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,118
Hey, so what'd you do all summer,
Danny, huh?

90
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,913
I was hanging around down the beach,
you know. You know.

91
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,916
I know what you mean, it's tough with
all those chicks hanging around you.

92
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,002
Yeah, well, the only thing that
hangs around you, Sonny, are the flies.

93
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,629
Hey, right here, Putzie, huh?

94
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,091
Hey, how was
the action at the beach, man?

95
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,467
Ooh! Ooh!

96
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,387
- It was flipping.
- Yeah? Crazy?

97
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,474
I did meet this one chick.
She was sort of cool, you know.

98
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,684
You mean she puts out?

99
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,979
Oh, come on, Sonny,
is that all you ever think about?

100
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,398
Freaking A!

101
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,069
Hey, guys, wait up.

102
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,029
Do I look okay, Frenchy?

103
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,199
- Sure, you look good.
- I'm really nervous, you know.

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,077
- You look terrific.
- So, this is Rydell?

105
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,538
Yep, you'll love it.

106
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,333
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

107
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,086
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

108
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,505
Why? You got psoriasis?

109
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,396
Oh, God.

110
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,692
Well, here we are again.

111
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,777
Yeah, but this time we're seniors.

112
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,238
And we're gonna rule the school.

113
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,285
- Jan, that is so adolescent.
- We are adolescent.

114
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,078
We don't have to flaunt it.

115
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,746
Okay, girls.

116
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,207
Let's go get 'em.

117
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,090
<i>Blanche, do you have
the new schedules?</i>

118
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,968
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

119
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,762
Oh, good, they'll be nice and smudged.

120
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,598
Oh, here we are.

121
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,309
If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

122
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,313
Blanche, these are the schedules
we couldn't find for last semester.

123
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,483
Now, maybe next year, you'll find
the ones for this semester.

124
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,159
I've got Kenickie again.

125
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,119
He's been here longer than I have.

126
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:20,165
It's the first day of school
and already my castor oil is missing.

127
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,127
How many days till Christmas vacation?

128
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,505
- Eighty-six.
- Eighty-six?

129
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,965
- I'm counting.
- Oh.

130
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,635
- May I help you, dear?
- Oh, yes, this is my first day of school.

131
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,345
I'm not really sure
where I'm supposed to be.

132
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,263
Oh, well, welcome to Rydell.

133
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,350
You'll have to fill out
a few of these forms, but...

134
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,269
Will you excuse me for a minute?
I'll be right back.

135
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,814
Oh, excuse me,
do you have a pencil, please?

136
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,275
Oh, yes, dear. There you are.

137
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,871
Jeez. Every teacher I got this year
has flunked me at least once.

138
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,122
If you don't watch it,

139
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,124
you're gonna be spending all
your time in McGee's office.

140
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,335
Yeah, well, this year she's gonna
wish she'd never seen me.

141
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,295
Oh, yeah? And what are you gonna do?

142
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,897
I just ain't gonna take any of her crap.

143
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,299
That's all,
I don't take no crap from nobody.

144
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,843
- Sonny?
- Oh, hello, ma'am.

145
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,054
Aren't you supposed to be
in Homeroom right now?

146
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,305
I was just going for a walk.

147
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,683
- You were just dawdling, weren't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

148
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,395
That is no way to start
a new semester, Mr. LaTierri.

149
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,899
Perhaps a session of
banging erasers after school

150
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,359
would put you on the right track.

151
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,694
Yes, ma'am.

152
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,737
Are you just going to
stand there all day?

153
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,864
No, ma'am. I mean, yes, ma'am.
I mean, I'm just...

154
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,033
- Well, which is it, yes or no?
- No, ma'am.

155
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,411
- Good. Then move.
- Yes, ma'am.

156
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,708
I'm sure glad you didn't take
any of her crap, Sonny.

157
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,543
You would've really told her off, huh?

158
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,671
"Mr. LaTierri. Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am."

159
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,215
- Hey, Eugene.
- How you doing?

160
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,758
Shake, buddy.

161
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,513
Hey, what's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

162
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,682
- I got astigmatism.
- Oh, too bad.

163
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,058

<i>our greatest year at Rydell.</i>

168
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,417
<i>Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire,</i>

169
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,713
<i>and I want to see all of you students
out there with plenty of support</i>

170
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,633
<i>for Coach Calhoun and the Rydell Rangers.</i>

171
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,887
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

172
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,265
<i>And now for the really good news</i>

173
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,768
<i>and probably one of the
most exciting things</i>

174
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,228
to ever happen at Rydell High.

175
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:52,067
The <i>National Bandstand</i> television show
has selected Rydell

176
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,778
as a representative American high school

177
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,782
and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

178
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,785
It is our chance to show

179
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,997
the entire nation what fine,
bright, clean-cut,

180
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,502
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

181
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,980
Hey, did you guys get a look
at Zuko this morning?

182
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,025
Looking pretty good this year, huh, Rizz?

183
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,276
That's ancient history.

184
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,838
Well, history sometimes repeats itself.

185
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,490
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi, Frenchy.

186
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,950
- Hi, French.
- Go sit down.

187
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,828
This here is Sandy Olsson.

188
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,331
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this here's Rizzo.

189
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,167
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

190
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,128
How are things down under?

191
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,879
Oh, fine, thanks.

192
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,343
- Hey, Marty, are those new glasses?
- Oh, yeah, just got them for school.

193
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,137
Don't you think
they make me look smarter?

194
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,639
Nah, you can still see your face.

195
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,142
How do you like school so far, Sandy?

196
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,977
- It's different.
- Hi, kids.

197
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,648
Patty Simcox, the bad seed
of Rydell High. Hi!

198
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,900
Oh, I just love the first day
of school, don't you?

199
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,301
It's the biggest thrill of my life.

200
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,903
Oh, you'll never guess what's happened.

201
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,029
Probably not.

202
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,031
They just announced the nominees
for Student Council

203
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,700
and guess who's up for Vice President?

204
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,994
- Who?
- Me. Isn't that the most?

205
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,538
- To say the least.
- The very least.

206
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,540
I just hope I don't make
too poor a showing.

207
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,917
Well, we certainly wish you
the best of luck, don't we, girls?

208
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,753
Yeah, sure. I've got my fingers crossed.

209
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,337
- Thank you.
- Here.

210
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,508
Oh, you must think I'm a terrible clod
for not introducing myself to your friend.

211
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,677
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

212
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,387
Welcome to Rydell.

213
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,853
Well, I hope you'll be
at cheerleader tryouts.

214
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,230
We'll have so much fun and
get to be lifelong friends.

215
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,900
You guys, how do you like Sandy, huh?

216
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,195
Do you think we could let
her in the Pink Ladies?

217
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,739
She looks too pure to be pink.

218
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,407
Oh, double doo-doo!

219
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,742
- Please.
- What's up, Doc?

220
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,870
One of my diamonds just fell
in the macaroni.

221
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,207
Hey, Kenickie, you want
a piece of salami?

222
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,709
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

223
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,711
What a stink!

224
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,671
Hey, guys. Guys, look.

225
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,927
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade!

226
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,178
Yeah.

227
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,557
Hey, look! You really put your foot
into it this time, Chisum.

228
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,101
Try hopscotch, you hot dog!

229
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,897
- What a gavone.
- Gumdrops, man.

230
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,736
Hey, any of you guys see that
new chick at registration?

231
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:45,073
Oh, she sure beats the
foam domes around here.

232
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,959
You mean her jugs were
bigger than Annette's?

233
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,285
Nobody's jugs are bigger than Annette's.

234
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,620
Right.

235
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,042
Hey, guys.

236
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,919
Hey!

237
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,756
Hi, girls.

238
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,592
- You're a sick man, Putz.
- Hey!

239
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,597
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

240
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,099
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,267
Nah, it was nothing.

242
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,644
- Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?
- Come on, Danny.

243
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,979
You got in her drawers, right?

244
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,147
Yeah, come on, come on.
Tell us about that girl.

245
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,108
What'd you do this summer, Sandy?

246
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,319
Oh, I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

247
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,155
Hauled your cookies all the way
to the beach for some guy?

248
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,283
Well, he was sort of special.

249
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,451
There ain't no such thing.

250
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,328
He was really romantic.

251
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,455
- Everything about it.
- Come on, man.

252
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,833
Come on, you don't want to hear
all the horny details.

253
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,959
Are you kidding me!

254
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,627

True love and he didn't
lay a hand on you?

317
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,509
Sounds like a creep to me.

318
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,886
Well, he wasn't. He was a gentleman.

319
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,888
Hey, what was his name?

320
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,640
Danny. Danny Zuko.

321
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,062
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

322
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,856
Well, maybe, if you believe in miracles,

323
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,567
Prince Charming
will show up again someday.

324
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,486
Somewhere unexpected.

325
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,530
See you later.

326
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,906
Come on, girls.

327
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,077
Do you really think so, Frenchy?

328
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,204
- Sure.
- Yeah?

329
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,916
Sandy, I think we ought to get to class.

330
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,772
Do the splits, give a yell!

331
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,899
Show a little spirit for old Rydell!

332
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,110
Way to go, red and white!

333
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,737
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight!

334
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,581
And now...

335
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,709
Quiet, please.

336
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,924
Quiet, everyone. And now,
boys and girls, the man of the hour.

337
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,926
The coach we're all depending on

338
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,597
to pull Rydell out of
the seven-season slump,

339
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,433
our very own Coach Calhoun.

340
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,277
Who's the best?

341
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,570
Rydell!

342
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,283
Give them hell, Rydell!

343
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,122
I just wanna tell you students that
we have a banner year coming up,

344
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,624
a banner year.

345
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,292
Because my boys are primed.

346
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,629
I mean really primed
because I primed them.

347
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,298
I mean, they're not only primed,
they're honed.

348
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,926
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

349
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,637
And we're not
just going out there to win,

350
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,223
we're going out there for glory.

351
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,141
When we get out there,

352
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:31,229
we're gonna yank them
and tear them and rip them!

353
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,232
We're gonna take them
and roll them around

354
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,484
and rip them up to pieces!

355
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,320
And then we're gonna slaughter them.

356
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,324
And after the slaughter is over,
we're gonna come back here

357
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,160
and ring that victory bell.

358
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,498
Like we always wanted to.

359
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,308
Doody! Doody!

360
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,480
Hey, Dan, watch this.

361
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,528
Do a split, give a yell,
shake a tit for old Rydell!

362
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,033
Guys.

363
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,661
Be cool, huh?

364
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,999
Hey, watch out, pinhead.

365
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,463
Well, what do you think?

366
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,216
What a hunk of junk.

367
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,219
Wait till I give it a paint job
and soup up the engine, man.

368
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,305
She's gonna run like a champ.

369
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,056
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

370
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,391
Thunder Road?

371
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,476
Yeah. You wanna
make something of it?

372
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,563
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

373
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,065
You're cruising for a bruising.

374
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,902
Hey, what're the Scorpions doing here?
This ain't their turf.

375
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,823
Think they wanna rumble?

376
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,492
Yeah, if they do,
we're gonna be ready for them.

377
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,085
All right, gang! Let's go get them!

378
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,929
Hey, chick.

379
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,723
What you doing?

380
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,268
- Oh, thanks, Frenchy.
- That's all right.

381
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,354
You know something?
You were really great out there.

382
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,272
No, I really messed up,
I was so nervous.

383
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,775
Oh, no. Your split was divoon.

384
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,444
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.

385
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,780
- We got a surprise for you.
- Surprise? What is it?

386
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,281
You'll see. Right, Rizz?

387
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,700
Hey, just let me comb
your hair down a little bit here.

388
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,285
Where are we going?

389
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,204
Want a little lipstick?

390
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,708
You know, if we fix up this car, it
could be make-out city, you know that?

391
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,961
Right, a chick is gonna have to
put out before she even gets in.

392
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,630
You'd better believe it, man.

393
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,466
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

394
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,134
Oh, yeah?

395
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,303
Yeah.

396
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,640
Sandy!

397
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,475
Danny?

398
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,145
What are you doing here? I thought
you were going back to Australia.

399
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,147
We had a change of plan.

400
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,649
I can't...

401
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,487
That's cool, baby.
I mean, you know how it is.

402
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,489
Rocking and rolling and whatnot.

403
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,325
- Danny?
- That's my name, don't wear it out.

404
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,827
What's the matter with you?

405
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,247
What's the matter with me, baby?
What's the matter with you?

406
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,335
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

407
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:45,756
Well, I do not know. I mean,
maybe there's two of us, right?

408
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:50,177
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad,

409
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,847
or try the Yellow Pages? I don't know.

410
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,269
You're a fake and a phoney
and I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

411
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,357
- I wonder if she carries silver bullets.
- Yeah.

412
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,529
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

413
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,532
Hey, I bet that's not all
she's laid on him.

414
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,702
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, Zuke! I got a car, remember?

415
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,371
- Come on, Danny.
- All right, who's got beer money?

416
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,373
- Well, I swiped my brother's ID.
- I got $2.50.

417
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,125
All right, give me that.

418
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,047
He was so nice to me this summer.

419
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,718
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

420
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,556
Listen to me. They're fleas on rats.

421
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,727
Worse than that, they're amoebas
on fleas on rats.

422
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,564
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

423
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,902
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

424
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,572
- You know what you need?
- What?

425
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,325
A night out with the girls. Huh?

426
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,579
We're having a sleepover
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

427
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,916
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

428
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,503
Hey, look, it's Jan.

429
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,756

434
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,271
Turn it off.

435
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,775
- Hey. Hey, hand me a ciggie butt.
- Oh, me, too. Over here.

436
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,236
- Hey, you want one, Sandy?
- No, thanks, I don't smoke.

437
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,322
- You don't?
- Go ahead, try it. It won't kill you.

438
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,199
Give her a Hit Parade.

439
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:43,457
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

440
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,377
Sandy, let me teach you
how to French inhale.

441
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,504
It's really cool, watch.

442
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,052
God! That is the ugliest looking
thing I ever saw.

443
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,555
Nah, the guys really go for it.

444
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,640
And that's how I got my nickname, "Frenchy".

445
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,267
Sure it is.

446
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,519
- Oh.
- Okay.

447
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,439
Okay, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party going?

448
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,902
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

449
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,530
Hey, I brought some Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

450
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,283
Twinkies and wine?
Oh, that's real class, Jan.

451
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,411
It says right here it is a dessert wine.

452
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,414
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

453
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,790
Oh, that's okay.

454
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,209
I bet you never had a drink before either.

455
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,045
Oh, yes, I did. I had some champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

456
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,922
Ring-a-ding-ding!

457
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,466
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

458
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,348
Hey, Sandy, would you like me
to pierce your ears for you?

459
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,435
Shut up!

460
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,355
- Quiet.
- Isn't that awfully dangerous?

461
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,817
Oh, no. I know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna be a beautician, you know.

462
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,486
- What's the matter? You afraid?
- No, I'm not.

463
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,363
Here, Frenchy, you can use my virgin pin.

464
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,407
Yeah, it's nice to know
it's good for something.

465
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,908
- It's perfect.
- Frenchy, I really don't think

466
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,118
it's a good idea.

467
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,412
- Oh, no, it's okay. Listen...
- My father won't like it. I promise you...

468
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,580
Ow!

469
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,875
Sandy, why don't we
go into the bathroom?

470
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,461
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood all over the carpet.

471
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,671
- What?
- It only bleeds for a second.

472
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,548
Frenchy, I don't feel very well.

473
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,425
Don't worry about it, Sandy.
If she screws up,

474
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,136
she can always fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

475
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,182
Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain.

476
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,646
Could you please get me some ice
to numb her ear lobes?

477
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,733
Why don't you just let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet?

478
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,776
Oh.

479
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,825
Personally, I'm getting rather chilly.

480
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,953
- Hey, what's that?
- From Bobby in Korea.

481
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,207
- Are you going with a Korean?
- Dummy, he's a Marine.

482
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,583
- A Marine?
- A Marine?

483
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,544
Wanna see a picture?

484
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,548
God.
You're turning into a one-woman USO.

485
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,136
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

486
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,305
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and...

487
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,184
You ain't getting your hands on my ears.

488
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,977
Oh, yeah? Well, you'll be sorry

489
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,855
because I have been accepted
to La Cafury Beauty School.

490
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,857
You mean you're dropping out of Rydell?

491
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,818
Hey, I don't look at it as dropping out.

492
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,696
I look at it
as a very strategic career move.

493
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,117
- Why's it torn in half?
- His old girlfriend was in the picture.

494
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,374
Sandy, here's your toothbrush.

495
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,461
Oh, thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

496
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,339
It's okay.

497
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,635
Miss Goody Two-Shoes

00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,232
- Come on, guys. Let's get to work.
- Yeah.

673
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,752
Hey, Zuke, man. Those Scorpions,
they're asking for it.

674
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,048
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

675
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,635
- What are you, nuts?
- Well, no. I was just thinking.

676
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,317
- Get in there. Don't think so much.
- No, that's cool, that's cool.

677
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,892
Hey, guys.

678
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,980
- Hey, Kenickie, Zuko.
- How's it hanging, huh?

679
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,983
Okay, the meeting is in session.

680
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,851
- You know what I heard?
- What?

681
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,406
Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out,

682
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,283
and everybody got hauled to the clink.

683
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,494
So? Nobody's gonna catch
Greased Lightning.

684
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,121
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

685
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,583
Somebody snaking you, Danny?

686
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,669
- Oh, bite the weenie, Rizz.
- With relish.

687
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,845
- I don't know about these chicks.
- Yeah, they're only good for one thing.

688
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,763
Then what are you
supposed to do with them

689
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,850
for the other 23 hours
and 45 minutes of the day?

690
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,102
Is that all it only takes, 15 minutes?

691
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,691
- Want some new music?
- Yeah.

692
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,985
I need some money.

693
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,697
Thanks.

694
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,372
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

695
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,296
Hi, Danny!

696
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,800
- I can't talk to you right now.
- Listen, what are you doing later?

697
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,386
- I can't talk, all right?
- Call me.

698
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,399
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi.

699
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,568
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

700
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,569
That's good.

701
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,907
Hey, Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time now.

702
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,826
- What about?
- Well, about that night at the bonfire.

703
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,412
I mean, the way I acted,
that was terrible.

704
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,165
I mean, it really was. I mean,
it wasn't me, you got to know that.

705
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,460
I mean, it was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

706
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,131
You see, Sandy, I got this image, right?
I got this...

707
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,343
Well, that's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

708
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:48,226
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

709
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,812
Jealous, are you?

710
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,483
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

711
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,693
Ha, ha, ha!

712
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,695
And what have you ever done?

713
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,410
Oh, come on!
I can run circles around those jerks.

714
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,620
I'll believe that when I see it.

715
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,231
Let's start with the first rule.
Cut it down to two packs a day, huh?

716
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,441
There we go.

717
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,239
Now, what sort of athletics
are you interested in, huh?

718
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,032
You like the rings?

719
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,910
Yeah, I installed a set of rings
just a couple of weeks ago.

720
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:54,292
Well, the first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

721
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,627
Well, I know. That's why I'm here,
you know, to change.

722
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,172
- No, I mean your clothes.
- Oh.

723
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,181
All right, let's knock it off.

724
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,100
Fellows, I wanna introduce a new man.

725
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,187
Danny. Let's give him a tryout, huh?

726
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,815
You better watch it.

727
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,902
All right, come on, come on, come on.
A little fire, come on, here we go.

728
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,361
- Come on, come on.
- Hey, Danny.

729
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,000
You have to dribble.

730
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,089
- Here you go, Coach.
- Thank you, son.

731
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,300
Now, just dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

732
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,803
- Think you can do that?
- Can I do that!

733
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,846
- Okay.
- Let's go.

734
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,765
Danny, over here. Danny!

735
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,225
Let's go.

736
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,227
- Come on, Arnold.
- Come on, get it up.

737
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,021
Get it up there. Hey, that's it.
Go, go, go.

738
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,731
Get him, Danny. Get him.

739
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:02,235
There we are. Go, go. Get him.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

740
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,738
What'd I do?

741
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,407
- Is he kidding?
- Boy, oh, boy.

742
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,913
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner.

743
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,207
Danny, Andy.

744
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,503
- Are you crazy?
- Come on, come on, come on.

745
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,256
All right, come on, let's start.
Let's get into first position.

746
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,091
Danny, you get down.

747
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,094
Okay, Andy, get down. Ready?

748
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,679
Okay?

749
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,184
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

750
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,855
Danny, you gotta try. You gotta try.
Try, come on.

751
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,398
Come on, let's get down.

752
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,359
All right, Andy, let's change positions.
You get down. Come on.

753
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,533
All right. Ready?

754
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,997
- Give?
- Yeah, I give.

755
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,206
Good.

756
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,588
He's a hitter.

757
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:10,720
I think you're gonna like baseball.
It's not that much of a contact sport.

758
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,514
Now, get in there and let's see
what you can do, all right?

759
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,433
Throw the ball. Come on. Let's play.

760
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,934
Hey, where would you like it,
huh?

761
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,895
Come on, man.
Let's pitch this guy out here.

762
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,731
- He can't hit.
- This boy can't even bat.

763
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,692
- Strike.
- See? I told you. He doesn't even swing.

764
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,738
What kind of ball player are you?
Come on. Put it in here, Pitcher.

765
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,699
Strike.

766
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,869
Come on, a little pepper, a little fire.

767
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,788
Come on, a little fire in there.
Come on, come on. Let's see you hit it.

768
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,540
Put it in, put it in, put it in.

769
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,793
Foul ball.

770
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,257
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Now! Come on! Come on!

771
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,468
Put the bat down. Put the bat down!

772
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,806
Now, there's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact at all.

773
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,351
- Oh, yeah, like what?
- Like track.

774
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,313
- What do you mean, running?
- What, you mean just like running?

775
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,524
I mean something
that needs endurance.

776
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:09,904
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

777
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,490
Cross-country running.

778
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,328
- That could be cool.
- Good.

779
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,084
Hey, cut it.
Come on, keep those legs high.

780
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,128
Take 10 laps.

781
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,564
Danny.

782
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,862
Danny, are you all right?

783
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,533
Danny, talk to me.

784
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,454
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

785
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,332
The way I treated... Sandy, I told you
I was sorry about that.

786
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,750
Got you talking.

787
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,213
- You sure you're okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

788
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,010
- So, still going out with that jockstrap?
- Well...

789
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:19,223
- Well, is he taking you to the dance?
- Well, that all depends.

790
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,850
- On what?
- On you.

791
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,435
- On me?
- Yeah.

792
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,187
He can stag it.

793
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,485
Come on.

794
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,125
Sandy, come on, let's go
someplace else tonight.

795
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,460
Why?

796
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,380
Because we can't be alone here,
that's why.

797
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,590
Danny.

798
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,968
Okay.

799
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,264
Two burgers and a moo-juice, coming up.

800
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,312
You nearly pulled my arm
out of the socket.

801
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,565
Well, I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best table they got.

802
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,692
What are you doing?

803
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,694
I just want a little privacy
for us, all right?

804
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,239
- What'll it be, kids?
- Oh, a cherry soda, please.

805
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,325
- Danny?
- Oh, I'm not very hungry.

806
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,911
Just give me a double polar burger
with everything

807
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,829
and a cherry soda with chocolate ice cream.

808
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,998
That sounds good.
I'll have the same.

809
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,209
The same? You can eat a lot, can't you?

810
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,896
- You know, you're funny.
- No, you are.

811
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,090
How you doing, Zuke, huh? Nice?
Golden glooms.

812
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,176
- Hi, Rizzo. How are you?
- Peachy keen, jelly bean.

813
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,180
Hey, you got a couple of quarters?
We can split an Eskimo Pie.

814
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,518
- My Dutch treat days are over.
- You plan on staying home a lot.

815
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,895
Hey, greetings, pals and gals.

816
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,857
Hey, I got 23 cents. Anybody wanna
chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

817
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,193
I don't know where all my money goes.

818
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,237
A dime here, 15 cents there.

819
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,571
Yeah, well, in another couple of months,

820
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,698
Frenchy here will be able
to take us all out. Huh?

821
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,408
- A working girl with income.
- Hey, that's right.

822
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,370
Well, you know, they don't pay
you very much to start off with.

823
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,080
Yeah, well, that's still more
than we make.

824
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,874
So ante up because I don't get
my allowance until Friday.

825
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,252
- What? You get an allowance?
- When I'm a good boy I do.

826
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,088
Hey, Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight
with four spoons.

827
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,049
- And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
- Hi, gang.

828
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,387
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

829
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,102
I got so many hickeys people will
think I'm a leper.

830
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,148
Hey, cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

831
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,692
"When you care enough
to send the very best."

832
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,486
You pig.

833
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,822
I love it when you talk dirty.

834
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:44,243
My parents want to invite you over to
tea on Sunday. Do you wanna come?

835
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,914
- I don't like tea.
- You don't have to drink tea.

836
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,792
Well, I don't like parents.

837
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,337
Want some?

838
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,674
You sure are a cheap date.

839
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,634
Oh, I didn't mean it the way it came out.

840
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,927
I understand.

841
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,180
I always thought you were
a very understanding person.

842
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,472
I am.

843
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:09,143
And I also think that there's
more to you than just fat.

844
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,769
Thanks.

845
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,438
You're welcome.

846
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,440
- You got a date for the dance-off?
- No.

847
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,150
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

848
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,152
Oh, no, I'm gonna be a senior forever

849
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,529
if I don't study for that dumb
algebra test tomorrow.

850
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,199
Hey, you're in luck, luscious.
You got an armed escort home.

851
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,160
It's not the arms
I'm worried about, Sonny.

852
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,870
It's the hands.

853
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,371
She loves me.

854
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,460
- Hey, you coming, French?
- Oh, I don't think so.

855
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,503
I think I'd like to hang out
a little bit longer.

856
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,796
All right.

857
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,216
I have been dieting all day long.

858
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,718
My mom's apple pie is better
than this stuff.

859
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,012
- Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.

860
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,473
- Hey, Putzie.
- Yeah?

861
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,141
Fifteen minutes.

862
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,686
You know, Danny, I'm kind of worried
about this dance-off.

863
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,064
Maybe they dance differently
than we do back home.

864
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,234
Don't worry about it.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

865
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,404
Come on, let's get out of here, Sandy.

866
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,240
Zuko, see you later, okay.

867
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,326
- Bye, Frenchy.
- See you, Sandy.

868
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,998
Great. I get stuck with the
check again. Give me money.

869
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,669
Okay, what is it, huh?
What's with you tonight?

870
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,337
You've got the personality of a wet mop.

871
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,588
Don't start with me.

872
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,008
Oh, sure, fine. Okay, eureka.
How about I finish with you, huh?

873
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,510
Finish this!

874
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,055
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

875
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,892
Sorry, French.

876
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,353
Rizzo!

877
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,359
Hey, Rizzo!
I wanna talk to you! Now!

878
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,738
No use crying over spilled milkshake.

879
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,782
Oh, I'll be okay.

880
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,369
You know it's near closing time,
don't you?

881
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,871
Do you mind if I stay around
a little longer, Vi?

882
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,707
No, suit yourself.

883
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,209
- Wow.
- What?

884
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:01,588
Well, I hate to tell you this but
your hair looks like an Easter egg.

885
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,549
Oh, yeah.

886
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,760
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.

887
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,764
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

888
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,600
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it was gonna be.

889
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,853
Oh, nothing ever is.

890
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,441
Vi?

891
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,402
I dropped out.

892
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,071
What do you think of waitressing?

893
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,198
You're too young to know.

894
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,869
Hey, maybe I could be
a telephone operator.

895
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:37,082
Nah, I don't think I would like to wear
those little things over my ears.

896
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:42,087
God, if only I could have a
guardian angel to tell me what to do.

897
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,299
You know, like Debbie Reynolds
had in Tammy

898
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,092
What do you think?

899
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,262
If you find him, give him my phone number.

- Just lower your head, Kenickie.
- What are you doing?

958
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,512
Come on, Kenickie.
Give him a break, huh?

959
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:04,224
- Oh, I'll give you a break all right.
- No, we'll work on the brakes later.

960
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,726
Move over, slick.

961
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,061
- Hey, fruitcake, you got it on backwards.
- All right.

962
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,063
What kind of car did you
swipe this from anyway?

963
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,344
- Your mother's.
- Your mother's.

964
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,026
Hey, Charlie, don't forget
the other cable, huh?

965
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,737
There's a ramp set up at the
service door for that camera.

966
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,741
Rizz.

967
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,000
Can you believe it?
We'll be on nationwide television.

968
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,923
- How you doing?
- You still gonna go to the dance?

969
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,719
Man, I'm gonna have
the hottest date there.

970
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,265
Biggest thing that ever happened to
Rydell High and we don't have dates.

971
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,267
What about Rudie from the Capri Lounge?

972
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,561
- Get serious.
- It's a suggestion.

973
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,229
Well, I already called him.

974
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,405
Relax, I think our luck is changing.

975
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,414
Do you know what you're doing?

976
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,625
What we're doing. Come on.

977
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,907
Hey, Marty, you're looking good.

978
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,285
Would you just excuse me one second?

979
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,499
You're feeling good, too, huh?

980
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,460
Sonny, there he is.
Look, that's Vince Fontaine.

981
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,504
Yeah, I've seen better heads
on a mug of beer.

982
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,340
Would you grow up?
He's the living end.

983
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,759
Yeah, if you like older guys.

984
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,357
Danny, this is so exciting.

985
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,485
Yeah, well, you see what you gotta do
is make friends with the cameraman.

986
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,155
- You know the cameraman?
- Yeah, his name's Ted.

987
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,866
Doody, how do I look?

988
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,660
Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

989
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,663
That's good. That's good.

990
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,541
You're late, fellows.
Where you been, huh?

991
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,669
- Boy, the gym never looked so good.
- Yeah, did you bring the provisions?

992
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,714
All right, kids. I want a
big circle here, a big circle.

993
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:47,012
Come on, boys and girls, we are
going on the air very shortly.

994
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,723

Here they are, the new champs.

Come on. Come on over here.

1194
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:32,605
- Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha DiGregorio and Danny Zuko.

1195
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:34,565
Cha Cha and Danny, congratulations.

1196
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:35,941
Come on, we're gonna do it now.

1197
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,235
- Where's Marty?
- Don't worry, she's in good hands.

1198
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,279
- Whose?
- I don't know.

1199
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,409
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

1200
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:51,746
- <i>♪ Blue moon
- Blue, blue, blue, blue moon ♪</i>

1205
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,814
<i>♪ Blue moon ♪</i>

1206
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,445
I wonder who that is on the right?

1207
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:25,491
We have pictures of you
so-called mooners.

1208
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,285
And just because the pictures
aren't of your faces

1209
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,329
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1210
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:34,333
<i>At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington</i>

1211
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:39,714
<i>where the FBI has experts in
this type of identification.</i>

1212
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:44,719
<i>If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.</i>

1213
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:10,035
Come on, Doody, watch your hands.
Putzie, move it out.

1214
01:19:10,036 --> 01:19:12,538
I feel like a meatball in here.

1215
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:15,207
- Okay, let's go find the chicks.
- Yeah.

1216
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,251
Marty. Marty.

1217
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,925
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

1218
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:27,094
- All right.
- I'm not hungry.

1219
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,180
- I'm not hungry.
- Hey, what's happening?

1220
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,016
There's nobody here.

1221
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:39,565
Oh, come on, Sandy. I told you
on the phone that I was sorry.

1222
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:42,902
- I know that you did.
- Well, you do believe me, don't you?

1223
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:46,280
Well, yes, but I still think
that you and Cha Cha went together.

1224
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:50,284
We did not go together, Sandy.
We just went together, that's all.

1225
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:53,871
- It's the same thing.
- No. No. No.

1226
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,938
Oh! Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry. I...

1227
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:29,573
Sandy,

1228
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:33,452
would you wear my ring?

1229
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:36,747
Oh, Danny. I don't know what to say.

1230
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:38,749
- Say "yes."
- Yes.

1231
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:46,090
Oh, Danny, this means so much to me,

1232
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,467
'cause I know now that you respect me.

1233
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,852
Hey, Rizz?

1234
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,186
Watch it.

1235
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:03,774
- What is with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.

1236
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,818
- Huh?
- I skipped a period.

1237
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,445
- You think you're PG?
- I don't know. Big deal.

1238
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:11,323
- Well, was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.

1239
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,993
Well, hey, Rizz, look...
Look, Rizz, it's okay.

1240
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,663
I caught Vince Fontaine trying to put
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

1241
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:21,041
Hey. Marty, you ain't gonna tell
nobody about this, right?

1242
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:23,794
Oh, sure, Rizz. Look, I'll take it
to the grave, okay?

1243
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:31,010
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

1244
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:36,640
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1245
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,018
Rizzo's pregnant. Don't tell anybody.

1246
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,108
Hey, Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1247
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,413
Rizzo's knocked up.

1248
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,794
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1249
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,046
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.

1250
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,131
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1251
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,967
Why didn't you tell me about it?

1252
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,011
What's it to you?

1253
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,347
I thought I might be able
to do something.

1254
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:17,973
You did enough.

1255
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:21,936
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1256
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:26,190
Hey, don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

1257
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,948
Thanks a lot, kid.

1258
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,575
Anytime.

1259
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,919
- Oh, I hope you're not getting a cold.
- Oh, no. No.

1260
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,922
It's just probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

1261
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:04,478
- Danny!
- Sandy! Oh, Sandy.

1262
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,981
- Danny, what are you doing?
- Oh, Sandy.

1263
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,774
Don't worry about it, nobody's watching.

1264
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,484
Danny, get off me!

1265
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,989
Sandy, what's the matter with you?
I thought I meant something to you.

1266
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,490
- Ugh!
- Meant something to you?

1267
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,535
You think I'm gonna stay here
with you in this... this sin wagon?

1268
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,829
You can take this... piece of tin!

01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,338
Well, the crate shaped up.

1306
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,382
And it's as hot as the parts on it.

1307
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:22,551
Hey, we didn't steal all of it.
Some of it was donated.

1308
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,387
Yeah, this baby's gonna knock them
on their ears at Thunder Road.

1309
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:27,848
You're right.
You could still change your mind.

1310
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,268
- The flag goes down in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.

Hey, Mrs. Murdock, you coming?

1312
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:36,148
I don't expect my boys to let me down,
and I won't let them down.

- That's the way!
- Way to go, Murdock!

01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:41,153
I wanna talk to you.

You know that, right?

1317
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,787
You want me to punk out?

1318
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:53,707
No, I'm not saying punking out,
but I'm just...

1319
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,793
You know what I mean. I...

1320
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:02,591
Hey, Danny, we've been friends
a long time, right?

1321
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,384
Yeah.

1322
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,555
Well, you remember the drive-in
the other night, we went

1323
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:12,017
and the movie, and it was like the duel
and the guy's best friend went with him

1324
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,145
and was like his lieutenant,
like his second, you know?

1325
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:16,772
Yeah. So?

1326
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:23,445
Well, I thought that you could maybe
be my second at Thunder Road.

1327
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,490
What do you mean? You want me
to drive with you or what?

1328
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,574
No, I...

1329
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,120
Oh. Hey, hey.

1330
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,462
Well, listen, I'll pick you up
at 3:00, huh?

1331
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:42,214
- Yeah, see you later.
- Yeah.

1332
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:45,467
Hey, open up the door.
What are you guys standing around for?

1333
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:48,512
Get that can off the front
of the car, you putz.

1334
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,853
Oh, hello, Rizz.

1335
01:27:56,854 --> 01:27:59,648
- Are you going to Thunder Road?
- Not a chance.

1336
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,900
I've got to go. I have to talk to Danny.

1337
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:05,153
Unless you got wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

1338
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:07,906
Listen, Rizz, I know that we
haven't been the best of friends,

1339
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:09,616
but if there's anything I can do...

1340
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:13,370
Oh, I can take care of myself
and anybody else who comes along.

1341
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:17,165
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

1342
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,792
Hey.

1343
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,172
Thanks.

1344
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,120

1371
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,317
That's right.

1372
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,403
Yeah, well, it takes more than a coat
of paint to make it at Thunder Road.

1373
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:34,905
- Oh, yeah?
- You guys ain't thinking

1374
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,573
about changing your mind, are you?

1375
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:39,743
- No way.
- Good, 'cause we're racing for pinks.

1376
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,077
Pinks?

1377
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:44,247
Pinks, you punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

1378
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,918
Come on, Zuke.

1379
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,421
Come on. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it, all right?

1380
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:53,423
Hey, get the dude, man.

1381
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:04,434
- What did she give him?
- A lock of hair from her chest.

1382
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,272
Poor Kenickie.

1383
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:15,654
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

1384
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,280
Give me that.

1385
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:23,119
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

1386
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,287
Yeah, well, she's gonna.

1387
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:27,165
Here, Kenickie. I brought you
a little something for good luck.

1388
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,959
- Gee, thanks.
- Oops, I'm sorry.

1389
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:31,503
Hey, don't worry about it.
Don't worry, I'll get it.

1390
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:37,842
You putz!

1391
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:41,805
Oh, here, put this under his head.

1392
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:46,142
- Zuko, he's out cold.
- What are we gonna do?

1393
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:48,687
Kenickie. Hey, talk to me, buddy, huh?

1394
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:50,772
- What?
- You okay?

1395
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:54,359
Yeah. I'm okay.

1396
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:55,694
I'm fine.

1397
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,696
- Oh, God.
- Oh, you can't drive.

1398
01:32:57,697 --> 01:33:02,325
Hey, no, really, I'm all right.
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

1399
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:06,454
Hey, you want me to drive for you, huh?

1400
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,542
Yeah.

1401
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:13,044
All right. Come on, let's help him up.

1402
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:15,213
Hey, Marty, give me a hand.

1403
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:31,730
Hey.

1404
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:34,357
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

1405
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:35,900
It's to the second bridge and back

1406
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,528
and the one who makes it here first, wins.

1407
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:41,031
Haul ass, kid.

1408
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:03,345
You ain't gonna see me for dust, Zuko.

1409
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,915
Zuke! Go! Go! Go!

1410
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:37,212
Come on, baby.

1411
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:17,103

Before the merriment of
commencement commences,

1437
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:10,300
I hope that your years with us
here at Rydell High

1438
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:13,011
have prepared you for
the challenges you face.

1439
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:17,807
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

1440
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:20,393
<i>or a Rosemary Clooney.</i>

1441
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:23,021
And among you young men,
there may be a

1442
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,733
<i>Joe DiMaggio, a President Eisenhower</i>

1443
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:29,235
<i>or even a Vice President Nixon.</i>

1444
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:34,824
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

1445
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:36,743
<i>Rydell forever.</i>

1446
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,494
<i>Bon voyage.</i>

1447
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,836
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

1448
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:29,045
How many?

1449
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:30,964
One.

1450
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:37,845
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

1451
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:41,057
- How can we flunk Phys Ed?
- Did I take Phys Ed?

1452
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,477
Step right up here!

1453
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:48,439
It's for a wonderful cause,
the Teachers' Retirement Fund.

1454
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,900
Give them a pie in the puss.

1455
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:53,820
Coach Calhoun, how could you
have flunked the T-Birds?

1456
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,989
Don't worry, you'll get your diplomas.

1457
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,991
All you have to do
is come back to summer school.

1458
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:00,034
Summer school? Look out!

1459
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:05,873
Now see, if you'd have come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

1460
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:08,418
Wise guy, huh? Take that!

1461
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,964
Why, you couldn't even pitch one inning.

1462
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:20,179
- What's your name? I want you.
- It's Eugene.

1463
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,306
- You're a great pitcher.
- Oh, thank you.

1464
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,401
Rizzo!

1465
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:35,028
Hey, Rizzo!

1466
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,864
Get off of that thing,
you got a condition.

1467
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:40,074
Forget it. It was a false alarm.

1468
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:42,035
- What?
- I'm not pregnant.

1469
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:49,333
Yeah, well, I'll make
an honest woman of you.

1470
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:52,920
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

1471
01:40:53,797 --> 01:40:55,882
That's a bona fide offer.

1472
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:58,593
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses, but...

1473
01:41:06,351 --> 01:41:08,269
Hey, there's Zuko.

1474
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:10,271
You gotta be kidding, man!

1475
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:14,108
Hey, what is this? Halloween?

1476
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:16,444
Where did you swipe
this letterman sweater, huh?

1477
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:19,155
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

1478
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,531
How do you like that?

1479
01:41:20,532 --> 01:41:23,117
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

1480
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:26,329
- That's right, I did.
- What you doing? Deserting us?

1481
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,499
Well, you guys can't follow a leader
