2
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,792
How ya doin'?

3
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:59,584
Hey, watch out, Axel. We'll be
calling him old fireballs after tonight.

4
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,084
- Fuckin' A.
- Not bad.

5
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,001
Hey, Stevie,
now that you're going to the army,

6
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,167
how about giving me
my 20 bucks back?

7
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,251
- So long, Mike.
- Take care, Mike.

8
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,209
I'll see you, fellas.

9
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,001
- Freddy!
- Hi, Mike. Be good.

10
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:27,459
- You hear about the happy Roman?
- Yeah.

11
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:30,042
- He was "glad he ate her".
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.

12
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:31,334
- Where's Stan?
- All right?

13
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,376
- Hey, Stan! Let's go!
- Take care.

14
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,126
- Nick!
- All right!

15
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:38,167
- Take care of yourself, OK?
- Bye-bye.

16
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:41,459
- So long.
- Take it easy, Mike.

17
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,501
- Don't get your ass shot off, OK? Good luck.
- Nah, I won't.

18
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:45,917
Hey!

19
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,876
Say, Mike, take care of yourself.
Good luck to you.

20
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,751
- Kill a few for me, too.
- I will. Stay out of trouble.

21
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,376
- Ax...
- Hey, little killer.

22
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,292
Stevie! Hey!

23
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,626
Hey, Axel, there's Stan.
Stanley!

24
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,626
- Stanley, you asshole.
- Hey, Stan!

25
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,126
Stan, it's no use!

26
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,626
Come on, Stosh.
You're beautiful now.

27
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,709
You're still
an ugly bastard, Stan!

28
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:14,751
- Good luck to you in the army, Mike.
- Hey, Axel. Get Stanley.

29
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,084
Come on. Come on.

30
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,167
Come on, Stosh,
get the hell out of here.

31
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,959
Come on, Stan. Let's go.

32
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,751
- Come on.
- Let's go!

33
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:29,251
Very mature. Very mature,
well-adapted individual, Stosh.

34
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,542
- Take it easy.
- Whoa.

35
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:35,376
Hey! Look at that! Whoa!
What the hell is that?

36
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,459
Where? Oh, yeah.

37
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:42,667
Holy shit. You know what that is?
Those are sun dogs.

38
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,417
What does it mean?

39
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:47,626
It means a blessing on the hunter
sent by the great wolf to his children.

40
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:51,292
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- No, it's an old Indian thing.

41
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,167
You're full of shit.

42
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,917
Stanley, would I shit you
about something like that?

43
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,251
You know, Mike,

44
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:02,209
there's times when nobody but a doctor
can understand you.

45
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,376
And that's an omen,
you know that?

46
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,626
You know that we could have
one great fucking hunting trip tonight?

47
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,792
You know, Mike, I don't know
where the hell you come up with all this shit.

48
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,084
Hey, wait a minute.

49
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,876
What, are you...? Are you thinking
of going deer hunting tonight?

50
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,084
Ah, not tonight. I'm getting married tonight.
You fucking guys would go deer hunting.

51
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,459
Hey, hey. First we get you legal.
Tuck you in bed with Angela.

52
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:28,417
You guys are all fucking nuts,
you know that?

53
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,876
- Boy, you're all crazy.
- Life is over.

54
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,917
Right. You're getting married.
We're crazy.

55
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,709
It's all right. Hey...

56
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,959
It's all right. We'll be right there.
We'll be right with you, all of us, won't we?

57
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,292
Right? Am I right?

58
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,501
- Right.
- Fuckin' A, man.

59
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,834
Come on. Come on, you guys.

60
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,959
- I'm buying the first round this morning.
- Hey, Steven! Steven!

61
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,959
Any help you might need tonight,
just feel free to call on me.

62
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,084
Oh...

63
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,584
Hey, Stanley, sometimes
your sense of humour ain't funny.

64
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,834
- Come on, Steven.
- Willing fingers.

65
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,959
Extra lips.

66
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,917
Fuckin' A, man.

67
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:04,292
- Hey, you're a regular poet, Axel.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

68
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,209
- Get in the car.
- Come on. Come on.

69
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,542
I do.

70
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:17,501
I do.

71
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,084
I do.

72
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,292
Oh, my God.

73
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:49,959
I still do not believe this.

74
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,584
My own boy
with a strange girl.

75
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,084
And not so thin,
if you understand my meaning.

76
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,417
Not such a thin girl.

77
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:01,792
The next thing you know,
he goes to Vietnam.

78
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,417
I do not understand, Father.

79
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,667
I understand nothing anymore.

80
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,292
Nothing!

81
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,792
Oh!

82
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,834
Why?

83
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,834
Can you explain?

84
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,584
Can anyone explain?

85
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,001
- Pass him on the inside.
- Oh-ho, you'd never do it.

86
00:09:57,126 --> 00:09:58,667
Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to concentrate.

87
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,251
- It's your Caddy against my truck.
- Today your lucky day?

88
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,334
You can't make it.

89
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:22,667
- Whoa! Mike!
- Hey, hey, Axel, you owe him a window.

90
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:25,751
Mike! Hey, mighty Mike!

91
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,876
- Whoa, Axel.
- Here's your truck back.

92
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,459
- Oh, hell! I hope he didn't break an axle.
- I wouldn't want to take advantage of you.

93
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:32,626
Axel!

94
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,792
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

95
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:36,667
- There's no such thing as a sure thing.
- Yeah.

96
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,709
Did you see that?

97
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,751
- Hey, Boom!
- Hey, how ya doin'?

98
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,334
Don't take anybody's money!

99
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,334
- Don't take my money. Take his money.
- Set 'em up.

100
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,417
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.

101
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:56,126
Give him a short one.

102
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,376
And give my friends down here
my warm regards.

103
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:10,167
Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles
never cross the fifty in the next half.

104
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,667
And the Steelers win by what?
Twenty!

105
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,834
I got an extra twenty says
the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!

106
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:16,959
You got it!

107
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:22,167
Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house!

108
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,626
- Oh, did I get all wet?
- No. I don't know.

109
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,126
Come on, Amy!

110
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,501
Come on!

111
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:12,334
Uh, Joe, maybe we could use
some more flags.

112
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,792
- Is that all right?
- Uh...

113
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:20,667
- Up a bit, I would say, wouldn't you say so?
- Up!

114
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,876
No, no, no, down.

115
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,792
Oh, what a beautiful cake. Here.

116
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,417
You've earned a drink.

117
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,542
You have a beautiful cake.

118
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:40,001
Here!

119
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,292
I haven't forgotten about you.

120
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,209
I have one for you, too.

121
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:13,667
Go to... fucking hell.

122
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:20,042
I'll give every car
in the town a flat tire.

123
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:23,084
- Every goddamn one.
- Oh, Daddy.

124
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,084
I'll do it!

125
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:30,667
Yeah, I fucking mean
what I say, girl.

126
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,959
Shh. Yes. Come on.

127

Ocean of flat tires.

129
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,792
- Fucking... bitch.
- No!

All bitches.

131
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,084

- Daddy.

132
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:53,751
- Daddy, no, it's me!
- Fucking bitches!

133

Is your heart so cruel,

You marry this girl,

You don't wear a scarf
with a tuxedo.

186
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,542
I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

187
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:21,501
- You trying to look like a prince?
- What do you mean, "trying"?

188
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,751
You should've done that a long time ago.
That way, it would've set.

189
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,542
I know.

190
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:31,001
- Then why didn't you do it?
- Cos I forgot.

191
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,209
Oh, man!

192
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:41,417
For Christ's sake, Mike, Steven's
getting married in a couple of hours.

193
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:44,417
I don't know what we're doing talking about
hunting a last time before the army.

194
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:48,001
The whole thing, it's crazy.

195
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,167
I'll tell you one thing.

196
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,501
If I found out my life
had to end up in the mountains,

197
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,542
I'd be all right.

198
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,542
But it has to be in your mind.

199
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,292
What?

200
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,792
One shot?

201
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,667
Two is pussy.

202
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,042
I don't think about one shot
that much anymore, Mike.

203
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:13,834
You have to think about one shot.
One shot is what it's all about.

204
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,667
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

205
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:18,126
I try to tell people that.
They don't listen.

206
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:26,459
- You really think about Vietnam?
- Yeah.

207
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,417
I don't know. I guess.

208
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:34,042
I'm thinking about the deer.
Going to Nam.

209
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,626
I like the trees, you know?

210
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,584
I like the way the trees are in the mountains,
all the different...

211
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,917
The way the trees are.

212
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:51,626
I sound like some asshole, right?

213
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,876
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy
I go hunting with, you know?

214
00:19:56,959 --> 00:20:00,084
I like a guy with quick moves and speed.
I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.

215
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,292
- Well, who's an asshole?
- Who's an asshole?

216
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,542
Who do you think's an asshole?

217
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:07,542
They're all a bunch of assholes.

218
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:11,834
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys,
but, you know, without you, I'd hunt alone.

219
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:15,459
- Seriously, that's what I'd do.
- Well, you're a fucking nut.

220
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:19,584
You know what, Mike?
You're a maniac. Control freak.

221
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,667
I just don't like no surprises.

222
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,501
- Damn thing won't open.
- Well, give it a kick.

223
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:32,167
Hey, hey, not like that. Not like that.
Not... Here, here, here.

224
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:35,334
- See that?
- Fuckin' A.

225
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,417
Unreal.

226
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:44,251
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.

227
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,876
You know, I love Mike's car.

228
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:50,292
Yeah, some cars, they just sit.

229
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,042
I mean, you never know with a car like this
where the hell it's gonna take you.

230
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:55,667
Yeah.

231
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,751
It makes me feel safe.

232
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:04,417
Oh, what is he doing?

233
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:07,542
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.

234
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,834
- Axel, get out of there.
- Let's get the carnations.

235
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:17,126
Get up. Get up.
What are you doing?

236
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:20,667
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, God, you're impossible.

237
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:24,167
- Here, put this on, you have to have that on.
- Crummy tuxedo.

238
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:28,001
The tuxedo's been stuck a million times.
Where'd you get this thing?

239
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:30,542
- Fuckin' A.
- It's not funny.

240
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,959
- I'm beautiful, right? I'm beautiful.
- No, you're not.

241
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,126
- All set.
- Thanks, Amy.

242
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,001
You can't even sit up, Axel. Oh!

243
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:49,084
Axel, come on. Sit up.

244
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,626
- Beautiful.
- You can't even sit up.

245
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:59,334
Linda, what's the matter?
I was gonna pick you up.

246
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,292
Hi.

247
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:04,001
- What's the matter?
- He hit me.

248
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:09,459
Hey, come here, come here.
I wanna ask you something.

249
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:13,459
Hey, wait a minute, goddammit.
You don't walk away from me.

250
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,001
What the hell is that on your face?

251
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:19,459
Nicky, you and Michael,
you're going away in a couple of days.

252
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:22,667
I was just wondering
if I could use this place to stay.

253
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:26,751
- Oh, sure.
- I'd wanna pay you both.

254
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:29,876
- And I was thinking...
- What are you talking about?

255
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:36,834
I would wanna pay you, Nick.

256
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:41,001
Hey, Kochatka,
it's me you're talking to.

257
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,876
You know, how long
have you known me for?

258
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,376
What?

259
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,167
I don't know.

260
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:48,167

No, you're very fancy.

You want a beer
or something like that?

344
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:29,542
- You want a beer or something?
- OK. Sure.

345
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:32,751
- What kind of beer would you like?
- What? I don't know.

346
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,084
- What kind of beer would you like?
- I don't care. Any kind.

347
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,626
- I'll get you a Rolling Rock.
- OK.

348
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,959
That's a good beer, it's the best around.

349
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,042
- Huh? Yeah, OK.
- Rolling Rock?

350
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,251

"It's only a wedding"? The guy...

Look, he did it again!
He just did it!

387
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:52,834

You punched me right there.
It hurts.

Is that better?

393
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:14,334
I'm gonna kick

396
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:21,959
A Green Beret!

397

Jerry, give the man a drink.

- Hey!
- Give him a drink! Sir!

401
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,001
- Sir!
- Sir!

402
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:47,959
- Don't cause any kind of problem, huh?
- Nah, I wanna talk to the man.

403
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:50,959
I wanna talk to the man.
We're going over there.

404
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:53,209
Sir, Mike Vronsky.

405
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:57,667
Nick.

406
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:00,959
- This is the groom, Steve.
- I'm the best man.

407
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:04,834
We're going airborne, sir.
What's it like?

408
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,959
I hope they send us
where the bullets are flying.

409
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,459
- Fighting's the worst, huh?
- That's right.

410
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,417
Fuck it.

411
00:43:13,376 --> 00:43:15,792
- Fuck it? What did he say?
- Fuck it.

412
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:17,834
Fuck it.
That's what I thought.

413
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,834
Well, what's it like over there?

414
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,626
Can you tell us anything?

415
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:27,667
Fuck it.

416
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:30,709
OK, fuck it.

417
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,501
Fuck him.

418
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,417
Fuck it. Hey!

419
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:42,917
Michael, hey.

420
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,084
- Hey.
- Fuck who?

421
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:49,667
Fuck who?

422
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:53,209
- Who the hell is he?
- Who the fuck knows?

423
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:54,917
He looks like a fucking hillbilly.

424
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:58,209
Give him another drink, Jerry.
Just the same.

425
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:00,709
Hey! Fuck it!

426
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:02,917
Fuck you.

427
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:06,667
Hey!

428
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,459
Hey!

Hey!

431
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:34,501
- Steven.
- Hey!

432
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,334
Hey!

433
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:42,584
Hey!

434
00:44:43,084 --> 00:44:44,667
Hey!

435
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:03,334
Hey!

436
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:05,751
Hey!

437
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:16,209
Hey!

438
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:18,251
Hey!

439
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:21,209
Hey!

440
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:36,751
I got it!

441
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:44,084
Will you marry me?

442
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:46,959
Yeah.

443
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,084
You would?

444
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:53,334
Mm-hmm.

445
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,709
What I mean is,
if we get back from...

446
00:45:57,376 --> 00:45:59,167
I mean, when we get back.

447
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,417
I don't know what the hell I mean.

448
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:05,084
I think what goes through your mind
comes out your mouth.

449
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,709
Angela and Steven,

450
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,459
if you don't spill a drop,

451
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,792
it's good luck
for the rest of your life.

452
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:35,376
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

453
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,584
Whoo!

454
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,459
Don't worry what Stan says.
Just forget that. Forget what Stan says.

455
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:44,167
- He's got a big fucking mouth.
- Right.

456
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:46,209
- Huh?
- That's enough.

457
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:48,209
- Hey!
- OK. Come here.

458
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:51,126
I never really did it with Angela, Nicky.

459
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:57,251
Great. That's great.

460
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:01,542
That's my last one true secret.

461
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:04,167
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Just forget about it.

462
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:07,042
Angela, Angela!

463
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:11,959
Oh, Angela.

464
00:49:12,084 --> 00:49:13,792
What am I gonna do
when she has a baby?

465
00:49:13,876 --> 00:49:15,834
That's Angela's part, right?
Leave all that to Angela.

466
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,542
- That's right.
- Hang loose.

467
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:20,001
- Hang loose?
- Hang loose. Be happy.

468
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:22,917
Go on. Get out of here.
We don't wanna see you anymore.

469
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,834
Look at this maniac.

470
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:29,209
I'll see you Monday on the train.

471
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:31,001
Hey.

472
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:32,792
Drive carefully.

473
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:35,376
You didn't know that about Angela, huh?

474
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:37,459
- Right?
- Oh, that's bullshit.

475
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,792
- Oh, it's bullshit, right? Yeah?
- Bullshit. Bullshit.

476
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,501
- I happen to know it's true.
- That's bullshit.

477
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:43,667
- I happen to know it's true.
- You're full of bullshit.

478
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:45,251
- Do you wanna bet?
- Yeah.

479
00:49:45,334 --> 00:49:46,834
Put your money where your mouth is.

480
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:49,084
- Go fuck yourself, Stan. Fuck you.
- Huh? Go fuck yourself.

481
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,876
Ah, grow up.

482
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:55,167
Hey! Hey!

483
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,834
All right!

484
00:50:09,084 --> 00:50:10,584
Michael!

485
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,501
Michael, what are you doing?

486
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:15,501
- Hey, Mike!

488
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:20,917
Michael,
what the hell are you doing?

489
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:24,126
- Michael!
- Hey!

490
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:27,376
Michael, what the hell
are you doing? Michael!

491
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,917
- Hey, Michael!
- Fuck it!

492
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:32,251
Michael, come back here!

493
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:35,751
What the hell is he doing?

494
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:38,459
- Michael, what the hell are you doing?
- Hey, Mike!

495
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:41,751
Michael, come back here!
Come here, Michael!

496
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:44,209
Michael, you know we love you!
Get back here!

497
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,917
Get back!

498
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,334
I gotta talk to you!

499
00:50:58,334 --> 00:51:00,251
Mike!

500
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:09,167
Hey!

501
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:35,876
Shit!

502
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:41,084
I must be out of my fucking mind.

503
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:43,792
I must be out of my mind.

504
00:51:48,376 --> 00:51:51,042
I don't know.
Everything's going so fast.

505
00:51:51,126 --> 00:51:53,542
Man, oh, man.

506
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:56,126
Hey, Nick.

507
00:51:58,334 --> 00:52:00,834
Think we'll ever come back?

508
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,709
- From Nam?
- Yeah.

509
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,584
You know something?

510
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,667
The whole thing, it's right here.

511
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:15,584
I love this fucking place.

512
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,667
- You're crazy, man.
- I know that sounds crazy.

513
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:21,917
If anything happens, Mike,
don't leave me over there.

514
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:24,751
You got... You gotta...
Just don't leave me.

515
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:27,542
- You gotta promise me that, Mike.
- Hey.

516
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:31,376
No, man, you got...
you gotta...

Fucking cold.

535
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:25,626
Thirty-six beers. Whoo!

536
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:27,876
- What?
- Come on.

537
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,792
All right,
I'll go on, already.

538
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:31,667
Wait, wait.

539
00:54:36,251 --> 00:54:40,876
You ever piss and take a drink of beer
at the same time?

540
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:46,501
Whoa.

541
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:51,834
Ah, I just barely
got a chance to shake it off.

Wait! Come on!
Oh, fuck!

543
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:59,126
Bastards!

544
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,792
Sons of bitches!

545
00:55:38,542 --> 00:55:41,042
- You guys going my way?
- Come on.

546
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:49,042
Fuck!

547
00:55:52,876 --> 00:55:55,042
That's not funny!

548
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,959
No fucking around now.

549
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,251
Come on. Stick around.
Don't fuck around.

550
00:56:22,376 --> 00:56:24,417
All right?
Don't fuck around.

551
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,001
- Let me out!
- Out, out.

552
00:56:54,084 --> 00:56:56,292
- Let me out!
- Get out.

553
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,459
This is not it. Definitely.
This is not it.

554
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:06,084
- They changed it. Somehow they changed it.
- No kidding.

555
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:10,709
- Like this happens every goddamn year.
- You're full of shit, Stanley.

556
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:13,459
- Who did you say was full of shit?
- You're full of shit.

557
00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:17,167
- You're always full of shit.
- I'm starving.

558
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:18,417
Eat that!

559
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:22,042
Nick, how come
I never see you eating?

560
00:57:22,126 --> 00:57:25,334
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

561
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:27,459
It ain't natural.
Come on, John.

562
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,459
Hey! Hey, that's mine.

563
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:32,042
- You really want it that bad?
- You're goddamn right.

564
00:57:32,126 --> 00:57:36,501
- Hey, give me a Twinkie, Mike.
- What are you guys, a bunch of cripples?

565
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:46,626
- That's mustard!
- What?

566
00:57:47,709 --> 00:57:50,834
He put mustard on his Twink...

567
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:53,584
You're talking like
a goddamn traffic cop.

568
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:56,501
- Incredible.
- Come on. Give me a beer, Mike.

569
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:59,667
- Come on. Come on.
- I can't believe you guys.

570
00:57:59,751 --> 00:58:02,417
- What the hell am I doing with you?
- This is not it.

571
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:05,126
They changed it.
Somehow they changed it.

572
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:08,459
You couldn't find your own ass
with two hands.

573
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:09,626
Fuckin' A.

574
00:58:09,709 --> 00:58:13,834
Hey, you know, we forgot
to toast Steven and Angela.

575
00:58:15,126 --> 00:58:16,709
Steven and Angela!

576
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:24,209
What?

577
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:30,334
Don't make me laugh
when I have things in my mouth.

578
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:33,167
I can't take you guys anyplace.
What the hell are you doing?

579
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:35,459
Get your hands
off the fucking bread.

580
00:58:35,584 --> 00:58:37,667
You can dress 'em up,
but you can't take 'em anywhere.

581
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:39,917
Oh, come on.
Come on!

582
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:43,001
What the fuck are you doing?
That was mine, you assholes.

583
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:44,584
Fuckin' A!

584
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:50,876
Fucking assholes.
I can't fucking...

585
00:58:52,084 --> 00:58:54,501
- What am I...?
- Fuckin' A!

586
00:58:54,584 --> 00:58:57,292
You know, Axel,
you got a really terrific vocabulary.

587
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:58,709
Fuckin' A.

588
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:00,667
Hey, watch the gear.
Watch the rifle.

589
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:02,917
Axel, gimme my bag.

590
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,501
It's getting cold, huh?

591
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:11,917
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

592
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,542
Here we go.

593
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:21,709
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

594
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:25,126
Never mind. I got 'em.

595
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:28,251
Where the hell's my boots?

596
00:59:31,376 --> 00:59:33,667
Anybody see my boots?

597
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:35,376
Somebody took my boots.

598
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:38,084
I bought 'em special.

599
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:43,001
All right. All right, you guys.
Whoever took my boots, I want 'em back.

600
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:46,542
I got a boot for you, Stan,
right up your ass.

601
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,167
Hey, Mike.

602
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:53,834
Hey, Mike, let me borrow
your spares, huh?

603
00:59:53,959 --> 00:59:55,917
- Your extra pair?
- No, Stan.

604
00:59:57,792 --> 00:59:59,209
No?

605
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:04,417
- What do you mean, "no"?
- Just what I said. No. No means no.

606
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:09,417
Some fucking friend.
You're some fucking friend, you know that?

607
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:12,834
You gotta learn. Every time you come here,
you got your head up your ass.

608
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:16,292
Maybe he likes the view from up there.

609
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,376
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife, he's got no jacket,

610
01:00:23,459 --> 01:00:25,876
he's got no pants, he's got no boots.

611
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:29,376
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries around like John Wayne.

612
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,334
That ain't gonna help you.

613
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:34,292
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

614
01:00:34,376 --> 01:00:38,876
No way, I ain't giving him no boots.
No more. No more. That's it.

615
01:00:38,959 --> 01:00:42,292
You're a fucking bastard,
you know that? Huh?

616
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:44,459
Stanley, see this?
This is this.

617
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:47,584
This ain't something else.
This is this.

618
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:50,417
From now on, you're on your own.

619
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:56,209
I fixed you up a million times.

620
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:59,001
I fixed him up a million times.

621
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:01,459
I don't know how many times
I must've fixed him up with girls.

622
01:01:01,584 --> 01:01:04,167
And nothing ever happened. Zero.

623
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:05,626
You know your trouble, Mike, huh?

624
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:07,542
Nobody ever knows
what you're talking about.

625
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,126
"This is this."

626
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:11,626
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
"This is this."

627
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,417
Is that faggot-sounding bullshit,
or is that faggot-sounding...

628
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:16,542
Shut up, Stan, will you?

629
01:01:16,626 --> 01:01:18,001
Hey, man, you're outta line.

630
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:21,001
- Watch out with that gun, Stan.
- Do you know what I think?

631
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:22,334
You know what I think?

632
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,959
There's times I swear
I think you're a fucking faggot.

633
01:01:25,084 --> 01:01:26,584
Hey, come on, you guys.

634
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:29,959
Last week he could've had that new
redheaded waitress at the Bowladrome.

635
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:32,459
He could've had it knocked,
and look what he did.

636
01:01:32,584 --> 01:01:35,001
Nothing! That's what.

637
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:38,251
Shut up, Stan, huh?
Just shut up!

638
01:01:38,334 --> 01:01:42,542
Just shut up. Take...
Take Michael's goddamn boots and shut up.

639
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:43,959
Otherwise, I'm going home.

640
01:01:44,084 --> 01:01:46,292
Yeah, I'm going home right now.

641
01:01:46,376 --> 01:01:49,917
Get off my stuff.
What the hell are you doing?

642
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,417
Hey, Stosh.

643
01:01:54,459 --> 01:01:56,292
I said "no".

644
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:03,542
What, are you gonna shoot me?

645
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:05,167
Huh?

646
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:07,209
Here.

647
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:28,292
What's the matter with you?

648
01:02:30,626 --> 01:02:32,084
Stan.

649
01:05:44,126 --> 01:05:47,167
Watch it, Mike! Pow! Whack!

650
01:05:52,876 --> 01:05:56,501

01:15:32,626 --> 01:15:34,501
I'm OK.

688
01:16:01,626 --> 01:16:04,292
Easy. That's all right.
OK. OK.

689
01:16:05,084 --> 01:16:07,751
All right, press hard.
Press hard. Press hard.

690
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:09,751
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

691
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:13,126
Go ahead. That's it.
That's it.

692
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:14,834
Mike?

693
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:22,459
Shake it off. Shake it off.
Shake it out.

694
01:16:23,084 --> 01:16:24,876
Think of something else.

695
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,542
Think of home. Think of home.

696
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:16,167
- Come on.
- They're gonna have to kill my ass, Mike.

697
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,042
Stevie, you gotta do it.

698
01:17:20,126 --> 01:17:23,292
You don't do it,
they're gonna throw you in a pit.

699
01:17:23,376 --> 01:17:24,959
They throw you in a pit,
you're gonna die.

700
01:17:25,084 --> 01:17:28,209
Go ahead. You gotta do it.
You can do it.

701
01:17:28,334 --> 01:17:30,959
You can do it, Stevie.
You can do it.

702
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:38,542
Look in my eyes.

703
01:17:38,626 --> 01:17:40,459
Stevie?
Stevie, look at me!

704
01:17:41,209 --> 01:17:43,209
- Mike?
- Do it!

705
01:17:43,334 --> 01:17:46,584
Go ahead. Show 'em you got balls.
Show 'em you got balls.

706
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:48,501
Aw, fuck you.

707
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:52,876
Go ahead. Shoot me! Go ahead!

708
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,667
Come on.

709
01:18:02,084 --> 01:18:03,834
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Stevie!

710
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:07,001
Go ahead! Show 'em you got balls!
Go ahead!

711
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:23,959
Hey, kid. Kid.

712
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:25,542
Kid.

713
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,334
Look at me, Stevie. You did it.

714
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:32,834
Stevie.

715
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,917
You showed these bastards.
Showed 'em.

716
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:50,667
Don't worry, kid.

717
01:18:52,376 --> 01:18:53,376
You did it.

718
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:11,751
Michael!

719
01:19:12,626 --> 01:19:14,626
- Michael!
- Stevie!

720
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:24,584
Michael!

721
01:19:25,209 --> 01:19:27,167
Michael!

722
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:35,292
Stevie!
Stevie, don't worry!

723
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:37,251
Michael!

724
01:19:38,084 --> 01:19:40,001
Michael!

725
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:42,042
Oh, God.

726
01:19:42,126 --> 01:19:44,834
Michael, there's rats in here.

727
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:06,959
Nicky...

728
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:16,417
Motherfucker!

729
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:18,792
Motherfucker!

730
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:22,251
Nicky, listen.

731
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:27,876
It's up to us now.

732
01:20:28,001 --> 01:20:29,959
It's me and you.

733
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:32,959
- What about Steven?
- Forget him.

734
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:36,459
- Forget him?
- Forget him. He ain't gonna make it.

735
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:39,834
Who do you think you are?
God?

736
01:20:42,126 --> 01:20:43,959
Look at him.
He's in a daze.

737
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:47,626
He ain't coming out.
He's in a dream.

738
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,417
- Mike, what are you saying?
- I'm saying forget him, Nick.

739
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:54,084
Get it through your head,
or you and me are both gone, too.

740
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:04,751
We gotta play with more bullets.

741
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:06,334
- What?
- More bullets.

742
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:11,667
I gotta get more bullets
in the gun.

743
01:21:13,084 --> 01:21:15,334
- What?
- We gotta play with more bullets.

744
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:17,376
- More bullets in the gun?
- More bullets in the gun.

745
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:19,376
How many more bullets?

746
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,709
Three.

747
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:33,459
That means we gotta play each other.

748
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:36,042
More bullets against each oth...
What? Are you crazy?

749
01:21:36,126 --> 01:21:38,042
Nicky, it's the only way.

750
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:44,834
I'll pick the moment.
The game goes until I move.

751
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:47,126
When I start shooting,
you go for the nearest guard.

752
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:49,376
You get his gun and zap the fucker.

753
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:52,459
- I'm not ready for this.
- You gotta listen to me.

754
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:54,709
You wanna stay
down here and die?

755
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:59,251
Go on.
It's up to you.

756
01:21:59,334 --> 01:22:01,501
- Now it's up to you.
- No!

757
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,167
- No!
- Hey, him against me!

758
01:22:07,084 --> 01:22:09,709
Get away! Get away!

759
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,667
- Man, get away.
- Me against him!

760
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:15,626
Michael!

761
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:18,376
Michael!

762
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:57,209
Come on!

763
01:22:57,334 --> 01:23:00,417
These fuckers, these fuckers...
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, Nicky.

764
01:23:01,292 --> 01:23:03,417
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

765
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:05,792
Go ahead. Go ahead, Nicky.

766
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:24,834
I do three bullets.
Three.

767
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,084
Three. We do three, huh?

768
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:28,917
One, two, three.
Three.

769
01:23:39,792 --> 01:23:41,751
Three. Three.

770
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:49,876
Three. Three.

771
01:23:53,084 --> 01:23:56,959
Don't worry. Five minutes,
we're gonna be outta here.

772
01:23:57,042 --> 01:23:58,584
We're gonna be outta here.

773
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:02,876
Yeah.

774
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:10,584
Now we got ourselves a game.

775
01:24:10,667 --> 01:24:12,417
You and me.
You and me.

776
01:24:12,501 --> 01:24:14,334
Now we got ourselves
a real game.

777
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:39,126
OK. You wanna see it?
All right.

778
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:44,917
There.

779
01:24:55,834 --> 01:24:58,501
No more. No. No more.

780
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,584
I'm gonna will us out of here.

781
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:08,542
You got an empty chamber in that gun.
Put an empty chamber in that gun!

782
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:10,709
Go ahead.

783
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,167
Goddammit!

784
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:22,126
It's gonna be all right, Nicky.
Go ahead, shoot!

785
01:25:22,876 --> 01:25:24,126
Shoot, Nicky!

786
01:25:24,209 --> 01:25:26,584
God damn you,
you motherfucker!

787
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,376
You motherf...

788
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:31,751
No, no, no, no, Nicky!

789
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:34,751
Oh! You cock...

790
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:38,417
Oh! Oh, you're gonna die,
you motherfucker!

791
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:39,751
You're gonna die!

792
01:25:41,792 --> 01:25:44,584
Go ahead. Go ahead, Nicky.
Go ahead, just do it.

793
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:47,001
Do it.
Do it! Do it!

794
01:25:47,126 --> 01:25:49,084
Go ahead!

795
01:25:54,834 --> 01:25:56,376
You made it.
You made it.

796
01:26:01,792 --> 01:26:04,667
It's all right, Nicky.
All right, we're gonna show 'em.

797
01:26:09,542 --> 01:26:11,084
That's good, Nicky.

798
01:26:15,959 --> 01:26:17,751
All right.

799
01:26:17,834 --> 01:26:19,001
All right.

800
01:26:57,501 --> 01:27:00,084
Come on. Come on.

801
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:01,209
Come on!

802
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:07,501
Nicky! Come on, dammit!

803
01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:09,251
Come on!

804
01:27:13,709 --> 01:27:14,876
Shit.

805
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:20,376
Get me up.

806
01:27:23,126 --> 01:27:25,042
Steve!

807
01:27:29,251 --> 01:27:30,501
Get up.

808
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:32,917
Get up!

809
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:38,292
Michael. Michael.

810
01:27:39,917 --> 01:27:41,667
Michael!

811
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:47,959
Stevie, come on.
Come on, Stevie.

812
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:49,542
We're gonna go for a swim.
Come on.

813
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:51,001
Stevie.

814
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,251
Come on.

815
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:56,751
Hey, come on.

816
01:27:57,376 --> 01:28:00,584
We don't belong here
in the jungle, Michael.

817
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:04,792
Get on. Go on.
Just get on, see?

818
01:28:04,876 --> 01:28:06,876
Just there. Just get on.

819
01:28:06,959 --> 01:28:10,001
There's rats in these waters.

820
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:12,792
Hold on.

821
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:14,751
Hold on right there.

822
01:28:14,834 --> 01:28:16,626
Hold on.

823
01:28:32,501 --> 01:28:34,417
- Michael.
- OK, buddy.

824
01:28:40,751 --> 01:28:42,501
Mike.

825
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:49,126
Nicky!

826
01:29:12,834 --> 01:29:15,251
Mike!

827
01:29:16,334 --> 01:29:18,501
I wanna go home, Mike.

828
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:23,292
What is that sound?

829
01:30:24,876 --> 01:30:27,126
What's that sound, Michael?

830
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:42,251
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

831
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:45,792
Hey!

832
01:31:53,251 --> 01:31:55,001
Go on! Go ahead!

833
01:31:55,084 --> 01:31:57,167
Mike! Mike!

834
01:31:57,292 --> 01:32:00,251
Hold on, Michael! Don't let go!

835
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:04,292
Mike!

836
01:32:49,501 --> 01:32:51,334
Stevie!

837
01:33:14,751 --> 01:33:17,501
I hit some rocks, Michael.

838
01:33:17,584 --> 01:33:20,292
- I hit some rocks.
- Are you all right?

839
01:33:20,376 --> 01:33:22,334
- Michael.
- OK.

840
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:23,959
My legs...

841
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:27,834
Come on. Come on.

842
01:33:29,084 --> 01:33:32,126
Stevie, come on.

843
01:33:32,209 --> 01:33:34,417
Michael, please.

844
01:33:38,376 --> 01:33:40,459
M... Mike...

845
01:33:40,542 --> 01:33:42,626
I hit some rocks.

846
01:33:43,626 --> 01:33:45,917
OK. All right.

847
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:52,834
That's it.

848
01:33:52,959 --> 01:33:55,417
- That's it.
- My arm. My arm.

849
01:33:57,334 --> 01:34:00,834
I can't... I can't feel my legs.

850
01:34:01,917 --> 01:34:04,209
All right.
All right, come on.

851
01:34:07,126 --> 01:34:08,584
My arm!

852
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:15,667
Push yourself up.

853
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:30,417
Shh!

854
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:36,792
OK. OK, kid. OK.

855
01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:38,626
Shh! Shh!

856
01:37:03,126 --> 01:37:04,667
Hi.

857
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:10,001
Hi.

858
01:38:17,709 --> 01:38:19,126
Ah.

859
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:27,001
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

860
01:38:29,584 --> 01:38:31,042
Can you understand me, Nikanor?

861
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:37,376
Excuse me?

862
01:38:37,459 --> 01:38:39,667
- Are you Chevotarevich? Are you sure?
- Yes.

863
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:43,834
Uh-huh. Chevotarevich.
Is that a Russian name?

864
01:38:47,209 --> 01:38:49,584
No. It's American.

865
01:38:50,417 --> 01:38:52,251
All right.
Let me see your name tag.

866
01:38:54,667 --> 01:38:56,626
This yours?

867
01:38:57,459 --> 01:38:58,459
It's his.

868
01:38:59,251 --> 01:39:01,459
What are your parents' names?

869
01:39:01,542 --> 01:39:04,292
Lou. And, uh...

870
01:39:04,417 --> 01:39:06,792
My mother's name is, uh...

871
01:39:09,501 --> 01:39:12,209
- Eva.
- Uh-huh.

872
01:39:12,292 --> 01:39:15,001
And what are your parents'
dates of birth?

873
01:39:22,584 --> 01:39:24,917
What the...?

874
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:04,001
We're gonna have to
get him outta here.

875
01:40:32,834 --> 01:40:34,751
Sure, sure.

876
01:40:34,834 --> 01:40:37,626
What's the other one,
the extension for it?

877
01:40:37,709 --> 01:40:39,126
Excuse me.

878
01:40:43,584 --> 01:40:45,417
Some more noise, uh-huh.

879
01:40:45,501 --> 01:40:48,126
Hello?

880
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,917
Uh, I'm calling the United States.

881
01:40:54,959 --> 01:40:57,959
Clairton, Pennsylvania.

882
01:41:00,084 --> 01:41:04,209
Clair... C-L-A...

883
01:41:05,251 --> 01:41:08,917
I- R-T-O-N.

884
01:41:09,001 --> 01:41:11,584
Pennsylvania. Right.

885
01:41:12,917 --> 01:41:15,292
Yeah. Yeah, OK.

886
01:41:19,209 --> 01:41:21,959
Never mind.

887
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,917
Nothing, nothing.
No. Never mind. Nothing.

888
01:41:34,667 --> 01:41:37,126
Hey, back off, Jack!

889
01:41:37,209 --> 01:41:38,709
- Back off.
- Yeah.

890
01:41:39,542 --> 01:41:40,751
Well, just do that.

891
01:42:26,584 --> 01:42:28,584
Mike?

892
01:42:28,667 --> 01:42:31,209
Hello. How are you?

893
01:42:31,292 --> 01:42:32,626
- Hey.
- Mike?

894
01:42:35,292 --> 01:42:38,209
Mike? Hey, Mike.

895
01:42:39,584 --> 01:42:42,959

I gotta get an elephant.

No!

931
01:45:03,917 --> 01:45:06,209
I can't stay here in a room

01:45:06,292 --> 01:45:08,459
- Come on.
- No. No!

933
01:45:08,542 --> 01:45:10,376

People inside
doing it for money?

945
01:46:52,126 --> 01:46:54,709
Sometime a great deal of money.

946
01:46:54,834 --> 01:46:57,501
I cannot play
this kind of game myself.

947
01:46:57,626 --> 01:47:01,042
But I'm always...
How do you say?

948
01:47:01,126 --> 01:47:05,751
Looking out for those things
quite different, quite rare.

949
01:47:09,042 --> 01:47:10,251
Champagne, perhaps?

950
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:12,251
No.

951
01:47:12,876 --> 01:47:15,376
Don't say no.

952
01:47:16,251 --> 01:47:19,876
When a man say no to champagne,
he say no to life.

953
01:47:25,042 --> 01:47:27,126
You saw this before?

954
01:47:30,501 --> 01:47:31,667
Up north.

955
01:47:32,292 --> 01:47:34,042
Oh, yes. Of course.

956
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:35,792
Gotta go.

957
01:47:36,417 --> 01:47:38,459
But you must come in.

958
01:47:40,126 --> 01:47:42,042
I insist.

959
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:47,626
Of what is there to be afraid of
after this war?

960
01:47:47,709 --> 01:47:49,167
War is a joke.

961
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:51,834
- A silly thing.
- I'm going home, ace!

962
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:54,959
<i>Naturellement I pay my players...</i>

963
01:47:55,042 --> 01:47:57,209
cash, American.

964
01:47:58,251 --> 01:48:03,584
However, should you prefer German marks
or perhaps Swiss franc,

965
01:48:03,667 --> 01:48:05,167
that, of course,
can be arranged.

966
01:48:05,292 --> 01:48:08,126
- I can arrange everything.
- You got the wrong guy, ace.

967
01:48:08,251 --> 01:48:10,542
- But you must come in.
- Don't do that.

968
01:48:10,626 --> 01:48:12,417
But I insist.

969
01:49:32,042 --> 01:49:33,167
Nick!

970
01:49:55,042 --> 01:49:56,084
Hey, Nick!

971
01:50:20,584 --> 01:50:23,459
Hey! Nick! Nick!

972
01:50:25,709 --> 01:50:29,084
- Listen, if you are very brave and lucky...
- Hey, Nick!

973
01:50:29,167 --> 01:50:31,751
...I can make you very, very rich.

974
01:51:09,167 --> 01:51:11,751
Wow, would you look at that?

975
01:51:13,584 --> 01:51:17,042
- Just keep going. Just keep going.
- You said Logan Street.

976
01:51:17,126 --> 01:51:19,042
- The trailer. It's right there.
- Just keep going.

977
01:51:19,167 --> 01:51:21,251
Just wait
till Michael gets here, huh?

978
01:51:22,501 --> 01:51:24,751
This is it!
This is Michael!

979
01:51:26,542 --> 01:51:30,542
All right. Everybody, stay where you are!
Stay right there. I'll go get him.

980
01:51:30,626 --> 01:51:32,084
Everybody, stay here.

981
01:51:32,167 --> 01:51:34,167
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

982
01:51:34,251 --> 01:51:35,959
Hip, hip, hurray!

983
01:51:36,626 --> 01:51:38,459
Hip, hip, hurray!

984
01:51:39,084 --> 01:51:41,417
Hip, hip, hurray!

985
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:51,667
- That cab ain't stopping.
- What's going on?

986
01:51:56,917 --> 01:51:59,626
I can't wait for him
to see all this stuff.

987
01:51:59,709 --> 01:52:00,876
What happened?

988
01:52:00,959 --> 01:52:03,417
Hey, Stosh, what happened?
I thought it was him.

989
01:52:03,501 --> 01:52:05,667
So his plane could be late.

990
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:09,001
Take it easy, will you, Axel?
You're driving everyone nuts.

991
01:52:12,042 --> 01:52:14,001
You OK?

992
01:52:21,626 --> 01:52:23,667
I know Nick will be back soon.

993
01:52:24,834 --> 01:52:27,459
I know Nick.
He'll be coming back, too.

994
01:52:29,126 --> 01:52:31,251
- Right, Axel?
- Fuckin' A.

995
01:52:32,709 --> 01:52:35,959
- Go straight on down to the highway.
- It's your bread, man.

996
01:56:19,459 --> 01:56:21,292
It's open!

997
01:56:36,834 --> 01:56:39,126
I'm sor... Michael?

998
01:56:41,126 --> 01:56:43,626
Oh, Michael!

999
01:56:44,376 --> 01:56:45,501
Oh!

1000
01:56:45,626 --> 01:56:48,876
Oh, Michael! Oh, Michael!

1001
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:52,167
Oh, my God.

1002
01:56:53,542 --> 01:56:55,709
Oh, gee.

1003
01:56:55,792 --> 01:56:58,042
Gee, you look beautiful.

1004
01:56:58,959 --> 01:57:02,709
Oh, uh... let me take your coat.

1005
01:57:02,792 --> 01:57:06,542
Oh! Everybody was here.
You missed them all.

1006
01:57:06,667 --> 01:57:08,084
Oh.

1007
01:57:09,292 --> 01:57:12,751
They're gonna be so mad
when they find out they missed you.

1008
01:57:16,167 --> 01:57:18,459
Welcome home.

1009
01:57:23,917 --> 01:57:26,292
You know, I was hoping...

1010
01:57:27,834 --> 01:57:31,584
I was hoping somehow, Michael,
maybe you had... Nick with you.

1011
01:57:32,376 --> 01:57:33,709
No.

1012
01:57:34,917 --> 01:57:36,626
No.

1013
01:57:44,376 --> 01:57:46,751
You hear anything on Nick?

1014
01:57:49,001 --> 01:57:50,959
No.

1015
01:57:53,001 --> 01:57:55,251
Nothing.
He's A.W.O.L.

1016
01:57:55,376 --> 01:57:57,209
That's all we know.

1017
01:58:00,751 --> 01:58:02,292
He'll be back.

1018
01:58:03,126 --> 01:58:05,709
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

1019
01:58:06,459 --> 01:58:07,834
Maybe you were out.

1020
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:12,001
Yeah. Maybe.

1021
01:58:17,667 --> 01:58:19,501
So how are you anyway?

1022
01:58:20,376 --> 01:58:22,376
I'm fine. OK.
How are you?

1023
01:58:23,084 --> 01:58:25,084
Er... me?

1024
01:58:25,167 --> 01:58:28,001
I'm OK. I'm fine.
I go along, you know?

1025
01:58:28,084 --> 01:58:31,126
Still working at the market there.

1026
01:58:31,751 --> 01:58:33,626
There's a million things to do.

1027
01:58:35,084 --> 01:58:37,459
- You sure you're all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1028
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:40,876
- What about your wounds?
- It was nothing, just...

1029
01:58:42,584 --> 01:58:45,417
- Just the usual complications, that's all.
- We heard.

1030
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:48,792
No, that's not true,
a lot of guys go through it.

1031
01:58:48,876 --> 01:58:50,834
Hmm.

1032
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:55,667
I made Nick that sweater.

1033
01:59:02,626 --> 01:59:05,959
I couldn't remember
the exact size, but...

1034
01:59:06,042 --> 01:59:09,126
I think he's about
the same size as you, huh?

1035
01:59:12,084 --> 01:59:13,542
No.

1036
01:59:13,626 --> 01:59:15,959
Too big. Whoops.

1037
01:59:17,001 --> 01:59:20,251
Well, I could fix that, though.
I mean...

1038
01:59:20,334 --> 01:59:23,001
One thing about wool,
it's really a cinch...

1039
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:27,959
...to fix.

1040
01:59:29,167 --> 01:59:30,584
Oh, Christ.

1041
01:59:33,584 --> 01:59:35,209
It's OK.

1042
01:59:41,709 --> 01:59:43,292
It's OK.

1043
01:59:44,792 --> 01:59:47,876
- How's your job?
- Great. Fine. Yeah.

1044
01:59:49,292 --> 01:59:53,209
Once or twice we almost had to close.
I gotta go to work now.

1045
01:59:55,167 --> 01:59:57,334
- Gotta go now?
- Yeah.

1046
01:59:57,417 --> 02:00:00,001
Uh, would you mind
if I walked you to work?

1047
02:00:03,792 --> 02:00:07,292
Mikie, you're so... weird.

1048
02:00:08,751 --> 02:00:11,001
You're always such a gentleman.

1049
02:00:12,334 --> 02:00:14,126
Well...

1050
02:00:19,626 --> 02:00:21,292
- It's cold out there.
- Yeah.

1051
02:00:21,376 --> 02:00:23,084
I'm not used to it.

1052
02:00:24,501 --> 02:00:26,667
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

1053
02:00:27,959 --> 02:00:30,167
I'm so happy.

1054
02:00:32,334 --> 02:00:34,709
I really don't know
what I feel.

1055
02:01:03,834 --> 02:01:06,167
- Hey, Jack.
- Hello. How are you?

1056
02:01:28,001 --> 02:01:32,626
Linda, er... I just want to say
how sorry I am about Nick.

1057
02:01:33,542 --> 02:01:37,834
And how... I know how much
you loved him, and...

1058
02:01:37,917 --> 02:01:40,376
I know that it'll never be the same.

1059
02:01:42,001 --> 02:01:44,417
I just wanted to tell you that.

1060
02:01:45,251 --> 02:01:49,167
Maybe... I don't know,
maybe you don't want to talk about it.

1061
02:02:05,167 --> 02:02:07,292
How's it going, hot lips?

1062
02:02:09,126 --> 02:02:11,251
Yeah, a new kid.

1063
02:02:11,334 --> 02:02:13,126
A real tough guy.

1064
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:16,292
It's OK.

1065
02:02:17,667 --> 02:02:19,626
Mike.

1066
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:22,959
Why don't you come in with me?

1067
02:02:23,042 --> 02:02:25,751
Just say hello. Go on, just for...
Oh, Mike, please.

1068
02:02:25,834 --> 02:02:28,292
Just say hello.
They want to see you, I know.

1069
02:02:28,376 --> 02:02:30,459
Just for a second, OK?
OK.

1070
02:02:30,542 --> 02:02:33,042
Hey, look who's here.
It's Michael.

1071
02:02:33,126 --> 02:02:36,251
- Look who's here. Hey, everybody.
- Oh, Michael!

1072
02:02:36,334 --> 02:02:40,542
- Oh, Michael, I read about you in the paper.
- Helen!

1073
02:02:40,626 --> 02:02:43,084
- Let me...
- Oh, Michael. Oh, dear.

1074
02:02:43,167 --> 02:02:46,042
- Doesn't he look terrific, Janie?
- Hi, Michael.

1075
02:02:46,126 --> 02:02:47,917
- Mike!
- How beautiful you look.

1076
02:02:48,001 --> 02:02:52,376
- You look good, Mike. Welcome back.
- We're glad he's home.

1077
02:02:52,459 --> 02:02:56,626
- Wait a minute. Look at his medals.
- Congratulations.

1078
02:02:56,709 --> 02:03:00,167
- There's gotta be 20.
- Oh, Michael.

1079
02:03:00,251 --> 02:03:04,626
- Helen! Come on.
- Janie, leave me alone.

1080
02:03:04,709 --> 02:03:07,709
We really won over there,
huh, Mike? We won.

1081
02:03:07,792 --> 02:03:10,834
- I have to go to work now.
- We better...

1082
02:03:10,917 --> 02:03:12,709
Good seeing you.

1083
02:03:12,792 --> 02:03:14,626
See you, Michael.

1084
02:03:14,709 --> 02:03:16,251
- Come see us.
- See you, Michael.

1085
02:03:16,334 --> 02:03:18,084
Bye.

1086
02:03:19,417 --> 02:03:21,792
- Can I see you later?
- OK.

1087
02:03:21,876 --> 02:03:23,876
- After work?
- Yeah. Where?

1088
02:03:23,959 --> 02:03:26,209
- Home?
- Home? OK.

1089
02:03:57,126 --> 02:03:59,792
- One beer at John's. One beer.
- One? Er...

1090
02:03:59,876 --> 02:04:01,792
Come on. I'll buy you a beer.

1091
02:04:01,876 --> 02:04:03,751
I'm in. All right.
Just one.

1092
02:04:03,834 --> 02:04:06,042
Hey, Axel. Hey, Stosh. Axhead.

1095
02:04:12,292 --> 02:04:15,084
Hey, man. How are you doing?
Hey, where was you?

1096
02:04:15,209 --> 02:04:17,001
- Where was you?
- What do you mean? Where were you?

1097
02:04:17,126 --> 02:04:19,334
Where was you? We had everything
all set there. The beer...

1098
02:04:19,459 --> 02:04:21,667
- Right, Axel?
- Fuckin' A.

1099
02:04:21,792 --> 02:04:24,042
I got delayed.

1100
02:04:24,126 --> 02:04:26,709
- Something...
- Hey.

1101
02:04:28,126 --> 02:04:30,542
You got a moustache.

1102
02:04:30,626 --> 02:04:33,167

- Hey, looks pretty good.

1103
02:04:34,376 --> 02:04:36,834
- It looks cute.
- Yeah, it looks...

Come on.
We're going to John's.

1105
02:04:40,709 --> 02:04:43,417
So how you guys been?

1106
02:04:44,876 --> 02:04:48,417
- Hanging in there. You know?
- How's it feel to be shot?

1107
02:04:48,501 --> 02:04:51,626
- It don't.
- Oh.

1108
02:04:51,709 --> 02:04:54,209
It don't hurt.
If that's what you wanna know.

Same old thing, you know?
Nothing's changed.

back there. Look at that.

1117
02:05:18,209 --> 02:05:20,501
- Watch it.
- What's that for?

1118
02:05:20,626 --> 02:05:23,001
- Same thing the other one was for.
- And what was that for?

1119

- He's a worrier.
- Ah, forget it.

Not so good, Mike.

1147
02:07:06,751 --> 02:07:09,167
- Worse since she talked to him.
- Talked to who?

1148
02:07:09,292 --> 02:07:10,792
Steven.

1149
02:07:11,626 --> 02:07:14,334
She talked to Steve?
I didn't know he was back.

1150
02:07:15,792 --> 02:07:17,501

- Oh, Jesus.

Angela wouldn't tell us.

1176
02:10:37,167 --> 02:10:38,667
- What?
- I was gonna go.

1177
02:10:38,751 --> 02:10:42,126
Don't go. I have, er...
all this food.

1178
02:10:42,209 --> 02:10:44,751
I'll make you
a nice sit-down dinner.

Can't we just comfort
each other?

02:11:04,167 --> 02:11:07,001
No, I can't. Not here.

want to do now, huh?

02:16:16,917 --> 02:16:19,876

1242
02:16:19,959 --> 02:16:23,167

- I was asking Mike.

1243
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:25,834
- He's going.
- Yeah, Mike's going.

1244
02:16:25,917 --> 02:16:30,209
- But no women.
- Just like old times, hey, am I right?

Forty times
we could've had it!

1248
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:15,584
If I'd have been where you are.

1249
02:18:26,251 --> 02:18:28,459
Go get him, Axel!

1250
02:18:32,126 --> 02:18:33,334
Fuck you guys.

Hey! Hey, John!

02:19:13,501 --> 02:19:16,251
Hey, fellas! I got one!

1256
02:20:04,834 --> 02:20:06,376

1257
02:20:35,792 --> 02:20:40,251
OK!

1258
02:20:55,876 --> 02:20:58,042
What's that stupid little gun
doing up here?

1259
02:21:02,167 --> 02:21:03,542
In case.

1260
02:21:03,626 --> 02:21:06,542
"In case"!
In case of what?

1261
02:21:06,626 --> 02:21:08,542
In case you stumble
on one of your girlfriends

1262
02:21:08,626 --> 02:21:11,001
sucking on a forest ranger's cock?

1263
02:21:13,126 --> 02:21:14,709
You say that one more time.

1264
02:21:15,417 --> 02:21:18,084
Say it!
Go on. Say it!

1265
02:21:18,167 --> 02:21:21,084
Stanley, you're so full of shit
you're gonna float away.

1266
02:21:21,167 --> 02:21:25,417
- Try me! You try me! Just say it!
- You're gonna float away.

1267
02:21:25,542 --> 02:21:28,917
- Easy, Mike.
- Ow! Hey!

1268
02:21:29,042 --> 02:21:31,501
- Take it easy, Mike.
- What the hell was that for?

1269
02:21:31,584 --> 02:21:34,167
What? You think it was loaded?
Gimme that.

1270
02:21:40,126 --> 02:21:41,876
Don't.

1271
02:21:48,042 --> 02:21:51,876
You wanna play games?
All right, I'll play your fucking games.

1272
02:21:56,417 --> 02:21:57,959
- Hey!
- How do you feel now?

1273
02:21:58,501 --> 02:22:00,501
Huh? Huh?

1274
02:22:01,459 --> 02:22:04,167
- Hey!
- Big shot!

1275
02:23:27,542 --> 02:23:29,542
Hi, Michael!

1276
02:23:29,626 --> 02:23:31,251
- Linda's in back.
- She's in the back?

1277
02:23:31,334 --> 02:23:34,667
- Yeah. Hey, how was the hunting?
- It was fine. Thanks.

1278
02:23:46,209 --> 02:23:48,417
Linda, what's the matter?

1279
02:23:53,084 --> 02:23:54,542
I don't know.

1280
02:23:56,584 --> 02:23:57,751
What's the matter?

1281
02:23:59,251 --> 02:24:01,542
Noth... I don't know.

1282
02:24:06,376 --> 02:24:07,709
Well, it's gotta be something.

1283
02:24:12,084 --> 02:24:13,834
I got the car outside.

1284
02:24:13,959 --> 02:24:16,251
Yeah. Well, that's OK.

1285
02:24:18,417 --> 02:24:19,501
You sure?

1286
02:24:19,626 --> 02:24:22,126
No, it's OK.
Just leave me alone, OK?

1287
02:24:24,334 --> 02:24:26,042
Really.

1288
02:24:41,792 --> 02:24:44,126
See you tomorrow.
Have a nice night.

1289
02:24:44,209 --> 02:24:46,959
Goodnight!
See you tomorrow.

1290
02:24:52,334 --> 02:24:54,376
Come with me.
We'll get you home.

1291
02:24:57,959 --> 02:24:59,792
No, I think I'll go with him.

1292
02:24:59,876 --> 02:25:01,167
- OK? Thanks.
- Well, OK.

1293
02:25:11,292 --> 02:25:13,167
You OK?

1294
02:25:16,626 --> 02:25:19,709
Did you ever think
life would turn out like this?

1295
02:25:22,459 --> 02:25:24,376
No.

1296
02:27:55,834 --> 02:27:58,001
"I" 27.

1297
02:28:01,542 --> 02:28:04,167
- "N" 40.
- Bingo!

1298
02:28:04,251 --> 02:28:08,334
We have a bingo.
Johnny-come-lately.

1299
02:28:08,417 --> 02:28:10,209
Where are you, Johnny?

1300
02:28:10,334 --> 02:28:12,084
There you are.

1301
02:28:12,167 --> 02:28:15,584
- "B" 15. "I" 16.
- Right.

1302
02:28:15,667 --> 02:28:17,626
- "N" 33.
- Right.

1303
02:28:17,709 --> 02:28:18,751
"G" 60.

1304
02:28:18,876 --> 02:28:21,542
We, yeah...
That's a winner.

1305
02:28:21,667 --> 02:28:24,126
Get outta my road there,
Ivan Stivan.

1306
02:28:24,209 --> 02:28:26,459
I can't see myself smoking.

1307
02:28:26,542 --> 02:28:29,751
And the next number: "I" 16.

1308
02:28:29,834 --> 02:28:33,001
Wish it was I.
Nice sweet 16.

1309
02:28:33,084 --> 02:28:34,667
"I" 18.

1310
02:28:34,751 --> 02:28:36,584
Then you become a man.

1311
02:28:36,667 --> 02:28:39,209
Let's go, men. "G" 60.

1312
02:28:39,334 --> 02:28:41,834
And those boys that can't
help themselves,

1313
02:28:41,917 --> 02:28:44,042
please, buddy,
help them too.

1314
02:28:44,126 --> 02:28:46,626
Oh, will you dance with me?

1315
02:28:46,709 --> 02:28:49,459
"G" 47.

1316
02:28:49,542 --> 02:28:53,542
But I'm still satisfied
with what I've got,

1317
02:28:53,626 --> 02:28:55,542
that wonderful life I've lived.

1318
02:28:56,126 --> 02:29:00,626
Think it over, buddy boys,
and I'll give you "O" 61.

1319
02:29:05,126 --> 02:29:07,667
Hi. How ya doing?

1320
02:29:07,751 --> 02:29:09,626
Hi.

1321
02:29:12,209 --> 02:29:15,042
Steven, there's a call for you.

1322
02:29:15,126 --> 02:29:17,251
Maybe it's from Angela.

1323
02:29:45,501 --> 02:29:48,542
- Hello.
- 'Stevie, it's me, Mike.'

1324
02:29:48,626 --> 02:29:50,459
Michael?

1325
02:29:51,792 --> 02:29:53,084
Michael.

1326
02:29:53,209 --> 02:29:55,834
- Hey!
- 'Hey!'

1327
02:29:57,292 --> 02:29:58,251
Hey!

1328

How's things?

1329
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:03,584
'I'm OK. Never mind me.
How are you?'

1330
02:30:04,917 --> 02:30:06,417
Great.

1331
02:30:07,376 --> 02:30:09,334
Great.

1332
02:30:11,001 --> 02:30:14,959
Hey, what... Hey, what's that noise?
What?

1333
02:30:15,084 --> 02:30:18,084
Oh, wheelchairs.

1334
02:30:18,167 --> 02:30:20,042
'What?'

1335
02:30:23,584 --> 02:30:25,334
Hey, Stevie,
when are you getting out?

1336
02:30:26,459 --> 02:30:29,459
Oh, I'm gonna stay here
a while, Mike.

1337
02:30:29,584 --> 02:30:32,584
- What for?
- 'The place is great.'

1338
02:30:32,667 --> 02:30:33,834
Huh?

1339
02:30:33,959 --> 02:30:36,251
It's like a resort.

1340
02:30:36,376 --> 02:30:37,501
'You know?'

1341
02:30:37,626 --> 02:30:41,084
I mean,
they got basketball, bowling...

1342
02:30:41,167 --> 02:30:43,001
'What?'

1343
02:30:44,251 --> 02:30:47,001
Princess Grace
came to see us the other day.

1344
02:30:49,209 --> 02:30:51,459
- Michael?
- 'Hey, hey.'

1345
02:30:51,584 --> 02:30:54,667
- Hey!
- 'Michael.'

1346
02:30:55,417 --> 02:30:58,542
'Steve? Stevie?'

1347
02:30:58,626 --> 02:31:00,459
Hey, I gotta go, Mike.

1348
02:31:00,542 --> 02:31:01,584
I gotta go.

1349
02:31:02,334 --> 02:31:04,167
'Curfew, man.'

1350
02:31:04,251 --> 02:31:06,792
Stevie? Steve?

1351
02:31:08,251 --> 02:31:09,667
S...

1352
02:32:12,917 --> 02:32:15,376
Michael!

1353
02:32:16,626 --> 02:32:18,584
Michael! Hey!

1354
02:32:19,751 --> 02:32:21,417
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

1355
02:32:21,501 --> 02:32:23,209
Mike. How are you?

1356
02:32:23,959 --> 02:32:26,251
- Hey, huh?
- Hey.

1357
02:32:26,334 --> 02:32:27,501
- Michael.
- Yeah.

1358
02:32:29,001 --> 02:32:31,001
Hey.

1359
02:32:31,084 --> 02:32:32,626
Uh, hi.

1360
02:32:32,751 --> 02:32:34,751
Sure, we made it.
We made it. We made it.

1361
02:32:34,834 --> 02:32:37,459
- OK!
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1362
02:32:37,542 --> 02:32:40,709
Hey. I don't want to go home.

1363
02:32:41,667 --> 02:32:43,751
- I know. I know.
- Oh, good. Good.

1364
02:32:43,876 --> 02:32:45,834
Yeah, good, good.

1365
02:32:45,917 --> 02:32:47,959
Really.

1366
02:32:49,792 --> 02:32:52,251
- You look good.
- Yeah.

1367
02:32:52,376 --> 02:32:53,709
You do any hunting?

1368
02:32:55,417 --> 02:32:57,167
- Hunting? Uh, yeah.
- Did you get one?

1369
02:32:57,251 --> 02:32:58,334
Er... yeah. No. No.

1370
02:32:58,459 --> 02:33:01,417
- You didn't get a deer?
- Didn't get anything.

1371
02:33:01,542 --> 02:33:03,584
- Huh?
- No. Uh, no.

1372
02:33:03,709 --> 02:33:06,542
I was tracking this beautiful buck...
Slipped away.

1373
02:33:07,459 --> 02:33:10,251
Oh! Oh.

1374
02:33:10,334 --> 02:33:12,792
- Angela didn't send you?
- Angela?

1375
02:33:12,876 --> 02:33:14,376
- She didn't send you here?
- No.

1376
02:33:15,501 --> 02:33:17,126
Yeah, good.

1377
02:33:17,209 --> 02:33:19,292
- I got something I want to show you.
- What's that?

1378
02:33:19,376 --> 02:33:21,167
I got something here.

1379
02:33:22,167 --> 02:33:25,834
Come here with me for a minute.
It's something I gotta show you.

1380
02:33:25,917 --> 02:33:28,001
Yeah. Yeah.

1381
02:33:28,084 --> 02:33:30,792
Angela, she keeps
sending me socks.

1382
02:33:31,917 --> 02:33:34,876
It's not socks
I gotta show you, Mike.

1383
02:33:35,001 --> 02:33:37,917

Coke machine, if anybody wants one.

1404
02:35:10,167 --> 02:35:12,417
Sergeant, we're running late.

1405

<i>C'est pas le moment

1411
02:38:33,584 --> 02:38:35,709
<i>- Il faut filer maintenant.
- Do you remember me?</i>

1412
02:38:35,792 --> 02:38:37,084
<i>Ah, je comprends pas l'anglais.</i>

Do you remember me?

1414
02:38:38,751 --> 02:38:42,042

02:38:47,292 --> 02:38:49,459
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1417
02:38:49,584 --> 02:38:51,459
Really I don't know.

02:38:58,626 --> 02:39:01,459
- Nothing to see anymore here.
- See that?

1422
02:39:04,876 --> 02:39:06,876
That's for you.

1423
02:39:08,751 --> 02:39:10,376
It's too dangerous now.

1424
02:39:10,459 --> 02:39:13,584
These time are too dangerous
for this kind of game.

1425
02:39:15,376 --> 02:39:17,292
What do you think?
You think I'm afraid of you?

1426
02:39:20,792 --> 02:39:23,167
I want to play the American.

1427
02:39:23,251 --> 02:39:26,001
I'll match him.
Highest stakes.

1428

<i>Je crois que je suis
aussi fou que toi.</i>

1429
02:39:35,751 --> 02:39:37,501
OK.

1430
02:39:38,376 --> 02:39:40,001
How do I know
you know where he is?

1431
02:39:41,042 --> 02:39:43,334
Because I know, that's all.

1432
02:39:43,417 --> 02:39:46,001
But I have to take you
by the river.

1433
02:39:59,292 --> 02:40:02,001

1445
02:42:51,626 --> 02:42:54,917
You have to give him $500 more

1446
02:42:55,001 --> 02:42:56,251
<i>Foireux.</i>

1447

1451
02:44:39,126 --> 02:44:41,667
