00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,037
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

183
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,582
"to the temple where the cup that...

184
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:53,089
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

185
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,260
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

186
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,806
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

187
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,644
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

188
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,647
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

189
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,483
The Arthur legend.

190
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,985
I've heard this bedtime story before.

191
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,862
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

192
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,698
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

193
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,159
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

194
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,494
An old man's dream.

195
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,039
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

196
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,170
Grail lore is his hobby.

197
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,838
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

198
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,757
The one the students hope
they don't get.

199
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,219
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

200
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,429
DONOVAN: Be along in a moment, dear.

201
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,728
Hard to resist, isn't it?

202
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,399
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

203
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,317
What good is it?

204
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,196
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

205
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
It's pretty vague.

206
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,408
Where do you want to start looking?

207
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,827
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

208
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,537
but the entire top portion is missing.

209
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,957
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

210
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,921
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

211
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,049
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

212
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,010
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

213
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,848
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

214
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,391
Three brothers, to be exact.

215
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,476
I've heard this one, as well.

216
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,603
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

217
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,732
150 years after having found the Grail

218
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,859
and began the long journey
back to France,

219
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,986
but only one of them made it.

220
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,448
And before dying of extreme old age,

221
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:46,161
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

222
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,997
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

223
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:54,127
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

224
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,172
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

225
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,048
but the knight promised
that two markers

226
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,675
that had been left behind would.

227
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,387
This tablet is one of those markers.

228
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,681
It proves the knight's story is true.

229
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,350
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

230
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,395
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

231
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,565
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

232
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,318
within the city of Venice, Italy.

233
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,781
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

234
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,867
we're about to complete a great quest

235
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,995
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

236
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,456
We're only one step away.

237
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,709
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

238
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,420
You could be more right than you know.

239
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,797
Yes?

240
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,715
We've hit a snag.

241
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,762
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

242
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,349
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

243
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,144
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

244
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,898
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

245
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,068
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

246
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,405
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

247
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,201
Why don't you try my father?

248
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,078
We already have.

249
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,122
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

250
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,011
BRODY: Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

251
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,304
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

252
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,098
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

253
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,183
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

254
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,393
Dad?

255
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,603
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

256
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,771
Dad?

257
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,439
Dad?

258
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,191
Dear God.

259
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,322
BRODY: What has the old fool
got himself into now?

260
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,410
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

261
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,161
Dad?

262
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,498
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

263
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,168
Mail.

264
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,462
That's it, Marcus.

265
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,425
Venice, Italy.

266
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,138
BRODY: What is it?

267
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,310
INDY: It's Dad's Grail diary.

268
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,315
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

269
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,901
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

270
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,571
This is his whole life.

271
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,657
Why would he have sent this to me?

272
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,159
I don't know,

273
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,870
but someone must want it pretty badly.

274
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,924
Do you believe, Marcus?

275
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,813
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

276
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,778
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

277
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,864
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

278
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,452
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

279
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,542
Call Donovan, Marcus.

280
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,545
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

281
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,216
I'll tell him we'll take two.

282
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,974
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

283
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,017
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

284
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,519
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.

285
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,645
It's at your disposal.

286
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,647
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

287
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,068
Dr. Jones, good luck.

288
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,905
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

289
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,025
Signora? Signorina?

290
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,452
- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.

291
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,622
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

292
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,751
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

293
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,169
WOMAN: Dr. Jones?

294
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,963
INDY: Yes?

295
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,299
I knew it was you.

296
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,135
You have your father's eyes.

297
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,432
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

298
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,685
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

299
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,688
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

300
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,523
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

301
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,775
How do you do?

302
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,653
ELSA: The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

303
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,239
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

304
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,200
(LAUGHS) I've never seen him
so excited.

305
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,619
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

306
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,704
INDY: Who? Attila the Professor?

307
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,957
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

308
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,668
Fräulein, will you permit me?

309
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,754
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

310
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,256
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

311
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,675
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

312
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

313
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,179
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

314
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,223
Yes. I have something to show you.

315
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,100
I left your father working in the library.

316
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,269
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

317
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,189
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

318
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,775
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

319
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,859
Roman numerals.

320
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,237
ELSA: Here is the library.

321
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,240
INDY: That doesn't look
much like a library.

322
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,450
BRODY: Looks like a converted church.

323
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,619
In this case, it's the literal truth.

324
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,454
We are on holy ground.

325
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,166
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

326
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,545
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

327
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,506
Now, please excuse me.

328
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,299
The library's closing in a few moments.

329
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,344
I'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

330
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,559
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

331
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,643
Where?

332
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,895
Right here, in Dad's diary.

333
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,655
INDY: You see?

334
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,533
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

335
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,286
Dad was onto something here.

336
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,204
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

337
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,248
but we still don't know what they mean.

338
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,833
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

339
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,627
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

340
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,920
Find something?

341
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,006
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

342
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,592
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

343
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,260
My God, I must be blind.

344
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,513
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

345
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,557
he was looking for the tomb itself.

346
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,975
Don't you get it?

347
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,019
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

348
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,021
You said yourself it used to be a church.

349
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,230
Look.

350
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,690
Three.

351
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,194
Three.

352
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,737
Seven.

353
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,363

Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

468
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,360
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

469
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,279
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

534
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,783
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

535
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,129
Nazis. I hate these guys.

536
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,050
(THUNDERING)

537
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,227
This one. I think he's in here.

538
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,979
How do you know?

539
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,814
Because it's wired.

540
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,094
Indy? Indy?

541
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,597
Don't worry. This is kid's play.

542
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,474
I'll be right back.

543
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,291
Junior?

544
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,668
Yes, sir.

545
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,712
It is you, Junior!

546
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,215
Don't call me that, please.

547
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,633
Well, what are you doing here?

548
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,385
I came to get you. What do you thi...

549
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,220
(VOICES APPROACHING)

550
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,314
Late 14th century, Ming dynasty.

551
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,942
It breaks the heart.

552
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,361
And the head. You hit me, Dad.

553
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,488
I'll never forgive myself.

554
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,907
Don't worry, I'm fine.

555
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,160
Thank God.

556
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,623
It's fake.

557
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,044
See, you can tell by the cross section.

558
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,005
No!

559
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,633
Dad, get your stuff.
We've got to get out of here.

560
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,427
HENRY: Well, I'm sorry
about your head, though,

561
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,804
but I thought you were one of them.

562
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,515
Dad, they come in through the doors.

563
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,434
Good point.

564
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,853
But better safe than sorry.

565
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,938
So I was wrong this time.

566
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,483
But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

567
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,693
You obviously got it.

568
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,489
I got it, and I used it.

569
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,659
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

570
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,244
Through the library?

571
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,079
Right.

572
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,876
I knew it.

573
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,878
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

574
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:27,797
Found it.

575
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,176
He was actually there?

576
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,346
You saw him?

577
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,557
Well, what was left of him.

578
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,601
And his shield,

579
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,396
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?

580
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,773
"Alexandretta."

581
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,735
(EXCLAIMING) Alexandretta! Of course!

582
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,906
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

583
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,660
Junior, you did it.

584
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,913
No, Dad. You did.

585
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,664
Forty years.

586
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,293
If only I could have been with you.

587
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,170
There were rats, Dad.

588
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,963
Rats?

589
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,465
Yeah, big ones.

590
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,175
What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?

591
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,761
- They wanted my diary.
- Yeah?

592
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,390
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me as I possibly could.

593
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,353
Yeah.

594
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,567
Dr. Jones.

595
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,777
BOTH: Yes?

596
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,782
I will take the book now.

597
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,244
BOTH: What book?

598
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,746
You have the diary in your pocket.

599
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,541
(CHUCKLING) You dolt!

600
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,335
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

601
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,797
that he would bring my diary
all the way back here?

602
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,841
You didn't, did you?

603
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,220
- You didn't bring it, did you?
- Well...

604
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,180
You did.

605
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,224
Look, can we discuss this later?

606
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,351
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

607
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,978
Will you take it easy?

608
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,479
Take it easy?

609
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,565
Why do you think I sent it home
in the first place?

610
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,233
So it wouldn't fall into their hands!

611
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,318
I came here to save you!

612
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,403
Oh, yeah?

613
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,905
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

614
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,198
I told you...

615
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,666
...don't call me Junior!

616
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,004
Look what you did!

617
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,966
I can't believe what you did...

618
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,053
Elsa? Elsa?

619
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,306
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

620
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,433
Put down the gun, or the Fräulein dies.

621
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,810
- But she's one of them.
- Indy, please!

622
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,770
- She's a Nazi.
- What?

623
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,105
- Trust me.
- Indy, no!

624
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,189
I will kill her!

625
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,984
- Yeah? Go ahead!
- No! Don't shoot!

626
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,194
Don't worry. He won't.

627
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,780
Indy, please! Do what he says!

628
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,782
And don't listen to her.

629
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,701
- Enough! She dies!
- (CRYING OUT)

630
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,244
Wait! Wait...

631
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,211
I'm sorry.

632
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,048
No, don't be.

633
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,648
But you should have
listened to your father.

634
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,669
She ransacked her own room,
and I fell for it.

635
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,215
How did you know she was a Nazi?

636
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,885
How did you know she was a Nazi?

637
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,012
She talks in her sleep.

638
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,358
I didn't trust her. Why did you?

639
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,236
MAN: Because he didn't take my advice.

640
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,744
Donovan.

641
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:30,623
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

642
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,209
I misjudged you, Walter.

643
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,379
I knew you would sell your mother
for an Etruscan vase,

644
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,924
but I didn't know you would
sell your country and your soul

645
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,968
to the slime of humanity.

646
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,471
Dr. Schneider,

647
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,141
there are pages torn out of this.

648
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,987
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

649
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,197
precise directions from the unknown city

650
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,199
to the secret
Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

651
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,284
So it did.

652
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,119
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

653
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,579
We must have these pages back.

654
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,913
You're wasting your breath.

655
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,790
He won't tell us,

656
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,709
and he doesn't have to.

657
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,337
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

658
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,840
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

659
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,966
HENRY: Marcus?

660
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,427
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

661
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,928
He's not up to the challenge.

662
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,472
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

663
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,681
We'll find him.

664
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,433
The hell you will.

665
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,185
He's got a two-day head start on you,

666
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,686
which is more than he needs.

667
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,105
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

668
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,273
from here to the Sudan.

669
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,026
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

670
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,944
He'll blend in, disappear.

671
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,863
You'll never see him again.

672
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,532
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

673
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,786
Does anyone here speak English?

674
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,953
Or even ancient Greek?

675
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,205
Water? No, thank you, sir.

676
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,623
No. Fish make love in it.

677
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,959
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

678
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,211
No, I really don't want...

679
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,463
No, no, thank you very much.

680
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,548
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

681
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,760
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

682
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,303
Mr. Brody!

683
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,554
Sallah. What a relief.

684
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,973
Marcus Brody, sir.

685
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,767
- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.

686
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,310
A slight detour.

687
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,436
You are on your own?

688
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,231
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

689
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,566
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

690
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,485
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

691
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,028
This map will show you.

692
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,072
It was drawn by...

693
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,990
Mr. Brody.

694
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,909
Welcome to Iskenderun.

695
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,994
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

696
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,204
has sent a car for you.

697
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,581
Well, your servant, sir.

698
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,916
And I am his.

699
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,960
Follow me, please.

700
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,003
My reputation precedes me.

701
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,256
There is no museum in Iskenderun.

702
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,715
Papers, please.

703
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,176
Papers? Of course.

704
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,719
- Run.
- Yes.

705
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,555
Papers. Got it here.

706
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,265
Just finished reading it myself.

707
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,517
- Run.
- Yes.

708
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,519
Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.

709
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,812
Did you say...

710
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,355
Run!

711
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,038
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

712
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,125
Find the back door! Find the back door!

713
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,348

we had a quiet drink?

I had a milkshake.

905
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:24,459
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.

906
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,087
It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.

907
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,797
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

908
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,882
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

909
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,177
Actually, I was a wonderful father.

911
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,932
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?

912
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,475
Wash your ears? Do your homework?

913
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:45,522
No. I respected your privacy,
and I taught you self-reliance.

914
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,191
What you taught me was
that I was less important to you

915
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:51,653
than people who'd been dead
for 500 years in another country.

916
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,697
And I learned it so well

917
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,991
that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.

You left just when
you were becoming interesting.

919

- Very well.

01:54:16,767 --> 01:54:21,062
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

1255
01:54:21,146 --> 01:54:26,275
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

1256
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:53,844
(SIZZLES)

1257
01:54:54,513 --> 01:54:55,679
(MOANS)

1258
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,609
(MAN SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1259
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:55,573
Drop your guns. Please.

1260
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,703
Dad, come on, get to your feet.

1261
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:17,261
We have got it. Come on!

1262
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:21,140
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1263
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:23,267
It's ours, Indy, yours and mine.

1264
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,853
INDY: Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

1265
01:56:25,937 --> 01:56:28,898
The knight warned us
not to take the Grail from here.

1266
01:56:29,065 --> 01:56:30,399
(RUMBLING)

1267
01:56:55,509 --> 01:56:56,550
HENRY: Junior!

1268
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:58,427
Junior!

1269
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,056
Elsa...

1270
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:05,142
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1271
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:06,936
Elsa...

1272
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,355
Give me your other hand, honey.
I can't hold you!

1273
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:11,690
I can reach it. I can reach it.

1274
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:14,401
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

1275
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,364
Elsa!

1276
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,282
(SCREAMING)

1277
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:30,292
Junior, give me your other hand!

1278
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:32,294
I can't hold on.

1279
01:57:32,379 --> 01:57:33,587
I can get it.

1280
01:57:33,672 --> 01:57:35,965
I can almost reach it, Dad.

1281
01:57:36,508 --> 01:57:38,217
Indiana...

1282
01:57:39,427 --> 01:57:40,636
Indiana...

1283
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:46,225
Let it go.

1284
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:07,079
Dad...

1285
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:15,504
Please, Dad.

1286
01:58:46,995 --> 01:58:49,830
Elsa never really believed in the Grail.

1287
01:58:49,914 --> 01:58:52,791
She thought she'd found a prize.

1288
01:58:59,049 --> 01:59:01,175
What did you find, Dad?

1289
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:02,885
Me?

1290
01:59:05,513 --> 01:59:07,681
Illumination.

1291
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:18,067
And what did you find, Junior?

1292
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,611
"Junior"? Dad...

1293
01:59:20,695 --> 01:59:23,197
Please, what does it always mean,
this... This "Junior"?

1294
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:26,158
That's his name: Henry Jones, Junior.

1295
01:59:26,242 --> 01:59:28,077
I like Indiana.

1296
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:30,162
We named the dog Indiana.

1297
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:32,414
May we go home now, please?

1298
01:59:32,499 --> 01:59:33,666
The dog?

1299
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,835
You are named after the dog?

1300
01:59:39,297 --> 01:59:42,925
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

1301
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:46,845
- INDY: Ready?
- Ready.

1302
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:50,140
Indy! Henry! Follow me. I know the way!

1303
01:59:55,939 --> 01:59:57,815
Got lost in his own museum, huh?

1304
01:59:57,899 --> 01:59:59,108
Uh-huh.

1305
01:59:59,734 --> 02:00:02,194
After you, Junior.

1306
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,029
Yes, sir.
