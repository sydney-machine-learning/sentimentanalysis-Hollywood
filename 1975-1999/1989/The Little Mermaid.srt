1
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,477
<i>I'll tell you a tale
of the bottomless blue</i>

2
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>And it's, hey
to the starboard Heave-ho</i>

3
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>Look out, lad
A mermaid be waiting for you</i>

4
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,862
<i>In mysterious
fathoms below</i>

5
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,406
Isn't this great?
The salty sea air,

6
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,409
the wind blowing
in your face.

7
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:21,081
- A perfect day to be at sea.
- Oh, yes, delightful.

8
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,876
A fine strong wind
and a following sea.

9
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,588
King Triton must be
in a friendly-type mood.

10
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,383
- King Triton?
- Why, ruler of the Merpeople, lad.

11
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,178
Thought every good sailor
knew about him.

12
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:39,433
Merpeople.
Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.

13
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,144
But it ain't nonsense.
It's the truth.

14
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:47,107
<i>I'm tellin' ya'
Down in the depths of the ocean they live' Oh'</i>

15
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,945
- Aah'
<i>- In mysterious fathoms below</i>

16
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,047
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!

17
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,066
And presenting the
distinguished court composer...

18
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,112
Horatio Felonious Ignacious
Crustaceous Sebastian.

19
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,123
I'm really looking forward
to this performance, Sebastian.

20
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,126
Your Majesty.

21
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:15,422
This will be the finest concert
I have ever conducted.

22
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:20,260
Your daughters--
They will be spectacular.

23
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,637
Yes.

24
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,058
- And especially my little Ariel.
- Yes, yes.

25
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,354
She has the most
beautiful voice. Hmm?

26
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,482
If only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.

27
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,135
<i>Ah, we are the daughters
of Triton</i>

28
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,305
<i>Great father who loves us
and named us well</i>

29
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,559
<i>Aquata</i>

30
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,228
<i>Andrina</i>

31
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,314
<i>Arista, Attina</i>

32
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,359
<i>Adella, Alana</i>

33
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,404
<i>And then there is the youngest
in her musical debut</i>

34
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,323
<i>Our seventh little sister
We're presenting her to you</i>

35
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,159
<i>To sing a song Sebastian wrote
her voice is like a bell</i>

36
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,538
<i>She's our sister Ari--</i>

37
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,168
Ariel!

38
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,674
Ariel, wait for me.

39
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,510
Flounder, hurry up.

40
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,514
You know I can't swim that fast.

41
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,642
There it is.

42
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,020
Isn't it fantastic?

43
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,689
Yeah, sure.
I-It's great.

44
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,858
Now let's get outta here.

45
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,194
You're not getting
cold fins now, are you?

46
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,197
Who, me? No way.

47
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,825
It's just-- It, uh--
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

48
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,703
And I think I may be
coming down with something.

49
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,540
Yeah, I got this cough.

50
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,126
All right.
I'm going inside.

51
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,420
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.

52
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,840
Okay. Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and--

53
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,885
What? Sharks? Ariel!

54
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:29,139
Ariel, I can't-- I mean--

55
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,808
Ariel, help!

56
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,770
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.

57
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,065
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

58
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,235
- Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
- I'm not a guppy.

59
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,906
This is great.

60
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,909
I mean, I really love this.

61
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,789
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner--

62
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,836
Ariel!

63
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,088
Oh, are you okay?

64
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,423
Yeah, sure.
No problem. I'm okay.

65
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,809
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!

66
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,479
Have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?

67
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,275
Wow! Cool!
But, uh, what is it?

68
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,488
- I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.
- What was that?

69
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,784
- Did you hear something?
- Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

70
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,954
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?

71
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,290
Nothing is going to happen.

72
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,211
Shark! Shark!
We're gonna die!

73
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,813
Oh, no!

74
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,345
You big bully!

75
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,684
- Flounder, you really are a guppy.
- I am not.

76
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,440
<i>Hmm-hmm, fourteen hundred
and ninety-two</i>

77
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,943
<i>Dum-de-dum
Do-do-do</i>

78
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,529
<i>Rum-dim-dim
Do-do-dee-do</i>

79
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,114
- Scuttle!
- Whoa!

80
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,910
Mermaid off the port bow!

81
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,914
Ariel, how you doin', kid?

82
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,751
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

83
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,712
Yeah, we were in this sunken
ship, and it was really creepy--

84
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:09,091
Human stuff, huh?
Hey, let me see.

85
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:17,266
Oh! Oh!
Look at this.

86
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,811
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

87
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,940
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

88
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:30,320
Humans use these little babies
to straighten their hair out.

89
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:35,200
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and viola--

90
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,162
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair...

91
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,331
that humans go nuts over.

92
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,417
A dinglehopper.

93
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,419
- What about that one?
- Ah!

94
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:51,133
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful.

95
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,969
A banded, bulbous...

96
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,096
- snarfblatt.
- Oh!

97
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,516
Now, the snarfblatt dates back
to prehistorical times...

98
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:05,105
when humans used to sit around
and stare at each other all day.

99
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,107
Got very boring.

100
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,737
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

101
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,114
Allow me.

102
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,657
Music!

103
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,035
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

104
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:21,955
- Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!
- The concert was today?

105
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,292
- Maybe you could make a little planter
out of it or something. - I'm sorry.

106
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,669
I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

107
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,507
Anytime, sweetie. Anytime.

108
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:49,358
Yes, hurry home,
Princess.

109
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:54,863
We wouldn't want to miss
old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?

110
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,535
Ha! Celebration, indeed.
Oh, bah!

111
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,623
In my day, we had
fantastical feasts...

112
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,168
when I lived in the palace.

113
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,798
And, now, look at me.

114
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,676
Wasted away to
practically nothing.

115
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:19,805
Banished and exiled
and practically starving...

116
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,893
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

117
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,023
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

118
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,276
Flotsam! Jetsam!

119
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:37,531
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

120
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:42,661
She may be the key
to Triton's undoing.

121
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:50,210
I just don't know what we're going
to do with you, young lady.

122
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,212
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I just forgot.

123
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,300
- As a result of your careless behavior--
- Careless and reckless behavior--

124
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,594
The entire celebration
was, uh--

125
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,389
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

126
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:08,228
This concert was to be the pinnacle
of my distinguished career.

127
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,356
Now, thanks to you, I am
the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!

128
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:17,487
But it wasn't her fault--
Uh, oh, first, uh, the shark chased us.

129
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,074
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to--
but we couldn't, and he--

130
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,328
And-- And we--
Whoa!

131
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,330
And then we were safe.

132
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,833
But then this seagull came, and it was,
"This is this, and that is that". And--

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,086
Seagull?
What? Oh.

134
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,798
You went up to the surface
again, didn't you? Didn't you?

135
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:42,679
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?

136
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:47,434
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by-by one of those humans.

137
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,020
- Daddy, they're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

138
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,105
Do you think I want to see
my youngest daughter...

139
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,107
snared by some fish-eater's hook?

140
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,693
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

141
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,446
Don't you take that tone
of voice with me, young lady.

142
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,991
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.

143
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,827
- But if you would just listen--
- Not another word!

144
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,498
And I am never, never to hear
of you going to the surface again!

145
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,792
Is that clear?

146
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:22,636
Hmph! Teenagers.
They think they know everything.

147
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,348
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

148
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:30,394
Do you think
I was too hard on her?

149
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,396
Definitely not.

150
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:36,859
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

151
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:41,405
None of this flitting to the
surface and other such nonsense.

152
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,324
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

153
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,202
- You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

154
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,164
- Ariel needs constant supervision.
- Constant.

155
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,833
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

156
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,253
- All the time.
- And you are just the crab to do it.

157
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,341
How do I get myself
into these situations?

158
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,427
I should be writing symphonies...

159
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,097
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.

160
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:14,354
Hmm? What is that girl up to?

161
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:43,884
Huh?

162
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,310
Ariel, are you okay?

163
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,605
If only I could
make him understand.

164
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,691
I just don't see things
the way he does.

165
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,904
I don't see how a world that
makes such wonderful things...

166
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,906
could be bad.

167
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:10,327
<i>Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?</i>

168
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,705
<i>Wouldn't you think
my collection's complete?</i>

169
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>Wouldn't you think
I'm the girI</i>

170
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:20,379
<i>The girl who has
everything?</i>

171
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,715
<i>Look at this trove
Treasures untoId</i>

172
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,094
<i>How many wonders
can one cavern hold?</i>

173
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,805
<i>Lookin' around here
you'd think</i>

174
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,183
<i>Sure, she's got
everything</i>

175
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,562
<i>I've got gadgets
and gizmos aplenty</i>

176
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:40,607
<i>I've got whozits
and whatzits galore</i>

177
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,444
<i>You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty</i>

178
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,740
<i>But who cares?
No big deal</i>

179
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:53,829
<i>I want more</i>

180
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:59,293
<i>I wanna be
where the people are</i>

181
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:03,422
<i>I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin'</i>

182
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:07,259
<i>WaIkin' around on those--
What do ya call 'em?</i>

183
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,304
<i>Oh, feet.</i>

184
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,308
<i>Flippin' your fins
you don't get too far</i>

185
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,477
<i>Legs are required
for jumpin', dancin'</i>

186
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:21,315
<i>Strollin' along down a--
What's that word again?</i>

187
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,317
<i>Street</i>

188
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:27,070
<i>Up where they walk
Up where they run</i>

189
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:31,158
<i>Up where they stay
all day in the sun</i>

190
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,995
<i>Wanderin' free
Wish I could be</i>

191
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,165
<i>Part of that world</i>

192
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,335
<i>What wouId I give
if I couId live</i>

193
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,338
<i>Out of these waters?</i>

194
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:47,758
<i>What would I pay
to spend a day</i>

195
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,094
<i>Warm on the sand?</i>

196
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,097
<i>Bet ya on land
they understand</i>

197
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,727
<i>Bet they don't reprimand
their daughters</i>

198
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:02,189
<i>Bright young women
sick of swimmin'</i>

199
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:07,569
<i>Ready to stand</i>

200
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,490
<i>And ready to know
what the people know</i>

201
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:15,118
<i>Ask 'em my questions
and get some answers</i>

202
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:19,540
<i>What's a fire and why does it--
What's the word?</i>

203
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,625
<i>Burn</i>

204
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,462
<i>When's it my turn?
Wouldn't l love</i>

205
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:31,385
<i>Love to explore
that shore up above?</i>

206
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:36,265
<i>Out of the sea</i>

207
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,935
<i>Wish I could be</i>

208
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,648
<i>Part of that</i>

209
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:49,486
<i>World</i>

210
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,924
Sebastian!

211
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:19,641
Ariel, what are you--
How could you-- What is all this?

212
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,187
It's, uh--
It's just my collection.

213
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,356
Oh, I see.

214
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:31,236
Your collection, hmm. If your
father knew about this place--

215
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,280
You're not gonna tell him,
are you?

216
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,824
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

217
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:39,953
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

218
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,372
Come with me.
I'll take you home...

219
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,625
and get you something
warm to drink.

220
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,211
- What do you suppose--
- Ariel?

221
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,173
Ariel?

222
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,478
Ariel, what are you--

223
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,147
Jumpin' jellyfish!

224
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:13,987
Ariel? Ariel!
Please! Come back!

225
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,695
Max! Here, boy!

226
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,079
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

227
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,082
Come on, Max.

228
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,419
Good boy. Good boy.

229
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,594
Hey there, sweetie!
Quite a show, eh?

230
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,596
Scuttle, be quiet.
They'll hear you.

231
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,473
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

232
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,352
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

233
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,398
I've never seen a human
this close before.

234
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:36,612
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?

235
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:40,824
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

236
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,993
Not that one.

237
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,163
The one playing the snarfblatt.

238
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,999
Silence, silence.

239
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,960
It is now my honor and privilege...

240
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,338
to present our esteemed
Prince Eric...

241
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:57,257
with a very special,
very expensive...

242
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,010
very large birthday present.

243
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:03,597
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

244
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,599
I know.

245
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,435
Happy birthday, Eric.

246
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,193
Uh, gee, Grim-- Ha'

247
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,821
It's, uh--
It's-It's really somethin'.

248
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,907
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

249
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,953
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

250
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,455
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

251
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,707
Look, you're not still sore
because I didn't fall for...

252
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,709
the princess of Glowehaven,
are you?

253
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,129
Oh, my! Oh, Eric,
it isn't me alone.

254
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:39,508
The entire kingdom wants
to see you happily settled down...

255
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,510
with the right girl.

256
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,137
Oh, she's out there somewhere.
I just--

257
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,850
I just haven't found her yet.

258
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,186
Well, perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

259
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,939
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

260
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:58,694
Without a doubt, it'll just--
bam-- hit me like lightning.

261
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,201
Hurricane a-comin'!

262
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:11,540
Stand fast!
Secure the riggin'!

263
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:32,895
Whoa! The wind's all ofa sudden
on the move here! Yo!

264
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,231
Ariel!

265
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,227
Look out!

266
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,867
Grim! Ha-Hang on!

267
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,248
Max!

268
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:53,767
Jump, Max! Come on, boy!
Jump! You can do it, Max!

269
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,361
Eric!

270
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:48,113
Is he... dead?

271
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,533
It's hard to say.

272
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,248
Oh, I-- I can't
make out a heartbeat.

273
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:02,920
No, look'
He's breathing.

274
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,006
He's so beautiful.

275
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:12,095
<i>What would I give
to live where you are</i>

276
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:16,183
<i>What would I pay
to stay here beside you</i>

277
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:23,232
<i>What would I do to see you
smiling at me</i>

278
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,027
<i>Where would we walk
Where would we run</i>

279
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:30,739
<i>If we could stay all day
in the sun</i>

280
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:35,077
<i>Just you and me
and I could be</i>

281
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:39,206
<i>Part of your world</i>

282
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:45,212
Eric? Eric!

283
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,591
You really delight in
these sadistic strains...

284
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,469
on my blood pressure, don't you?

285
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,222
A-A girl... rescued me.

286
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,268
She-- She was singing.

287
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:03,230
She had the most
beautiful voice.

288
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:07,401
Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed
a bit too much seawater.

289
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:11,113
Off we go.
Come on, Max.

290
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,116
We just gonna forget
this whole thing ever happened.

291
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,285
The sea king will never know.

292
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:21,123
You won't tell him. I won't tell him.
I will stay in one piece.

293
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,253
<i>I don't know when
I don't know how</i>

294
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:32,593
<i>But I know something's
starting right now</i>

295
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:35,929
<i>Watch and you'll see</i>

296
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:39,266
<i>Someday I'll be</i>

297
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,768
<i>Part of your</i>

298
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:46,648
<i>World</i>

299
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:02,331
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't stand it. It's too easy.

300
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:05,792
The child is in love
with a human.

301
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:09,129
And not just any human.
A prince'

302
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,550
Her daddy will love that.

303
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:16,803
King Triton's headstrong,
lovesick girl...

304
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,226
would make a charming addition
to my little garden.

305
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,490
Ariel, dear, time to come out.

306
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,534
You've been in there
all morning.

307
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,873
What is with her lately?

308
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:52,172
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well.

309
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,639
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

310
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,518
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.

311
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:08,772
Ariel? In love?

312
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,525
Okay. So far, so good.

313
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,736
I don't think the king knows.

314
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:18,824
But it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.

315
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,078
He loves me.

316
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,206
Mmm. He loves me not.

317
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:30,752
He loves me!
I knew it!

318
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,754
Ariel, stop talking crazy!

319
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,340
I gotta see him again...
tonight.

320
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:38,302
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please!

321
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,930
Will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?

322
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:46,018
I'll swim up to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

323
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,812
- And then we'll go--
- Down here is your home!

324
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:51,106
Ariel, listen to me.

325
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,108
<i>The human world--
It's a mess</i>

326
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:58,113
<i>Life under the sea is better
than anything they got up there</i>

327
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,118
<i>The seaweed is always greener
in somebody else's lake</i>

328
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,454
<i>You dream about
going up there</i>

329
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,123
<i>But that is a big mistake</i>

330
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,375
<i>Just look at the world
around you</i>

331
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,836
<i>Right here on the ocean floor</i>

332
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,255
<i>Such wonderfuI things
around you</i>

333
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,883
<i>What more is you lookin' for</i>

334
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:22,638
<i>Under the sea
Under the sea</i>

335
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:27,100
<i>Darling, it's better
down where it's wetter take it from me</i>

336
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:31,813
<i>Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away</i>

337
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,317
<i>While we devoting full time
to floating under the sea</i>

338
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,491
<i>Down here all the fish is happy</i>

339
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:45,160
<i>As off through the waves
they roll ,yeah</i>

340
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,162
<i>The fish on the land
ain't happy</i>

341
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,998
<i>They sad
'cause they in the bowl</i>

342
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,626
<i>But fish in the bowl is lucky</i>

343
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,795
<i>They in for a worser fate</i>

344
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,339
<i>One day when the boss get hungry</i>

345
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,341
<i>Guess who's gonna
be on the plate</i>

346
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,969
<i>What? No!
Under the sea</i>

347
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,346
<i>Under the sea</i>

348
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:09,184
<i>Nobody beat us, fry us
and eat us in fricassee</i>

349
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:12,062
<i>We what the land folks
loves to cook</i>

350
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,064
<i>Under the sea
we off the hook</i>

351
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,900
<i>We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles</i>

352
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,194
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

353
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,196
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

354
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,949
<i>Since life is sweet here
we got it beat here</i>

355
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,869
<i>- Naturally
- Naturally</i>

356
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:31,331
<i>Even the sturgeon and the ray
they get the urge and start to play</i>

357
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:36,378
<i>We got the spirit
You got to hear it under the sea</i>

358
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,714
<i>The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp</i>

359
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,175
<i>The plaice play the bass
and they soundin' sharp</i>

360
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,677
<i>The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub</i>

361
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,054
<i>- The fluke is the duke of soul
- Yeah!</i>

362
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,390
<i>The ray, he can play
The ling's on the strings</i>

363
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,726
<i>The trout's rocking out
The blackfish, he sings</i>

364
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,353
<i>The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at</i>

365
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,064
<i>And, oh, that blowfish blow</i>

366
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:24,009
<i>- Yeah, under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

367
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,553
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

368
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,597
<i>When the sardine
begin the beguine</i>

369
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,599
<i>- It's music to me
- Music it is to me</i>

370
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:33,685
<i>What do they got
A lot of sand</i>

371
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,938
<i>We got a hot crustacean band</i>

372
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:39,233
<i>Each little clam here
know how to jam here under the sea</i>

373
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:45,405
<i>Each little slug here
cutting a rug here under the sea</i>

374
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:47,908
<i>Each little snail here
know how to wail here</i>

375
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,410
<i>That's why it's hotter
under the water</i>

376
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,579
<i>Yeah, we in luck here
down in the muck here</i>

377
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:57,751
<i>Under the sea</i>

378
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:03,757
Ariel?

379
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,931
Oh, somebody's got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

380
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,434
Sebastian!

381
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,772
Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

382
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:22,860
- I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
- The sea king?

383
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:26,446
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

384
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:32,161
- He knows.
- Hey, let's see now.

385
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:36,456
Oh, who could
the lucky merman be?

386
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:44,965
Come in, Sebastian.

387
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,179
I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.

388
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,895
Yes?

389
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,523
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Yes, Sebastian.

390
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,234
I'm concerned about Ariel.

391
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,654
Have you noticed
she's been acting peculiar lately?

392
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:12,701
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

393
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:16,497
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

394
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,665
You haven't noticed, hmm?

395
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,543
Oh, well, I--

396
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,006
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

397
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:30,010
I know you've been keeping
something from me.

398
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,347
Keeping something?

399
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,349
About Ariel?

400
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,897
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

401
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:47,528
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

402
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,697
I told her to stay away
from humans! They are bad!

403
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:55,536
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

404
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,538
Humans?

405
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,959
Who said anything about humans?

406
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:07,756
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

407
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:12,177
You'll see.
It's a surprise.

408
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,304
Oh, Flounder.

409
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,308
Flounder, you're the best!

410
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:22,938
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

411
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:28,068
Why, Eric, run away with you?

412
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:31,822
Oh, this is all so-- so sudden.

413
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,161
Daddy?

414
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:44,585
I consider myself
a reasonable merman.

415
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,424
I set certain rules, and I expect
those rules to be obeyed.

416
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:54,511
- But, Dad, I--
- Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?

417
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:59,266
- Daddy, I had to--
- Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

418
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,102
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

419
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,689
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

420
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,192
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

421
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,195
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

422
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:15,199
Spineless, savage, harpooning
fish-eaters incapable of any feeling--

423
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,367
Daddy, I love him!

424
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,120
No!

425
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,539
Have you lost
your senses completely?

426
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:26,084
- He's a human. You're a mermaid.
- I don't care.

427
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,339
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

428
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:34,301
And if this is the
only way, so be it!

429
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,848
Daddy! No!

430
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:42,518
No! Please!

431
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:46,313
Daddy, stop!
Daddy, stop it!

432
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,235
Daddy, no!

433
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,677
Ariel, I--

434
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:19,012
Just go away.

435
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:42,244
- Poor child.
- Poor, sweet child.

436
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:48,041
She has a very serious problem.

437
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:51,420
If only there were
something we could do.

438
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:54,423
But there is something.

439
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:59,136
Who-- Who are you?

440
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,555
Don't be scared.

441
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,808
We represent someone
who can help you.

442
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:09,980
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

443
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:12,065
Just imagine--

444
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,109
You and your prince--

445
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:18,614
Together forever.

446
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:25,621
- I don't understand.
- Ursula has great powers.

447
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:29,666
The sea witch?

448
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,045
Why, that's--
I couldn't possibly.

449
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,131
No! Get out of here.
Leave me alone!

450
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:39,426
Suit yourself.

451
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:42,763
That was only a suggestion.

452
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:56,944
- Wait.
- Yes?

453
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:01,281
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

454
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,784
It was an accident.

455
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,954
Ariel?
Where are you going?

456
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,748
Ariel, what are you doing
here with this riffraff?

457
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:13,001
I'm going to see Ursula.

458
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,838
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

459
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:19,508
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

460
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:24,388
But-- But, I--
Come on!

461
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,530
This way.

462
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:03,677
Come in.
Come in, my child.

463
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:09,016
We mustn't lurk in doorways.
It's rude.

464
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:12,019
One might question
your upbringing.

465
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,566
Now, then, you're here...

466
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:22,613
because you have a thing for this human,
this, uh, prince fellow.

467
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:28,285
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

468
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:30,913
Well, angelfish...

469
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,876
the solution to
your problem is simple.

470
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:41,590
The only way to get what you want
is to become a human yourself.

471
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,217
Can you do that?

472
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:49,723
My dear, sweet child.
That's what I do.

473
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,850
It's what I live for:

474
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:56,188
to help unfortunate merfolk
like yourself...

475
00:39:56,313 --> 00:40:01,151
poor souls with
no one else to turn to.

476
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:06,031
<i>I admit that in the past
I've been a nasty</i>

477
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:09,743
<i>They weren't kidding when
they called me well, a witch</i>

478
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:13,163
<i>But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways</i>

479
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,624
<i>Repented, seen the light
and made a switch</i>

480
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,001
<i>True? Yes.</i>

481
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:21,922
<i>And I fortunately know
a little magic</i>

482
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:25,092
<i>It's a talent that
I aIways have possessed</i>

483
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:28,595
<i>And here lateIy, please don't laugh,
I use it on behalf</i>

484
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,682
<i>Of the miserable
lonely and depressed</i>

485
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,934
Pathetic.

486
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:37,187
<i>Poor unfortunate souls</i>

487
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:40,440
<i>In pain, in need</i>

488
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:43,610
<i>This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl</i>

489
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:46,780
<i>And do I help them
Yes, indeed</i>

490
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:52,744
<i>Those poor, unfortunate souls
So sad, so true</i>

491
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,956
<i>They come flocking to my cauldron,
crying Spells, Ursula, please</i>

492
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:59,459
<i>And I help them
Yes, I do</i>

493
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:01,461
<i>Now it's happened
once or twice</i>

494
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,714
<i>Someone couldn't
pay the price</i>

495
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:08,051
<i>And I'm afraid I had to
rake 'em across the coals</i>

496
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:10,137
<i>Yes, I've had
the odd complaint</i>

497
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:13,807
<i>But on the whole
I've been a saint</i>

498
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:18,854
<i>To those poor
unfortunate souls</i>

499
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,981
Now, here's the deal.

500
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,236
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

501
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,864
Got that? Three days.

502
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,700
Now, listen,
this is important.

503
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,161
Before the sun sets
on the third day...

504
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:38,665
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

505
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,668
That is,
he's got to kiss you.

506
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:47,174
Not just any kiss--
the kiss of true love.

507
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:50,928
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day...

508
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:55,015
you'll remain human
permanently.

509
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,560
But if he doesn't,
you'll turn back into a mermaid...

510
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:02,689
and... you belong to me!

511
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,609
No, Ariel!

512
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:08,070
Have we got a deal?

513
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:13,242
If I become human, I'll never be
with my father or sisters again.

514
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,619
That's right.

515
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:18,956
But you'll have your man.

516
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:24,378
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

517
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:30,551
Oh! And there is
one more thing.

518
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:33,220
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

519
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:35,305
You can't get something
for nothing, you know.

520
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:37,850
- But I don't have any--
- I'm not asking much.

521
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:42,104
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

522
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:46,608
What I want from you
is your voice.

523
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:50,821
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

524
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:54,491
No more talking, singing.
Zip!

525
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:56,577
But without my voice,
how can I--

526
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:00,539
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

527
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:06,670
And don't underestimate the importance
of body language! Ha!

528
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,631
<i>The men up there
don't like a lot of blabber</i>

529
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,259
<i>They think a girl
who gossips is a bore</i>

530
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,596
<i>Yes, on land it's much preferred
for ladies not to say a word</i>

531
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,974
<i>And, after all, dear what is idle prattle for
Come on, then!</i>

532
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,935
<i>They're not all that
impressed with conversation</i>

533
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,605
<i>True gentlemen avoid it
when they can</i>

534
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:27,858
<i>But they dote and swoon and fawn
on a lady who's with drawn</i>

535
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:30,319
<i>It's she who holds her tongue
who gets her man</i>

536
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:34,281
<i>Come on, you poor
unfortunate soul</i>

537
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,284
<i>Go ahead
Make your choice</i>

538
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:40,370
<i>I'm a very busy woman
and I haven't got all day</i>

539
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:43,290
<i>It won't cost much
just your voice</i>

540
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,626
<i>Ya poor, unfortunate soul</i>

541
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,629
<i>It's sad, but true</i>

542
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,173
<i>If you want to cross a bridge
my sweet, you've got to pay the toll</i>

543
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,510
<i>Take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll</i>

544
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,803
<i>Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys</i>

545
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,641
<i>The boss is on a roll</i>

546
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:03,810
<i>This poor, unfortunate</i>

547
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:09,358
<i>Soul</i>

548
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,736
<i>Beluga, sevruga</i>

549
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:16,907
<i>Come winds of the Caspian Sea</i>

550
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:20,619
<i>Larynxis, glossitis
Et maxlaryngitis</i>

551
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:24,206
<i>La voce to me</i>

552
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,583
Now, sing!

553
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:35,425
Keep singing!

554
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:39,823
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

555
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,869
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

556
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:07,684
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

557
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,395
Look at ya. Look at ya.

558
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:13,774
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.

559
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:16,568
I got it.
It's your hairdo, right?

560
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,695
You've been usin'
the dinglehopper, right?

561
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:23,784
No? No, huh?
Well, let me see.

562
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,786
New seashells?

563
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:30,958
No new seashells. I gotta admit
I can't put my foot on it right now.

564
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:34,127
- But if I just stand here long enough--
- She's got legs, you idiot!

565
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:38,549
She traded her voice to the sea witch
and got legs. Geez, man!

566
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:40,133
I knew that.

567
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,302
Ariel's been
turned into a human.

568
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:45,264
She's gotta make the prince fall
in love with her, and he's gotta k--

569
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:48,892
- He's gotta kiss her.
- And she's only got three days!

570
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,313
Just look at her!

571
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,442
On legs! On human legs!

572
00:46:57,568 --> 00:47:00,654
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!

573
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:03,866
What would her father say? I'll
tell you what her father'd say.

574
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:07,202
He'd say he's gonna kill himself
a crab! That's what her father'd say!

575
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:10,164
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now...

576
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,833
and tell him just like I
should have done the minute--

577
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,378
And don't you shake
your head at me, young lady.

578
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:19,298
Maybe there's still time.
If we could get that witch...

579
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:21,300
to give you back your voice...

580
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:24,845
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be--

581
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,432
Just be--

582
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,770
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

583
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,942
All right, all right.

584
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:43,030
I'll try to help ya
find that prince.

585
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:50,078
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

586
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,789
Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya.
If you wanna be a human...

587
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,959
the first thing ya gotta do is
dress like one. Now, let me see.

588
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:08,347
Max? What?
Huh? What?

589
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,349
Max!

590
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:15,896
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.

591
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,285
Max!

592
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:32,871
Max!

593
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:35,457
Quiet, Max.

594
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:38,043
What's gotten
into you, fella? Oh.

595
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:41,755
Oh, I see.

596
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:44,925
Are you okay, miss?

597
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,302
I'm sorry if this
knuckle head scared you.

598
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,596
He's harmless really, uh--

599
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:56,395
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

600
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:03,277
We have met. I knew it. You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

601
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:06,613
What's your name?

602
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:09,283
W-What's wrong?
What is it?

603
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:15,622
You can't speak? Oh!

604
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:18,333
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

605
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:26,133
W-What is it?
Y-You're hurt?

606
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,969
No, no. You need help?

607
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:31,597
Whoa, whoa, careful!
Careful, easy.

608
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:35,851
Gee, you must have really
been through something.

609
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:38,061
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I'll help you.

610
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,063
Come on. Come on.
You'll be okay.

611
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:50,741
Washed up from a shipwreck.

612
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:53,911
Oh, the poor thing.

613
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,247
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

614
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:04,129
I'll just-- I'll just
get this washed for you.

615
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:10,677
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

616
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,722
- No!
- Gertrude says--

617
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:16,225
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

618
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:18,227
- I mean, really.
- Madam, please--

619
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:21,730
This girl shows up in rags and doesn't
speak. Not my idea of a princess.

620
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:24,733
If Eric's looking for a girl,
I know a couple of...

621
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,402
highly available ones right here.

622
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,708
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

623
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:45,546
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people...

624
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:49,007
in the middle of the ocean, and then
flitter off into oblivion like some--

625
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,635
I'm tellin' ya, Grim.
She was real.

626
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:54,847
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

627
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:58,559
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

628
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:08,569
Oh, Eric,
isn't she a vision?

629
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:11,613
Uh, you look wonderful.

630
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:14,783
Come, come, come.
You must be famished.

631
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,119
Let me help you, my dear.

632
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:20,789
There-- Oh, there we go. Eh,
that's better. Now, quite comfy, hmm?

633
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:22,916
Ha, ha. Good.
It's, uh--

634
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:27,504
It's, uh, not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

635
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:44,563
Uh, do you like it?
It-It is rather a fine one.

636
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:50,110
- Oh, my.
- S-Sorry, Grim.

637
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:54,823
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

638
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,451
Ah, very amusing.

639
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,745
Carlotta, my dear,
what's for dinner?

640
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:05,125
Oh, you're gonna love it! Chef's been
fixing his speciality: stuffed crab.

641
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:16,053
<i>Maurice Chevalier</i>

642
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,143
<i>How I love les poissons</i>

643
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,313
<i>Love to chop
and to serve little fish</i>

644
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:30,108
<i>First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones</i>

645
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:40,577
<i>With the cleaver
I hack them in two</i>

646
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,664
<i>I pull out what's inside
and I serve it up fried</i>

647
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:47,000
<i>God, I love little fishes
Don't you?</i>

648
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:50,671
<i>Here's something for
tempting the palate</i>

649
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:53,006
<i>Prepared in
the classic technique</i>

650
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:56,635
<i>First you pound the fish
flat with the mallet</i>

651
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,180
<i>Then you slash through the skin
Give the belly a slice</i>

652
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:05,936
<i>Then you rub some salt in
'cause that makes it taste nice</i>

653
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:10,649
- Oh.
- Zut alors! I have missed one.

654
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:12,860
<i>Sacre bleu
What is this?</i>

655
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:17,698
<i>How on earth could I miss such
a sweet little succulent crab</i>

656
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,951
<i>Quelle dommage, what a loss
Here we go in the sauce</i>

657
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:23,912
<i>Now some flour
I think just a dab</i>

658
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,040
<i>Now I'll stuff you with bread
It don't hurt 'cause you're dead</i>

659
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:30,419
<i>And you're certainIy
lucky you are</i>

660
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:33,255
<i>'Cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot</i>

661
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:40,470
Eh?

662
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,561
What is this? Ow!

663
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:54,151
Yeow!
Oh, ow, ow, oh!

664
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,302
I think I'd better go see
what Louie is up to.

665
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:26,391
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!

666
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:29,061
- Louie!
- Ow.

667
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:34,191
- What are you doing?
- Well, I-I-I was just, uh, uh, uh--

668
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,944
I'm sorry, madame.

669
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:41,490
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy...

670
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:44,159
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

671
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:46,161
Something in the way
of a tour.

672
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:49,289
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

673
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,417
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

674
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,796
Do something. Have a life.
Get your mind off--

675
00:54:55,921 --> 00:55:00,008
Easy, Grim, easy. It's not
a bad idea, if she's interested.

676
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:02,302
Well, what do ya say?
Would you like to join me...

677
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,680
on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

678
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:09,893
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

679
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,405
Come here, boy.

680
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:40,257
This has got to be,
without a doubt...

681
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:44,845
the single most
humiliating day of my life.

682
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:50,392
I hope that you appreciate what
I go through for you, young lady.

683
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,521
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

684
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:59,651
Tomorrow, when he takes you
for that ride, you gotta look your best.

685
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:04,281
You gotta bat your eyes,
like this.

686
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:08,660
You gotta pucker up
your lips, like this.

687
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:24,384
You are hopeless, child.
You know that?

688
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:28,597
Completely hopeless.

689
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:39,608
- Any sign of them?
- No, Your Majesty.

690
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,693
We've searched everywhere.

691
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:45,113
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

692
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,409
Well, keep looking. Leave no shell
unturned, no coral unexplored.

693
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:53,664
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

694
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,791
Yes, sire.

695
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:02,297
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

696
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:29,324
- Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.

697
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:30,492
Oh!

698
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:37,082
Oh, Judy!

699
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:56,685
Yo! Flounder!
Any kissing?

700
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:59,229
No, not yet.

701
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:01,732
Hmm. Well, they'd--
they'd better get crackin'!

702
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,888
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

703
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:37,810
- I can't see a thing.
- Nothing is happening.

704
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:43,148
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

705
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,609
Okay, all right,
this calls for...

706
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:49,738
a little vocal
romantic stimulation.

707
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:51,740
Stand back!

708
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:02,835
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

709
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:12,636
Oh! Geez, man.
I'm surrounded by amateurs.

710
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:18,517
You want something done,
you've got to do it yourself.

711
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:23,689
First we got to
create the mood.

712
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:25,691
Percussion.

713
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:30,612
Strings. Winds.

714
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:32,990
Words.

715
00:59:33,157 --> 00:59:35,993
<i>There you see her</i>

716
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,288
<i>Sitting there across the way</i>

717
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:45,961
<i>She don't got a lot to say
but there's something about her</i>

718
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:49,423
<i>And you don't know why
but you're dyin' to try</i>

719
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,466
<i>You wanna kiss the girl</i>

720
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:54,219
D-Did you hear something?

721
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:57,055
<i>- Yes
- You want her</i>

722
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:00,809
<i>Look at her
You know you do</i>

723
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:02,811
<i>Possible
she wants you too</i>

724
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:07,149
<i>There is one way
to ask her</i>

725
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,276
<i>It don't take a word</i>

726
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:13,614
<i>Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl</i>

727
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,157
Sing with me now.

728
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:18,160
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my</i>

729
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:22,456
<i>Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl</i>

730
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:26,585
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad, Ain't it a shame</i>

731
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:31,048
<i>Too bad
he gonna miss the girl</i>

732
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:33,342
You know, I feel really bad
not knowing your name.

733
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:37,387
Maybe I can guess.
Is it, uh, Mildred?

734
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,058
Okay, no.

735
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:44,186
How about Diana?
Rachel?

736
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:48,273
- Ariel. Her name is Ariel.
- Ariel?

737
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:51,652
Ariel? Oh.

738
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:55,864
That's kind of pretty.
Okay. Ariel.

739
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:59,576
<i>Now's your moment</i>

740
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,871
<i>Floating in a blue lagoon</i>

741
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:05,541
<i>Boy, you better do it soon</i>

742
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:09,920
<i>- No time will be better
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

743
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:13,090
<i>She don't say a word
And she won't say a word</i>

744
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:15,342
<i>Until ya kiss the girl</i>

745
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:20,722
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared</i>

746
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:24,852
<i>You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl</i>

747
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:27,437
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now</i>

748
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:30,983
<i>Don't try to hide it how
you wanna kiss the girl</i>

749
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,401
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

750
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:34,695
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Float along</i>

751
01:01:34,862 --> 01:01:36,697
<i>And listen to the song</i>

752
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,449
<i>The song say kiss the girl</i>

753
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:42,202
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
The music pIay</i>

754
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:46,498
<i>Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl</i>

755
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,001
<i>Go ahead. Kiss her.
Kiss the girl</i>

756
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:52,504
<i>Why can't you
Kiss the girl?</i>

757
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:57,718
<i>Go on and kiss the girl</i>

758
01:01:57,843 --> 01:02:02,431
<i>- Go on and--
- Kiss the girl</i>

759
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:07,436
Whoa!
Hang on, I've got ya.

760
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,734
Nice work, boys.
That was a close one.

761
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:17,279
Too close.
The little tramp!

762
01:02:17,446 --> 01:02:19,615
Ah, she's better
than I thought.

763
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:24,745
Well, at this rate, he'll be
kissing her by sunset for sure.

764
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:29,541
Well, it's time Ursula took
matters into her own tentacles.

765
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:34,213
Triton's daughter will be mine!
And then I'll make him writhe.

766
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:37,674
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook!

767
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:01,782
Eric?
If I may say...

768
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:05,994
far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood...

769
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:11,291
one warm and caring
and right before your eyes.

770
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:03,427
Ariel!

771
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:06,680
Ariel, wake up! Wake up!
I just heard the news!

772
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:10,058
Congratulations, kiddo,
we did it!

773
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:13,729
Ooh. What is this idiot
babbling about?

774
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:16,565
Right, as if you two
didn't know, huh?

775
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:18,525
The whole town's buzzin'
about the prince...

776
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,029
gettin' himself hitched
this afternoon!

777
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:24,364
You know,
he's getting married.

778
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:28,535
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.

779
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,455
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it!

780
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,805
Well, now, Eric.

781
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:51,433
It appears that
I was mistaken.

782
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,605
This mystery maiden of yours
does, in fact, exist.

783
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:59,525
A-And she is lovely.

784
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,027
Congratulations, my dear.

785
01:05:02,152 --> 01:05:04,988
We wish to be married
as soon as possible.

786
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:09,076
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but,
these things do take time, you know.

787
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:12,830
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.

788
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:17,960
Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric,
uh, as you wish.

789
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,020
<i>What a lovely little
bride I'll make</i>

790
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:21,023
<i>My dear
I'll look divine</i>

791
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:28,030
<i>Things are working out
according to my ultimate design</i>

792
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:36,371
<i>Soon I'll have that little mermaid
And the ocean will be mine</i>

793
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:44,421
The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna-- I gotta--

794
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:47,341
Ariel!

795
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:50,511
Ariel!

796
01:06:50,636 --> 01:06:53,514
Ariel, I was flying--
I was--

797
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:58,227
Of course I was flying,
and I-I saw the-- the watch--

798
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:01,063
The witch was watchin'
the mirror...

799
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:03,524
and she was singing
with a stolen set of pipes.

800
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:06,318
Do you hear what
I'm tellin' you?

801
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:11,782
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

802
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:15,035
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

803
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,120
I mean,
when it's important?

804
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:19,706
What are we gonna do?

805
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:23,502
Before the sun sets
on the third day.

806
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:33,345
Ariel, grab onto that.

807
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,723
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

808
01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:38,725
I'll try!

809
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:41,395
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

810
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,564
- Wh-What about me? What about me?
- You!

811
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:46,984
Find a way to
stall that wedding!

812
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:48,986
Stall the wedding.
W-What am I...?

813
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:51,822
What...? That's it!

814
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:05,502
Move it! Let's go!
We got an emergency here.

815
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:19,433
Dearly beloved--

816
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:24,855
Don't worry, Ariel.
We-We're gonna make it.

817
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:26,857
We're--
We're almost there.

818
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:30,819
Yes, um, do you, Eric,
take Vanessa...

819
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:34,114
to be your lawfully
wedded wife...

820
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,825
for as long as
you both shall live?

821
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:39,119
I do.

822
01:08:39,244 --> 01:08:41,121
It being--
And do you--

823
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:51,465
Oh!

824
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,183
Then by the power--

825
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,352
Get away from me,
you slimy little--

826
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:18,951
Oh, why, you little--

827
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:32,172
Huh? Ahh. Huh?

828
01:09:40,973 --> 01:09:43,225
- Ariel?
- Eric!

829
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:47,312
You-- You can talk?

830
01:09:47,521 --> 01:09:50,524
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

831
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:54,987
- It-It was you all the time.
- Oh, Eric, I-I wanted to tell you.

832
01:09:55,112 --> 01:09:56,905
Eric, no!

833
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:00,409
You're too late!

834
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:04,746
You're too late!

835
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:16,300
- So long, lover boy.
- Ariel!

836
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:17,926
Poor little princess.

837
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:20,929
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to--

838
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:24,266
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

839
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:29,688
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

840
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:33,275
- Let her go!
- Not a chance, Triton! She's mine now!

841
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:36,528
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I--

842
01:10:36,653 --> 01:10:40,073
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!

843
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:48,248
You see? The contract's legal,
binding and completely unbreakable...

844
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:50,250
even for you.

845
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:55,881
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

846
01:10:56,006 --> 01:11:01,220
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

847
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:05,516
But I might be willing
to make an exchange...

848
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:09,520
for someone even better.

849
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:12,856
- Eric, what are you doing?
- Grim, I lost her once.

850
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:15,108
I'm not gonna lose her again!

851
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:19,780
Now, do we have a deal?

852
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:25,410
Ha! It's done then!

853
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:30,499
No! Oh, no!

854
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:41,176
Your Majesty.

855
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:42,511
Daddy.

856
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:47,099
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

857
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:53,564
You!

858
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:57,067
- You monster!
- Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

859
01:11:57,234 --> 01:12:00,070
Contract or no,
I'll blast-- Ow!

860
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:02,739
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

861
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:04,741
After him!

862
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,293
Come on!

863
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,295
Ow!

864
01:12:18,589 --> 01:12:21,842
Say good-bye
to your sweetheart.

865
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,760
Aah!

866
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:31,310
Babies! My poor
little poopsies.

867
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:44,114
Eric, you've gotta
get away from here.

868
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:46,450
No, I won't leave you.

869
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,931
You pitiful,
insignificant fools!

870
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:10,933
Look out!

871
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:15,604
Now I am the ruler
of all the ocean!

872
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:19,316
The waves obey
my every whim!

873
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:21,985
Eric!

874
01:13:23,654 --> 01:13:29,243
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

875
01:13:48,053 --> 01:13:49,930
Eric!

876
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:27,634
So much for true love!

877
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,154
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

878
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:35,369
Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty.

879
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:40,165
Children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

880
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,167
You always say that?

881
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:49,383
Then I guess there's
just one problem left.

882
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:51,593
And what's that,
Your Majesty?

883
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,264
How much I'm going
to miss her.

884
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:56,533
Aha!

885
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:10,255
Yes! Thank you. Thank you.

886
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:21,892
I love you, Daddy.

887
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:26,188
<i>Now we can waIk
Now we can run</i>

888
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:31,693
<i>Now we can stay
all day in the sun</i>

889
01:17:32,903 --> 01:17:37,282
<i>Just you and me</i>

890
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:41,787
<i>And I can be</i>

891
01:17:41,912 --> 01:17:48,460
<i>Part of your world</i>
