1
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:45,767
Now remember keep
your shoulders back.

2
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:57,403
Okay put your arm
around your brother. That's it.

3
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:59,457
That's it.
Right and breathe in.

4
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,117
Okay one more.

5
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:09,707
Now just to review

6
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,210
you're going to follow
along the procession...

7
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:15,223
until you get
to the headmaster.

8
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,882
At that point
he will indicate to you...

9
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,051
to light the candles
of the boys.

10
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:22,720
All right boys
let's settle down.

11
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,105
Banners up!

12
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:26,868
Ladies and gentlemen
boys...

13
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,870
the Light of Knowledge.

14
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:48,900
One hundred years ago
in 1859

15
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:52,727
41 boys sat in this room...

16
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,313
and were asked
the same question...

17
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:58,576
that now greets you
at the start of each semester.

18
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,487
Gentlemen
what are the Four Pillars?

19
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:09,744
Tradition. Honour.
Discipline. Excellence.

20
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:13,091
In her first year

21
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:17,251
Welton Academy graduated
five students.

22
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:20,265
Last year
we graduated 51.

23
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:23,382
And more than 75 percent
of those...

24
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:26,229
went on to the Ivy League.

25
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:31,057
This- This kind
of accomplishment...

26
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:33,111
is the result...

27
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:38,106
of fervent dedication
to the principles taught here.

28
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,609
This is why you parents
have been sending us your sons.

29
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:44,737
This is why
we are the best...

30
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,865
preparatory school
in the United States.

31
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:58,543
As you know

32
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:03,673
our beloved Mr Portius of the
English Department retired last term.

33
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:07,635
You will have the opportunity later to
meet his replacement Mr John Keating

34
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:12,640
himself an honours graduate
of this school.

35
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:15,309
And who for the past several years
has been teaching...

36
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:17,645
at the highly regarded
Chester School in London.

37
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,445
Richard you forgot your bag!

38
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:27,697
Hi Johnny!
Hey how you doin'?

39
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,543
Don't worry.
I got your room assignment.

40
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,891
They haven't moved
the dining area.

41
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:46,883
Glad you could come by.

42
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:50,011
- Thrilling ceremony
as usual Dr Nolan.
- You've been away too long.

43
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:52,013
- Hello Dr Nolan.
- Good to have you back.

44
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,265
- This is our youngest Todd.
- Mr Anderson.

45
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:57,977
You have some big shoes to fill.
Your brother was one of our finest.

46
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:01,105
Thank you.

47
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,150
- Lovely ceremony.
- Thank you. Glad you liked it.

48
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:06,152
- Gale.
- Tom.

49
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:08,154
- Good to see you again.
- Hello Mr Nolan.

50
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:11,418
- We expect great things
from you this year.
- Thank you sir.

51
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,409
Well he won't disappoint us.
Right Neil?

52
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,787
I'll do my best sir.

53
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,841
Hey come on son.

54
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,165
- Chin up.
- Okay.

55
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,635
- No tears now.
- Chin up.

56
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:22,679
- I don't want to go here.
- Honey I love you.

57
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:26,714
- I'll walk you over.
- You be a good boy. Do your lessons.

58
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:34,013
Hey! I hear
we're gonna be roommates.

59
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:36,682
- I'm Neil Perry.
- I'm Todd Anderson.

60
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,851
Why'd you leave Balincrest?

61
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,853
My brother went here.

62
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:42,907
Oh so you're
that Anderson.

63
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:45,191
- This is for his sinuses.
- Yes. I see.

64
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:48,538
Oh and if he can't swallow
you give him one of these.

65
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,541
And if he has trouble breathing
you can give him some of those.

66
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:54,992
- Did you remember your vaporizer?
- Yes I put it in my room.

67
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,625
- Hey how's it going Neil?
- Hey Knox.

68
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,472
Neil study group tonight?

69
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:08,131
- Yeah sure.
- Business as usual huh?

70
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,977
Hey I heard you got the new kid.
Looks like a stiff!

71
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:13,897
Oops.

72
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,641
Listen don't mind Cameron.

73
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:23,312
He was born with his foot in his mouth.
You know what I mean?

74
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:29,110
Rumour has it...
you did summer school.

75
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:32,321
Yep. Chemistry. My father
thought I should get ahead.

76
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:34,323
How was your summer slick?

77
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,242
Keen.

78
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,954
Meeks. Door. Closed.

79
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:42,206
Yes sir.

80
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,500
Gentlemen what are
the Four Pillars?

81
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:49,338
Travesty. Horror.
Decadence. Excrement.

82
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:52,185
Okay. Study group.

83
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:55,188
Meeks aced Latin.
I didn't quite flunk English.

84
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,680
- If you want we got our study group.
- Sure.

85
00:06:57,774 --> 00:07:00,016
Cameron asked me too.
Anyone mind including him?

86
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,643
Hmm what's his specialty?
Bootlicking?

87
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:04,896
- Come on he's your roommate.
- That's not my fault.

88
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:09,484
I'm sorry. My name is Stephen Meeks.

89
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:11,652
Oh!
This is Todd Anderson.

90
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:13,654
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:16,157
Charlie Dalton.

92
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,701
Knox Overstreet.

93
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:20,703
Todd's brother was
Jeffrey Anderson.

94
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:22,997
- Oh yeah sure.
- What do you know?

95
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:26,959
- Valedictorian. National Merit Scholar.
- Oh well...

96
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,170
welcome to Hell- ton.

97
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:33,309
It's every bit as tough as they say
unless you're a genius like Meeks.

98
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:35,843
He flatters me.
That's why I help him with Latin.

99
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:38,857
And English. And trig.

100
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,974
It's open.

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,355
Father I thought you'd gone.

102
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,149
- Mr Perry.
- Keep your seats fellows.

103
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:54,028
Neil I've just spoken
to Mr Nolan.

104
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:57,375
You're taking too many extracurricular
activities this semester

105
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:00,326
and I've decided that
you should drop the school annual.

106
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,245
But I'm the assistant editor
this year.

107
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,998
- Well I'm sorry Neil.
- But Father I can't.

108
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:10,002
- It wouldn't be fair.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?

109
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:24,142
Don't you ever dispute me in public.
Do you understand?

110
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,644
- Father I wasn't disputing- -
- After you've finished medical school...

111
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,813
and you're on your own
then you can do as you damn well please.

112
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:32,160
But until then you do as I tell you.
Is that clear?

113
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,819
Yes sir.
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,042
You know how much this means
to your mother don't you?

115
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,325
Yes sir.

116
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,496
You know me:
always taking on too much.

117
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,166
Well that's my boy.

118
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,170
- You need anything you let us know.
- Yes sir.

119
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:04,223
Why doesn't he
let you do what you want?

120
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:07,602
Yeah Neil. Tell him off.
Couldn't get any worse.

121
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:09,604
Oh that's rich.
Like you guys tell your parents off?

122
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:11,606
Mr Future Lawyer
and Mr Future Banker?

123
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,275
Okay so I don't like it
any more than you do.

124
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,486
Well just don't tell me
how to talk to my father.

125
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,499
- You guys are the same way.
- All right all right.Jesus.

126
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:21,699
- So what are you gonna do then?
- What I have to do.

127
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:25,286
- Drop the annual.
- I wouldn't lose much sleep over it.

128
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,872
It's just a bunch of jerks
trying to impress Nolan.

129
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't care. I don't
give a damn about any of it.

130
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:34,837
- Well uh... Latin 8:00 in my room?
- Yes.

131
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:37,965
- That sounds okay.
- Todd you're welcome to join us.

132
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:40,510
- Yeah come along pal.
- Thanks.

133
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:20,883
Slow down boys!

134
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:25,388
Slow down you horrible
phalanx of pubescence!

135
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:29,392
Pick three laboratory experiments
from the project list...

136
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:33,229
and report on them
every five weeks.

137
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:37,733
The first 20 questions at the end
of chapter one are due tomorrow.

138
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:41,863
- Agricolam.
- Agricolam.

139
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,865
- Agricola.
- Agricola.

140
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,242
- Agricolae.
- Agricolae.

141
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:49,089
- Agricolarum.
- Agricolarum.

142
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,414
- Agricolis.
- Agricolis.

143
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:53,583
- Agricolas.
- Agricolas.

144
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:55,918
- Agricolis.
- Agricolis.

145
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:58,880
- Again please. Agricola.
- Agricola.

146
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:04,729
Your study of trigonometry
requires absolute precision.

147
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:09,557
Anyone failing to turn in
any homework assignment...

148
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:14,729
will be penalized one point
off their final grade.

149
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:18,691
Let me urge you now not
to test me on this point.

150
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:32,413
Hey Spaz. Spaz.

151
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:35,082
Brain damage!

152
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:38,753
- Shh!

153
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:59,117
Well come on.

154
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,544
- Let's go.
- Let's go guys.

155
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:14,914
Let's go.

156
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,895
"O Captain my Captain."

157
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:41,159
Who knows
where that comes from?

158
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:42,900
Anybody?

159
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:49,407
Not a clue?

160
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:53,411
It's from a poem by Walt Whitman
about Mr Abraham Lincoln.

161
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:56,591
Now in this class you can
either call me Mr Keating...

162
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,668
or if you're slightly more daring
"O Captain my Captain."

163
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:07,519
Now let me dispel a few rumours
so they don't fester into facts.

164
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:11,345
Yes I too attended Hell- ton
and survived.

165
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:15,516
And no at that time I was not
the mental giant you see before you.

166
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,187
I was the intellectual equivalent
of a 98- pound weakling.

167
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,191
I would go to the beach and people
would kick copies of Byron in my face.

168
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:32,043
Now... Mr Pitts?

169
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,202
That's a rather
unfortunate name.

170
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,705
Mr Pitts where are you?

171
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,210
Mr Pitts would you open
your hymnal to page 542.

172
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:45,390
Read the first stanza
of the poem you find there.

173
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:50,551
"To the Virgins
to Make Much of Time"?

174
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:53,846
Yes that's the one.

175
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,724
Somewhat appropriate isn't it?

176
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:59,393
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.

177
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,395
"Old Time is still a- flying.

178
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:04,899
And this same flower that smiles today
tomorrow will be dying."

179
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:08,027
Thank you Mr Pitts.

180
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:11,207
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."

181
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:15,034
The Latin term for that sentiment
is "Carpe diem. "

182
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:17,411
Now who knows what that means?

183
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,249
Carpe diem.
That's "Seize the day."

184
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,251
- Very good Mister- -
- Meeks.

185
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:26,598
Meeks.
Another unusual name.

186
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:28,881
Seize the day.

187
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:32,552
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."

188
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:34,929
Why does the writer
use these lines?

189
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,859
- Because he's in a hurry.
- No! Ding!

190
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,184
Thank you
for playing anyway.

191
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:45,731
Because we are food
for worms lads.

192
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,609
Because believe it or not
each and every one of us in this room...

193
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:54,125
is one day going to stop breathing
turn cold and die.

194
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:58,578
I would like you
to step forward over here...

195
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:01,247
and peruse some of the faces
from the past.

196
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:05,668
You've walked past them
many times. I don't think
you've really looked at them.

197
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,062
They're not that different
from you are they?

198
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,815
Same haircuts.

199
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:20,016
Full of hormones
just like you.

200
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,532
Invincible just like you feel.
The world is their oyster.

201
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,733
They believe they're destined for
great things just like many of you.

202
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,068
Their eyes are full of hope
just like you.

203
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,832
Did they wait
until it was too late...

204
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:37,366
to make from their lives even one iota
of what they were capable?

205
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,538
Because you see gentlemen these
boys are now fertilizing daffodils.

206
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,178
But if you listen
real close...

207
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:50,181
you can hear them whisper
their legacy to you.

208
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,173
Go on lean in.

209
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:57,887
Listen.
Do you hear it?

210
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,521
Carpe.

211
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,870
Hear it?

212
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:17,292
Carpe.

213
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:22,714
Carpe diem.

214
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:27,542
Seize the day boys.

215
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:33,141
Make your lives
extraordinary.

216
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:49,240
- That was weird.
- But different.

217
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,899
Spooky if you ask me.

218
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,068
Think he'll test us
on that stuff?

219
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:57,248
Oh come on Cameron.
Don't you get anything?

220
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:59,407
What? What?

221
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,496
Let's go boys. Hustle up in here.
That means you Dalton!

222
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,832
Who's up for a quick
study group tonight guys?

223
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,001
- Me.
- What?

224
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,504
I can't make it guys. I have to have
dinner at the Danburrys' house tonight.

225
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,506
The Danburrys?
Who are the Danburrys?

226
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,508
Big alums.
How'd you swing that?

227
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,011
Friends of my dad's. They're probably
in their nineties or something.

228
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,512
Ooh!

229
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:24,015
Anything's better
than Hell- ton hash Knox.

230
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,684
- I'll second that.
- Yeah we'll see.

231
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:30,521
You coming to the study group tonight?

232
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:34,525
Uh... no. No I- -
Uh I've got some history I wanna do.

233
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,372
Suit yourself.

234
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:12,313
Ready Overstreet?

235
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,692
Ready to go sir.

236
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,011
Chet can you get that?

237
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,180
- I can't Mom.
- I'll get it!

238
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:54,188
Can I help you?

239
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:57,859
Hi. Knox Overstreet.

240
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:01,696
- Uh Dr Hager.
- Hi.

241
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,666
This is the Danburrys'
right?

242
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,034
- Are you here to see Chet?
- Mrs Danburry?

243
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:11,205
- No.
- Sorry. Thank you. I'm Mrs Danburry.

244
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,207
- You must be Knox.
- Yes.

245
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:16,054
Back by 9:00?
Please come on in.

246
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:18,045
- Chris come on!
- Chet I'm coming.

247
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,506
Knox. How are you?
Joe Danburry.

248
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,353
- Nice to meet you sir.
- He's the spitting image of his father.

249
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:25,344
- How is he? Come on in.
- Chris!

250
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:28,014
- Great. He just did a big case for G.M.
- I know where you're headed.

251
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,433
- I'm coming.
- Like father like son huh?

252
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:34,072
Ooh! Psycho!

253
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:36,647
- Yes!
- To Queen- Six.

254
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,358
- Another game?
- What do you mean?
- Duh!

255
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:42,706
just replace these numbers here
with 'x "for 'x"and 'y. "

256
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:45,323
- Of course.
- Of course. So what's the problem?

257
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,086
You think I can get in there?
You've been hogging it all day.

258
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,244
- Wait. No.
- How was dinner?

259
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:52,371
Huh?

260
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:56,125
- How was dinner?
- Terrible.

261
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:01,214
- Awful.
- Why? What happened?

262
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:08,721
Tonight I met
the most beautiful girl...

263
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,224
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

264
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:14,018
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with that?

265
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,241
She's practically engaged
to Chet Danburry.

266
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:19,951
That guy could eat a football.

267
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,110
- Too bad.
- "Too bad"?

268
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:24,737
It's worse than "too bad"
Pittsie. It's a tragedy.

269
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:27,584
A girl this beautiful
in love with such a jerk.

270
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,118
All the good ones go for jerks.
You know that.

271
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:32,745
Yeah forget her. Open your trig book
and try and figure out problem five.

272
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,248
I can't just forget her Cameron.

273
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:38,209
And I certainly
can't think about trig.

274
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,461
We got it!

275
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:43,308
All right gentlemen.
Five minutes.

276
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,800
Let's go.

277
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:49,595
- Did you see her naked?
- Very funny Dalton.

278
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:52,640
That wouldn't be a radio in your lap

279
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:57,145
- would it Mr Pitts?
- No sir. Science experiment.

280
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:59,313
Radar.

281
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:08,698
Gentlemen open your text
to page 21 of the introduction.

282
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,201
Mr Perry will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface

283
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,454
entitled
"Understanding Poetry."

284
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,543
"'Understand Poetry'
by Dr J. Evans Pritchard Ph.D.

285
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:23,390
"To fully understand poetry
we must first be fluent...

286
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:26,393
"with its metre rhyme
and figures of speech.

287
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:28,384
"Then ask two questions.

288
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,720
"One.: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

289
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:34,307
'And two.: How important
is that objective?

290
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,309
"Question one rates
the poem's perfection.

291
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,394
"Question two rates
its importance.

292
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,897
'And once these questions
have been answered...

293
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,400
"determining a poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

294
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:47,069
"If the poem's score
for perfection is plotted...

295
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:49,238
"on the horizontal
of a graph...

296
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:52,742
"and its importance
is plotted on the vertical

297
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:56,089
"then calculating
the total area of the poem...

298
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:58,873
"yields the measure
of its greatness.

299
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:06,714
"A sonnet by Byron might
score high on the vertical

300
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:09,728
"but only average
on the horizontal.

301
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:13,012
'A Shakespearean sonnet
on the other hand

302
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:16,443
"would score high both
horizontally and vertically

303
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:18,434
'yielding
a massive total area;:

304
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:21,865
"thereby revealing
the poem to be truly great.

305
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:26,734
'As you proceed through the poetry in
this book practise this rating method.

306
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:29,529
'As your ability to evaluate
poems in this manner grows

307
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:35,409
so will- - so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry."

308
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:41,749
Excrement.

309
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,546
That's what I think
of Mr J. Evans Pritchard.

310
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:49,757
We're not laying pipe.
We're talking about poetry.

311
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:53,104
I mean how can you describe poetry
like American Bandstand?

312
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:58,057
"I like Byron. I give him a 42.
But I can't dance to it."

313
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,237
Now I want you
to rip out that page.

314
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:04,689
Go on.
Rip out the entire page.

315
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,902
You heard me.
Rip it out.

316
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:12,447
Rip it out!

317
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,657
Go on.
Rip it out.

318
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:18,453
Thank you Mr Dalton.

319
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:20,538
Gentlemen tell you what.
Don't just tear out that page.

320
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,460
Tear out the entire introduction.
I want it gone history. Leave nothing.

321
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:29,849
Rip it out! Rip! Be gone
J. Evans Pritchard Ph.D.!

322
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:32,383
Rip! Shred! Tear!

323
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,480
Rip it out! I want to hear nothing
but ripping of Mr Pritchard!

324
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:38,316
We'll perforate it put it on a roll!

325
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,808
It's not the Bible.
You're not gonna go to hell for this.

326
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:46,814
Go on. Make a clean tear.
I want nothing left of it.

327
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:49,275
We shouldn't be doing this.

328
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,819
Rip! Rip! Rip!

329
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:53,821
Rip it out! Rip!

330
00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:02,121
Rip it! Yeah! Rip it out!

331
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:08,722
- Rip it!
- What the hell is going on here?

332
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:13,674
- I don't hear enough rips.
- Mr Keating.

333
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:16,135
Mr McAllister.

334
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:20,723
I'm sorry I- -
I didn't know you were here.

335
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:26,687
- I am.
- Ah. So you are.

336
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,856
Excuse me.

337
00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:32,902
Keep ripping gentlemen.

338
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:35,696
This is a battle a war.

339
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,865
And the casualties could be
your hearts and souls.

340
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,867
Thank you Mr Dalton.

341
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:43,048
Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry.

342
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,039
No! We will not
have that here.

343
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,041
No more
of MrJ. Evans Pritchard.

344
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:50,388
Now my class you will learn
to think for yourselves again.

345
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:54,006
You will learn
to savour words and language.

346
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,384
No matter what
anybody tells you

347
00:24:56,478 --> 00:25:00,221
words and ideas
can change the world.

348
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,682
I see that look
in Mr Pitts' eye...

349
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:05,017
like 19th century literature
has nothing to do...

350
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:07,019
with going to business school
or medical school.

351
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:09,021
Right? Maybe.

352
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:11,190
Mr Hopkins you may agree
with him thinking

353
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:14,537
"Yes we should simply study
our Mr Pritchard...

354
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:17,540
"and learn our rhyme and metre
and go quietly about the business...

355
00:25:17,624 --> 00:25:20,710
of achieving other ambitions."

356
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:23,713
I have a little secret for you.
Huddle up.

357
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,705
Huddle up!

358
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,049
We don't read and write
poetry because it's cute.

359
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:41,888
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.

360
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:46,726
And the human race
is filled with passion.

361
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,395
Medicine law
business engineering:

362
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:52,659
these are noble pursuits
and necessary to sustain life.

363
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:55,234
But poetry

364
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:59,405
beauty romance love- -

365
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:02,074
these are what
we stay alive for.

366
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:05,005
To quote from Whitman.:

367
00:26:05,088 --> 00:26:09,134
"O me O life of the questions
of these recurring.

368
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:12,303
"Of the endless trains
of the faithless.

369
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:15,306
"Of cities filled
with the foolish.

370
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,674
"What good amid these
O me O life?

371
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:22,678
"Answer:
That you are here.

372
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:26,849
"That life exists
and identity.

373
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:29,352
"That the powerful play
goes on

374
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:32,021
and you may contribute
a verse."

375
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:36,786
"That the powerful play
goes on

376
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,696
and you may contribute
a verse. "

377
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:46,410
What will your verse be?

378
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:53,209
For what we are
about to receive

379
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:56,389
may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

380
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:58,381
Amen.

381
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,864
Quite an interesting class
you gave today Mr Keating.

382
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:15,867
- Sorry if I shocked you Mr McAllister.
- There's no need to apologise.

383
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,037
It was very fascinating
misguided though it was.

384
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,028
You think so?

385
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:24,376
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artistsJohn.

386
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:28,202
When they realize that they're
not Rembrandts Shakespeares or Mozarts

387
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,871
they'll hate you for it.

388
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:33,374
We're not talking artists George.
We're talking freethinkers.

389
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:35,877
Freethinkers at 17?

390
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,879
Funny I never pegged you
as a cynic.

391
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:43,009
Not a cynic.

392
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:45,063
A realist.

393
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:49,223
"Show me the heart unfettered
by foolish dreams

394
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,517
and I'll show you
a happy man."

395
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:55,229
"But only in their dreams
can men be truly free.

396
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:58,274
'Twas always thus
and always thus will be."

397
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:00,401
Tennyson?

398
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:02,653
No. Keating.

399
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:10,077
Hey I found his senior
annual in the library.

400
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,206
Listen to this.
Captain of the soccer team.

401
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:16,219
Editor of the school annual.
Cambridge bound.

402
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:19,472
Thigh man
and the Dead Poets Society.

403
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:22,256
"Man Most Likely
To Do Anything."

404
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,718
Thigh man?
Mr "K" was a hell- raiser.

405
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:28,513
What's the Dead Poets Society?

406
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,515
- I don't know.
- Is there a picture in the annual?

407
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,517
- Nothing. No other mention of it.
- That boy there

408
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,519
see me after lunch.

409
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,024
Mr Keating?

410
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,819
Mr Keating?

411
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:45,446
Sir?

412
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,293
- Say something.
- O Captain my Captain?

413
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,868
Gentlemen.

414
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,539
We were just looking
in your old annual.

415
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,916
Oh my God.

416
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,378
No that's not me.

417
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,423
Stanley "The Tool" Wilson.

418
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:09,595
- God.
- What was the Dead Poets Society?

419
00:29:13,943 --> 00:29:17,478
I doubt the present administration
would look too favourably upon that.

420
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:20,241
Why?
What was it?

421
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:27,290
- Gentlemen can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

422
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:35,173
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.

423
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:38,510
That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke
at the beginning of every meeting.

424
00:29:38,593 --> 00:29:41,169
You see we would gather
at the old Indian cave...

425
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:45,809
and take turns reading from Thoreau
Whitman Shelley- - the biggies.

426
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:47,686
Even some of our own verse.

427
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:51,387
And in the enchantment of the moment
we'd let poetry work its magic.

428
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:54,682
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around reading poetry?

429
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:57,696
No Mr Overstreet.
It wasn't just guys.

430
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,032
We weren't a Greek organization.
We were romantics.

431
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:06,152
We didn't just read poetry we let it
drip from our tongues like honey.

432
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:10,875
Spirits soared women swooned
and gods were created gentlemen.

433
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,409
Not a bad way
to spend an evening eh?

434
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:14,827
Hmm.

435
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:17,705
Thank you Mr Perry
for this stroll down amnesia lane.

436
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,832
Burn that.

437
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:22,710
Especially my picture.

438
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:28,226
Dead Poets Society.

439
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:30,270
What?

440
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,390
- I say we go tonight.
- Tonight?

441
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:38,559
- Wait a minute.
- Everybody in?

442
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,728
- Where's this cave he's talking about?
- It's beyond the stream.

443
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:43,231
- I know where it is.
- That's miles.

444
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:46,526
- Sounds boring to me.
- Don't go.

445
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:49,070
- You know how many
demerits we're talking?
- So don't come. Please.

446
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:51,572
Look all I'm saying
is that we have to be careful.

447
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:54,784
- We can't get caught.
- No shit Sherlock.

448
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:57,745
You boys there!
Hurry up!

449
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,925
- All right who's in?
- Aw come on Neil. Hager's- -

450
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,377
Forget Hager! No!
Who's in?

451
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:06,295
I'm in.

452
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:10,091
I'm warning you! Move!

453
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:11,300
Me too.

454
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:13,761
- I don't know Neil.
- What? Pitts!

455
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:15,763
- Pittsie come on.
- His grades are hurting.

456
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:18,558
- You can help him Meeks.
- What is this a midnight study group?

457
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:21,404
Forget it Pitts. You're coming.
Meeks your grades hurting too?

458
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,813
- I'll try anything once.
- Except sex.

459
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:26,232
- Ha ha ha.
- I'm in as long as we're careful.

460
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:28,901
- What about you Knox?
- I don't know Charlie.

461
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:31,070
Come on Knox.
It'll help you get Chris.

462
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:33,072
Yeah? How?

463
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:36,909
- Women swoon.
- But why do they swoon?

464
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:40,455
Charlie tell me why they swoon!
Charlie!

465
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:45,460
Okay
follow the stream to the waterfall.

466
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:47,462
It's right there.
It's got to be on the banks.

467
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,464
I don't know.
This is starting to sound dangerous.

468
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:52,967
- Oh well why don't you stay home?
- Hey you're crazy.

469
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:56,929
For God's sake
stop chattering and sit down.

470
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:06,647
- Todd are you coming tonight?
- No.

471
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,816
Why not? God you were there.
You heard Keating.

472
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,277
- Don't you want
to do something about that?
- Yes.

473
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:15,667
- But- -
- But? But what?

474
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,204
Keating said that everybody
took turns reading

475
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:24,050
and I don't want to do that.

476
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:26,292
Gosh you really have
a problem with that don't you?

477
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:30,880
N- No I don't have a problem.

478
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:34,310
Neil I just- -
I don't want to do it okay?

479
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,886
All right.

480
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,556
What if you didn't have to read?
What if you just came and listened?

481
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,737
- That's not how it works.
- Well forget how it works.

482
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,730
What if- -
What if they said it was okay?

483
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:50,691
What- - What are you gonna
go up and ask them?

484
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:53,538
No.
No Neil.

485
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,822
- I'll be right back.
- Neil. Neil!

486
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:01,921
Oh shut up will you?

487
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:06,040
That's for my asthma okay?

488
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:08,709
Could you give that back please?

489
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:10,711
What's the matter?
Don't you like snakes?

490
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,880
- You're in.
- Get away from me okay?

491
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:16,384
- Why don't you check your pocket huh?

492
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:20,221
- Come on. I have to brush my teeth.
- Get a- - Get off.

493
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:24,225
- Cut out that racket in there!

494
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:30,708
Go. Go.

495
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:06,596
- I'm a dead poet!
- Aw shit Charlie.

496
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,558
- Guys! Over here!
- Funny. You're real funny.

497
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:12,685
It's too wet.

498
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,687
God are you trying
to smoke us out of here?

499
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,856
No no. The smoke's
going right up this opening.

500
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:22,695
You okay?

501
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,198
Oh God. Clowns.

502
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,867
All right forget the fire.

503
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:31,047
Let's go gentlemen.

504
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:35,176
- I hereby reconvene
the Dead Poets Society

505
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,543
Welton Chapter.

506
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:39,545
The meetings will be
conducted by myself...

507
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,714
and the other
new initiates now present.

508
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:43,841
Todd Anderson because
he prefers not to read

509
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,427
will keep minutes
of the meetings.

510
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:49,555
I'll now read
the traditional opening message...

511
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:51,557
by Society member
Henry David Thoreau.

512
00:36:51,651 --> 00:36:54,571
"I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately.

513
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:57,323
I wanted to live deep and suck
out all the marrow of life."

514
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:58,981
I'll second that.

515
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:01,567
"To put to rout
all that was not life.

516
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:03,486
"And not
when I had come to die

517
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,947
discover
that I had not lived."

518
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:12,630
- Keating's marked
a bunch of other pages.
- All right intermission!

519
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:14,831
Dig deep. Right here.
Right here lay it down.

520
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:16,999
On the mud? We're gonna
put our food on the mud?

521
00:37:17,093 --> 00:37:19,335
Meeks put your coat down.
Picnic blanket.

522
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:22,349
Use Meeks' coat.

523
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:24,340
Don't keep anything back either.

524
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:27,187
- You guys are always bumming my smokes.
- Raisins?

525
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,178
- Yuck.
- Wait a minute!

526
00:37:29,272 --> 00:37:32,359
- Who gave us half a roll?
- I'm eating the other half.

527
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:35,226
- Come on!
- What you want me to put it back?

528
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,354
It was a dark and rainy night
and this old lady

529
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:40,690
who had a passion
for jigsaw puzzles

530
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:45,330
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.

531
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,197
But as she pieced
the puzzle together

532
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:50,199
she realized
to her astonishment

533
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:53,703
that the image that was formed
was her very own room.

534
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,038
And the figure
in the centre of the puzzle

535
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:58,708
as she completed it
was herself.

536
00:37:58,802 --> 00:38:02,847
And with trembling hands
she placed the last four pieces...

537
00:38:02,931 --> 00:38:08,009
and stared in horror at the face
of a demented madman at the window.

538
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:12,013
The last thing that
this old lady ever heard...

539
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:14,859
- was the sound of breaking glass.
- No she didn't.

540
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:17,696
Yes this is true. This is true.

541
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:20,354
I've got one that's better than that.

542
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,774
I do. There's a young
married couple

543
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,359
and they're driving through the forest
at night on a long trip.

544
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:28,029
And they run out of gas
and there's a madman on the- -

545
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:29,530
The thing with the hand?

546
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:31,532
I love that story!

547
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,534
- I told you that one.
- You did not.

548
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:35,703
- I got that in camp in sixth grade.
- Last year?

549
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:37,872
"In a mean abode
in the Shanking Road

550
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,874
"lived a man named
William Bloat.

551
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:42,043
"Now he had a wife
the plague of his life

552
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:44,212
"who continually
got his goat.

553
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:46,714
"And one day at dawn
with her nightshift on

554
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:49,050
he slit
her bloody throat."

555
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:50,885
Oh and it gets worse.

556
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:53,221
You want to hear
a real poem?

557
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:55,389
- You want this?
- No I don't need- - Get this outta here.

558
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:57,391
- What did you bring one?
- You memorized a poem?

559
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:00,238
You memorized a poem?

560
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:02,647
- An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
- An original piece.

561
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,108
- Take centre stage.
- You know this is history right?

562
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:15,618
Wow. Whoa.

563
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,912
Where did you get that?

564
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:19,288
Where did you- -

565
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:22,333
- Whoa.
- "Teach me to love?

566
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,347
"Go teach thyself more wit.

567
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,672
"I chief professor am of it.

568
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:31,509
"The god of love
if such a thing there be

569
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,678
may learn to love from me."

570
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,763
Wow. Did you write that?

571
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,104
Abraham Cowley.

572
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:45,106
Okay.
Who's next?

573
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,525
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

574
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,694
"Come my friends.

575
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,707
"'Tis not too late
to seek a newer world.

576
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:56,367
"For my purpose holds
to sail beyond the sunset.

577
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,703
"And though we are not
now that strength...

578
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:02,540
"which in old days
moved Earth and heaven.

579
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,876
"That which we are we are:

580
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:09,046
"one equal temper
of heroic hearts...

581
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,050
"made weak by time and fate
but strong in will...

582
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:18,222
"to strive to seek to find

583
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,725
and not to yield."

584
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:24,572
"Then I had religion
then I had a vision.

585
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:27,064
"I could not turn from
their revel in derision.

586
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,734
"Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

587
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,664
cutting through the forest
with a golden track."

588
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:35,417
- Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black
- Meeks. Meeks.

589
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,909
cutting through the forest
with a golden track.

590
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,411
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

591
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:43,174
- cutting through the forest
with a golden track.

592
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:45,583
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

593
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,086
- cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

594
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,588
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

595
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:53,518
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

596
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,760
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

597
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:58,096
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

598
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,598
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

599
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,184
- cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

600
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:05,520
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

601
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:07,855
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

602
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:12,860
Cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

603
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:15,874
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black- -

604
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:27,208
A man is not "very tired. "
He is "exhausted. "

605
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:29,210
And don't use "very sad."
Use- -

606
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:31,546
Come on Mr Overstreet
you twerp.

607
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,049
- "Morose"?
- Exactly! Morose!

608
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:38,970
Language was developed for one
endeavour and that is- - Mr Anderson?

609
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,233
Come on
are you a man or an amoeba?

610
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,727
Mr Perry?

611
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,659
Uh... to communicate.

612
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,579
No! To woo women.

613
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,071
Today we're going to be talking...

614
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:59,918
- about William Shakespeare.
- Oh God.

615
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,909
I know. A lot of you
look forward to this...

616
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:04,370
about as much as you look forward
to root canal work.

617
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,456
We're gonna talk
about Shakespeare...

618
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:09,167
as someone who writes
something very interesting.

619
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,879
Now many of you have seen Shakespeare
done very much like this:

620
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:16,226
"O Titus bring your friend hither."

621
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:19,229
But if any of you have seen
Mr Marlon Brando

622
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:21,387
you know
that Shakespeare can be different.

623
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:25,558
"Friends Romans countrymen
lend me your ears."

624
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:30,897
You can also imagine maybe
John Wayne as Macbeth going...

625
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,942
"Well
is this a dagger I see before me?"

626
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:40,990
"Dogs sir?
Oh not just now.

627
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:45,244
"I do enjoy a good dog
once in a while sir.

628
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:48,748
"You can have yourself
a three- course meal from one dog.

629
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:52,971
"Start with a canine croquette.

630
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:54,962
"Go to your Fido Flambe
for main course.

631
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:57,924
'And for dessert
a Pekingese parfait.

632
00:42:58,018 --> 00:43:00,134
And you can pick your teeth
with the little paw. "

633
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:04,806
Why do I stand up here?

634
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:07,350
- Anybody?
- To feel taller.

635
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:09,352
No! Thank you for playing.

636
00:43:09,446 --> 00:43:11,979
I stand upon my desk...

637
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:17,193
to remind myself that we must constantly
look at things in a different way.

638
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:24,534
See the world looks
very different from up here.

639
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:26,661
You don't believe me?

640
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:30,206
Come see for yourselves.
Come on.

641
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,709
Come on. Just when you
think you know something

642
00:43:33,803 --> 00:43:35,711
you have to look at it
in another way.

643
00:43:35,805 --> 00:43:38,558
Even though it may seem
silly or wrong

644
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:40,550
you must try.

645
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:43,010
Now when you read don't just
consider what the author thinks.

646
00:43:43,104 --> 00:43:47,014
Consider what you think.

647
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:50,560
Boys you must strive
to find your own voice.

648
00:43:50,653 --> 00:43:52,562
Because the longer
you wait to begin

649
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:55,022
the less likely you are
to find it at all.

650
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:58,401
Thoreau said "Most men lead
lives of quiet desperation."

651
00:43:58,495 --> 00:44:02,029
Don't be resigned to that.
Break out.

652
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:05,408
Don't just walk off the edge
like lemmings. Look around you.

653
00:44:05,502 --> 00:44:08,202
There you go Mr Priske. Thank you!

654
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:10,371
Yes!

655
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:14,709
Dare to strike out
and find new ground.

656
00:44:14,803 --> 00:44:17,378
Now in addition to your essays

657
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:20,923
I would like you to compose
a poem of your own an original work.

658
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:25,563
Ooh!

659
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:27,722
That's right.

660
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:31,642
You have to deliver it aloud
in front of the class on Monday.

661
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,644
Bon chance gentlemen.

662
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:37,732
Mr Anderson.

663
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:42,904
Don't think I don't know this assignment
scares the hell out of you you mole.

664
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:58,878
Take a power train in two!

665
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:03,852
- Three keep your eyes in the boat!
- Stroke! Stroke!

666
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:06,260
Stroke! Stroke!

667
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:10,515
- We got it Pittsie.

668
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,976
Radio Free America!

669
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:17,021
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll

670
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:20,285
But movin'and a- groovin'
is gonna satisfy my soul

671
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:22,527
Let's have a party
Oooh

672
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,373
Let's have a party

673
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:28,543
Let's spin it to the soul
Let's rock and roll

674
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:31,379
Let's have a party tonight

675
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:34,215
I never kissed a bear
I never kissed a goose

676
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,374
But I can shake a chicken
in the middle of the room

677
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:38,376
- Let's have a party

678
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,714
- I found it.
- You found what?

679
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:47,062
What I want to do right now.
What's really really inside of me.

680
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:49,387
- "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
- This is it.

681
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:52,348
- What is that?
- It's a play dummy.

682
00:45:52,442 --> 00:45:54,976
I know that.
Wh- What does it have to do with you?

683
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,061
All right they're
putting it on at Henley Hall.

684
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:59,480
Open tryouts.
Open tryouts!

685
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:01,482
- Yeah so?
- So!

686
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:05,486
I'm gonna act.

687
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,666
Yes! Yes!
I'm gonna be an actor!

688
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,825
Ever since I can remember
I've wanted to try this!

689
00:46:10,919 --> 00:46:12,827
I even tried to go
to summer stock auditions last year

690
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:14,996
but of course
my father wouldn't let me.

691
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,499
For the first time in my whole life
I know what I want to do.

692
00:46:18,593 --> 00:46:21,169
And for
the first time I'm gonna do it...

693
00:46:21,262 --> 00:46:23,171
whether my father
wants me to or not!

694
00:46:23,264 --> 00:46:26,518
- Carpe diem!
- Neil Neil hold it.

695
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:30,052
How are you gonna be in a play
if your father won't let you?

696
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:32,847
First I gotta get the part
then I can worry about that.

697
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,349
But won't he kill you if he finds out
you went to an audition
and didn't tell him?

698
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:38,394
No no no. As far as I'm concerned
he won't have to know about any of this.

699
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:41,939
- Well that's impossible.
- Bullshit. Nothing's impossible.

700
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,703
Well why don't you just call him
and ask him and m- maybe he'll say yes.

701
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:47,361
That's a laugh.

702
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:50,709
If I don't ask him
at least I won't be disobeying him.

703
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:53,576
- Yeah but if he said no before- -
- Jesus Todd whose side are you on?

704
00:47:04,764 --> 00:47:08,018
I mean I haven't even
gotten the part yet.

705
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:12,147
Can't I even enjoy the idea
for a little while?

706
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:25,858
- You're coming to the meeting?
- I don't know. Maybe.

707
00:47:25,952 --> 00:47:30,363
Nothing Mr Keating has to say
means shit to you does it Todd?

708
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:32,698
- Wh- What is that supposed to mean?
- You're in the club!

709
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:35,159
Being in the club means
being stirred up by things.

710
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:37,161
You look about
as stirred up as a cesspool.

711
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:40,706
- So you want me out?
- No I want you in!

712
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,668
But being in means you gotta do
something not just say you're in.

713
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:46,879
Listen Neil I mean
I appreciate this concern

714
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:49,382
but I'm not like you
all right?

715
00:47:49,476 --> 00:47:52,729
You- - You- You say things
and people listen.

716
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:54,773
I- - I- I'm not like that.

717
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:56,931
- Don't you think you could be?
- No.

718
00:47:57,025 --> 00:47:59,944
I- - I- I don't know
but that's not the point.

719
00:48:00,028 --> 00:48:04,324
The point is there's nothing you can
do about it so you can just butt out.

720
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:06,774
I can take care
of myself just fine.

721
00:48:06,868 --> 00:48:08,985
All right?

722
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:12,989
No.

723
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:17,879
What do you mean "no"?

724
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:21,289
No.

725
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:23,458
Give me that!
Neil!

726
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,668
- Neil give that back!
- "We are dreaming of a tomorrow- - "

727
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:27,670
- It's poetry!
- Neil!

728
00:48:27,764 --> 00:48:30,173
I'm being chased by Walt Whitman!

729
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:32,341
Okay! Okay!

730
00:48:32,435 --> 00:48:35,188
What are you guys doing?
I'm trying- - You see this chemistry- -

731
00:48:35,271 --> 00:48:37,680
Hey. Give me- - Neil give me- -

732
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:39,682
Don't be immature. Come on!

733
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:42,351
- I need my- -
- Give it to me!

734
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:44,687
Charlie!

735
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:47,356
Let me have my book. I need my- -

736
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:20,575
Okay everybody on the bus.

737
00:50:20,669 --> 00:50:24,078
Let's go boys.

738
00:50:24,172 --> 00:50:26,330
Come on. Let's go. On the bus boys.

739
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:29,260
Now!

740
00:50:30,512 --> 00:50:32,253
Now devotees may argue...

741
00:50:32,347 --> 00:50:35,923
that one sport or game
is inherently better than another.

742
00:50:36,017 --> 00:50:38,770
For me sport
is actually a chance...

743
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:42,346
for us to have other human beings
push us to excel.

744
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,017
I want you all to come over here
and take a slip of paper...

745
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:48,947
and line up single file.

746
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,105
Mr Meeks
time to inherit the Earth.

747
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,109
Mr Pitts...
rise above your name.

748
00:50:55,203 --> 00:50:59,332
I want you to hand these out
to the boys one apiece.

749
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:03,034
You know what to do Pitts!

750
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:06,381
"Oh to struggle against great odds
to meet enemies undaunted."

751
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:09,551
Sounds like you're daunted.
Say it again like you're undaunted.

752
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:12,721
"Oh to struggle against great odds
to meet enemies undaunted"!

753
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:15,129
Now go on!

754
00:51:15,223 --> 00:51:17,381
Yes!
Next!

755
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:22,720
"To be a sailor of the world
bound for all ports."

756
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:25,223
Next.
Louder!

757
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:29,362
"Oh I live to be the ruler of life
not a slave."

758
00:51:29,446 --> 00:51:31,354
"To mount the scaffolds.

759
00:51:31,448 --> 00:51:34,649
To advance to the muzzles of guns
with perfect nonchalance. "

760
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:42,156
Come on Meeks!
Listen to the music!

761
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:46,244
"To dance clap hands
exalt shout skip

762
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:49,997
- roll on float on!"
- Yes!

763
00:51:51,384 --> 00:51:54,502
"Oh to have life henceforth
the poem of new joys."

764
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:58,923
Boo!

765
00:51:59,017 --> 00:52:01,384
Come on Charlie
let it fill your soul.

766
00:52:01,478 --> 00:52:03,845
"To indeed be a god!"

767
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:08,349
Charlie I got the part!

768
00:52:08,443 --> 00:52:10,351
I'm gonna play Puck!

769
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:12,353
- I'm gonna play Puck!
- What did he say?

770
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:14,355
- Puck you!
- The main part!

771
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:16,357
- Great Neil!
- Charlie I got it!

772
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:19,204
- Congratulations.
- Good for you! Good for you!

773
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:22,540
Okay okay okay okay.

774
00:52:22,624 --> 00:52:25,199
Neil how are you gonna do this?

775
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:29,203
They need a letter of permission
from my father and Mr Nolan.

776
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:31,873
- You're not gonna write it.
- Oh yes I am.

777
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:35,220
Oh Neil- - Neil you're crazy.

778
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:37,462
Okay.

779
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:41,215
I am writing to you...

780
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:44,396
on behalf of...

781
00:52:44,479 --> 00:52:47,232
my son...

782
00:52:47,315 --> 00:52:50,235
Neil Perry.

783
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,270
This is great!

784
00:53:44,258 --> 00:53:48,043
"To Chris."

785
00:53:48,136 --> 00:53:50,628
Who's Chris? Mmm Chris.

786
00:53:50,722 --> 00:53:53,757
"I see a sweetness
in her smile.

787
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,176
"Bright light shines
from her eyes.

788
00:53:58,188 --> 00:54:01,890
"But life is complete
contentment is mine...

789
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:05,570
"just knowing that- -

790
00:54:05,654 --> 00:54:09,105
"Just knowing that...

791
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:10,993
she's alive."

792
00:54:11,076 --> 00:54:14,194
- I'm sorry Captain. It's stupid.
- No. No it's not stupid.

793
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:18,208
It's a good effort. It touched on
one of the major themes: love.

794
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:21,326
A major theme
not only in poetry but life.

795
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,216
Mr Hopkins you were laughing.
You're up.

796
00:54:35,392 --> 00:54:39,177
"The cat sat on the mat."

797
00:54:44,943 --> 00:54:46,518
Congratulations Mr Hopkins.

798
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:49,239
Yours is the first poem to ever have
a negative score on the Pritchard scale.

799
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:52,857
We're not laughing at you
we're laughing near you.

800
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:55,527
I don't mind that your poem
had a simple theme.

801
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:57,862
Sometimes the most beautiful poetry
can be about simple things

802
00:54:57,956 --> 00:55:00,990
like a cat or a flower or rain.

803
00:55:01,084 --> 00:55:04,285
You see poetry can come from anything
with the stuff of revelation in it.

804
00:55:04,379 --> 00:55:06,538
Just don't let your poems
be ordinary.

805
00:55:08,634 --> 00:55:11,345
Now who's next?

806
00:55:12,596 --> 00:55:16,381
Mr Anderson I see you
sitting there in agony.

807
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:19,509
Come on Todd step up.
Let's put you out of your misery.

808
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:24,431
I- I didn't do it.
I didn't write a poem.

809
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,200
Mr Anderson thinks everything inside
of him is worthless and embarrassing.

810
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:37,861
Isn't that right Todd?
Isn't that your worst fear?

811
00:55:37,955 --> 00:55:40,530
Well I think you're wrong. I think
you have something inside of you...

812
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:43,627
that is worth a great deal.

813
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:47,245
"I sound...

814
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:52,636
"my barbaric...

815
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,628
"yawp...

816
00:55:58,433 --> 00:56:00,675
"over the rooftops...

817
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:03,230
of the world. "

818
00:56:05,524 --> 00:56:09,278
W.W.
Uncle Walt again.

819
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:13,855
Now for those of you who don't know
a yawp is a loud cry or yell.

820
00:56:13,949 --> 00:56:18,245
Now Todd I would like you to give us
a demonstration of a barbaric yawp.

821
00:56:18,328 --> 00:56:21,613
Come on you can't yawp sitting down.

822
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:23,917
Let's go.
Come on up.

823
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:28,005
Got to get in yawping stance.

824
00:56:28,088 --> 00:56:31,790
- A- Ayawp?
- Not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.

825
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:36,378
- Right. Yawp.
- Come on. Louder.

826
00:56:36,471 --> 00:56:38,515
- Yawp.
- That's a mouse. Come on louder!

827
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,507
- Yawp.
- Oh good God boy yell like a man!

828
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:42,008
- Yawp!
- There it is.

829
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:44,594
You see you have a barbarian
in you after all.

830
00:56:44,688 --> 00:56:47,149
You don't get away that easy. There's
a picture of Uncle Walt up there.

831
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:51,153
What does he remind you of?
Don't think answer. Go on.

832
00:56:51,236 --> 00:56:53,478
- A m- m- m- madman.
- What kind of madman?

833
00:56:53,572 --> 00:56:55,480
- Don't think about it just answer.
- A cr- crazy madman.

834
00:56:55,574 --> 00:56:58,358
No you can do better than that.
Free up your mind. Use your imagination.

835
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:00,996
Say the first thing that pops into
your head even if it's total gibberish.

836
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,154
A- A- A sweaty- toothed madman.

837
00:57:03,248 --> 00:57:05,876
Good God boy there's
a poet in you after all!

838
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:08,743
There. Close your eyes.
Close your eyes. Close them.

839
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:10,912
Now describe what you see.

840
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:13,717
- Uh I- I close my eyes...
- Yes?

841
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,471
- uh and his image floats beside me.
- A sweaty- toothed madman.

842
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:20,265
A sweaty- toothed madman with
a stare that pounds my brain.

843
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,756
Oh that's excellent!

844
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,758
Now give him action
make him do something.

845
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:26,313
- H- His hands reach out and choke me.
- That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

846
00:57:26,396 --> 00:57:28,304
- And all the time he's mumbling.
- What's he mumbling?

847
00:57:28,398 --> 00:57:30,306
- Mumbling truth.
- Yes.

848
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,820
- Truth is like a blanket that
always leaves your feet cold.

849
00:57:33,904 --> 00:57:36,855
Forget them. Forget them. Stay with
the blanket. Tell me about that blanket.

850
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:40,369
Y- Y- You push it stretch it
it'll never be enough.

851
00:57:40,452 --> 00:57:42,527
You kick at it beat it
it'll never cover any of us.

852
00:57:42,621 --> 00:57:45,958
From the moment we enter crying
to the moment we leave dying

853
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:50,952
it'll just cover your face
as you wail and cry and scream.

854
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:02,339
Don't you forget this.

855
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:05,954
That a boy Pittsie.

856
00:59:06,038 --> 00:59:08,279
- Inhale deeply.
- My dad collects pipes.

857
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:10,615
- Really?
- He must have 30.

858
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:13,378
Your parents collect pipes?
Oh that's interesting.

859
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:17,622
- Come on Knox. Join in.
- Yeah Knox we're from the government.

860
00:59:17,716 --> 00:59:19,624
We're here to help.
What's wrong?

861
00:59:19,718 --> 00:59:23,003
- It's Chris!
- Here's a picture of Chris for you!

862
00:59:23,096 --> 00:59:25,005
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
- It's not funny.

863
00:59:25,098 --> 00:59:28,518
Knock it off.
Smoke your pipes.

864
00:59:28,602 --> 00:59:33,315
- Neil.
- Friends scholars Welton men.

865
00:59:33,398 --> 00:59:35,609
What is that Neil?

866
00:59:35,692 --> 00:59:40,822
- Duh it's a lamp Meeks.
- No this is the god of the cave.

867
00:59:40,906 --> 00:59:42,313
The god of the cave.

868
00:59:44,576 --> 00:59:47,829
- Charlie what are you doing?
- What do you say we start this meeting?

869
00:59:47,913 --> 00:59:51,031
- I need a light. Who's got a light?
- Anybody bring earplugs?

870
00:59:51,124 --> 00:59:54,409
Gentlemen.

871
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:59,132
"Poetrusic" by Charles Dalton.

872
00:59:59,216 --> 01:00:02,834
Oh man.

873
01:00:02,928 --> 01:00:05,597
Laughing crying
tumbling mumbling.

874
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:07,724
Gotta do more
gotta be more.

875
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:12,719
Pitts.

876
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:16,566
Chaos screaming chaos dreaming.
Gotta do more gotta be more!

877
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:52,008
- Wow. Nice.
- That was great.

878
01:00:52,102 --> 01:00:54,010
Where did you learn
to play like that?

879
01:00:54,104 --> 01:00:56,732
My parents made me take
the clarinet for years!

880
01:00:56,815 --> 01:00:59,224
- I love the clarinet.
- I hated it.

881
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,398
The saxophone.
The saxophone is more... sonorous.

882
01:01:06,491 --> 01:01:09,119
Ooh more sonorous.
Vocabulary.

883
01:01:09,202 --> 01:01:12,789
I can't take
it any more. If I don't have Chris

884
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:16,074
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Knoxious calm down.

885
01:01:16,168 --> 01:01:20,172
No Charlie!
That's just my problem.

886
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,926
I've been calm all my life.
I'm gonna do something about that.

887
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:26,553
Where are you going?
What are you gonna do?

888
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:28,795
I'm gonna call her.

889
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:32,966
- He's gonna call her!
- Wait for me!

890
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:36,970
Hello?

891
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:39,816
She's gonna hate me.

892
01:01:42,027 --> 01:01:43,852
The Danburrys will hate me.

893
01:01:43,946 --> 01:01:47,147
My parents will kill me.

894
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:53,664
All right goddam it.

895
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:57,365
You're right.
Carpe diem.

896
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:59,784
Even if it kills me.

897
01:02:07,886 --> 01:02:09,794
- Hello?
- Hello Chris?

898
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:12,808
- Yes.
- Hi. This is Knox Overstreet.

899
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:16,478
Oh yes. Knox.

900
01:02:16,561 --> 01:02:19,481
- I'm glad you called.
- She's glad I called.

901
01:02:19,564 --> 01:02:21,692
Listen Chet's parents
are going out of town this weekend

902
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:23,683
and he's having a party.

903
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:25,821
- Would you like to come?
- Would I like to come to a party?

904
01:02:25,904 --> 01:02:28,824
- Yes. Say yes.
- It's Friday.
- Well sure.

905
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:30,732
- About 7.:00.
- Great. I'll be there Chris.

906
01:02:30,826 --> 01:02:33,662
- Okay.
- Friday night at the Danburrys'. Okay.

907
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:35,987
- Okay. Bye.
- Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.

908
01:02:36,081 --> 01:02:38,406
Yawp!

909
01:02:40,586 --> 01:02:42,494
Can you believe it?

910
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:45,299
She was gonna call me.

911
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:47,843
She invited me
to a party with her.

912
01:02:47,926 --> 01:02:50,637
- At Chet Danburry's house.
- Yeah.

913
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:53,296
- Well?
- So?

914
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:57,967
So you don't really think
she means you're going with her?

915
01:02:58,061 --> 01:03:01,481
Well of course not Charlie.
But that's not the point.

916
01:03:01,565 --> 01:03:05,809
- That's not the point at all.
- What is the point?

917
01:03:05,902 --> 01:03:11,147
- The point Charlie...
- Uh- huh?

918
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:14,995
- is...
- Yeah?

919
01:03:15,078 --> 01:03:18,697
that she was
thinking about me.

920
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:21,543
I've only met her once
and already...

921
01:03:21,627 --> 01:03:23,670
she's thinking about me.

922
01:03:23,754 --> 01:03:26,329
Damn it it's gonna happen guys.

923
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:28,634
I feel it.

924
01:03:28,717 --> 01:03:31,835
She is going to be mine.

925
01:03:34,765 --> 01:03:39,227
Carpe! Carpe!

926
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:43,555
No grades at stake gentlemen.
Just take a stroll.

927
01:03:50,656 --> 01:03:55,233
There it is.

928
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:05,337
- I don't know but I've been told.
- I don't know but I've been told.

929
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,090
Doing poetry is cold.

930
01:04:08,173 --> 01:04:12,250
- Doing poetry is cold.
- Left. Left. Left right left.

931
01:04:12,344 --> 01:04:15,628
Left. Left.
Left right left.

932
01:04:15,722 --> 01:04:17,630
Left. Halt!

933
01:04:17,724 --> 01:04:21,311
Thank you gentlemen.

934
01:04:21,395 --> 01:04:25,399
If you noticed everyone started off
with their own stride their own pace.

935
01:04:25,482 --> 01:04:29,434
Mr Pitts taking his time.
He knew he'll get there one day.

936
01:04:29,528 --> 01:04:32,281
Mr Cameron. You could see him thinking
"Is this right? It might be right.

937
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:35,200
It might be right. I know that- -
Maybe not. I don't know."

938
01:04:35,284 --> 01:04:40,622
Mr Overstreet
driven by a deeper force. Yes.

939
01:04:40,706 --> 01:04:43,709
We know that. All right. Now I didn't
bring them up here to ridicule them.

940
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:46,503
I brought them up here to
illustrate the point of conformity.

941
01:04:46,587 --> 01:04:50,205
The difficulty in maintaining your
own beliefs in the face of others.

942
01:04:50,299 --> 01:04:54,678
Now I see the look in your eyes like
"I would have walked differently."

943
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:57,514
Well ask yourselves
why you were clapping.

944
01:04:57,598 --> 01:05:00,632
Now we all have a great need
for acceptance.

945
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:03,812
But you must trust that
your beliefs are unique your own.

946
01:05:03,895 --> 01:05:06,304
Even though others may think
them odd or unpopular.

947
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:09,026
Even though the herd may go
"That's ba- a- a- a- ad."

948
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:11,653
Robert Frost said

949
01:05:11,737 --> 01:05:17,190
"Two roads diverged in the wood and I
I took the one less traveled by.

950
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:19,192
And that has made
all the difference."

951
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:21,663
I want you to find
your own walk right now

952
01:05:21,747 --> 01:05:24,614
your own way of striding
pacing any direction.

953
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:28,211
Anything you want whether it's proud
whether it's silly anything.

954
01:05:28,295 --> 01:05:32,841
Gentlemen the courtyard is yours.

955
01:05:32,925 --> 01:05:37,585
You don't have to perform
just make it for yourself.

956
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:42,007
Mr Dalton
will you be joining us?

957
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,342
Exercising the right
not to walk.

958
01:05:44,436 --> 01:05:48,732
Thank you Mr Dalton.
Just illustrated the point.

959
01:05:48,815 --> 01:05:52,684
Swim against the stream.

960
01:06:02,245 --> 01:06:04,154
Todd?

961
01:06:06,124 --> 01:06:08,033
- Hey.
- Hey.

962
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:11,046
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

963
01:06:13,298 --> 01:06:16,301
- Today's my birthday.
- Is today your birthday?

964
01:06:16,385 --> 01:06:18,095
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

965
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:22,255
- What did you get?
- My parents just gave me this.

966
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:23,548
Isn't this the same desk set- -

967
01:06:23,642 --> 01:06:26,561
Yeah yeah they gave me
the same thing as last year.

968
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:31,056
- Oh.
- Oh.

969
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:34,642
Maybe they thought you needed
another one.

970
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:38,188
Maybe they weren't
thinking about anything at all.

971
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:45,737
The funny thing is about this
is I didn't even like it the first time.

972
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:51,878
Todd I think you're underestimating
the value of this desk set.

973
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:59,167
I mean who would want
a football or a baseball- -

974
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,252
- Or a car.
- Mm- hmm or a car- -

975
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:03,974
if they could have a desk set
as wonderful as this one.

976
01:07:04,057 --> 01:07:08,186
I mean if I were ever going
to buy a desk set... twice

977
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:11,940
I would probably
buy this one... both times.

978
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:18,395
In fact its... shape is- -

979
01:07:18,488 --> 01:07:21,272
It's rather aerodynamic
isn't it?

980
01:07:21,366 --> 01:07:24,703
You can feel it.

981
01:07:24,786 --> 01:07:29,864
This desk set wants to fly.

982
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:34,536
Todd...

983
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,790
the world's first
unmanned flying desk set.

984
01:07:43,847 --> 01:07:48,393
Oh my!
Well I wouldn't worry.

985
01:07:48,477 --> 01:07:51,813
You'll get another one next year.

986
01:07:51,897 --> 01:07:54,900
"To live deep and suck out
all the marrow of life.

987
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:58,820
- To put to rout all that was not life- - "

988
01:07:58,904 --> 01:08:01,396
My God.

989
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:05,358
- Is this it?
- Yeah this is it.

990
01:08:05,452 --> 01:08:09,154
Go ahead. Go on in.
It's my cave. Watch your step.

991
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:10,655
Uh- oh.

992
01:08:10,749 --> 01:08:13,324
Hi.

993
01:08:13,418 --> 01:08:14,909
- Hello.
- Hi.

994
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:19,967
Hi guys. Meet uh Gloria and- -

995
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,010
- Tina.
- Tina.

996
01:08:22,094 --> 01:08:25,847
- This is the pledge class
of the Dead Poets Society.
- Hello.

997
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:28,006
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Hi.

998
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,885
Guys move. Move!
Come on folks it's Friday night.

999
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:36,275
Let's get on with the meeting.
Guys I have an announcement to make.

1000
01:08:36,358 --> 01:08:40,112
In keeping with the spirit of passionate
experimentation of the Dead Poets

1001
01:08:40,195 --> 01:08:42,406
I'm giving up the name
Charles Dalton.

1002
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:45,065
From now on
call me Nuwanda.

1003
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:47,703
Nuwanda?

1004
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:01,623
Hello? Hello Chris?

1005
01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:05,001
I crashed in thejungle
while trying to keep a date

1006
01:09:05,095 --> 01:09:08,181
With my little girl
who was back in the States

1007
01:09:08,265 --> 01:09:10,173
- I was stranded in thejungle-
- Knox!

1008
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:12,342
- Hi.
- You made it! Great.

1009
01:09:12,436 --> 01:09:14,344
- Did you bring anybody?
- No.

1010
01:09:14,438 --> 01:09:18,191
No? Ginny Danburry's here.
Look I have to go find Chet.

1011
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:21,028
- Why don't you go downstairs?
That's where everybody is.
- Yeah but Chris I've- -

1012
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:24,229
- Make yourself at home.
- But I've- -

1013
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:31,663
Baby baby
let's make romance

1014
01:09:33,457 --> 01:09:37,534
You know your old- time lover
hasn't got a chance

1015
01:09:37,628 --> 01:09:41,381
- Hi guys.

1016
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:48,096
Hey you Mutt Sanders'
brother?

1017
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,548
Bubba this guy look like
Mutt Sanders to you or what?

1018
01:09:51,642 --> 01:09:55,427
- You're his brother?
- No relation.

1019
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,148
- Never heard of him. Sorry guys.
- Where's our manners Steve?

1020
01:09:58,231 --> 01:10:00,359
Here's Mutt Sanders' brother
and we don't even offer him a drink.

1021
01:10:00,442 --> 01:10:03,195
- Here you go. Have some whisky pal.
- Yeah.

1022
01:10:03,278 --> 01:10:05,489
I uh I don't really drink whisky.

1023
01:10:05,572 --> 01:10:08,773
- To Mutt.
- To Mutt.

1024
01:10:08,867 --> 01:10:10,942
To Mutt.

1025
01:10:13,205 --> 01:10:17,615
- How the hell is old Mutt anyway?
- Yeah what's old Mutter been up to?

1026
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:19,951
I don't really know Mutt.

1027
01:10:20,045 --> 01:10:22,537
To the Mighty Mutt.

1028
01:10:22,631 --> 01:10:25,884
- To Mighty Mutt.
- To Mighty Mutt.

1029
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:33,684
Listen I gotta go find Patsy.

1030
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:37,719
- Say hello to Mutt for me okay?
- Will do.

1031
01:10:37,813 --> 01:10:41,973
Hell of a guy your brother Mutt.

1032
01:10:42,067 --> 01:10:44,642
We gonna have a meeting
or what?

1033
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:46,644
Yeah if you guys
don't have a meeting

1034
01:10:46,738 --> 01:10:48,646
how do we know
if we want to join?

1035
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:51,743
"Join"?

1036
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:54,538
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

1037
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:57,030
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate."

1038
01:10:57,124 --> 01:10:58,782
That's so sweet.

1039
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:03,672
- I made that up just for you.
- You did?

1040
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:06,758
I'll write one
for you too Gloria.

1041
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:12,431
"She walks in beauty
like the night.

1042
01:11:13,932 --> 01:11:16,935
"She walks in beauty
like the night...

1043
01:11:17,019 --> 01:11:22,180
"of cloudless climes
and starry skies.

1044
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:24,182
"All that's best
dark and bright

1045
01:11:24,276 --> 01:11:28,520
- meet in her aspect and her eyes."
- That's beautiful.

1046
01:11:29,948 --> 01:11:32,524
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1047
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:52,596
She sure looks fine to me
What's her name

1048
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:55,223
Look out
Let me call her one time

1049
01:12:06,735 --> 01:12:09,655
Hey little girl

1050
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:13,606
Gee you sure look fine

1051
01:12:15,953 --> 01:12:17,861
God help me.

1052
01:12:17,955 --> 01:12:22,032
Ooh baby
you're not mine

1053
01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:30,206
Hey little girl
How's about a date

1054
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,264
- Carpe diem.
- Hey little girl

1055
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:39,268
How's about a date

1056
01:12:40,769 --> 01:12:43,887
You know I'll come get you
early baby

1057
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:46,817
Won't keep you out
too late

1058
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,562
Say little girl

1059
01:12:52,656 --> 01:12:55,033
Now how's about a kiss

1060
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,904
Yeah say little girl

1061
01:13:00,998 --> 01:13:04,668
How's about a kiss

1062
01:13:04,751 --> 01:13:08,672
- You don't remember?
- Well if you don't kiss me baby

1063
01:13:08,755 --> 01:13:13,500
- Chet. Chet. Look.
- What?

1064
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:16,628
- It's Mutt Sanders' brother.
- Huh?

1065
01:13:16,722 --> 01:13:18,463
- Knox what- -
- And he's feeling up your girl!

1066
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:20,799
What are you doing?

1067
01:13:20,892 --> 01:13:23,385
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chet. Chet don't!

1068
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:26,648
- Now Chet I know this looks bad- -
- Leave him alone.

1069
01:13:26,732 --> 01:13:28,973
Chet no!
You'll hurt him!

1070
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:32,352
- Chet stop it! Leave him alone!
- Damn!

1071
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:34,521
- Chet stop it!
- Bastard!

1072
01:13:34,615 --> 01:13:36,658
Knox are you all right?

1073
01:13:36,742 --> 01:13:38,619
Chris get the hell away from him!

1074
01:13:38,702 --> 01:13:39,953
- Chet you hurt him!
- Good!

1075
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:43,405
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's- It's okay.

1076
01:13:43,498 --> 01:13:45,407
Next time I see you
you die.

1077
01:13:47,878 --> 01:13:51,496
Go ahead.
Pass it around.

1078
01:13:59,848 --> 01:14:03,383
Me and Pitts are working
on a hi- fi system.

1079
01:14:03,477 --> 01:14:07,262
It shouldn't be that hard to
uh to put together.

1080
01:14:07,356 --> 01:14:10,692
Yeah. Uh I might
be going to Yale.

1081
01:14:10,776 --> 01:14:13,695
Uh but I- I might not.

1082
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:15,854
Don't you guys miss
having girls around here?

1083
01:14:15,948 --> 01:14:17,522
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1084
01:14:17,616 --> 01:14:20,191
That's part of what this club is about.

1085
01:14:20,285 --> 01:14:22,412
In fact
I'd like to announce...

1086
01:14:22,496 --> 01:14:25,780
I published an article in the school
paper in the name of the Dead Poets

1087
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:29,294
- What?
- demanding girls
be admitted to Welton...

1088
01:14:29,378 --> 01:14:32,047
- You didn't.
- so we can all stop beating off.

1089
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,788
- How did you do that?
- I'm one of the proofers.

1090
01:14:33,882 --> 01:14:36,885
- I slipped the article in.
- It's- It's over now.

1091
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:38,543
Why?
Nobody knows who we are.

1092
01:14:38,637 --> 01:14:40,879
Well don't you think
they're gonna figure out who wrote it?

1093
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:44,591
They're gonna come to you and ask
to know what the Dead Poets Society is.

1094
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:47,229
Charlie you had no right
to do something like that.

1095
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:49,554
It's Nuwanda Cameron.

1096
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:52,484
That's right. It's Nuwanda.

1097
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:55,654
Are we just playing around out here
or do we mean what we say?

1098
01:14:55,737 --> 01:14:58,573
If all we do is come together
and read a bunch of poems to each other

1099
01:14:58,657 --> 01:15:00,565
- what the hell are we doing?
- All right.

1100
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:02,703
But you still shouldn't
have done it Charlie.

1101
01:15:02,786 --> 01:15:05,247
This could mean trouble.
You don't speak for the club.

1102
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,906
Hey would you not worry about
your precious little neck?

1103
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,336
If they catch me
I'll tell them I made it up.

1104
01:15:25,434 --> 01:15:27,842
Fine.

1105
01:15:37,946 --> 01:15:39,854
Sit.

1106
01:15:45,078 --> 01:15:46,986
In this week's issue
of Welton Honor

1107
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,918
there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article.

1108
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:56,590
Rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons- -

1109
01:15:56,673 --> 01:15:58,915
and let me assure you
I will find them- -

1110
01:15:59,009 --> 01:16:02,460
I'm asking any and all students
who know anything about this article...

1111
01:16:02,554 --> 01:16:06,391
to make themselves known
here and now.

1112
01:16:08,226 --> 01:16:10,687
Whoever the guilty persons are

1113
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:14,931
this is your only chance to avoid
expulsion from this school.

1114
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:22,115
Welton Academy.
Hello.

1115
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:24,743
Yes he is.
just a moment.

1116
01:16:24,826 --> 01:16:27,861
Mr Nolan it's for you.

1117
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,915
It's God!

1118
01:16:29,998 --> 01:16:31,959
He says we should have girls
at Welton.

1119
01:16:47,766 --> 01:16:49,893
Wipe that smirk off your face.

1120
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:52,980
If you think Mr Dalton

1121
01:16:53,063 --> 01:16:56,014
that you're the first to try to get
thrown out of this school think again.

1122
01:16:56,108 --> 01:17:00,185
Others have had similar notions and have
failed just as surely as you will fail.

1123
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:03,646
Assume the position.

1124
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,369
Count aloud Mr Dalton.

1125
01:17:20,799 --> 01:17:22,791
One.

1126
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:27,045
Two.

1127
01:17:31,143 --> 01:17:33,770
Three.

1128
01:17:33,854 --> 01:17:37,441
Four.

1129
01:17:37,524 --> 01:17:39,901
Five.

1130
01:17:39,985 --> 01:17:42,696
What is this Dead Poets Society?
I want names.

1131
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:14,175
- You kicked out?
- No.

1132
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:17,022
So what happened?

1133
01:18:19,107 --> 01:18:22,694
I'm to turn everybody in
apologise to the school

1134
01:18:22,778 --> 01:18:24,853
and all will be forgiven.

1135
01:18:24,947 --> 01:18:27,157
So what are you gonna do?

1136
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,525
- Charlie- -
- Damn it Neil

1137
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:33,570
the name is Nuwanda.

1138
01:18:39,127 --> 01:18:42,547
Excuse me.
May we have a word Mr Keating?

1139
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:44,622
Certainly.

1140
01:18:50,055 --> 01:18:54,132
This was my first classroomJohn.
Did you know that?

1141
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:56,468
My first desk.

1142
01:18:56,561 --> 01:18:58,970
I didn't know you taught
Mr Nolan.

1143
01:18:59,064 --> 01:19:03,475
English.
Long before your time.

1144
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:06,989
It was hard giving it up
I can tell you.

1145
01:19:10,242 --> 01:19:15,320
I'm hearing rumours
about some unorthodox
teaching methods in your classroom.

1146
01:19:15,414 --> 01:19:19,657
I'm not saying they've had anything
to do with the Dalton boy's outburst

1147
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:24,496
but I don't think I have to warn you
boys his age are very impressionable.

1148
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,843
Well your reprimand made
quite an impression I'm sure.

1149
01:19:30,596 --> 01:19:34,673
- What was going on
in the courtyard the other day?
- Courtyard?

1150
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:37,853
- Boys marching clapping in unison.
- Oh that.

1151
01:19:37,936 --> 01:19:41,054
That was an exercise to prove a point:
dangers of conformity.

1152
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:43,984
WellJohn the curriculum here is set.
It's proven. It works.

1153
01:19:44,067 --> 01:19:46,643
If you question it what's to
prevent them from doing the same?

1154
01:19:46,737 --> 01:19:49,145
I always thought the idea of education
was to learn to think for yourself.

1155
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:51,867
At these boys' age?
Not on your life!

1156
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:55,996
TraditionJohn. Discipline.

1157
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,490
Prepare them for college
and the rest will take care of itself.

1158
01:20:04,504 --> 01:20:07,841
Creak.

1159
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:10,844
He starts walking around
towards my left.

1160
01:20:10,928 --> 01:20:14,264
Creak. Creak.

1161
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:17,966
'Assume the position Mr Dalton "
which means- -

1162
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,187
All right gentlemen.

1163
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:23,357
- Mr Keating.
- Mr Dalton.

1164
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,682
That was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today.

1165
01:20:25,776 --> 01:20:27,684
You're siding with Mr Nolan?

1166
01:20:27,778 --> 01:20:29,686
What about carpe diem
and sucking all the marrow...

1167
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,521
- out of life and all that?
- Sucking the marrow out of life...

1168
01:20:31,615 --> 01:20:34,618
doesn't mean
choking on the bone.

1169
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:39,029
There is a time for daring
and there is a time for caution.

1170
01:20:39,122 --> 01:20:41,531
And a wise man understands
which is called for.

1171
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:43,835
But I thought you'd like that.

1172
01:20:43,919 --> 01:20:45,827
No.

1173
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:48,872
You being expelled from school
is not daring to me. It's stupid.

1174
01:20:48,966 --> 01:20:51,426
'Cause you'll miss some
golden opportunities.

1175
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,970
Yeah? Like what?

1176
01:20:53,053 --> 01:20:57,099
Like if nothing else
the opportunity to attend my classes.

1177
01:20:59,017 --> 01:21:01,395
Got it ace?

1178
01:21:01,478 --> 01:21:04,231
Aye aye Captain.

1179
01:21:04,314 --> 01:21:06,775
Keep your head about you.

1180
01:21:06,858 --> 01:21:09,642
That goes
for the lot of you.

1181
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:12,656
- Yes Captain.
- Yes Captain.

1182
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:14,731
Phone call from God.

1183
01:21:16,702 --> 01:21:20,070
If it'd been collect
it would have been daring.

1184
01:21:22,249 --> 01:21:25,617
- All right. Go on boy.
- No.

1185
01:21:35,512 --> 01:21:38,181
- We're trying to rehearse okay? Go.

1186
01:21:38,265 --> 01:21:40,340
A good persuasion
therefore hear me Hermia.

1187
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:44,302
Wait wait. The excitement. I don't
hear any excitement about this play.

1188
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:48,807
Now take her hand
bring her downstage...

1189
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,892
and stop
and "Fair gentle Hermia."

1190
01:21:50,986 --> 01:21:53,113
Okay? Try again.

1191
01:21:53,196 --> 01:21:55,105
What's for dinner?

1192
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:56,940
- Spaghetti and meatballs!
- Food!

1193
01:21:59,578 --> 01:22:01,653
Save some for me.

1194
01:22:03,415 --> 01:22:06,752
"But room fairy!
Here comes Oberon."

1195
01:22:09,254 --> 01:22:13,008
- Father.
- Neil.

1196
01:22:13,091 --> 01:22:15,250
Wait a minute.
Before you say anything

1197
01:22:15,344 --> 01:22:18,513
- please let me ex- -
- Don't you dare talk back to me.

1198
01:22:20,182 --> 01:22:23,352
It's bad enough that
you've wasted your time...

1199
01:22:23,435 --> 01:22:26,886
with this this
absurd acting business

1200
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:30,181
but you deliberately
deceived me.

1201
01:22:30,275 --> 01:22:33,810
How- How- How did you expect
to get away with this?

1202
01:22:35,948 --> 01:22:38,023
Answer me.

1203
01:22:38,116 --> 01:22:40,160
Who put you up to it?

1204
01:22:40,243 --> 01:22:43,497
- Was it this new man? Keating?
- No.

1205
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:47,584
Nobody p- - I thought I'd surprise you.
I've gotten all A's in every class.

1206
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:50,921
Did you really think
I wasn't going to find out?

1207
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:54,956
"Oh my niece is in a play
with your son" says Mrs Marks.

1208
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:58,887
"No no no" I say. "You must be
mistaken. My son's not in a play."

1209
01:22:58,971 --> 01:23:00,879
You made a liar
out of me Neil!

1210
01:23:04,977 --> 01:23:09,439
Now tomorrow you go to them
and you tell them that you're quitting.

1211
01:23:09,523 --> 01:23:11,431
No I can't.

1212
01:23:11,525 --> 01:23:13,652
I have the main part.
The performance is tomorrow night!

1213
01:23:13,735 --> 01:23:15,727
I don't care if the world
comes to an end tomorrow night

1214
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:18,991
you are through with that play!

1215
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:20,982
Is that clear?

1216
01:23:21,076 --> 01:23:23,620
Is that clear?

1217
01:23:24,496 --> 01:23:27,249
Yes sir.

1218
01:23:34,464 --> 01:23:38,135
I made a great many sacrifices
to get you here Neil

1219
01:23:38,218 --> 01:23:42,431
and you will not let me down.

1220
01:23:42,514 --> 01:23:44,923
No sir.

1221
01:24:05,037 --> 01:24:07,706
It's open.

1222
01:24:18,717 --> 01:24:20,625
Neil what's up?

1223
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,388
- Can I speak to you a minute?
- Certainly. Sit down.

1224
01:24:24,222 --> 01:24:26,464
Oh.

1225
01:24:26,558 --> 01:24:29,050
- I'm sorry. Here.
- Excuse me.

1226
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:35,817
- Get you some tea?
- Tea? Sure.

1227
01:24:35,901 --> 01:24:39,237
- Want some milk or sugar in that?
- No thanks.

1228
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:41,479
Gosh they don't give you
much room around here.

1229
01:24:41,573 --> 01:24:43,398
It's part of the monastic oath.

1230
01:24:43,492 --> 01:24:46,995
They don't want worldly things
distracting me from my teaching.

1231
01:24:49,915 --> 01:24:51,823
- She's pretty.
- She's also in London.

1232
01:24:51,917 --> 01:24:55,003
Makes it a little difficult.

1233
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:58,090
- How do you stand it?
- Stand what?

1234
01:24:58,173 --> 01:25:00,498
You can go anywhere. You can do
anything. How can you stand being here?

1235
01:25:00,592 --> 01:25:04,513
Because I love teaching.
I don't want to be anywhere else.

1236
01:25:08,058 --> 01:25:12,062
- What's up?
- I just talked to my father.

1237
01:25:12,145 --> 01:25:14,773
He's making me quit the play
at Henley Hall.

1238
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:19,820
But acting is everything to me.

1239
01:25:19,903 --> 01:25:23,021
I mean- -
But he doesn't know. He- -

1240
01:25:23,115 --> 01:25:28,109
I can see his point. We're not
a rich family like Charlie's. I mean- -

1241
01:25:28,203 --> 01:25:31,290
But he's planning the rest
of my life for me.

1242
01:25:31,373 --> 01:25:33,782
And he- he's never asked me
what I want.

1243
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:36,743
Have you ever told your father
what you just told me?

1244
01:25:36,837 --> 01:25:39,548
About your passion for acting?
Have you showed him that?

1245
01:25:39,631 --> 01:25:42,718
- I can't.
- Why not?

1246
01:25:42,801 --> 01:25:44,709
I can't talk to him this way.

1247
01:25:44,803 --> 01:25:47,472
Then you're acting for him too.

1248
01:25:47,556 --> 01:25:50,757
You're playing the part
of the dutiful son.

1249
01:25:50,851 --> 01:25:52,759
I know this sounds impossible
but you have to talk to him.

1250
01:25:52,853 --> 01:25:55,564
You have to show him
who you are what your heart is.

1251
01:25:55,647 --> 01:25:58,139
I know what he'll say.

1252
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:00,725
He'll tell me that acting's a whim
and I should forget it.

1253
01:26:00,819 --> 01:26:03,311
They're counting on me.

1254
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:06,742
He'll just tell me to put it
out of my mind for my own good.

1255
01:26:06,825 --> 01:26:08,650
You are not
an indentured servant.

1256
01:26:08,744 --> 01:26:13,457
It's not a whim for you. You prove it to
him by your conviction and your passion.

1257
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,949
You show him that
and if he still doesn't believe you- -

1258
01:26:16,043 --> 01:26:19,077
Well by then you'll be out of school
and you can do anything you want.

1259
01:26:21,298 --> 01:26:25,375
No.

1260
01:26:25,469 --> 01:26:27,627
What about the play?
The show's tomorrow night.

1261
01:26:27,721 --> 01:26:30,839
Then you have to talk
to him before tomorrow night.

1262
01:26:33,352 --> 01:26:35,312
I- -

1263
01:26:35,395 --> 01:26:37,606
- Isn't there an easier way?
- No.

1264
01:26:41,735 --> 01:26:45,572
I'm trapped.

1265
01:26:45,656 --> 01:26:48,148
No you're not.

1266
01:27:11,223 --> 01:27:13,131
Chris!

1267
01:27:14,893 --> 01:27:17,562
Chris! Chris Noel.
Do you know where she is?

1268
01:27:17,646 --> 01:27:20,190
- Um I think she's in Room 111.
- Thanks.

1269
01:27:23,527 --> 01:27:25,435
I know.

1270
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,370
Excuse me. Chris- -

1271
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:35,330
Knox what are you doing here?

1272
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:37,322
I came to apologize for the other night.

1273
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:39,459
I brought you these
and a poem I wrote for you.

1274
01:27:43,088 --> 01:27:45,716
Knox don't you know that
if Chet finds you here he'll kill you?

1275
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:49,668
- I don't care. I love you Chris.
- Knox you're crazy.

1276
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:52,389
Look I acted like a jerk
and I know it.

1277
01:27:52,472 --> 01:27:56,174
- Please accept these. Please.
- No. No I- I can't.

1278
01:27:56,268 --> 01:27:58,395
Just forget it.

1279
01:28:13,827 --> 01:28:16,913
- Knox I don't believe this.
- All I'm asking you to do is listen.

1280
01:28:18,582 --> 01:28:22,961
"The heavens made a girl named Chris...

1281
01:28:23,045 --> 01:28:24,953
"with hair and skin of gold.

1282
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:27,007
"To touch her...

1283
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:30,344
would be paradise. "

1284
01:28:47,277 --> 01:28:49,738
Get out of here. Cameron you fool.

1285
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:52,908
Hey how'd it go?
Did you read it to her?

1286
01:28:52,991 --> 01:28:57,235
- Yeah.
- Wow. What'd she say?

1287
01:28:57,329 --> 01:29:00,415
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

1288
01:29:00,499 --> 01:29:03,867
Nothing.
But I did it.

1289
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:07,631
Well what did she say?
She had to say something!

1290
01:29:07,714 --> 01:29:10,801
- Hey Knox!
- Seize the day!

1291
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:23,094
- Did you talk to your father?
- Uh yeah.

1292
01:29:23,188 --> 01:29:26,806
He didn't like it one bit but at least
he's letting me stay in the play.

1293
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:31,144
He won't be able to m- make it.
He's in Chicago.

1294
01:29:31,238 --> 01:29:34,241
But uh I think he's gonna
let me stay with acting.

1295
01:29:34,324 --> 01:29:38,568
Really? You told him
what you told me?

1296
01:29:38,662 --> 01:29:41,415
Yeah.

1297
01:29:41,498 --> 01:29:43,458
He wasn't happy.

1298
01:29:43,542 --> 01:29:47,754
But he'll be gone
at least four days.

1299
01:29:47,838 --> 01:29:52,301
I don't think he'll make
the show but...

1300
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,542
I think he'll let me
stay with it.

1301
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:56,544
"Keep up the schoolwork."

1302
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:04,980
Thanks.

1303
01:30:06,148 --> 01:30:09,151
- Oh baby.
- Beautiful baby.

1304
01:30:09,234 --> 01:30:11,142
- I am- -
- Excuse me.

1305
01:30:11,236 --> 01:30:14,823
- Just a moment. Yes. You're so good.

1306
01:30:14,906 --> 01:30:16,815
Come on Todd.
I'm trying to fix this.

1307
01:30:16,908 --> 01:30:19,202
Come on Nuwanda
we're going to miss Neil's entrance.

1308
01:30:19,286 --> 01:30:21,997
He said something about
getting red before we left.

1309
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,281
- "Getting red"? What does that mean?
- I- - You know Charlie.

1310
01:30:28,754 --> 01:30:31,840
So Charlie
what's this 'getting red"bit?

1311
01:30:33,592 --> 01:30:36,084
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

1312
01:30:36,178 --> 01:30:38,336
W- What is that?

1313
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:42,048
It's an Indian warrior
symbol for virility.

1314
01:30:42,142 --> 01:30:45,760
Makes me feel potent
like I can drive girls crazy.

1315
01:30:45,854 --> 01:30:48,263
Oh come on Charlie.
The girls are waiting.

1316
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:52,767
Whoa.

1317
01:30:56,949 --> 01:31:00,118
Chris.

1318
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:03,111
What are you doing here?

1319
01:31:03,205 --> 01:31:06,541
- Gentlemen let's go!
- Go ahead guys. I'll catch up.

1320
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:09,086
Yeah. Come on guys.

1321
01:31:09,169 --> 01:31:11,077
Chris you can't be in here.

1322
01:31:11,171 --> 01:31:13,163
- If they catch you we're both
gonna be in big trouble.
- Come on.

1323
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:15,749
- Oh but it's fine if- -
- Shh shh. Chris.

1324
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:21,755
It's fine for you to come barging into
my school and make a fool out of me?

1325
01:31:21,848 --> 01:31:23,757
I didn't mean
to make a fool out of you.

1326
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:26,228
Well you did.
Chet found out.

1327
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:30,472
It took everything I could do to keep
him from coming here and killing you.

1328
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:35,143
- Knox you have got to stop this stuff.
- I can't Chris. I love you.

1329
01:31:35,237 --> 01:31:38,407
Knox you say that over and over.

1330
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:40,398
You don't- -
You don't even know me.

1331
01:31:40,492 --> 01:31:42,703
Will you bejoining us Mr Overstreet?

1332
01:31:42,786 --> 01:31:44,611
Go ahead Captain. I'll walk.

1333
01:31:44,705 --> 01:31:47,958
Knox. Knox
i- it just so happens...

1334
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:51,576
that I could care less
about you.

1335
01:31:54,548 --> 01:31:57,332
Then you wouldn't be here
warning me about Chet.

1336
01:32:01,847 --> 01:32:04,600
I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for the play.

1337
01:32:04,683 --> 01:32:07,717
- Are you going with him?
- Chet? To a play?

1338
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:09,719
- Are you kidding?
- Then come with me.

1339
01:32:09,813 --> 01:32:11,773
Knox you are so infuriating!

1340
01:32:11,857 --> 01:32:14,265
Come on Chris
just give me one chance.

1341
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:17,112
If you don't like me after tonight
I'll stay away forever.

1342
01:32:17,195 --> 01:32:20,313
- Uh- huh.
- I promise. Dead Poets honour.

1343
01:32:20,407 --> 01:32:21,950
You come with me tonight

1344
01:32:22,034 --> 01:32:24,494
and then if you don't want to see me
again I swear I'll bow out.

1345
01:32:24,578 --> 01:32:29,041
- What would happen if Chet found out?
- He won't know anything.

1346
01:32:29,124 --> 01:32:32,242
We'll sit in the back
and sneak away as soon as it's over.

1347
01:32:32,336 --> 01:32:35,954
And I suppose you would promise
that this would be the end of it?

1348
01:32:36,048 --> 01:32:39,134
- Dead Poets honour.
- What is that?

1349
01:32:41,511 --> 01:32:44,765
- My word.
- Hmm.

1350
01:32:55,233 --> 01:32:58,236
You are so infuriating.

1351
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,010
Hey there he is!
Hey hey hey hey!

1352
01:33:22,094 --> 01:33:25,097
Shh boys.

1353
01:33:31,687 --> 01:33:36,014
Either I mistake your shape
and making quite...

1354
01:33:36,108 --> 01:33:41,446
or else you are that shrewd and
knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow!

1355
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:43,438
Thou speak'st aright.

1356
01:33:43,532 --> 01:33:45,690
I am that merry wanderer
of the night.

1357
01:33:45,784 --> 01:33:48,620
I jest to Oberon
and make him smile...

1358
01:33:48,704 --> 01:33:52,405
when I a fat and bean- fed
horse beguile.

1359
01:33:52,499 --> 01:33:55,586
Neighing in the likeness
of a filly foal.

1360
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:58,338
Sometime lurk I
in a gossip's bowl...

1361
01:33:58,422 --> 01:34:01,049
in very likeness
of a roasted crab.

1362
01:34:01,133 --> 01:34:04,136
And when she drink
against her lips I bob...

1363
01:34:04,219 --> 01:34:06,795
and on her withered dewlap
pour the ale.

1364
01:34:06,888 --> 01:34:08,963
- The wisest aunt
telling the saddest tale.
- He's good. He's really good.

1365
01:34:09,057 --> 01:34:12,728
Sometime for three- foot stool
mistaketh me.

1366
01:34:12,811 --> 01:34:16,481
Then slip I from her bum
down topples she and "Tailor" cries...

1367
01:34:16,565 --> 01:34:18,473
and falls into a cough.

1368
01:34:18,567 --> 01:34:21,403
And then the whole quire
hold their hips and laugh...

1369
01:34:21,486 --> 01:34:23,728
and waxen in their mirth
nee- e- e- eze...

1370
01:34:23,822 --> 01:34:25,866
and swear.

1371
01:34:25,949 --> 01:34:29,067
A merrier hour
was never wasted there.

1372
01:34:29,161 --> 01:34:31,403
But room fairy.

1373
01:34:31,496 --> 01:34:35,740
- Here comes Oberon.
- And here my mistress.
Would that he were gone.

1374
01:34:40,422 --> 01:34:42,747
Then by your side
no bed- room me deny.

1375
01:34:42,841 --> 01:34:45,844
For lying so Hermia
I do not lie.

1376
01:34:45,928 --> 01:34:49,973
Lysander riddles very
prettily. Much beshrew my manners...

1377
01:34:50,057 --> 01:34:53,174
and my pride if Hermia
meant to say Lysander lied.

1378
01:34:53,268 --> 01:34:56,302
But gentle friend
for love and courtesy...

1379
01:34:56,396 --> 01:34:59,514
lie further off
in human modesty

1380
01:34:59,608 --> 01:35:02,976
such separation as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor and maid.

1381
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:07,147
Good night sweet friend. Thy love
ne'er alter 'til thy sweet life end.

1382
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,026
Amen.
Amen to that fair prayer say I.

1383
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:13,611
- And then end life when I end loyalty.
- Neil. That's your cue Neil.

1384
01:35:13,705 --> 01:35:16,875
Come on Neil.
Here's your crown. Let's go.

1385
01:36:22,816 --> 01:36:25,308
If we shadows have offended...

1386
01:36:26,987 --> 01:36:29,531
think but this
and all is mended.

1387
01:36:29,615 --> 01:36:33,316
That you have but slumber'd here
while these visions did appear.

1388
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:37,706
And this weak and idle theme
no more yielding but a dream.

1389
01:36:38,915 --> 01:36:41,627
Gentles do not reprehend.

1390
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:44,880
If you pardon we will mend.

1391
01:36:44,963 --> 01:36:48,581
And as I am an honest Puck
if we have unearned luck

1392
01:36:48,675 --> 01:36:51,053
now to 'scape
the serpent's tongue

1393
01:36:51,136 --> 01:36:55,630
we will make amends ere long;
else the Puck a liar call.

1394
01:36:59,092 --> 01:37:00,552
So good night
unto you all.

1395
01:37:00,635 --> 01:37:03,805
Give me your hands
if we be friends

1396
01:37:03,888 --> 01:37:07,799
and Robin shall
restore amends.

1397
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,334
Yawp! Carpe diem!

1398
01:38:04,449 --> 01:38:06,774
That was great!

1399
01:38:06,868 --> 01:38:10,445
Excuse me. I'm Neil's father.
I'd like to see him please.

1400
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:18,744
Neil your father.

1401
01:38:18,838 --> 01:38:24,709
- What did you think?
- You were all just wonderful!

1402
01:38:37,649 --> 01:38:39,557
Excuse me please.

1403
01:38:39,651 --> 01:38:43,478
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Neil! Back here! Neil!

1404
01:38:43,571 --> 01:38:46,606
Neil Neil you were great!
Come back Neil.

1405
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,608
- I can't guys.
- Neil.

1406
01:38:48,702 --> 01:38:50,610
Excuse me.

1407
01:38:51,788 --> 01:38:55,041
Neil. Neil.
You have the gift.

1408
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:57,492
What a performance.
You left even me speechless.

1409
01:38:57,585 --> 01:38:59,869
- You have to stay with- -
- Get in the car.

1410
01:38:59,963 --> 01:39:03,581
Keating
you stay away from my son.

1411
01:39:03,675 --> 01:39:07,668
Neil! Neil!
Mr Perry come on!

1412
01:39:07,762 --> 01:39:10,515
Don't make it
any worse than it is.

1413
01:39:10,598 --> 01:39:14,383
Do you want to take the other car?

1414
01:39:23,028 --> 01:39:25,353
Is it okay
if we walk back?

1415
01:39:25,447 --> 01:39:28,366
Captain?

1416
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:33,528
- Knox?
- What?

1417
01:39:33,621 --> 01:39:36,197
We'll be home about 11:30.

1418
01:40:13,912 --> 01:40:16,612
We're trying very hard...

1419
01:40:16,706 --> 01:40:21,200
to understand why it is
that you insist on defying us.

1420
01:40:21,294 --> 01:40:26,747
But whatever the reason
we're not gonna let you ruin your life.

1421
01:40:26,841 --> 01:40:30,543
I'm withdrawing you from Welton and
enrolling you in Braden Military School.

1422
01:40:30,637 --> 01:40:33,755
You're going to Harvard
and you're gonna be a doctor.

1423
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:38,760
But that's ten more years.

1424
01:40:38,853 --> 01:40:40,887
- Father that's a lifetime!
- Oh stop it!

1425
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:45,141
Don't be so dramatic.
You make it sound like a prison term.

1426
01:40:46,361 --> 01:40:48,269
You don't understand Neil.

1427
01:40:48,363 --> 01:40:51,282
You have opportunities
that I never even dreamt of!

1428
01:40:51,366 --> 01:40:54,369
- I am not going to let you waste them!
- I've got to tell you what I feel.

1429
01:40:54,452 --> 01:40:57,539
- We've been so worried about- -
- What? What? Tell me what you feel!

1430
01:40:59,791 --> 01:41:01,699
What is it?

1431
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:14,462
Is it more of this- this
acting business?

1432
01:41:14,556 --> 01:41:18,049
Because you can forget that.

1433
01:41:18,143 --> 01:41:20,635
What?

1434
01:41:25,358 --> 01:41:27,975
Nothing.

1435
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:43,157
Nothing?

1436
01:41:45,545 --> 01:41:47,995
Well then
let's go to bed.

1437
01:42:01,478 --> 01:42:07,067
I was good.
I was really good.

1438
01:42:11,446 --> 01:42:13,855
Go on get some sleep.

1439
01:42:45,397 --> 01:42:50,026
It's going to be all right.

1440
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:05,461
What was that?

1441
01:46:05,555 --> 01:46:08,423
What?

1442
01:46:08,516 --> 01:46:12,468
- That sound.
- What sound?

1443
01:46:18,985 --> 01:46:20,893
Tom?

1444
01:46:24,532 --> 01:46:26,441
What is it?

1445
01:46:27,952 --> 01:46:29,861
What's wrong?

1446
01:46:39,756 --> 01:46:42,081
Neil?

1447
01:46:47,681 --> 01:46:50,965
Tom what is it?

1448
01:46:51,059 --> 01:46:53,468
What's wrong?

1449
01:46:55,647 --> 01:46:57,722
Neil?

1450
01:47:02,821 --> 01:47:06,814
- Neil?
- I'll look outside.

1451
01:47:06,908 --> 01:47:08,816
Neil?

1452
01:47:26,594 --> 01:47:31,089
No!

1453
01:47:31,182 --> 01:47:35,510
- Oh Neil! Oh my God!
- Oh my God. Oh no no.

1454
01:47:35,603 --> 01:47:38,356
- Oh my son! My son! My poor son!
- He's all right.

1455
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:42,986
He's all right!
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

1456
01:47:43,069 --> 01:47:48,825
Stop it! Stop it.

1457
01:47:53,288 --> 01:47:57,073
Todd. Todd.

1458
01:47:57,167 --> 01:48:00,034
Oh Charlie.

1459
01:48:06,051 --> 01:48:09,544
What is it?

1460
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:19,345
Neil's dead.

1461
01:48:57,164 --> 01:48:59,156
It's so beautiful.

1462
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:12,836
Todd!

1463
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:14,473
- It's okay Todd.
- Calm down.

1464
01:49:14,557 --> 01:49:16,465
It's all right Todd.

1465
01:49:16,559 --> 01:49:18,467
- Todd it's okay.
- It's okay Todd.

1466
01:49:18,561 --> 01:49:22,262
It's all right. It's all right.

1467
01:49:22,356 --> 01:49:24,149
- He wouldn't have done it.
- You can't explain it Todd.

1468
01:49:24,233 --> 01:49:25,390
- It was his father!
- No!

1469
01:49:25,484 --> 01:49:28,268
He wouldn't have left us.
It's because he- -

1470
01:49:28,362 --> 01:49:29,905
He wouldn't have.

1471
01:49:29,989 --> 01:49:31,313
- His dad was- -
- Todd.

1472
01:49:31,407 --> 01:49:33,482
His- His father did it.
His father killed him.

1473
01:49:33,576 --> 01:49:35,484
He made him do it.

1474
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:38,612
Todd!

1475
01:49:38,706 --> 01:49:41,073
Leave him be.

1476
01:51:40,202 --> 01:51:42,486
...All my life

1477
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:45,155
Shall surely

1478
01:51:45,249 --> 01:51:50,494
Follow me

1479
01:51:50,588 --> 01:51:54,998
And in God's house

1480
01:51:55,092 --> 01:51:59,169
Forevermore

1481
01:51:59,263 --> 01:52:03,674
My dwelling place

1482
01:52:03,767 --> 01:52:08,011
Shall be

1483
01:52:08,105 --> 01:52:13,861
Amen

1484
01:52:20,075 --> 01:52:22,828
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.

1485
01:52:26,415 --> 01:52:30,002
He was a fine student

1486
01:52:30,085 --> 01:52:33,996
one of Welton's best.

1487
01:52:34,089 --> 01:52:36,842
And he will be missed.

1488
01:52:40,596 --> 01:52:45,340
We've contacted each of your parents
to explain the situation.

1489
01:52:45,434 --> 01:52:48,854
Naturally they're all
quite concerned.

1490
01:52:53,943 --> 01:52:57,196
At the request
of Neil's family

1491
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:02,868
I intend to conduct a thorough
inquiry into this matter.

1492
01:53:04,286 --> 01:53:08,447
Your complete cooperation
is expected.

1493
01:53:17,633 --> 01:53:20,803
- You told him about this meeting?
- Twice.

1494
01:53:20,886 --> 01:53:23,128
That's it guys.
We're all fried.

1495
01:53:23,222 --> 01:53:26,141
- How do you mean?
- Cameron's a fink.

1496
01:53:26,225 --> 01:53:29,509
- He's in Nolan's office now finking.
- About what?

1497
01:53:29,603 --> 01:53:32,638
The club Pittsie.
Think about it.

1498
01:53:32,731 --> 01:53:36,475
The board of directors
the trustees and Mr Nolan.

1499
01:53:36,569 --> 01:53:40,155
Do you think for one moment they're
gonna let this thing just blow over?

1500
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:44,900
Schools go down because of things
like this. They need a scapegoat.

1501
01:54:00,259 --> 01:54:02,417
What's going on guys?

1502
01:54:03,762 --> 01:54:06,046
You finked
didn't you Cameron?

1503
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:08,267
"Finked"? I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1504
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:11,604
You told Nolan everything about
the club is what I'm talking about.

1505
01:54:11,687 --> 01:54:13,595
Look in case you hadn't heard
Dalton there's something...

1506
01:54:13,689 --> 01:54:16,181
called an honour code
at this school all right?

1507
01:54:16,275 --> 01:54:19,935
If a teacher asks you a question
you tell the truth or you're expelled.

1508
01:54:20,029 --> 01:54:21,687
- You- -
- Charlie!

1509
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:26,108
He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes
so he ratted to save himself!

1510
01:54:26,202 --> 01:54:28,610
- Don't touch him Charlie.
You do and you're out.
- I'm out anyway!

1511
01:54:28,704 --> 01:54:31,624
- You don't know that. Not yet!
- He's right there Charlie.

1512
01:54:31,707 --> 01:54:35,920
And if you guys are smart you will do
exactly what I did and cooperate.

1513
01:54:36,003 --> 01:54:40,831
They're not after us.
We're the victims.

1514
01:54:40,925 --> 01:54:43,594
Us and Neil.

1515
01:54:43,677 --> 01:54:46,003
What's that mean?
Who are they after?

1516
01:54:46,096 --> 01:54:49,464
Why Mr Keating of course.
The "Captain" himself!

1517
01:54:49,558 --> 01:54:53,302
You guys didn't really think he could
avoid responsibility did you?

1518
01:54:53,395 --> 01:54:57,139
Mr Keating responsible for Neil?
Is that what they're saying?

1519
01:54:57,233 --> 01:55:01,977
Well who else do you think dumb ass?
The administration? Mr Perry?

1520
01:55:02,071 --> 01:55:04,771
Mr Keating put us up
to all this crap didn't he?

1521
01:55:04,865 --> 01:55:07,399
If it wasn't for Mr Keating
Neil would be...

1522
01:55:07,493 --> 01:55:09,860
cozied up in his room right now
studying his chemistry...

1523
01:55:09,954 --> 01:55:12,029
- and dreaming of being called "Doctor"!
- That is not true Cameron!

1524
01:55:12,122 --> 01:55:14,656
You know that!
He didn't put us up to anything.

1525
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:17,242
- Neil loved acting.
- Believe what you want

1526
01:55:17,336 --> 01:55:20,005
but I say let Keating fry.

1527
01:55:20,089 --> 01:55:23,707
I mean
why ruin our lives?

1528
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:36,313
You just signed
your expulsion papers Nuwanda.

1529
01:55:39,066 --> 01:55:43,362
And if the rest of you are smart
you'll do exactly what I did!

1530
01:55:44,738 --> 01:55:47,741
They know everything anyway.

1531
01:55:47,825 --> 01:55:51,526
You can't save Keating

1532
01:55:53,122 --> 01:55:55,280
but you can save yourselves.

1533
01:56:28,365 --> 01:56:30,941
Knox Overstreet.

1534
01:56:57,394 --> 01:57:00,564
- Meeks.
- Go away. I have to study.

1535
01:57:02,233 --> 01:57:04,474
What happened to Nuwanda?

1536
01:57:04,568 --> 01:57:06,476
Expelled.

1537
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,315
What'd you tell 'em?

1538
01:57:11,408 --> 01:57:14,328
Nothing they didn't
already know.

1539
01:57:15,913 --> 01:57:18,363
Todd Anderson.

1540
01:57:39,562 --> 01:57:42,565
- Hello son.
- Hello darling.

1541
01:57:44,233 --> 01:57:46,141
Mom.

1542
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:54,149
Have a seat Mr Anderson.

1543
01:58:00,249 --> 01:58:03,836
Mr Anderson I think we've pretty well
put together what's happened here.

1544
01:58:03,919 --> 01:58:08,830
You do admit to being a part
of this Dead Poets Society?

1545
01:58:11,927 --> 01:58:14,795
Answer him Todd.

1546
01:58:16,265 --> 01:58:18,173
Yes sir.

1547
01:58:19,768 --> 01:58:22,855
I have here
a detailed description...

1548
01:58:22,938 --> 01:58:25,347
of what occurred at your meetings.

1549
01:58:25,441 --> 01:58:27,349
It describes how your teacher
Mr Keating

1550
01:58:27,443 --> 01:58:29,351
encouraged you boys
to organize this club...

1551
01:58:29,445 --> 01:58:32,698
and to use it as a source
of inspiration...

1552
01:58:32,781 --> 01:58:35,357
for reckless
and self- indulgent behaviour.

1553
01:58:35,451 --> 01:58:40,445
It describes how Mr Keating
both in and out of the classroom

1554
01:58:40,539 --> 01:58:44,533
encouraged Neil Perry to follow
his obsession with acting...

1555
01:58:44,627 --> 01:58:47,494
when he knew all along it was
against the explicit orders...

1556
01:58:47,588 --> 01:58:50,080
of Neil's parents.

1557
01:58:50,174 --> 01:58:54,084
It was Mr Keating's blatant abuse
of his position as teacher...

1558
01:58:54,178 --> 01:58:57,379
that led directly
to Neil Perry's death.

1559
01:59:07,816 --> 01:59:10,058
Read that document carefully
Todd.

1560
01:59:11,987 --> 01:59:14,479
Very carefully.

1561
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:23,249
If you've nothing
to add or amend sign it.

1562
01:59:23,332 --> 01:59:26,001
What's gonna happen
to Mr Keating?

1563
01:59:26,085 --> 01:59:30,662
I've had enough. Sign the paper Todd!

1564
01:59:34,927 --> 01:59:39,171
Grass is gramen or herba.

1565
01:59:39,265 --> 01:59:41,475
Lapis is stone.

1566
01:59:41,559 --> 01:59:45,688
The entire building
is aedificium.

1567
02:00:22,057 --> 02:00:24,299
Sit.

1568
02:00:25,561 --> 02:00:27,636
I'll be teaching this
class through exams.

1569
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:31,473
We'll find a permanent English teacher
during the break.

1570
02:00:33,235 --> 02:00:37,479
Who will tell me where you are
in the Pritchard textbook?

1571
02:00:42,411 --> 02:00:44,403
Mr Anderson?

1572
02:00:46,749 --> 02:00:49,835
- Uh in the in the Prit- -
- I can't hear you Mr Anderson.

1573
02:00:49,919 --> 02:00:53,537
In the in the in the Pritchard- -

1574
02:00:53,631 --> 02:00:56,331
Kindly inform me
Mr Cameron.

1575
02:00:56,425 --> 02:00:58,333
We skipped around a lot sir.

1576
02:00:58,427 --> 02:01:02,421
We covered the romantics and some of the
chapters on post- Civil War literature.

1577
02:01:02,515 --> 02:01:07,884
- What about the realists?
- We skipped most of that sir.

1578
02:01:07,978 --> 02:01:10,762
All right then
we'll start over.

1579
02:01:12,983 --> 02:01:16,184
What is poetry?

1580
02:01:18,113 --> 02:01:21,648
Come!

1581
02:01:24,411 --> 02:01:28,280
Excuse me.

1582
02:01:28,374 --> 02:01:30,991
I came for my personals.

1583
02:01:31,085 --> 02:01:33,327
Should I come back
after class?

1584
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:35,495
Get them now
Mr Keating.

1585
02:01:37,883 --> 02:01:41,835
Gentlemen turn to page 21
of the introduction.

1586
02:01:41,929 --> 02:01:44,546
Mr Cameron

1587
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:49,979
read aloud the excellent essay
by Dr Pritchard...

1588
02:01:50,062 --> 02:01:52,554
on "Understanding Poetry. "

1589
02:01:54,275 --> 02:01:56,433
That page has been
ripped out sir.

1590
02:01:56,527 --> 02:01:58,810
Well borrow
somebody else's book.

1591
02:01:58,904 --> 02:02:00,896
They're all ripped out sir.

1592
02:02:00,990 --> 02:02:04,358
What do you mean
"They're all ripped out"?

1593
02:02:04,451 --> 02:02:07,872
- Sir we- - Ac- -
- Never mind.

1594
02:02:11,458 --> 02:02:13,419
Read.

1595
02:02:16,672 --> 02:02:20,968
"'Understanding Poetry'
by DrJ. Evans Pritchard Ph.D.

1596
02:02:21,051 --> 02:02:23,126
"To fully understand poetry
we must first be fluent...

1597
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:25,796
"with its metre rhyme
and figures of speech.

1598
02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:27,798
"Then ask two questions.
One:

1599
02:02:27,892 --> 02:02:31,426
"How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

1600
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:33,731
"And two:

1601
02:02:33,814 --> 02:02:37,474
"How important
is that objective?

1602
02:02:37,568 --> 02:02:39,142
"Question one
rates the poem's perfection.

1603
02:02:39,236 --> 02:02:41,144
"Question two rates its importance.

1604
02:02:41,238 --> 02:02:43,146
'And once these questions
have been answered

1605
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:46,827
"determining a poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

1606
02:02:46,911 --> 02:02:49,997
If the poem's score for perfection is
plotted on the horizontal of a graph- - "

1607
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,364
- Mr Keating!
They made everybody sign it.
- Quiet Mr Anderson!

1608
02:02:52,458 --> 02:02:54,908
- You've got to believe me. It's true.
- I do believe you Todd.

1609
02:02:55,002 --> 02:02:56,994
- Leave Mr Keating.
- But it wasn't his fault!

1610
02:02:57,087 --> 02:03:00,831
Sit down Mr Anderson! One more
outburst from you or anyone else

1611
02:03:00,925 --> 02:03:02,833
and you're out
of this school!

1612
02:03:02,927 --> 02:03:04,835
Leave Mr Keating.

1613
02:03:06,347 --> 02:03:09,631
I said "Leave Mr Keating."

1614
02:03:24,823 --> 02:03:29,318
- O Captain my Captain.
- Sit down Mr Anderson.

1615
02:03:31,288 --> 02:03:33,780
Do you hear me?
Sit down!

1616
02:03:33,874 --> 02:03:36,575
Sit down!

1617
02:03:38,128 --> 02:03:41,663
This is your final warning
Anderson.

1618
02:03:41,757 --> 02:03:46,001
How dare you.
Do you hear me?

1619
02:03:46,095 --> 02:03:48,545
O Captain my Captain.

1620
02:03:49,974 --> 02:03:51,433
Mr Overstreet I warn you!

1621
02:03:51,517 --> 02:03:53,508
Sit down!

1622
02:03:55,771 --> 02:03:58,180
Sit down!

1623
02:03:58,274 --> 02:04:01,861
Sit down! All of you!
I want you seated!

1624
02:04:01,944 --> 02:04:05,030
Sit down!
Leave Mr Keating.

1625
02:04:13,455 --> 02:04:16,073
All of you down!
I want you seated!

1626
02:04:16,166 --> 02:04:19,993
Do you hear me?

1627
02:04:23,716 --> 02:04:26,833
Sit down!

1628
02:05:06,926 --> 02:05:10,043
Thank you boys.
