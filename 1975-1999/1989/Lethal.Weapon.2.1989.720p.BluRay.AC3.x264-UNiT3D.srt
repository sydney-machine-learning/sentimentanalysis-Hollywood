00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,627
Unplug it.

174
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,045
That's your sister!

175
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,464
Picture's perfect.

176
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,090
-You think so?
-Yeah.

177
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,469
-Do l know you?
-Yes, sir.

178
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,430
We had a long talk about a week ago.
Remember?

179
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,098
We did? About what?

180
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,351
-About your new hobby room.
-This is George!

181
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,231
-How you doing?
-Did you sense that I liked you?

182
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,525
Yes, sir.

183
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,487
Then sit down and be quiet.

184
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,701
-What's that you're eating?
-My tuna fish sandwich.

185
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,911
Tuna?!

186
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,580
Daddy, you can't eat tuna.

187
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,248
Dad killed Flipper.

188
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,167
We're boycotting tuna.

189
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,254
They kill the dolphins that get caught
in the nets. Only albacore.

190
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,006
-What?
-Have ham.

191
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,549
Eat Miss Piggy.

192
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,969
-I'm sorry!
-Its only my eye.

193
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,851
Oh, my God! It's coming on!

194
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,022
My baby!

195
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,359
Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?

196
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,328
ANNOUNCER:
When the time has come...

197
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,122
...and the moment is right...

198
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,333
...remember...

199
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,253
...use Ramses Extra Condoms.

200
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:40,963
We do!

201
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,798
Ramses Extra.

202
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,343
Because caring means
all the protection you can get.

203
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,310
Trish.

204
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,854
Take the kids upstairs.

205
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,898
We learn this in human development.

206
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,568
In human what?!
Human development what?!

207
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,444
CARRIE:
Development. Chill out.

208
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,862
TRISH:
Upstairs.

209
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,614
Nick, upstairs.

210
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,325
You know how your father is.

211
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,078
-l looked fat.
-l liked you.

212
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,122
-George.
-Yes, sir?

213
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,707
Home. Out.

214
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,625
-But, sir--
-George, I got a gun.

215
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,919
Yes, sir.

216
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,341
What's with you?
She looked beautiful.

217
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,262
I liked it. She made me want
to buy rubbers right now.

218
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,314
I thought it was great.
Rianne, that was just--

219
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,650
-l thought you were terrific.
-Really?

220
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,777
I think she's got a future.
Don't you?

221
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,655
-Yeah, she was good.
-George is afraid of Daddy.

222
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,073
Stick around.

223
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,867
Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.

224
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,412
Yeah, but it's an old gun,
and he's not a very good shot.

225
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,790
That's good.
I'm going anyway. Good night.

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,710
RIANNE: I'll buy you a beer.
RIGGS: Let him buy the beer.

227
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,128
You're under 21 .

228
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,088
Be back by midnight.

229
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,634
Wait and see.
Cops never let up, you know?

230
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,554
I'll have rubbers on my desk,
in the mail, in the coffee....

231
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:17,351
If you'd only shut your mouth. You
told everybody. I'm going for a walk.

232
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,687
Give the boys some credit.
In one ear, out the rubber.

233
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,489
[KNOCKING]

234
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,952
How goes it with you, Hans?

235
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,622
Okay. You, Pieter?

236
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,417
That's quite enough of that.
Come on over here, Hans.

237
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,923
Mind the plastic.
I'm having some painting done.

238
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,468
The important thing is,
are you all right?

239
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,762
No bones broken?

240
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,764
I'm fine, thank you.

241
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,641
Just bumps and bruises, eh?

242
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,810
Yeah, that's all.

243
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,603
Good, good.

244
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,943
However, we did lose over $1 million
in Krugerrand.

245
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,447
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.

246
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,449
It happens.

247
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,618
It's not your fault.

248
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,955
Sometimes these things
do not go as planned.

249
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,167
As you say, they just happen,
eh, Pieter?

250
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,512
You give a whole new meaning
to the word "drop cloth."

251
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,475
Certain policemen in this city
have become an intolerable nuisance.

252
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:45,647
They are obviously onto us again.
How do you propose to handle it?

253
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,315
Warn them off.

254
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,652
It's my experience...

255
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,573
...that a scared cop is
more useful than a dead one.

256
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,199
A warning?

257
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,326
Is that not a bit tame?

258
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,162
Depends how you do it.

259
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,999
Then you'd better look at this.

260
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,884
This is the policeman in charge.

261
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,804
PIETER:
Goddamn kaffir.

262
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,599
Lovely.

263
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,310
TRISH:
Remember to take these in order.

264
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,189
There's a packet
for each day of the week.

265
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,732
Thank you.

266
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,192
This yours?

267
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,694
I found it in the wash.

268
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,071
Yeah.

269
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,366
Thanks.

270
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,952
I keep on losing this.

271
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,205
Something's wrong.

272
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,042
No, not really.
It's just a goddamn pen.

273
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,338
What about the pen?

274
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,715
It just reminds me of something.

275
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,884
Reminds you of what?

276
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,220
It reminds me of...

277
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,388
...the night Vicki was killed.

278
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,891
I didn't mean to push.

279
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,145
That's okay.
We never really talked about this.

280
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,571
I was supposed to meet her for dinner,
one of those romantic dinners for two.

281
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,156
I had so much work.

282
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,452
I forgot about the whole thing.

283
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,458
She waited at the restaurant for
an hour before she drove home alone.

284
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,256
It was midnight when I got home
to a ringing phone, so I answered it.

285
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,925
They told me she was killed
in a car crash.

286
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,767
I should've been driving.
We'd have been all right.

287
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,107
I remember falling down on my knees,
and l started shaking all over.

288
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,193
I remember thinking,
"I'm just losing it."

289
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,905
So there I was,
lying on the living room floor.

290
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,952
Lying there, and Im seeing under
the couch, and l see this gold pen...

291
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,413
...just lying there.

292
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,333
I'd been looking for it everywhere
for two months. There it is.

293
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,212
She wasn't much of a housekeeper.

294
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,467
This voice goes off inside my head,
like a drill instructor.

295
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,846
It said, "Get up! Now!"

296
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,558
I didn't feel like it,
but I got up.

297
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,685
Muscles were still working.

298
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,479
Then l drove to the hospital...

299
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,983
...identified her
and signed her out with my gold pen.

300
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,486
Gold pen? Trish found
a gold pen in the laundry.

301
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,373
Look around you, Sam.
Look around you.

302
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,501
One day, Sam...

303
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,004
...this'll all be yours.

304
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,552
Find a nice bitch,
raise a couple of pups.

305
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,597
A man could live here and be happy.

306
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,688
Anybody tell you if you sit on
cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?

307
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,690
Let's go watch some TV.

308
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,281
Kaffirs!

309
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,119
Wondering about your kids?

310
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,456
You wondering what we done to them?

311
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,959
If l was you, I'd be going nuts now.

312
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,337
I'd be going fucking bananas.

313
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,007
Want to know what we done?

314
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,425
Shall l tell you?

315
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,138
You just let your imagination
run riot.

316
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,807
This has just been a warning.

317
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,895
After this, it gets bloody.
You tell your people to back off.

318
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,813
Don't be a smart kaffir.

319
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,317
Maybe we let you live, huh?
Come on, let's go.

320
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,914
Are you all right?

321
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,173
RIGGS: You didn't see a face?
MURTAUGH: No. They all had on hoods.

322
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,633
What about a voice?

323
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:51,387
That motherfucker who did talk had a
strange accent. I couldn't place it.

324
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,264
Not German, not English.

325
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,351
Kind of guttural.
You know, a shitty accent.

326
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,021
Anything like what we were chasing
the other night?

327
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,690
Yeah, kind of like that.

328
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,526
Trish and the kids?

329
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,654
They're at her sister's house
in Bellflower.

330
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:12,200
Listen up. You all heard about
what happened to Rog last night?

331
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,452
Forensics get back with anything?

332
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,788
Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.

333
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,458
The point being, we gotta watch
each other's backs and fronts.

334
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,546
You're all invited to watch my back
in poker tomorrow. You in?

335
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,757
-lf we catch these assholes.
-Count me in.

336
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,057
I got something special for you boys.

337
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,227
Leo Getz has been placed
in protective custody.

338
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:43,189
You guys are gonna babysit him
until Washington sends the feds.

339
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,609
-How long?
-Soon as the red tape is processed.

340
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,069
Three days.

341
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:52,490
This guy Getz is gonna testify
before a commission of inquiry.

342
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,909
Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.

343
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,287
I'll be there in 1 0 minutes.

344
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,582
This is not a shit assignment.

345
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,917
-Yes, it is.
ED: No, it isn't.

346
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,086
-It isn't.
-Its a shit assignment.

347
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,754
Shut up, the both of you.

348
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,089
Here you go, sir.

349
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,758
-l guaranteed this guy's safety.
-Why us?

350
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,262
Because you two are
the most qualified for the job.

351
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,432
And after last night,
you could use the break.

352
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,933
I can handle last night.

353
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,436
What do we do with him?

354
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,938
How should I know?
Take him to Disneyland.

355
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,940
This stinks. This stinks.

356
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,358
I don't give a fuck.

357
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,737
I don't have an ulcer,
because l know when to say that.

358
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,448
Here's where he's staying.
It's a nice hotel.

359
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,951
Expenses are paid by the Justice
Department, so enjoy yourselves.

360
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,621
And Riggs, one more thing.

361
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,541
Know what that says?

362
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,628
Same thing as that.
But l don't give a fuck.

363
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,468
You're lucky.
I have to live with that.

364
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,020
Excuse me.

365
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,147
What room is that for?

366
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,357
612.

367
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,986
This is it. 612.

368
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,990
MAN: Who is it?
-Police.

369
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,992
How do l know that?

370
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,829
After l shoot you through the door,
you can examine the bullet.

371
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,833
Don't you want to see a badge?

372
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,502
-Where's your badge?
-Shut up.

373
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,046
I get it.
Bad cop, good cop.

374
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,839
Shut up!

375
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,343
Bad cop, bad cop.
I know the routines.

376
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,513
-Are you Leo Getz?
-That's me, Leo Getz.

377
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,267
Whatever you need, Leo gets.
You get it?

378
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,520
I use that to break the ice
when l meet people.

379
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,855
I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
This is Sgt. Riggs.

380
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,276
How you doing? Nice to meet you.
What do I call you guys?

381
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,779
-Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.
-We're gonna be your shadow.

382
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,033
That's all right.
An old-fashioned--!

383
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,496
Okay. I just ain't seen one
in a long time.

384
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,541
I didn't think anybody
used those things anymore.

385
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,794
I'll bet you the kid's got
an automatic. Got an automatic?

386
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,212
Yep, a Beretta.

387
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,630
Don't touch it.

388
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,049
You sure you guys are cops?

389
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,721
Better watch how you treat me.
I'm the state's star witness.

390
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,016
We'll take that room.

391
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,729
Actually, I already have my stuff
in this room. You know, when l....

392
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,778
Okay, okay. It's yours.
My stuff's gone.

393
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,239
I'll move it in the small room, okay?

394
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,118
I'm the smallest guy here.
I'll take the small room.

395
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,788
Come on, loosen up a little, guys.
We'll be together a long time.

396
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,248
[KNOCKING]

397
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,416
I'll get it.

398
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,794
It's only room service.

399
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,672
You hungry? Ill call
and get anything you want.

400
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,425
See this silk robe?
Silk pajamas? Free!

401
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,260
-Its not free.
-Yes, it is!

402
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,555
-Its taxpayers' money.
-Oh, God! Its the same thing.

403
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,685
Good morning, gentlemen.

404
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,318
That's my food! You guys didn't
want anything. Bring it here.

405
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,779
It's mine. Boy!

406
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,448
You could've had anything you wanted.

407
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,825
I ordered eggs, not hamburger.

408
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,500
Martin, not the window!

409
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,462
Shit!

410
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,614
Where is that son of a bitch?

411
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,160
RIGGS: Somebody stop that guy!
Stop him!

412
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,332
Don't leave me! l can't swim!

413
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,751
RIGGS:
Get off me!

414
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,002
Get off me!

415
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:21,634
We're near the edge of the pool.
Now get the fuck off my back.

416
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,345
Clear, move it! Get back! Police!

417
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,431
You all right?

418
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,392
I'm okay.
Why didn't you follow me down?

419
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,019
-Why didn't you?
-l was seven floors up!

420
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,439
He hit me.

421
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,690
Good!

422
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,650
Leo.

423
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,736
This guy took an awful chance
to pop all of us.

424
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,738
Did you witness a murder?

425
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,074
No, nothing like that. Honest.

426
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:52,165
All I did was, l laundered
half a billion dollars in drug money.

427
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,209
Half a billion dollars?

428
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:59,046
Give or take a few.
Who could count with that much money?

429
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,717
Could l please have some cotton balls
for my nose?

430
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,886
Could you please shut up?

431
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,389
-You're supposed to take care of me.
-Shut up!

432
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:13,311
Mr. Getz got away. Our best
opportunity, and he gets away.

433
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:18,274
He slips right through our fingers
and into the hands of the police.

434
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,234
What are you doing?

435
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,572
Just checking to see
if l was standing on plastic.

436
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,200
LEO:
Okay, l got it. Okay, here.

437
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:31,204
I'm who l am. You're a drug dealer.
I work in a bank.

438
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,998
You have money to launder.
What do you do?

439
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,500
I bring it to you.

440
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,921
-He does.
-Me? I don't understand. Why me?

441
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,464
Who am l?

442
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,257
I'll tell you.

443
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,801
You're a courier. You work for him.

444
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,929
I'm the drug dealer.

445
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:54,936
Don't you have plates?
Here. Come on. What is this?

446
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:01,317
I deposit the cash into the account
of a dummy finance company.

447
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,780
Then l issue you a cashier's check
in his name...

448
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,741
...minus a small commission
for myself.

449
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,494
-You like breathing?
-How much?

450
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,870
Two percent.

451
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,624
Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.

452
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,837
You give it back to me as collateral
on a loan l make to you.

453
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,633
But you don't pay back the loan.
You keep the money.

454
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,884
How's that work?

455
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,679
How's what? That's it!
Don't you get it?

456
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,808
It's your money. You don't pay
it back. Its yours, and it's clean!

457
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,269
It is now laundered.

458
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,981
You cops aren't too bright, are you?

459
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,566
Okay, okay, okay.

460
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,985
This is the best part. You got it?

461
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,363
You take a tax deduction...

462
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,367
...on interest payments
that you don't even make.

463
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,329
-Am I a genius?
-You're a swindler.

464
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,497
Cheat!

465
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,040
Come on.

466
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,043
Everybody cheats.
Look at the Pentagon.

467
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,587
So you got it?

468
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,675
Okay, Mr. Big Shot,
how come you turned yourself in?

469
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,386
I was scamming those guys for months.

470
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,763
Every transaction, I kept a little.

471
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,973
You?

472
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,559
It was easy.
All those cash deposits.

473
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,187
Millions of dollars in small bills
changing hands.

474
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,524
Who's gonna miss $1 0,000 here,
$20,000 there?

475
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,860
Drug dealers.

476
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,070
That's right. They did.

477
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,115
That's why I'm living
out of a suitcase now.

478
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,369
You can give that to Nick.

479
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,040
I'll bet you it's softer.
I put fabric softener in.

480
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,249
It's small, Leroy.

481
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,629
It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if
you want, Ill buy you another shirt!

482
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,840
Do me a favor. Give me the names
of those drug dealers.

483
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,844
I don't know any drug dealers.
All I dealt with was couriers.

484
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:56,057
-Where does Trish keep my laundry?
MURTAUGH: On the shelf in back.

485
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,894
You never met anyone except couriers?

486
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,897
No names.

487
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,236
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come to think of it....

488
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,613
Okay, listen.

489
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,867
They took me up to the hills
in this house with stilts on it.

490
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,953
And l had a job interview
with a guy...

491
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,247
...and his name was...

492
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,750
...Haynes. Hans!

493
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,252
-Take us there.
-We have to sit on this guy.

494
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,296
It won't do any harm to look.

495
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,799
-l know the address.
-Let's go.

496
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,008
We shouldn't!

497
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,260
Come on, don't be a killjoy!

498
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,013
We're back, we're bad!
You're black, Im mad.

499
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,015
This is going to be great!

500
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:41,102
If we're going,
shouldn't l have a gun?

501
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,311
No!

502
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,190
Is my nose still bleeding?
It's really sore.

503
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,109
I'm sorry about that.

504
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,740
LEO:
It should be coming up soon.

505
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,284
-9856.
RIGGS: That's it.

506
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,788
-That's another possibility.
-This is the ninth possibility.

507
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,125
That's it! Nine. My lucky number.

508
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,669
Stay in the car, you hear?

509
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,880
LEO: Can't l come?
RIGGS: Stay.

510
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,467
Nice car.

511
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,886
WOMAN: What are you doing?
MAN: Hooking it up.

512
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,139
WOMAN: You're not looking
at what you're doing!

513
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,435
MAN: l know what Im doing. Im
towing your car, not a baby carriage.

514
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,895
WOMAN: You're chipping the paint.
I can hear it!

515
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,774
-You smell what I smell?
-l smell something.

516
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,484
What's that? A rat?

517
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,903
A stinky one too.

518
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,658
Where you going?

519
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,494
I'm a peeping Tom.
It goes with the badge.

520
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,204
It's fun sometimes too.

521
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,166
Bingo!

522
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,838
Lars, look!

523
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,923
LARS:
What the fuck?

524
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,678
Hey! Hey!

525
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,847
-Where's the pool?
-There's no pool.

526
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,223
There's no pool.

527
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,350
This house is built on stilts.

528
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,686
Stilts? No, Im sure there's a pool.

529
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,991
Cuff yourselves.

530
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,583
Not this again.

531
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,555
Riggs! Where you at?

532
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,683
Stay where you are. Don't move.

533
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,560
You all right?

534
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,020
Move that truck.

535
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,731
Give me your keys!

536
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,485
You all right?

537
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,237
Where you going?

538
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,905
That was the hotel waiter.

539
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,114
Wait for me!

540
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:00,991
Get out of here!

541
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:05,079
What are you doing? You can't
take my truck! What's going on?

542
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,042
Don't worry.
We'll bring it right back.

543
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,259
Gotcha!

544
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,761
Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!

545
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,263
Where did he go?

546
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,932
Riggs is hanging on the truck!

547
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,561
What are you doing out of the car?
Get in the car!

548
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,647
LEO:
Get back! Its police business!

549
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,900
It's a high-speed chase!
Get out of the way!

550
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,070
[SIREN WAILS]

551
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,755
Go faster! We gotta catch him
and your partner.

552
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,647
Hello, asshole!

553
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,846
Come on, come on. Give me that!

00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,406
LEO:
There they are! Hurry up!

Come on! Can't you go faster?

00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,744
MURTAUGH:
Will you shut the fuck up?

557
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,336
Look out!

558
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,587
Oh, shit!

559
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,262
LEO:
Watch out!

560
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,699
Wipeout! Its all under control.

LEO:
I told you to look out!

562
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,081
LEO: You're too old to drive this car.
MURTAUGH: Shut up!

563
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,499
And stay!

564
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,460
What do you think I am, a dog?

565
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,309
Hands behind your neck!

566
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,776
What are you doing here?
We got a lot to talk about.

567
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,152
RUDD:
What's going on?

568
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,487
Freeze, dickhead!

569
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,324
Get down here, dickhead.
It's been a bad day.

570
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,742
Show me your hands.

571
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,869
Take it easy, officer.

572
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,372
I'm not armed. l won't resist.

573
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,335
Put down your guns, gentlemen.
It's all right.

574
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,253
Do as l say!

575
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,468
COP:
Get your hands on your head.

576
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,345
Lace them behind your head!

577
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,347
You have no idea what you're doing.

578
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,976
We're professional police officers.
We do this for a living.

579
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,354
My name is Arjen Rudd.

580
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:45,150
I'm minister of diplomatic affairs
for the South African Consulate.

581
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,028
South Africa,
home of the Krugerrand.

582
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,822
Among other things.

583
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,866
These gentlemen also work
for the consulate.

584
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,369
We have diplomatic credentials--

585
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,997
Keep your hands high.

586
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,294
Give me that.

587
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,425
Everybody take it easy.
Especially you, Riggs.

588
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,512
Riggs? You Martin Riggs?

589
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,849
Of the Chicago Riggses.
What's your name?

590
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,684
Pieter Von-- Vor--

591
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,727
Fuck, Ill just call you Adolf.

592
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,523
Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?

593
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,818
-That's you.
MURTAUGH: It's official.

594
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,404
They are official.

595
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,574
Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...

596
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,452
...no diplomatic agent
may be detained or arrested--

597
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,747
Once his identity
has been established.

598
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,044
We do have a serious
diplomatic situation here...

599
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,882
...which I'll take up with your
State Department tomorrow.

600
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,093
I'm quaking in my boots,
but I'll still bring you down.

601
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,971
My dear officer...

602
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,892
...you could not even give me
a parking ticket.

603
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,063
Who is the dickhead now?

604
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,403
This house is owned by
the South African government.

605
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,655
This is South African soil.

606
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,657
Now get out of here.

607
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,910
All of you.

608
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,162
Okay.

609
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,291
Come on, let's go.

610
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,086
Hey, man, don't do it.

611
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:32,966
Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,
and Ill make you eat this thing.

612
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,637
Kaffir!

613
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,308
RIGGS: With those credentials,
Chuck Manson could get off.

614
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,810
-l went to school with him.
-Yeah, right.

615
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,982
Miss, could you step out
of the car, please?

616
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,153
Put them away. I'm sorry.

617
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,323
I'm sorry. Are you...?

618
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,284
Don't open that.

619
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,995
That is a diplomatic pouch...

620
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:05,916
...protected under Article 27
of the Vienna Convention.

621
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,168
Is he serious with this stuff?

622
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,670
Yes.

623
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,547
These are police officers,
Miss Van Den Haas.

624
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,299
They were just leaving.

625
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,845
She is a consulate secretary.

626
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,556
Give her back the briefcase.

627
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,852
Give it to her.

628
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,857
Here. Im sorry,
Miss Consulate Secretary.

629
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,442
It's only papers--

630
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,194
Don't talk to them! Come here.

631
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,197
He's a nice guy.
What's he paying you an hour?

632
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,075
How'd you like to increase your pay?
Better hours?

633
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,876
RIGGS: I'd start getting used
to that sort of view.

634
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,096
-Its the Triangle Trade again.
-The what?

635
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,057
Didn't you ever do American history
at school?

636
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,101
From molasses to rum to slaves.

637
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,478
Now it's drugs to dollars
to Krugerrands.

638
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:12,482
I know there's a dead guy
with a surfboard where his face was...

639
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:16,111
...and the State Department's
breathing down our throats.

640
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,782
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African Consulate.

641
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,200
Apologize?

642
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,703
He's a sack of shit!
He's dirty, a crook.

643
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,622
It doesn't matter if he's dirty.
He's a diplomat.

644
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:32,127
He's got immunity. We can't
touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.

645
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,546
Is that clear?
Does that spell it out?

646
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,756
Yes, sir.

647
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,551
-Who the hell is this guy?
-Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.

648
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:46,099
You took a civilian on a bust.
A civilian you're supposed to protect!

649
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,269
-He's alive, isn't he?
-Its okay. l signed a waiver.

650
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,939
-Besides, I usually wait in the car.
-Usually? Usually?

651
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,233
They're very adamant about that.

652
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,612
-l don't give a fuck.
-They're good cops. They're the best.

653
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,114
One time, a guy was waving a gun--

654
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,616
What'd he say?

655
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:05,827
What did he say?

656
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,413
"I don't give a fuck."
It's his mantra.

657
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,750
Why is everybody's ass parked
on my desk? Up! Up!

658
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,544
It's a rubber plant!

659
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,756
I had nothing to do with it.
Looks like a week's supply.

660
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:18,965
Go spit.

661
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,302
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You're too old for that shit.

662
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,557
COP: lf you don't like it,
you can exchange it.

663
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,784
Thank you, Mr. Rudd.

664
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,500
One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.

665
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,966
I hope you understood
what was happening here today.

666
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,010
I'd rather not jump
to any wrong conclusions.

667
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,513
Why don't you explain it to me?

668
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:11,393
The policies of our government are not
popular here in America, as you know.

669
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,397
The police department of this city
is overrun with blacks.

670
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,109
They have badges and guns,
and they hate us.

671
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,862
Our consulate, its staff...

672
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:26,491
...and particularly myself will always
be targets for their harassment.

673
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,750
Good night, Mr. Rudd.

674
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,055
RUDD:
Things are getting out of hand.

675
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,516
We are suffering too many losses.

676
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,644
We have to move the cash
in one large shipment.

677
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:57,272
PIETER: We'll need something bigger
than a suitcase.

678
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:01,401
RUDD: Ill worry about that.
You worry about the police.

679
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,279
Your warning did not work.

680
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,164
-Let's go!
-Im coming.

681
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,541
Come on! Move!

682
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,085
Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?

683
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,088
-Big deal. I've gotta eat too.
MURTAUGH: Come on, Leo.

684
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,466
RIGGS:
Give me the food.

685
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,724
RIGGS: Who ordered the super combo?
MURTAUGH: Over here.

686
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:34,935
LEO:
I get a steak sandwich.

687
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,228
RIGGS:
Who gets Leo?

688
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,313
You got a big, empty house.

689
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,899
I got a trailer.
What will l do with him?

690
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,401
My place is too small. You take him.

691
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,945
I had him last night.

692
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,696
Excuse me, fellas!

693
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,950
This is tuna. l hate tuna.

694
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,078
I refuse to get stuck with tuna.
Now, come on.

695
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,831
-Don't eat the tuna.
-Where were you? l just said that!

696
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,626
I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.

697
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,336
We're not going back. Shut up!

698
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,506
Sure, don't go back.
Okay, don't go back. That's it.

699
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,968
Can l give you two guys
a friendly piece of advice?

700
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,805
Never go up to the drive-through.
Always walk up to the counter.

701
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,974
You know why? Let me tell you.

702
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,811
They fuck you
at the drive-through, okay?

703
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,023
They know you'll be miles away
before you find out you got fucked.

704
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,609
They know you won't
turn around and go back.

705
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,654
They don't care.
Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!

706
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,656
I'm not eating this tuna!

707
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,366
Shut up!

708
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,732
Good morning, Mr. Rudd.

709
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,193
-Get rid of that man.
-Yes, sir.

710
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:54,240
Sorry, you're gonna have to leave
the premises right now.

711
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,377
RIKA:
The morning faxes.

712
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:46,167
Sam, come here. What's the matter?
He kick you out of the house?

713
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,587
Here, Sam. I want you
to bite Leo for me.

714
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,681
Leo. Leo!

715
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,975
What are you doing?

716
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,144
I'm cleaning up this pigsty.

717
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,479
I like living the way I live.

718
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:10,817
When's the last time you did
the refrigerator? The pan under it?

719
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,652
-There's a pan under there?
-Oh, please. Come on.

720
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,945
[PHONE RINGS]

721
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,906
Where's my phone?
Where the fuck is everything?

722
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,700
Where's my TV?

723
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,827
Everything is outside.

724
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,620
Just stop what you're doing.

725
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,040
-Get the dog out of here!
-You go before the mutt.

726
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,001
Out, out! Oh, man!

727
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,964
Hello.

728
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:34,841
WOMAN:
Riggs, it's Collins.

729
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,553
-Has Murtaugh checked in with you?
-No, he hasn't. Why?

730
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,015
I haven't heard from him.
He doesn't answer his phone.

731
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,184
I'll be right there.

732
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,441
Stay in the car.

733
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,692
Get in there.

734
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,322
Roger!

735
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,366
MURTAUGH:
I'm upstairs!

736
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,036
Should I call 999,
"Officer in distress"?

737
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,497
I'll cover the back!

738
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,166
-Where are you?
MURTAUGH: I'm up here.

739
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,223
Rog?

740
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,934
-Rog?
-In here.

741
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,908
Good morning.

742
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,502
First time in 20 years
I got the bathroom all to myself.

743
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,256
No kids banging on the door.
No wife asking me to hurry up.

744
00:52:56,507 --> 00:53:00,009
Just me and my new
Salt Water Sportsman magazine.

745
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,605
Is that the one with the article
on deep-sea fishing?

746
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,734
Yeah.

747
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,702
Sitting here reading about marlin
fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...

748
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:31,124
...when I glanced over,
I saw this.

749
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,044
Oh, Jesus!

750
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,130
Is that all?

751
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:41,050
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Scared the shit out of you?

752
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,970
How long you been here?

753
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,889
I've been here all night.

754
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,058
My legs are so goddamn numb,
I don't know if l can--

755
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,602
Don't move.

756
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,061
I can't.

757
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,023
Just stay that way. Do you mind?

758
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,902
A dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

759
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,451
Okay, okay, okay.

760
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,460
Tell me I'm not fucked.

761
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:17,337
He's fucked.

762
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,841
Okay, but Id be lying.

763
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,428
You'll be okay if you don't stand up.

764
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:26,846
That's a relief.

765
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,474
-Ill have to get help.
-No way!

766
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,476
Why?

767
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,563
I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.

768
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:39,859
This is serious.
I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.

769
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:41,152
Bomb Squad?

770
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:49,077
Okay, call them in.

771
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,829
-Martin?
-Yeah?

772
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,958
Call them, but don't use
the open frequency.

773
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:57,710
Riggs!

774
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,173
Let's keep this quiet, okay?

775
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,634
Sure. Trust me.

776
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,111
Excuse me, please.

777
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,405
WOODS:
Officer, an escort isn't necessary.

778
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:29,409
I know you're a psychiatrist,
but it's not a pretty sight.

779
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,037
I have helped policemen through
the most traumatic moments.

780
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,916
Believe me, there is nothing
in this room that I cannot handle.

781
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,421
I was wrong.

782
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,256
Excuse me.

783
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:46,676
Riggs.

784
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,929
I should've known.
Where there's one, there's the other.

785
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,729
Split.

786
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,732
You're the psychiatrist?
I have these dreams.

787
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,151
It's ready to come out.

788
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,321
Hey! Hey!
I gotta live in this house!

789
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,616
Clear this room.

790
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,037
Come on, Riggs.

791
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,792
-You too, Riggs.
-No.

792
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,254
Riggs. Out.

793
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,013
All right.

794
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,848
Sergeant.

795
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,641
Dive into the tub.

796
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,479
When you do, pull the bomb blanket
over your head.

797
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:43,775
This is a good cast-iron tub.
It'll withstand a hell of a blast.

798
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,276
I can't do it.

799
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:48,529
He can't do it.
He's been on there for 1 8, 20 hours.

800
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,656
He can't even walk.

801
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,658
I'll have to help him.

802
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,495
All right, you better wear this.

803
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,790
-How's the nitrogen?
-Almost there.

804
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,172
What he's doing is spraying
this thing with liquid nitrogen...

805
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,175
...to give you a second
or two before detonation.

806
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:12,053
-Got that?
-A second or two. Thanks a lot.

807
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,721
Lights out!

808
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,515
Get him up and out.

809
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,937
-Let's go.
-Move!

810
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,191
-Good luck.
-Baker.

811
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,360
You got a piece?

812
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,403
-A Smith & Wesson.
-Try this.

813
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,864
Safety's on. Ill collect it later.

814
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,243
Good luck.

815
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,206
All right, let's move.

816
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,964
Well....

817
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,134
Alone at last.

818
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:55,429
Why didn't they plant
the bomb in Trish's stove?

819
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,058
Think of all the needless suffering
that could have ended.

820
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,490
I'm gonna die on the toilet.

821
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,243
Guys like you don't die on toilets.

822
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,413
Anyway, I'm here, and l don't
plan on going just now.

823
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,083
Let's do it.

824
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:31,799
On "three."

825
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,427
Wait, let me get into the tub.

826
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,888
I'm just gonna give you the--

827
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,640
On "three," huh? What do you say?

828
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,311
One...

829
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:46,314
-...two--
-Wait!

830
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,110
Do we do it on "three"...

831
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,487
...or "one, two, three"...

832
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:56,115
-...then do it?
-Well, it's your ass.

833
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,408
It's up to you.

834
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,036
My ass, yeah.

835
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,495
"Three."

836
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,289
We go on "three"?

837
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,958
"One, two" and then "three"!

838
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,504
One....

839
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,215
-Martin?
-What?

840
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,181
I know.

841
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,975
I mean it, man.

842
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:27,230
I hear you.

843
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,318
We're not gonna fucking die,
all right?

844
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,654
On "three."

845
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:36,864
One...

846
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,741
...two...

847
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,326
...three!

848
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,379
LEO:
I gotta go! l gotta go!

849
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,900
Get off me. l don't want
anybody to see us like this.

850
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,239
Mr. Jones?

851
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,075
Sit down, please.

852
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,871
What can I do for you today?

853
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,874
I have this problem,
this very delicate matter.

854
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,711
My friend wants to emigrate
to South Africa.

855
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,213
Of course, I can help him do that.

856
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,882
I want you to talk him out of it.

857
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,801
Talk him out of it?

858
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,594
Whatever for?

859
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:45,099
This is a bad time for him to go.
I mean, with all the trouble.

860
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:48,269
Ask your friend to come back

to go to South Africa.

I can only make chili.

-No.

his diplomatic credentials.

1027
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,769
He's not a very nice guy.

1028
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:01,984
Then whatever he's doing,
he shouldn't get away with it.

What do you want? Im a cop!

01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:26,091
