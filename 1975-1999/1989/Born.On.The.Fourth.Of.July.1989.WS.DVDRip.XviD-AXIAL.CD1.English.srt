1
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,635
It was a long time ago.

2
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,513
Sometimes I can still
hear their voices

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,959
across Sally's woods.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,515
There was Billy,
Steve, Tommy,

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,876
and the tall kid from
down the street... Joey.

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,791
Yeah, it was
Joey Walsh.

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,189
My best friend
was Timmy Burns

8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,874
who lived two blocks
away from me.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,878
We turned the woods
into a battlefield

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,038
and dreamed that someday
we would become men.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,879
Did you hear it?

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,552
What?

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,549
Let's go, Timmy!
Let's go!

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,511
Come on, Major!

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,950
They've got to be
somewhere, Ronnie.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,519
Watch out.

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,154
You've got to stay
in the ravine.

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,229
Shh.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,913
Shh.

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,512
Go! Go! Go!

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,318
Look, there they are!

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,112
Wipe them out!

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,310
Aah!

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,793
Aah!

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,949
- Aah!
- Aah!

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,678
Aah!

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,438
- Aah!
- Aah!

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,630
You're dead,
and you know it!

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,272
No, I'm not!

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,038
Ronnie's dead!

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,509
No, I'm not!
No, I'm not!

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,398
Look at the mayor.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,914
I wonder where your mom is.

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,311
Where is that woman?

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,311
Hey!

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,552
Hi.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,476
3 o'clock,
4 o'clock rock

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,635
5, 6, 7 o'clock

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,755
8 o'clock rock

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,149
9, 10, 11 o'clock,
12 o'clock rock

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,515
We're gonna rock
around the clock tonight

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,788
Put your glad rags on

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,114
And join me, hon

44
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,390
We'll have some fun
when the clock strikes 1:00

45
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,597
We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,510
Donna!

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,113
Donna,
come back here!

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,077
Get out of the way!

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,673
Hey, you boys! Stop that!

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,755
When the band slows down

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,034
We're gonna yell for more

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,678
We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,551
Donna! Donna!

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,234
Stevie Boyer
just gave Mary Barnett a ring.

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,673
Can you believe it?

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,159
Over there.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,116
O.K.

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,633
Come here,
come here.

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,994
What is this?

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,479
Is this
a firecracker?

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,475
What's wrong with you?

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,193
Hey!

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,156
Hey!

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,074
This is boring.

65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,991
Yeah, square, man.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,355
Look, Daddy,
the soldiers!

67
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,516
Happy birthday,
Ronnie Kovic.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,476
For me?

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,913
Yes. Open it.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,353
That's really
nice, Donna.

71
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,793
Say thank you,
Ronnie.

72
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,917
Thanks, Donna, but
you didn't have to.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,638
Going to
the woods tonight?

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,033
They'll have
fireworks there.

75
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,991
Should be
a real blast.

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,916
Yeah, O.K.

77
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,598
What is it?
Open it.

78
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,193
Leave him alone.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,070
Beautiful.

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,315
Hey, it's
the real thing, Ronnie.

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,753
Feel that.

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,518
Just like
Mickey Mantle, Ronnie.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,915
Ain't he
a 4th of July firecracker

84
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,313
in that hat?

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,353
Yeah. He's my little
Yankee Doodle boy.

86
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,193
Hey, get it!
Get it!

87
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,719
Come on!

88
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,472
Let's go!

89
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,279
Did you like it?

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,713
I don't know.

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,153
I don't know.

92
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,471
Hey, look how many
push-ups I can do.

93
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,072
Wow! Yeah!

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,109
Yeah!

95
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,430
Come on, Ronnie!

96
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,469
Go, Ronnie, go!

97
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,869
Go, Ronnie!
You can do it!

98
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,075
Go!

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,351
Yes!

100
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,915
Yes! That's my boy!

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,797
That's my boy!

102
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,712
Yes!

103
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,548
Ronnie, you made it!

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,672
Yeah, all right!

105
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,230
Tommy! Ronnie!
Come on!

106
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,350
You're going to miss it!

107
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,590
Michelle! Barbara!

108
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,232
You've got to see this!

109
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,834
Not as a call
to bear arms,

110
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,273
though arms we need,

111
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,920
but a call
to bear the burden

112
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,837
of a long
twilight struggle,

113
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,031
a struggle against
the common enemies of man...

114
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,790
tyranny, poverty,
disease, and war itself.

115
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,434
You'll get a licking
if you're late!

116
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
In the long history
of the world,

117
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,157
only a few generations
have been granted the role

118
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,310
of defending freedom...

119
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,719
Look, President Kennedy,
Daddy.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,676
That's right.

121
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,113
He's so handsome.

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,794
I do not shrink
from this responsibility,

123
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,990
I welcome it.

124
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,874
Let the word go forth
from this time and place

125
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,275
that the torch
has been passed

126
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,675
to a new generation
of Americans

127
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,757
born in this century.

128
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,434
Let every nation know

129
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,950
that we shall
pay any price,

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,230
bear any burden,

131
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,791
support any friend,
oppose any foe

132
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,751
to assure the survival

133
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,558
and the success
of liberty.

134
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,473
I had a dream, Ronnie,
the other night,

135
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,120
and you were speaking
to a large crowd

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,792
just like him.

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,199
Just like him.

138
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,589
And you were saying
great things.

139
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,477
And so,
my fellow Americans,

140
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,075
ask not what your country
can do for you,

141
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,914
ask what you can do
for your country.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,230
Right! Right up!

143
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,236
Get out!
Got to get out!

144
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,639
You got to get out!

145
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,073
You got to get out!

146
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,594
Hit that switch!
Hit the switch!

147
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,193
All right,
hit the ropes!

148
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,793
Go, go, go!

149
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,359
Hand over hand over hand!

150
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,237
Get those legs
off those ropes!

151
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,436
Come on, ladies,
let's come down!

152
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,833
Let's come down!

153
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,273
That rope is like life!

154
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,749
You grab it
and hang onto it! Next!

155
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,479
I want you to kill!

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,589
You hear me?

157
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,556
Yes, sir!

158
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,516
Kill!

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,953
I want that
conference championship!

160
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,871
Do you want that conference
championship?

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,949
Yes, sir!

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,353
Get up! Heads!

163
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,670
Get them up!
Do you hear me?

164
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,957
Get your heads up, ladies!
Get your heads up!

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,395
I want that
conference championship!

166
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,318
If you want to win,
you got to suffer!

167
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,237
You want to be the best?

168
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,510
You got to pay the price
for victory,

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,477
and the price is sacrifice!

170
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,632
Susanne, no homework
at the table, please.

171
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,631
No, Tommy.
After supper.

172
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,556
Dad?

173
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,516
Yeah?

174
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,999
Can I come
with you?

175
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,871
There's the next
conference champion.

176
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,359
Sorry I'm late, Ma.

177
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,753
There's rice
on the stove

178
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,239
and fruit
in the icebox.

179
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,190
I can't.

180
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,593
It's on your diet,
right?

181
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,478
I got to drop 3 pounds
by Saturday.

182
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,391
Your brother's
a hard worker, Tommy,

183
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,869
'cause he wants
to be the best.

184
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,599
Win or lose... in school,
in sports, in life...

185
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,478
as long
as you do your best,

186
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,476
that's what matters
to God.

187
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,790
Win or lose,
we still love him.

188
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,717
Can I go
to my room?

189
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,670
Yeah, sure.

190
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,551
Thank you, God,
for this food.

191
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,798
In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Ghost, amen.

192
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,552
Daddy, Jimmy
took my doll!

193
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,993
I'll get the doll.

194
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,399
I hate his guts!

195
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,833
Just go to bed.

196
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,273
I didn't take anything!

197
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,713
Where's
your sister's doll?

198
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,553
Jackie? Why
is Jackie not in bed?

199
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,669
Ronnie.

200
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,273
Where'd
you get this?

201
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,715
Why are you
in my room?

202
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,552
Don't change
the subject.

203
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,353
I don't allow Playboy magazine
in this house.

204
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,350
Stevie gave it to me.

205
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,231
You have filthy,
impure thoughts!

206
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,753
God's going
to punish you.

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,633
I haven't even looked
at it yet, all right?

208
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,990
Go to confession. I want you
to tell Father McKenna.

209
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,349
I don't want to see
this filthy magazine

210
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,799
in my house again.

211
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,273
Now, take this away!

212
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,713
What's going on?

213
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,676
Nothing.

214
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,119
What do you mean,
nothing?

215
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,912
Nothing, Dad. O. K?

216
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,192
You're out of bounds, guys.
Back inside.

217
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,238
Come on, Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.

218
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,630
Go, Ronnie.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,109
Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.

220
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,479
Back inside.
Let's go.

221
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,437
I want to see
some explosion!

222
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,879
Come on, Ronnie!

223
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,512
No messing around!

224
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,477
You're great, Ronnie!
You're great, Ronnie!

225
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,879
Stay with him!

226
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,791
Come on down!
All right!

227
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,711
O.K. Get off
the mat.

228
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,153
You're going
to get...

229
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,835
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!

230
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,433
Reversal.
2 points!

231
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,590
All right!

232
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,392
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!

233
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,839
Ohh, you!

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,991
One, red!
You're both up.

235
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,508
All right, fresh start.
Fresh start.

236
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,353
Stand up.
Don't let him get you!

237
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,793
Don't
let him get you!

238
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,711
Pull him out!
All right!

239
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,119
Watch those legs.
Watch him!

240
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,839
Get him down!
Don't let him get the neck!

241
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,438
No! No!

242
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,993
No!

243
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,110
You can beat him,
Ronnie!

244
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,151
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

245
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,593
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

246
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,514
Bridge! Bridge!

247
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,916
You can win!
Don't give up!

248
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,438
Aah!

249
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,513
Oh, no!

250
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,358
O.K., son?

251
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,559
Oh, no.

252
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,596
Come on. Get up.

253
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,192
Attention!

254
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,157
Forward march!

255
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,310
Left, left.

256
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,913
Left, right, left.

257
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,798
Seats!

258
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,952
Good morning.

259
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,395
I am Gunnery
Sergeant Hayes.

260
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,839
This is
Sergeant Bowers.

261
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,555
United States Marine Recruiting Station,
Levittown, New York.

262
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,993
We are here today

263
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,032
at the request of your principal
Mr Richards

264
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,150
and other members
of the faculty

265
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,988
to tell you a little bit
about the Marine Corps.

266
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,752
First off,
young men,

267
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,836
let's get
one thing straight.

268
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,074
Not everybody becomes
United States Marines.

269
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,599
We want the best,

270
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,989
and we'll accept nothing
but the best,

271
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,957
because there
is nothing prouder,

272
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,600
nothing finer, nothing
standing as straight

273
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,473
as a United States Marine.

274
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,551
Now, they've got the Army.

275
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,477
They got the Navy.

276
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,120
They got
the Air Farce.

277
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,555
And if you want
to join them,

278
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,953
be my guest.

279
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,474
But if you want
a challenge...

280
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,632
if you want to try
something difficult...

281
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,513
if you want to try to
achieve the impossible...

282
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,398
you try 13 weeks of hell

283
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,839
at Parris Island,
South Carolina,

284
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,838
and you'll find out
if you got what it takes.

285
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,077
You'll find out
if you really are a man,

286
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,675
then the Marines may be
what you're looking for.

287
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,034
Tarawa...

288
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,314
Iwo Jima...

289
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,794
Belleau Wood...

290
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,110
the frozen
Chosin Reservoir.

291
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,633
First to fight.
We have never lost a war.

292
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,837
We have always come when
our country's called us.

293
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,115
Now, Sergeant Bowers and I

294
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,555
would like to open this up
to questions.

295
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,876
So if any of you young men
do have questions,

296
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,155
go ahead
and raise your hands.

297
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,077
Come on, now.
Don't be afraid.

298
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,475
Don't forget, a good
Marine's a thinking Marine.

299
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,839
Billy Vorsovich, sir.

300
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,196
When would I get to wear
a uniform like you?

301
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,272
You can be wearing this
in 13 weeks.

302
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,869
Go! Go!

303
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,552
Go, Massapequa!

304
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,949
Go! Go! Go!

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,718
- Yay!
- Yay!

306
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,509
Hi, Donna.

307
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,678
Go! Go!

308
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,278
Go, Massapequa!

309
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,469
Go!

310
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,357
My brother's at school
at Adelphi.

311
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,274
He said there will be a war in...
what is it?

312
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,275
Vietnam.

313
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,629
The Marines will be
the first in,

314
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,591
and it won't
last long.

315
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,434
So if we don't sign up
soon, we'll miss it.

316
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,835
I've already decided.
I'm going in.

317
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,790
Really?

318
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,239
Just like that?

319
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,635
I'm not waiting.
I'm going in now.

320
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,590
You're crazy.

321
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,995
Our dads
got to go to WWII.

322
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,878
This is our chance
to be part of history.

323
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,592
Yeah, just like
our dads.

324
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,437
Think about
what you're doing.

325
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,109
It could be dangerous
over there.

326
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,156
You could
get yourself killed.

327
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,192
Where are you going,
squirrel head? College?

328
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,470
I want to do something
with my life.

329
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,835
I can get a degree in
business administration.

330
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,036
You don't need
to serve your country?

331
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,833
Don't you care
about anybody but yourself?

332
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,273
Better dead than red.

333
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,669
They got missiles pointed
at us everywhere. ICBMs.

334
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,512
Coming in
all around us.

335
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,993
Cuba now.
90 miles away.

336
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,393
They're taking over.

337
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,714
When will we stop them?

338
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,916
You can't stop them
by yourself.

339
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,757
Communism is
moving in everywhere.

340
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,115
Where, Ronnie?
I don't see them.

341
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,513
They're not here
in Massapequa,

342
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,869
so I'll just take care
of number one.

343
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,837
That's right.
Me... Stevie, number one.

344
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,713
Someone's got to stay
with the women and children

345
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,069
while the men
go do the fighting.

346
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,549
All I'm saying is,
think about it.

347
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,993
Think about it,
Ronnie.

348
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,753
Stevie, who are you taking
to the prom?

349
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,159
Wendy Daniels.

350
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,116
Wendy Daniels?

351
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,076
Wendy Daniels?

352
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,792
He got desperate.

353
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,229
Well, who are you taking,
Joey, your mother?

354
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,068
Ronnie, who are you going
to take to the prom?

355
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,519
You don't know her.

356
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,437
She's a pretty girl
from Ronkonkoma.

357
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,873
What's her name?

358
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,069
You don't know her.

359
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,957
What's her name,
Ronnie?

360
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,359
Her name
is Lombardi.

361
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,316
Lombardi?

362
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,276
Yeah.

363
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,918
Vince Lombardi?

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,911
Rosanna Lombardi.

365
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,837
She's from
out of town, right?

366
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,757
She going
to get a motel?

367
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,314
'Cause I'd like
to get in on that.

368
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,838
Ronnie, would you take this
to section three?

369
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,235
Check the stock
for dog food.

370
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,190
Dog food.

371
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,117
Then finish
stacking the potatoes.

372
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,553
Come on. Let's go.

373
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,433
Let's do some work
for a change.

374
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,357
This goes
in section three?

375
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,316
Section three.

376
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,594
O.K., Dad.

377
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,432
Hey, Donna.

378
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,555
Hi, Ronnie.

379
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,390
Hi, Ronnie.

380
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,077
Hi, Ronnie.

381
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,151
How you doing?
How's...

382
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,514
Good.

383
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,876
I heard that you were going
into the Marines.

384
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,109
Yeah, yeah.

385
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,509
It's better than
working at A&P.

386
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,953
That's great,
Ronnie.

387
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,075
That's wonderful.

388
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,991
I'm going
to boot camp soon.

389
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,911
I joined
for four years,

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,353
so I go to Vietnam,

391
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,271
probably on
the front line.

392
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,429
Really?

393
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,351
I'll see
a lot of action.

394
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,316
Wow.

395
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,038
That's neat.

396
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,429
Heard you got
into that school.

397
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,555
The letter?

398
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,675
Yeah.

399
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,159
Yeah, Syracuse.

400
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,151
It's going to be
really hard.

401
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,516
Could I... Could I talk
to you in private?

402
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,431
Oh, yeah. Sure.

403
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,395
I've been meaning
to call you.

404
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,833
I was wondering,

405
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,310
are you going with
someone to the prom?

406
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,078
Yeah. I'm going
with Jed.

407
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,554
Oh, yeah?
That's great.

408
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,438
I mean, he's
a nice guy... Jed.

409
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,873
Stevie Boyer told me

410
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,191
that you were taking some girl
from Lake Ronkonkoma.

411
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,639
Yeah. No, no.

412
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,669
No?

413
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,399
No. I don't have time
for that stuff.

414
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,278
There's a lot of things
to take care of

415
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,510
before you go
in the Marines.

416
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,114
I didn't even know
how much stuff.

417
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,754
Maybe I'll see you
before I leave, O. K?

418
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,310
Soldier boy

419
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,632
Oh, my little soldier boy

420
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:29,279
I'll be true to you

421
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,269
You were my first love

422
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,956
And you'll be my last love

423
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,716
I will never
make you blue

424
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,390
I'll be true to you

425
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,156
In this whole world

426
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,679
You can love
but one girl

427
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,591
I told you
I love you.

428
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,908
You promised.

429
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,033
Let me be
that one girl

430
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,591
For I'll be
true to you

431
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,469
The batter is
Mickey Mantle.

432
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,919
Mickey has two strikes

433
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,269
and the chance
to put the Yankees

434
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,719
ahead in this game.

435
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,637
The pitcher
gets his sign,

436
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,035
takes his stretch,
checks the runners.

437
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,513
Here's the pitch.

438
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,312
Mickey swings,
and he connects!

439
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,198
There's a long drive
deep to centre field!

440
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,633
It is going, going!

441
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,029
It is gone
into the bleachers,

442
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,270
455 feet away

443
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,796
for Mickey's
491st home run!

444
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,279
How about that?

445
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,715
The crowd is
on its feet,

446
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,637
giving Mickey
a standing ovation.

447
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,352
And rattle your walls

448
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,275
For the times,
they are a-changin'

449
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,794
Come, senators
and congressmen

450
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,472
Please heed the call

451
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,516
Don't stand in the doorway

452
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,034
Don't lock up the hall

453
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,355
For the times,
they are a-changin'

454
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,793
There's absolutely
no question.

455
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,199
The First Cavalry Division

456
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,078
is the latest concept
in mobile warfare.

457
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,513
One division is worth

458
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,160
21/2 Russian
and 6 Chinese divisions.

459
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,555
How well will
the individual soldier

460
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,511
stand up here
in Vietnam?

461
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,155
What do you think,
Dad, about that?

462
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,474
I don't know.

463
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,993
13,000 miles...

464
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,197
that's a long way to go
to fight a war.

465
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,589
They fought the French
and the Japanese

466
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,874
for 30 years.

467
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,791
Can they
be weeded out?

468
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,757
Anything
that lives in a cave

469
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,279
can be weeded out.

470
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,592
I just hope they send you
to Europe or Korea or...

471
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,715
They can't.

472
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,949
Someplace safe.

473
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,833
Every Marine has
a tour of duty there.

474
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,757
It's not like the Army.

475
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,193
What's wrong with you?

476
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,117
You served.
Uncle Bob served.

477
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,872
I know, Ronnie.
I know.

478
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,831
Remember what
President Kennedy said?

479
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,717
There won't be
an America any more

480
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,069
unless people are willing
to sacrifice.

481
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,473
I love my country.

482
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,436
I know.

483
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,919
And you're right,
Ronnie.

484
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,712
You're doing
the right thing.

485
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,478
Communism has
to be stopped.

486
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,755
It's God's will
you go.

487
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,319
We're proud of you.

488
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,913
Be careful,
that's all.

489
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,678
Up there in Hanoi,

490
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,553
they don't allow magazines,
newspapers, and televisions

491
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,068
to cast doubts
on the military system.

492
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,874
Don't you know what being a Marine
means to me, Dad?

493
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,757
Ever since
I was a kid,

494
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,149
I've wanted
to serve my country,

495
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,593
and I want to go.

496
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,511
I want to go
to Vietnam,

497
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,558
and I'll die there
if I have to.

498
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,433
The attitude of people
on the home front

499
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,954
is very important
in this war.

500
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,838
Not a nice night
for the prom.

501
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,751
Can the South Vietnamese
government

502
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,671
stand up
to the North?

503
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,113
We wouldn't
be here

504
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,679
if we didn't
think so.

505
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,635
Sometimes, God,
I'm so confused.

506
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,675
Sometimes
I think I'd just...

507
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,513
like to stay here
in Massapequa

508
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,272
and never leave...

509
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,272
but I got to go.

510
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,273
Just help me, Jesus.

511
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,920
Help me to make
the right decision.

512
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,432
Please, dear God.

513
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,599
Ron.

514
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,471
Ronnie, what
happened to you?

515
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,595
Ronnie.

516
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,753
What...

517
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,273
Oh, Jeez.

518
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,594
Donna.

519
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,590
Ronnie.

520
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,676
Will you
dance with me?

521
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,677
Oh, yes.

522
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,273
Yeah, sure.

523
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,869
Moon River

524
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,151
Wider than a mile

525
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,915
I'm crossing you
in style

526
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,754
Someday

527
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,918
Oh, dreammaker

528
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,475
You heartbreaker

529
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,836
Wherever you're goin'

530
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,118
I'm goin' your way

531
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,113
Two drifters

532
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,953
Off to see the world

533
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,879
There's such
a lot of world

534
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,635
To see

535
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,468
We're after
the same...

536
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,800
2-Alpha, 2-Alpha, this is 6, over.

537
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,393
6, 6, 2-Actual, over.

538
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,630
2-Actual, this is 6. That's a roger.

539
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,438
You have beaucoup gooks.

540
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,839
They're coming at you.

541
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,638
Echo-1's
pushing them. Over.

542
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,994
6, 6, 2-Actual.

543
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,314
Sit Rep
as follows...

544
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,277
two set in
on the beach.

545
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,157
The tracks are
moving this way.

546
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,555
Sounds like
beaucoup gooks in there.

547
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,995
I'm finally
going to see one.

548
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,877
Relax, you'll be
all right.

549
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,478
Where you from, Wilson?

550
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,351
First Battalion,
Ninth Motor "T."

551
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,233
The Sergeant Major said the grunts
needed replacements,

552
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,397
so they took me out
of battalion supply.

553
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,755
Where are you from
in the world?

554
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,193
Oh, Venus, Georgia.

555
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,872
This is my second tour.

556
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,798
I haven't seen a Georgia boy
get hurt yet.

557
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,193
You'll be all right.

558
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,879
Echo-6, Echo-6,
Snake 1-9er...

559
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,634
All right.

560
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,672
Echo-1's taking incoming
northwest edge of the ville.

561
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,028
We got gooks
moving this way.

562
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,479
Look out there,
Sergeant.

563
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,919
Can you see them?

564
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,678
Right there.
You see them?

565
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,438
They got rifles.

566
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,357
Can you see
the rifles?

567
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,118
Right there.
You see them?

568
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,559
You see them?

569
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,192
Can you see
the rifles?

570
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,078
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

571
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,473
Pass the word.

572
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,112
When I give
the order,

573
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,832
I want to light up
this ville

574
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,279
like a motherfucking
Christmas tree.

575
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,914
This time I think we got them!
Move out.

576
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,275
Pass the word!
Fire on command!

577
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,395
Wilson, come with me.

578
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,674
Cover that big hooch!

579
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,069
Fire on my command!
Pass the word!

580
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,469
Corporal, start ranking.
Fire on my command!

581
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,913
Fire on my command!

582
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,270
Cease fire!

583
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,469
What happened?

584
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,393
What the fuck are you doing?

585
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,998
Cease fire!

586
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,399
What happened?

587
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,310
Cease fire!

588
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,755
I want to know
what happened!

589
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,989
I don't know, sir.

590
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,274
Possible accidental
discharge, sir.

591
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,555
We better get
a sweep team in there.

592
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,393
Take five men.
Tell me how many we got.

593
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,356
Yes, sir.

594
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,759
Motherfucker!

595
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,631
Baldy on me!

596
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,950
Brooks!
Martinez! On me!

597
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,393
Wilson!
Wilson, on me!

598
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,278
2-alpha, moving on the ville
at this time. Over.

599
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,873
Line! Line! Line!

600
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,677
Ironhand for fire mission.

601
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,159
Stand by.

602
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,870
Grid: 1-5-6-3-7-9er.

603
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,319
Direction: 5-800.

604
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,749
Gooks in the ville,
Battery 6.

605
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,153
Victor, Tango in effect.

606
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,599
How copy? Over.

607
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,550
Baldy! Baldy!

608
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,511
Lai dai! Lai dai!

609
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,869
Get him out!
Get him out!

610
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,797
Come on,
Baldy, come on.

611
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,195
Check it out over there!
Everything out!

612
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,639
Baldy, get
everything out!

613
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,591
Baldy! There!
Check it out!

614
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,834
Echo-2, Alpha.

615
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,235
Echo-2,
send your Sit Rep. Over.

616
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,952
Lai dai! Lai dai!

617
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,314
Lai dai! Lai dai!

618
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,554
Get him out!

619
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,828
Get him out!

620
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,110
Check those hooches
and clear ASAP.

621
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,799
We've got a fire mission
inbound. Over.

622
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,835
Oh, my God.

623
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,190
We didn't
do this, did we?

624
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,639
Oh, my God.

625
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,079
Jesus Christ.

626
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,269
Oh, my God.

627
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,112
2-Actual-2, better get down
here quick,

628
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,878
and bring
the corpsmen.

629
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,117
We got beaucoup wounded.
Civilians.

630
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,390
Martinez, help me!

631
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,112
We wasted them.

632
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,675
Motherfucker!
We wasted them!

633
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,393
Oh!

634
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,753
Det roy.

635
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,313
Where are the rifles?

636
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,713
Where are the rifles?

637
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,591
There ain't no
fucking rifles.

638
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,954
Damn it.

639
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,399
Jesus fucking Christ!

640
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,833
Well, help him then!

641
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,235
Help him!
Help him! Help him!

642
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,311
Oh, motherfuck...

643
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,509
I want you
to help him.

644
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,470
Forgive us.

645
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,750
Help me!
Somebody help me!

646
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,033
6, 6, 2-Actual.

647
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,633
Request
emergency medevac.

648
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,353
We got a lot
of friendly wounded. Over.

649
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,628
Get out of there!

650
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,035
Leave those wounded!
You got Arty inbound!

651
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,229
Get out! Get out!

652
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,390
Get back
to the dunes!

653
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,113
We got gooks
in the ville! Move out!

654
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,872
Get out! Move out!

655
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,148
That's a direct order!

656
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,111
I want you
out that door!

657
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,270
It wasn't your fault,
goddamn it!

658
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,118
They got
in the goddamned way!

659
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,553
Get off the deck!

660
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,029
We got gooks
in the ville!

661
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,678
The baby!

662
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,318
Get back to the dune!

663
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,276
The baby!

664
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,713
No! Move out!
Let's move!

665
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,711
Kovic, move!

666
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,988
Move out!

667
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,479
Move out!
Move! Move!

668
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,439
The ville is
going to blow!

669
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,829
Aah!

670
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,237
Red! Abbot!

671
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,353
Aah!

672
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,518
Wilson!

673
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,834
Wilson's hit!

674
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,270
What happened?

675
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,713
Where's
First Platoon?

676
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,597
For God's sake,
Corpsman!

677
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,437
Where's my "A" gunner?

678
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,508
Sergeant Kovic
here to see you, sir.

679
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,113
Stand easy, sergeant.

680
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,751
Yeah, Kovic,
the lieutenant told me

681
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,956
that was
a pretty rough time.

682
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,195
Yes, sir.
It was pretty bad.

683
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,231
Ran into a few
of them?

684
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,429
Yes, sir.

685
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,398
You want to see me
about something, Sergeant?

686
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,509
Yes, sir.

687
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,398
Like I said to the captain,
uh, sir...

688
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,278
it was a very
confusing day.

689
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,429
The villagers...

690
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,273
Yeah. I know about
the villagers, Sergeant.

691
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,713
They...
the villagers...

692
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,631
It was very,
very unfortunate.

693
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,950
The enemy used
the villagers as cover.

694
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,075
Yes, sir.

695
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,315
They popped up,
started firing.

696
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,112
We were
running back, sir.

697
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,559
It was real glary.

698
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,993
Very confusing,

699
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,594
and that's when
it happened, sir.

700
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,874
What happened?

701
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,713
Sir, that was when
Wilson was killed, sir.

702
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,950
Yeah, I know
about Wilson.

703
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,553
Sir, see...

704
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,949
he was
the last one out,

705
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,349
and that's when
it happened, sir.

706
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,317
Sir, I think
I might...

707
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,675
I might have
killed him, sir.

708
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,113
I don't think so.

709
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,469
He was coming up
over the dune.

710
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,080
I think I might
have killed him.

711
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,189
It's hard.

712
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
I was out a couple
of weeks ago.

713
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,872
Sometimes it's... very hard
to tell what's happening.

714
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,914
Yes, sir.

715
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,078
But, sir, I think
I killed Wilson.

716
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,877
I don't think so, Kovic.

717
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,077
But, sir, I want you
to know that...

718
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,036
Don't talk like that!

719
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,519
Don't tell me this shit.

720
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,795
I'll take your head off.
Is that clear?

721
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,750
Yes, sir.

722
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,710
That clear?

723
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,829
Yes, sir!

724
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,915
All right.

725
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,038
Carry on.

726
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,392
X.O. Ought to
court-martial his ass.

727
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,199
Sergeant K.

728
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,509
Get some sugar
in the blood.

729
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,710
Ain't no thing, dog.

730
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,194
Ain't nothing
but a thing, baby.

731
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,876
It's so hot out here, I want
to kill some motherfucking gooks.

732
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,359
Dog, you're sounding
like a bitch, man.

733
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,789
Ain't nothing
but a thing.

734
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,319
Nothing but a thing.

735
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,153
It's so hot out
in this motherfucker,

736
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,196
this must be hell!

737
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,513
Or purgatory.

738
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,078
Where's the motherfucking devil at?

739
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,713
Take cover!

740
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,836
Take cover!

741
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,751
Take cover!

742
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,913
Snake 1-9er airborne,

743
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,353
Be advised machine guns

744
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,590
now approaching
at your 12. Over.

745
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,193
No. No, people!

746
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,350
Move forward!
Move forward!

747
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,510
Gun up! Gun up!

748
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,398
2! 2! 2-Alpha!
Contact! Contact!

749
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,318
Heavy incoming
from both tree lines. Over.

750
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,832
Uhh!

751
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,108
Uhh!

752
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,235
Son of a bitch!

753
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,318
Aah!

754
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,634
Aah!

755
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,790
Fuck, man!

756
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,348
Uhh.

757
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,599
Aah!

758
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,638
Aah!

759
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,436
Fuck!

760
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,873
Son of a bitch!

761
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,836
2-Actual!

762
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,592
Heavy incoming
from the ville!

763
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,999
I'm in trouble!

764
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,433
2, 2, Charlie,

765
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,550
be advised
there's more of them.

766
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,517
We see two squads
moving in

767
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,999
from the left
tree line.

768
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,874
Aah!

769
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,797
I'm in trouble
out here!

770
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,717
I'm in trouble out here!

771
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,598
2, Echo-6!
Get out of that ville!

772
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,716
Get out of that ville!

773
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,394
They're going to
cut you off! Get out!

774
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,630
I need everything
you got!

775
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,029
We're going down!
We're going down!

776
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,911
I can't hold this bitch!

777
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,997
Hold it, goddamn it!
Pull up! Pull up!

778
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,273
Aah!

779
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,593
Goddamn it!

780
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,395
God damn it!

781
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,519
Corpsmen...

782
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,559
Corpsmen...

783
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,158
Corpsmen... Corpsmen.

784
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,798
Goddamn!
Motherfuckers!

785
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,870
Goddamn motherfuckers!

786
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,394
Motherfucker!
Goddamn!

787
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,115
Motherfuckers!

788
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,191
Fuckers!

789
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,910
We got six
sucking chest wounds

790
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,076
and 12 crispy critters
coming in!

791
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,754
Zap him with 250 mils
of happy juice

792
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,028
until he crashes out.

793
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,712
Just get him to sleep.

794
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,710
Open table!

795
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,749
Who's got a hot one?

796
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,159
What do we have?

797
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,071
His kidney
and liver are gone.

798
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,515
We better just kiss
this one goodbye.

799
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,919
All right, take off.

800
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,831
There's something
wrong with me.

801
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,751
Code blue! Code blue!

802
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,637
Let's go!
He's code blue!

803
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,113
Code blue! Code blue!

804
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,628
Get the machine!
Get the machine!

805
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,709
Let me in.
Let me in.

806
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,593
Stay with me, Marine.
Stay with me!

807
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,517
Give me
the shock defibs!

808
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,993
Stay with me now.

809
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,508
We're going to
jump-start you. Clear!

810
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,518
Where's the priest?
Get me a priest.

811
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,790
Breathe! Breathe!
Breathe!

812
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,153
Breathe!

813
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,073
I took the Packers
at minus 7.

814
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,315
Shit. They ain't
got a chance.

815
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,716
How are you?

816
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,513
You tell them
they've got to operate.

817
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,437
There's something
wrong with me.

818
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,078
The doctors
are real busy.

819
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,991
There's a lot
of wounded here.

820
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,593
There's no time
for anything

821
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,398
except trying
to stay alive.

822
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,914
You got to try
and stay alive. O. K?

823
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,479
Try and stay alive.

824
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,479
I've come to give you
your last rites.

825
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,636
Are you ready?

826
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,511
I'm ready, Father.

827
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,635
I am the resurrection
and the life.

828
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,238
He that believeth in me,

829
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,510
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

830
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,391
We brought nothing
into this world,

831
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,829
and it's certain
we can take nothing out.

832
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,753
The Lord giveth, and
the Lord taketh away.

833
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,229
Blessed be the name
of the Lord.

834
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,239
I got sunshine

835
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,118
On a cloudy day

836
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,918
And when it's
cold outside

837
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,719
I got the month of May

838
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,598
Eddie, I need
some help in room 13.

839
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,557
Give me
a second, man.

840
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,789
His catheter's
plugging up.

841
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,235
It's backing up
into his kidney.

842
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,151
I said I'd be there.

843
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,196
Give me a break.

844
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,474
Man, what's going up?

845
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,470
Nothing, man.

846
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,835
You ain't supposed
to be having this.

847
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,955
Oh!

848
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,350
Didn't I tell you not
to do that to him

849
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,873
in the A. M?

850
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,956
Take the needle
out of my arm.

851
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,274
Good morning,
Nurse Washington.

852
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,548
How are you today?

853
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,949
You up bright
and early today.

854
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,109
Everybody up!

855
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,519
Good morning, gentlemen.

856
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,750
Let's rise and shine.

857
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,716
Peña!

858
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,631
Can I have some aspirin?

859
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,073
I ain't feeling well.

860
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,513
I'd like some aspirin.

861
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,431
Hmm. I'll get to you.

862
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,829
Leon! How you
doing today?

863
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,273
Look at this shit.

864
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,236
Mm-hmm!

865
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,673
My catheter's
clogged.

866
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,988
Give it a minute.

867
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,230
They're getting
bigger every day.

868
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,639
You don't bother them,

869
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,432
they ain't going
to bother you.

870
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,317
That's why
I'm feeding him.

871
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,158
Keep on feeding him,
and everything'll be fine.

872
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,395
Up and at 'em!
Frankie's here!

873
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,839
Hey, Frankie.
What's up?

874
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,598
Hopkins, come on,
wake up.

875
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,392
All you guys,
6:00 special.

876
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,316
Fuck you.

877
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,078
Fenaday,
I'm looking at you.

878
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,439
Keep looking.

879
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,238
My man Kovic.
Up already?

880
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,548
That's good. Let's go.

881
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,318
Let's do it.
Let's go.

882
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,430
Give me a hand over here.

883
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,993
How you doing,
Eddie?

884
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,196
Yeah, you about ready.
Let me have that thing there.

885
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,870
Hey, where did we go

886
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,069
Days when the rains came...

887
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,031
I think my stomach
is bloated.

888
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,433
Just take it easy.

889
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,313
Eddie going to take care
of all you boys.

890
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,237
It's like
a car wash.

891
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,508
Bernstein,
what's wrong today?

892
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,915
You got shit up you
ain't coming out.

893
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,235
Stick your head up my ass,
see what the problem is.

894
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,151
Your piss bag's
cloudy, too.

895
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,071
You been drinking
enough water?

896
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,469
You gots to flush
them kidneys every day.

897
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,278
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

898
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,839
Frankie,
I think I'm done.

899
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,148
I think I'm ready.

900
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,196
Are you fucking
with me again?

901
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,429
You better
chill out.

902
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,192
I'm not
fucking with you.

903
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,111
I'm not fucking
with you, man.

904
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,633
My man Kovic!

905
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,554
Mr 4th of July.

906
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,514
Politicians,
protesters, and police

907
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,318
are all here in Chicago

908
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,032
for the 1968
presidential election.

909
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,997
Chicago police tonight
charged the crowd...

910
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,235
Gook-Iovers.
They ought to die.

911
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,196
Hey! Hey!

912
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,635
There he goes, man.
It's Leon.

913
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,869
Hey!

914
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,359
Hey!

915
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,873
Hey!

916
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,718
They're coming
through the wire!

917
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,789
Hey!

918
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,711
Chieu hoy!
Chieu hoy, Leon.

919
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,028
They're going
to overrun us!

920
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,950
Shut up!

921
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,268
They're going
to overrun us!

922
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,349
Hey, John!

923
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,868
Hey, hey, hey,
chieu hoy, Leon.

924
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,512
Chieu hoy, man!

925
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,431
Shut the fuck up, Leon!

926
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,909
Hit him with
some morphine.

927
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,276
Chicago has an Alice in Wonderland
quality about it.

928
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,271
Things are getting
curiouser and curiouser.

929
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,312
Everywhere you go, there's a sign
reminding you...

930
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,113
Love it or leave it,
you fucking bastards!

931
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,792
Hey, you ready, Kovic?

932
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,398
They're burning the flag.

933
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,948
They're fucking burning
the American flag.

934
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,795
Come on.
Let's look alive.

935
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,239
Looking good.
Looking good.

936
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,157
Come on, Kovic.
Real nice.

937
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,555
How many
did I do yesterday?

938
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,516
Three.

939
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,476
Three?

940
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,919
You had enough?

941
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,359
Let's do seven.

942
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,198
There you go.
Let's go for seven, then.

943
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,595
Come on, Ronnie.
That a way.

944
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,995
Get up there.
Get up there.

945
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,395
Keep going.
Come on, fucking Marine.

946
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,192
There you go.
Real nice.

947
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,710
This'll be the day
that I die

948
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,637
We want
to make one thing

949
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,989
very clear to you, Ron.

950
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,032
The possibility of your
ever walking is minimal.

951
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,549
Almost impossible.

952
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,388
You're a T-6, paralysed
from the midchest down.

953
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,715
Probably you'll be
in a wheelchair

954
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,553
for the rest
of your life.

955
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,909
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

956
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,195
Well, doctor, will...

957
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,269
Hmm?

958
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,756
Will I ever be able
to, uh...

959
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,671
to have children?

960
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,829
No.

961
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,958
No, but we have a very good
psychologist here.

962
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,029
He's helped...

963
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,918
Oh, I'll walk again.
I know I'll walk again.

964
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,831
Let me
tell you something.

965
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,911
You will never
walk again.

966
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,950
Let's go.

967
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,917
Uhh!

968
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,319
Uhh!

969
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,709
You're walking good
in these things.

970
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,155
What am I
looking like, good?

971
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,559
You're one crazy Marine.

972
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,993
So gung ho,

973
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,399
but you don't know shit

974
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,835
about what's going on
in this country.

975
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,433
Fuck you, Willie.

976
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,273
It ain't about burning the flag
and Vietnam.

977
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,191
Why fight
for rights there?

978
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,555
We ain't got rights
at home.

979
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,477
It's about Detroit
and Newark.

980
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,919
It's about racism, man,

981
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,793
but you can't get
no job at home.

982
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,196
Vietnam's a white man's war,
a rich man's war.

983
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,639
Where's my money?

984
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,557
You got
to read some books.

985
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,477
There's a revolution
going on.

986
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,875
If you ain't part
of the solution,

987
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,070
then you's part
of the problem.

988
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,829
Jesus Christ, Willie.
Just get my chair for me.

989
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,718
You got to watch
for her.

990
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,949
Oh, man.

991
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,399
Some good weed.

992
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,839
Take the bra off.

993
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,757
I'll give you
another 10.

994
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,358
Why, sure, sugar.

995
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,316
Like this?

996
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,670
Oh, shh! Shh!
Yeah. Yeah.

997
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,630
Suck on my tits.

998
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,079
Honey, anything
you want.

999
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,036
Shh!

1000
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,950
Oh!

1001
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,228
Jesus!

1002
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,876
I guess you'd say

1003
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,232
What could make me
feel this way

1004
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,639
My girl

1005
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,630
My girl

1006
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,596
My girl

1007
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,831
Talking 'bout my girl

1008
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,989
My girl

1009
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,239
Good.

1010
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,196
Easy now.

1011
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,793
Easy now.

1012
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,716
Very good.

1013
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,676
Hey, Doc...

1014
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,910
it's really beautiful
up here.

1015
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,150
Ha ha ha!

1016
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,469
I'm walking
out of here, guys.

1017
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,959
You'll see.
Right, Willie?

1018
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,353
Right.

1019
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,350
Easy.

1020
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,994
Oh... I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1021
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,957
O.K. That's enough
for today.

1022
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,993
O.K.
Now, good. Good.

1023
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,913
Easy, now. Easy, now.
Don't go too far.

1024
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,313
Don't do too much.

1025
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,470
Looking good today.
Looking good.

1026
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,039
Don't go too far.

1027
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,956
All right!

1028
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,951
Way to go, Kovic.

1029
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,910
Amazing, huh?

1030
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,837
Nothing from
the chest down.

1031
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,713
It can be done.
It can be done.

1032
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,313
Semper fi, motherfucker!

1033
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,355
All right!

1034
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,793
All right, Harry, man.

1035
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,677
Keep it going. Let's go!

1036
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,478
Let's go. Let's go.

1037
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,629
Let's go.

1038
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,874
Aah!

1039
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,836
Oh!

1040
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,830
Willie!

1041
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,711
I think I need...

1042
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,153
Oh! Oh.

1043
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,639
Get him up.
Somebody...

1044
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,591
Something snapped.
It's my neck.

1045
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,550
All right.

1046
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,039
Just my neck.

1047
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,758
Ah, shit! Harry!

1048
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,199
Hang on. Hang on.

1049
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,429
What was that sound?

1050
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,390
Oh, shit.

1051
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,759
What?

1052
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,829
Oh!

1053
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,797
It's fine.
We're doing fine.

1054
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,199
Is that my bone?

1055
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,191
Harry, Harry,
get a doc.

1056
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,594
Am I O. K?

1057
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,114
It's O.K. Everybody, relax.
Harry! Let's go!

1058
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,269
Oh, fuck.

1059
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,112
- Shit.
- Fuck.

1060
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,318
Washington!

1061
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,791
Washington,
where the fuck were you?

1062
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,189
I've been pushing
this call button

1063
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,078
and staring at my own vomit
for two hours.

1064
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,469
What's the matter
with you fucking people?

1065
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,869
I'm laying
in my own shit.

1066
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,315
Why don't you
change the sheets?

1067
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,753
This goddamned fucking place.

1068
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,159
I need a bath.

1069
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,038
Don't be raising
your voice to me!

1070
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,519
You watch your mouth.

1071
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,397
Why don't you help me?

1072
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,311
What's the matter
with you?

1073
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,753
I don't feel right.

1074
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,149
I need to see
the doctor now!

1075
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,639
He's not available now.

1076
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,517
I want to see him now!

1077
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,953
He's always too busy.

1078
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,393
What's eating you now?

1079
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,311
You going off
the deep end?

1080
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,753
We'll amputate
that leg,

1081
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,671
you go on
like this.

1082
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,069
Don't put
your hands on me.

1083
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,515
I want to be treated
like a human being.

1084
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,397
I don't want
any of that shit!

1085
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,833
Trying to
keep me fucking drugged

1086
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,753
so I don't know
what's going on.

1087
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,159
This is a fucking slum.

1088
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,559
We take that leg,

1089
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,477
you're out
in two weeks.

1090
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,913
I want my leg.

1091
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,831
Why?
You can't feel it.

1092
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,718
It's my leg.
I want my leg.

1093
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,159
Can't you
understand that?

1094
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,033
I want to be treated
like a human being.

1095
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,957
I fought
for my country.

1096
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,393
I'm a Vietnam veteran!

1097
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,317
I fought
for my country!

1098
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,759
Shut the fuck up!

1099
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,638
I should
be treated decent!

1100
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,478
Vietnam don't mean
nothing to me, man,

1101
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,592
or any of these other people.
You got it?

1102
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,796
You can take
your Vietnam

1103
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,673
and shove it up your ass,
you hear?

1104
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,149
No! I don't
need this!

1105
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,559
Hey, you fuck!

1106
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,393
Hey, goddamn you!

1107
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,913
Goddamn it.

1108
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,797
I am a fucking
Vietnam veteran!

1109
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,790
This isn't...

1110
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,790
Marvin!

1111
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,710
Marvin, now!

1112
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,710
Marvin!

1113
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,119
What's up?
What's up?

1114
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,076
Marvin, look!

1115
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,149
Oh, fuck!

1116
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,155
It's off.

1117
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,599
It ain't
going to work.

1118
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,516
Start!

1119
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,913
Washington,
get the doctor.

1120
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,319
Wait a minute.

1121
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,868
OK. Yeah.
All right. I will.

1122
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,279
How you doing, Eddie?

1123
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,157
Let's see what's
wrong with this.

1124
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,272
They tell me if we don't
get this pump working,

1125
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,397
they'll cut my leg off.
I want my leg.

1126
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,839
Do we have another pump?

1127
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,950
It's the only one, Eddie.

1128
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,359
Ron. It's Ron Kovic.

1129
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,152
Sorry, man. Ron.

1130
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,435
You... You are a doctor?

1131
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,511
It's the Vietnam war.
Cutbacks.

1132
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,716
The government's not giving us
the money we need

1133
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,716
to take care
of you guys.

1134
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,633
We're doing our best.
It's really too bad.

1135
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,033
It's not fair.

1136
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,634
I've tried hard
to keep this leg.

1137
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,558
I've been strapped in
this bed for four months

1138
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,909
so I could
keep this leg.

1139
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,315
Maybe I can rig up
a substitute.

1140
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,148
I'll look in the basement
and see what we got.

1141
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,599
You're coming back?

1142
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,914
Soon.

1143
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,996
Let go, Ron.
Let go.

1144
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,957
We really did try
to help Mr Kovic.

1145
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,630
Aah!

1146
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,513
Susanne, he's here.

1147
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,715
Ronnie's home.

1148
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,399
O.K. Out on 3.

1149
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,879
All right, 1...

1150
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,836
2...

1151
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,716
3.

1152
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,159
Oh, that's great.

1153
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,555
Did you
paint the house, Dad?

1154
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,999
Yeah. I painted it.

1155
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,433
Yellow. It looks good.

1156
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,833
It looks pretty good.

1157
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,599
I got that.
That's all right. Let's go.

1158
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,989
The kids have been
talking about you.

1159
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,395
They can't wait
to see you.

1160
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,352
It's great to be back
in the neighbourhood.

1161
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,749
I got it. I got it.

1162
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,195
Everything looks
so different.

1163
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,519
Major.

1164
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,476
Hey, Major.

1165
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,869
Major, you know
who this is?

1166
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,836
Yeah.

1167
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,751
You know who this is?

1168
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,193
He's gotten old, huh?

1169
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,111
Just like your old man.

1170
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,474
Hey, Tommy.

1171
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,919
Good to see you.

1172
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,075
Look at that hair.

1173
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,475
Dad lets you
look like that?

1174
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,078
I don't have
much say.

1175
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,559
How are you, Jimmy?

1176
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,393
Good to have you home.
You're out for good?

1177
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,879
I'm out for good.

1178
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,155
Patty, gee,
look at you.

1179
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,116
Timmy.

1180
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,030
That's Jackie.

1181
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:49,996
Jackie?

1182
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,674
I wanted to visit you
in the hospital.

1183
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,518
How many pull-ups
you do, huh?

1184
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,358
You know, I did 23...
23 pull-ups.

1185
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,795
23 pull...
I'm O.K. I'm O.K.

1186
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,558
I'm all right.

1187
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,555
Ronnie.

1188
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,510
Susanne.

1189
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,391
Good to have you home.

1190
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,159
You didn't tell me
she was this beautiful.

1191
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,599
She's a woman, huh?

1192
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,550
I'm sorry.

1193
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,433
That's O.K. I can't
feel anything anyway.

1194
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,799
I'm only paralysed.

1195
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,950
You look great.

1196
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,995
Yeah?

1197
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,753
Ronnie.

1198
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,835
Mom.

1199
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,596
Ronnie.

1200
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,079
Hey, Mom.

1201
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,792
Oh, look at your hair.

1202
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,279
It looks great.

1203
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,673
You like it?

1204
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,512
Oh, you look beautiful.

1205
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,629
Thanks.

1206
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,871
It's good to be home.

1207
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,837
It's better
than seeing me

1208
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,233
at that hospital, huh?

1209
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,673
It's O.K.

1210
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,193
I know.

1211
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,434
I'm O.K.

1212
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,708
I'm O.K.

1213
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,911
It's good to
have you home, Ronnie.

1214
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,713
Gee, everybody
looks so good.

1215
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,916
Everybody looks so good.

1216
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,476
I'm going to go inside
for a minute.

1217
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,913
Mom, wait.

1218
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,319
She'll be O.K.

1219
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,198
Ronnie, how are you, man?
You look good.

1220
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,633
Ronnie,
you look good.

1221
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,596
Welcome home.

1222
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,989
It's so good
to see you.

1223
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,957
Welcome home.
Nice to see you.

1224
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,315
Look at Harry.
You look good.

1225
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,310
Welcome home.

1226
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,277
Let's go in
the house and help.

1227
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,069
Come on, Mom.
It's all right.

1228
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,036
Looks good.

1229
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,314
Yeah?

1230
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,879
You need some help?

1231
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,273
No. I'm O.K., Dad.

1232
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,158
Fixed up a bathroom
for you, Ronnie.

1233
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,549
Put a wider doorway in.

1234
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,438
I built a shower
for you, too.

1235
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,318
You can get in here
pretty easy.

1236
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,709
Oh, and I
put some handles

1237
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,791
on the toilet
for you.

1238
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,590
Ronnie.

1239
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,675
Thanks, Dad.

1240
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,828
It's really great
to be back in my room.

1241
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,036
It's good to have you.

1242
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,788
It's good to have you,
Ronnie.

1243
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,237
Come on, I'll show you...

1244
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,433
I'll show you
some new stuff we got

1245
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,476
in the bedroom
over here.

1246
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,110
My Happauge Boyer's grossed
85 grand last six months.

1247
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,998
My competitor's rushing in to build,
but I was first.

1248
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,479
The people are loyal.

1249
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,835
You probably think
it's just a hamburger.

1250
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,718
A patty's
just a piece of meat,

1251
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,153
but it can
have character.

1252
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,593
See that doughnut hole?

1253
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,797
Gets 18 patties to the pound
instead of 16.

1254
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,189
Saves me
about $40,000 a year.

1255
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,395
That's serious
money, Ron.

1256
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,833
I plug the hole

1257
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,797
with lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, spices.

1258
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,070
I cover it
with a pickle.

1259
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,991
They'll never
miss a thing.

1260
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,878
Give me a good one
for Ronnie. Thanks.

1261
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,313
Good job. Try this.

1262
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,233
You don't find that
at McDonald's on Sunrise.

1263
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,470
I got a drive-in
window, too.

1264
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,913
It's Long Island's first.

1265
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,831
It's clean,
it's cheap, it's fast.

1266
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,751
Feed the family
for $3.95.

1267
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,193
Check out these chicks.

1268
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,918
They're wearing
those new miniskirts.

1269
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,309
It's my idea.
It's good for tips.

1270
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,759
The customers
always come back.

1271
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,199
Massapequa's changed.
Watch yourself.

1272
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,073
It's no mom-and-pop
operation any more.

1273
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,519
This is our town.

1274
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,360
You're doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work.

1275
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,469
Good.

1276
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,919
Copiague, Ronnie,
Jericho, Bayville,

1277
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,359
Valley Stream, man.

1278
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,793
I want to turn Boyer's

1279
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,189
into a whole
Long Island thing.

1280
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,913
I want you to come
to work for me.

1281
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,353
What can I do?

1282
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,277
This is our town now.

1283
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,153
You're a war hero,
and you can benefit.

1284
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,599
You should benefit,
Ronnie.

1285
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,033
You mean, like partners?

1286
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,957
We open a place
together?

1287
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,355
You got to walk
before you run.

1288
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,233
I could start you out
as a cashier.

1289
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,635
Then you could
learn the business,

1290
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,950
work your way up
to be manager,

1291
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,792
just like your dad.

1292
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,354
I get 1,700 a month
from the government.

1293
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,793
I'll take my time.

1294
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,990
That's charity money.
This isn't.

1295
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:28,916
Charity?

1296
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,955
Here's your cola.

1297
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,713
You got to put
the war behind you.

1298
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,597
Forget about
this chair you're in.

1299
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,039
Sometimes,
you know, Stevie,

1300
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,479
I think people know

1301
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,919
you're back
from Vietnam,

1302
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,315
and their face changes,
the eyes...

1303
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,193
the voice, the way
they look at you.

1304
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,111
I know, but people here,

1305
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,515
they don't give a shit
about the war.

1306
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,358
It's just a million miles away.
It's all bullshit.

1307
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,198
The government sold us
a bill of goods.

1308
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,953
We got the shit
kicked out of us.

1309
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,436
What do you mean "we"?
You were in college.

1310
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,278
It was you who bought
that communist bullshit.

1311
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,158
Yeah. They were going
to take over the world.

1312
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,593
Do you remember that?

1313
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,033
Finnelli, you, Walsh.

1314
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,951
The whole town
was devastated.

1315
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,678
For what?

1316
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,829
For lies?

1317
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,911
For bullshit lies?

1318
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,799
They burn the flag.

1319
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,193
They demonstrate
against us

1320
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,589
on the cover
of the paper today.

1321
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,033
They have no respect.

1322
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,473
They have no idea

1323
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,357
what's going on
over there

1324
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,590
and the men that are
sacrificing their lives.

1325
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,033
Nobody here
seems to care.

1326
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,793
It's a bunch
of goddamned shit.

1327
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,509
Don't take the Lord's name in vain
in front of the children.

1328
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,710
I agree with
everything you say.

1329
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,153
I served my country.

1330
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,549
They just want
to take from it.

1331
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,471
Love it or leave it.

1332
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,879
The other side's angry

1333
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,313
because
we're not winning.

1334
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,799
How can we win?

1335
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,233
Tommy,
what's the matter?

1336
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,150
Nothing.

1337
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,593
Anybody listening here?
Tommy?

1338
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,556
What?

1339
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,437
Tommy's going
to fail English.

1340
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,869
He doesn't believe
in the war.

1341
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,831
What?

1342
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,599
He thinks we're doing
the wrong thing

1343
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,550
over there.

1344
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,433
He thinks
it's all a mistake.

1345
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,313
Mistake? What's this?
Spit it out.

1346
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,759
You believe
in demonstrators?

1347
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,869
Huh? What?

1348
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,753
I just don't agree
with everything you're saying.

1349
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,677
I don't think
you understand.

1350
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,597
What does
Tommy know?

1351
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,232
I don't understand?

1352
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,151
He's hanging around
with longhairs

1353
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,832
who take drugs!

1354
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,279
That's not the reason.

1355
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,435
Have they ever worked?

1356
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,670
You want to burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?

1357
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,875
What is this?

1358
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,349
You want to
bring down this country?

1359
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,715
Love it
or leave it, Tommy.

1360
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,591
All they're
trying to say, Ronnie,

1361
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,035
is they don't
want more people

1362
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,832
to come back like you.

1363
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,199
That's an easy excuse.

1364
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,397
Where were they when
their country needed them?

1365
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,833
You served your country.

1366
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,718
What did you
get out of it?

1367
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,518
Look at you.

1368
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,393
Well, look at me.

1369
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,192
Look at you, man.

1370
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,232
I got to go. I'll see
you around, all right?

1371
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,157
What's wrong
with me, Tommy?

1372
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,912
What's wrong
with me?

1373
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,956
Is there something
wrong with me?

1374
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,353
I volunteered,
Tommy!

1375
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,159
You don't know
what you're talking about!

1376
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,599
Were you there?

1377
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,950
You can just love it
or leave it, Tommy!

1378
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,393
Mom, I can't believe

1379
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,635
what Tommy just
said to me.

1380
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,715
I can't...

1381
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,275
I can't believe
what Tommy just said to me.

1382
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,228
Parade time, Ronnie.

1383
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,756
You tell them I'll be
right there, all right?

1384
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,112
What kind of car is it?

1385
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,718
I think it's
a Continental.

1386
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,829
Continental?

1387
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,915
A convertible?

1388
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,876
Yeah.

1389
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,632
They said
it would be.

1390
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,312
Coming up
in the world.

1391
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,675
Would you like to ride

1392
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,156
In my beautiful balloon

1393
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,356
Would you like to ride

1394
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,477
In my beautiful balloon

1395
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,717
We could float among
the stars together

1396
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,796
You and I

1397
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,997
For we can fly

1398
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,350
We can fly

1399
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,635
Up, up and away

1400
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,472
In my beautiful

1401
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,714
My beautiful

1402
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:31,670
Balloon

1403
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,839
Die!

1404
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,153
Today is July the 4th,
and I believe in America.

1405
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,631
And I believe
in Americanism.

1406
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,233
But most of all,

1407
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,754
I believe in victory
for America.

1408
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,552
Some people are starting
to say the war is wrong,

1409
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,312
that we shouldn't be there.

1410
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,233
Some people would like to
tear our country down.

1411
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,799
But who are the kids

1412
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,711
defending their right
to protest?

1413
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,950
These are the kids
who care about America,

1414
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,679
kids who have respect
for their flag

1415
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,910
and their parents
and their government

1416
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,309
and their religion.

1417
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,709
Kids like Joey Walsh.
