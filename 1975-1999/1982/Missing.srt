1
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,610
Captain Tower?

2
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:58,779
Sorry. You may go. Vamos.

3
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:04,159
Dejénlo pasar. Dejénlo pasar!

4
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:27,221
- Where do you live, Tery?
- Why?

5
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,390
So l can take you home.
It's only 30 minutes until curfew.

6
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,892
Just drop us at the Hotel Carrera.

7
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:42,818
Thanks for the ride.

8
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:49,365
Listen, if you need anything, call me.

9
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:52,701
Here's my business card.
My home number's on the back.

10
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:54,202
OK.

11
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,666
- Thanks again.
- OK.

12
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:02,251
lt's nearly curfew. They shoot everyone.

13
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:07,381
The phones don't work here.
Let's get a cab.

14
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,841
Why didn't you let him drive us home?

15
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:12,719
l didn't want him to know where l lived!

16
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:18,307
- We'll take a taxi.
- No, ya no, es muy tarde.

17
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,354
Vicuña Mackenna. ;Sí, por favor!

18
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:31,193
- Blew it.
- You did not.

19
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:34,487
Look, l have a credit card.
We can stay here.

20
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:43,954
lt's curfew. Come on, we better go in.

21
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:55,798
# ..your ding-a-ling
# My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling,

22
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,342
# l want you to play with my ding-a-ling

23
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:03,179
# Oh, your ding-a-ling
your ding-a-ling

24
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,183
# We saw you playing with your...
# Ding-a-ling

25
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:09,476
# Oh, my ding-a-ling

26
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:14,314
# Everybody sing
l want to play with my ding

27
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,984
# Everybody, my, oh, my... #

28
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:37,250
# All or nothing at all... #

29
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,587
You all right?

30
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,715
Never better.

31
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,467
Be positive, OK?

32
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:51,721
l just keep thinking about
what Patrick said about...

33
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:56,142
bodies everywhere.

34
00:04:57,518 --> 00:05:01,021
Beth's all right. Nothing can happen to her.

35
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:03,607
l hope so.

36
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:07,318
She's probably hiding
in the bath with the duck.

37
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:11,155
Laugh. It's the best thing l've said all day.

38
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:15,117
l just wish it was morning.

39
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,998
Er, does the light bother you?

40
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:24,583
No. No, not at all.

41
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:36,886
Charlie, you think it's smart
to keep all those notes?

42
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:05,369
Es aquí.

43
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:16,628
- Beth?
- She's probably asleep, Charlie.

44
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,298
- Shh, shh, shh.

45
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:49,741
Beth, it's me.

46
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:53,452
Oh, shit. You're alive.

47
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:55,370
Yep.

48
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,666
- Where have you been?
- In Viña.

49
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,672
- You were supposed to be there one day.
- We couldn't get back.

50
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:10,008
Why didn't you call me?
l've been going nuts.

51
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,804
- There was nothing l could do.
- l thought something terrible had happened.

52
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:19,475
We got trapped. They cut the roads down
and shut off the telephone wires.

53
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,519
- Come here.
- l love you.

54
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,646
Come here. l missed you.

55
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:32,361
l didn't know if you were alive.
Everybody's safe.

56
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,988
- Where's Tery?
- There.

57
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,117
- You shit!
- Who?

58
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,536
- You. l was worried about you.
- You were worried?

59
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,663
Cut it out. Wait. Hold it.

60
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:50,001
You creep! Living out at the beach,
and l'm stuck here with the duck.

61
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:53,171
This is from Charlie.

62
00:07:56,214 --> 00:08:00,677
l heard it on the radio but there were
bombs going off down the street.

63
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:02,596
Really?

64
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:06,057
- Were you scared?

65
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,935
- Yeah, l hid under the bed.

66
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:18,943
Want some help?

67
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:23,280
Get-a your tootsie-fruitsie.
Para ti, para mí.

68
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:26,867
Why a duck? Why no goose?

69
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:29,619
Why a duck? Why no goose?

70
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:34,832
Hey, hope you guys aren't verry hungy.

71
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,459
- We're starved.
- Hm!

72
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,422
Seriously, is there anything to eat
besides a couple cockroaches?

73
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:45,758
No. l'm sorry.
l was scared to go out shopping.

74
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,844
Hey, Beth, l got this of Charlie at Viña.

75
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:52,305
Hey, Beth. How about a little
Long Island ducky?

76
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:56,517
Stuffed with a little Peruvian tuna fish,
Spanish olives?

77
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:04,358
lt's OK. l was kidding.
Hey - l was just kidding. OK...

78
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:06,359
- Old jokes.
- l know.

79
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:10,238
- l've listened to them for five days.
- Ty five years.

80
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:14,867
- Señora Núñez...
- Here. l know you can't get these here.

81
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,412
You're looking for Beth Horman?
She's in the bedroom.

82
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:22,582
Go on. Pase, pase.
''Si, gracias, señor.''

83
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:27,669
Oh, careful, señora.
''Gracias, señor. Señora...?''

84
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,509
Old jokes.

85
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:41,640
l want to go home, Charlie. Now.

86
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,434
- Come on, Beth.
- We have to.

87
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:46,561
l can't stand this place any more.

88
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,604
- OK, we'll go.
- l hate this house.

89
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,940
OK, we're going, we're going.

90
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:54,276
Let's go with Tery, today.

91
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:58,363
We can't just leave without my stuff.
We gotta settle things up...

92
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,490
- Just leave it.
- We can't.

93
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,158
We're going. l promise you.

94
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:05,285
You don't know what it's like
being here without you.

95
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,412
Have you heard from David or Frank?

96
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:08,914
No.

97
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:13,042
- l hope they're OK.
- Me too.

98
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,294
- l better go check on 'em.
- Let me go.

99
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,464
You take Tery to the airport.
l gotta get outta here.

100
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,091
- OK.
- You guys want me to take a walk?

101
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:25,219
- Later.
- Not too much later.

102
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:32,392
Patrick said there were
search-and-destroy missions.

103
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,728
- Patrick?
- A colonel in Viña.

104
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,897
We saw some verry upsetting things in Viña.

105
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,319
- You gonna let me read it, or tell it to me?
- Whichever you prefer.

106
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,955
End of the line.

107
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,126
- What time you coming home?
- Four o'clock.

108
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,546
l'll be waiting for you. You better watch out.

109
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,923
- l won't be late.
- You better not be.

110
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,050
l'm warning you.

111
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:11,968
- ;Vía Magna, Plaza Italia!
- That's me.

112
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,220
- You sure you wanna go?
- Yeah.

113
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:17,181
- Love you.
- Un momentito, por favor.

114
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,392
l'll see you in New York.

115
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:23,770
Oh, call our parents and tell them
we'll be back in a couple of days.

116
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:26,356
Say goodbye to David and Frank for me.

117
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:12,938
A partir de hoy, las mujeres
en este país no usan más pantalones.

118
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,107
What did he say?

119
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:19,319
He said, ''From now on,
women in this county wear dresses.''

120
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,501
My God, look at this.

121
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:40,629
A week ago,
this was the quietest place on Earth.

122
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:43,673
- Come on.
- It was a lot cooler than that.

123
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:48,761
l think Braniffs over there. Wait a second.

124
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,564
- No quedan más, se acabó.
- Shit.

125
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:23,333
Al primero que se mueva, métele un balazo.
Se queda en el suelo hasta que yo diga.

126
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:45,060
l'm with her. Vengo con la señorita.

127
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,195
Adónde vas con eso?

128
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,241
He wants to know where you're going.

129
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:06,162
l-l'm an American. l was going to New York.
l was going to get my ticket.

130
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:09,122
Es norteamericana y va a New York.

131
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:13,251
The airport is closed,
and there is no more planes.

132
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,796
You may go.

133
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:38,023
Don't look.

134
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,150
Don't look.

135
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,113
Excuse me.
Could we speak to Mrs Tyler, please?

136
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:48,365
There's nobody here by that name.

137
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:52,660
Could we speak to whoever's helping
Americans leave the county?

138
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:56,247
That's not our job.
Talk to somebody at the consulate.

139
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:59,833
We were told that the consulate
was closed because of gunfire

140
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,460
and that the consul was working here.

141
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,587
Yeah? Well, that's news to me.

142
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,882
Could you call for us and maybe find out?

143
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,636
Lady, if you wanna see
if the consulate is open, then go there.

144
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:16,348
lt's lunch time. Everybody's gone,
and the phones are dead.

145
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,474
Well, thank you verry much.

146
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:29,109
Excuse me. l'm Kate Newman,
a freelance reporter out of New York.

147
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,070
No comment.
Just a friendly misunderstanding.

148
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,198
lf you don't mind, if l were you,
l'd come back after lunch.

149
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,077
Demand to see the ambassador.
Don't go to the consulate -

150
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:43,079
it's a mile away and the streets are murder.

151
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:45,957
- Thanks. Wait. Miss Newman?
- Yes?

152
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:48,792
- Would you do me a big favour?
- Sure.

153
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,920
- Can l borrow your paper?
- Certainly.

154
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,133
l don't understand. There's nothing here.

155
00:15:57,175 --> 00:16:02,262
They told us in Viña that the militay were
executing thousands of people here.

156
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,557
- There's nothing.
- When were you in Viña?

157
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,978
We just got back yesterday.
Wanna hear something strange?

158
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:13,439
Our hotel was full of
American militay officers.

159
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,858
l'd forget about that.

160
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,653
- ;Suélteme, estúpido!

161
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:27,993
- ;Déjenme ir con él!
- Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

162
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:30,996
- Do not meddle!
- Jesus!

163
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,291
Déjalos, son americanos.

164
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:40,379
- Are you OK?
- l'm all right.

165
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:42,756
- Why did you do that?
- l don't know.

166
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:44,716
l just...

167
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:48,803
- l don't know.
- Listen, both of you.

168
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:51,222
Forget this and forget Viña.

169
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:53,390
Find yourselves a safe place.

170
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,226
A hotel with lots of people around.

171
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:59,687
Just hole up there
until you can get out of here.

172
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,814
Hey. Hey!

173
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:06,110
All right? You'll stay here? Gracias.

174
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:10,071
You'll get a room for Beth and me too?
We'll be back as soon as we can.

175
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,198
- All right?
- Yeah. Got enough money?

176
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,201
- l think so. How about you?
- l got my credit card.

177
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,453
Here. Take it. You never know.

178
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,164
Thanks, pal. Charlie...

179
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,333
- Be careful.
- Don't worry. They can't hurt us.

180
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:25,418
We're Americans.

181
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:30,047
l think l felt him kick.

182
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:39,847
Come on, Maria. You gotta have faith.
Carlos will be OK.

183
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:43,767
Tienes que ser fuerte. Piensa en el niño.

184
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,812
- She's right.
- Sé que lo van a matar.

185
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:51,190
No, Maria! He's probably
up in the mountains hiding.

186
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:55,319
l know they are going to kill him.
They're killing everybody.

187
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:59,239
- You should go.
- l got a few more minutes.

188
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:02,492
No, you must go. l will take care of her.

189
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:08,122
You'll be OK?

190
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,001
Let me know if you get any news.

191
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,548
Take care.

192
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,061
- OK, Frank?
- Yeah.

193
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,482
- How's she doing?
- She's OK. Pia's with her.

194
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:43,319
Frank, what did happen to Carlos?

195
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:45,613
What's happening to everrybody?

196
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:50,158
Maybe he's at an embassy
as a refugee or something.

197
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:53,995
- Or somebody blew his brains out.
- David.

198
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,458
- What about Silvio?
- He's OK. He's in hiding but, er...

199
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,461
- But Cleo really disappeared.
- Oh, shit.

200
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:07,257
This place is a free-fire zone.
They shoot you just for being left-handed.

201
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:10,468
l hope you aren't planning
to stay around too long.

202
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:14,680
- Party's over.
- They were tying to do something new.

203
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,974
l'm sorry, l've gotta go.
Charlie's gonna kill me.

204
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:20,643
Promise to call when you get to New York?

205
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:24,230
Use the phone booth at the corner
of West Broadway.

206
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,529
Frank, l'm sorry things worked out for you
the way they did.

207
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,573
Soon we'll be playing chess
in Washington Square.

208
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:38,367
- Checkers.
- Checkers. l hope so.

209
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,204
- Where you gonna be?
- His folks' house, Upper East Side.

210
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:45,498
- Chic!
- That's us. Take care.

211
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,625
lt's my... Oh, my bus!

212
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,315
Taxi!

213
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,485

Qué quieres?

Soy americana. El toque de queda,
por favor, necesito ayuda.

225
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:24,584
Get out. No foreigners here.

226
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:27,128
- Help me.
- Get out.

227
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:30,506
Get out!

Yoo-hoo, Charlie!

Char...

232
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:18,527
Charlie?

233
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:33,540
Charlie?

234
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,424
Charlie...

235
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,721
Excuse me, señora.

236
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:56,685
My husband? Did you see my husband?

237
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:08,571
Gracias.

238
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:25,419
You've been in touch
with our embassy there?

239
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,922
Several times, sir.
l spoke to a Mr Shipler.

240
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,256
And?

241
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:33,509
Senator, all they seem to know
is that my son is missing.

242
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:37,763
Hm. Have you been
to the State Department?

243
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:42,142
l have tried, sir, many different people.
You are the first that would see me.

244
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:45,102
Well, l urge you to get to them, Mr Horman.

245
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,564
l'm tying, sir.

246
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,651
How does your son make a living?

247
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:54,944
Well, frankly, l...

248
00:25:56,195 --> 00:26:00,116
l guess he's a writer.
Well, he says that he wants to...

249
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,744
The important thing right now is to help him.

250
00:26:04,578 --> 00:26:06,413
Yes, sir.

251
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:08,539
Here in the State Department, sir,

252
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,044
we've investigated and have been unable
to find any trace of your son.

253
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:18,465
Neither our embassy nor the militay
government knows where he is.

254
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:21,092
The New York Times says he was arrested.

255
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:24,345
That's what your daughter-in-law
told the press.

256
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:26,263
She...

257
00:26:26,304 --> 00:26:30,600
She's been pestering
those embassy people, so they told me.

258
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:40,067
Tery Simon is a friend. She was there
on vacation, caught in the coup.

259
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:42,235
She confirmed everrything Beth told me.

260
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:46,698
The arrested Americans have all been
released thanks to our embassy's efforts.

261
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,867
The last two, Teruggi and Holloway...

262
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,869
They're friends of your son's.

263
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,872
..were released, and Teruggi left
without even thanking the embassy.

264
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:59,375
Mr Horman, this is gonna take a little time.

265
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:04,838
l suggest you go back up to New York
and relax and let us handle it.

266
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:09,968
l met him in New York
at the Third Church of Christ Scientist.

267
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,180
- Doubt he'd remember.
- You're a Christian Scientist too?

268
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:15,681
And your son?

269
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:19,518
- You know how young people are.
- Of course.

270
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,187
Mr Horman, would you mind
waiting here a moment?

271
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:24,314
No, not at all.

272
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,828
- Mr Horman?
- Yes.

273
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,455
- l think we've met before.
- Yes, Congressman.

274
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,707
New York? This is my assistant, Ann.

275
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,834
- How do you do?
- You know Bob.

276
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,211
Do you mind if we talk while walking?

277
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,338
No. Not at all, sir.

278
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,967
- What did they say?
- They think he's in hiding.

279
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,761
- Why?
- Political reasons.

280
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,388
They think he'll surface
when things calm down.

281
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,726
- What are his politics?
- Liberal, l suppose.

282
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:09,228
Liberal, or radical?

283
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:13,607
Congressman, my son
is much too wishy-washy to be a radical.

284
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,943
- Are you sure?
- What difference does it make?

285
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:22,072
Well, it doesn't but you said
that Percy and Abzug are sending cables?

286
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:24,991
They promised to,
but so did Kemp and Koch

287
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:28,286
and Magnuson and Javits and you.

288
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:30,830
Well, l'm certainly gonna consider it.

289
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:32,957
Good luck. God bless.

290
00:28:33,748 --> 00:28:35,834
Nice meeting you, Mr Horman.

291
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:38,336
Mr Horman.

292
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,786
What's that? That.

293
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,956
This?

294
00:29:19,998 --> 00:29:21,916
Those are my books.

295
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:25,544
One of those is a Bible.
l'm a Christian Scientist.

296
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,671
Pasaporte.

297
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:36,429
Mr Horman? l'm Phil Putnam.
l'm the US Consul down here.

298
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,098
- Thank heaven.
- Sorry about the confusion.

299
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,725
That's all right. Is there any more news?

300
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:46,020
Nothing so far, but l think
we're on top of the situation.

301
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:48,731
Washington cabled us you were coming.

302
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:53,485
;Déjenme, yo tengo
mi salvoconducto, déjenme!

303
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:55,612
We're over here in the Ford.

304
00:29:56,821 --> 00:30:00,074
- You'd think there was a war on.
- There is, sort of.

305
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:05,204
- l thought the coup was over.
- It is, but there are still problems.

306
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:08,581
The ambassador can see you at 3:30
if that's OK.

307
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:10,917
- The sooner the better.
- Good.

308
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:16,797
- Cheerful little county you picked to live in.

309
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,174
Yeah, well...

310
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,301
How long have you been here?

311
00:30:21,343 --> 00:30:24,554
Three years, four months and 19 days.

312
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:26,264
Counting the days.

313
00:30:26,305 --> 00:30:29,892
lt's not a bad county, really.
l'm just ready for a change.

314
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,852
Where will you go next?

315
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:34,396
My dream is to be posted to Brazil.

316
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:38,649
But l'll go wherever they send me.
Al hotel Cabrera.

317
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:46,781
Ed. Ed.

318
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:53,746
l'm sorry l didn't meet you.
l've been tying to meet this Major Pieto...

319
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:56,790
Mrs Horman? Hi. How are ya? You all right?

320
00:30:56,831 --> 00:30:58,625
All right.

321
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:02,920
Good, good. Listen, we'll be back
to pick you folks up at 2:30.

322
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,630
Yes, 2:30. That's fine.

323
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:07,466
l've been tying to meet this Major Pieto.

324
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:11,386
This morning was the only time
that l could meet him.

325
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,768
And the bathroom, sir.
Thank you verry much.

326
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:31,529
- How was your trip?
- A total delight.

327
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,661
How's Elizabeth?

328
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:45,416
How do you suppose?

329
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:52,672
You blame me?

330
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,814
Did you find out anything in Washington?

331
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:13,940
No, but...

332
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:18,319
Putnam thinks that things down here
are in good hands.

333
00:32:18,361 --> 00:32:21,739
- You don't agree?

334
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:25,159
Well, l don't expect
a whole hell of a lot any more.

335
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:28,078
No?

336
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:31,998
Why?

337
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:34,375
He's been gone two weeks.

338
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:38,545
l don't know. They give me the same
song and dance over and over again.

339
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,591
He could be hurt or...

340
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:47,553
tortured.
They don't give a goddamn about him.

341
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:51,848
l don't want to hear
any of your anti-Establishment paranoia!

342
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:56,227
l certainly get enough of that from my son.

343
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,984
lf he had settled down where he belongs,
this never would have happened.

344
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,781
Please don't cy.

345
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,458
Beth, l'll find him.

346
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:32,759
Charles wrote that these toilet articles
were hard to get.

347
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,886
Not any more.

348
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,056
His mother sent him fudge.

349
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:49,190
Why don't you go freshen up?

350
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:51,317
We only have one hour.

351
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:01,242
Oh, by the way, where's Tery?

352
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:03,369
At Braniff, picking up her ticket.

353
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:05,621
- When does she go?
- Tomorrow.

354
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:07,998
ls she all right?

355
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,333
Yeah, Ed. So am l.

356
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:54,288
- Come in.

357
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,384
Ta-daa.

358
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:13,054
Beth, l have to ask you a question.

359
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:16,891
l want you to answer me
absolutely honestly.

360
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,143
- OK.
- What did he do?

361
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:22,146
- What?
- What stupid thing did Charles do

362
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,190
to cause his arrest,
or make him go into hiding?

363
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:29,027
- Ed, Charlie is not a stupid man.
- He wasn't too smart!

364
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:34,323
l can tell you, getting in such a mess
that l have to fly 16 hours in order to...

365
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:40,537
Sometimes l honestly think that that boy
is incapable of doing anything,

366
00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:46,083
except give idealistic speeches
and write novels that'll never be published.

367
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:49,086
Unless the disappearing act is a stunt

368
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:53,340
- to publicise his autobiography.
- Why don't you just go home?

369
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,508
l'll find my husband by myself.

370
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,969
- l'll be ready in a few minutes.
- Take your time.

371
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,764
l still want an answer to that question.

372
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:19,863
- Mr Ambassador, Mr Horman.
- Come right in, sir.

373
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:21,781
- My pleasure.
- Mine too.

374
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:25,618
Captain Tower, US Navy,
our senior militay group officer.

375
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:28,161
Colonel Clay, our defence attaché.

376
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:30,872
- Mr Horman.
- Thank you.

377
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:34,125
Mrs Horman, how are you today?

378
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,835
Fine.

379
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:39,380
- Shall l review?
- Yes. But first...

380
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:44,009
l want to express our deep concern
over your son's disappearance.

381
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,969
- Thank you.
- l assure you

382
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:49,930
everry element at our disposal
has been and will continue to be utilised

383
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:51,974
to facilitate his safe return.

384
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:56,019
That's exactly what l'd hoped to hear,
Mr Ambassador.

385
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:57,979
Go ahead, Consul Putnam.

386
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,065
Sir, we've conducted
an extensive investigation.

387
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:04,193
Captain Tower's staff
have interviewed residents

388
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,903
in the area where Charles was last seen.

389
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:12,617
Colonel Clay has maintained his contacts
with militay and police authorities.

390
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:16,954
But after analysing all the data,
we still come to the conclusion

391
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:20,374
- that he must be in hiding.
- From what?

392
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:23,960
That's a valid question,
and one we'd like the answer to.

393
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:26,837
We've been through this a hundred times.

394
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:31,550
He's not hiding. Our whole neighbourhood
saw him picked up by a goon squad.

395
00:37:31,592 --> 00:37:34,135
The militay swears they haven't got him.

396
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:38,848
l've been to the carabinero stations,
to the department of investigations,

397
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,977
l even got into the national stadium,
and he's just not in their custody.

398
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:48,356
So the hiding theoy seems to be
the most viable, at least for the present.

399
00:37:48,397 --> 00:37:52,610
That's dumb. If he were in hiding,
he'd let me know he was all right.

400
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:57,155
Maybe he can't. There have been
a lot of civilian accidents and injuries.

401
00:37:57,197 --> 00:37:58,907
No shit, Sherlock.

402
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:05,204
Were you going to say something,
Mr Horman?

403
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:07,957
Er, yes. Er...

404
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:11,334
As the colonel suggested,
if Charles was possibly injured,

405
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,754
he could be in a coma,
or suffering from amnesia...

406
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,672
Have you checked the hospitals?

407
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:19,050
- Some.
- Not all?

408
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:22,886
lt's pretty difficult to get into some hospitals
right now, and...

409
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:27,098
Translated, he means you can break a leg
tripping over bodies.

410
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:31,811
The only thing that we know
for sure right now

411
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,146
is where he isn't.

412
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:37,315
l may have some further news for you
after tonight.

413
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:41,652
l'm having dinner with the junta's
chief of staff, Admiral Huidobro.

414
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:46,323
God. That one again?
Haven't you seen him yet?

415
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:48,617
These people are verry busy.

416
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,077
l bet they are.

417
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:54,038
By the way, Beth, do you have that list?

418
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,332
What list?

419
00:38:56,373 --> 00:39:00,878
l asked her for a list of Charles' friends
so l could extend this investigation.

420
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,172
l'll see that you get it.

421
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:09,552
You said several of Charles' friends
were contacted by the militay

422
00:39:09,593 --> 00:39:13,555
- after he was supposedly arrested.
- They all called the consulate.

423
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:15,974
- What calls?
- l wasn't aware of any.

424
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,309
You certainly were.

425
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:23,230
l saw all the notes on the calls the day
Shipler showed me your file cards.

426
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:27,192
l forgot that, sir. You're right.
Yes, l think l do remember.

427
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,488
Why don't you check that out sometime
in the next couple of days?

428
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,074
We'll meet again
to take stock of the situation.

429
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,119
lf you need anything...
Dave? Driver, please.

430
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:43,248
lf you need anything, let me or Captain
Tower know, and we'll arrange it.

431
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:46,542
- l'll see that he gets that list.
- Not from me, he won't.

432
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,296
l'll check the phone logs
and start working on the hospitals.

433
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,714
- Thank you, Consul.
- Call me Phil.

434
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:55,133
- Mrs Horman.
- Thank you again.

435
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:57,885
What is the matter?
Why were you so rude?

436
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:00,888
- Jesus Christ!
- And do you swear all the time?

437
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,098
l'm sorry. l don't mean to offend you.

438
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,225
Why aren't you cooperating with them?

439
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:07,352
- l am cooperating.
- Oh...

440
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:10,063
l've been cooperating for two weeks, Ed!

441
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:13,983
l'm sick and tired of getting fucked around
by these people, that's why!

442
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,943
- To the hotel, sir?
- Yes.

443
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:23,366
- Want some?
- Uh-uh.

444
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:26,660
Back.

445
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,708
Back.

446
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:38,129
One more step.

447
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:44,926
lt's an old joke.

448
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:48,263
- We better go. Last bus is at six.
- Right.

449
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:50,306
;Vámonos!

450
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,725
- Catch!
- Right. l'll race ya.

451
00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:55,102
- Oh, no. No, you won't!
- l'll beat ya!

452
00:40:56,268 --> 00:41:00,565
Hay huelga de camioneros
y están bloqueados todos los caminos.

453
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:03,568
- Sí, gracias. Fucking great.
- What?

454
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:07,029
The truckers are on strike,
roads are all blocked.

455
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,614
- How do we get back?
- We don't.

456
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,741
Beth is gonna go nuts.

457
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:14,994
lsn't there another way? Any trains?

458
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:16,912
Mañana, a las 9.

459
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:19,540
- What'd he say?
- He said, with luck,

460
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,334
there might be a train tomorrow at nine.

461
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:26,129
So what do we do till then?

462
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:32,968
- What is it?
- l don't know.

463
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,409
'That's the morning the coup started?'

464
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,579
The 24-hour curfew
had shut everrything down.

465
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:08,624
The phones were out. Charlie freaked
because he couldn't reach Beth.

466
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:11,335
Did you pick that up from Charlie?

467
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:15,547
Charles picked it up from me.
What happened next?

468
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:18,966
Well, we stayed at the hotel.
We didn't have much choice.

469
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,677
That's when you met all the Americans?

470
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:24,471
And they were caught up
by the coup also?

471
00:42:25,972 --> 00:42:28,558
- The others.
- Then you met Babcock?

472
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,187
No. Him we met the next morning.
Wednesday, September 12.

473
00:42:33,228 --> 00:42:35,314
- Here?
- Yeah, sure.

474
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:38,567
Me permite su periódico, señor.

475
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:43,321
You would do better to ask in English,
monsieur.

476
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:46,282
- Tu es français? Pardon.
- English.

477
00:42:46,324 --> 00:42:49,410
l come from Paris, Texas, boy.

478
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:52,162
- You're American.
- Red, white and blue.

479
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:54,748
- Well, you fooled me.
- Good, good.

480
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:57,667
l was just pulling your leg there...

481
00:42:57,707 --> 00:42:59,460
Charlie Horman.

482
00:42:59,502 --> 00:43:02,504
Nice to meet you.
This is my friend, Tery Simon.

483
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,297
- How are you?
- All right.

484
00:43:04,338 --> 00:43:06,633
Yes, you are.

485
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:09,010
Erm... That's my friend.

486
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:11,137
- Hello.
- Hello.

487
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:13,639
- Do you mind?
- No, help yourself.

488
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,475
- What'd you say your name was?
- l didn't.

489
00:43:16,515 --> 00:43:19,769
- My name's Andrew Babcock.
- Nice to meet you.

490
00:43:19,811 --> 00:43:23,523
- Thanks a lot. Are you a tourist?
- No, not exactly.

491
00:43:23,564 --> 00:43:25,649
What are you doing down here?

492
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,736
The navy sent me down here to do a job
and, er...she's done.

493
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:33,948
Where are you stationed?

494
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,576
Panama's my home base,
if that's what you mean.

495
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:39,870
You said you're with the navy.

496
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:42,831
l'm retired. l'm on a special assignment.

497
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,417
Really? What's it like in Panama?

498
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:48,544
- Panama's nice.
- Is it?

499
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:53,340
And it's a good place
to keep an eye on everrything.

500
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,139
There's my man from Milgroup.

501
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,311
- What's Milgroup?
- Just a US militay group.

502
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:11,940
There isn't
much news in there

503
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:14,942
for someone with such big ears
and such a long nose.

504
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:17,695
- But enjoy it.
- l will.

505
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:20,447
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

506
00:44:20,988 --> 00:44:22,866
Sure enough.

507
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:29,205
'Charlie said, ''That's incredible.'''

508
00:44:29,246 --> 00:44:32,457
l can't believe he told us all that.

509
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:35,543
That's when he decided
we should take notes.

510
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:39,172
- Notes on what?
- Didn't you hear what she said?

511
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:44,343
Ed, all those American officials
in Viña were probably involved in the coup.

512
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:48,471
- Do you believe that, Tery?
- Why don't you believe me?

513
00:44:48,513 --> 00:44:51,891
You married Charles.
It colours your perceptions.

514
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:55,936
- You're his damn father. What about yours?
- Come on.

515
00:44:55,977 --> 00:44:58,814
God! Whose side are you on?

516
00:45:02,107 --> 00:45:05,194
- How did you finally...

517
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:10,240
How did you finally get home?

518
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:12,576
'Ray Tower drove us back.

519
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:16,829
Erm...

520
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,914
That's all right. Listen...

521
00:45:18,955 --> 00:45:20,958
if you need anything, call me.

522
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:23,919
Here's my business card.
My home number's on the back.

523
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:25,087
OK.

524
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:27,756
Guess who's having dinner again tonight?

525
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:31,342
- Admiral Huidobro?
- Uh-huh.

526
00:45:31,841 --> 00:45:34,011
You gotta be kidding me. Again?

527
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:38,848
- Again. Can you believe that guy?
- Did he ask for the list? Of course.

528
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,851
ls this Tower?
How do you know him so well?

529
00:45:41,892 --> 00:45:44,145
We don't know him so well.

530
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:47,356
When Charlie disappeared,
that's who we contacted.

531
00:45:47,398 --> 00:45:49,691
- He invited us for dinner.

532
00:45:49,732 --> 00:45:52,485
- He said Admiral...
- Huidobro.

533
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:55,154
..Huidobro would be there and we could talk.

534
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:59,408
- But this admiral never showed up.

535
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:10,334
Ed, it happened just like this!

536
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:32,562
You went to Tower's house
to see that admiral, and...

537
00:46:32,604 --> 00:46:34,939
This admiral never showed up.

538
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,569
lt was past curfew, Tower insisted
we spend the night and we had to.

539
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:43,405
- Tery?

540
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:53,789
- What do you want?
- Got everrything you need?

541
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:55,290
Yes.

542
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:58,251
l appreciate everrything you've done

543
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:02,004
but would you do me a favour
and get out of here? Please?

544
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,924
You know, if l were you...

545
00:47:08,635 --> 00:47:10,720
l'd quit living in the past.

546
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:16,183
l think it's about time
you started thinking about your future.

547
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,068
You gotta learn to stay ahead
of the power curve, kid.

548
00:47:27,108 --> 00:47:29,945
- You know what l mean?
- Leave me alone!

549
00:47:29,987 --> 00:47:33,990
- Tery, it's me.
- It's an old aircraft carrier term.

550
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,909
Come on. Hury up.

551
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:39,495
lf a pilot gets ahead of the power curve
and something happens,

552
00:47:39,536 --> 00:47:42,081
- then he can pull up and away.
- Hury up!

553
00:47:42,122 --> 00:47:46,293
But if he falls behind the power curve
and something happens,

554
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:50,797
then it's adios. You gotta stay ahead
of the power curve, kid.

555
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:59,054
And when we woke up
the next morning, Tower was gone.

556
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:02,223
- When does your plane leave?
- Nine.

557
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:04,475
Would you take a letter for Elizabeth?

558
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:06,894
- l'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.

559
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:09,438
- Night, Ed.
- Want some fudge?

560
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:17,987
Why did you take a bath in his house?

561
00:48:18,736 --> 00:48:20,823
Ed, l took a bath.

562
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:23,950
We were stuck there.

563
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,418
Ed?

564
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:36,628
Ed.

565
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:40,673
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

566
00:48:40,714 --> 00:48:43,467
Can't you lower your voice? For a walk.

567
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:47,971
You can't go out for a walk.
It's curfew. You'll get shot.

568
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,857
Did she have an affair with Charles?

569
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,819
Why did you come here?

570
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:15,162
'Había 4 soldados con un oficial
y dos más trayendo unas cajas.'

571
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:17,956
'She says it was late afternoon.

572
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:23,877
'There were four soldiers and an officer,
and two soldiers carried boxes of things.'

573
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,008
Había otros soldados?

574
00:49:30,048 --> 00:49:33,636
Sí, había muchos,
esperando en un camión militar.

575
00:49:33,678 --> 00:49:37,389
There were many other soldiers
waiting in an army truck.

576
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,350
'Qué estás diciendo, mujer?
No fue así, te equivocas.

577
00:49:40,392 --> 00:49:43,853
'Yo no oí más que unos pocos milicos
y era un auto particular.'

578
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:46,897
'What did he say?'
'lt was a civilian truck,

579
00:49:46,938 --> 00:49:49,024
'and there weren't many soldiers.

580
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:55,363
No, estoy segura, había muchos soldados
en un camión del ejército, yo los vi.'

581
00:49:55,405 --> 00:50:00,951
'She says there were many soldiers,
and it was definitely an army truck.'

582
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:03,620
ls she sure it was Charles?

583
00:50:03,662 --> 00:50:06,623
Seguro que el muchacho fue mi marido?

584
00:50:06,664 --> 00:50:09,292
- Estoy segura que sí.
- Huh?

585
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:12,003
- She's pretty sure.
- She's pretty sure?

586
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:17,382
With witnesses like this, no wonder
nobody can find him. Buenos... Gracias.

587
00:50:17,424 --> 00:50:19,926
- Gracias.
- Hasta luego.

588
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:27,558
- Is this the way you found it?
- No. It was a real shambles.

589
00:50:30,852 --> 00:50:33,229
- You were living here?
- Yeah.

590
00:50:36,314 --> 00:50:38,401
Why?

591
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,487
We lived like everrybody else.

592
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:46,658
l guess it's easy to be poor when you have
a round-trip ticket in your pocket.

593
00:50:46,698 --> 00:50:49,452
Let me explain something, Ed.

594
00:50:49,492 --> 00:50:54,123
We're here because we wanna be here.
We like it.

595
00:50:54,163 --> 00:50:57,417
We have friends here.
We're not playing poor.

596
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:09,803
lt may sound weird to you but this is
one of the happiest homes l've ever had.

597
00:51:09,844 --> 00:51:12,347
l know Charlie feels the same way.

598
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:18,811
Doesn't look like it now
but we really had it together here.

599
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:24,399
Local artist.

600
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:38,578
Gracias.

601
00:51:42,748 --> 00:51:45,834
Your son's a pretty popular guy around here.

602
00:51:47,085 --> 00:51:50,588
- The Little Prince?
- That's a great book.

603
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:55,384
When we first got married,
Charlie read me a chapter everry night.

604
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:59,263
lt's about this little prince
and he meets a wild fox in the desert,

605
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:02,932
and little by little, by being verry gentle
and kind and thoughtful,

606
00:52:02,973 --> 00:52:07,478
he tames the fox,
so the fox tells him a secret. Let's see.

607
00:52:09,562 --> 00:52:13,442
''lt's only with the heart
that one can see rightly.

608
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:16,653
''What is essential is invisible to the eye.''

609
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:20,740
What is essential?

610
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:22,866
The stuff you can't see.

611
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:31,457
This is Charles' handwriting, isn't it?

612
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:36,920
''Once upon a time,
there was a county so far north

613
00:52:36,962 --> 00:52:39,965
''it was further north than the North Pole.''

614
00:52:42,217 --> 00:52:47,805
ls this part of the same book? No.
Charles...wrote this.

615
00:52:49,056 --> 00:52:51,475
''lt was further north than the Big Dipper.

616
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:55,978
''lt was even further north than the
Milky Way, and that's pretty far north.''

617
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:59,398
''Nobody knew its name
except the folks who lived there,

618
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,985
''because the ink in the explorers' pen
froze before they could write it down.''

619
00:53:04,027 --> 00:53:06,821
What does this mean -
''The Sunshine Grabber''?

620
00:53:06,863 --> 00:53:10,533
That's the name of an animated film
Charlie's working on.

621
00:53:10,573 --> 00:53:12,409
This is one of the characters.

622
00:53:13,035 --> 00:53:15,329
Recognise the eyes?

623
00:53:19,456 --> 00:53:24,086
But he seems so innocent,
almost deliberately naive.

624
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:28,090
ls that so bad?

625
00:53:29,091 --> 00:53:31,551
ls that so good?

626
00:53:31,592 --> 00:53:33,678
You raised him.

627
00:53:38,057 --> 00:53:41,268
- Who is it?
- moman) Soy yo, Beth.

628
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:43,186
Hello.

629
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:48,899
Señora Duran. Ed Horman.

630
00:53:48,941 --> 00:53:52,653
This is the lady whose mother
lives across the street.

631
00:53:52,694 --> 00:53:54,780
- Hello.
- Buenos dias.

632
00:53:56,197 --> 00:53:59,325
- El coche está esperando.
- Taxi's waiting.

633
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:04,204
Aquí, a la derecha.

634
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:08,750
l was leaving my mother,
who lives across the street.

635
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:13,796
A taxi came for me just when the soldiers
put your husband in the truck.

636
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,882
Ahora a la izquierda, por favor.

637
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:31,395
My taxi followed
the same road the truck took.

638
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:38,818
They drove right into that big door
and went inside the stadium.

639
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,570
- How come you followed them?
- She didn't...

640
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:45,157
Let her answer.
Why did your taxi follow the truck?

641
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,826
Well, l just live beyond the stadium.

642
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:52,205
l have to go past here when l come
from the house of my mother.

643
00:54:57,834 --> 00:55:00,253
- l don't believe that!
- Ed, don't.

644
00:55:00,295 --> 00:55:03,965
Don't. They could arrest her
just for talking to us.

645
00:55:10,887 --> 00:55:15,308
Hello, Beth. Mr Horman,
my name's Kate Newman. l'm a reporter.

646
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:19,812
ls it true you are fed up with the way
the embassy's been handling this

647
00:55:19,853 --> 00:55:22,523
and you're planning your own investigation?

648
00:55:22,563 --> 00:55:25,900
- There's Putnam.
- Er...

649
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:30,988
l'm not interested in challenging them,
l'm concerned with getting back my son.

650
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,241
- Excuse us, please.
- Beth, get him to talk to me.

651
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:36,368
- OK.
- OK.

652
00:55:41,998 --> 00:55:44,125
- What happened?
- Shall we sit down?

653
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,834
ls there any news?

654
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:49,254
We bacMracked
over all our militay leads so far.

655
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:51,798
They still deny knowledge of his arrest.

656
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,801
We had a fingerprint check made
at all the morgues. Came up negative.

657
00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:59,555
- Do you trust your sources?
- Captain Tower checked them.

658
00:55:59,595 --> 00:56:02,891
- Then l'm sure they're impeccable.
- What we need now

659
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:05,894
is more background information,
mostly from Beth.

660
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:08,604
For example, why you were living here.

661
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:13,609
We were tired of seeing the world
through the New York Times.

662
00:56:13,649 --> 00:56:16,152
- Why this county?
- Of all Latin America,

663
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:18,905
- this seemed the best.
- Politically?

664
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:22,491
ln everry way, till your generals took over.

665
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:24,618
They're not our generals.

666
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:27,454
Why don't we shift our ground a little here?

667
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:30,248
- Beth, what was Charles doing?
- Was?

668
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:33,709
l'm sorry.
What kind of work is Charles doing?

669
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:38,297
He's working on an animated children's film
and he writes articles.

670
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:40,424
- Articles for FIN?
- What is FIN?

671
00:56:40,465 --> 00:56:42,467
lt's a left-wing newspaper.

672
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:46,137
lt is not left-wing.
Besides, he doesn't write for it.

673
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:49,932
He translates news stories
for such bastions of communism

674
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:53,018
as the New York Post
and the Wall Street Journal.

675
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,186
- There's another theoy.
- What?

676
00:56:55,227 --> 00:56:58,648
That your son was picked up
by leftists posing as soldiers.

677
00:56:58,689 --> 00:57:03,610
As a matter of fact, there are even people
who think it may have been his idea.

678
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:06,696
You've gotta be kidding me.

679
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:11,117
He could've done it to make it look like
the government are arresting Americans.

680
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:13,285
They are arresting Americans.

681
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:16,246
Or don't David Holloway
and Frank Teruggi count?!

682
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,373
Shh. Of course they count.

683
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:21,543
l heard about them
in Washington, Teruggi and...

684
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:24,712
They're released, right?
We should speak to them.

685
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:27,047
- We're seeing David tomorrow.
- We are?

686
00:57:27,965 --> 00:57:29,633
ls that my list?

687
00:57:29,674 --> 00:57:33,178
No. These are things
l'd just like you to check on.

688
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:37,223
Hm.

689
00:57:38,474 --> 00:57:40,643
OK, l'll do my best.

690
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:44,521
Well, if that's all
l guess we can get back'to work.

691
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:49,442
Just one moment, please.
To be frank, l know that in these countries,

692
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:53,070
the embassies have agents
involved with the police

693
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:56,365
- and militay training...
- This has nothing...

694
00:57:56,405 --> 00:58:00,285
l assume that this case
has something to do with it,

695
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:02,662
and l don't care how or who runs it,

696
00:58:02,702 --> 00:58:05,539
l just want you to use it
to help find my son.

697
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:09,084
- l assure you...
- That's all l have to say.

698
00:58:11,586 --> 00:58:15,089
l noticed you were talking
with a reporter before.

699
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,843
lt might be better for the investigation
if you hold off on that for a while.

700
00:58:19,884 --> 00:58:21,970
You know what l mean?

701
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:24,931
- l'll hold off.
- Good.

702
00:58:26,432 --> 00:58:28,226
Mrs Horman.

703
00:58:28,267 --> 00:58:32,313
- Three, please.
- l can't believe what you said there.

704
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:36,566
lf you call a spade a spade,
you'll get a favourable response.

705
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:39,736
- You can also get dead.
- That's your paranoia.

706
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:42,154
- And, of course, Charles's.
- Ed...

707
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:45,199
Why didn't you make the list of his friends?

708
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:47,993
- Are you serious?
- Do l look like l'm joking?

709
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:53,915
Five minutes after l give that list to Tower,
those friends will probably be arrested.

710
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:58,877
- Charles knew some dangerous people.
- We're not criminals, Ed!

711
00:58:58,918 --> 00:59:01,505
- Charlie's not a failure.
- l didn't say that.

712
00:59:01,545 --> 00:59:03,590
You always imply it.

713
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:08,886
lf you'd stayed and paid attention to basics,
this wouldn't have happened.

714
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:11,513
The basics? God, county and Wall Street?

715
00:59:11,555 --> 00:59:14,849
- You know what l mean.
- God bless our way of life.

716
00:59:14,891 --> 00:59:17,644
A verry good way of life it is, young lady,

717
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:23,023
no matter how much people like you
ty to tear it down with your sloppy idealism.

718
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:28,486
l can no longer abide the young people
of our county who live off their parents

719
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:32,448
and find nothing better to do
than whine and complain!

720
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,534
- Is that your image of Charlie and me?
- Yes.

721
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:40,205
Ed. How can that be?
We're not freaked out.

722
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:43,958
We're just two normal,
slightly confused people

723
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,504
tying to be connected
to the whole damn rotten enchilada.

724
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:51,840
Screw you then, Mr Horman!

725
00:59:51,882 --> 00:59:54,592
Why don't you just go back to New York?

726
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:59,889
You're just messing things up.

727
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:24,243
Ed?

728
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,915
l'm sorry, Ed.

729
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:34,752
Are you all right?

730
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:37,588
l said l'm sorry.

731
01:00:39,464 --> 01:00:40,924
Shit.

732
01:00:40,965 --> 01:00:43,051
Always me and my big mouth.

733
01:00:46,803 --> 01:00:49,307
Frank, you're not asleep yet?

734
01:00:50,473 --> 01:00:52,643
Stop fucking around. Shit!

735
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:55,520
- Está bien, no disparen.
- Has visto a Holloway?

736
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:58,648
- Holloway.
- Dónde está Frank Teruggi?

737
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:08,615
Frank?

738
01:01:09,823 --> 01:01:13,286
Holy shit. What's going on?

739
01:01:13,326 --> 01:01:16,414
- Be cool.
- What is this?

740
01:01:16,454 --> 01:01:20,500
- Get your hands off me, asshole.
- Stop, they'll kill you.

741
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:23,044
Bullshit.

742
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:07,083
We have the right
to call our embassy!

743
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:10,127
- ;Son americanos!
- Tranquilo, son americanos.

744
01:02:39,818 --> 01:02:42,196
- Lugar donde trabaja.
- El Senado.

745
01:02:42,238 --> 01:02:44,865
- Qué hace ahí?
- Soy senador.

746
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:48,619
Dónde lo aprendió?

747
01:02:49,661 --> 01:02:53,832
40 años.
Estado civil.

748
01:02:53,872 --> 01:02:57,126
Você tira a roupa dessa gente
e leva eles para cá.

749
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:05,633
They're not gonna hurt us, OK?

750
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:25,859
We, erm, never found out what happened.

751
01:03:28,861 --> 01:03:31,531
A lot of rumours going around about...

752
01:03:32,531 --> 01:03:35,576
torture and specialists.

753
01:03:37,453 --> 01:03:39,872
- Brazilians.
- You were tortured?

754
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:45,293
Oh, no.

755
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:47,420
Somebody stepped on my hand.

756
01:03:51,422 --> 01:03:53,967
They're gonna shoot us, aren't they, Frank?

757
01:03:54,008 --> 01:03:58,805
No, l don't think so, David.
They're just tying to scare us, that's all.

758
01:03:58,846 --> 01:04:01,057
Well, they sure as hell succeeded.

759
01:04:01,098 --> 01:04:05,519
l can't take you anmhere.
Next time we get arrested, l'm going alone.

760
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:07,979
You're really full of shit, Frank.

761
01:04:11,106 --> 01:04:13,192
Come on. David, come on.

762
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:16,820
They can't kill us.
Our embassy'll go bananas.

763
01:04:16,861 --> 01:04:18,947
l can't help it.

764
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,616
They're gonna shoot that guy, aren't they?

765
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:27,038
l'll bet you dinner at Arturo's
we'll be out of here by morning.

766
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:29,373
What do you say? Come on.

767
01:04:31,874 --> 01:04:33,543
Teruggi?

768
01:04:34,626 --> 01:04:35,795
Teruggi!

769
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:39,423
Looks like you lose, turkey.

770
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:44,136
Now be strong, all right?

771
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:47,764
As soon as l get out,
l'm going to the embassy.

772
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:49,891
Remember, you owe me one. Arturo's.

773
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:53,686
- Vamos.
- Hold your water, scumbag. l'm coming.

774
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:04,237
That's the last time l ever saw Frank.

775
01:05:05,445 --> 01:05:08,365
They released me the next day.

776
01:05:08,406 --> 01:05:11,243
The State Department said
Frank left when he got out.

777
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:15,913
l spoke to Frank's dad in Chicago.
Frank never called him or anyone else.

778
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:19,959
- Maybe he's in hiding too.
- You think Charlie's in hiding?

779
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:24,546
- l don't.
- You insist upon rejecting that hope!

780
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,673
Because it's just not true.

781
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:33,345
This newspaper that you all have worked on.

782
01:05:33,386 --> 01:05:36,431
Could that be the reason
why you were arrested?

783
01:05:36,473 --> 01:05:39,434
They never even interrogated me about it.

784
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:41,561
Was Charles verry active in it?

785
01:05:42,144 --> 01:05:47,232
Just like the rest of us. Sometimes put in
18 hours a day just to get it out.

786
01:05:47,274 --> 01:05:50,485
Charles worked 18 hours a day?

787
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:52,862
Sometimes, sure.

788
01:05:52,903 --> 01:05:56,157
What did you get paid for those 18 hours?

789
01:05:56,198 --> 01:05:58,617
A little gratitude, some respect.

790
01:05:59,201 --> 01:06:03,830
You don't get verry many hot dogs
with a little gratitude, do you?

791
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,957
Let's don't start.

792
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,628
Have you looked for Frank here?

793
01:06:10,669 --> 01:06:14,297
l looked for him everywhere,
even in the morgue.

794
01:06:15,382 --> 01:06:17,467
He's just gone.

795
01:06:19,426 --> 01:06:21,304
Vanished.

796
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:25,057
Sometimes l...

797
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:30,103
l get the feeling we're never gonna
see him again.

798
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,776
l'm ready, Ed.

799
01:06:39,444 --> 01:06:41,321
What?

800
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:46,617
- What are you doing?
- l fix the telephone.

801
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:48,827
The telephone works perfectly.

802
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:50,954
Now is working better.

803
01:06:52,497 --> 01:06:56,626
- They fixed mine yesterday.
- How can he be that brazen about it?

804
01:06:56,668 --> 01:07:00,087
Hello, Ray Tower.
How is everrything over there?

805
01:07:04,591 --> 01:07:06,676
Hello? Yes?

806
01:07:08,094 --> 01:07:10,179
What about?

807
01:07:10,929 --> 01:07:13,015
Thank you. Fine.

808
01:07:16,726 --> 01:07:18,728
Who was it?

809
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:21,523
The ambassador wants
to see me in the morning.

810
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:23,858
- Why?
- l don't know.

811
01:07:34,075 --> 01:07:35,535
Yes, sir.

812
01:07:35,575 --> 01:07:38,537
- Mr Horman, you can go in now.
- Thank you.

813
01:07:41,164 --> 01:07:43,959
Good morning. Beth, l'm sorry.

814
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,669
This appointment is only for Mr Horman.

815
01:07:46,711 --> 01:07:50,131
Anything l'm about to hear is for her also.

816
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:53,550
lt's all right,
send them both in.

817
01:07:53,592 --> 01:07:55,469
Come right in, please.

818
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:58,013
- Mr Ambassador.
- Good morning. Have a seat.

819
01:07:58,054 --> 01:08:00,139
- What happened?
- Have a seat, please.

820
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:02,725
- What happened?
- Did you find him?

821
01:08:02,767 --> 01:08:06,437
What? Oh, no, not that at all. l'm sorry.

822
01:08:06,478 --> 01:08:08,563
What is it then?

823
01:08:08,605 --> 01:08:12,192
l hear you'd like to discuss
some political questions.

824
01:08:12,233 --> 01:08:14,277
- What?
- You suggested

825
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:19,656
that there might be some kind of
American police assistance program here.

826
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:23,493
l'd like you to know nothing of that sort
exists in this county.

827
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:26,996
Mr Ambassador,
l'm not interested in the politics.

828
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:30,833
l just want you to use
everry resource at your command.

829
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:32,960
l repeat, Mr Horman,

830
01:08:33,001 --> 01:08:36,630
no such operation exists.

831
01:08:38,423 --> 01:08:43,427
l got the clearance for those hospitals
you wanted to visit.

832
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:45,554
What about the national stadium?

833
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:47,806
- Well, it's kind of touchy.
- Handle it!

834
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:50,391
What do you mean, ''it's touchy''?

835
01:08:50,432 --> 01:08:52,518
Look, gentlemen...

836
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:59,274
l know these are bad times,
it's not fun for you people.

837
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:04,195
lt's certainly not fun for Beth or me.
Or Charles.

838
01:09:04,237 --> 01:09:08,240
You're doing your best,
l have to believe that. That's our only hope.

839
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:11,660
But you have all the machiney on your side.

840
01:09:11,702 --> 01:09:14,788
Don't you see?
You have all the connections.

841
01:09:14,829 --> 01:09:18,082
l'm a middle-aged businessman
from New York.

842
01:09:18,123 --> 01:09:20,835
l don't speak one word of Spanish.
Here l am.

843
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:22,961
My son may have been shot.

844
01:09:23,003 --> 01:09:25,922
Maybe he was tortured.
Maybe he was - oh, Lord -

845
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:29,217
beaten so badly
that they're keeping him until he's well.

846
01:09:29,259 --> 01:09:31,552
l don't know. l don't care.

847
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,516
Really, l don't care.

848
01:09:38,057 --> 01:09:40,643
Because what is done is done.

849
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:45,690
l want you to tell those people
l will take Charles back in any condition.

850
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:49,067
l'm not gonna make a stink.
l'm not gonna go to the newspapers.

851
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:52,529
You make out any kind of a release form,
l will sign it.

852
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:55,198
l will absolve anyone,
everryone of everrything.

853
01:09:55,238 --> 01:09:57,575
l just want my boy back!

854
01:10:04,915 --> 01:10:07,625
He's the only child l have, sir.

855
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,050
Did you hear what l said?

856
01:10:18,717 --> 01:10:20,803
Yes, l did, Mr Horman.

857
01:10:22,762 --> 01:10:24,849
Oh...

858
01:10:26,057 --> 01:10:28,310
Come on, Ed. The meeting's over.

859
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,361
- l made a fool out of myself.
- Ed, you were great.

860
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:43,114
Mr Horman, don't feel bad, please.
Just ty to understand.

861
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:47,326
There are so many cases,
this isn't the only one we're working on.

862
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:49,870
This is the only one that l care about.

863
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:54,082
You and a lot of other people. l've never
seen so many cables from Washington.

864
01:10:54,123 --> 01:10:56,876
What kind of pull do you have up there?

865
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:59,003
l'm an American citizen.

866
01:11:05,259 --> 01:11:06,927
Mr Horman.

867
01:11:07,803 --> 01:11:11,973
Sorry. Dave McGeay from the consulate.
l've got Beth outside in the car.

868
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:14,100
l'll be with you in a moment.

869
01:11:25,068 --> 01:11:28,779
- You all set?
- No, but let's get it over with.

870
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,489
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

871
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:52,550
Where would you like to start?

872
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:57,262
l've listed the hospitals geographically,
and the first is St Anne's.

873
01:11:57,304 --> 01:12:00,390
- OK. That's on Avenue Ruiz.
- Yes, l know.

874
01:12:00,432 --> 01:12:04,143
Listen, er, if you don't mind my asking,

875
01:12:04,184 --> 01:12:06,520
what's Christian Science about?

876
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:10,023
Faith. It's about faith.

877
01:12:11,357 --> 01:12:13,568
Faith in what?

878
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:15,695
ln truth.

879
01:12:25,245 --> 01:12:28,373
There's no one registered
under the name of Horman?

880
01:12:28,414 --> 01:12:31,709
- No, sir.
- Have we seen all of the patients?

881
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:35,879
Yes, except for los perdidos -
the ones with no names.

882
01:12:35,921 --> 01:12:39,007
- Well, where are they?
- Below, in the basement.

883
01:12:39,049 --> 01:12:43,427
l'm sure we don't have him,
but you can check by yourself.

884
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:16,414
molf whistle)

885
01:13:19,124 --> 01:13:21,169
l'm verry sorry.

886
01:13:23,211 --> 01:13:25,089
Gracias.

887
01:13:31,635 --> 01:13:34,388
- No está.
- Gracias.

888
01:13:48,776 --> 01:13:51,904
Muchas personas viene aquí todos los días.

889
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:54,573
Many people come here everry day.

890
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:58,326
Seguramente algunos de ellos están locos.

891
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:03,247
Several of them are certainly insane.

892
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:08,126
Para eso.

893
01:14:09,418 --> 01:14:11,587
;Para eso!

894
01:14:12,713 --> 01:14:15,382
Ahí solamente son los desahuciados.

895
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:19,511
Mr Horman.

896
01:14:19,552 --> 01:14:21,971
Sir, these are the incurables here.

897
01:15:01,673 --> 01:15:05,092
- Where you going?
- Go ahead. l wanna take a walk.

898
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:07,553
Ed, you don't know your way around.

899
01:15:07,593 --> 01:15:11,723
Please, l'll catch a cab. l'll be fine.
l-l need the air.

900
01:15:12,515 --> 01:15:14,600
l'm going with ya.

901
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:19,855
- We're gonna walk.
- Beth, it's too dangerous.

902
01:15:27,527 --> 01:15:31,031
Charles always used to drive me crazy
when he was little.

903
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:35,243
Cape Cod, running up and down,
throwing everrything into the ocean.

904
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,370
He still likes to do that.

905
01:15:38,829 --> 01:15:42,083
l wonder what they're doing
up on old Cape Cod.

906
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:47,546
Now it's out of season. The beach is empty,
houses are all boarded up.

907
01:15:49,965 --> 01:15:54,510
That summer, before we were married,
we came to visit you and Elizabeth,

908
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,638
and you made us sleep
in separate bedrooms.

909
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,097
Yes.

910
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:03,309
One night we snuck out,
went down to the beach to make out.

911
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:06,771
There was all this sparkly phosphorous
in the water.

912
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:10,691
There was a guy there listening
to the Red Sox game on the radio.

913
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,318
What else does Charles like to do?

914
01:16:14,485 --> 01:16:19,991
l don't know. He likes to pretend he's
a county-western singer in the shower.

915
01:16:20,032 --> 01:16:22,368
But he's got a terrible voice.

916
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:27,455
And he likes to cook corned beef hash
with an egg in it.

917
01:16:27,497 --> 01:16:30,208
- And he's a star freak.
- A what?

918
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:35,254
A star freak. He can point out
everry constellation up there.

919
01:16:35,295 --> 01:16:37,381
- l never knew that.
- Yeah.

920
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:40,634
And he loves to make love
on Sunday mornings.

921
01:16:40,675 --> 01:16:43,428
ln fact, he's a regular sex maniac.

922
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:48,849
l really don't want to hear about your...
bedroom antics.

923
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,976
Come on.

924
01:16:54,187 --> 01:16:56,773
'Las papas... Oh.'

925
01:16:56,813 --> 01:16:58,816
- 'Y el queso?'
- 'Aquí.'

926
01:17:02,611 --> 01:17:04,696
That's Frank Teruggi.

927
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:08,616
- 'Oh, my God.'
- 'You're not bad.'

928
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:13,704
'lf you have two houses, the state takes one,
gives it to the man who has no house.

929
01:17:13,745 --> 01:17:15,372
'Sí, sí.'

930
01:17:15,414 --> 01:17:21,419
'lf you have two cars, the state takes one,
gives it to the man with no car.

931
01:17:21,461 --> 01:17:26,548
'lf you have two chickens, the state takes
one, gives it to the man with none.

932
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,512
- 'l thought you understood our revolution.'
- 'l have two chickens.'

933
01:17:34,305 --> 01:17:38,100
- 'That's the whole stoy.'
- 'l have two cameras.'

934
01:17:40,185 --> 01:17:42,646
'Women and children first!'

935
01:17:42,686 --> 01:17:47,692
- 'We got diapers in here.'
- 'No!'

936
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:49,986
'Give it back!'

937
01:17:50,026 --> 01:17:52,905
What is this about? Why did you make this?

938
01:17:52,946 --> 01:17:57,242
Just for fun.
It was a party for Tery.

939
01:17:57,283 --> 01:17:59,953
'Ever been to Viña? These are from Viña.'

940
01:17:59,994 --> 01:18:03,247
'That's an idea.
We should take her to the beach.'

941
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:05,916
- 'Great beach.'
- 'l'll be in New York.'

942
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:09,669
- 'We'll go tomorrow.'
- 'l gotta renew my visa. You all go.'

943
01:18:09,711 --> 01:18:12,046
- 'Next day.'
- 'You shouldn't miss it.'

944
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,507
- 'No, go. Go tomorrow.'
- 'Day trip?

945
01:18:14,549 --> 01:18:17,259
'Bring your camera. Bring your cameras.'

946
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:20,554
- 'l'll stay home.'
- That's all.

947
01:18:20,594 --> 01:18:23,515
Sir, your son is not what they told you.

948
01:18:23,555 --> 01:18:26,809
- How do you know that, Silvio?
- He's a nice guy, sincere.

949
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:31,438
Hard worker, but he's a political neophyte.
He's terrified of violence.

950
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,232
- What's wrong with that?
- l'm not knocking him.

951
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:37,277
l like Charlie
and l've got my fingers crossed.

952
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,988
Why did you go into hiding?

953
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:43,866
- l knew they would pick me up.
- What had you done?

954
01:18:43,907 --> 01:18:48,995
You Americans always assume you must
do something before you can be arrested.

955
01:18:49,037 --> 01:18:52,915
- Isn't that the way it usually works?
- Not here, Mr Horman.

956
01:18:52,956 --> 01:18:56,293
lt's crazy, Charlie being arrested by them,

957
01:18:56,335 --> 01:18:59,129
when some people thought
he was from the CIA.

958
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:00,422
What?

959
01:19:00,463 --> 01:19:04,300
Charlie was always asking questions,
taking notes on everrything.

960
01:19:05,258 --> 01:19:08,220
- l warned him.
- And?

961
01:19:08,261 --> 01:19:10,973
He just laughed and took a note.

962
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:17,603
He will come back, Beth, just as Carlos has.

963
01:19:25,402 --> 01:19:28,613
- This is all of them, Colonel?
- Me temo que sí.

964
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:33,033
One form for each prisoner
who was held and released.

965
01:19:33,075 --> 01:19:36,828
- But none for my son?
- That means that he was not here.

966
01:19:37,787 --> 01:19:39,873
Come and check for yourself.

967
01:19:39,913 --> 01:19:42,375
l thought Frank Teruggi was released.

968
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:43,960
Who?

969
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,504
Teruggi. The man arrested
with David Holloway.

970
01:19:47,546 --> 01:19:50,340
Very sorry. l don't recall his name.

971
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:53,426
Shall we?

972
01:20:07,646 --> 01:20:11,108
'Atención, su atención...'

973
01:20:20,742 --> 01:20:22,827
Go ahead, Mr Horman.

974
01:20:37,088 --> 01:20:40,926
l-l can't seem to.
You go ahead. You...you start.

975
01:20:42,552 --> 01:20:45,513
Charlie, this is Beth.

976
01:20:48,306 --> 01:20:50,726
l'm here with your dad, Charlie,

977
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,146
and the American consul.

978
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:59,067
So, ifyou can hear me,

979
01:21:01,943 --> 01:21:04,696
please come out so we can take you home.

980
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:20,168
Charles Horman,

981
01:21:21,378 --> 01:21:24,130
this is your father, Edmund.

982
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:30,677
l'm here in the hope
that you can hear me.

983
01:21:42,396 --> 01:21:44,690
Charles. Charles.

984
01:21:46,608 --> 01:21:48,693
Do you remember when we...

985
01:21:48,734 --> 01:21:53,948
took that trip together across county
from LA to New York?

986
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,286
Just the two of us?

987
01:22:11,463 --> 01:22:14,382
That's him. Oh, my God, that's him!

988
01:22:14,424 --> 01:22:18,010
- No, it's not. It's not him, Ed.
- Charles!

989
01:22:18,552 --> 01:22:20,763
lt's not him. It's not him, Ed.

990
01:22:24,348 --> 01:22:26,434
My father cannot come here,

991
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:32,147
but how about some ice cream
with my dinner, Colonel Espinoza?

992
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:37,944
Ambassador,
my friends have talked to refugees

993
01:22:37,985 --> 01:22:41,155
in the Swedish, Mexican
and French embassies.

994
01:22:41,196 --> 01:22:44,116
The man they must see is here
in your embassy.

995
01:22:44,157 --> 01:22:47,411
All these people
are here for protection.

996
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:51,706
- l am responsible for their lives.
- Oh, come on, look at them.

997
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:53,833
Do they look like assassins?

998
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,586
Ve y dile que no son problema.

999
01:22:57,627 --> 01:23:01,465
- Beth. Mr Horman.
- OK, Kate. This way.

1000
01:23:12,975 --> 01:23:16,519
You must remember,
Mr Paris is a desperate man.

1001
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:28,863
- How many refugees have you got here?
- About 800, 900.

1002
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:46,671
'There were four of them
in Lutz's office.'

1003
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:51,049
The general, of course, the colonel,
my friend, who told me of this,

1004
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,677
- and the American.
- The prisoner?

1005
01:23:53,718 --> 01:23:57,472
The American officer.
No, the prisoner was in the next room.

1006
01:23:57,513 --> 01:24:00,057
- Was he alive?
- More or less.

1007
01:24:00,098 --> 01:24:02,184
What do you mean, ''more or less''?

1008
01:24:02,225 --> 01:24:07,105
- l'm only telling you what l heard.
- What does ''more or less'' mean?

1009
01:24:07,147 --> 01:24:11,651
Well, apparently he had been roughed up
during interrogation.

1010
01:24:11,691 --> 01:24:14,820
- How badly?
- l don't know. l wasn't there.

1011
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:19,032
- Your friend was?
- My former friend, Mr Horman.

1012
01:24:19,073 --> 01:24:21,993
Nobody in this regime
is my friend any longer.

1013
01:24:22,034 --> 01:24:24,954
Who was the American officer in the room?

1014
01:24:24,996 --> 01:24:28,415
Who knows? The ministy is full of them.

1015
01:24:29,082 --> 01:24:33,920
Their Milgroup office is down the hall
from the general. This is a scoop for you.

1016
01:24:33,962 --> 01:24:36,130
Oh, Paris, everryone knows that.

1017
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:40,926
Did they mention the prisoner?
Did they call the prisoner by name?

1018
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:43,470
- Horseman?
- Horman?

1019
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:45,847
Maybe. Horman, sure.

1020
01:24:45,889 --> 01:24:49,725
Horman. If l had been there,
l would know for sure.

1021
01:24:50,976 --> 01:24:55,355
l am an honour graduate
of your police academy in Washington.

1022
01:24:55,396 --> 01:25:00,360
l like America. There it is more democratic
and someday l hope to...

1023
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:06,073
Paris, please. Just tell them what
the General Lutz said about the prisoner.

1024
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:08,325
- Who is Lutz?
- He's the...

1025
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:11,953
He's the head of the local version of the CIA.

1026
01:25:11,995 --> 01:25:14,539
He said the man must disappear.

1027
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:18,459
- Oh, my God! Why?
- He knew too much.

1028
01:25:18,499 --> 01:25:20,794
- About what?
- l don't know.

1029
01:25:21,711 --> 01:25:25,757
But only a few verry important people
have been detained,

1030
01:25:25,797 --> 01:25:28,676
most of them were killed after interrogation.

1031
01:25:28,717 --> 01:25:32,846
- The others were sent to camps.
- What happened to my son?

1032
01:25:33,597 --> 01:25:36,099
They drove him back to the stadium.

1033
01:25:37,516 --> 01:25:40,478
How can you order the disappearance
of an American?

1034
01:25:40,519 --> 01:25:44,315
- l didn't order his disappearance!
- Ed, he didn't.

1035
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:47,025
l'm a police officer but l'm not a murderer.

1036
01:25:47,067 --> 01:25:52,071
- We know you're a good man...
- l have worked for many governments.

1037
01:25:52,112 --> 01:25:56,408
Some, their politics l agreed with.
Others, not so much.

1038
01:25:56,450 --> 01:26:00,078
l have worked now
for the junta for two weeks,

1039
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:02,205
but these are Nazis.

1040
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:08,752
They are destroying everrything
that was beautiful about this county.

1041
01:26:08,793 --> 01:26:13,090
What we need to know is
can they order an American to disappear

1042
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:16,259
without consulting the Americans first?

1043
01:26:17,427 --> 01:26:19,512
No, they wouldn't dare.

1044
01:26:20,887 --> 01:26:22,973
How can l verify that?

1045
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:26,685
You can't.

1046
01:26:29,145 --> 01:26:31,230
What's gonna happen to these people?

1047
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:35,025
Safe for the moment.
Later, they'll be deported.

1048
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:39,654
- What about Paris?
- He's not even close to getting out of here.

1049
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:43,950
- Why does he talk?
- If he gets enough press, they won't kill him.

1050
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:47,369
They won't dare to.
It's like the old switch-hitting game.

1051
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:49,496
Only way to survive.

1052
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:57,378
Do you think that prisoner
in the other room was Charles?

1053
01:26:57,419 --> 01:26:59,505
What do you think?

1054
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:03,675
What could Charles know
that's so important?

1055
01:27:03,716 --> 01:27:08,304
- Probably what he discovered in Viña.
- Do you still have his notes?

1056
01:27:08,346 --> 01:27:10,765
- Yeah, at the hotel.

1057
01:27:29,322 --> 01:27:32,742
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Ed, you'll get shot!

1058
01:27:32,783 --> 01:27:35,870
- Mr Horman.
- Stop! Stop it!

1059
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:37,872
Good God!

1060
01:27:37,913 --> 01:27:39,998
Shut this.

1061
01:27:41,123 --> 01:27:43,543
Were you tying to get us all killed?

1062
01:27:43,584 --> 01:27:45,044
l'm sorry.

1063
01:27:45,086 --> 01:27:49,548
l am just beginning to get amully
sick and tired of all of this...

1064
01:27:49,589 --> 01:27:51,675
shit!

1065
01:27:51,716 --> 01:27:56,137
l saw your son do almost
the same damn dumb thing.

1066
01:27:56,178 --> 01:27:58,264
He did that?

1067
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:03,310
''During the barbecue,
Ray Tower arrived.

1068
01:28:03,351 --> 01:28:05,771
''Later he drove us back to Santiago.

1069
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:10,400
''Trip uneventful, aside roadblock incident,
detailed page 12.''

1070
01:28:10,441 --> 01:28:15,321
- Ray Tower drove 'em back?
- ''Later he drove us back to Santiago.''

1071
01:28:15,362 --> 01:28:17,948
Well, what? Does that mean something?

1072
01:28:22,327 --> 01:28:25,079
Go back to where they first meet Babcock.

1073
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,165
''Charlie - 'May l borrow
that paper if you're through?'

1074
01:28:28,206 --> 01:28:32,669
''Babcock with a French Accent -
'You'd do better to ask in English.'''

1075
01:28:32,711 --> 01:28:34,796
You're French?

1076
01:28:34,838 --> 01:28:37,215
'Skip ahead to why he was there.'

1077
01:28:37,257 --> 01:28:43,262
- What are you doing down here?
- The navy sent me to do a job. She's done.

1078
01:28:43,303 --> 01:28:46,139
Any idea how long we'll be stuck in Viña?

1079
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:50,393
About a week. Everything's all right.
The coup went verry smoothly.

1080
01:28:50,435 --> 01:28:55,230
- You're completely safe.
- Was it planned verry far in advance?

1081
01:28:55,271 --> 01:28:59,025
Tery, does a bear shit in the woods?

1082
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:04,072
- Will the US recognise the government?
- That's up to the politicians.

1083
01:29:04,113 --> 01:29:08,659
''Red-haired woman appeared edgy.
Babcock stopped talking.''

1084
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:11,453
Did Babcock introduce them to Patrick?

1085
01:29:11,495 --> 01:29:15,540
No, Charlie introduced himself.
''The next day in the lobby...''

1086
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:17,667
Excuse me, Colonel.

1087
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:21,670
''Colonel - 'Hello. What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?'

1088
01:29:21,712 --> 01:29:24,881
'''l'm Charles Horman.
This is my friend, Tery Simon.'

1089
01:29:24,923 --> 01:29:29,177
''l explained that we'd come for one day
and got stuck by the coup.''

1090
01:29:29,218 --> 01:29:32,680
Oh. You'll be here a while.
The roads are closed.

1091
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,349
What's happening in the capital?

1092
01:29:36,308 --> 01:29:40,895
The militay's doing search-and-destroy
missions, just like in Vietnam.

1093
01:29:40,937 --> 01:29:44,065
There are bodies everywhere.
It's a royal mess.

1094
01:29:44,106 --> 01:29:47,276
How long before you think
the roads are open?

1095
01:29:47,316 --> 01:29:52,238
l don't know - but give me
your room number, l'll keep you posted.

1096
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,115
l'd appreciate it.

1097
01:29:54,157 --> 01:29:56,659
''l'm terribly anxious about Beth.''

1098
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:17,469
''Next morning Babcock was in lobby
with carton of Kents and without lady.''

1099
01:30:17,509 --> 01:30:20,638
- How's it going?
- Can't complain. Yourself?

1100
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:23,599
l complain.

1101
01:30:23,641 --> 01:30:25,309
Uh-oh.

1102
01:30:26,768 --> 01:30:28,895
Where are you going when you leave?

1103
01:30:28,937 --> 01:30:30,897
Probably Bolivia.

1104
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:35,151
- Bolivia is beautiful. You'll love it.
- That's what l hear.

1105
01:30:35,192 --> 01:30:37,278
So are you.

1106
01:30:38,611 --> 01:30:42,115
Of course, they have
their problems too, but...

1107
01:30:42,157 --> 01:30:45,785
lf they've got problems,
you'll probably go there next.

1108
01:30:45,826 --> 01:30:47,912
l know l'll go there next.

1109
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,375
Sherlock, tell me something.

1110
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:56,169
What would a naval engineer
be doing in Bolivia,

1111
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:59,672
one of two landlocked countries
in Latin America?

1112
01:31:01,506 --> 01:31:03,467
Sir, any news?

1113
01:31:03,508 --> 01:31:07,929
lf l were you, l wouldn't be so anxious
to be there. It is a battlefield.

1114
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:10,265
But sir...

1115
01:31:10,306 --> 01:31:14,894
Look, l have to meet somebody,
l'll be back in a couple of minutes.

1116
01:31:14,934 --> 01:31:20,565
l can take you to a place where you can
radio your parents and tell them you're safe.

1117
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:22,817
- Couple of minutes.
- l know l'm safe.

1118
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:25,069
lt's my wife l'm worried about.

1119
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:27,821
You mind if l ask you a question?

1120
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:30,199
Certainly. Go ahead.

1121
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,159
- How do you feel about the coup?
- Verry good.

1122
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:38,414
l've been in a lot of...
frustrating situations before this.

1123
01:31:38,456 --> 01:31:41,208
l was in Key West
waiting for the Bay of Pigs.

1124
01:31:41,249 --> 01:31:44,336
l even took an advanced scuba course
for that invasion.

1125
01:31:44,376 --> 01:31:49,674
lf Kennedy had provided decent air cover,
proper militay support there,

1126
01:31:49,714 --> 01:31:52,051
we wouldn't be having these problems here.

1127
01:31:52,093 --> 01:31:54,887
'''We arrived
at the home of Paul Baker,

1128
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:57,472
'''where Naval Mission radio was installed.'''

1129
01:31:57,514 --> 01:32:02,101
Yeah, we received a cable
through Panama on September 14th.

1130
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:06,188
''After radioing Dad,
Patrick offered to arrange a ride to Santiago

1131
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,065
''with Captain Ray Tower, USN,

1132
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:11,234
''who's returning there
with Herbert Porterfield.''

1133
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,528
And the next day they came back?

1134
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:17,698
Yeah. ''Checked out of hotel,
and Patrick drove us to his house

1135
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:20,617
''for 'going away' barbecue.''

1136
01:32:20,658 --> 01:32:24,829
You're welcome to stay. We have a room,
if the hotel's too expensive.

1137
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:27,582
That's verry nice of you, but thanks anmay.

1138
01:32:27,623 --> 01:32:30,334
- We have a Ping-Pong table too.
- Ping-Pong?

1139
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:32,461
- Yes.
- No, thanks.

1140
01:32:33,795 --> 01:32:36,464
So are you guys friendly
with the local militay?

1141
01:32:36,505 --> 01:32:41,552
Some. l took Admiral Huidobro
to the United States to buy arms last July.

1142
01:32:41,593 --> 01:32:46,765
Militay's all right but the truck drivers
are the real heroes of this thing.

1143
01:32:46,806 --> 01:32:49,559
They wanna talk to Babcock again.

1144
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:54,063
'''They considered us automatic allies
in anything the US might do.'''

1145
01:32:54,104 --> 01:32:56,774
He had to be a hamburger
to miss with a rocket.

1146
01:32:56,815 --> 01:33:01,111
- Charlie, you determined to go back?
- Mm-hm.

1147
01:33:01,153 --> 01:33:03,822
You know about the rebels?

1148
01:33:03,863 --> 01:33:07,033
Ray Tower is number two on their hit list.

1149
01:33:08,075 --> 01:33:10,160
l wouldn't ride with him.

1150
01:33:10,202 --> 01:33:12,704
l wanna see my wife. Thanks, anmay.

1151
01:33:16,874 --> 01:33:19,418
- Hello, Ray.
- Hi, Pat.

1152
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:23,464
Well, here's your chauffeur.
Ray Tower, Charlie Horman.

1153
01:33:23,504 --> 01:33:25,591
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

1154
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:29,636
So the boss of Milgroup
and the senior political officer

1155
01:33:29,676 --> 01:33:33,556
both happened to be in Viña
when the coup started.

1156
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:38,393
''We came to do a job and it's done.''
What did Babcock mean by that?

1157
01:33:38,435 --> 01:33:41,730
Most people think the coup
was prepared in Viña.

1158
01:33:42,814 --> 01:33:45,483
Now, if we weren't involved in the coup

1159
01:33:45,525 --> 01:33:49,445
whatever Charlie saw or heard down there
is meaningless.

1160
01:33:49,485 --> 01:33:52,405
But if we were, it still doesn't mean much

1161
01:33:52,446 --> 01:33:55,074
but it could be significant.

1162
01:33:55,116 --> 01:33:58,411
At least enough for somebody
to take a look at his jacket.

1163
01:33:58,452 --> 01:34:00,829
- His what?
- His record.

1164
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:05,083
They keep a file on everry American national
living down here.

1165
01:34:05,124 --> 01:34:09,837
Somebody decided to review that file
and found that Charlie worked for FIN.

1166
01:34:09,879 --> 01:34:13,424
They might conclude
that he was well worth watching.

1167
01:34:13,464 --> 01:34:15,884
Do you think that's what happened?

1168
01:34:15,926 --> 01:34:18,053
lt seems possible.

1169
01:34:23,307 --> 01:34:25,810
Doesn't look so good, does it?

1170
01:34:30,313 --> 01:34:33,483
OK, this gentleman
is gonna take us through.

1171
01:34:36,526 --> 01:34:38,612
Por acá.

1172
01:34:39,947 --> 01:34:43,241
- Hace mucho frío ahí abajo.
- Sí.

1173
01:34:43,283 --> 01:34:47,870
He says it's quite cold down here.
You better put on your sweater.

1174
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:55,627
l think you should wait upstairs.

1175
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:58,088
Todos ellos han sido identificados.

1176
01:34:58,128 --> 01:35:00,381
These have all been identified.

1177
01:35:00,422 --> 01:35:02,508
Vengan por acá.

1178
01:35:09,139 --> 01:35:13,059
Vengan, vengan.
Esos también han sido identificados.

1179
01:35:14,101 --> 01:35:17,021
These have all been identified as well.

1180
01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:28,614
Estos también han sido identificados.

1181
01:35:29,697 --> 01:35:31,784
These too, all identified.

1182
01:35:35,203 --> 01:35:37,914
Estos no han sido identificados.

1183
01:35:39,664 --> 01:35:43,252
The identities of these
have yet to be determined.

1184
01:36:23,828 --> 01:36:25,705
Ed?

1185
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,340
Who is he?

1186
01:36:38,132 --> 01:36:39,759
Frank Teruggi.

1187
01:36:41,094 --> 01:36:43,346
Jesus Christ almighty!

1188
01:36:43,386 --> 01:36:45,723
Come on. Let's get her outta here.

1189
01:36:45,763 --> 01:36:50,560
Get off me. l'm not leaving here
until l've looked for my husband.

1190
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:53,771
- Ed, give me a hand.
- You heard what she said.

1191
01:37:05,115 --> 01:37:10,286
Señores, por favor, quiero respuestas.

1192
01:37:10,328 --> 01:37:15,749
Por qué el cuerpo...?

1193
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:20,628
Why wasn't the body discovered until now?
What took so long?

1194
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:24,215
Por qué tardaron tanto
en descubrir el cadáver?

1195
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,971
What kind of world is this?

1196
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,975
You sound just like Charlie.

1197
01:37:43,398 --> 01:37:45,275
OK.

1198
01:37:46,024 --> 01:37:49,737
lt appears that Mr Teruggi was picked up
for a curfew violation

1199
01:37:49,778 --> 01:37:53,490
and detained at the stadium
and then released.

1200
01:37:53,531 --> 01:37:57,869
Then the carabineros found him
Iater that night, dead on the street.

1201
01:37:57,911 --> 01:38:02,081
Why did the State Department
tell me that he'd left the county?

1202
01:38:02,123 --> 01:38:07,669
l... Most likely some screw-up
at local immigration.

1203
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:15,259
Phil, l'm not gonna leave this county
until l find my son, alive or dead.

1204
01:38:15,926 --> 01:38:18,220
What? No, it's just that...

1205
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:23,975
everry new turn seems to lead us right back
to the beginning, you know?

1206
01:38:24,017 --> 01:38:26,102
Like we're going in circles.

1207
01:38:27,019 --> 01:38:29,104
We're going in circles!

1208
01:38:29,146 --> 01:38:33,858
Elizabeth! Can you...? Oh, yeah. OK.
That's better, dear.

1209
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:36,611
What? No! l'm fine.

1210
01:38:36,653 --> 01:38:38,946
l'm just pooped, that's all.

1211
01:38:40,029 --> 01:38:42,449
Beth? Yeah, she's all right.

1212
01:38:43,491 --> 01:38:45,243
What?

1213
01:38:45,284 --> 01:38:48,371
Yes. Yes, dear, l will. And you too.

1214
01:38:49,871 --> 01:38:52,041
God bless you, Liz.

1215
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:21,859
Earthquake.

1216
01:39:28,363 --> 01:39:31,033
Ed, not the elevator!

1217
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:42,501
Don't stay in the windows.
It's dangerous!

1218
01:39:42,543 --> 01:39:46,296
Señores, no se queden
en las ventanas, es peligroso.

1219
01:39:46,338 --> 01:39:50,133
- Don't stay in the window. It's dangerous.

1220
01:39:50,174 --> 01:39:54,846
Be calm. The hotel is earthquake-proof.
No need for alarm!

1221
01:39:56,388 --> 01:39:58,807
You can't go outside. It's curfew!

1222
01:39:59,975 --> 01:40:03,853
Hey, you! Don't go out!
Curfew! Please, don't.

1223
01:40:05,146 --> 01:40:07,523
- Go back to your...

1224
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:19,951
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, go back to your rooms.

1225
01:40:19,992 --> 01:40:22,536
There is no more danger.

1226
01:40:22,577 --> 01:40:24,455
Vuelvan a las habitaciones,
no hay peligro ya.

1227
01:40:24,495 --> 01:40:27,749
- l'm sorry.
- It's all right. l don't mind.

1228
01:40:31,544 --> 01:40:33,629
You wanna go up?

1229
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:35,756
l'm still tying to come down.

1230
01:40:35,797 --> 01:40:39,760
Beth, how about a drink, hm?

1231
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:42,053
- Help you sleep.
- But not in the bar.

1232
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,187
Thank you.

1233
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:55,482
- A la vida.
- A la v...

1234
01:40:55,523 --> 01:40:58,526
To life. Charlie and l always say that.

1235
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:05,157
Now...

1236
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:10,119
- l owe you an apology.
- No, you don't.

1237
01:41:11,954 --> 01:41:15,332
For a long time now, l've sold you short,

1238
01:41:15,958 --> 01:41:17,834
both of you.

1239
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:21,337
l don't really know why,
unless it's because l'm getting old.

1240
01:41:21,379 --> 01:41:23,464
And l'm verry stubborn.

1241
01:41:24,549 --> 01:41:26,634
Why don't you sit over here?

1242
01:41:34,348 --> 01:41:36,767
This past week, l've felt like...

1243
01:41:38,518 --> 01:41:41,313
my heart has just been torn out of me.

1244
01:41:42,314 --> 01:41:44,191
lt's OK.

1245
01:41:46,942 --> 01:41:49,028
l feel verry guilty.

1246
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:51,155
Charlie always says guilt is like fear,

1247
01:41:51,196 --> 01:41:54,616
it's given to us for survival,
not destruction.

1248
01:41:59,871 --> 01:42:04,208
Beth, you're one of the most courageous
people l have ever met.

1249
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:07,002
l mean it.

1250
01:42:10,879 --> 01:42:12,757
Thank you.

1251
01:42:17,969 --> 01:42:20,055
You think he's dead?

1252
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:26,561
l don't know.

1253
01:42:26,601 --> 01:42:28,854
No. No, l don't...

1254
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:31,857
think he's dead.

1255
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:35,527
But that's not how you really feel, is it?

1256
01:42:37,945 --> 01:42:41,157
- l spoke to Elizabeth tonight.
- And?

1257
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:45,285
She was speaking again with some people
from the Ford Foundation.

1258
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:50,373
They think we should contact Peter Cooke.
He runs their office here.

1259
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,875
Do you mind if l skip that one?

1260
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,877
No.

1261
01:42:57,296 --> 01:43:00,549
You kids love each other
verry much, don't you?

1262
01:43:04,469 --> 01:43:09,098
l'm verry sorry, sir, but Mr Cooke
is out of the county until Monday.

1263
01:43:09,138 --> 01:43:12,351
- Oh...
- Can l be of some help?

1264
01:43:12,391 --> 01:43:15,937
Well, l was just paying a courtesy call
on Mr Cooke.

1265
01:43:15,979 --> 01:43:18,481
You're Mr Horman, aren't you?

1266
01:43:19,522 --> 01:43:24,278
Erm, why don't you come inside
and we can talk for a while?

1267
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:27,447
- Well, l...
- Mr Horman, please come in.

1268
01:43:33,828 --> 01:43:38,165
Hi, l'm Peter Chernin.
l'm an economic advisor with the foundation.

1269
01:43:38,205 --> 01:43:40,750
Would you come with me for a moment?

1270
01:43:47,173 --> 01:43:49,258
Please, take a seat.

1271
01:44:03,436 --> 01:44:05,689
l have a friend l play golf with.

1272
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:11,694
l won't identify him, but he works
for an English-speaking embassy here,

1273
01:44:11,734 --> 01:44:16,406
and he's close to someone who has
good contacts with the militay.

1274
01:44:17,449 --> 01:44:22,662
He thinks your son was executed
in the national stadium on September 19th.

1275
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,169
That was nearly a month ago.

1276
01:44:31,211 --> 01:44:33,087
Yes, sir.

1277
01:44:38,217 --> 01:44:40,302
Could l...

1278
01:44:41,386 --> 01:44:44,097
speak to your friend or his contact?

1279
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:48,476
No, l'm afraid not.
These are verry dangerous times.

1280
01:44:48,516 --> 01:44:50,769
l'll go anmhere, in any way.

1281
01:44:50,811 --> 01:44:54,231
You can tie my hands.
You can blindfold me. You can...

1282
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:57,692
l'm sorry. l am sorry, but l can't do that.

1283
01:45:09,494 --> 01:45:12,330
l probably shouldn't even have told you.

1284
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:18,043
This is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

1285
01:45:20,461 --> 01:45:22,547
Just give me a name.

1286
01:45:23,505 --> 01:45:25,299
Please.

1287
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:27,218
Just...

1288
01:45:35,892 --> 01:45:38,144
That's all right. l understand.

1289
01:45:39,603 --> 01:45:41,689
Thank you for telling me.

1290
01:46:10,504 --> 01:46:14,592
Ed. Ed. The ambassador is waiting for you
in the ballroom.

1291
01:46:15,759 --> 01:46:19,346
We've been tying to reach you.
We may have some good news.

1292
01:46:19,388 --> 01:46:21,473
What would that be?

1293
01:46:21,515 --> 01:46:26,102
That my son was executed in the stadium
three days after his arrest?

1294
01:46:26,143 --> 01:46:28,730
Wait. Who told you that? Ed, wait.

1295
01:46:29,814 --> 01:46:32,066
Ah, good, Consul, you found him.

1296
01:46:32,108 --> 01:46:34,610
Mr Horman, this is Mr Samuel Cross.

1297
01:46:35,776 --> 01:46:39,322
Gentlemen, perhaps we'd be
more comfortable over here.

1298
01:46:39,364 --> 01:46:44,327
Mr Cross is a journalist with good access
to left-wing circles down here

1299
01:46:44,368 --> 01:46:48,705
and he's dug up some
interesting information about your son.

1300
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:53,168
l believe that your son's alive and well,
Mr Horman.

1301
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:57,421
Captain Tower asked me to make inquiries
about Charles's whereabouts.

1302
01:46:57,462 --> 01:47:01,258
l spoke with a guy who's helping
political refugees escape.

1303
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:06,346
His organisation has secured credentials
for three Americans to leave Santiago.

1304
01:47:06,387 --> 01:47:08,472
One of them was your son.

1305
01:47:09,889 --> 01:47:12,267
- Where is he?
- He's in the north.

1306
01:47:12,308 --> 01:47:16,271
He should be out of the county
sometime next week.

1307
01:47:16,312 --> 01:47:18,356
Can l contact him?

1308
01:47:18,397 --> 01:47:22,193
l'm afraid you can't. But l'll lay odds
he's home in New York before...

1309
01:47:22,234 --> 01:47:24,737
Will you please get him out of here?

1310
01:47:24,777 --> 01:47:28,740
Now, l said ''please''.
l wanna speak to the two of you alone.

1311
01:47:28,781 --> 01:47:32,702
Mr Cross, thank you.
Mr Horman has new information

1312
01:47:32,744 --> 01:47:34,829
and l'll check it out right away.

1313
01:47:34,869 --> 01:47:37,373
Yes, you do that. You call General Lutz.

1314
01:47:40,332 --> 01:47:43,044
l believe my son was killed by the militay.

1315
01:47:43,086 --> 01:47:46,797
- Where'd you hear that?
- l do not think they would dare do that

1316
01:47:46,839 --> 01:47:49,800
unless an American official
co-signed a kill order.

1317
01:47:49,841 --> 01:47:54,971
That's a hell of a statement considering
we're here to protect American citizens.

1318
01:47:55,012 --> 01:47:59,684
This mission has done everrything
humanly possible to locate your son.

1319
01:47:59,725 --> 01:48:02,895
l think you knew
he was dead from the start.

1320
01:48:02,937 --> 01:48:05,272
lf we knew, why wouldn't we tell you?

1321
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:09,150
- l don't know but l'll find out.
- Why would we want him dead?

1322
01:48:09,192 --> 01:48:11,903
Because he knew
of our involvement in the coup.

1323
01:48:11,944 --> 01:48:15,698
We're not involved.
Our position has been completely neutral.

1324
01:48:15,738 --> 01:48:17,991
That is a bald-faced lie!

1325
01:48:18,032 --> 01:48:21,995
How can you say a thing like that
when you have army colonels,

1326
01:48:22,035 --> 01:48:26,040
- naval engineers, all over Viña del Mar?
- Please, sit down.

1327
01:48:26,081 --> 01:48:29,376
lt's obvious you're harbouring
some misconception

1328
01:48:29,417 --> 01:48:33,129
- regarding our role here.
- What is your role here...

1329
01:48:33,171 --> 01:48:37,049
besides endorsing a regime
that murders thousands of human beings?

1330
01:48:37,091 --> 01:48:38,759
Let's level with each other.

1331
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,888
lf you hadn't been involved
in this unfortunate incident

1332
01:48:42,929 --> 01:48:48,351
you'd be sitting at home complacent
and more or less oblivious to all of this.

1333
01:48:52,353 --> 01:48:56,108
This mission is pledged
to protect American interests.

1334
01:48:56,149 --> 01:48:58,360
Well, they're not mine.

1335
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:02,113
There are over 3,OOO US firms
doing business down here,

1336
01:49:02,155 --> 01:49:04,949
and those are American interests.

1337
01:49:04,989 --> 01:49:07,242
ln other words, your interests.

1338
01:49:08,452 --> 01:49:11,830
l'm concerned with the preservation
of a way of life.

1339
01:49:11,870 --> 01:49:13,957
And a damn good one.

1340
01:49:15,458 --> 01:49:18,669
Maybe that's why there's nobody out there.

1341
01:49:22,338 --> 01:49:24,424
You can't have it both ways.

1342
01:49:33,432 --> 01:49:36,726
l don't know what happened to your kid, Ed,

1343
01:49:36,768 --> 01:49:41,564
but l understand he was a bit of a snoop.

1344
01:49:42,355 --> 01:49:47,027
He poked his nose in dangerous places
where he really didn't belong.

1345
01:49:47,069 --> 01:49:49,571
Now, suppose...

1346
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,573
l went up to your town, New York,

1347
01:49:52,614 --> 01:49:56,243
and l started messing
around with the Mafia.

1348
01:49:56,285 --> 01:49:58,829
l wind up dead in the East River.

1349
01:49:58,870 --> 01:50:01,540
And my wife, or my father,

1350
01:50:01,581 --> 01:50:06,002
complains to the police
because they didn't protect me.

1351
01:50:07,085 --> 01:50:10,547
They really wouldn't have much of a case,
would they?

1352
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:14,509
You play with fire, you get burned.

1353
01:50:42,658 --> 01:50:44,869
Just a minute. What's going on?

1354
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:47,580
They wanna ask questions about Charlie.

1355
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:50,040
- Who are you?
- l'm Inspector Rojas.

1356
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:52,667
l am taking Mrs Horman to headquarters.

1357
01:50:52,709 --> 01:50:55,211
- For what?
- Interrogation.

1358
01:50:55,252 --> 01:50:57,338
She's not going anmhere.

1359
01:50:58,839 --> 01:51:00,925
- Ed?
- Wait a minute.

1360
01:51:03,801 --> 01:51:06,471
Get me the American consulate, please.

1361
01:51:06,512 --> 01:51:08,932
ls everrything all right?

1362
01:51:08,972 --> 01:51:12,726
- Ed, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing, dear.

1363
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:17,105
l'd like to speak to Consul Putnam.
This is Ed Horman calling.

1364
01:51:17,146 --> 01:51:20,066
What'd they say at the Ford Foundation?

1365
01:51:21,525 --> 01:51:25,279
- Consul, there's a... What's your name?
- Inspector Rojas.

1366
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,448
An Inspector Rojas here, and he...

1367
01:51:28,489 --> 01:51:31,660
Oh, just a minute. He wants to speak to you.

1368
01:51:33,994 --> 01:51:36,080
Yes, Consul Putnam?

1369
01:51:36,997 --> 01:51:39,208
Oh, l understand.

1370
01:51:39,248 --> 01:51:40,876
Certainly.

1371
01:51:41,959 --> 01:51:43,962
l will do as you say.

1372
01:51:44,004 --> 01:51:46,089
Fine, sir. Thank you.

1373
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,259
Yes?

1374
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,177
Why?

1375
01:51:52,928 --> 01:51:56,348
Yes, all right. But if l have any trouble with...

1376
01:51:57,515 --> 01:52:00,268
l said, ''All right''. l'm going with you.

1377
01:52:02,227 --> 01:52:07,524
- Name of missing person?
- l've answered this a thousand times.

1378
01:52:07,566 --> 01:52:11,736
- Name of missing person, please.
- Charles Horman.

1379
01:52:12,486 --> 01:52:14,530
Date of disappearance?

1380
01:52:14,571 --> 01:52:16,657
September 16th.

1381
01:52:18,825 --> 01:52:21,828
- Time of disappearance?
- l'm not sure.

1382
01:52:21,869 --> 01:52:25,498
He was arrested that afternoon.
l don't know when.

1383
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:29,627
- Time unknown.
- Hay una Ilamada para el señor Horman.

1384
01:52:29,668 --> 01:52:31,754
You have a call, sir.

1385
01:52:33,295 --> 01:52:35,382
l'll be right back.

1386
01:52:36,465 --> 01:52:39,510
Place of birth?
New York.

1387
01:52:40,468 --> 01:52:42,555
ln this room.

1388
01:52:49,893 --> 01:52:51,771
Hello?

1389
01:52:51,812 --> 01:52:56,150
l looked into that, Ed,
and it appears that you were right.

1390
01:52:57,776 --> 01:53:01,237
We've been informed that the body
has been identified

1391
01:53:01,278 --> 01:53:03,948
through a recheck of morgue fingerprints.

1392
01:53:05,908 --> 01:53:08,118
Positive identification?

1393
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:10,370
'Yes, absolutely...

1394
01:53:10,412 --> 01:53:12,539
'positive. They found him.

1395
01:53:13,706 --> 01:53:17,001
'He was...buried in a wall.'

1396
01:53:18,084 --> 01:53:21,255
ln a wall? l don't understand.

1397
01:53:22,213 --> 01:53:25,425
They do that. It's quite common down here.

1398
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:35,309
W-Was he killed in the stadium?

1399
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:38,562
- 'lt looks that way.'
- l see.

1400
01:53:41,564 --> 01:53:43,441
Goodbye.

1401
01:54:12,633 --> 01:54:15,218
His political affiliation?

1402
01:54:20,265 --> 01:54:22,350
Please, Mrs Horman.

1403
01:54:26,145 --> 01:54:28,230
We're going home.

1404
01:54:30,649 --> 01:54:32,650
l love you, Ed.

1405
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:50,802
l want you to contact the militay.

1406
01:55:50,843 --> 01:55:55,472
l want you to demand all Charles'
personal effects stolen from this house.

1407
01:55:55,513 --> 01:55:58,850
- That's not verry realistic.
- Every drawing, everry notebook,

1408
01:55:58,891 --> 01:56:01,144
everry article my son wrote or had.

1409
01:56:01,186 --> 01:56:03,813
- Ed, l can't go to the...
- Do it!

1410
01:56:03,854 --> 01:56:06,941
l don't care whether it's a cinch
or difficult as hell.

1411
01:56:06,981 --> 01:56:09,901
- l want it done.
- l'll ty.

1412
01:56:12,069 --> 01:56:14,155
Right here, please.

1413
01:56:15,948 --> 01:56:18,159
- Good. That takes care of it.
- That's it?

1414
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:19,868
- Yes.
- OK.

1415
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:21,995
When will he be sent home?

1416
01:56:22,037 --> 01:56:24,581
Erm, l'd say a few days.

1417
01:56:24,622 --> 01:56:28,835
We've got to get some other clearances.
Nothing important.

1418
01:56:28,875 --> 01:56:31,003
We should ship him home by Friday.

1419
01:56:31,044 --> 01:56:33,881
- You're sure?
- You've got my word on it.

1420
01:56:37,842 --> 01:56:41,179
Wait, there's just one more thing. Just one.

1421
01:56:41,219 --> 01:56:43,806
Did you mention the shipping charges?

1422
01:56:43,848 --> 01:56:47,684
No, l didn't. There's going to be
some sort of a fee

1423
01:56:47,725 --> 01:56:49,853
in addition to the air freight duty.

1424
01:56:49,894 --> 01:56:51,813
How much?

1425
01:56:51,854 --> 01:56:56,067
- Do you have the exact...?
- It comes to $931 .1 4.

1426
01:56:57,192 --> 01:57:02,197
That includes the freight
and the taxes as well, of course.

1427
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:04,324
You mean you want it now?

1428
01:57:07,409 --> 01:57:09,912
No, l don't think that's necessay.

1429
01:57:10,828 --> 01:57:14,416
- When the body arrives...
- We'll take care of it.

1430
01:57:14,458 --> 01:57:17,877
- Good. Let me get this.
- l wanna get rid of the money.

1431
01:57:17,918 --> 01:57:19,796
OK.

1432
01:57:27,928 --> 01:57:31,347
- 'Departure to New York...'
- Beth! Mr Horman!

1433
01:57:31,388 --> 01:57:35,726
Hello. We called your room this morning.
You'd already checked out.

1434
01:57:35,767 --> 01:57:39,438
l tried to leave you a message.
l'm on my way to La Paz.

1435
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:42,816
Bolivia. That's where Babcock said
he was going next.

1436
01:57:42,856 --> 01:57:44,525
Now that you mention it, yes.

1437
01:57:44,567 --> 01:57:47,153
Miss Newman, thank you for your help.

1438
01:57:47,193 --> 01:57:49,905
l'm terribly sorry. Beth...

1439
01:57:50,739 --> 01:57:54,034
- You have a good flight.
- Take care, both of you.

1440
01:57:54,075 --> 01:57:58,496
- Beth.
- Beth, no more special privileges.

1441
01:57:59,914 --> 01:58:03,333
l wish there was something
we could say or do here.

1442
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:05,836
There's something l'm gonna do.

1443
01:58:05,876 --> 01:58:07,921
l'm gonna sue you, Phil,

1444
01:58:07,961 --> 01:58:11,966
and Tower and the ambassador,
everybody who let him die.

1445
01:58:12,007 --> 01:58:14,593
We'll make it verry hot for you.

1446
01:58:14,635 --> 01:58:18,305
- l guess that's your privilege.
- No, that's my right.

1447
01:58:18,345 --> 01:58:23,768
l just thank God that we live in a county
where we can put people like you in jail.

1448
01:58:46,745 --> 01:58:50,583
'Ed Horman filed suit
