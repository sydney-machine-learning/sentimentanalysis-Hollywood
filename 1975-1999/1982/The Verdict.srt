1
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,807
Mrs Dee, this is Frank Galvin.

2
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,488
He`s a good friend of ours,
and a very fine attorney.

3
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:14,969
Well, it`s just a shame what happened
to your husband, Mrs Dee. He was a...

4
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:19,410
l knew him vaguely at the Lodge.
He was a wonderful man.

5
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:22,883
lt was a crime what happened to him.
lt was just a crime.

6
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:26,363
lf l can help in any way,

7
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:31,761
don`t hesitate to call.

8
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,404
Well...

9
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,243
lf this can help in any way...

10
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:38,527
What is that?

11
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,924
lt`s my card.

12
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,962
What the hell is that?

13
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:50,442
l was a friend of your father`s.

14
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:55,053
You never knew my father.

15
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,687
Get out of here.

16
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:06,083
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Excuse me, Mrs Cleary.

17
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:09,521
Who the hell do you think you are?!

18
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:18,288
- Hey, you know me.
- l don`t want you coming back here ever!

19
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,887
- You understand?
- l was just talking to the guy!

20
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,567
Those are bereaved people in there!

21
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,808
So Pat says... He says ``They got this new bar,

22
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:03,681
and you go inside, and for half a buck
you get a beer, a free lunch,

23
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:06,207
they take you in the back room
and get you laid.``

24
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:09,012
- Another one, Frankie?
- Yeah. Everyone.

25
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:12,244
Mike says ``Now wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.``

26
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,245
``There`s a new bar, and you go inside,
and for half a buck

27
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,769
they give you a beer,
a free lunch and they get you laid?``

28
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:22,129
Pat says ``That`s right.``
``Have you ever been in the bar?``

29
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,602
He said ``No, but me sister has.``

30
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,923
Hey!

31
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,091
Oh, yeah. Everyone.

32
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,568
Frankie?

33
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:26,487
Frankie! Frankie, you all right?

34
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:33,523
Oh, Frankie.

35
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:37,001
Come on, get up.

36
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:39,891
Get up, Frank! Oh, Christ.

37
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,562
What the hell`s goin` on here?

38
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,482
What have you been doin`?

39
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:26,523
l got a call from Sally Doneghy.

40
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,332
Who`s that?

41
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:32,803
You`re in court in ten days,
and you haven`t even met with them yet.

42
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:35,202
Sally Doneghy? Who is that?

43
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:37,682
One lousy letter in 18 months.

44
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:42,130
l try to throw a case your way, and look at ya.

45
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,124
Frankie,

46
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:48,602
l got these people to trust you.

47
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:52,809
They`re gonna be here at noon,
by the way, and look at this shit.

48
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:56,922
l got this expert doctor to talk to ya.

49
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,961
Remember his name? Dr Gruber?

50
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,770
lt`s been 18 months, and l`ve been
doin` all the fuckin` legwork.

51
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:07,287
You`re due in court in less than two weeks,

52
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:10,285
and l bet you haven`t even
looked at the goddamn file.

53
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,046
What are you, my nanny?

54
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,488
Now listen to me, Frankie.

55
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:20,248
Frankie, listen to me,
cos l`m done fuckin` with ya.

56
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,086
l can`t take this any more.

57
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:26,006
l mean, you`re not gonna change.

58
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:28,846
Look around ya.
l mean, what`s gonna change?

59
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:32,323
You think it`s gonna be any different
next week, next month?

60
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:35,052
lt`s gonna be the same goddamn thing.

61
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,521
Now l got you a good case.

62
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:42,081
lt`s a moneymaker.

63
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:45,006
You do it right, it`ll take care of ya.

64
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:48,452
But l`m through, you understand?

65
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:51,965
l mean, l can`t take this shit any more.

66
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,127
Life`s too fuckin` short, Frankie.

67
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,122
l`m gettin` too fuckin` old.

68
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,922
Fuck!

69
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:17,642
Excuse me, sir.

70
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,522
Mrs Doneghy. Hi. Frank Galvin.

71
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,364
- Why didn`t you go in?
- lt`s locked.

72
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,648
Locked?

73
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:07,764
l`m sorry.

74
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,845
God, l hope this didn`t put you out.

75
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:14,402
Let me see here...

76
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:23,085
Come on in. l`d get you a cup of coffee,
but looks as though my girl went out.

77
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:27,645
lt`s not a good case, it`s a very good case.

78
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:33,003
A young, healthy woman goes into a hospital
to deliver her third child, and...

79
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:37,245
Well, it`s just beyond comprehension.
She`s given the wrong anaesthetic.

80
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,530
- We love her, Kevin and me.
- l`m sure you do.

81
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:43,605
But what can we do?
She don`t know who`s visiting her.

82
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,964
l know. l went.

83
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,451
- You saw her?
- Oh, yes.

84
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,889
My sister? You know how beautiful she was?

85
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:58,091
Her husband left her, and he took her kids.

86
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:01,568
They...

87
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,767
they let you die in there.

88
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:07,731
They don`t care. Nobody cares.

89
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:12,402
The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care
in Arlington? They`d take her in.

90
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:16,288
Perpetual care.
$50,000 they want in endowment.

91
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,323
50,000?

92
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,527
l don`t wanna leave her. Kevin, he...

93
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:28,129
And Father Laughlin,
he said it was God`s will.

94
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,204
Well, l understand.

95
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:33,842
My doctor told me l gotta move out West.
That`s when we filed in court.

96
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:36,527
- We didn`t wanna sue.
- Oh, l understand that too.

97
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,922
But Kevin`s looking for two years in Tucson.

98
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:42,449
They called him up
and they said to come out.

99
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,366
He`s a good man.
He`s only trying to do what`s right.

100
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,727
Come on in.

101
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,202
This is my husband.

102
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:56,887
Come on in. Sit down.

103
00:13:56,973 --> 00:14:02,650
l told your wife, l`m sorry we have to meet
out here, but l got a case in superior court.

104
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,805
- The place is full of papers.
- That`s all right.

105
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:09,852
- l was also telling her you got a good case.
- He saw her at Northern Care.

106
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,767
l may get some very important
corroborating testimony from a Dr Gruber.

107
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,768
lt`ll be a problem getting one doctor to testify
that another doctor`s negligent, but...

108
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:24,052
The archdiocese called and said who was
our attorney, cos the case is coming to trial.

109
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:28,046
Well... l doubt very much
that the case will ever come to trial.

110
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:33,963
We told them we didn`t want it
to come out this way.

111
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,772
l completely understand.

112
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,686
- See, we just...
- We just can`t do it any more.

113
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,764
This is our chance to get away.

114
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:45,086
l`m gonna see that you get that chance.

115
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,209
How much is this gonna cost?

116
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:50,808
lt`s not gonna cost you anything.
lt`s done on a contingency basis.

117
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:53,282
Whatever the settlement is, l retain a third.

118
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,888
But that`s normal procedure.
You can check around.

119
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,081
OK?

120
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,487
OK.

121
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:07,528
His name is Frank Galvin. Boston College,
class of `52, was second in his class.

122
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,529
Editor of the Law Review.
Worked with Mickey Morrissey 12 years.

123
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:16,482
Criminal law and personal injury.
Married Patricia Harrington, 1960.

124
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:20,691
Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce,
1960, as a full partner.

125
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:24,163
Resigned the firm, 1969,
over the Lillibridge case.

126
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:28,724
- He was accused ofjury-tampering.
- Accused, not indicted. He resigned the firm.

127
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:34,282
Divorced, 1970. Galvin worked with Michael
Morrissey until Morrissey retired in `78.

128
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:39,128
Since then he`s been on his own. Four cases
in three years. He`s lost them all. He drinks.

129
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,522
Four cases in three years.

130
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,888
The man`s an ambulance chaser.

131
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:46,692
- Tell me about this case.
- This is a nuisance suit.

132
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:50,527
He`s asking for $600,000
and betting we don`t want to go to court.

133
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:54,765
- No, we don`t want this case in court.
- Neither does he. That`s where he loses.

134
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,289
He`s scared to death to go to court.
We only have to call his bluff.

135
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:02,605
l want to settle and be done with it. l don`t
want the archdiocese exposed, Mr Alito.

136
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:06,003
No. Absolutely.
And we`re going to see that it`s not.

137
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,368
So, what l want to do is stop it here.

138
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:11,729
l`m going to make him an offer myself.
l want it to come from me.

139
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:14,043
All right. But let`s keep the price down.

140
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:18,888
l called Ed Concannon. He recommends we
continue to respond as if we`re going to trial.

141
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:21,767
lf we were to go to trial,
would we win the case?

142
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,287
Well, of course it`s always dangerous.

143
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:27,206
l know that answer. Would we win?

144
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:28,692
Yes.

145
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,892
Dr Gruber?

146
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,282
Yes. Galvin, right?

147
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,683
Well... well, l sure appreciate
a man as busy as you are...

148
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:47,166
lt`s perfectly all right. Look, l`m kinda rushed.
Do you mind if we walk while we talk?

149
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,732
l read the hospital report on your client.

150
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:56,285
Deborah Ann Kaye? They called. They want
to settle. lt`s just a matter ofjacking `em up.

151
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:59,604
- Who called?
- The archdiocese. They wanna settle.

152
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,888
- And you`re gonna do that?
- Yeah.

153
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:04,441
- You`re gonna settle out of court?
- Well, yeah.

154
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,524
Why?

155
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:09,081
ln the interests of her family.
And you, Doctor.

156
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:14,293
You can never tell what ajury`s gonna do.
St Catherine`s is a renowned institution.

157
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:18,252
- Her doctors are...
- Her doctors killed her.

158
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,608
- l`m sorry?
- Her doctors killed her.

159
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:24,447
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic,
and she drowned in her own vomit.

160
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:28,526
- The doctors murdered her.
- Do you know who her doctors were?

161
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:32,970
Yeah, l read the file. Marx and Towler.
l know who they were.

162
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,762
- Two of the most respected...
- l thought you wanted to do something.

163
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:38,923
l`ve no interest in the woman`s estate.

164
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,447
No offence, we all know
where the money is going.

165
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:45,765
l have an interest in hospitals. l don`t want
those bozos in the same profession as me.

166
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:50,563
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic, they
killed her and her kid, and you caught `em.

167
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,211
You want a cigar?

168
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:55,968
No, thank you. The hospital`s
owned by the archdiocese...

169
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:59,045
What are they gonna do?
Not invite me to their birthday party?

170
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:02,728
Look, l`m sorry l`m rushing,
but l have to be in Cambridge.

171
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:05,407
When can we get together again
and get a deposition?

172
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:08,007
OK. We`ll meet here Tuesday night.

173
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:11,529
l gotta go. Are you goin` my way?

174
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:14,605
OK. But we`re gonna have to
keep you under wraps, you know.

175
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,002
- You can`t discuss the case.
- l understand.

176
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:20,768
You`re gonna meet me here on Tuesday.
We`ll go over your testimony.

177
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:23,367
Right. Seven o`clock in the locker rooms.

178
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:26,490
- l got it.
- Thank you.

179
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,962
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

180
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,409
Why are you doin` this?

181
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:36,088
To do the right thing.
lsn`t that why you`re doing it?

182
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:57,608
Sorry. Nobody ever stood here since 1952.

183
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,845
Give me a Bushmill. Who are the civilians?

184
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,812
Lousy weather, good for business,
Frankie. There you go.

185
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,969
- Would you like a drink?
- l`d like an apartment.

186
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,087
Would you settle for a drink?

187
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,482
No. Thank you.

188
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,282
l had a good day today.

189
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,603
Let me at `em.

190
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,092
Gentlemen...

191
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:39,767
- To ya.
- To ya. To ya.

192
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:47,124
l cut myself so badly shaving this morning,
my eyes almost cleared up.

193
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:49,204
Bad?

194
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:59,609
l`m glad you had a good day.

195
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:02,082
- Good night.
- Thank you.

196
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:07,002
Well, well, well, well, well. Hey.

197
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:11,482
lt`s a long road that has no turning.

198
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:13,882
That`s for sure, Frankie.

199
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:23,403
Yeah. l`m going to the archdiocese tomorrow.

200
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:26,323
At two.

201
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:33,566
Yes, l know you don`t. l know you don`t.
You`re just following your own life.

202
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:36,531
You have a life to live too.
You have to go out West.

203
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:39,411
You`re not gonna do yourself good here.

204
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:45,009
Well...

205
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,927
l`m sure she knows that you care for her.

206
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:57,092
- Well...
- She's so unprotected.

207
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:03,168
Finally, we`re none of us protected.
l mean, we just... have to go on,

208
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,483
seek help where we can and go on...

209
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:08,645
She's stuck there.
Maybe she knows when we're there.

210
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:13,409
- Will she think we've abandoned her?
- Yes, l know that you love her.

211
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:16,326
l know that you`re acting out of love.

212
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,973
As soon as l know.

213
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:29,365
- My husband sends his respects.
- Well, you give him my respects, too.

214
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:34,481
- Thank you. Sorry to call so late.
- Not at all. No, not at all.

215
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:39,483
Well...

216
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,972
Good night.

217
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,806
- God bless you, Mr Galvin.
- Well, bless you, too.

218
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:49,088
Good night.

219
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:49,443
``Jimmy`` l said. ``You don`t go
in your pocket if there`s nothing there.``

220
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:52,001
And what did he say?

221
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:54,891
Sir, you`re not allowed to be in here.

222
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:02,762
You can`t be in here.

223
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,202
l`m her attorney.

224
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:16,766
lt`s a question of continuing values.

225
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:20,163
St Catherine`s, to do the good
she must do in the community,

226
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:23,928
must maintain the position
she holds in the community.

227
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:27,926
So... we have a question of balance.

228
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:33,283
On the one hand, our hospital,
its reputation, and so its effectiveness,

229
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:35,933
and that of two of its important doctors.

230
00:24:36,253 --> 00:24:39,643
And on the other hand,
the rights of your client.

231
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:46,084
A young woman in her prime,
deprived of her life, her sight, her family.

232
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,765
lt`s tragic. lt`s a tragic accident.

233
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,849
Nothing, of course,
can begin to make that right.

234
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:59,641
But we must do what we can.
We must do all that we can.

235
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:04,292
Yes, we must try to make it right.

236
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,612
lt`s a generous offer, Mr Galvin.

237
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:18,041
Nothing can begin to make that woman well,
but we could at least try to compensate,

238
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,844
make a gesture.

239
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,282
How did you settle on the amount?

240
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,883
We thought it was just.

241
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:33,043
You thought it was just?

242
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,532
Yes.

243
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:40,685
Because it struck me...

244
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:46,648
how neatly three went into
this figure - 210,000.

245
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,642
That means l would keep 70.

246
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:55,727
That was our insurance company`s
recommendation.

247
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,604
Yes, that would be.

248
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:02,490
Nothing we can do
can make that woman well.

249
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:09,362
And no one will know the truth.

250
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:13,682
What is the truth?

251
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,926
That that poor girl put her trust into the...

252
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,811
the hands of two men who took her life.

253
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:28,081
She`s in a coma.

254
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:32,129
Her life is gone.

255
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,962
She has no home, no family.

256
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:41,882
She`s tied to a machine.

257
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:45,687
She has no friends.

258
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:50,606
And the people who should care for her,

259
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,888
her doctors,

260
00:26:54,693 --> 00:26:56,888
and you and me,

261
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:03,810
have been bought off to look the other way.

262
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:06,930
We`ve been paid to look the other way.

263
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:13,562
l came here to take your money.

264
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:21,486
l brought snapshots to show you
so l could get your money.

265
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:26,522
l can`t do it. l can`t take it.

266
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,927
Because if l take the money, l`m lost.

267
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:36,323
l`ll just be a...

268
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,328
rich...

269
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,608
ambulance chaser.

270
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,122
l can`t do it. l can`t take it.

271
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:55,246
lf we may discuss money, Mr Galvin,

272
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:58,242
how`s your law practice?

273
00:27:59,973 --> 00:28:02,248
Not too good.

274
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:07,642
l only got the one client.

275
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,011
Mick?

276
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:26,408
l gotta talk to you.

277
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:31,371
Mickey, come on. Hey, let`s go get a drink.

278
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:35,162
Hymie, sit in for me, will ya?

279
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:50,886
- Are you out of your mind?
- l need your help.

280
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:54,363
You need my help?
You need a goddamn keeper.

281
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:58,366
Are you telling me
you turned down 210 grand?

282
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:01,684
What are you, nuts? What are you
gonna do, bring her back to life?

283
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,571
- l`m gonna help her.
- To do what?

284
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:08,168
To do what, for Christ`s sakes?
Help her do what? She`s dead!

285
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:13,122
- They killed her. They`re trying to buy it.
- That`s the fuckin` point, dummy!

286
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:17,322
Let them buy it.
No, we let them buy the case.

287
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:21,486
That`s why l took it. Now, look,
you just drop this, you understand?

288
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,529
We`ll go up to New Hampshire.

289
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:25,843
- We`ll kill some fuckin` deer.
- Mick. Mick!

290
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,363
You said... No, listen to me!

291
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:32,412
- You said ``lf not now, when?``
- l know what l said. But not now, all right?

292
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:35,087
l`ll tell you something else.
l can win this case.

293
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,893
But you won, Frank. You won!

294
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,366
When they give you the money,
that means you won.

295
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:43,842
Now, look, we don`t wanna go to court.

296
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,447
ls this getting through to you?

297
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:50,321
Do you know who the attorney
for the archdiocese is? Ed Concannon.

298
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,802
- He`s a good man.
- ``He`s a good man``?

299
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:55,282
He`s the prince of fucking darkness!

300
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,206
He`ll have people testifying
they saw her water-skiing.

301
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:02,764
- Frank, don`t fuck with this case.
- l gotta stand up for that girl.

302
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:06,050
Frank, l know you`re trying
to wipe out some old business.

303
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:09,170
l understand that. l do. But not now.

304
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:14,012
- Call the bishop, will you?
- l`m gonna try this case. Will you help me?

305
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:19,283
l`m gonna need your help, Mick.
Will you help me?

306
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:30,202
Anybody ever hear
``For want of a shoe, a horse was lost``?

307
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:33,892
Who`s going on vacation tomorrow?

308
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:38,445
Friedman? St Barts, is that right?

309
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:39,727
Yes, sir.

310
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:44,011
Send Mrs Friedman a dozen roses
tomorrow morning, please, Sal.

311
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,529
No, wait a minute... Send her a sun lamp.

312
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,967
Friedman, l`m sorry, but you`ll have to stay.

313
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:54,329
There`ll be no vacations
until this thing is cleared.

314
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:59,851
You`re all acquainted with this case.
lt`s been on the calendar for 18 months.

315
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:04,006
Now l think we have a definite court date.

316
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:08,328
February 19th.

317
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:15,605
The plaintiff's attorney is Francis P Galvin.
l trust you`re all familiar with his record.

318
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:20,084
We`ve been expecting him to call us
to negotiate, and as he did not,

319
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:23,290
five days before
we`re supposed to go to court,

320
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:27,002
we made him a rather generous offer,
which he refused.

321
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:32,008
Five days before trial.
What does that mean? l want to find out.

322
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:36,528
Acquaint yourselves again
with the depositions.

323
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:40,572
Don`t rely on the fact that
we did it last year. Do it again.

324
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:43,929
We shall be reviewing it here.
You do it at home.

325
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:46,368
You each have a full file, so know the deps.

326
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:50,366
l want you all to be here when we work
with the defendants. When is that, Billy?

327
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,523
Wednesday evening.

328
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:56,367
l want an article as soon as possible
in The Globe:

329
00:31:56,453 --> 00:32:00,412
``St Cat`s, neighbourhood giant,
serving the community,`` et cetera.

330
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:02,211
They`ve got it in the files.

331
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:06,889
And l want something in the Herald
Monday morning: ``Our gallant doctors.``

332
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:08,884
Be inventive.

333
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:14,605
And television. We`ve gotta have television.
Friedman, since you`re still with us,

334
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:19,403
why don`t you have a word
with your friend at GBH?

335
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:23,770
Now, to belabour the obvious for a moment,

336
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:29,644
our clients are the Archdiocese of Boston,
the St Catherine Labouré Hospital,

337
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:33,806
and Doctors Marx and Towler, two of the
most respected men in their profession.

338
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:38,125
The thrust of this defence will be to answer,

339
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:40,852
in the court, the press, and the public mind,

340
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:45,484
to answer the accusation
of negligence this completely

341
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:49,122
that not only do we win the case,
but win the case so that it is seen

342
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:56,005
that this attack on these men and
this institution was a rank obscenity.

343
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:59,411
OK, let`s get the cobwebs off. Billy?

344
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,327
Please turn to your page four.

345
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:08,282
We`re gonna review the depositions of
the nurse anaesthetist, the scrub nurse,

346
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:11,968
and all those in attendance in the OR
at the time of the operation.

347
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:16,408
- So, what have we got?
- Well, we`ve got her sister.

348
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:21,089
Says Deborah Ann ate a full meal an hour
before she was admitted to the hospital.

349
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:24,563
And we got the admittance form
says she ate nine hours before.

350
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:29,283
The sister`s testimony`s no good.
The jury knows if we win, she gets the cash.

351
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:33,161
We got my Dr Gruber. He says
she was given the wrong anaesthetic.

352
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:35,687
And, anyway, she came in
complaining of nausea.

353
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:39,402
- Well, Gruber`s not bad.
- He`s Dr Kildare. The jury`ll eat him up.

354
00:33:39,493 --> 00:33:42,212
Yeah. But their guy is Towler.

355
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:46,969
He wrote the book: Methodology
and Practice in Anesthesiology.

356
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:51,444
Everybody in that operating room signed
a deposition, from the scrub nurse on up:

357
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:55,208
``All those guys are God.
l saw them walk on water.``

358
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:58,683
They had an obstetric nurse.
Did we get a deposition from her?

359
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,650
No.

360
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:04,362
Maureen Rooney, aged 49, lives in Arlington.
Still works at the hospital.

361
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:07,411
Think you could talk to her,
ask why she ain`t speakin` up?

362
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:08,892
Yeah.

363
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:12,322
- OK. Cases.
- All right.

364
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:16,962
- Smith versus State of Michigan.
- All right.

365
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:19,692
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

366
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:22,571
Hey, you`ve got a good memory, Frankie.

367
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:24,644
l had a good teacher.

368
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:28,487
- McClean versus Urban Transport.
- Right.

369
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,042
Jimmy. Couple of Bushmills.

370
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:40,172
Do me a favour. l`ll buy you a drink tomorrow.

371
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:42,244
What are you doing tonight?

372
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:46,008
l found this new bar, see,
and for half a buck you can...

373
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:48,482
l`m gonna get laid.

374
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:52,888
All right. l`ll be at the office.

375
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:55,965
Just don`t leave your best work in the sheets.

376
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:04,682
These are on me, Frankie.

377
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:17,407
Did you find an apartment?

378
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:20,802
Still looking.

379
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:25,888
l changed my life today. What did you do?

380
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:29,522
Changed my room at the hotel.

381
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:32,047
Why`d you do that?

382
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:34,408
TV didn`t work.

383
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:40,407
What hotel are you staying at?

384
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:42,768
And what are you? A cop?

385
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:45,242
No. l`m a lawyer.

386
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:50,129
- My ex-husband was a lawyer.
- Nice. Wonderful for you.

387
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:54,168
Yes, it was, actually.

388
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:59,246
``lt was, actually``?
Well, how come you called it off?

389
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:03,162
Who says l`m the one that called it off?

390
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:08,886
Well, a brick house says you divorced him.
l`ll put you on your honour.

391
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:13,842
100 bucks against you have dinner
with me tonight. l`ll take your word for it.

392
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:17,606
Come on. Tell me the truth.

393
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:21,563
You can`t lie to me.

394
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:25,488
What`s your name?

395
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:27,685
Laura.

396
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,324
Mine`s Frank.

397
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:33,530
Furthermore, you came back
to see me tonight.

398
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:37,489
What if it wasn`t you
l came back here to see tonight?

399
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:39,962
Well, you got lucky.

400
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,172
Have you eaten yet? Come on.

401
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:47,691
My God, you are some beautiful woman.

402
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,128
The weak.

403
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:02,925
The weak have gotta have
somebody to fight for `em.

404
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,685
Ain`t that the truth?

405
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:08,165
- Want another drink?
- Yeah.

406
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:10,608
- Jimmy!
- Yeah?

407
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:15,087
That`s why the court exists.
The court doesn`t exist to give them justice.

408
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,882
The court exists to give them
a chance atjustice.

409
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,203
Are they gonna get it?

410
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:24,090
They might.

411
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:26,727
They might.

412
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:31,125
See, the jury wants to believe.
l mean, the jury wants to believe.

413
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:34,050
lt is something to see.

414
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:37,330
l gotta go down there tomorrow
and pick out 12 of `em.

415
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:42,771
All of `em, all their lives, think it`s a sham,
it`s rigged, you can`t fight city hall.

416
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:48,209
But when they step into thatjury box,

417
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:51,285
l think you just barely see it in their eyes.

418
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:53,690
``Maybe.``

419
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:56,043
``Maybe.``

420
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,683
Maybe what?

421
00:38:05,773 --> 00:38:08,241
``Maybe l can do something right.``

422
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:15,611
And is that what you`re going to do?

423
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:21,367
ls that what you`re going to do?

424
00:38:24,653 --> 00:38:27,042
That`s what l`m gonna try to do.

425
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,562
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.

426
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,362
- Water? Soda?
- No.

427
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,728
That`s all right.

428
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,004
Beat you, you...!

429
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:47,168
- ls that right?
- Yeah.

430
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:49,448
Oh, my God.

431
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:17,683
- l met him at the club the other night.
- Poor guy.

432
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:23,483
- You`re late, Mr Galvin.
- l know. l`m sorry.

433
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:26,929
- Why is that?
- Well, l just got held up.

434
00:41:27,013 --> 00:41:29,573
- Ed Concannon.
- Oh, hi.

435
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,042
Frank Galvin. We`ve met before.

436
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:36,607
Well... here. Let`s do some business.

437
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:48,123
They tell me no bargain ever was
completed other than quickly,

438
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:51,762
when both parties really care to make a deal.

439
00:41:51,853 --> 00:41:54,413
Have you boys tried to resolve
your difficulties?

440
00:41:54,493 --> 00:41:59,089
Because that certainly would save the
Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.

441
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:01,971
Well, it`s a very complicated case,
Your Honour.

442
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:05,523
Oh, yeah, l`m sure it is, Frank.
But let me tell you something.

443
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:10,084
lf we find it so complex, how the hell do
you think you`ll make ajury understand it?

444
00:42:10,173 --> 00:42:12,448
You see my point?

445
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,093
Now, let`s talk a minute.

446
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:19,729
Frank, what would you and your client
take now, this very minute,

447
00:42:19,813 --> 00:42:22,805
to walk out of here
and let this damn thing drop?

448
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:26,806
My client can`t walk, Your Honour.

449
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:32,807
l know full well she can`t, Frank.

450
00:42:32,893 --> 00:42:37,683
You see the padre on your way out.
He`ll punch your ticket. You follow me?

451
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:40,333
- l`m just trying to help you.
- Your Honour,

452
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:46,090
Bishop Brophy and the archdiocese
have offered the plaintiff $210,000.

453
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:48,882
What?!

454
00:42:48,973 --> 00:42:52,966
My doctors didn`t want a settlement.
They wanted this cleared up in court.

455
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:55,442
They want their vindication.
l agree with them.

456
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,842
But for today the offer stands,

457
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:01,562
before the publicity of a trial begins.

458
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:06,723
For today only. But when l walk out
that door, the offer is withdrawn.

459
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:10,093
Just so long as
you understand that, Mr Galvin.

460
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:12,962
Got to be that way.

461
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,882
We`re going to try the case.

462
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:24,487
That`s it?

463
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:26,325
Oh, come on, guys.

464
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:29,402
Life is too short.

465
00:43:29,493 --> 00:43:33,691
Now, you tell me if you`re playing chicken
or you really mean it.

466
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:43,444
Frank, l don`t think l`m talking out of school,
but l just heard someone offer you 200 grand.

467
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:46,284
Now that`s a lot of money.

468
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,729
And if l may say,
you haven`t got the best of records.

469
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:53,727
Things change.

470
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:55,769
That`s true.

471
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:58,970
Sometimes they change,
and sometimes they don`t.

472
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,490
- l remember when you were disbarred...
- l wasn`t. They dropped the charges.

473
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:08,772
lt seems to me, a fella`s trying to come back,
he`d take this settlement.

474
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:11,128
Get a record for himself.

475
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,727
l myself would take it and run like a thief.

476
00:44:14,893 --> 00:44:17,282
l`m sure you would.

477
00:44:20,173 --> 00:44:21,572
Yeah.

478
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,691
Well, we have the date set.

479
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:29,289
Next Thursday.

480
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:30,931
Good.

481
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:33,481
Well... see you boys in court.

482
00:44:38,293 --> 00:44:40,488
All rise.

483
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:03,089
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

484
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:14,242
- Mr Abraham?
- Abrams.

485
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:18,848
- Mr Abrams, how are you?
- l`m fine.

486
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:24,930
Have you ever been a patient
in St Catherine Labouré Hospital?

487
00:45:25,253 --> 00:45:27,642
Me?! l`m Jewish.

488
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:33,642
- Have you ever been a patient in a hospital?
- Yes.

489
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:35,849
Well, how did they treat you?

490
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,322
l don`t know what you mean.

491
00:45:43,893 --> 00:45:46,282
Been a long time, huh?

492
00:45:46,373 --> 00:45:48,807
l`ll get it back. Don`t worry about me.

493
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:53,128
- Did you get the obstetric nurse?
- Maureen Rooney?

494
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:56,967
l went over to the hospital.
She didn`t wanna talk to me.

495
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:01,490
When l get home tonight, l`ll go back.
Here. Read this.

496
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:05,365
- So what?
- ``So what``? The best is yet to come.

497
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:08,650
Check the TV guide. They got

498
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:12,692
- The Healing Hand. The expert speaks.
- Still gotta take it to ajury.

499
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:16,766
- All l`m sayin` is, they`re getting some help.
- What do you want me to do?

500
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:20,368
Concannon`s gonna try the case his way,
l`m gonna try it my way.

501
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:24,844
You want me to go ``wee wee wee`` all the way
home just cos of stories in newspapers?

502
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:26,844
l`m gonna win this case.

503
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:29,163
John, give me a cigar.

504
00:46:30,573 --> 00:46:32,609
- What day is it?
- Tuesday.

505
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:34,968
l gotta go and meet Gruber.

506
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:38,045
- What`s a box of your best cigars?
- Macanudos.

507
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:42,923
Then l gotta meet somebody at O`Rourke`s.
Could you meet her for me? Laura Fischer.

508
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:45,288
- 33 bucks.
- Put it on the tab.

509
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:47,887
- The one from the other night?
- Yeah.

510
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:50,931
See you at the office tomorrow.
We`re doin` fine.

511
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:53,648
Hey, Galvin!

512
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:57,562
You said that you were gonna call me up.

513
00:46:57,653 --> 00:46:59,848
You didn`t call me up.

514
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:02,527
Well, who do you think you are?

515
00:47:08,653 --> 00:47:10,848
Who do you think you are?

516
00:47:13,013 --> 00:47:17,006
They tell me l can have you disbarred.
Do you know what you did?

517
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:20,281
- l said, do you know what you did?!
- Take it easy!

518
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:22,204
lt`s OK. lt`s OK.

519
00:47:24,893 --> 00:47:28,329
You ruined my life, mister. Me and my wife.

520
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:31,564
And now l`m gonna ruin yours.

521
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,493
You don`t have to go out there
to see that girl.

522
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:37,246
We`ve been going for four years now.

523
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:46,085
See, four years... my wife
has been crying herself to sleep.

524
00:47:47,693 --> 00:47:50,127
What they did to her sister.

525
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:55,609
Look, l swear to ya, l wouldn`t turn down
the offer if l thought l couldn`t win the case.

526
00:47:55,693 --> 00:47:58,161
What do you mean, what you thought?

527
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,131
l am a working man,
trying to get my wife outta town.

528
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,249
Now, we hired you, and l am paying you.

529
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:07,565
And l gotta find out from the other side
that they offered $200,000?!

530
00:48:07,653 --> 00:48:09,450
l`m gonna win this.

531
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:15,130
l`m going to the jury with a solid case,
l got a famous doctor for an expert witness.

532
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:19,442
You`re gonna get, what,
five, six times what you...

533
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:22,648
You guys...

534
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,722
You guys, you`re all the same.

535
00:48:28,813 --> 00:48:32,647
The doctors at the hospital, you,
it`s always ``What l`m gonna do for ya.``

536
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:35,406
And then you screw up and it`s,

537
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,008
``We did the best that we could.
l`m dreadfully sorry.``

538
00:48:40,813 --> 00:48:44,806
And people like us live with your mistakes
the rest of our lives.

539
00:48:50,253 --> 00:48:52,244
- They took back the offer.
- They...?

540
00:50:14,093 --> 00:50:16,846
- Dr Gruber.
- Dr Gruber isn`t here today, sir.

541
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:20,209
- No, David Gruber.
- Well, he`s not on the chart.

542
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:23,362
He hasn`t been here all day.

543
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:32,292
- Phone book?
- Yup. Right here.

544
00:51:55,693 --> 00:51:57,684
- What is it?
- Dr Gruber.

545
00:51:57,773 --> 00:51:59,968
Dr Gruber`s not in.

546
00:52:00,053 --> 00:52:02,806
l had an appointment at his office.

547
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:05,805
l must have got it wrong.
l mean, we had a meeting.

548
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:09,124
- He`s not in, sir.
- Could you call him?

549
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:14,604
You can`t reach him, sir.
He`s on some island in the Caribbean.

550
00:52:14,693 --> 00:52:17,082
They don`t have a phone.

551
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:20,082
He`ll be back in a week.

552
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:25,251
lf you`d like Dr Halfrin`s number,
he`s taking his calls.

553
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,286
Thank you for seeing me.

554
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,128
What is it?

555
00:52:54,773 --> 00:52:57,412
l need an extension on my case.

556
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:03,725
You should have taken their offer.
Especially if you were unprepared.

557
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,601
- l had a witness disappear on me.
- That happens.

558
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:11,162
l could subpoena him if l had a week.

559
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:13,130
l don`t have a week.

560
00:53:14,093 --> 00:53:16,891
This case should never have come to trial.

561
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:20,409
But you know better. You`re Mr lndependent.

562
00:53:21,293 --> 00:53:24,410
You wanna be independent?
Be independent now.

563
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:28,482
l have no sympathy for you.

564
00:53:31,293 --> 00:53:32,772
Stearns, Harrington.

565
00:53:32,853 --> 00:53:35,287
- You know who they are?
- Should l?

566
00:53:36,253 --> 00:53:38,528
Huge law firm.

567
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:43,843
OK, they put him in the firm,
he marries the daughter,

568
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:49,084
buys himself a dog, and everything is rosy.

569
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:54,481
Then Stearns tries to fix a case.

570
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:59,371
- Stearns did?
- Yeah, that Frankie was workin` on.

571
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:05,724
Figured he`d need a little help,
so he bribed ajuror.

572
00:54:07,773 --> 00:54:11,129
When Frankie heard about that,
he came to me in tears.

573
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:16,324
He figured anyone who knew
what a spinnaker was had to be a saint.

574
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:22,167
l said ``For Christ`s sakes, Frankie, wake up.
These people are sharks.``

575
00:54:23,773 --> 00:54:28,801
``How the hell do you think they wound up
with all that goddamn money? Doing good?``

576
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:31,726
But he didn`t wanna listen to me.

577
00:54:33,213 --> 00:54:37,092
He goes back to the boys
at Stearns and Harrington, and...

578
00:54:37,893 --> 00:54:41,090
he tells them that he`s very disappointed.

579
00:54:41,173 --> 00:54:43,767
He`s gonna go to the judge and rat them out.

580
00:54:45,053 --> 00:54:48,648
Course, they`re way ahead of him.
Before he can get there,

581
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:53,761
he runs into this federal marshal
and is indicted forjury-tampering.

582
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:58,529
They throw him in jail,
and he`s gonna be disbarred.

583
00:54:58,613 --> 00:55:01,002
His life is over.

584
00:55:02,373 --> 00:55:05,570
- Cape Cod Casualty.
- Mr Alito, please.

585
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:10,443
- Business hours are over, sir.
- l have to reach him. This is an emergency.

586
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:13,605
- Please give me his home number.
- Sorry, we're not allowed.

587
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:18,813
What? Well, could you call him,
yes, and have him call me, then?

588
00:55:18,893 --> 00:55:23,603
- l can't guarantee that he'll call you back.
- Yes. Oh, no, l understand, l understand.

589
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:26,366
Thank you. Thank you.
The name is Frank Galvin.

590
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:29,763
- Could you spell that, please?
- Yes. G-a-l-v-i-n.

591
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:32,845
And l will be at the following number
in about half an hour.

592
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,051
Jimmy, give me a beer, will ya?

593
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:36,532
- Want one?
- Yeah.

594
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,922
Two.

595
00:55:39,013 --> 00:55:43,723
OK, so now he`s in jail
and he finally gets to see the light.

596
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:48,610
He calls up Harrington and tells him
that he thinks he made a big mistake.

597
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:51,730
Like that, l mean, like magic.

598
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:56,726
All charges are dropped,
and he`s released from jail.

599
00:55:58,933 --> 00:56:02,403
But he`s fired from the firm,

600
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:05,204
his wife divorces him,

601
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:07,932
he starts hittin` the booze,

602
00:56:08,013 --> 00:56:11,801
and he mopes around
for about three and a half years.

603
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:15,086
You like that story, Laura?

604
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:20,371
What else do you wanna know
about Frankie?

605
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:39,651
Hello?

606
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:42,372
Oh, yeah. Thanks for calling.

607
00:56:42,453 --> 00:56:46,446
Frank Galvin.
l`m representing Deborah Ann Kaye.

608
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:53,088
Well, l`d like to discuss
your firm`s offer of that 210...

609
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:58,648
Well, in the sense that,

610
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:01,247
we`d like to accept it.

611
00:57:06,013 --> 00:57:12,691
Yeah, well, it came as something of a shock
to me too, but it is my client`s wishes and...

612
00:57:12,773 --> 00:57:17,801
She changed her mind as of tonight
and, of course, l tried to dissuade her.

613
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:24,009
On the eve of the trial... Well, you understand.

614
00:57:24,093 --> 00:57:28,086
l think she just came down
with a terrible case of the jitters.

615
00:57:34,373 --> 00:57:36,841
When was that arrived at?

616
00:57:38,453 --> 00:57:43,129
Well, l know what Concannon said, but
l think you guys are making a big mistake.

617
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:48,082
l think you oughta reconsider, l think you
oughta get the principals back together.

618
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:53,212
OK.

619
00:57:53,293 --> 00:57:55,887
No, no. l understand.

620
00:57:56,493 --> 00:57:59,769
No, that`s fine. l`m really sorry
to bother you at home.

621
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:06,603
What happened? You didn`t talk to Gruber?

622
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,852
Concannon got to him.

623
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:18,002
l can`t even breathe in here.

624
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:42,327
We`re outta time. See if there`s
somebody on this list to replace Gruber.

625
00:59:06,173 --> 00:59:09,165
Well, there`s Dr Thompson. He`s the nearest.

626
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:29,363
Dr Thompson.

627
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:34,288
Yeah, Frank Galvin, representing Deborah
Ann Kaye. We had some correspondence.

628
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:40,042
Well, l`m sorry l didn`t get back to you,
but the case got postponed.

629
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:44,046
l had to reorganise my staff.
l`m sorry to call you so late.

630
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:47,648
Well, we`ve had a change of strategy.

631
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:52,490
l was just wondering if you could...

632
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:54,450
Well, it is kinda short notice, at any rate...

633
01:00:01,404 --> 01:00:04,157
Would you like me to go?

634
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:06,553
No, l...

635
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:09,239
l just...

636
01:00:09,324 --> 01:00:12,521
- Why don`t you try and get some rest?
- l have work to do.

637
01:00:12,604 --> 01:00:14,993
You can`t work if you can`t think.

638
01:00:16,164 --> 01:00:18,553
Try and sleep.

639
01:00:18,964 --> 01:00:21,319
l`ll stay here with you.

640
01:00:21,404 --> 01:00:23,440
Stay here?

641
01:00:23,524 --> 01:00:25,515
Yeah.

642
01:00:29,844 --> 01:00:33,234
l`ll just see if l can get a little sleep.

643
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:44,721
- What is your name, please?
- Dr Robert Towler.

644
01:00:45,524 --> 01:00:49,517
- You were Deborah Ann Kaye`s doctor?
- No, actually, she was referred to me.

645
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,233
- She was Dr Hagman`s...
- Don`t equivocate. Be positive. Tell the truth.

646
01:00:53,324 --> 01:00:56,236
Whatever the truth is, just tell that.
You were her doctor.

647
01:00:56,324 --> 01:00:57,962
- Yes.
- Say it.

648
01:00:59,244 --> 01:01:00,597
l was her doctor.

649
01:01:00,884 --> 01:01:06,834
You were her anaesthesiologist
at the delivery on May 12th, 1976?

650
01:01:06,924 --> 01:01:13,113
- Well, l was one of a group of medical...
- No, answer affirmatively, simply, please.

651
01:01:13,204 --> 01:01:16,753
And keep your answers down to
three words. You were not part of a group.

652
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:20,120
You were her anaesthesiologist. lsn`t that so?

653
01:01:20,204 --> 01:01:20,954
Yes.

654
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,763
You were there to help Dr Marx
deliver the child.

655
01:01:23,844 --> 01:01:25,721
Yes.

656
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:28,399
Anything special about the case?

657
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,839
Well, when she had been...

658
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:34,363
- ``When Debby...`` Thank you.
- Thank you.

659
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:37,277
- When Debby had been...
- Remember that, Dr Towler.

660
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:40,276
Who else was with you
in the operating room?

661
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:45,680
Miss Nevins, nurse anaesthetist. Dr Marx, of
course. Maureen Rooney, obstetric nurse...

662
01:01:45,764 --> 01:01:48,995
And what did these people do
when her heart stopped?

663
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:52,235
- We went to Code Blue.
- Code Blue?

664
01:01:52,324 --> 01:01:55,760
Do you mind explaining to the jury
what that means?

665
01:01:56,764 --> 01:02:01,633
lt`s a common medical expression. lt`s
a crash programme to restore the heartbeat.

666
01:02:01,724 --> 01:02:06,514
Dr Marx cut an airway in her trachea so
she could get oxygen - she and the baby.

667
01:02:06,644 --> 01:02:09,954
- Miss Nevins...
- Why wasn`t she getting oxygen?

668
01:02:10,044 --> 01:02:12,717
- Many reasons, really.
- Tell me one.

669
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:17,161
- She`d aspirated vomitus into her mask.
- She threw up in her mask.

670
01:02:17,244 --> 01:02:21,715
Cut the bullshit, please. Just say it.
``She threw up in her mask.``

671
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:24,477
She threw up in her mask.

672
01:02:24,564 --> 01:02:28,193
Therefore she wasn`t getting oxygen
and her heart stopped?

673
01:02:28,284 --> 01:02:31,003
- That`s right.
- And what did your team do then?

674
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:34,838
You brought 30 years of medical experience
to bear. lsn`t that what you did?

675
01:02:34,924 --> 01:02:39,634
A patient riddled with complications, with
questionable information on her charts.

676
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:42,796
- We did everything we could.
- To save her, to save the child.

677
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:46,877
- You reached down into death.
- We tried to save her. You can`t know.

678
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:48,443
You can`t know!

679
01:02:48,524 --> 01:02:50,719
Good. Good!

680
01:02:52,244 --> 01:02:54,235
Now tell us.

681
01:02:59,724 --> 01:03:02,363
Well... this patient...

682
01:03:12,644 --> 01:03:14,839
Mr Galvin?

683
01:03:16,524 --> 01:03:18,719
Dr Thompson.

684
01:03:19,444 --> 01:03:21,799
Good of you to meet me.

685
01:03:23,204 --> 01:03:26,514
- Well, l`m glad you could come.
- My pleasure.

686
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:33,203
Well... l have some errands to run,
and then l thought we`d spend the evening...

687
01:03:33,284 --> 01:03:36,674
- That`s what l planned on doing.
- And then l want you to...

688
01:03:36,764 --> 01:03:38,880
to go out to the home and see the girl.

689
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:42,400
From what l`ve read, Mr Galvin,
you have a very good case.

690
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:45,157
Yes, l think so. l think so.

691
01:03:45,244 --> 01:03:47,474
Well...

692
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,037
You will be very comfortable.

693
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:56,161
- l`ve put you up at my apartment.
- l made a reservation.

694
01:03:56,244 --> 01:04:01,272
You don`t know who you`re dealing with.
They`ll bring a lot of pressure to bear.

695
01:04:01,364 --> 01:04:05,198
- There`s nothing they can do to me.
- Please! Please, sir.

696
01:04:05,284 --> 01:04:07,479
Humour me.

697
01:04:08,604 --> 01:04:11,596
Here is the address. The key is right inside.

698
01:04:12,364 --> 01:04:14,559
341 Worth, please.

699
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:18,482
Treat the place as your very own and...

700
01:04:19,444 --> 01:04:21,674
But please, please, don`t call anybody.

701
01:04:21,764 --> 01:04:25,154
And thank you...
thank you very much for coming.

702
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:49,874
- How's our new witness?
- Did you find the obstetric nurse?

703
01:04:49,964 --> 01:04:54,276
She's working the night shift at the hospital.
She's home now. l'll take a run over there.

704
01:04:54,364 --> 01:04:58,835
Give me the address. l`m goin`.
We`re gonna need her.

705
01:05:22,924 --> 01:05:25,233
Hi. Frank Galvin.

706
01:05:26,044 --> 01:05:31,164
l represent Deborah Ann Kaye
in the case against St Catherine Labouré.

707
01:05:31,244 --> 01:05:35,556
- l told the guy l didn`t wanna talk to anybody.
- lt`ll just take a second.

708
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:39,353
Deborah Ann Kaye.
You know what l`m talkin` about.

709
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:43,636
- Do you know who our chief witness is?
- No.

710
01:05:43,724 --> 01:05:48,957
David Gruber. He`s the assistant chief
anaesthesiologist at Mass Commonwealth.

711
01:05:49,044 --> 01:05:54,835
He says that your doctors, Towler and Marx,
put my client in a hospital for life.

712
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:58,793
We can prove that.
See, what we don`t know is why.

713
01:05:58,884 --> 01:06:01,114
What went on in there,
in the operating room?

714
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:04,719
l mean, something happened.
You know what it was.

715
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:08,240
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic.
Now, something happened!

716
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:11,714
There was a distraction.
What? The telephone? What?

717
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:13,954
You have your doctor.
What do you need me for?

718
01:06:14,044 --> 01:06:16,683
We need someone
who was in the operating room.

719
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,073
We`re gonna win the case.

720
01:06:19,164 --> 01:06:22,634
There`s no question of that.
lt`s simply a matter of how big.

721
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:28,154
- Well, l don`t have anything to say to you.
- You know what happened.

722
01:06:28,244 --> 01:06:32,078
- Nothing happened.
- Then why don`t you testify for their side?

723
01:06:33,084 --> 01:06:37,635
l can subpoena you, you know.
l can put you up there on the stand.

724
01:06:37,724 --> 01:06:39,840
And ask me what?

725
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:42,313
Who turned my client
into a goddamn vegetable?

726
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:44,679
- l didn`t do it.
- Who are you protecting?

727
01:06:44,764 --> 01:06:47,995
- Who says l`m protecting anyone?
- Doctors? What do you owe them?

728
01:06:48,084 --> 01:06:52,077
- l don`t owe them a goddamn thing!
- Then why don`t you testify for them?

729
01:06:52,164 --> 01:06:54,803
- You`re very pushy, fella.
- You think l`m pushy now.

730
01:06:54,884 --> 01:06:59,560
- Wait till l get you up there on the stand!
- Well, maybe you just better do that, then!

731
01:07:00,444 --> 01:07:02,912
You know, you guys are all the same.

732
01:07:03,004 --> 01:07:05,757
You don`t care who you hurt.

733
01:07:05,844 --> 01:07:08,597
All you care about is a dollar.
You`re a bunch of whores!

734
01:07:09,644 --> 01:07:13,922
You`ve got no loyalty... no nothing.
You`re a bunch of whores!

735
01:07:18,644 --> 01:07:21,033
Thank you.

736
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,354
His name is Dr Lionel Thompson.

737
01:07:23,444 --> 01:07:27,722
City College of New York,
class of `28. Bachelor of Science.

738
01:07:27,804 --> 01:07:31,763
New York College of Medicine,
16th in a class of 22.

739
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:35,883
1976, got a courtesy appointment,
staff of anaesthesiology,

740
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:38,432
Easthampton Hospital for Women.

741
01:07:39,244 --> 01:07:43,203
Never married. Has no honours
or degrees of any weight.

742
01:07:43,284 --> 01:07:47,641
Since 1975 he`s testified in 28 court cases.

743
01:07:48,204 --> 01:07:50,638
12 malpractice.

744
01:07:50,724 --> 01:07:53,761
And he`s black.

745
01:07:56,764 --> 01:08:00,154
l`ll tell you how you handle the fact
that he`s black. Don`t touch it.

746
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:05,238
Don`t mention it. Treat him just like
anybody else, neither better nor worse.

747
01:08:05,324 --> 01:08:09,078
And let`s have a black lawyer sit at our table.

748
01:08:09,444 --> 01:08:11,674
- OK?
- Yes, sir.

749
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:15,323
And what else do you do?

750
01:08:15,404 --> 01:08:19,283
Get the record of his testimony
in the 12 malpractice cases.

751
01:08:19,364 --> 01:08:22,117
Do that. We`ll be at Locke-Ober`s.

752
01:08:24,884 --> 01:08:28,513
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic -
under the circumstances.

753
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,322
Why is that?

754
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:34,761
Her sister said she ate
one hour prior to admittance.

755
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:39,554
That`s what her sister says. The admittance
form says she ate nine hours prior.

756
01:08:39,644 --> 01:08:42,112
She went in complaining of nausea.

757
01:08:42,564 --> 01:08:46,682
A good doctor would have doubted
the information on the chart.

758
01:08:46,764 --> 01:08:48,994
ls that what a good doctor would do?

759
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:52,759
- How old are you, Doctor?
- l`m 74 years old.

760
01:08:53,404 --> 01:08:56,635
And what makes you
an expert in anaesthesiology?

761
01:08:56,724 --> 01:09:01,752
l`m on the staff of anaesthesiology,
Easthampton Hospital for Women.

762
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,914
The Easthampton Hospital for Women?

763
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:08,882
What is that, ajoke?
Let me tell you something, Doctor.

764
01:09:08,964 --> 01:09:12,877
Those men at Catherine Labouré, known
not only in this city but in the world,

765
01:09:12,964 --> 01:09:15,194
were trying to save a woman`s life.

766
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,117
They were there.
And here you are, four years later...

767
01:09:18,204 --> 01:09:21,879
l made a detailed physical examination
of the patient, sir.

768
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:27,316
ls she getting good treatment over there?

769
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:31,522
Well, actually, it`s...
Yes. Well, it`s by no means bad, but...

770
01:09:31,604 --> 01:09:34,482
What`s the point of ruining
the reputation of two men

771
01:09:34,564 --> 01:09:38,716
to try to help a girl whose life`s
not gonna be changed in the least?

772
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:40,954
You know what Code Blue is?

773
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:42,716
Code Blue...

774
01:09:43,884 --> 01:09:46,273
lt`s a common medical term.

775
01:09:55,364 --> 01:09:57,355
We`re gonna lose.

776
01:09:59,484 --> 01:10:02,282
You think it`s my fault?

777
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,162
Well, there must be something you can do.

778
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:07,633
That`s not the point.

779
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:13,193
lt`s over.

780
01:10:25,284 --> 01:10:27,718
Do you think it`s my fault?

781
01:10:27,804 --> 01:10:30,477
That l could have...

782
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:32,839
No. But...

783
01:10:34,844 --> 01:10:38,803
Oh, God. l never should have taken it.
There was no way l could win.

784
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:43,397
And it`s over?

785
01:10:43,484 --> 01:10:45,520
Yeah, it`s over.

786
01:10:45,604 --> 01:10:49,119
But l thought it wasn`t over
until the jury comes in.

787
01:10:49,924 --> 01:10:52,484
- Who`d you hear that from?
- From you.

788
01:10:55,724 --> 01:10:58,079
You want me to tell you it`s your fault.

789
01:10:58,164 --> 01:11:01,679
OK, it probably is.
But what are you gonna do about it?

790
01:11:07,244 --> 01:11:12,079
- l wanted to talk to you. l thought maybe...
- You maybe could get some sympathy?

791
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:14,553
You came to the wrong place.

792
01:11:15,884 --> 01:11:18,762
What makes you so tough?

793
01:11:21,004 --> 01:11:23,643
- Maybe l`ll tell you later.
- ls there gonna be a later?

794
01:11:23,724 --> 01:11:29,799
Not if you don`t grow up. You`re like a kid,
coming in here like it`s Sunday night.

795
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:34,036
You want me to say you have a fever
so you don`t have to go back to school.

796
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:39,323
- Why won`t you understand?
- l do understand, Frank. Believe me, l do!

797
01:11:39,404 --> 01:11:42,953
You say you`re gonna lose, ``ls it my fault?``

798
01:11:43,044 --> 01:11:46,161
The damn case starts tomorrow,
and already it`s over for you.

799
01:11:46,244 --> 01:11:48,633
- lt is over.
- You wanna be a failure?

800
01:11:48,724 --> 01:11:52,717
Then do it someplace else! l can`t
invest in failure, Frank, any more.

801
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:56,513
l can`t.

802
01:11:59,604 --> 01:12:02,243
Excuse me.

803
01:12:10,124 --> 01:12:11,762
Frank?

804
01:12:13,804 --> 01:12:14,759
Frank.

805
01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:19,233
Please don`t... please...

806
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:22,159
please...

807
01:12:23,484 --> 01:12:25,475
please don`t pressure me.

808
01:12:25,564 --> 01:12:27,759
Please don`t.

809
01:13:14,084 --> 01:13:18,794
l`m gonna do the best
that l can for you and your sister.

810
01:13:18,884 --> 01:13:23,082
l know how much it means to you,
and it means that much to me, too.

811
01:13:49,924 --> 01:13:52,313
- How ya holding up?
- Good.

812
01:13:54,484 --> 01:13:57,044
All we have is the witch doctor.

813
01:13:57,124 --> 01:14:00,116
- Yeah.
- Well, look at it this way, Frankie.

814
01:14:01,124 --> 01:14:05,720
lt`s refreshing every time a doctor
takes the stand he`s not a Jew.

815
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:09,442
All rise!

816
01:14:25,804 --> 01:14:30,082
Hear ye, hear ye. All persons having
anything to do before the Superior Court

817
01:14:30,164 --> 01:14:35,079
now sitting at Boston, draw near,
give your attendance and you shall be heard.

818
01:14:35,164 --> 01:14:38,952
God save the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. Be seated.

819
01:14:41,324 --> 01:14:44,282
Deborah Ann Kaye versus
St Catherine Labouré Hospital

820
01:14:44,364 --> 01:14:47,913
and Robert S Towler MD
and Sheldon F Marx MD.

821
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:52,318
ls the plaintiff ready?

822
01:14:53,924 --> 01:14:56,597
- We are, Your Honour.
- Defence?

823
01:14:56,684 --> 01:14:59,596
- Ready for the defence, Your Honour.
- Let`s begin.

824
01:15:02,004 --> 01:15:04,154
Your Honour,

825
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:08,762
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

826
01:15:10,084 --> 01:15:12,882
it`s a terrible thing to sit in judgment.

827
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,838
So much rides on it.

828
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:21,881
l know that you have thought
``How can l be pure?``

829
01:15:23,404 --> 01:15:25,634
``How can...

830
01:15:26,244 --> 01:15:30,635
how can l be impartial without being cold?``

831
01:15:30,724 --> 01:15:33,921
``How can l be...

832
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:37,833
merciful, and still be just?``

833
01:15:38,444 --> 01:15:42,198
l know that some of you
have said prayers today

834
01:15:42,284 --> 01:15:46,243
to be helped to judge correctly.

835
01:15:49,524 --> 01:15:51,719
We have the reputation of two men,

836
01:15:51,804 --> 01:15:58,277
two well-respected doctors before us,

837
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:01,473
and a renowned hospital.

838
01:16:02,084 --> 01:16:06,953
And with them we have
my client, Deborah Ann Kaye,

839
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:10,273
who was deprived of sight,

840
01:16:13,284 --> 01:16:16,117
of speech, of hearing,

841
01:16:17,004 --> 01:16:19,279
of locomotion, of...

842
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:22,322
Well, in short, everything
that constitutes her life.

843
01:16:22,404 --> 01:16:27,034
We will prove that she was deprived
through negligence,

844
01:16:28,924 --> 01:16:32,803
through the negligence
of these respected men.

845
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:37,994
We will show, one...

846
01:16:38,284 --> 01:16:41,037
Why did he go to see Maureen Rooney?

847
01:16:41,124 --> 01:16:43,638
She`s the only nurse who isn`t testifying.

848
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:46,113
- And what did he find?
- Nothing.

849
01:16:46,964 --> 01:16:49,273
How good`s your intelligence?

850
01:16:49,364 --> 01:16:51,559
Very good.

851
01:16:52,844 --> 01:16:56,200
So what is the rest of his case,
aside from this Dr Thompson?

852
01:16:56,284 --> 01:16:58,878
As far as we know, nothing.

853
01:16:58,964 --> 01:17:03,560
Thank Mr Concannon for me.
Please tell him l`ll see him in his office.

854
01:17:07,044 --> 01:17:09,433
Good morning, Doctor. Dr Thompson,

855
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:13,153
just so the jury knows,
you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.

856
01:17:13,244 --> 01:17:15,474
- ls that correct?
- That is correct.

857
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:18,237
l was engaged to render an opinion.

858
01:17:18,324 --> 01:17:21,839
``Engaged to render an opinion``
for a price. That is correct?

859
01:17:21,924 --> 01:17:25,280
- You are being paid to be here?
- Just as you are, sir.

860
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,717
Are you board-certified
in anaesthesiology?

861
01:17:30,804 --> 01:17:34,001
No, l`m not. lt`s quite common
in New York State to practise...

862
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:38,282
Yes, l`m quite sure it is,
but this is Massachusetts.

863
01:17:38,364 --> 01:17:41,242
Are you board-certified in internal medicine?

864
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:42,074
No.

865
01:17:42,164 --> 01:17:44,997
- Neurology?
- No.

866
01:17:45,084 --> 01:17:46,836
Orthopaedics?

867
01:17:46,924 --> 01:17:49,597
l`m just an MD.

868
01:17:49,684 --> 01:17:52,721
Do you know Dr Robert Towler?

869
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:54,920
- l know of him.
- And how is that?

870
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:58,396
- Through his book.
- What book is that?

871
01:17:59,164 --> 01:18:01,997
Methodology and Practice...

872
01:18:04,364 --> 01:18:07,481
..in Anesthesiology.

873
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:11,114
Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology.

874
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:12,432
Yes.

875
01:18:12,524 --> 01:18:16,153
- How old are you, Doctor?
- l`m 74 years old.

876
01:18:18,244 --> 01:18:22,032
Do you still practise quite a lot of medicine?

877
01:18:22,124 --> 01:18:24,797
l`m on the staff of anaesthesiology...

878
01:18:24,884 --> 01:18:26,875
Yes. Yes, l`ve heard that.

879
01:18:26,964 --> 01:18:32,322
But you do testify quite a bit
against other physicians.

880
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:37,842
lsn`t that correct? You are available for that,
so long as you`re paid to be there.

881
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:40,793
Sir, yes.

882
01:18:42,404 --> 01:18:46,761
When a thing is wrong,
as in this case, l am available.

883
01:18:48,204 --> 01:18:50,274
l`m 74 years old.

884
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:52,639
l`m not board-certified.

885
01:18:52,724 --> 01:18:58,799
l`ve been practising medicine for 46 years,
and l know when an injustice has been done.

886
01:18:59,124 --> 01:19:01,399
Do you, indeed?

887
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:04,157
l bet you do. That`s fine.

888
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,599
Fine.

889
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:08,800
Let`s save the court time.

890
01:19:08,884 --> 01:19:12,115
We`ll admit Dr Thompson
as an ``expert witness``.

891
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:18,720
Mr Galvin, do you want to continue now?
Or we could resume this afternoon.

892
01:19:19,724 --> 01:19:22,113
l`ll continue, Your Honour.

893
01:19:22,204 --> 01:19:24,399
Dr Thompson,

894
01:19:25,164 --> 01:19:30,557
did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye at the
Northern Chronic Care Facility last night?

895
01:19:30,644 --> 01:19:31,759
- l did.
- Objection.

896
01:19:31,844 --> 01:19:37,123
Sustained. The witness will confine his
testimony to review of the hospital records.

897
01:19:37,684 --> 01:19:43,680
Dr Thompson, in your review of
the hospital records of May 12th 1976,

898
01:19:43,764 --> 01:19:47,962
in your opinion,
what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?

899
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:50,717
Cardiac arrest.

900
01:19:50,804 --> 01:19:53,193
During delivery her heart stopped.

901
01:19:53,764 --> 01:19:56,995
When the heart stops,
the brain is deprived of oxygen.

902
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:59,234
You get brain damage.

903
01:19:59,324 --> 01:20:02,043
That`s why she`s in the state she`s in today.

904
01:20:02,124 --> 01:20:06,436
Dr Towler has testified that he restored
the heartbeat in three to four minutes.

905
01:20:06,524 --> 01:20:09,641
ln your opinion, is that an accurate estimate?

906
01:20:10,004 --> 01:20:15,556
ln my opinion, it took much longer - nine,
ten minutes. There`s too much brain damage.

907
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:19,114
Are you saying failure to restore
heartbeat within nine minutes

908
01:20:19,204 --> 01:20:21,877
in itself constitutes bad medical practice?

909
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:24,432
- Your Honour!
- Yes, Mr Galvin?

910
01:20:25,244 --> 01:20:28,839
lf l may be permitted to question
my own witness in my own way...

911
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,392
- l`d like to get to the point.
- l am getting to...

912
01:20:31,484 --> 01:20:34,999
l believe l have the right
to ask the witness a direct question!

913
01:20:35,604 --> 01:20:38,437
Now let`s not waste these people`s time.

914
01:20:39,444 --> 01:20:41,594
Answer the question, Mr Witness, please.

915
01:20:41,684 --> 01:20:47,122
Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring
the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?

916
01:20:48,524 --> 01:20:51,322
ln that small context, l would have to say no.

917
01:20:51,804 --> 01:20:55,080
Then you`re saying there`s no negligence,
based on my question?

918
01:20:55,164 --> 01:20:59,760
- Given the limits of your question, yes.
- The doctors were not negligent.

919
01:21:01,964 --> 01:21:04,080
Thank you.

920
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:05,882
l`m not through questioning...

921
01:21:05,964 --> 01:21:08,603
Your Honour, with all due respect,

922
01:21:09,404 --> 01:21:12,680
if you`re gonna try my case for me,
l wish you wouldn`t lose it.

923
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:19,914
Thank you. l think
that`s enough for this morning.

924
01:21:20,364 --> 01:21:23,197
l`ll see counsel in my chambers.

925
01:21:23,284 --> 01:21:25,593
- Now, please!
- All rise.

926
01:21:26,604 --> 01:21:29,198
Court is adjourned until one o`clock.

927
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:37,436
l`m gonna write to the Board
of Bar Overseers about you today, fella.

928
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:41,995
You`re on your way out. They should have
kicked you out in that Lillibridge case.

929
01:21:42,084 --> 01:21:44,439
Now, this is it, today.

930
01:21:45,444 --> 01:21:47,958
l`m an attorney,

931
01:21:48,044 --> 01:21:51,514
on trial before the Bar,
representing my client.

932
01:21:51,604 --> 01:21:55,961
My client. When you open your mouth,
you`re losin` my case for me.

933
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:58,399
- Listen to me, fella...
- No, you listen to me!

934
01:21:58,484 --> 01:22:01,123
All l wanted out of this trial was a fair shake.

935
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:04,560
You push me into court five days early,
l lose my star witness,

936
01:22:04,644 --> 01:22:07,317
and l can`t get a continuance.
And l don`t care.

937
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:11,682
l`m goin` up there, l`m gonna try it, and
let the jury decide. They told me about you.

938
01:22:11,764 --> 01:22:14,642
Said you`re a hard-ass,
you`re a defendant`s judge.

939
01:22:14,724 --> 01:22:17,955
Well, l don`t care.
l said to hell with it. To hell with it!

940
01:22:18,164 --> 01:22:19,961
Look, Galvin, many years ago l...

941
01:22:20,044 --> 01:22:23,161
Come on! Don`t give me that shit
about you bein` a lawyer too.

942
01:22:23,244 --> 01:22:25,917
l know about you.
You couldn`t hack it as a lawyer.

943
01:22:26,004 --> 01:22:29,235
You were a bagman for the boys downtown,
and you still are.

944
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:32,157
- Are you done?
- You`re damn right l`m done.

945
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:36,874
l`m gonna ask for a mistrial. l`ll request
that you disqualify yourself from this case.

946
01:22:36,964 --> 01:22:40,434
l`ll take a transcript of the trial
to the Judicial Conduct Board

947
01:22:40,524 --> 01:22:44,233
- and ask them to impeach your ass!
- You aren`t gonna get a mistrial, boy.

948
01:22:44,324 --> 01:22:47,760
We`re going back,
and we`re gonna try this case to the end!

949
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:51,559
Get out of here before l call the bailiff
and have you thrown in jail!

950
01:23:07,644 --> 01:23:09,839
What does it mean?

951
01:23:09,924 --> 01:23:12,836
l mean, you have other tactics?

952
01:23:12,924 --> 01:23:17,839
Oh, yeah. They present their case, then
l get a chance, and we just cross-examine.

953
01:23:17,924 --> 01:23:22,475
Are we gonna win? l mean,
you have other tactics, though?

954
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:23,963
Yeah.

955
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:30,993
Thank you, Dr Towler.

956
01:23:31,084 --> 01:23:33,439
No further questions, Your Honour.

957
01:23:33,524 --> 01:23:35,242
- Dr Towler?
- Yes.

958
01:23:35,324 --> 01:23:37,599
- Let`s work backwards.
- Yes.

959
01:23:39,004 --> 01:23:42,201
You have a record of what happened
in the operating room.

960
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:46,800
You made notations every 30 seconds
of the procedures.

961
01:23:46,884 --> 01:23:51,912
These notations stop four and a half minutes
after Deborah Ann Kaye`s heart stopped.

962
01:23:52,004 --> 01:23:57,032
Four and a half minutes after her heart
stopped. They resumed three minutes later.

963
01:23:57,124 --> 01:24:02,118
We had more on our minds than taking notes.
We were trying to restore her heartbeat.

964
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:05,116
- What happened in those three minutes?
- We were trying...

965
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:07,479
- What happened?
- Objection, Your Honour.

966
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:10,476
Why did it take so long
to restore her heartbeat?

967
01:24:10,564 --> 01:24:13,237
Almost nine minutes to restore her heartbeat,

968
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:16,396
which caused massive
irreversible brain damage.

969
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:19,078
You`re not allowing the witness to answer.

970
01:24:19,164 --> 01:24:22,281
Thank you, Your Honour.
l would like to answer.

971
01:24:23,484 --> 01:24:25,793
Brain damage could have...

972
01:24:26,804 --> 01:24:30,717
lt didn`t necessarily take
nine or eight minutes.

973
01:24:30,804 --> 01:24:33,113
lt could have been caused in two.

974
01:24:33,204 --> 01:24:35,513
Wait a minute.

975
01:24:36,124 --> 01:24:39,958
You`re saying that her brain damage
could have been caused

976
01:24:40,044 --> 01:24:42,478
by being deprived of oxygen
for two minutes?

977
01:24:42,564 --> 01:24:43,713
Yes.

978
01:24:44,964 --> 01:24:47,239
Why is that?

979
01:24:48,844 --> 01:24:51,881
lt`s right there on her medical chart.

980
01:24:51,964 --> 01:24:56,082
She was anaemic. Less blood, less oxygen.

981
01:24:56,164 --> 01:24:59,474
The brain was getting less oxygen anyway.

982
01:25:10,844 --> 01:25:13,119
l didn`t do too well for you.

983
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:16,194
You did fine.

984
01:25:16,284 --> 01:25:18,752
No, l`m afraid that`s not true.

985
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:21,994
Will you want me to stay on till Monday?

986
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:24,917
No, thank you. You can go on home.

987
01:25:27,444 --> 01:25:32,393
You know, Mr Galvin,
sometimes people can surprise you.

988
01:25:32,484 --> 01:25:36,079
Sometimes they have
a great capacity to hear the truth.

989
01:25:37,084 --> 01:25:39,279
Yeah. Yes.

990
01:25:43,924 --> 01:25:47,758
- Sure you don`t want me to stay on?
- No. Thank you.

991
01:25:48,764 --> 01:25:51,153
You can go on home.

992
01:25:58,604 --> 01:26:01,038
l`ll see you back at the office.

993
01:26:11,644 --> 01:26:13,953
- What happened?
- lt`s bad.

994
01:26:16,364 --> 01:26:18,878
What are you going to do now?

995
01:26:20,284 --> 01:26:22,752
l don`t have a goddamn idea.

996
01:26:30,404 --> 01:26:34,443
- What do you do if you don`t have a witness?
- You use their witness.

997
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:38,312
- That`s right.
- Well, l think we`ve tried that, Francis.

998
01:26:38,964 --> 01:26:41,319
The case is over.

999
01:26:41,924 --> 01:26:45,121
You know, you broke the first rule
l taught you in law school:

1000
01:26:45,204 --> 01:26:48,435
You never ask a question
unless you have the answer to it.

1001
01:26:48,524 --> 01:26:52,312
Even your own expert witness
said there was no negligence.

1002
01:26:53,324 --> 01:26:55,997
lt`s over, period.

1003
01:26:56,084 --> 01:27:00,794
- There`ll be other cases.
- There are no other cases. This is the case.

1004
01:27:00,884 --> 01:27:03,842
There are no other cases. This is the case.

1005
01:27:06,844 --> 01:27:09,722
There are no other cases. This is the case.

1006
01:27:11,124 --> 01:27:13,877
No other cases, this is the case.

1007
01:27:16,884 --> 01:27:19,239
l know how you feel.

1008
01:27:21,044 --> 01:27:24,195
You don`t believe me, but l do know.

1009
01:27:26,404 --> 01:27:29,919
l`m gonna tell you something
that l learned when l was your age.

1010
01:27:30,004 --> 01:27:36,273
l had prepared a case, and old man White
said to me ``How did you do?``

1011
01:27:36,364 --> 01:27:39,800
And l said ``l did my best.``

1012
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,159
And he said

1013
01:27:44,564 --> 01:27:48,477
``You`re not paid to do your best.
You`re paid to win.``

1014
01:27:49,484 --> 01:27:52,282
And that`s what pays for this office,

1015
01:27:53,284 --> 01:27:57,721
pays for the pro bono work
that we do for the poor,

1016
01:28:00,244 --> 01:28:05,318
pays for the type of law
that you want to practise.

1017
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:11,919
lt pays for my whiskey.

1018
01:28:14,724 --> 01:28:18,319
lt pays for your clothes.

1019
01:28:19,964 --> 01:28:22,524
lt pays for the leisure we have to sit back

1020
01:28:22,604 --> 01:28:26,643
and discuss philosophy,
as we`re doing tonight.

1021
01:28:26,724 --> 01:28:29,158
We`re paid to win the case.

1022
01:28:33,204 --> 01:28:38,801
You`ve finished your marriage. You wanted
to come back and practise the law.

1023
01:28:45,484 --> 01:28:47,918
You wanted to come back to the world.

1024
01:28:53,804 --> 01:28:55,999
Welcome back.

1025
01:29:01,364 --> 01:29:04,003
Why isn`t Maureen Rooney testifying?

1026
01:29:05,204 --> 01:29:07,434
Hey! You with me? You awake?

1027
01:29:07,524 --> 01:29:10,243
- Yeah, l`m awake.
- She`s protecting somebody.

1028
01:29:10,324 --> 01:29:12,758
Who is she protecting?

1029
01:29:13,764 --> 01:29:15,083
Doctors?

1030
01:29:15,164 --> 01:29:18,713
lf she`s protecting the doctors,
she`d be on the witness stand.

1031
01:29:18,804 --> 01:29:21,193
Read me what she said.

1032
01:29:27,764 --> 01:29:31,996
``You guys are a bunch of whores.
Loyalty. Don`t care who you hurt.``

1033
01:29:32,084 --> 01:29:34,598
- ``You guys got no loyalty.``
- One of the nurses?

1034
01:29:34,684 --> 01:29:39,075
Who? Everybody who was in
the operating room is testifying.

1035
01:29:39,164 --> 01:29:42,156
All right. Who wasn't in the operating room?

1036
01:29:47,524 --> 01:29:49,754
The admitting nurse?

1037
01:29:50,764 --> 01:29:53,642
- What does she do?
- She took down the history.

1038
01:29:55,364 --> 01:29:58,356
And she signed it here. ``KC.`` Kaitlin Costello.

1039
01:29:58,444 --> 01:30:00,196
- The history?
- Yeah.

1040
01:30:00,284 --> 01:30:03,674
``How old are you?
How many children do you have?``

1041
01:30:22,004 --> 01:30:27,442
``How old are you? How many children
do you have? When did you last eat?``

1042
01:31:19,684 --> 01:31:21,322
Oh, Miss Rooney.

1043
01:31:22,924 --> 01:31:26,997
l understand what you`re doing,
and l just wanted you to know that it`s OK.

1044
01:31:27,084 --> 01:31:30,440
- What are you talking about?
- Well, about Kaitlin Costello.

1045
01:31:30,524 --> 01:31:33,163
l mean, l don`t blame you for shielding her.

1046
01:31:33,244 --> 01:31:37,032
- l spoke to her today.
- What are you talking about?

1047
01:31:37,804 --> 01:31:40,841
- l talked to her this morning, and...
- l know. She told me.

1048
01:31:40,924 --> 01:31:43,154
- She told you?!
- l just saw her.

1049
01:31:43,244 --> 01:31:45,838
ln New York? You saw Kat in New York?

1050
01:31:47,284 --> 01:31:49,798
Or is she in town? ls she in town?

1051
01:31:50,124 --> 01:31:52,684
Thank you. l`m sorry.

1052
01:31:52,764 --> 01:31:55,073
All right. Thank you.

1053
01:31:55,164 --> 01:31:58,361
Don`t we have anything
from the New York Nurse Association?

1054
01:31:58,444 --> 01:32:02,119
- That broad has disappeared.
- From the hospital?

1055
01:32:02,204 --> 01:32:05,116
Well, there`s no records since she quit in `76.

1056
01:32:05,204 --> 01:32:08,002
She quit two weeks after the incident.

1057
01:32:08,084 --> 01:32:09,961
- Thank you.
- l have to talk to you.

1058
01:32:10,044 --> 01:32:11,159
l can`t talk now.

1059
01:32:11,244 --> 01:32:15,123
Call the AMA. Tell `em you`re Dr Somebody
and you need to find a nurse,

1060
01:32:15,204 --> 01:32:17,160
get some forms, somebody`s dying.

1061
01:32:17,244 --> 01:32:23,274
Mrs Costello? l`m sorry to bother you this
late, but this is Mr Goldberg in Accounting.

1062
01:32:23,364 --> 01:32:26,162
We have some money here for you.

1063
01:32:27,484 --> 01:32:30,282
ls this the Mrs Costello, the registered nurse?

1064
01:32:30,364 --> 01:32:33,879
l see. Well, l`m sorry.
Our records must be mixed up.

1065
01:32:35,484 --> 01:32:38,157
Are you related to Kaitlin Costello?

1066
01:32:38,244 --> 01:32:41,714
- You aren`t. All right, thank you.
- This is Dr Dorchester in Boston.

1067
01:32:41,804 --> 01:32:45,479
Listen, a nurse left my employment
about four years ago.

1068
01:32:46,284 --> 01:32:48,354
A Kaitlin Costello.

1069
01:32:49,364 --> 01:32:51,116
That`s correct.

1070
01:32:51,204 --> 01:32:55,322
This is Mr Dorchester in Records.
l`m trying to track down a Kaitlin Costello.

1071
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:58,840
- Laura? Laura, you got a cigarette?
- Kaitlin Costello.

1072
01:32:58,924 --> 01:33:01,040
Yeah. That`s right.

1073
01:33:01,124 --> 01:33:05,436
Well, she left about four years ago,
and we`re looking for her chart.

1074
01:33:05,524 --> 01:33:08,322
Kaitlin. Kaitlin Costello.

1075
01:33:09,404 --> 01:33:12,123
Laura, don`t forget the cigarettes.

1076
01:33:35,404 --> 01:33:37,964
Hello. This is Ross Williams calling.

1079
01:33:44,324 --> 01:33:48,954

- There's nobody here by that name.

1080
01:33:49,044 --> 01:33:50,602

1081
01:33:51,604 --> 01:33:54,437
Well, our records must have
been mixed up, l guess.

1082
01:33:54,524 --> 01:33:59,518
- ls this the family of Kaitlin Costello?
- You know what time it is?

1083
01:36:05,844 --> 01:36:08,278

- That`s why we`re calling, Miss Price.

1091
01:36:30,204 --> 01:36:31,876
Mrs.

We get the magazine at work.

1094

that`s the Manhattan Health Center.

1096
01:36:44,804 --> 01:36:48,194

01:37:40,364 --> 01:37:43,037

01:38:22,884 --> 01:38:25,523
What did you do with your hand? Come here.

1118
01:38:25,604 --> 01:38:28,118
What did you do to your hand?
What did you do?

1119
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:30,957
Hi. Let`s see this.

1120
01:38:31,044 --> 01:38:34,116
l`ve been meaning to stop in here
for a long time.

1121
01:38:34,204 --> 01:38:38,675
- You live in the neighbourhood?
- My nephew`s comin` to visit.

1122
01:38:38,764 --> 01:38:41,153
- How old is he?
- He`s four.

1123
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:47,875
Let`s see what we`ve got here.

1124

- Let`s see this.
- No! Don`t take it off.

1125
01:38:51,204 --> 01:38:53,479
You`re great with these kids.

1126
01:38:54,284 --> 01:38:56,434
Thank you.

1127
01:38:56,524 --> 01:38:58,913
No, l mean, you really are.

1128
01:39:01,924 --> 01:39:05,712
Oh, you`re the one they said was a nurse.

1129
01:39:07,484 --> 01:39:10,999
- Who told you that?
- l don`t know. Mrs...

1130
01:39:11,324 --> 01:39:13,713
- Mrs Simmons?
- Yeah.

1131
01:39:15,124 --> 01:39:17,479
l used to be a nurse.

1132
01:39:18,084 --> 01:39:21,759
Well, it`s a wonderful profession.
My daughter-in-law`s a...

1133
01:39:21,844 --> 01:39:24,312
What`d you do? Did you stop?

1134
01:39:24,724 --> 01:39:26,521
Yes.

1135
01:39:26,764 --> 01:39:29,153
Why`d you do that?

1136
01:39:44,804 --> 01:39:47,272
Will you help me?

1137
01:39:59,564 --> 01:40:02,761
What`s the matter?
Are you lost or something?

1138
01:40:02,844 --> 01:40:05,233
Frankie, we gotta talk.

1139
01:40:06,004 --> 01:40:09,792
Come on. There`s a bar around the corner.
We`ll get a cup of coffee.

1140
01:41:11,844 --> 01:41:14,233
Did you see that?

1141
01:41:15,044 --> 01:41:17,638
You all right, Miss?

1142
01:41:17,724 --> 01:41:20,033
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1143
01:41:20,844 --> 01:41:22,835
l`m all right.

1144
01:41:29,284 --> 01:41:31,718
- Leave him alone.
- Are you OK?

1145
01:41:33,724 --> 01:41:36,113
l`m all right. Thank you.

1146
01:41:56,844 --> 01:42:00,678
l talked to Johnny White
at the Bar Association.

1147
01:42:03,324 --> 01:42:07,283
She used to work for one of
Concannon`s partners in New York.

1148
01:42:07,364 --> 01:42:09,753
She wanted to come to Boston.

1149
01:42:11,404 --> 01:42:14,123
How bad did she hurt us?

1150
01:42:14,204 --> 01:42:16,399
l don`t know.

1151
01:42:19,764 --> 01:42:22,039
We got a mistrial, you know.

1152
01:42:25,044 --> 01:42:27,433
Did you hear what l said, Frank?

1153
01:42:28,364 --> 01:42:30,753
l don`t want a mistrial.

1154
01:42:55,884 --> 01:42:58,637
- Hello?
- ls Frank there?

1155
01:42:58,724 --> 01:43:02,114
- No. He`s not here now.
- When are you expecting him?

1156
01:43:02,204 --> 01:43:04,593
l don`t know when.

1157
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:21,315
Doctor Towler.

1158
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:26,034
Page 406. ``Contraindications
of General Anesthetic.``

1159
01:43:26,124 --> 01:43:29,719
``A patient should refrain from
taking nourishment up to nine hours

1160
01:43:29,804 --> 01:43:33,319
prior to induction of general anesthetic.``
Sound familiar?

1161
01:43:33,404 --> 01:43:36,077
Yes. l wrote it.

1162
01:43:37,924 --> 01:43:41,234
Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology.

1163
01:43:41,324 --> 01:43:43,918
A general textbook on the subject,
is that correct?

1164
01:43:44,004 --> 01:43:45,881
l...

1165
01:43:45,964 --> 01:43:47,955
Yes, it is.

1166
01:43:48,364 --> 01:43:50,434
- And you wrote it?
- Yes.

1167
01:43:52,004 --> 01:43:54,677
Page 414.

1168
01:43:55,364 --> 01:43:59,118
``lf the patient has taken nourishment
within one hour prior to inducement,

1169
01:43:59,204 --> 01:44:03,197
general anesthetic should be avoided
because of the grave risk

1170
01:44:03,284 --> 01:44:07,516
the patient will aspirate
food particles into his mask.``

1171
01:44:07,604 --> 01:44:11,916
ls that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
She aspirated food particles into her mask?

1172
01:44:12,004 --> 01:44:14,837
She threw up in her mask, yes.

1173
01:44:14,924 --> 01:44:18,837
But she hadn`t eaten
one hour before admission.

1174
01:44:18,924 --> 01:44:25,397
lf she had eaten an hour before
being admitted to the hospital,

1175
01:44:25,484 --> 01:44:31,241
then the inducement of a general
anaesthetic would have been negligent?

1176
01:44:31,804 --> 01:44:36,036
Negligent? Yes, it would have been criminal.
But such was not the case.

1177
01:44:39,044 --> 01:44:41,558
Thank you.

1178
01:44:41,644 --> 01:44:45,000
- Mr Concannon?
- No further questions, Your Honour.

1179
01:44:46,164 --> 01:44:48,075
Thank you, Dr Towler.

1180
01:44:48,164 --> 01:44:50,155
Mr Galvin, rebuttal?

1181
01:44:52,724 --> 01:44:55,113
Kaitlin Costello Price.

1182
01:44:55,204 --> 01:44:57,798
Kaitlin Costello Price.

1183
01:45:23,364 --> 01:45:25,434
State your name, please.

1184
01:45:25,524 --> 01:45:27,435
Kaitlin Costello Price.

1185
01:45:27,524 --> 01:45:31,199
Do you swear the evidence you give
will be the whole truth, so help you God?

1186
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:33,673
- l do.
- Be seated.

1187
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:39,358
- Kaitlin Price.
- Yes.

1188
01:45:40,404 --> 01:45:46,274
You were the admitting nurse
at St Catherine Labouré on May 12th, 1976,

1189
01:45:46,364 --> 01:45:49,561
the night that they admitted
Deborah Ann Kaye?

1190
01:45:49,644 --> 01:45:50,554
Yes.

1191
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:53,716
Did you sign this admission form?

1192
01:45:58,124 --> 01:46:00,922
- Yes.
- Those are your initials, ``KC``?

1193
01:46:01,004 --> 01:46:03,154
Kaitlin Costello.

1194
01:46:04,164 --> 01:46:07,042
That`s my maiden name.

1195
01:46:08,764 --> 01:46:12,552
Did you ask the patient
when did she last eat?

1196
01:46:14,404 --> 01:46:16,520
Yes.

1197
01:46:16,604 --> 01:46:18,595
What did she say?

1198
01:46:24,564 --> 01:46:26,953
She said she`d had a full meal

1199
01:46:28,364 --> 01:46:30,798
one hour before coming to the hospital.

1200
01:46:32,684 --> 01:46:35,073
- One hour?
- Yes.

1201
01:46:39,364 --> 01:46:43,755
And did you put the numeral ``one``
on this admission sheet?

1202
01:46:43,844 --> 01:46:45,994
l mean, standing for ``one hour``?

1203
01:46:46,084 --> 01:46:48,279
l did.

1204
01:46:48,364 --> 01:46:50,753
A single hour?

1205
01:46:52,964 --> 01:46:54,363
Yes.

1206
01:47:00,564 --> 01:47:02,873
Thank you.

1207
01:47:02,964 --> 01:47:05,353
Your witness.

1208
01:47:11,324 --> 01:47:13,519
Anything?

1209
01:47:37,124 --> 01:47:40,275
You`re aware of the penalties for perjury?

1210
01:47:41,284 --> 01:47:44,401
- lt`s a crime.
- lt is a crime. A serious crime.

1211
01:47:44,644 --> 01:47:47,033
- l wouldn`t do it.
- You would not?

1212
01:47:47,124 --> 01:47:48,523
No.

1213
01:47:48,604 --> 01:47:51,801
You`ve taken an oath
that you would not commit perjury.

1214
01:47:51,884 --> 01:47:54,682
- You`ve just sworn to that, isn`t that right?
- Yes.

1215
01:47:54,764 --> 01:47:57,073
- Just now.
- Yes.

1216
01:47:57,884 --> 01:48:02,321
You have sworn before God
that you would tell the truth.

1217
01:48:04,444 --> 01:48:05,160
Yes.

1218
01:48:05,244 --> 01:48:08,919
Now, l want to ask you something.

1219
01:48:10,364 --> 01:48:13,083
Four years ago,
when you were working as a nurse,

1220
01:48:13,164 --> 01:48:16,759
are you aware that
these doctors, Marx and Towler,

1221
01:48:16,844 --> 01:48:20,996
based their treatment of
Deborah Ann Kaye on this admitting form,

1222
01:48:21,084 --> 01:48:23,393
which you signed?

1223
01:48:25,884 --> 01:48:26,282
l...

1224
01:48:26,364 --> 01:48:30,277
Wasn`t that an oath?
These are your initials, ``KC.``

1225
01:48:30,364 --> 01:48:32,719
When you signed this form, you took an oath

1226
01:48:32,804 --> 01:48:36,683
no less important than that
which you`ve taken today.

1227
01:48:36,764 --> 01:48:39,153
lsn`t that right?

1228
01:48:41,124 --> 01:48:43,638
- lsn`t that right?
- Yes.

1229
01:48:44,884 --> 01:48:47,159
Then which is correct?

1230
01:48:47,244 --> 01:48:51,362
You`ve sworn today that the patient
ate one hour before admittance.

1231
01:48:51,444 --> 01:48:55,756
Four years ago you swore that
she ate nine hours before admittance.

1232
01:48:56,764 --> 01:48:59,153
All right, which is the lie?

1233
01:49:00,084 --> 01:49:02,723
- l...
- These men could have settled out of court.

1234
01:49:02,804 --> 01:49:05,364
They wanted a trial to clear their names.

1235
01:49:05,444 --> 01:49:10,564
And you would come here, and on a slip of
memory four years ago, you`d ruin their lives.

1236
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:14,193
- They lied.
- They lied?! They lied!

1237
01:49:14,284 --> 01:49:16,798
When did they lie?

1238
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:19,034
- Do you know what a lie is?
- l do, yes.

1239
01:49:19,124 --> 01:49:22,161
You swore on this form
that the patient ate nine hours...

1240
01:49:22,244 --> 01:49:25,554
- That`s not what l wrote.
- You just told me that you signed it.

1241
01:49:25,644 --> 01:49:28,761
l signed it, yes.

1242
01:49:30,164 --> 01:49:32,553
But l didn`t write a nine.

1243
01:49:34,084 --> 01:49:36,473
l wrote a one.

1244
01:49:38,044 --> 01:49:41,320
You didn`t write a nine, you wrote a one.

1245
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:45,554
And how is it that you remember
so clearly after four years?

1246
01:49:47,724 --> 01:49:50,363
Because l kept a copy.

1247
01:49:50,804 --> 01:49:53,272
- l have it right here.
- Objection!

1248
01:49:53,884 --> 01:49:57,115
We can`t accept a copy
when the court already has the original.

1249
01:49:57,204 --> 01:49:59,798
l`ll rule on that presently.

1250
01:50:01,484 --> 01:50:03,679
Please, proceed.

1251
01:50:08,044 --> 01:50:13,118
What in the world induced you to make
a photocopy of an obscure record

1252
01:50:13,204 --> 01:50:15,513
and hold it for four years?

1253
01:50:17,764 --> 01:50:19,994
Your Honour, this...

1254
01:50:25,764 --> 01:50:27,994
Why would you do that?

1255
01:50:32,564 --> 01:50:36,352
- l thought l might need it.
- And why would you think that?

1256
01:50:44,124 --> 01:50:46,319
After...

1257
01:50:47,404 --> 01:50:49,599
after the operation,

1258
01:50:51,004 --> 01:50:55,122
when that poor girl, she went into a coma,
Dr Towler called me in.

1259
01:50:57,164 --> 01:50:59,314
He told me

1260
01:51:00,324 --> 01:51:04,033
that he`d had five difficult deliveries in a row

1261
01:51:05,324 --> 01:51:07,633
and he was tired.

1262
01:51:09,884 --> 01:51:12,876
And he never looked at the admittance form.

1263
01:51:15,284 --> 01:51:17,878
And he told me to change the form.

1264
01:51:20,244 --> 01:51:22,758
He told me to change the one

1265
01:51:23,364 --> 01:51:25,673
to a nine.

1266
01:51:26,884 --> 01:51:33,039
Or else, he said... He said he`d fire me.
He said l`d never work again.

1267
01:51:33,124 --> 01:51:35,160
Who were these men?!

1268
01:51:35,244 --> 01:51:38,236
Who were these men?!
l wanted to be a nurse!

1269
01:51:47,044 --> 01:51:49,512
No further questions, Your Honour.

1270
01:51:50,884 --> 01:51:53,273
You may step down.

1271
01:52:03,924 --> 01:52:05,915
Mr Galvin?

1272
01:52:08,124 --> 01:52:10,479
Nothing further, Your Honour.

1273
01:52:10,564 --> 01:52:12,759
Mr Concannon?

1274
01:52:15,044 --> 01:52:16,397
Mr Concannon.

1275
01:52:19,444 --> 01:52:22,914
Thank you, Your Honour. We object
to the copy of the admitting form,

1276
01:52:23,004 --> 01:52:28,476
and we cite McGee versus
the State of lndiana, United States 131.2.

1277
01:52:28,884 --> 01:52:32,877
``The admission of a duplicate document
in preference to an existing original

1278
01:52:32,964 --> 01:52:38,402
must presuppose the possibility of
alteration and so must be disallowed.``

1279
01:52:39,564 --> 01:52:44,035
And, Your Honour, having
given the plaintiff the leeway,

1280
01:52:44,124 --> 01:52:47,116
we would like your ruling on this issue now.

1281
01:52:47,604 --> 01:52:50,835
We object to the admission
of a Xerox photocopy.

1282
01:52:53,724 --> 01:52:56,113
One moment, Mr Concannon.

1283
01:53:00,604 --> 01:53:02,834
Yes. The document is disallowed.

1284
01:53:02,924 --> 01:53:04,562
- Objection!
- Overruled.

1285
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:06,555
- Exception!
- Noted. Thank you.

1286
01:53:08,564 --> 01:53:10,839
Legally, he`s right.

1287
01:53:11,804 --> 01:53:17,754
The jury will not consider the testimony
of Miss Costello regarding the Xerox form.

1288
01:53:17,844 --> 01:53:19,960
lt is unsubstantiated.

1289
01:53:20,604 --> 01:53:24,438
We cannot accept a copy
in preference to the original.

1290
01:53:24,884 --> 01:53:29,036
Thank you, Your Honour. Furthermore,
Miss Costello is a rebuttal witness.

1291
01:53:29,124 --> 01:53:33,356
As the court knows, no prior notice
was given of Miss Costello`s appearance.

1292
01:53:33,444 --> 01:53:37,722
And as a surprise witness, she may
serve only to rebut direct testimony.

1293
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:43,518
As her only evidentiary rebuttal is the
admitting form which has been disallowed,

1294
01:53:43,604 --> 01:53:46,755
l request that
her entire testimony be disallowed,

1295
01:53:47,244 --> 01:53:52,557
and that the jury be advised to totally
disregard her entire appearance here.

1296
01:53:53,564 --> 01:53:56,124
- Yes, l`m going to uphold that.
- Objection.

1297
01:53:56,524 --> 01:53:58,958
- Overruled.
- Exception.

1298
01:53:59,124 --> 01:54:01,513
Noted. Thank you.

1299
01:54:02,244 --> 01:54:06,317
The jury will be advised not to consider
the testimony of Miss Costello.

1300
01:54:06,684 --> 01:54:09,403
Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.

1301
01:54:09,484 --> 01:54:13,193
The sole rebuttal was the document,
which has been disallowed.

1302
01:54:14,004 --> 01:54:18,122
Her entire testimony
must be stricken from the record.

1303
01:54:18,204 --> 01:54:20,923
You shouldn`t have heard it.
That was my mistake.

1304
01:54:21,004 --> 01:54:24,121
You must strike it from your minds.
Give it no weight!

1305
01:54:28,684 --> 01:54:30,959
Legally, it`s over.

1306
01:54:31,964 --> 01:54:34,194
Concannon was brilliant.

1307
01:54:34,804 --> 01:54:37,238
Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.

1308
01:54:37,324 --> 01:54:40,760
There`s nothing to tell.
lt`s been stricken from the record.

1309
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:43,718
l know. But did you believe her?

1310
01:54:58,844 --> 01:55:00,835
Mr Galvin?

1311
01:55:04,644 --> 01:55:07,238
Mr Galvin? Summation?

1312
01:55:26,324 --> 01:55:28,360
Well...

1313
01:55:29,164 --> 01:55:32,236
You know, so much of the time,
we`re just lost.

1314
01:55:34,644 --> 01:55:36,919
We say ``Please, God,

1315
01:55:37,524 --> 01:55:40,516
tell us what is right, tell us what is true.``

1316
01:55:43,444 --> 01:55:45,833
l mean, there is no justice.

1317
01:55:47,484 --> 01:55:50,078
The rich win, the poor are powerless.

1318
01:55:55,444 --> 01:56:00,120
We become tired of hearing people lie.

1319
01:56:02,844 --> 01:56:05,438
And after a time we become dead.

1320
01:56:08,044 --> 01:56:10,842
A little dead. We think of ourselves...

1321
01:56:13,124 --> 01:56:15,354
as victims.

1322
01:56:16,364 --> 01:56:18,753
And we become victims.

1323
01:56:21,364 --> 01:56:23,594
We become...

1324
01:56:26,004 --> 01:56:28,234
we become weak.

1325
01:56:30,244 --> 01:56:33,077
We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs.

1326
01:56:35,284 --> 01:56:37,673
We doubt our institutions.

1327
01:56:40,804 --> 01:56:43,238
And we doubt the law.

1328
01:56:43,324 --> 01:56:45,713
But today you are the law.

1329
01:56:49,484 --> 01:56:51,873
You are the law.

1330
01:56:55,964 --> 01:56:58,842
Not some book, not the lawyers.

1331
01:57:02,124 --> 01:57:04,513
Not a marble statue,

1332
01:57:05,924 --> 01:57:08,313
or the trappings of the court.

1333
01:57:10,844 --> 01:57:13,199
See, those are just symbols

1334
01:57:14,004 --> 01:57:16,199
of our desire

1335
01:57:17,404 --> 01:57:19,599
to be just.

1336
01:57:23,004 --> 01:57:25,438
They are...

1337
01:57:25,524 --> 01:57:27,958
they are, in fact, a prayer.

1338
01:57:29,764 --> 01:57:32,562
l mean, a fervent and a frightened prayer.

1339
01:57:37,724 --> 01:57:40,033
ln my religion

1340
01:57:41,244 --> 01:57:43,838
they say ``Act as if ye had faith,

1341
01:57:46,084 --> 01:57:48,552
and faith will be given to you.``

1342
01:57:51,444 --> 01:57:53,639
lf...

1343
01:57:57,124 --> 01:58:00,116
if we are to have faith in justice,

1344
01:58:02,724 --> 01:58:05,716
we need only to believe in ourselves,

1345
01:58:07,604 --> 01:58:10,038
and act with justice.

1346
01:58:12,044 --> 01:58:15,036
See, l believe there is justice in our hearts.

1347
01:59:02,204 --> 01:59:05,082
Have you reached a verdict?

1348
01:59:05,164 --> 01:59:07,120
We have, Your Honour.

1349
01:59:07,204 --> 01:59:11,755
Your Honour, we`ve agreed to hold
for the plaintiff, Deborah Ann Kaye,

1350
01:59:11,844 --> 01:59:16,872
and against St Catherine Labouré,
and Doctors Towler and Marx.

1351
01:59:17,444 --> 01:59:20,880
But, Your Honour, are we limited
on the size of the award?

1352
01:59:20,964 --> 01:59:22,443
What l mean, sir...

1353
01:59:22,524 --> 01:59:27,996
Are we permitted to award an amount greater
than the amount the plaintiff asked for?

1354
01:59:31,564 --> 01:59:33,759
You are.

1355
01:59:34,164 --> 01:59:39,397
You`re not bound by anything other than
your good judgment, based on the evidence.

1356
01:59:40,004 --> 01:59:44,043
Please retire, and when you`ve agreed
on the amount of the award...

1357
01:59:48,004 --> 01:59:50,393
You did it, Frank.

1358
01:59:53,364 --> 01:59:55,753
Way to go, Frank.
