- Yes?

181
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:22,968
- You're my kind of woman.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

182
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,928
Till next month, Miss Hannigan.

183
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,807
I'll be right here.

184
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:55,375
Mr. Bundles, I'm in here!

185
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:02,174
- Thank you, Mr. Bundles.
- Good luck.

186
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,252
Get his tail!

187
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,048
Poor dog.

188
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:28,427
Leave him alone.
What's he ever done to you?

189
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,554
Amscray!

190
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,395
All right, who's next?

191
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:46,820
Anybody else?

192
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:48,864
- Scram, man!
- Let's go!

193
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,533
- Then get lost.
- Let's get a move on!

194
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:55,162
- Let's hotfoot it!
- Shake a leg! Come on!

195
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,123
Let's go! Come on!

196
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,965
Hey, you're all right.

197
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,479
I didn't do nothing
any decent person wouldn't have done.

198
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,315

Oh, yeah? Where's his license?
Where's his leash?

210
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,841
He's no more your dog
than I am your father.

211
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,511
I left his license at home.

212
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:38,723
Please don't take him to the pound.
Please. My father's blind.

213
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:44,271
This dog leads him to work.
If he can't get to work, we'll starve.

214
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,897
What's his name?

215
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,358
My father's name?

216
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,904
- The dog's name.
- Oh, the dog's name!

217
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,532
Uh, his name's Sandy.

218
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,117
Right, that's it. Sandy.

219
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,577
Call him.

220
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,620
Call him?

221
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,665
Go over there and call him.

222
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,126
You mean by his name?

223
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:09,462
By his name. The dog's name.

224
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:21,016

232
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,168
You've got yourself a dog.
Get him a collar and a leash.

233
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:49,377
Yes, sir.

234
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,460

237
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:37,384

are you all right?

240
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,644
- I was worried sick.
- I knew you would be.

241
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,105
A big-hearted woman like you.

242
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:55,819

Yeah?

289
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:57,852
Miss Hannigan, I'm Grace Farrell.

290
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,146
The New York Board of Orphans
sent me.

291
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,522
Oh!

292
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,609
My goodness, won't you come in?

293
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,195
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

294
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,740
Well, welcome.

295
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:13,284
- Welcome to our happy home.
- Off my foot, Molly!

296
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,452
- Thank you.
- Ladies.

297
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:16,037
Smell that perfume.

298
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,039
- And your name was?
- Grace Farrell.

299
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,874
She wants a girl
to clean her house.

300
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,167
Aptly named.

301
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,754
- I bet it's gonna be me!
- I'm here to inquire about an orphan.

302
00:24:25,254 --> 00:24:28,967
Grace, I can explain the whole thing.
What happened was

303
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:34,055
the child bribed Mr. Bundles
to smuggle her out in a laundry basket.

304
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:37,558
I should have called Mr. Donatelli,
but the truth is

305
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,311
I just saw red,
so I called the cops instead.

306
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,856
Anyway, she's back, everything's fine.
All's well that ends well.

307
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,443
No harm, no foul, my little scissors legs?

308
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:50,363
Miss Hannigan, what are you talking about?

309
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:56,494
Hold it, sister,
are you peddling beauty products?

310
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,913
'Cause I don't need no beauty products.

311
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:03,084
If that's what you're doing,
you can peddle yourself right out of here.

312
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:08,589
Miss Hannigan, I am the private secretary
to Oliver War bucks.

313
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,466
The Oliver War bucks?

314
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:16,931
- Oliver War bucks the millionaire?
- No, the billionaire.

315
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,976
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

316
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,022
Mr. War bucks would like to invite
an orphan to spend a week with him.

317
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,983
I'm here to select one.

318
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,818
Well, that's just wonderful.

319
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:31,946
What kind of orphan did he have in mind?

320
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,489
Oh. Well, um...

321
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:34,907
friendly.

322
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:37,493
Intelligent.

323
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:41,998
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

324
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:44,042
And happy.

325
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,887
Oh!

326
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,308
How old?

327
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,894
Well, age doesn't really matter.

328
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,228
Uh-huh.

329
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,190
- Seven?
- Seven.

330
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:09,442
- Eight.
- Eight.

331
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:11,694
- Nine?
- Nine.

332
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,488
Ten?

333
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,490
Yes, 10 is just fine.

334
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,200
Ten? Ten.

335
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:19,660
Oh, oh.
I'm so sorry, I almost forgot.

336
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,915
- Mr. War bucks prefers redheaded children.
- A 10-year-old redhead, huh?

337
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,292
Nope. Sorry, ain't got it.

338
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:28,920
What about this child?

339
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,798
- Annie?
- Yes.

340
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:34,675
You wouldn't...

341
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,260
You don't want Annie.

342
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:37,845
Why not?

343
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,973
She's, uh...

344
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,601
She's a drunk.

345
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:46,896
Oh, fiddle-faddle, Miss Hannigan.

346
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:50,608
Annie, how'd you like to spend a week
with Mr. War bucks at his house?

347
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,486
Oh, boy. I would love to.

348
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,321
I would really, really love to.

349
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:58,157
Wait, slow down, hold on, there!

350
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,203
You can have any orphan
in the whole orphanage except Annie.

351
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:03,454
Well, why?

352
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:08,209
Because she's got it coming to her,
and I don't mean a week of luxury.

353
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,211
This brat's got to learn
to know her place.

354
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,420
Her place?

355
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,339
And Annie is entirely too cheeky.

356
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:17,552
- Well, Mr. War bucks likes cheeky orphans.
- Tough!

357
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:22,807
I assume your resistance has to do with
Mr. Donatelli and the Board of Orphans.

358
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,350
Don't assume nothing, sweetheart.

359
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:27,103
Well, Mr. War bucks knows Mr. Donatelli.

360
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:29,230
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.

361
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:34,402
It's also a fact that he said how many
people he had lined up for your job.

362
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,447
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

363
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,951
It's an awful time to be out of work,
isn't it, Miss Hannigan?

364
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,080
Just terrible.

365
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,583
Leaping lizards!

366
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,251
"Leaping lizards."

367
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,879
Come alone, Annie,
the limousine is waiting.

368
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,009
- My dog.
- What?

369
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,094
Here, Sandy. Come here.

370
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,764
He's really nice. Really, really good.

371
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,143
- He never jumps up on people.
- Oh, no? Oh!

372
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:13,566
Annie, he's a very sweet dog, but really,
I don't think Mr. War bucks...

373
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:16,277
- Then I'm not coming.
- What?

374
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,696
She's going to send him
to the sausage factory.

375
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:22,825
- She said so herself.
- I'm not zoned for dogs.

376
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,953
- We'll take the dog.
- Oh, boy!

377
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,212
Bye, Annie!

378
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,424
I'll be back.
I'll bring everybody presents.

379
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:51,229
Bye, Molly! See you soon!
Bye, Pepper! Bye, Duffy!

380
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:34,897
Is this a train station?
Are we going on a train?

381
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,024
No, dear, this is Mr. War bucks' house.

382
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:46,033
Leaping lizards.

383
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,294
Wow!

384
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:05,219
Annie, this is Punjab. He and the Asp
are Mr. War bucks' bodyguards.

385
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,348
Come along, dear. Let's get you settled.

386
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,793
Been to the zoo, Miss Farrell?

387
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,211
Not recently, Drake.

388
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:22,338
- Has the organ been tuned?
- Yes, miss.

389
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:23,547
- Pool heated?
- Yes.

390
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,091

- Yes.

391
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,634

- Second Teletype installed?
- Yes.

395
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:35,851
- Are you allergic to dogs, Drake?
- No, filth.

396
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,479
- Is dinner underway, Mrs. Pugh?
- Yes, miss.

397
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:41,857
I'm preparing his favorite.
Texas grapefruit, Virginia ham,

398
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:46,529
Idaho potatoes, Wisconsin cheese,
Washington apples, and baked Alaska.

399
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,241
I have an announcement to make, everybody.

400
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:53,452
This is Annie, and she'll be
staying with us for a week.

401
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,787
Miss.

402
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,789
And this is her dog, Sandy.

403
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:58,541
He'll be staying with me.

404
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,043
May I take your sweater, miss?

405
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:04,255
- Will I get it back?
- Of course, miss!

406
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,843
Annie, what would you like to do first?

407
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,936
The windows, then the floors,
that way if I drip...

408
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:21,230
No. No. Annie.

409
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:25,943

You don't have to do any cleaning here.

410

455

They're just uncrating it, sir.

456
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,695
Hmm.

00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,829

Wait! There's something interesting
in that woman's smile.

462
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:46,930
I might learn to like her.
Hang that in my bathroom.

463
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,223
Uh, Mr. War bucks...

464
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:52,227
No time for dinner tonight. Send out
for an American cheese sandwich.

Come, let's get started.

466
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,814
- Aah!
- Oh!

467
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,858
Oh, no! No!

468
00:37:57,941 --> 00:38:00,068
What the devil's going on here?

469
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,447
Oh, Mr. War bucks, this is the
press representative. Your image.

470
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,074
- Oh. Oh, yes.
- Uh-huh.

471
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,206
Pick him up, Punjab.
Get him another camera.

472
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,136
Why do I smell wet dog?

473
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,767
Because we gave Sandy a bath.

474
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,186
What's this?

475
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:37,815
This is Annie, sir,
the orphan who will be staying with us.

476
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,900
Orphan? What are you talking about?

477
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:44,363
Well, they wanted to take photos of you
sharing your home with an orphan.

478
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:45,739
Only for a week.

479
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,825
This doesn't look like a boy!

480
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,368
Orphans are boys.

481
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:52,996
You didn't say a boy.
You just said an orphan, so I got a girl.

482
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,456
I want a boy!

483
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,502
I've got an interesting smile too, sir.

484
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:01,922
Don't you think
you could learn to like me too, sir?

485
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,550
Hang me in the bathroom?

486
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:08,762
- Take them back now.
- Oh, sir, she just got here.

487
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,390
That's okay, Miss Farrell. We'll be okay.

488
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:17,271
It was nice meeting you anyhow.
I sure do like your place.

489
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:21,608
- Thank you, Annette.
- Annie. I've had a swell time already.

490
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,529
The Asp drove us here
in a car the size of a train.

491
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:28,240
And Punjab put a spell on Sandy.

492
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:31,660
And we made Drake sneeze.
And I played your pipe organ.

493
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:34,913
And Sandy got a bubble bath. And, well,

494
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,125
I've had enough fun
to last me for years.

495
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:41,670
It's a really swell idea
to have an orphan for a week.

496
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,381
A really terrific idea.

497
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:48,051
Even if it's only for your image,
even if I'm not the orphan,

498
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,678
I'm glad you're doing it.

499
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:51,263
I'm glad you approve.

500
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:53,849
Let's get to work!

501
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:57,269
Are you sure you need a boy?
Couldn't she stay?

502
00:39:57,352 --> 00:40:00,647
Whatever, but just for the week.

503
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:06,862
- You know what?
- What?

504
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:10,365
- I love you.
- Ha-ha-ha. I know.

505
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:14,494

- On account of good behavior.

I want you to meet
a little friend of mine. Lily St. Regis.

548
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,342
- Named from the hotel.
- Room service.

549
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:03,223
This afternoon, I put 10 on the nose
of a beautiful horse at 8-1.

550
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:06,476
Sure enough, the scum-bum
took off and whipped the pack.

551
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,936
No kidding?

552
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,105
The thing is, I got delayed,

553
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:13,483
and the joint was closed
before I could cash in.

554
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:18,029
Eighty bucks, sis, first thing
in the morning, guaranteed.

555
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:22,617
All I need is 5 to tide me over.

556
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,830
Not even a nickel for the subway.

557
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:28,748
Oh, come on, sis.

558
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:36,756
I bet Miss Sticky-Fingers here
can loan you a lousy 5 bucks.

559
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,884
I beg your pardon, I'm sure.

Okay, Rooster.

00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:11,249
If I loan you 5 bucks, will you take
this dumb hotel out of here?

564

I'm sorry, sis. Lily.

Come on, Sandy. Come on!

In conclusion,

580
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:03,778
because your country has raised
its voice loud and clear for democracy,

581
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,573
I will extend to you a credit line

582
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:10,160
for the acquisition
of 35 of my new fighter-bombers.

583
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:15,040
That will come with a year's supply
of spare parts, ammunition, and...

584
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,499
What's this?

585
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,587
Sandy's not used to sleeping by himself.
He gets lonesome.

586
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,964
Ah. Uh, where were we?

587
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,257
Oh, um, um, um...

588
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,052
- "Ammunition," sir.
- Are you getting a lot done?

589
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,971
I'd get a lot more done
if certain people...

590
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:36,061
If Franklin Delano Roosevelt
would leave me alone.

591
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,980
- Six calls since I got home.
- What's he want?

592
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,733
My support for the New Deal.
It's laughable.

593
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:44,944
- He is our president, sir.
- Hmm.

594
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,154

Dear Richie, this letter will serve
as confirmation of correspondence

597

concerning the details
of your extended deferment.

598
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:05,340
...On or before September 1.

599
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:09,803
If you cannot meet that deadline,
you will be charged interest.

600
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:14,015
That is, six percent.
Cordially, et cetera.

601
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:22,315
P.S. One of my companies
is developing a bomb-proof glass.

Was that man trying to kill you?

606
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,415
That will be all.

607
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,250
Yes, sir. Come along, dear.

608
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,879
- Who'd want to kill Mr. War bucks?
- Uh, the Bolsheviks, dear.

609
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,465
He's living proof
that the American system works

610
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,510
and the Bolsheviks
don't want anyone to know.

He thought you were drowning.
He was trying to save your life.

614
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:15,368
- Go on, you mutt. Get out of here.
- Come on.

615
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:17,704
Yeah.

616
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:27,922

617
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:30,300
What? Oh, yes.

618
00:49:30,383 --> 00:49:32,135
Miss Farrell picked it out.

619
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:37,015
- Never thought I'd get used to a girl.
- Girls are easier to get used to.

620
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:41,436
Like Miss Farrell,
she does all the work around here.

621
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,064
- You don't even know her first name.
- I do. It's Grace.

622
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,359
She thinks you're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

623
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,278
I beg your pardon.

624
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:54,032
I know it's none of my business,
but you never notice anything.

625
00:49:58,703 --> 00:50:00,288
Sliced bread.

626
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:07,003
Wilhelm, please offer your son
my congratulations on his engagement.

627
00:50:07,086 --> 00:50:09,631
Hold on, Wilhelm. Buy copper.

628
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:16,596
Yes. And tell the crown prince
that my yacht in Monte Carlo

629
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:21,601
is entirely at his disposal for the...

630
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:24,938
Hold on, Wilhelm. More copper.

631
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:29,567
- Don't encourage her, Punjab!
- Maybe I should take her out.

632
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:34,989
- Good idea. Where do you want to go?
- To meet President Roosevelt. Ha, ha.

633
00:50:36,824 --> 00:50:40,370
- How about a movie?
- Pepper went to a movie once.

634
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:42,163
Before she came to the orphanage.

635
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:45,625
She said it was swell,
and Miss Hannigan goes all the time.

636
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:46,584
Splendid.

637
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:51,005
- Take her to the Radio City Music Hall.
- Aren't you going to take me?

638
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:55,051
Me? Ha. Annie, you may think
that Miss Farrell does all the work,

639
00:50:55,134 --> 00:50:56,636
but it's not entirely true.

640
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,138
I'm a busy man, a very busy man.

641
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,225
I know. I didn't mean
to get in the way, Mr. War bucks.

642
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:05,645
Nobody has to take me anywhere.
I'll go practice my backhand.

643
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:15,822
Pepper lies a lot. She probably
hasn't been to a movie either.

644
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:20,410
Actually, I think it's better
when you don't know what you're missing.

645
00:51:23,621 --> 00:51:29,669
Punjab, buy out the 8:00 show.
Let's all go to the movies.

00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,552
You should leave your hair down.
It looks so pretty.

647
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:39,762
No, Annie, I couldn't.

648
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,599

For the "lady of the camellias.”

714
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:47,463
- They're twice as large as usual.
- I'll have twice as many as usual.

715
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:52,385
Twice as many?
I know what those things cost.

716
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:55,680
And when she orders her hats
and dresses from you?

717
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,223
They're an investment.

718
00:57:57,306 --> 00:58:02,228
You won't be young forever.
It's time you settled your future.

719
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,731
And I know the very man for you.

720
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,359
- Really?
- Yes, really.

721
00:58:11,278 --> 00:58:16,158
- No one has ever loved you as I do.
- True, but what can I do about it?

722
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:20,746
You should go away
and not see me anymore.

723
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:30,089
Don't go in anger. Laugh at yourself
a little, as I laugh at myself.

724
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:34,176
Come and talk to me once in a while
in a friendly way.

725
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,388
That's too much and not enough.

726
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:39,473
Believe in love, Marguerite.

727
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,559
So you do love him.

728
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:47,732
Dare to tell me that you love him,
and you're free of me forever.

729
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,527
I love him.

730
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,996
Come in here, all of you.
See this woman? You know her.

731
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,873
Listen to what I'm going to say.

732
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,168
I accepted her favors
because I thought she loved me.

733
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:10,254
Let her make sacrifices
when others had more to give.

734
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:12,673
But bear witness, I owe her nothing.

735
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,593
Take it. Go on, take it.

736
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:19,889
Buy camellias. Buy diamonds.
Buy carriages. Buy a grave.

737
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:26,270
You know how to treat a woman as she
deserves. Like the cheat this one is.

738
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,403
Marguerite.

739
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,030
Armand.

740
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:37,281
Marguerite.

741
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,953
Oh, it's you.

742
00:59:44,955 --> 00:59:46,957
I've been down in the street
half the night,

743
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,752
walking back and forth under your window,

744
00:59:49,835 --> 00:59:53,714
wanting to come up,
but not daring to. I felt so guilty.

745
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,010
Shh. Don't think such things, Marguerite.

746
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,554
Even if we can't
go to the country today,

747
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,725
think of how happy we were once
and how happy we'll be again.

748
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,436
Think of the day
you found a four-leaf clover

749
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,814
and all the good luck
it's going to bring us.

750
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:15,111
Think of the vows that
we're going to make to each other.

751
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,780
This is for life, Marguerite.

752
01:00:21,617 --> 01:00:22,993
Marguerite.

753
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:29,500
Marguerite.

754
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,336
No.

755
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:36,423
No, don't leave me.
Marguerite, come back.

756
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,002
Get her nightgown
behind the bathroom door.

757
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:56,879
Certainly. Certainly.

758
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,502
- Miss Farrell.
- It's all right.

759
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,214
- How did you learn that?
- Learn what?

760
01:02:40,297 --> 01:02:42,216
- That.
- What?

761
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:45,261
- You put her to bed.
- You put her to bed too.

762
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,304
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

763
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,681
Good heavens.

764
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:15,082
That was a wonderful evening
you gave her last night.

765
01:03:15,165 --> 01:03:17,918
I'm gonna have to close
a factory in Pittsburgh.

766
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,296
- About Annie...
- What about Annie?

767
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:22,381
Could we keep her?

768
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:28,429
You haven't seen that orphanage.
I can't bear to send her back there.

769
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:32,141
Get a hold of yourself.
What's come over you?

770
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:35,060
I'd take care of her.
You have plenty of room here.

771
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,645
The staff adores her.

772
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:41,442
- We could take her on as your ward.
- Absolutely not.

773
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:44,236
I'm a businessman. I love money.
I love power. I love capitalism.

774
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,947
I do not now, or never will,
love children.

775
01:03:52,244 --> 01:03:54,955
Watching you with her last night,
I thought maybe...

776
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,040
Grace.

777
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,376
Yes?

778
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:10,971
- I've just noticed something.
- Yes?

779
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,099
You're awfully pretty
when you argue with me.

780
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,855
- Thank you, sir.
- Oliver.

781
01:04:21,982 --> 01:04:23,108
Oliver.

782
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:31,617
Do you really just love money
and power and capitalism?

783
01:04:33,577 --> 01:04:35,412
They'll never love you back.

784
01:04:36,246 --> 01:04:39,666
- Your teeth are crooked.
- I'll have them fixed.

785
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:44,004
- I like them crooked.
- I'll leave them.

786
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:45,672
Thank you.

787
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,427
I could have the papers
signed this morning.

788
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:54,014
- Grace.
- Oliver.

789
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,142
It means a great deal to you, doesn't it?

790
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,938
Yes, it means a great deal to me.

791
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:03,273
I'll do it myself.

792
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,780
Oh! I could just kiss you!

793
01:05:13,742 --> 01:05:14,993
- Grace.
- Yes?

794
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,870
Get her a little gift.

795
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,705
That's a good idea.

796
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,916
Something from Tiffany's. A new locket.

797
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:27,131
Be careful at that orphanage.
That woman's got claws and fangs.

798
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:40,853
Annie.

799
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:43,981

01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:50,988

- No.
- Let me have it.

824

Get inside!

825
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:56,506
I've seen his picture in the paper
with President Roosevelt.

826
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:12,689
- Hannigan, I presume?
- Yes.

827
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:14,524
I want to talk to you about Annie.

828
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:19,905
You want to return her
and forget it, or trade up?

829
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:21,531
I want to adopt her.

830
01:09:22,949 --> 01:09:24,868
Would you excuse me for a moment?

831
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,963
- Would you care to step into my office?
- Thank you.

Where is she?

886
01:12:56,955 --> 01:13:00,292
- I hear the car.
- It's probably not the right car.

887
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:03,962
It's the Duesenberg.
Miss Farrell took the Duesenberg.

888

What took you so long?
What's happening here?

889
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,133
Where's Annie?

890
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:11,261
She's taking her karate lesson
with the Asp.

891
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:14,806
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not. You give it to her.

892
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,310
- It was your idea.
- She likes you better than me.

893
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,687
Oliver, will you pull yourself together?

894
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:31,364
Mr. War bucks, want to see
what the Asp taught me today?

895
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,616
Hi-yah!

896
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:33,950
Oh!

897
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,537
To the couch, Punjab, if you please.

898
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:42,208
- Oh, gee. I didn't think it would work.
- Now you know it does.

899
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,086
- Shall I call a doctor?
- Oh, it'll be fine.

900
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,379
Punjab.

901
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:52,302
Ah.

902
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:56,556
Thank you.

903
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,312
We'll leave you two alone.

904
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:18,411
Annie, I want to talk to you
about something very serious.

905
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:23,792
- You don't want me anymore, right?
- On the contrary, I do.

906
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,377
Good Lord.

907
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:29,589
Annie, can we have a man-to-man talk?

908
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:30,715
Sure.

909
01:14:31,716 --> 01:14:36,179
What I'm proposing would
involve a long-term, um, agreement.

910
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,098
Actually,

911
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:41,518
maybe you ought to know more about me
before you make up your mind.

912
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,064
- Okay.
- Let's go for a walk.

913
01:14:46,147 --> 01:14:47,232
Okay.

914
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:53,029
I was born in Liverpool
in a railroad switch house.

915
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:58,243
My brother died of pneumonia because
we didn't have money for medicine.

916
01:15:00,328 --> 01:15:05,208
Well, I decided then and there
that one day I would be very rich.

917
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:06,584
Good idea.

918
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,754
In those days,
America was the land of opportunity.

919
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,425
I sighed on a ship as cabin boy
when I was 12.

920
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:16,803
By the time I was 21,
I'd made my first million.

921
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:20,223
In the next 10 years,
I turned that into 100 million.

922
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:21,474
-Wow.

923
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:26,271
In those days, that was a lot of money.
I was ruthless, hurt a lot of people.

924
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:31,609
Making money was all I ever
gave a damn about, up to now.

925
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,489
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

926
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:43,496
It's occurred to me that
no matter how many houses I have,

927
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,041
how many Rembrandts,
how many Duesenbergs,

928
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:52,172
unless I have someone to share it with,
well, I might as well be broke.

929
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:54,632
Annie, do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

930
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:55,925
Sure.
Good.

931
01:15:56,968 --> 01:15:58,261
Kind of.

932
01:15:58,344 --> 01:16:00,764
- Kind of?
- I guess not.

933
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:03,266
Damn. Oh, excuse me.

934
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:17,280
- You've given me so much already.
- I got the papers signed. It's official.

935
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,282
What is?

936
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:24,579
It's so pretty, but...

937
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:26,873
- Let me put it on you.
- No.

938
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:33,505
It's a swell locket, but if it's
all the same, I'll keep my old one.

939
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:34,464
It isn't all the same.

940
01:16:34,547 --> 01:16:36,716
Your old one's broken.
This one is engraved.

941
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:42,931
You didn't even look. "To Annie.
With love from Daddy War bucks."

942
01:16:43,973 --> 01:16:48,436
Mr. War bucks, when my folks left me
at the orphanage 10 years ago,

943
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,149
they left a note saying they'd come back
to get me as soon as they could.

944
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:58,655
They kept the other half of this locket
so I'd know them when they came.

945
01:16:58,738 --> 01:17:03,034
I'm going to find them someday
and have a regular mother and father

946
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,037
like a regular kid. I am.

947
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,042
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.

948
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:14,254
You've been nicer to me
than anybody in the whole world.

949
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:19,217
But I've been dreaming of my folks
for as long as I can remember.

950
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,636
And I've just got to find them.

951
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,935
And I'll help you.

I'd like to introduce
a little orphan named Annie.

977
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:22,173
Hey. Who's that who just walked into
our Red Network studios?

978
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:26,177
Well, it's none other than the Wall Street
tycoon, Oliver War bucks!

979
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:36,521
"Thank you, Bert Healy.
It's swell..." Do I say swell?

980
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:39,649
"Swell to be on the lodent Hour."

981
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:43,236
I understand you're conducting

982
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:46,322
Yeah, I told you that
before we went on the air. Oh, yes!

983
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:52,412
"Bert Healy, I am now conducting
a coast-to-coast, nationwide search

984
01:19:52,495 --> 01:19:53,955

985

They never miss.

1039
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:49,690
Everybody's going to get their chance.

1040
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,905
Annie, it's your mother.

1041
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:03,287
We've got to get her out of here.

1042
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:06,749
- We can't expose her to this.
- Get the autocopter ready.

1043
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,521
Wow.

1044
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:33,109
Annie, guess what. Mr. War bucks
is going to take you to see the president.

1045
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,278
Oh, boy!

1046
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:02,221
Marvelous!
Aren't Republicans ostentatious?

1047
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:06,309
Franklin, behave.
It's astonishing he's here at all.

1048
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:14,025
What do you call this thing, Oliver?
It looks like great fun.

1049
01:25:14,108 --> 01:25:15,568
An autocopter.

1050
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:19,155
You don't need an airport,
just a backyard.

1051
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:21,699
They say it can land on a dime.

1052
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:23,326
Whatever that may be.

1053
01:25:24,368 --> 01:25:26,704
I appreciate you coming.
It means a great deal.

1054
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:32,793
It means nothing. It means only
that Annie wanted to meet you.

1055
01:25:35,546 --> 01:25:38,299
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. President Roosevelt.

1056
01:25:38,924 --> 01:25:40,926
It's my pleasure, Annie.

1057
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:44,847
And thank you for bringing the old goat.
Make a New Dealer of him yet.

1058
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:47,725
- Inconceivable.
- Don't mind him, Oliver.

1059
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:49,518
Come along, Annie.

1060
01:25:50,227 --> 01:25:55,608
My Uncle Theodore used to teach
his children to walk on stilts.

1061
01:25:55,691 --> 01:25:59,654
I can't teach you that, but I can
teach you to roll in a chair with wheels.

1062
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,530
It's my own private roller coaster.

1063
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:06,827
The New Deal is badly planned,
badly organized and administered.

1064
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:09,413
You don't think your
programs through, Franklin.

1065
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:13,084
Think what they're going to do
to the economy in the long run!

1066
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:17,171
- People don't eat in the long run.
- People can't feed their children.

1067
01:26:17,254 --> 01:26:19,590
The lucky ones end up in orphanages.

1068
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,218
The older ones
are abandoned to steal, starve.

1069
01:26:22,301 --> 01:26:25,054
This business of this country
is business. You have to...

1070
01:26:25,137 --> 01:26:29,642
Take them off the dole and
put them to work. That's what I'll do.

1071
01:26:29,725 --> 01:26:35,731
In the National Parks, clearing trails,
fighting fires, planting trees.

1072
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:38,859
- Hold it.
- I want to feed them and house them

1073
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:40,111
and pay them.

1074
01:26:40,194 --> 01:26:42,363
Enough to send home to their parents

1075
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:46,617
so they can hold their heads up
and be proud to be Americans.

1076
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,037
- That's a swell idea.
- It isn't a swell idea, Annie,

1077
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:51,997
it's mistaken foolishness.

1078
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:54,417
Big-hearted and empty-headed.

1079
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,795
Which parks? Which children?
What will it cost?

1080
01:26:58,629 --> 01:27:01,048
Who's going to organize it?
Who's going to run it?

1081
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:06,429
- I, uh, was hoping you would.
- Me?

1082
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:07,638
And Annie.

1083
01:27:08,764 --> 01:27:10,474
Leaping lizards!

1084
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,978
- Out of the question.
- How could I help?

1085
01:27:14,061 --> 01:27:15,521
Wait a minute.

1086
01:27:15,604 --> 01:27:18,774
- You could help us recruit young people.
- Hold everything!

1087
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:23,237
Many of them think their government
doesn't care whether they live or die.

1088
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,574
With your help, we could
convince them that with a little effort...

1089
01:27:26,657 --> 01:27:28,367
I want to say something.

1090
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:33,164
There's this song I used to sing
in the orphanage when I'd get sad.

1091
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:35,166
- It always cheered me up.
- Eleanor.

- Yeah?
- Excuse me. Do you run this establishment?

1136
01:30:24,209 --> 01:30:25,544
Unfortunately.

1137
01:30:25,628 --> 01:30:29,673
Ten years ago, we left our
little baby girl on the front steps.

1138
01:30:30,382 --> 01:30:36,180
We were starving. There was a job managing
a hotel, but only if we had no children.

1139
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:38,432
Wrap it up. I'm listening to Helen Trent.

1140
01:30:38,515 --> 01:30:41,268
We never meant to leave our little Annie.

1141
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:42,770
Annie?

1142
01:30:42,853 --> 01:30:46,857
Now we have a hardware store
in New Jersey. We could take care of her.

1143
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,567
We've always loved her.

1144
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,153
You're Annie's parents?

1145
01:30:51,236 --> 01:30:54,823
Our place isn't fancy, but it's home.
We live over the store.

1146
01:30:55,532 --> 01:30:58,577
- There's a yard out back.
- We have chickens.

1147
01:30:58,661 --> 01:30:59,954
And a rooster.

1148
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:06,126
Rooster?

1149
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:15,344
My God! I never would have recognized you.

1150
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:16,887
Hurry.

1151
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:22,851
Sis, if we can fool you,
we can fool "Big Bucks."

1152
01:31:23,894 --> 01:31:27,898
- Fifty thousand smackers.
- You're gonna be the death of me.

1153
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:32,778
Oh, come on, sis. This is going to be
the best bunco job ever.

1154
01:31:32,861 --> 01:31:36,991
- All we need is details.
- About Annie. Specifics.

1155
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:37,908
I see.

1156
01:31:38,617 --> 01:31:43,497
- What's in it for me?
- A three-way split of the $50,000.

1157
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,082
- I want half.
- Half?

1158
01:31:45,165 --> 01:31:46,458
- Half!
- All right, half!

1159
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:48,127
- Rooster!
- All right!

1160
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:53,716
Twenty-five grand for me and Lil,
25 grand for you.

1161
01:31:54,341 --> 01:31:55,342
Hey!

1162
01:31:56,427 --> 01:32:00,264
Why don't we wait
and see what she's got, huh?

1163
01:32:00,347 --> 01:32:03,517
See if it's worth 25 grand.

1164
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,396
You want details? I got details.

1165
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:10,190
I got specifics on every kid in this dump.

1166
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:12,651
It's just a question
of finding the right box.

1167
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:13,777
Ha!

1168
01:32:15,362 --> 01:32:18,741
Annie wears a locket around her neck.

1169
01:32:20,367 --> 01:32:21,785
It's a broken locket.

1170
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:26,915
She says her parents saved the other half
to someday come and claim her with.

1171
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:30,002
Well, years ago,

1172
01:32:30,085 --> 01:32:33,130
years and years ago,
her parents were killed in a fire.

1173
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:35,758
And the cops brought me all their junk.

1174
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:38,135
Well, my darling baby brother,

1175
01:32:38,218 --> 01:32:42,973
if Annie's parents can claim her
with that locket, so can we.

1176
01:32:43,682 --> 01:32:45,809
Fifty thousand smackers!

1177
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:48,270
And the kid,
we'll drop in the river.

1178
01:32:48,353 --> 01:32:52,066
They're going to do
something bad to Annie! Pepper!

1179
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:55,277
- Have you cleaned the can?
- Listen to me. I mean it.

1180
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,862
Clean the can!

1181
01:32:56,945 --> 01:33:01,617
- Duffy, Tessie, somebody!
- Do you want a knuckle sandwich?

1182
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,203
- We've gotta warn Annie!

Ow!

1227
01:37:34,514 --> 01:37:36,516
Duffy, Tessie, somebody!

1228
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,518
They're going to do
something bad to Annie!

1229
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:40,479
- Who is?
- They are!

1230
01:37:40,562 --> 01:37:42,481
- Who's they?
- Miss Hannigan.

1231
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:44,358
Oh, my goodness!

1232
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:49,863
Beautiful.

1233
01:37:57,371 --> 01:38:01,083
- Where do you think you're going?
- Run, run, go tell Annie!

1234
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:04,336
Stop them!

1235
01:38:13,178 --> 01:38:14,554
Get in that closet.

1236
01:38:16,473 --> 01:38:17,849
Stop it!

1237
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:26,233
Whose rotten idea was this?

1238
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:04,271
Are they here?
Did they bring me a brother and sister?

1239
01:39:04,354 --> 01:39:08,400
A man who counts his chickens
before they hatch gets a scrambled egg.

1240
01:39:08,483 --> 01:39:09,484
What?

1241
01:39:13,947 --> 01:39:15,907
Have my parents come for me?

1242
01:39:17,742 --> 01:39:19,369
We haven't found them, Annie.

1243
01:39:45,395 --> 01:39:50,609
I interviewed 865 couples.
None of them knew about the locket.

1244
01:39:51,818 --> 01:39:55,155
I never realized how many
dishonest people there are in New York.

1245
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:23,058
I guess they're dead. I guess I've
known that deep down for a long time.

1246
01:40:23,141 --> 01:40:25,310
I'm not giving up. Don't you give up.

1247
01:40:26,436 --> 01:40:31,233
I didn't want to be just another orphan.
I wanted to believe I was special.

1248
01:40:31,316 --> 01:40:35,195
You are special.
Never stop believing that.

1249
01:40:36,696 --> 01:40:38,114
We're trapped.

1250
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:41,076
Shh!

1251
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:46,706
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

1252
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:47,749
Poor Annie.

1253
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:51,628
- We'll never get out of here.
- I've got an idea.

1254
01:40:54,172 --> 01:40:56,174
That's a great idea.

1255
01:40:58,885 --> 01:41:01,137
- It's heavy.
- Don't drop it.

1256
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:08,019
- All right. Shh!
- Now what do you want to do?

1257
01:41:11,022 --> 01:41:15,026
She'll be so mad
if she catches us.

1258
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:17,612
I'm not so sure
if I want to do this.

1259
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,656
We're gonna be in so much trouble.

1260
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:22,576
- Duffy, hand me something.
- Here.

1261
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,629
- There's space up here.
- Be careful.

1262
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:39,009
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

1263
01:41:39,926 --> 01:41:41,219
Help me get up.

1264
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:52,897
Give me your hand.

1265
01:41:57,193 --> 01:42:00,488
It's a long way down.
Are you sure you want to do this?

1266
01:42:05,076 --> 01:42:06,786
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

1267
01:42:26,806 --> 01:42:32,520
We were starving. We needed the job.
That's why we left our little girl.

1268
01:42:32,604 --> 01:42:35,190
Wrapped in a newspaper.

1269
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:38,610
On the steps
of the Hudson St. Orphanage.

1270
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:48,828
What's this?

1271
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:50,872
Mr. War bucks,
this is Ralph and Shirley Mudge

1272
01:42:50,955 --> 01:42:52,332
from Hoboken, New Jersey.

1273
01:42:52,415 --> 01:42:53,458
Annie!

1274
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:56,670
Oh!

1275
01:42:57,962 --> 01:42:59,964
Oh, Ralph, look.

1276
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:03,176
She still has the locket.

1277
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:20,068
We finally found you.

1278
01:43:20,151 --> 01:43:22,904
I suppose you heard about the reward
on the radio.

1279
01:43:22,987 --> 01:43:25,573
- Reward?
- We don't have a radio.

1280
01:43:25,657 --> 01:43:27,492
- In the paper.
- Paper?

1281
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:30,286
- What paper?
- How did you know Annie was here?

1282
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:33,206
That kind lady at the orphanage told us.

1283
01:43:33,289 --> 01:43:35,709
I have her birth certificate right here.

1284
01:43:37,252 --> 01:43:42,424
I've kept it close to my heart
all these years.

1285
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,221
"Ann Marie Mudge.

1286
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:53,768
October 18, 1922."

1287
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:01,317
I'll go pack.

1288
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:06,740
Do you want me to help, baby?

1289
01:44:08,867 --> 01:44:09,993
No, thanks...

1290
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:12,537
Mom.

1291
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:44,652
Come on.

1292
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:03,671
A certified check.

1293
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:08,718
Oh, sir, we're just so thrilled
to have found Annie.

1294
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:10,053
We don't need any money.

1295
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:16,142
- I'll take it back.
- Of course, we are poor people.

1296
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:18,645
It would help us a lot.

1297
01:45:19,562 --> 01:45:24,651
We could buy her milk, a warm blanket.

1298
01:45:26,277 --> 01:45:30,323
Put it in your pocket, Mrs. Mudge.

1299
01:45:36,037 --> 01:45:37,413
Come on, you guys.

1300
01:45:39,999 --> 01:45:43,795
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!

1301
01:45:43,878 --> 01:45:45,380
We're never gonna make it.

1302
01:45:45,463 --> 01:45:49,843
- We've found Fifth Avenue.
- Number one, Fifth Avenue.

1303
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:52,554
We gotta go to 987.

1304
01:45:54,389 --> 01:45:57,934
Molly, get on my back.
Come on, you guys, help.

1305
01:46:02,188 --> 01:46:06,234
- Will the stores take this back?
- All your new clothes?

1306
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:10,488
Well, I guess so, Annie.
Don't you want to keep them?

1307
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:16,327
My folks are poor. All these clothes
are going to make them feel bad.

1308
01:46:16,411 --> 01:46:19,747
Could you take them to the orphanage
and give them to my friends?

1309
01:46:20,874 --> 01:46:21,749
Certainly.

1310
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,752
This will look so cute on Molly.

1311
01:46:27,922 --> 01:46:29,465

Let me see it.

- You know, I think I'd better hold it.
- Over my dead body.

1331
01:48:45,393 --> 01:48:47,937
That's the brightest thing
I've ever heard you say.

1332
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:50,064
Ladies! Ladies!

1333
01:48:50,148 --> 01:48:53,317
- Help, Mr. War bucks! Help!
- Get on the road!

1334
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,075
We'll never find the house.

1335
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:04,120
I wish I'd been
outside in New York City.

1336
01:49:07,165 --> 01:49:08,791
When do I get my half?

1337
01:49:14,589 --> 01:49:16,966
- I say we go back.
- We can't.

1338
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:19,302
We've been walking for 100 years!

1339
01:49:19,385 --> 01:49:23,556
- We're never going to get there.
- But we have to.

1340
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:28,811
- Let's take a vote.
- All in favor of calling it quits?

1341
01:49:31,355 --> 01:49:34,150
I'll get me one of those
little gold lamé numbers.

1342
01:49:34,233 --> 01:49:35,735
In Atlantic City.

1343
01:49:35,818 --> 01:49:38,404
We aren't stopping
till we hit Atlantic City.

1344
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,241
Whoo.

1345
01:49:43,576 --> 01:49:47,080
- Help, Mr. War bucks! It's Miss Hannigan!
- Shut up, kid.

1346
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,836
Look, there's Sandy!

1347
01:49:57,215 --> 01:49:59,759
Come here! Come here!

1348
01:50:07,683 --> 01:50:09,852
Come on, let's go!

1349
01:50:11,813 --> 01:50:15,650
- Hurry up.
- Hurry! Hurry!

1350
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:19,403
I can't run anymore.

1351
01:50:31,874 --> 01:50:34,210
All right, quiet down, girls.

1352
01:50:35,378 --> 01:50:39,048
You want to see Mr. War bucks?
All right, come on.

1353
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,206
Oh, my goodness!

1354
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:38,900
- What now?
- Sir.

1355
01:51:39,525 --> 01:51:42,653
- I think he's a highness.
- Your Highness.

1356
01:51:42,737 --> 01:51:45,740
- We're friends of Annie's.
- Annie's gone.

1357
01:51:46,365 --> 01:51:48,534
Her parents came and took her away.

1358
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:51,078
But they wasn't her real parents, mister.

1359
01:51:51,162 --> 01:51:54,957
- They was bad people.
- Leaping lizards!

1360
01:51:59,962 --> 01:52:02,715
You take the autocopter,
I'll take the car.

1361
01:52:02,798 --> 01:52:07,929
J. Edgar? War bucks here.
Orphan Annie has been kidnapped.

1362
01:52:08,012 --> 01:52:12,016
I want every G-man east of the Mississippi
on this in the next 20 minutes.

1363
01:52:14,644 --> 01:52:16,229
Where's the fire, fellas?

1364
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,044
Sahib.

1365
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:26,882
Sahib, the truck is on Canal Street,
heading east.

1366
01:53:26,966 --> 01:53:31,262
East on Canal.
Well done, Punjab. Don't lose them now.

1367
01:53:34,265 --> 01:53:38,561
Excuse me, mister.
