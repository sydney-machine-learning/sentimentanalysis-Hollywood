1
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,063
Admiral Yamamoto, please.

2
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,065
He asked not
to be disturbed.

3
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,817
It is most urgent.

4
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,632
Admiral Yamamoto?

5
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,343
Tokyo has been bombed.

6
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,469
When?

7
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,054
Ten minutes ago, Admiral.

8
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,514
Yokohama, Kawasaki
and Yokosuka were also bombed.

9
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,351
His Imperial Majesty
is unharmed, sir.

10
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,937
I personally
phoned the palace. The Emperor is safe.

11
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,272
Damage?

12
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,565
Very little to Tokyo.

13
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,317
The other cities
haven't reported in yet,

14
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,196
but it seems probable
that they too were barely scratched.

15
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,282
How did they
do it, Watanabe?

16
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,159
They launched
long-range land-based bombers

17
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,370
from their carriers,
B-25s.

18
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,330
They came in
at treetop level,

19
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,041
they weren't even
seen until they were over the city.

20
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,293
Tokyo... Bombed!

21
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,504
Sir, I understand
your deep concern

22
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,714
for the Emperor's
safety, but...

23
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,883
You may speak freely,
Commander.

24
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,886
Sir, this raid
is a blessing in disguise.

25
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,180
The Americans have done us
an invaluable service.

26
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,598
They have
proven you correct.

27
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,017
Our homeland is not
invulnerable to attack.

28
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,727
After today,
there will be no more

29
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,521
foot-dragging
by the general staff.

30
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,149
Now they will
certainly approve your Operation M-I.

31
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,782
ANNOUNCER ON RADIO:
Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle

32
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,077
led the raid with
a force of 16 B-25s

33
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,663
and an all-volunteer
crew of airmen.

34
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,834
Most of the planes
carried three 500-pound demolition bombs

35
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,003
and single
incendiary clusters,

36
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,838
which were
dropped on oil stores,

37
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:43,092
factory areas
and on some of the military installations of Tokyo.

38
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,888
A few planes went on to
make minor strikes on Kobe, Yokohama and Nagoya,

39
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:52,059
with one bomb
hitting the Japanese aircraft carrier Ryujo.

40
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,312
News of the raid has had
a most heartening effect on American morale

41
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,273
and the morale
of our allies,

42
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,026
while at the same time
constituting a blow

43
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,361
to the prestige
of the Japanese.

44
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,246
Yes, sir.

45
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,169
ANNOUNCER ON RADIO:
At his press conference today,

46
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,963
President Roosevelt was asked
the following questions,

47
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,051
quote, "Mr. President,
couldn't you tell us about that bombing?

48
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,762
"Where did those
planes start from and go to?"

49
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,307
He replied,
"Yes, the time has now come to tell you.

50
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,311
"They came from
our new secret base at Shangri-La." Unquote.

51
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,981
Well, my God,
it's Captain Garth!

52
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,401
I was expecting some
junior intelligence officer. Not air ops himself.

53
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,736
Well, this is
an unexpected honor.

54
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,571
Yeah, like hell
it is, Joe!

55
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,490
Admiral Nimitz
sent me over here...

56
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,617
To chew out
my ass, huh?

57
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,788
Officially, Joe,
I'm supposed to question that estimate

58
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,040
of Japanese intentions
you sent over.

59
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,583
Why so grim, Matt?

60
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,251
My God, I should think
that Doolittle attack

61
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,088
would have you CINCPAC people
dancing in the streets.

62
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,591
Not by a long shot.
That damn raid could boomerang on us.

63
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,634
The fleet's
still crippled.

64
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,761
We only got four carriers
in the whole Pacific.

65
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,513
We need time
to rebuild.

66
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,933
Now the boss is afraid
Yamamoto's going to jump right back at us.

67
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,184
Question is, "Where?"

68
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,188
Well, we got
all the latest intercepts right over here.

69
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,610
Here's a list
of Japanese ships

70
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,322
that we suspect
are gonna be assigned

71
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:32,159
to amphib operations
south of Rabaul.

72
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,869
The Coral Sea!

73
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,790
That's where we think
they'll strike next.

74
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,836
But something else
is stirring, something out our way.

75
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,296
Joe, we need facts,
not guesswork.

76
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,090
Matt, we've cracked
Yamamoto's staff level code.

77
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,174
I know.

78
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,718
But that don't mean
we just reel it off word for word like a song.

79
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,929
We get a flicker here
and a glimmer there.

80
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,430
Missing pieces
fall into place. These interceptions...

81
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,723
How much
can you decipher?

82
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,642
Hell, 15 maybe...

83
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,060
Really decipher.

84
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,563
10%.
10...

85
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:05,192
That's one word in ten.
For Christ's sakes, Joe, you're guessing!

86
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,156
We like to
call it "analysis."

87
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,158
All right.

88
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,285
What are these
indications you got

89
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,412
of something brewing
back our way?

90
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,164
Got no
hard clues yet.

91
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,915
What do
you have, Joe?

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,627
An increase in radio traffic
between Yamamoto's staff commanders.

93
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:24,837
And that's all?

94
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,255
Could be
significant.

95
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,092
At least I feel that
something is stirring.

96
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,594
All right.

97
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,013
I'll take that list
of Jap warships

98
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,098
you feel are heading
for Coral Sea.

99
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,767
Nimitz may wanna send
Jack Fletcher's task force down there

100
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,687
to find out what
the hell is going on.

101
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,940
We'll see how
your 10% guesswork pays off, huh?

102
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:50,070
As for the Black
Chamber code-crackers, I thank you, Matt.

103
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,365
Hey, Joe, could I ask you
something personal, very personal?

104
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,867
Certainly.

105
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,162
You know, it really
stinks down here.

106
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,831
How often do
some of your people take a bath?

107
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,376
Bath? My God,
I don't know... What day is it?

108
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,046
Forget it, Joe.

109
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,929
Any new
Yamamoto intercepts?

110
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,557
Here's a first mention
of something they're calling "AF,"

111
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,142
whatever that means.

112
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,436
AF?

113
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,341
MAN: Captain!

114
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,721
Tom?
Dad.

115
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,684
My God, Tom.

116
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,937
When did you get in?
I didn't know...

117
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,814
Last night.

118
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,233
This is beautiful.

119
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,194
Why didn't
you write me you were coming?

120
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,071
I've been assigned
to Kaneohe.

121
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,200
Well, I'll finally get
to see something of you.

122
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,954
Three years!
You look great, Tom.

123
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,081
Really great.

124
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,749
So do you, Dad.

125
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,048
Kaneohe, huh?
What squadron?

126
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,466
VF-8.

127
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,928
You'll like it
out there.

128
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,765
Your CO used to be
my wingman when we were flying off the old Langley.

129
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,352
Could we talk somewhere?

130
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,604
Sure. Here.

131
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,324
I phoned you from Guam,
the day you graduated.

132
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,492
Yeah, I heard later.

133
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,619
Sorry I missed
the call.

134
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,123
I guess
your mother was there.

135
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,083
Yeah.

136
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,543
How is she?

137
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,173
Recovered from
the divorce, I guess.

138
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,758
Oh, that's good.

139
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,053
I was hoping
maybe we could...

140
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,346
Dad...

141
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,395
I've fallen in love
with a Japanese girl.

142
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,066
I want to marry her.

143
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,237
I need your help.

144
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,159
I damn well guess
you do, tiger.

145
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,954
She's been arrested
here in Honolulu.

146
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,874
How the hell
did you manage that?

147
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,210
Training in San Diego
and getting mixed up

148
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,420
with a Japanese girl
here in Honolulu?

149
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,090
She was a student
at San Diego State. I met her there.

150
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,259
Wait a minute.
She was arrested here in Honolulu?

151
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,719
Her parents live here.

152
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:04,098
She wouldn't marry me
without their consent, so she came out to see them.

153
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,851
Apparently,
the FBI has some sort of information on her folks,

154
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,978
so the Army
picked her up, too.

155
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,313
Well, that figures.

156
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,607
Haruko was born here.

157
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,609
She's as loyal
as either you or me.

158
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,570
Anyway,

159
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,825
the minute I got in,
I went off to see where they're being held.

160
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,119
She wouldn't see me.

161
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,495
Why not?

162
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,621
I don't know.

163
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,167
But I did find out
that she and her parents are gonna be sent back

164
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,628
to the mainland
in a few days.

165
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,426
Sticks in your throat,
doesn't it,

166
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,010
my wanting to marry
a Japanese girl?

167
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:46,598
Sticks in your...
Look, don't give me any of that racial bigot crap.

168
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,934
I don't care
what color your girl is.

169
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,018
That's not the point...

170
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,062
Christ Almighty!

171
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,692
Six months after Pearl Harbor.
Boy, you have one lousy sense of timing.

172
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,491
What's her name?

173
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,994
I'll see if I can
get hold of the FBI report on her.

174
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,997
I wrote it down for you.
Haruko Sakura.

175
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,960
But promise me
one thing,

176
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,295
just don't do
anything stupid

177
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,381
till I see
what I can get hold of on this, huh?

178
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,258
That's a deal.

179
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,794
In my opinion,
this entire plan is not only unnecessary,

180
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,922
but doomed to fail.

181
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,841
Admiral Kondo,
Operation M-I has been conceived

182
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,552
by our most
brilliant strategist.

183
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,138
We are all aware of
Captain Kuroshima's

184
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,475
authorship, Commander,
and his reputation.

185
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,104
But this time,
the God of operations has conceived a monster.

186
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,650
Would you please
explain, sir?

187
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,987
How am I expected to land
my invasion forces on Midway,

188
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:28,283
unless the enemy airfields
and shore batteries have been neutralized?

189
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,703
Sir, you've heard
Admiral Nagumo say that his carriers

190
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,206
will obliterate
the American defenses at Midway.

191
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,750
The enemy's
land-based bombers

192
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,670
have a range
of at least 400 miles more

193
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,838
than Nagumo's carrier planes.

194
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,049
His ships would be
blown out of the sea

195
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,343
before he could
launch his attack.

196
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,763
I took my carriers to Hawaii,
where the risk was far greater

197
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,349
and destroyed
the American fleet.

198
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,143
Where were the enemy
land-based bombers then?

199
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,021
That was then,
Nagumo, not now.

200
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,608
A surprise attack
with a carrier task force is one thing.

201
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,153
But this,
a strike against Midway and the Aleutians

202
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,615
with 200 ships
and 100,000 men.

203
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,872
Does the idea of
taking the Aleutians

204
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,000
cause you any
concern, Hosogaya?

205
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,085
No, sir.

206
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,381
But an operation
so large, so complex,

207
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,925
I'd like more time
to study it.

208
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,261
After all,
in a matter of hours,

209
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,179
our Coral Sea operation
will be starting.

210
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,141
We have sufficient
forces for both.

211
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,478
I tend to agree
with Admirals Kondo and Hosogaya, sir.

212
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,568
May I suggest we meet again
after the Coral Sea campaign?

213
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,571
Very well.

214
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,324
Meanwhile, gentlemen,
please consider this,

215
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,660
the Americans
are still unprepared and outnumbered.

216
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,872
If their fleet,
particularly their aircraft carriers,

217
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,832
can be lured into
battle and defeated,

218
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,128
they will then have
no significant naval force left in the Pacific.

219
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,380
They will be compelled
to sue for peace.

220
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,885
I have traveled widely
in America, my friends.

221
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,722
Their industrial
might is awesome.

222
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,768
I'm convinced
our only hope for victory

223
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,104
is one massive strike
at Midway.

224
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,055
Say, Joe, what about
this hot information of yours?

225
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,390
You sure
it can't wait?

226
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,809
I already got
one headache for the boss.

227
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,936
I consider
this urgent.

228
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,063
And you were right
about Coral Sea.

229
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,023
That's where
the Japs were, all right.

230
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,025
Every ship
on your list was there.

231
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,777
Did we get hurt?

232
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,654
We got hurt.

233
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,707
Welcome home, Admiral.
How was your flight?

234
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,209
Long and strewn
with potholes.

235
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,669
Got Fletcher's
Coral Sea report?

236
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,753
Right here, sir.

237
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:27,879
Right.

238
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,724
Get in the back, Joe.
But wait till I cue you in.

239
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,567
Here's Admiral Fletcher's
preliminary report, sir.

240
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,944
We lost
the Lexington.

241
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,823
What did we do
to the enemy?

242
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,742
We sank one of
their light carriers,

243
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,368
one of their big
first-line jobs

244
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,203
and some of
their smaller ships.

245
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,331
Looks like
we just about broke even, Admiral.

246
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,711
We can't trade
the Japanese carrier for carrier, Matt.

247
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,506
We started out
with a three-to-one superiority.

248
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,844
With the Lexington gone,
the Saratoga laid up,

249
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,389
all we've got
is Hornet, Enterprise and the Yorktown

250
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,183
to counter
Yamamoto's next move.

251
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,479
Sir, Yorktown
was heavily damaged at Coral Sea.

252
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,856
There's the
follow-up report.

253
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,654
Admiral, Commander Rochefort
has something urgent, he says.

254
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,116
It's about
Objective AF, sir, the meaning of AF.

255
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,037
Now, our listening posts
have been picking up lot of traffic

256
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,331
between Yamamoto's
flag commanders.

257
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,708
There has been
a very heavy volume of traffic, sir,

258
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,420
with recurrent references
to Objective AF and... What was it?

259
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,963
AO.
AO. Yeah.

260
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,800
AO is still
a mystery, Admiral, maybe a diversion.

261
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,135
But I think
we've identified Objective AF.

262
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,595
It's Midway.

263
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,097
Now, it had us
really stymied there,

264
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,017
until one of my men
remembered an enemy intercept

265
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,769
we decoded
last March.

266
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,479
Now, a Jap
reconnaissance pilot

267
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,190
radioed his base that
he's passing close to AF.

268
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,735
Now, we've plotted
every possible course his plane might have taken,

269
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,904
and the only
appreciable landmass

270
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,031
he could have overflown
at the time was Midway.

271
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,157
Joe!

272
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,325
I know it's thin.

273
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,994
Thin?
Damn near invisible!

274
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,206
But I figured out
a way to confirm it, sir.

275
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,417
If you'll have this
flown to Midway.

276
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,128
It's a fake
message, Admiral,

277
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:36,132
reporting that Midway's
freshwater condenser's broken down.

278
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,844
Now, it should be
transmitted in the clear,

279
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,178
so there can't be
any question about

280
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,764
Japanese operators
getting every word of it.

281
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,017
Instruct Midway
to include that

282
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,520
in their housekeeping
traffic tomorrow.

283
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,022
Aye-aye, sir.

284
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,717
Send this right away.

285
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,429
Hey, Chief!
What's this?

286
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,057
There ain't nothing wrong
with our freshwater condenser!

287
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,309
I was just over there.

288
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,436
Dombrowski, send it.

289
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,527
Christ,
I think the goddamn heat's getting to everybody here.

290
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,549
Have this intercept
coded and transmitted to fleet headquarters!

291
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,873
They took
the bait, Admiral.

292
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,502
Rochefort's just decoded
a transmission from Kwajalein

293
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,962
to Yamamoto's
fleet headquarters.

294
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,424
Reads,
"AF is having trouble with its freshwater condenser."

295
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,051
AF has to be
Midway Island.

296
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,556
Be at my office
at 0500, Matt.

297
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,016
I'm calling in
the whole staff.

298
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,685
Aye-aye, sir.

299
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,730
This is how I expect
the battle to develop.

300
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,567
The northern force,
under Admiral Hosogaya, will strike here

301
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,569
in the Aleutians
as a diversion.

302
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,824
To keep Nimitz's
attention away from our main objective.

303
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,494
He will not realize
our objective is Midway

304
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:14,249
until 24 hours later,
when Admiral Nagumo's carriers strike the island

305
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,876
and destroy
the American planes and shore batteries.

306
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:21,673
At that hour
you move in, Kondo, with your invasion forces.

307
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,134
Nimitz will be
forced to respond.

308
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,553
He will have to commit
the balance of his fleet,

309
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,389
most certainly
his carriers, to repel the invasion.

310
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,268
His carrier commander
will undoubtedly be Admiral Halsey.

311
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,607
I have studied his tactics
and I have studied the man.

312
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,860
Halsey is courageous,
tough-minded

313
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,403
and not afraid
to take risks,

314
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,239
but these strengths,
we will turn against him.

315
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,907
It will take
Halsey's task force

316
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,326
at least 48 hours
to reach Midway.

317
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,828
By that time,
Admiral Nagumo,

318
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,581
you'll have crushed Midway
and be waiting for him.

319
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,710
YAMAMOTO: You'll have
the advantage of position,

320
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,630
and at least
a two-to-one superiority in carriers,

321
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:07,135
and four to five times
the number of screening vessels.

322
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,180
All of this
is based on the assumption that the American fleet

323
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,516
will still be guarding
the Hawaiian Islands when we make our strike.

324
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,269
Nimitz is crippled
and on the defensive.

325
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,271
He must deploy his
remaining strength

326
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,440
around his most
valuable Pacific base.

327
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,026
I agree with
Admiral Nagumo, sir.

328
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,362
We must make certain
where the enemy fleet is.

329
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:30,533
May I propose
that on the 29th, we send two flying boats

330
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,495
from Kwajalein to
French Frigate Shoals.

331
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,623
We fuel them
by tanker submarine

332
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,167
and fly them
to Pearl Harbor on the 30th.

333
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:43,838
Let them report whether
or not the American fleet is actually there.

334
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,758
A very wise
precaution indeed.

335
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,510
We will call it
Operation K.

336
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,137
Does anyone have
any other thoughts?

337
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,098
NAGUMO: Yes.

338
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,936
We can achieve
a great victory,

339
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,564
providing Nimitz and Halsey
do exactly what you expect.

340
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,779
The Enterprise
and the Hornet

341
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,697
are due in the harbor
by sundown, sir.

342
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,324
The rest of
Admiral Halsey's task force

343
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,700
should be in sometime
by the morning.

344
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,203
It's the Yorktown
we're worried about.

345
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,871
She's more severely damaged
than we thought.

346
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,957
How soon can we expect
to dry-dock her?

347
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,125
By the 17th,

348
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:24,045
if a Jap sub doesn't spot
the oil she's trailing and track her down.

349
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,882
Admiral Fletcher
just radioed in his repair list.

350
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,594
Call the yard commander,

351
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,348
tell him I want
every workman he can muster standing by to board her.

352
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,226
That sharpshooter
from Washington has just landed, sir.

353
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,477
Be here
in 30 minutes.

354
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,603
Who did
they send?

355
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,021
Captain Vinton Maddox.

356
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,523
Maddox.

357
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,233
He's a goddamn
scalp hunter.

358
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,819
See that he's
thoroughly briefed, get Captain Garth over here.

359
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,404
Aye-aye, sir.

360
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:53,158
Admiral, why don't
you let me handle it?

361
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,953
No, he's entitled
to a crack at me. Phone that in.

362
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,042
You tested those
electric arming switches?

363
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,045
No, we still got
some damn snafu in the circuitry.

364
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,215
You get them
all working and I mean 100%, Commander,

365
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,926
or I want them
ripped out of every SBD in the squadron.

366
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,011
Is that clear?

367
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,095
Yes, sir.

368
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,638
Get to it.

369
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,855
Sorry to drag you
out of bed at this hour, Tom,

370
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,316
but it may be
the only chance we'll get to talk for a few days.

371
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,234
It's okay.
Did you get the reports?

372
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,444
Yup.

373
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,404
I've already read it.

374
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,285
Did you know
your girl belonged

375
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,371
to those Japanese
patriotic organizations?

376
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,502
I saw some magazines
around the apartment,

377
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,296
but I thought
it was propaganda.

378
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,841
Well, the Attorney General's
office says it's subversive.

379
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,135
And the FBI doesn't think
she's telling the truth

380
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,180
about why
she suddenly showed up here in Pearl either.

381
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,057
I guess you can't
blame them for that.

382
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,227
Sure I can!
And I can sure as hell straighten them out, too.

383
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,146
Look, mister,
why don't you cool down and let me handle this?

384
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,275
Tom, I don't have
a lot of time to fool around here.

385
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,319
You asked me to help you.
Do you want me to or not?

386
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,406
Well, I guess,
I don't really have any alternative, do I, sir?

387
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,283
I guess you don't.

388
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,667
Captain Maddox,
Admiral Nimitz.

389
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,335
Great pleasure, sir.

390
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,170
Shall we get
right to it, Captain?

391
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,089
Certainly,
Admiral.

392
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,174
I'm sure you're aware
of Washington's opinion

393
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,593
about this Midway
invasion business.

394
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,263
Yes. They think
it's an enemy ruse.

395
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,723
An elaborate
phoney, sir.

396
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,225
Go on.

397
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,936
Could we speak
in private?

398
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,312
If you'd feel
more comfortable.

399
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,522
Thank you.

400
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,993
Admiral, these
enemy radio intercepts

401
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,370
that your intelligence unit
has been accumulating...

402
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,205
Very detailed,
aren't they?

403
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,165
Too damn detailed, Admiral.

404
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,584
Do you remember
what happened just before December 7th?

405
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,462
The Japanese
flooded the airways with fake messages.

406
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,214
Yes, these could be
carbon copies.

407
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,634
Washington's convinced
that Yamamoto's feeding this stuff to you

408
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,469
in order to cover
his real intentions.

409
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,722
Very definite
possibility.

410
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,932
Well, then, sir,
how can you still insist...

411
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,852
Because it's my judgment
this information is factual.

412
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,730
I am convinced
Yamamoto's target is Midway.

413
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,524
But if you're
wrong, Admiral,

414
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:35,069
if you send our carriers
into a Japanese ambush,

415
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,905
the entire West Coast
and Hawaiian Islands will be wide open for invasion.

416
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,241
I'm fully aware
of that, Captain.

417
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,329
You're saying
the safe play is to defend the home folks first.

418
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:49,250
With respects, Admiral,
it's the smart play.

419
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,176
Captain, if we surprise
the enemy,

420
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,012
catch him
where he doesn't think we'll be,

421
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,681
we can drive him
back 3,000 miles.

422
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,309
And keep him pinned
till we're ready

423
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,770
to take him on
in his own front yard.

424
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,483
Sir, my instructions
were to convey Washington's deep concern

425
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,901
for the safety
of the West Coast

426
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,153
and the Hawaiian Islands.
That is if you...

427
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,072
Captain Maddox,
is Washington ordering me

428
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,532
to defend against
an attack here or the West Coast?

429
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,787
No, sir. My orders
were simply to consult.

430
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,624
No, sir, I have
no such orders for you.

431
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:35,171
Commander Blake,
declare a state of fleet-opposed invasion.

432
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,714
Target: Midway Island.

433
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,007
Issue the order
immediately.

434
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,384
Aye-aye, sir.

435
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,928
Admiral, may I see you
alone a moment, sir?

436
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,888
Excuse me, Captain.

437
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,902
Damn. You know
how much Bill Halsey hates hospitals.

438
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,904
Well, maybe it's not
that serious, sir.

439
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,824
If he scheduled himself
to go anywhere near one,

440
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,661
I'm sure it's not
only damn serious, it's probably critical.

441
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,123
Admiral, I got some
really bad news.

442
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,749
Today is the day
for it.

443
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,085
The Japanese changed
the J-N25 code,

444
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,671
that's the one
that's been giving us Yamamoto's plans.

445
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,006
How long will it
take you to unravel their new system?

446
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,883
A month, maybe two.

447
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:25,304
Sir, do you still
want that fleet order issued?

448
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,600
Yes. Target: Midway.

449
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,421
Welcome aboard
your flagship, Admiral.

450
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,882
Thank you, Captain.

451
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,511
Rear Admiral Kusaka,
meet my Chief of Staff, Captain Aoki.

452
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,307
And where's
Commander Genda?

453
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,435
He's in sick bay, sir.
Influenza.

454
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,564
When does the doctor
think he'll be able resume his duties?

455
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,024
In two
or three days, sir.

456
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,277
I don't like this idea
of beginning this operation

457
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,321
without my best
air commander.

458
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,699
Sir, we have one other
sickbay casualty, Commander Fuchida.

459
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,826
He came down
with appendicitis this morning.

460
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,620
Fuchida, too?

461
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,457
We'll need
a replacement.

462
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,667
Genda suggests
a veteran torpedo pilot

463
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,337
aboard the Hiryu,
Lieutenant Tomonaga.

464
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,759
If Genda says so,
I want to see Tomonaga as soon as possible.

465
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,636
Yes, sir.

466
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:56,938
Fuchida, the man who led
my first air strike at Pearl Harbor, out.

467
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,815
Genda, who planned it,
both ill.

468
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,613
Very bad luck, Kusaka,
very bad luck.

469
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,825
Only an inconvenience,
sir. We'll manage.

470
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,119
Good morning, sir.
Lieutenant.

471
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,079
Follow me, please.

472
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,932
Here we are, sir.
The Sakura family.

473
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,517
Yes. Thank you,
Lieutenant.

474
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,227
I can find
my own way out.

475
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,854
Yes, sir.

476
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,617
Miss Sakura,
I'm Captain Garth, Tom's father.

477
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,660
Please come in.

478
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,708
My parents,
Tetsuro and Sada Sakura.

479
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,627
This is Captain Garth.

480
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,211
How do you do?

481
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,964
You want to speak to me
in private, Captain.

482
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,883
My parents
understand.

483
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,761
Yes. Well, thank you.

484
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,064
If I embarrassed you
in there, forgive me,

485
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,150
but I wanted you
to meet my parents so you could see for yourself

486
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,944
that they're not
much of a threat to national security.

487
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,989
I never really thought
they would be, Miss Sakura.

488
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,617
I suppose it goes
with the times.

489
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,703
And I shouldn't
be bitter?

490
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,831
I never said that.

491
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,334
Damn it,
I'm an American!

492
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:28,339
What makes us different
from German-Americans or Italian-Americans?

493
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,841
Pearl Harbor, I guess.

494
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,933
Look, I've read
that FBI report.

495
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,935
Ask me anything
you want to.

496
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,270
All right.

497
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,898
Your father was seen

498
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,734
frequently going into
the Japanese consulate.

499
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,945
He has
old friends there.

500
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,572
I see.

501
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,453
What about these
Japanese patriotic organizations you belong to?

502
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,707
My father enrolled me
in those when I was born.

503
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:06,752
Out of respect for him
I never resigned, but I wasn't active.

504
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,587
I see.

505
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:15,136
Those magazines they found
in your parents' apartment. What about them?

506
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,347
The Prairie Shimbun?
Published in Wyoming.

507
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,767
My father
has deep emotional ties for Japan,

508
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,686
but even so

509
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,814
he thought
it was a ridiculous propaganda sheet.

510
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,442
Why did he subscribe?

511
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,863
He's a traditional
and honorable man.

512
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:37,533
He was once indebted
to the man who publishes the Prairie Shimbun.

513
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,581
Look, Miss Sakura,
I understand you came to Hawaii

514
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,710
to ask your
parents' permission to marry my son.

515
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,254
Yes, I did.

516
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,298
Why didn't you tell
that to the FBI?

517
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,049
I didn't want to
implicate Tom.

518
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,302
Well, why won't
you see him?

519
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,472
He's in love with you,
so he tells me. You won't even talk to him.

520
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,724
He doesn't understand.
I don't understand.

521
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,896
Because my parents
have forbidden me to marry outside my race.

522
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,738
I want you
to tell him for me.

523
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:22,953
I can't tell him that.
He wouldn't believe me in the first place.

524
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,916
Besides, I'd just as soon
he didn't know we'd talked together.

525
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:35,090
Look, Miss Sakura, Haruko,
Tom's based at Kaneohe Naval Air Station.

526
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,512
Send for him, please.

527
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,515
You have to tell him this.

528
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,975
You have to tell him.

529
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,559
Damn itching is
driving me crazy!

530
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:30,771
All those medics can do
is smear this God-awful paste all over it.

531
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,982
When they get up
enough nerve to come in here, you mean.

532
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,693
I know, I know,
I'm a son of a bitch of a patient.

533
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,027
But a skin disease!

534
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,739
Of all the stupid,
useless things to get laid up with!

535
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,033
It's driving me nuts.
I can't even think right.

536
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,494
Bill, I haven't much time.

537
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,204
Fletcher's docking
the Yorktown right now,

538
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,790
and I gotta make
some hard decisions.

539
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,418
I'd like you to recommend
your own replacement.

540
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:53,836
Ray Spruance.

541
00:36:56,506 --> 00:37:00,342
I know. I know
he's junior to a lot of other flag officers

542
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,386
and he never served
a day on a carrier.

543
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,805
But, Chet,
he knows carrier tactics.

544
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,061
Well, you asked
for my recommendation.

545
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,650
I can just picture
Washington's reaction

546
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,738
if I hand over
the Enterprise and Hornet to a cruiser skipper.

547
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,532
Especially
after all the static I've been getting

548
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:26,160
about going out
looking for the Japanese at Midway.

549
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,540
You told me once, Chet,
"When you're in command, command."

550
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,836
Admiral Fletcher, sir.

551
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,922
Reporting as ordered, sir.

552
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:42,051
Welcome home, Jack.
And congratulations on bringing your cripple in.

553
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,928
Well, we got lucky.

554
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:47,222
We haven't much time,
so I'll give it to you fast.

555
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,850
Halsey's beached,
in the hospital.

556
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,020
Won't be leaving
for a while.

557
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,231
I'm sending you
out again, Jack, in 72 hours.

558
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,943
Back to sea,
full combat readiness.

559
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,611
But, Chet,
that's impossible!

560
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,196
It'll be at least
three months

561
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,114
before the Yorktown's
back in full commission.

562
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,283
I'm giving Ray Spruance
Halsey's command.

563
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,953
He'll be taking
the Enterprise and Hornet to sea tomorrow.

564
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,621
You'll follow him
48 hours later.

565
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,332
Ray Spruance is
a cruiser commander.

566
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,084
He knows carrier tactics.

567
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,377
Yeah, but he can't fly.

568
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,878
Neither can you.

569
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,549
And he sure as hell
can't learn by tomorrow, can he, Jack?

570
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,927
No.

571
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,764
Congratulations, Ray.

572
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,101
Well, I'm still
in a state of shock.

573
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,852
Nice seeing you
again, Matt. How's the hand?

574
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,437
Coming fine, now, sir.
Good.

575
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,314
We could have
used you at Coral Sea. Thank you, sir.

576
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,149
You've got him
for this one, Jack.

577
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,401
He's going out with you
on the Yorktown

578
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,860
to join your
air operation staff.

579
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,070
Good.

580
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,200
This time, we're up against
the biggest force the enemy has ever sortied,

581
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,119
more than 200 ships.

582
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,497
Got a four-to-one
supremacy over us.

583
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,833
Yamamoto himself
is commanding.

584
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,629
We know when
and from where each unit sailed.

585
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,674
We know their
original courses,

586
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,135
but we don't know
where they'll rendezvous

587
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,680
or what changes
they will make or when they'll strike.

588
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,808
My best guess is
they'll hit Midway from the northwest,

589
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,728
but there's
no intelligence to support that.

590
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,982
Ray, assuming
what you see here isn't just an elaborate ruse,

591
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:24,236
Washington thinks it is,
but assuming they're wrong,

592
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,822
what counter moves
do you suggest?

593
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,331
I'd take my carriers
up here to a point northeast of Midway,

594
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,710
lie there and wait
for Nagumo's carriers.

595
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,671
Why not head northwest,
hit them head-on?

596
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,008
You know,
there's just a chance that Washington may be right.

597
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,762
You think Hawaii
and the West Coast could be the real target?

598
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,013
Well, it really
doesn't matter,

599
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,015
provided
I'm in a position to cut them off,

600
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,017
if they
do move east.

601
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,146
If it's Midway,
I'll bushwhack them.

602
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,565
All right.
Jack, you're senior.

603
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,817
You'll take
overall command when you two join up.

604
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,235
Yes, sir.

605
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,156
The Yorktown
will be at sea in less than 72 hours.

606
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,534
I don't need to
dwell on the fact that

607
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,287
Yamamoto outweighs us
in every department.

608
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,955
Our three carriers
and their escorts

609
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,709
are all that stands
between the enemy fleet and the American coastline.

610
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,963
Now, about your
point of rendezvous, what should we call it?

611
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,007
Point Luck.

612
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,760
Sir.

613
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,264
Sounds like a prayer,
Mr. Wold, but it's damned appropriate.

614
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,142
Son of a bitch! Nurse!

615
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:39,895
Ray.

616
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,313
Hi, Bill.

617
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,942
Just about to call the nurse
to try to get somebody to cut that tree down.

618
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,444
It spoils my view
of the boatyard.

619
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,115
Well, how you feeling?

620
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,158
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

621
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:56,620
Just sit around
scratching myself, 24 hours a day.

622
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,039
Did you ever try
an oatmeal water bath?

623
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,124
Don't.

624
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,252
I want to thank you
for recommending me

625
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,170
to take your task force
to sea.

626
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,964
Now, I have
a question for you.

627
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,508
Did that itch
go to your head?

628
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,720
Stop underestimating
yourself, Ray.

629
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,933
Any skipper who can keep
his cruisers and destroyers alongside of my carriers

630
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,477
from one end of
the Pacific to the other

631
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,354
is definitely
the man for the job.

632
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:26,567
You know, you and I are...
Well, you know, we're kind of...

633
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,903
Bill, we're
kind of different.

634
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,615
Do you think
I can pull it off the same way you could have?

635
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,411
I can only
tell you this, Ray.

636
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,745
You play it
the way you feel it,

637
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,248
not the way
you think I'd play it.

638
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,459
You go to sea,
find Yamamoto and chew his ass.

639
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,919
Now, that's all
there is to it.

640
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,672
Right.

641
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,174
Christ, no!
You want to catch this?

642
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,925
You want us to lose
the goddamn war?

643
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,601
Oh, by the way,

644
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,021
I'll have somebody
cut down that tree for you.

645
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,772
Yeah.

646
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:32,382
NIMITZ: In carrying out
the task assigned in Op Plan 29-42,

647
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,551
the Enterprise and Hornet
will be governed

648
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,054
by the principle
of calculated risk,

649
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,724
which you'll interpret
to mean the avoidance of exposure of your force

650
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,477
to attack
by superior enemy forces

651
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,314
without good prospect
of inflicting as a result of such exposure

652
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,524
greater damage
to the enemy.

653
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,227
Sir, three of the boilers
are out of commission.

654
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,897
The yard manager
says he's gonna need another two days.

655
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,943
Delaney, I expect
the yard to finish the job by 0600 tomorrow.

656
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,861
Aye-aye, sir.

657
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,073
Sorry about
your boiler, Jack.

658
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,492
But if you clear
Pearl by 0700

659
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,120
you make your rendezvous
with Enterprise and Hornet

660
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,413
before Yamamoto
hits Midway.

661
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,580
Agreed.

662
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:46,832
Good luck,
good hunting.

663
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,667
Thank you, sir.

664
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,961
You too, Matt.
See you back here soon.

665
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,504
Aye-aye, sir.

666
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,720
We just haven't
any future, Tom.

667
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,515
I figured
that's what it was.

668
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,351
We don't.

669
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,772
We really don't.
I wish you'd go now.

670
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,445
I don't love you anymore.
It was a mistake.

671
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,909
Say it to my face.

672
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,168
Say it to my face,
God damn it!

673
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,392
It'll be okay.

674
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:52,898
Shit. Wait and see.

675
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:56,777
1919 the Marines were
practicing dive-bombing off Haiti, right?

676
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,613
Everybody said,
"Well, premature, better wait and see."

677
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,450
We waited, then
the Germans showed us in '37 in Madrid.

678
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,576
You mean like
at Pearl Harbor?

679
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Pearl Harbor, shit!

680
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:09,831
Pearl Harbor in '32 and '33,
Jocko Clark's squadrons proved

681
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,542
that Pearl Harbor
could be attacked successfully from the air.

682
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:17,047
And Admiral Logan Ramsey
said, predicted, it would happen in detail.

683
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,173
When was that?

684
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,133
In 1937, pal.

685
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:25,138
Wait and see. We waited.
December the 7th, we saw.

686
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:30,644
The wait-and-seers
will bust your ass every time.

687
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,771
I'll drink to that.

688
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,022
Bet your...

689
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,026
How long
you been down here?

690
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:42,489
Long enough to hear
your lecture, buddy. You ought to go on the radio.

691
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,199
How the hell are you?
I'm all right.

692
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,202
Well, I'm celebrating
my birthday. That's how I am.

693
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,079
That's a problem
we all have once a year.

694
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,163
Yeah.

695
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,041
My God, now you got
my kid flying for you.

696
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,836
Hey, how's the boy doing?

697
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Just fine.

698
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,256
He's a good pilot.
Got him checked out in the F4Fs.

699
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,925
He'll be shipping out
any day now.

700
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,929
Coming from you
that means a lot.

701
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,390
No, no. He's a good man,
he's a natural pilot,

702
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,892
he's got good attitude,
good marksman.

703
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:16,106
I would say that
if Tom has any deficiency it would have to be in...

704
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,525
Enemy identification.

705
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,279
Boy's got to
learn, Matt,

706
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,239
you do not win a war
by kissing the enemy.

707
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,449
Oh, for Christ's sake...

708
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,909
Hell, everybody knows it.
He told the whole goddamn squadron.

709
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,287
Yeah, I met her.
She seems like a nice girl.

710
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,414
Well, so was
Madame Butterfly a nice girl.

711
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,291
She's having
a little trouble with it right now.

712
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,877
Well, we have
a little problem forgetting December 7th, don't we?

713
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,046
I got to shove off.

714
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,592
Scuttlebutt says you're
going out on the Yorktown. Is that right?

715
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,510
Yeah, that's right.

716
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,474
Listen, keep your
dumb ass out of drafts.

717
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,850
Yeah, I'll try, buddy.

718
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,729
Hey, thanks for
keeping an eye on my boy. I appreciate it.

719
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,523
He'll be fine, Matt.

720
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,203
Tom!

721
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,413
Nice of you
to take the time to see me off, Dad.

722
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,332
But your squadron
isn't due to ship out for a week.

723
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,292
What are you doing
reporting aboard with this group?

724
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,504
Are you trying to tell me
that you're surprised, sir?

725
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,631
Your old buddy
Jessop couldn't wait to have me transferred.

726
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,133
Well, I didn't
know anything... Like hell you didn't!

727
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,470
You wanted me shipped out,
to stop me from doing something stupid.

728
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,971
Like try to keep my girl
from going to a camp.

729
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,097
Tom...

730
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:32,641
So your old buddy
Jessop obliged.

731
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,643
I knew absolutely
nothing about this.

732
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,312
I have to report
aboard now, sir.

733
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,751
Okay, sir.

734
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,384
Captain Garth
is here, sir.

735
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,927
PEARSON:
Oh, great. Matt.

736
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,929
Come on in here.
How the hell are you? Huh?

737
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,514
Harry.

738
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,058
I'm gonna do something
I do not do,

739
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,561
at least not since
we were in Annapolis.

740
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,479
I'm gonna ask you
to do me a favor.

741
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:23,483
Oh, hell, ask away!
Lord knows I owe you a few.

742
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:28,154
This is one of
the Bureau's enemy alien reports.

743
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,824
Where did
you get this?

744
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,200
Don't ask.

745
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,286
Matt, I could find out.

746
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,662
Don't, Harry.

747
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:44,170
I've read the report.
It's everything the Bureau's got...

748
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,297
A Japanese?

749
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:50,552
...on an American citizen
named Haruko Sakura and her parents.

750
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:56,224
They look okay to me,
but, of course, I'm not in your business.

751
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:58,184
Well, it sounds
as though you are.

752
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:04,024
Harry, I'd like you
to investigate this personally.

753
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,527
These people
are being sent back to the mainland next week.

754
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:11,197
If they're clean,
and I'm betting they are,

755
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,783
I want that
shipment canceled.

756
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,578
Matt, come on,
you're way out of line with this.

757
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,248
This is not your department!
This is tampering!

758
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,381
All right,
what have we got here?

759
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,592
What are these people
to you?

760
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,722
Someday, the girl may be
my daughter-in-law.

761
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,310
Look, this is
not only tampering.

762
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,354
You are pressuring
a superior officer

763
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,023
to take improper action
because of personal reasons.

764
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,484
Improper action,
hell! Harry.

765
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:48,943
I read
what's in there.

766
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,279
These people
are no more a threat to national security

767
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,406
than your pet Airedale.

768
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,621
All right,
I'll have to report this request of yours.

769
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,247
It'll go into your record.

770
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,540
It's not for me.

771
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,711
Wouldn't ask you
for myself, you know that.

772
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,089
For my kid,
I'm asking you.

773
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,468
Jesus Christ, Harry!
I'm begging you!

774
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,022
All right,
I'll investigate it.

775
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,653
Thanks, Harry.

776
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,951
And, Captain...

777
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,664
This'll wash it
with us.

778
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:46,960
We're even.

779
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,295
Aye-aye, sir.

780
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:02,976
OFFICER: Captain?

781
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,855
Thank you, Corporal.

782
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,608
Reporting
as ordered, sir.

783
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,653
I'm sorry to send
the Marines after you, Tom,

784
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,613
but you didn't answer
any of my messages.

785
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,949
I didn't feel we had anything
to talk about, Captain.

786
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,493
You can cut out that
midshipman crap, too.

787
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,995
You're talking
to your old man.

788
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,164
I'll try to remember that.

789
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,583
Look,
for whatever it's worth,

790
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,084
I'd like to set
the record straight.

791
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,044
Before we left Pearl,

792
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:34,340
I personally vouched
for both Haruko and her parents.

793
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,886
I went out on a limb
for them, way out.

794
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,514
'Course, I don't know
what weight it'll carry, but...

795
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,308
Well, there it is.

796
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,602
Thanks.

797
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,105
Oh, one thing more.

798
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,027
I didn't ask your CO
to have you shipped out.

799
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,445
You spoke to him,
didn't you?

800
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,529
Yes, I did.

801
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,532
He asked me
how I felt about...

802
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,409
Haruko and me, right?

803
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,037
Look, I only had
a few days left to help her.

804
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,163
If you couldn't
do anything,

805
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,289
why couldn't
you leave it alone?

806
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,709
Look, Jessop thought
he was doing both of us a favor.

807
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:13,087
I did all I could,
and a hell of a lot more than I should've.

808
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,924
You know, you're being paid
to fly fighter planes,

809
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,300
not to sit down
in your cabin

810
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,302
and cry over
your girl's picture.

811
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,970
You better shape up, tiger,

812
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,057
or some hot-shot Jap pilot's
gonna flame your ass!

813
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,616
Just received
this message, sir.

814
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,661
Operation K,
the reconnaissance flight to Pearl Harbor,

815
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,371
has been canceled.

816
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,832
Canceled? Why?

817
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,417
Our scout planes
could not be refueled.

818
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,878
There was an enemy vessel
at the rendezvous point.

819
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,676
Sir, Admiral Nagumo's
carrier force should be warned immediately.

820
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,846
Admiral Nagumo
must have picked up the transmission

821
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,472
at the same time
we did.

822
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,723
Suppose he didn't.

823
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,767
He will assume
Operation K went forward

824
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,769
and that
the American carriers are at Pearl Harbor.

825
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,481
And that is where
our latest intelligence reports place them.

826
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,442
What latest
intelligence reports, Captain?

827
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,361
Have any of our
submarines sighted

828
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,197
the American fleet
in the last 20 hours?

829
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,117
No, sir. But there is
no logical reason

830
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,454
for the Americans to have
moved their carriers away from Pearl Harbor.

831
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:31,165
At any rate
we must not break radio silence

832
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,877
and risk
letting them know where we are.

833
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:35,879
Sir, the element
of surprise

834
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,173
is one of the most
important aspects of our attack.

835
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,319
BLAKE:
Admiral, this is our search plan.

836
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:03,072
An air search
involving 22 PBYs,

837
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,950
each plane to fly
a spoke 700 miles out,

838
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,952
covering
an eight-degree sector.

839
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,454
That'll give us
a 180-degree look

840
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:10,830
at anything
coming in from the west,

841
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,833
and still leave us
an excellent flanking area northeast of Midway

842
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,001
for our carriers.

843
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,128
Have it put into
operation immediately.

844
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,671
Aye-aye, sir.

845
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:35,456
Jesus, how many
of those can you eat?

846
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,865
Admiral,
air search report.

847
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,120
No sightings.

848
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:19,042
Is there
any defense measure we've overlooked?

849
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,460
Anything Midway needs.

850
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,879
They've had
top priority, Admiral.

851
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,505
We've sent them
everything we can scrape up.

852
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,925
Tanks, PT boats,
barb wire, anti-aircraft guns...

853
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,263
Yeah, and it's miserable
waiting here for an attack on your own people,

854
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,390
hoping to hell
it happens.

855
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,142
More pressure
from Washington, sir?

856
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,810
Not a whisper.

857
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,730
Frankly, I'd rather
have them raising hell.

858
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,336
Captain.
What's the count, Red?

859
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,005
I can put up
half a dozen F4Fs and 15 Buffaloes.

860
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,673
Damned relics.

861
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,550
We'll let the Japs know
we're up there, sir.

862
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,760
Maybe we'll get lucky.

863
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,720
Okay, Red.

864
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,949
In less than five hours,
Hosogaya will attack the Aleutians,

865
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:36,994
and we will still be
groping toward Midway in this filthy squall.

866
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:41,874
We're not due to launch
our first air strike for another 36 hours, sir.

867
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,877
Our predictions are
for clear weather before then, Admiral.

868
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:49,841
I keep wondering, Kusaka,
what did Operation K uncover at Pearl Harbor?

869
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,260
Were the American
carriers there?

870
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,929
We've heard nothing
from Admiral Yamamoto.

871
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,724
That could only mean
the American carriers are still in Hawaiian waters.

872
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,521
Damned
communications blackout!

873
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,410
Hey, you guys!
The Japs are bombing Dutch Harbor!

874
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,745
Here we go.

875
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,042
Welcome aboard.

876
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,260
Well, gentlemen,
it's started. Signal Spruance.

877
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:44,729
The Aleutian Islands
are being invaded, Admiral.

878
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,863
Washington could
still be right.

879
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,949
This could be just
a feint for attack on the West Coast

880
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,951
or right here
in Hawaii.

881
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,121
Or what we've
defended against.

882
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,165
Today.

883
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,876
Our PBY
should tell us today.

884
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:27,980
Hey.

885
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,609
Do you see
what I see?

886
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,322
You're damn right
I do!

887
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:43,079
Sparks, raise Midway.
Radio, "Main body."

888
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,206
That's all?
Just "main body"?

889
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,916
Send it!
Yes, sir.

890
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,089
An American PBY, sir.

891
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,424
A reconnaissance
seaplane!

892
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,469
Sir, radio's
picked up transmission from the enemy plane.

893
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,346
It's alerting Midway.

894
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,682
Break radio silence.

895
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,394
Advise Admiral Yamamoto
that the invasion force has been discovered.

896
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:07,478
Yes, sir.

897
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:15,528
Six large ships in a column,
bearing 262 degrees, distance 700 miles.

898
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,657
Admiral.

899
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,409
I wanted to tell you
myself, Joe.

900
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,577
You were right,
it's Midway.

901
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:27,832
Hot damn! You know
what I mean, Admiral.

902
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,793
Thank God
Fletcher joined Spruance in time.

903
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:36,257
Another one from
Strawberry 9, sir.

904
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,886
11 ships, course 090,
speed 19 knots.

905
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,472
But what kind
of ships?

906
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,933
First transmission
said "main body,"

907
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:48,728
but there was
no mention of any carriers.

908
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:53,149
BLAKE: That PBY,
Strawberry 9, was at the end of his 700-mile leg

909
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,192
when he sent that
message "main body."

910
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,528
It could be
Nagumo's carriers

911
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,322
are following
the large ships he reported.

912
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,657
Well, they may be
just beyond his horizon, Admiral.

913
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:05,578
If they are, Fletcher's
in the wrong place. He's too far north.

914
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,413
He'd have to
move right now at flank speed

915
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,416
to get within
striking distance before sunset.

916
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,918
But if Nagumo's carriers
are where we figured

917
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,420
coming in behind
this storm front...

918
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,048
Fletcher'd be caught
between two forces.

919
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:20,593
NIMITZ: Yes, if we let him
head for that main body sighting.

920
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,016
Send a flash message
to Admiral Fletcher.

921
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,435
This is not, repeat,
not main body.

922
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:33,606
Expect enemy carrier forces
strike tomorrow from behind storm front...

923
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:38,486
"...via northwest,
as previously anticipated." Signed, Nimitz.

924
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,280
Well, that settles that.

925
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:45,201
CINCPAC must think
the PBY sighted only Kondo's invasion force.

926
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,788
But if it's Nagumo's
attack force with his carriers,

927
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,791
and his scouts find us
before we find them...

928
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,673
Captain Buckmaster,
sound general quarters.

929
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:17,233
Weather is clearing, sir.
We could not have timed it better.

930
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,569
Look, we've intercepted
a radio transmission from Tokyo

931
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,488
to Admiral Yamamoto.

932
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,532
So?

933
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,617
Intelligence still
does not report

934
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,161
any movement
of the American fleet.

935
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,831
Well, whatever doubts
we may have had...

936
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,416
Are still
with me, Kusaka.

937
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:38,212
We have no definitive
intelligence reports, only opinions and estimates.

938
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:41,841
And continued silence
from Yamamoto does not make them a fact.

939
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,342
GENDA: Admiral.

940
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,052
Genda.

941
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,434
My apologies.

942
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:54,145
I've been away
from my duties much too long.

943
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,398
Genda, how are you?

944
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,277
I'm well enough now
to take charge of air operations.

945
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:06,574
And so you shall,
my friend. And so you shall.

946
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,953
I want you to prepare
an air search plan immediately.

947
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,621
For what area,
Admiral?

948
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,623
Where I would deploy
my aircraft carriers

949
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,042
if I were
the American commander.

950
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,338
There, northeast
of Midway.

951
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:31,515
Times like this, Joe,
I miss the flatlands.

952
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,021
It's a big body
of water out there.

953
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,566
I'm just a fellow
who came out of a Texas prairie town.

954
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,486
The nearest lake
was 120 miles away.

955
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,615
You could wade across it
at the height of the rainy season.

956
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:50,409
During the summer
we made clay pots out of its bottom.

957
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,750
No matter what happens, Joe,
I want you to know,

958
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,211
you've sure as hell
earned your salary this month.

959
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,173
Well, thank you, sir.

960
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,009
GENDA: To cover
the area in question,

961
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:10,721
we will launch
scout planes from the Akagi and the Kaga,

962
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,099
and our cruiser escorts
will launch five seaplanes.

963
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:16,393
Very good.

964
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,854
But until our scouts
have searched the area

965
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:21,315
we'll hold
our most experienced pilots in reserve

966
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,025
and half our aircraft.

967
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:27,863
But, sir,
the American fleet cannot be anywhere near Midway.

968
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:29,782
We shouldn't
hold back our best pilots.

969
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,284
We've been over this
ground before, Kusaka.

970
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,121
Admiral, our first strike
must be decisive.

971
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,125
Midway's airstrip and planes
must be destroyed in one massive blow.

972
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,294
Otherwise, we invite
a counterstrike.

973
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,548
Commander Genda?

974
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,719
I agree with you, sir.

975
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,806
Let our younger pilots
fly the first strike.

976
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:55,724
I am sure
they can do the job.

977
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,727
If not, we can
always launch a second strike.

978
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,564
That is how
we shall have it.

979
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:09,947
Suddenly, the man
who led us to victory at Pearl Harbor

980
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,824
is choked by caution.

981
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,244
He senses danger
out there.

982
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,871
So do I.

983
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,793
GARTH: Admiral, they wouldn't
bring their transports in so close

984
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,795
if they didn't plan
to invade damn soon.

985
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,423
CINCPAC's right.
They're gonna hit Midway today.

986
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:28,674
FLETCHER:
Yes, but from where?

987
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,384
He could pop out
anywhere along the edge of that storm.

988
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,637
And when he does,
he's gonna have his own scout planes out.

989
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:36,307
We have to find him
before he finds us, sir.

990
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,309
If we're wrong,
if he hits us from the blind side...

991
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,811
Why don't you
get some eyes out there, too, sir?

992
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,981
About 10 SBDs
would cover our northern flank.

993
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:45,941
Okay, get them in the air.
Aye-aye.

994
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:47,443
But no more
than 100 miles out.

995
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,486
I want to be able
to recover them fast,

996
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,738
in case the PBYs
make contact first.

997
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,072
Yes, sir.

998
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,476
You okay?

999
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,102
Yeah.
Here.

1000
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,440
Those poor bastards are
gonna miss all the fun.

1001
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,526
There's nothing
north of us but empty ocean.

1002
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:33,113
He gets his dope
straight from Tokyo Rose. Right, Chili Bean?

1003
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,406
Wrong, caballo.
I get it from here.

1004
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,532
Yeah.

1005
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,493
When it bristles
there's Japs around.

1006
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,453
You crazy airdale!

1007
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,914
Morning, Captain.

1008
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,791
You guy are supposed
to be sacked out.

1009
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,209
What the hell
are you doing here?

1010
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,253
We tried, Captain,
we couldn't sleep.

1011
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:54,510
Yeah, I know,
but let's get below and try. We got a heavy day ahead.

1012
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,305
Yes, sir.

1013
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,420
Excellent
weather forecast, sir.

1014
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,839
We've got
broken cloud cover up to 2,000 feet

1015
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,841
to conceal us
from enemy scout planes,

1016
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:36,552
and above 2,000,
unlimited visibility

1017
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,138
straight into Midway
for our flyers.

1018
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,391
Commence launching.

1019
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:25,976
Sir, all scout planes
from our cruisers are in the air, except one.

1020
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,313
The Tone is having
catapult problems, Admiral.

1021
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,316
They'll be delayed
in getting Scout 4 launched.

1022
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,400
How long?

1023
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,360
Half an hour, sir.

1024
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:39,281
Sir, in case the Americans
should suddenly appear,

1025
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,201
I suggest
the second flight wave be brought on deck

1026
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,702
as soon as
the first wave is clear.

1027
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,454
Armed with torpedoes

1028
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,165
to deal with
the enemy carriers, Commander?

1029
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,168
Yes. Our planes
and the Kaga's.

1030
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,796
Soryu and Hiryu's planes
can stand by with bombs

1031
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,547
in case they're needed
over Midway.

1032
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,676
Give the order.

1033
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,553
Yes, sir.

1034
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,628
Well, now it's up
to our strike leader.

1035
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,923
Tomonaga is the best
we've got.

1036
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,622
Howie?

1037
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,926
It's the whole damn
Jap navy!

1038
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,930
Radio, raise Midway.

1039
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,391
Send, "Enemy carriers."

1040
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,268
OPERATOR ON RADIO:
Bandits three o'clock, Lieutenant.

1041
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,022
Yeah, we got them.
It's Jap fighter cover.

1042
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,273
Okay, let's duck
into the clouds

1043
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,691
and come in behind
for a closer look.

1044
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,658
Admiral.

1045
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,165
Enemy carriers?
You mean that's all?

1046
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,250
That's all he said, sir.
It's Strawberry 5.

1047
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,127
We haven't heard
from him since.

1048
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,587
Admiral.

1049
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,923
If he was on course
and on schedule,

1050
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:06,011
he made the contact
about here, 250 miles out.

1051
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,764
You better signal
that to Spruance.

1052
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,307
Aye-aye, sir.

1053
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,781
You damn certain that was
Strawberry 5 you heard?

1054
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,825
Positive, Skipper,
it was their call letters.

1055
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,579
Well, how far are we
from that contact point?

1056
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:34,498
We're about 15 minutes
behind schedule.

1057
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:37,584
OPERATOR: Bandits! Bandits!
Sweet mother of God, hundreds of them!

1058
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:38,710
Where, damn it?
Where?

1059
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,547
Four... No, no.
Five, five o'clock!

1060
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,385
Jesus!

1061
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,475
Billy, send in the clear.
"Many planes heading Midway."

1062
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,646
Are you certain?

1063
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,066
All right,
just let us know the second you get anything else.

1064
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,442
Nothing more, Admiral.

1065
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:03,902
Not a word
from any of our scouts

1066
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,320
since that
"many planes" flash.

1067
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,531
Yes, but was that
from Strawberry 5 or one of the other scouts?

1068
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:11,159
No call letters were sent.
The operator must have been too excited.

1069
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,954
Or else he was jumped
by enemy fighters.

1070
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:17,916
Damn it! How many carriers?
What course? What speed?

1071
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:22,504
Those Jap fighters
will never find us in this soup.

1072
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,923
Yeah, and we'll never
find their carriers again,

1073
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:27,676
unless we break
into the clear and soon.

1074
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,264
Damn it!
I should've gone straight in and risked it.

1075
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:43,859
Nothing.
We've lost them!

1076
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,612
Lieutenant Addy,
they're behind us!

1077
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,449
I can see two carriers
and a battleship.

1078
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,117
Send it!

1079
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,869
Aye-aye, sir.

1080
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,380
BROWNING:
"Fletcher to Spruance.

1081
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:08,216
"Second sighting reported,
Strawberry 5.

1082
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:12,596
"Two enemy carriers,
battleship. Bearing Midway, 320 degrees.

1083
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:17,601
"Distance, 180 miles.
Course, 135 degrees.

1084
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:20,145
"Speed, 25 knots."

1085
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,814
Right out of the slot
where Nimitz figured they'd come.

1086
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:26,985
"Proceed southwesterly,
attack enemy carriers.

1087
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,697
"Will follow as soon as
search planes recovered. Fletcher."

1088
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,408
Signal the Hornet,
Captain Browning.

1089
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,703
Let's get to
battle stations.

1090
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:12,823
Get the control tower officer
for Captain Simard.

1091
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,203
Andy?
Yes, sir.

1092
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,621
Major Parks get
his fighters up?

1093
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:23,375
All 23 of them.
The SBDs are on the line now, ready to go.

1094
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,043
Get them airborne.
Yes, sir.

1095
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,130
Captain, we've got
Major Parks' frequency.

1096
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:35,178
Rainbow Leader.
Rainbow Leader. Below us, ten o'clock.

1097
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,850
I see them, Kirk.

1098
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,726
All right, everybody.

1099
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,771
Let's see
how many we can drop on the first pass.

1100
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,158
PILOT: Bertha 3, Bertha 3.
Under you, two bogies.

1101
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,540
Got one! Got one!
Look at that Jap bastard!

1102
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,295
Bail out, Bertha 3.
Bail out!

1103
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,922
Get him off me!
Somebody get him off me!

1104
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,425
Bail out! Bail out!

1105
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,013
Bertha 4, on your tail.
Coming in on you! Three of them!

1106
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:23,977
I'm hit, Rainbow Leader!
Oh, my God! Mayday, mayday!

1107
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,606
Look out, Rainbow!
On your tail!

1108
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,275
Billy, Billy!
Four o'clock low.

1109
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,194
Coming in on you!
Three of them!

1110
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:40,994
Coming at you at three.

1111
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:44,164
Geez, look at that
Jap bastard climb!

1112
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,918
My God, they got Major Parks!
Look out, on your tail!

1113
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,545
Four o'clock low.
Two bogies.

1114
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:54,591
Rainbow Leader,
come in, Rainbow Leader. This is Noah's Ark.

1115
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:58,136
Report, please!
What is your condition? Report, please!

1116
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:01,890
Good God!
Give me the tower.

1117
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,939
Andy, they blew right through
Red Park's fighters.

1118
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:10,148
Get your people
to the shelters.

1119
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,441
Yes, sir.

1120
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,917
Jesus!

1121
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,253
Come on!

1122
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,345
Attack in squadron order!

1123
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:05,847
God, they creamed us.

1124
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,265
But we're not
out of action yet.

1125
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,560
Our landing strip
is still operational.

1126
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:37,504
Admiral?
Hmm?

1127
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,843
Tomonaga is asking
for a second strike.

1128
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:48,223
Sir, this report
is a great victory.

1129
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:49,891
We've lost only
seven planes

1130
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,602
and we've destroyed
more than 40 enemy aircraft,

1131
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,312
in the air
and on the ground.

1132
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:56,773
But apparently
the pilots that you chose

1133
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,983
did not destroy the airstrip,
Commander Genda.

1134
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:04,406
Sir, we have 93 planes
and our best pilots waiting on our flight decks.

1135
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:07,075
The entire force
should be sent out without delay.

1136
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,827
The entire force?

1137
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:13,206
Our planes are armed
with torpedoes on Commander Genda's advice.

1138
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,334
Hardly suitable
for bombing an airstrip. Correct, Commander?

1139
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:20,547
They should all
be taken below immediately and rearmed with bombs, sir.

1140
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:24,008
We must make certain
that no air attacks against us

1141
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,510
can be mounted
from Midway.

1142
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:29,431
Sir, Lieutenant Tomonaga's
request is also a warning.

1143
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,308
Midway is still
a threat to us.

1144
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,853
So are the American
carriers, Kusaka.

1145
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,522
If they are nearby,
yes, sir.

1146
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,942
But our scouts have been gone
for over two hours now, they've reported nothing.

1147
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:45,029
You're forgetting
Scout Number 4 was a half-hour late taking off.

1148
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,992
It will not reach
it's maximum search range for another hour yet.

1149
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:02,005
Tomonaga's planes
will be returning soon.

1150
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:06,718
When they recover,
they can be quickly refueled and rearmed for sea action,

1151
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,679
in case our scouts
sight any enemy ships.

1152
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,099
Admiral?

1153
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,438
Very well.

1154
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:22,108
Order our torpedo bombers
to be rearmed with contact bombs.

1155
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:23,401
As soon as
they're ready,

1156
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,070
we'll launch
a second strike against Midway.

1157
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,405
Yes, sir.

1158
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,815
Fifty-seven planes
on the line, sir.

1159
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,402
The Hornet
will probably launch about the same number.

1160
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,280
What's the position
of the enemy carriers?

1161
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,491
135 miles, sir.

1162
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:13,868
If we launch immediately,

1163
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:16,412
do our pilots
have enough fuel to make the attack and return?

1164
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,957
Yes, sir.
If this weather holds,

1165
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,084
if their navigation
is perfect,

1166
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,294
and if they don't
take too much time over the target.

1167
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,046
If we launch now,

1168
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:28,383
we just might catch Nagumo,
like a sitting duck.

1169
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,053
But if we take time
to move in close,

1170
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,430
that'll give him time
to refuel and reload.

1171
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,725
Sir, that PBY reported
only two carriers.

1172
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,810
I know.

1173
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,145
Intelligence says
he has four on his strike force.

1174
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:43,731
Those other two
suddenly pop up out of nowhere...

1175
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,692
Then we'd be
sitting ducks.

1176
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,739
But there are
two certain targets

1177
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:54,325
135 miles from here
that don't expect us.

1178
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,956
Let's get
Enterprise and Hornet turned into the wind.

1179
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,374
Yes, sir.

1180
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,671
GARTH: Admiral?
Admiral?

1181
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:09,048
It's from
Admiral Spruance, sir.

1182
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,926
Enterprise and Hornet
are launching every aircraft they've got

1183
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,137
from maximum range.

1184
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,648
The air controller reports
our Midway strike force

1185
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:27,650
will be over the deck
in one hour, sir.

1186
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,986
Just the time
we need to finish arming our bombers

1187
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,696
for the second strike
on Midway.

1188
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,782
Your confidence is
most reassuring, Kusaka.

1189
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:38,870
Our scout planes
still haven't reported enemy carriers nearby.

1190
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,039
They should be starting
their homeward leg now.

1191
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:44,125
All except
Scout Number 4.

1192
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:07,607
Ten enemy ships
sighted.

1193
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:11,986
Bearing 010 degrees.
Distance, 240 miles from Midway.

1194
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:14,947
Course, 150 degrees.
Speed, 20 knots.

1195
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:17,033
Which scout radioed
the contact?

1196
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,910
Number 4, sir.

1197
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:24,248
How far along are we
on the rearming?

1198
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,541
Almost half way, sir.

1199
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:27,377
Order it halted.
But, sir.

1200
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:31,130
Radio Scout 4
to ascertain ship types and maintain contact.

1201
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:32,465
RADIOMAN: Yes, sir.

1202
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:45,061
Friendlies, sir.
Our search planes returning.

1203
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:48,856
They'll be back aboard
in less than 15 minutes, sir.

1204
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,526
Ask Captain Buckmaster
to see to it, Murr.

1205
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,319
Our planes
from Enterprise and Hornet

1206
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:56,864
should hit the Jap carriers
in just under an hour, sir.

1207
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,659
Well, not on
the same course?

1208
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,454
Now we're counting
on it, Admiral.

1209
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,582
Nagumo has to
hold course until he recovers his planes

1210
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,168
coming back from
that Midway strike.

1211
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,797
240 degrees ought to
put our people right smack on top of him

1212
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,340
with his flight decks
full of unfueled aircraft.

1213
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:31,899
I don't see our fighters
anywhere, sir.

1214
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,651
They should've
caught up to us by now.

1215
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,319
And where's
Bombing 8, Skipper?

1216
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,531
With Fighting 8, Dobbs.
They took off together.

1217
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,201
Ain't they supposed to be
tagging along with us?

1218
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,290
GAY ON RADIO:
Red Fox Leader from Kit 3.

1219
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,084
Red Fox Leader
from Kit 3.

1220
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:54,088
Skipper, either my compass
is all fouled up or we're now headed 240.

1221
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:58,050
There's nothing
out there but empty ocean.

1222
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,261
I know where
the Japs will be, Mr. Gay.

1223
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,056
Think you might
let us in on it, sir?

1224
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:07,226
I figure they moved
since we launched.

1225
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,896
East, heading out
away from Midway.

1226
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,647
Out.

1227
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,192
Roger.

1228
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:17,028
What good's our orders
if the skipper's gonna lead us off on his own?

1229
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,696
I don't like it, sir.

1230
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:21,491
Huntington,
now you take it easy, hear?

1231
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,951
If anybody
can find the Japs, Waldron can.

1232
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,412
He's part Sioux Indian,
for Christ's sake.

1233
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,672
Sir, another message
from Scout 4.

1234
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:42,929
Three additional
enemy ships sighted, 250 miles from Midway.

1235
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,555
Speed, 20 knots.

1236
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:49,185
Apparently two cruisers,
a carrier believed to be the Yorktown.

1237
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:53,773
Impossible. The Yorktown
was virtually blown out of the water at Coral Sea.

1238
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,274
They can't have
repaired her

1239
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,693
and brought her
this far west in less than 10 days.

1240
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,071
We must assume
that they have!

1241
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,990
If it is the Yorktown,
we must destroy her at once, sir.

1242
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:05,076
I see.

1243
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:08,871
Now, suddenly,
the threat of Midway's bombers

1244
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,623
seems less to you
than it did

1245
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:14,752
when you urged me
to switch our planes from torpedoes to bombs!

1246
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,922
Admiral, Midway
will have to wait, sir.

1247
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,590
We should
rearm our bombers immediately

1248
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,092
and attack
that enemy carrier.

1249
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,011
Back to torpedoes
again, Kusaka?

1250
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:26,180
More wasted time!

1251
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:29,016
Lieutenant Tomonaga,
this is Commander Genda.

1252
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,184
Do you read me?

1253
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,691
Lieutenant Tomonaga,
this is Commander Genda.

1254
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,276
Do you read me?

1255
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,278
TOMONAGA: I read you, sir.
Report, please.

1256
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,905
Request permission
to land, sir.

1257
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:46,158
Many of my pilots reporting
near-empty fuel tanks.

1258
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:48,494
Some have taken
anti-aircraft hits.

1259
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:50,538
Urgent we land
immediately, sir.

1260
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,291
Sir, do I have
your permission?

1261
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,419
Admiral Yamaguchi advises
that we launch an attack

1262
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:58,504
on the American carrier
immediately.

1263
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:01,257
That we send
our bombers out, however they're armed.

1264
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,884
And while we're
launching, sir,

1265
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,136
Tomonaga's pilots
will be crashing into the sea!

1266
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:08,431
They're running
out of fuel, Admiral.

1267
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:17,773
All right.

1268
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:22,069
Wait until we've recovered
all our airborne aircraft.

1269
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:24,614
While the flight deck
is being used for the recovery,

1270
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,116
rearm our bombers
with torpedoes.

1271
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,119
Then we'll launch the attack
on the American carrier.

1272
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:31,537
Sir.

1273
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:33,915
Lieutenant Tomonaga.

1274
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:46,344
That's the last of our
scout planes, Admiral.

1275
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,847
Tell Elliott to
launch everything we've got.

1276
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:51,390
Aye-aye, sir.

1277
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,275
MAN ON PA:
Pilots, man your planes!

1278
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,069
General quarters,
general quarters,

1279
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:05,571
all units
man your battle stations.

1280
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,911
Admiral, all aircraft
now aboard, sir.

1281
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:37,621
Tomonaga?

1282
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,915
He was the last
to touch down.

1283
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,252
I want to close the range
on that enemy carrier.

1284
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,421
Steer northeast,
battle speed!

1285
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:46,714
Yes, sir.

1286
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:00,311
From Admiral Nagumo, sir.

1287
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,354
"Enemy force
composed of one carrier,

1288
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:04,440
"five cruisers,
five destroyers.

1289
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:07,818
"Sighted 250 miles
from Midway. We are headed for it."

1290
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,445
One carrier?

1291
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:14,784
Close to Midway.
Not Pearl Harbor!

1292
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,495
Admiral Nagumo
will simply destroy it

1293
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,206
a few days earlier
than we had planned.

1294
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,380
Oh, thanks, Matt.

1295
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:30,257
Boy, I'd give
my retirement pay

1296
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,051
to know what Nagumo's
doing right now.

1297
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:35,179
The same thing
we are, Admiral, sweating it out.

1298
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:49,485
Skipper!

1299
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:56,992
I see it.

1300
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:59,078
What'd I tell you,
Huntington?

1301
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:01,747
The skipper
can smell them out.

1302
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:09,171
Dobbs, see if you can raise
Bombing 8 and Fighting 8.

1303
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:10,548
They can't be
too far away.

1304
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,341
You better
coordinate the attack.

1305
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:13,717
Yes, sir.

1306
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:21,809
Red Fox 8 Leader
to Badger 8 Leader.

1307
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,477
Do you read me? Over.

1308
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:28,065
Okay, we can't wait all day.
You better get ready, Dobbs.

1309
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:31,485
Red Fox Leader to Kits,
we're going in!

1310
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,155
Divisions 2 and 4,
take the carrier support.

1311
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,740
Divisions 1 and 3,
ram it to the other two.

1312
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,743
And stay together
as long as you can.

1313
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:42,371
I say again,
stay in tight!

1314
01:31:57,804 --> 01:32:01,015
Admiral,
enemy torpedo bombers, off the port quarter!

1315
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:17,156
They're coming in
without fighter protection.

1316
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,742
Suicide,
mindless suicide!

1317
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:20,951
Perhaps.

1318
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,120
But is an effective
technique.

1319
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:25,206
We can't launch our attack
against their carrier

1320
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,249
while we're busy
dodging them.

1321
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:29,376
They're using up
all our fighters.

1322
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:33,130
WALDRON: Fox Leader
to Kit 3, bandits, eleven o'clock! Look out!

1323
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:36,800
Dead ahead,
Kit 4, two of them. Shoot, Andy, shoot!

1324
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:42,681
OFFICER 1: This is Kit 6,
I got three of them on my tail.

1325
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,308
For Christ sake,
somebody help me!

1326
01:32:54,945 --> 01:32:58,405
OFFICER 2: Danny, below you,
bandits! No, no!

1327
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:03,702
Oh, my God, Danny, bail out!
Bail out!

1328
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:08,457
Bail out, Danny!
Bail out!

1329
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,383
WALDRON:
Fox Leader to Kit, stay in formation!

1330
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,302
Damn it, close up,
you idiots! They'll chop us to pieces!

1331
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:22,012
Close in! Close in!

1332
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,889
PILOT:
I'm hit, I'm hit! Oh, Jesus!

1333
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,731
WALDRON:
Dobbs, behind you! Bandits behind you!

1334
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,234
Dobbs, look out!

1335
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:42,992
GAY: Huntington,
three of them coming in at ten o'clock!

1336
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,668
Huntington!

1337
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,671
Huntington, Huntington!

1338
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:00,968
Close in, Mr. Gay.
Follow me.

1339
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,240
GAY: Commander Waldron,
get your nose up!

1340
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:27,745
Commander Waldron,
pull up, pull up!

1341
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:26,512
What the hell happened?

1342
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,722
One of our
torpedo groups attacked.

1343
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:31,517
Yeah, but which one?
I mean, what the hell happened?

1344
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:37,523
Casualty report, sir.

1345
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:39,650
One of our fighters
suffered a minor hit,

1346
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,152
no shipboard damage,
no casualties.

1347
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,493
A whole squadron.

1348
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,996
Fifteen brave crews.

1349
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:16,103
Torpedo 3 going in
at 1,500 feet, sir.

1350
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,105
Bombing 3
and Fighting 3 at 19,000,

1351
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,231
and 15 minutes
to target.

1352
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,524
Who's coordinating
the attack?

1353
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:23,485
Max Leslie, sir.
He's leading Bombing 3.

1354
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,253
Helen Leader to Helen Group,
time to arm our bombs.

1355
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:44,006
I say again, arm bombs!

1356
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:50,888
God damn it!

1357
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:54,641
This is Helen Leader,
keep your hands

1358
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,226
off that damned
electric arming switch!

1359
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:59,646
Use manual control!
Use manual control!

1360
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:00,981
PILOT 1:
Too late, Commander.

1361
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,691
PILOT 2:
Mine dropped, too, Commander Leslie.

1362
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:04,902
PILOT 3:
Mine dropped, too. Rotten gadget!

1363
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,196
Who the hell invented
the electric arming switch?

1364
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,656
PILOT 4: Yamamoto,
who the hell do you think?

1365
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,658
Now what are we gonna do?
Drop spitballs on the Japs?

1366
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:15,871
All right, knock it off.
The rest of you, use manual control!

1367
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:18,916
Helen Leader, out.

1368
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:47,653
Skipper, take a look
at Chili Bean over here.

1369
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:51,823
I can feel them!

1370
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:54,451
Sure hope he's right.

1371
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:11,635
Bertha 3 Leader
to Mabel 3 Leader.

1372
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:13,637
Thach, on the horizon!

1373
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:18,767
I've got three...
Sweet Jesus! I got four Jap carriers.

1374
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:22,688
Holy hell,
we hit the jackpot!

1375
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:30,737
Yes, sky watch.

1376
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,197
Enemy torpedo planes, sir.

1377
01:38:32,282 --> 01:38:33,282
How many?

1378
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:34,825
Two separate groups.

1379
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:43,500
Bertha 3 Leader,
Mabel 3 Leader.

1380
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:46,086
How's about it, Thach.
You boys ready up there?

1381
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:50,674
Damn right we're ready.
Let's go, Lem, we're running out of fuel.

1382
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,677
Roger. Bertha 3 Leader
to Small Fry.

1383
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,305
Concentrate
on the closest flattop.

1384
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,724
Push in close
and get hits.

1385
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,977
I count 12 coming in
from starboard, Admiral.

1386
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:04,229
Fourteen from
port side, sir.

1387
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:07,399
All these
torpedo planes can't be coming from one carrier.

1388
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:09,401
Well, they must be
coming from Midway.

1389
01:39:09,527 --> 01:39:11,278
Or a second carrier.

1390
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:14,531
Sir, we've heard
nothing from Scout 4

1391
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:16,074
since it sighted
the one enemy carrier.

1392
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:17,743
I think the Soryu
should send out

1393
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:18,952
its scout plane
for another look.

1394
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:22,289
We must make certain
of what we are up against.

1395
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:24,333
See to it immediately.

1396
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:25,500
Yes, sir.

1397
01:39:38,264 --> 01:39:41,308
Lining up to jump us,
Thach. About 12 Zekes.

1398
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:43,894
We're right
above them, Lem.

1399
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:46,271
Mabel 3 to Hustlers,
let's break them up!

1400
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,876
Score one
for Commander Thach!

1401
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,920
Four o'clock low.
Coming in on you! Three of them!

1402
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:16,677
Atta boy, Tom!
Run that bastard right into the drink!

1403
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:18,637
Blow it to him, Tommy.

1404
01:40:21,683 --> 01:40:23,850
Ramos, two o'clock!
Two o'clock!

1405
01:40:31,567 --> 01:40:33,276
Nice shooting, Ramos!

1406
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,487
Chalk up one
for Chili Bean.

1407
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:41,118
One o'clock, Manson.
One o'clock!

1408
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:49,501
You got him!
Nice going, Manson.

1409
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:56,883
Mabel Leader
to Hustler 2,

1410
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:59,344
three bandits
at twelve o'clock diving on you!

1411
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:02,931
Roll out, Tom!
Roll out! Climb, climb!

1412
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:29,666
Yes.

1413
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:31,585
We've crushed
every one of their air attacks,

1414
01:41:31,669 --> 01:41:33,712
and not one torpedo
has even come close.

1415
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:38,300
Sacrifice themselves
like samurai, these Americans.

1416
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:41,678
Sir, the fighter director
reports that last attack

1417
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:44,264
pulled our entire
fighter cover down to sea level.

1418
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:46,933
They're off now,
wave-hopping after the survivors.

1419
01:41:47,894 --> 01:41:49,519
We have no fighter
umbrella over us?

1420
01:41:49,604 --> 01:41:50,687
No, sir.

1421
01:41:50,772 --> 01:41:54,941
We're trying to recall them,
get them back up to the patrol altitude.

1422
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:57,402
How many fighters
are standing by to cover our attack

1423
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:59,863
against the
American carrier?

1424
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:02,240
Barely enough
to do the job, sir.

1425
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:31,645
They're American carriers,
no doubt about it, Yorktown class.

1426
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:34,439
Get through
to Nagumo's flagship. Be quick about it!

1427
01:42:41,864 --> 01:42:43,198
Why are you waiting for?

1428
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,658
The transmitter
isn't working, sir.

1429
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,576
We're not sending out
any signal!

1430
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:03,635
What's that look like
to you down there?

1431
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:09,432
A Jap destroyer!

1432
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,270
Going someplace
in one hell of a hurry.

1433
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,360
Okay, let's follow it.
See where it leads us.

1434
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:23,864
Commander McClusky,
look at your fuel gauge.

1435
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:25,824
We've gotta
turn back now or...

1436
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:27,492
I know, I know.

1437
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:37,627
The last two attacks
were made by more than 50 torpedo planes.

1438
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,254
Fifty, Kusaka.

1439
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:43,550
There is more than
one enemy carrier nearby, there must be!

1440
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:44,843
Admiral.

1441
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:47,387
Genda, why hasn't
Soryu's scout plane reported?

1442
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:48,513
We don't know, sir.

1443
01:43:48,598 --> 01:43:50,974
It should have sighted
the American ships 10 minutes ago.

1444
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:54,311
Sir, all the bombers
are rearmed and ready.

1445
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:03,987
Signal all carriers,
launch immediately!

1446
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:16,666
PILOT: Raven Leader,
there they are, dead ahead. Sweet mother, look at them!

1447
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:19,210
The whole Jap navy!

1448
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:20,378
This is Raven Leader.

1449
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:24,049
Pipe down
and stay off the air till I report contact!

1450
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:27,510
Raven Leader
to Mother Goose.

1451
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:31,473
Have them in sight.
Four enemy carriers.

1452
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:34,893
I say again,
four enemy carriers.

1453
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:48,823
WILSON: Helen Leader
to Bertha Leader!

1454
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,367
Helen Leader
to Mabel Leader!

1455
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:52,702
Come in, Bertha!
Come in, Mabel!

1456
01:44:53,746 --> 01:44:56,831
This is Helen Leader.
We have made contact.

1457
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,209
Come in, Bertha.
Come in, Mabel.

1458
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:02,629
I'm sorry,
Commander Leslie.

1459
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,756
Torpedo 3
and Fighter 3 don't answer.

1460
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:08,802
Keep trying, Wilson.
We're supposed to coordinate our attack.

1461
01:45:09,178 --> 01:45:11,262
Maybe they got balled up
on their navigation, sir,

1462
01:45:11,347 --> 01:45:14,140
or maybe
we're not at the right rendezvous point.

1463
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:16,434
Keep trying, damn it!

1464
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:18,937
Mabel Leader,
come in, Mabel Leader!

1465
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:26,903
Raven Leader to flock,
looks like they're turning into the wind,

1466
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,363
getting ready
to launch.

1467
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:29,990
JACCARD: Where's
their fighter patrol?

1468
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,408
I don't see
any Jap fighters, sir.

1469
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:34,411
Well, let's not wait
for them. Follow me.

1470
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:39,624
It's no use, sir.

1471
01:45:39,709 --> 01:45:42,752
Commander Massey
and Commander Thach still don't answer.

1472
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:45,046
Okay, Wilson, hang on.
We're going in.

1473
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:47,007
Sir, we don't have a bomb!

1474
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:50,218
Well, we can draw some heat
off the guys who do.

1475
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:52,345
This is Helen Leader.

1476
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:56,057
We'll concentrate
on that big bastard up forward.

1477
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:57,577
Raven Leader
to Raven One, Raven Two. You missed, damn it!

1478
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:58,953
Raven 1
to Raven Leader.

1479
01:46:59,038 --> 01:47:00,705
Commander McClusky,
they've got bombs

1480
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:02,874
stacked all over
their flight deck!

1481
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:05,585
Bull's eye! Bull's eye!

1482
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:14,969
Scratch one flattop!
Sweet mother, we caught him cold!

1483
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:18,598
Raven Leader to Raven 6.
I got a hit, Commander McClusky.

1484
01:47:20,476 --> 01:47:23,019
PILOT 2: Ram it home,
girls, ram it home!

1485
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:25,438
Cream the bastards!

1486
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,443
Bull's eye, Helen 5.
Bull's eye!

1487
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:37,242
Commander Leslie,
I got a hit right down their throat.

1488
01:47:37,326 --> 01:47:39,077
Look at that
bastard burn!

1489
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:41,579
LESLIE: Beautiful,
Helen 3, dead center!

1490
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:58,304
My God, we caught
them flat-footed!

1491
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:00,515
No fighters, cover decks
loaded with bombs!

1492
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:03,101
Sweet Mary-Anne,
how'd we get so lucky?

1493
01:48:30,838 --> 01:48:34,966
Helen Leader to squadron,
three enemy carriers burning.

1494
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:37,177
Time to go home.

1495
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:18,843
Admiral, you must
transfer your flag.

1496
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,137
The cruiser Nagara
is close by.

1497
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:25,725
Advise Admiral Yamaguchi.

1498
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:35,693
I can't tell you where
to find the enemy carriers, Lieutenant Kobayashi.

1499
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:39,822
Their last position
was radioed by Scout 4. It's several hours old.

1500
01:49:40,241 --> 01:49:42,367
Hasn't the
Soryu scout reported, sir?

1501
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:44,535
It hasn't been
heard from since it was launched.

1502
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:46,162
Then how do I
find him, sir?

1503
01:49:46,247 --> 01:49:50,708
Lead your group toward
the last reported position here northeast of us

1504
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:55,255
and then just trust
your luck that somehow you'll find them.

1505
01:50:07,977 --> 01:50:09,769
Do you
hear anything?

1506
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:10,853
Nothing, sir.

1507
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:14,148
All enemy ship
and aircraft frequencies are silent.

1508
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:22,699
Lieutenant, enemy planes!

1509
01:50:22,783 --> 01:50:23,866
I see them.

1510
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:30,665
Our fighters
are forming for an attack!

1511
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,711
Signal them
to lay back with the rest of us.

1512
01:50:34,795 --> 01:50:36,754
Use your light,
stay off the radio!

1513
01:50:36,839 --> 01:50:37,797
Yes, sir.

1514
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:40,800
We'll let them lead
us to their carrier.

1515
01:50:52,187 --> 01:50:54,522
I count
all Max Leslie's bombers, sir.

1516
01:50:54,606 --> 01:50:57,066
Well, where
the hell are the rest of Thach's fighters?

1517
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,901
Off the port quarter, sir.

1518
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:07,660
I'll bring
the fighters down first.

1519
01:51:07,745 --> 01:51:10,246
They'll be the
lowest on fuel.

1520
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:15,603
Jesus!

1521
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:34,330
He's alive, Captain.

1522
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:37,750
Flight Mission Combat.

1523
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:38,960
Go ahead, Combat.

1524
01:52:39,211 --> 01:52:42,130
Radar has a third
group of aircraft, definitely bandits.

1525
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:44,799
020, 30 miles
and approaching, sir.

1526
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,050
Roger.

1527
01:52:46,135 --> 01:52:48,928
Bandits, sir.
020, approaching 30 miles.

1528
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:52,098
Sound general quarters.

1529
01:54:34,952 --> 01:54:38,454
Sir, we took
a bomb on our side. The boilers are out.

1530
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:41,707
Admiral,
the radio's down.

1531
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,210
We can't send
visual signals with all this smoke.

1532
01:54:44,503 --> 01:54:47,547
You'll have to
transfer the flag, sir. I suggest the Astoria.

1533
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,882
Matt, you better stay aboard,
help Murray with flight ops.

1534
01:54:49,967 --> 01:54:51,259
Aye, sir.

1535
01:54:54,054 --> 01:54:55,096
Lower the barge.

1536
01:54:55,764 --> 01:54:57,014
Order Admiral's
barge lowered!

1537
01:54:57,349 --> 01:54:58,558
Aye-aye, sir.

1538
01:55:03,814 --> 01:55:07,650
This is Zephyr
calling Whirlwind. Zephyr to Whirlwind.

1539
01:55:08,277 --> 01:55:09,819
Enemy carrier on fire!

1540
01:55:10,112 --> 01:55:13,948
I repeat,
enemy carrier on fire. Returning to base.

1541
01:55:14,283 --> 01:55:15,741
That wasn't
Kobayashi's voice.

1542
01:55:15,867 --> 01:55:17,326
It was Petty Officer
Nakoda, sir.

1543
01:55:17,411 --> 01:55:20,079
Apparently none
of the senior officers survived.

1544
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:22,915
Captain, the scout plane
from the Soryu is approaching.

1545
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,333
He signaled that
his radio is out.

1546
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:30,506
He's gonna
be okay, Captain.

1547
01:55:30,591 --> 01:55:33,384
We're gonna transfer him
in half an hour or so, sir.

1548
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:56,282
Hi, Dad.

1549
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:02,079
I'll see you back
at Pearl, Tom.

1550
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:08,210
There's a picture
of Haruko and me

1551
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:11,088
that I'd like you
to bring ashore.

1552
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,884
Sure, I'll take
care of it, tiger.

1553
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:22,725
Thanks, Dad.

1554
01:56:31,068 --> 01:56:33,694
DELANEY: Only one
boiler is lit, sir. The other five are out.

1555
01:56:33,779 --> 01:56:35,196
Can you get them
on the line again?

1556
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:36,530
Yes, sir.

1557
01:56:36,615 --> 01:56:39,241
I think I can guarantee
you about 15 knots in an hour or so.

1558
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:40,534
Very good.

1559
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:43,496
Now, Delaney,
pass the word along to your black gang.

1560
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,581
We've got
the topside fires under control.

1561
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:47,208
Aye-aye, sir.

1562
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:51,504
Matt, we have
more planes than pilots now.

1563
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:53,756
Can you fly one off
for me when we go?

1564
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,257
Sure, Murr.

1565
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:04,767
Did you confirm it?
Yes, sir.

1566
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:06,811
Admiral Fletcher's
reply just came in.

1567
01:57:06,895 --> 01:57:11,148
"Fletcher to Nimitz,
confirm previous report, three enemy carriers afire."

1568
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:12,900
Hallelujah!

1569
01:57:13,151 --> 01:57:16,445
Three of their
first-line carriers, Admiral!

1570
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:19,323
Isn't that worth at least
a "hot-diggity-damn"?

1571
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:21,200
I'll take it
under advisement, Joe,

1572
01:57:21,284 --> 01:57:23,869
but there's still that
fourth enemy carrier to deal with.

1573
01:57:23,954 --> 01:57:26,372
There's also
a message from Captain Buckmaster, sir,

1574
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:27,832
the Yorktown's
been hit.

1575
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,291
Badly?
Yes, sir.

1576
01:57:29,376 --> 01:57:32,169
But she is
underway again. Operational.

1577
01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:36,382
My gosh,
our whole force may be in jeopardy

1578
01:57:36,466 --> 01:57:38,217
if the Japanese
located the Yorktown.

1579
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:40,845
They still got
a tremendous fleet out there, Admiral.

1580
01:57:40,929 --> 01:57:43,889
But that fourth carrier
can't be far off.

1581
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:48,227
We've already won
a great victory, Admiral.

1582
01:57:49,146 --> 01:57:51,272
Maybe we ought
to get our people out of there.

1583
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:53,649
You mean, break off,
run for home?

1584
01:57:54,151 --> 01:57:56,152
Before they can
hurt us again? Yes, sir.

1585
01:57:59,865 --> 01:58:02,658
Well, that might be
the smart play, Commander.

1586
01:58:02,743 --> 01:58:06,537
Trouble is, I want
that fourth carrier.

1587
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:22,470
What's the matter?

1588
01:58:22,554 --> 01:58:25,347
Your right wing tank,
Lieutenant, it's punctured.

1589
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:26,932
We haven't had
time to repair it.

1590
01:58:27,017 --> 01:58:28,058
Is the left tank
fuelled?

1591
01:58:28,143 --> 01:58:29,226
Yes, sir.

1592
01:58:30,353 --> 01:58:33,689
A few hours ago
we filled the sky with our planes.

1593
01:58:33,774 --> 01:58:38,402
Now we win or lose
with six fighters and 10 torpedo planes.

1594
01:58:47,788 --> 01:58:50,164
The skipper wants to know
if can you maintain this speed, Delaney.

1595
01:58:50,248 --> 01:58:51,248
DELANEY:
Eighteen knots, sir.

1596
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,083
Eighteen knots.
Very good.

1597
01:58:53,168 --> 01:58:54,543
Yeah, sure,
we're ready to launch.

1598
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:56,879
All we gotta do
is find this fourth Jap flattop.

1599
01:58:56,963 --> 01:58:58,339
CIC OFFICER:
Bridge-phone, Combat.

1600
01:58:58,423 --> 01:58:59,507
Go ahead, Combat.

1601
01:58:59,758 --> 01:59:01,383
Sir, report
from Scouting 5.

1602
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:03,928
Lieutenant Adams
has located the fourth enemy flattop.

1603
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:07,348
Good. Relay our position
to Admiral Fletcher.

1604
01:59:07,432 --> 01:59:09,350
Aye-aye, sir.
We found him, Delaney.

1605
01:59:09,434 --> 01:59:11,310
Okay, just give us
all the old lady's got left.

1606
01:59:11,394 --> 01:59:12,436
Bridge-phone, Combat.

1607
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:13,562
Go ahead, Combat.

1608
01:59:13,730 --> 01:59:17,441
Sir, radar has bandits.
Distance, 35 miles, closing.

1609
01:59:17,526 --> 01:59:18,818
This time,
they're coming in low.

1610
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:19,985
Torpedo attack!

1611
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:21,904
Sound general quarters!
Aye-aye, sir.

1612
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:23,280
Let's get everything
we have left airborne

1613
01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:24,990
while we still can.
Guess we better.

1614
01:59:25,075 --> 01:59:26,826
MAN ON PA:
General quarters! General quarters!

1615
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:29,453
All hands man
your battle stations!

1616
02:00:48,909 --> 02:00:50,159
Right, full rudder!

1617
02:00:50,285 --> 02:00:51,535
Right, full rudder, aye!

1618
02:01:09,471 --> 02:01:11,764
Watch out there!
Get outside!

1619
02:01:26,863 --> 02:01:27,863
Get Fred out of here.

1620
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:29,031
This way.

1621
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:23,919
Whirlwind,
this is Zephyr 3!

1622
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:25,921
Two torpedoes
hit the carrier!

1623
02:02:26,297 --> 02:02:30,634
I repeat, two torpedoes
hit the carrier! Returning to base.

1624
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:34,138
Now it's one
against one, Admiral. Congratulations.

1625
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:41,729
Delaney, what's
the situation below?

1626
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:43,522
No good, sir.
All boilers are out.

1627
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:44,732
There's no hope
of relighting them.

1628
02:02:44,983 --> 02:02:47,151
Get your people topside,
and on the double!

1629
02:02:47,235 --> 02:02:48,527
Aye-aye, sir.

1630
02:02:52,449 --> 02:02:56,744
Larry, radio Enterprise,
we'll land there after we make our bomb run.

1631
02:02:56,828 --> 02:02:57,870
Yes, sir.

1632
02:02:57,954 --> 02:03:00,706
Blue Leader to Home Plate!
Blue Leader to Home Plate!

1633
02:03:03,752 --> 02:03:05,085
How many are
we sending out?

1634
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:06,837
Twenty-four
dive-bombers, sir.

1635
02:03:06,921 --> 02:03:09,882
We'll have to try it
without fighter protection.

1636
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:11,675
What about
the Hornet?

1637
02:03:11,801 --> 02:03:13,135
Scraping the bottom
of the barrel.

1638
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:14,720
Sixteen dive-bombers left,

1639
02:03:14,804 --> 02:03:18,766
plus the three that
Matt Garth is bringing over from the Yorktown.

1640
02:03:19,267 --> 02:03:22,436
Signal the Hornet,
we attack immediately.

1641
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:23,979
Aye-aye, sir.

1642
02:04:32,757 --> 02:04:35,467
Sir, it couldn't have
been the same carrier Kobayashi dive-bombed.

1643
02:04:35,552 --> 02:04:37,469
She was undamaged
and under full steam.

1644
02:04:37,554 --> 02:04:39,221
We put two torpedoes
into it.

1645
02:04:39,305 --> 02:04:43,350
Kobayashi said he left
the carrier on fire. Did you see any smoke?

1646
02:04:43,434 --> 02:04:45,602
No, sir,
it must have sunk.

1647
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:47,521
We didn't see
a third carrier, either.

1648
02:04:47,605 --> 02:04:50,023
Dive alert!
Enemy dive-bombers!

1649
02:06:10,146 --> 02:06:12,856
Sir, we must withdraw.

1650
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:18,195
How will we apologize
to His Majesty?

1651
02:06:19,155 --> 02:06:20,906
Leave that to me.

1652
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:28,080
I am the only one
who must apologize to His Majesty.

1653
02:06:44,264 --> 02:06:45,681
Thank you.

1654
02:06:46,849 --> 02:06:48,684
That was
the LSO, sir.

1655
02:06:48,893 --> 02:06:52,187
Matt Garth is coming in.
His plane is all shot up.

1656
02:08:27,533 --> 02:08:30,619
Well, I wonder
if Matt knew how big we won.

1657
02:08:31,996 --> 02:08:34,456
I don't know,
but I think I know what he'd have said.

1658
02:08:36,042 --> 02:08:38,668
"It doesn't make
any sense, Admiral.

1659
02:08:39,545 --> 02:08:41,671
"Yamamoto had
everything going for him.

1660
02:08:41,756 --> 02:08:45,133
"Power, experience,
confidence.

1661
02:08:46,761 --> 02:08:50,222
"Were we better
than the Japanese, or just luckier?"
