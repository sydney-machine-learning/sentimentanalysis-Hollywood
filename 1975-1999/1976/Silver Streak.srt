1
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,573
- Yes, sir. Where to?
- It's the train to Chicago. The Silver Streak.

2
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:38,379
- Silver Streak. I'll take care of your bags, sir.
- Thank you.

3
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:42,013
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thanks

4
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,766
What are those conventioneers
doing up at the baggage car?

5
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:58,665
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Now, ain't that somethin'?

6
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:01,172
I thought it was bad enough with the
hippies on board. Now we got their fathers.

7
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,670
Oh, we had to get Mary Lou.

8
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,739
- She's our date for the party.
- Come on, Conductor! Let's get this show on the track!

9
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,681
Oh, ho, ho.
I beg your pardon, sir.

10
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:16,180
Hello. Am I in the right place?

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,225
First class. Yes, sir.
Right this way.

12
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,953
Watch your step there.

13
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:35,097
- This is your room here, sir.
- Okay, thanks a lot.

14
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:36,834
- Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant trip.
- Bye-bye.

15
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:41,641
Sir, you think you're gonna be needin'
all these bags up here? If not, I can store
some of'em down at the other end.

16
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,511
- Sure, sure. All I need is this one and that one.
- Okay.

17
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:46,482
- You can take this. I'll keep the briefcase.
- I'll take that.

18
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,882


19
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:50,581
- Is this the bed?
- Yeah. I'll be makin' that up a little later on.

20
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,487
Okay, thanks.

21
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,720
- And this is...
- Your lavatory and sink, sir.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,456
- Nice, big room.
- Very convenient.

23
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:01,794
- What's this partition?
- Oh, that turns the room into a double suite..

24
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:04,926
We used to have a lot of calls for 'em...
from the honeymooners.

25
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,629
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,572
I'm not doing it on purpose.
This latch seems to be stuck.

27
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,937
Everything's changed.
Did you say something?

28
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,576
No! No. I-I agree with everything you said.
All I wanna do is take it easy.

29
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:21,812
Good, good. Then just settle back
and enjoy the trip.

30
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:25,447
Because it ain't gonna be too exciting,
now, but we'll get you there on time.

31
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,218
- Okay. Have a nice rest.
- Thanks a lot.

32
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:29,225
- Bye-bye.
- Good evening.

33
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,060
Board!

34
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,216
So long, L.A.! Bye!

35
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,976
Do you like this perfume?

36
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,983
I mix it myself.

37
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:09,246
Lovely. Very nice.

38
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,090
That's something, huh?
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,363
We leave Los Angeles,

40
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,406
and we go right up there to Nevada...

41
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:28,998
into Colorado, across the Rockies...

42
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:31,441
up to Kansas City, Kansas.

43
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:34,708
Right in here's a town
called Ashland, Missouri.

44
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:39,480
Cross the big Mississippi.
Two and a half days, right up
there in Chicago, Illinois.

45
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,521
- That's some trip, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,317
- You from Chicago?
- No, Los Angeles.

47
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,415
I'm from Chicago.

48
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,153
My name is Bob Sweet.

49
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,287
A sweet man, but a mean baby.

50
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:52,024
- George Caldwell.
- Yeah?

51
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:55,658
Yeah, George,
what racket you in?

52
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:58,999
- Publishing.
- No kidding? Come on. Sit down here.
- Thanks.

53
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,801
You know, I'm in vitamins myself.

54
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:06,144
Mm-hmm. Here.
There's a sample for ya. Vitamin "E."

55
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:08,442
Now, that is great
for the old pecker.

56
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:13,812
Yeah, it really keeps
the pencil sharp, and I'm not kiddin'.

57
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:17,652
Have you had a chance yet
to check out the action?

58
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,715
No. Actually, this is the first time
I've ever taken a train.

59
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,728
- You're kidding me?
- No.

60
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:24,448
Come on

61
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:28,265
- Well, you're in for the ride of your life.
- Oh, yeah?

62
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:33,361
You just pick out a little chickie, my friend...
and it's hug and munch all the way to Chicago.

63
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:36,663
- Really?
- I do it all the time.

64
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:41,610
I tell my boss that I'm afraid of flying...
and I get this action twice a year.

65
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,105
It's a cathouse on wheels.

66
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:47,276
No... Hey, listen.
Come on.

67
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:52,051
It's something about the movement
of the train that does it.
All that motion makes a girl horny.

68
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:57,291
Well, I'll tell you, Bob. I'm not really
interested in a shipboard romance.

69
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,922
- I took the train to rest and get a lot
of reading done.
- Hold it, hold it.

70
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:04,794
Right there, George.
I believe I see my chickie for tonight.

71
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:11,171
Hi, there. Can I, uh,
buy you a drink?

72
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,968
- I have one. Thank you.
- Well, I'll just, uh, join you then, huh?

73
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,139
That's an old-fashioned, bartender.

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,479
- You go all the way?
- What?

75
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,997
I said, do you go all the way...
to Chicago?

76
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:38,459
Oh. Yes, I do.

77
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:46,537
- Well, then maybe we can do it together.
- Do what?

78
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,540
- Go to Chicago.
I mean, you know, we're gonna be, uh...

79
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,674
stuck on this train together,

80
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,650
and we can't jump off.

81
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:01,248
Do you feel that motion?

82
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:10,364
Are you hot?

83
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:11,084
What?

84
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,635
I said, are you hot?

85
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:19,968
Lady, I am always hot.

86
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,108
Maybe I can cool you down.

87
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,322
How's the latch? May I?

88
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:17,421
Yes. Please, sit down.

89
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,558
What a nice surprise.

90
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,400
I said, how's the latch?
We have connecting rooms.

91
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,304
The latch. Good.
It's good. It's fine. Thank you.

92
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:32,606
It's a little bit rusty, but nothing serious.
I'll get the porter to look at it.

93
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,104
There's no rush, is there?

94
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,282
Would you folks like a cocktail?

95
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,915
Uh, a martini on the rocks
with a twist.

96
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,184
- Two.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,932
- My name is George Caldwell.
- Hilly Burns.

98
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:01,368
That's short for Hildegard.
What's that pencil for?

99
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:04,967
Oh, you have to fill out
your own menu card.

100
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:11,781
"One macedoine of fruit,
beef Oriental, rice, carrots...

101
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:14,478
coffee, apple pie a la mode. "

102
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,044
You print very well.

103
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,879
Thanks.

104
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:23,622
I'll have the same thing.
You do it for me.

105
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:29,128
I can't even read my own writing.

106
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:32,328
I don't do shorthand,
and I can't type.

107
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:34,394
What do you do for a living?

108
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:36,303
I'm a secretary.

109
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,476
- Well, how do you keep your job?
- I give great phone.

110
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,442
I have a terrific personality.

111
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,215
- You going to Chicago?
- Yes.

112
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,051
I'm going to my sister's wedding.

113
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,490
How come you're taking the train?
You afraid of flying?

114
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,926
No, I'm not afraid of flying.

115
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:03,262
I, uh... I just want to be bored.

116
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,630
And you?

117
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,937
Oh, my new boss
likes the old-fashioned ways.

118
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,508
He's just written a book
on Rembrandt...

119
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:19,776
and he's gonna kick off his publicity
campaign with a lecture at the Art Institute.

120
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,147
Oh, yes? I'm in publishing.
What's his name?

121
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,652
Professor Arthur Schreiner.
Have you heard of him?

122
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,054
Most people haven't.

123
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:32,993
He's, um... He's been a recluse
working on this book for about  20  years.

124
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,553
- Where is he now?
- Oh, he's in bed...

125
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:38,999
with a glass of hot milk and molasses.
He's a health nut.

126
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:42,559
- What do you publish?
- Oh, mostly nonfiction.

127
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,698
Gardening, cook books,
how-to-do-it books.

128
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,200
Like sex manuals?

129
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,071
- I've edited a few.
- An authority, huh?

130
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:59,150
I know what goes where...
and why.

131
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:04,854
- That's very interesting. Are you married?
- Divorced.

132
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:07,489
How come?

133
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:15,894
My friends all told me that
my wife was too good for me...

134
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:18,962
and after a couple of years
I decided they were right.

135
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:21,775
Sounds sad.

136
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:27,842
You say that your boss is in art history.
Is that what you're interested in?

137
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,316
Not really.

138
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,877
just got this job because
I was available. I was willing to travel.

139
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,293
- Would you like some wine with this meal?
- Oh, what a question.

140
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:46,526
Um, we'll have a bottle
of the Mouton Cadet.

141
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:51,393
Very good, sir.

142
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,634
- You do that very well.
- I give great French.

143
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,499
- He'll never talk.
- We gotta find those papers.

144
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,003
Come on.
We'll look in his compartment.

145
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,876
So that was your introduction
to high society?

146
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,048
Look, he was very good to me.

147
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,108
He taught me everything
from the pill to Picasso.

148
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,447
- What was missing?
- A marriage license.

149
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:46,848
Is that what you want?

150
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:50,561
I did then.

151
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,797
Right now, I'd like some more
champagne.

152
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:03,434
- Uh-oh. Shall I get another bottle?
- Two.

153
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:10,174
This place seems to be closing down.

154
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,476
Why don't we take our glasses...

155
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:18,021
and go to our rooms?

156
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,458
We could even open
the connecting door.

157
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:27,631
We could even break down
the whole partition.

158
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,126
- I'll speak to the porter.
- I'll get the champagne.

159
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,344
You were right.
It's that motion.

160
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:52,752
I didn't understand it,
but you were right.

161
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:57,057
Good night.

162
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:15,099
- Rapist!
- No, no, no, no!

163
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,160
Pardonez-moi, por favor.

164
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,621
Excuse me.

165
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,395
Um, this won't take a minute.

166
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:41,826
Good.

167
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:45,206
Excellent. These are all right.

168
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:46,706
Sorry. Good evening.

169
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:58,739
Come in.

170
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:09,790
This is very nice.

171
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:13,825
- Would you like some champagne?
- Yes.

172
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:17,234
I can't get over the size of this room
without the partition.

173
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:23,443
They are small rooms by themselves.
They're perfect forjuggling.

174
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:24,907
- For what?
- For juggling.

175
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,810
When you practice, the balls would
always bounce off the walls.

176
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:32,141
Do you juggle a lot?

177
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,478
I know what goes where and why.

178
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:45,454
I like that song.

179
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:51,101
If I ever hear it again...
it'll be difficult not to think of you.

180
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:56,263
- You put that very nicely.
- Thanks.

181
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:08,347
To traveling by train.

182
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,786
Trains that pass in the night.

183
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:31,839
You like my new shoes?

184
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,106
- Yes, I do.
- Why don't you take them off?

185
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:39,309
You can put them in that little locker over there...
and the porter will have them shined for you
in the morning.

186
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:42,375
- Really?
- That's terrific.

187
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:49,816
- Is that the master's work?
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,523
He gave me this copy
for safe keeping.

189
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,228
Do you want to read it?

190
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,160
Slide over.

191
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,963
It's beautiful, isn't it?

192
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,636
Very.

193
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,792
Do you really edit sex manuals?

194
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,591
I really, really do.

195
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,061
But I have a confession to make.

196
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:11,332
I'm much better
at books on gardening.

197
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:14,397
- Really?
- That's my specialty.

198
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,572
Well...

199
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:23,974
is there anything that
you might wanna pass on?

200
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,916
- You mean about gardening?
- Yes.

201
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:33,558
Some helpful hints
for the beginner.

202
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:36,723
Well...

203
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,059
One tip is...

204
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:45,070
always be nasty to nasturtiums.

205
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,736
- Is that so?
- They love that.

206
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:52,107
- They like it rough?
- The rougher, the better.

207
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:53,770
Great.

208
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:59,718
What else should I know?

209
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:04,056
I could teach you the secret
of how to treat azaleas.

210
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,183
Oh, tell me.
I'm all ears.

211
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:08,557
I can see that.

212
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,152
Well...

213
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:14,489
just treat them the same way
as you would a begonia.

214
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:18,162
- No kidding?
- That's gospel.

215
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:21,968
You mean what you're saying is what's
good for azaleas is good for begonias?

216
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:25,807
- You got it.
- George, this is fascinating.

217
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:28,312
I thought you'd be interested.

218
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:31,042
I'd like to delve deeper.

219
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:34,017
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

220
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:52,331
What would happen if you treated
an azalea like a nasturtium?

221
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:57,431
Now, this is the really interesting part.

222
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,518
- What is it, George?
- Did you see it? Did you see that man?

223
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:14,956
- What man?
- There was a man
hanging outside this window.

224
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:17,790
- He was shot in the head.
- What?

225
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,559
Hilly, a dead man
fell off the roof.

226
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,363
I saw it. His coat was stuck.

227
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,773
Oh. I should do something.

228
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,937
I should report it.
Maybe they could stop the train.

229
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:38,913
George, I'm sure
you saw something.

230
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:42,509
You probably saw a kid's kite
or an old newspaper out...

231
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,920
Look! Like that. You see, George,
it could have been anything out there.

232
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:50,592
But his eyes were so clear.

233
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:54,095
I think they were clearer
than your head.

234
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:56,928
- You imagined this, George.
- I didn't. I know I didn't.

235
00:20:56,928 --> 00:21:00,060
Then why don't you call the conductor
and tell him your story?

236
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:05,370
- I feel dizzy.
- You know what? Here.

237
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,432
Lie down here, George.

238
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,778
Whew! If this is what
the D.T. S are like...

239
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:17,046
I'm gonna give up
the bottle for life.

240
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:22,421
The mind plays funny tricks
on you all the time.

241
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:27,224
You know that, George.
Come on. Relax. It's okay. Relax

242
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,822
That sure is a pretty song.

243
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,469
Yes, it is.

244
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,200
You're very beautiful, Hilly.

245
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,677
I like you too, George.

246
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,749
Hilly, wake up.

247
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:10,626
Hi, George.

248
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:15,633
Hilly, the man that I saw outside
the window last night... this is him.

249
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:19,933
- That's my boss. That's Professor Schreiner.
- I know it. That's what I'm talking about.

250
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,940
- What time is it, George?
- It's just after 8:00.

251
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,103
8:00? Oh, no. Wake me up again
when it's after 10:00.

252
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,735
Hilly, this man
has been murdered.

253
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,246
- Well...

254
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:36,310
Why don't you go down the hall
and discuss it with him?

255
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,515
And then come back here
and discuss it with me.

256
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:41,991
He's just right past
the diner, room "C."

257
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:43,584
Hilly, I didn't imagine it.

258
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:48,324
Good night, George.
You're a wonderful gardener.

259
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:21,689
- Rapist.
- Oh!

260
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:26,999
Hey, George, you devil.
Come on. Join me for coffee.

261
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,734
All right. I'll be right back.
I just have to check on something.

262
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,702
What is that?

263
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:52,852
Yeah? What do you want?

264
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:55,397
I'd like to see
Professor Schreiner, please.

265
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:59,959
- Yeah? Who are you?
- My name is George Caldwell.

266
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,970
You a friend of the professor?

267
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,906
No, not exactly. I'm a friend of his secretary's.
We were a little worried about him.

268
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:08,838
Yeah? What are you worried about?

269
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:12,509
Can't I talk to the professor?

270
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,708
What are you doing in there?

271
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,219
I think you're sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

272
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:21,585
You and that broad are gonna
get yourself in trouble.

273
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:23,920
In fact, she's already in trouble

274
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,552
- You're the one who's in trouble,
mister, not me.
- Reace!

275
00:25:26,552 --> 00:25:28,823
Get rid of this bum.

276
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,232
What are you doing?
Who is that?

277
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:36,760
Hey! Listen, you big lummox,
let me go! What the hell are you doing?

278
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,205
Are you crazy?
What the hell's the matter with you?

279
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,402
All right, listen, buster, you're in trouble...
and I mean big trouble,

280
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:45,138
because I'm reporting you.

281
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,914
Oh, no, you can't be serious.
Wait a minute. All right. Enough's enough.

282
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:53,181
If you're willing to forget it...
I don't believe this! Are you kidding?

283
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,092
Goddamn it!

284
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,395
Son of a bitch!

285
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,639
This is terrific!

286
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:11,379
- If that's you, Pepe, you're in one heap of trouble.
- No, it's not Pepe.

287
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:14,753
- Where's Pepe?
- I don't know. My name is George...

288
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:18,260
Goddamn it, I knew it! He's gone off
again with that no accountin' Manuel.

289
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,297
- My name is George Caldwell.
- Those two get together, smoke a little weed.

290
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:24,492
Next thing you know, they're off
buzzing the turkeys in the pickup.

291
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:26,968
- Excuse me, dear.
- I should've fired him 30 years ago.

292
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:29,437
Excuse me.
Do you think I could use your telephone?

293
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:31,235
- Telephone?
- Yes.

294
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:34,471
- You ain't from around here, are you?
- No, I'm lost.

295
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:37,068
I'm not lost, but I was
thrown off of the Silver Streak.

296
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:38,875
Thrown off? That a fact?

297
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:41,508
Tell me, is there a woman in this?

298
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:45,218
- Well, there's a girl, but...
- I knew it.

299
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,749
No, no, no. It's nothing to do
with what you're thinking.

300
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:52,954
Actually, she's in a great deal of danger.
That's why I have to use your telephone...

301
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:55,155
so I can call the police and have those
people who threw me off the train arrested.

302
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:58,826
- Well, it sounds like you're in an awful hurry.
- I am. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

303
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:01,995
That suits me just fine...
'cause I'm running a little bit late myself.

304
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:05,598
- Tell you what, Steve.
- George. George Caldwell.

305
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:07,642
- Rita Babtree.
- How do you do?

306
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:12,146
If you'll finish milking old Harriet over there...
I'll go in and change and you can ride into town with me.

307
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:14,579
- Oh, great!
- The sheriff's a good friend of mine.

308
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:16,776
Wonderful. Just tell me
what I have to do.

309
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:20,048
Well, you just take
this bucket and milk her.

310
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:23,147
Milk her?
I've never milked a cow before.

311
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:27,126
Cut the gas, Steve.
You're a grown man.

312
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,390
I'm sure you've had
some similar experience.

313
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:33,890
Look, you just sit down...

314
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,459
take a tit in each hand and
let nature take its course.

315
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:37,765
All right.

316
00:29:37,765 --> 00:29:39,670
These cows are so full...

317
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,642
it's like tapping a trip valve
on Niagara Falls.

318
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:45,610
- I'll go in and change and meet you
outside in 10 minutes.
- All right.

319
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,510
I'll do my best.

320
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:50,072
Hello.

321
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:55,979
Let's see.

322
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,624
Just be nice.
Be nice.

323
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:01,991
Wait a minute.

324
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:06,191
Something's wrong.
You've got four of them.

325
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:12,595
Oop.! Come on, Harriet.
Come on. Give me a break.

326
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:17,338
Nice, fresh milk.
Here it comes.

327
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:22,177
Nothing's coming out though.
Here we go.

328
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:27,049
All right, now, I know I'm a slow
starter, but where's Niagara Falls?

329
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,015
Hey, Steve, whatcha doin'?

330
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:36,061
I was just looking at my schedule
for the Silver Streak.

331
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:38,528
No, I don't mean that. I mean...

332
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:41,794
why are you sittin' in that car?
We ain't goin' in that.

333
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:44,461
- We aren't?
- No!

334
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:47,973
Come on, Steve.
Follow me.

335
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:56,980
Put these packages
in the front seat...

336
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,209
and I'll get the wheel blocks.

337
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:02,014
I sure hope Pepe
filled it with enough gas.

338
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:04,322
We're not going in that, are we?

339
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:06,821
What's the matter?
You afraid of flyin'?

340
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:09,416
No, no.
I'm not afraid.

341
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:13,259
Great, 'cause it ain't no fun
soarin' with a turkey.

342
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:22,364
Look out for the windmill.
Look out for the windmill!

343
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:32,081
- You okay with those packages?
- Yeah, I guess so.

344
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:36,608
Well, it won't be long. We should be
in Stavely by 2:00.

345
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:42,458
2:00? That's two and a half hours from now.
Where's Stavely?

346
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,653
Sixty miles
the other side of Albuquerque.

347
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:48,724
- Wait a minute.
- What'd you say?

348
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:53,800
The Silver Streak
stops there at 2:27.

349
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,465
If we got there by 2:00 the sheriff
could meet the train when it arrives.

350
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,474
Yeah, I suppose so.

351
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:02,477
- This is fabulous!
- Ain't it the truth?

352
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:07,538
They talk of the joy of sex,
but it don't last like the fun of flyin'.

353
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:29,437
Look! There's the Silver Streak.!

354
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:52,149
- I think we're going to make it.
- Look at those sheep down there.

355
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:56,287
Don't they make a lovely sight?
I'm just itchin'to buzz 'em.

356
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:57,888
To do what?

357
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:00,798
- You never buzzed sheep?
- I don't think so.

358
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:02,995
Hold on, Steve!
We're going in!

359
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:17,573
Look at those little critters run.!

360
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:23,488
Come on.! Let's buzz 'em again.!
Whoo-hoo.!

361
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:38,331
Here we are.

362
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:41,533
- Hello, Rita.
- Hi, Burt. Is the sheriff in?

363
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,974
- He's over at Clancey's Dairy.
He'll be back in about...

364
00:33:43,974 --> 00:33:46,308
Look!
There's the Silver Streak.!

365
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:50,041
- Thank you. Thank you, Rita.
- Don't you wanna go get the sheriff?

366
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:54,211
- No time! Thank you, dear. Good-bye.!
- So long, Steve.

367
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,924
This time, try to stay on!

368
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,963
Come on! Come on!

369
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:08,761
Jump up! Jump!

370
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:12,227
You got it!

371
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:15,136
All right!

372
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,503
Hey, welcome aboard.

373
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:25,310
- Don't you just love train travel?
- I love it.

374
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,010
- Loves it.

375
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,008
I asked you to join me for breakfast.
This is lunch.

376
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:05,281
Sorry. I lost track of time.

377
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,085
Well, what were you doin' back there?

378
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:12,151
Gettin' a little ass?

379
00:35:13,063 --> 00:35:15,258
No, I was squeezing tits.

380
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,562
You are a sexy devil, aren't you?

381
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,364
Kind of worked up a sweat too,
didn't ya, you horny bastard?

382
00:35:27,744 --> 00:35:29,405
Well, what do you expect?

383
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:31,810
I mean, she's a hot little number.

384
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,111
And he's very heavy competition.

385
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:36,174
You know him?

386
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:39,517
Doesn't everybody know him?
That's Roger Devereau.

387
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:43,355
He's Chicago's own jet-setter.

388
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:46,418
I mean, you know, he's a big cheese on
the Art Institute, something like that.

389
00:35:46,418 --> 00:35:49,020
Like I say, very heavy competition.

390
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:51,628
Are you gonna take him on?

391
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,749
Are you all right?

392
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,455
What's the matter?

393
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:00,398
- Honey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

394
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,229
Who left who?

395
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:07,069
Last time I saw you, you were
gonna go visit the professor.

396
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:09,939
- Hilly, the professor is dead.
I'm sure of it.

397
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:11,443
Listen to me.

398
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:13,878
I went to his room
this morning, and he wasn't there.

399
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:17,040
Two dumb thugs
were looking through his things.

400
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,108
They pushed me out of his room
and threw me off the train.

401
00:37:20,108 --> 00:37:22,780
-Threw you off?
-The point is they were searching for something.

402
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,518
I don't know what, but they've killed
the professor for it and now I'm
positive they're gonna go after you

403
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:29,720
We've gotta get off the train
and contact the police.

404
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,391
- No, George, you've got it all mixed up.
- I don't have it mixed up.

405
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:35,627
I'm just worried about you.

406
00:37:41,207 --> 00:37:43,334
Hello, Roger.

407
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:46,139
This is my friend George Caldwell.
Roger Devereau.

408
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,442
- How do you do?
- George has just been telling me
how he'd been thrown off the train.

409
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:56,681
Oh, you're the one? I'm so pleased
to see you. Are you all right?

410
00:37:56,681 --> 00:37:58,552
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Oh, that's good news.

411
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:02,081
As soon as I was told,
I contacted the police in Albuquerque...

412
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:05,391
and told them to spare no expense
to make sure you were safe.

413
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:08,661
Reace... he's like a child... got off
the train and tried to find you...

414
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,395
say he was sorry.

415
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:12,960
- How did you get back on?
- Who's Reace?

416
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,131
He's the one that threw you off.

417
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:20,974
You must remember him... a large man
with not very attractive dental work.

418
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:23,913
I do remember,
but what does he got to do with you?

419
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:26,245
He works for me.
He's my chauffeur.

420
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:28,842
Not very bright,
but extremely loyal.

421
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:33,049
And naturally, I assume total
responsibility for all his actions...

422
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:35,991
and will pay for any damages.

423
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:38,927
And what about that other fellow?

424
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:42,295
I met another man this morning.
Does he work for you too?

425
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,695
Oh, yes, of course.
You don't know the entire story, do you?

426
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:51,208
Early this morning, I was having
breakfast with Professor Schreiner...

427
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:55,371
and he wanted to show me some
important papers connected with his book.

428
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:57,846
But, unfortunately, they were missing

429
00:38:57,846 --> 00:39:01,042
So we searched
his compartment twice...

430
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:04,484
and eventually we discovered them
in his trunk in the baggage room.

431
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:08,314
t was something of an upset,
but if you know the professor....

432
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:11,593
you'll know he's slightly
absent-minded.

433
00:39:11,593 --> 00:39:13,629
Mr. Devereau, I'm very confused.

434
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:16,893
I don't understand how you could've
had breakfast with Professor Schreiner.

435
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:19,696
George thinks
the professor's been murdered.

436
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:24,666
- Murdered?
- That's right, last night.

437
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,538
That's extraordinary.
Why should you think that?

438
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:31,273
Because I saw him fall off the roof
of this train just outside this window.

439
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:34,543
- He was shot in the head.
- You were in this compartment?

440
00:39:34,543 --> 00:39:36,948
I was lying right here.

441
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,450
Hilly, you'll have to go back to
my compartment, straighten it out.

442
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,890
That man Whiney doesn't know
what he's doing. Devereau.

443
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,088
Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce
Professor Schreiner.

444
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:50,393
Professor Schreiner, Mr. Caldwell.

445
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:53,298
- Hello.
- How do you do?

446
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:55,097
What did you do to your jacket?

447
00:39:55,097 --> 00:39:59,539
Mr. Caldwell is the man that Reace
inadvertently threw off the train.

448
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:02,042
Oh, yes.

449
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:06,843
That stupid person.
I do hope you weren't hurt.

450
00:40:06,843 --> 00:40:08,882
No, no.
I'm all right.

451
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:12,750
I suppose I'm to blame
for this morning's fracas.

452
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,257
After all, none of this would've happened
if I hadn't misplaced the Rembrandt letters.

453
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:17,977
The what?

454
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:23,420
It doesn't matter. I'm so glad that you're
all right and managed to get back on the train.

455
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,625
Oh, Professor? Professor,
I put back as much... I put back...

456
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:30,328
Hey, how'd you get here?

457
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:34,898
Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce
an associate of mine, Mr. Whiney.

458
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:38,377
If an apology is due, I'm sure
that he'd be prepared to make it.

459
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:41,472
It's a pity that Reace
is not here to do the same.

460
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,982
Reace, that moron.
It was all his fault.

461
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:46,780
I was looking for the papers.
I never touched you, did I?

462
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,616
- No, no.
- See?

463
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:53,455
It's been very hectic for me.
I think I'll have a scotch and lie down.

464
00:40:53,455 --> 00:40:58,054
- Why don't you use my compartment?
- Thank you. I will.

465
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:01,157
Hilly...
will you help him with that mess?

466
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:04,928
Mr. Caldwell,
it's been nice meeting you.

467
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:08,236
I hope the rest of the trip for both
of us is a little less exhilarating.

468
00:41:08,236 --> 00:41:10,105
Let's hope so.

469
00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:15,908
Well, I think I've made a silly fool
of myself this morning.

470
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:17,642
- No, no, not at all.
- No, no, I did.

471
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:22,449
I was just sticking my nose into a lot
of stuff that's none of my business..

472
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:25,649
and coming up with some crazy ideas.
You were right.

473
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:29,694
I guess I was imagining
a lot of things last night.

474
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,353
Probably the champagne.

475
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:39,094
- Well
- Let me clean your jacket..

476
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:41,867
Oh, that's all right.
I have another one.

477
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:45,342
We get to Chicago tomorrow and
I did come on this trip to do some work.

478
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:47,106
So I'll say good-bye.

479
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:50,706
- Couldn't you possibly join us for dinner?
- Oh, yes, do.

480
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:54,543
Thanks. No.
I think I'll just eat in my room.

481
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:04,793
This latch...
seems to be stuck.

482
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:09,223
I'll get the porter
to fix it right away.

483
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,294
What are you up to there, lover boy?

484
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,358
Hello, Bob Sweet.

485
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:48,027
- Hello, Bobby.
- How are ya?

486
00:42:49,406 --> 00:42:50,634
I'm all right.

487
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:54,609
Better yet, uh, what are you?
A miniature alcoholic?

488
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,909
Did you know that
the Blanard Tunnel...

489
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,449
was the highest point on this line?

490
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:01,813
Yeah, I knew that.

491
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:05,047
Did you know that when we reach it,
I intend to be higher?

492
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:08,719
- Just don't fall off, huh? Okay?
- Oh, no.

493
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,386
I've left this train once already.
That's enough.

494
00:43:12,386 --> 00:43:15,089
You have? What do you mean?

495
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:17,462
Last night...

496
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:20,127
just as I was about to...

497
00:43:21,237 --> 00:43:23,899
kiss my beautiful blonde...

498
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:27,238
I saw her boss
hanging outside the window.

499
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,573
Wait. You saw her boss,
Professor Schreiner, huh?

500
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,374
That's him.

501
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:33,347
That's the fellow.

502
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:35,441
He was shot in the head.

503
00:43:37,085 --> 00:43:39,576
I knew that
I had been drinking...

504
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:42,316
so I went to see
the professor this morning...

505
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:45,154
and I found this
little weasel of a guy in his room.

506
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:47,558
- Edgar Whiney.
- That's him.

507
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:51,087
- How did you know that?
- Oh, I-I know. I just know.

508
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,157
Go on, go on.

509
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:55,964
Well, then this huge mountain...

510
00:43:55,964 --> 00:43:58,767
with a gold mine stuck in his gums...

511
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:02,901
picked me up and
threw me off the train.

512
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:06,413
- What... But you never saw the professor, huh?
- No, I saw him.

513
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:08,779
- I saw him this afternoon.
- Where?

514
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,784
In Hilly's compartment.

515
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:14,685
See, the man I saw last night
was a hallucination.

516
00:44:15,622 --> 00:44:18,113
- What did he look like?
- Who?

517
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,626
The professor, you know,
that you saw this afternoon.

518
00:44:20,626 --> 00:44:22,787
Like his picture.

519
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:27,527
- Did he say anything to you?
- Why are you asking me all these questions?

520
00:44:27,527 --> 00:44:30,092
- Did he say anything...
- Nothing, nothing.

521
00:44:30,092 --> 00:44:32,297
He was tired
and wanted to have a scotch.

522
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:36,574
You don't have any ice in your drink.
- That's it! Scotch!

523
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:40,636
Listen. See, you didn't have
a hallucination.

524
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:43,616
The professor's been murdered.

525
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:46,481
The guy you saw this afternoon
was a fake.

526
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:48,281
Oh, no.

527
00:44:48,281 --> 00:44:52,484
Yeah. Listen, I talked to the real
professor last night. I mean it.

528
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:55,254
He didn't wanna have anything
to do with Mr. Devereau.

529
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:58,058
Besides that, he's a health nut.
Doesn't touch alcohol.

530
00:44:58,058 --> 00:45:01,760
Oh, Bobby, just because
you're a vitamin salesman?

531
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,496
My name is Stevens.
I'm a federal agent.

532
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,473
We've been working on this case
for two and a half years.

533
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:13,537
Well, what are you tailing
the professor for?

534
00:45:13,537 --> 00:45:16,673
I am not tailing the professor,
I'm tailing Devereau.

535
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,011
Come on. Let's go.

536
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:20,574
Wait a minute. What about Hilly?

537
00:45:20,574 --> 00:45:23,553
Don't worry about it. They're not
gonna kill her till we get to Chicago.

538
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:26,318
I don't even think they'll try
to kill you till then. Come on.

539
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,521
Devereau's men must've brought the
professor back here...

540
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,427
after 9:00 pm last night.

541
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:37,229
- How do you figure that?
- Because I left him at 9:00 pm.

542
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:41,762
And because this is the easiest access
to the roof. Somehow, he must've escaped.

543
00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:45,367
He got out to this ladder, then ran back
down the train before they shot him.

544
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,743
You're not going up there, are you?

545
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,376
Yeah. The Blanard Tunnel is up ahead.

546
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:58,114
Come on up and
keep a lookout, will ya?

547
00:45:58,114 --> 00:46:00,248
All right, I'll try.

548
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,488
What did you find?

549
00:46:42,488 --> 00:46:44,498
It was hooked on
a protruding bolt.

550
00:46:47,502 --> 00:46:50,733
Then I was right.
I did see him.

551
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:08,417
I'll bet Devereau has already got the body
picked up and placed in cold storage someplace.

552
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,288
Too bad.
He was a sweet old guy.

553
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:15,089
Buy why did he have
to kill the professor?

554
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:19,030
He was going to be embarrassed
by the findings in the professor's book.

555
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:22,460
Two of the institute's Rembrandts...

556
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,403
both bought and authenticated
by Devereau...

557
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:27,566
were going to be proved forgeries.

558
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:31,839
The professor had the proof
in his possession.

559
00:47:32,947 --> 00:47:35,279
I asked him last night,
"What was the proof?"

560
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:40,118
He told me I was going
to have to wait for his lecture.

561
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:42,177
And Devereau wasn't going to wait.

562
00:47:44,524 --> 00:47:47,960
I think the idea
was to kidnap the professor...

563
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,018
then kill him...

564
00:47:50,018 --> 00:47:53,463
and then substitute
some phony look-alike...

565
00:47:53,463 --> 00:47:56,263
who would botch the lecture
and discredit the book.

566
00:47:57,737 --> 00:48:01,195
- We've gotta find the proof.
- But they have the proof.

567
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:04,107
They have it. That's what Whiney
and everyone was looking for this morning...

568
00:48:04,107 --> 00:48:05,644
the Rembrandt letters.

569
00:48:05,644 --> 00:48:09,273
They said that they found them
in the professor's trunk.

570
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:12,318
They're lying. That's the first place
they would've looked...

571
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,785
before they started turning
his room upside down.

572
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:20,182
No! No, the professor hid them
someplace, somewhere simple...

573
00:48:20,182 --> 00:48:23,456
as a precaution when he found out
Devereau was on the train.

574
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:26,089
My God! I know where they are!
Come on! Come on!

575
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,179
The Rembrandt letters.

576
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:57,120
Holy Toledo!
I think you've found it.

577
00:48:59,163 --> 00:49:02,223
This is the genuine article,
penned by the old boy himself, huh?

578
00:49:02,223 --> 00:49:05,895
"Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn. "

579
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:10,363
Yeah. My guess is there's a fact there's
some kind of a date in all this...

580
00:49:10,363 --> 00:49:13,171
that proves the charges the professor
makes in his book.

581
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:16,680
Push the button for the porter, will ya?
I wanna get the conductor to radio ahead
to the next town.

582
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,707
You know, it's difficult to believe
that a man was killed over those.

583
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:24,618
This is the tip of an iceberg.

584
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:27,179
You know that plane crash
in Cologne, Germany last year?

585
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:31,193
That was a Devereau special.
A hundred people got killed in that one.

586
00:49:31,193 --> 00:49:35,095
It was just to cover up his involvement
in the Metropolitan Gallery scandal.

587
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:37,827
We knew he was responsible.
We couldn't pin it on him.

588
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:43,868
These letters are gonna blow his
multimillion-dollar operation in art sky-high.

589
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:48,001
That's why she was so distant.
They must've had her in a corner.

590
00:49:48,812 --> 00:49:51,076
I want you to remember
that your neck is on the line too.

591
00:49:51,076 --> 00:49:53,308
You already told him you saw
the real professor shot.

592
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:57,410
Yeah, I did.
So what do I do now?

593
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,387
You be responsible for Hilly.
Get her off the train and to safety.

594
00:50:00,387 --> 00:50:02,481
- I'm gonna take care of Mr. Devereau.
- Here comes the tunnel.

595
00:50:02,481 --> 00:50:05,459
We'll make our move when the
train gets to Dodge City tonight.

596
00:50:06,562 --> 00:50:09,554
That's appropriate, huh?
Gun smoke at the O.K. Corral.

597
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:18,333
What happened?

598
00:50:20,242 --> 00:50:22,107
Bob, what happened?

599
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:25,471
Put-Put 'em back.

600
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:29,176
Go on, now. Do it.
Get my gun. Take my gun.

601
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:32,686
Take my gun. Go on.
Get the girl off the train, okay?

602
00:50:33,688 --> 00:50:35,349
Go on.!

603
00:50:37,258 --> 00:50:40,386
You know, I got a funny feeling
this bullet was meant for you.

604
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:48,531
Shoot.! That man's dead.!

605
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:53,838
- Holy moly, you shot him!
- I didn't... No.

606
00:50:54,575 --> 00:50:57,774
- No! Wait a minute!
- He's been shot!

607
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,745
A man's been shot!

608
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,507
I didn't shoot him!

609
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:08,915
Hey. Hey, you're not...

610
00:51:08,915 --> 00:51:12,083
Hey! He's not dead!

611
00:54:00,122 --> 00:54:02,351
Hold it!
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

612
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,486
Son of a bitch!

613
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:29,873
Wait! Wait!

614
00:55:35,148 --> 00:55:36,740
Wait!

615
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,613
Wait! Hello!

616
00:55:47,526 --> 00:55:50,984
Hello! Hello, please!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

617
00:55:50,984 --> 00:55:54,157
Wait a...
Come on, please! Stop!

618
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:08,573
Thanks a lot, Eddie.

619
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:14,645


620
00:56:20,858 --> 00:56:22,826
That's it, boys.!

621
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:25,488
Blow those babies'heads off!

622
00:56:32,537 --> 00:56:34,471
Excuse me.

623
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:36,200
Just a minute.

624
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:38,406
Geez, would you look at that!

625
00:56:42,013 --> 00:56:44,608
That boy is somethin', ain't he?

626
00:56:52,123 --> 00:56:53,647
Commercial.

627
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:01,587
- Now, what can I do for you?
- I want to report a murder.

628
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:04,498
A murder. A man's been shot
on the Silver Streak...

629
00:57:04,498 --> 00:57:08,265
and there's a girl who's in great danger.
We have to stop the train.

630
00:57:08,265 --> 00:57:10,670
Now, wait a second.
You say a man's been shot?

631
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:13,839
- Yes.
- Jumpin'Jiminy!

632
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,106
We've never had a murder before.

633
00:57:16,106 --> 00:57:18,978
Sit down.
Have a cup of coffee. Help yourself.

634
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,711
Now, uh, let's get the facts.

635
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,314
- What did you say your name was?
- Caldwell. George Caldwell.

636
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:31,019
I'm from Los Angeles.

637
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:35,189
L.A. Okay.
Who was shot?

638
00:57:35,189 --> 00:57:37,323
- Actually, there were two.
- Two?

639
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:39,925
Yes. The first was Bob Sweet.

640
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:42,061
He was a federal undercover agent.

641
00:57:42,061 --> 00:57:43,628
- A fed? No shit?
- Yes.

642
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,937
And the second was a man
by the name of Reace. I shot him.

643
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:51,106
- You shot him?
- Yes. He shot Sweet.

644
00:57:51,106 --> 00:57:53,580
- Because Sweet was a fed?
- No, because he thought Sweet was me.

645
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,675
- Reace shot Sweet, and you shot Reace?
- Right.

646
00:57:56,675 --> 00:58:00,119
- With a spear gun.
- W-With a what?

647
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:03,056
You see, I took Sweet's gun,
but I dropped it...

648
00:58:03,056 --> 00:58:05,149
so I had to use a spear gun.

649
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:08,925
Uh, don't you...
can't we call someone?

650
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:10,897
Wait a second.
You say you shot Reace with a spear?

651
00:58:10,897 --> 00:58:14,298
Yes. He was going to shoot me.
- With a spear?

652
00:58:14,298 --> 00:58:16,735
No, with a bullet!
He shot the professor.

653
00:58:16,735 --> 00:58:18,898
- Who shot the professor?
- Reace.

654
00:58:18,898 --> 00:58:21,134
- Reace shot Sweet!
- And the professor.

655
00:58:22,744 --> 00:58:24,473
Makes three.

656
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,240
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
The professor was shot last night.

657
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:35,345
- Uh, can't wejust do all of this later?
- Was there anyone else?

658
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,755
- Anyone else what?
- Shot!

659
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:41,921
No. No, but there will be soon
if we don't stop the train.

660
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:46,261
Please, just pick up the phone
and call your superiors.

661
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:48,858
Tell them I have
the Rembrandt letters.

662
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,201
- That's why the professor was shot.
- Was he with the feds?

663
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:55,332
- Who?
- This guy Rembrandt.

664
00:58:57,211 --> 00:59:01,045
- Rembrandt is dead.
- Dead? That makes four.

665
00:59:01,949 --> 00:59:05,214
Listen, feller, you sure you're not
makin'this up as you go along?

666
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:08,686
I'm an officer of the law and I got better
things to do than listen to that funnin'.

667
00:59:10,891 --> 00:59:12,824
That's my hot line.

668
00:59:12,824 --> 00:59:14,951
Now, you take the time to get your facts straight.
When I come back,

669
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:18,724
I want your answers clear and to the point.
Got that?

670
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,062
And you can start
with who shot Rembrandt.

671
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:25,195
Hello. Yeah.

672
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:28,263
This is Chauncey.

673
00:59:30,042 --> 00:59:31,703
No shit!

674
00:59:33,479 --> 00:59:36,880
Jumpin'Jiminy! He's sittin'
right here in my office.

675
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,410
That's right.

676
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,717
Came in here spoutin'some bull about shootin'
some people on the train, wanted to confess.

677
00:59:43,717 --> 00:59:46,690
I knew he was a loony right off.

678
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:49,420
Oh, yeah. Don't you worry.

679
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,055
I've handled loonies before.
Gotcha.

680
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:15,450
Sheriff, I'm sorry.
I guess I was a little rattled before.

681
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,889
- It must've sounded crazy to you.
- Oh, that's perfectly all right, Mr. Caldwell.

682
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:22,687
That is what you said your name was,
didn't you? George Caldwell?

683
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:24,387
Yeah.

684
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,827
I really think that we oughta
get on the phone to Washington.

685
01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:30,458
If they heard what I have to say,
they would stop the train.

686
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:33,162
Oh, yeah. Them boys in Washington,
they're pretty smart.

687
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,501
You ever watch 'em on TV? Bam, bam.

688
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:39,236
Sheriff, listen to me! They know
all about Sweet and Devereau.

689
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:42,438
I figured that the Silver Streak
should be in Kansas in an hour.

690
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,913
We could stop the train
at Scott City or maybe Dodge.

691
01:00:44,913 --> 01:00:49,646
All right, mister! Keep your hands where
they are, and we'll have no trouble!

692
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:52,211
- Give me that!
- Don't shoot.

693
01:00:52,856 --> 01:00:54,653
"Don't shoot"?

694
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:58,626
You stupid, ignorant,
son-of-a-bitch, dumb bastard!

695
01:00:58,626 --> 01:01:02,529
Jesus Christ! I've met some dumb bastards
in my time, but you outdo them all!

696
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:05,295
Get over there! What the hell
do you think I'm doing?

697
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,666
I come here to help a girl
who may be killed at any minute...

698
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:10,069
and you're playing cops and robbers!

699
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:12,505
There ain't no way
you're gonna get away with this!

700
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:15,442
Get a... Pick up the phone!

701
01:01:16,245 --> 01:01:17,803
Pick it up!

702
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:21,073
- We know who you are.
- What are you talking about?

703
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:24,119
That was the county sheriff.
They're comin' to get you. You ain't got a chance.

704
01:01:24,988 --> 01:01:28,424
- Get me for what?
- For killin' a vitamin salesman on the Silver Streak.

705
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:33,018
He was no vitamin salesman. He was
a federal agent. They should know that.

706
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:36,496
If you'll just put down
that gun and come along quietly.

707
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:40,126
You're outnumbered.
Ain't no way you're gonna escape.

708
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:41,829
What is that?

709
01:01:43,772 --> 01:01:45,603
That's my deputy.

710
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,236
- Get outside.
- All right.

711
01:01:48,236 --> 01:01:50,574
- Get outside!
- Don't shoot.

712
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:52,011
- Don't shoot.

713
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,647
- Don't shoot.
- Keep your hands down. Keep your hands down.

714
01:01:58,647 --> 01:02:01,086
- Uncle Oliver, look what I got!

715
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:03,454
- Keep your hands down.
- Uncle Oliver, he's got your gun.

716
01:02:03,454 --> 01:02:06,687
Get your hands up! Get against
the wall. Keep your hands up.

717
01:02:07,128 --> 01:02:10,029
- The whole county knows about you!
- Get back!

718
01:02:10,029 --> 01:02:12,861
- Keep those hands up.
- They ain't gonna rest till they hunt you down.!

719
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:15,834
Keep your hands up. Keep 'em up.

720
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:20,234
Uncle Oliver, he's takin' your car!

721
01:02:20,234 --> 01:02:23,140
You ain't ever gonna get away with this!

722
01:02:24,945 --> 01:02:27,743
- Uncle Oliver! Uncle Oliver, he's got your car.
- Moose!

723
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:30,841
One more word outta you,
I'm gonna smash your mouth!

724
01:02:38,459 --> 01:02:39,983
J.J.! J.J.!

725
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:44,262
I got... I got bad news for ya.

726
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:46,321
Caldwell's escaped.

727
01:02:47,734 --> 01:02:50,567
Yeah, look, let's not go into that now.

728
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,502
He's headed down 350...

729
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,132
and we can stop him
before he crosses the state line.

730
01:02:56,242 --> 01:02:57,402
Right.

731
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:07,251
Dumb, stupid bastard.

732
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:11,479
Shit!

733
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:16,217
- Who are you?
- I'm a thief, man.

734
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:18,229
Take it easy. I ain't
gonna freak you out no more.

735
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:20,663
How about handin' me them keys.
I'd like to get these cuffs off.

736
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,325
Sorry.

737
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:27,604
That's real nice the way you handled
yourself back there with old Oliver. I was listenin'

738
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:30,107
- What they want you for anyway, man?
- Murder.

739
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:33,910
Drop me off anywhere along in here, okay?
I don't mess with the big "M."

740
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:37,915
I'm not stopping anywhere.
Do you know the roads around here?

741
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:41,817
Maybe we could make a deal. I'm not
a murderer. I'm trying to prevent one.

742
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:44,447
But in about a minute, we're
gonna be surrounded by cops.

743
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:47,253
If you can get us out of it,
you'd be doing both of us a favor.

744
01:03:47,253 --> 01:03:49,351
What do you think?

745
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:51,691
I think you better make a right
up here and then a sharp left.

746
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:53,355
I'm comin' over.

747
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:03,373
Jesus Christ, man! That's how you murdered your
victims? Put 'em in a car and bounced 'em to death?

748
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:06,501
- Sorry.
- Sorry, my ass!

749
01:04:06,501 --> 01:04:08,408
You're dangerous.

750
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:14,545
Proves one thing, though.
You don't do this for no livin'..

751
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:18,944
- No, I don't.
- All right. Just take it easy.

752
01:04:18,944 --> 01:04:21,491
I'm gonna take over in a minute..

753
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:23,550
Don't make no more
sudden moves, okay?

754
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:25,925
I'm gonna check with headquarters
and find out the game plan for tonight.

755
01:04:25,925 --> 01:04:27,691
He said he was gonna
get back on that train.

756
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:31,427
He has to cross into Kansas
on 120 or...

757
01:04:31,427 --> 01:04:34,197
on 116 or 350.

758
01:04:34,197 --> 01:04:38,605
Now, I figure if we put stakeouts on
all of those roads, we'll get that feller.

759
01:04:38,605 --> 01:04:43,510
The first should be at the junction
of Taubman's Road, on 116.

760
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,651
- What are you slowing down for?
- There's a truck up ahead.

761
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:51,550
So there's a truck up ahead.

762
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:54,215
We the man.!
Let's turn on the siren...

763
01:04:54,215 --> 01:04:58,250
get them hippies off the road!
Put some foot into it.! Move it.!

764
01:05:01,263 --> 01:05:02,924
Oh, God!

765
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,041
Would you like to drive for a while?

766
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:24,051
Car 36 report your position.
Do you read me?

767
01:05:24,051 --> 01:05:26,178
Car 36. Chauncey,...

768
01:05:26,178 --> 01:05:30,248
we're moving in for the roadblock
at the intersection of Taubman's Road and 116.

769
01:05:30,248 --> 01:05:32,851
That's fine, fellas.
Car 45 is already there.

770
01:05:32,851 --> 01:05:35,521
We're going in
for a double block on all points.

771
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:38,122
The old double roadblock, huh?

772
01:05:38,122 --> 01:05:41,191
That's all I wanted to know, Oliver.
Fasten yourself in, partner.

773
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:47,501
You ain't got nothin' to worry about.
I got the nerve and I got the touch.

774
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:54,077
Better pull it tighter. Real tight.
I used to do this all the time back home in Texas.

775
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:56,912
- Do what?
- Demolition derby.

776
01:05:57,986 --> 01:06:00,113
I hear somethin' comin',
but I can't see anything yet.

777
01:06:00,113 --> 01:06:02,622
That's fine, boys.
We got 'em boxed in now.

778
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,418
- Aren't you gonna slow down?
- Slow down?

779
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:08,257
Open your eyes, man, 'cause
I'm gonna make a criminal out of you yet.

780
01:06:09,296 --> 01:06:11,787
Goddamn it!
Fellas, watch out!

781
01:06:28,815 --> 01:06:31,215
Hello, car 36!
What the hell happened to you guys?

782
01:06:31,215 --> 01:06:36,416
Hey, Chauncey! This is Grover T. Muldoon!
You wanna know what happened?

783
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:39,891
We just whooped your ass!
We whooped your ass!

784
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:49,401


785
01:07:04,383 --> 01:07:08,615
"I don't know. I met him last night."
I've never seen him before.

786
01:07:08,615 --> 01:07:11,555
That's what you told us this morning,
and I'm finding it...

787
01:07:11,555 --> 01:07:14,024
increasingly hard to believe.

788
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:16,755
- Well, it's the truth.
- Is it?

789
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:20,195
No matter, when the time comes,
we'll take care of Mr. Caldwell.

790
01:07:20,195 --> 01:07:23,132
Meanwhile, we're going to take...

791
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:25,726
extremely good care of you.

792
01:07:53,364 --> 01:07:56,356
- What are you doing?
- I'm following the plan. Just changed my mind.

793
01:07:56,356 --> 01:07:59,800
Are you crazy? I thought
we were gonna take the Chevy in back.

794
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,033
Chevy? That's a jerk-off, man!
This here is pure pussy.

795
01:08:03,033 --> 01:08:06,474
Pure pussy?
I'll tell that to the judge.

796
01:08:06,474 --> 01:08:09,740
Don't worry about no judge. This here's
gonna get us to Kansas City on time.

797
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:12,805
Well, how about jail? Did you know
the office was right in front of us?

798
01:08:12,805 --> 01:08:15,750
Go check the guard, okay?
This ain't gonna take but a second.

799
01:08:39,642 --> 01:08:41,633
Hold it right there, nigger.

800
01:08:43,846 --> 01:08:46,542
Hey! How you doin', old dude?
What's happenin'?

801
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,379
Step away from the car.

802
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:51,909
was listenin' to the engine. Sounds real good, man.
- Does it come with whitewalls?

803
01:08:51,909 --> 01:08:53,353
Just move.

804
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:56,358
Okay, I'm gonna move now.
You just take it easy.

805
01:08:56,358 --> 01:08:58,621
I said move!

806
01:09:02,131 --> 01:09:05,293
A pussy, huh?
A pussy!

807
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:07,869
Can we go now?

808
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:11,834
I thought you was an amateur.

809
01:09:11,834 --> 01:09:14,068
You're a real pro.

810
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:18,636
A real pro.

811
01:09:27,055 --> 01:09:29,819
Man, that was beautiful.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

812
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:34,191
- Oh, yeah.
- I mean it. You're a pretty bad old dude.

813
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:36,389
All I wanna do is get to Kansas City
by the morning.

814
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:40,491
Don't worry about that. With this honey,
we're gonna be in Kansas City.

815
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:42,904
You just get some sleep,
'cause we're on our way to Kansas City!

816
01:11:06,485 --> 01:11:08,282
You thinking about her?

817
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:10,452
Yeah.

818
01:11:12,591 --> 01:11:15,321
Crazy thing is I just met her
two nights ago.

819
01:11:16,428 --> 01:11:18,828
That's the way love is.

820
01:11:18,828 --> 01:11:21,024
I always lose my memory
when I fall in love.

821
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:28,531
Like you said, you know,
we just get on the train, get her off...

822
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:31,939
tell the police,
let them handle the rest of that stuff.

823
01:11:35,113 --> 01:11:37,047
Yeah.
Yeah, but what?

824
01:11:40,118 --> 01:11:42,916
I only hope she's still alive.

825
01:11:50,361 --> 01:11:52,261
Arriving passenger Hall...

826
01:11:52,261 --> 01:11:56,925
please report to the information desk
in the north concourse.

827
01:11:58,001 --> 01:12:01,198
Great! We've got 10 minutes!
I'll get the tickets. Just wait right here!

828
01:12:03,006 --> 01:12:06,669
- You go get the tickets, and it's good-bye, George.
- What are you talking about? That!

829
01:12:07,944 --> 01:12:10,811


830
01:12:10,811 --> 01:12:14,715
That's my driver's license picture.
I hate that picture.

831
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:17,583
Yeah? Why don't you just shuffle
right over there and tell them about it.

832
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:23,285
- Are they the police?
- No, they're from Travelers Aid.

833
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:25,828
- How are we gonna get on the train?
- That's a good question.

834
01:12:25,828 --> 01:12:29,798
- I've still got the gun. I could start a diversion.
- Yeah, blow your brains out.

835
01:12:29,798 --> 01:12:32,231
Wait. I got an idea.

836
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:34,064
You come with me

837
01:12:45,981 --> 01:12:48,677
- How much you want for that radio?
- Thirty dollars.

838
01:12:48,677 --> 01:12:51,515
- We'll take it. Pay the man.
- What? Pay the man.

839
01:12:51,515 --> 01:12:54,078
- That's a bad hat you got on.  I'll give you five dollars for it.
- It's yours.

840
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,750
- Thank you. Pay the man.
- What? Pay the man!

841
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:01,157
And another five
for the shoe polish.

842
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:03,755
- What do we want with shoe polish?
- Don't argue. Pay the man.

843
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:08,531
- One, two, three, four. Forty dollars.
- Thank you very much.

844
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:11,766
- Thank you.
- See anything else you want, just make me an offer.

845
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:14,138
- No, thank you.
- Uh, how about a brush?

846
01:13:16,144 --> 01:13:17,475
- Nothing!

847
01:13:18,613 --> 01:13:20,012
Can't win 'em all.

848
01:13:20,012 --> 01:13:24,108
That is the stupidest idea
I have ever heard.

849
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,085
You wanna save that girl's life?

850
01:13:26,085 --> 01:13:29,317
Then it's this or we're dead.
Now take off your jacket.

851
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:31,051
Come on!

852
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:35,190
- I can't pass for black!
- Who're you tellin'?

853
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:38,130
I didn't say I was gonna make you black.,
I said I was gonna get you on the train.

854
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:40,530
We got to make them cops
think you're black.

855
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:45,530
- It'll never work. Never.
- What, are you afraid it won't come off?

856
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:47,836
That's a good joke.
That's humorous.

857
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:50,069
Like that, huh?
May I speak?

858
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:53,705
This is crazy! It'll never work!
Don't you understand?

859
01:13:53,705 --> 01:13:56,544
Are you kiddin'? Look at that.

860
01:13:56,544 --> 01:13:58,812
AI Jolson made a million bucks
lookin' like that.

861
01:13:58,812 --> 01:14:00,649
Now here, you try.

862
01:14:02,422 --> 01:14:04,822
Don't worry about your eyes,
'cause you're gonna be wearin' these.

863
01:14:05,993 --> 01:14:07,756
There you go.

864
01:14:09,463 --> 01:14:11,761
That looks good.
Get on top of your head.

865
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:15,127
Put on my jacket.

866
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:21,303
Then we'll slap this beanie
on your head. There you go.

867
01:14:21,303 --> 01:14:23,171
All right, ace or deuce?

868
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:26,507
That's bad, man! You're lookin' good!
Now here, take this radio.

869
01:14:26,507 --> 01:14:29,309
When you step
out of here, step out like King Shit.

870
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:30,280
You bad!

871
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,681
Put that radio to your ear.
That's gonna help cover your face.

872
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:34,720
Just move with the rhythm of the music.

873
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,188
Move your body with the rhythm of the music.
That's all you gotta remember, okay?
Let me see you try it.

874
01:14:38,188 --> 01:14:42,159
Step to the music.
Step to the music. Yeah.

875
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,356
Step to the music... Stop.

876
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:49,560
How come you whiteys got such a tight ass, man?
How are you gonna walk outta here
with a tan face and that white walk?

877
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,070
Just get into the music.
Come on, George. Loosen up.

878
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:55,572
Listen to the beat.
Let your feet move.

879
01:14:55,572 --> 01:14:58,074
Now, do it! Can't you feel it?
The tempo's right here.

880
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:00,634
Right in there. That's all you gotta do.

881
01:15:00,634 --> 01:15:03,078
Yeah, now try it!
Don't you feel it?

882
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:07,482
Yeah. Needs work, George.
Needs a lot of work. You know that?

883
01:15:07,482 --> 01:15:12,080
Will you practice? Man, you gotta practice,
but let it be loose! Listen to the music.
Follow the beat. Hear?

884
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,217
- Feel it comin' up? Feel it?
- I got it.

885
01:15:15,217 --> 01:15:18,729
It's comin'?
Yeah, that's it.

886
01:15:18,729 --> 01:15:22,563
I'm gonna get the tickets. Okay? I'll be back.
Work on it.

887
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:24,191
God, honkies!

888
01:15:36,614 --> 01:15:39,879
Come on, man, get some jive goin'.
Be cool.

889
01:15:39,879 --> 01:15:42,680
Shake it, but don't break it. That's it.

890
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,687
Hey, man, how do I look?

891
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:46,591
You look sharp, mister.
I feel sharp!

892
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:49,022
You hear? I feel like
the sun around midnight.

893
01:15:49,022 --> 01:15:52,494
You dig? Outta sight!
Get down! Get down!

894
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:56,590
Feelin' good! Feelin' fine!
Feelin' real fine!

895
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:59,692
That's it. Just loosen up
those hips, sugar.

896
01:15:59,692 --> 01:16:01,794
All you whiteys got a tight ass.
Yeah, get that ass movin'.

897
01:16:01,794 --> 01:16:04,533
Outta sight! I'm a macaroni!
Get down! I'm the king!

898
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:06,974
Number one, baby.!

899
01:16:14,384 --> 01:16:18,184
- Um, um, I'm not....
- Hey, you must be in pretty big trouble, fella.

900
01:16:18,184 --> 01:16:21,485
But for God's sake, learn to keep time.

901
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:40,572
Shit, that's my man!
That's my man!

902
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:45,640
- I don't think we'll make it past the cops.
- We'll make it past the cops.

903
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,682
I just hope we don't see no Muslims.

904
01:16:59,628 --> 01:17:01,459
- Who you lookin' for?
- White guy.

905
01:17:01,459 --> 01:17:03,521
Well, if I see any,
I'll let you know.

906
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,400
Your attention, please.

907
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,264
The AMRoad train,
the Silver Streak...

908
01:17:08,264 --> 01:17:12,295
departing for Chicago is now loading
on track three.

909
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:15,433
- This the Chicago train?
- First class. Yes, sir.

910
01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:18,570
There will be no visitors
permitted beyond the gates.

911
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:30,218
Board!

912
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,596
- She's gone.
- Sure that's her compartment?

913
01:17:44,596 --> 01:17:48,368
Yes, of course.
Hey, wait a minute.

914
01:17:48,368 --> 01:17:50,171
Where are my clothes?
All my clothes are gone

915
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:53,474
- You sure this is your compartment?
- Of course I'm sure.

916
01:17:53,474 --> 01:17:56,744
The police must have taken everything
when they found Sweet's body.

917
01:17:56,744 --> 01:17:59,411
We've gotta see if Hilly's
still on the train.

918
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:03,222
How are we gonna do that and
you can't leave this compartment?

919
01:18:03,222 --> 01:18:06,623
Go down to the phony professor's room.
It's four cars back, room "C."

920
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:09,059
Ask him what happened
to his secretary.

921
01:18:10,063 --> 01:18:11,724
Give me the gun.

922
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,891
Now give me your wallet.

923
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:19,133
- What the...
- I gotta get a disguise... a porter's uniform.

924
01:18:19,133 --> 01:18:22,800
You know, these disguises
are getting expensive.

925
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,105
Crime costs.
Where's it at?

926
01:18:25,105 --> 01:18:28,840
Four cars back, room "C."
Stay out of trouble.

927
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:36,206
- Hilly, are you all right?
- George, watch it.! Don't come in here.

928
01:20:05,474 --> 01:20:07,339
Are you all right?

929
01:20:07,339 --> 01:20:11,904
That's what I was gonna ask you.
I'm sorry about your head.

930
01:20:11,904 --> 01:20:15,883
I never would have gone back to the
compartment if I thought that you were gonna...

931
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:18,386
- The Rembrandt letters.
- Devereau's got them.

932
01:20:18,386 --> 01:20:20,581
He found them in your jacket.

933
01:20:21,824 --> 01:20:25,885
- I guess I blew it.
- Poor George.

934
01:20:25,885 --> 01:20:28,396
I tried not to get you involved,...

935
01:20:28,396 --> 01:20:31,922
but they came to me yesterday and they told me
that they'd killed the professor...

936
01:20:31,922 --> 01:20:34,231
and that unless I cooperated,
they'd kill me too.

937
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:36,202
I thought that...

938
01:20:36,202 --> 01:20:39,172
I'd go along with them
and that then you'd get away.

939
01:20:39,172 --> 01:20:43,940
I was really happy when you did,
but I was afraid I'd never see you again.

940
01:20:50,585 --> 01:20:52,416
George, I was so frightened.

941
01:20:53,889 --> 01:20:56,187
So was I.

942
01:20:56,187 --> 01:20:58,351
I was scared you wouldn't be here.

943
01:21:00,295 --> 01:21:01,592
I missed you, Hilly.

944
01:21:03,031 --> 01:21:05,022
You did?

945
01:21:05,022 --> 01:21:07,091
I missed you too.

946
01:21:14,642 --> 01:21:17,110
You've got shoe polish
behind your ear.

947
01:21:22,249 --> 01:21:25,184
I'll explain that to you later.

948
01:21:25,184 --> 01:21:29,188
- Where are we?
- Just passing the Illinois River Canal.

949
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:32,555
Well, how are you?
I hope I didn't slug you too hard.

950
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:35,618
- Where's Devereau?
- Isn't that perfect?

951
01:21:35,618 --> 01:21:39,757
You want to see him,
and he wants to see you.

952
01:21:39,757 --> 01:21:42,165
Ladies first, hmm?

953
01:21:44,538 --> 01:21:46,027
Come in.

954
01:21:49,075 --> 01:21:51,805
Uh, please sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

955
01:21:51,805 --> 01:21:54,005
Miss Burns, how are you?

956
01:21:54,005 --> 01:21:58,449
Bring us some fresh coffee, toast
and marmalade for our guests, would you?

957
01:21:58,449 --> 01:22:00,509
- Yes, sir.
- Right away.

958
01:22:04,624 --> 01:22:08,617
I'vejust been looking over
this correspondence you brought me...

959
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:09,617
And...

960
01:22:10,697 --> 01:22:12,392
uh, it's fascinating.

961
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:14,990
The professor was right.
It's a remarkable find.

962
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:17,502
I'm almost tempted
to destroy it...

963
01:22:17,502 --> 01:22:22,063
but then on the other hand, I've always
had a soft spot for things of beauty.

964
01:22:22,063 --> 01:22:25,337
Particularly when they were genuine.

965
01:22:25,337 --> 01:22:27,071
Whiney, would you put these
in my safe, please?

966
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:29,613
I don't think they propose...

967
01:22:29,613 --> 01:22:31,808
any further threat. Do you?

968
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,691
I hope you're not too disappointed
if this doesn't work.

969
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:43,728
Oh, but on the contrary,
I think it will.

970
01:22:43,728 --> 01:22:47,322
This has been a very difficult project,
and I have made an error or two.

971
01:22:47,322 --> 01:22:51,631
One of them was bringing that man
Reace out here. What happened to him?

972
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:53,728
I shot him.

973
01:22:53,728 --> 01:22:56,568
Good for you.
He probably deserved it.

974
01:22:56,568 --> 01:22:59,040
You did have him kill
the professor, didn't you?

975
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,578
Oh, no. Oh, no.
On the contrary.

976
01:23:01,578 --> 01:23:04,808
He did that on his own.
An unfortunate mistake.

977
01:23:04,808 --> 01:23:09,012
I knew we couldn't kill the professor
until we had the Rembrandt letters.

978
01:23:09,012 --> 01:23:14,718
So I had to set up a scenario whereby
the, uh, professor was kidnapped...

979
01:23:14,718 --> 01:23:18,990
and an imposter impersonated him
in order to discredit him.

980
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:22,191
We would have killed him anyway, but
his escape attempt the other night...

981
01:23:22,191 --> 01:23:23,893
upset the entire scheme.

982
01:23:23,893 --> 01:23:25,799
Come in.

983
01:23:26,871 --> 01:23:29,395
Excuse me, sir.
It's all confirmed.

984
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:32,134
- The car will be waiting at Rockdale.
- Good.

985
01:23:32,134 --> 01:23:34,802
Oh, Mr. Caldwell,
you do rememberJohnson?

986
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:37,472
He played the part
of the professor...

987
01:23:37,472 --> 01:23:41,608
and would have done the same thing
at Chicago, had it been necessary.

988
01:23:42,318 --> 01:23:44,878
How long before
we arrive at Rockdale?

989
01:23:44,878 --> 01:23:47,388
- About an hour and a half, sir.
- Thank you, Johnson.

990
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:51,225
Now all that remains
is to clear up a couple of points.

991
01:23:52,429 --> 01:23:54,090
Meaning the two of you.

992
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:56,257
So I've arranged a new scenario...

993
01:23:56,257 --> 01:23:59,392
wherein you are responsible
for the murder of the professor.

994
01:23:59,392 --> 01:24:03,132
- Why would I kill the professor?
- To get the Rembrandt letters.

995
01:24:03,132 --> 01:24:06,641
He found out and you had to shoot him
because he tried to blackmail you.

996
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,871
Which brings us
more or less up to date...

997
01:24:09,871 --> 01:24:13,437
Except that
in about 45 minutes from now...

998
01:24:13,437 --> 01:24:15,278
the professor's trusty secretary
is going to quarrel...

999
01:24:15,278 --> 01:24:19,184
with her partner/lover...

1000
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:22,587
and shoot him. And he dies...

1001
01:24:22,587 --> 01:24:25,786
but not before shooting her.

1002
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:33,963
Ah, enough of this talk
of plots and scenarios.

1003
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:36,630
Uh, join me in a cup
of coffee, would you?

1004
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:39,097
Coffee, mister?

1005
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:47,276
- Thanks.
- The professor's book
is still gonna be published.

1006
01:24:47,276 --> 01:24:50,215
Oh, yes, indeed, my dear.
But without the letters...

1007
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:54,311
I'm afraid it will be regarded
as the jottings of a revisionist crank.

1008
01:24:54,311 --> 01:24:56,219
An ex-crank,
as a matter of fact.

1009
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,987
The Silver Streak does have its drawbacks,
but please try the marmalade.

1010
01:24:59,987 --> 01:25:02,757
- They do provide an excellent cuisine.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1011
01:25:02,757 --> 01:25:05,355
I'll tell the boys in the kitchen.
We aims to please.

1012
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:07,162
- Coffee, miss?
- No, thanks.

1013
01:25:07,162 --> 01:25:10,693
- He ain't bullshittin' about the cuisine.
- Steward?

1014
01:25:10,693 --> 01:25:13,898
- Is that your lady, man? She's somethin' else.
- Steward!

1015
01:25:13,898 --> 01:25:17,034
- Stand up, mama. Let me get a look at you.
- Steward!

1016
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:20,375
- Mm, mm, mm! Have mercy!
- Steward, you may go. Thank you very much.

1017
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:23,177
- Just a little more coffee?
- No, thank you.

1018
01:25:23,177 --> 01:25:25,150
Half a cup?
Oh, sorry, sir.

1019
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:28,346
- Look what I've done.
- You... Get out of...

1020
01:25:28,346 --> 01:25:30,582
- See what I've done...
- You ignorant nigger!

1021
01:25:30,582 --> 01:25:32,591
Who you callin' nigger, huh?

1022
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:34,752
You don't know me well enough
to call me no nigger!

1023
01:25:34,752 --> 01:25:37,126
I'll slap the taste out your mouth!
You don't even know my name!

1024
01:25:37,126 --> 01:25:39,358
I'll whoop your ass! Beat the white
of your ass.

1025
01:25:39,358 --> 01:25:41,593
- Who are you?
- I'm a thief.

1026
01:25:42,903 --> 01:25:46,168
It's all right, Hilly.
He's a friend of mine.

1027
01:25:46,168 --> 01:25:49,230
- Hello.
- Hi.

1028
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:51,708
- So this is Mr. Big.
- That's the man.

1029
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:54,510
You ain't sayin' shit now, Mr. Big.

1030
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:58,277
I must admit that I'm slightly
at a loss for words.

1031
01:25:58,277 --> 01:26:00,944
But on the other hand,
I should warn you...

1032
01:26:00,944 --> 01:26:02,851
that you are a killer...

1033
01:26:02,851 --> 01:26:05,891
and you are wanted by the police
in every state...

1034
01:26:05,891 --> 01:26:09,792
and I recommend that
you, uh, be careful.

1035
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:14,158
You're the killer who's wanted
by the police in every state.

1036
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:18,962
That man you had shot wasn't a vitamin
salesman. He was a federal agent.

1037
01:26:18,962 --> 01:26:22,007
They've been after you
for two years.

1038
01:26:22,007 --> 01:26:26,134
Ever since that plane crash
in Cologne, Germany...

1039
01:26:26,134 --> 01:26:29,476
when you caused a hundred people
to die, just to cover up your link...

1040
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,243
with the scandal
at the Metropolitan Gallery.

1041
01:26:32,243 --> 01:26:35,775
So why don't we get them
the proof that they wanted?

1042
01:26:36,854 --> 01:26:39,584
Let's go and get
the Rembrandt letters.

1043
01:26:47,131 --> 01:26:48,655
Get up.

1044
01:26:49,634 --> 01:26:51,431
If you insist.

1045
01:27:04,982 --> 01:27:06,745
- Get up, Whiney!
- Just do what he says.

1046
01:27:10,787 --> 01:27:12,778
Get the letters, Hilly.

1047
01:27:12,778 --> 01:27:14,653
Mr. Caldwell...

1048
01:27:14,653 --> 01:27:17,250
I take it that you are
a reasonable man and that,...

1049
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:21,161
like all men, you place
a reasonable value on your life.

1050
01:27:21,161 --> 01:27:22,721
Are you trying to bribe me?

1051
01:27:22,721 --> 01:27:26,565
No. I'm merely pointing out
that life is short...

1052
01:27:26,565 --> 01:27:30,334
and the smart man
hedges his bets.

1053
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:32,601
You can't protect bets.

1054
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:34,802
If there's one thing
I have learned from this trip...

1055
01:27:34,802 --> 01:27:37,937
it's that you play the game
and take what you get.

1056
01:27:37,937 --> 01:27:40,608
- I found them!
- Come here, Hilly.

1057
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:42,510
Get the girl.!

1058
01:27:57,366 --> 01:27:59,960
What do you think this is?
A western?

1059
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:06,301
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to save our asses!

1060
01:28:06,301 --> 01:28:09,707
- I'm not jumping!
- There's a bridge coming up. Get ready!

1061
01:28:09,707 --> 01:28:13,009
Goddamn it, I'm not jumping!
I left this train twice already!

1062
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:15,982
- Get ready.!
- I'm not jumping!

1063
01:28:15,982 --> 01:28:18,542
Here it comes! Go!

1064
01:28:22,157 --> 01:28:23,749
Son of a bitch!

1065
01:28:27,996 --> 01:28:29,486
Shit!

1066
01:28:30,799 --> 01:28:32,630
Not again!

1067
01:28:50,884 --> 01:28:52,647
What are we gonna do now?

1068
01:28:52,647 --> 01:28:55,553
All right.!
Hold it right there.!

1069
01:28:59,393 --> 01:29:00,951
Shit.

1070
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:33,554
I just talked to Chaney. He'll have
the helicopter ready in Rockdale.

1071
01:29:33,554 --> 01:29:35,617
Just about five minutes from the station.

1072
01:29:36,629 --> 01:29:38,153
We'll be there in 46 minutes.

1073
01:29:38,153 --> 01:29:43,134
Is there any way of stopping
this train between here and there?

1074
01:29:43,134 --> 01:29:46,069
Aside from the engine, there's
an emergency brake in each car.

1075
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:49,940
- Disconnect them.
- Okay. All of them?

1076
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:52,476
Yes, all of them.
And take her with you.

1077
01:29:53,578 --> 01:29:54,943
Come on.

1078
01:30:20,505 --> 01:30:22,666
They're yours.

1079
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:25,209
- You George Caldwell?
- Will you please...

1080
01:30:25,209 --> 01:30:28,040
Would you just tell me...
Goddamn it!

1081
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:31,081
Would you please tell me what the hell
we're doing here and what you want from me!

1082
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:33,446
- You are George Caldwell?
- Yes, I'm George Caldwell.

1083
01:30:33,446 --> 01:30:36,680
- I want some information from you, and fast.
- I did not kill Sweet.

1084
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,654
We know that. And if you weren't
so dumb,...

1085
01:30:38,654 --> 01:30:41,816
you would've realized that we planted
that news story for your own protection.

1086
01:30:41,816 --> 01:30:45,828
I've had men posted in every town
since Dodge City trying to pick you up...

1087
01:30:45,828 --> 01:30:48,023
while you're gallivanting around
the countryside wasting time.

1088
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:52,034
- I didn't know they were federal agents!
- Well, let's see what you do know.

1089
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,332
Here.

1090
01:30:56,332 --> 01:30:59,706
- How many men has Devereau got on the train?
- Two.

1091
01:30:59,706 --> 01:31:02,904
- What's his plan after they get to Chicago?
- He's not going to Chicago.

1092
01:31:02,904 --> 01:31:05,072
He's getting off at Rockdale.

1093
01:31:06,049 --> 01:31:08,210
I was afraid of that.
Okay.

1094
01:31:10,452 --> 01:31:12,943
Matthews, over here!

1095
01:31:14,456 --> 01:31:17,084
We're gonna stop the train
before Rockdale.

1096
01:31:17,084 --> 01:31:20,492
Closest is...
the Harris Mill Junction.

1097
01:31:20,492 --> 01:31:24,590
Contact the railroad. Tell them to make
out like it's a routine emergency inspection.

1098
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:27,500
Have Bronsky bring his men
up in choppers from the south..

1099
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:30,266
Get all the passengers off the train,
and I don't want any slip-ups.

1100
01:31:30,266 --> 01:31:33,240
We'll be there as soon as we can.
Caldwell, you come with us.

1101
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,139
Steward, what do you want to do?

1102
01:31:35,139 --> 01:31:38,407
This has been a nerve-shattering
experience. I'd like to go home.

1103
01:31:39,214 --> 01:31:40,841
Take him anywhere he wants.

1104
01:31:40,841 --> 01:31:43,349
Okay, men, grab your rifles.
Let's move it.!

1105
01:31:43,349 --> 01:31:46,444
Caldwell, your shells.

1106
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:47,908
Let's go.!

1107
01:31:49,357 --> 01:31:53,054
- What does he think I'm gonna do with this?
- Blow the tires out on the train.

1108
01:31:53,828 --> 01:31:55,090
Thanks for everything.

1109
01:31:57,432 --> 01:31:58,831
My pleasure.

1110
01:31:59,834 --> 01:32:02,132
Goddamn it.!
Caldwell, get out here.!

1111
01:32:02,132 --> 01:32:05,661
If there's ever anything
that you need...

1112
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:10,740
don't call me.

1113
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,607
Don't let 'em get you killed.

1114
01:32:19,519 --> 01:32:22,613
Take it easy, killer.
Stay loose.

1115
01:32:38,572 --> 01:32:40,733
Where'd you like to go, fella?

1116
01:32:40,733 --> 01:32:42,138
Well..

1117
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:46,805
I left myJag in Kansas City.

1118
01:33:01,427 --> 01:33:03,657
I don't know, Frank,
but that's what they said.

1119
01:33:03,657 --> 01:33:05,924
Everybody off
at the Harris Mill Junction.

1120
01:33:05,924 --> 01:33:10,094
Everybody off?
Okay, I'll tell my crew.

1121
01:33:30,422 --> 01:33:34,654
- Why are they stoppin' the train?
-I don't know, sir. Tryin' to get some security check here.

1122
01:33:34,654 --> 01:33:36,921
That's the damnedest thing
I ever heard!

1123
01:33:36,921 --> 01:33:39,862
- They want us to get off the train?
- Yeah.

1124
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:43,699
- Hey, there's the police!
- Watch your step. Watch your step.

1125
01:33:43,699 --> 01:33:46,066
- Well, I'll be...
- Come on, get back!

1126
01:33:46,066 --> 01:33:49,072
You guys are just totally uncontrollable.
You know that?

1127
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:01,008
- The police are here.
- What?

1128
01:34:01,008 --> 01:34:03,679
The porters are askin' everyone
to get off the train.

1129
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:07,484
Are they?

1130
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,423
Keep moving towards the clearing, please.

1131
01:34:15,532 --> 01:34:19,628
This is a routine investigation.
None of you is in danger.

1132
01:34:21,205 --> 01:34:24,902
Please cooperate with us so we can
complete our investigation quickly...

1133
01:34:24,902 --> 01:34:28,103
and get you back aboard
and on your way.

1134
01:34:31,801 --> 01:34:33,102
Please keep moving...

1135
01:34:40,723 --> 01:34:42,247
Excuse me.

1136
01:34:44,961 --> 01:34:46,826
Yeah, excuse me.

1137
01:34:51,034 --> 01:34:54,470
- Everybody off, please, Mr. Devereau.
- Yes. What's happening here, Conductor?

1138
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:57,563
We're not sure. We got a call from
the police wanting everyone evacuated.

1139
01:34:57,563 --> 01:35:00,302
- Maybe it's a bomb scare.
- A bomb scare?

1140
01:35:00,302 --> 01:35:03,105
- Then we'd better get off.
- I certainly am.

1141
01:35:41,015 --> 01:35:42,915
Stay with her.

1142
01:35:42,915 --> 01:35:46,578
Cover us from the window. We're gonna
start the engine and take this thing to Rockdale.

1143
01:35:46,578 --> 01:35:51,148
Hey, what are you doin'? Everybody's gone.
What are you doin' with those rifles?

1144
01:35:55,463 --> 01:35:57,522
You bastards!

1145
01:36:00,367 --> 01:36:03,131
Everyone's off, Chief,
except our boy.

1146
01:36:04,872 --> 01:36:06,499
Hold it right there, Devereau!

1147
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,653
- Shit!
- Take it easy, killer.

1148
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:01,886
What are you doing here?

1149
01:37:03,162 --> 01:37:05,323
What's going on?
Who's in charge here?

1150
01:37:05,323 --> 01:37:06,989
Would you get down!

1151
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,791
What did you come back here for?

1152
01:37:13,338 --> 01:37:16,865
- Uh... I forgot your wallet.
- Oh, some thief you are.

1153
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:20,538
- Is that your old lady Hilly?
- Yeah.

1154
01:37:23,614 --> 01:37:25,104
Okay, follow me.

1155
01:37:36,694 --> 01:37:38,719
- Start the engine.
- We can't do that.

1156
01:37:39,697 --> 01:37:42,257
You, move, start it.

1157
01:38:14,164 --> 01:38:17,065
Mr. Devereau.
Mr. Devereau!

1158
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:28,673
Guido, come with me!

1159
01:38:54,103 --> 01:38:56,765
Keep your foot on the pedal.

1160
01:39:16,691 --> 01:39:18,886
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

1161
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:21,019
We're getting off at the next stop.

1162
01:39:23,831 --> 01:39:26,391
- What are you doing?
- This is combat.

1163
01:39:55,395 --> 01:39:56,919
Watch out for the engineer.

1164
01:40:00,934 --> 01:40:02,424
Sit!

1165
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,633
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1166
01:40:35,633 --> 01:40:37,692
How about Grover?

1167
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,531
Are you all right?

1168
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:45,702
- Is it over?
- Shit.!

1169
01:41:13,738 --> 01:41:15,228
Look out!

1170
01:41:18,843 --> 01:41:22,279
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1171
01:41:26,049 --> 01:41:27,983
Just give me one more pass.

1172
01:41:51,008 --> 01:41:54,171
Just give me one clear shot.

1173
01:42:28,845 --> 01:42:30,676
- What happened?
- Don't look. Don't look!

1174
01:42:36,318 --> 01:42:39,344
All right, get theJunction
on the radio.

1175
01:42:39,344 --> 01:42:41,719
Tell them they've got
a runaway train.

1176
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:44,686
Hey, we're comin'
into the station.

1177
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:03,575
George, why didn't we stop?
What's going on here?

1178
01:43:03,575 --> 01:43:06,045
I'm not sure, but I don't think
that there's anyone in the engine.

1179
01:43:06,045 --> 01:43:08,412
- No driver?
- That's right.

1180
01:43:08,412 --> 01:43:10,541
Oh, God!

1181
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:13,109
Whiney cut
all the emergency cords.

1182
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:15,121
What are we gonna do?

1183
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:20,419
- Well, we have to find some way to get to the engine.
- How?

1184
01:43:22,463 --> 01:43:23,953
The roof?

1185
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:28,232
I think so.
Come on!

1186
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:40,909
- How's it going?
- They don't believe us.

1187
01:43:40,909 --> 01:43:45,144
Look, the engineer is probably anxious
to bring the train in on schedule.

1188
01:43:47,453 --> 01:43:49,614
This is Chief Donaldson.
Who's this?

1189
01:43:49,614 --> 01:43:52,487
This is Jerry Jarvis.
I'm the assistant controller.

1190
01:43:52,487 --> 01:43:54,550
Assistant? Get me your boss.

1191
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:58,757
Uh, he's out to lunch, but I'm sure
I can handle any problem you might have.

1192
01:43:58,757 --> 01:44:02,426
It's not my problem. You've got a dead
engineer and a runaway train...

1193
01:44:02,426 --> 01:44:05,596
- that's gonna hit Chicago in 15 minutes.
- What are you gonna do about it?

1194
01:44:05,596 --> 01:44:08,800
All right, I'll check
with the signal towers.

1195
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,309
But, uh, you see,
it's impossible.

1196
01:44:11,309 --> 01:44:14,278
If the engineer is dead,
who's driving the train?

1197
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:26,581
- What's happening?
- Hey, you all right?

1198
01:44:26,581 --> 01:44:29,718
- Listen, is there any way...
- Holy moley! The killer!

1199
01:44:29,718 --> 01:44:31,592
- No, he's okay.
- Listen to me.

1200
01:44:31,592 --> 01:44:34,530
Is there any way to get to the engine
without going over the roof?

1201
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:36,864
There ain't no way to get to the engine,
period!

1202
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:40,393
- Why are we goin' so fast?
- Because there's no one driving this train.

1203
01:44:40,393 --> 01:44:43,930
- Impossible. It would stop.
- Does this look as if we're stopping?

1204
01:44:44,743 --> 01:44:47,940
No, the hell it don't.!
I better go pull the emergency cord.

1205
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:50,379
The emergency cords
have been cut.

1206
01:44:50,379 --> 01:44:52,178
Damn hippies!

1207
01:44:54,619 --> 01:44:58,988
I received a report from the signal towers.
They see no engineer in the cabin.

1208
01:44:58,988 --> 01:45:00,921
Great. Now you've got the facts.

1209
01:45:00,921 --> 01:45:03,984
Throw one of those switches
and have the train run off.

1210
01:45:03,984 --> 01:45:08,327
That's the problem.
All the tracks are computer programmed.

1211
01:45:08,327 --> 01:45:11,129
Switching the Silver Streak would only
cause a collision with another train.

1212
01:45:11,129 --> 01:45:14,865
Then what the hell are you gonna do?
There are people riding on that train.

1213
01:45:14,865 --> 01:45:16,770
Oh, no.

1214
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:18,399
You see, the standard procedure...

1215
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:21,502
in such an emergency
would be to derail the train.

1216
01:45:21,502 --> 01:45:23,342
Derail it?
In the middle of the yard?

1217
01:45:24,348 --> 01:45:28,681
Yes. Actually,
I can't take that responsibility.
Uh, I'd better get my boss.

1218
01:45:28,681 --> 01:45:31,721
You better do something,
you idiot, because in 10 minutes...

1219
01:45:31,721 --> 01:45:33,779
you're gonna have
200 tons of locomotive

1220
01:45:33,779 --> 01:45:37,384
smashing through Central Station
on its way to Marshall Fields!

1221
01:45:41,464 --> 01:45:44,900
- Where are we going?
- If you wanna stop this train, you got to follow me!

1222
01:45:49,372 --> 01:45:51,704
Hey, Jack,
have you seen Benny?

1223
01:45:51,704 --> 01:45:54,335
Uh, yeah, yeah. I saw him
in the coffee shop, Jerry.

1224
01:46:03,485 --> 01:46:06,283
Now what we have to do
is uncouple the cars.

1225
01:46:06,283 --> 01:46:09,347
You gotta pull up that bar,
turn it to the left.

1226
01:46:09,347 --> 01:46:13,020
When they pull apart, they will
bust open the air pressure lines...

1227
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,292
and the brakes will clamp on throughout
the train, then you can jump on back.

1228
01:46:16,965 --> 01:46:19,263
- But that's dangerous.!
- Impossible, man.

1229
01:46:20,169 --> 01:46:21,761
Grab hold of my belt.

1230
01:46:21,761 --> 01:46:23,705
- What are you gonna do?
- Guess!

1231
01:46:30,278 --> 01:46:33,941
- Have you seen Benny?
- Well, if it isn't the little Caesar of the railroad.

1232
01:46:33,941 --> 01:46:36,983
- Have you seen Benny!
- No. No!

1233
01:46:36,983 --> 01:46:38,415
Try next door.

1234
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:21,651
What's the matter?

1235
01:47:21,651 --> 01:47:24,389
The Silver Streak is a runaway.
What do we do?

1236
01:47:25,731 --> 01:47:27,858
Jesus! It's gonna be here
in four minutes!

1237
01:47:44,216 --> 01:47:46,149
Your attention, please.

1238
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:49,152
May I have
your attention, please.

1239
01:47:49,152 --> 01:47:53,179
You are requested to walk to
the nearest exit as quickly as possible.

1240
01:47:53,179 --> 01:47:54,748
Please do not run.

1241
01:47:54,748 --> 01:47:57,954
Walk as quickly
as possible to the nearest exit.

1242
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:03,826
People waiting for the arrival
of the Silver Streak on track five...

1243
01:48:03,826 --> 01:48:06,063
are requested to vacate
that area immediately.

1244
01:48:28,258 --> 01:48:33,662
This is an emergency. Please continue
to the nearest exit where a station security...

1245
01:48:54,918 --> 01:48:59,445
Exit as quickly as possible.
You must leave the building..

1246
01:50:22,069 --> 01:50:25,402
We did it! We made it!
We made it, man! Whoo!

1247
01:50:25,402 --> 01:50:26,871


1248
01:50:27,808 --> 01:50:29,298
Holy shit!

1249
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,649
Hello, Chicago! Hello!

1250
01:50:35,649 --> 01:50:37,581
Gotta drink to that!

1251
01:50:53,566 --> 01:50:56,933
I don't know about you,
but next time I'm gonna take the bus.

1252
01:50:56,933 --> 01:51:00,200
Maybe I'm crazy,
but it looks as if it's grinning.

1253
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:03,174
Yeah, like the cat
who swallowed the canary.

1254
01:51:03,174 --> 01:51:05,574
- Where's Grover?
- I don't know.

1255
01:51:13,786 --> 01:51:16,982
Take it easy, killer.
Stay loose!

1256
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:20,687
What's he doing?

1257
01:51:20,687 --> 01:51:22,420
He's crazy.

1258
01:51:23,462 --> 01:51:25,953
Crazy? He's got the right idea.

1259
01:51:25,953 --> 01:51:28,932
- Let's get outta here and go to a park.
- A park?

1260
01:51:28,932 --> 01:51:31,435
Yeah. I want
to lie back on the grass...

1261
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:34,165
and have you teach me
some more about gardening.
