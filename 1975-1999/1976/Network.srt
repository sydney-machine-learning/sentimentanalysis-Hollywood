1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:20,562
This story is about Howard Beale,
the "Network News" anchorman on UBS TV.

3
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,523
In his time, Howard Beale had been
a mandarin of television...

4
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,525
the grand old man of news...

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,154
with a HUT rating of 16
and a 28 audience share.

6
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,949
In 1969, however, his fortunes
began to decline.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,993
He fell to a 22 share.

8
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,329
The following year, his wife died,
and he was left a childless widower...

9
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,999
with an 8 rating
and a 12 share.

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,794
He became morose and isolated,
began to drink heavily.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,381
On September 22, 1975,
he was fired...

12
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,383
effective in two weeks.

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,969
The news was broken to him
by Max Schumacher...

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,014
who was the president
of the News Division at UBS.

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,850
The two old friends
got properly pissed.

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,855
I was at CBS
with Ed Murrow in 1951.

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,982
Must've been 1950.

18
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,903
I was at NBC.
Associate producer.

19
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:14,324
Morning news.
I was just a kid... 26 years old.

20
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:22,248
Anyway, they were building the lower
level of the George Washington Bridge.

21
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,168
We were doing a remote from there.

22
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,424
And nobody told me.

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,679
7:00 a. m., I get a call.

24
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,349
"Where are you? You're supposed to be
on the George Washington Bridge?"

25
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,854
I jump out of bed,
throw my raincoat over my pajamas.

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,524
I run downstairs
and out into the street...

27
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,318
hail a cab and say to the cabbie...

28
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,446
"Take me to the middle
of the George Washington Bridge. "

29
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,660
The cabbie turns around and says...

30
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,372
He says, "Don't do it, buddy.

31
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:08,128
You're a young man. You've got
your whole life ahead of you. "

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,593
Didn't I tell you that before?

33
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,768
I'm gonna kill myself.

34
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,021
Shit, Howard.

35
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm gonna blow my brains out
right on the air...

36
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,945
right in the middle
of the seven o'clock news.

37
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,700
You'll get a hell of a rating,
I'll guarantee that.

38
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,452
Fifty share easy.

39
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,496
- You think so?
- Sure.

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,208
We could make a series out of it.
"Suicide of the Week. "

41
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,673
Why limit ourselves?
"Execution of the Week. "

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,676
"Terrorist of the Week. "

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,720
They'll love it.

44
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,099
Suicides. Assassinations.

45
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,603
Mad bombers.

46
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,105
Mafia hit men.

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,107
Automobile smashups.

48
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,276
"The Death Hour. "

49
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,324
"A great Sunday night show
for the whole family. "

50
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,120
Lt'd put fucking Disney
right off the air.

51
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,825
Let's do the Lenin deportation
at the end of three.

52
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,868
- Strong enough to bump?
- At one, then.

53
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,372
I'll do a lead on Sarah Jane Moore
to May Berry in San Francisco.

54
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,332
The film I saw
was of the chief of detectives.

55
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:14,379
I think we've got ten seconds
on the shooting itself.

56
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,132
The whole thing is 1:25.

57
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,468
- What does that come out?
- About 4:50.

58
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,764
- Can we use Squeaky Fromme?
- Let's do that at two.

59
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,269
Squeaky boarded the airport bus.

60
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,563
You using a map on him
for San Francisco?

61
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,816
I'd prefer newspapers.

62
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,360
What've we got left?

63
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,530
Gun control.
Patty Hearst affidavit.

64
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,575
Guerillas in Chad.
OPEC in Guiana.

65
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,686
Hello, Howard.
How are you?

66
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,741
Don't forget, Howard,
we're not using the 16.

67
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,208
The first attempt on President Ford's
life was 18 days ago...

68
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,960
and again yesterday in San Francisco.

69
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,296
In spite of the two attempts,
Mr. Ford says...

70
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,049
he will not become a prisoner
of the Oval Office...

71
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,302
a hostage
of would-be assassins.

72
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,306
The American people
are good people.

73
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,018
Democrats, Independents,
Republicans and others.

74
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,271
- How do you get mixed up that type?
- I don't know.

75
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:01,152
If you're so hot, why go to strangers?
What's wrong with me?

76
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,991
Ready two.

77
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,578
Two. Cue Howard.

78
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,039
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like at this moment...

79
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,335
to announce that I will be retiring
from this program in two weeks' time...

80
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,212
because of poor ratings.

81
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:24,175
Since this show is the only thing
I had going for me in my life...

82
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,928
I have decided to kill myself.

83
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:32,517
I'm going to blow my brains out
on this program a week from today.

84
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,352
Ten seconds to commercial.

85
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,062
Tune in next Tuesday.

86
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,899
That should give the public relations
people a week to promote the show.

87
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,901
We oughta get a hell of a rating
out of that.

88
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,946
Fifty share easy.

89
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,286
- Listen. Did you hear that?
- What was that about?

90
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,664
Howard said he was going
to blow his brains out next Tuesday.

91
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,543
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear him?

92
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,297
Howard said he was going
to kill himself next Tuesday.

93
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,260
What do you mean Howard said he
was going to kill himself next Tuesday?

94
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,346
He was supposed to do a tag.

95
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,183
He said, "Tune in next Tuesday.
I'm going to shoot myself. "

96
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,684
What's going on?

97
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,479
He just said he was going
to blow his brains out.

98
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,522
What the fuck's going on?

99
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,567
- They wanna know what's going on.
- I can't hear you.

100
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,612
- Turn the studio mike on.
- We're on in 11 seconds.

101
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,823
- Ten seconds.
- What are you doing? Have you flipped?

102
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,576
- We better get him off.
- Get him off.

103
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,412
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Turn the sound off!

104
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,498
He's going on live!

105
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,833
- Key two.
- We're in trouble down here.

106
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,089
Go to standby!

107
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,220
Lou, can't we clear out the lobby?
There must be 100 people there.

108
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,764
- How am I gonna clear 'em out?
- Every TV station and wire service!

109
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,183
I could barely get in.

110
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,062
- Arthur, anything?
- Not so far.

111
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,190
Frank Hackett just walked in.
We had to abort the show.

112
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,484
So far over 900
fucking phone calls...

113
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,237
complaining about the foul language.

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,281
- What page are you putting it on?
- Hackett just walked in.

115
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,118
- ABC again.
- Tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

116
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,869
That goes for you, too, Marty.

117
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,621
You're off the air.

118
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,000
- He wants to talk to you.
- Who's replacing Beale?

119
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,961
- We're flying Snowden up.
- Everybody hold it.

120
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,338
Let's see how the other networks
handle this.

121
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,342
- The ten o'clock news opened with it.
- Good evening. Howard Beale...

122
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,428
They'll all make it
their lead story.

123
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,806
Howard Beale interrupted
his "Network News" program tonight...

124
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,100
to announce he was going
to kill himself.

125
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,477
An unusual thing happened
at a sister network...

126
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,771
UBS, this evening.

127
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,358
- How are we handling it?
- Halloway will make a statement...

128
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,821
at the end of the show that Howard's
been under great personal stress.

129
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,867
We've got a stockholders' meeting
tomorrow...

130
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,245
at which we will announce
the restructuring of management plan.

131
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,498
I don't want this grotesque incident
to interfere with that.

132
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:04,544
I'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short
statement washing this whole thing off.

133
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:09,341
You, Max, better have answers for those
nuts that always come to the meetings.

134
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,843
Mr. Beale has been under great
professional and personal strain.

135
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,887
I've got surprises for you, too!

136
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,306
I've had it up to here
with your division...

137
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,059
and it's annual
$33 million deficit!

138
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,770
Keep your hands off
my News Division, Frank.

139
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,564
We're responsible to corporate level,
not you.

140
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,900
We'll goddamn well see about that.

141
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,445
All right, take it easy.
How do we get Beale out of here?

142
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,616
I understand there are reporters
and camera crews in the lobby.

143
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,618
We've got a limo at the freight exit.

144
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,997
Howard, you'll spend the night at my
place. There'll be press around yours.

145
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,884
I want Snowden here by noon...

146
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,053
have Lester
cover the CIA hearings...

147
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,389
and give the White House
to Doris.

148
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,766
You're late for your screening, Max.

149
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,143
Right. Okay.

150
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,441
If John Wheeler calls,
switch him to projection room 7.

151
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,197
- I'm sorry, Bill. This Beale business.
- It's all right. Sit down.

152
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,533
Diana asked if she could sit in on this.

153
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,160
Fine. How's it going?

154
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,914
You'll like this footage better than
the stuff I showed you last time.

155
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,668
Max Schumacher.

156
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,338
Goddamn it! When?

157
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,926
Did he say anything?

158
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,596
All right, thank you.

159
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,602
The Communist Party believes the most
pressing political necessity today...

160
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,939
is the consolidation
of the revolutionary...

161
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,108
radical and democratic movements...

162
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,821
Harry, Howard Beale left my house
20 minutes ago.

163
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,865
Has he come in yet?

164
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,867
Let me know when he arrives.

165
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,329
- That's Laureen Hobbs, isn't it?
- Yeah.

166
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,707
This is from a David Susskind thing
a while back.

167
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,418
I think we can use some of this stuff.

168
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,090
What we're going to see now
is something really sensational.

169
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,635
The Flagstaff Independent Bank
of Arizona was ripped off last week...

170
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,930
by a terrorist group called
the Ecumenical Liberation Army.

171
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,310
They themselves took movies of the
rip-off while they were ripping it off.

172
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,230
The Ecumenical Liberation Army is not
the one that kidnapped Patty Hearst?

173
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,775
No, that's the Symbionese
Liberation Army.

174
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,152
This is the Ecumenical
Liberation Army.

175
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,447
They're the ones who kidnapped
Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.

176
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,700
There's a lot of liberation armies
in the revolutionary underground...

177
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,702
and a lot of kidnapped heiresses.

178
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,704
This is Mary Ann Gifford.

179
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,752
That's the Great Ahmed Khan.
He's their leader.

180
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:56,257
They actually shot this film
while they were ripping off the bank?

181
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,385
Wait till you see it.

182
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,346
I don't know whether to edit
or leave it raw like this.

183
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,393
This is terrific stuff!
Where did you get it?

184
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,311
I got everything
through Laureen Hobbs.

185
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,189
She's my contact
for all this stuff.

186
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:21,032
- I've got Howard on the other line.
- Put him on.

187
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,827
I've got Max on four. Pick up.

188
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,497
I'd like another shot.

189
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,292
- Come on, Howard.
- I don't mean the whole show.

190
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,171
I'd like to come on,
make some brief farewell statement...

191
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,299
and then turn the show over
to Jack Snowden.

192
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,345
I have 11 years at this network.
I have some standing in the industry.

193
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,015
I just don't want to go out
like a clown.

194
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,227
It'll be simple, dignified.
You and Harry can check the copy.

195
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,688
I think it'll take the strain
off the show.

196
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,527
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

197
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,905
And no booze today, Howard!

198
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,407
No booze.

199
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,833
George, can you come into my office
for a minute?

200
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,052
Barbara, is Tommy around?
I'd like to see the two of you.

201
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,772
This is Bill Herron from our West Coast
Special Programs Department.

202
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,900
George Bosch. Barbara Schlesinger.
Tommy Pellegrino.

203
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,945
I just saw footage of a special Bill's
doing on the revolutionary underground.

204
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,656
Most of it's tedious stuff of
Laureen Hobbs and two fatigue jackets...

205
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,117
muttering mutilated Marxism...

206
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,330
but he's got eight minutes
of a bank robbery...

207
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,415
that is sensational!

208
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,628
Authentic stuff shot
while the robbery was going on.

209
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,005
Remember the Mary Ann Gifford
kidnapping?

210
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,926
It's that bunch of nuts. She's in
the movie shooting off machine guns.

211
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,303
This is really terrific footage.

212
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,890
We can get a movie of the week
out of it, maybe even a series.

213
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,394
A series?
What are we talking about?

214
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,981
We've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals,
the Ecumenical Liberation Army...

215
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,235
who go around taking home movies
of themselves robbing banks.

216
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,780
Maybe they'll take movies of themselves
kidnapping heiresses...

217
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,824
hijacking 747 s...

218
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,034
bombing bridges,
assassinating ambassadors.

219
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,164
We'd open each week's segment
with their authentic footage...

220
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,835
hire writers to write a story behind
that footage, and we've got a series.

221
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,798
A series about a bunch
of bank-robbing guerrillas?

222
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,927
What will we call it,
the "Mao Tse-Tung Hour"?

223
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,554
Why not?

224
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,889
They've got "Strike Force,"
"Task Force," "SWAT."

225
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,101
Why not Che Guevara
and his own little "Mod Squad"?

226
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:57,731
I sent you all a concept analysis report
yesterday. Did any of you read it?

227
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,860
Well, in a nutshell it said...

228
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,987
"The American people
are turning sullen. "

229
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,824
They've been clobbered on all sides
by Vietnam, Watergate, inflation.

230
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,119
They've turned off, shot up, fucked
themselves limp, and nothing helps.

231
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,748
So this concept analysis report
concludes...

232
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:19,544
the American people want somebody
to articulate their rage for them.

233
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:25,050
I've told you since I took this job
six months ago that I want angry shows.

234
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,260
I don't want conventional programming.

235
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,013
I want counterculture.
I want antiestablishment.

236
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:37,062
I don't want to play butch boss
with you people...

237
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,189
but when I took over
this department...

238
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,858
it had the worst programming record
in television history.

239
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,736
This network hasn't one show
in the top 20.

240
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,863
This network is an industry joke.

241
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,241
We better start putting together
one winner for next September.

242
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,243
I want a show developed...

243
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,914
based on the activities
of a terrorist group.

244
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,375
"Joseph Stalin and His Merry Band
of Bolsheviks. "

245
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,795
I want ideas from you.
That is what you're paid for.

246
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,632
By the way, the next time I send
an audience research report around...

247
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,134
you'd better read it,
or I'll sack the lot of you.

248
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,844
Is that clear?

249
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:15,600
I'll be on the coast in four weeks. Can
you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs?

250
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,270
The business of management
is management.

251
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,691
At the time CCA took control,
the UBS TV network was foundering...

252
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,277
with less than seven percent
of national television revenues...

253
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,239
most network programs being sold
at station rates.

254
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,909
I am pleased to announce I am submitting
to the board of directors a plan...

255
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,704
for the coordination
of the main profit centers...

256
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,748
and with the specific intention
of making each division...

257
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,626
more responsive to management.

258
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,128
Point one.

259
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,008
"The division producing the lowest rate
of return has been the News Division...

260
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:53,638
with its $98 million budget and its
average annual deficit of $32 million. "

261
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,143
I know, historically, news divisions
are expected to lose money.

262
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,062
To our minds, this philosophy
is a wanton fiscal affront...

263
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,816
to be resolutely resisted.

264
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:10,363
The new plan calls for local news to be
transferred to Owned Stations Divisions.

265
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,950
News Radio would be transferred to
the UBS Radio Division...

266
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:18,121
and the News Division would be reduced
from an independent division...

267
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,709
to a department accountable
to network.

268
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,092
- What was that all about, Ed?
- This is not the time.

269
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,094
Why wasn't I told about this?

270
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,474
Why was I led up onto that podium and
humiliated in front of the stockholders?

271
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,976
Goddamn it! I spoke to John Wheeler
this morning...

272
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,687
and he assured me
that the News Division was safe.

273
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,981
If you want me to resign,
that's a bad way to do it.

274
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,942
We'll talk about this tomorrow
at our regular morning meeting.

275
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,040
Roll VTA.

276
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,334
Bring it up on one.
Ready now.

277
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,172
In five, four, three, two...

278
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,424
- One.
- One TVA.

279
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,302
And...

280
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,555
cue announcer.

281
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,599
The "UBS Evening News"...

282
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,852
with Howard Beale.

283
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,813
Ready two.

284
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,398
Two. Cue power.

285
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,527
Good evening.
Today is Wednesday, September 24...

286
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,529
and this is my last broadcast.

287
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,907
Yesterday I announced
on this program...

288
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,952
that I was going to commit
public suicide...

289
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,538
admittedly an act of madness.

290
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,749
I'll tell you what happened.
I just ran out of bullshit.

291
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,085
- Cut him off.
- Leave him on.

292
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,963
Am I still on?

293
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,133
If this is how he wants to go out,
this is how he goes out.

294
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,468
I just ran out of bullshit.

295
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,013
Mr. Schumacher's here.
Do you want to talk to him?

296
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,015
Bullshit is all the reasons
we give for living.

297
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:04,394
If we can't think up reasons of our own,
we always have the God bullshit.

298
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,312
- We don't know why we go through...
- What is it?

299
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,857
Pointless pain,
humiliation and decay.

300
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,861
There better be someone, somewhere
who does know. That's the God bullshit.

301
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:16,364
He's saying that life is bullshit.
It is. What are you screaming about?

302
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,868
Man is a noble creature who can order
his own world. Who needs God?

303
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,956
If there's anybody who can look around
this demented world we live in...

304
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,043
and tell me man
is a noble creature...

305
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,420
believe me,
that man is full of bullshit.

306
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,133
- What's so goddamn funny?
- I can't help it. It's funny.

307
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,846
This is going out live
to 67 affiliates.

308
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,348
Leave him on.

309
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,935
And I was married for 33 years
of shrill, shrieking fraud.

310
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,606
- Mr. Hackett's trying to reach you.
- Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.

311
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,650
So I don't have any bullshit left.

312
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,780
I just ran out of it, you see.

313
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,996
Mr. Ruddy, could we have
one statement, please?

314
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,165
Sorry, I don't have
all the information yet.

315
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,547
If we could just have one statement
about Mr. Beale.

316
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,017
Max?

317
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,736
I'll want to see Mr. Beale
after this.

318
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,866
The way I hear it,
you were primarily responsible...

319
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,285
for this colossally
stupid prank.

320
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,330
- Is that the fact?
- That's the fact.

321
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,958
It was unconscionable.

322
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,756
- There is nothing more to say.
- I have something to say.

323
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,760
I want to know why that debasement
of the News Division...

324
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,472
announced at the meeting this afternoon
was kept secret from me?

325
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,059
You and I go back 20 years.

326
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,645
I took this job
with your personal assurance...

327
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,482
that you'd back my autonomy
against any encroachment.

328
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:19,279
But ever since CCA acquired control
of UBS Systems ten months ago...

329
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,698
Hackett's been taking over everything.

330
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,952
Who is running this network?
You or some conglomerate called CCA?

331
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,830
You're president
of the Systems Group.

332
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,459
Hackett's nothing
but a hatchet man for CCA.

333
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,211
Nelson here,
president of the network...

334
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,048
and he hasn't a damned thing to say
about anything anymore.

335
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,717
I told you
at the stockholders' meeting...

336
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,596
that we would discuss all that
at our regular meeting tomorrow morning.

337
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,015
If you had been patient,
I would have explained...

338
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,642
that I, too, thought
Frank Hackett precipitate...

339
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,604
and that the reorganization of the
News Division would not be executed...

340
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,231
until everyone,
specifically you, Max...

341
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,234
had been consulted and satisfied.

342
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,112
Instead, you sulked off
like a child...

343
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,240
and engaged this network
in a shocking and disgraceful episode.

344
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,284
Your position
is no longer tenable...

345
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,703
regardless of how management
is restructured.

346
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,999
I will expect your resignation
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

347
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,795
We will coordinate our statements
to the least detriment of everyone.

348
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,425
Bob McDonough will take over the News
Division until we sort all this out.

349
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,305
I'd like to see Mr. Beale now.

350
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,141
They're looking for him.
They don't know where he is.

351
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:35,146
Well, every day, five days a week
for 15 years...

352
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,775
I've been sitting behind that desk,
the dispassionate pundit...

353
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,861
reporting with seemly detachment...

354
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,532
the daily parade of lunacies
that constitute the news.

355
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,033
Just once...

356
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,119
I wanted to say
what I really felt.

357
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,829
Knock it off.

358
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,747
It was, after all, my last one.

359
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,475
- Have the overnight ratings come in?
- They're on your desk.

360
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,477
Have you got
yesterday's overnights?

361
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,771
- Shall I bring them in?
- Yeah.

362
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,572
These are the outlines submitted
by Universal for an hour series.

363
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,700
You needn't bother to read them.
I'll tell them to you.

364
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:33,371
The first one is set in an eastern
law school, presumably Harvard.

365
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,583
The series is irresistibly entitled
"The New Lawyers. "

366
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,045
The running characters are: A crusty
but benign ex-Supreme Court justice...

367
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,548
presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes
by way of Dr. Zorba...

368
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,052
a beautiful girl graduate student,
and the local district attorney...

369
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,054
who is brilliant
and sometimes cuts corners.

370
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,014
Next one.

371
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,058
The second one's called
"The Amazon Squad. "

372
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,684
Lady cops.

373
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,604
Running characters include a crusty
but benign police lieutenant...

374
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,981
who's always getting heat
from the commissioner...

375
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:03,777
a tough, hard-drinking detective who
thinks women belong in the kitchen...

376
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,572
and a brilliant, beautiful young cop
who's fighting the feminist battle.

377
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,699
We're up to our ears in lady cops.

378
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,869
Next is another one of those
investigative reporter shows.

379
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,580
A crusty but benign managing editor
who's always getting...

380
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,749
You know, Barbara...

381
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:22,087
the Arabs have decided to jack up
the price of oil another 20 percent.

382
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:26,883
The CIA has been caught opening
Senator Humphrey's mail.

383
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,887
There's a civil war in Angola.
Another one in Beirut.

384
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,724
New York City's still facing default.

385
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,644
They finally caught up
with Patricia Hearst.

386
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:41,439
And the whole front page
of the Daily News is Howard Beale.

387
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:46,528
There's also a two-column story
on page one of the Times.

388
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,658
Helen?
Call Mr. Hackett's office.

389
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,160
See if he can give me
a few minutes this morning.

390
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:05,130
KTNS Kansas City refuses to carry
our "Network News Show" anymore...

391
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,173
unless Beale is taken off the air.

392
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,342
Did you see the overnights
on the "Network News"?

393
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:12,137
It has an 8 in New York,
a 9 in L. A...

394
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,639
and a 27 share in both cities.

395
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,934
Last night, Howard Beale went on the air
and yelled "bullshit" for two minutes.

396
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:22,230
I can tell you tonight's show
will get a 30 share at least.

397
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:25,525
- I think we've lucked into something.
- For God sakes, Diana!

398
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,820
Are you suggesting we put that lunatic
back on the air yelling "bullshit"?

399
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,365
Yes, I think we should put Beale back
on the air tonight and keep him on.

400
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:35,243
Did you see the news this morning?
Did you see the Times?

401
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,954
We got press coverage on this
you couldn't buy for a million dollars.

402
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:43,960
That show jumped 5 points in one night.
Tonight's show will be at least 15.

403
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:48,590
We've just increased our audience by
20 or 30 million people in one night!

404
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,426
You won't get something like this dumped
into your lap the rest of your days.

405
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,638
You can't piss it away. Howard said
last night what every American feels.

406
00:25:55,722 --> 00:26:00,769
He's tired of all the bullshit!
He's articulating the popular rage!

407
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,854
I want that show, Frank.

408
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,148
I can turn that show
into the biggest smash on TV.

409
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,193
It's a news show.
It's not your department.

410
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,029
I see Howard Beale
as a latter-day prophet...

411
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:15,200
a messianic figure inveighing
against the hypocrisies of our times!

412
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,827
A strip Savonarola
Monday through Friday...

413
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,246
that will just go through the roof!

414
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,292
And I'm talking about
a six-dollar cost per thousand show.

415
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:27,420
I'm talking about
130,000 dollar minutes.

416
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:31,257
Figure out the revenues of a strip show
that sells for $100,000 a minute!

417
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:35,095
One show like that could pull
this network out of the hole!

418
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:38,390
It's being handed to us on a plate.
Let's not blow it.

419
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,685
Yes.

420
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,937
Tell him I'll be a few minutes.

421
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,734
- Let me think it over.
- Let's not go to committee on this.

422
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,613
It's 10:20. We want Beale in the studio
by 6:30. We don't want to lose momentum.

423
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:57,784
For God sakes, we're talking about
putting an irresponsible man...

424
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,370
on national television.

425
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,882
I'd like to talk to Legal Affairs,
Herb Thackery...

426
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,552
and Joe Donnelly
in Standards and Practices.

427
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,432
You know I'll be eyeball to eyeball
with Mr. Ruddy on this.

428
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,685
If I'm going to the mat with Ruddy,
I want to be sure of my ground.

429
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,979
My ass is going on the line.

430
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,317
I'll get back to you.

431
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,073
I don't believe the top brass...

432
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:41,202
of a national television network
is sitting around their Caesar salads...

433
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,621
Top brass of a bankrupt
national television network...

434
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,332
with projected losses
of $150 million.

435
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,834
I don't care!

436
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:53,214
You can't be seriously proposing,
and the rest of us considering...

437
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,800
putting on a pornographic
network news show.

438
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,136
- The FCC would kill us.
- Sit down, Nelson.

439
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,139
The FCC can't do anything
except rap our knuckles.

440
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:04,392
I don't even want to think about
the litigious possibilities.

441
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,771
- We could be up to our ears in lawsuits.
- The affiliates won't carry it.

442
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:10,857
The affiliates will kiss your ass
if you can hand them a hit show.

443
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,193
- But popular reaction...
- We don't know the popular reaction.

444
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:16,488
- That's what we have to find out.
- The New York Times...

445
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,991
The New York Times doesn't advertise
on our network.

446
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,247
All I know is, this violates
every canon of respectable broadcasting.

447
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,542
We're not a respectable network.
We're a whorehouse network.

448
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,795
We have to take whatever we can get.

449
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,173
I don't want any part of it.

450
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,717
I don't fancy myself
the president of a whorehouse.

451
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,595
That's commendable of you, Nelson.
Now sit down.

452
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,682
Your indignation
has been duly recorded.

453
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,684
You can always resign tomorrow.

454
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,856
What in substance are we proposing?

455
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:55,860
Merely to add editorial comment
to our network news show.

456
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,698
Brinkley, Sevareid, Reasoner
all have their comments.

457
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,866
Now Howard Beale will have his.

458
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,995
I think we ought to give it a shot,
see what happens tonight. Telephone.

459
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,541
I don't want to be the messenger
who has to tell Schumacher about this.

460
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:13,378
He doesn't work at this network anymore.
Mr. Ruddy fired him last night.

461
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,423
Bob McDonough is running
the News Division now.

462
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,843
Bob McDonough in News, please.

463
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,471
I don't know.

464
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:26,016
I may teach or write a book...

465
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,186
whatever the hell one does when one
approaches the autumn of one's years.

466
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,899
My God! Is that me?

467
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,194
Was I ever that young?

468
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,697
No, Howard brought in a picture
of Ed Murrow...

469
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,241
and the CBS gang
when we were there.

470
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,868
You wouldn't believe it!

471
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,078
Walter Cronkite, Harry Reasoner...

472
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,164
Hollenbeck, Bob Trout.

473
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:51,166
Is that you?

474
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:56,087
Yeah. Okay, Dick,
we'll be in touch.

475
00:29:56,171 --> 00:30:00,592
Remember this kid you sent to interview
Cleveland Amory on vivisection?

476
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,556
What's so funny?

477
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,687
I jump out of bed in my pajamas,
I grab my raincoat, I run downstairs.

478
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,398
I run out to the street
and hail a cab.

479
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:20,487
I yell at the driver, "Take me to the
middle of the George Washington Bridge. "

480
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:26,284
And the driver says,
"Don't do it, buddy. Don't do it!

481
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,870
You're young. You've got
your whole life ahead of you. "

482
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,165
Wait a minute.

483
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:36,753
If you think that's funny,
wait till you hear this.

484
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,797
I've come from Hackett's office.

485
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,633
He wants to put Howard
back on the air tonight.

486
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,761
Apparently the ratings went up
five points last night...

487
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:48,139
and he wants Howard to go back on
and do his "angry man" thing.

488
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,308
What are you talking about?

489
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,436
They want Howard to go back on
and yell "bullshit. "

490
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,982
They want Howard to go on...

491
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,026
spontaneously letting out
his anger.

492
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,071
A latter-day prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.

493
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,365
That sounds pretty good!

494
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,701
Who's "they"?

495
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,453
Hackett. Chaney was there.

496
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,665
The Legal Affairs guy.
Oh, and that girl from programming.

497
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,167
Christensen?
What's she got to do with this?

498
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:19,004
- Are you kidding?
- I'm not kidding.

499
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,799
I said, "We're running
a news department here, not a circus.

500
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,427
And Howard Beale's
not a bearded lady.

501
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,138
If you think I'll go along with
this bastardization of the news...

502
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,641
you can have my resignation
along with Max Schumacher's.

503
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:37,522
- I'm speaking for Howard Beale and... "
- That's my job you're turning down.

504
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,442
I'd go nuts
without some kind of work.

505
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:44,529
What's wrong with being an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

506
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,322
What do you think, Max?

507
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:50,618
Do you want to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

508
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:55,165
Yeah, I'd like to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.

509
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,460
Then grab it!

510
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,885
- Afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.
- Afternoon.

511
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,887
Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.

512
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,351
- He's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

513
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,027
Nelson Chaney tells me Beale
may actually go on the air this evening.

514
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,156
As far as I know,
Howard's going to do it.

515
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:33,495
- Are you gonna sit still for this?
- Yes.

516
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,289
I think Hackett's overstepped himself.

517
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,917
There's some kind of
corporate maneuvering going on.

518
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,544
Hackett is clearly forcing
a confrontation.

519
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,797
That would account for his behavior
at the stockholders' meeting.

520
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,468
However, I think he's making a serious
mistake with this Beale business.

521
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,680
I suspect CCA will be upset...

522
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,723
at Hackett's presumptuousness.

523
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,934
Certainly Mr. Jensen will.

524
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:59,562
So I'm going to let Hackett
have his head for a while.

525
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,315
He just might lose it
over this Beale business.

526
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:09,322
I'd like you to reconsider
your resignation.

527
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,908
I assume Hackett
wouldn't take such steps...

528
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,285
without some support
on the CCA board.

529
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:17,205
I'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen.

530
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:20,500
When that happens, I'm going to need
every friend I've got...

531
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:24,295
and I don't want Hackett's people
in all the divisional positions.

532
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,548
So I'd like you to stay on.

533
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,512
Of course.

534
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,975
Thank you, Max.

535
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,477
This has been
the "UBS Evening News"...

536
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,980
with Howard Beale.

537
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:44,691
The initial response to the new
"Howard Beale Show"...

538
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:46,818
was not auspicatory.

539
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,945
The press was,
without exception, hostile...

540
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,197
and industry reaction negative.

541
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,616
The ratings for the Thursday
and Friday shows...

542
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,202
were both 14,
but Monday's rating dropped a point...

543
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,539
clearly suggesting the novelty
was wearing off.

544
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,543
Did you know there are
a number of psychics...

545
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,546
working as licensed brokers
on Wall Street?

546
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,049
Some counsel their clients
by use of tarot cards.

547
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:12,844
They're all pretty successful,
even in a bear market and selling short.

548
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:16,514
I met one of them last week
and thought of doing a show around her.

549
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,225
"The Wayward Witch of Wall Street. "
Something like that.

550
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,811
But if her tips were any good,
she could wreck the market.

551
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:27,442
I called her this morning and asked her
how she was on predicting the future.

552
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,195
She said she was
occasionally prescient.

553
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:34,908
"For example," she said,
"I just had a vision of you...

554
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,994
sitting in an office
with a craggy, middle-aged man...

555
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:41,498
with whom you are
or will be emotionally involved. "

556
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:43,166
And here I am.

557
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,171
She does all this with tarot cards?

558
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:51,132
This one operates
on parapsychology.

559
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:55,512
She has trance-like episodes
and feels things in her energy field.

560
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:00,183
- This lady could be very useful to you.
- In what way?

561
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,852
You put on a news show.

562
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:06,147
And here's somebody who can predict
tomorrow's news for you.

563
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,566
Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.

564
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:10,568
Sibyl the Soothsayer.

565
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,196
You could give her
two minutes of trance...

566
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,907
at the end of the "Howard Beale Show,"
say once a week, Friday...

567
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,410
which is suggestively occult,
and she could oraculate.

568
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,580
Then next week everyone tunes in to see
how good her predictions were.

569
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,709
Maybe she could do the weather.

570
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:31,006
Your "Network News Show" will need help
if it's going to hold.

571
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,550
Beale doesn't do the "angry man" thing
well at all.

572
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,677
He's too kvetchy.
He's being irascible.

573
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,930
We want a prophet, not a curmudgeon.
He should do more apocalyptic doom.

574
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,809
I think you should have some writers
write some jeremiads for him.

575
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,438
I see you don't fancy my suggestions.

576
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,483
You're not serious?

577
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,277
I'm serious.

578
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,322
The fact is, I could make
your Beale show...

579
00:35:56,406 --> 00:36:00,368
the highest-rated news show in TV
if you'd let me have a crack at it.

580
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,580
What do you mean,
"have a crack at it"?

581
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:05,498
I'd like to program it for you.

582
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,167
Develop it.

583
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,963
I wouldn't interfere with
the news itself, but TV is show biz...

584
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,967
and even the news has to have
a little showmanship.

585
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,303
My God, you are serious.

586
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:22,515
I watched your six o'clock news today.
It's straight tabloid.

587
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,102
You had a minute and a half of that lady
riding naked in Central Park...

588
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,272
but you had less than a minute
of hard national and international news.

589
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:32,067
It was all sex, scandal,
brutal crime, sports...

590
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,487
children with incurable diseases
and lost puppies.

591
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:38,948
So I won't listen to protestations
of high standards of journalism...

592
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,868
when you're on the streets, soliciting
audiences like the rest of us.

593
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,955
All I'm saying is, if you're going
to hustle, at least do it right.

594
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,125
I'm going to bring this up at tomorrow's
meeting, but I don't like hassles.

595
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:52,587
I was hoping we could work this out
between us. That's why I'm here.

596
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,509
And I was hoping you were looking for
an emotional involvement...

597
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,761
with a craggy, middle-aged man.

598
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,306
I wouldn't rule that out entirely.

599
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,062
All right, Diana...

600
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:12,857
bring up all your ideas at the meeting,
because if you don't, I will.

601
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,861
I think Howard's making
a goddamn fool of himself...

602
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:21,032
and so does everybody that Howard
and I know in this industry.

603
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,493
It was a fluke.
Didn't work.

604
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,831
So tomorrow, Howard goes back
to the old format...

605
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:31,793
and all of this gutter depravity
comes to an end.

606
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,348
I don't get it.

607
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,811
You hung around until 7:30
and then came down here...

608
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:52,814
just to pitch a couple
of loony show-biz ideas...

609
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:56,776
when you knew goddamn well
I'd laugh you right out of the office.

610
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,237
I don't get it.

611
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,157
What's your scam in this?

612
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,620
My visit here tonight was a gesture made
out of your stature in the industry...

613
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,624
and because I personally admired you
since I was a kid...

614
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,210
majoring in speech
at the University of Missouri.

615
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:19,257
Sooner or later, with or without you,
I'm going to take over your news show.

616
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,885
I figured I might as well start tonight.

617
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:25,847
I think I once gave a lecture...

618
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,184
at the University of Missouri.

619
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:33,938
I was in the audience. I had
a schoolgirl crush on you for months.

620
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:38,943
If we could get back for a moment
to that gypsy who predicted...

621
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:43,239
all that about emotional involvements
and middle-aged men...

622
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,868
what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

623
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:58,880
I can't make it tonight.
Call me tomorrow.

624
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,552
- Do you have a favorite restaurant?
- I eat anything.

625
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,139
I get a feeling I'm being made.

626
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:09,641
You are.

627
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,978
I've got to warn you.
I don't do anything on my first date.

628
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,480
We'll see.

629
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,738
Schmuck, what are you getting into?

630
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:49,264
I was married for four years
and pretended to be happy.

631
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,975
I had six years of analysis
and pretended to be sane.

632
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,438
My husband ran off
with his boyfriend...

633
00:39:56,521 --> 00:40:01,109
and I had an affair with my analyst who
told me I was the worst lay he ever had.

634
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:05,280
I can't tell you how many men
have told me what a lousy lay I am.

635
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,575
I apparently have
a masculine temperament.

636
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:12,537
I arouse quickly,
consummate prematurely...

637
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,665
and I can't wait to get my clothes
back on and get out of that bedroom.

638
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,837
I seem to be inept at everything
except my work.

639
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,965
I'm good at my work.

640
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,593
So I confine myself to that.

641
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:30,138
All I want out of life
is a 30 share and a 20 rating.

642
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,850
You're married, surely?

643
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,853
Twenty-five years.

644
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:41,191
I have a married daughter in Seattle
who's six months pregnant...

645
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:46,404
and a younger girl who's starting
at Northwestern in January.

646
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:51,201
Well, Max, here we are.

647
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:56,039
Middle-aged man reaffirming
his middle-aged manhood...

648
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:59,084
and a terrified young woman
with a father complex.

649
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,670
What sort of script
can we make out of this?

650
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:08,134
Corridor gossip says that you're
Frank Hackett's backstage girl.

651
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:10,595
I'm not.

652
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:15,642
Frank's a corporation man,
body and soul.

653
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,727
He has no loves, lusts
or allegiances...

654
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,231
that are not consummately directed
toward becoming a CCA board member.

655
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:24,150
Why should he bother with me?
I'm not even a stockholder.

656
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:30,281
What about your loves,
lusts and allegiances?

657
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,534
Is your wife in town?

658
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:34,035
Yes.

659
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:37,789
Then we better go to my place.

660
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:42,127
I can't hear you.
You'll have to talk a little louder.

661
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,886
Yes, I hear you.

662
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:56,891
Yes.

663
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,146
Yes.

664
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:08,528
Why me?

665
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,699
I said, "Why me?"

666
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,013
Howard in his office?

667
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:41,227
I'm killing this whole screwball
"angry prophet" thing.

668
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:43,521
Tonight we go back to straight news.

669
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:53,990
Yeah? Max, I'm telling you he's fine.

670
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:57,118
He's been sharp all day.
He's been as funny as hell.

671
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,412
Had everybody cracking up
at the rundown meeting.

672
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,498
I told him!

673
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,708
Cue VTA.

674
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,919
Ready two.

675
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,508
- Cue announcer.
- The "UBS Evening News"...

676
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,593
with Howard Beale.

677
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:18,431
Last night I was awakened
from a fitful sleep...

678
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:21,184
shortly after 2:00 in the morning...

679
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:24,312
by a shrill, sibilant,
faceless voice.

680
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:28,024
I couldn't make it out at first
in the dark bedroom.

681
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:32,195
I said, "I'm sorry.
You'll have to talk a little louder. "

682
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:35,949
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

683
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:39,327
The voice said to me,
"I want you to tell the truth.

684
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:42,247
Not easy to do, because the people
don't want to know the truth. "

685
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,083
I said, "You're kidding?

686
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,085
What should I know about the truth?"

687
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:51,715
But the voice said to me,
"Don't worry about the truth. "

688
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:53,758
I will put the words in your mouth. "

689
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,761
I said,
"Is this the burning bush?

690
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,263
I'm not Moses. "

691
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:01,599
The voice said, "I'm not God.
What has that got to do with it?"

692
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:06,021
The voice said, "We're not talking
about eternal, absolute truth.

693
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,815
We're talking about impermanent,
transient, human truth!

694
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,776
I don't expect people
to be capable of truth...

695
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,404
but at least you're capable
of self-preservation. "

696
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:19,242
I said, "Why me?"

697
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:22,037
The voice said, "Because you're
on television, dummy. "

698
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,330
Beautiful.

699
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:27,542
"Forty million Americans listen to you,
and after the show, maybe 50 million.

700
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:31,838
I'm not asking you to walk the land
in sackcloth preaching the Armageddon.

701
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,340
You're on TV."

702
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,343
I thought about it for a moment.

703
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:40,305
Then I said, "Okay. "

704
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,869
Close the door, Harry.

705
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:09,209
Howard, I'm taking you off the air.

706
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,672
I think you're having a breakdown,
require treatment.

707
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:19,344
This is not a psychotic episode.

708
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:22,055
This is a cleansing moment of clarity.

709
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:27,894
I'm imbued.

710
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:33,274
I'm imbued with some special spirit.
It's not a religious feeling at all.

711
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,986
It's a shocking eruption
of great electrical energy.

712
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:39,489
I feel vivid and flashing...

713
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:44,703
as if suddenly I'd been plugged
into a great electromagnetic field.

714
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,290
I feel connected to all living things.

715
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:52,502
To flowers, birds...

716
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:55,630
all the animals of the world...

717
00:45:57,424 --> 00:46:02,887
and even to some great,
unseen living force...

718
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,724
what I think the Hindus
call "prana. "

719
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,185
But it's not a breakdown.

720
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:11,980
I've never felt more orderly
in my life.

721
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:16,276
It is a shattering
and beautiful sensation.

722
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:20,905
It is the exalted flow
of the space-time continuum...

723
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:24,242
save that it is spaceless
and timeless...

724
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,579
and such loveliness.

725
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,544
I feel on the verge
of some great ultimate truth.

726
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:44,763
And you will not take me off the air
for now or any other spaceless time!

727
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:54,147
- Is he okay?
- He's just fainted.

728
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,233
I better get him back to my house
again tonight.

729
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,402
Help me get him up.

730
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,092
This is crazy.

731
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,930
The whole place has gone crazy.
They just seem to hassle me.

732
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,263
Wake up, Max,
because Howard's gone.

733
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:54,517
I'll make you some coffee.

734
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,686
You don't know where he is?
The son of a bitch is a hit!

735
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,397
Goddamn it!
Over 2,000 phone calls!

736
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:03,902
In the mail room, over 14,000 telegrams!
The response is sensational!

737
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:06,196
Tell him.
Herb's phone hasn't stopped ringing.

738
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:11,576
Every affiliate from Albuquerque
to Sandusky! Response is sensational!

739
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,995
Yes. All right.

740
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,373
For you, Herb.
Go to your office.

741
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:19,876
Moldanian called me. Joe Donnelly
called me. We've got a goddamn hit!

742
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:24,089
Show him the Times. We even got
an editorial in the New York Times.

743
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:26,424
- "A Call to Morality. "
- I don't know where he is.

744
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,511
That crazy Beale has caught on. Don't
tell me you don't know where he is.

745
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:32,180
He could be jumping off a roof
for all I know!

746
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:35,684
The man is insane!
He's not responsible for himself!

747
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,727
He needs care and treatment.

748
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:42,023
All you grave robbers think about
is that he's a hit.

749
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:44,651
It's just possible
that he isn't insane...

750
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,904
that he is, in fact,
imbued with some special spirit.

751
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:51,533
I'm supposed to be the romantic!
You're the hard-bitten realist!

752
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:54,661
All right. Howard Beale
obviously fills a void.

753
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:56,705
The audience
obviously wants a prophet...

754
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:59,624
even a manufactured one...
even if he's as mad as Moses.

755
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,335
By tomorrow he'll have a 50 share,
maybe a 60.

756
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,379
Howard Beale
is processed instant God.

757
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:07,257
It looks like he may go over bigger
than Mary Tyler Moore.

758
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:10,093
I am not putting Howard
back on the air!

759
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:12,137
It's not your show anymore.
It's mine.

760
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:16,766
I gave her the show.

761
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:20,020
I'm putting the "Network News Show"
under programming.

762
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:23,231
Mr. Ruddy had a heart attack
and is not taking calls.

763
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:26,276
In his absence,
I'm making all network decisions...

764
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:29,946
including one I've been wanting to make
a long time: You're fired.

765
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,657
I want you out of this building
by noon.

766
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:36,036
I'll call security and have you
thrown out if you're still here.

767
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,291
Well, let's say
fuck you, Hackett.

768
00:50:41,332 --> 00:50:43,418
You want me out of here...

769
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:47,380
you'll have to drag me and the whole
News Division out kicking and screaming.

770
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:50,133
You think they'll quit their jobs
for you? Not in this recession.

771
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,135
Ruddy will have your ass.

772
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:55,680
I got a hit!
Ruddy doesn't count anymore!

773
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:58,641
He was hoping I'd fall on my face
with this Beale show, but I didn't.

774
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:01,686
It's a big, fat, big-titted hit...

775
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,938
and I don't have to waffle around
with Ruddy anymore.

776
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:06,316
If he wants to take me before
the CCA board, let him.

777
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:09,277
Do you think Ruddy is stupid enough
to go to the CCA board and say...

778
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,654
"I'm taking our one hit show
off the air. "

779
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:16,493
Come November 14, I'll be at the annual
CCA Management Review Meeting...

780
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:19,037
and I'll announce projected earnings
for this network...

781
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,289
for the first time in five years!

782
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:25,418
Believe me, Mr. Jensen will be
sitting there, rocking back and forth...

783
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:29,964
and he'll say, "That's very good, Frank.
Keep it up. "

784
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:33,510
So don't have illusions about who's
running this network. You're fired.

785
00:51:33,593 --> 00:51:37,305
I want you out of your office before
noon, or I'll have you thrown out.

786
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,144
You go along with this?

787
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,981
I told you I didn't want
a network hassle.

788
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:50,652
I told you I'd much rather
work the Beale show out between us.

789
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,906
Well, let's just say
fuck you, too, honey.

790
00:51:56,741 --> 00:51:59,077
Howard Beale may be my best friend.
I'll go to court.

791
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,288
I'll put him in a hospital before I let
you exploit him like a carnival freak.

792
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:04,207
You get your psychiatrist.
I'll get mine.

793
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,711
I'm gonna spread this reeking business
in every newspaper...

794
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:10,630
on every network, group and affiliate
in this country!

795
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:12,882
I'm gonna make
a lot of noise about this!

796
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:15,260
We need all the press we can get!

797
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,223
Something going on
between you and Schumacher?

798
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:23,393
Not anymore.

799
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,122
- How do you do, Mr. Beale?
- I must make my witness.

800
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:46,291
Sure thing, Mr. Beale.

801
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:52,547
Oil ministers of the OPEC nations
meeting in Vienna...

802
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,010
still haven't decided how much
to increase the price of oil.

803
00:52:57,093 --> 00:53:00,221
Yeah? He came in the building
five minutes ago.

804
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:03,058
Tell Snowden when he comes in
to let him go on.

805
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,060
Did you get that, Paul?

806
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:10,523
More on that story
from Edward Fletcher in Vienna.

807
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:14,444
This has been the most divisive meeting
the oil states have ever had.

808
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,866
The 13 nations of OPEC
have still not...

809
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:23,078
been able to decide by how much
to increase the price of oil.

810
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:26,706
How much time we got?

811
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:29,959
We've got five seconds.
Hurry up.

812
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,341
Take two. Cue Howard.

813
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:39,969
I don't have to tell you things are bad.
Everybody knows things are bad.

814
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:41,971
It's a depression.

815
00:53:42,013 --> 00:53:46,351
Everybody's out of work
or scared of losing their job.

816
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:49,396
The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
Banks are going bust.

817
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:53,566
Shopkeepers keep guns under the counter.
Punks are running wild in the street.

818
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,444
Nobody anywhere seems to know
what to do, and there's no end to it.

819
00:53:57,862 --> 00:54:02,575
We know the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat.

820
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,870
We sit watching our TVs
while some newscaster tells us...

821
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:09,541
that today we had 15 homicides
and 63 violent crimes...

822
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:11,543
as if that's the way
it's supposed to be!

823
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:15,005
We know things are bad.
Worse than bad. They're crazy.

824
00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:18,383
Everything everywhere is going crazy,
so we don't go out anymore.

825
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:21,886
We sit in the house. Slowly the world
we're living in is getting smaller.

826
00:54:21,928 --> 00:54:25,390
All we say is, "Please. At least
leave us alone in our living rooms.

827
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:28,893
Let me have my toaster, my TV
my steel-belted radials.

828
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:31,021
I won't say anything
Just leave us alone. "

829
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:34,607
I'm not gonna leave you alone.
I want you to get mad!

830
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:38,194
I don't want you to protest or riot.

831
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,864
Don't write to your congressman.
I don't know what to tell you to write.

832
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:43,491
I don't know what to do
about depression, inflation...

833
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:45,535
the Russians,
the crime in the streets.

834
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:48,580
All I know is that first
you've got to get mad!

835
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:51,708
You've got to say,
"I'm a human being, goddamn it!

836
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,793
My life has value!"

837
00:54:56,421 --> 00:55:00,884
So, I want you to get up now.

838
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:04,346
I want all of you to get up
out of your chairs.

839
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:07,766
I want you to get up now
and go to the window...

840
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:11,102
open it,
stick your head out and yell...

841
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:15,690
"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm
not gonna take this anymore!"

842
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:17,692
I want you to get up right now.

843
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:20,403
- Stay with him.
- Sit up! Go to your windows.

844
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,739
Open them,
stick your head out and yell...

845
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,909
"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm
not gonna take this anymore!"

846
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:29,371
- How many stations does it go out live?
- Sixty-seven.

847
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:33,625
"I'm not gonna take this anymore. "

848
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:37,462
Then we'll figure out what to do
about the depression and the oil crisis.

849
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,381
First, get out of your chairs...

850
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:43,009
open the window,
stick your head out and yell...

851
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:45,220
"I'm as mad as hell...

852
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:47,639
and I'm not gonna
take this anymore!"

853
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:49,891
- Who are you talking to?
- Atlanta.

854
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:52,727
Are they yelling in Atlanta?

855
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,771
But first you've gotta get mad.

856
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:59,401
You've gotta say, "I'm as mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"

857
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:01,403
They're yelling in Baton Rouge.

858
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,072
Get up!

859
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:07,784
Son of a bitch!
We've struck the mother lode!

860
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:11,830
Stick your head out of the window
and keep yelling.

861
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:14,499
Yell, "I'm as mad as hell.

862
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:16,334
I'm not gonna take this anymore. "

863
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:18,962
Just get up from your chairs.

864
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:21,256
- Where you going?
- I want to see if anybody's yelling.

865
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:23,299
Open it and stick your head out.

866
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,343
Yell and keep yelling...

867
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:28,972
I'm mad as hell!

868
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:31,099
I'm not gonna take this anymore!

869
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:38,940
I'm mad as hell, and I'm
not gonna take it anymore!

870
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:03,548
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not
going to take this anymore!

871
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,379
By mid-October, the "Howard Beale Show"
had settled in at a 42 share...

872
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:46,466
more than equaling all the other
network news shows combined.

873
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:49,010
In the Nielsen ratings,
the "Howard Beale Show"...

874
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,429
was the fourth-highest-rated show
of the month...

875
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:54,974
surpassed only by "The Six Million
Dollar Man," "All in the Family"...

876
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:56,309
and "Phyllis"...

877
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:59,145
a phenomenal state of affairs
for a news show.

878
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:02,649
On October 15, Diana Christensen
flew to Los Angeles...

879
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:05,110
for what the trade calls
powwows and confabs...

880
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:07,570
with her West Coast
programming execs...

881
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,865
and to get production rolling
on the shows for the coming season.

882
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:15,995
Christ! You brought half the William
Morris West Coast Office along with you.

883
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,875
I'm Diana Christensen, a racist lackey
of the imperialist ruling circles.

884
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:23,670
I'm Laureen Hobbs,
a bad-ass commie nigger.

885
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:26,381
Sounds like the basis
of a firm friendship.

886
00:58:26,464 --> 00:58:28,800
- We'll need more chairs.
- Anybody want coffee?

887
00:58:28,883 --> 00:58:31,177
I'd love some.

888
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,395
This is my lawyer, Sam Haywood,
and his associate, Merrill Grant.

889
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:47,360
Miss Christensen, just what the hell's
this all about?

890
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:50,739
Because, when a national
television network...

891
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:55,243
in the person of booby here
comes to me and says...

892
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:58,455
they want to put the ongoing struggle
of the oppressed masses...

893
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:00,498
on prime-time television...

894
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:02,500
I have to regard this askance!

895
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:07,505
Mr. Haywood was saying
that our client, Miss Hobbs...

896
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,634
wants it up front that
the political content of the show...

897
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:13,970
has to be in her control.

898
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,599
She can have it. I don't give a damn
about the political content.

899
00:59:18,558 --> 00:59:20,185
What kind of show?

900
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:23,271
I'm interested in doing
a weekly dramatic series...

901
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:25,815
based on the
Ecumenical Liberation Army...

902
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:29,694
and the first show has to be
a two-hour special on Mary Ann Gifford.

903
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:35,241
I want a lot more film like the bank
rip-off the Ecumenical sent in.

904
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:37,911
The way I see the series is...

905
00:59:37,994 --> 00:59:42,874
each week we open with an authentic act
of political terrorism...

906
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:45,251
taken on the spot
and in the actual moment.

907
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:48,213
Then we go to the drama behind
the opening film footage.

908
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:50,423
That's your job, Miss Hobbs.

909
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:54,469
You've got to get the Ecumenicals
to bring in that film footage for us.

910
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:58,473
The network can't deal with them.
They are wanted criminals.

911
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,435
The Ecumenical Liberation Army
is an ultra-left sect...

912
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:04,062
creating political confusion...

913
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:07,315
with wildcat violence
and pseudo-insurrectionary acts...

914
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:09,567
which the Communist Party
does not endorse.

915
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,862
The American masses are not yet ready
for open revolt.

916
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,824
We would not want to produce
a television show...

917
01:00:15,907 --> 01:00:19,327
celebrating historically
deviational terrorism.

918
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:22,288
I'm offering you an hour
of prime-time television every week...

919
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:24,332
into which you can stick
whatever propaganda you want.

920
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:27,794
The Ecumenicals are an undisciplined
ultra-left gang...

921
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,380
whose leader is an eccentric,
to say the least.

922
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:35,260
He calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan
and wears a hussar's shako.

923
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:38,471
We're talking about
30 to 50 million people a shot.

924
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:40,515
It's better than handing out...

925
01:00:40,598 --> 01:00:43,226
mimeographed pamphlets
on ghetto street corners.

926
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:52,485
I'll have to take this matter
to the Central Committee.

927
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:56,322
And I'd better check it out
with the Great Ahmed Khan.

928
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:02,162
I'll be in L.A. Until Saturday,
and I'd like to get it rolling.

929
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:40,075
Well, Ahmed,
you ain't gonna believe this...

930
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:44,454
but I'm gonna make
a TV star outta you.

931
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:47,874
Just like Archie Bunker.

932
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,627
You gonna be a household word.

933
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:54,756
What the fuck are you talking about?

934
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:57,676
- Thirty seconds.
- Ready VTA.

935
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,928
One, you have the audience to pan.

936
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:02,681
Two, you have the window to pull.

937
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,891
Three, you're on the announcer.

938
01:02:04,974 --> 01:02:06,434
Twenty.

939
01:02:08,561 --> 01:02:09,854
Stand by VTA.

940
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:13,274
Fifteen, 14, 13, 12...

941
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:15,944
- Ready A.
- Roll VTA.

942
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:18,613
Nine, 8, 7...

943
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:21,741
6, 5, 4...

944
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,785
3, 2, 1.

945
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:25,453
Three, cue announcer!

946
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:28,957
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it!
How do you feel?

947
01:02:28,998 --> 01:02:30,792
We're mad as hell...

948
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:33,795
and we're not gonna take this anymore!

949
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,797
Ladies and gentlemen,
the "Network News Hour"...

950
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,716
with Sybil the Soothsayer...

951
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:45,515
Jim Webbing and his
It's-The-Emmes-Truth Department...

952
01:02:49,185 --> 01:02:51,730
Miss Mata Hari
and her skeletons in the closet.

953
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,486
Plus tonight, another segment
of "Vox Populi. "

954
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:06,786
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

955
01:03:21,926 --> 01:03:24,346
Edward George Ruddy died today!

956
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:27,015
Edward George Ruddy
was the chairman of the board...

957
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,768
of the Union Broadcasting Systems...

958
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:33,313
and he died at 11:00 this morning
of a heart condition.

959
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:36,691
Woe is us!
We're in a lot of trouble!

960
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:45,075
So, a rich little man
with white hair died.

961
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:48,661
What does that got to do
with the price of rice, right?

962
01:03:48,703 --> 01:03:50,747
And why is that woe to us?

963
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:54,793
Because you people...

964
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:58,838
and 62 million other Americans
are listening to me right now.

965
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:02,717
Because less than three percent
of you people read books.

966
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:07,806
Because less than 15 percent of you
read newspapers.

967
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:11,643
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.

968
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:15,230
Right now, there is a whole
and entire generation...

969
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:18,525
that never knew anything
that didn't come out of this tube!

970
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:23,988
This tube is the Gospel.
The ultimate revelation.

971
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:26,241
This tube can make or break...

972
01:04:26,324 --> 01:04:29,035
presidents, popes, prime ministers.

973
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,290
This tube is the most awesome goddamn
force in the whole godless world...

974
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:37,252
and woe is us if it ever falls
into the hands of the wrong people!

975
01:04:37,293 --> 01:04:40,588
And that's why woe is us
that Edward George Ruddy died.

976
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:44,551
Because this company is now
in the hands of CCA...

977
01:04:44,634 --> 01:04:47,262
the Communication Corporation
of America.

978
01:04:47,345 --> 01:04:50,724
There's a new chairman of the board,
a man called Frank Hackett...

979
01:04:50,765 --> 01:04:52,767
sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office
on the 20th floor.

980
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:57,105
And when the 12th largest company
in the world...

981
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:00,608
controls the most awesome,
goddamn propaganda force...

982
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,610
in the whole godless world...

983
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:06,740
who knows what shit will be peddled
for truth on this network!

984
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:09,826
So you listen to me.
Listen to me!

985
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:12,662
Television is not the truth.

986
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:15,248
Television's
a goddamned amusement park!

987
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:19,544
Television is a circus, a carnival,
a traveling troupe of acrobats...

988
01:05:19,627 --> 01:05:23,214
storytellers, dancers, singers,
jugglers, sideshow freaks...

989
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:26,134
lion tamers and football players.

990
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:28,636
We're in the boredom-killing business.

991
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:34,684
So if you want the truth,
go to God.

992
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,145
Go to your gurus.

993
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:39,272
Go to yourselves!

994
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:43,443
Because that's the only place
you're ever gonna find any real truth.

995
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:48,948
But, man, you're never gonna get
any truth from us.

996
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,951
We'll tell you anything you wanna hear.
We lie like hell.

997
01:05:51,993 --> 01:05:55,038
We'll tell you that Kojak
always gets the killer...

998
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:58,333
and that nobody ever gets cancer
in Archie Bunker's house.

999
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,752
And no matter how much trouble
the hero is in, don't worry.

1000
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:03,546
Look at your watch.
At the end of the hour he'll win!

1001
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,092
We'll tell you any shit
you want to hear!

1002
01:06:07,175 --> 01:06:10,929
We deal in illusions.
None of it is true!

1003
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:14,974
But you people sit there,
day after day, night after night.

1004
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:19,229
You're all ages, colors, creeds.
We're all you know.

1005
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:22,232
You're beginning to believe
the illusions we're spinning here.

1006
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:26,111
You're beginning to think the tube is
reality and your own lives are unreal.

1007
01:06:26,194 --> 01:06:28,279
You do whatever the tube tells you!

1008
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:30,490
You dress like the tube,
eat like the tube...

1009
01:06:30,573 --> 01:06:33,702
raise your children like the tube,
even think like the tube.

1010
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:37,330
This is mass madness, you maniacs!

1011
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:40,125
In God's name, you people
are the real thing!

1012
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:42,377
We are the illusion!

1013
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,257
So turn off your television sets.
Turn them off right now.

1014
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,342
Turn them off and leave them off.

1015
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:52,595
Turn them off in the middle
of this sentence.

1016
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,681
Turn them off!

1017
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,990
UBS was running at a cash flow
of break-even point...

1018
01:07:12,073 --> 01:07:16,578
after taking into account $110 million
of negative cash flow from the network.

1019
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:20,206
It was clear the fat on the network
had to be flitched off.

1020
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:23,543
Please note an increase in projected
initial programming revenues...

1021
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:25,712
in the amount of $21 million...

1022
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:29,424
due to the phenomenal success
of the "Howard Beale Show. "

1023
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:35,680
I expect a positive cash flow
for the entire complex of 45 million...

1024
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:38,016
achievable in this fiscal year...

1025
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:40,685
a year, in short,
ahead of schedule.

1026
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,521
Beyond that...

1027
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,441
this network may be
the most significant profit center...

1028
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,902
of the communications complex...

1029
01:07:48,943 --> 01:07:53,073
and based upon the projected rate
of return on invested capital...

1030
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:56,993
and if merger is accomplished,
the communications complex...

1031
01:07:57,077 --> 01:08:01,414
may well become the towering
and most profitable center...

1032
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:04,125
in the entire CCA empire.

1033
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:09,464
I await your questions and comments.

1034
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:11,049
Mr. Jensen?

1035
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:14,928
Very good, Frank. Exemplary.
Keep it up.

1036
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,123
Buy you a cup of coffee?

1037
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,334
Hell, yes.

1038
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:49,796
Do you have to get back
to the office?

1039
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:52,173
Nothing that can't wait.

1040
01:09:04,644 --> 01:09:08,231
I drop down to the news studios
now and then...

1041
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:10,400
and ask Howard Beale about you.

1042
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:13,653
He says you're doing fine.
Are you?

1043
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:16,489
Are you keeping busy?

1044
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:18,324
In a fashion.

1045
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:22,662
This is the third funeral
I've been to in two weeks.

1046
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:27,542
I have two other friends in the hospital
whom I visit regularly.

1047
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:30,795
I've been to a couple of christenings.

1048
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:34,632
All my friends seem to be dying
or having grandchildren.

1049
01:09:35,675 --> 01:09:38,011
You should be a grandfather yourself
about now.

1050
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,847
You have a pregnant daughter
in Seattle, don't you?

1051
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,974
Any day now.

1052
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:45,560
My wife's out there
for the occasion.

1053
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:53,526
I've thought many times of calling you.

1054
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,739
I wish you had.

1055
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:04,788
I bumped into Sybil the Soothsayer
in the elevator last week.

1056
01:10:04,871 --> 01:10:07,832
I said, "You know, Sybil,
about four months ago...

1057
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:12,253
you predicted I would get involved
with a craggy, middle-aged man.

1058
01:10:12,295 --> 01:10:15,965
So far, all that's happened
has been one many-splendored night.

1059
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:19,386
I don't call that
getting involved. "

1060
01:10:19,427 --> 01:10:22,889
She said,
"Don't worry. You will. "

1061
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:29,354
It was a many-splendored night,
wasn't it, Max?

1062
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,191
Yes, it was.

1063
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,154
Are we going to get involved?

1064
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:44,828
Yes. I need to become involved
very much.

1065
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,248
How about you?

1066
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:52,585
I've reached for the phone to call you
a hundred times...

1067
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:55,714
but I was sure you hated me for my part
in taking your news show away.

1068
01:10:57,549 --> 01:11:00,760
I probably did.
I don't know anymore.

1069
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:05,849
All I know is,
I can't get you out of my mind.

1070
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,814
Marty, I know what NBC offered them.

1071
01:11:12,897 --> 01:11:18,611
Go to 3.5, and I want an option
for a third run on all of them.

1072
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:22,032
I'm in a big hurry, and you and Charlie
are supposed to be negotiating this.

1073
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,159
Good-bye, good luck.
I'll see you Monday.

1074
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:31,207
- Jimmy Caan's agent says absolutely nix.
- You can't win them all.

1075
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:34,753
- Where can I reach you later today?
- You can't. I'll be gone all weekend.

1076
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:44,679
NBC's offering 3.25 mil
per package of five James Bond movies...

1077
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:47,807
and I think I'm gonna steal them
for 3.5...

1078
01:11:47,849 --> 01:11:49,976
with a third run.

1079
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,653
I'm gonna stick the "Mao Tse-tung Hour"
in at 8:00...

1080
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:05,325
because we're having a lot of trouble
selling the "Mao Tse-tung Hour. "

1081
01:12:14,084 --> 01:12:18,963
That "Mao Tse-tung Hour's" turning
into one big pain in the ass.

1082
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:23,927
We're having heavy legal problems
with the federal government right now.

1083
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:30,266
Two FBI guys turned up in Hackett's
office and served us with a subpoena.

1084
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:36,481
They heard about our Flagstaff
bank rip-off film, and they want it.

1085
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:40,443
Hackett told the FBI to fuck off.

1086
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,617
We're getting around the FBI...

1087
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:51,079
by doing the show in collaboration
with the news division.

1088
01:12:51,162 --> 01:12:53,456
We're standing on the First Amendment:
Freedom of the press...

1089
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,001
and the right to protect our sources.

1090
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:59,754
Walter thinks we can knock out
the misprision of felony charge.

1091
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:10,890
But he says absolutely nix
on going to series.

1092
01:13:10,932 --> 01:13:16,229
They'll hit us with "conspiracy
with an inducement to commit a crime. "

1093
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:18,398
Christ, it's cold in here.

1094
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:23,069
We're paying these Ecumencial
Liberation Army nuts $10,000 a week...

1095
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:26,656
in order to turn in authentic film
of their revolutionary activities.

1096
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,785
That inconstitutes
"inducement to commit a crime"...

1097
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:34,289
and Walter says we'll all wind up
in federal prison.

1098
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:40,337
I said, "Walter,
let the federal government sue us.

1099
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,714
We'll take them to the Supreme Court.

1100
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:44,758
We'll be front page. "

1101
01:13:46,384 --> 01:13:49,220
The New York Times
and the Washington Post...

1102
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,222
will write editorials.

1103
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:55,727
We'll be front page for months.
We'll have more press than Watergate.

1104
01:13:55,810 --> 01:14:00,648
All I need is six weeks
federal litigation...

1105
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:04,319
and the "Mao Tse-tung Hour" can start
carrying its own time slot.

1106
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,631
What's really bugging me now
is my daytime programming.

1107
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:28,343
NBC's got a lock on daytime...

1108
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:31,137
with their lousy game shows...

1109
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:33,807
and I'd like to bust them.

1110
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:38,353
I'm thinking of doing
a homosexual soap opera. "The Dykes. "

1111
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:42,565
The heartrending saga about a woman...

1112
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:45,944
hopelessly in love
with her husband's mistress.

1113
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:48,154
What do you think?

1114
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,376
How long has it been going on?

1115
01:15:03,878 --> 01:15:05,463
A month.

1116
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:10,635
I thought it was a transient thing,
blow over in a week.

1117
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:17,017
I still pray to God
it's just a menopausal infatuation.

1118
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,938
But it is an infatuation, Louise.

1119
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,526
There's no sense in my saying
I won't see her again, because I will.

1120
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:35,243
You want me to leave,
check into a hotel?

1121
01:15:38,246 --> 01:15:40,248
Do you love her?

1122
01:15:43,668 --> 01:15:45,879
I don't know how I feel.

1123
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:51,551
I'm grateful I can feel anything.

1124
01:15:54,262 --> 01:15:56,264
I know I'm obsessed with her.

1125
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,477
Then say it!

1126
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:04,981
Don't keep telling me that
you're obsessed, you're infatuated!

1127
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,525
Say that you're in love with her.

1128
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:13,281
I'm in love with her.

1129
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:17,786
Then get out! Go anywhere you want.
Go live with her, but don't come back!

1130
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:22,415
Because after 25 years of building
a home and raising a family...

1131
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:26,169
and all the senseless pain
that we have inflicted on each other...

1132
01:16:26,252 --> 01:16:29,631
I'm damned if I'll stand and have you
say you're in love with somebody else!

1133
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:36,137
This isn't the convention weekend
with your secretary, is it?

1134
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:40,517
Or some broad that you picked up
after three belts of booze.

1135
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,395
This is your great winter romance,
isn't it?

1136
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:47,607
Your last roar of passion before
you settle into your emeritus years.

1137
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:50,777
Is that what's left for me?
Is that my share?

1138
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,697
She gets the winter passion,
and I get the dotage?

1139
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,367
Am I supposed to sit home
knitting and purling...

1140
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:01,079
while you slink back
like some penitent drunk?

1141
01:17:01,162 --> 01:17:03,248
I'm your wife, damn it...

1142
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:05,458
and if you can't work up
a winter passion for me...

1143
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,712
the least I require
is respect and allegiance!

1144
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:24,602
I hurt!
Don't you understand that?

1145
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:29,733
I hurt badly!

1146
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,035
Oh, say something for God's sake.

1147
01:17:49,794 --> 01:17:52,172
I've got nothing to say.

1148
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,185
I won't give you up easily.

1149
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:14,444
I think perhaps it is better
if you move out.

1150
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,494
Does she love you?

1151
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:30,210
I'm not sure she's capable
of any real feelings.

1152
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:34,339
She's television generation.
She learned life from Bugs Bunny.

1153
01:18:34,422 --> 01:18:38,176
The only reality she knows
comes to her from over the TV set.

1154
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:43,973
She's very carefully devised a number
of scenarios for all of us to play...

1155
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:46,893
like a movie of the week.

1156
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:52,273
My God, look at us.

1157
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:55,652
Here we are going through
the obligatory middle-of-act-two...

1158
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:59,698
"scorned wife throws
peccant husband out" scene.

1159
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:03,201
But don't worry,
I'll come back to you in the end.

1160
01:19:03,284 --> 01:19:06,538
All of her plot outlines have me
leaving her and coming back to you...

1161
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:11,251
because the audience won't buy a
rejection of the happy American family.

1162
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:17,632
She does have one script
in which I kill myself.

1163
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:21,928
An adapted-for-television version
of "Anna Karenina"...

1164
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:26,224
where she's Count Vronsky
and I'm Anna.

1165
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,606
You're in for some dreadful grief.

1166
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:37,986
I know.

1167
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:41,489
The "Mao Tse-tung Hour"
went on the air March 14.

1168
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:43,867
It received a 47 share.

1169
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:47,120
The network promptly committed
to 15 shows with an option for 10 more.

1170
01:19:47,203 --> 01:19:50,623
There were the usual
contractual difficulties.

1171
01:19:50,665 --> 01:19:54,294
"Equal to 20 percent except that such
a percentage shall be 30 percent...

1172
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:57,047
for 90 minutes
or longer television programs. "

1173
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,924
Have we settled
that sub-licensing thing?

1174
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:03,053
We want a clear definition here.

1175
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:07,223
"Gross proceeds should consist of
all funds the sub-licensee receives...

1176
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,476
not merely the net amount remitted...

1177
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:12,854
after payment to the sub-licensee
or distributor. "

1178
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:16,649
We're not sitting still for overhead
charges as a cost prior to distribution.

1179
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:20,320
Don't fuck with my distribution costs!

1180
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:22,364
I'm making a lousy 215 per segment.

1181
01:20:22,405 --> 01:20:24,908
I'm already deficiting 25 grand a week
with Metro!

1182
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:26,910
I'm paying William Morris 10 percent
off the top!

1183
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:29,412
I'm giving this turkey ten thousand
per segment and five to this fruitcake.

1184
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:32,374
And, Helen, don't start
no shit with me about a piece again.

1185
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:35,251
I'm paying Metro 20 percent for all
foreign and Canadian distribution...

1186
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:37,420
and that's after recoupment!

1187
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:41,466
The Communist Party won't see a nickel
outta this show until syndication.

1188
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:44,010
The Party's in for 7,500 a week
production expenses!

1189
01:20:44,094 --> 01:20:47,847
I'm not giving
this pseudo-insurrectionary a piece.

1190
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:51,976
I won't give him script approval or
cut him in on my distribution charges.

1191
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,020
You fucking fascist!

1192
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,940
Did you see the film we made
of the San Marino jail breakout...

1193
01:20:57,023 --> 01:21:00,110
demonstrating the rising up of a
seminal prisoner class infrastructure?

1194
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:03,988
You can blow the seminal prisoner class
infrastructure out your ass!

1195
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,700
I'm not knocking down
my goddamn distribution charges!

1196
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:12,038
Man, give her
the fucking overhead clause.

1197
01:21:13,164 --> 01:21:15,166
Who's gonna believe this?

1198
01:21:17,585 --> 01:21:21,172
Let's get back to page 22.
Five, small "a. "

1199
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:23,842
"Subsidiary rights. "

1200
01:21:23,925 --> 01:21:27,470
- Where are we now?
- Middle of page 22, "Subsidiary rights. "

1201
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:31,307
"As used herein, 'subsidiary rights'
means without limitation any and all... "

1202
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:47,073
Over the past two days, you've had
opportunity to meet Diana Christensen...

1203
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:50,368
our vice president
in charge of programming.

1204
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:55,123
This afternoon, you all saw some of the
stuff she's set up for the new season.

1205
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:08,595
You all know that she is the woman
behind the "Howard Beale Show. "

1206
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:18,646
We all know she's beautiful.

1207
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:22,484
We all know she's brainy.

1208
01:22:22,525 --> 01:22:27,489
I was thinking, before we start digging
into our chateaubriands...

1209
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:32,077
let's show her how we feel about her.

1210
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:50,470
We've got the number one show
in television!

1211
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:58,186
At next year's affiliates' meeting, I'll
be telling you we've got the top five!

1212
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:07,237
Last year, we were
the number four network.

1213
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,739
Next year, we're number one!

1214
01:23:10,573 --> 01:23:12,033
We're number one!

1215
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:14,703
We're number one!

1216
01:23:25,588 --> 01:23:29,050
It is exactly 7:00
here in Los Angeles...

1217
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:33,054
and right now over a million homes
using television in this city...

1218
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:35,265
are turning their dials
to channel three...

1219
01:23:35,348 --> 01:23:37,934
and that's our channel!

1220
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:47,027
Howard Beale!

1221
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:52,407
Stop it! Stop it!

1222
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,826
Listen to me,
and listen carefully...

1223
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:59,414
because this is your goddamn life
I'm talking about today.

1224
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:03,501
In this country, when one company wants
to take over another company...

1225
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:05,879
they simply buy up a controlling share
of the stock...

1226
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,423
but first they have to file notice
with the government.

1227
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:11,593
That's how CCA took over the company
that owns this network.

1228
01:24:11,676 --> 01:24:15,096
But now somebody's buying up CCA.

1229
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:18,892
Somebody called
the Western World Funding Corporation.

1230
01:24:18,975 --> 01:24:21,269
They filed the notice this morning.

1231
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:25,357
Who in the hell is
the Western World Funding Corporation?

1232
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,943
It is a consortium of banks
and insurance companies...

1233
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:32,697
who are not buying CCA for themselves
but as agents for somebody else.

1234
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:35,116
And who is this somebody else?
They won't tell you.

1235
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:37,410
They won't tell you.
They won't tell the Senate.

1236
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:41,539
They won't tell the SEC, the FCC,
the Justice Department.

1237
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:45,460
This is Mr. Hackett.
Do you have a New York call for me?

1238
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:47,962
Do you want to
turn that down, please?

1239
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:51,091
I will tell you who
they're buying CCA for.

1240
01:24:51,174 --> 01:24:55,345
They're buying it for the
Saudi Arabian Investment Corporation.

1241
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:57,389
They're buying it for the Arabs!

1242
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,475
Clarence? Frank Hackett here.
How's everything back in New York?

1243
01:25:00,558 --> 01:25:02,560
How's the good lady?

1244
01:25:05,855 --> 01:25:09,651
Take it easy.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1245
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:12,445
When? Tonight's show?

1246
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:15,699
Clarence, take it easy.

1247
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:21,246
The "Howard Beale Show" is just going on
out here. You get it 3 hours earlier.

1248
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:25,500
Take it easy! How the hell could
I see it? It's just going on now!

1249
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:33,675
When did Mr. Jensen call?

1250
01:25:33,758 --> 01:25:36,469
We all know that the Arabs control...

1251
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:40,265
$16 billion in this country.

1252
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:44,436
They own a chunk of Fifth Avenue,
20 downtown pieces of Boston...

1253
01:25:44,519 --> 01:25:49,190
a part of the port of New Orleans,
an industrial park in Salt Lake City.

1254
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:51,526
They own big hunks
of the Atlanta Hilton...

1255
01:25:51,609 --> 01:25:54,112
the Arizona Land and Cattle Company...

1256
01:25:54,195 --> 01:25:56,489
the Security National Bank
in California...

1257
01:25:56,573 --> 01:25:58,658
the Bank of the Commonwealth
in Detroit.

1258
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:03,204
They control Aramco, so that puts them
into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil Oil.

1259
01:26:03,246 --> 01:26:07,667
They're all over! New Jersey,
Louisville, St. Louis, Missouri.

1260
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:12,380
And that's only what we know about.
There's more we don't know about.

1261
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:15,842
Because all of those Arab
petrol dollars are washed...

1262
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:19,220
through Switzerland and Canada
and the biggest banks in this country.

1263
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:23,433
For example, what we don't know about
is this CCA deal...

1264
01:26:23,516 --> 01:26:27,020
and all the other CCA deals.

1265
01:26:27,103 --> 01:26:30,774
Right now the Arabs have screwed us out
of enough American dollars...

1266
01:26:30,857 --> 01:26:32,901
to come right back
and with our own money...

1267
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:37,197
buy General Motors,
IBM, ITT, AT&T...

1268
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,242
Du Pont, U.S. Steel
and 20 other American companies.

1269
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:44,204
Hell, they already own
half of England!

1270
01:26:45,246 --> 01:26:46,748
Listen to me.

1271
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,958
Listen to me, goddamn it!

1272
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,127
The Arabs are simply buying us.

1273
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:54,798
There's only one thing
that can stop them! You!

1274
01:26:55,882 --> 01:26:57,550
You!

1275
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:00,887
So I want you to get up now.

1276
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:03,515
I want you to get up
out of your chairs.

1277
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:06,434
I want you to get up right now
and go to the phone.

1278
01:27:06,476 --> 01:27:09,229
I want you to get up from your chairs,
go to the phone...

1279
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:13,191
get in your cars, drive into
the Western Union offices in town.

1280
01:27:13,274 --> 01:27:16,653
I want you to send a telegram
to the White House.

1281
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,197
- Oh, my God.
- By midnight tonight...

1282
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,075
I want a million telegrams
in the White House!

1283
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:26,287
I want them wading knee-deep
in telegrams at the White House.

1284
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:30,792
I want you to get up right now and
write a telegram to President Ford...

1285
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:35,630
saying "I'm as mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!

1286
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,883
I don't want the banks
selling my country to the Arabs!

1287
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:42,345
I want the CCA deal stopped now!"

1288
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:45,056
I want the CCA deal stopped now!

1289
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:49,060
Come on. I want the CCA deal
stopped now!

1290
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,919
- Could we have the room?
- Sure.

1291
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:27,390
I'd like to see a typed script
and run through a couple more times.

1292
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:30,352
But as for this whole CCA deal...

1293
01:28:30,393 --> 01:28:33,772
with the Saudis, you know a lot more
about that, Frank, than I would.

1294
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:35,815
Is it true?

1295
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:43,656
The CCA has two billion in loans
with the Saudis...

1296
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,659
and they hold
every pledge we've got.

1297
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:50,747
We need that Saudi money bad.

1298
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,418
The show is a disaster.

1299
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,382
Unmitigated disaster!
The death knell.

1300
01:29:01,549 --> 01:29:05,011
I'm ruined. I'm dead.
I'm finished.

1301
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:09,891
Maybe we're overstating Beale's clout
with the public.

1302
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:13,770
An hour ago, Clarence McElheny
called me from New York.

1303
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:15,772
It was 10:00 in the East...

1304
01:29:15,855 --> 01:29:20,360
and our people in the White House report
they were knee-deep in telegrams.

1305
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:25,198
By tomorrow morning,
they'll be suffocating in telegrams!

1306
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:27,242
Can the government stop the deal?

1307
01:29:27,325 --> 01:29:31,871
They can hold it up. The SEC could hold
it up for 20 years if they wanted to.

1308
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:33,415
I'm finished.

1309
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:36,209
Any second that phone's gonna ring,
and Clarence McElheny...

1310
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:40,046
is gonna tell me Mr. Jensen wants me
in his office tomorrow morning...

1311
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:43,216
so he can personally chop my head off!

1312
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,678
Four hours ago,
I was the sun god at CCA...

1313
01:29:46,761 --> 01:29:49,973
Mr. Jensen's handpicked golden boy,
the heir apparent.

1314
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:55,145
Now, I'm a man
without a corporation.

1315
01:29:56,646 --> 01:29:59,649
Let's get back to Howard Beale.

1316
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:03,069
You're not seriously gonna pull
Beale off the air.

1317
01:30:07,615 --> 01:30:11,703
Mr. Jensen's unhappy with Howard Beale
and wants him discontinued.

1318
01:30:11,786 --> 01:30:14,039
He may be unhappy,
but he isn't stupid enough...

1319
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:16,958
to withdraw the number one show
on television out of pique.

1320
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,587
Two billion dollars isn't pique!
That's the wrath of God!

1321
01:30:20,628 --> 01:30:22,630
And the wrath of God wants
Howard Beale fired!

1322
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:27,886
What for? Every other network will grab
him. He'll be on the air for ABC.

1323
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:30,805
I'm gonna impale the son of a bitch
with a sharp stick through the heart.

1324
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:32,891
We'll lose $40 million in revenues.

1325
01:30:32,974 --> 01:30:36,895
I'll take a contract out on him.
I'll hire professional killers.

1326
01:30:36,978 --> 01:30:39,064
No, I'll do it myself.

1327
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:44,611
I'll strangle him with a sash cord.
Jesus!

1328
01:30:44,694 --> 01:30:46,905
I don't think Jensen's
gonna fire anybody.

1329
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:58,917
Yes, Clarence.
I've already booked my flight.

1330
01:31:01,294 --> 01:31:04,130
Can you give me a little more time
than that? I've got the red-eye flight.

1331
01:31:04,172 --> 01:31:07,717
I won't be back in New York
till 6:00 tomorrow morning.

1332
01:31:10,428 --> 01:31:12,597
That'll be just fine.

1333
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:14,724
I'll see you then.

1334
01:31:22,732 --> 01:31:26,695
Mr. Jensen wants to meet
with Howard Beale personally.

1335
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:30,448
He wants Mr. Beale in his office
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1336
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:39,833
The final revelation is at hand!

1337
01:31:39,874 --> 01:31:44,045
I have seen the shattering
vulgarizations of ultimate clarity.

1338
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:48,633
The light is impending.
I bear witness to the light!

1339
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:12,824
Good morning, Mr. Beale.
They tell me you're a madman.

1340
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:14,451
Only desultorily.

1341
01:32:14,534 --> 01:32:16,786
- How are you now?
- I'm as mad as a hatter.

1342
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,288
Who isn't?

1343
01:32:19,372 --> 01:32:21,291
I'm taking you into
our conference room.

1344
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:24,711
Seems more seemly a setting
for what I have to say to you.

1345
01:32:26,129 --> 01:32:28,882
I started as a salesman.

1346
01:32:28,923 --> 01:32:31,885
I sold sewing machines,
automobile parts...

1347
01:32:31,926 --> 01:32:34,763
hair brushes
and electronic equipment.

1348
01:32:34,846 --> 01:32:38,016
They say I can sell anything.

1349
01:32:38,099 --> 01:32:41,144
I'd like to try
to sell something to you.

1350
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:46,733
Valhalla, Mr. Beale.

1351
01:32:46,816 --> 01:32:48,777
Please sit down.

1352
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:22,936
You have meddled with the primal forces
of nature, Mr. Beale...

1353
01:33:23,019 --> 01:33:25,063
and I won't have it!

1354
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:27,273
Is that clear?

1355
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:30,026
You think you merely stopped
a business deal.

1356
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,070
That is not the case.

1357
01:33:32,153 --> 01:33:34,614
The Arabs have taken billions of dollars
out of this country...

1358
01:33:34,698 --> 01:33:37,033
and now they must put it back!

1359
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:42,205
It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity.
It is ecological balance!

1360
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:45,667
You are an old man...

1361
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:49,546
who thinks in terms
of nations and peoples.

1362
01:33:49,629 --> 01:33:52,132
There are no nations.
There are no peoples.

1363
01:33:52,215 --> 01:33:54,384
There are no Russians.
There are no Arabs.

1364
01:33:54,467 --> 01:33:57,137
There are no Third Worlds.
There is no West.

1365
01:33:57,178 --> 01:34:02,350
There is only one holistic system
of systems!

1366
01:34:02,434 --> 01:34:06,688
One vast and immane,
interwoven, interacting...

1367
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:11,067
multi-variant, multinational
dominion of dollars!

1368
01:34:11,151 --> 01:34:14,320
Petrol dollars, electro dollars,
multi-dollars.

1369
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:19,409
Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds
and shekels!

1370
01:34:21,536 --> 01:34:24,414
It is the international system
of currency...

1371
01:34:24,497 --> 01:34:29,502
which determines the totality
of life on this planet.

1372
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:34,924
That is the natural order
of things today.

1373
01:34:35,925 --> 01:34:39,971
That is the atomic...

1374
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:42,182
and subatomic...

1375
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:46,603
and galactic structure
of things today.

1376
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:50,690
And you have meddled...

1377
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:54,361
with the primal forces of nature!

1378
01:34:55,570 --> 01:35:00,158
And you will atone!

1379
01:35:01,242 --> 01:35:03,244
Am I getting through to you?

1380
01:35:07,415 --> 01:35:11,378
You get up on
your little 21-inch screen...

1381
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:17,050
and howl about America
and democracy.

1382
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:20,178
There is no America.

1383
01:35:20,261 --> 01:35:22,639
There is no democracy.

1384
01:35:22,722 --> 01:35:26,601
There is only IBM and ITT...

1385
01:35:26,643 --> 01:35:28,311
and AT&T...

1386
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:32,357
and Du Pont, Dow, Union Carbide...

1387
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,983
and Exxon.

1388
01:35:34,067 --> 01:35:37,696
Those are the nations
of the world today.

1389
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:40,573
What do you think the Russians
talk about in their councils of state?

1390
01:35:40,657 --> 01:35:42,242
Karl Marx?

1391
01:35:42,283 --> 01:35:44,869
They get out their
linear programming charts...

1392
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:47,914
statistical decision theories,
minimax solutions and compute...

1393
01:35:47,997 --> 01:35:52,168
price-cost probabilities of their
transactions and investments like we do.

1394
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:57,173
We no longer live in a world
of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale.

1395
01:35:57,257 --> 01:35:59,426
The world...

1396
01:35:59,509 --> 01:36:02,429
is a college of corporations...

1397
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:05,390
inexorably determined...

1398
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:08,768
by the immutable bylaws
of business.

1399
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:14,399
The world is a business.

1400
01:36:16,234 --> 01:36:20,530
It has been since man
crawled out of the slime.

1401
01:36:23,074 --> 01:36:27,495
And our children will live,
Mr. Beale...

1402
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:31,291
to see that...

1403
01:36:33,335 --> 01:36:35,378
perfect world...

1404
01:36:36,963 --> 01:36:40,300
in which there's no war or famine...

1405
01:36:40,383 --> 01:36:42,886
oppression or brutality.

1406
01:36:44,804 --> 01:36:48,808
One vast and ecumenical
holding company...

1407
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:53,229
for whom all men will work to serve
a common profit...

1408
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:58,693
in which all men will hold
a share of stock...

1409
01:36:58,777 --> 01:37:01,196
all necessities provided...

1410
01:37:02,405 --> 01:37:05,909
all anxieties tranquilized...

1411
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:10,830
all boredom amused.

1412
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:22,008
And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale...

1413
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,844
to preach this evangel.

1414
01:37:24,928 --> 01:37:26,680
Why me?

1415
01:37:27,889 --> 01:37:30,517
Because you're on television, dummy!

1416
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:33,895
Sixty million people watch you...

1417
01:37:33,978 --> 01:37:36,815
every night of the week,
Monday through Friday.

1418
01:37:38,024 --> 01:37:40,318
I have seen the face of God.

1419
01:37:42,904 --> 01:37:45,156
You just might be right, Mr. Beale.

1420
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:49,202
That evening Howard Beale
went on the air...

1421
01:37:49,244 --> 01:37:52,539
to preach the corporate cosmology
of Arthur Jensen.

1422
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:57,210
Last night I got up here and asked you
to fight for your heritage...

1423
01:37:57,293 --> 01:37:59,713
and you did,
and it was beautiful.

1424
01:37:59,754 --> 01:38:02,799
Six million telegrams were received
at the White House.

1425
01:38:02,882 --> 01:38:06,219
The Arab takeover of CCA
has been stopped.

1426
01:38:06,261 --> 01:38:08,430
The people spoke, the people won.

1427
01:38:08,513 --> 01:38:11,307
It was a radiant eruption
of democracy.

1428
01:38:12,392 --> 01:38:16,354
But I think that was it, fellas.

1429
01:38:16,438 --> 01:38:19,065
That sort of thing is not likely
to happen again...

1430
01:38:19,149 --> 01:38:22,193
because at the bottom
of all our terrified souls...

1431
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:25,113
we know that democracy
is a dying giant...

1432
01:38:25,196 --> 01:38:28,408
a sick, sick, dying,
decaying political concept...

1433
01:38:28,491 --> 01:38:30,452
writhing in its final pain.

1434
01:38:30,493 --> 01:38:34,247
I don't mean that the United States
is finished as a world power.

1435
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:37,500
The U. S is the richest,
most advanced country in the world...

1436
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,627
light-years ahead
of any other country...

1437
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:43,631
and the Communists won't take over the
world because they're deader than we.

1438
01:38:43,673 --> 01:38:45,717
What is finished...

1439
01:38:47,302 --> 01:38:49,596
is the idea that this great country...

1440
01:38:49,637 --> 01:38:55,101
is dedicated to the freedom and
flourishing of every individual in it.

1441
01:38:56,186 --> 01:38:59,356
It's the individual that's finished.

1442
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:03,276
It's the single, solitary human being
that's finished.

1443
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:08,865
It's every single one of you
out there that's finished.

1444
01:39:08,948 --> 01:39:13,995
Because this is no longer a nation
of independent individuals.

1445
01:39:15,163 --> 01:39:20,627
It's a nation of some 200 million
transistorized, deodorized...

1446
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:23,463
whiter-than-white,
steel-belted bodies...

1447
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:26,508
totally unnecessary
as human beings...

1448
01:39:26,549 --> 01:39:29,719
and as replaceable as piston rods.

1449
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:43,900
Well, the time has come to say...

1450
01:39:43,983 --> 01:39:47,404
is "dehumanization"
such a bad word?

1451
01:39:47,487 --> 01:39:50,657
Whether it's good or bad,
that's what is so.

1452
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:53,118
The whole world
is becoming humanoid...

1453
01:39:53,201 --> 01:39:56,329
creatures that look human
but aren't.

1454
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:58,331
The whole world, not just us.

1455
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:01,751
We're just the most advanced,
so we're getting there first.

1456
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:07,007
The whole world's people
are becoming mass-produced...

1457
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:10,051
programmed, numbered and...

1458
01:40:10,093 --> 01:40:12,178
It was an admissible argument
that Howard Beale...

1459
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:14,723
advanced in the days that followed.

1460
01:40:14,764 --> 01:40:18,018
It was, however,
also a very depressing one.

1461
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:21,396
Nobody particularly cared to hear
his life was utterly valueless.

1462
01:40:21,479 --> 01:40:23,440
By the end of the first week
in June...

1463
01:40:23,523 --> 01:40:25,442
the show dropped
one ratings point...

1464
01:40:25,525 --> 01:40:28,987
and its trend of shares
dipped under 48 for the first time...

1465
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:30,822
since last November.

1466
01:40:30,905 --> 01:40:32,866
You're his goddamn agent, Lou!

1467
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:35,118
I'm counting on you to talk sense
into the lunatic!

1468
01:40:35,201 --> 01:40:38,121
Nobody wants to hear about
dying democracy and dehumanization!

1469
01:40:39,581 --> 01:40:41,958
I'm sorry I'm late.

1470
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:45,628
We're getting rumbles from the agencies.
The sponsors will bail out soon!

1471
01:40:45,712 --> 01:40:47,881
This is a breach of contract!

1472
01:40:47,964 --> 01:40:51,509
This isn't the Howard Beale we signed.
Get him off the corporate universe kick.

1473
01:40:51,593 --> 01:40:53,762
I'll pull him off the air!

1474
01:40:53,845 --> 01:40:56,890
I told him! I've been telling him
every day for a week!

1475
01:40:56,973 --> 01:41:00,352
I am sick of telling him!
Now you tell him!

1476
01:41:07,776 --> 01:41:09,652
Jesus Christ!

1477
01:41:13,365 --> 01:41:17,952
You could help me with Howard. He
listens to you. You're his best friend.

1478
01:41:18,036 --> 01:41:20,455
I'm tired of all this hysteria
about Howard Beale!

1479
01:41:20,538 --> 01:41:23,124
Every time you come back from seeing
somebody in your family...

1480
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:25,502
you're in a morbid,
middle-aged mood!

1481
01:41:25,585 --> 01:41:28,922
And I'm tired of finding you on the
goddamn phone every time I turn around!

1482
01:41:28,963 --> 01:41:32,342
I'm tired of being an accessory
in your life!

1483
01:41:32,425 --> 01:41:34,803
I'm tired of pretending
to write this dumb book...

1484
01:41:34,886 --> 01:41:38,431
about my maverick days
in the early years of television.

1485
01:41:38,515 --> 01:41:42,268
Every goddamned executive fired
from a network in the last 20 years...

1486
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:46,481
has written this dumb book about
the great early years of television!

1487
01:41:46,564 --> 01:41:49,943
And nobody wants a dumb, damn,
goddamn book...

1488
01:41:50,026 --> 01:41:52,195
about the early days of television!

1489
01:41:52,278 --> 01:41:55,240
Terrific. Maybe you can start
a whole new career as an actor!

1490
01:41:58,118 --> 01:42:02,706
After living with you for six months,
I'm turning into one of your scripts!

1491
01:42:03,707 --> 01:42:06,418
This is not a script.

1492
01:42:06,501 --> 01:42:09,796
There's some real, actual life
going on here.

1493
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,384
I went to visit my wife today
because she's in a state of depression...

1494
01:42:14,467 --> 01:42:18,138
so depressed that my daughter
flew from Seattle to be with her...

1495
01:42:18,179 --> 01:42:20,515
and I feel lousy about that.

1496
01:42:20,598 --> 01:42:24,686
I feel lousy about the pain
that I've caused my wife and kids.

1497
01:42:24,769 --> 01:42:29,441
I feel guilty and conscious-stricken and
those things you think sentimental...

1498
01:42:29,524 --> 01:42:33,695
but which my generation called
simple human decency.

1499
01:42:37,782 --> 01:42:40,493
And I miss my home...

1500
01:42:40,535 --> 01:42:43,413
because I'm beginning
to get scared shitless.

1501
01:42:43,496 --> 01:42:46,750
Because all of a sudden it's closer to
the end than it is to the beginning...

1502
01:42:46,833 --> 01:42:50,086
and death is suddenly
a perceptible thing to me...

1503
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:52,714
with definable features.

1504
01:42:56,634 --> 01:43:01,473
You're dealing with a man
that has primal doubts...

1505
01:43:01,556 --> 01:43:04,392
and you've got to cope with it.

1506
01:43:04,476 --> 01:43:09,356
I'm not some guy discussing male
menopause on the "Barbara Walters Show. "

1507
01:43:09,397 --> 01:43:12,650
I'm the man that you presumably love.

1508
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:16,780
I'm part of your life.

1509
01:43:16,863 --> 01:43:18,698
I live here.

1510
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:20,283
I'm real!

1511
01:43:21,326 --> 01:43:24,579
You can't switch
to another station.

1512
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:30,460
Well...

1513
01:43:32,003 --> 01:43:34,798
what exactly is it
you want me to do?

1514
01:43:38,802 --> 01:43:41,680
I just want you to love me.

1515
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:46,559
I just want you to love me,
primal doubts and all.

1516
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:51,564
You understand that, don't you?

1517
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,613
I don't know how to do that.

1518
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:13,003
I'll be with you in a minute, Max.

1519
01:44:18,258 --> 01:44:21,845
By the first week in July, the
"Howard Beale Show" was down 11 points.

1520
01:44:21,928 --> 01:44:23,888
Hysteria swept through the network.

1521
01:44:23,972 --> 01:44:27,017
He's a plague! He's smallpox!
He's typhoid!

1522
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,894
I don't want to follow his goddamn show!
I want out of the 8:00 spot.

1523
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:32,480
I've got enough troubles
without Howard Beale as a lead-in.

1524
01:44:32,564 --> 01:44:34,774
You guys scheduled me up against
"Tony Orlando and Dawn"!

1525
01:44:34,858 --> 01:44:38,445
NBC's got "Little House on the Prairie. "
ABC's got "The Bionic Woman. "

1526
01:44:38,486 --> 01:44:41,364
You gotta do something
about Howard Beale!

1527
01:44:41,448 --> 01:44:43,616
Get him off the air!
Get him off!

1528
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:45,785
Do something! Do anything!

1529
01:44:45,869 --> 01:44:49,748
We're trying to find a replacement! I'm
going to look at audition footage now!

1530
01:44:49,831 --> 01:44:53,460
And how when the sick heal!

1531
01:44:53,543 --> 01:44:56,546
Man, I tell you I saw it!

1532
01:44:56,629 --> 01:45:00,175
It was heavy, baby.

1533
01:45:00,258 --> 01:45:02,510
I saw the earth quake...

1534
01:45:02,594 --> 01:45:06,514
and I saw the moon became like blood.

1535
01:45:06,598 --> 01:45:10,810
And every mountain and island
was moved from its place.

1536
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:14,898
No, no, damn it! If we wanted hell-fire,
we'd get Billy Graham!

1537
01:45:14,981 --> 01:45:18,568
We don't want faith healers, evangelists
or Oberammergau passion players!

1538
01:45:18,651 --> 01:45:22,989
What about that terrific new messiah
ABC was to sign for our competition?

1539
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:25,492
That's him.

1540
01:45:27,535 --> 01:45:30,163
That's him?

1541
01:45:31,539 --> 01:45:33,458
Jesus. Turn him off!

1542
01:45:34,626 --> 01:45:38,254
I've got three more,
but you've already seen the best ones.

1543
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:40,298
I've got a guru from Spokane...

1544
01:45:40,382 --> 01:45:43,176
and two more hell-fires
who see visions of the Virgin Mary.

1545
01:45:43,259 --> 01:45:47,222
We're not gonna find a replacement
for Beale. Let's stop kidding ourselves.

1546
01:45:47,263 --> 01:45:50,350
Fully-fledged messiahs
don't come in bunches.

1547
01:45:50,433 --> 01:45:53,645
We either go with Howard Beale
or we go without him.

1548
01:45:53,728 --> 01:45:56,648
My reports say we'll do better
without him.

1549
01:45:56,731 --> 01:45:59,651
It would be disaster to let
this situation go on another week.

1550
01:45:59,734 --> 01:46:02,445
By then he'll be down 16 points...

1551
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:05,323
and the trend irreversible,
if it isn't already.

1552
01:46:07,242 --> 01:46:10,286
I think we should fire Howard.

1553
01:46:12,956 --> 01:46:16,418
Arthur Jensen has taken
a strong personal interest...

1554
01:46:16,459 --> 01:46:18,461
in the "Howard Beale Show. "

1555
01:46:20,714 --> 01:46:22,674
I'm having dinner with him tonight.

1556
01:46:22,757 --> 01:46:26,678
Let me have another crack at Jensen.
Meet in my office at 10:00 tonight.

1557
01:46:26,761 --> 01:46:29,556
Diana, give me copies of all
your audience research reports.

1558
01:46:29,597 --> 01:46:31,766
I may need them for Jensen.

1559
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:34,102
Is 10:00 convenient for everyone?

1560
01:47:05,508 --> 01:47:09,971
I think the time has come
to reevaluate our relationship, Max.

1561
01:47:11,056 --> 01:47:12,849
So I see.

1562
01:47:14,559 --> 01:47:16,978
I don't like the way this script of ours
is turning out.

1563
01:47:18,104 --> 01:47:20,732
It's turning into a seedy little drama.

1564
01:47:20,815 --> 01:47:25,236
Middle-aged man leaves wife and family
for young, heartless woman, goes to pot.

1565
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:28,239
"The Blue Angel" with Marlene Dietrich
and Emil Jannings.

1566
01:47:28,323 --> 01:47:31,034
- I don't like it.
- So you're gonna cancel the show.

1567
01:47:31,117 --> 01:47:33,370
- Right.
- Let me do that.

1568
01:47:34,996 --> 01:47:37,832
The simple fact is, Max...

1569
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:40,251
that you're a family man.

1570
01:47:40,335 --> 01:47:43,838
It's beautiful you like a home and kids,
but I am incapable of such commitment.

1571
01:47:43,922 --> 01:47:46,466
All you'll get from me is another
couple of months of intermittent sex...

1572
01:47:46,549 --> 01:47:50,428
and recriminate and ugly little scenes
like the one we had last night.

1573
01:47:50,512 --> 01:47:54,474
I'm sorry for all those things
I said to you last night.

1574
01:47:54,557 --> 01:47:56,976
You're not the worst fuck
I've ever had.

1575
01:47:57,018 --> 01:47:59,437
Believe me, I've had worse.

1576
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:04,901
You don't puff or snorkel
and make death-like rattles.

1577
01:48:04,984 --> 01:48:07,445
As a matter of fact,
you're rather serene in the sack.

1578
01:48:08,988 --> 01:48:11,908
Why is it that a woman always thinks
that the most savage thing...

1579
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:15,829
she can say to a man
is to impugn his cocksmanship?

1580
01:48:16,913 --> 01:48:20,750
I'm sorry I impugned your cocksmanship.

1581
01:48:20,834 --> 01:48:25,380
I gave up comparing genitals
back in the schoolyard.

1582
01:48:34,848 --> 01:48:37,600
You're being docile as hell
about this.

1583
01:48:38,643 --> 01:48:41,730
Hell, Diana, I knew it was over
with us weeks ago.

1584
01:48:42,772 --> 01:48:45,525
Will you go back to your wife?

1585
01:48:47,193 --> 01:48:49,988
I'll give it a try,
but I don't think she'll jump at it.

1586
01:48:50,071 --> 01:48:52,032
Don't worry about me.

1587
01:48:52,073 --> 01:48:54,743
I'll manage. I always have,
I always will.

1588
01:48:54,826 --> 01:48:56,870
I'm more concerned about you.

1589
01:48:56,953 --> 01:48:59,456
You're not the boozer type.

1590
01:48:59,539 --> 01:49:03,501
So I figure a year, maybe two,
before you crack up...

1591
01:49:03,585 --> 01:49:06,171
or jump out of
your 14th floor office window.

1592
01:49:06,254 --> 01:49:09,382
Stop selling, Max.
I don't need you.

1593
01:49:21,061 --> 01:49:24,731
I don't want your pain! I don't want
your menopausal decay and death!

1594
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:27,108
- I don't need you, Max! Get out!
- You need me!

1595
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:32,989
You need me badly! Because I'm
your last contact with human reality.

1596
01:49:33,073 --> 01:49:35,158
I love you!

1597
01:49:35,241 --> 01:49:39,120
And that painful, decaying love
is the only thing between you...

1598
01:49:39,204 --> 01:49:41,998
and the shrieking nothingness
you live the rest of the day.

1599
01:49:42,082 --> 01:49:44,000
Then don't leave me.

1600
01:49:47,045 --> 01:49:48,963
It's too late.

1601
01:49:50,215 --> 01:49:52,550
There's nothing left in you
that I can live with.

1602
01:49:55,887 --> 01:50:00,475
You're one of Howard's humanoids.
If I stay with you, I'll be destroyed.

1603
01:50:02,227 --> 01:50:05,146
Like Howard Beale was destroyed.

1604
01:50:05,188 --> 01:50:08,441
Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed.

1605
01:50:08,525 --> 01:50:13,697
Like everything you and the institution
of television touch is destroyed.

1606
01:50:20,161 --> 01:50:22,247
You're television incarnate.

1607
01:50:23,832 --> 01:50:26,084
Indifferent to suffering...

1608
01:50:26,876 --> 01:50:29,004
insensitive to joy.

1609
01:50:30,505 --> 01:50:34,342
All of life is reduced
to the common rubble of banality.

1610
01:50:38,013 --> 01:50:40,473
War, murder, death...

1611
01:50:41,725 --> 01:50:44,602
are all the same to you
as bottles of beer.

1612
01:50:45,645 --> 01:50:49,607
And the daily business of life
is a corrupt comedy.

1613
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:54,696
You even shatter the sensations
of time and space...

1614
01:50:54,779 --> 01:50:59,284
into split seconds
and instant replays.

1615
01:51:03,079 --> 01:51:05,040
You're madness, Diana.

1616
01:51:06,875 --> 01:51:08,793
Virulent madness.

1617
01:51:11,296 --> 01:51:14,341
And everything you touch
dies with you.

1618
01:51:18,887 --> 01:51:21,723
But not me.

1619
01:51:21,806 --> 01:51:24,309
Not as long as I can feel pleasure...

1620
01:51:25,643 --> 01:51:27,228
and pain...

1621
01:51:31,316 --> 01:51:32,817
and love.

1622
01:51:44,162 --> 01:51:46,373
And it's a happy ending.

1623
01:51:47,749 --> 01:51:51,461
Wayward husband
comes to his senses...

1624
01:51:51,544 --> 01:51:53,713
returns to his wife...

1625
01:51:53,755 --> 01:51:56,758
with whom he's established
a long and sustaining love.

1626
01:51:58,093 --> 01:52:01,971
Heartless young woman left alone
in her arctic desolation.

1627
01:52:05,141 --> 01:52:07,143
Music up with a swell.

1628
01:52:10,188 --> 01:52:11,898
Final commercial.

1629
01:52:14,734 --> 01:52:18,196
And here are a few scenes
from next week's show.

1630
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:32,252
How'd it go?

1631
01:52:48,768 --> 01:52:53,440
Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea
of taking Howard Beale off the air.

1632
01:52:54,774 --> 01:52:56,943
Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale
is bringing...

1633
01:52:57,027 --> 01:53:00,822
a very important message
to the American people.

1634
01:53:03,116 --> 01:53:06,494
So he wants Howard Beale on the air,
and he wants him kept on.

1635
01:53:08,663 --> 01:53:11,958
Mr. Jensen feels we're too catastrophic
in our thinking.

1636
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,502
I argued that television
was a volatile industry...

1637
01:53:14,586 --> 01:53:18,423
in which success and failure
were determined week by week.

1638
01:53:19,466 --> 01:53:22,344
Mr. Jensen said he did not like
volatile industries...

1639
01:53:22,427 --> 01:53:26,139
and suggested with a certain
sinister silkiness...

1640
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:31,227
that volatility in business
usually reflected bad management.

1641
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:35,482
He didn't really care if Howard Beale
was the number one show or the 50th.

1642
01:53:35,565 --> 01:53:38,068
He didn't really care
if the Beale show lost money.

1643
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:41,780
He wants Howard Beale on the air...

1644
01:53:41,863 --> 01:53:44,115
and he wants him kept on.

1645
01:53:44,157 --> 01:53:48,286
I would describe his position on this
as inflexible.

1646
01:53:50,205 --> 01:53:52,165
Where does that put us, Diana?

1647
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:56,836
That puts us in the shithouse.
That's where that puts us.

1648
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:02,509
Do you want me to go through this?

1649
01:54:03,635 --> 01:54:07,430
The Beale show Q score
is down to 33.

1650
01:54:08,515 --> 01:54:12,060
Most of this loss occurred in the child
and teen and 18-34 categories...

1651
01:54:12,143 --> 01:54:14,979
which were our key core markets.

1652
01:54:16,147 --> 01:54:18,817
It's the AR department's carefully
considered judgment, and mine...

1653
01:54:18,858 --> 01:54:23,488
that if we get rid of Beale, we should
maintain a respectable share...

1654
01:54:23,571 --> 01:54:25,782
with a comparable Q level.

1655
01:54:25,865 --> 01:54:29,327
The other show segments, Sybil the
Soothsayer, Jim Webbing, Vox Populi...

1656
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:32,497
have all developed
their own audiences.

1657
01:54:32,539 --> 01:54:37,127
Our AR reports show that it is Beale
that is the destructive force here.

1658
01:54:38,336 --> 01:54:40,714
Minimally, we're talking about...

1659
01:54:40,755 --> 01:54:43,758
a ten-point differential in shares.

1660
01:54:43,842 --> 01:54:45,802
I think Joe oughta spell it out
for us.

1661
01:54:47,804 --> 01:54:50,890
A 28 share
is 80,000 dollar minutes.

1662
01:54:50,974 --> 01:54:53,685
I think we can sell complete positions
on the whole.

1663
01:54:53,727 --> 01:54:56,438
As a matter of fact, we're just getting
into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers...

1664
01:54:56,521 --> 01:55:00,108
and the agencies are coming back to me
with four-dollar CPMs.

1665
01:55:00,191 --> 01:55:05,196
If that's any indication, we're talking
$40-$45 million loss in annual revenues.

1666
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:08,533
- Want the flak from the affiliates?
- We know all about it, Herb.

1667
01:55:08,575 --> 01:55:12,328
You would describe Mr. Jensen's position
on Beale as inflexible?

1668
01:55:12,412 --> 01:55:15,290
Intractable and adamantine.

1669
01:55:17,167 --> 01:55:20,378
What do we do about this Beale
son of a bitch?

1670
01:55:22,547 --> 01:55:24,799
I suppose we'll have to kill him.

1671
01:55:27,677 --> 01:55:30,638
I don't suppose you have any ideas
on that, Diana?

1672
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:35,560
Well...

1673
01:55:37,437 --> 01:55:40,106
what would you fellas say
to an assassination?

1674
01:55:42,025 --> 01:55:44,569
I think I can get
the Mao Tse-tung people...

1675
01:55:44,652 --> 01:55:47,238
to kill Beale for us
as one of their shows.

1676
01:55:48,365 --> 01:55:53,036
In fact, it'll make a hell of
a kick-off show for the season.

1677
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:56,039
We're facing heavy opposition on the
other networks for Wednesday nights...

1678
01:55:56,122 --> 01:55:59,584
and the "Mao Tse-tung Hour"
could use a sensational opener.

1679
01:56:01,795 --> 01:56:05,423
It could be done right on camera
in the studio.

1680
01:56:07,092 --> 01:56:09,302
We oughta get a fantastic
look-in audience...

1681
01:56:09,386 --> 01:56:12,514
for the assassination of Howard Beale
as our opening show.

1682
01:56:13,598 --> 01:56:16,309
If Beale dies...

1683
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:20,438
what would our continuing obligation
to the Beale Corporation be?

1684
01:56:20,522 --> 01:56:23,608
I know our contract with Beale
contains a buy-out clause...

1685
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:25,860
triggered by his death
or incapacity.

1686
01:56:25,944 --> 01:56:29,364
There must be a formula for
the computation of the purchase price.

1687
01:56:29,447 --> 01:56:33,451
Offhand, I think it was based on
a multiple of 1975 earnings...

1688
01:56:33,493 --> 01:56:37,330
with a base period in 1975,
which I think was 50 percent...

1689
01:56:37,372 --> 01:56:40,208
of salary, plus 25 percent
of the first year's profit...

1690
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:43,420
multiplied by the unexpired portion
of the contract.

1691
01:56:43,503 --> 01:56:45,380
I don't think the show...

1692
01:56:45,463 --> 01:56:48,008
has any substantial syndication value,
would you say, Diana?

1693
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:50,051
Syndication profits are minimal.

1694
01:56:51,219 --> 01:56:54,014
We're talking about a capital crime.

1695
01:56:55,056 --> 01:56:57,851
The network can't be implicated.

1696
01:57:08,194 --> 01:57:12,407
I hope you don't have any hidden
tape machines in this office, Frank.

1697
01:57:14,534 --> 01:57:17,495
The issue is,
shall we kill Howard Beale or not?

1698
01:57:17,579 --> 01:57:20,165
I'd like to hear
some more opinions on that.

1699
01:57:20,248 --> 01:57:23,710
I don't see we have any option.
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

1700
01:57:23,793 --> 01:57:25,462
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it!

1701
01:57:25,545 --> 01:57:27,255
How do you feel?

1702
01:57:27,339 --> 01:57:29,007
We're mad as hell...

1703
01:57:29,049 --> 01:57:31,801
and we're not gonna
take this anymore!

1704
01:57:31,885 --> 01:57:35,638
Ladies and gentlemen, the "Network
News Hour" with Sybil the Soothsayer...

1705
01:57:39,225 --> 01:57:43,563
Jim Webbing and his
It's-the-Emmes-Truth Department.

1706
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:49,986
Miss Mata Hari
and her skeletons in the closet.

1707
01:57:52,405 --> 01:57:54,699
Tonight another segment
of "Vox Populi. "

1708
01:57:59,496 --> 01:58:03,875
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

1709
01:58:23,436 --> 01:58:27,857
...network news anchorman
on the UBS "Network News Show"...

1710
01:58:27,941 --> 01:58:31,903
known to millions
as the Mad Profit of the Airwaves...

1711
01:58:31,945 --> 01:58:35,740
was shot to death tonight in
a fusillade of automatic rifle fire...

1712
01:58:35,782 --> 01:58:38,034
just as he began
this evening's broadcast.

1713
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:41,579
We never compromise,
so why should you?

1714
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:45,041
Canada Dry Mixers.
Why compromise?

1715
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:48,753
Have you seen the other side
of where you live?

1716
01:58:48,795 --> 01:58:52,632
- What's this stuff?
- Some cereal. It's good for you.

1717
01:58:52,716 --> 01:58:55,635
- Did you try it?
- I'm not gonna try it. You try it.

1718
01:58:55,677 --> 01:58:58,138
I'm not gonna try it.

1719
01:58:58,221 --> 01:59:00,223
- Let's get Mikey to try it!
- Yeah!

1720
01:59:00,306 --> 01:59:02,267
He won't eat it.
He hates everything.

1721
01:59:02,308 --> 01:59:06,271
The extraordinary incident occurred in
full view of his millions of viewers.

1722
01:59:06,354 --> 01:59:10,817
The assassins were members of
the Ecumenical Liberation Army...

1723
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:12,986
two of whom were apprehended.

1724
01:59:13,069 --> 01:59:16,948
The leader of the group known
as the Great Ahmed Khan escaped.

1725
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:19,492
This was the story of Howard Beale...

1726
01:59:19,534 --> 01:59:23,830
the first known instance of a man who
was killed because he had lousy ratings.
