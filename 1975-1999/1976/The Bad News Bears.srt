<i>(Man) Pull that in there.</i>

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,818
Right back to home. Let's move it.

4
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,753
<i>(Boy) Yeah, not bad, not bad.</i>

5
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,622
<i>(Man) Okay, let's go for two now.</i>

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,960
<i>Okay, go for the bunt.</i>

7
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,695
<i>Everybody stay alive.</i>

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,763

20 sit-ups.</i>

12
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,747
<i>Come on. Hit the deck.</i>

13
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:55,287

<i>(Man) That's what I want.

<i>Hey, alive out there!</i>

31
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:54,279
<i>Go!</i>

32
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,465
<i>(Boy) Hey, way to go, Chris!</i>

<i>(Clink)</i>

34
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,975
Thanks, mister.

35
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,031
<i>(Motorcycle starts)</i>

36
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,587
Get it in there!

37
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,123
Come on, fellas!

38
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,707
Talk it up!

39
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,813
<i>I'm going to go around the infield,</i>

40
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,180
<i>then around the outfield.</i>

41
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,649
You got it? Okay.

42
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,951
<i>Move! Charge the ball!</i>

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,520
<i>Let's go! Fire it in there!</i>

44
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,122
<i>Around the infield now!</i>

45
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,709
We'll do it around the infield,
then around the outfield.

46
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,143
<i>(Man) Hey, Buttermaker.</i>

47
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,865
<i>I had three pools to clean.</i>

48
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,868
- Uh, you know my son Toby, right?
- Hi, Buttermaker.

49
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,638
This little guy is going
to be a great ballplayer.

50
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,406
I really appreciate this.

51
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,109
It's a shame that none of the fathers
have the time for it.

52
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,278
If I wasn't so busy
down at city hall--

53
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,781
- You got my check, Whitewood?
- Check?

54
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,885
Uh, son, why don't you
get your bike off the car?

55
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,270
Yeah.

56
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:14,108
- Wow! I thought we were going to be quiet about the money.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

57
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:17,312
It's going to be rough, Buttermaker.
You just got one week till the first game.

58
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,581
I wanted to introduce you
to some of the administrators--

59
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,868
You forgot to sign the check.
Check is not signed.

60
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,738
Oh. Helps, right?

61
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,408
You ask around for a woman
they call Cleveland.

62
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,010
She'll get things set for you.
Here.

63
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,812
Here's a list of the boys
on the team.

64
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,947
Don't let any of these bastards
give you a hard time.

65
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,383
Put that away.

66
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,617
Hang in there.

67
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:46,557
<i>(Boy #1) How about a ride home?</i>

68
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,393
<i>(Boy #2) Race you back
to the dugout!</i>

69
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,398
You know, I think we're doing
a really fine thing.

70
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,449
Yeah.

71
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,672
Dad said you played pro ball.

72
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,874
Yeah.

73
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,609
I thought you just cleaned swimming pools.

74
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,678
Says you were really great once.

75
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,213
That's nice of him.

76
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,782
<i>(Coughing)</i>

77
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,283
<i>(Man) Hey! Hey!</i>

78
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,385
<i>Get that bike off the field!</i>

79
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,521
I said get it off the field!
You're marking it up.

80
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,006
Excuse me.

81
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:20,074
<i>Sorry he yelled at your boy.</i>

82
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,609
That's not my boy.

83
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,678
My husband's uptight about the infield.

84
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,629
He sometimes yells.

85
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:26,648
Jill, honey.

86
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:27,798
<i>Hey, Jill, honey.</i>

87
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,149
My name is Buttermaker.

88
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:31,736
<i>I'm coach of the new team.</i>

89
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,471
I'm looking for Miss Cleveland.

90
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,407
She's in the equipment room.
It's straight ahead.

91
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,277
Goddamn class-action suits are gonna
be the ruin of this country.

92
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:44,415
It wasn't so bad when the courts
made us take girls.

93
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,984
<i>At least the ones
that came could play,</i>

94
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,519
but now this.

95
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,088
This equipment's kind of had it, miss.

96
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,657
You're damn right, Mr. Buttermaker.

97
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,725
This is normally a six-team league,
not seven.

98
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,294
You're gonna have to
be happy with what's left.

99
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,898
Look, Buttermaker, the problem
is your friend whitewood.

100
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,935
He could have got those boys
in any of the other leagues.

101
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,003
Why did he sue this one?

102
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,607
We're different than the other leagues,
and he knows it.

103
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,710
We run a highly competitive
program here.

104
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,245
I mean, it's highly competitive.

105
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,930
Want to know something?

106
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:19,634
<i>It's not us.
It's the boys.</i>

107
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:22,854
It's the boys themselves
that want it that way.

108
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,540
Buttermaker, new rule book.
See that you memorize it.

109
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:33,163
You got, uh, not even an hour
to practice on that field.

110
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,466
Good luck, huh?

111
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,471
When I say your name, step forward and
tell me what position you want to play.

112
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,642
- Rudi Stein.
- Pitcher. Um, can I play p--

113
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,176
<i>Sure. Regi Tower.</i>

114
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:50,615
I got a pretty good arm. My father
said for me to play infield.

115
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,284
Mr. Buttermaker, I'm on your team.

116
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,287
- Last year, I was playing baseball--
- You really pitch a no-hitter?

117
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,890
I'm Tower...
for the first time--

118
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,892
my dad's been a Yankee fan
all his life.

119
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,462
He never heard of no Buttermaker who ever played
for the Yankees let alone pitched a no hitter!

120
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,833
- I don't know who you are, but sit down and shut up.
- Can I play second or third base?

121
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,653
The situation with the glasses is--
forget about the glasses.

122
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,072
All right, guys, let's get
one thing straight.

123
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,944
I was a heck of a ballplayer,
but I never pitched for the Yankees--

124
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,330
<i>You never played in the major leagues.</i>

125
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,882
But you did pitch for Phoenix
in the minors.

126
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,484
<i>In 1951, you won nine games,</i>

127
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,670
lost six, had 170 strikeouts,

128
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,523
and had an ERA Of 2.86.

129
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,158
Good work, kid.

130
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,177
Ahmad Abdul Raheem.

131
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:37,578
- Ahmad Abdul Raheem.
- Here.

132
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,730
What position do you want to play?

133
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,699
I want to switch hit
like my big brothers.

134
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,701
And I want to play where
Hank Aaron played.

135
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,604
- Right field. Aaron played right field.
- Then right field.

136
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,707
- He also played quite a few games on second base.
- Then second base.

137
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,911
- Mike Engelberg.
- My dad thinks I should try out for catcher.

138
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,213
He can play third and short
at the same time.

139
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,266
- Keep it up, Whitewood! If you wanna get "kung-fued."
- Oh, shut up, tubs!

140
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,420
<i>(Buttermaker) Timmy Luppus... all right,
all right, all right, all right, all right--</i>

141
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,105
- <i>Timmy Luppus.</i>
- Lupus.

142
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:09,711
Crud. Does that booger-eatin' spaz
make me want to puke.

143
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,713
What do you want to play, Luppus?

144
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,515
Lupus.

145
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,050
He's shy, coach.

146
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,019
Shy, my butt. He's an idiot.

147
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,388
Shut up, Tanner.
He's just quiet.

148
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,274
Timmy and I could do a fine job
sharing right field.

149
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,843
All right. Let's not talk
anymore about it.

150
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,612
Everybody out on the field
and take any position you want.

151
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,199
<i>We'll figure out
where you play later.</i>

152
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,701
Could Timmy and I play right field?

153
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,204
Any place at all.
Just get out there.

154
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:39,357
Just shut up and get out there.

155
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,526
<i>Let's go, boys.</i>

156
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,611
Mister, uh, Buttermaker,

157
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,115
I think my dad said something about
these two boys were Mexican.

158
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,184
They don't speak any English.

159
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,928
All right, let's get one.

160
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,157
Hey, can't you hold off of that
until after practice?

161
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,659
There's energy in chocolate.

162
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,560
I need energy.

163
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,245
Oh.

164
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,332
All right, let's get one.

165
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,537
<i>(Man) Damn it, Regi!
Attack that ball.</i>

166
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,039
<i>Pay attention out there.</i>

167
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,174
It was right at me.

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,476
Attack it!

169
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,194
All right. Get one.

170
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,404
- <i>(Buttermaker) Look alive.</i>
- <i>(Bat hits ball)</i>

171
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,199
<i>(Boy) Oh! How could you?</i>

172
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,876
<i>(Squish)</i>

173
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,677
- <i>Hey, Engelberg.</i>
- What?

174
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,847
There's chocolate all over this ball.

175
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,917
Look, Mr. Buttermaker,
quit bugging me about my food.

176
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,685
People are always bugging me about it.

177
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,420
My shrink says that's why I'm so fat.

178
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,090
You're not doing me
any good so just quit it!

179
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,827
Okay, okay, okay.

180
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,569
All right, look alive.
Let's get one.

181
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,738
Are you ready?
Let's get one out there.

182
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,344
- Engelberg?
- What?

183
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,413
That is a bunt--
B-U-N-T.

184
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:45,483
The catcher is supposed
to pick up the bunt...

185
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,318
And throw it to first base.

186
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:51,205
How was I supposed to know? You made
such a big deal yelling out to them.

187
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:54,308
Diversionary tactic, Engelberg.
Now get the ball.

188
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,927
Why are you always picking on me?
What did I do to you?

189
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,714
Quit your bellyaching and
throw the ball to first base!

190
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,308
<i>(Glass breaking)</i>

191
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,359
<i>(Boy) Estupido.</i>

192
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,846
<i>Don't blame me. I didn't
even know it was your car.</i>

193
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,816
It's dumb, parking it
so close to the field anyway.

194
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,552
All right, boys.

195
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,053
Let's get back to basics.

196
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,555
This is a baseball.

197
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,058
The object of the game
is to keep the baseball...

198
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,161
- Within the confines of the playing field.
- <i>Wait a minute!</i>

199
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,465
You don't think we know
what a ball is?

200
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,468
I don't think I like
that kind of talk.

201
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,704
<i>He's been in enough
fights this week already.</i>

202
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,511
What do you expect?
All we got on this team...

203
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,214
Is a bunch of Jews, spics,
niggers, pansies,

204
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,216
and a booger-eating moron.

205
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,035
Tanner, you should be
reminded from time to time...

206
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:56,238
That you're one of the few
people on this team...

207
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,206
Who's not a Jew, spic,
nigger, pansy,

208
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,841
or booger-eating moron.

209
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,644
So you better cool it, or we may be
disposed to beat the crap out of you.

210
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,646
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

211
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:06,347
Cut it out!

212
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,185
Now, guys, somebody's gonna
pay for this windshield.

213
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,789
And I think, Engelberg,
it's gonna be your father.

214
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,591
Bullshit.

215
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,312
<i>(Honking)</i>

216
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,813
Come on, babe.

217
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,316
We were supposed to be here by 7:30.

218
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,701
Isn't that something?
It looks like a baseball field.

219
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,370
They did a nice job, didn't they?

220
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,472
I had them leave off the anchovies...

221
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,542
Because I didn't know whether to
use them as bats or the baseline.

222
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,813
Besides, most people don't like
the taste of anchovies.

223
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,414
I don't like them.
You see?

224
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,017
Carol, where is Frank?
Is he still practicing?

225
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,085
Of course.
You got to keep after him.

226
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,822
You all look terrific.
All right, everybody be patient!

227
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,576
- Pizza's on very, very soon.
- <i>(Man) Jill, I'm getting ready for the slide show.</i>

228
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,379
- Glad you could make it.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

229
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,984
We have one of these every year. It helps
to get things off on a friendly note.

230
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,453
After the start of the season,

231
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,623
we all don't always
get along so well.

232
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,643
Well, how are the
uniforms coming along?

233
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,228
What?

234
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,097
The uniforms.
Your team uniforms.

235
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,799
Hey, Buttermaker,
you better get on the ball.

236
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,435
All the best colors
have been taken--

237
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,571
green and white,
blue and white,

238
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,740
<i>red and white, maroon and white,</i>
<i>white and maroon.</i>

239
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,310
Uniforms?

240
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,330
Hey, Whitewood. What's this crap
about uniforms?

241
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:33,735
- What do you mean, "crap"? I've been meaning to ask--
- You're paying me to coach.

242
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:37,004
You told me I'd be coaching some kids
just a couple of hours a day.

243
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:40,342
I've got a lot of pools to clean.
I can't be out looking for uniforms.

244
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,843
Will you be quiet for a minute?

245
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:45,346
- You've been hired as a manager, right?
- Yeah.

246
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:48,249
One of the responsibilities
of being a manager...

247
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,184
Is to get a sponsor
and to get uniforms.

248
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,353
Wait. No.
You didn't tell me that.

249
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,388
I'm telling you now.
It's easy.

250
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:57,025
You go around to these different
businesses and you talk to the guys.

251
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,510
They all like baseball.

252
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,626
How could you possibly
strike out Ted Williams?

253
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,627
I had a mother of a screwball.

254
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,263
He means Ted Williams
was a major leaguer.

255
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,265
You never got past the minors.

256
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,768
It was spring training,
Vero Beach, Florida.

257
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,271
Struck him out a couple of times.

258
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,589
You're not supposed to have
open liquor in the car.

259
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:31,593
- It's against the law.
- So is murder, Engelberg.

260
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,846
Now put that back before you
get me into real trouble.

261
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,381
If you were so great,

262
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,352
- how come you never made it to the major leagues?
- Contract disputes.

263
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,805
- When are we gonna get our uniforms?
- I'm working on it.

264
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,360
Hey, Ahmad,

265
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:53,297
even Hank Aaron peels the old eyelids
before he takes a swing.

266
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,734
Maybe I should try left-handed.

267
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:59,154
No. Not just yet.

268
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:08,396
<i>When are we going to
get our uniforms?</i>

269
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,314
I'm working on it.

270
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:14,618
All the other kids got their uniforms.
When are we gonna get ours?

271
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,704
You worry about your hitting.

272
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,040
Let me worry about the uniforms.

273
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,558
My hat fell in.

274
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,592
Dummy.

275
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,411
Oh, God. You too?

276
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,447
How's the vacuuming coming, Toby?

277
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:27,014
Not enough suction.

278
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,250
Just move it back and forth.
It will come.

279
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,753
When we're through,
can we go swimming?

280
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,856
Don't jump in, Engelberg.
You'll flood the valley.

281
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,390
How's it going, Ogilvie?

282
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,959
Well, there's not enough pressure,

283
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:40,528
but I'm adjusting
the intake valve now.

284
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,330
You got a hell of a future
in pools, kid.

285
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,699
Where have you been, you crud?
It's been an hour.

286
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:48,269
I've been out getting what you
creeps have been bitching for...

287
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,404
uniforms.

288
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,407
<i>Best pitch I ever taught her
was the curveball.</i>

289
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,743
How could you teach a 9-year-old girl
to throw a curveball?

290
00:14:55,812 --> 00:15:01,649
<i>Not only a curveball, but the most
tantalizing knuckler you ever saw.</i>

291
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:04,185
<i>This thing was a thing of beauty.</i>

292
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:06,754
<i>It came to the plate
and disappeared.</i>

293
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,857
<i>It was like a ball
of melted ice cream.</i>

294
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,593
- Here.
- Thank you, Luppus.

295
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,529
- Lupus.
- Lupus. Sorry.

296
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,168
Ahh. That's superb.
Thank you very much.

297
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,737
Tell us about the time you
struck out Ted Williams again.

298
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:25,840
Ted Williams, 1947...
Vero Beach, Florida,

299
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:28,409
spring training, around March 15th.

300
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:30,477
Score was tied nothing to nothing.

301
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:33,581
It was the top of the ninth.

302
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,150
<i>No. It was the
bottom of the ninth.</i>

303
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,685
<i>Bases were loaded.</i>

304
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,690
<i>There was old Ted
coming up to the plate,</i>

305
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,225
<i>swinging a menacing bat.</i>

306
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:45,927
<i>"Strike one."</i>

307
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,595
What's the matter?

308
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,663
Come on.
Let's keep playing.

309
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,232
He might be hurt.

310
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,766
I think he's dead.

311
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,835
He's not dead!
He's drunk!

312
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,370
Had enough beer.

313
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,938
What a mess.

314
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,473
A lot of smoking too.

315
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,142
What do we do?

316
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,144
Nothing.

317
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,446
He ain't any good to us sober, either.

318
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,597
Opening day's tomorrow.
We don't know what the batting order is.

319
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,317
We don't even have our positions set.

320
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,320
All we got is a cruddy "alky"
for a manager.

321
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,851
Come on, Red. Let's
straighten your hat there.

322
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,954
Engelberg, how about buttoning those
buttons on your uniform, will you?

323
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,091
I been trying all morning.
It's too small.

324
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:11,262
Well, come on.
Look neater, you know.

325
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,847
<i>(Man on P.A.)
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

326
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:18,836
<i>I want to welcome you here to
the opening game of the season.</i>

327
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:23,207
What I want is to see
every boy in America...

328
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,610
Out on the baseball field

329
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,530
playing the great game
of baseball.

330
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:29,930
Thank you.

331
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,906
Well, uh, this is the moment
we've been waiting for.

332
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,475
It's opening day.

333
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:44,078
Now, I'd like to call your attention
to our new scoreboard...

334
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,548
<i>Named in memory of Tommy Martin--</i>

335
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:50,167
Look out!
Get back!

336
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,535
<i>(Boy) ¿que pasa?</i>

337
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,491
Get off the field!

338
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,301

what were you doing,
you little punk?

344
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:38,165
Uh, what was I--

345
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:43,521
Oh, yes, the new scoreboard

<i>I want you to look like champions</i>

358
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,924

He's going to take the picture!

365
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:37,191
- Hey, my uniform's too small.
- Ah, shut up.

366
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,830
Take the picture!

367
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:48,469

Was that an error?

402
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,239
It's an error on the throw,

404

Go on home.

00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,162
Yeah. Home, I said.

422
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,183
<i>Home!</i>

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,956
Dammit.

425
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:40,110
Hold it up.

426
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,680
I just want to get a word
with the other coach, okay?

427
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,083
- Okay, hurry it up, though.
- You got it.

428
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,552
- Hey, Turner.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

429
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,122
What do you say we call this thing off?
This is getting ridiculous.

430
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:56,760
They're going to call it off in 15 minutes
anyway so let me give you a little advice.

431
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,964
Let your team stay out there. They'll be
able to say they didn't give up.

432
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,933
And you won't make
quitters out of them.

433
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,202
I'm calling this off right now.

434
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,339
- <i>I was just thinking of your boys, that's all.</i>
- The hell you were.

435
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,440
The hell I wasn't.

436
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,794
What I saw out there today
made me sick, you know that?

437
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:16,397
<i>Your team has no right
being on that field.</i>

438
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:21,802
Look at yourself, "Butterworth."
Look at that team.

439
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,057
I mean, why don't you
do this league a favor?

440
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,609
You and the Bears just drop out.
I mean it.

441
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:32,313
<i>I mean just...
just drop out.</i>

442
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,769
I mean it.

443
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,072
It's a forfeit.
We forfeit the game.

444
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,440
- You forfeit?
- Yeah.

445
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,542
That's it!
That's the game!

446
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,978
<i>Forfeit by the Bears!</i>

447
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,980
<i>(Turner) Come on in, fellas!</i>

448
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,982
<i>(Announcer) The remainder of

<i>Up the alley, down the street,</i>

452
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:04,595
who's the hardest team to beat?

453
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,597
Bears! Bears! Yay!

454
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:12,119
Well, guys, it ain't so bad.

455
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:16,256
I was once in a high-school
game where the score--

456
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:23,780
Come on, guys, will you?
It's only a game.

457
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:28,134
Hey, nice try, Bears. Maybe next
time you'll get a chance to bat.

458
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:31,237
Hey, Tanner! Come down, Tanner!
Get down from there.

459
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:34,140
Forget about that. Now, sit down.
I want to talk to you.

460
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:37,310
I'm not listening to you, crud.
I'm leaving.

461
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:40,680
Sit down, Tanner. Ta--

462
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,716
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you guys going?

463
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,985
- Mr. Buttermaker, I got to talk to you!
- Wait a minute.

464
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:47,721
It's important!
I got to talk to ya.

465
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:54,594
- What do you want?
- Ahmad's up a tree. Says he's not coming down.

466
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:56,696
- Ahmad?
- Yeah.

467
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,132
- What do you mean, climbed up a tree?
- Says he's not coming down.

468
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,936
- Well, tell his family about it.
- Said if I told them where he was, he'd kill me.

469
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:05,304
And anyway, I promised him I wouldn't.

470
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,236
How's the view up there, Ahmad?

471
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,528
Hey.

472
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:31,080
<i>How come you're not
wearing your clothes?</i>

473
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,300
Don't deserve to wear no uniform.

474
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,139
You get away from here, Buttermaker.

475
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:43,477
This ain't your tree.
Anybody can climb up here.

476
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,512
Just leave me alone.

477
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:49,199
Keeping your family waiting, you know.

478
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:52,202
- Can't face them.
- Why?

479
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,172
- What do you mean, why?
- Errors, that's why.

480
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,374
Easy fly balls.

481
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,942
There's nothing easy about
those fly balls, Ahmad.

482
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,012
They were tough chances.
The sun was in your eyes.

483
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,348
Don't give me any of your
honky bullshit, Buttermaker.

484
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,083
I know they were easy.

485
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,352
Let's not bring race
into this, Ahmad.

486
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,189
We got enough problems as it is.

487
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,893
- Anyway, your brothers will understand.
- No, they won't.

488
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,212
They would never make
flubs like that.

489
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,897
They were all big athletes.

490
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,966
When they were my age, they were
captains of all their teams,

491
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,068
and great players, and I'm not.

492
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:29,106
I'm lousy at football,
basketball and baseball.

493
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:33,143
I'm quitting the whole damn thing.

494
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,297
- Thank God Hank Aaron didn't act like this.
- What?

495
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:40,667
Don't give me that "what".
You know what I'm talking about.

496
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:42,702
What are you talking about?

497
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:45,272
The 42 errors.

498
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
42 errors?

499
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:50,043
Come off it, will you, Ahmad?
Stop pulling my leg.

500
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:53,513
You know what I'm talking about.
You know all about Hank Aaron.

501
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:58,718
His first year in sandlot ball, he committed
42 errors. He was 9 years old.

502
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,188
Broke his little heart.
He damn near quit.

503
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,790
Thank God for us, he didn't.

504
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:06,359
There'd be no great old number 44.

505
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:09,830
- Buttermaker, you're so full of--
-  It's common knowledge, for crying out loud!

506
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:13,066
Ask Ogilvie.

507
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:17,237
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
He's your favorite player too.

508
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,376
Well.

509
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:24,911
<i>(Sigh)</i>

510
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Kind of ruins my plans.

511
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,849
I was thinking around
the fourth game,

512
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:32,719
<i>you'd be switch-hitting.</i>

513
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:36,806
I figured with your speed and right side
of the plate, those few extra steps you get,

514
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,541
<i>you'd be a tough out.</i>

515
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,261
You know, bunts, things like that.

516
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,549
I <i>am</i> kind of fast, huh?

517
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,053
You're very fast.

518
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:56,259
<i>(Man on P.A.) At present there are
at least two to three instances</i>

519
00:29:56,328 --> 00:30:01,598
<i>of cardiac arrest or heart seizure at
every major sports event at the coliseum...</i>

520
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,100
You're two and a half hours late.

521
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,836
- I told you to meet me in my office.
- I couldn't find it.

522
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:11,441
Jesus. I couldn't believe that score...
26-0.

523
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,313
What a beating! My son wouldn't come out
of his room all weekend.

524
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,935
That's why I want to disband the team.

525
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:24,170
Have you told the boys yet?
Not yet.

526
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,007
I was hoping to sneak away from the office
this afternoon and drop by the field.

527
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,509
Actually, it might be better
if you told them yourself.

528
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:34,564
I mean, they really do like you.
And, uh, I'd appreciate it.

529
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,566
<i>What if the boys
don't want to quit?</i>

530
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:40,002
That's not important.
This has been very humiliating.

531
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:44,641
We've put these boys in a situation
they just can't handle.

532
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,678
- I hope you think that's fair.
- <i>Mr. Harrison is here with his 2:30 appointment--</i>

533
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,648
About the Police Academy bill.

534
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:52,682
Would you sign these first?

535
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,552
I know this has all been my fault.

536
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,254
I just want to end it
as quickly as possible.

537
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,478
Good-bye, Buttermaker.

538
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:22,879
<i>(Tosses can in back)</i>

539
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,681
<i>(Starts car)</i>

540
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,324
I know it says $1.25 on the map,

541
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,926
but what it really is,
is $2.00 because of inflation.

542
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,072
Hey, "Boilermaker", long time no see.

543
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:53,209
Hey, pretty fancy neighborhood you're
working these days, Amanda.

544
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,245
Coming up in the world, huh?

545
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,747
What are you doing here?

546
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:02,135
I didn't have any pools to clean,
so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

547
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,253
- <i>How's your mom?</i>
- Fine. What's it to you?

548
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,223
- Is that the way to talk to me?
- I haven't seen you in two or three years.

549
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:09,893
If you're looking for money,
you can forget it.

550
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,478
I'm not looking for money.
I'm not looking for anything.

551
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,781
- <i>Be sociable, for crying out loud.</i>
- Hey, what's that?

552
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,667
- What's what?
- <i>It's a mitt.</i>

553
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,435
- What?
- <i>That.</i>

554
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,004
Oh, yeah.

555
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,572
I thought if you weren't too busy,

556
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,976
maybe you'd like to play catch.

557
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,143
No, thanks.

558
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,263
No? Well, it was just an idea.

559
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:32,865
I mean, it's--

560
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,934
er, er, uh--

561
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:38,554
- How's your fastball these days?
- Why?

562
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,658
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm coaching
a bunch of kids some baseball.

563
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,762
<i>Maybe if you're not doing anything,
you can drop by the field.</i>

564
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,765
Maybe join the team
for old times' sake.

565
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,900
I knew you were up to something.
I'm through with pitching.

566
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:54,387
My mom says you almost ruined me
with that sports stuff.

567
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:58,491
- How did I ruin you?
- That fastball put my arm in a sling.

568
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,710
It's a fine way to act toward me.

569
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,613
- I figure you owe me a thing or two.
- "Owe you a thing or two"?

570
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,348
I was like a father to you.

571
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,902
- Ha! Some father.
- Didn't I take you to all the ball games?

572
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,971
- You'd have gone to them anyway.
- Didn't I take you horseback riding?

573
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,840
Didn't I take you and your mother
to the movies twice a week?

574
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,609
Didn't I pay for your math tutor?

575
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:19,812
The math tutor guy was a drunk like you.
I got a "D" in math that year.

576
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,550
Didn't I let you hang around with me
while I cleaned the pools?

577
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:26,152
While <i>you</i> cleaned the pools? Who you trying to kid?
I'm the one who did all the work.

578
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,053
You sat there and drank
your beer all day.

579
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:29,622
By the fourth pool,
you were out cold.

580
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:33,859
I had to call my mom
to come pick us up.

581
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,696
What about your appendix?
Who rushed you to the hospital?

582
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,582
Who saved your life? Would you
be alive today if it weren't for me?

583
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,601
Yeah, but when you weren't
saving people's lives,

584
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,603
you were sitting around
the apartment drunk.

585
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:45,872
Then you just split.

586
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,141
You made my mother sick.
You know, she wanted to marry you.

587
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,176
Boy, was she dumb.

588
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,545
Ah, your mother and I didn't
get along too well, Amanda.

589
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,715
I liked her very much though.
I still do, as a matter of fact.

590
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,151
I'm just not the marrying kind.

591
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,386
I guess I handled it badly, huh?

592
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,804
You handled it like shit!

593
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:03,972
Hey, don't use that kind of language.

594
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:05,908
You can't tell me what kind
of language I can use.

595
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:07,710
Yes, I can! If you're gonna
talk that way in front of me--

596
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,378
Look, Boilermaker,
you're not my father,

597
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,380
and I ain't interested in playing baseball
for you anymore.

598
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,382
So why don't you get back
into that sardine can of yours

599
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,385
and go-- go vacuum the bottom
of the Pacific Ocean?

600
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,388
I've got business to take care of.
You're blocking my customers with your car.

601
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:32,952
All right, boys. Let's go.

602
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,254
Up. Everybody up.
Practice. Come on!

603
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:52,005
All right, all right.
I'm an asshole.

604
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:56,108
Go ahead and yell.
Get it off your chests.

605
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,677
I deserve it.

606
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,474
We really appreciate
these new uniforms, Buttermaker,

607
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:15,244
but we're not going to be
needing them anymore.

608
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:22,152
We've been taking a lot of razzing
in school about opening day, and--

609
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,638
<i>and they were laughing at us,
picking on us.</i>

610
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:30,276
Anyway, we took a vote
and decided that we'd quit.

611
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,613
<i>What the hell happened
to you, Tanner?</i>

612
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:35,614
<i>(Engelberg) Tanner got into
a fight because of it.</i>

613
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,883
Who with?

614
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:39,268
- The seventh grade.
- <i>What?</i>

615
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,170
The seventh grade.

616
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:44,290
You took on the whole seventh grade?

617
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,593
You want to quit, Tanner?

618
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,179
Crud, no.
I want to play ball.

619
00:35:57,038 --> 00:36:00,106
I can understand how you guys feel.

620
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:03,977
I haven't been much of a manager...

621
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:07,346
Or much of anything else,
for that matter.

622
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:12,368
And I'm sorry.

623
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:14,603
<i>But this quitting thing--</i>

624
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,623
it's a hard habit to break
once you start.

625
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,161
You're a damn good bunch of boys.

626
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,030
You probably deserved
a lot better than me,

627
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,066
but we're stuck with each other.

628
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:28,568
Jimmy, grab a bat.

629
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:31,754
<i>Engelberry, get your gear on.
Get behind home plate.</i>

630
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,623
- What for?
- We need to practice.

631
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,576
<i>But we disbanded the team.
We took a vote.</i>

632
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:39,078
Goddamn it!

633
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:41,998
Nobody's vote counts
around here but mine!

634
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:46,335
Get your gear on and get your fat ass behind
the plate before I kick it up there.

635
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:51,857
And the rest of you pansy-ass quitters,
move your asses before I kick them all.

636
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,561
We got a game with the Athletics
next Wednesday,

637
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,664
and that means only one thing...

638
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,217
bad news for the Athletics!

639
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,288
Oh, no, no, no.

640
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,357
You're dragging your right foot, Jimmy.

641
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,960
You got to plant it.
Here, I'll show you.

642
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,029
Right here. Just plant it.

643
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,563
Make sure it stays there.

644
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,366
Okay.

645
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,800
<i>Let's look alive out there.</i>

646
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:19,736
Let's look alive.

647
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,907
Way to go, Jimmy!

648
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,809
<i>Good hit!</i>

649
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:28,311
<i>Way to go!</i>

650
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,650
No, Tanner, no!
Everybody watch this.

651
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:36,585
You get down on your left knee there,

652
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:40,022
so if you miss the ball, it hits your body,
you can still make the play.

653
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,924
Up, everybody.

654
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,776
All right, Engelberry, hit it again.

655
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,798
That's it! That's the way to do it!
You see how easy it is?

656
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,835
You see how simple that is?
You just get down on your left knee.

657
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,870
You miss the ball, it hits your body.
You still make the play.

658
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,871
You understand?

659
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,840
Okay, let's do it again.

660
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,742
<i>(Yelling)</i>

661
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,149
A busted bat and a long fly ball--

662
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,486
any day now Durocher will call!

663
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,451
- <i>Ooh!
- Shit!</i>

664
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,435
<i>Ow!</i>

665
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,859
Any second now, Ogilvie...

666
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,360
Heart attack time.

667
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,964
I'll send flowers to your funeral.

668
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,466
Must have... sustenance.

669
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:52,194
Couldn't you at least
have unwrapped it?

670
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,829
I got it! I got it!

671
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,831
Good move!

What's your boys
doing out in the field?

674
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:09,278
Getting ready for a game
with the Athletics.

675
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,413
The Athletics?
Haven't you heard?

676
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,283
Councilman Whitewood told the
league committee he's calling it quits.

677
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,886
He is. We aren't.

678
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,255
What are you, one of those
sadists or something?

679
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,625
Didn't those kids take enough of a beating
on opening day? What the hell you trying to do?

680
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,695
Win the pennant.

681
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,198
This schedule says that on the last day
of the season, June 19th,

682
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,533
the two best teams play for a title.

683
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,535
We intend to be one of those teams.

684
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,771
Be a lot of fun if
you were the other.

685
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,307
Two hands, Engelberg, two hands!

686
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:43,112
All right, guys. I want to see some
hard-nosed play out there.

687
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,114
Now, everybody,
once more with feeling.

688
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,615
First base! Second base!

689
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,452
Do we have to do that one?
It's so corny.

690
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,622
Come on, listen to me. Once more with feeling.
First base! Second base!

691
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,124
Third base! Home!

692
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:59,511
<i>(Bears) Around them bases
we shall roam!</i>

693
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,730
Come on, batter!

694
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,966
Check the big play!

695
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,570
Batter can't hit!

696
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:11,774
Batter...

697
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,443
Swing!

698
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,177
Ball four!
Take your base.

699
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:34,463
Go home!

700
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,514
Home! Go home!

701
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,499
Here! Home!

702
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:37,500
Go home!

703
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,001
All the way home!

704
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,086
Go home!

705
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,566
Out!

706
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:54,549
Crud!

707
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:02,741
Come on! Catch it!

708
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,131
Who do we appreciate?

709
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,982
Bears! Bears!

710
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,234
Yay!

711
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:17,022
All right, come on, guys, lighten up.

712
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,891
<i>We finished the whole game,
didn't we?</i>

713
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,580
I thought you were safe, Tanner.

714
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,283
Come on, fellas.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

715
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,285
Yeah. It took several hundred years.

716
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:34,522
We lost 18-0, "Buttercrud." And the Athletics
are the worst team in the league.

717
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,524
Second worst.

718
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,627
- Sorry, I forgot.
- Snap out of it, wil ya?

719
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,863
Nobody said it was going to be easy.

720
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,131
Don't look so glum.

721
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,968
Well, we committed 24 errors.

722
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,237
Their pitcher threw
a no-hitter against us.

723
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,105
But there <i>is</i> some good news...

724
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:52,324
<i>Two of our runners</i>

725
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,927
almost managed to get to first base,

726
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:58,030
and we <i>did</i> hit 17 foul balls.

727
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,332
That's right. That's the spirit!
C'mon guys,

728
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,885
<i>cokes and hot dogs on me.</i>

729
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,820
- Yeah!
- This way.

730
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:08,224
Buttermaker, I said I wasn't interested.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

731
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:11,126
I'm not afraid. I'm just through
with all that tomboy stuff.

732
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,297
Baseball's not tomboy stuff. It's your
country's national pastime. It's healthy.

733
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,067
It's a lot healthier than sitting
around here on a stupid street corner

734
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,769
selling dumb maps to a bunch
of ignorant hicks.

735
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,621
Look at that gut on you.

736
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:25,624
I beg your pardon. There isn't
an ounce of fat on me.

737
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:28,393
There will be if you keep
sitting around here.

738
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,863
- This is sure a lousy job you got.
- It ain't lousy.

739
00:42:31,932 --> 00:42:35,066
Half the state of Iowa came by
last week. Cleared 85 bucks.

740
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,753
Bet it's more than you make.

741
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,823
- You saving any of that money?
- Of course I am.

742
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,841
What are you going
to do with it?

743
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,777
I'm going to get braces.

744
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm going to be taking ballet
lessons pretty soon.

745
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:51,300
I'm-- I'm going to be a model.

746
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,437
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

747
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:56,405
<i>I'll tell you what--</i>

748
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,307
you come and pitch
a few games for us,

749
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:01,010
I'll pay for the modeling thing
and the ballet lessons.

750
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,428
Can't do anything about the braces
'cause that's big money.

751
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,247
Buttermaker, you're so dumb.

752
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,416
Those boys aren't rough.
You won't get hurt.

753
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:10,052
That's got nothing to do with it.

754
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,120
I'm almost 12, and I'll--

755
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,056
I'll be getting a bra soon.

756
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,395
Well, maybe in a year or so.

757
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,998
I can't be playing no dumb baseball.

758
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:27,085
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

759
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:31,423
You're turning into
a regular little lady.

760
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,577
It was a dumb idea anyway.

761
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,964
I mean, you wouldn't have
helped the team much.

762
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,068
You were great when you were nine,

763
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:46,004
but girls reach their peak
athletically about that age.

764
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:49,257
Probably haven't picked up
a ball in two years anyway.

765
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,843
Give my love to your mom.

766
00:43:51,912 --> 00:43:53,912
Don't be such a stranger.

767
00:43:57,767 --> 00:43:58,801
Hey, Boilermaker.

768
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,001
Yeah?

769
00:44:00,088 --> 00:44:02,437
Got my curve breaking
two and a half feet.

770
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:06,690
Oh, yeah? Then you <i>have</i> been
practicing, huh?

771
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:11,310
But don't give me no baloney about a curve
breaking two and a half feet, though.</i>

772
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,865
For how much?

773
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,450
Ten bucks.

774
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,118
Make it 20.

775
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,070
We got a bet.

776
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,824
I thought we were going
to see some curves.

777
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,611
Okay, the next one's coming
right between your eyes.

778
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,505
Twelve ballet lessons.

779
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:55,007
Nine ballet lessons.

780
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:57,343
They're $3.00 a shot. I can't--

781
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,611
Twelve ballet lessons or no go.

782
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,047
Ahh, I just lit that cigar.
That's terrible.

783
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,615
Make it nine ballet lessons--

784
00:45:03,684 --> 00:45:07,052
- I want the imported kind of jeans.
- Jeans?

785
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,789
- Yes. French jeans.
- I'm not getting you any jeans.

786
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:14,860
Do you know how many pools I got
to clean to get imported jeans?

787
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:17,128
- What's the matter with American jeans?
- I don't like them.

788
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:21,016
- Who do you think you are, Catfish Hunter?
- Who's he?

789
00:45:24,372 --> 00:45:27,439
Boys, I'd like you to
meet your new pitcher...

790
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:29,074
Amanda Whurlizer.

791
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,576
Jews, spics, niggers, and now a girl?

792
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,412
Grab a bat, punk.

793
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,024
Jimmy Feldman, Toby Whitewood.

794
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:47,559
<i>Toby!</i>

795
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:49,127
Yeah! Right.

796
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:50,662
<i>Sixth. No, you're seventh.</i>

797
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:52,397
Seventh.

798
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,182
<i>(Woman on P.A.)

<i>Roy Close, number seven, left field.</i>

800
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,475
Come on, Amanda.
Right through him!

801
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,814
<i>(Applause)</i>

802
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,839

Strike three!
You're out!

804
00:46:21,628 --> 00:46:23,762

What's she doing now with the--

807
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:37,526
Ah, that's the, uh--
that's the spitter.

808
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,094
Wets-- wets her fingers, you see.

809
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:43,198
Then she appears to dry them
on her cap,

810
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:46,285
but she's not 'cause she
has Vaseline under there.

811
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,473
Strike three!
You're out!

812
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,234
Strike three!
You're out!

813
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,855
Take it easy on the first few batters.

814
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,558
I want to see how our
infield handles balls.

No.

Come on, leave him alone.
Will you cut that out?

Now cut that out!
Move over.

All I know is, when we win
a game, it's a team win.

When we lose a game,
it's a team loss.

the white Sox.

Jumpin' catfish!

00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:04,616
What a great arm!
Who is that kid, anyway?

848
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,120
Of course he's got a great arm.
He's the best athlete in the area.

849
00:50:08,189 --> 00:50:10,456
But you don't understand...

850
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,591
<i>That's Kelly Leak.</i>

851
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:14,576
- You guys talking about Kelly Leak?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

852
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,578
That dude is a bad mother.

853
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,580
You're talking about a loan shark.

854
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,081
I borrowed a nickel
from him last week.

855
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,918
He said if I didn't give him a dime
by Friday, he'd break my arm.

856
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:24,502
<i>Es un bandido.</i>

857
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:28,190
I don't know what he's talking about,
but I like him. He's got balls.

858
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:31,593
Why screw around guys? If the guy
can play ball, he can play ball.

859
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,361
Let's get him on the team.

860

So-so.

866
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:07,696
We could use a good outfielder
on our team.

867
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:10,948
You call what you got a team?

868
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:27,715
What you got against
baseball anyway?

869
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:32,553
The baseball you guys play
is for faggots and old farts

870
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,340
who don't have anything better
to do with themselves.

871
00:51:35,408 --> 00:51:37,759
You must like those kind of guys.

872
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:39,545
You sure do hang around
the field often enough.

873
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:43,264
There's nice ass at the field.
That's why I hang around there.

874

Serve it.

877
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,626
I don't want to play for money.

878
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:58,213
If I win, you play
baseball for the Bears.

879
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:01,200
- And if I win?
- Name it.

883
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,281

to be so good at those games.

884

He's just better at it!

885

That's the last time
I ever listen to you.

- What's that?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

888

What's 8:00 Friday night?

889
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:53,385
I lost that game,

890
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:56,405
so I gotta go to the Rolling Stones
concert with the creep.

891
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,673

894
00:53:02,629 --> 00:53:05,446
They don't go out
with people like that.

895
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,517
Boy, you take the cake.
First you blow the game,

896
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,202
then you get roped into
a date with an ex-con.

897
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:14,556
You're like a chimney.
I'm sick of it.

898
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,925
Start the car, and let's go.

899
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,459
Probably lost on purpose.

01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,059
Cleveland! Stretcher!

1014
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:22,043
A stretcher for his balls?

1015
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,513
Let him stretch out.
That must hurt.

1016
01:01:24,582 --> 01:01:26,014
Buttermaker,
do I have to go?

1017
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,600
No. We're just going
to get you checked out.

1018
01:01:28,669 --> 01:01:30,268
No. I want to go play.

1019
01:01:30,337 --> 01:01:32,754
We have to check you.
It's a sensitive area.

1020
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,256
I want to play.

1021
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:35,957
<i>(Buttermaker)</i>
<i>Don't worry. You'll play.</i>

1022
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,759
Buttermaker, you better start worrying...

1023
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:40,179
About your team finishing
the season in one piece...

1024
01:01:40,247 --> 01:01:42,397
Instead of trying to
get in the play-offs.

1025
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,818
I just pray he's wearing his cup.

1026
01:01:45,886 --> 01:01:50,138
<i>One, two, two, two,</i>
<i>three, two, four, two,</i>

1027
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,174

1034
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:15,163
Very good. Very good.

1035
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,900
Would you like a piece of chicken?

1036
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:20,469
Would you turkeys blow on
out of here?

1037
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:22,504
<i>I will not allow this!</i>

1038
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,073
Engelberg, the White Sox
beat the Mets!

1039
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,208
We're talking championships.

1040
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:30,112
Young man, I am teaching
a class here.

1041
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,147
You ain't doin' a
very good job of it.

1042
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,716
No one here can dance
worth bat turds.

1043
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:38,320
Tanner, get the hell out of here!

1044
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:41,523
I will kill you!
Out! Go!

1045
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,525
<i>(Clamoring continues)</i>

1046
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,628
I'm hitting .841.
I'm on the Bears.

1047
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:49,698
You live around here?

1048
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,233
I got a Harley-Davidson.

1049
01:02:51,302 --> 01:02:54,035
Does that turn you on--
Harley-Davidson?

1050
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,938
I don't have to remind you who we'll be
playing in the championship tomorrow...

1051
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,940
After we beat these Athletics today.

1052
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:03,812
I got one last question.
Let's see who can answer it.

1053
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,781
What does this game mean
to the Athletics? Ahmad?

1054
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,818
It means a hell of a lot of
badass news for the Athletics.

1055
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,654
Let's go!
Kelly. Kelly.

1056
01:03:14,425 --> 01:03:16,358
I want you handling the ball

1057
01:03:16,427 --> 01:03:18,360
as much as possible out there today.

1058
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:20,362
This game is too damn important for us.

1059
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:22,364
Any ball you get near, go for it.

1060
01:03:42,202 --> 01:03:43,518
Way to go!

1061
01:03:45,456 --> 01:03:48,590

the bathroom for you too?

1064
01:03:56,634 --> 01:03:58,167
Hey! Tanner!

01:04:17,404 --> 01:04:18,936
Sorry.

1068
01:04:19,005 --> 01:04:23,275
- We got nine men out here, you know?
- Yeah. Okay.

I expect you to follow it.

You're up first this inning.
Grab yourself a goddamn bat.

1075
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:11,756
Let's get the run back.

1076
01:05:16,729 --> 01:05:18,329

1081

Again?

1082
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,876
0-2, and Stein is up next.

1083
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,244

1084
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,020

1085
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:00,354
What are you doing?

1086
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,173
You trying to win this thing or not?

1087
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:06,277
I'll put Miguel in.
At least he'll try.

1088
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,417
Just get out of here and let me hit...

1089

Kelly!

1094
01:06:56,996 --> 01:06:58,429
Congratulations.

1095
01:06:58,498 --> 01:06:59,931

- See you tomorrow at the big game.
- Thank you.

1100
01:07:12,345 --> 01:07:15,313
I was really scared for a minute there.

1101
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:17,948
He's just a rotten ball hog.

1102
01:07:18,017 --> 01:07:20,535
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

1103
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,154
Does anybody want to go for a ride?

1104
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,946
Want to go for a ride, Timmy?

1105
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:41,255
Okay, let's get your elbow in there.

1106
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:43,824
- The water sure is cold.
- Don't worry about it.

1107
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,660
Will you listen to me
and forget the elbow?

1108
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,696
- Got to hold down the swelling.
- It's not that bad.

1109
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:51,299
- Buttermaker?
- All right. Shoot.

1110
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:55,136
- I invited my mom to the game tomorrow.
- You did? That's nice.

1111
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:57,571
- It's the last game of the year.
- Fine, fine, fine.

1112
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,409
Got a big surprise
for you after too...

1113
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,444
- We're all going to dinner.
- What?

1114
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:06,247
After that, we're going to the drive-in movie.
It's a double feature.

1115
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:10,668
- Let's play it by ear, see how things go tomorrow.
- Please don't try to blow it.

1116
01:08:10,737 --> 01:08:14,372
She wasn't too keen on it at first. I had
to work real hard to get it set up.

1117
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:17,475
Yeah. I bet you did.

1118
01:08:17,544 --> 01:08:19,960
I don't think it's a
very good idea, Amanda.

1119
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,579
No excuses, Boilermaker.

1120
01:08:21,648 --> 01:08:25,383
- It's all fixed and I'm paying, so you can't cry poor.
- Yes, but listen--

1121
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:28,586
Last Sunday I made a killing. A guy
wanted to wallpaper his bathroom

1122
01:08:28,655 --> 01:08:30,154
and bought 35 maps.

1123
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:33,424
Amanda, you know damn well that your
mother and I don't get along.

1124
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:37,028
So we're not going to dinner or a movie
or anywhere else together.

1125
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:39,564
Do you understand? Just keep your
elbow in the water.

1126
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:41,432
- Then just you and I will go.
- Yeah, right.

1127
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:45,469
You and I will take the whole team out
and get some hamburgers.

1128
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:49,674
- Well, I was just thinking us.
- Just us, no outsiders.

1129
01:08:51,743 --> 01:08:57,479
Well, then, maybe we could go horseback riding
or something, or maybe to a matinee.

1130
01:08:57,549 --> 01:09:01,684
Yeah. We'll see.
How does it feel?

1131
01:09:01,753 --> 01:09:04,455
Why do you always change the subject?
You're always pulling that number.

1132
01:09:04,524 --> 01:09:07,025
As far as I'm concerned, the subject
is your arm. You're pitching tomorrow.

1133
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,676
But what about after tomorrow?

1134
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:11,696
After tomorrow, we do
what all ballplayers do.

1135
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:13,864
We shake hands till we
see each other next season,

1136
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:17,201
then we go fishing or hunting,
make some personal appearances,

1137
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,136
get to know the wife
and kids again.

1138
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:22,023
I don't have a wife and kids.

1139
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,042
Neither do I, but I got
my pools to clean.

1140
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,644
You got your maps to sell
and your ballet to learn.

1141
01:09:26,713 --> 01:09:29,146
I could help you with your pools.

1142
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,116
- Cut it out, Amanda.
- No, it wouldn't be like you're taking me anywhere.

1143
01:09:32,185 --> 01:09:36,253
- It would be like work. You could use the help.
- No, I couldn't!

1144
01:09:36,322 --> 01:09:40,007
And besides, you shouldn't be wasting
your time cleaning pools.

1145
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:42,043
Look, Amanda, you're a terrific kid.

1146
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,611
You shouldn't be hanging
around with me.

1147
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,515
I'm an old, broken-down, third-rate ballplayer.
I like to drink too much,

1148
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:51,485
I like to smoke my cigars without anybody
bothering me, including you.

1149

<i>I'm happy that way.</i>

1150
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,489
I'm a bum.

1151
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,925
No, you're not.
You taught me how to pitch.

1152
01:09:57,994 --> 01:10:03,180
Goddamn it! Can't you get it through your
thick head I don't want your company?

1153
01:10:03,249 --> 01:10:06,584
If I did, I would have
looked you up two years ago.

1154
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,676
Did you ever think of that?

1155
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:20,347
If that's the way you feel, fine.

He's been hogging the ball in all
these games and we're sick of it.

He's not the only reason
we got this far.

have to cover up for you.

- Look, woman, don't you be telling us how to play.
- Yeah!

01:12:32,665 --> 01:12:36,416
You're acting like a bunch of babies!
Now, cut it out.

1176
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,336
Nobody has to worry anymore
because I'm quitting.

1177
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:40,871
No, you're not.
You came this far.

1178
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,440
You're going the rest of the way.

1179
01:12:43,509 --> 01:12:45,926
If it's yesterday you're
worried about, blame me.

1180
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,929
I'm the one who told
Kelly to cover for you.

1181
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:50,013
Why?

1182
01:12:50,082 --> 01:12:51,665
"Why?" What do you mean, why?

1183
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:53,900
We're in the championship,
aren't we?

1184
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,403
Well, that's what you wanted,
wasn't it?

1185
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,242
Now, just behave yourselves
and act like men.

1186
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:05,679
Come on. The Yankees have got the field now.
Let's get back to the dugout.

1187
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:11,518
I'm not gonna talk about winning.
I'm gonna talk about losing.

1188
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:14,387
'Cause if you guys lose this game,

1189
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,424
each and every one of you,

1190
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:20,527
you're going to have to
live with it.

1191
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,931
You're about the best team
I ever coached.

1192
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,298
Play a good game.

1193
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,877
<i>First up for the Yankees,</i>
<i>number one,</i>

1194
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,713
<i>Chris love, left field.</i>

1195
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:42,916
Put 'em down in order...
one, two, three.

1196
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,090
<i>(Buttermaker) Come on!
You want to win, don't you?</i>

1197
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:52,726
<i>That's what you showed up for,</i>
<i>every damn one of you!</i>

1198
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,383
Let's go! Let's go!

1199
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,437
<i>(Buttermaker) Come on, Ahmad!</i>

1200
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:09,542
Hurry! Throw it home!

1201
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,670
Did you see that, ump?

1202
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,043
Hey, that's not allowed!

1203
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,183
Hey, hey!
Enough of that!

1204
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,918
Break it up!

1205
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:39,756
Hey! Break it up!

1206
01:14:45,764 --> 01:14:49,683
<i>All right, you mother,</i>
<i>see if you can kick my ass!</i>

1207
01:14:52,138 --> 01:14:53,570
How's your chest feel?

1208
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,073
I know I don't have
too much up there,

1209
01:14:56,142 --> 01:14:57,574
but what I've got...

1210
01:14:57,643 --> 01:14:59,609
Sure don't feel too good right now.

1211
01:15:03,115 --> 01:15:05,165
I didn't need your help, you know.

1212
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,800
I know.

1213
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,469
I could have taken
all those guys myself.

1214
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:10,470
Yeah.

1215
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:13,606
Those Yankees are real turds.

1216
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,376
They sure are.

1217
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:17,394
Turner, you better cut out
that cheap crap.

1218
01:15:17,463 --> 01:15:19,396
Cheap crap? We're playing
clean, hard baseball.

1219
01:15:19,465 --> 01:15:21,698
You call spiking
an 11-year-old girl--

1220
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:25,819
Spiking? The umpire called it safe.
My team plays by the book.

1221
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:29,656
All right, pus-head. You got any
crying to do, cry to the umpire.

1222
01:15:29,724 --> 01:15:32,242
Get back to your dugout. Maybe your
team could use your help,

1223
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:34,077
<i>but I doubt it.</i>

1224
01:15:34,146 --> 01:15:37,180
<i>All right, Eddie!</i>

1225
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:40,366
You guys play by the book,
I know you do.

1226
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,838
One ball, two strikes, one out!

1227
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:49,042
<i>Strike three!</i>
<i>You're out of there.</i>

1228
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:52,079
Joe, you better pitch better than you're hitting.
Or I'm gonna take you right out.

1229
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:55,799
Turner, she's going to
ram it down your throat!

1230
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,425
Andy, what the hell's
the matter with you?

1231
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,944
<i>Unless you can play ball,</i>
<i>you go on home!</i>

1232
01:16:07,012 --> 01:16:08,378
<i>You run out every hit!</i>

1233
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:11,464
<i>I don't care if he</i>
<i>had you beat by a mile!</i>

1234
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:14,218
2-0.

1235
01:16:14,286 --> 01:16:15,285
Ball.

1236
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:18,238
Way to go, Ahmad.
He's going to walk you.

1237
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,173
<i>He can't find the plate.</i>

1238
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,195
Way to go!

1239
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:35,205
<i>And now batting for the Bears,</i>

1240
01:16:35,274 --> 01:16:37,190
<i>number three, Kelly Leak,</i>
<i>center field.</i>

1241
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,193
What the hell is the matter with you?
You don't swing at a 3-and-0 pitch.

1242
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,694
Are you crazy?

1243
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,431
- Get in there and never do that again.
- It was right where--

1244
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,833
Shut up. I don't want to hear
any excuses. Get in there.

1245
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:49,336
Come on, Kelly.

1246
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:53,774
<i>Joey!</i>

1247
01:16:59,831 --> 01:17:01,498
Ball one.

1248
01:17:04,236 --> 01:17:06,670
Hey, pus-head!
Are you crazy?

1249
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:10,007
An intentional walk
with the bases empty?

1250
01:17:10,075 --> 01:17:12,542
This is baseball, not backgammon.

1251
01:17:12,611 --> 01:17:15,379
My first baseman is lonely.

1252
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:17,714
- Rudi.
- What?

1253
01:17:17,783 --> 01:17:21,318
The first inside pitch you get,
lean into it and let it hit you.

1254
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:24,487
- You want to win the game, don't you?
- I don't want to get hurt.

1255
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,723
- All right. But you want to win the game.
- Yeah.

1256
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:30,693
Engelberg is up after you. We need runs.
He's been murdering the ball lately.

1257
01:17:30,762 --> 01:17:33,163
Do as I tell you.

1258
01:17:44,143 --> 01:17:46,477
Let's get on, Rudi.

1259
01:17:47,947 --> 01:17:48,878
Ball one.

1260
01:17:48,947 --> 01:17:51,681
That's the way to take it.
Ball one.

1261
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:54,684
<i>Let's get on, Rudi.</i>

1262
01:17:56,971 --> 01:17:59,205
<i>Take your base.</i>

1263
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:01,291
Rudi, take your base, boy.

1264
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,211
<i>Everybody moves!</i>
<i>Everybody!</i>

1265
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,515
Come on. Let's get a hit, Engelberg.

1266
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,517
Well, well, well, if it
isn't "Engelpuke."

1267
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,387
How would you like me to stick this bat
where the sun never shines?

1268
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:16,372
- Sit on it, fat ass.
- Shove it.

1269
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:19,009
Ease up, Joey.
Throw, baby.

1270
01:18:27,219 --> 01:18:28,652
Ground-rule double.

1271
01:18:30,488 --> 01:18:32,756
Stein, get back.
Get back.

1272
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:34,658
<i>It's a ground-rule double.</i>

1273
01:18:34,726 --> 01:18:36,860
<i>You can't score from first base.</i>

1274
01:18:36,929 --> 01:18:41,681
<i>Hey, Turner, why don't you build a fence</i>
<i>for players instead of chickens?</i>

1275
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,201
Keep that finger out, Engelpuke,
and I'll bust it off.

1276
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:46,953
<i>(Announcer) Jimmy Feldman</i>

1277

<i>You're holding up the game.</i>

1278
01:18:56,682 --> 01:18:57,997
<i>(Buttermaker) Go! Go! Go!</i>

1279
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,832
Throw the ball, Chris.

01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,134
<i>Go! Go!</i>

1281
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:07,423
- <i>He's safe.</i>
- One out.

1282
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:11,711
<i>You posing for a picture? You in love
with that ball or something?</i>

<i>End of the first inning.</i>

<i>(Applause)</i>

1286
01:19:25,143 --> 01:19:26,225
Safe.

1287
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:29,580
What? He was out by a mile.

1288
01:19:29,648 --> 01:19:32,582
What, do you think you got
to kiss ass around here

1289
01:19:32,651 --> 01:19:34,567
because they been here
longer than us?

1290
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:37,754
There's two teams here, umpire.
Two teams, not one.

1291
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:41,575
Don't turn your back on me. What, are
you a friend of Roy Turner's?

1292
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:49,082
You going to call like that all day, let us
know now. We may as well go home.

1293
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,084
Get a pair of glasses.

1294
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:06,767
- No. I don't want to.
- Stein, we're still in the game.

1295
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:08,502
This hurts. I don't like it.

1296
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:11,037
You don't have to get hit in the back.
Get hit in the arm or legs.

1297
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:13,540
Don't make it obvious.
Go ahead.

1298
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:17,493
<i>Rudi Stein, number ten.</i>

1299
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:20,046
James Henry won't take curveballs.

1300
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:26,053
Buttermaker, you better take Amanda out now.
She's hurting pretty bad.

1301
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,405
Yeah, I know, but she wants to play.

1302
01:20:28,473 --> 01:20:32,425
If you don't take her out,
she'll throw her arm out.

1303
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,545
- Who's managing this team, you or me?
- You.

1304
01:20:35,614 --> 01:20:39,833
Then shut up and play your position.
Let me worry about the team's health.

1305
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:43,436
What do you want me to do,
put in Rudi Stein?

1306
01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:48,074
<i>(Ogilvie) You know how he hits.</i>

1307
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:50,593
He always swings from the hip.

1308
01:20:50,662 --> 01:20:51,712
Then comes Chris Love.

1309
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:54,047
Strike.

1310
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:03,023
You're out.

1311
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:06,092
I told you not to swing,
you idiot!

1312
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:09,462
Get back here! Move it!

1313
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,331
Hey, Stein, get back in here!

1314
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:13,032

01:21:18,591 --> 01:21:20,056
Sit down, Engelberg.

What the hell is the

1319
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,043
Next time I tell you to do
something, goddamn it,

1320
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:27,814
you do it or else
you're off this team.

1321

<i>All season long, you've been</i>
<i>laughed at, crapped on!</i>

Now you've got a chance
to spit it back in their faces.

<i>And what do you do? You're out there like
a bunch of dead fish, not listening,</i>

<i>bonehead plays, mistakes.</i>

1326
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:46,066
I mean, don't you want
to beat those bastards?

1327
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,619
All right.

1328
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:27,491
Get out there now and
do the best you can.

1329
01:22:41,774 --> 01:22:43,122
Let's go, Joey!

1330
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:53,800
Strike two!

<i>What are you swinging at?</i>
<i>That was a ball, Joey!</i>

Strike!

01:23:02,928 --> 01:23:07,598
Second time in a row. Second time
in a row you struck out.

01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,858
Slide!

01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,195

1338
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,095
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Engelpuke again.

1339
01:23:38,163 --> 01:23:39,796
Shove it, Turner.

1340
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,632
<i>That's the way, Engelberg!</i>

1341
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:48,622
<i>(Umpire) Foul ball. That's outside
the line. Foul ball.</i>

1342
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:59,132
- This is the kid that got the double last time, right?
- Yeah.

1343
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:04,137
He almost whacked that right out of the ballpark,
so don't give him anything to hit at.

1344
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,139
Low and outside.
You got it?

1345
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,074
- Just pitch them low and outside.
- But--

1346
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,778
- Low and outside.
- But, Dad, I wanted to strike him out.

1347
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:13,596
<i>All right. Play ball!</i>

1348
01:24:13,665 --> 01:24:15,498
<i>Let's go, Engelberg!</i>

1349
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:24,590
<i>(Crowd booing)</i>

1350
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:25,959
Boy, that was close to my head!

1351
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:27,827
Time! Time!

1352
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,731
What's this, beanball?

1353
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:35,102
You tried to hit him, didn't you?

1354
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,603
No. It just got away.

1355
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:38,605
Don't lie to me!

1356
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:41,107
<i>You tried to hit him.</i>

1357
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:12,038
You son of a bitch.

1358
01:25:12,106 --> 01:25:14,073
He tried to bean him.
He could have killed that kid.

1359
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:19,078
You know why he threw it. I told him
to throw it low and outside.

1360
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:20,079
Oh!

1361
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,084
He could have killed that kid.

1362
01:25:31,176 --> 01:25:33,109
<i>(Buttermaker) Go, Engelberg!</i>

1363
01:25:33,178 --> 01:25:34,911
Throw the ball, Joey!

1364
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,469
He's not throwing it! Go!

1365
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,316
Throw the ball, Joey.

1366
01:25:59,054 --> 01:26:00,153
Go! Go!

1367
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:07,443
What are you doing?
Throw it!

1368
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,892
They just tied it up.

1369
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:36,082
Billy, your arm feel okay?

1370
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:41,588
Take the mound.
Chris, right field.

1371
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:45,091
Harriet!

1372
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,260
Thirteen, second base.

1373
01:27:47,329 --> 01:27:51,581
- <i>One, right field.</i>
- The score is now 3-3.

1374
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:56,118
Okay, this is the last inning.

1375
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,504
Tanner, Toby, Regi, and Jimmy,

1376
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:59,622
you're sitting on the bench.

1377
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,808
Ogilvie, Lupus,

1378
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:05,112
<i>uh, Miguel, and Jose,</i>
<i>you take their place.</i>

1379
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,529
<i>(Everyone shouting)</i>

1380
01:28:06,598 --> 01:28:10,567
Mr. Buttermaker, if I go in,
we lose the game.

1381
01:28:10,635 --> 01:28:13,070
As it is now, we still
have a chance.

1382
01:28:13,138 --> 01:28:15,072
A damn good chance,
so be on your toes.

1383
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,557
Now get the hell out of here.

1384
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,061
Ogilvie will be sitting there,

1385
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,063
putting in his asthma medicine.

1386
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,582
It's not my fault.

1387
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:27,233
Gee!

1388
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,568
Why don't we just forfeit?

1389
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,604
What did they do,

1390
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,073
<i>give him a six-pack</i>
<i>before the game?</i>

1391
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:36,960
Mr. Buttermaker, I don't know
about you, but I want to win,

1392
01:28:37,028 --> 01:28:39,796
so don't send me in.

1393
01:28:39,865 --> 01:28:42,582
Listen, Lupus, you didn't
come into this life...

1394
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,785
Just to sit around on a
dugout bench, did you?

1395
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:50,107
Get your ass out there
and do the best you can.

1396
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:57,397
<i>(Announcer) Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Parents and friends,</i>

1397
01:28:57,466 --> 01:29:02,101
<i>this is the last game of</i>
<i>the Championship Play-offs.</i>

1398
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,771
Let's give the little folks
a big hand.

1399
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,105
<i>They really deserve it.</i>

1400
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:12,562
Something's wrong with Amanda.

1401
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:15,432
I think I'd better get in
a relief pitcher.

1402
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,899
Buttermaker?

1403
01:29:16,968 --> 01:29:18,835
Oh, hiya, Whitewood.

1404
01:29:18,903 --> 01:29:20,820
Could I talk to you for a minute?

1405
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:24,023
We're busy. We got a
championship game here.

1406
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,592
I'm aware of that.

1407
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,312
<i>I've got to talk to you.</i>

1408
01:29:29,381 --> 01:29:31,114
Yeah?

1409
01:29:31,183 --> 01:29:36,085
- Listen, is it really necessary to send in that Lupus kid now?
- He hasn't played yet.

1410
01:29:36,155 --> 01:29:39,088
I know that, I know that, Buttermaker,
but we've still got a chance.

1411
01:29:39,158 --> 01:29:41,591
Well, everybody on my team
gets a chance to play.

1412
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:44,093
Oh, come on, don't give me
that righteous bullshit!

1413
01:29:44,163 --> 01:29:47,096
These kids have gone through too much
for you to throw it away now.

1414
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:49,132
We've got a chance to win.

1415
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,602
You started this thing so all the boys
would have a chance to play baseball.

1416
01:29:52,671 --> 01:29:55,688
- Look, I know why I started this!
- Not only your boy, but all the boys.

1417
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:58,090
Look, little boys hurt easily,

1418
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,192
or maybe you haven't been watching

1419
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:03,062
- what's been going on here this afternoon.
- Now get back to the stands

1420
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:07,867
before I shave off half your mustache
and shove it up your left nostril.

1421
01:30:11,106 --> 01:30:13,639
<i>(Olgilvie) All right, let's go,
let's go. Batter up.</i>

1422
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,161
Hold it!

1423
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:19,563
Time!

1424
01:30:19,631 --> 01:30:20,564
<i>Time.</i>

1425
01:30:26,137 --> 01:30:28,071
Okay, Amanda, that's it.

1426
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:30,073
There's three more outs, Boilermaker,

1427
01:30:30,141 --> 01:30:32,075
so get lost.

1428
01:30:32,143 --> 01:30:34,110
Rudi!

1429
01:30:35,647 --> 01:30:37,130
<i>(Amanda) I'm warning you.</i>

1430
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:42,569
Okay, Rudi, you're pitching.

1431
01:30:42,638 --> 01:30:44,571
Amanda, get out in left field.

1432
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,573
We have no more reserves.

1433
01:30:46,642 --> 01:30:49,092
If only my knuckler had been working,

1434
01:30:49,161 --> 01:30:51,878
<i>I would have brought</i>
<i>those turkeys down.</i>

1435
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:18,555
We still got a chance.

1436
01:31:18,624 --> 01:31:20,557
Come on.
They're doing terrible.

1437
01:31:20,626 --> 01:31:22,058
Put us back in.

1438
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:23,059
Don't worry about it.

1439
01:31:34,605 --> 01:31:36,239
Okay, Mike.

1440
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:49,085
Don't worry.
We'll catch them.

1441
01:31:49,154 --> 01:31:50,787
7-3.

1442
01:31:50,855 --> 01:31:52,071
Congratulations.

1443
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,342
Looks like the championship
is in the bag, huh?

1444
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:58,211
That's great, huh?
That's great.

1445
01:32:10,341 --> 01:32:13,259
<i>Come on, Lupus!</i>
<i>Catch it for once!</i>

1446
01:32:17,182 --> 01:32:18,348
<i>He caught it!</i>

1447
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:41,137
- If everybody gets a hit, we win the game.
- But we need five runs.

1448
01:32:41,206 --> 01:32:43,639
- Five runs? Easy.
- No chance.

1449
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:45,641
What's everybody moping about?

1450
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:48,644
- Stein, you're up, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1451
01:32:48,713 --> 01:32:50,646
Grab a cruddy bat.

1452
01:32:50,715 --> 01:32:53,733
- Watch your fingers.
- Let's go, Stein. Come on. Come on!

1453
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:07,097
<i>(Turner) He's going for two!</i>

1454
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:08,131
Out.

1455
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,837
Two to go, Billy.
We got two to go.

1456
01:33:13,905 --> 01:33:17,106
Grab a helmet and get
in the on-deck circle.

1457
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,609
I'm sorry.

1458
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,111
What are you sorry about?

1459
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,113
That was nice hustle.
Good try.

1460
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,032
Put it there.
I like that.

1461
01:33:29,154 --> 01:33:30,603
Okay, Billy, two to go.

1462
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:32,605
She's got a sore arm! Let's go!

1463
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,745
- You're out.
- All right1 Go, go!

1464
01:33:39,814 --> 01:33:42,215
<i>All right.
One to go, Billy.</i>

1465
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:46,069
Two out. Two out.
One to go.

1466
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:51,124
<i>Okay. One out to go,
and then to Pizza Hut.</i>

1467
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:54,810
All right. Batter up.

1468
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,380
- <i>(Announcer) Now batting, number nine, Albert Ogilvie.
- (Umpire) Come on now, You're holding up the game.</i>

1469
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,635
What's the matter, Ogilvie?
The plate is over there.

1470
01:34:02,704 --> 01:34:07,807
Well, without going into much detail,
I'm 0 for 14 this season.

1471
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:10,075
Aside from Timmy Lupus,

1472
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:12,578
I'm probably the worst player
in this league.

1473
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,080
Would you do me a favor, Ogilvie?

1474
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:19,084
Just shut up and get up to the plate
and try to hit the ball.

1475
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,053
Come on, batter. Let's go.
You're holding up the game!

1476
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:23,089
Okay, Mr. Buttermaker.

1477
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:28,094
Strike one.

1478
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,562
Okay, Billy, bear down now.

1479
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:31,247
<i>One out to go, babe.</i>

1480
01:34:31,316 --> 01:34:33,599
Never seen you like this, Ogilvie.

1481
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,618
<i>(Catcher) Sure ain't like algebra, is it?</i>

1482
01:34:35,687 --> 01:34:38,104
Just put it over.
He ain't swingin'.

1483
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,641
That's the way to look.
You got a piece of it.

1484
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:44,644
<i>(Umpire) The count is 0-2.</i>

1485
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:50,533
Ball.

1486
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,135
Glad you all came.

1487
01:34:52,204 --> 01:34:57,122
Frankly, I'm surprised the little marshmallows
did this well, huh? <i>(Laughs)</i>

1488
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:58,123
<i>(Umpire) 2 and 2.</i>

1489
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:02,127
- Ball.
- <i>(Turner) Okay! All right!</i>

1490
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,429
<i>(Umpire) The count is full.</i>

1491
01:35:03,498 --> 01:35:05,147
<i>(Boy) Come on, Billy!</i>

1492
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:08,200
Lose control or something?
Come on, Billy. Don't walk this man.

1493
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:16,593
Ball four. Take your base.

1494
01:35:16,661 --> 01:35:19,095
Go Ogilvie! On to first, boy!

1495
01:35:19,163 --> 01:35:20,697
Okay!

1496
01:35:20,765 --> 01:35:22,882
He walked him. He walked him.

1497
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:27,086
Get down there! <i>(Laughing)</i>

1498
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:28,588
All right!

1499
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:31,107
<i>(Buttermaker) That's the way to go.
Come on, Ahmad.</i>

1500
01:35:31,176 --> 01:35:34,610
This is for Allah. And it's going
way out there, sucker.

1501
01:35:37,248 --> 01:35:39,349
Let's go, Steve. Get it, Steve!

1502
01:35:39,417 --> 01:35:41,801
Go! Go! All right!

1503
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:43,085
Beauty!

01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:45,137
He beat him with a bunt.
Beat 'im with a bunt.

1505
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:47,356
That's a smart play, Ahmad!

1506
01:35:52,697 --> 01:35:58,118
<i>(Announcer) Now batting, number seven,
Miguel Agilar, second base.</i>

1507
01:36:02,707 --> 01:36:04,240
Ball.

1508
01:36:04,309 --> 01:36:05,692
That's it.
Way to look.

1509
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:08,427
I know he's small, Billy.
Pitch it lower.

1510
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:12,065
<i>(Umpire) Ball.</i>

1511
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:19,088
All right, Miguel.
Way to go.

1512
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:21,591
<i>(Umpire) Ball, inside.</i>

1513
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:23,092
<i>3 and 0.</i>

1514
01:36:30,168 --> 01:36:32,102
Ball four. Take your base.

1515
01:36:33,171 --> 01:36:34,103
All right, Miguel!

1516
01:36:34,172 --> 01:36:36,489
<i>(Turner) You all right, Billy?</i>

1517
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:42,095
<i>(Announcer) Now batting, number three,
Kelly Leak, center field.</i>

1518
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:45,298
Billy.

1519
01:36:50,355 --> 01:36:52,238
Hey, Turner!

1520
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:56,292
<i>What the hell are you doing,
walking a man with the bases loaded?</i>

1521
01:36:56,361 --> 01:37:00,714
You're putting the tying run
on first base, you imbecile!

1522
01:37:00,782 --> 01:37:04,783
Couldn't manage a food store. He's managing
a baseball team. Let's go.

1523
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:13,076
<i>(Crowd booing)</i>

1524
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:44,090
<i>(Man) What's the matter?
You can't pitch to him?</i>

1525
01:37:56,721 --> 01:37:57,903
Come on!

1526
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,914
You're out!

1527
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:24,563
Engelberg. Regi.

1528
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:26,565
What's this?
We're celebrating.

1529
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:30,570
- Why are we celebrating?
- Because you should be damn proud of yourselves.

1530
01:38:30,638 --> 01:38:33,540
- I'll drink to that.
- <i>Skoal.</i>

1531
01:38:33,608 --> 01:38:36,276
Would you cool it with the beer? I got
a photographer here from the <i>L.A. Times.</i>

1532
01:38:36,344 --> 01:38:39,579
I would have gotten champagne, but you
don't pay me enough to manage this team.

1533
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:41,814
- Who didn't get a beer?
- You're paying him?

1534
01:38:41,883 --> 01:38:44,567
No, he's joking.
Don't drink that.

1535
01:38:44,636 --> 01:38:48,371
Hey, Buttermaker. Maybe next spring,
you'll teach me to hit.

1536
01:38:51,059 --> 01:38:52,291
You bet.

1537
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:17,050
Buttermaker, this is
your second-place trophy.

1538
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,552
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1539
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:24,240
I know we had our differences, but at least
we settled it right here on the ball field.

1540
01:39:24,309 --> 01:39:27,476
<i>(Turner) Well, my boys would like
to say something to your team. Boys?</i>

1541
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:30,196
We just wanna say
you guys played a good game.

1542
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:34,584
<i>And... we treated you pretty unfair
all season. We want to apologize.</i>

1543
01:39:34,652 --> 01:39:37,087
We still don't think you're
all that good a baseball team,

1544
01:39:37,155 --> 01:39:40,072
<i>but you got guts. All of you.</i>

1545
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:45,795
Come on. Let's give them
a cheer, c'mon.

1546
01:39:45,864 --> 01:39:47,714
<i>(Turner) Ready? Okay.</i>

1547
01:39:47,782 --> 01:39:51,601
<i>(Yankees) Two! Four! Six! Eight!
Who do we appreciate?</i>

1548
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:54,236
<i>Bears! Bears! Yay!</i>

1549
01:39:58,543 --> 01:40:02,127
Hey, Yankees! You can take
your apology and your trophy...

1550
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:05,014
And shove it straight up your ass!

1551
01:40:07,068 --> 01:40:09,935
And another thing...
just wait till next year.

1552
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:10,987
<i>(Bears) Yay!</i>
