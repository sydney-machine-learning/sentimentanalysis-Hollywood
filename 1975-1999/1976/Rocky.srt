Hey, referee!

3
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:58,811
Why don't ya stop the fight?

Let's go!

5
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,972
Come on, hit him!

6
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,772
Throw in the towel!

7
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,260
Give the suckers some action.

8
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:46,094
You're fighting like a bum.

9
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:48,615
- You want some advice?
- Water.

10
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:51,619
Cold beer here!

11
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:54,340
Rocky, do you feel strong?

12
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:56,218
Absolutely.

13
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,738
You want some advice?

00:01:58,821 --> 00:01:59,731
Mouthpiece.

15
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,618
Keep moving to your left.

16
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:04,499
Spider, get that bum
outta there!

17
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,214
Come on, Spider!

18
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:47,613
Kill the bum!

19
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:20,090
All right.

20
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:22,934
Next, a six-rounder
between local lightweights

21
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,933
Kid Brooks and Sugar Johnson.

22
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,170
Good form, champ!

23
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,810
Hey, you got a smoke?

24
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:41,937
You can have this one.

25
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,893
You're a bum!

26
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,495
You know that? You're a bum!

27
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:17,253

Maybe two weeks.

38
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,455
Give me a call.

39
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,339
The doctor should be
about 20 minutes.

40
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:23,775
Here, boy. Here, boy.

00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,016

Ijust call it

53
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:17,898
You guys get better every year.

54
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:26,019
What I saw before

55
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:29,457
I squeezedyou, and I heldyou

56
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,500

This love affair

64
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,849
Doo-doo doo doo

65
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,171
Has taken the longest slice

66
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:52,059
From my life as I see it...

67
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:31,122
Your old man
did pretty good tonight.

68
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:34,599
Why weren't you there?
You should have seen me.

69
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:37,681
You guys hungry?

70
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,284
There you go. There you go.

71
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:47,563
You want to see your friend
Moby Dick, huh?

72
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,763
How you doing, Moby Dick?
You miss me today?

73
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,323
Here you go. Say hi.

74
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,367
If you guys
could sing and dance,

75
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,360
I wouldn't be doing this.

76
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,567
And this turtle food I got here,

77
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:25,358
this turtle food
got more flies in it.

78
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,247
There's more moths
in it than flies.

79
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,240
Who the hell cares?

80
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,522
How you feeling this morning?

81
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:50,962
Fine.

82
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,165
How you doing, killer?

83
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,319
- How's the turtle food?
- Fine.

84
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:58,242
Me, I'm kind of aggravated.

85
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,842
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:02,887
It's not your fault.
Want to hear about it?

87
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,846
Here's somebody who don't.

88
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:10,003
The last turtle food I got here
had more moths than flies.

89
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,798
These moths get caught
in the turtle's throat.

90
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,086
I got to smack them
on the shell.

91
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:19,603
What do you think they get?

92
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,327
Come on.

93
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:23,365
They get shell-shocked.

94
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,441
You're starting
with bad jokes early.

95
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:29,407
Making jokes ain't
so easy sometimes.

96
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,480
That wasn't a joke.

97
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,163
How's my buddy today?.
Yo, Butkus.

98
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,008
Give me a kiss.

99
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,798
Adrian, clean the cat cages.
They're a mess.

100
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:04,559
You got to pay for that
turtle food, Rockhead.

101
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,164
Crime don't pay.
You know that, Gloria.

102
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:33,459
- Yo, Rock. How's your boss?
- Good.

103
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,816
Rock, you fighting again?

104
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:39,416
- We'll make some money soon?
- Yeah, a million dollars.

105
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:43,060
Hey, you, where you going?

106
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:50,891
Where you going?
Where you running?

107
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,970
- Don't hit the face!
- Shut up!

108
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,212
- Mr Gazzo wants the 200 now.
- I'm broke...

109
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,180
Mr Gazzo says I should get
the 200 or break your thumb.

110
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,173
- Please! Don't...
- What's your name again?

111
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,934
- Bob.
- Listen, Bob.

112
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,899
You want to dance, pay the band.

113
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,620
You want to borrow, pay the man.

114
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,773
I ain't emotionally
involved, understand?

115
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,580
Give me some money.

116
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,575
- There's 1 30 here.
- That's all...l'm broke...

117
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:31,176
Bob, you're still $70 light.

118
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:33,536
You don't have to break nothing.

119
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,613
Take my coat.
It's worth $50, $60.

120
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,771
Take the coat.

121
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,212
You should've planned ahead.

122
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:44,855
I'll tape the hand
like you broke the thumb.

123
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:46,977
You should have planned ahead.

124
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:51,418
Gazzo don't have to know.
He won't be wise to nothing.

125
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,140
Keep the coat. Keep...

126
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:25,773
He only had 1 30, but he's good
for the rest next week.

127
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,455
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

128
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,771
That's it for today.

129
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,532
Tomorrow, collect from Del Rio.

130
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:37,853
- He's late three weeks.
- Del Rio, three weeks.

131
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:40,136
How do you spell Del Rio?

132
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:43,770
- How'd you do last night?
- I did real good.

133
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:46,455
- Did you get the number?
- Of what?

134
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,418
The truck that run
over your face.

135
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:53,450
Pull over. I want to let
Rocky out and talk to him.

136
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:18,291
Why didn't you break his thumb?

137
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:22,738
- How do you know I didn't?
- Did I give you a job or not?

138
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,211
When you don't do
what I tell you,

139
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:28,656
you make me look bad, Rock.

140
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:32,620
I figure if I break the guy's
thumb, he gets laid off.

141
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:37,217
- He can't make the pay...
- Let me do the figuring.

142
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:40,896
These guys think
we're running a charity,

143
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:44,257
From here on in,
do what I tell you,

144
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,775
because it's bad
for my reputation.

145
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:50,695
- You got it, Rock?
- I got it.

146
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,257
How do you spell Del Rio?

147
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,218
Look in a dictionary.

148
00:14:57,301 --> 00:15:01,340
I won't let that happen
no more - about the thumb.

149
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:04,452
You know.

150
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,216
So long, meatbag.

151
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:12,049
I should've broke YOUR thumbs!

152
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,666
Rock, heard you did
good last night.

153
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:45,586
- Absolutely.
- You ought to take a rest.

154
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:47,709
- My back is hurt.
- Your back?

155
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:51,342
- My back's hurt. You deaf?
- No. I'm short.

156
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:52,225
Yo, Mike, whose stuff
is this in my locker?

157
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:55,350
It's Dipper's.
Ain't your locker no more.

158
00:16:57,553 --> 00:17:01,785
It's been mine for six years.
Where's my gear?

159
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:04,023
Mickey said bag it and hang it.

160
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:10,543
You put my stuff on Skid Row.

161
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:14,911
I been in that locker six years
and you put me on Skid Row?

162
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,461
Mickey tells me what to do.

163
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,989
- Where is he?
- Working with Dipper.

164
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,031
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am l.

165
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:38,149
Put your hands up. Watch it.

166
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,667
- Mick.
- Shut up!

167
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:42,869
To the body. That-a-boy.

168
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:46,152
Time.

169
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:50,064
What do you want?

170
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,747
- How you feeling today?
- What?

171
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,301
- How you feeling?
- Are you a doctor?

172
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:58,112
- You got a problem?
- What's YOUR problem?

173
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:01,549
How come I been
put out of my locker?

174
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:05,546
Because Dipper needed it.
He's a contender.

175
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:09,023
- You're a tomato.
- A tomato?

176
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:11,832
I run a business,
not a soup kitchen.

177
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:14,108
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,787
- Did you win?
- K.O. in the second.

179
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,386
Who'd you fight?

180
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,668
Spider Rico.

181
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,391
He's a bum.

182
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:25,351
You think everybody
I fight is a bum.

183
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:29,392
Ain't they? You got heart,
but you fight like an ape.

184
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:31,862
You never got your nose busted.

185
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:35,582
Leave it that way,
and what's left of your mind.

186
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:38,346
I'm going to take a steam.

187
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,948
I did real good last night.
You should've seen me.

188
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,866
- Big deal.
- You should've seen me too.

189
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:48,025
- Ever think about retiring?
- No.

190
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:49,990
You think about it.

191
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:53,107
- Hey, lron Man.
- What?

192
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:55,468
I dig your locker.

193
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,225
Cold night.

194
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:36,510
Good night to catch pneumonia.

195
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:41,871
You need some help with that?

196
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:45,946
There's a good game
down at the Spectrum tonight.

197
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,950
Want to go
to a basketball game?

198
00:19:57,313 --> 00:20:00,544
Tough day today.
They took my locker.

199
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,625
Had it six years.
It don't bother me.

200
00:20:03,713 --> 00:20:06,227
People get the combination.

201
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:10,192
I must've had 20 bucks
taken out of there in 6 years.

202
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:12,946
It don't sound much,
but it adds up.

203
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,627
Doesn't matter. Who cares?

204
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:18,705
Whew. Cold night.

205
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:24,026
Hey, birds, look who's here -
the giant worm.

206
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:29,063
Don't these birds
look like flying candy?

207
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:31,269
Want to fly me home?

208
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:33,344
Need somebody to walk you home?

209
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,311
- No.
- It's a cold night.

210
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:40,591
If I was you, I'd take a cab.
Too many creeps around here.

211
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:44,109
Every other block,
there's a creep.

212
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:47,026
You can always tell a creep.

213
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:51,429
I'm going now.
I'll see youse later.

214
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,629
None of you guys get up.

215
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,943
You had a hard day at the cage.

216
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:59,821
So I'll go home, make up a joke.

217
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:03,189
- Good night, Adrian.
- Good night, Rocky.

218
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,492
No matter what happens...

219
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:28,213
Lefty, I got a friend
for you here.

220
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:32,263
- You seen Paulie?
- He's in the steamroom.

221
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:34,574
Rocky, what's with the eye?

222
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:37,132
- Been fightin'.
- Hope youse won it.

223
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,942
Yeah. Did real good.

224
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:42,141
The heavyweight
champion, Apollo Creed...

225
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:44,943
- Who'd you fight?
- Spider Rico.

226
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,492
Is he still around?

227
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:50,417
Yeah. He's doing
better than you are.

228
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:53,302
Paulie, did you lock the door?

229
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:57,939
I'd like to kill the moron
who broke the mirror.

230
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:01,061
Paulie, every day,
every night I pass by.

231
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:04,102
Your sister's giving me
the shoulder.

232
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,095
You can do better than her.

233
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:09,256
Every night I pass by,
I tell a joke.

234
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,778
Every morning I tell a joke.

235
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,856
- She just looks at me.
- Looks?

236
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:17,412
Like I'm a plate of leftovers.

237
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,974
I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?

238
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,419
She's a freakin' loser.

239
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:27,213
She gets me so crazy
I could split her head.

240
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,343
Don't get mental, man.
You're always in a bad mood.

241
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,540
Adrian is a loser.

242
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:35,740
She's pushing 30.

243
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:38,543
She'll end up dying alone.

244
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,821
- I'm 30 myself.
- And you'll die alone.

245
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,259
I don't see no crowd around you.

246
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:46,300
I'll kill whoever broke this.

247
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:48,375
Let's get out of this stink.

248
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,341
I want to talk to you.

249
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:54,133
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

250
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:57,057
Why don't you talk
to him about me?

251
00:22:57,144 --> 00:23:00,261
I don't think Gazzo's
hiring right now.

252
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:02,298
Come on.

253
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:07,780
The girl's drying up.

254
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:11,539
If she don't start living,
her body will dry up.

255
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,854
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

256
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:16,174
Come over and talk to her.

257
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:17,982
Sure. Beer.

258
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,659
- You come for some bird.
- You got it.

259
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:25,020
I gotta go or she'll
call the hospital.

260
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,140
- Paulie!
- I got it.

261
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:30,097
..fight with Mac Lee Green

262
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:31,902
here in Philadelphia.

263
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:35,135
You're speaking of your
much-publicised fight.

264
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:38,899
The greatest sporting event
in the country's history.

265
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,463
I'll beat Green like
he committed a crime.

266
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,899
Take a look at that guy.

267
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:46,863
Where are the real fighters,
the pros?

268
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,583
All we got today are jig clowns.

269
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:53,855
- Clown?
- That's right, clown.

270
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:55,900
Apollo Creed will duplicate

271
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,703
the cracking of the liberty bell

272
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,342
by cracking Mac Lee Green.

273
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:02,984
You calling
Apollo Creed a clown?

274
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:04,895
Just look at him.

275
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:07,179
Stay in school, use your brain.

276
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:09,255
Be a doctor, a lawyer.

277
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,733
Forget about sports
as a profession.

278
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:14,019
Sports make you grunt and smell.

279
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,220
Be a thinker, not a stinker.

280
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:19,262
This man is champion
of the world.

281
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:22,142
He took his best shot
and became champ.

282
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:24,499
What shot did you ever take?

283
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:27,621
You're not happy
with your life, that's nice.

284
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:31,617
But I got a business.
I don't have to take no shots.

285
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:35,060
No one having gone more
than 1 2 rounds with him.

286
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,419
Stick that up your business.

287
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:39,460
What are you so insulted about?

288
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,614
You want me to take a shot?

289
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:42,898
I'll take a shot.

290
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,744
- There he goes.
- Rocky, how about a bottle?

291
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,220
- No wine.
- Just a little.

292
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:03,700
Buy us a Thunderbird.

293
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:05,782
Marie, your brother know
you're hanging out?

294
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,748
Screw you, yo-yo.

295
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:10,106
These guys teach you
to talk like that?

296
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,421
- Stuff it, man.
- Come here.

297
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:20,542
When I was your age,

298
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:24,988
only one girl in the
neighbourhood talked like that.

299
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:30,109
- That makes your teeth yellow.
- I like yellow teeth.

300
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:33,342
- It makes your breath garbage.
- Maybe I like garbage.

301
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,262
Nobody likes garbage.

302
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:37,990
This girl wasn't bad-looking,

303
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:41,347
but none of the guys
took her serious.

304
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:43,387
- Why?
- That's how guys are.

305
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:47,862
They laugh when you talk dirty,
but you get a reputation.

306
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,987
You get no respect.

307
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:51,948
I got to use a bad word.

308
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:53,862
Whore. You understand?

309
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:58,581
You use dirty words and maybe
end up becoming a whore.

310
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,060
Come on, Rocky, I'm just 1 2.

311
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:04,780
That don't matter.
You don't have to BE one.

312
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:07,863
Just act like one,
and that's it.

313
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:11,910
20 years from now,
people will say,

314
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:14,300
"Do you remember Marie,

315
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:17,747
"the little whore
at the hoagie shop."

316
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:19,901
"Oh, yeah, I remember her."

317
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:24,303
They don't remember YOU,
they remember the rep.

318
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,661
Hey, you got a boyfriend?

319
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,662
You ain't got a boyfriend.

320
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,140
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

321
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:35,348
'Cause you hang out
with them coconuts.

322
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:38,389
Hang around with coconuts,
you'll get nowhere.

323
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,430
Hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends.

324
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:46,550
Hang out with yo-yos,
you get yo-yo friends.

325
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:48,906
See, it's simple mathematics.

326
00:26:49,631 --> 00:26:51,986
I hope you ain't...

327
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:55,302
You hope I don't become a whore.

328
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:56,824
Something like that.

329
00:26:56,911 --> 00:26:58,663
- Goodnight, Rocky.
- Goodnight.

330
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:02,343
Screw you, creep-o.

331
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:13,470
Yeah. Who are you
to give advice, creep-o?

332
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,667
Are the doctor's
reports confirmed?

333
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,740
Definitely.

334
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:39,109
"Mac Lee Green has a
severely cracked metacarpal

335
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,783
"in his left hand."

336
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:42,190
Damn.

337
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:46,742
We can cancel the fight if
you're set on fighting Green.

338
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,665
What about all the time
Apollo's invested?

339
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:52,707
We can find a solution.

340
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:56,545
Find me another
ranked contender.

341
00:27:56,631 --> 00:28:00,624
Apollo's already done
$1 million worth of publicity,

342
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:05,068
has contracts with
20 different organisations.

343
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:09,349
Ernie Roman's fighting
in France that week.

344
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:12,070
Get Buddy Shaw.
He's ranked fifth.

345
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:15,029
Went to California
and gained 50 pounds.

346
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:18,342
I got hold of every
worthwhile contender.

347
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,628
Five weeks isn't enough
time to get into shape.

348
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:23,702
Shape nothing. They're afraid.

349
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:27,227
Everybody in the world
will see this fight.

350
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:31,190
They don't want to be
the chump that gets whipped.

351
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:34,581
All I can say is
I'm a good promoter.

352
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,869
I've promoted fights
in every country in the world

353
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:42,830
but I don't know
what the hell else to do.

354
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,622
I do.

355
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:54,627
Without a ranked contender,
this fight needs a novelty.

356
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:56,622
This is the land of opportunity.

357
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:58,303
So Apollo Creed,

358
00:28:58,391 --> 00:28:59,983
on January 1 st,

359
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,381
gives a local underdog
fighter an opportunity.

360
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:07,464
A snow-white underdog,
on this poster with me.

361
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:10,987
I'll tell you why -
because I'm sentimental.

362
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:14,825
So are a lot of other people
in this country.

363
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:19,507
They'd like to see Apollo Creed
give a local Philadelphia boy

364
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,627
a shot at the title.

365
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:23,941
That's the way I see it.

366
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:27,068
That's the way it's going to be.

367
00:29:27,151 --> 00:29:31,224
Apollo, I like it.
It's very American.

368
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,508
No, Jergens, it's very smart.

369
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:59,149
What is it?

370
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,142
I just want to check.

371
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:03,791
Pick up 2 yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli.

372
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:07,944
No, 2 yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

373
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:10,499
- Write it down.
- I got it.

374
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:13,742
Who's this girl
you're going out with tomorrow?

375
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:16,299
- How'd you know?
- I hear things.

376
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:19,588
A lot of canaries
flying around the docks.

377
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm going out
with Paulie's sister.

378
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,141
I hear she's retarded.

379
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:26,142
She ain't retarded. She's shy.

380
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:28,620
Take her to the zoo.

381
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,781
Retards like the zoo.

382
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,864
- This bum got to say that?
- Who you calling a bum?

383
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:37,943
Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.

384
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:40,670
You ought to count
your blessings.

385
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,423
You're still healthy.

386
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:45,947
- Kiss my ass!
- Get out of the car!

387
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:48,067
Relax, relax.

388
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:51,780
You're driving me crazy,
both of youse.

389
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:54,902
Buddy doesn't like you.

390
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:58,142
Some guys, they just
hate for no reason.

391
00:31:00,711 --> 00:31:04,545
Here's 50 bucks.
You and Adrian have a nice time.

392
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:07,862
Thanks. How'd you know her name?

393
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,146
You don't think I hear things?

394
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:15,185
Remember what I told you.
Take her to the zoo.

395
00:31:23,694 --> 00:31:26,254
- More coffee, Mr Creed?
- No thanks, Shirley.

396
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:29,804
- What about Billy Snow?
- Fouls.

397
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:34,808
- How about Big Chuck Smith?
- He's too old and dull.

398
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,328
Bobby Judge is a good boy.

399
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:40,133
I don't feel heat
from that name.

400
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:42,125
Joe Zack's a good prospect.

401
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:45,411
Exactly what are you
looking for, Apollo?

402
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:47,883
This is what I'm looking for.

403
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,930
The ltalian Stallion.

404
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:53,211
"Rocky Balboa"?
Never heard of him.

405
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:55,410
It's the name, man -

406
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:59,487
"The ltalian Stallion"
The media will eat it up.

407
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:02,213
Who discovered America?
An ltalian.

408
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:05,923
Let's get it on
with a descendent.

409
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:10,929
I don't want you
messing with southpaws.

410
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,608
I'll drop him in three.

411
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:18,129
Apollo Creed meets
the ltalian Stallion.

412
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:20,284
Sounds like a monster movie.

413
00:32:22,202 --> 00:32:22,682
What are you doing
with that bat?

414
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:25,242
What are you doing
with that bat?

415
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:28,519
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- She's very excited.

416
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:30,832
Look at these swollen hands,

417
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:35,518
from carrying meat
in and out of the freezer.

418
00:32:35,602 --> 00:32:39,834
- You ought to see a doctor.
- I need a different job.

419
00:32:39,922 --> 00:32:42,311
What kind of turkey,
big or small?

420
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:46,600
Tell Gazzo I'm a good man
and nothing bothers me.

421
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:50,277
Busting bones don't bother me.

422
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,239
Big turkey, right?

423
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:55,155
Forget Gazzo. It's a bad job.

424
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,914
You got a match?

425
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:59,596
Go to him for me, as a favour.

426
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:02,754
Yeah. Last time I had a turkey,

427
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:07,597
they were having a $2.00
special at Horn Hardart's.

428
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:17,351
Your sister knows I'm coming?

429
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,512
Yeah, she's very excited.

430
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:24,752
Hey, forget about Gazzo.

431
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,912
I don't ask nobody twice.

432
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:29,152
You don't ask nobody twice.

433
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:31,551
Stay away, baby...

434
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:36,193
You sure your sister
knows I'm coming?

435
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:39,194
- Yeah, she's very excited.
- Yeah?

436
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:43,077
Paulie, you're late.

437
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:45,039
Did you call the hospital?

438
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,795
She calls the hospital
if I'm late.

439
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:51,150
Yo, how are you doing?

440
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:53,997
I told you she's very excited.

441
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:59,076
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him?

442
00:33:59,162 --> 00:33:59,958
I'm not ready for this.

443
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:03,921
He's a friend.
He's taking you out.

444
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,754
I can't.

445
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,754
I want you out
of the kitchen now.

446
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:10,912
I won't.

447
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:20,357
I'm sick of seeing you
hang around like a spider.

448
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:24,594
- Go out and enjoy life.
- Paulie, I can't go!

449
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:26,593
Don't get wise with me.

450
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:28,752
I'm tired of you being a loser.

451
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:30,753
Don't call me that, Paulie.

452
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:34,152
Apollo Creed is shopping
for another victim

453
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:36,802
for the bicentennial
championship fight.

454
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:41,997
I'm not going to go,
Paulie. I won't go!

455
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,720
Why?

456
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:47,920
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

457
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,119
Oh, a turkey in the oven.

458
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,393
You want the bird?

459
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,598
Go in the alley and eat it.

460
00:35:11,722 --> 00:35:13,758
I want you out of here!

461
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:15,434
Get outta here!

462
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:17,911
Enjoy your freakin' life.

463
00:35:21,682 --> 00:35:23,559
You hungry, Rock?

464
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,477
Maybe we just better
forget all this.

465
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:37,157
Forget nothing.
Tell her something funny.

466
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:40,951
She's in a bad mood,
I'm in a bad mood.

467
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,954
- You want to go out with her?
- Yeah.

468
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:51,194
- I don't know what to say.
- Funny.

469
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:06,160
Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.
Rocky, you know?

470
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:11,318
Listen...
I don't know what to say

471
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:15,077
'cause I ain't never
talked to no door before.

472
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:20,274
- Hey, forget it.
- You're doing fine.

473
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,637
I look like an idiot.

474
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,633
Keep doing what you're doing.

475
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:26,952
I know all about these things.

476
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:28,953
I feel like a jerk.

477
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:36,710
Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.

478
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:40,954
I know you ain't
too happy at this moment.

479
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:43,272
But could you do me a favour?

480
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:46,559
I got nobody to spend
Thanksgiving with.

481
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:50,317
So maybe we could
go out together,

482
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:54,031
get something to eat,
maybe laugh a little bit.

483
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:55,874
Would you like to...

484
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:01,960
Would you like to maybe,
you and me, go out together?

485
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:11,840
We'll have a good time,
a real good time, Adrian.

486
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:17,713
Thanks for the bird.

487
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:24,912
I'll turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

488
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:38,839
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice skate.

489
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:42,232
Adrian, come on.
You're letting the heat out.

490
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:51,153
Listen, I don't want
no turkey anyway.

491
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:54,713
But it was Thanksgiving.

492
00:37:54,802 --> 00:37:57,600
- It was what?
- Thanksgiving.

493
00:37:57,682 --> 00:38:00,640
Yeah, to you.
But to me it's Thursday.

494
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,063
Yo, looks kind of quiet.

495
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,540
- I think it's closed.
- I think we're just early.

496
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,349
Yo! We're closed!

497
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,625
- What?
- I said we're closed.

498
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,464
Listen, I'm going
to smooth this guy out.

499
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,383
- We could go someplace else.
- It's OK.

500
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,463
You closed to the general
public or to everybody?

501
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,906
It's after 6.00.
It's Thanksgiving.

502
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,063
So do me a favour
and not stay here.

503
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,300
Could you do me a favour?

504
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,665
Hey, we're not operating.

505
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,867
This girl here
ain't feeling well.

506
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,260
Doctors say she should
go out and exercise.

507
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,386
What do you want from me?

508
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:12,625
If you could let her
on the ice, I'd appreciate it.

509
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,507
1 0 minutes, 1 0 bucks.

510
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,501
How about eight bucks?

511
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,660
Come on, it's Thanksgiving.

512
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,741
All right, nine bucks.

513
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,981
You'll have the ice
to yourself. 1 0 bucks.

514
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,346
Give me the blades.

515
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,700
Aren't you skating?

516
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,746
I ain't skated since I was 1 5.

517
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,105
That's when I started fighting.

518
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,784
Skating's bad for the ankles.

519
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,987
You're a pretty good
skater, are you?

520
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,584
Like I was saying,

521
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,549
fighting used to be tops
for me, but no more.

522
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,101
All I wanted was to prove
I could make a good pro.

523
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,181
You never got the chance?

524
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,580
I ain't crying about it
because I still fight.

525
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,901
- But I'm a southpaw.
- What's a southpaw?

526
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,981
It means you're left-handed.

527
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,187
Other guys,
it throws their timing off,

528
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,545
makes them look awkward.

529
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,190
You know where
southpaw came from?

530
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,101
A long time ago,

531
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,468
there was this guy fighting
around Philadelphia.

532
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,223
He was left-handed,

533
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,108
and his arm was facing
towards New Jersey.

534
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,944
That's south, so naturally
they called him south paw.

535
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,262
Southpaw, South Jersey,
South Camden, southpaw.

536
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,420
Things probably
worked out for the best.

537
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,070
Never got a chance
because you're left-handed?

538
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,947
That's absolutely true.

539
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,258
Watch out.

540
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,226
I just dislocated my finger.

541
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,948
Look at that.

542
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,509
It ain't your fault.
That's an old wound.

543
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,219
You see that?
It bends like that.

544
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,870
Push the button. Bong.
It works.

545
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,066
I'll show you something.

546
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,742
Seven minutes!

547
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,821
I keep pictures of my fights.

548
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,902
I done it in the
Baby Crenshaw fight.

549
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,062
I broke both my hands
on his face.

550
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,029
I lost that fight,
but that's a nice picture.

551
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,066
You having a good time?

552
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,022
You can see I ain't
too graceful.

553
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,748
I don't move well.

554
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,219
But I can really hit hard.

555
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,063
But nobody wants
to fight no southpaw.

556
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,827
You know how I got
started in fighting?

557
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,184
No.

558
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,181
Am I talking too loud?

559
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,101
Three minutes!

560
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,978
My father -
he was never too smart -

561
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,619
He says to me, "You weren't
born with much of a brain,

562
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,587
"so you better use your body."

563
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,662
So I become a fighter,
you know?

564
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,945
Why are you laughing?

565
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:02,502
- My mother said the opposite.
- What did she say?

566
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,299
She said, "You weren't born
with much of a body,

567
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,904
"so you better
develop your brain."

568
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,582
Yo! Time!

569
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,380
Can I ask you a question?

570
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,789
Absolutely.

571
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,430
Why do you want to fight?

572
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,263
Because
I can't sing or dance.

573
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,222
Don't fall!

574
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,223
I'm pretty good at this.
You like the way I skate?

575
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,020
Last fight I had, with Spider
Rico, he busted my head here.

576
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,739
Things get pretty rough
in the ring.

577
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,865
Some people are very shy
by nature, you know?

578
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,100
I suppose.

579
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,902
I say you're very shy
by nature, you know?

580
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,628
I suppose.

581
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,779
The bum from the dark.
Get a job.

582
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,983
Some people think
being shy is a disease,

583
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,026
but it don't bother me none.

584
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,305
Don't bother me, either.

585
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,508
Why did I bring it up?
Because I'm dumb.

586
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,265
We make a real sharp
couple of coconuts.

587
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,147
I'm dumb, you're shy.

588
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,024
Why would anybody
want to be a fighter?

589
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:33,343
You got to be a moron
to want to be a fighter.

590
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,866
You're almost guaranteed
to end up a bum.

591
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,384
I don't think you're a bum.

592
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,304
I'm at least half a bum,
but I'll tell you something.

593
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:47,747
Worst thing about fighting
is the morning after.

594
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:52,506
The morning after a fight,
you're like a large wound.

595
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,706
I feel like calling a taxi

596
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,862
to take me from the bed
to the bathroom.

597
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,819
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,
your face is busted up.

598
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,980
Look at this face... 64 fights.

599
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,947
See that nose?

600
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,669
That nose ain't
never been broken.

601
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,663
I had guys chewing on it,
twisting it, punching it.

602
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,504
These guys are hitting
my nose all the time.

603
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,548
Never broke. I'm proud of that.

604
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,940
- Why do it if it hurts?
- Why do you think?

605
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:28,660
'Cause you can't sing or dance.

606
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,025
Yeah, something like that.

607
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,146
Want to come inside?

608
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,581
No, I got to go.

609
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,549
Come on. I got these
very rare animals inside.

610
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,019
No, I got to go.

611
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,023
I got to go to
the bathroom. Come on.

612
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,021
No, I got to go.

613
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:53,223
Is this a face you can trust?

614
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,905
They ought to stick
this face on a stamp.

615
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,740
Come on. Come on in.

616
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,307
Come on.

617
00:45:26,698 --> 00:45:28,336
Click.

618
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,854
Are you hungry?

619
00:45:34,938 --> 00:45:36,337
No.

620
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:40,457
If you like soda,
some doughnuts or something.

621
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:43,052
I got a couple of cupcakes, huh?

622
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:47,012
I think I got some
chocolate in there. No?

623
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,893
Hot in here, you know?

624
00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:01,253
I could go for some music.

625
00:46:08,138 --> 00:46:10,527
These are the exotic animals.

626
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:13,132
These are my friends
Cuff and Link.

627
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:16,767
- I sold them to you.
- I know you did.

628
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:21,648
The first day you worked
at that pet shop,

629
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:23,808
I bought both these animals.

630
00:46:23,898 --> 00:46:27,334
I bought this bowl
and I bought the animals,

631
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:30,057
some food, the marbles.

632
00:46:30,138 --> 00:46:31,776
Remember that mountain?

633
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:35,373
I got rid of it
'cause it kept falling over.

634
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:41,614
Why don't you come
over here and sit down?

635
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:44,175
It's a nice couch.

636
00:46:44,298 --> 00:46:45,651
I don't know.

637
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:50,691
There's big bugs there.
It's safer here.

638
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:54,894
You want to sit down?

639
00:47:00,658 --> 00:47:02,933
These your parents?

640
00:47:03,018 --> 00:47:04,770
Yeah, that's them.

641
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:07,736
- Is this you?
- Yeah. I was eight.

642
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:10,286
The ltalian Stallion as a baby.

643
00:47:12,218 --> 00:47:16,450
Why don't you come on over
and make yourself comfortable?

644
00:47:20,578 --> 00:47:22,409
Do you have a phone?

645
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:27,208
No. I had it pulled 'cause
people calling all the time.

646
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:29,573
Who needs the aggravation?

647
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,774
Who did you want to call?

648
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:34,213
I want to call my brother.

649
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:36,566
Why?

650
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:39,809
I think he might be worried.

651
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,537
I'll call your brother.

652
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:50,371
Paulie, your sister's with me!
I'll call youse later.

653
00:47:56,058 --> 00:47:58,652
You don't like the room, do you?

654
00:47:58,738 --> 00:48:02,094
- It's fine.
- It's only temporary.

655
00:48:02,178 --> 00:48:04,169
It's not that.

656
00:48:07,978 --> 00:48:10,014
What's the problem?

657
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:13,647
You don't like me?
You don't like the turtles?

658
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:17,128
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's OK.

659
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:20,734
I don't belong here.

660
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:24,650
Well, it's OK,
'cause you're my guest.

661
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:28,616
I don't know you well enough.

662
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:32,373
I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.

663
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:37,097
Well, they're all
the same, you know?

664
00:48:40,658 --> 00:48:43,934
I'm not sure
I know you well enough.

665
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:47,532
I don't feel comfortable.

666
00:48:47,618 --> 00:48:50,735
Yo, Adrian, I ain't
so comfortable, either.

667
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:54,975
- I should go.
- Don't go, please.

668
00:49:02,298 --> 00:49:04,095
Do me a favour.

669
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:06,976
- What?
- Take off these glasses.

670
00:49:10,098 --> 00:49:12,896
You have nice eyes, you know?

671
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:16,454
Do me another favour.

672
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:19,610
Why don't you
take off that hat?

673
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:28,210
I always knew you was pretty.

674
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:31,968
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.

675
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:40,411
I just...want to kiss you.

676
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:47,327
You don't have to kiss me back,
but I want to kiss you.

677
00:50:57,098 --> 00:51:01,137
- You got a fight coming up?
- Yeah, next month.

678
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:05,928
Come to the gym, man.
We'll get you in shape.

679
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:10,409
Rock, how are you doing?
Mick was looking for you.

680
00:51:10,498 --> 00:51:14,696
- For me? You sure?
- Yeah, he was looking for you.

681
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:19,294
Your name's Rocky, right?
All right. Go on.

682
00:51:33,578 --> 00:51:35,455
You got something for me?

683
00:51:35,538 --> 00:51:39,451
Yeah, they need sparring
partners for Apollo Creed.

684
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:41,893
- Here's the card.
- When was they here?

685
00:51:41,978 --> 00:51:43,457
About an hour ago.

686
00:51:43,538 --> 00:51:46,211
They probably need
sparring partners.

687
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:48,573
I said that, you dumb dago!

688
00:51:50,018 --> 00:51:54,614
For six years you've been
sticking it to me. How come?

689
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:57,610
- You don't want to know.
- I want to know.

690
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,576
- You want to know?
- I want to know!

691
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:02,330
OK, I'll tell you.

692
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:05,694
You had the talent
to be a good fighter,

693
00:52:05,778 --> 00:52:09,657
not a leg-breaker
for some cheap loan-shark.

694
00:52:09,738 --> 00:52:11,649
It's a living.

695
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:13,456
It's a waste of life.

696
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,424
Yes, may I help you?

697
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,545
You must be Mr Rocky Balboa.

698
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,781
Mr Jergens is expecting you.
Just a moment.

699
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,669
Mr Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

700
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,541
Please go in, Mr Balboa.

701
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,825
- Can I have that?
- Certainly.

702
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,309
Thanks.

703
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,504
How are you? George Jergens.
Take a chair, please.

704
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,023
Thanks.

705
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:14,025
- Mr Balboa.
- Call me Rocky.

706
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,386
Tell me, Rocky,
do you have a manager?

707
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,586
Uh, no. Just me.

708
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,782
Well, Rocky, I've got
a proposition to make to you.

709
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,101
- About sparring?
- I beg your pardon.

710
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:31,148
I know you're looking
for sparring partners.

711
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,461
- I'm very available.
- I'm sure you are.

712
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,179
Sparring with the champion
would be an honour,

713
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,579
and I wouldn't take
no cheap shots.

714
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:45,346
You don't understand me, Rocky.
My proposition's this...

715
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,706
Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed

716
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,987
for the world
heavyweight championship?

717
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,748
No.

718
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:01,069
Listen, Rocky,
Apollo's seen you fight.

719
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,306
He likes you.
He wants to fight you.

720
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:08,348
It's just that,
I fight in clubs.

721
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,341
I'm really a ham and egger.

722
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,867
This guy's the best.
It wouldn't be a good fight.

723
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,589
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

724
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,061
Rocky, do you believe America
is the land of opportunity?.

725
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,178
Yeah.

726
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,305
Apollo Creed does,
and he's going to prove it

727
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,666
by giving an unknown
a shot at the title,

728
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,264
and that unknown is you.

729
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,466
He picked you, Rocky.

730
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:40,179
Rocky, it's the chance
of a lifetime.

731
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:45,069
You can't pass it by.
What do you say?

732
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:54,177
We want to ask Apollo
a few questions.

733
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:57,776
How do you like the City
of Brotherly Love?

734
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,297
Just being in Philadelphia
makes me feel patriotic.

735
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,100
Beautiful people
and beautiful city.

736
00:55:04,181 --> 00:55:06,695
I'm proud to be an American.

737
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,772
Apollo, why did you agree

738
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:11,898
to fight a man who has
no chance of winning?

739
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:13,892
American history proves

740
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:17,940
that everybody's
got a chance to win.

741
00:55:18,021 --> 00:55:21,570
Didn't you ever hear
of Bunker Hill?

742
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:27,258
Apollo, is it coincidence that
you're fighting a white man?

743
00:55:27,341 --> 00:55:32,574
Is it a coincidence
that he's fighting a black man?

744
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:38,700
Apollo, how do you feel
about your challenger?

745
00:55:38,781 --> 00:55:41,341
Come here, Rock. My main man.

746
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,458
- Rocky, ain't you ltalian?
- Yeah, I'm ltalian.

747
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:48,500
If he can't fight,
I bet he can cook.

748
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:52,535
His lungs, punch out.

749
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:57,849
Rocky, how do you expect
to fight Apollo Creed?

750
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:01,820
Creed's the best.
I'll do the best I can.

751
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,857
Rocky, just between us,

752
00:56:03,941 --> 00:56:07,411
where did you get
the name ltalian Stallion?

753
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:11,699
I invented that eight years ago
when I was eating dinner.

754
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:15,660
Rocky, your pay-day
will be $1 50,000.

755
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:17,572
Any comment?

756
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:21,535
You got no comment,
Rocky, right?

757
00:56:21,621 --> 00:56:23,771
- No.
- No comment. Thank you.

758
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:26,739
I want to say "Hi"
to my girlfriend.

759
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:29,335
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

760
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:34,296
Do you believe all this?

761
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:38,294
- Thank you, Rocky.
- Quit pushing, man!

762
00:56:38,581 --> 00:56:43,496
He's making you out a fool.
I'd break his lips.

763
00:56:43,581 --> 00:56:45,492
Don't bother me.

764
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:50,416
I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.

765
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:54,699
- Help what?
- Keep you living a clean life.

766
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,931
I do OK, you know.

767
00:56:57,021 --> 00:57:00,491
You need someone
to help with the exercise

768
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:02,651
or stand by with a towel.

769
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:05,972
Who cared about me
yesterday?. Nobody.

770
00:57:06,061 --> 00:57:07,938
I'll train myself.

771
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:09,852
Without good people to help,

772
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:12,011
you don't have
such a good chance.

773
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:15,298
Einstein flunked
out of school twice.

774
00:57:15,381 --> 00:57:16,780
That so?

775
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:21,218
Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.

776
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:23,337
Rocky's got a good chance.

777
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:31,095
Want me to get you a beer?

778
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:35,493
Want to do a good deed?
Keep out of my life!

779
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:40,701
- Did I say something wrong?
- You didn't say nothing.

780
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:44,330
Right! You didn't
say nothing at all!

781
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:47,532
I got to go.

782
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:51,659
Where's the freakin' pretzels?

783
00:57:52,861 --> 00:57:57,332
Where's the pretzels?
Ain't we got any beer?

784
00:57:57,421 --> 00:58:01,050
You were supposed
to pick up some beer.

785
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:11,414
How'd you like hearing
your name on TV?

786
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:16,291
I was shocked.
Why did you do that?

787
00:58:16,381 --> 00:58:17,939
You're putting me on.

788
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:19,579
Absolutely.

789
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:21,652
What time should I expect you?

790
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:23,174
About 7.00.

791
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:45,020
You know how I said that stuff
on TV didn't bother me?

792
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:46,295
Yeah.

793
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:50,300
It did.

794
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:06,298
I want to know if you got
any money for training expenses.

795
00:59:06,381 --> 00:59:10,260
- I got a few dollars.
- Put this in your glove.

796
00:59:10,341 --> 00:59:12,616
- What's this?
- 500 bucks.

797
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:16,052
You ain't never had any luck,

798
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:19,497
but this time Lady Luck
may be in your corner.

799
00:59:19,581 --> 00:59:23,051
Maybe. Thanks
for the money, Tony.

800
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:26,292
- Don't worry about it.
- Thanks a lot.

801
00:59:26,381 --> 00:59:28,656
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

802
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:30,618
You're in training.

803
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,177
- Yo, Tony.
- What?

804
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:42,657
You coming to the fight?

805
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:44,254
Ringside.

806
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:47,732
I'll see ya.

807
01:00:21,297 --> 01:00:22,491
Yeah?

808
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,645
Hello, kid. I seen
your light. Can I come in?

809
01:00:31,737 --> 01:00:33,773
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, good.

810
01:00:33,857 --> 01:00:37,736
This is a nice place.
All right, anyway.

811
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:42,095
I came to tell you
that what happened to you

812
01:00:42,177 --> 01:00:44,133
is freak luck.

813
01:00:44,217 --> 01:00:47,209
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Look at the other guys.

814
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:50,175
They're good fighters.
They're colourful.

815
01:00:50,257 --> 01:00:53,374
They fight their guts
out for peanuts.

816
01:00:53,457 --> 01:00:56,927
But you get a shot at the title.

817
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:59,577
Freak luck is a strange thing.

818
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,966
- Can I sit down?
- Sure.

819
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:07,569
- What the hell are those?
- They're domestic turtles.

820
01:01:07,657 --> 01:01:10,455
One is Cuff
and the other is Link.

821
01:01:10,537 --> 01:01:12,493
They make good soup.

822
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,456
Look, I'm here to warn you

823
01:01:17,537 --> 01:01:21,849
to be very careful
about this shot you got,

824
01:01:21,937 --> 01:01:24,246
because, like the Bible says,

825
01:01:24,337 --> 01:01:26,771
you won't get a second chance.

826
01:01:26,857 --> 01:01:28,927
Yeah. All right.

827
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:31,053
You thought of that?

828
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:34,971
Well, what you need
is a manager.

829
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:40,455
I know because I've been
in this racket for 50 years.

830
01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:43,449
- 50 years?
- God, I've seen it all.

831
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:45,255
All of it.

832
01:01:45,337 --> 01:01:49,296
You know what I done?
I have done it all.

833
01:01:49,377 --> 01:01:54,246
You should have seen me knock
Guinea Russell out of the ring.

834
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:56,976
That's September 1 4th, 1 923,

835
01:01:57,057 --> 01:02:01,175
the same night Firpo knocks
Dempsey out of the ring.

836
01:02:01,257 --> 01:02:03,293
So who gets the publicity?

837
01:02:03,377 --> 01:02:05,333
- Dempsey.
- Right, but why?

838
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:09,456
- 'Cause he was champ.
- No, 'cause he had a manager!

839
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:10,936
I had nothing.

840
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:14,009
I want you to look at my face.

841
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,533
I got 2 1 stitches
over this left eye.

842
01:02:17,617 --> 01:02:20,529
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

843
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:23,450
I had my nose busted 1 7 times.

844
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:27,655
The last time was with
that fight with Sailor Mike.

845
01:02:27,737 --> 01:02:30,331
I got the clipping here.

846
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,294
Want to read that?

847
01:02:32,817 --> 01:02:34,728
Well, it doesn't matter.

848
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:38,287
Anyway, he put
this vegetation on my ear.

849
01:02:43,577 --> 01:02:47,365
You kind of remind me
of the Rock.

850
01:02:47,457 --> 01:02:49,766
- You really think so?
- Right.

851
01:02:49,857 --> 01:02:52,735
You move like him,
and you got heart.

852
01:02:52,817 --> 01:02:56,332
I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker.

853
01:02:59,337 --> 01:03:01,487
Uh, anyway...

854
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:05,126
When I begun
in this business, kid...

855
01:03:05,217 --> 01:03:08,732
Look, kid, I want
to make a suggestion.

856
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:12,207
Don't drink that piss
before a fight.

857
01:03:12,297 --> 01:03:15,130
If you don't mind my saying.

858
01:03:15,217 --> 01:03:19,608
When I started this racket,
us pugs were treated like dogs.

859
01:03:19,697 --> 01:03:23,656
For 1 0 bucks, you got
to tear somebody's throat out.

860
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,567
One time, this son
of a bitch that I fought

861
01:03:28,657 --> 01:03:30,534
put a nail right there.

862
01:03:30,617 --> 01:03:32,528
- His thumb?
- Yeah, the glove.

863
01:03:32,617 --> 01:03:37,645
He punched holes in my face.
I spat through my cheeks.

864
01:03:37,737 --> 01:03:39,773
Can you imagine that?

865
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:44,009
I'll tell you what
I looked like in my prime.

866
01:03:44,097 --> 01:03:46,133
I want you to look at something.

867
01:03:46,217 --> 01:03:50,415
That's the way I looked
before these guys got at me.

868
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:54,012
You didn't take very good
care of the picture.

869
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:58,215
I never had no management,
that's the trouble.

870
01:03:58,297 --> 01:04:00,492
I got all this
knowledge up here.

871
01:04:00,577 --> 01:04:02,807
I want to give it to you.

872
01:04:02,897 --> 01:04:07,129
I want to make sure all
the shit that happened to me

873
01:04:07,217 --> 01:04:09,447
doesn't happen to you.

874
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:11,935
The fight's set.

875
01:04:12,017 --> 01:04:14,167
I want to be your manager.

876
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:18,170
- You follow that?
- I don't need no manager.

877
01:04:18,257 --> 01:04:21,329
You can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.

878
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:24,966
- I got pain and experience.
- I got that too.

879
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,013
Now, listen, kid...

880
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,655
- Hey, Mick.
- What?

881
01:04:28,737 --> 01:04:32,252
I needed your help
about 1 0 years ago.

882
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:34,897
You never helped me.

883
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:40,415
If you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me?

884
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:43,887
I asked, but you
never heard nothing.

885
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:51,567
I know l...l'm 76 years old.

886
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:35,974
Took him 1 0 years
to come to my house.

887
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,969
What's the matter,
you don't like my house?

888
01:05:39,057 --> 01:05:43,209
My house stinks?
Right, it stinks!

889
01:05:43,297 --> 01:05:48,530
I didn't ask
no favours from you!

890
01:05:48,617 --> 01:05:52,895
Talk about your prime.
What about my prime, Mick?

891
01:05:52,977 --> 01:05:55,696
At least you had a prime.

892
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:57,733
I ain't had nothing!

893
01:05:57,817 --> 01:06:01,093
Legs are going,
everything's going.

894
01:06:01,177 --> 01:06:03,054
Guy offers me a fight.

895
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:05,492
I'll fight the big fight.

896
01:06:05,577 --> 01:06:09,172
I'm gonna go
and fight that big fight.

897
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,532
I'm gonna get that!

898
01:06:11,617 --> 01:06:16,293
And you want to be
ringside and see it?

899
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:19,733
Want to see me
get my face kicked in?

900
01:06:19,817 --> 01:06:23,207
Go on, fight the champ!

901
01:06:23,297 --> 01:06:25,288
Yeah, I'll fight him.

902
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:29,967
Get my face kicked in.

903
01:06:30,057 --> 01:06:33,094
You want to move
in here with me?

904
01:06:33,177 --> 01:06:35,088
Come on! It's a nice house.

905
01:06:35,177 --> 01:06:36,974
Come on in.

906
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:41,209
It stinks!
This whole place stinks.

907
01:06:42,137 --> 01:06:45,766
Want to help me out?
Well, help me out.

908
01:06:45,857 --> 01:06:47,893
I'm standing here.

909
01:07:44,429 --> 01:07:46,659
It's only about 28 degrees.

910
01:07:46,749 --> 01:07:49,388
We'll check that forecast.

911
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:51,380
I'm feeling very weird.

912
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:54,381
I got vinyl seats in my car.

913
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:58,781
When I hit those seats
this morning, I went, whoo!

914
01:07:58,869 --> 01:08:03,306
If I'm up, everybody in the
Delaware Valley should be up.

915
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:07,268
At 4.03 in the morning,
what else can you do?

916
01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:13,501
Mrs Kramer,
this is Don Cabot, WYBG.

917
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:18,060
You have a lot of nerve
calling me at this hour!

918
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:19,946
Goodbye.

919
01:08:31,789 --> 01:08:35,668
We got Mrs Kramer up,
and it's a good morning.

920
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:40,425
28 degrees,
and it's cold out there.

921
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:44,707
Our high today
could possibly be 30.

922
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:49,146
Tonight, we're back down
in the 20-degree range.

923
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:51,663
Tomorrow, we may hit 40.

924
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:56,539
It's awfully chilly, so make
sure you have it bundled up.

925
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:17,708
It stinks in here, you know?

926
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:19,427
Yeah, I know.

927
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:22,979
Did you kill all these things?

928
01:11:23,069 --> 01:11:25,378
No. Across the street.

929
01:11:28,629 --> 01:11:30,699
Place is like an animal morgue.

930
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:33,019
It's a little cold, isn't it?

931
01:11:33,149 --> 01:11:34,218
Yeah.

932
01:11:37,709 --> 01:11:39,745
Who killed all these things?

933
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:41,785
Are you crazy?.

934
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:44,702
Pay Gazzo or end up on the hook.

935
01:11:44,789 --> 01:11:48,418
- Gazzo's a good man.
- I know that.

936
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:51,819
Talk to him about me
and the collecting job.

937
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:54,343
Get me out of this freezer.

938
01:11:54,429 --> 01:11:59,219
You should keep this job
because you eat better.

939
01:12:00,829 --> 01:12:02,945
Does it ever snow in here?

940
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:08,262
You and my sister, how are you
getting along together?

941
01:12:08,749 --> 01:12:12,264
- How you think?
- I'm not sure, Rock.

942
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:14,067
What's the story?

943
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:15,946
About what?

944
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:18,702
What's the story?
What's happening?

945
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:22,065
- You really like her?
- Sure I like her.

946
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,705
What's the attraction?

947
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:29,981
I don't know.
Fills gaps, I guess.

948
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:31,946
What's gaps?

949
01:12:32,029 --> 01:12:34,862
She's got gaps. I got gaps.

950
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:36,905
Together we fill gaps.

951
01:12:38,669 --> 01:12:40,625
You balling her?

952
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:45,022
Don't talk dirty
about your sister.

953
01:12:46,549 --> 01:12:48,983
Are you screwing my sister?

954
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:55,341
That's why I can't
connect you with Gazzo -

955
01:12:55,429 --> 01:12:58,068
because you talk too much.

956
01:12:58,149 --> 01:13:03,064
- It's cold. I'm going home.
- It is cold in here!

957
01:13:03,149 --> 01:13:06,027
It stinks, and you stink.

958
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:34,700
You're breaking the ribs.

959
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:58,302
Do that to Apollo Creed
and they'll put us in gaol.

960
01:13:59,349 --> 01:14:01,624
See you tomorrow morning, OK?

961
01:14:13,185 --> 01:14:13,705
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

962
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:16,139
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

963
01:14:16,225 --> 01:14:20,457
Your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy.

964
01:14:28,745 --> 01:14:33,216
- Want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore.

965
01:14:33,305 --> 01:14:35,182
I'll just sit here.

966
01:14:35,265 --> 01:14:37,176
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

967
01:14:40,065 --> 01:14:42,738
Come on, no fooling around.

968
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:44,702
I'm tired.

969
01:14:45,425 --> 01:14:46,904
I'm serious.

970
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:50,421
There's no fooling
around during training.

971
01:14:50,505 --> 01:14:53,224
- You're not kidding.
- I ain't kidding.

972
01:14:57,065 --> 01:14:59,295
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

973
01:14:59,385 --> 01:15:01,740
Just make the meat, OK.

974
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,135
OK, I'll make the meat.

975
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:31,858
It's OK.

976
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,424
I'm sorry.

977
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:07,337
Underneath. Underneath.
Come on, come on!

978
01:16:07,421 --> 01:16:10,618
Hold it, Rock!
You're driving me crazy.

979
01:16:10,701 --> 01:16:13,454
You're sloppy because
you're off-balance.

980
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:17,853
Take this string
and tie it to both ankles.

981
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:21,934
- I never had good footwork.
- You're off-balance.

982
01:16:22,021 --> 01:16:26,458
Marciano had the same problem,
and this string cured it.

983
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:30,819
If you can move and you can hit
without breaking the string,

984
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:34,177
you got balance
and become very dangerous.

985
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:36,411
You're looking good, Rock.

986
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:37,820
Thanks.

987
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:39,971
That's it.

988
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:43,610
- How about your autograph?
- Get outta here!

989
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:48,058
Don't interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.

990
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:49,460
Listen, kid.

991
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:52,294
Lay off that pet shop dame.

992
01:16:52,381 --> 01:16:55,214
Women weaken legs.

993
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:58,373
Yeah, but I really
like this girl.

994
01:16:58,461 --> 01:17:00,577
Then let her train you!

995
01:17:02,781 --> 01:17:04,851
OK, no more fooling around.

996
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:06,897
OK, now hit it.

997
01:17:07,741 --> 01:17:10,209
Women weaken legs, huh?

998
01:17:26,221 --> 01:17:27,779
You look great.

999
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:29,817
- Really?
- Yeah.

1000
01:17:31,181 --> 01:17:35,094
You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts.

1001
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:37,137
You look very sharp.

1002
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:39,530
I got another surprise for you.

1003
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:40,849
What?

1004
01:17:44,221 --> 01:17:45,973
Come here, kid.

1005
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,700
To keep you company
when you run.

1006
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:54,012
Come and meet the family.

1007
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:56,217
The owner never come back?

1008
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:58,451
He's yours if you want him.

1009
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:00,611
Do I want him? What's he eat?

1010
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:02,612
He eats little turtles.

1011
01:18:25,861 --> 01:18:28,091
Whose truck is this?

1012
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:34,845
One call from me,
you're a celebrity.

1013
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:38,121
You need exposure.

1014
01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:39,801
Don't breathe on me.

1015
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:42,403
Don't I know about these things?

1016
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:45,640
- No! What do they want?
- To watch you train.

1017
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:50,120
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm doing you a favour.

1018
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:54,327
You're embarrassing me
in front of your sister.

1019
01:18:54,409 --> 01:18:57,321
See this cigar?
Stick it in your ear.

1020
01:18:57,409 --> 01:19:00,162
You should've called me up.

1021
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:02,046
Don't do that.

1022
01:19:02,129 --> 01:19:04,245
My sister really likes you.

1023
01:19:05,929 --> 01:19:09,046
I'll kill you one of these days.

1024
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:11,759
Pretty baby!

1025
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:16,039
Here's the next heavyweight
champion of the world.

1026
01:19:16,129 --> 01:19:18,962
We want a brief interview.

1027
01:19:19,049 --> 01:19:22,405
What about me?
I'm in charge of the meat.

1028
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:24,639
Fine. Stand behind it.

1029
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:28,199
I'm just going
to ask a few questions

1030
01:19:28,289 --> 01:19:31,361
about your unique
training method.

1031
01:19:31,449 --> 01:19:35,078
Folks want to know
how you got into this.

1032
01:19:35,169 --> 01:19:37,319
This isn't an everyday thing.

1033
01:19:37,409 --> 01:19:39,365
Rocky, turn around here.

1034
01:19:39,449 --> 01:19:41,758
Don't take no cheap shots.

1035
01:19:41,849 --> 01:19:43,680
No, I won't. Relax.

1036
01:19:43,769 --> 01:19:47,682
We're here with heavyweight
challenger Rocky Balboa...

1037
01:19:47,769 --> 01:19:50,806
The meat guy's
sticking his face in.

1038
01:19:50,889 --> 01:19:52,925
Let's try it again, Rocky.

1039
01:19:53,169 --> 01:19:57,606
We're here with heavyweight
challenger Rocky Balboa.

1040
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:02,365
Mr Balboa has an unusual
method of training.

1041
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:07,125
In a moment, he's going
to demonstrate that.

1042
01:20:07,209 --> 01:20:09,882
Rocky, why train in an icebox?

1043
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:13,484
My friend there
let me in one day.

1044
01:20:13,569 --> 01:20:17,244
I hit the beef,
and I kind of liked it.

1045
01:20:17,329 --> 01:20:19,365
The owner don't mind.

1046
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:22,327
Do other fighters
pound raw meat?

1047
01:20:22,409 --> 01:20:24,718
No, I think I invented it.

1048
01:20:24,809 --> 01:20:27,323
- Would you demonstrate?
- Sure.

1049
01:20:27,409 --> 01:20:30,924
Be sure to fly
my barber to Philly.

1050
01:20:34,049 --> 01:20:37,564
How much is being channelled
into closed-circuit advertising?

1051
01:20:37,649 --> 01:20:39,128
300,000.

1052
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:43,919
Send the mayor's wife 200 roses
and make sure we get a picture.

1053
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:48,002
Do you want to run
the radio spots in the midwest?

1054
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:51,081
You could spend your money
better in Canada.

1055
01:20:51,169 --> 01:20:54,206
My friends in Toronto
could get you tax breaks.

1056
01:20:54,289 --> 01:20:57,201
George, I like your friends.

1057
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:08,048
Champ, come look at this
boy you're gonna fight.

1058
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:12,361
- Looks like he means business.
- I mean business too.

1059
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:16,920
- Shirley, any more coffee?
- I'll get you some.

1060
01:21:17,009 --> 01:21:20,888
After the fight,
I may just retire.

1061
01:21:20,969 --> 01:21:24,928
The gross run
would be based on...

1062
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:36,082
Diana Lewis in the meat house

1063
01:21:36,169 --> 01:21:38,683
with southpaw Rocky Balboa.

1064
01:22:23,037 --> 01:22:25,232
He called the reporters?

1065
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:27,956
Threw my training schedule off.

1066
01:22:28,037 --> 01:22:29,755
He's trying to help.

1067
01:22:29,837 --> 01:22:34,115
It's just that
when reporters are around,

1068
01:22:34,197 --> 01:22:38,031
I get out of joint
'cause they take cheap shots.

1069
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:41,234
Paulie keeps
asking me for a job,

1070
01:22:41,317 --> 01:22:44,275
but he don't know
nothing about fighting.

1071
01:22:44,357 --> 01:22:46,268
Are you gonna say anything?

1072
01:22:46,357 --> 01:22:49,986
I don't know
what he wants from me.

1073
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:54,713
I don't want nothing from you.

1074
01:22:57,557 --> 01:22:59,991
This ain't no charity case.

1075
01:23:00,077 --> 01:23:03,956
- Get out of my house.
- It's not just your house.

1076
01:23:04,037 --> 01:23:06,267
You're no friend no more.

1077
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:10,191
- Get out of my house,
- Don't talk to him like that.

1078
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:12,916
Both of you get out of my house!

1079
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:16,627
It's cold outside, Paulie.

1080
01:23:25,637 --> 01:23:27,673
I don't want you messing her,

1081
01:23:27,757 --> 01:23:30,669
and I don't raise you
to go with this bum.

1082
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:32,475
Want to hit on me?

1083
01:23:32,557 --> 01:23:35,435
I'll break both your arms.

1084
01:23:39,237 --> 01:23:42,547
I'm not good enough for Gazzo!

1085
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:44,912
You're a big-shot fighter,

1086
01:23:44,997 --> 01:23:49,070
you don't throw a crumb
to your friend Paulie.

1087
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,945
- I even give you my sister.
- Only a pig would say that!

1088
01:23:53,037 --> 01:23:57,394
I'm a pig.
A pig gets you the best?

1089
01:23:58,357 --> 01:24:01,349
I don't get married
because of you.

1090
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:03,746
You can't live by yourself.

1091
01:24:03,837 --> 01:24:08,467
I put you two together.
You owe me!

1092
01:24:10,477 --> 01:24:13,514
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

1093
01:24:13,597 --> 01:24:15,906
You're supposed
to be good to me.

1094
01:24:15,997 --> 01:24:19,990
What do I owe you, Paulie?
I treat you good!

1095
01:24:20,077 --> 01:24:23,831
I cook for you!
I pick up your dirty clothes.

1096
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:27,626
I take care of you, Paulie.
I owe you nothing.

1097
01:24:27,717 --> 01:24:30,754
You made me feel like a loser.

1098
01:24:30,837 --> 01:24:32,987
I'm not a loser!

1099
01:24:33,077 --> 01:24:35,033
- You're busted.
- What?

1100
01:24:35,117 --> 01:24:39,349
You're not a virgin! You let
him take down your pants.

1101
01:24:39,437 --> 01:24:41,428
She's busted!

1102
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:46,306
I can't help it no more.

1103
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:16,555
You want a room-mate?

1104
01:25:20,877 --> 01:25:22,515
Absolutely.

1105
01:25:24,313 --> 01:25:24,873
OK, when you walk into the ring

1106
01:25:24,873 --> 01:25:26,625
OK, when you walk into the ring

1107
01:25:26,713 --> 01:25:29,671
with the number one
heavyweight of the world,

1108
01:25:29,753 --> 01:25:31,345
you'll be ready.

1109
01:25:31,433 --> 01:25:36,029
Why? Because I waited
for 50 years to make you ready.

1110
01:25:36,113 --> 01:25:38,673
You'll be able to spit nails.

1111
01:25:38,753 --> 01:25:42,746
You're gonna eat lightning,
and crap thunder.

1112
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:45,631
You'll become
a very dangerous person.

1113
01:25:47,873 --> 01:25:52,025
Rock, I want you to meet
our cut man, AI Savani.

1114
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:54,104
Take a look at his eye.

1115
01:25:54,193 --> 01:25:56,502
I've seen worse.

1116
01:25:56,593 --> 01:25:58,549
You ain't so bad yourself.

1117
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:00,988
- Cover up.
- You cover up.

1118
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:04,668
- Go and take a shower.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1119
01:26:04,753 --> 01:26:08,746
You covered that
Whitmore fight, didn't you?

1120
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:10,710
That's why you wanted me.

1121
01:26:10,793 --> 01:26:12,829
We got a winner here.

1122
01:26:12,913 --> 01:26:16,622
He goes to the body
like nobody you've seen.

1123
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:19,181
You just stand by.
We're gonna win.

1124
01:26:24,473 --> 01:26:27,192
It's OK I talk to you?

1125
01:26:27,273 --> 01:26:30,231
OK you talk to me? Sure.

1126
01:26:30,313 --> 01:26:34,352
I figured some angle to make
some money off your name.

1127
01:26:34,433 --> 01:26:37,505
- My name? How's that?
- Advertising.

1128
01:26:37,593 --> 01:26:39,629
I know about that stuff.

1129
01:26:40,513 --> 01:26:44,392
What do you know
about advertising?

1130
01:26:45,793 --> 01:26:49,263
You can make money
off my name, make it.

1131
01:26:49,353 --> 01:26:51,389
I'm gonna take a shower.

1132
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:54,271
- Help me off with these.
- Sure.

1133
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:28,783
You're gonna kill him.

1134
01:31:11,864 --> 01:31:14,981
Rocky, what brings
you here tonight?

1135
01:31:16,064 --> 01:31:19,943
- The poster's wrong.
- What do you mean?

1136
01:31:20,024 --> 01:31:23,699
I'm wearing white pants
with a red stripe.

1137
01:31:26,904 --> 01:31:29,464
It doesn't
really matter, does it?

1138
01:31:29,544 --> 01:31:31,500
You'll give us a great show.

1139
01:31:33,064 --> 01:31:36,898
Try to get some rest, kid.
Good night.

1140
01:33:04,864 --> 01:33:06,695
I can't do it.

1141
01:33:09,104 --> 01:33:10,423
What?

1142
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:13,261
I can't beat him.

1143
01:33:14,664 --> 01:33:17,337
- Apollo?
- Yeah.

1144
01:33:18,584 --> 01:33:22,338
I've been out there
walking around, thinking.

1145
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:27,621
Who am I kidding? I ain't
even in the guy's league.

1146
01:33:31,784 --> 01:33:34,014
What are we gonna do?

1147
01:33:44,304 --> 01:33:46,215
I don't know.

1148
01:33:51,784 --> 01:33:54,014
You worked so hard.

1149
01:33:55,104 --> 01:33:59,143
Yeah. It don't matter
'cause I was nobody before.

1150
01:34:00,824 --> 01:34:05,375
- Don't say that.
- Come on, Adrian, it's true.

1151
01:34:05,464 --> 01:34:07,375
I was nobody.

1152
01:34:07,464 --> 01:34:11,139
That don't matter
either, you know?

1153
01:34:11,224 --> 01:34:13,738
'Cause I was thinking,

1154
01:34:13,824 --> 01:34:18,181
it really don't matter
if I lose this fight.

1155
01:34:19,704 --> 01:34:23,538
It don't matter
if this guy opens my head.

1156
01:34:24,624 --> 01:34:28,219
'Cause all I want to do
is go the distance.

1157
01:34:31,544 --> 01:34:34,581
Nobody's ever gone
the distance with Creed.

1158
01:34:34,664 --> 01:34:38,213
And if I can go
that distance, see,

1159
01:34:38,304 --> 01:34:42,741
and that bell rings
and I'm still standing...

1160
01:34:47,144 --> 01:34:51,023
I'm gonna know for
the first time in my life

1161
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:56,177
that I weren't just another
bum from the neighbourhood.

1162
01:36:00,304 --> 01:36:02,374
Time, kid. Let's go.

1163
01:36:04,824 --> 01:36:06,621
I'll wait for you here.

1164
01:36:08,184 --> 01:36:11,620
How about I wait here
and you fight?

1165
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:15,104
You're looking very great today.

1166
01:36:17,344 --> 01:36:20,780
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town.

1167
01:36:21,384 --> 01:36:23,978
Wish me luck. I need it.

1168
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,895
Good luck.

1169
01:36:26,544 --> 01:36:29,695
You don't think
this robe is too baggy?

1170
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:31,263
Good luck.

1171
01:36:31,344 --> 01:36:32,777
Don't leave town.

1172
01:36:35,367 --> 01:36:35,927
Working the fight
with me tonight, Stu Nahan.

1173
01:36:35,927 --> 01:36:38,839
Working the fight
with me tonight, Stu Nahan.

1174
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:42,920
The electricity is
everywhere as Rocky Balboa...

1175
01:36:44,207 --> 01:36:48,564
What the hell is that?
You're not a billboard.

1176
01:36:48,647 --> 01:36:50,444
It's for a friend.

1177
01:36:50,527 --> 01:36:53,599
Paulie gets three grand.
I get the robe.

1178
01:36:53,687 --> 01:36:55,200
Shrewd.

1179
01:36:55,287 --> 01:36:58,757
You could quote a sports
magazine, which said

1180
01:36:58,847 --> 01:37:01,759
"Could be the cave man
against the cavalier."

1181
01:37:01,847 --> 01:37:04,236
Notice that buzzing.

1182
01:37:04,327 --> 01:37:07,956
The challenger getting ready
to enter the ring...

1183
01:37:08,047 --> 01:37:10,117
My date cost me $200.

1184
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:12,118
I gotta work.

1185
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:14,721
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

1186
01:37:14,807 --> 01:37:18,436
A 50-to- 1 underdog
living a Cinderella story.

1187
01:37:18,527 --> 01:37:21,519
He's captured people's
imaginations all over the world.

1188
01:37:25,207 --> 01:37:26,925
We love you, Rocky!

1189
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:31,285
- Good luck, champ.
- Thanks for showing up.

1190
01:37:31,367 --> 01:37:34,404
His record, 44 victories,
38 by knockout.

1191
01:37:34,487 --> 01:37:37,047
and he's lost 20 fights.

1192
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:40,676
Does he have the stamina
to last three rounds?

1193
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:43,281
Las Vegas odds say no.

1194
01:37:43,367 --> 01:37:45,517
Rocky Balboa
climbing into the ring.

1195
01:37:45,607 --> 01:37:47,086
The ltalian Stallion.

1196
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:50,955
Some meat sign
on the back of his robe.

1197
01:37:51,047 --> 01:37:53,766
A lot of noise
in the background.

1198
01:37:56,407 --> 01:37:58,079
There's the spotlight.

1199
01:37:58,167 --> 01:38:02,479
Is that the world heavyweight
champion Apollo Creed?

1200
01:38:04,207 --> 01:38:08,246
Is he supposed to be George
Washington? Obviously so.

1201
01:38:19,127 --> 01:38:24,440
Remember we talked about
Washington throwing a dollar?

1202
01:38:24,527 --> 01:38:26,324
In those days, it went farther.

1203
01:38:26,407 --> 01:38:29,080
He's taking off his blond wig.

1204
01:38:33,727 --> 01:38:37,037
The crowd is loving
every minute of it.

1205
01:38:37,127 --> 01:38:39,357
The world
heavyweight champion...

1206
01:38:39,447 --> 01:38:41,324
For you around the world,

1207
01:38:41,407 --> 01:38:44,444
he was dressed
as George Washington.

1208
01:38:50,047 --> 01:38:51,605
Uncle Sam himself!

1209
01:38:51,687 --> 01:38:54,918
I want you! All of you!

1210
01:38:56,647 --> 01:38:58,285
He looks like a flag.

1211
01:39:00,927 --> 01:39:06,081
- Is he talking to me?
- He's talking to you.

1212
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,317
I want the Stallion!

1213
01:39:08,407 --> 01:39:10,557
"I want the Stallion."

1214
01:39:10,647 --> 01:39:16,677
During World War l,
there was a picture of Uncle Sam

1215
01:39:16,767 --> 01:39:21,477
with his finger pointed
like that, a recruiting poster.

1216
01:39:21,567 --> 01:39:25,765
"I want you" - that's what
he's doing the take on.

1217
01:39:25,847 --> 01:39:27,485
Creed in three.

1218
01:39:27,567 --> 01:39:29,717
What do you think
that outfit cost?

1219
01:39:39,727 --> 01:39:43,242
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

1220
01:39:43,327 --> 01:39:45,841
A very happy New Year.

1221
01:39:45,927 --> 01:39:48,316
Welcome to Philadelphia.

1222
01:39:48,407 --> 01:39:52,195
Everybody who's anybody
is here tonight.

1223
01:39:52,287 --> 01:39:55,359
Time does not permit me
to introduce

1224
01:39:55,447 --> 01:39:59,565
the many luminaries of politics,

1225
01:39:59,647 --> 01:40:01,763
show business and sport

1226
01:40:01,847 --> 01:40:03,803
who are with us tonight.

1227
01:40:03,887 --> 01:40:06,082
But I would like to present

1228
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:08,886
one of the immortals
of pugilism,

1229
01:40:08,967 --> 01:40:12,562
a champion in
and out of the ring,

1230
01:40:12,647 --> 01:40:15,400
Philadelphia's own Smoking Joe,

1231
01:40:15,487 --> 01:40:18,524
the beloved Mr Joe Frazier!

1232
01:40:28,207 --> 01:40:31,165
- How ya doing?
- How are you?

1233
01:40:31,247 --> 01:40:32,566
I'm fine.

1234
01:40:32,647 --> 01:40:37,243
Now he's coming
to talk to the champ.

1235
01:40:37,327 --> 01:40:40,444
- Hey, Joe.
- You been dumping on me...

1236
01:40:40,527 --> 01:40:44,361
- You next, Joe.
- You understand?

1237
01:40:44,447 --> 01:40:45,926
They must be friends.

1238
01:40:53,927 --> 01:40:55,645
Go, Frazier!

1239
01:41:01,487 --> 01:41:05,685
And now for the main event.

1240
01:41:10,727 --> 01:41:13,161
The challenger in white trunks,

1241
01:41:13,247 --> 01:41:17,081
weighing 1 90 pounds,

1242
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:19,362
Philadelphia's favourite son,

1243
01:41:19,447 --> 01:41:23,360
The ltalian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa.

1244
01:41:31,327 --> 01:41:35,161
And on my right,
wearing red, white and blue,

1245
01:41:35,247 --> 01:41:38,637
weighing 2 1 0 pounds,

1246
01:41:38,727 --> 01:41:42,037
undefeated in 46 fights,

1247
01:41:42,127 --> 01:41:44,960
the Master of Disaster,

1248
01:41:45,047 --> 01:41:48,517
the undisputed heavyweight
champion of the world,

1249
01:41:48,607 --> 01:41:50,677
Apollo Creed!

1250
01:41:57,647 --> 01:42:00,320
You, chump! I want YOU!

1251
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:05,396
No low blows.
Watch your heads. No butting.

1252
01:42:05,487 --> 01:42:07,478
Shake hands, come out fighting.

1253
01:42:07,567 --> 01:42:10,604
Put your hands up there, chump.

1254
01:42:15,247 --> 01:42:19,206
Rocky's just going over
and being calm.

1255
01:42:19,727 --> 01:42:21,638
There goes the big hat.

1256
01:42:23,087 --> 01:42:27,000
Never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair.

1257
01:42:36,038 --> 01:42:38,950
There's the bell for round one.

1258
01:42:39,038 --> 01:42:42,394
Fighters come into
the centre of the ring.

1259
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:55,789
Rocky looks like he's blocking
the blows with his face.

1260
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:59,553
The champion doesn't look
the best he's ever been,

1261
01:42:59,638 --> 01:43:01,310
but he's moving.

1262
01:43:01,398 --> 01:43:03,468
The champion is smiling.

1263
01:43:03,558 --> 01:43:05,753
He's toying with this man,

1264
01:43:05,838 --> 01:43:07,749
giving the fans
their money's worth.

1265
01:43:07,838 --> 01:43:09,635
He's making a show of it.

1266
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:14,388
Rocky looks ready
to challenge him now.

1267
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:23,757
The champ is taunting him.

1268
01:43:26,198 --> 01:43:28,154
He's dancing around.

1269
01:43:31,398 --> 01:43:33,434
The champ is down!

1270
01:43:38,558 --> 01:43:40,230
Creed is down!

1271
01:43:40,318 --> 01:43:42,513
What a surprise this is.

1272
01:43:42,598 --> 01:43:46,989
It's the first time the
champion has been knocked down.

1273
01:43:48,038 --> 01:43:51,872
Holy Toledo.
He's giving him the count!

1274
01:43:54,877 --> 01:43:55,437
Let's go to work
right now, Rock!

1275
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,746
Let's go to work
right now, Rock!

1276
01:43:59,517 --> 01:44:02,236
Now Rocky coming back out.

1277
01:44:02,317 --> 01:44:05,468
He's like a bull
in a china closet.

1278
01:44:06,677 --> 01:44:09,191
And our champion's coming back.

1279
01:44:14,997 --> 01:44:17,670
That's the Apollo we know.

1280
01:44:21,077 --> 01:44:25,355
The champ is taunting Rocky
to come in for more.

1281
01:44:29,157 --> 01:44:31,193
Rocky's coming back now.

1282
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:35,667
Rocky's got him on the rope!

1283
01:44:41,797 --> 01:44:45,676
There's no way he expected
this kind of hitting power.

1284
01:44:53,077 --> 01:44:55,989
Apollo driving him
against the ropes.

1285
01:45:03,837 --> 01:45:06,146
Rocky can hardly find his way.

1286
01:45:08,357 --> 01:45:09,995
I told ya!

1287
01:45:10,077 --> 01:45:13,672
Your nose is broke.
It's an improvement.

1288
01:45:13,757 --> 01:45:16,954
Quit jiving. Stick and move.

1289
01:45:17,037 --> 01:45:19,870
Go for the ribs.
Don't let him breathe.

1290
01:45:19,957 --> 01:45:21,788
The guy is great.

1291
01:45:21,877 --> 01:45:24,596
He doesn't know
it's a damn show.

1292
01:45:24,677 --> 01:45:28,670
He thinks it's a damn fight.
Finish this bum.

1293
01:45:28,757 --> 01:45:31,635
Stay to the body. The body!

1294
01:45:31,717 --> 01:45:36,074
Round two. Creed predicted
he'd win in three.

1295
01:45:44,517 --> 01:45:48,351
The champion's got him
backed in the corner.

1296
01:45:52,437 --> 01:45:55,952
Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.

1297
01:45:56,037 --> 01:45:58,949
His face is like
a punching bag.

1298
01:45:59,037 --> 01:46:01,267
What's keeping him up?

1299
01:46:02,317 --> 01:46:04,353
Stop playing around.

1300
01:46:06,477 --> 01:46:08,627
He says he wants more!

1301
01:46:08,717 --> 01:46:13,154
You folks with television,
you're watching a battle.

1302
01:46:17,797 --> 01:46:20,027
Balboa trying to fight back.

1303
01:46:21,397 --> 01:46:25,026
The champion can't
get out of there.

1304
01:46:29,477 --> 01:46:31,866
Balboa smacks him on the kisser.

1305
01:46:33,677 --> 01:46:36,191
They're ready to keep going.

1306
01:46:41,397 --> 01:46:43,672
This'll be a tough one.

1307
01:47:48,997 --> 01:47:51,511
What is keeping him up, Bill?

1308
01:47:51,597 --> 01:47:53,553
I don't know.

1309
01:47:54,877 --> 01:47:56,913
Can't even get his gloves up.

1310
01:48:05,197 --> 01:48:06,676
Stay down!

1311
01:48:06,757 --> 01:48:10,113
Apollo with his arms in the air.

1312
01:48:18,477 --> 01:48:20,115
Five...

1313
01:48:20,877 --> 01:48:22,310
Six...

1314
01:48:23,557 --> 01:48:24,910
Seven...

1315
01:48:24,997 --> 01:48:26,828
Eight... Nine...

1316
01:48:32,757 --> 01:48:34,190
Come on.

1317
01:48:35,957 --> 01:48:37,913
Apollo can't believe it!

1318
01:48:53,877 --> 01:48:57,552
The champion got
a left to the right rib.

1319
01:49:05,117 --> 01:49:07,426
- You OK, Champ?
- I'm OK.

1320
01:49:10,437 --> 01:49:12,553
I can't see. Open my eye.

1321
01:49:12,637 --> 01:49:14,150
Cut me, Mick.

1322
01:49:14,237 --> 01:49:16,910
- Don't want to.
- Cut me. Cut me.

1323
01:49:17,317 --> 01:49:19,035
Cut it!

1324
01:49:24,317 --> 01:49:26,228
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1325
01:49:26,317 --> 01:49:29,753
You ain't stopping nothing, man!

1326
01:49:30,117 --> 01:49:33,268
You stop this fight,
I'll kill you.

1327
01:49:33,357 --> 01:49:36,349
- I'm going.
- If you wanna go, go!

1328
01:49:56,185 --> 01:49:59,018
They look like
they've been in a war.

1329
01:50:07,625 --> 01:50:10,185
The champion really tagged him.

1330
01:50:10,265 --> 01:50:13,974
Apollo clearly protecting
his right side, his ribs.

1331
01:50:20,425 --> 01:50:25,419
Look at the blood coming out.
He's spitting up blood now.

1332
01:50:30,305 --> 01:50:31,658
Go for it!

1333
01:50:38,945 --> 01:50:40,981
He's got him against the rope.

1334
01:50:41,225 --> 01:50:44,456
Apollo the champion...

1335
01:50:44,545 --> 01:50:47,105
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

1336
01:50:47,185 --> 01:50:49,380
Don't want one.

1337
01:51:00,225 --> 01:51:03,661
You went the 1 5 rounds.
How do you feel?

1338
01:51:03,745 --> 01:51:05,622
All right.

1339
01:51:05,705 --> 01:51:06,660
Adrian!

1340
01:51:06,745 --> 01:51:09,498
- When the 1 5th round...
- Adrian!

1341
01:51:09,665 --> 01:51:11,098
Rocky.

1342
01:51:11,345 --> 01:51:12,858
Rocky.

1343
01:51:14,705 --> 01:51:16,104
Rocky.

1344
01:51:17,065 --> 01:51:18,623
Rocky!

1345
01:51:18,785 --> 01:51:21,697
You've had the privilege
of witnessing

1346
01:51:21,785 --> 01:51:24,936
the greatest exhibition
of guts and stamina

1347
01:51:25,025 --> 01:51:27,061
in the history of the ring.

1348
01:51:33,345 --> 01:51:35,700
We have a split decision...

1349
01:51:42,105 --> 01:51:43,902
Apollo Creed!

1350
01:51:47,505 --> 01:51:49,416
There won't be a rematch.

1351
01:51:49,505 --> 01:51:53,737
I've had enough of this
for one day! Adrian!

1352
01:51:54,025 --> 01:51:56,619
That's my friend. Rocko!

1353
01:51:56,705 --> 01:51:59,060
You're ripping the jacket.

1354
01:51:59,945 --> 01:52:01,094
Paulie?

1355
01:52:06,105 --> 01:52:08,824
- I love you!
- I love you.

1356
01:52:11,945 --> 01:52:14,175
I love you, Rocky.

1357
01:52:14,265 --> 01:52:16,495
I love you! I love you!

1358
