1
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,801
Oh, but this is great.

2
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,837
- Wow!
- Thas incredible.

3
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,066
There's gotta be at least seven
or eight feet up there.

4
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,006
And 80 years of dust.

5
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,444
Look at all this height.

6
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,242
We could put our bedroom upstairs,
and that will leave us with all this space.

7
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,680
- For what?
- Just space.

8
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,319
One, two, three!

9
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,687
- And four?
- Come on.

10
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:15,761
Four.

11
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,388
And five.

12
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,663
Watch... Watch this.

13
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,032
God, this place is huge.

14
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,139
- Is beautiful.
- God.

15
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,310
- You guys, is absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.

16
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,642
A little paint.

17
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,748
I'd say you could sell this tomorrow
and double your money.

18
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,184
- Carl, you're obsessed.
- A little bit.

19
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,187
Whoa, look.

20
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,593
Hey, is an Indian-head penny.

21
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,353
1898.

22
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,828
- Is a good omen.
- You're the good omen.

23
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,331
Oh, is so great.

24
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,722
I had Rose move your 3:00
with Bob Kahan to 4:00,

25
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,248
'cause Gary Alan called
at the end of the day yesterday

26
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,453
and said he has to see you
about the final painting bids for the loft.

27
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,723
3:00 is the only time he could make it.
Is that okay?

28
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,994
Sam?

29
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,325
What are you doing?

30
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,698
- Would you relax, man?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,239
This is not brain surgery
you're going into.

32
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,208
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

33
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,312
Sam, you're going to be great. Okay?

34
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,578
I mean, what am I supposed to say?

35
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,313
I mean, I can't very well tell them my
Swedish pom-pom girl joke, you know.

36
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,722
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?

37
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,623
Nice, huh? Molly.
What do you think? Are they me?

38
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,461
Oh, man, look at that. A Testarossa.

39
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,728
I think you ought to pay off
your Mustang first.

40
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,009
How you feeling?
Whad the doctor say?

41
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,378
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...

42
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,973
- No.
- Yeah.

43
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,849
He said that I shouldn't even
be coming in today.

44
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,588
- What about the rash?
- The rash?

45
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,559
The rash is also incredibly contagious.

46
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,154
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No.

47
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,403
- On your genitals again?
- Yeah, yeah. Right on the genitals.

48
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,471
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.

49
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,571
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

50
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,282
- You're sick.
- I know.

51
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,481
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning, Carl. Sam.

52
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,023
Hey, Paul.

53
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,955
- Morning, Mr. Wheat.
- Morning, Susan. You are looking good.

54
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,119
Sam.

55
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,992
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,958
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

57
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,633
- Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning, Rose.

58
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,800
- Oh, listen, the Kobiashi people...
- They're already here.

59
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,036
- They're early.
- I know.

60
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,407
Come here.

61
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,502
Oh, and Andy Dillon called...

62
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,741
- How long have they been here?
- About 10 minutes.

63
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,317
Andy Dillon called and he says

64
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,251
he needs $900,000 transferred
to Albany by 10:00.

65
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,753
- By 10:00?
- Yes.

66
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,822
Excuse me.

67
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,583
- Carl?
- Yeah?

68
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,687
- Good morning.
- Carl.

69
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,263
Bill, hang on one second.

70
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,197
Dillon needs $900,000
in Albany by 10:00.

71
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,824
Can you transfer it
to his payroll account?

72
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,403
- Yeah, I'm gonna need your MAC code.
- Okay.

73
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,739
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.

74
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,979
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Okay, thanks.

75
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,847
Yeah. Bill, I'm going to
call you back. Okay.

76
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,565
Okay, okay, thas fine. Is fine. Is fine!

77
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,429
Man, is too far out.

78
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,496
Can you get this, man?

79
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,975
Where are you guys from,
the New York City Ballet?

80
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,780
Almost.

81
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,885
- Saved your life.
- You shit. You scared me to death.

82
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,049
Why did you do that?

83
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,356
Is better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

84
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,158
Look out. Look out.

85
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,393
Grab it.

86
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,406
- Sam, Mol, are you guys home?
- Thas Carl. Did you invite him?

87
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,169
- Slave labor.
- Carl.

88
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,538
- What?
- Hurry, help.

89
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,941
Oh, my God.

90
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,240
- Near the bottom.
- I got it.

91
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,507
- Now go down.
- What? Just down here?

92
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,673
Yeah.

93
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,779
- Just right here?
- Watch your toes.

94
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,853
I got it.

95
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,416
- Hey, where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.

96
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,122
Good girl.

97
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:17,093
- God, this place looks great.
- Yeah.

98
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,960
- You like it, huh?
- Like? Like is hardly the word.

99
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,626
I had no idea id be this beautiful.
Is incredible.

100
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,134
Molly, what about her?

101
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,831
Well, why don't we just leave her there
until we get the other stuff in?

102
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,372
- We can figure out...
- What are these?

103
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,941
Oh, let me show you.

104
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,433
Hey, you wanna help me lift this up?

105
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,034
- What, here?
- Yeah.

106
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,669
Wow.

107
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,410
- I just finished it. What do you think?
- Is fantastic. I love it.

108
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,846
Sam, whas this chair doing here?

109
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,381
- What do you mean? I love that chair.
- I know you love this chair.

110
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,188
- But we discussed this and...
- Yeah, I've had it forever.

111
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,957
I mean just, when I watch TV, I sit in it.

112
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,259
- Baby, this chair is ugly.
- So?

113
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,200
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.

114
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,435
You're right. It does.

115
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,038
- We'll paint it.
- We'll what?

116
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,287
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

117
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,594
- Whas the matter?
- Nothing.

118
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,262
Are you worried about the promotion?

119
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,996
No, not really.

120
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:48,877
- Then what? Is it moving in together?
- No.

121
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,687
I don't know. Is a lot of things.

122
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,397
I just don't want the bubble to burst.

123
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,603
It seems like

124
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,570
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

125
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,238
I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.

126
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:24,088
I love you. I really love you.

127
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:28,987
Ditto.

128
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,264
The pilos first report of trouble was
that he blew the number two engine,

129
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,769
the one in the tail of the plane.
It was fully loaded.

130
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,573
Oh, Jesus, another one.

131
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,673
Oh, don't watch that.

132
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,773
I should cancel my LA trip.
These things always happen in threes.

133
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:57,446
Sam, get serious.
Besides, you lead a charmed life.

134
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,922
Oh, yeah. So did they.

135
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,055
Is amazing, just like that. Blackout.

136
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,059
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep.

137
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,074
Boy, I really must have passed out.

138
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,243
- What time is it?
- Is 2:00 a.m.

139
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,401
Oh, no. I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

140
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,443
Well, is not now.

141
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,105
- Can I help?
- Yeah.

142
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,547
Put your hands up here. Get them wet.

143
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,555
Now, just let the clay slide
between your fingers.

144
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,865
Oh, no.

145
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,467
- Whas the matter?
- A glitch. Whas up?

146
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,096
The Mark Greenberg
and Larry White accounts.

147
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,799
I can't get in.
The MAC code doesn't work.

148
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,309
- No, I changed it.
- You changed it? Why?

149
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,504
Nothing. I just want
to nose around a bit.

150
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,137
Is something wrong?

151
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,277
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah, sure.

152
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,716
Whas up?

153
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,724
There's too much money
in these accounts.

154
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,590
Too much money?
Thas impossible. How could there be...

155
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,966
C72273.

156
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,833
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.

157
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,599
It already has taken me hours.

158
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,901
Well, let me take it back
and figure it out for you.

159
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,001
No, no, thas okay.
Is... Is like a vendetta now.

160
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,078
- Thanks, though. I appreciate it.
- Okay.

161
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,674
- Lf you start to go blind, just shout.
- Okay.

162
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,021
Listen, I was wondering,
what are you and Mol doing tonight?

163
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,059
We're going to the theater.
She wants to see Macbeth.

164
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,752
I think she likes the guys in tights,
personally.

165
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,854
- You want to go?
- No, thanks.

166
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,823
I want a full report, though.

167
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,298
- Later.
- Yeah.

168
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,897
Wonderful.

169
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,802
Excellent. Great.

170
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,036
- Well, I loved it.
- Yes.

171
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,111
I was spellbound the whole time.

172
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,235
I could tell.

173
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,476
And so could the rest of the audience
with that resonating snore of yours.

174
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,480
Did I tell you what Melissa said?

175
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,354
- Yeah, about six times.
- It wasn't six times.

176
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,396
- Now quit being so blasé about this.
- Okay.

177
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,794
Now, this is really important.

178
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,265
I'm gonna have two pieces
in her gallery.

179
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,337
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

180
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,438
Molly, The New York Times
is just some frustrated little critic

181
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,442
with pimples on his ass
who flunked out of art school.

182
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,409
So who cares what they think?

183
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,546
About eight million readers, thas who.

184
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,379
Nah, they're just reading
the sports page.

185
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,353
- Your work is really beautiful. It really is.
- Thanks.

186
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,020
And it shouldn't matter what
anyone else thinks. Just what I think.

187
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,802
I want to marry you, Sam.

188
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,337
What? What?

189
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,831
Yep.

190
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,739
I've been thinking about it.

191
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:36,508
I've been thinking about it a lot,
and I think we should just do it.

192
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,451
- You're serious.
- Yeah.

193
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,146
Whas that look for?

194
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,956
You never wanted to talk about it.

195
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,768
- Do you love me, Sam?
- Now, what do you think?

196
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,572
Why don't you ever say it?

197
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,207
What do you mean,
why don't I ever say it?

198
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,218
- I say it all the time. I feel like...
- No, you don't.

199
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,016
You say, "Ditto,"
and thas not the same.

200
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,488
People say "I love you" all the time,
and it doesn't mean anything.

201
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,098
You know,
sometimes you need to hear it.

202
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,102
I need to hear it.

203
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,069
Les go.

204
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,518
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

205
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,644
- What do you want?
- Shit.

206
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,188
Your wallet. Give it to me!

207
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:56,991
- Sam, just give it to him.
- Okay.

208
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,626
Just take the money. Just leave us...

209
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,096
No, no, Sam!

210
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,266
You son of a bitch!

211
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,264
Sam, no!

212
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,432
Somebody help us!

213
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,407
Jesus Christ! Sam!

214
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,773
Just get off!

215
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,975
Somebody! Somebody help us!

216
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,749
Sam, just let...

217
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,251
Sam, just stop it! Stop it, Sam!

218
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,936
Molly?

219
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,914
Molly? He got...

220
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,323
Oh, baby, hold on.

221
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,826
You're gonna be okay.

222
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:15,100
Somebody! Somebody!
Somebody help us!

223
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,370
Sam. Oh, my God.

224
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,474
Oh, Sam, come on. Hold on, baby.

225
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,513
Someone's gonna come.
We're gonna be okay.

226
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:44,698
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Please, anybody.

227
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,801
Help me, please, help me.

228
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,971
Is okay, lady. Take it easy, all right?

229
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,371
Oh, God!

230
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,309
We'll help you, okay?

231
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,175
Molly? Molly? Molly?

232
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,487
Molly.

233
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,182
What should we do?
What should we do?

234
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,529
What? Whas happening? Whas...

235
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,798
Is he breathing?

236
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,834
Is he breathing?
I don't know if he's breathing.

237
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,411
Oh, God, Sam, hold on.

238
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,175
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

239
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,708
Oh, my God.

240
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,195
Come on, man.

241
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,134
All right. Okay, come on, is all right.

242
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,398
Here we go.

243
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,632
All right, there you go. One, two...

244
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,913
Sam, don't you leave me! Sam, hold on!

245
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,409
Sam!

246
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,774
Oh, Sam!

247
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,271
...emergency room.

248
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,860
All right. Right away.

249
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,565
Miss Jensen,
if you'll step this way, please.

250
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,647
Cardiology, please dial extension 255...

251
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:21,418
- So, what happened to you?
- What?

252
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,962
You're new, huh? I can tell.

253
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,122
- Are you talking to me?
- Hey, relax.

254
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,998
It ain't like before, you know.
Is a whole new ball of wax.

255
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,734
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm waiting for my wife.

256
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,366
She's in 4C, cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

257
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,879
Shot, huh? Thall do it every time.

258
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,679
Poor bastard.

259
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,055
Hey, you may as well get used to it.

260
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,354
You could be here for a long while.

261
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,064
Come here, I'll tell you a secret.

262
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,764
Doors ain't as bad as you think.
Zip, zap, they ain't nothing at all.

263
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,568
You'll see. You'll catch on.

264
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,403
This patiens fibrillating.

265
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,872
Where's the paddles?
Get them up here.

266
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,277
He ain't gonna make it.

267
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,145
I've seen it a million times.
He's a goner.

268
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,117
- He's still fibrillating.
- Clear.

269
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,550
Clear.

270
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,052
You see? Here they come.

271
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,697
Lucky bastard.

272
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,926
It could have been the other ones.
You never know.

273
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,346
Who are...

274
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,358
Nursing supervisor,
dial the operator, please.

275
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,951
Nursing supervisor, dial the operator.

276
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,989
No!

277
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,707
Help me.

278
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,278
Oh, God, help me.

279
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:31,211
"I am sunk in the abysmal swamp
where there is no foothold.

280
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,958
"I have reached the watery depths.

281
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,623
"The flood overwhelms me.

282
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,460
"I am wearied with calling."

283
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,529
As we say farewell
to our friend Sam Wheat,

284
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,669
we are reminded of his kindness,

285
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:53,808
his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit.

286
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,347
All that we treasure, our loved ones,

287
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:04,081
our friends, our body, our mind,

288
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,153
are but on loan to us.

289
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,019
We must surrender them all.

290
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,560
We are all travelers on the same road
which leads to the same end.

291
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:26,507
As our loved one enters eternal life,
let us remember that love too is eternal.

292
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,877
That although we will miss him,

293
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,440
our love will light the void
and dispel the darkness.

294
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,988
I picked up your shirts today.

295
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,361
I don't know why.

296
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,730
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you hello.

297
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,238
I broke into tears.

298
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,878
Is like I think about you every minute.

299
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,787
Is like I can still feel you.

300
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,997
I'm here, Mol.

301
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,771
Floyd, whas the matter, kitty?
Whas the matter?

302
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,811
Crazy cat.

303
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,311
Sam?

304
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,114
Thas really stupid.

305
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,762
- I love this picture.
- Is great.

306
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:36,701
Office.

307
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,584
Oh, let me see that.

308
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,743
Is...

309
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,048
- Sam's address book.
- Right.

310
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,424
Dave Brubeck, Newport, '88.

311
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,465
- Should I toss them?
- No.

312
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,691
No? Molly, we hated that concert.

313
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,832
Hey.

314
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,469
- Oh, you wanted to save those?
- Rolaids?

315
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,271
Molly, what are you doing?

316
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,018
- I just miss him, Carl.
- Me, too.

317
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,125
- Carl?
- Yeah?

318
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,129
Wait a minute. Wait.

319
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,998
- What?
- Not that one.

320
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,226
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.

321
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,327
- I didn't mean to put that on there.
- Thas okay.

322
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:45,166
Hey, Molly, why don't you come?
Is like summer outside.

323
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,108
No, I really don't. I... I'm not up for it.

324
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,339
Come on, Mol, just for a walk.

325
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,278
- Id be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.

326
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,873
Molly, you can't stay in here all day.

327
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,977
- Is not healthy for you.
- Look, Carl, I can't do it!

328
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,149
Molly, you're not the one who died.

329
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,195
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

330
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,658
Shit.

331
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,203
Maybe you're right.

332
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,536
- Maybe just a short one.
- Attagirl.

333
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,939
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

334
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,275
Molly?

335
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,742
What are you doing here?

336
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,940
You bastard.

337
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,710
You son of a bitch!

338
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,994
What do you want?

339
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:55,936
Molly?

340
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,832
Molly, get out!

341
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,240
Oh, my God.

342
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,211
No, Molly. No, Molly, no, no. Please, no.

343
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,822
Molly, Molly, he's got a gun. Molly!

344
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,620
Hi, kitty. Hi.

345
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,890
You hurt her, I'll kill...

346
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,825
Molly.

347
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,490
Shit.

348
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,619
Is somebody there? Hello?

349
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,757
Hello?

350
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,074
What are you doing?

351
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,870
Let go! What are you doing?

352
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,382
No!

353
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,077
Like trains?

354
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,958
Stay out! This is mine!

355
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,636
Shit.

356
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,982
Is me. I couldn't get it.
She came home.

357
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,960
In a couple of days, man. I'll go back.

358
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,966
Relax, I'll get it.

359
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,828
Get what?

360
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,504
Who are you?
What do you want from us?

361
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,441
No. You stay away from her.

362
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,653
Do you hear me?

363
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,316
You stay away from her!

364
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,187
Rosa Santiago?

365
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:52,961
Please be seated.

366
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,614
Our sister will be with us soon.

367
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:20,448
Sister Oda Mae, grant us the gift
of your all-seeing presence.

368
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,950
Appear before us now.

369
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,523
Mrs. Santiago?

370
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,934
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

371
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,933
I understand you wish
to contact your husband.

372
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,406
I believe he'll be with us today.

373
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,378
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

374
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,779
But you know, Mrs. Santiago,

375
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,047
there's no telling about that other world.

376
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,117
So you've got to be a believer,
Mrs. Santiago.

377
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:57,058
- Are you a believer?
- Sí. Sí. I believe. I believe.

378
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,526
Then let us begin.

379
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:24,014
I can't. I can't. Is too difficult.

380
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:28,751
I just can't seem to make contact.
I... I don't feel his... No, wait!

381
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,691
I'm feeling something.

382
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:36,797
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

383
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:43,371
Consuelo? Lucita? Julietta?

384
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,637
Josephina? Linda? Maria?

385
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,373
Sí, sí. His mama. She is Maria.

386
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,611
Yes. Praise God!
I knew he was with his mama.

387
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,417
Oh, my God.

388
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:05,929
Is too difficult. Is two of them.
I'm not sure I can do that.

389
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,522
- Is so trying... Is...
- Oh, I pay more.

390
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,602
- How much? How much?
- $20.

391
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,069
Oh, way to go. Milk her for every penny.

392
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,921
Yes, I believe we can start again.

393
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,504
Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

394
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,952
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.

395
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,393
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.

396
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,764
- My husband?
- Have mercy!

397
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,961
Oh, yeah? Where?

398
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,240
- Julio?
- Yes.

399
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,504
I feel his vibration.

400
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,112
I see him!

401
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,546
How is he? How does he look?

402
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,519
Oh, he's a handsome man.

403
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,585
Handsome?

404
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,562
Mrs. Santiago, in our Father's kingdom,
we're all handsome.

405
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,828
Oh, Julio.

406
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,965
Julio's coming towards us. I see him!

407
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,695
He's coming! He's there!

408
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,334
He's dressed in a black suit.

409
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,508
Black suit?

410
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,778
Could be blue.

411
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,384
What a crock of shit.

412
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,852
- Who is that?
- Julio?

413
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,948
- Where are you?
- Julio? Julio?

414
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,357
Did you hear it? Damn.

415
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,190
- Where are you?
- Julio?

416
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,928
- Who are you?
- Who?

417
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,027
Julio? Julio?

418
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,966
- You can hear me?
- Don't you hear him?

419
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,037
I don't believe this.

420
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,529
Hey, you! Hey, you!
My name is Sam Wheat.

421
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,006
Listen, can you hear me? Sam Wheat.
Say my name. Say it.

422
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,373
- Leave me alone! Stop it!
- Say my name. Say it! Sam Wheat.

423
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,173
Say my name. Sam Wheat. Say it.

424
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,907
Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.

425
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,573
Sam Wheat!

426
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,620
Jesus.

427
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,349
- Sam Wheat?
- Sam Wheat?

428
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,153
I swear, no more cheating. I promise.
I'll do anything. I'll do penance.

429
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,556
Give me penance,
but make that guy go away.

430
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:51,889
No way.

431
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,936
Is okay.

432
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,534
Is okay.

433
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,376
All right, Sister.

434
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,581
- I can't...
- Yeah, you're all right.

435
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,114
My mother had it.
And my mother's mother had it.

436
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,879
They... They both had the gift.

437
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,649
And they always said I had it,
but I never did. I never had it.

438
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,622
They told me what it was like.
They told me all about it.

439
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,025
But now that I got it, I...
I don't think I want it.

440
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,758
So, do me a favor, just go away.
Find somebody else.

441
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,390
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.

442
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,729
Yeah, I'm getting there fast.

443
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,030
Well, I think she hit her head
harder than we think.

444
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,901
Well, she was talking to nobody
that wasn't there

445
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,098
before she even hit her head.

446
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,072
Well, I know she is.
But you know, Sister can do that.

447
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,304
- Where exactly are you?
- I'm standing right beside you.

448
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:47,509
- Oh, you're standing right beside me?
- Well, honey, we're right here.

449
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,143
- Are you white?
- What?

450
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,347
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

451
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,821
Oh, God, you know what I think?

452
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,721
Yes, I'm gonna call the doctor right now.

453
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:59,262
- I knew it. Is a white guy. Why me?
- Listen, damn it.

454
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,729
You are going to help me.
There's a woman.

455
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,858
Her name is Molly Jensen,
and she's in terrible danger.

456
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,768
The man who killed me broke into
our apartment and he's gonna go back.

457
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,339
So you've gotta warn her.

458
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,636
Just what makes you think
she's gonna listen to me?

459
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,677
Is just a phone call.

460
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,238
Look,

461
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,810
you're all I've got.

462
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,815
Now, I'm not leaving until you help me.

463
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:30,821
I don't care how long it takes,
'cause I can talk forever.

464
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,730
She's talking to white people
in the room.

465
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,242
- Hello?
- Hi.

466
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,673
- Is this Molly Jensen?
- Yes.

467
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,876
Well, my name is Oda Mae Brown.
I'm a spiritual reader and advisor,

468
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,110
and a friend of yours gave me
a message for you.

469
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,280
Now, I know this
is gonna sound a little crazy,

470
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,720
but is not, and you gotta believe me.
Just don't be afraid.

471
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:02,547
Who is this?

472
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,560
I got a message from Sam.

473
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,088
What?

474
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,462
Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.

475
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,528
- I told you.
- You gotta go there.

476
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,631
Forget it. I'm not going anywhere.
I don't care what you do.

477
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,874
Second verse same as the first

478
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,470
I'm Henry Vlll, I am

479
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,879
Henry Vlll, I am, I am

480
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,646
I got married to the widow next door

481
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,051
She's been married seven times before

482
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,852
And every one was an Henry
Henry!

483
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,448
She wouldn't have a Willie or a Sam

484
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,549
No, sir!

485
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,925
I'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry

486
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,521
Henry Vlll, I am, I am

487
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,193
Henry Vlll, I am

488
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,634
Second verse same as the first

489
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,332
I'm Henry Vlll, I am

490
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,772
Henry Vlll, I am, I am

491
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,344
I got married to the widow next door

492
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,310
All right, all right, all right! Stop singing!

493
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,815
I'll go anywhere you want to!
Just don't sing anymore!

494
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,882
I can't believe this.

495
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,319
I can't believe I'm doing this.
What am I doing down here?

496
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,021
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.

497
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,325
She's probably not even there.

498
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,894
Where are you?

499
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,470
Which building is it?

500
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,999
- Which one?
- Push three.

501
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,801
- See? Nobody's there.
- She's there. Just wait. Just wait.

502
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,540
Look, no. I came down here,
I did everything I said I was gonna do.

503
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,513
I pressed the button. She's not there.
I'm gone. Goodbye.

504
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,811
- Just wait one minute.
- I'm sorry.

505
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,250
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
Ninety-nine bottles of beer

506
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,787
Take one down and pass it around

507
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,915
All right, don't sing!
All right, all right, all right!

508
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,754
- Hello?
- Yes, hi.

509
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,885
She can't hear you.

510
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,553
Hi, I'm Oda Mae.

511
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:50,030
You know, I called you last night
about your friend Sam Wheat.

512
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,496
I told you.

513
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:00,710
Hey, Molly!

514
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,303
Molly Jensen, I know you're up there!
I know you hear me! I'm down here!

515
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,008
Sam wants to talk to you!
This is for real!

516
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,312
Hey, you remember the starfish
in Montego Bay?

517
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,753
How would I know that
if he wasn't here?

518
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
Hey, Molly!

519
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,524
I know about the green underwear
that you wrote your name on!

520
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,223
I'd never get over that, I'll tell you that.

521
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,592
I know about the picture in Reno.
Hey, Molly!

522
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,136
Ask her about the sweater she knitted,
in the closet, thas too big.

523
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,934
He just asked me
to remind you of the sweater

524
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,980
thas in the closet
that you knitted is too big!

525
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,613
Four sizes!

526
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,351
Hey, you hear me talking to you?

527
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,945
- I hear you.
- Oh, shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

528
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,456
Didn't you ever hear of a phone?

529
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,359
Wanna kiss my butt?

530
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,527
- I'm not gonna stay down here all day!
- Thank God.

531
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,257
Oh, man, shut up!

532
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,325
Molly!

533
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,692
I'm gonna count to three,
and then I'm out of here.

534
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,101
One, two, three.

535
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,238
- No, Oda. Wait.
- No.

536
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,402
Is Molly.

537
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,812
Molly?

538
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,750
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

539
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,626
I don't know you.
I don't know this guy, Sam.

540
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,198
But let me tell you what he did to me.

541
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,496
He kept me up all night singing
I'm Henry Vlll, I am.

542
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,002
Thas how he got me
to go out with him.

543
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,107
Look, I'm sorry.

544
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,203
I just don't believe
in this life-after-death stuff.

545
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,645
- Well, tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.

546
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,018
- You're talking to him right now?
- Yeah.

547
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,884
He just asked me to tell you
that you were wrong.

548
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:57,024
- So, where is he?
- I can't see him. I can only hear him.

549
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,358
I'm right here.

550
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,255
That doesn't help, Sam.

551
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,726
I'm holding her hand.

552
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,538
He says he's holding your hand.

553
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,410
What are you doing?

554
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,109
What do you think you're doing to me?

555
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,518
Hey, look, if you think I'd come
all the way down here for my health,

556
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,646
you're out of your mind.

557
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,225
Sam's dead. Okay? He's dead.

558
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,424
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.

559
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,360
Sam would never say that.

560
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,065
Ditto! Tell her ditto.

561
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,228
What the hell is ditto? Ditto!

562
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,895
Man, to tell you the truth,
I don't know how I'm doing this.

563
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,600
You know, confidentially, nothing like
this has ever happened to me before.

564
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,175
I mean, nothing.

565
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,438
And now I can't turn it off.

566
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,442
Is this him? Is this you?

567
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,710
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

568
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,817
Cute. White, but cute.

569
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:34,856
What I don't understand is
why did he come back?

570
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,558
- I don't know.
- Why is he still here?

571
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,623
He's stuck, thas what it is.
He's in between worlds.

572
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,462
You know, it happens sometimes.
The spirit gets yanked out so quick

573
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,663
that the essence still feels
like it has work to do here.

574
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,138
- Would you stop rambling?
- I don't think I'm rambling.

575
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,799
I'm just answering her question.

576
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,503
- He's got an attitude now.
- I don't have an attitude.

577
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,547
Yes, you do have an attitude.
We're having a little discussion.

578
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,275
If you didn't have an attitude,

579
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,442
you would not have raised
your voice to me, now, would you?

580
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,611
- God damn it, Oda Mae.
- Don't you "God damn it" me.

581
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,053
Don't you take the Lorïs name in vain
with me, you understand?

582
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,181
- I don't take that.
- Would you relax?

583
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,815
No, you relax. You're the dead guy.

584
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,257
You want me to help you?
You better apologize.

585
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,124
- Because I don't take that from anybody.
- Jesus Christ!

586
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,458
- Thas it, I'm leaving.
- What are you doing?

587
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm leaving. Nobody talks to me like that.
You understand me?

588
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:22,971
- Now you better apologize.
- I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay?

589
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:27,508
Now would you sit down? Please?

590
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,267
He's apologized.

591
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,109
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying,

592
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:36,242
but you have to tell her
word for word, all right?

593
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,821
- Word for word.
- Yes.

594
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,551
He wants me to tell you
what he's saying word for word.

595
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,524
Molly, you're in danger.

596
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,932
Now you can't just blurt it out like that.
And quit moving around, will you?

597
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,333
'Cause you're starting
to make me dizzy.

598
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,496
I'll just tell her in my own way.

599
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:00,167
Molly, you in danger, girl.

600
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,912
What are you talking about?

601
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,481
I know the man who killed me.

602
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,810
He knows the man who killed him.

603
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,715
His name is Willie Lopez,
and I know where he lives.

604
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,548
His name is Willie Lopez.
He's Puerto Rican.

605
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,679
He knows where he lives.

606
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,381
- Write it down.
- He wants you to write it down.

607
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,857
- You write it down.
- I ain't no damn secretary.

608
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,291
Just do it!

609
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,464
He's so testy.

610
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,724
What is it you want me to write?

611
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,962
Is 303 Prospect Place, apartment 4D.

612
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,905
- 303 Prospect Place?
- Yeah.

613
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,201
Thas my neighborhood.

614
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:38,111
Molly, he's got my wallet,
he's got my key, and he was in here.

615
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,311
He's got his wallet and his key,
and he was in here.

616
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,248
Yesterday when you came back
from your walk with Carl,

617
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,785
you went up the stairs,
you talked to Floyd,

618
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,855
- you went in, took off your clothes...
- All right, all right.

619
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,652
When you came in yesterday
from your walk with Carl, he was here.

620
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,953
You took your clothes off.
He saw everything.

621
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,928
Molly, you got to go to the police.
It was a set-up.

622
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,392
I was murdered.

623
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:57,991
He wants you to go to the police.

624
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:00,035
He said it was a set-up.
He was murdered.

625
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,831
- There's somebody else involved.
- Look, forget it.

626
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,530
- I don't know who, but...
- I don't want no more

627
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,608
- to do with this, okay?
- Wait.

628
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,643
- Where are you going?
- What do you mean, where am I going?

629
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,609
I'm leaving.
I did everything I said I was going to do.

630
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,204
And don't be following me,
'cause I'm finished. And I mean it.

631
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,341
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death. Goodbye.

632
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,621
Molly, there's no one
on earth besides you

633
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,556
who'd want this to be true
more than me.

634
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,493
But you've got to be rational about this.

635
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,528
I mean, Sam is no more
in this room than...

636
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:35,768
Look, I understand the need
to hang on to him.

637
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,773
I really do. But this is absurd.

638
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:42,902
I know this seems absurd.
But it had to be real.

639
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,947
How could you believe
some fortuneteller from Brooklyn

640
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,777
who just shows up at your door?

641
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:50,011
I sat there and watched her
have a conversation with him.

642
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,745
I don't buy it, Mol. Not for a minute.

643
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:56,257
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?

644
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,819
The photo that Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

645
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,630
Carl, we were alone.

646
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:05,833
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

647
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:12,630
- She said Sam knew who killed him.
- Yeah.

648
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:16,169
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.

649
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,110
We're going off the deep end here.

650
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,444
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly, good.

651
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,781
Willie Lopez.
303 Prospect Place, apartment 4D.

652
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,380
This is sick.

653
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,616
Oh, Carl.

654
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,283
This is really sick.

655
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,095
Oh, God.

656
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,363
Molly, I don't understand how you could

657
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:43,136
swallow this crap.
I mean, this guy may not even exist.

658
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:47,505
This woman, maybe she's just trying
to use you to set someone up.

659
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:52,348
You're right. You're absolutely right.

660
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:53,783
No.

661
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,915
Thas what I got to find out.

662
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,451
What do you mean, find out?
How are you gonna do that?

663
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,819
Well, she said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

664
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,358
Sam wants you to go to the police?

665
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,354
Jesus, Molly.

666
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,287
Are you out of your mind?

667
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,694
I mean,
what are you gonna tell the police?

668
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,926
Are you gonna tell them
that some storefront psychic lady's

669
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,502
been communing with the dead?

670
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,195
I mean, do you have any idea
what that sounds like?

671
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,796
You're talking ghosts here,
for Chriss sake.

672
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,102
I'm sorry.

673
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,174
Is just this stuff just really gets to me,
you know.

674
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,441
Is okay if you don't believe me.

675
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,273
I'm trying to, Molly.

676
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:39,659
Look, if ill make you feel any better,
I'll go check this out, okay?

677
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,697
Now, why don't you try
and get some sleep?

678
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,293
Okay? All right?

679
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,071
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.

680
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,663
All right. Good night.

681
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,262
Be careful.

682
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:37,816
Carl. What the hell are you doing here?

683
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,347
Who have you been talking to, Willie?

684
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,450
Talking to? What the hell do you mean?

685
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,052
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

686
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:50,394
- Now where's she getting it from, huh?
- I haven't said a word to anybody.

687
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,469
She knows your name, God damn it.
She knows where you live.

688
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,539
- A lot of women know where I live.
- This is not a joke!

689
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,402
She knows about the murder.

690
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,406
Now I want you to find this bitch,
whoever she is.

691
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:09,174
And I want you
to just get rid of her, okay?

692
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:14,518
I've got $4 million stuck
in a goddamn computer.

693
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,562
If I don't get those codes,
if that money is not transferred soon,

694
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:26,934
I'm... dead. We're both dead.

695
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,799
Why don't you tell them
you only launder money

696
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,463
on the first of the month?

697
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,871
What the hell is wrong with you?

698
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,503
Is everything a joke? You killed a man.

699
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,877
You were supposed to steal his wallet.
Was that a joke?

700
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:42,179
Man, I did you a favor, man.
That was a freebie.

701
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,150
Look, these are drug dealers, okay?

702
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:51,758
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
I'd lose my job. I could go to jail.

703
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,763
$80,000 of that money is mine.

704
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,632
Look, just let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

705
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,071
I'll get the address book myself, okay?

706
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:37,269
Bastard! You goddamn bastard!
Why? Why? You were my friend!

707
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:43,869
I had a life, God damn you. I had a life!

708
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,585
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

709
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:57,790
But she was real.

710
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,955
What? You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

711
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:08,160
You know, you told me if I had
any new information that I should come.

712
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,172
So here I am.

713
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,005
I know how this sounds.

714
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,809
I mean, I hear myself saying it
and I want to cringe.

715
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,583
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

716
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,179
Things Sam only said to me.

717
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,622
Okay, according to this psychic lady,

718
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:33,958
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place,

719
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,258
watching us all the time, huh?

720
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,231
Well, hell, I'm never gonna
get undressed again.

721
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,072
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.

722
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,882
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.

723
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,457
All I'm asking you to do is check it out.

724
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,326
Okay.

725
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:08,887
You just wait here and let me see
if the guy's got a record, all right?

726
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,326
Great.

727
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,061
What are you doing?

728
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,194
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for a Willie Lopez.

729
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:22,203
He was probably some old boyfriend
she was trying to get even with.

730
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:25,937
Now, this psychic woman's got a record
that goes back a long way.

731
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:33,581
1967, Shreveport,
forgery, selling false ID.

732
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:34,980
Served one year in 1971.

733
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,980
Baton Rouge, arrested for fraud.

734
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:43,115
Numbers racketeering,
served 10 months, 1974, and...

735
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:44,921
Look, this is impossible.

736
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:49,164
- It goes on and on.
- She knew things. Private things.

737
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:51,999
Now, how could
she have known all that?

738
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,160
A lot of times they read the obits.

739
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,467
All she had to do
was see the word "banker." Boom.

740
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:02,206
Hell, they even go through your garbage
to find things they can use.

741
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,414
Letters, old papers,
it doesn't take much.

742
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,316
No.

743
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:10,983
It was real.

744
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,251
She knew about a sweater I knitted.

745
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,756
And songs we sang.

746
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,027
Our trip to Montego Bay.

747
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,999
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

748
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,137
People want so much to believe.

749
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,941
They're grieving. They're vulnerable,

750
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:44,017
and they will give anything
for one last moment.

751
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,782
Believe me,
these people know what they're doing.

752
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:53,122
And I know how you must feel,
but you know you can press charges.

753
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,094
No.

754
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:03,666
Thank you.

755
01:04:18,551 --> 01:04:20,314
Oh, God, let this be it.

756
01:04:33,132 --> 01:04:34,463
Yes.

757
01:04:46,846 --> 01:04:47,835
Hello?

758
01:04:47,947 --> 01:04:48,971
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

759
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:50,070
- Is Carl Bruner.
- Whas up?

760
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:51,945
I'm fine. Yeah, everything's fine.
Just, we're all set.

761
01:04:52,051 --> 01:04:53,018
Good.

762
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,586
Just let me know
what you want me to do.

763
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:58,179
Okay, I want you to transfer the money
from the 12 separate accounts

764
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:01,522
into a single account
under the name Rita Miller.

765
01:05:01,627 --> 01:05:02,616
Okay.

766
01:05:02,728 --> 01:05:05,822
Tomorrow at five minutes
before closing, 3:55 p.m.,

767
01:05:06,332 --> 01:05:09,824
transfer the full account
to the First Island Bank of Nassau,

768
01:05:10,336 --> 01:05:14,067
registry number 4869580.

769
01:05:14,173 --> 01:05:17,199
- Call us when is done.
- Okay, I've got it.

770
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:22,540
Just tell Mr. Balistreri that there
won't be any more problems, okay?

771
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:23,945
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Thank you.

772
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,381
Good work, Carl.

773
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:27,243
Molly, why can't you hear me?

774
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:29,508
I need you.

775
01:06:41,794 --> 01:06:44,058
- Who is it?
- Is Carl, Molly.

776
01:06:44,964 --> 01:06:47,364
No. Don't open it, Molly.
Don't open the goddamn door.

777
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:48,433
He's a murderer.

778
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:49,501
- Hi.
- Hey.

779
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:52,628
Listen, sorry, I know is late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

780
01:06:52,872 --> 01:06:55,534
I just...
I've been thinking about you all day.

781
01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:59,702
And I feel really lousy about...
About what happened last night.

782
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,341
This supernatural thing just really...

783
01:07:01,447 --> 01:07:03,938
Listen, don't worry about it.
Really, is okay.

784
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,985
No, is not.
You needed me to hear you and I didn't.

785
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,356
I wasn't there for you, and that was...
That was wrong.

786
01:07:12,725 --> 01:07:15,990
Is just I... I just...

787
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:19,964
I want you to know
that I'm your friend, Mol.

788
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,398
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never our friend.

789
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,970
- That really means a lot to me.
- Me, too.

790
01:07:26,072 --> 01:07:28,438
So I brought you
some Japanese apple-pears.

791
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,031
I know you like them.

792
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:34,671
Thanks. Thas very sweet.

793
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,977
Could I come in for a second?
I won't stay long.

794
01:07:38,084 --> 01:07:39,108
Is just been one of those days.

795
01:07:39,218 --> 01:07:41,277
- Maybe a cup of coffee or something?
- Yeah.

796
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:43,218
- Come on in.
- No, Molly.

797
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:47,785
- You seem a little tense. Are you okay?
- No, I'm fine.

798
01:07:47,893 --> 01:07:51,158
Is just, God, what can I tell you?
Is been tough.

799
01:07:51,263 --> 01:07:53,026
Is... I mean, you know,

800
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,098
it just still hurts so much.

801
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:56,691
You lying snake.

802
01:07:57,136 --> 01:08:00,230
And then on top of it, is stuff at work.

803
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:03,274
They've given me my own accounts,
which is good.

804
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,969
But I just haven't really had time
to adjust,

805
01:08:06,846 --> 01:08:09,212
kind of absorb everything.

806
01:08:13,085 --> 01:08:14,416
Is no big deal.

807
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:25,530
Yeah.

808
01:08:27,099 --> 01:08:29,590
- Can I have just a little more cream?
- Yeah.

809
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:35,400
Oh, shit. Jesus. I can't believe I did that.

810
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:37,635
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

811
01:08:39,278 --> 01:08:40,370
Oh, God.

812
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:43,107
- Here, let me throw that in the washer.
- No, don't worry about it. Is okay.

813
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:44,307
Is just...

814
01:08:44,784 --> 01:08:47,651
- You want me to get you another shirt?
- No, is fine. Ill dry.

815
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:50,347
- Just take a minute.
- Here you go.

816
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:57,321
So where were you today?
I thought you were gonna

817
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:59,693
come into the bank
and sign those papers.

818
01:09:00,332 --> 01:09:03,028
Well, I was supposed to,
but I didn't have time.

819
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:05,436
I went to the police.

820
01:09:12,511 --> 01:09:16,470
You did? Wow, what did you tell them?
What did they say?

821
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:18,215
It was awful.

822
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:21,176
I felt really stupid.

823
01:09:22,855 --> 01:09:26,916
They brought out a file on this woman,
and... At least 10 inches thick.

824
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:31,388
- A rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly.

825
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:37,896
You know, the sad thing
is that I believed her.

826
01:09:39,038 --> 01:09:43,407
Molly, sometimes we need to believe.

827
01:09:45,544 --> 01:09:47,034
Why? Whas the point?

828
01:09:47,146 --> 01:09:50,138
Molly, it is not easy
to face the realities of life.

829
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:52,717
Sometimes you've gotta
give yourself that.

830
01:09:53,485 --> 01:09:55,953
What you've got to remember is
the love that you guys felt.

831
01:09:56,055 --> 01:09:57,079
I mean, thas whas real.

832
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:58,884
You've got to remember
how good Sam was,

833
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:00,515
how much he loved you.

834
01:10:00,626 --> 01:10:04,153
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.

835
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:20,201
I feel so alone.

836
01:10:28,787 --> 01:10:31,085
You're not alone, okay?

837
01:10:32,591 --> 01:10:36,027
You've got your work.
You're incredibly talented. You're young.

838
01:10:36,328 --> 01:10:38,387
You're fantastically gorgeous.

839
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:42,591
I don't know whas real anymore.

840
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:45,599
I don't know what to think.

841
01:10:49,308 --> 01:10:51,105
Just think about Sam.

842
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:56,514
Think about the time
you guys had together,

843
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,811
how wonderful that was.

844
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:01,979
Yeah.

845
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:05,421
Let your feelings out, Molly. Is okay.

846
01:11:06,325 --> 01:11:08,293
Life turns on a dime.

847
01:11:10,296 --> 01:11:11,456
You know?

848
01:11:13,032 --> 01:11:18,265
I mean, people think that
they have forever,

849
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:21,271
that there's always gonna be tomorrow,
but thas bullshit.

850
01:11:21,373 --> 01:11:23,068
Sam taught us that.

851
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,437
You have to live for now,

852
01:11:29,782 --> 01:11:31,716
for today.

853
01:11:51,203 --> 01:11:53,967
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Is okay.

854
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:56,906
- I can't. Is just too soon.
- Is okay.

855
01:11:57,676 --> 01:11:59,871
You've been great, Carl.

856
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:05,818
- But I need you to leave.
- Is okay. I understand, totally.

857
01:12:06,218 --> 01:12:07,344
Please.

858
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,389
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk.

859
01:12:16,495 --> 01:12:18,326
Can I interest you in that?

860
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:21,926
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

861
01:13:31,503 --> 01:13:32,470
Hey.

862
01:13:36,675 --> 01:13:39,735
- Get off my train.
- No.

863
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:43,079
Get off! Get off!

864
01:13:43,182 --> 01:13:46,015
Get off! Get off! Get off!

865
01:13:46,118 --> 01:13:49,781
- Get out of here. Get off.
- No.

866
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:51,879
Show me how you do that.

867
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,787
I want to learn,
and I'm not leaving till you teach me.

868
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:56,417
- Get off!
- No.

869
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:58,120
Get off!

870
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,231
You stubborn asshole.

871
01:14:10,342 --> 01:14:12,742
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

872
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:14,369
What do you mean, what am I...

873
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,414
You're trying to move it with your finger.

874
01:14:16,515 --> 01:14:19,211
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

875
01:14:27,559 --> 01:14:29,117
Is all in your mind.

876
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:32,858
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

877
01:14:32,965 --> 01:14:34,865
You think you're wearing those clothes?

878
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:38,459
You think you're crouched
on that floor? Bullshit!

879
01:14:38,637 --> 01:14:42,129
You ain't got a body no more, son.
Is all up here now.

880
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:45,369
If you want to move something,
you've got to move it with your mind.

881
01:14:45,477 --> 01:14:47,877
You gotta focus.
You hear what I'm saying?

882
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,777
How? How do you focus?

883
01:14:49,882 --> 01:14:52,009
I don't know how you focus.

884
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:53,641
You just focus.

885
01:14:58,023 --> 01:15:00,821
- How did you do that?
- You gotta take all your emotions,

886
01:15:00,926 --> 01:15:03,190
all your anger,
all your love, all your hate,

887
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,856
and push it way down here
into the pit of your stomach.

888
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,297
And then let it explode like a reactor.

889
01:15:12,471 --> 01:15:14,166
Okay, okay.

890
01:15:19,378 --> 01:15:20,811
Don't laugh!

891
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,396
Way to go, kid!

892
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,300
I did it.

893
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:53,142
- I did it.
- Way to go.

894
01:16:00,586 --> 01:16:02,850
From your gut, like I told you.

895
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:08,552
Give it time. What else have you got?

896
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:19,133
How long have you been here?

897
01:16:21,406 --> 01:16:22,930
Since they pushed me.

898
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:26,573
- Someone pushed you?
- Yes, someone pushed me.

899
01:16:26,945 --> 01:16:29,413
- Who?
- What, you don't believe me?

900
01:16:29,514 --> 01:16:32,108
You think I fell? You think I jumped?

901
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:33,946
Well, fuck you!

902
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:35,542
It wasn't my time.

903
01:16:35,654 --> 01:16:39,317
I wasn't supposed to go!
I'm not supposed to be here!

904
01:16:49,101 --> 01:16:52,195
Oh, I'd give anything for a drag.

905
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:55,497
Just one drag!

906
01:16:56,108 --> 01:16:57,598
Are you all right?

907
01:16:57,909 --> 01:17:00,810
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

908
01:17:01,046 --> 01:17:02,513
Who sent you?

909
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,476
Who sent you?

910
01:17:08,353 --> 01:17:13,518
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

911
01:17:56,735 --> 01:17:57,895
Yes!

912
01:18:13,618 --> 01:18:15,051
...so you need to concentrate,

913
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:17,087
'cause if you concentrate,
you'll probably rouse him.

914
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:19,714
- Now whas his name again?
- Orlando.

915
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:20,849
Orlando.

916
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:24,622
Orlando, Orlando,
is there an Orlando here?

917
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,197
- I'm here.
- He's here.

918
01:18:26,298 --> 01:18:28,095
- Oda Mae, I...
- Sam!

919
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,861
- What the hell?
- Excuse me, I'm Orlando.

920
01:18:29,968 --> 01:18:31,435
The line's over there.

921
01:18:31,536 --> 01:18:33,470
Oda Mae, where did
all these ghosts come from?

922
01:18:33,572 --> 01:18:36,268
- You can hear them, too?
- Hear them? Can I hear them?

923
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:38,570
I hear them in the morning.
I hear them in the evening.

924
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:39,939
They're coming into the shower.

925
01:18:40,045 --> 01:18:41,444
Sam, what the hell did you do to me?

926
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:43,537
Did you tell every spook in the world
you met about me?

927
01:18:43,648 --> 01:18:44,740
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

928
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:45,839
Jesus.

929
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:47,509
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

930
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:48,881
I don't even believe it.

931
01:18:48,987 --> 01:18:50,887
- Is amazing. You're really doing it.
- Yes, I know.

932
01:18:50,989 --> 01:18:52,013
How do you like that?

933
01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:56,254
- Can you two please hurry this up?
- Oh, chill out. Chill out!

934
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:57,658
Listen, I need your help again,
Oda Mae.

935
01:18:57,763 --> 01:18:59,196
- There's something we need to do.
- No.

936
01:18:59,297 --> 01:19:01,162
I'm not doing anything else
with you, Sam.

937
01:19:01,266 --> 01:19:04,793
Look, you're holding onto a life
that doesn't want you anymore.

938
01:19:04,903 --> 01:19:07,633
It doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.

939
01:19:07,739 --> 01:19:09,604
Are you speaking to me?

940
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,437
Does it look like I'm speaking to you?

941
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:12,976
You'll know when I'm talking to you.

942
01:19:13,078 --> 01:19:14,875
You supposed to be concentrating,
aren't you?

943
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:17,414
Now, you want to try it?
Thank you very much.

944
01:19:17,516 --> 01:19:18,608
Now, Sam,
are you gonna get out of here?

945
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:20,776
'Cause I got work to do.

946
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,376
Fine, then stay there.

947
01:19:22,487 --> 01:19:25,285
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You ready now?

948
01:19:26,425 --> 01:19:27,756
Les do it.

949
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:31,090
Oda Mae, listen.
I got to talk to you now. I've got a plan.

950
01:19:31,196 --> 01:19:32,356
You see, I figured this thing out.

951
01:19:32,464 --> 01:19:35,297
There's something we can do.
All we got to do is...

952
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:36,661
Oda Mae?

953
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:44,670
Oda Mae?

954
01:19:46,978 --> 01:19:48,570
Ortisha?

955
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:51,815
Orlando? Is that you?

956
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:54,511
Ortisha, where are you at?
I can't hardly see.

957
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:58,749
- Here. She's here.
- In front of you. I'm right here.

958
01:20:03,128 --> 01:20:06,029
Damn, baby!
Whad you do to your hair?

959
01:20:07,899 --> 01:20:11,232
Orlando, you like it?
Is Autumn Sunrise.

960
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,570
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!

961
01:20:21,613 --> 01:20:23,513
Don't you ever do that to me again.

962
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:24,843
Orlando!

963
01:20:27,519 --> 01:20:29,680
- I can barely move.
- Now, you should know better than that.

964
01:20:30,922 --> 01:20:33,220
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

965
01:20:33,325 --> 01:20:34,383
Everybody out!

966
01:20:34,493 --> 01:20:36,256
What happened to Orlando?

967
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,261
Where's the insurance policy?

968
01:20:38,363 --> 01:20:42,197
Are you deaf? I said everybody out!

969
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,700
Everybody out! Get out, get out, get out!

970
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:46,737
Everybody get out!

971
01:20:58,683 --> 01:21:00,082
Get out!

972
01:21:00,252 --> 01:21:02,743
- You the fortuneteller?
- Who are you?

973
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:05,385
Thas an interesting question.

974
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:07,183
Why don't you tell me?

975
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:09,157
- Willie.
- Willie?

976
01:21:10,262 --> 01:21:11,729
Prospect Place Willie?

977
01:21:11,963 --> 01:21:13,760
Get out of here! Fast!

978
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:28,607
- Sister! Sister!
- Oda Mae!

979
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:31,613
I'm all right. I'm all right.

980
01:21:34,352 --> 01:21:36,411
Oda Mae, we're in trouble,
so you've got to help me.

981
01:21:36,521 --> 01:21:39,513
What do you mean we? Who's we?
You're already dead.

982
01:21:39,624 --> 01:21:41,683
Don't you understand?
These people are trying to kill me.

983
01:21:41,793 --> 01:21:44,125
Yeah, you're right. And they'll be back.

984
01:21:44,896 --> 01:21:46,887
Look, why don't you just find a house
to haunt, you know?

985
01:21:46,998 --> 01:21:48,898
Get some chains and rattle them
or something.

986
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,491
Will you listen to me?
I have a plan and it will work.

987
01:21:51,603 --> 01:21:53,537
But you've gotta get
some of your fake IDs.

988
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:54,798
Forget it.

989
01:21:54,906 --> 01:21:58,103
If you do this, they'll never
bother you again, I promise.

990
01:22:03,081 --> 01:22:04,514
Scouts' honor.

991
01:22:05,951 --> 01:22:07,009
All right.

992
01:22:08,386 --> 01:22:11,219
What do I have to do?
What exactly do I have to do?

993
01:22:13,124 --> 01:22:14,284
You got a nice dress?

994
01:22:17,963 --> 01:22:19,828
I don't see whas wrong
with what I'm wearing.

995
01:22:19,931 --> 01:22:21,592
I'm sorry I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

996
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,396
No, I don't think you do.
You know, I think I'm gonna go home.

997
01:22:24,502 --> 01:22:26,470
I'm going home because
I don't know anything about banking.

998
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:27,629
I don't know that this is gonna work.

999
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:29,434
- Oda Mae, would you just relax?
- Listen, I'm nervous.

1000
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:30,530
Please donate.

1001
01:22:30,642 --> 01:22:32,906
I know you're nervous,
but I will get you through it.

1002
01:22:33,011 --> 01:22:36,572
- And the fake driver's license is great.
- Oh, Sam, I don't think I can do this.

1003
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:40,048
You can do it. Straight ahead of you.
A stairway that says, "New Accounts."

1004
01:22:40,151 --> 01:22:42,210
- Thas where we're going.
- I'm not giving them no money.

1005
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,515
- Just do what I say and don't talk.
- Okay.

1006
01:22:47,692 --> 01:22:50,160
Tell her you're here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1007
01:22:50,261 --> 01:22:51,250
Can I help you?

1008
01:22:51,363 --> 01:22:55,390
Yes, I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1009
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,161
And do you know your account number?

1010
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:59,702
92631043.

1011
01:22:59,804 --> 01:23:01,601
- 926...
- 31043.

1012
01:23:01,706 --> 01:23:03,230
...31043.

1013
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,507
- Rita Miller.
- Who?

1014
01:23:06,611 --> 01:23:07,976
- What?
- Tell her Rita Miller.

1015
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:09,068
Rita Miller.

1016
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,705
Didn't they have you sign a card
when you opened the account?

1017
01:23:11,816 --> 01:23:13,511
Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you
by phone

1018
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:14,607
and asked you to come in today.

1019
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,847
You see, Carl Bruner,
he opened it for me by phone,

1020
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:20,356
that account, and now he's asked me
to come in today.

1021
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,425
I see.

1022
01:23:22,861 --> 01:23:25,421
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1023
01:23:26,564 --> 01:23:27,656
All right.

1024
01:23:27,766 --> 01:23:31,566
Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

1025
01:23:31,803 --> 01:23:34,328
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

1026
01:23:40,211 --> 01:23:41,940
No, no, no! Rita Miller.

1027
01:23:42,947 --> 01:23:44,437
I'm so sorry.

1028
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:48,942
You know, I... I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

1029
01:23:55,393 --> 01:23:58,191
Now, tell her to make sure
it goes straight up to the third floor file,

1030
01:23:58,296 --> 01:23:59,593
because you have
a transaction to make.

1031
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:02,030
Please make sure this goes right up
to the third floor file,

1032
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:03,862
because I have a transfusion to make.

1033
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,698
- A what?
- Les go.

1034
01:24:07,238 --> 01:24:10,002
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

1035
01:24:11,743 --> 01:24:14,803
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.

1036
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,006
Bye-bye.

1037
01:24:17,115 --> 01:24:19,413
- I just love these pens.
- Then keep the pen.

1038
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:22,281
- Why are you always making me...
- What do you want to keep the pen for?

1039
01:24:23,888 --> 01:24:26,356
- Carl Bruner speaking.
- Hi, Carl.

1040
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:28,926
- Mr. Balistreri.
- Balistreri?

1041
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:32,224
- Carl, is me, John.
- John, John. Sorry.

1042
01:24:32,964 --> 01:24:35,125
What... What... Whas up?

1043
01:24:35,233 --> 01:24:37,394
I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio.

1044
01:24:37,502 --> 01:24:40,699
Oh, right, okay, look, I'll just...
I'll pick it up later. All right?

1045
01:24:40,805 --> 01:24:43,239
- All right. I'll be here till 6:00.
- Good.

1046
01:24:48,346 --> 01:24:49,608
This is it.

1047
01:24:49,714 --> 01:24:51,909
I don't suppose I can talk you
into losing the hat.

1048
01:24:52,016 --> 01:24:54,951
You keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

1049
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:58,515
Tell the guard you're here
to see Lyle Ferguson.

1050
01:24:58,623 --> 01:24:59,851
Lyle Ferguson.

1051
01:25:01,025 --> 01:25:03,516
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

1052
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:06,188
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I'm here for my health.

1053
01:25:06,297 --> 01:25:08,060
Don't say that.
Tell him Rita Miller's here.

1054
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:10,396
You just tell him Rita Miller's here.

1055
01:25:10,502 --> 01:25:12,163
Just one moment, please.

1056
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:13,559
Don't embellish.

1057
01:25:15,406 --> 01:25:16,737
Excuse me?

1058
01:25:20,311 --> 01:25:23,280
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

1059
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:26,441
I've known him for five years,
and he still thinks my name's...

1060
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:30,681
- Why are you whispering?
- Just be quiet and listen.

1061
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:33,553
He's a social moron, so you don't have
anything to worry about.

1062
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:35,558
Just tell the guard Ferguson knows you.

1063
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,823
You spent time with him
and his wife, Shirley,

1064
01:25:37,929 --> 01:25:40,796
at the Brewster's Christmas party
last year. Got it?

1065
01:25:40,965 --> 01:25:43,934
- What is this in regards to?
- What?

1066
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:45,161
He doesn't remember me?

1067
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:48,467
Oh, we spent all that time at the
Brewster's Christmas party last year.

1068
01:25:48,573 --> 01:25:51,599
He and his lovely wife, Shirley.
It was beautiful.

1069
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:55,543
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere. It...

1070
01:25:57,882 --> 01:25:59,110
Gas.

1071
01:26:00,518 --> 01:26:03,919
I get a little gas from time to time.
Thas all. Gas.

1072
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:08,882
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it.

1073
01:26:10,061 --> 01:26:11,085
Now, listen, this'll be easy.

1074
01:26:11,196 --> 01:26:12,720
Ferguson was so drunk at that party,

1075
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:14,662
he coulïve had a conversation
with Tina Turner

1076
01:26:14,766 --> 01:26:16,461
and he wouldn't remember.

1077
01:26:20,371 --> 01:26:23,499
- I don't know, Sam.
- Here we go.

1078
01:26:27,145 --> 01:26:29,443
Hello. Hello. Yes.

1079
01:26:31,616 --> 01:26:35,052
Of course, yes.
Well, is been a long time.

1080
01:26:35,153 --> 01:26:36,552
Oh, a long time.

1081
01:26:36,654 --> 01:26:38,019
Ask how Bobby and Snooky are doing.

1082
01:26:38,122 --> 01:26:40,590
By the way,
how are Bobby and Snooky doing?

1083
01:26:40,692 --> 01:26:43,354
Fine. Fine. Thank you.

1084
01:26:43,795 --> 01:26:45,285
Thank you for asking.

1085
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:49,723
And how is your family?

1086
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:51,426
Oh, couldn't be better.

1087
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:54,095
Well, wonderful.

1088
01:26:55,139 --> 01:26:58,074
Tell him you've been wondering
how they did on the Gibraltar securities.

1089
01:26:58,176 --> 01:27:02,135
I was just wondering, how did you do
on the Gibraltar securities?

1090
01:27:02,547 --> 01:27:04,981
The Gibraltar securities?

1091
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:08,177
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

1092
01:27:08,286 --> 01:27:10,117
- We sure did.
- We sure did.

1093
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:12,416
- That was a very useful tip.
- Good old Randy.

1094
01:27:12,523 --> 01:27:14,388
- Good old Randy.
- Right.

1095
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:15,982
Got a good old head on his shoulders.

1096
01:27:16,094 --> 01:27:17,254
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders.

1097
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:19,853
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.

1098
01:27:19,964 --> 01:27:24,025
Yeah. So, what...
What brings you here today?

1099
01:27:24,502 --> 01:27:27,300
- You're closing an account.
- I'm closing an account.

1100
01:27:27,405 --> 01:27:29,839
Well, wonderful.
Do you have your account number?

1101
01:27:29,941 --> 01:27:30,965
- Yes?
- Yes.

1102
01:27:31,075 --> 01:27:33,134
- Yes.
- 92631043.

1103
01:27:33,244 --> 01:27:36,839
92631043.

1104
01:27:36,948 --> 01:27:37,972
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1105
01:27:38,082 --> 01:27:39,208
Good.

1106
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:50,950
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

1107
01:27:51,062 --> 01:27:53,087
$4 million from us today.

1108
01:27:53,197 --> 01:27:55,961
- $4 million?
- Say yes. Say yes!

1109
01:27:56,501 --> 01:27:58,628
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1110
01:27:58,736 --> 01:28:01,569
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

1111
01:28:02,373 --> 01:28:04,432
- Thas correct. Yes.
- Easy, easy.

1112
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:06,702
Yes.

1113
01:28:07,712 --> 01:28:09,612
Well, how would you like that?

1114
01:28:10,515 --> 01:28:12,449
- Tens and twenties.
- Pardon?

1115
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:14,415
Cashier's check.
Tell him a cashier's check.

1116
01:28:14,519 --> 01:28:16,077
I think better, a cashier's check.

1117
01:28:16,187 --> 01:28:18,849
A cashier's check. Fine.

1118
01:28:19,023 --> 01:28:23,960
Well, of course, you know,
we require identification from everyone.

1119
01:28:24,062 --> 01:28:25,529
- Is just procedural.
- Oh, ID! Yes.

1120
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,029
You know, I...

1121
01:28:37,675 --> 01:28:41,236
Thank you. Well, I'll be right back.

1122
01:28:42,747 --> 01:28:44,339
$4 million!

1123
01:28:51,089 --> 01:28:54,650
Yeah, get me the First Island Bank
of Nassau. Is on the Rolodex.

1124
01:29:04,802 --> 01:29:08,499
Well, we have some things for you
to sign here.

1125
01:29:08,606 --> 01:29:11,006
This officially closes the account.

1126
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:14,101
And here you are.

1127
01:29:14,212 --> 01:29:16,271
Now, sign Rita Miller.

1128
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:21,247
Rita Miller. Thas my name.

1129
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:24,779
My name. Rita Miller. My name.

1130
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:26,882
My name.

1131
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,683
- Molly, hi. Is good to see you.
- Hi.

1132
01:29:29,794 --> 01:29:32,991
- Oda Mae, I'll be right back.
- A few more if you would, please.

1133
01:29:33,097 --> 01:29:34,496
Just anywhere?

1134
01:29:34,599 --> 01:29:35,930
Right here.

1135
01:29:41,572 --> 01:29:42,834
Fine.

1136
01:29:43,074 --> 01:29:45,065
The check.

1137
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:49,537
This... Here you are.

1138
01:29:50,148 --> 01:29:51,877
The person you need to see
is right down at the end.

1139
01:29:51,983 --> 01:29:53,245
Okay, thanks.

1140
01:29:58,389 --> 01:30:01,256
Mama took the money
that she made in the oil wells,

1141
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:03,327
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

1142
01:30:03,428 --> 01:30:05,191
You know,
how they have at the gas station?

1143
01:30:05,296 --> 01:30:07,526
And those gas stations
have five or six of those things,

1144
01:30:07,632 --> 01:30:09,259
so is very, very lucrative.

1145
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:11,130
- Oda Mae.
- It really adds up.

1146
01:30:11,235 --> 01:30:13,226
- Oda Mae, we've gotta go. Say goodbye.
- Well, gotta go now.

1147
01:30:13,337 --> 01:30:16,272
Is been a pleasure doing business
with you, a real pleasure.

1148
01:30:16,374 --> 01:30:17,932
Now, may I keep the pen?

1149
01:30:18,042 --> 01:30:19,737
Say good night to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

1150
01:30:19,844 --> 01:30:21,812
I'll see you. Bye-bye.

1151
01:30:22,313 --> 01:30:24,213
Why are you rushing me?

1152
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,482
What is wrong?

1153
01:30:40,398 --> 01:30:42,730
- Excuse me. Lyle?
- Oh, yes...

1154
01:30:43,134 --> 01:30:44,726
- Molly Jensen.
- Molly.

1155
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:47,464
The woman you were
just doing business with.

1156
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:49,199
- Yeah?
- What did she want?

1157
01:30:49,307 --> 01:30:52,401
I mean, did it have anything
to do with me or with Sam?

1158
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:54,603
Sam? Why, no. No.

1159
01:30:55,446 --> 01:30:59,177
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right?
- No, her name was Rita Miller,

1160
01:30:59,283 --> 01:31:01,410
and she was closing an account.

1161
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:06,148
- Why? Is there a problem?
- No. I guess not.

1162
01:31:06,491 --> 01:31:07,753
Thank you.

1163
01:31:37,288 --> 01:31:39,518
Carl, is something wrong?

1164
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:41,989
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

1165
01:31:42,093 --> 01:31:44,687
- What?
- One of my accounts is closed.

1166
01:31:44,795 --> 01:31:48,822
Which account? Whas wrong?
You want me to call someone?

1167
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,697
No, is okay. I can do it. I got it.

1168
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,637
$4 million!

1169
01:31:57,742 --> 01:31:59,676
Oh, my God,
what am I gonna do with this money?

1170
01:31:59,777 --> 01:32:01,335
I... You know,
I'm gonna buy the building.

1171
01:32:01,445 --> 01:32:03,174
No, no, wait. I'm gonna buy the block.

1172
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:04,873
I'm gonna make my sister
go to a fat farm,

1173
01:32:04,982 --> 01:32:06,210
because, you know, she's way too big.

1174
01:32:06,317 --> 01:32:07,477
Whoa, wait! What are you gonna do...

1175
01:32:07,585 --> 01:32:09,143
Then I'm gonna...
Yeah, I'm gonna buy the building.

1176
01:32:09,253 --> 01:32:11,414
Wait, wait, wait, Oda Mae,
I've got an idea.

1177
01:32:11,522 --> 01:32:14,218
- Take the check out of your purse.
- Oh, you're right. You're right.

1178
01:32:14,325 --> 01:32:16,816
I should take it out.
I should put it where nobody can get it.

1179
01:32:16,928 --> 01:32:19,089
No, no, no. Endorse it.

1180
01:32:20,064 --> 01:32:23,124
No, if I endorse it, then if I drop it,
somebody will get it. No, I'll just...

1181
01:32:23,234 --> 01:32:24,861
Is not your money.

1182
01:32:24,969 --> 01:32:27,403
I never said
you were gonna get the money.

1183
01:32:27,705 --> 01:32:29,832
This is blood money.
I was killed for this money.

1184
01:32:29,941 --> 01:32:32,705
- Now, endorse the check.
- I know, but...

1185
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:35,176
Well, Sam,
what are you gonna do with it?

1186
01:32:35,746 --> 01:32:38,874
Look over there, to your left.

1187
01:32:43,054 --> 01:32:46,649
I know you don't think I'm giving this
$4 million to a bunch of nuns!

1188
01:32:46,757 --> 01:32:49,089
Oda Mae, if you don't do it,
they will track you down.

1189
01:32:49,193 --> 01:32:51,559
Your only protection is to get rid of it.

1190
01:32:51,662 --> 01:32:54,563
Oh, Sam, come on. You're killing me!
Is $4 million!

1191
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:56,929
Just think of it this way,
you'll go to heaven.

1192
01:32:57,034 --> 01:32:58,160
I don't want to go to heaven!

1193
01:32:58,269 --> 01:33:01,102
I want to go to a bank
and cash the goddamn check!

1194
01:33:04,408 --> 01:33:05,932
- Hello.
- Yeah.

1195
01:33:06,043 --> 01:33:08,511
- You'll thank me later.
- How are you doing?

1196
01:33:10,314 --> 01:33:12,544
- Now, endorse it Rita Miller.
- I know.

1197
01:33:13,517 --> 01:33:15,883
Make it out to St. Joseph's Shelter.

1198
01:33:16,487 --> 01:33:18,955
I can't believe you're making me do this.

1199
01:33:24,161 --> 01:33:25,150
Now, give it to her.

1200
01:33:25,263 --> 01:33:28,164
I will, I will. I just want to feel it
one more time in my fingers, thas all.

1201
01:33:28,266 --> 01:33:30,530
- Just give the lady the check.
- I will!

1202
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:35,764
Hand her the check. You can do it.

1203
01:33:38,342 --> 01:33:41,334
- Give her the check.
- I will.

1204
01:33:44,448 --> 01:33:47,349
Bless you, child. Bless you.

1205
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:57,853
Give it to her. Let go. Let go!

1206
01:33:59,297 --> 01:34:00,821
Shit.

1207
01:34:05,002 --> 01:34:06,333
I'm proud of you, Oda Mae.

1208
01:34:06,437 --> 01:34:08,405
You know something, Sam?
I don't care if you're proud of me.

1209
01:34:08,506 --> 01:34:11,100
You stay away from me from now on.
What is that nun going to do with it?

1210
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:13,608
She can't even buy underwear. Nothing.
I hate you. Leave me alone.

1211
01:34:13,711 --> 01:34:15,303
Never talk to me again.

1212
01:34:16,013 --> 01:34:18,208
I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.

1213
01:34:54,218 --> 01:34:56,550
Go ahead, search. You'll never find it.

1214
01:34:58,689 --> 01:35:00,657
They're gonna kill you, Carl.

1215
01:35:00,758 --> 01:35:03,818
You and Willie,
you're gonna be fertilizer.

1216
01:35:04,595 --> 01:35:07,359
They're gonna bury you
right next to Jimmy Hoffa.

1217
01:35:51,742 --> 01:35:53,141
Who's doing that?

1218
01:35:54,145 --> 01:35:55,772
Who's doing that?

1219
01:36:11,762 --> 01:36:12,888
- Hey.
- Hi.

1220
01:36:12,997 --> 01:36:14,862
Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.

1221
01:36:14,965 --> 01:36:18,662
I know, Mol. I'm sorry.
Things got a little crazy. I just forgot.

1222
01:36:18,769 --> 01:36:20,293
Yeah, had a little trouble at the bank.

1223
01:36:20,404 --> 01:36:21,428
- You forgot?
- Yeah.

1224
01:36:21,539 --> 01:36:22,733
You know, I wish you would have
called me,

1225
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,432
because I've been really worried.

1226
01:36:25,843 --> 01:36:28,403
Listen to me, Molly,
I gotta ask you about something.

1227
01:36:28,512 --> 01:36:30,571
Yeah, he needs to borrow $4 million.

1228
01:36:30,681 --> 01:36:33,946
When you said that you thought
that Sam was here,

1229
01:36:34,051 --> 01:36:35,245
that he was talking to you,

1230
01:36:35,352 --> 01:36:37,582
what did you feel?
What did he say to you?

1231
01:36:37,688 --> 01:36:39,087
Why? What does that have
to do with anything?

1232
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:41,454
Is just... Listen to me for a second.

1233
01:36:41,992 --> 01:36:43,721
This psychic lady,
I want to know what she told you.

1234
01:36:43,828 --> 01:36:47,662
- I wanna know exactly what she said.
- Carl, let me go. Carl, stop this.

1235
01:36:49,567 --> 01:36:52,195
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.

1236
01:36:53,771 --> 01:36:56,035
What the hell happened to you tonight?

1237
01:36:56,507 --> 01:36:59,943
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

1238
01:37:03,147 --> 01:37:04,512
The bank?

1239
01:37:05,249 --> 01:37:08,047
Yeah, Ferguson said she closed
an account.

1240
01:37:08,652 --> 01:37:12,782
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
Is Rita Miller or something.

1241
01:37:16,961 --> 01:37:18,895
Carl, are you all right?

1242
01:37:21,432 --> 01:37:23,332
Is just my stomach...

1243
01:37:26,203 --> 01:37:27,170
Jesus.

1244
01:37:27,638 --> 01:37:30,937
Do you have any, like, I don't know,
some Pepto-Bismol or something?

1245
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:32,906
- Cyanide.
- Yeah. Is upstairs.

1246
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:36,241
Why don't you sit down, and I'll get it?

1247
01:37:41,952 --> 01:37:45,046
Whas wrong? Does little Carl
have a little tummy ache?

1248
01:37:47,157 --> 01:37:49,125
What are you doing to me?

1249
01:37:52,429 --> 01:37:54,590
Now do you believe in ghosts?

1250
01:37:58,536 --> 01:38:01,027
I'll set the place on fire, I swear to God.

1251
01:38:08,579 --> 01:38:11,275
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl.

1252
01:38:12,616 --> 01:38:15,915
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.

1253
01:38:19,089 --> 01:38:22,149
I need that money,
and I want it tonight at 11:00.

1254
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:25,254
If that psychic lady
does not bring it here,

1255
01:38:25,362 --> 01:38:27,523
Molly is dead. Okay?

1256
01:38:28,566 --> 01:38:31,967
- Carl, who are you talking to?
- Nothing. Now, Molly, listen to me.

1257
01:38:32,069 --> 01:38:33,627
I have to go, okay?

1258
01:38:33,737 --> 01:38:36,035
I can't explain this now,
but there is a problem, okay?

1259
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,472
- Something's going on at the bank.
- Carl, you're really scaring me.

1260
01:38:38,576 --> 01:38:40,373
I'm sorry, Mol.
Look, I don't have time to talk now,

1261
01:38:40,477 --> 01:38:41,671
but I'll come back about 11:00.

1262
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:43,610
- Why? Why not now?
- Molly, I can't talk now.

1263
01:38:43,714 --> 01:38:47,013
Molly, look, I'll come back.
What do you say? Like, 11:00, okay?

1264
01:38:47,117 --> 01:38:48,516
I'm sorry to do this to you, Molly,

1265
01:38:48,619 --> 01:38:50,109
but is really important.
I gotta go. Okay?

1266
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:52,085
- 11:00.
- Oda Mae!

1267
01:38:55,826 --> 01:38:59,159
I'm Arsenio Hall.
Don't try to adjust your television.

1268
01:38:59,263 --> 01:39:00,287
I'm black.

1269
01:39:01,932 --> 01:39:05,026
- I want to watch Love Connection.
- I love Love Connection.

1270
01:39:05,135 --> 01:39:07,968
- I love that man on there.
- Leave that! Thas Arsenio.

1271
01:39:08,072 --> 01:39:09,699
- So?
- What do you mean, so?

1272
01:39:09,807 --> 01:39:12,002
You love Love Connection,
you ought to send your picture in there.

1273
01:39:12,109 --> 01:39:13,599
She did already.

1274
01:39:13,711 --> 01:39:15,474
They just haven't answered yet.

1275
01:39:15,579 --> 01:39:17,570
- Oda Mae?
- Sam?

1276
01:39:17,681 --> 01:39:19,478
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Oda Mae, we're in trouble.

1277
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:20,948
They want the check,
and they're coming for you.

1278
01:39:21,051 --> 01:39:22,075
So you gotta get out of here.

1279
01:39:22,186 --> 01:39:23,483
What do you mean,
they want the check?

1280
01:39:23,587 --> 01:39:25,680
The check you said
they would never know about?

1281
01:39:25,789 --> 01:39:27,950
- Oda Mae, whas happening?
- Sam.

1282
01:39:28,058 --> 01:39:30,424
They're here! They're here!
Get out of here! Now! Go!

1283
01:39:30,527 --> 01:39:32,427
- Come on. We gotta go!
- Whas the matter?

1284
01:39:32,763 --> 01:39:34,094
Come on, come on!

1285
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:45,337
Just knock on the door here.

1286
01:39:45,776 --> 01:39:48,006
Help! Help!

1287
01:39:48,112 --> 01:39:51,479
- Is an emergency. You gotta let us in.
- Who are you kidding?

1288
01:40:00,491 --> 01:40:01,651
Open up!

1289
01:40:02,459 --> 01:40:04,256
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.

1290
01:40:04,361 --> 01:40:07,592
The cat don't like visitors.
She'll pee all over that...

1291
01:40:16,674 --> 01:40:18,437
They're gonna get us.

1292
01:40:19,777 --> 01:40:20,869
Where's Sam?

1293
01:40:20,978 --> 01:40:24,505
- Shit! It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.

1294
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,218
Carl?

1295
01:40:55,479 --> 01:40:56,810
Shit!

1296
01:41:27,511 --> 01:41:28,500
Willie!

1297
01:41:37,654 --> 01:41:40,487
Hey, man,
you got a serious problem, man.

1298
01:42:02,713 --> 01:42:05,443
Help me! Help!

1299
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:03,836
That dude is dead.

1300
01:43:09,613 --> 01:43:11,103
You're dead, Willie.

1301
01:43:32,469 --> 01:43:38,374
No! No! No!

1302
01:43:41,011 --> 01:43:42,876
Help me!

1303
01:44:05,302 --> 01:44:07,099
Tell the driver to hurry.

1304
01:44:07,938 --> 01:44:09,633
Yo, man, you wanna step on it, please?

1305
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:12,334
Listen, lady, I'm driving as fast as I can.

1306
01:44:20,817 --> 01:44:21,909
Problems?

1307
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:32,124
- Carl, is that you?
- No, is me, Oda Mae.

1308
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:34,322
Listen. Molly,
I know what you think of me.

1309
01:44:34,431 --> 01:44:36,626
I know what you think of me,
but, look, you gotta talk to me.

1310
01:44:36,733 --> 01:44:38,564
You are in serious danger.

1311
01:44:38,969 --> 01:44:40,231
I got Sam here with me.

1312
01:44:40,337 --> 01:44:43,397
- We got to come in and talk to you.
- Get the hell out of here.

1313
01:44:43,507 --> 01:44:45,498
- I'm calling the police.
- Good.

1314
01:44:45,609 --> 01:44:47,907
- Tell her to do it.
- Fine. Thas what we want you to do.

1315
01:44:48,011 --> 01:44:49,478
We want you to call the police.

1316
01:44:49,579 --> 01:44:51,410
- But you've gotta let us in.
- No.

1317
01:44:52,249 --> 01:44:53,580
Look, don't you get it?

1318
01:44:53,684 --> 01:44:56,653
Sam was not just accidentally killed.
He was murdered.

1319
01:44:56,753 --> 01:44:59,654
He found out that Carl
was laundering money at the bank.

1320
01:44:59,756 --> 01:45:02,850
Now, this guy Carl is dangerous.
I'm telling you, he tried to kill me.

1321
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,825
He's gonna try to kill you, too.

1322
01:45:04,928 --> 01:45:07,362
You are in deep, deep trouble.

1323
01:45:07,497 --> 01:45:09,465
Why are you doing this to me?

1324
01:45:10,167 --> 01:45:12,032
Why are you doing this to me?

1325
01:45:12,235 --> 01:45:14,396
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this to me?

1326
01:45:14,504 --> 01:45:18,099
I can't. I just... I just can't.

1327
01:45:18,208 --> 01:45:21,700
Oda Mae, Oda Mae,
tell her she's wearing the shirt

1328
01:45:21,812 --> 01:45:23,837
that I spilled the margarita on

1329
01:45:23,947 --> 01:45:26,381
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

1330
01:45:27,184 --> 01:45:29,311
Molly, Sam says to tell you
you're wearing the shirt

1331
01:45:29,419 --> 01:45:31,011
that he spilled the margarita on

1332
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:33,715
and the earrings he gave you
for Christmas.

1333
01:45:40,163 --> 01:45:43,655
Don't you see?
I'm not a fake, not about this.

1334
01:45:48,939 --> 01:45:51,305
- Give me a penny, quick.
- What?

1335
01:45:51,541 --> 01:45:53,008
Push a penny under the door, now.

1336
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:55,010
What you be talking about,
push a penny under the door?

1337
01:45:55,112 --> 01:45:56,670
Just do it.

1338
01:46:34,284 --> 01:46:37,447
- Tell her is for luck.
- Sam says is for luck.

1339
01:47:13,857 --> 01:47:14,091
We're between Greene and Mercer
on Prince.

1340
01:47:14,091 --> 01:47:16,218
We're between Greene and Mercer
on Prince.

1341
01:47:16,326 --> 01:47:19,454
Is the gray building right across
from the post office.

1342
01:47:19,663 --> 01:47:22,894
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry.
We'll be waiting.

1343
01:47:24,034 --> 01:47:26,332
- All right. They're on their way.
- Good.

1344
01:47:28,805 --> 01:47:32,036
- So, what do we do now?
- Just wait.

1345
01:47:42,352 --> 01:47:43,785
Is Sam here?

1346
01:47:45,322 --> 01:47:46,516
Sam?

1347
01:47:48,091 --> 01:47:49,683
I'm sitting beside her.

1348
01:47:51,595 --> 01:47:53,529
He's sitting right beside you.

1349
01:48:03,406 --> 01:48:05,033
Sam, can you feel me?

1350
01:48:07,144 --> 01:48:08,543
With all my heart.

1351
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,980
He says with all his heart.

1352
01:48:24,528 --> 01:48:27,520
I'd give anything
if I could just touch you once more.

1353
01:48:31,902 --> 01:48:33,096
He says he wishes

1354
01:48:33,703 --> 01:48:36,035
he was alive again,
so he could touch you.

1355
01:48:38,808 --> 01:48:40,036
Me, too.

1356
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,789
Okay. Okay, look. You can use me.

1357
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:05,425
- Use you?
- You can use my body.

1358
01:49:05,535 --> 01:49:06,559
Use your body?

1359
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:08,331
Just do it quick
before I change my mind.

1360
01:52:14,524 --> 01:52:15,684
Molly?

1361
01:52:17,427 --> 01:52:18,985
Molly, are you home?

1362
01:52:19,195 --> 01:52:20,321
Is Carl.

1363
01:52:21,164 --> 01:52:22,256
Molly!

1364
01:52:22,365 --> 01:52:23,491
Fire escape.

1365
01:52:30,907 --> 01:52:32,499
Whas happening to me?

1366
01:52:36,713 --> 01:52:37,839
Molly?

1367
01:52:39,215 --> 01:52:40,341
Molly?

1368
01:52:49,159 --> 01:52:50,126
Molly!

1369
01:52:51,194 --> 01:52:52,684
Son of a bitch.

1370
01:53:05,842 --> 01:53:07,400
Come on.

1371
01:53:10,513 --> 01:53:12,242
Molly, look. Look.

1372
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:15,645
Oh, les go. Les go.

1373
01:53:25,228 --> 01:53:26,490
Molly!

1374
01:53:26,896 --> 01:53:28,887
Just get away from us, Carl.

1375
01:53:32,135 --> 01:53:34,126
- Molly!
- You're just a liar. Liar!

1376
01:53:34,237 --> 01:53:36,137
Molly, you got to listen to me.
This woman's a thief.

1377
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:37,836
- She's a con artist.
- Why?

1378
01:53:37,941 --> 01:53:40,876
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't listen to her, Molly.

1379
01:53:42,612 --> 01:53:43,977
Stop!

1380
01:53:44,113 --> 01:53:46,479
Just get away from us, Carl.
I've called the police.

1381
01:53:46,583 --> 01:53:47,550
Molly!

1382
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,622
Shit.

1383
01:54:01,397 --> 01:54:05,163
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- Don't interfere, Molly. She's a thief.

1384
01:54:06,135 --> 01:54:08,899
All right, the check.
Just give me the check.

1385
01:54:09,038 --> 01:54:11,165
- Carl, no.
- Stay out of this, Molly!

1386
01:54:16,779 --> 01:54:17,746
Son of a bitch!

1387
01:54:18,348 --> 01:54:20,111
Keep out of this, Molly!

1388
01:54:21,484 --> 01:54:23,452
Get off of me!

1389
01:54:28,758 --> 01:54:32,216
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it, God damn it!

1390
01:54:32,795 --> 01:54:35,263
- I gave it away.
- You're lying to me.

1391
01:54:35,665 --> 01:54:38,634
Don't lie to me, God damn it!

1392
01:54:39,235 --> 01:54:41,396
The check.

1393
01:54:54,984 --> 01:54:58,215
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to God, I'll kill her.

1394
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:10,199
Just... Look, just give me the check,
Sam. Okay?

1395
01:55:11,167 --> 01:55:14,034
I promise you I'll let her go
if you'll just give it to me.

1396
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:15,632
Okay?

1397
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,007
Sam?

1398
01:55:20,410 --> 01:55:21,604
Sam?

1399
01:56:38,254 --> 01:56:39,721
Sam.

1400
01:56:42,325 --> 01:56:45,453
- Oh, Carl.
- What?

1401
01:57:19,228 --> 01:57:20,195
No!

1402
01:57:53,663 --> 01:57:55,187
Are you two all right?

1403
01:57:59,302 --> 01:58:00,462
Sam?

1404
01:58:03,473 --> 01:58:04,599
Molly?

1405
01:58:07,043 --> 01:58:08,408
I can hear you.

1406
01:58:45,014 --> 01:58:46,641
Oh, God.

1407
01:59:34,497 --> 01:59:38,194
Sam? They're waiting for you, Sam.

1408
01:59:49,712 --> 01:59:51,236
I'll miss you.

1409
01:59:53,249 --> 01:59:55,410
Your mother'd be proud.

1410
01:59:55,751 --> 01:59:57,582
I'm gonna miss you, too, Sam.

1411
01:59:58,855 --> 02:00:00,379
You're all right.

1412
02:00:01,858 --> 02:00:03,257
Bye, Oda Mae.

1413
02:00:04,727 --> 02:00:05,955
Bye, Sam.

1414
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:30,483
I love you, Molly.

1415
02:00:33,155 --> 02:00:34,850
I've always loved you.

1416
02:00:41,964 --> 02:00:43,226
Ditto.

1417
02:01:04,487 --> 02:01:06,045
Is amazing, Molly.

1418
02:01:07,456 --> 02:01:11,415
The love inside, you take it with you.

1419
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:24,267
See you.

1420
02:01:31,914 --> 02:01:33,108
See you.

1421
02:01:52,168 --> 02:01:53,465
Bye.
