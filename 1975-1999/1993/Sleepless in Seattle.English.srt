2
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:41,816
Mommy got sick.

3
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,826
It happened just like that.

4
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:48,227
There was nothing anybody could do.

5
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,299
It isn't fair.

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,368
There's no reason.

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,600
But if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

8
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,524
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one
of them. They're done. Ready to eat.

9
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,037
Do you know how to make juice?

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,743
Microwave. Five minutes.

11
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:55,088
Here.

12
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,666
My shrink. Call him.

13
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:09,043
"Loss of Spouse Support Group.

14
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,948
Chicago Cancer Family Network.

15
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,610
Parents Without Partners.
Partners Without Parents.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,746
Hug Yourself. Hug a Friend.
Hug a Shrink. "

17
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,824
Or work. Work hard.

18
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:27,158
Work will save you. Work is the only
thing that will see you through this.

19
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,935
Don't mind him. He's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

20
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:45,576
What I think we really
need is a change.

21
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:49,812
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks off.
Get some sun. Take Jonah fishing.

22
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,624
No, a real change.

23
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:58,626
A new city.

24
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:03,324
Someplace where every time I go around
a corner I don't think of Maggie.

25
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,341
<i>Where you gonna go?</i>

26
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,906
I was thinking about Seattle.

27
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:24,715
Eventually, in a few months,
you'll start seeing women.

28
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,755
- You'll meet someone.
- Right.

29
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:29,416
Move on. Right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

30
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:32,324
And then in a few months, boom, I'll
be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

31
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,590
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- She didn't mean that.

32
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:38,691
I know. Look,
it just doesn't happen twice.

33
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:42,536
<i>You must remember this</i>

34
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,540
<i>A kiss is still a kiss</i>

35
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,770
<i>A sigh is just a sigh</i>

36
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,608
<i>The fundamental things apply</i>

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,245
<i>As time goes by</i>

38
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:06,453
<i>And when two lovers woo</i>

39
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,396
<i>They still say, I love you</i>

40
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,468
<i>On that you can rely</i>

41
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:20,469
<i>No matter what the future brings</i>

42
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:23,307
<i>As time goes by</i>

43
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:30,544
<i>Moonlight and love songs</i>

44
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:33,451
<i>Never out of date</i>

45
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,024
<i>Hearts full of passion</i>

46
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:39,254
<i>Jealousy and hate</i>

47
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,660
<i>Woman needs man</i>

48
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,529
<i>And man must have his mate</i>

49
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:49,094
<i>That no one can deny</i>

50
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,238
<i>It's still the same old story</i>

51
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,244
<i>A fight for love and glory</i>

52
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:59,315
<i>A case of do or die</i>

53
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:07,187
<i>The world will
always welcome lovers</i>

54
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,993
<i>As time</i>

55
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:14,996
<i>Goes by</i>

56
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,407
The tall one with red hair
is your cousin Irene.

57
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,675
You'll recognize her by
the disappointed look on her face.

58
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,980
Who was married to Harold
who ran off with his secretary.

59
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,750
But came back because Irene threatened
to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.

60
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:44,258
Your brother Dennis
is a professor at Johns Hopkins.

61
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:49,188
He's married to Betsy.

62
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,597
The most competitive woman
in the world.

63
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,601
I don't see how
I'm gonna remember all this.

64
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:56,297
Oh, well, Walter, you will.

65
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,746
Your Uncle Milton
lost all of his money-

66
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:14,051
- And some other people's.
- In a pyramid scheme.

67
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:17,456
Don't mention the IRS
or the federal prison system.

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,257
Your mother's Barbara.
Your father's Cliff.

69
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:25,425
- My father has electric trains.
- Really?

70
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,629
Am I what they had in mind?

71
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,764
Oh, Walter,
they're gonna love you.

72
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,277
<i>Everybody.</i>

73
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,847
Annie has an announcement.

74
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:44,280
Walter and I are engaged.

75
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,320
Thank you. Thank you.

76
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:54,825
Dad, Mom knew.

77
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:58,264
- I don't see a ring, Annie.
- I don't have a ring yet.

78
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,268
Congratulations.

79
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,366
Bless you. Bless you.

80
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,968
- Oh, my goodness.
- Are you all right?

81
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:11,046
- It's nothing.
- Maybe it's the flowers.

82
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,980
- We'll move them.
- No! Don't touch them!

83
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,483
I feel terrible,
sneezing at a time like this.

84
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,611
This is a very
important moment for me.

85
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,746
He's allergic to everything.
Don't worry about it.

86
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,917
Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

87
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,928
Harold is allergic
to every type of bee.

88
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,932
We always have to carry a hypodermic
of adrenaline wherever we go.

89
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,434
If he eats even
one tiny piece of a nut-

90
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,972
My head swells up like
a watermelon, and I drop dead.

91
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:39,735
It's the same
with Harold and bees.

92
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:44,302
Your mother and I had salmon at our
wedding. A wedding without cold salmon-

93
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:47,349
- I'm not allergic to salmon.
- Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

94
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,975
I don't think,
but you never know.

95
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:53,647
- You never know.
- Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

96
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:57,658
Honey, what a shame. We had
some champagne. What did we use it for?

97
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,990
- Uncle Milton's parole.
- And it was delicious.

98
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:01,757
It was, wasn't it, Milton?

99
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,855
When are you getting married?

100
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,198
- In early June, in the garden.
- Does it have to be in the garden?

101
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:10,932
- What a great idea.
- What about Harold and bees?

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,373
- I'm allergic to bees.
- We'll spray you.

103
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:18,277
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries.

104
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:21,839
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

105
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,112
Allergic to strawberries.

106
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,348
Is this all right
with you, Walter?

107
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,789
Today I consider myself
the luckiest...

108
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:33,623
m- m-man on the f-f-face
of the E-E-Earth.

109
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,995
The Lou Gehrig line.
Remember? Remember, Dad?

110
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,261
<i>- The Lou Gehrig line from-
- Pride of the Yankees.</i>

111
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:41,496
<i>- Pride of the Yankees!
- Pride of the Yankees.</i>

112
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,005
- It's baseball.
- A historical reference.

113
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,909
I would like to propose a toast
to my kid sister.

114
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,743
To Walter and my baby.

115
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,750
To Walter and Annie.

116
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:01,321
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.

117
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:05,690
Here it is.

118
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,788
The historical society wanted this,
and I never would give it to them.

119
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,060
Oh, Mom!

120
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:14,796
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

121
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:19,273
- Grandmother's dress.
- Oh, honey.

122
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,843
He's a lovely man, Annie.

123
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:26,972
I know. He is wonderful, isn't he?
And he's such a wonderful athlete.

124
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,210
- Are his folks nice?
- You'll love them.

125
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,186
We're going down to D.C. Tonight
to be with them Christmas morning.

126
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:36,452
- How did it happen?
- Well, it's silly, really.

127
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,460
I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously, I'd seen him.

128
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,462
He's the associate publisher.

129
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:45,398
One day we both ordered sandwiches
from the same place.

130
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,699
He got my lettuce and tomato on wheat,
which, of course, he was allergic to.

131
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,036
And I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.

132
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,507
- How amazing.
- It is, isn't it?

133
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,737
You make a million decisions
that mean nothing.

134
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,508
Then one day you order takeout,
and it changes your life.

135
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:01,708
Destiny takes a hand.

136
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:04,412
Mom, destiny is
something we've invented...

137
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,286
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

138
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:13,658
How do you explain that you both ordered
the same sandwich except for the bread?

139
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:17,130
How many people in this world
like lettuce and tomato...

140
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,134
without something else like tuna?

141
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:24,935
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

142
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,102
I was in Atlantic City with my family.
Cliff was a waiter.

143
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,911
He wasn't even supposed to work
that night, and suppose he hadn't?

144
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,747
He asked me to take a midnight walk
on the Steel Pier.

145
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:42,314
I've probably told you this
a million times, but I don't care.

146
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,825
Then he held my hand.

147
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,191
At one point I looked down
and I couldn't tell...

148
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:50,527
which fingers were his
and which were mine.

149
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,431
And I knew.

150
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,972
- What?
- You know.

151
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,406
- What?
- Magic.

152
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,138
It was magic.

153
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,736
Magic?

154
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:09,011
I knew we'd be together forever and
that everything would be wonderful...

155
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,848
just the way you feel about Walter.

156
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:16,982
Walter? It's quite
a formal name, isn't it?

157
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,551
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I...

158
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:23,359
were going to have
a wonderful time in-

159
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,765
- The sack, I believe you call it.
- Mom!

160
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,133
Of course, it took
several years before everything...

161
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:31,138
worked like clockwork
in that department.

162
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,231
So don't be worried
if it takes a while.

163
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:36,778
- Well, we already-
- Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee.

164
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,905
- How's it working?
- Like clockwork.

165
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,208
Oh, honey.

166
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:49,986
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

167
00:11:55,665 --> 00:12:00,261
They loved you! I told you they
would love you, and they loved you!

168
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:03,065
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

169
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,610
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

170
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:11,009
Nope.

171
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,081
Not even when you were young?

172
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:15,412
Nope, not even when I was young.

173
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,245
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?

174
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:22,188
How will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

175
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:26,694
I forgot the present. I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

176
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:29,993
When we're old and gray, you're gonna
have to remind me to put my teeth in.

177
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:34,729
I'll be walking all over town, smacking
my gums together and not even noticing.

178
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,897
- I'll wait.
- You'll wait? Oh! Right.

179
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,067
Don't wait. It's silly.
Go ahead. We're late anyway.

180
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,338
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

181
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,706
<i>Sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too</i>

182
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,716
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

183
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,752
<i>It's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you</i>

184
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,753
<i>Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap</i>

185
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,881
<i>The snow is falling
and friends are calling, Yoo-hoo</i>

186
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:59,155
<i>Friends are calling, Yoo-hoo
Ding-a-ling-a-ling</i>

187
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,890
<i>Horses, horses, horses
Horses, horses, horses</i>

188
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,556
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

189
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,295
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

190
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:11,464
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

191
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,542
<i>Jingle bells</i>

192
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,975
<i>- Horses, horses, horses
- Welcome to "You and Your Emotions. "</i>

193
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,012
<i>- Laughing all the way
- I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone...</i>

194
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:22,847
<i>broadcasting live across America from
the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago.</i>

195
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:26,718
<i>Tonight we're talking
about wishes and dreams.</i>

196
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,382
<i>- What's your wish this Christmas Eve?
- What's your wish?</i>

197
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:33,155
<i>- Maybe the best gift you can give your-
- My wish is to turn the radio station.</i>

198
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:37,096
<i>Subject of this evening's medical update
is "You and Your Spleen. "</i>

199
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,826
<i>- Your host is-
- Not on your life.</i>

200
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:43,531
<i>Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards,
sung by the New Jersey-</i>

201
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,871
<i>- Seattle, go ahead.
- Hello, this is Jonah-</i>

202
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,535
<i>No last names, Jonah.</i>

203
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:52,944
<i>You sound younger than
our usual callers. How old are you?</i>

204
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,882
<i>- I'm eight.
- Eight. How come you're up so late?</i>

205
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,716
<i>- It's not that late in Seattle.
- Of course. You're absolutely right.</i>

206
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,017
<i>What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?</i>

207
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:06,060
<i>It's not for me. It's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.</i>

208
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:08,892
<i>- You don't like the one he has now?
- He doesn't have one now.</i>

209
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,556
<i>That's the problem.</i>

210
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,100
<i>- Where's your mom?
- She died.</i>

211
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:17,969
<i>- I'm so sorry to hear that.
- Well, who can believe this?</i>

212
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:21,066
<i>I've been pretty sad,
but I think my dad's worse.</i>

213
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,702
<i>Have you talked
to your dad about this?</i>

214
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,974
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

215
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:29,609
<i>- It's like it makes him sadder.
- I can understand that.</i>

216
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,279
<i>- Jonah, is your dad home right now?
- Yeah.</i>

217
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:36,017
<i>- What's he doing? Is he busy?
- Not really. He's out on the deck.</i>

218
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,323
<i>I'm sure that I can help, but I'm
going to need you to help me help him.</i>

219
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,522
<i>- Wretched woman!
- Bring your dad to the phone.</i>

220
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,159
<i>- Hang up, Jonah! Don't listen to her.
- No way. He'd kill me.</i>

221
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,793
<i>Trust me, Jonah.
He won't be angry...</i>

222
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:51,395
<i>when he realizes
how concerned you are about him.</i>

223
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:52,906
Wanna bet?

224
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:55,842
<i>If I get yelled at, I'm never
going to listen to your show again.</i>

225
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:58,209
<i>Fair enough.</i>

226
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,845
- Dad?
- Yeah?

227
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:05,114
There's someone
on the phone for you.

228
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:10,217
<i>- His name's Sam.
- Sam.</i>

229
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,227
<i>If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.</i>

230
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,354
<i>Tonight's topic is
"Your Wishes and Dreams. "</i>

231
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:19,195
<i>- I got it.
- We're on the line with Seattle.</i>

232
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,791
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Sam.</i>

233
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:23,599
<i>This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
on Network America.</i>

234
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:29,041
What are you selling tonight?
Micro hibachis or Ginza knives?

235
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:32,376
<i>I'm not selling anything.
I just want to help.</i>

236
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,381
<i>I want you to know
that your son called...</i>

237
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:38,385
<i>and he asked me for advice
on how you might find a new wife.</i>

238
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:43,823
<i>- Who is this?
- Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.</i>

239
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,827
<i>- You are on the air.
- You called a radio station?</i>

240
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:51,662
<i>- Sam? Sam? Sam, are you with me?
- Yeah. Yes.</i>

241
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:55,965
<i>Your son feels that since your wife's
death you've been very, very unhappy.</i>

242
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:59,599
<i>He's genuinely worried about you.</i>

243
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,109
Oh, hey, get out here.
Get out here.

244
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,509
I'm not gonna
go through this alone.

245
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:08,640
<i>I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this.</i>

246
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,448
<i>I thought maybe you and I could talk.
It would make Jonah feel better.</i>

247
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,013
<i>- Sam?
- Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.</i>

248
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,026
Of what?
Her first name could be Doctor.

249
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:21,619
<i>- Please?
- Sam?</i>

250
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,223
<i>Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>

251
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:29,099
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, good.</i>

252
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,696
<i>I know this is difficult.</i>

253
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,799
<i>But how long ago
did your wife die?</i>

254
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,372
About a year and a half ago.

255
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,506
<i>Have you had
any relationships since?</i>

256
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:44,675
<i>- Nope.
- No?</i>

257
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:46,550
<i>Why not?</i>

258
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:51,349
Marcia- Or should
I call you Dr. Fieldstone?

259
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,928
<i>- Dr. Marcia.
- Dr. Marcia.</i>

260
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,363
<i>- I don't mean to be rude.
- I don't want to invade your privacy.</i>

261
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,765
<i>- Oh, sure you do.
- Sure you do.</i>

262
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,135
<i>Go on, Sam.
I'm listening.</i>

263
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,071
<i>Sam?</i>

264
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:11,637
We had a pretty
tough time there at first.

265
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,341
But we're dealing with it.

266
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,410
And Jonah and I will
get along just fine again...

267
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:22,548
as soon as I break his radio.

268
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,051
<i>I have no doubt that
you're a wonderful father.</i>

269
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:30,894
<i>- You can tell a lot from a voice.
- You certainly can.</i>

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,630
<i>But something must be missing if
Jonah still feels you're under a cloud.</i>

271
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:39,037
<i>Just a few questions.
Are you sleeping at night?</i>

272
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,201
- He doesn't sleep at all.
- How do you know that?

273
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,040
I live here.

274
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:51,119
Look, it's Christmas.

275
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:58,517
Maggie, my wife-

276
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:01,095
She really did it.

277
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:03,097
I mean, she loved-

278
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,624
She made everything beautiful.

279
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:12,600
<i>And it's just tough
this time of year.</i>

280
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,369
Any kid needs a mother.

281
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:19,243
<i>Could it be that you need someone
just as much as Jonah does?</i>

282
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:23,516
Yes.

283
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,952
<i>Don't answer that. Let's get into that
right after these messages.</i>

284
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:29,286
<i>Sam, Jonah, don't go away.</i>

285
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:33,657
<i>If you've just tuned in,
we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

286
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:37,823
<i>We'll be right back after this break
with your listener response.</i>

287
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,730
What's she talking about?

288
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:42,895
This is when other people get to call in
and dump on what you said.

289
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh, oh. This is really fun,
and helpful.

290
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,711
I'll bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

291
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,151
Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks
and he stinks.

292
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,587
Harriet, shut up.
Hi. Can I help you?

293
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,419
Tea with the bag out.

294
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:07,461
Maybe I'll hustle myself out to Seattle.
Give him a gift for New Year's Eve.

295
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,862
You go on out there if you want to,
but don't open his refrigerator.

296
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,833
They don't cover anything
when they put it in the fridge.

297
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,427
They just stick it in there and
leave it till it walks out by itself.

298
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:20,030
What I'm saying is, I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

299
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,042
You know what I'm saying?
Sixty-five cents.

300
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:25,773
<i>Let's take a call
before we get back to Sleepless.</i>

301
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,975
<i>Knoxville, Tennessee,
you're on the air. Talk to me.</i>

302
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:33,783
<i>Yes, I would just like to know
where I could get this man's address.</i>

303
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,050
<i>- Honey, get in line.
- We don't give that information.</i>

304
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,785
<i>Next caller, go ahead.</i>

305
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,388
<i>If there was one question
I was allowed to ask-</i>

306
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,693
Oh, go ahead.

307
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,861
<i>People who truly loved once
are far more likely to love again.</i>

308
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:53,340
<i>Do you think there's someone out there
you could love as much as your wife?</i>

309
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:00,275
<i>Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.</i>

310
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:03,715
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

311
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:08,813
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...

312
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,154
breathe in and out all day long.

313
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,095
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself...</i>

314
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:20,328
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

315
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:26,266
And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...

316
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,503
I had it great and perfect
for a while.

317
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:34,344
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

318
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,010
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

319
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,583
<i>Oh, well, it was a-</i>

320
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,591
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

321
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:49,721
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

322
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,928
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

323
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:56,971
It was like coming home...

324
00:20:57,072 --> 00:21:00,200
only to no home I'd ever known.

325
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:03,301
I was just taking her hand...

326
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:06,711
to help her out of a car...

327
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,305
and I knew it.

328
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:11,984
<i>It was like-</i>

329
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,647
<i>- Magic.
- Magic.</i>

330
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:18,352
<i>Well, folks,
it's time to wrap it up.</i>

331
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,054
<i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
in Chicago.</i>

332
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:25,623
<i>And to all my listeners,
a magical and merry Christmas.</i>

333
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:30,637
<i>And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,
we hope you'll call again soon.</i>

334
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,936
<i>- Let us know how it's going.
- Oh, you can count on it.</i>

335
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:39,606
<i>When you find me</i>

336
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,277
<i>I know somewhere</i>

337
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:49,824
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

338
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,463
<i>The bluebirds glide</i>

339
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:04,370
<i>Birds fly</i>

340
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:08,773
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

341
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:14,110
<i>Why, then, oh, why</i>

342
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:18,516
<i>Can't I</i>

343
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:26,795
This man sells the greatest soup
you've ever eaten...

344
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:29,022
and he is the meanest man
in America.

345
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:32,726
I feel very strongly about this, Becky.
It's not just about the soup.

346
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,928
- Do it. What else?
- New Year's Eve.

347
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:37,471
<i>- Please don't make me write it.
- Listen to this.</i>

348
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,667
"Phone service in the greater Chicago
area was tied up for two hours...

349
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,244
Christmas Eve when some kid
calls a phone-in radio show...

350
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,245
and says that his dad
needs a new wife.

351
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:49,750
Two thousand women called the station
asking for the guy's number. "

352
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:53,083
I heard it. This kid calls up
and says, "My dad needs a wife. "

353
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:56,749
This shrink forces the guy to the phone
and says, "You want to talk about it?"

354
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,350
He says, "No,
as a matter of fact, I don't. "

355
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,487
Suddenly, for no reason at all, he talks
about how much he loved his wife...

356
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:04,566
and how he just
fell in love with her...

357
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,600
like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.

358
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:09,762
<i>- What cows in Michigan?
- It was on 60 Minutes.</i>

359
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,999
There were those cows
that got zapped by stray voltage.

360
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,735
No one knows why.
Maybe it was Wisconsin.

361
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:19,109
But anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife...

362
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:21,614
and suddenly I was crying.

363
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,947
It's like what happens when
I watch those phone company ads.

364
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,043
I don't have to see the whole thing,
just the part where...

365
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,090
the daughter gives the mother the
refrigerator with the big red bow on it.

366
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:33,287
<i>The Polaroid commercial. Two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.</i>

367
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,295
- They're making the album.
- With the glue.

368
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:38,059
That kills me.

369
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,567
You should write
something about this.

370
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,160
- About what?
- Whatever it is.

371
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:47,003
I'll tell you. Two thousand women
calling a radio station for a husband.

372
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,009
There are a lot of desperate women
out there lookin' for love.

373
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:51,011
Especially over a certain age.

374
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:54,310
It's easier to be killed by a terrorist
than get married over the age of 40.

375
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,316
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

376
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:58,545
That's right. It's not true.
But it feels true.

377
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,554
It feels true
because it is true.

378
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,284
There's practically a whole book
about how that's not true.

379
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:06,384
- Calm down. You brought it up.
- I did not, Wyatt.

380
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:09,658
- Did you even read that book?
- Did anyone read it all the way through?

381
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:12,825
Are you two finished?
Fine. Now where were we?

382
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:17,065
If someone is a widower,
why do they say that he was widowed?

383
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,902
Why don't they say
he was widowered?

384
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:24,512
I was just wondering.

385
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,581
What was that about up there?

386
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:29,549
- What was what?
- What's with you?

387
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:33,417
<i>- Nothing's with me.
- Something's with you.</i>

388
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:36,980
- What are you saying?
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.

389
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,559
Sleepless in Seattle?

390
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,288
That's what she called him on the show
because he can't sleep.

391
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,456
And now 2,000 women
want his number.

392
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,966
The guy could be a crackhead,
a transvestite...

393
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,300
a flasher, a junkie,
a chain-saw murderer...

394
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,499
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

395
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:58,278
- Actually, he sounded nice.
- Oh?

396
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:03,713
Oh, really?
Now we're getting down to it.

397
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,720
Please. Becky,
I'm madly in love with Walter.

398
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:09,985
He did the craziest thing
the other night. What was that?

399
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:15,993
Oh, it was so funny.
We were hysterical. What was that?

400
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:32,846
You know, I've got to go to Boston
for the convention, right?

401
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,145
Then I got to visit Winston-Hughes
about switching over our computers.

402
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:41,689
<i>But why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?</i>

403
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,884
Walter, I'd love to!

404
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:47,655
We can stay at the Plaza.

405
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:50,129
Ice-stake in Central Park.

406
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:52,462
Register.

407
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,262
Register?

408
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,965
You know, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

409
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:02,942
How about it?

410
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:09,081
I'll take you to Chinatown
for dim sum.

411
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,119
- Does it have wheat in it?
- I don't think so.

412
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,616
<i>Dim sum, dim sum</i>

413
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:25,456
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

414
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:29,867
five, four, three, two, one!

415
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:34,567
Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man.
The ball's droppin'.

416
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,200
<i>Happy new year!</i>

417
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:46,046
<i>Okay, pal. I got ya.</i>

418
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,382
It's okay.

419
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,480
There we go.

420
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:25,217
Happy new year.

421
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,295
Happy new year.

422
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,797
Kiss Howard.

423
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,960
Good night, Howard.

424
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:54,484
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>

425
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,717
<i>Why I spend</i>

426
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:02,126
<i>The lonely night</i>

427
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,688
<i>Dreaming of a song</i>

428
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:08,361
<i>The melody</i>

429
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,031
<i>Haunts my reverie</i>

430
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,339
<i>And I am once again with you</i>

431
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,973
<i>When our love was new</i>

432
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:26,754
<i>And each kiss an inspiration</i>

433
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,921
<i>But that was long ago</i>

434
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,931
<i>Now my consolation</i>

435
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:42,902
<i>Is in the stardust of a song</i>

436
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:48,567
<i>Beside the garden wall</i>

437
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:52,977
<i>When stars are bright</i>

438
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:56,573
<i>You are in my arms</i>

439
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:59,552
<i>The nightingale</i>

440
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,987
<i>Tells his fairy tale</i>

441
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:07,050
<i>Of paradise where roses bloom</i>

442
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,221
Can I have half your beer?

443
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,493
Sure. Go ahead.

444
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:17,761
What did I used to say?

445
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:20,000
"Here's looking at you"?

446
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:22,008
"Here's mud in your eye"?

447
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,408
"Here's to us. "

448
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:28,811
You used to say, "Here's to us. "

449
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:36,653
Oh, babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

450
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:56,166
- What do you want to do?
- We'll tell him when he gets here.

451
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:58,508
You want to tell him.
I don't mind telling him.

452
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:01,309
- She's here.
- She's back. She has another idea.

453
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,350
I don't need-
Claire, how are you?

454
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:06,045
I'm so glad you're here.
I heard you on the radio.

455
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:09,646
- I told everyone about it.
- We already knew.

456
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:10,986
- How did you-
- Grace.

457
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:13,219
The dispatcher?
All of Seattle knows.

458
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,728
I was brushing my teeth
and suddenly there you were.

459
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,890
I couldn't believe my ears.
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

460
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,801
I said, "Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect. "

461
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,703
It is so nice...

462
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:30,175
when a man
can express his feelings.

463
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:33,145
<i>- It's wonderful.
- I wish I could express my feelings.</i>

464
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:38,447
- So, Claire, is there a problem?
- I was tossing and turning last night.

465
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:43,820
I realized I'm never going to fit my
platters in the refrigerator we ordered.

466
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,291
When I give parties,
I always put in platters.

467
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:49,727
So I thought I would get the Sub-Zero
refrigerator instead. The only problem-

468
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:51,731
We have to redo all the cabinets.

469
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:55,200
- We'll be into this wall.
- That's a bearing wall.

470
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:57,601
That's a delay, Claire, of-

471
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,606
- Two, three-
- Five, six-

472
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,642
- Twelve weeks.
- I don't mind.

473
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:04,211
The important thing
is to get it right.

474
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,246
- Absolutely.
- Your words.

475
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:09,044
<i>I've got to rush.
La d¨¦corateur calls.</i>

476
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,311
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

477
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,187
Well, this is fate.
She's divorced.

478
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,419
We don't want to redo the cabinets,
and you need a wife.

479
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:22,155
What do they call that
when everything intersects?

480
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,197
The Bermuda Triangle.

481
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:37,469
And here's another one.
You got room for one more here?

482
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,547
There you go.
You all right there?

483
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,584
<i>- Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.
- Yes, sir. There you go.</i>

484
00:31:47,022 --> 00:31:49,650
"Sleepless in Seattle.
In care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"?

485
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:54,457
If you have trouble sleeping, drink
a glass of water from the other side.

486
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:57,030
- I thought that was for hiccups.
- Does it work for hiccups?

487
00:31:57,132 --> 00:32:00,795
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar
and hold it in your mouth for a minute.

488
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:04,736
- Really?
- Thank you.

489
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,103
What possessed you
to give them our address?

490
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,268
They called and asked for it.

491
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,505
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle...

492
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:16,380
You're the most attractive man
I ever laid ears on. "

493
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:20,113
Wait, wait, wait. They called?
How did they get our number?

494
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:22,280
Let me guess.
You gave it to them.

495
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,416
You have to give them your phone number,
or they won't let you on the air.

496
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,394
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle,
I live in Tulsa. "

497
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:31,932
<i>- Where's that?
- It's in Oklahoma.</i>

498
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,729
- Do you know where Oklahoma is?
- Somewhere in the middle.

499
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:38,033
I'm not even gonna think about
what they're not teaching you in school.

500
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:40,573
Yeah, it's somewhere
in the middle.

501
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:45,772
Generally speaking, we should rule out
anyone that doesn't live near here.

502
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,643
She's willing to fly anywhere.

503
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,952
<i>She looks like my third grade teacher.
I hated my third grade teacher.</i>

504
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:57,081
Wait a minute.
She is my third grade teacher!

505
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:01,925
- Aren't you gonna read any of these?
- This is not how it's done.

506
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,329
I'd much rather
just see somebody I like...

507
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:08,732
and get a feeling about them...

508
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:10,964
and ask them
if they want to have a drink.

509
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,972
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Not dinner.

510
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,167
Not necessarily on the first date.

511
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,676
Halfway through dinner you could be
really sorry you asked them to dinner.

512
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,747
Whereas, if it's just a drink...

513
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:22,339
if you like them,
you could always ask them to dinner.

514
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,975
But if not, you can just say,
"Well, that was great. "

515
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:29,546
And then you go home.
See what I mean?

516
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:31,818
I wonder if
it still works this way.

517
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:36,192
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

518
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:40,859
<i>If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have sex with her, huh?</i>

519
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,437
I certainly hope so.

520
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:47,941
- Will she scratch up your back?
- What?

521
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:52,775
In movies, women are always scratching
up the man's back and screaming.

522
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,748
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

523
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,011
Oh, Jed's got cable.

524
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:02,584
Hand me that towel
behind you, please.

525
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,230
- Thank you.
- I need it too.

526
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,027
Here. Let me get you.
Jed's got cable.

527
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,694
<i>Another bride</i>

528
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,398
<i>Another groom</i>

529
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:23,876
<i>Another sunny honeymoon</i>

530
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,708
<i>Another season</i>

531
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:31,411
<i>And that's the reason
for makin' whoopee</i>

532
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:51,437
<i>When the sun is high
in the afternoon sky</i>

533
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:55,873
<i>You can always
find something to do</i>

534
00:34:55,977 --> 00:35:01,847
<i>But from dusk till dawn
as the clock ticks on</i>

535
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:08,685
<i>Something happens to you</i>

536
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,284
<i>In the wee small hours</i>

537
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:16,989
<i>Of the morning</i>

538
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:20,727
<i>While the whole wide world</i>

539
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:24,896
<i>Is fast asleep</i>

540
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:28,806
<i>You lie awake</i>

541
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,903
<i>And think about the boy</i>

542
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,812
<i>And never ever think</i>

543
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:41,082
<i>Of counting sheep</i>

544
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,680
<i>Welcome back to
the "Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"...</i>

545
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,521
<i>clinical psychologist
and the friend you never had.</i>

546
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:50,621
<i>- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He says he doesn't love me anymore.</i>

547
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,633
<i>Why would you want to be
with someone who doesn't love you?</i>

548
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,703
<i>Disappointed in Denver.</i>

549
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:59,864
<i>Every time I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make himself a sandwich.</i>

550
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,067
<i>Why don't you make him
a sandwich beforehand?</i>

551
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,076
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

552
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:09,514
<i>Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...</i>

553
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:13,383
<i>and breathe in and out all day long.</i>

554
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:17,822
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself...</i>

555
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:22,659
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

556
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:29,635
<i>And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...</i>

557
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:33,673
<i>I had it great and perfect
for a while.</i>

558
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:38,439
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

559
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:41,481
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

560
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:46,814
<i>Oh, well, it was a-</i>

561
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,855
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

562
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:53,894
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

563
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:58,625
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

564
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,065
<i>It was like coming home...</i>

565
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:04,332
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>

566
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,431
<i>I was just taking her hand...</i>

567
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:10,204
<i>to help her out of a car...</i>

568
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,507
<i>and I knew it.</i>

569
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:16,276
<i>It was like...</i>

570
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:18,284
<i>magic.</i>

571
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:43,675
<i>I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?</i>

572
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:46,713
- What?
- I mean, why did you get married?

573
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:49,146
Was it all trumpets
and fireworks?

574
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,378
I got married because Betsy said
we had to break up or get married...

575
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,148
so we got married.

576
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:56,648
But when you first met her...

577
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:59,249
did you believe
she was the only person for you?

578
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,488
That in some mystical,
cosmic way it was fated?

579
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:06,431
Annie, when you're
attracted to someone...

580
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,401
it just means that your subconscious
is attracted to their subconscious...

581
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,335
subconsciously.

582
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:15,136
<i>What we think of as fate is two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.</i>

583
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,478
I don't even know him.

584
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:23,380
I am having all of these fantasies
about some man I have never even met...

585
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:25,475
who lives in Seattle!

586
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:27,645
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

587
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:32,692
I know! I know!
I do not want to move to Seattle.

588
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,055
But what I really don't want
to do is end up always wondering...

589
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:42,432
what might have happened
and knowing I could have done something.

590
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,732
What do you think?

591
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,739
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

592
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,867
Everybody panics before
they get married. Didn't you?

593
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:52,609
- I did.
- You did.

594
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:56,046
Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so
much better just having blown this off.

595
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,447
Anytime.

596
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:01,386
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda.
She's a weight lifter.

597
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:03,480
It's not like her neck
is bigger than her head.

598
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,584
I'm not asking you to set me up.
I don't need your help with that.

599
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:10,755
I just want to know
what it's like out there.

600
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:13,356
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
what women are lookin' for.

601
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:15,936
Pecs and a cute butt.

602
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,631
<i>- Like, "He has the cutest butt"?
- Yeah.</i>

603
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:21,572
- Where did I hear that recently?
- Everywhere.

604
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:24,304
You can't even turn on the news
nowadays without hearing about...

605
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:27,279
how some babe thought
some guy's butt was cute.

606
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:30,817
Who the first woman to say this was,
I don't know. But it caught on.

607
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:33,045
So how's my butt?

608
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:37,620
- Not bad.
- Really?

609
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,693
- Is it cute though?
- I don't know.

610
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,762
Are we grading on a curve?

611
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:44,354
When's the last time
you were out there?

612
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,537
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

613
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,905
Things are
a little different now.

614
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,376
First you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

615
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,313
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

616
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,976
Then you have tests.
Then you get to do it with a condom.

617
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:07,213
The good news is,
you split the check.

618
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:10,782
I don't think I could
let a woman pay for dinner.

619
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:13,258
Great. They'll throw
a parade in your honor.

620
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:17,821
<i>You'll be man of the year
in Seattle magazine.</i>

621
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:19,763
Tiramisu.

622
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:22,734
- What is tiramisu?
- You'll find out.

623
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,464
- What is it?
- You'll see.

624
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:27,439
Some woman will want me to do it to her.
I'm not going to know what it is.

625
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,941
<i>You'll love it.</i>

626
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,538
This is going to be tough.
Tough, tough.

627
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,706
This is going to be much tougher
than I thought it was going to be.

628
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:38,148
How about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

629
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:41,653
- Victoria?
- Yeah, she's perk.

630
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:43,849
- No, I don't-
- Come on!

631
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,585
I'm far away from that.

632
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,991
- I'm just assembling notes.
- Notes.

633
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:50,723
- How would I do that?
- What do you mean? Call her up.

634
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:52,856
You say, "Let's get together.
We'll look at swatches. "

635
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:55,765
Call her on the phone?
Say, "Let's look at swatches"?

636
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,634
- Color schemes.
- She's not gonna see through that?

637
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:01,640
You don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

638
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:04,370
Think Cary Grant.

639
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:08,608
Cary Grant would say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

640
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,015
Maybe he did. I know
he didn't do it in the movies.

641
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,643
<i>Gunga Din?</i>

642
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:16,018
<i>Gunga Din is not
a swatch kind of movie.</i>

643
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,557
Who knows what
he did in real life?

644
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:21,526
But he did that
with Dyan Cannon?

645
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:24,120
"Hello, Dyan.
Take a look at these swatches. "

646
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:45,249
Jonah, I'm home.

647
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,655
Hey, Jonah!

648
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:10,166
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

649
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:15,338
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Jessica.

650
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,476
<i>Dad, this is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says, "Paul is dead. "</i>

651
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,885
Yeah, I know.

652
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,719
How do you know?

653
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:29,585
Dad, could you shut the door?

654
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:31,858
Sure. Sure.

655
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,593
H and G.

656
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:37,727
Hi and good-bye.

657
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:27,183
<i>I'm back in the saddle again</i>

658
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:31,019
<i>Out where a friend is a friend</i>

659
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:35,721
<i>Where the longhorn cattle feed
on the lowly jimsonweed</i>

660
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,823
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

661
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:44,132
<i>Ridin' the range once more</i>

662
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:48,106
<i>Totin' my old. 44</i>

663
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,370
<i>Where you sleep out every night</i>

664
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:53,743
Hello, Victoria?

665
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:57,875
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me, but-

666
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:01,813
Oh, great. Hi.

667
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:05,949
I was wondering if-

668
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,156
if you would like
to have a drink with me?

669
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:11,663
Dinner?

670
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,666
Dinner would be even better.

671
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:20,263
Friday would be great.
Yeah. How-

672
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:22,808
I hear that's a good place.

673
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:30,045
How- 7:30 would be fine.
And I'Il-

674
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:35,217
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay.

675
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:38,917
So it's Friday...

676
00:44:39,026 --> 00:44:41,290
at 7:30 for dinner.

677
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:42,794
Great.

678
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:45,956
Me too. Bye.

679
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:51,003
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

680
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:55,303
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

681
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,709
<i>I'm not now.</i>

682
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:04,642
Now those were the days
when people knew how to be in love.

683
00:45:04,752 --> 00:45:06,845
- You're a basket case.
- They knew it.

684
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:12,153
Time, distance, nothing could separate
them, because they knew it was right.

685
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:15,285
- It was real. It was-
- A movie.

686
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:17,296
That's your problem.
You don't want to be in love.

687
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,525
You want to be
in love in a movie.

688
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,191
Read it to me.

689
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:27,030
"Dear Sleepless and Son, I have never
written a letter like this in my life. "

690
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,599
That's what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to strangers.

691
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:33,976
I know that.
You think I don't know that?

692
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:36,811
What about Walter?

693
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:40,876
Walter. Oh, I would
give anything to marry Walter.

694
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,081
He's so unexpected.

695
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,184
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

696
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:50,729
I should write something
in this about magic.

697
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,423
- What?
- Something.

698
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:56,230
What if I never meet him? What if this
man is my destiny and I never meet him?

699
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:59,238
Your destiny can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.

700
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,274
"I want to meet you-"

701
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:04,708
<i>- The top of the Empire State Building?
- The top of the Empire State Building.</i>

702
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:06,575
<i>That's perfect.</i>

703
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,080
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

704
00:46:10,384 --> 00:46:14,480
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

705
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:17,352
I'll be in New York with Walter.

706
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,428
Do you want to
hear about destiny?

707
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:30,402
<i>If I hadn't married Martin, I wouldn't
have had the house with the dead tree.</i>

708
00:46:30,504 --> 00:46:32,904
On account of which,
I got divorced.

709
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:36,773
On account of which, I hit a car
and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

710
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:41,075
Wait. You never told me you got
a divorce because of a dead tree.

711
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,448
The tree man.

712
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,542
You fell in love
with the tree man?

713
00:46:45,653 --> 00:46:48,451
I did not say "love. "
Did I say "love"?

714
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,922
This is my favorite part.

715
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:54,893
<i>It's now or never.</i>

716
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:58,093
<i>"Never" is a frightening word.</i>

717
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:02,197
<i>We'd be fools
to let happiness pass us by.</i>

718
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:09,002
<i>Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.</i>

719
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:14,180
<i>We've already missed the spring.</i>

720
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,011
Men never get this movie.

721
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,677
I know.

722
00:47:22,823 --> 00:47:25,121
Mommy! Mommy!

723
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,587
It's okay. I'm here.

724
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:33,064
- Dad!
- I'm comin'.

725
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,226
It's all right. It's okay.

726
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:40,640
It's all right. It's okay.
What was that about?

727
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,936
- It was sinking.
- What was?

728
00:47:43,043 --> 00:47:46,342
Our house. There was water
coming in all the windows.

729
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:50,245
Well, it's okay now.

730
00:47:51,352 --> 00:47:55,015
It's all right.
So what should we do?

731
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,522
Your mother used to...

732
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,025
sing to you
when you had bad dreams.

733
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:02,856
"Bye-Bye, Blackbird. "

734
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:08,561
I miss her.

735
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:11,502
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?

736
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,467
- I don't know.
- Like, do you believe in heaven?

737
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,874
I never did.

738
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:26,350
Or the whole idea of an afterlife,
but now I don't know.

739
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,153
'Cause I have
these dreams about-

740
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:33,857
about your mom.

741
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:39,291
And we have long talks...

742
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,927
about you,
how you're doin'.

743
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:46,734
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

744
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,070
So what is that?

745
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,406
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?

746
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:56,177
I'm starting to forget her.

747
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:15,966
She could peel an apple...

748
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:19,805
in one long...

749
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:21,807
curly strip.

750
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,737
The whole apple.

751
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:28,644
<i>Pack up all my cares and woes</i>

752
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:32,545
<i>Feelin' low</i>

753
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:34,416
<i>Here I go</i>

754
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:38,480
<i>I say bye-bye</i>

755
00:49:38,592 --> 00:49:40,059
I love you, Jonah.

756
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:43,461
I love you, Dad.

757
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,470
See you tomorrow.

758
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:57,737
<i>Sugar's sweet
So is she</i>

759
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:00,279
<i>I say bye</i>

760
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,678
<i>Bye</i>

761
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:04,683
<i>Blackbird</i>

762
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:15,190
<i>No one seems to love</i>

763
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:19,231
<i>Or understand me now</i>

764
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,905
<i>Oh, and hard luck stories</i>

765
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:30,533
<i>They keep handin' me, yeah</i>

766
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:38,110
<i>Where somebody shines a light</i>

767
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:44,280
<i>I'm comin' on home tonight now</i>

768
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:47,952
<i>Oh, Lord
Yeah, darlin'</i>

769
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:52,464
<i>I wanna say
Bye-bye, blackbird</i>

770
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:54,466
<i>Lord have mercy</i>

771
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,604
<i>Somebody love me now</i>

772
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:08,642
Laurie?
Hi, it's Annie.

773
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:10,774
Fine. I'm fine.

774
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:14,513
Listen. I'm doing an article
on call-in radio shows.

775
00:51:14,621 --> 00:51:18,284
Do you know anyone who works for
someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

776
00:51:18,392 --> 00:51:21,555
<i>I'm a writer for the Baltimore Sun
and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.</i>

777
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,324
I'm doing a piece on how
people handle bereavement...

778
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:28,458
and I understand you had a caller
the other night, some guy from Seattle.

779
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:39,940
<i>This is Jonah Baldwin. We're not in
right now, but you can leave-</i>

780
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,810
Architect.

781
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,678
Okay, Clarise, I'm gonna be back
either by midnight...

782
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,309
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

783
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,411
Here's one for both of us.

784
00:53:28,522 --> 00:53:31,184
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore. "
- I left the restaurant's phone number.

785
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,692
If there's a problem, the pediatrician's
number is right above the phone.

786
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:39,357
Here's a bottle of ipecac if anybody
drinks poison. By the juice glasses.

787
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,457
- Fine.
- How do I look?

788
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:43,832
- Great.
- Do I look okay?

789
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:48,033
Do I look all right? I look stupid.
I look like I'm tryin' too hard.

790
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,701
I was gonna get a haircut,
but then I'd look like I got one.

791
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,974
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- The heels on these shoes are grotesque.

792
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:55,605
Looks like
I'm tryin' to be tall.

793
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:58,776
Her name is Annie.
Annie Reed.

794
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:00,318
- Bye.
- Read this!

795
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,978
Read this!

796
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:07,887
"Dear Sleepless and Son,
I've never written-" Blah, blah.

797
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,555
"I've been an excellent third baseman
for as long as I remember...

798
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,996
and while we're on the subject,
let's just say that...

799
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,534
Brooks Robinson
was the best third baseman ever.

800
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:18,035
It's important you agree with me,
because I'm from Baltimore. "

801
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:20,606
She thinks Brooks Robinson's
the greatest. So do you.

802
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:23,471
- Everyone thinks he's the greatest.
- It's a sign.

803
00:54:23,577 --> 00:54:25,010
Come here.

804
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,314
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.

805
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:30,940
All right.

806
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:33,076
Where is Seattle?
Right.

807
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,416
Where is Baltimore?

808
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,547
It's right there! Look!

809
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:41,218
One, two, three, four- There's like
26 states between here and there.

810
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:42,761
Now that's a sign.

811
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,457
I'm outta here.
Good-bye. Good night.

812
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:47,123
I love you.

813
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:53,167
Clarise, did you move your car?

814
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,613
- Thank you, Derrick.
- You're welcome.

815
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,186
- I'll have-
- White wine?

816
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:10,488
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine, thank you.

817
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:15,457
- You look good.
- You look good yourself.

818
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:23,025
- I thought you were never gonna call me.
- You did?

819
00:55:23,136 --> 00:55:26,264
But I really wanted you to,
and I thought you were never going to.

820
00:55:26,373 --> 00:55:28,273
<i>- Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?
- Yes?</i>

821
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,275
There's a phone call for you.

822
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,983
Thank you.
Hello?

823
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:42,283
<i>Dad, can we go to New York City
for Valentine's Day?</i>

824
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:44,618
What?

825
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:46,851
<i>Annie Reed from Baltimore
wants to meet us...</i>

826
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,260
<i>at the top of the Empire State Building
on Valentine's Day.</i>

827
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:53,264
<i>- Jonah.
- What?</i>

828
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:55,926
Have you fallen down?
Are you bleeding?

829
00:55:56,036 --> 00:55:58,971
Is Clarise there?
Has she been strangled?

830
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:01,040
So this is the only reason
for this phone call?

831
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:03,871
<i>If we book now,
we can get an excursion fare.</i>

832
00:56:03,977 --> 00:56:06,537
<i>Jessica's parents are travel agents,
and Jessica says-</i>

833
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:08,614
I'm not going to have
this conversation now.

834
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:10,945
We will talk about it
at a later time.

835
00:56:11,051 --> 00:56:14,316
I can't believe this conversation
has lasted this long. You go to bed.

836
00:56:21,928 --> 00:56:23,327
Everything all right?

837
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,455
Oh, yeah.
Do you have kids?

838
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:27,032
- No.
- Want mine?

839
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:32,934
I will have an Absolut
straight up, please.

840
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:34,597
Sure.

841
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:55,226
Put that down! Stop it!

842
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,990
There she is.

843
00:56:58,098 --> 00:57:01,864
- Why is she bringing those groceries?
- She's cooking for us, so be prepared.

844
00:57:01,968 --> 00:57:04,835
Hi, Sam. Thanks.
Thanks.

845
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:07,634
And let me guess.
You must be Jonah.

846
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:13,044
- This it?
- Yeah.

847
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:15,376
- The car's down this way.
- Great.

848
00:57:16,983 --> 00:57:18,974
<i>She's on her sixth painter...</i>

849
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:20,985
and we're never
gonna finish this job.

850
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:23,078
Now she wants
the fireplace re-bricked.

851
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,454
I know her pretty well.
I could give her a call.

852
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:29,256
I've got it solved. I'm just gonna hit
her with one of those fireplace bricks.

853
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:35,659
Oh, that is so funny.
You are so funny.

854
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:38,636
Whenever she wants anything done,
she does this song and dance about...

855
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:40,968
"I don't know. I'm stupid.
You tell me.

856
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:44,043
<i>You know better than I,
but couldn't we flip the house...</i>

857
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:47,773
so everything on one side is now on the
other, and the back becomes the front?

858
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,906
Could the whole house
open up on a hinge?

859
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:53,452
That way I could just get in
with the garage door opener. "

860
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:57,114
<i>I just say, "Yeah, we can do that.
We're just gonna have to-"</i>

861
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:00,125
"Move the kitchen cabinets. "

862
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,927
Jonah, bring that stuff.

863
00:58:11,037 --> 00:58:12,436
Do you like baseball?

864
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:15,841
Yes, I do.

865
00:58:15,942 --> 00:58:19,378
<i>My firm has box seats to the Mariners.
Why don't we all go sometime?</i>

866
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:24,015
- What about camping?
- What about it?

867
00:58:24,117 --> 00:58:27,518
- Do you like camping?
- I went camping once.

868
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:31,316
<i>You know what?
We oughta start camping more often.</i>

869
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:34,757
You're right. Camping is good.
Time for bed.

870
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:37,159
- It's only 10:00.
- Yeah, 10:00.

871
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,323
Time for bed.

872
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,059
Good night.

873
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:48,265
Don't you wanna thank Victoria
for this delicious dinner?

874
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:52,209
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

875
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,944
I'm glad you liked it.

876
00:58:56,049 --> 00:58:57,949
Good night, Jonah.

877
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,516
Yeah, we don't see
a lot of potatoes around here.

878
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,523
We're rice men.

879
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,878
I'm sorry, Walter.
I'm sorry.

880
01:00:07,157 --> 01:00:09,421
<i>- Hello?
- Turn on your radio.</i>

881
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:11,426
<i>- What?
- The kid is on.</i>

882
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,088
<i>You've got me
listening to this garbage.</i>

883
01:00:14,197 --> 01:00:16,563
Who is it?

884
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:20,796
It's Becky. She's-
She's having trouble with Rick again.

885
01:00:20,904 --> 01:00:23,805
I'll go downstairs, Becky.
I'll call you back.

886
01:00:26,643 --> 01:00:29,271
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

887
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:53,395
<i>- He's kissing her right this minute!
- Oh, really?</i>

888
01:00:53,503 --> 01:00:57,200
<i>Jonah, tell the truth.
Are you spying on your father?</i>

889
01:00:57,307 --> 01:01:00,401
<i>- Who's he kissing right this minute?
- Listen to this.</i>

890
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,410
<i>I have to make them stop.</i>

891
01:01:02,512 --> 01:01:06,073
<i>- How am I gonna explain this to Walter?
- She came over and cooked dinner.</i>

892
01:01:06,183 --> 01:01:09,277
<i>She brought two bags of groceries,
like she was staying for a year.</i>

893
01:01:09,386 --> 01:01:12,287
<i>Jonah, it's good
that your father's dating.</i>

894
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:15,620
<i>It's just hard on you.
It's something you think you want.</i>

895
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:19,491
<i>- Then when it happens, it scares you.
- That's not true.</i>

896
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:22,531
<i>Think. Shouldn't your father
be the judge...</i>

897
01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:25,533
<i>of whether someone is right
or wrong for him?</i>

898
01:01:25,635 --> 01:01:27,603
<i>He's not sane enough
to judge anything.</i>

899
01:01:27,704 --> 01:01:30,434
Now he's kissing her on the lips.
She's a 'ho!

900
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,600
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!
What am I going to do?

901
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,644
<i>Calm down, Jonah.</i>

902
01:01:35,745 --> 01:01:38,441
<i>Tomorrow morning when you're
having breakfast with your dad...</i>

903
01:01:38,548 --> 01:01:40,846
<i>tell him how you feel.</i>

904
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:44,443
<i>It's not good to keep
your feelings inside you.</i>

905
01:01:48,758 --> 01:01:52,421
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

906
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:58,566
You scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

907
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:05,197
<i>- I thought I saw a black widow.
- You scared me to death!</i>

908
01:02:05,308 --> 01:02:08,573
- You scared Victoria to death.
- It was right over there.

909
01:02:08,678 --> 01:02:12,341
The next time you think you see a
black widow spider, I want you to say...

910
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:16,317
<i>"Dad, excuse me, but I believe
a poisonous insect is in the house"...</i>

911
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:18,580
and I will calmly come
and take care of it.

912
01:02:18,688 --> 01:02:20,212
<i>Scream again, I'll kill you.</i>

913
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:24,817
Becky heard this guy on the radio she
was sure was Rick. She was hysterical.

914
01:02:24,928 --> 01:02:29,092
And then it turned out
the guy lived in Duluth.

915
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,100
- Where is Duluth?
- That doesn't make any sense.

916
01:02:32,202 --> 01:02:35,660
I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

917
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:38,366
Thank God my life is in place.

918
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:41,342
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

919
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:59,317
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.

920
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:02,523
- You think so?
- It's Y.O.H.

921
01:03:02,632 --> 01:03:04,793
Yeah. What's that?

922
01:03:04,901 --> 01:03:06,493
Your only hope.

923
01:03:18,582 --> 01:03:21,779
I thought I would look into
doing a story on those radio shows.

924
01:03:23,253 --> 01:03:25,551
You'd probably have to go somewhere
to really look into it.

925
01:03:26,223 --> 01:03:28,350
Definitely.

926
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:49,170
Couldn't you do
a phone interview?

927
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:53,841
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.
I won't be in Chicago that long.

928
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,009
When you get back, I'll be gone.

929
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:58,553
And then I'll see you in New York.

930
01:03:58,655 --> 01:04:00,418
I'll get it.

931
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:05,826
<i>This is Captain Browning.</i>

932
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:09,490
<i>We're at our cruising altitude
of approximately 35,000 feet.</i>

933
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,366
<i>The weather is clear to the west, and we
expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.</i>

934
01:04:15,472 --> 01:04:18,339
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes, I do.

935
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:23,310
<i>And I just told the most terrible one
to the man I'm about to marry.</i>

936
01:04:23,413 --> 01:04:26,177
Do you feel that
any lie is a betrayal?

937
01:04:27,217 --> 01:04:29,185
I said "flying. "

938
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,060
Thanks for bringing me out here.

939
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:41,562
Well, he likes the planes.

940
01:04:41,665 --> 01:04:46,034
Can I bring something back for you?
A souvenir? Does he like snow globes?

941
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,570
You shake them up
and then the snow floats down.

942
01:04:48,672 --> 01:04:52,335
Sure. I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

943
01:04:56,546 --> 01:04:58,639
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

944
01:04:58,748 --> 01:05:00,648
I read an article about this.

945
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,844
All children are hideous at age eight.
It's quite normal.

946
01:05:03,953 --> 01:05:06,148
Well, maybe when I come back...

947
01:05:06,256 --> 01:05:09,589
the two of us oughta spend
some time together on our own.

948
01:05:09,693 --> 01:05:11,718
What do you think?

949
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,898
Bye.

950
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,627
Bye, Jonah.

951
01:05:26,076 --> 01:05:29,637
Listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.

952
01:05:29,746 --> 01:05:31,646
I hardly know her myself.

953
01:05:31,748 --> 01:05:34,649
She is, in fact,
a mystery to me.

954
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:38,050
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?

955
01:05:38,154 --> 01:05:40,987
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?

956
01:05:41,091 --> 01:05:44,583
Should she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?

957
01:05:46,096 --> 01:05:49,259
These are things I'm willing
to get to the bottom of.

958
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:52,699
And that is why I am dating her.

959
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:56,029
That's all I'm doing.

960
01:05:56,139 --> 01:05:58,403
<i>I'm not living with her.
I'm not marrying her.</i>

961
01:05:58,508 --> 01:06:01,272
Can you appreciate
the difference?

962
01:06:02,746 --> 01:06:04,213
This is what single people do.

963
01:06:04,314 --> 01:06:07,112
They try other people on
and see how they fit.

964
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:09,947
But everybody's an adjustment.
Nobody's perfect.

965
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,480
There's no such thing
as a perfect-

966
01:06:29,706 --> 01:06:31,264
Come on.

967
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:36,940
Dad, I was talking to Jessica
about reincarnation.

968
01:06:37,046 --> 01:06:39,105
She says you knew Annie
in another life.

969
01:06:39,215 --> 01:06:41,740
- Who's Annie?
- The one who wrote us.

970
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:45,343
But Jessica says you and Annie
never got together in that life.

971
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:48,083
<i>So your hearts are like puzzles
with missing pieces.</i>

972
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,352
And when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

973
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,950
Goddamn it.

974
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:55,087
The reason I know this and you don't
is because I'm younger and purer...

975
01:06:55,198 --> 01:06:58,292
so I'm more in touch
with cosmic forces.

976
01:06:58,401 --> 01:07:01,199
- Who told you this stuff?
- Jessica.

977
01:07:01,304 --> 01:07:04,137
I sincerely hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

978
01:07:10,547 --> 01:07:15,075
<i>I remember the days
of just keepin' time</i>

979
01:07:15,185 --> 01:07:19,451
<i>Of hangin' around
in sleepy towns</i>

980
01:07:19,556 --> 01:07:21,683
<i>Forever</i>

981
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:25,625
<i>Back roads empty for miles</i>

982
01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:32,000
<i>Well, you can't have a dream
and cut it to fit</i>

983
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:35,901
<i>But when I saw you
I knew</i>

984
01:07:36,005 --> 01:07:38,439
<i>We'd go together</i>

985
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:41,874
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

986
01:07:45,548 --> 01:07:49,484
<i>Leave your old jalopy</i>

987
01:07:49,586 --> 01:07:53,716
<i>By the railroad track</i>

988
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:57,987
<i>We'll get a hip
double-dip, tip-toppy</i>

989
01:07:58,094 --> 01:08:01,188
<i>Two-seat Pontiac</i>

990
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,694
<i>So you can rev her up</i>

991
01:08:06,803 --> 01:08:08,703
<i>Don't go slow</i>

992
01:08:08,805 --> 01:08:12,241
<i>It's only green lights
and all rights</i>

993
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:15,470
<i>Let's go together</i>

994
01:08:15,578 --> 01:08:18,342
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

995
01:08:32,695 --> 01:08:35,630
<i>Give me a wink and a smile</i>

996
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:49,510
<i>We go together</i>

997
01:08:49,612 --> 01:08:52,342
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

998
01:08:56,286 --> 01:08:59,847
<i>Now my heart hears music</i>

999
01:08:59,956 --> 01:09:02,686
<i>Such a simple song</i>

1000
01:09:04,294 --> 01:09:08,230
<i>Sing it again
The notes never end</i>

1001
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:11,732
<i>This is where I belong</i>

1002
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:16,630
<i>Just the sound of your voice
The light in your eyes</i>

1003
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:21,301
<i>We're so far away
from yesterday</i>

1004
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:23,936
<i>Together</i>

1005
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:27,210
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

1006
01:09:30,153 --> 01:09:33,816
<i>We go together</i>

1007
01:09:33,923 --> 01:09:37,791
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

1008
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:51,567
<i>- I watched him play with his son.
- Did you talk to him?</i>

1009
01:09:52,675 --> 01:09:54,575
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

1010
01:09:56,713 --> 01:10:00,114
<i>- How did I get here?
- You told a lie and got on a plane.</i>

1011
01:10:00,216 --> 01:10:02,184
That's not what I mean.

1012
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:07,488
I'm going back over there tomorrow
and talk to him. I am.

1013
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:10,650
<i>Okay. Good.
Good-bye.</i>

1014
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,660
<i>- Beck?
- What?</i>

1015
01:10:15,164 --> 01:10:17,462
<i>- Is this crazy?
- No.</i>

1016
01:10:17,567 --> 01:10:19,899
<i>That's the weirdest part about it.</i>

1017
01:10:21,004 --> 01:10:23,700
Thank you.
I love you.

1018
01:10:23,806 --> 01:10:26,400
<i>- I love you too.
- Good night.</i>

1019
01:11:29,038 --> 01:11:32,439
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?

1020
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:57,631
Hello.

1021
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:11,106
<i>- So then what happened?
- So then I left, obviously.</i>

1022
01:12:11,981 --> 01:12:13,915
You were standing
in the middle of the street?

1023
01:12:14,016 --> 01:12:17,782
You know that dream when you're on the
street naked and everyone is looking?

1024
01:12:17,887 --> 01:12:19,548
I love that dream.

1025
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:23,250
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing.

1026
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:25,384
- But he saw you, right?
- He saw me.

1027
01:12:25,495 --> 01:12:28,953
- You were face-to-face?
- He said hello.

1028
01:12:29,065 --> 01:12:32,466
- He said hello, and what did you say?
- All I could say was hello.

1029
01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:35,400
Oh, my God!

1030
01:12:35,505 --> 01:12:39,339
<i>And all I could say was hello.</i>

1031
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:41,467
It's a sign.

1032
01:12:41,577 --> 01:12:45,741
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.

1033
01:12:46,849 --> 01:12:48,476
So stupid.

1034
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:53,453
Since I listened to that stupid program
on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.

1035
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:56,218
- You are not a jerk.
- Thank you.

1036
01:12:56,325 --> 01:12:59,453
- Idiot.
- You don't know who she was.

1037
01:12:59,562 --> 01:13:03,464
I saw her. I have a picture of her.
I'll show you a picture of her.

1038
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:06,399
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.

1039
01:13:06,502 --> 01:13:08,402
Here. See?

1040
01:13:08,504 --> 01:13:10,836
<i>That's exactly
what she looks like.</i>

1041
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:13,101
This is a picture
of someone's back.

1042
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:16,440
Well, it's her
and he was crazy about her.

1043
01:13:16,546 --> 01:13:19,913
What's this?
This is from Seattle.

1044
01:13:31,894 --> 01:13:33,794
So I mailed your letter.

1045
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:38,997
"Dear Annie,
thanks for your letter.

1046
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:42,229
It was great.
You sound neat.

1047
01:13:45,575 --> 01:13:49,272
<i>We're very excited about meeting you
in New York on Valentine's Day...</i>

1048
01:13:49,378 --> 01:13:52,176
and seeing if we are...

1049
01:13:52,281 --> 01:13:54,806
M.F.E.O.

1050
01:13:54,917 --> 01:13:56,316
See you soon.

1051
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,883
Sleepless in Seattle. "

1052
01:13:59,989 --> 01:14:01,217
M.F. E.O.?

1053
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:08,389
Made for each other.

1054
01:14:09,398 --> 01:14:12,663
<i>It's cute.
It's like a little clue.</i>

1055
01:14:17,306 --> 01:14:20,537
So he can't write. Big deal.

1056
01:14:20,643 --> 01:14:23,441
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy...

1057
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:26,413
and our pathetic need for it
is what gets us into trouble.

1058
01:14:26,515 --> 01:14:30,383
I will be running back to Walter's arms,
if he'll still have me.

1059
01:14:30,486 --> 01:14:32,511
- What about the letter?
- It means nothing.

1060
01:14:32,622 --> 01:14:35,819
It was written before
I went out there, before the 'ho.

1061
01:14:39,328 --> 01:14:42,764
The only thing is,
she didn't look like a 'ho.

1062
01:14:42,865 --> 01:14:45,698
She looked like somebody
we would've been friends with.

1063
01:14:50,373 --> 01:14:53,240
- You saw her in the airport, then here?
- I tried to talk to her.

1064
01:14:53,342 --> 01:14:55,708
It was like I knew her.
It was weird.

1065
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:57,210
Like a d¨¦j¨¤ vu thing?

1066
01:14:57,313 --> 01:15:01,443
<i>It was a very French
d¨¦j¨¤ vu-ish kind of thing. Oui.</i>

1067
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:05,042
At least you're out there
seeing people again. That's terrific.

1068
01:15:05,154 --> 01:15:07,088
<i>Well, there's really just the one.</i>

1069
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,056
Victoria.

1070
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,957
- You don't like Victoria?
- She laughs like a hyena.

1071
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:15,629
Is this true?

1072
01:15:16,966 --> 01:15:19,992
Sort of, a little bit.
Tell them what you did.

1073
01:15:21,304 --> 01:15:23,738
<i>Tell 'em about the radio show.
They wanna hear it.</i>

1074
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:28,640
Tell 'em. Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows.

1075
01:15:28,744 --> 01:15:31,679
Tells them I need a new wife.

1076
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:33,510
Oh, you're kidding.

1077
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,584
That's so sweet.

1078
01:15:35,685 --> 01:15:39,644
- He's obsessed with a lady who wrote me.
- You serious?

1079
01:15:39,755 --> 01:15:42,690
She wants to meet me at the top
of the Empire State Building.

1080
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:45,260
On Valentine's Day.

1081
01:15:45,361 --> 01:15:48,023
- It's like that movie.
- What movie?

1082
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,997
<i>An Affair To Remember.
Did you ever see it?</i>

1083
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,068
Oh, God.

1084
01:15:53,169 --> 01:15:56,366
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is it "car" or "cur"?

1085
01:15:56,472 --> 01:15:57,996
- Cur.
- Car.

1086
01:15:59,976 --> 01:16:02,672
<i>She's gonna meet him at the top
of the Empire State Building...</i>

1087
01:16:02,778 --> 01:16:05,303
only she got hit by a taxi.

1088
01:16:05,414 --> 01:16:07,314
And he waited and waited.

1089
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:10,385
And it was raining, I think.

1090
01:16:10,486 --> 01:16:11,544
And then...

1091
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:14,885
she's too proud to tell him...

1092
01:16:14,991 --> 01:16:17,118
that she's, uh...

1093
01:16:19,562 --> 01:16:21,553
crippled.

1094
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:25,464
And he's too proud to find out
why she doesn't come.

1095
01:16:25,568 --> 01:16:27,502
<i>But he comes to see her anyway.</i>

1096
01:16:27,603 --> 01:16:29,867
I forget why, but, oh-

1097
01:16:29,972 --> 01:16:34,238
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her because...

1098
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:38,404
he doesn't even notice that
she doesn't get up to say hello.

1099
01:16:38,514 --> 01:16:40,982
And he's very bitter.

1100
01:16:42,385 --> 01:16:46,754
And you think that he's just gonna
walk out the door...

1101
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:51,520
and never know why she's just
lying there, you know, on the couch...

1102
01:16:51,627 --> 01:16:56,030
with this blanket
over her shriveled little legs.

1103
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,260
<i>- Are you all right?
- She's fine.</i>

1104
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:04,806
Suddenly he goes,
"I already sold the painting. "

1105
01:17:04,907 --> 01:17:07,933
And he like
goes to the bedroom...

1106
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:12,071
and he looks and he comes out and
he looks at her and he kind of just-

1107
01:17:12,181 --> 01:17:15,708
They know and then they hug.
And it's so-

1108
01:17:16,685 --> 01:17:19,950
- That's a chick's movie.
- I would say so.

1109
01:17:20,056 --> 01:17:23,389
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?

1110
01:17:23,492 --> 01:17:26,552
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.

1111
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:28,061
Desperate women.

1112
01:17:28,164 --> 01:17:31,463
Just because someone is looking for
a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

1113
01:17:31,567 --> 01:17:33,899
How about rapacious
and love-starved?

1114
01:17:34,003 --> 01:17:37,097
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist
than to find a husband after the age-

1115
01:17:37,206 --> 01:17:39,299
That is absolutely untrue.

1116
01:17:39,408 --> 01:17:41,603
Right, honey. Right.

1117
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,076
<i>I'm not lookin' for
a mail-order bride.</i>

1118
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:48,173
I just want somebody that I can have a
decent conversation with over dinner...

1119
01:17:48,284 --> 01:17:51,776
without it fallin' down
into weepy tears over some movie.

1120
01:17:51,887 --> 01:17:53,354
She's very emotional.

1121
01:17:53,456 --> 01:17:55,549
<i>- But I cried at The Dirty Dozen.
- Who didn't?</i>

1122
01:17:55,658 --> 01:17:59,094
Jim Brown is throwin' these
hand grenades down these air shafts...

1123
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:02,358
and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
were sittin' on top of this...

1124
01:18:02,465 --> 01:18:05,229
armored personnel carrier,
dressed up like Nazis.

1125
01:18:05,334 --> 01:18:08,497
They're waiting.
Trini L¨®pez-

1126
01:18:09,839 --> 01:18:13,206
He busted his neck when they were
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1127
01:18:13,309 --> 01:18:14,833
Stop it.

1128
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:18,971
Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet
'cause he was the M.P.

1129
01:18:19,081 --> 01:18:19,979
No more.

1130
01:18:21,283 --> 01:18:24,013
Oh, God, I love that movie.

1131
01:18:31,861 --> 01:18:35,092
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1132
01:18:35,197 --> 01:18:36,892
<i>What's so great about it?</i>

1133
01:18:36,999 --> 01:18:39,559
You have to find her.
You have to go to her.

1134
01:18:39,668 --> 01:18:41,795
Do you know how much money it costs
to go to New York?

1135
01:18:41,904 --> 01:18:43,804
Nobody knows.

1136
01:18:43,906 --> 01:18:48,002
It changes practically every day.
How much money do you have?

1137
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,509
Eighty dollars.

1138
01:18:49,612 --> 01:18:52,979
I have 42. That would
probably cover taxicabs.

1139
01:18:53,082 --> 01:18:54,549
How would I get there?

1140
01:18:55,651 --> 01:18:58,119
Honey, I have to run
these tickets over to someone.

1141
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,120
Can you keep an eye on things?

1142
01:19:00,222 --> 01:19:02,281
Sure, Mom.

1143
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:15,800
- Do you want a window seat or an aisle?
- Window.

1144
01:19:15,905 --> 01:19:18,169
- Do you want a fruit plate?
- I don't know. Do I?

1145
01:19:18,274 --> 01:19:20,970
I'd rather die
than eat airplane food.

1146
01:19:21,076 --> 01:19:23,271
I'm telling them you're 12
so you can fly unaccompanied...

1147
01:19:23,379 --> 01:19:25,370
and the stewardess
won't carry you around.

1148
01:19:25,481 --> 01:19:28,075
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?

1149
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:31,085
If it's in the computer,
they believe anything.

1150
01:19:31,187 --> 01:19:33,087
Are you sure?

1151
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:35,589
Do you want me to say that
you're really short for your age...

1152
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:37,818
and that they shouldn't say anything
'cause it would hurt your feelings?

1153
01:19:37,927 --> 01:19:40,225
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1154
01:19:40,329 --> 01:19:45,164
<i>Sometimes it's hard to be</i>

1155
01:19:45,267 --> 01:19:47,201
<i>A woman</i>

1156
01:19:50,139 --> 01:19:53,165
<i>Givin' all your love</i>

1157
01:19:53,275 --> 01:19:57,735
<i>To just one man</i>

1158
01:19:57,846 --> 01:19:59,108
Walter.

1159
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:04,180
- You're gonna miss the train.
- No, I'm not.

1160
01:20:04,286 --> 01:20:07,915
I'm so happy, Becky.
Finally I feel happy.

1161
01:20:08,023 --> 01:20:09,923
This is right. This is real.

1162
01:20:10,025 --> 01:20:12,721
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies...

1163
01:20:12,828 --> 01:20:15,296
and you completely
lose sight of what counts.

1164
01:20:15,397 --> 01:20:17,627
Please, don't tell anybody
what happened.

1165
01:20:17,733 --> 01:20:20,293
I would be so absolutely mortified
if anyone knew...

1166
01:20:20,402 --> 01:20:23,667
I did anything even
remotely close to what I've done.

1167
01:20:23,772 --> 01:20:26,741
<i>- Thank you. Do you promise?
- I promise.</i>

1168
01:20:26,842 --> 01:20:29,242
Sleepless in Seattle
is history.

1169
01:20:29,345 --> 01:20:33,406
<i>He's hard to understand</i>

1170
01:20:35,651 --> 01:20:40,111
<i>And if you love him</i>

1171
01:20:40,222 --> 01:20:44,716
<i>Oh, be proud of him</i>

1172
01:20:44,827 --> 01:20:48,126
<i>'Cause after all</i>

1173
01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:50,994
<i>He's just a man</i>

1174
01:20:54,236 --> 01:20:57,137
<i>Stand by your man</i>

1175
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:01,667
I was-

1176
01:21:03,112 --> 01:21:05,046
- Go ahead.
- You go.

1177
01:21:05,147 --> 01:21:07,547
Okay. Well,
I was just gonna say...

1178
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:11,211
<i>that ever since Christmas,
you've been different...</i>

1179
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,845
kind of distracted, distant.

1180
01:21:13,956 --> 01:21:16,390
But now...

1181
01:21:16,492 --> 01:21:21,122
it feels as if you're coming back
from wherever you were.

1182
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,788
I am.

1183
01:21:24,733 --> 01:21:27,258
I was just, uh-

1184
01:21:27,369 --> 01:21:31,499
I just got-
I think I got nervous.

1185
01:21:31,607 --> 01:21:33,768
But that's normal, right?

1186
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:37,573
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about-

1187
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,614
You know?

1188
01:21:39,715 --> 01:21:41,706
What?

1189
01:21:41,817 --> 01:21:43,045
Forever.

1190
01:21:52,861 --> 01:21:56,092
I did, and you know what I think?

1191
01:21:56,198 --> 01:22:00,396
I think I thought
it was too perfect, you know?

1192
01:22:00,502 --> 01:22:03,960
I started to wonder
if we were the human equivalent...

1193
01:22:04,073 --> 01:22:06,166
of two rights making a wrong.

1194
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:08,175
You know what it was?

1195
01:22:08,277 --> 01:22:11,872
It was like kismet, but not,
if you see what I mean.

1196
01:22:13,449 --> 01:22:14,848
You have to grow up.

1197
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:17,714
You just can't keep having
all these adolescent fantasies...

1198
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,220
about how exciting
your life is gonna be.

1199
01:22:20,322 --> 01:22:22,950
Don't hate me,
but I love this pattern.

1200
01:22:23,058 --> 01:22:25,049
- You couldn't.
- I do.

1201
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,958
This is just like
my grandmother's china.

1202
01:22:28,063 --> 01:22:30,497
How many place settings
should I put down?

1203
01:22:30,599 --> 01:22:32,157
Ten.

1204
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,703
<i>Exactly. Eight is too few.</i>

1205
01:22:37,806 --> 01:22:40,434
Twelve is too many.

1206
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:07,901
It was my mother's.

1207
01:23:09,905 --> 01:23:12,135
I had them size it down.

1208
01:23:13,575 --> 01:23:15,634
She had really fat fingers.

1209
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,841
It's so beautiful.

1210
01:23:19,948 --> 01:23:23,111
It's exactly what I would
pick out if I had...

1211
01:23:23,218 --> 01:23:26,016
every ring in the whole world
to choose from.

1212
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:30,157
You see what I mean?

1213
01:23:30,259 --> 01:23:33,751
There are people who would like
a relationship to be full of surprises.

1214
01:23:33,862 --> 01:23:36,194
But I am not one of those people.

1215
01:23:36,298 --> 01:23:38,493
No, sirree.

1216
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,262
Surprises are highly overrated.

1217
01:23:44,173 --> 01:23:47,267
I'm leavin' first thing in the morning,
but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

1218
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:49,469
Clarise is gonna be here,
so you'll be able to see...

1219
01:23:49,578 --> 01:23:51,876
<i>plenty of Geraldo
and Nightmare On Elm Street 12.</i>

1220
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:54,244
- I will never know.
- Are you going with her?

1221
01:23:56,218 --> 01:23:58,277
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1222
01:24:00,556 --> 01:24:03,320
<i>And don't try anything tricky.
Understand?</i>

1223
01:24:06,428 --> 01:24:09,454
Don't go rollin' in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house...

1224
01:24:09,565 --> 01:24:12,966
or lock yourself in a closet or do
anything that makes you need stitches.

1225
01:24:13,068 --> 01:24:15,127
If your finger falls off,
it's stayin' off.

1226
01:24:15,237 --> 01:24:17,637
No one's gonna pack it on ice
and take you to the hospital...

1227
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:20,867
so you can be
a breakthrough in laser surgery.

1228
01:24:20,976 --> 01:24:24,002
- Is this about that woman in Baltimore?
- Annie.

1229
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:30,950
- I don't care what you do!
- Good! Fine!

1230
01:24:31,053 --> 01:24:34,318
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
this weekend. I'm getting laid.

1231
01:24:34,423 --> 01:24:36,391
1990s and nobody is getting laid.

1232
01:24:36,492 --> 01:24:39,120
<i>I'm the only man in America
who is getting laid this weekend.</i>

1233
01:24:39,228 --> 01:24:43,528
I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college, maybe seven.

1234
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:47,768
- How long you been standin' there?
- Forever.

1235
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:51,670
- What did you hear me just say?
- "Six girls in college, maybe seven. "

1236
01:24:51,773 --> 01:24:54,469
Seven.
Eight! Mary Kelly.

1237
01:24:54,576 --> 01:24:56,009
This is the one I like.

1238
01:24:58,947 --> 01:25:01,074
Jonah, the fact is...

1239
01:25:01,183 --> 01:25:04,175
you're not gonna like any woman
because it isn't your mother.

1240
01:25:04,286 --> 01:25:05,844
How do you know?

1241
01:25:05,954 --> 01:25:09,390
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1242
01:25:09,491 --> 01:25:12,016
Shut up?

1243
01:25:12,127 --> 01:25:15,528
<i>Mom never said "shut up" to me.
Mom never yelled at me.</i>

1244
01:25:15,631 --> 01:25:18,759
- The conversation is finished.
- Why can't we go to New York?

1245
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:21,597
There is no way
that we are going on a plane...

1246
01:25:21,703 --> 01:25:24,171
to meet some woman
who could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1247
01:25:24,273 --> 01:25:26,764
<i>- Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?
- You wouldn't let me.</i>

1248
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:29,400
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit outta me.

1249
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:32,537
It scared the shit
outta every man in America!

1250
01:25:33,515 --> 01:25:35,949
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

1251
01:25:41,723 --> 01:25:44,624
- I hate you!
- That's good!

1252
01:25:44,726 --> 01:25:46,250
You'll have to tell Oprah.

1253
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:48,625
How your dad destroyed your life
'cause he had to go off...

1254
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:52,222
for a weekend special
at the Holiday Inn!

1255
01:26:06,748 --> 01:26:10,149
Jonah, Clarise is here
and I gotta go.

1256
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,847
Hey, Jonah.

1257
01:26:20,862 --> 01:26:23,126
All right.
Jonah, listen.

1258
01:26:23,231 --> 01:26:25,563
I gotta go, and I'm-

1259
01:26:54,029 --> 01:26:56,497
Jessica, honey,
you have to tell us where he is.

1260
01:26:56,598 --> 01:26:59,999
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1261
01:27:00,102 --> 01:27:03,594
This is your father.
Tell us where he is, right this minute.

1262
01:27:06,942 --> 01:27:08,603
N.Y.

1263
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:10,701
- What is that?
- No way.

1264
01:27:10,812 --> 01:27:13,372
That's N.W.

1265
01:27:13,482 --> 01:27:15,609
New York.

1266
01:27:15,717 --> 01:27:17,617
He's on his way to New York.

1267
01:27:17,719 --> 01:27:19,152
- What?
- How?

1268
01:27:19,254 --> 01:27:22,451
<i>- United 597.
- Jessica.</i>

1269
01:27:22,557 --> 01:27:25,151
- When does it leave?
- 7:30.

1270
01:27:32,134 --> 01:27:35,126
Here you go. Here's a nice pen
for you for flying with us.

1271
01:27:35,237 --> 01:27:36,636
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1272
01:27:36,738 --> 01:27:38,968
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

1273
01:27:54,856 --> 01:27:57,154
- Where to, kid?
- Empire State Building.

1274
01:27:57,259 --> 01:28:00,057
Hold on.
Empire State Building.

1275
01:28:00,162 --> 01:28:03,495
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, mac.

1276
01:28:05,367 --> 01:28:06,595
There it is.

1277
01:28:06,702 --> 01:28:09,330
What you gonna do
when you get up there?

1278
01:28:09,438 --> 01:28:11,565
- Spit off the top?
- No.

1279
01:28:11,673 --> 01:28:14,267
I'm going to meet my new mother.

1280
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:37,096
<i>Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?</i>

1281
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:39,429
No. I'm Cynthia.

1282
01:28:46,575 --> 01:28:49,135
<i>Excuse me.
Are you Annie?</i>

1283
01:29:27,516 --> 01:29:29,416
Great table. Thanks.

1284
01:29:31,853 --> 01:29:33,582
Something wrong?

1285
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:37,418
- Can I get you a drink?
- Some champagne?

1286
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,494
Fine.

1287
01:29:41,596 --> 01:29:42,995
Can we have a bottle...

1288
01:29:43,098 --> 01:29:45,965
of Dom DeLuise?

1289
01:29:48,336 --> 01:29:50,236
- Just kidding.
- It was a joke.

1290
01:29:50,338 --> 01:29:52,932
- He meant Dom P¨¦rignon.
- I got it.

1291
01:29:56,545 --> 01:29:58,740
Beautiful view, isn't it?

1292
01:29:58,847 --> 01:30:03,648
Walter, there's something
I have to tell you.

1293
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,600
Hey, I'm sorry.
I have an emergency.

1294
01:30:20,702 --> 01:30:23,364
Look! Money!
All right?

1295
01:30:23,471 --> 01:30:25,701
- Get right in.
- Wait a minute.

1296
01:30:25,807 --> 01:30:27,365
Taxi!

1297
01:31:41,216 --> 01:31:45,414
So, he could be on top
of the Empire State Building now.

1298
01:31:48,089 --> 01:31:50,114
I guess he could be.

1299
01:31:52,794 --> 01:31:55,194
It's not him, Walter.
It's me.

1300
01:31:56,831 --> 01:31:58,731
I can't do this.

1301
01:32:00,468 --> 01:32:03,062
Look, Annie...

1302
01:32:03,171 --> 01:32:06,834
I love you,
but let's leave that outta this.

1303
01:32:08,143 --> 01:32:11,010
I don't wanna be someone
that you're settling for.

1304
01:32:11,112 --> 01:32:14,946
I don't wanna be someone
that anyone settles for.

1305
01:32:16,618 --> 01:32:18,518
Marriage is hard enough...

1306
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:22,317
without bringing such
low expectations into it.

1307
01:32:22,424 --> 01:32:23,823
Isn't it?

1308
01:32:24,759 --> 01:32:27,193
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1309
01:32:28,096 --> 01:32:30,496
I wouldn't put it that way.

1310
01:32:32,033 --> 01:32:34,365
But, okay.

1311
01:32:50,585 --> 01:32:51,813
You okay?

1312
01:32:52,787 --> 01:32:54,550
Yeah.

1313
01:32:59,861 --> 01:33:01,852
- What?
- Look.

1314
01:33:10,605 --> 01:33:13,631
<i>- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?</i>

1315
01:33:17,045 --> 01:33:18,706
I have to go.

1316
01:33:53,715 --> 01:33:58,015
<i>What if something had happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?</i>

1317
01:33:58,119 --> 01:34:00,883
I'm sorry.

1318
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:05,181
What would I have done?

1319
01:34:05,293 --> 01:34:08,558
You are my family.
You're all I've got.

1320
01:34:08,663 --> 01:34:11,188
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.

1321
01:34:11,299 --> 01:34:13,859
We're doin' okay, aren't we?
Aren't we all right?

1322
01:34:13,968 --> 01:34:16,801
- Have I done anything really stupid?
- No.

1323
01:34:16,905 --> 01:34:19,373
- Have I screwed it up for both of us?
- No.

1324
01:35:13,094 --> 01:35:16,461
<i>- Observation deck?
- Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.</i>

1325
01:35:17,732 --> 01:35:19,893
Please. I really need
to get up there.

1326
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:22,401
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.

1327
01:35:28,143 --> 01:35:30,373
Listen.

1328
01:35:30,478 --> 01:35:34,005
<i>Can I just take a look?
There's someone I was supposed to meet.</i>

1329
01:35:34,115 --> 01:35:36,709
He's probably not there,
but if I don't at least look...

1330
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:39,218
I'll always wonder about it.

1331
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,220
Cary Grant, right?

1332
01:35:41,322 --> 01:35:43,586
You know that movie?

1333
01:35:43,691 --> 01:35:45,921
One of my wife's favorites.

1334
01:35:54,702 --> 01:35:57,830
<i>Maybe when we get home
we'll get a dog.</i>

1335
01:35:57,939 --> 01:36:01,204
- Okay.
- What do you mean "okay"?

1336
01:36:01,309 --> 01:36:04,437
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

1337
01:36:17,258 --> 01:36:19,886
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1338
01:36:22,397 --> 01:36:25,230
Can I take a minute?

1339
01:36:25,333 --> 01:36:26,891
Go ahead.

1340
01:37:40,775 --> 01:37:42,902
I left it by the telescopes.

1341
01:38:09,804 --> 01:38:12,102
- It's you.
- It's me.

1342
01:38:12,206 --> 01:38:16,006
- I saw you in the street.
- Are you Annie?

1343
01:38:18,012 --> 01:38:19,843
Yes.

1344
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:24,514
You're Annie?

1345
01:38:27,255 --> 01:38:29,246
This must be yours.

1346
01:38:29,357 --> 01:38:32,554
I'm Jonah.
This is my dad.

1347
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,560
- His name's Sam.
- Hi, Jonah.

1348
01:38:43,571 --> 01:38:45,630
- And who's this?
- Howard.

1349
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:48,470
Oh, Howard.
Hello, Howard.

1350
01:39:03,925 --> 01:39:05,153
We better go.

1351
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,900
Shall we?

1352
01:39:46,367 --> 01:39:50,565
<i>It's so important
to make someone happy</i>

1353
01:39:50,671 --> 01:39:54,767
<i>Make just one someone happy</i>

1354
01:39:54,876 --> 01:39:59,813
<i>Make just one heart
the heart you</i>

1355
01:39:59,914 --> 01:40:02,405
<i>- You sing to
- Sam.</i>

1356
01:40:03,751 --> 01:40:05,946
It's nice to meet you.

1357
01:40:07,221 --> 01:40:11,282
<i>One face that lights
when it nears you</i>

1358
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:13,826
<i>One girl you're</i>

1359
01:40:13,928 --> 01:40:18,991
<i>You're everything to</i>

1360
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,660
<i>Fame</i>

1361
01:40:21,769 --> 01:40:23,794
<i>If you win it</i>

1362
01:40:23,905 --> 01:40:28,035
<i>Comes and goes in a minute</i>

1363
01:40:28,142 --> 01:40:32,078
<i>Where's the real stuff in life</i>

1364
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:35,946
<i>To cling to</i>

1365
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:40,487
<i>Love is the answer</i>

1366
01:40:40,588 --> 01:40:44,991
<i>Someone to love is the answer</i>

1367
01:40:45,092 --> 01:40:49,153
<i>Once you've found her</i>

1368
01:40:49,263 --> 01:40:53,427
<i>Build your world around her</i>

1369
01:40:53,534 --> 01:40:57,664
<i>Make someone happy</i>

1370
01:40:57,772 --> 01:41:01,936
<i>Make just one someone happy</i>

1371
01:41:02,043 --> 01:41:07,777
<i>And you will be happy too</i>
