1
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,050
Come on, Doc.

2
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,691
Reporting live from the home...

3
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:11,201
...of Dr. Richard Kimble...

4
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:14,411
...a respected vascular surgeon at
Chicago Memorial Hospital.

5
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:15,911
Details are sketchy...

6
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:20,502
...but we understand Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered this evening.

7
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,712
Area Six detectives are bringing
Dr. Kimble out.

8
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:28,303
We assume that they're gonna be taking
him to a police station, probably Area Six...

9
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:33,013
...where they hope he can shed some light
on what happened here this evening.

10
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:36,104
Now, as I indicated,
she was found shortly before midnight.

11
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:39,314
We know that she made apparently
a 911 call to police...

12
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:42,694
...indicating that she was
being assaulted by an intruder.

13
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:44,524
Details are very sketchy.

14
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:47,315
We do know that he and his wife Helen...

15
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:50,485
...were at the Four Seasons
Hotel earlier tonight...

16
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,575
...a fundraiser for the
Children's Research Fund.

17
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:59,205
Rich, remember Cara?

18
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,545
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

19
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:12,976
Straighten that arm or you're gonna slice.

20
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,766
Golf pro teach you that?

21
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,226
My wife.

22
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,857
Before I forget...

23
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,737
...thanks for the loaner.
Keys are downstairs.

24
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:26,447
- Any gas in it?
- Yes. Enough.

25
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,367
Alec, Richard Kimble.

26
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,577
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble!

27
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,549
Knock it off!

28
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:44,719
There's nothing to see here.
And you, come with me.

29
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,589
Thank you.
I was just down to my last joke.

30
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,109
You look really beautiful tonight.

31
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,780
Thanks, honey.

32
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,410
I know you hate these things, but God,
I love looking at you in a tux.

33
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,120
I feel I look like a waiter or something.

34
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,711
- Dr. Kimble?
- Yes, it is.

35
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,051
Sorry to bother you, sir...

36
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:26,721
...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency
Surgery and needs your help.

37
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:31,051
Call him back and tell him
I'll be right there.

38
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:32,512
Thank you, Doctor.

39
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,272
Thank you. Good night.

40
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:38,142
I'll wait up for you.

41
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:40,813
I'll wait up for you.

42
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:10,845
Talk to me. What have we here?

43
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,555
Thanks for coming.

44
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:17,066
A 58-year-old.
Just pulled his gallbladder. Bleeding.

45
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,396
Big time. It's in the liver bed.

46
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,736
- What are his coags?
- They're all messed up.

47
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:24,196
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.

48
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,866
Where is he from?

49
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,496
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.

50
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,577
Here guys. Let me in there.
Give me some room.

51
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,587
Give me a clamp.

52
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:37,207
Give me suction.

53
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,917
Have you been getting
any threats at work?

54
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:43,007
Co-workers, hospital staff, anyone?

55
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:47,637
Anything unusual going on...

56
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:50,517
...phone calls, people hanging up?

57
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,897
Maybe people coming to the door?

58
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:54,307
Tradespeople?

59
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:56,227
Not that I know of.

60
00:06:56,607 --> 00:07:00,397
Back to this fight
with this guy with one arm.

61
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:03,358
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?

62
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:05,408
Upstairs.

63
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:08,239
And he had which? A right or a left arm?

64
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,619
With a gimmick on it?

65
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:13,619
Right arm.

66
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,380
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...

67
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,380
No, he had a cosmetic hand.

68
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,050
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good one.

69
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,890
Anyone else have the coding?

70
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,430
Our maid.

71
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,271
She knows the code and has a key.

72
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:35,902
Those scratches on your neck...

73
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,652
...did the one-armed guy do that?

74
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,362
Helen scratched me
when I was trying to move her.

75
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:45,742
Before or after you had the fight
with the one-armed man?

76
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,162
I told you.

77
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,372
You own a gun, Doc?

78
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:52,912
Do you own a gun?

79
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:56,712
Yes, we have a gun in the house.

80
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,502
Is it registered in your name?

81
00:07:58,592 --> 00:07:59,462
Yes.

82
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,133
Where do you usually keep that gun?

83
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,883
The one that you own.

84
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,803
It's in Helen's table.

85
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,973
Bedside table.

86
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:11,183
Do you keep much jewelry in the house?

87
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,814
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...

88
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:18,194
...the gun and the bullets...

89
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,695
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.

90
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:25,205
She's got the money
in the family, hasn't she?

91
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:29,076
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.

92
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:31,916
Is she insured?

93
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,916
Yes, she is.

94
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,336
Who's the beneficiary?

95
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:41,096
I am.

96
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,716
The sole beneficiary?

97
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:45,926
Yes.

98
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:50,016
Financially, you won't be
hurting after this, will you?

99
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:54,026
I mean, she was worth
quite a bit of money.

100
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,857
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?

101
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:03,787
You're saying that I crushed
her skull and shot her.

102
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:06,787
How dare you!

103
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,877
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

104
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,707
I fought with this man.

105
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,958
- The one-armed man.
- He had a mechanical arm.

106
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,678
- Plastic? Rubber?
- You find this man!

107
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,468
You find this man!

108
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:21,468
How tall?

109
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:23,468
He took everything from me.

110
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:24,888
Oh, Jesus.

111
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,558
What did he weigh?

112
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:28,480
What color was his hair?

113
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,810
What color were his eyes?

114
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,781
We can't help you if you don't help us.

115
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,281
Book him.

116
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,571
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

117
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:44,991
...you will hear iron-clad proof
of Richard Kimble's guilt.

118
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:49,671
Indisputable scientific evidence...

119
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:52,421
...that on the night of January 20...

120
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:55,171
...Richard Kimble did in fact viciously...

121
00:09:58,302 --> 00:09:59,592
...attack...

122
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:02,682
...and brutally murder his wife.

123
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:06,602
But you'll hear more than that.

124
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,352
You will hear a voice from the grave.

125
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,863
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...

126
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,323
...her husband, Richard Kimble.

127
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,113
Detective Kelly...

128
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:23,123
...tell us what you observed at the home
of the victim on the night of the murder.

129
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:25,123
No forcible entry was found.

130
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,294
From the beginning of the investigation,
it didn't appear to be a break-in.

131
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:32,884
Nothing was missing.

132
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:37,554
Honey, I'm home.

133
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:39,804
Who won the game?

134
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,264
His prints were on the gun and bullets.

135
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:45,764
No other sets were found,
other than the housekeeper's...

136
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,434
...and the deceased's.

137
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:53,945
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.

138
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,696
It took less than 5 minutes for her to die.

139
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,677
Your Honor, we would ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

140
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,888
...previously identified by a Chicago
Police Department dispatcher.

141
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:23,888
Emergency 911.

142
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:26,519
Please help me.

143
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,769
What's the problem?

144
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,439
He's...

145
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,909
He's still in the house.

146
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,699
Did I hear you right?

147
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,619
Someone's in your house?

148
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,409
He's trying to kill me.

149
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,579
Could you repeat that, please?

150
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,289
Ma'am?

151
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,299
He's trying to kill me.

152
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,549
Is your attacker still in the house?

153
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,560
Richard...

154
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,231
Richard...

155
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,571
Is he trying to kill me?

156
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:19,952
Mr. Kimble...

157
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:23,912
...having considered all the factors and
aggravation and mitigation in this case...

158
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:28,753
...and found the offense was brutal
and indicative of wanton cruelty...

159
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:34,383
...it's judgment of this court, you will be
remanded to Illinois State Penitentiary...

160
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:38,263
...where you will await
execution by lethal injection...

161
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:42,683
...on a date to be set forth by
the Attorney General of the State.

162
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,483
May God have mercy on your soul.

163
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:12,805
- Carlson.
- Here.

164
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:14,256
- Partida.
- Yeah.

165
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:16,176
- Copeland.
- What?

166
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,727
Copeland, you be nice now.

167
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:20,807
Kimble.

168
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,107
Yeah.

169
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:30,908
Let's go, gentlemen.

170
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,408
Four prisoners coming out.

171
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,429
Let's go, gentlemen.

172
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,349
Kimble, you're here.

173
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:06,779
Carlson, right over there.

174
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:09,110
Partida, up front left.

175
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,410
Copeland, you're back here with me.

176
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,700
Come on, make yourselves comfortable.

177
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,790
You know the routine, gentlemen.

178
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:51,112
I'm tired.

179
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,123
20 miles from Menard.

180
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,663
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.

181
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:04,503
I'll be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie take care of them.

182
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:08,635
Always got some good eating there.
I'm starving.

183
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:10,175
Me, too.

184
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:13,845
Had enough prison chow.

185
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:19,775
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.

186
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:21,775
Right, Ed?

187
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:34,866
Somebody get in here, quick!

188
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,456
He's getting sick! Let's go move! Move!

189
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:42,716
- He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.

190
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,006
He's choking!

191
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:47,137
Wait!

192
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,610
Oh, shit!

193
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,531
Kimble, get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!

194
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:53,121
Unlock me!

195
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:00,252
You'll be okay.

196
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:07,724
What the hell is that?

197
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:13,394
Shit!

198
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,984
Help me!

199
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:19,564
The hell with you.

200
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,485
Help me with this man!

201
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:24,485
Kiss my ass, Doctor.

202
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:47,514
Now you listen.

203
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:50,315
I don't give a damn which way you go.

204
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,685
Just don't follow me. You got that?

205
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,525
Be good.

206
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,488
My, my, my.

207
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,408
What a mess.

208
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:43,238
It's a circus.

209
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,830
You got my bag?

210
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,750
Point of impact right here.

211
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,340
The first engine uncoupled,
and the train jumped the track.

212
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,930
About 100 yards?

213
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,681
You must get new boots.

214
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,351
I told you not to wear the heels.

215
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,771
Wear two coats.

216
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,351
Next train wreck.

217
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,691
Why do we always mother her?

218
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:09,271
Because she loves us.

219
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,361
- How'd you like to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.

220
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:14,691
Hold it, sir.

221
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,402
Hi. Who's in charge?

222
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:18,702
Sheriff Rollins.

223
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,742
Just follow the TV lights.

224
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,372
Sheriff Rogers.

225
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,622
Rollins!

226
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,962
Look down there and take Newman.

227
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:34,632
Come on. Time to go to work.

228
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:39,722
The bus rolled over several times before
settling down at the bottom of the hill.

229
00:21:39,802 --> 00:21:42,142
I don't know if I passed out or what...

230
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:46,223
...but when I looked up,
the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

231
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:49,643
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

232
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:53,484
Somehow I grabbed him and pushed him
out of the bus.

233
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:56,654
- You're brave, you could've been killed.
- I know.

234
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:59,404
He's my partner.
He would have done the same for me.

235
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:03,285
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S.
Marshal Samuel Gerard, I'd like to...

236
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:05,745
I'll be with you in just a minute.

237
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,335
One more time, just for the record...

238
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,505
...these three are dead.

239
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:13,925
And this one?

240
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:17,096
Everything happened so fast.

241
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,176
I don't think he made it.

242
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,806
You came a long way for nothing.

243
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,896
With all due respect, Sheriff Rollins...

244
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:28,726
...I'd like to recommend
checkpoints on a 15-mile radius...

245
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,526
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route 13...

246
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,446
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

247
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:40,156
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic
and they'll flood my office with calls.

248
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:42,577
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

249
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:45,248
...so I'll take over your investigation.

250
00:22:48,128 --> 00:22:49,588
On what authority?

251
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,008
The governor...

252
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:53,048
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...

253
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:55,298
...5th District, Northern Illinois.

254
00:22:55,968 --> 00:23:00,139
All right, you want jurisdiction
over this mess. You got it.

255
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:02,559
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.

256
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:05,399
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp is here to mop up...

257
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,690
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

258
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,320
Sam.

259
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,150
Look here!

260
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:19,201
We're always fascinated when
we find leg irons with no legs in them.

261
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:21,041
Who held the key, sir?

262
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,201
Me.

263
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:24,041
Where're those keys at?

264
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:25,461
I don't know.

265
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,581
Care to revise your statement, sir?

266
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:28,541
What?

267
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:31,381
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?

268
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,261
- He might've got out.
- He might've got out.

269
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,721
You said he was part of the wreckage!

270
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:42,931
Set up operations by the fire truck.
Listen, everyone!

271
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,852
A fugitive has been on
the run for 90 minutes.

272
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:50,272
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is four miles an hour.

273
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,612
That gives us a radius of six miles.

274
00:23:55,572 --> 00:24:00,203
What I want out of each and everyone of
you is a hard target search of every...

275
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,753
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...

276
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:06,673
...and doghouse in that area.

277
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,383
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

278
00:24:10,923 --> 00:24:14,424
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.

279
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,054
Go get him.

280
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,560
Please don't give me shit.

281
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,480
I got three very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.

282
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Stevens, it's Cosmo.

283
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,611
I'll have a satellite telephone hookup
in two seconds.

284
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:46,281
Chester Police just found a blood trail...

285
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,491
...two miles southwest.

286
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:51,701
Match that blood against the prisoners'.

287
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:56,662
Get a fax I.D. on Kimble
to every local hospital.

288
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:58,832
And follow that with troopers.

289
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:03,832
What are you doing?

290
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:05,542
I'm thinking.

291
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:09,382
Think me up some coffee and a
doughnut with sprinkles on top...

292
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:11,303
...while you're thinking.

293
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,053
We got a live body!

294
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:14,723
A live one?

295
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:23,353
Come on. Hang in there, brother.
We'll get you out of here.

296
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:29,074
Get that ambulance down here! Come on!

297
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:37,938
Is this what you want?

298
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:39,609
That's it.

299
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:41,779
I'm going to make some copies.

300
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:09,472
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.

301
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:12,472
We're thirsty today, aren't we?

302
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:14,982
Eat up before this gets cold.

303
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:23,153
It really does get dry in here, doesn't it?

304
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:29,373
Here you are.

305
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:31,583
Now, you eat something, Mr. Johnson.

306
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:33,373
You need your strength.

307
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:23,757
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. He might be hurt.

308
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,597
What does he look like?

309
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:28,427
Six-one, 180, brown hair,
brown eyes, beard.

310
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:30,347
Seen anyone like that around?

311
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,687
Every time I look in the mirror, pal.

312
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,607
Except for the beard, of course.

313
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:35,687
Doc!

314
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:43,448
Thanks.

315
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,879
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, Doc.

316
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:02,089
It's...

317
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:04,719
How is he doing?

318
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,850
Good, considering we dug him out
from under a train.

319
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,140
Tell those attending he's got a puncture
in the upper gastric area.

320
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,940
How could he tell that
by looking at his face?

321
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:26,451
Background just came in from Chicago.

322
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,911
About time. What've we got?

323
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:32,922
"Richard Davis Kimble, vascular surgeon. "
What the hell is that?

324
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:35,712
Somebody that makes more money
than you.

325
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:38,753
"Convicted of first-degree murder of his
wife.

326
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:41,843
"Pleaded innocent. "
Says a one-armed man did it.

327
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:43,433
Lots of friends.

328
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,933
Doctors, hospital staff.

329
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:49,603
We'll start there. I want phone taps.
First, his lawyer.

330
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:50,973
You'll never going to get that.

331
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:53,774
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want phone taps.

332
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:55,774
Why'd you yell at me?

333
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:58,024
I'll tell him who if I'm in a good mood.

334
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:00,074
Why not yell at her sometimes?

335
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,784
We got a call from the hospital.

336
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:05,664
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble there.

337
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:06,955
That's hot.

338
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,785
And an ambulance is missing.

339
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,455
Where the hell is he going
in an ambulance?

340
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:31,895
Ambulance just spotted...

341
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:36,316
...two miles west of Doverville,
heading north, State Highway 53.

342
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,986
Running out of map!

343
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:53,338
Get your maps out.

344
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:56,218
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.

345
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:04,928
I want to know all routes
in and out of that town.

346
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,450
We're headed north on Route 13,
toward the Barkley Dam.

347
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,870
Son of a bitch!

348
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,880
Don't lose that ambulance.

349
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:47,391
Visual location of an ambulance headed
north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.

350
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:49,562
We'll pass through a viaduct.

351
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:57,073
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and Newman
in from the south side of the viaduct.

352
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,573
He's hauling ass.

353
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:07,754
Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?

354
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,754
Look on your map
to know how to get there.

355
00:33:39,905 --> 00:33:41,245
We got him!

356
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:01,846
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

357
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:08,278
- What's going on?
- Get back in your car, sir!

358
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,069
Newman! Rock and roll!

359
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,079
Put a light in there!

360
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:26,669
Put a light in there!

361
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:28,169
What do you got?

362
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,009
I got nothing.

363
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:34,130
- What do you got?
- You gotta be kidding me!

364
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,300
You gotta be kidding me!

365
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,600
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!

366
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:05,372
We got a gopher.

367
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:22,932
Shit! I just bought these shoes.

368
00:35:23,312 --> 00:35:25,143
Shut up, Cosmo.

369
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:26,983
Which way, Sam?

370
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:16,681
I didn't kill my wife!

371
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:19,351
I don't care!

372
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:13,416
Put that gun down!

373
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:17,246
Put that gun down!

374
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:19,586
Now!

375
00:38:20,836 --> 00:38:22,086
Hands up!

376
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,796
Over your head!

377
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,756
Turn around!

378
00:38:28,176 --> 00:38:30,347
Richard, do you want to get shot?

379
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:37,607
Pay attention!

380
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,777
Get down on your knees!

381
00:38:39,937 --> 00:38:41,777
Right now!

382
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,640
What happened? Where'd he go?

383
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,310
He did a Peter Pan right here off this dam!

384
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,810
Right here!

385
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,810
Down! Boom!

386
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,980
Holy shit!

387
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,020
Can we go home now?

388
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,020
No.

389
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,900
Holy shit!

390
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:32,371
- There's no way out of here!
- We must go up.

391
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:38,421
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

392
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,383
Have that water turned off.
Come over here.

393
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:50,803
Put two patrol cars on that bridge
down there, four patrolmen.

394
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:53,683
Have them glass this river
upstream and down.

395
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:58,694
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river.
Make him aware of these wires.

396
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,944
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!

397
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,034
That'll make him easy to catch.

398
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:06,494
I want hounds on both banks
of this river for two miles...

399
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,914
...upstream and downstream.

400
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,584
You've got a search-and-rescue team?

401
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:16,084
Get them down here and drag
the bottom of this spillway.

402
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:20,215
- Why isn't the water turned off?
- Somebody from County's working on it.

403
00:40:58,298 --> 00:41:00,798
Bring in the helicopters now.

404
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:02,758
We're out of here!

405
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,348
I don't think there's anything to find.

406
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:09,098
Find it anyway. You've got lights
and generators coming tonight.

407
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,211
- I won't tell you how to do your job...
- Put the helicopter on the bridge!

408
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:42,182
...but only one person in a million could
survive that fall. The guy is fish food!

409
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:45,102
Get a cane pole.
Go catch the fish that ate him.

410
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:49,482
Get Stevens. Tell him we're on the way in.

411
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,089
That man took everything from me!

412
00:43:36,929 --> 00:43:38,510
We can't find the guy.

413
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,180
We can't find the guy.

414
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,770
You find that man!

415
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:57,611
You find that man!

416
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:59,281
You find that man!

417
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:06,372
The generators and searchlights
are there now.

418
00:44:06,462 --> 00:44:09,502
They'll continue the search into the night.

419
00:44:09,632 --> 00:44:12,632
Good. Call Kentucky and
thank them for the dogs.

420
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:16,472
Remember, opera ain't over
until the Big Dog howls.

421
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,496
Need a ride?

422
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:41,519
Check it again.

423
00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:45,939
All right, we got him. He shacked up
with some babe over in Whiting.

424
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:48,649
She left work tonight and took him home.

425
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:53,160
- About two hours ago, her boss said.
- They spotted her car outside her house.

426
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,320
Does she run with anyone?

427
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,330
No one we could find. No family either.

428
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,250
Tell the police not to move till we get
there. We'll go first thing in the morning.

429
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,170
Your cousin still got his truck?

430
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,250
Call him. Tell him we need it.

431
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:29,482
Be drunk, Newman.

432
00:46:30,782 --> 00:46:32,112
Stay close.

433
00:46:33,112 --> 00:46:34,862
Right on your ass, buddy.

434
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:44,963
I don't want you getting lost.
You stick with me.

435
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,514
U.S. marshals! Everybody down!

436
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:09,194
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!

437
00:47:13,614 --> 00:47:14,864
Keep them up!

438
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:21,666
Get your ass in there.

439
00:47:21,996 --> 00:47:25,126
I got your man! I got your man,
you hear me?

440
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:28,756
I want out of here!

441
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:30,636
I got your man!

442
00:47:31,256 --> 00:47:32,846
I got your man!

443
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:37,637
I'm going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!

444
00:47:38,517 --> 00:47:40,107
Do you hear me, Cops?

445
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:42,148
Do you hear me?

446
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:43,858
I want out of here!

447
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:48,198
- Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.

448
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:51,449
Shut up! Shut up!

449
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,369
Do you hear me?

450
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,909
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.

451
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,959
I just want a car out front.

452
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:03,709
Don't shoot.

453
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:05,879
It's over.

454
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,650
Shut up!

455
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,403
I can't hear anything. My ear is...

456
00:49:09,243 --> 00:49:11,204
I can't believe you did that.

457
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:15,494
You think I should've
bargained with that guy.

458
00:49:17,044 --> 00:49:18,085
Yeah.

459
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:19,875
I do.

460
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,465
You could have missed.

461
00:49:23,465 --> 00:49:25,385
You could have killed me.

462
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:29,385
How bad is that ear?

463
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:31,885
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.

464
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,266
Let me see it.

465
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,396
Come here.

466
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:38,566
Can you hear what I'm saying now?

467
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:39,776
Yeah.

468
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,316
I don't...

469
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:44,616
...bargain.

470
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:48,077
You hear that?

471
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:50,157
Yeah.

472
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:52,827
Good.

473
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,380
Walter, this is Richard.

474
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,630
Richard, Jesus! Why did you run?
Running only makes you look guilty.

475
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,630
I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.

476
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,141
Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.

477
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:50,721
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

478
00:50:52,061 --> 00:50:56,401
You're asking me to harbor and aid a
convicted felon. I can't help you that way.

479
00:50:56,481 --> 00:51:00,571
My advice both as your friend and
legal counselor is to give yourself up.

480
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:02,901
Now tell me, where are you?

481
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:04,902
St. Louis.

482
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:08,202
Give me an address.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

483
00:51:13,752 --> 00:51:17,503
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.

484
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:22,003
Well, sir, you can blame me.
I'm the one that shot him.

485
00:51:31,015 --> 00:51:34,775
Give yourself up.
Now tell me, where are you?

486
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,695
St. Louis.

487
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:39,615
So he's not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.

488
00:51:39,775 --> 00:51:43,155
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.

489
00:51:43,615 --> 00:51:45,786
Yeah, you been right before.

490
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:49,876
Walter, this is Richard.

491
00:51:51,126 --> 00:51:54,206
Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.

492
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:56,546
I wasn't worried about appearances.

493
00:51:56,796 --> 00:52:00,296
Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.

494
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:02,806
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

495
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:05,676
I might be crazy,
but that train sounds like an EI.

496
00:52:05,716 --> 00:52:07,556
St. Louis doesn't have one.

497
00:52:07,636 --> 00:52:10,016
How do you know it's an elevated train?

498
00:52:10,146 --> 00:52:12,306
I lived under an El for 20 years.

499
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:17,067
Explain the difference between the sound
of an El and a train on the ground.

500
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:18,487
You must have ears like an eagle.

501
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:21,567
Play that back.
I want to hear the sound of an EI.

502
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,907
What cities have Els?
New York has got an EI.

503
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,327
- Philly.
- We do.

504
00:52:26,497 --> 00:52:27,747
Milwaukee has got an EI.

505
00:52:27,827 --> 00:52:30,748
Hold it! Where the lawyer says he's guilty.
There's a bell in the background.

506
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:33,998
There's a guy on a P.A.
Can you drop everything but him?

507
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:36,708
I'll try. Hold on.

508
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:42,179
Right there.

509
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:44,430
What's he saying?

510
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,680
Sounds like, "Next stop. " Do that again!

511
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,690
"Next stop... "

512
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,940
"Merchandise Mart. "

513
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,361
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.

514
00:52:57,781 --> 00:53:01,071
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
six blocks away.

515
00:53:02,201 --> 00:53:03,781
I knew it was an EI.

516
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:06,201
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

517
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:09,451
- I'll call the C.P.D.
- This is his Chicago file.

518
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:11,041
Andiamo, bambini.

519
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,832
Sammy, when I die,
I want to come back just like you.

520
00:53:13,882 --> 00:53:15,342
Happy and handsome?

521
00:53:16,132 --> 00:53:17,962
- I'll notify the press.
- No press.

522
00:53:18,052 --> 00:53:19,422
Right, no press.

523
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:40,243
- Hi, Billy.
- How's it going, sir?

524
00:53:40,323 --> 00:53:42,323
- Good, and you?
- All right.

525
00:53:45,784 --> 00:53:48,374
- Here you go, Billy.
- Have a good one, sir.

526
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:04,095
Spare change? Dollar, mister?

527
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:07,435
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.

528
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:12,605
Oh, my God. Richard!

529
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,736
How are you, Charlie?

530
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:16,316
Jesus, you're back.

531
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:17,736
I need some money.

532
00:54:17,826 --> 00:54:19,326
Sure, sure. Get in.

533
00:54:19,446 --> 00:54:22,036
No, I can't. Just whatever you got on you.

534
00:54:22,116 --> 00:54:24,536
You're hot, pal. If not now, you will be.

535
00:54:24,616 --> 00:54:27,917
Have you got a place to stay?
I mean, how can I help you?

536
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:31,337
You've got a green light. Move on!

537
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,257
I'll call you.

538
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:46,308
So why did Richard Kimble kill his wife?

539
00:54:46,478 --> 00:54:47,898
He did it for the money.

540
00:54:47,978 --> 00:54:50,769
For the money? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.

541
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:52,279
She was more rich.

542
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:56,239
Is this the entire Chicago Police
Department file?

543
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,619
- That's everything.
- I want to do all the interviews again.

544
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:02,119
The list of hospital staff is it in the file?

545
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,079
Sure is.

546
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:04,250
Thank you.

547
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,080
You don't want to use the media?

548
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,840
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.

549
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:17,181
Here's the apartment.

550
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:20,511
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.

551
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:23,021
Here is kitchen. Sink.

552
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:26,021
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.

553
00:55:26,231 --> 00:55:27,732
Is nice bed.

554
00:55:27,902 --> 00:55:29,352
Plenty space.

555
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:30,902
You can look at.

556
00:55:54,423 --> 00:55:56,223
So you like the place?

557
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,013
It's okay with you?

558
00:55:58,723 --> 00:55:59,933
It's perfect.

559
00:56:00,723 --> 00:56:02,223
All right, people.

560
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:06,393
As this morning we were notified
by the U.S. Marshal's Office...

561
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:11,234
...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble
is alive and well and back here in Chicago.

562
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:14,864
You all know in what high regard
we hold this scumbag.

563
00:56:15,574 --> 00:56:18,655
So I'm personally donating a
bottle of 12-year-old Scotch...

564
00:56:18,745 --> 00:56:21,375
...to whoever puts the collar on this quack.

565
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:23,915
Dick Rosetti is passing out bulletins.

566
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,252
- Help you?
- Gracias.

567
00:59:19,978 --> 00:59:21,858
You went to medical school together?

568
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:23,359
Yes, we did.

569
00:59:23,979 --> 00:59:25,779
The class of '73.

570
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:27,989
You know Morton Feinberg?

571
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,239
- I do.
- He's a real nice guy.

572
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:32,409
When did you see him last?

573
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:33,829
Who, Richard?

574
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:38,370
I saw Richard this morning.

575
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,790
You saw him this morning?

576
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,420
He stopped me in my car.
I gave him money.

577
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:46,300
Where was this?

578
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,970
Outside my tennis club.

579
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,390
Did he ask for help?

580
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:53,510
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.

581
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,430
How much did you give him?

582
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,940
Couple of bucks. Just what I had on me.

583
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,361
- He won't get far on that.
- Why'd he come back to Chicago?

584
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:02,941
He didn't tell me that, sir.

585
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:07,322
I'm sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but...

586
01:00:11,162 --> 01:00:13,992
You really want to be
his friend and help him?

587
01:00:14,162 --> 01:00:16,332
Help us bring him in unharmed.

588
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:18,042
Why?

589
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:20,672
So he can go back to prison?

590
01:00:23,503 --> 01:00:26,843
If you want help, gentlemen,
you've come to the wrong man.

591
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:29,343
Richard is innocent.

592
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:32,394
You'll never find him. He's too smart.

593
01:00:32,514 --> 01:00:34,854
We're some smart guys.

594
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:40,065
What about us? We're smart. We are.
How smart could he be, really?

595
01:00:40,355 --> 01:00:42,155
Is he as smart as you are?

596
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:44,945
Smarter.

597
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:07,676
Peripheral vascular surgery. Fixing
the arteries as they come out of the heart.

598
01:01:07,756 --> 01:01:11,516
- How long have you known Kimble?
- Ten years. Since I've been here.

599
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:17,977
What kind of medicine did he practice
here at the hospital?

600
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:42,379
I want you to know that
I believe Kimble to be innocent.

601
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:44,639
Would he come to you for help?

602
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:46,719
If he came to me, I would help.

603
01:01:47,389 --> 01:01:48,969
But he wouldn't come to me.

604
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:50,599
That's not his style.

605
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:12,080
A warrant remains outstanding for
Chicago surgeon, Richard Kimble.

606
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:30,853
This is where the one-armed guy
he struggled fell down the stairs.

607
01:02:34,694 --> 01:02:38,064
If I fell down these stairs,
I'd be a goner. I'd be dead.

608
01:02:48,624 --> 01:02:50,124
What a waste!

609
01:02:58,964 --> 01:03:01,674
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

610
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:28,286
Richard.

611
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:24,471
You like stringing out
12-year-old girls, huh?

612
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,311
What are you doing with my baby?

613
01:04:26,391 --> 01:04:28,481
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.

614
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,191
Come on, ma'am.

615
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:33,312
What they doing to my baby?

616
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:03,474
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?

617
01:05:03,644 --> 01:05:05,304
A lot of kids.

618
01:05:05,474 --> 01:05:07,474
They bring them all here?

619
01:05:07,644 --> 01:05:09,644
All coming down here to County.

620
01:05:34,086 --> 01:05:36,086
I've come to do those blinds.

621
01:05:36,346 --> 01:05:37,756
I'll get the door.

622
01:05:48,356 --> 01:05:50,356
I'll start in here, huh?

623
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,204
Let's go over it once more.

624
01:07:22,374 --> 01:07:24,544
What time did he arrive at the house?

625
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,714
About 10:30 in the morning.

626
01:07:28,214 --> 01:07:30,795
- And he was alone?
- Yeah, he was alone.

627
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:33,965
- You got a good look at him?
- Yeah, a real good look.

628
01:07:34,055 --> 01:07:36,095
You better be straight with me.

629
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:40,145
This is the guy staying in
your mother's basement?

630
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:42,305
That's what I'm telling you.

631
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:04,126
I need a doctor over here!

632
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:11,547
Watch the bag! Watch the bag!

633
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:33,199
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.

634
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:04,311
My chest hurts.

635
01:09:08,441 --> 01:09:10,531
Check the film on that kid.

636
01:09:13,412 --> 01:09:14,912
Take a deep breath.

637
01:09:15,162 --> 01:09:17,412
Inhale, exhale. Again.

638
01:09:17,662 --> 01:09:18,832
Slowly.

639
01:09:20,582 --> 01:09:22,162
Check the film.

640
01:09:23,752 --> 01:09:25,002
Take it easy.

641
01:09:29,343 --> 01:09:30,843
What's the status on that kid?

642
01:09:30,923 --> 01:09:32,423
Possible fractured sternum.

643
01:09:32,513 --> 01:09:34,303
Get over here. I need you.

644
01:09:34,843 --> 01:09:38,433
Can you help us?
Bring this kid to Observation Room Two.

645
01:09:39,563 --> 01:09:42,063
Yeah, you. Come on, help us out, okay?

646
01:09:50,824 --> 01:09:52,284
How are you, champ?

647
01:09:52,444 --> 01:09:53,784
My chest hurts.

648
01:09:54,864 --> 01:09:56,624
Does it hurt when you breathe?

649
01:09:56,705 --> 01:09:57,705
Yes.

650
01:10:02,376 --> 01:10:04,546
- What's your name?
- Joel.

651
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,637
Look at this.

652
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,727
We're eating oranges
and we're making IDs.

653
01:10:14,887 --> 01:10:16,937
"C.C.H. " What the hell is that?

654
01:10:17,397 --> 01:10:19,307
Cook County Hospital.

655
01:10:22,647 --> 01:10:24,647
Just hang on, okay?

656
01:10:25,397 --> 01:10:27,158
You'll be okay, pal.

657
01:10:27,318 --> 01:10:28,448
You'll be just fine.

658
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:30,238
Hold that elevator.

659
01:10:30,988 --> 01:10:32,078
Thank you.

660
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:37,498
How're you doing?

661
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:39,248
My chest hurts.

662
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:41,498
Where's your mom, pal?

663
01:10:41,588 --> 01:10:42,748
I don't know.

664
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,758
Is she at home?

665
01:10:44,918 --> 01:10:46,928
I think she's with my brother.

666
01:10:47,088 --> 01:10:48,758
Your brother? They're downstairs?

667
01:10:48,838 --> 01:10:50,258
I don't know.

668
01:10:50,678 --> 01:10:52,258
Don't worry.

669
01:10:52,428 --> 01:10:54,098
We'll find her for you.

670
01:10:55,098 --> 01:10:57,849
What are you?
Football player? Baseball player?

671
01:10:57,939 --> 01:10:59,269
Football.

672
01:11:01,019 --> 01:11:02,359
Hold on, son.

673
01:11:14,201 --> 01:11:15,451
Hey, Doctor.

674
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:18,711
They sent this one from downstairs.

675
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:28,012
Get this one into Room Four, stat.

676
01:11:29,012 --> 01:11:30,342
Bye-bye, Joel.

677
01:11:43,902 --> 01:11:45,902
Where's that boy I sent here?

678
01:11:46,072 --> 01:11:47,742
- What boy?
- The one with the fractured sternum.

679
01:11:47,822 --> 01:11:49,612
He never came through here.

680
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:51,993
He didn't?

681
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:53,333
No, he didn't.

682
01:11:57,004 --> 01:12:00,174
Do you have a particular interest
in our patient's X-rays?

683
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:03,844
- What do you mean?
- I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.

684
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:08,014
- It's a hobby of mine.
- It's a hobby, really?

685
01:12:08,094 --> 01:12:10,515
What's your other hobby, brain surgery?

686
01:12:10,595 --> 01:12:13,185
- What do you want?
- To know how that boy got to surgery.

687
01:12:13,265 --> 01:12:15,435
I'm a janitor. I do as I'm told.

688
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:16,685
That's bullshit!

689
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:18,486
Who changed those orders?

690
01:12:19,356 --> 01:12:21,146
I don't know what you mean.

691
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:26,117
You stay right there.

692
01:12:28,197 --> 01:12:29,707
Call Security!

693
01:12:57,398 --> 01:13:01,818
Tell Stevens to get hold of
that guy Kelly over at C.P.D.

694
01:13:03,568 --> 01:13:08,238
A guy disguised as a janitor orders
an emergency medical procedure...

695
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:11,159
...and all you did was
take away his I.D. card?

696
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:16,079
No, I called Security. He took off down
the hall. What was I supposed to do?

697
01:13:16,169 --> 01:13:17,589
Listen, Mr... .

698
01:13:17,749 --> 01:13:18,919
Deputy.

699
01:13:19,169 --> 01:13:20,419
Gerard.

700
01:13:22,009 --> 01:13:23,430
I'm really tired.

701
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,180
I'd like to go home now.

702
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,180
Okay. How's the boy doing?

703
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,010
He saved his life.

704
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:35,271
Thank you.

705
01:13:40,031 --> 01:13:42,611
"Desmondo, José Ruiz. "

706
01:13:47,242 --> 01:13:48,872
Where're you at, Desmondo?

707
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:53,213
Okay, Sam, this is my problem.

708
01:13:53,793 --> 01:13:56,543
The place is crawling with cops, right?

709
01:13:56,713 --> 01:13:59,043
Everybody's looking for
Richard Kimble, right?

710
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:01,213
So why would a guy be stupid enough...

711
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:03,473
...to hang out in the trauma
ward and play Mother Teresa?

712
01:14:03,553 --> 01:14:04,723
Excuse me.

713
01:14:23,115 --> 01:14:24,865
You, guys, have a problem?

714
01:14:26,155 --> 01:14:28,495
No, no. No problem at all.

715
01:14:34,795 --> 01:14:37,625
Excuse me, could we
have a word with you, please?

716
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:43,845
This is Dr. Elway at Cook County Hospital.

717
01:14:45,386 --> 01:14:50,016
I'm following-up for the prosthetic
clinic on Matthew Zelick.

718
01:14:51,566 --> 01:14:52,897
Oh, he did?

719
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:54,567
I'm terribly sorry.

720
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,867
Right or left?

721
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:01,237
Right.

722
01:15:02,867 --> 01:15:04,907
- Age?
- 35 to 45.

723
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:09,578
This is Ted Riley with
the High School Reunion Committee.

724
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:12,458
25 years are right around the corner...

725
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:15,548
...and Clive is on our list
of missing in action.

726
01:15:16,548 --> 01:15:19,838
The information gave me a number,
but when I tried it...

727
01:15:21,799 --> 01:15:22,929
No kidding.

728
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,269
Armed robbery?

729
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:30,399
He's where?

730
01:15:30,599 --> 01:15:31,689
Point of attachments?

731
01:15:31,769 --> 01:15:32,859
Mid-humerus.

732
01:15:32,939 --> 01:15:35,279
That gives us 47 possibles.

733
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:36,439
47?

734
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:39,950
Cross-check these people
for criminal records.

735
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:40,950
Wait a minute.

736
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,461
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.

737
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:41,934
Driscoll, Clive R.

738
01:16:42,474 --> 01:16:45,644
One-armed man, armed robbery.
That's funny.

739
01:16:46,814 --> 01:16:47,894
Question:

740
01:16:52,735 --> 01:16:54,945
If they can dye this river green today...

741
01:16:55,025 --> 01:16:57,735
...why can't they dye
it blue the other days?

742
01:16:58,325 --> 01:16:59,575
How do I know?

743
01:17:01,865 --> 01:17:04,576
- So, what are you Irish, sir?
- Who, me? No.

744
01:17:04,876 --> 01:17:06,036
Are you?

745
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:07,536
No, man!

746
01:17:18,057 --> 01:17:19,348
Name of inmate?

747
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:21,018
Clive Driscoll.

748
01:17:21,348 --> 01:17:22,728
Driscoll, Clive.

749
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:24,478
I.D., please.

750
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:26,558
Driscoll, Clive R.

751
01:17:26,728 --> 01:17:28,228
2-0-1-0.

752
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:32,859
Be advised that under federal court ruling,
your conversation can be recorded.

753
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,279
Sign here, please!

754
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:38,989
This is hinky. He is a college graduate.
He wouldn't go through all this security...

755
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:43,409
...go to the county lock-up to find
someone his own people say doesn't exist.

756
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:44,539
Hinky.

757
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:46,169
What does that mean, "hinky"?

758
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:47,459
- Strange.
- Weird.

759
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:50,130
Say "strange" or "weird. " "Hinky"
has no meaning.

760
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,710
Why not say "hinky"?

761
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:57,720
I don't want you using meaningless words
around me. I'm taking the stairs.

762
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,720
How about "bullshit"?

763
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:06,101
Visitor for Driscoll.

764
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:08,771
Come on, let's go, let's go.

765
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:13,781
Over there.

766
01:18:36,933 --> 01:18:38,393
Let's go, Driscoll.

767
01:18:44,603 --> 01:18:46,443
You've got five minutes.

768
01:18:47,143 --> 01:18:48,694
Who the hell are you?

769
01:18:49,154 --> 01:18:51,654
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

770
01:18:51,824 --> 01:18:53,534
You got me down here...

771
01:18:53,614 --> 01:18:55,194
...might as well talk.

772
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:58,614
Down here you got no entertainment.
Ain't no cable here.

773
01:19:00,624 --> 01:19:03,455
Listen, pal, I wish I could, but I can't.
Sorry.

774
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:54,719
Richard!

775
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:03,174
There is a man in a blue coat waving
a gun and screaming... at a woman.

776
01:21:03,254 --> 01:21:04,504
Stop that man!

777
01:21:04,584 --> 01:21:06,214
He's a U.S. marshal! Let him go!

778
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:07,754
Let him go!

779
01:21:10,134 --> 01:21:11,514
Close the gates!

780
01:21:26,526 --> 01:21:27,566
Hold it!

781
01:21:46,177 --> 01:21:47,467
Open the doors!

782
01:21:56,597 --> 01:21:58,017
We're on the roof.

783
01:21:58,187 --> 01:21:59,608
We're on the roof.

784
01:21:59,858 --> 01:22:02,568
Take some men! Look down there!

785
01:22:03,278 --> 01:22:04,778
Jesus, he's in the plaza, Sam!

786
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:06,358
He's heading east!

787
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:11,329
He's going east toward the Picasso!

788
01:23:27,695 --> 01:23:30,075
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.

789
01:23:55,726 --> 01:24:00,567
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel that
Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?

790
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,407
I have no idea.

791
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:05,407
We understand your deputies
were at the hospital today.

792
01:24:05,487 --> 01:24:07,407
Was Dr. Kimble at the hospital?

793
01:24:07,487 --> 01:24:09,657
I don't have any comment on that one.

794
01:24:09,747 --> 01:24:11,827
Let me get the chronology straight.

795
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:14,748
The subject was tried,
convicted, incarcerated...

796
01:24:14,998 --> 01:24:19,668
...escaped, presumed dead, and is now
at large in Chicago. Is that correct, sir?

797
01:24:19,838 --> 01:24:22,008
Except for being presumed dead.

798
01:24:22,178 --> 01:24:25,178
Do you believe that Kimble's
armed and dangerous?

799
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:27,388
I believe he's dangerous, yes.

800
01:24:27,508 --> 01:24:31,768
He's taking chances, coming back. Do you
feel that perhaps he might be innocent?

801
01:24:31,848 --> 01:24:36,269
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted
in a court of law. He's guilty.

802
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,439
How will you try to catch him?

803
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:41,189
We have no further comments for now.

804
01:28:26,436 --> 01:28:27,606
Alec.

805
01:28:27,856 --> 01:28:29,186
Richard Kimble.

806
01:28:31,026 --> 01:28:33,236
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, Dr. Kimble.

807
01:28:34,106 --> 01:28:35,196
Lentz!

808
01:28:35,946 --> 01:28:39,367
Sorry, we've been trading phone calls
the last few days.

809
01:29:00,139 --> 01:29:02,639
A cruise sponsored by Devlin MacGregor...

810
01:29:03,229 --> 01:29:04,809
...that could be fun.

811
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:13,070
- Cancún, Richard.
- Sport fishing.

812
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,570
Piña coladas.

813
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,990
What must the hospital buy?
What's the catch?

814
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:18,160
Sailfish.

815
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,870
No, there are no strings attached.

816
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:24,040
So what do you say? So what do you say?

817
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,341
This guy is bleeding from
every needle puncture.

818
01:29:29,501 --> 01:29:32,841
Lentz sent this guy in?
Is he on that wonder drug?

819
01:29:33,011 --> 01:29:36,431
Yes, he's on the RDU-90 protocol, Provasic.

820
01:29:36,591 --> 01:29:38,012
Drug of the future, boys.

821
01:29:38,102 --> 01:29:41,182
Clean out those arteries
and put us out of business.

822
01:29:46,772 --> 01:29:50,112
"Parade Master of Ceremonies
Ed O'Flaherty said...

823
01:29:50,272 --> 01:29:54,113
"...he didn't recall a livelier
parade during the last 20 years.

824
01:29:54,283 --> 01:29:55,613
"That Kimble...

825
01:29:55,703 --> 01:29:57,953
"...is some kind of lad... "

826
01:29:58,203 --> 01:29:59,743
- "Lad? "
- Yeah, "lad. "

827
01:30:02,623 --> 01:30:05,333
Maybe he's a leprechaun.
I'm quoting this guy.

828
01:30:05,373 --> 01:30:07,964
Some guy on line three claims
he's Richard Kimble.

829
01:30:08,044 --> 01:30:10,294
- Who is it?
- We got another Kimble on line three.

830
01:30:10,384 --> 01:30:11,804
Let me see that phone.

831
01:30:11,884 --> 01:30:13,384
Tell him he looks good in a beard.

832
01:30:13,464 --> 01:30:14,884
- What line?
- Three.

833
01:30:14,974 --> 01:30:18,644
"I hope he was able to wear a little green,
sip some whiskey..."

834
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:20,354
This is Gerard.

835
01:30:21,564 --> 01:30:24,274
Do you remember what I told you
in the tunnel?

836
01:30:26,064 --> 01:30:27,564
It's him!

837
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:29,904
I remember it was noisy.

838
01:30:30,154 --> 01:30:32,654
Well, I think you said something like...

839
01:30:32,734 --> 01:30:34,574
...you didn't kill your wife.

840
01:30:34,654 --> 01:30:36,405
Remember what you told me?

841
01:30:36,995 --> 01:30:39,535
I remember you were pointing my gun
at me.

842
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:45,666
You said, "I don't care. "

843
01:30:45,917 --> 01:30:47,627
He's on the south side.

844
01:30:48,257 --> 01:30:50,838
Yeah, Richard, that's right, I don't care.

845
01:30:50,928 --> 01:30:53,348
I'm not trying to solve a puzzle, here.

846
01:30:53,428 --> 01:30:55,518
Well, I am trying to solve a puzzle.

847
01:30:55,598 --> 01:30:57,228
Five seconds to location.

848
01:30:57,308 --> 01:30:59,558
And I just found a big piece.

849
01:31:08,859 --> 01:31:10,109
Hello, Richard?

850
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:12,119
He didn't hang up the phone.

851
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:14,029
Where is he?

852
01:31:14,119 --> 01:31:15,449
256 South St. Lawrence.

853
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:17,869
Get the C.P.D. right the hell over there.

854
01:31:17,949 --> 01:31:20,369
We got a car there now.

855
01:31:49,901 --> 01:31:51,991
Get a couple of shots of that.

856
01:31:55,241 --> 01:31:56,661
Fredrick Sykes...

857
01:31:57,492 --> 01:32:01,002
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.

858
01:32:02,332 --> 01:32:04,042
You want to look at this?

859
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:08,343
Kimble's prints. They're all over...

860
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:10,303
...but mainly on the desk.

861
01:32:10,473 --> 01:32:13,593
He sure had some interest
in these photographs.

862
01:32:13,763 --> 01:32:15,013
Negatives in there?

863
01:32:15,103 --> 01:32:16,513
Let me have them.

864
01:32:16,603 --> 01:32:19,313
- Camera boy's on his way.
- We got you.

865
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:37,914
How're you doing, Mr. Sykes?

866
01:32:37,994 --> 01:32:41,255
- Fine, if you tell me what's happening.
- We had a problem.

867
01:32:41,335 --> 01:32:44,295
- My place or the place upstairs?
- Your place.

868
01:32:45,335 --> 01:32:47,095
Step right in, Mr. Sykes.

869
01:32:47,175 --> 01:32:50,176
Everybody knows my name here.
Big happy family, huh?

870
01:32:50,806 --> 01:32:54,226
What is this, a trench coat convention?
What the hell is going on?

871
01:32:54,306 --> 01:32:56,856
Who are you guys? What's going on?

872
01:33:00,686 --> 01:33:02,856
You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.

873
01:33:03,357 --> 01:33:05,157
I sure hope you're a cop.

874
01:33:05,527 --> 01:33:08,657
No, I'm Samuel Gerard,
United States Marshal's Office.

875
01:33:09,527 --> 01:33:14,208
This morning a fugitive named Richard
Kimble made a phone call from here.

876
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:16,248
Why would he do that?

877
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:18,878
I don't know any Richard Kimble.

878
01:33:25,008 --> 01:33:26,838
Okay, I got it.

879
01:33:27,178 --> 01:33:29,548
The doctor who killed his wife, right?

880
01:33:29,888 --> 01:33:33,889
Keep blaming somebody with
a prosthetic limb. Is he coming after me?

881
01:33:34,059 --> 01:33:35,939
Does he have reason to do so?

882
01:33:36,019 --> 01:33:38,729
I have a prosthetic arm! I must've done it!

883
01:33:39,559 --> 01:33:42,689
Give me a break.
I went through all this a year ago.

884
01:33:42,859 --> 01:33:45,569
I was questioned here
about the whole thing.

885
01:33:45,739 --> 01:33:50,030
I told them I wasn't in Chicago
on that night. I was on business trip.

886
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,830
15 people verified it.

887
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:54,040
What line of business are you in?

888
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:55,500
Security.

889
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:58,130
- Who do you work for?
- A pharmaceutical company.

890
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,130
Which one?

891
01:33:59,210 --> 01:34:02,801
Devlin MacGregor.
I handle security for all the top executives.

892
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:08,801
Do you have any idea why Kimble would
be interested in these photographs?

893
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:10,891
No.

894
01:34:11,601 --> 01:34:13,721
Where were they taken?

895
01:34:13,891 --> 01:34:15,481
Gee, that's a big fish!

896
01:34:15,561 --> 01:34:16,891
Cancún, Mexico.

897
01:34:17,061 --> 01:34:19,941
It was a junket the company
paid for some doctors.

898
01:34:20,111 --> 01:34:23,231
- Kimble go with you?
- You don't see him there, do you?

899
01:34:25,742 --> 01:34:28,452
No. I told you I don't know him.

900
01:34:28,782 --> 01:34:31,833
Do you mind if I look around to see
if anything's missing?

901
01:34:31,913 --> 01:34:33,334
No, I don't mind.

902
01:34:39,254 --> 01:34:40,964
How'd you lose that arm?

903
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:42,794
In the line of duty.

904
01:34:52,975 --> 01:34:55,105
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.

905
01:34:55,435 --> 01:34:57,275
Yes, he is.

906
01:34:57,485 --> 01:35:00,655
- You want our people on him?
- Yes. Build a camp here.

907
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:02,526
I'll take care of it.

908
01:35:03,486 --> 01:35:07,786
See this picture? I want you to find
out who's the guy next to Sykes.

909
01:35:08,156 --> 01:35:11,706
Find out his name, his age, his weight,
his social security number...

910
01:35:11,786 --> 01:35:15,546
...his location, relatives, pets, everything.

911
01:35:35,517 --> 01:35:38,608
I am so sorry, Doctor,
they said it was an emergency.

912
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:43,158
Thank you. Excuse me.

913
01:35:55,539 --> 01:35:56,839
Mr. Bolton.

914
01:35:56,999 --> 01:35:58,009
Chuck.

915
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,209
Richard.

916
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:00,630
Yeah, can you talk?

917
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,720
Yes, I'm on a hotel phone.
So how are you? What's going on?

918
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:08,720
I found him, Chuck.
I found the man who killed Helen.

919
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,440
- What?
- It was me they were after.

920
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,730
Who are they?

921
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:17,730
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.

922
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:21,240
Lentz was supervising
the protocol for RDU-90.

923
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,990
He knew I found out it was causing liver
damage. It was Lentz.

924
01:36:26,581 --> 01:36:29,291
Richard, Lentz is dead.

925
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:32,162
What? How?

926
01:36:32,252 --> 01:36:35,042
He died in a car accident last summer.

927
01:36:39,882 --> 01:36:42,012
Can you prove this about the drug?

928
01:36:42,722 --> 01:36:44,132
Yeah, I think so.

929
01:36:45,393 --> 01:36:47,103
I need your help, Chuck.

930
01:36:47,393 --> 01:36:51,353
Call Bones at the hospital.
Tell him to give me whatever help I need.

931
01:36:52,274 --> 01:36:53,524
I'll call him now.

932
01:36:53,604 --> 01:36:55,104
Okay. Thanks.

933
01:37:05,115 --> 01:37:06,455
Dr. Nichols!

934
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:09,285
Can we ask you a few more questions?

935
01:37:09,455 --> 01:37:10,955
Mr. Gerard.

936
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,625
You got a copy of that photograph?

937
01:37:13,965 --> 01:37:15,375
U.S. Marshal Service.

938
01:37:15,465 --> 01:37:16,795
Excuse us.

939
01:37:19,925 --> 01:37:21,595
This is Fredrick Sykes.

940
01:37:21,765 --> 01:37:25,765
He's a security specialist at
Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

941
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:28,355
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.

942
01:37:28,435 --> 01:37:29,896
Do you know this man?

943
01:37:29,976 --> 01:37:31,526
No, I don't know him.

944
01:37:33,106 --> 01:37:36,236
You're getting pretty desperate,
aren't you, Mr. Gerard?

945
01:37:36,316 --> 01:37:37,776
Oh, yeah.

946
01:37:38,446 --> 01:37:40,526
I told you, you wouldn't find Richard.

947
01:37:40,616 --> 01:37:42,536
- Has he been to see you?
- No.

948
01:37:44,657 --> 01:37:47,617
We've been over this
ground before, haven't we?

949
01:37:50,127 --> 01:37:52,337
- So, if you'll excuse me.
- Sure.

950
01:37:54,507 --> 01:37:56,547
- Thanks, Doc.
- Thank you, Doctor.

951
01:37:58,468 --> 01:38:01,888
Sorry, I want to ask you
one more question about the photograph.

952
01:38:01,968 --> 01:38:04,928
See the guy standing on
the right side of the fish?

953
01:38:05,018 --> 01:38:06,519
Ever see him before?

954
01:38:06,849 --> 01:38:08,649
This guy right here?

955
01:38:09,189 --> 01:38:11,899
I've never seen that person
in my life before.

956
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:13,899
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

957
01:38:13,979 --> 01:38:15,149
Thank you.

958
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:18,859
Thank you, Doctor.
Enjoy the rest of the convention.

959
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:28,541
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-Invasive
Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.

960
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:31,041
"Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols. "

961
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:33,341
Bet they line up to hear this one.

962
01:38:49,522 --> 01:38:51,902
If you were Richard Kimble...

963
01:38:52,232 --> 01:38:55,982
...why would you hunt for a one-armed
man you say killed your wife...

964
01:38:56,072 --> 01:38:59,573
...break into his house,
call us up and then split?

965
01:39:00,073 --> 01:39:01,993
I should have been a doctor.

966
01:39:02,243 --> 01:39:06,333
Look at this blow-up. This guy in
the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.

967
01:39:06,623 --> 01:39:07,793
Chicago Memorial.

968
01:39:07,873 --> 01:39:09,083
I want to go there.

969
01:39:09,163 --> 01:39:10,253
Go!

970
01:39:10,673 --> 01:39:11,833
Wait.

971
01:39:15,093 --> 01:39:16,763
Devlin MacGregor...

972
01:39:17,013 --> 01:39:20,684
...did 7 1/2 billion dollars in net sales...

973
01:39:21,684 --> 01:39:23,434
...last year alone.

974
01:39:25,184 --> 01:39:27,185
That company is a monster.

975
01:39:35,695 --> 01:39:37,115
Yeah, talk to me.

976
01:39:41,456 --> 01:39:42,866
Absolutely.

977
01:39:44,036 --> 01:39:45,536
It's a liver sample...

978
01:39:45,626 --> 01:39:48,456
...from a patient on the RDU-90 drug study.

979
01:39:48,626 --> 01:39:50,466
21. January 21st?

980
01:39:52,216 --> 01:39:54,046
The last one!

981
01:39:54,636 --> 01:39:55,966
1-7-4-3-0?

982
01:39:56,136 --> 01:39:58,467
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.

983
01:39:59,887 --> 01:40:03,057
Thanks. I'll make sure
all this stuff gets back to you.

984
01:40:07,567 --> 01:40:10,067
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

985
01:40:10,147 --> 01:40:13,067
So whatever happened to that thing
with your wife?

986
01:40:15,658 --> 01:40:17,328
It's not over yet.

987
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:39,430
What's going on?

988
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:41,351
How should I know?

989
01:40:54,451 --> 01:40:57,952
I think his name is Lentz. A pathologist.

990
01:40:58,702 --> 01:41:01,082
I remember because he died last summer.

991
01:41:09,882 --> 01:41:11,882
Oh, my God. Richard!

992
01:41:12,382 --> 01:41:14,382
What are you doing here?

993
01:41:14,722 --> 01:41:16,052
Hi, Kath.

994
01:41:31,573 --> 01:41:32,903
Have a look.

995
01:41:35,153 --> 01:41:37,573
- What do you think?
- Cold normal.

996
01:41:37,743 --> 01:41:39,994
Clearly not the same tissue.

997
01:41:40,164 --> 01:41:43,834
And not only did they all
come from healthy livers...

998
01:41:44,334 --> 01:41:46,624
...they all came from the same liver.

999
01:41:48,505 --> 01:41:50,175
Kath, you beauty.

1000
01:41:56,596 --> 01:41:57,846
Excuse me.

1001
01:41:58,596 --> 01:42:00,016
Mr. Roosevelt?

1002
01:42:01,356 --> 01:42:04,936
I am Deputy Biggs, this is
Deputy Newman. We're U.S. marshals.

1003
01:42:05,026 --> 01:42:08,607
Need some information about a
Dr. Lentz who was on staff here.

1004
01:42:08,777 --> 01:42:13,367
I want to know if he knew or have had
any contact with a Dr. Richard Kimble?

1005
01:42:13,697 --> 01:42:15,617
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.

1006
01:42:16,787 --> 01:42:18,207
I didn't ask that.

1007
01:42:19,287 --> 01:42:20,787
I wouldn't know.

1008
01:42:21,127 --> 01:42:24,958
If you'll excuse me,
I have prior obligations to attend to.

1009
01:42:27,968 --> 01:42:29,758
I think you're lying to us.

1010
01:42:31,138 --> 01:42:33,138
You think Lentz is the bad guy?

1011
01:42:34,218 --> 01:42:35,718
Yeah, why not?

1012
01:42:37,308 --> 01:42:40,899
He was one of the original
patent boys in RDU-90.

1013
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:44,519
I was sending in my tissue samples...

1014
01:42:45,069 --> 01:42:48,899
...he was replacing them with healthy
samples, issuing the path reports...

1015
01:42:48,989 --> 01:42:50,909
...shit-canning my stuff. Easy.

1016
01:42:50,989 --> 01:42:52,239
Wait a minute.

1017
01:42:52,569 --> 01:42:54,990
Lentz died August 21st.

1018
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:01,501
Half the samples he approved
were signed the day he died.

1019
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:04,131
You're kidding.

1020
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:08,761
Someone else must have
been manipulating this.

1021
01:43:09,421 --> 01:43:10,931
Someone with access.

1022
01:43:22,601 --> 01:43:23,862
Thanks, Kath.

1023
01:43:24,272 --> 01:43:25,732
Where're you going?

1024
01:43:27,112 --> 01:43:28,532
To see a friend.

1025
01:43:33,872 --> 01:43:35,782
This is giving me a headache.

1026
01:43:36,122 --> 01:43:39,963
That's surprising. Where did
Roosevelt say Kimble was going?

1027
01:43:40,123 --> 01:43:42,293
He says he doesn't know.

1028
01:43:42,713 --> 01:43:44,633
- Do you believe him?
- Yes, I do.

1029
01:43:44,713 --> 01:43:47,463
He says he was here to pick up
some tissue samples...

1030
01:43:47,553 --> 01:43:49,053
...for a drug study.

1031
01:43:49,213 --> 01:43:50,763
But listen, get this.

1032
01:43:50,883 --> 01:43:53,974
The release was approved
by Dr. Charles Nichols.

1033
01:43:54,724 --> 01:43:57,434
Nichols also knew Lentz.

1034
01:43:58,224 --> 01:43:59,734
He was Lentz's boss.

1035
01:43:59,814 --> 01:44:01,395
He was covering for Kimble.

1036
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:03,405
Send the C.P.D. over there right now.

1037
01:44:03,485 --> 01:44:07,905
We're going to send a bunch of cops.
Make sure they turn that place inside out.

1038
01:44:07,985 --> 01:44:11,655
Don't let them give you shit
about your ponytail either. Well done.

1039
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,165
My pleasure, Sam.

1040
01:44:15,996 --> 01:44:17,916
Dr. Nichols lied to me.

1041
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:20,086
- Go find him.
- I'm on it.

1042
01:44:27,927 --> 01:44:29,427
He's gone by now.

1043
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:33,097
I looked every place you told me
to look and I didn't see him.

1044
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,517
I'm telling you.

1045
01:44:34,597 --> 01:44:37,608
If he was in the hospital,
I would have found him.

1046
01:44:37,858 --> 01:44:39,778
So what do you want me to do?

1047
01:44:40,778 --> 01:44:42,608
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1048
01:44:42,858 --> 01:44:45,358
I marked him. I got him now.

1049
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:16,559
Dr. Alexander Lentz.

1050
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:20,149
"A noted pathologist at
Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1051
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:23,990
"...was walking to his daily tennis
match when an unidentified vehicle...

1052
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:25,570
"...slammed his body...

1053
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:29,491
"...into the barriers that separate
the Drive from Lake Michigan. "

1054
01:45:32,161 --> 01:45:34,251
Sam, you're not going to believe this.

1055
01:45:34,331 --> 01:45:37,832
Sykes' records for the past two
years show no calls to Kimble.

1056
01:45:38,172 --> 01:45:39,332
It was a thought.

1057
01:45:39,422 --> 01:45:43,092
But when I cross-checked
Kimble's phone records, one came up.

1058
01:45:43,262 --> 01:45:44,882
Kimble called Sykes...

1059
01:45:46,932 --> 01:45:48,432
Get Sykes in here now.

1060
01:45:48,512 --> 01:45:50,263
...on the night of the murder...

1061
01:45:50,353 --> 01:45:51,763
...7:30 P. M...

1062
01:45:51,933 --> 01:45:53,433
...from his car phone.

1063
01:45:53,523 --> 01:45:56,024
Do you have the arrest report on Kimble?

1064
01:46:01,944 --> 01:46:03,614
- 7:30 P.M.
- 19:30 hours.

1065
01:46:05,614 --> 01:46:07,954
They just went in. Sykes is gone.

1066
01:46:08,114 --> 01:46:09,874
He's nowhere to be found.

1067
01:46:10,454 --> 01:46:11,784
He's gone.

1068
01:47:16,268 --> 01:47:21,109
Possible sighting of Richard Kimble on
northbound El coming into Van Buren.

1069
01:47:27,449 --> 01:47:29,369
Move to the door, Doc.

1070
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,550
This is my stop.

1071
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:45,640
This is my stop too.

1072
01:48:45,915 --> 01:48:47,496
You missed your stop.

1073
01:49:10,517 --> 01:49:14,277
A transit cop spotted Kimble on the El,
he is heading toward Balbo.

1074
01:49:14,357 --> 01:49:16,698
The C.P.D. is on the way.

1075
01:49:51,731 --> 01:49:56,401
Attention all units. Transit police
report officer down at Balbo Station.

1076
01:49:56,741 --> 01:49:59,241
Kimble is suspect. Repeat officer down.

1077
01:49:59,611 --> 01:50:01,161
What'd he do, shoot a cop?

1078
01:50:01,241 --> 01:50:03,331
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.

1079
01:50:10,671 --> 01:50:14,631
It is a joy and a privilege...
to introduce tonight's keynote speaker.

1080
01:50:25,273 --> 01:50:27,103
For the past four years...

1081
01:50:27,273 --> 01:50:30,604
...he has served as
the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...

1082
01:50:30,774 --> 01:50:33,944
...and Administrative Chief of Pathology...

1083
01:50:34,114 --> 01:50:36,534
...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.

1084
01:50:41,164 --> 01:50:43,534
Where are the emergency exits?

1085
01:50:44,534 --> 01:50:48,625
Suspect seen entering Hilton Tower Mall,
lower level. Repeat...

1086
01:50:49,415 --> 01:50:50,545
You don't think...

1087
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:52,295
I know where he's going.

1088
01:50:54,135 --> 01:50:56,095
Biggs, Newman, where are you?

1089
01:50:57,425 --> 01:51:00,475
He was appointed to
the Board of Directors...

1090
01:51:00,555 --> 01:51:02,975
...of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

1091
01:51:03,185 --> 01:51:05,475
You all please give a warm welcome...

1092
01:51:05,685 --> 01:51:07,855
...to Dr. Charles Nichols.

1093
01:51:14,365 --> 01:51:16,986
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen...

1094
01:51:17,076 --> 01:51:19,076
...my friends and colleagues.

1095
01:51:19,576 --> 01:51:21,826
It's great you're all here tonight.

1096
01:51:34,588 --> 01:51:38,179
C.P.D. reported an officer
down and a guy with two guns...

1097
01:51:38,349 --> 01:51:40,429
- Kimble do it?
- Conflicting reports.

1098
01:51:40,519 --> 01:51:42,439
He entered the hotel from the subway.

1099
01:51:42,519 --> 01:51:44,270
- That's my man!
- Not anymore.

1100
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:46,610
He's going down.
You can help by staying out.

1101
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:48,020
Arrest us!

1102
01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:50,530
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.

1103
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,820
All units report when lower level is secure.

1104
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,870
All units, secure all lower level exits.

1105
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:05,880
Go and find the hotel security office.
Stay in touch with me on the radio.

1106
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:10,130
Now, a new drug...

1107
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:14,381
...on the cusp of approval
by the Food and Drug Administration...

1108
01:52:14,551 --> 01:52:18,511
...is poised to change
these old methods forever.

1109
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:21,771
Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.

1110
01:52:23,141 --> 01:52:24,641
Sam, I'm in.

1111
01:52:28,401 --> 01:52:32,072
...through the normal metabolic
pathways in the liver.

1112
01:52:33,242 --> 01:52:35,412
The drug's name is...

1113
01:52:35,572 --> 01:52:36,952
...Provasic.

1114
01:52:38,452 --> 01:52:40,662
As I will show you tonight...

1115
01:52:40,792 --> 01:52:43,663
...Provasic is remarkably effective...

1116
01:52:43,793 --> 01:52:46,963
...and has no side effects whatsoever.

1117
01:52:47,253 --> 01:52:49,963
It is also noteworthy that this drug...

1118
01:52:55,184 --> 01:52:57,394
...that this drug was developed...

1119
01:52:57,554 --> 01:53:00,894
...in cooperation, not competition
with Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1120
01:53:00,974 --> 01:53:02,814
...in what we hope will be...

1121
01:53:02,894 --> 01:53:05,734
...the model for a continued dishonest...

1122
01:53:06,484 --> 01:53:08,194
...excuse me, honest...

1123
01:53:11,734 --> 01:53:13,155
...open joint venture...

1124
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,745
...between academic medicine...

1125
01:53:15,905 --> 01:53:18,125
...and the pharmaceutical industry...

1126
01:53:18,205 --> 01:53:19,495
Richard!

1127
01:53:20,915 --> 01:53:24,335
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of this speech.

1128
01:53:24,835 --> 01:53:26,755
You almost got away with it.

1129
01:53:29,217 --> 01:53:30,757
I know all about it.

1130
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:33,927
I can prove it.

1131
01:53:35,427 --> 01:53:39,347
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend
Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...

1132
01:53:39,597 --> 01:53:41,017
...obviously...

1133
01:53:41,437 --> 01:53:44,778
...so if you just go on
with your dessert and coffee...

1134
01:53:45,028 --> 01:53:48,528
Richard, would you step aside
and let's talk.

1135
01:53:50,278 --> 01:53:53,368
So I'll be back in just a second.

1136
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:59,618
You changed the samples, didn't you?

1137
01:54:01,378 --> 01:54:03,748
You switched the samples...

1138
01:54:03,878 --> 01:54:05,549
...after Lentz died.

1139
01:54:07,379 --> 01:54:09,799
Let's stay calm, people.

1140
01:54:11,259 --> 01:54:14,640
After Lentz died, you were
the only one who had access.

1141
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:17,890
You switched the samples...

1142
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:20,650
...and the pathology reports.

1143
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:22,310
You killed Lentz too?

1144
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,770
Call Security.

1145
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:24,980
Did you?

1146
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:28,401
He falsified his research...

1147
01:54:29,781 --> 01:54:32,161
...so RDU-90 could be...

1148
01:54:32,321 --> 01:54:33,741
...approved and...

1149
01:54:33,911 --> 01:54:37,081
...Devlin MacGregor
could give you Provasic.

1150
01:54:39,291 --> 01:54:40,751
All right, it's all over, folks.

1151
01:54:40,831 --> 01:54:42,462
Let's just stay calm.

1152
01:54:58,932 --> 01:55:02,062
You never give up, Richard, do you?
You never give up!

1153
01:55:25,135 --> 01:55:26,346
Why Helen?

1154
01:55:29,216 --> 01:55:30,306
Glad you're here.

1155
01:55:30,386 --> 01:55:31,886
Which way'd they go?

1156
01:55:31,976 --> 01:55:34,056
- Toward the Presidential Suite.
- Where's that?

1157
01:55:34,146 --> 01:55:37,066
- Southeast corner.
- How many exits are there in this room?

1158
01:55:37,146 --> 01:55:40,487
We got a total of four:
Two on the east, two on the west.

1159
01:55:41,737 --> 01:55:43,277
Kimble's on the roof!

1160
01:55:43,657 --> 01:55:45,237
Cosmo, that way.

1161
01:55:57,997 --> 01:56:00,257
Stop! Stay where you are!

1162
01:56:00,417 --> 01:56:02,257
This is the Chicago police!

1163
01:56:02,917 --> 01:56:04,927
Put your hands in the air!

1164
01:56:05,087 --> 01:56:07,387
The building is totally secure.

1165
01:56:07,677 --> 01:56:10,098
I repeat, do not move!

1166
01:56:11,018 --> 01:56:12,768
Put your hands in the air!

1167
01:56:14,388 --> 01:56:16,348
I repeat, stay where you are!

1168
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:40,801
Talk to me.

1169
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:43,671
They're headed to the
north end of the roof.

1170
01:56:43,801 --> 01:56:44,971
Newman!

1171
01:56:45,971 --> 01:56:48,051
Get that helicopter out of here!

1172
01:56:51,811 --> 01:56:53,931
As soon as you get a clean shot...

1173
01:56:54,061 --> 01:56:55,731
...you take him out.

1174
01:57:13,952 --> 01:57:16,003
Newman, get rid of the helicopter!

1175
01:57:16,083 --> 01:57:18,463
- Why?
- Because I don't want to get shot!

1176
01:57:18,583 --> 01:57:22,593
C.P.D., there's a U.S. marshal
out on the roof. Hold your fire!

1177
01:57:22,843 --> 01:57:25,174
Call off the helicopter!

1178
01:58:12,727 --> 01:58:14,067
Don't shoot.

1179
01:58:17,397 --> 01:58:19,237
This guy ever quit?

1180
01:58:19,397 --> 01:58:21,567
Find out where that elevator stops.

1181
01:58:22,908 --> 01:58:25,288
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?

1182
01:58:25,368 --> 01:58:27,658
Where did they go? Where did they go?

1183
01:58:58,189 --> 01:59:00,200
- Stopped on the 5th floor.
- They're on the 5th floor.

1184
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:02,910
- What's on the 5th floor?
- It's the laundry.

1185
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:06,370
They stopped at the laundry.

1186
01:59:50,254 --> 01:59:53,254
We're on the 5th floor. What's your 20?

1187
01:59:54,334 --> 01:59:55,834
It's right behind you.

1188
01:59:55,924 --> 01:59:57,924
What the hell is going on here?

1189
01:59:58,174 --> 02:00:01,424
You got to keep the C.P.D. out.
They're much too hot to suit me.

1190
02:00:01,514 --> 02:00:03,684
I want you to get rid of all these people.

1191
02:00:03,764 --> 02:00:05,184
Okay, people, stay calm.

1192
02:00:05,264 --> 02:00:06,935
Cosmo, come with me.

1193
02:01:28,272 --> 02:01:30,812
Dr. Richard Kimble!

1194
02:01:31,612 --> 02:01:33,822
There's no way out of here, Richard!

1195
02:01:35,193 --> 02:01:37,903
The entire building is locked down!

1196
02:01:40,533 --> 02:01:42,703
Give it up, you don't have any time!

1197
02:01:42,783 --> 02:01:45,873
Chicago Police Department thinks
you're a cop killer!

1198
02:01:46,793 --> 02:01:49,373
They will shoot you on sight!

1199
02:01:53,043 --> 02:01:55,133
Richard, I know you're innocent!

1200
02:01:56,553 --> 02:01:58,973
I know about Fredrick Sykes!

1201
02:02:01,643 --> 02:02:04,474
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!

1202
02:02:06,394 --> 02:02:09,814
Richard, he borrowed your car
the night of your wife's murder!

1203
02:02:09,904 --> 02:02:11,564
He had the keys!

1204
02:02:11,734 --> 02:02:13,734
No forced entry, Richard.

1205
02:02:14,984 --> 02:02:17,904
He telephoned Sykes
from your car, Richard!

1206
02:02:25,495 --> 02:02:27,255
Give it up!

1207
02:02:29,585 --> 02:02:32,585
I'm either lying to you or
I'm going to shoot you!

1208
02:02:33,756 --> 02:02:35,256
What do you think?

1209
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:57,948
Give it up! It's time to stop running!

1210
02:03:38,621 --> 02:03:40,411
They killed my wife.

1211
02:03:41,251 --> 02:03:42,711
I know it, Richard.

1212
02:03:44,251 --> 02:03:45,461
I know it.

1213
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:48,961
But, it's over now.

1214
02:03:51,761 --> 02:03:53,761
You know, I'm glad.

1215
02:03:53,931 --> 02:03:55,592
I need the rest.

1216
02:04:10,283 --> 02:04:12,153
Who killed Kimble's wife?

1217
02:04:12,363 --> 02:04:14,283
Kimble was convicted of it.

1218
02:04:14,453 --> 02:04:17,164
You've got a one-armed man in custody.

1219
02:04:17,374 --> 02:04:19,414
- Is that the guy?
- I have no idea.

1220
02:04:19,494 --> 02:04:21,294
How many one-armed men are there?

1221
02:04:21,374 --> 02:04:23,084
There're a lot of them.

1222
02:04:23,164 --> 02:04:25,174
Could you have made a mistake?

1223
02:04:32,965 --> 02:04:35,555
You got a deadline, play the weather again.

1224
02:04:35,885 --> 02:04:40,315
Tell Samuel Gerard I'm going home now.
I'm taking my vacation.

1225
02:04:43,525 --> 02:04:45,895
Clear this area. Everybody clear.

1226
02:05:03,547 --> 02:05:04,917
Watch your head.

1227
02:05:16,059 --> 02:05:17,939
Where is that thing?

1228
02:05:18,519 --> 02:05:20,519
Let me see those hands, Doctor.

1229
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:40,630
I thought you didn't care.

1230
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:41,960
I don't.

1231
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,760
Don't tell anybody, okay?
