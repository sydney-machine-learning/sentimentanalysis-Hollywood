1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,700
Thebes, City of the Living...

2
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,200
crown jewel
of Pharaoh Seti the First...

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
home of lmhotep,
Pharaoh's high priest...

4
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,000
keeper of the dead...

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,600
birthplace of Anck-su-namun,
Pharaoh's mistress.

6
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
No other man
was allowed to touch her.

7
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,100
But for their love,
they were willing to risk life itself.

8
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,300
To resurrect Anck-su-namun...

9
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,600
lmhotep and his priests
broke into her crypt and stole her body.

10
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,700
They raced deep into the desert...

11
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,100
taking Anck-su-namun's corpse
to Hamunaptra, City of the Dead...

12
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,000
ancient burial site
for the sons of pharaohs...

13
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,800
and resting place
for the wealth of Egypt.

14
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,600
For his love, lmhotep dared the gods'
anger by going deep into the city...

15
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,400
where he took the black Book of the Dead
from its holy resting place.

16
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,900
Anck-su-namun's soul had been sent
to the dark underworld...

17
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,000
her vital organs removed and placed
in five sacred canopic jars.

18
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,700
Anck-su-namun's soul
had come back from the dead.

19
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
But Pharaoh's bodyguards
had followed lmhotep and stopped him...

20
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,500
But Pharaoh's bodyguards
had followed lmhotep and stopped him...

21
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
before the ritual
could be completed.

22
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,600
lmhotep's priests were condemned
to be mummified alive.

23
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,300
As for lmhotep...

24
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,900
he was condemned to endure
the Hom-Dai...

25
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,500
the worst
of all ancient curses...

26
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,900
one so horrible
it had never before been bestowed.

27
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,300
He was to remain sealed
inside his sarcophagus--

28
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,100
the undead
for all of eternity.

29
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,000
The Magi would never
allow him to be released...

30
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,100
for he would arise a walking disease,
a plague upon mankind...

31
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,200
an unholy flesh eater
with the strength of ages...

32
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
power over the sands...

33
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,600
and the glory
of invincibility.

34
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,800
For 3,000 years,
men and armies fought over this land...

35
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,400
never knowing
what evil lay beneath it.

36
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And for 3,000 years...

37
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,600
we, the Magi, the descendants of
Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards, kept watch.

38
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,600
You just got promoted.

39
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,300
Prenez vos positions!

40
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Steady!

41
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
You're with me
on this one, right?

42
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,100
Oh. Your strength
gives me strength.

43
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,800
Steady!

44
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,400
Wait! Wait for me!

45
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,800
Steady!

46
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,000
Fire!

47
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Run, Beni! Run!

48
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,400
Get inside!
Get inside!

49
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,300
Hey! Don't you close that door!

50
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,600
Don't you close that door!

51
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,200
''Sacred Stones.''

52
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,000
''Sculpture and Aesthetics.''

53
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,900
Socrates, Seth,
volume one, volume two...

54
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,400
and volume three.

55
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,700
And T--

56
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,000
Tuthmosis?
What are you doing here?

57
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
''T.''
''T,'' ''T,'' ''T,'' ''T.''

58
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,400
''T.''

59
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,000
l'm going
to put you where you belong.

60
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,900
Help. Ooh.

61
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Whoa!

62
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,900
Oops.

63
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,300
What--
How c-- l--

64
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,300
H-How--

65
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,800
Oh, look at this!

66
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,800
Sons of the pharaohs!

67
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Give me frogs!
Flies! Locusts!

68
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,600
Anything but you!

69
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,500
Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

70
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,600
l am so very sorry.
lt was an accident.

71
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,300
My girl, when Rameses destroyed Syria,
that was an accident.

72
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,300
You...
are a catastrophe!

73
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,700
Look at my library!

74
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,300
Why do l put up with you?

75
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,300
W-Well, you put up with me
because l can--

76
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
l can read and write
ancient Egyptian...

77
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,400
and l can-- l can decipher
hieroglyphics and hieratic...

78
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,000
and, w-well, l am the only person
within a thousand miles...

79
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,300
who knows how to properly code
and catalog this library, that's why.

80
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,900
l put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

81
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,700
That's why!

82
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,200
Allah rest their souls.

83
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,700
Now, l don't care how you do it,
l don't care how long it takes.

84
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Straighten up
this meshiver!

85
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Hello?

86
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
Abdul?

87
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Mohammed?

88
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Bob?

89
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Have you no respect
for the dead?

90
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,000
Of course l do!

91
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,400
But sometimes
l'd rather like to join them.

92
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,500
Well, l wish you would do it
before you ruin my career
the way you've ruined yours.

93
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,000
Now get out!

94
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,000
My dear, sweet
baby sister...

95
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,900
l'll have you... know...

96
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,200
that at this precise moment
my career is on a high note.

97
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,500
''High note.'' Ha! Jonathan, please,
l'm really not in the mood for you.

98
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,300
l've just made a bit of a mess
in the library...

99
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,200
and the Bembridge scholars have
rejected my application form again.

100
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
They say l don't have
enough experience in the field.

101
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,600
You'll always have me,
old mum.

102
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,400
Besides, l have just the thing
to cheer you up.

103
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,900
Oh, no, Jonathan,
not another worthless trinket.

104
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
lf l have to take one more piece
of junk to the curator to try and...

105
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,700
sell for you--

106
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Where did you get this?

107
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,900
On a dig down in Thebes.

108
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,900
My whole life l've never
found anything, Evy.

109
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,800
Please tell me
l've found something.

110
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,300
Jonathan.

111
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,500
Yes?

112
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,600
l think you've found something.

113
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
You see the cartouche there.

114
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,400
lt's the official royal seal
of Seti the First, l'm sure of it.

115
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,300
- Perhaps.
- Two questions.

116
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,200
Who the hell was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

117
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty...

118
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
said to be the wealthiest pharaoh
of them all.

119
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,000
Good. l like this fellow.

120
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,100
- l like him very much.
- l've already dated the map.

121
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,000
lt's almost 3,000 years old.

122
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,200
And if you look at
the hieratic just here...

123
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
well, it's Hamunaptra.

124
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,900
Dear God,
don't be ridiculous.

125
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,200
We're scholars,
not treasure hunters.

126
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,100
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers...

127
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,000
to amuse Greek
and Roman tourists.

128
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,800
l know all the blather
about the city being protected
by the curse of a mummy...

129
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,700
but my research
has led me to believe...

130
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,100
that the city itself
may have actually existed.

131
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,100
Are we talking about
the Hamunaptra?

132
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes. The City of the Dead.

133
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,000
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.

134
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,800
Yes, yes, i-i-in a big,
underground treasure chamber.

135
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,800
- Heh!
- Oh, come on.
Everybody knows the story.

136
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,300
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command.

137
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,100
The place would disappear beneath the
sand dunes, taking the treasure with it.

138
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,200
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum--

139
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,600
Oh, my goodness!
Look at that!

140
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,000
You've burnt it! You've burned off
the part with the lost city.

141
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
lt's for the best,
l'm sure.

142
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,800
Many men
have wasted their lives...

143
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,100
in the foolish pursuit
of Hamunaptra.

144
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,600
No one's ever found it.

145
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
Most...
have never returned.

146
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,900
Come, come!
Step over the threshold.

147
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,300
Welcome to Cairo Prison,
my humble home.

148
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,200
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

149
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,000
- Well, l was mistaken.
- You lied.

150
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,500
l lie to everybody.
What makes you so special?

151
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,900
- l am your sister.
- That just makes you more gullible.

152
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,700
- You stole it from a drunk
at the local casbah.
- Picked his pocket, actually.

153
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,500
- So l don't think it's a very good--
- Stop being so ridiculous.

154
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,500
-What exactly is this man in prison for?
-This l do not know.

155
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
But when l heard that you were coming,
l asked him that myself.

156
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
And what did he say?

157
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,500
He said he was just looking
for a good time.

158
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,500
-This is the man that you stole it from?
-Yes, exactly.

159
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
- So why don't we just go
sniff out a spot of tiffin--
- Who are you?

160
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
- And who's the broad?
- ''Broad''?

161
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,200
l-l'm just a local sort of missionary
chap, spreading the good word.

162
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,800
- But this is my sister Evy.
- How do you do?

163
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,500
- Oh, well.
Guess she's not a total loss.
- l beg your pardon.

164
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,900
l'll be back in a moment.

165
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Ask him about the box.

166
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Um, we have found--
Uh, hello. Excuse me.

167
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,000
We both found
your puzzle box...

168
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,600
and we've come
to ask you about it.

169
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,500
- No.
- No.

170
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,600
No. You came to ask me
about Hamunaptra.

171
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,600
- Shh. Shh.
- H-How do you know the box
pertains to Hamunaptra?

172
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,900
Because that's where l was
when l found it. l was there.

173
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,800
But how do we know
that's not a load of pig's wallow?

174
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,300
Do l know you?

175
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,800
No, no. l've just got
one of those faces.

176
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,400
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

177
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,600
Yeah, l was there.

178
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,700
- You swear?
- Every damn day.

179
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,600
- l didn't mean that--
- l know. l was there.

180
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Seti's place.
City of the Dead.

181
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,900
Could you tell me how to get there?

182
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,100
l mean, the exact location.

183
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,600
- You want to know?
- W-Well, yes.

184
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

185
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,600
Then get me
the hell out of here!

186
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Do it, lady!

187
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,000
Where are they taking him?

188
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,900
To be hanged.

189
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Apparently he had
a very good time.

190
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,800
l will give you 100 pounds
to save this man's life.

191
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,600
Madame, l would pay 100 pounds
just to see him hang.

192
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
- Two hundred pounds!
- Proceed!

193
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Three hundred pounds!

194
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,100
Any last requests, pig?

195
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Yeah. Loosen the knot
and let me go.

196
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Yahemar!
Of course we don't let him go!

197
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,900
Five hundred pounds!

198
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400
And what else?

199
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
l'm a very lonely man.

200
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
- Yalla tlak!
- No!

201
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,500
Ha ha!
His neck did not break!

202
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,900
Oh, l'm so sorry. Now we must
watch him strangle to death.

203
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
He knows the location
to Hamunaptra.

204
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,000
- You lie.
- l would never!

205
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,600
Are you telling me this filthy,
godless son of a pig knows where
to find the City of the Dead?

206
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,400
- Yes!
- Truly?

207
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,600
Yes! And if you cut him down,
we will give you--

208
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
- Ten percent.
- Fifty percent.

209
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,100
- Twenty.
- Forty.

210
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,100
- Thirty!
- Twenty-five.

211
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,400
Ah! Deal.

212
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
Ahh! Cut him down!

213
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,800
Do you really think
he's going to show up?

214
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,600
Yes, undoubtedly,
knowing my luck.

215
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,100
He may be a cowboy, but l know
the breed. His word is his word.

216
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,900
Well, personally l think he's filthy,
rude, a complete scoundrel.

217
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,300
- l don't like him one bit.
- Anyone l know?

218
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,000
Um, hello.

219
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,100
Smashing day for the start
of an adventure, eh, O'Connell?

220
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,300
Yeah. Yeah, smashing.

221
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,500
Oh, no, no, l'd never steal
from a partner... partner.

222
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,100
That reminds me.
No hard feelings about the--

223
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,900
- Oh, no, no. Happens all the time.
- Mr. O'Connell.

224
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,200
Can you look me in the eye and guarantee
me this isn't some kind of a flimflam?

225
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,700
- Because if it is, l am warning you--
- You're warning me?

226
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Lady, let me put it this way:
My whole damn garrison
believed in this so much...

227
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,400
that without orders,
they marched halfway across Libya
and into Egypt to find that city.

228
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,500
When we got there,
all we found...

229
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,700
was sand and blood.

230
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,800
Let me get your bags.

231
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,700
Yes, yes, you're right.

232
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,300
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

233
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,300
Bright good morning to all.

234
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, no.
What are you doing here?

235
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,000
l'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

236
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,400
Quit playin' with
your glasses and cut the deck, Burns.

237
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,300
Without my glasses
l can't see the deck to cut it, Dave.

238
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,100
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

239
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
- l only gamble with
my life, never my money.
- Never?

240
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,600
What if l was to bet you $500
we get to Hamunaptra before you?

241
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,500
- You're looking for Hamunaptra?
- Damn straight we are.

242
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
- And who says we are?
- He does.

243
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,800
- Well--
- Well, how 'bout it?

244
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,600
ls it a bet?

245
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,800
- All right, you're on.
- What makes you so confident, sir?

246
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,900
- What makes you?
- We got us a man
who's actually been there.

247
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Oh, what a coincidence,
because O'Connell--

248
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
Whose play is it?

249
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,800
ls it-- ls it my play?
l thought--

250
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,100
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

251
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,000
Good night.

252
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare ya.

253
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
The only thing that scares me,
Mr. O'Connell, are your manners.

254
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Still angry about that kiss, huh?

255
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,200
Well, if you call that a kiss.

256
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,300
Um, did l miss something?

257
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,400
Are we--
Are we going into battle?

258
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,700
Lady, there's something
out there.

259
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Something underneath that sand.

260
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,100
Yes, well, l'm hoping to find
a certain artifact.

261
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
A book, actually.

262
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,800
My brother
thinks there's treasure.

263
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,400
- What do you think's out there?
- ln a word? Evil.

264
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,800
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed.

265
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,600
Oh, look, l don't believe in fairy tales
and hokum, Mr. O'Connell...

266
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,700
but l do believe one of the most famous
books in history is buried there.

267
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,600
The Book of Amun-Ra.

268
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,300
lt contains within it all the secret
incantations of the old kingdom.

269
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,100
lt's what first interested me in Egypt
when l was a child.

270
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,500
lt's why l came here--
sort of a life's pursuit.

271
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,600
And the fact that they say it's made out
of pure gold makes no never mind to you?

272
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,800
- Right?
- You know your history.

273
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
l know my treasure.

274
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,600
Um... by the way...

275
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
why did you kiss me?

276
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,200
l was about to be hanged.
lt seemed like a good idea at the time.

277
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,700
What?
What'd l say?

278
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,000
Surprise!

279
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,900
My good friend,
you're alive!

280
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
l was so very,
very worried.

281
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,900
Well, if it ain't
my little buddy Beni.

282
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,000
- l think l'll kill you.
- Think of my children.

283
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,700
You don't have any children.

284
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,000
- Someday l might.
- Shut up!

285
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,500
So you're the one who's leading
the Americans. l might have known.

286
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,600
What's the scam? You take them into the
desert, and then you leave 'em to rot?

287
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,500
Unfortunately, no.

288
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,400
These Americans are smart.

289
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,700
They pay me only half now,
half when l get them back to Cairo.

290
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,900
- So this time l must go all the way.
- Them's the breaks, huh?

291
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,200
You never believed
in Hamunaptra, O'Connell.

292
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Why are you going back?

293
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
You see that girl?

294
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
She saved my neck.

295
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,300
You always did have
more balls than brains.

296
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,200
Yeah.

297
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,700
Good-bye, Beni.

298
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,000
O'Connell!

299
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,600
''George Bembridge...

300
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,100
in eighteen-sixty--''

301
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,300
Hmm. ''1865 was--

302
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
was--''

303
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl,
it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

304
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,100
Where is the map?

305
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,900
lt's--
lt's... there.

306
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,200
And the key?
Where is the key?

307
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,900
The key? The key?
What key?

308
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Evelyn!

309
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,100
The map!
The map! l forgot the map!

310
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,600
Relax. l'm the map.
lt's all up here.

311
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Oh, that's comforting.

312
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,600
- The key!
- Evy?

313
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Hold on to this.

314
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,600
Can you swim?

315
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,800
- Of course l can swim,
if the occasion calls for it.
- Trust me.

316
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,100
lt calls for it.

317
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,600
O'Connell! O'Connell!

318
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,800
What are we going to do?

319
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,000
- Wait here! l'll go get help!
- Right!

320
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,300
Americans.

321
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,700
l say, bloody good show, chaps!

322
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,600
And did l panic?

323
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
l think not.

324
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,700
Get out of here!

325
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,800
Get 'em out of the water!
Come on, dogies!

326
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,700
Give 'em a smack, would ya!

327
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,400
This is a messed-up country.

328
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,000
We've lost everything!

329
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,400
All of our tools,
all the equipment!

330
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,000
All my clothes!

331
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,000
O'Connell!

332
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,600
Hey!

333
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
O'Connell!

334
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,000
lt looks to me
like l've got all the horses!

335
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,500
Hey, Beni!

336
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Looks to me like you're on
the wrong side of the river!

337
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah.

338
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,700
l only want four! Four!

339
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,100
l only want four,
not a whole bloody herd!

340
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,200
O'Connell! Ohh!
Can you believe the cheek?

341
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Just pay the man.

342
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Oh, for heaven's sake.

343
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,500
Can't believe the price
of these fleabags.

344
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,100
Yes, happy.
Very good.

345
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,900
You probably could've
got 'em for free.

346
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,300
- All you had to do
was give him your sister.
- Yes.

347
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,400
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

348
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
Awfully.

349
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,700
Never did like camels.

350
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,500
Filthy buggers.

351
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,500
They smell, they bite, they spit.

352
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,700
Disgusting.

353
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
l think they're adorable.

354
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Oh, baby.

355
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,200
Good morning, my friend.

356
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,300
What the hell we doin'?

357
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Patience, my good barat'm.
Patience.

358
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,100
Remember our bet, O'Connell.
First one to the city, 500 cash bucks.

359
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,400
A hundred of them bucks is yours
if you help us win that bet.

360
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,900
Oh, my pleasure.

361
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,700
Hey, O'Connell.

362
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,300
Nice camel.

363
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Get ready for it.

364
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,700
For what?

365
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,600
We're about to be shown the way.

366
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
Will ya look at that.

367
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,100
Can you believe it?

368
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,600
Hamunaptra.

369
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,200
Here we go again.

370
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
Oww!

371
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,700
So long, Beni!

372
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,300
That serves you right.

373
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,500
Whoo!

374
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Evy! Go!

375
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,400
Whoo!

376
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Whoo-hoo!

377
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Do they know somethin'
we don't?

378
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
They are led by a woman.

379
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,800
What does a woman know?

380
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
That's a statue of Anubis.

381
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
lts legs go deep underground.

382
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,100
According to Bembridge scholars,
that's where we'll find
a secret compartment...

383
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,300
containing the golden
Book of Amun-Ra.

384
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Jonathan, you're meant
to catch the sun with that.

385
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,600
So, uh, what are
these old mirrors for?

386
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,400
Ancient mirrors. lt's an ancient
Egyptian trick. You'll see.

387
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Uh, here, this is for, uh, you.

388
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,300
Go ahead. lt's something
l borrowed off our American brethren.

389
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,200
l thought you might like it--

390
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,300
you might need it
for when you're, uh-- uh, yeah.

391
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,400
What are you lookin' at?

392
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,600
Hey! Look for bugs.

393
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,500
l hate bugs.

394
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,500
We're standing inside a room
no one has entered in over 3,000 years.

395
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,000
Whoo! What is
that god-awful stench?

396
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,800
And then there was...

397
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,700
light.

398
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,100
Hey, that is a neat trick.

399
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,700
- Oh, my God. lt's a sah-netjer.
- Huh?

400
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,700
- A preparation room.
- Preparation for what?

401
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,000
For entering the afterlife.

402
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,400
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

403
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,300
What the--

404
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
What was that?

405
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,700
Sounds like... bugs.

406
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,600
He said bugs.

407
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,900
What do you mean, bugs?
l hate bugs.

408
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,100
The legs of Anubis.

409
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The secret compartment
should be hidden somewhere inside here.

410
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,400
You scared the bejesus
out of us, O'Connell.

411
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,200
Likewise.

412
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,400
- Hey, that's my tool kit.
- l don't think so.

413
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Okay.

414
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,000
Perhaps l was mistaken.

415
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,500
Have a nice day, gentlemen. We have
a lot of work to be getting along with.

416
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,000
- Push off! This is our dig site.
- We got here first.

417
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,200
This here's our statue, friend.

418
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,000
l don't see your name
written on it... pal.

419
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,000
Yes, well,
there's only four of you...

420
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,900
and 15 of me.

421
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,200
Your odds are not so great,
O'Connell.

422
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,700
- l've had worse.
- Yeah, me too.

423
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,100
Oh, look, for goodness' sake,
let's be nice, children.

424
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,700
lf we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

425
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,800
There are other places to dig.

426
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,500
According to these hieroglyphics...

427
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,400
we're underneath the statue.

428
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,600
We should come up
right between his legs.

429
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,900
- When those damn Yanks
go to sleep-- No offense--
- None taken.

430
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,800
we'll dig our way up and steal that book
right out from under them.

431
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,200
Are you sure we can find
this secret compartment?

432
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Oh, yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

433
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,900
- No offense.
- None taken.

434
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
Where'd our smelly
little friend get to?

435
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Hey.

436
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
What have we here?

437
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,000
Blue gold.

438
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,600
This will fetch
a mighty fine price.

439
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,800
- Let's get us some treasure!
- Careful!

440
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,500
Seti was no fool.

441
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,900
l think perhaps we should
let the diggers open it, hmm?

442
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,700
Oh, l think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

443
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,600
Yeah, sure.
Let them open it.

444
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,600
Zee-eda.

445
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,700
Let me get this straight.

446
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,300
They ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars.

447
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,900
They'd take out your heart as well.
You know how they took out your brains?

448
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,700
l don't think we need
to know this.

449
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,700
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose...

450
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,900
scramble things about a bit and then
rip it all out through your nostrils.

451
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,400
That's gotta hurt.

452
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,800
lt's called mummification.
You'll be dead when they do this.

453
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,200
lf l don't make it out of here,
don't put me down for mummification.

454
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Likewise.

455
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,300
Oh, my God.
lt's a--

456
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,400
lt's a sarcophagus.

457
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,900
Buried at the base of Anubis.

458
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,500
He must have been someone
of great importance.

459
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,000
Or he did something very naughty.

460
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,500
Oh, Allah.

461
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,500
One more.

462
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,200
One more.

463
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,700
Help me! Help me!

464
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,500
Well, who is it?

465
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,600
''He That Shall Not Be Named.''

466
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,600
This looks like
some sort of a lock.

467
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,900
- Well, whoever's in here
sure wasn't getting out.
- Yeah, no kidding.

468
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,200
lt'd take us a month
to crack into this thing without a key.

469
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
A key?

470
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,100
A key! A key!
That's what he was talking about!

471
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,500
- Who?
- The man on the barge.

472
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,800
The one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

473
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
Hey, that's mine.

474
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,700
- What do you suppose killed him?
- Did you ever see him eat?

475
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,400
Seems that our American friends had
a little misfortune of their own today.

476
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,000
Three of their diggers
were, uh... melted.

477
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,900
- What?
- How?

478
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,700
Salt acid.
Pressurized salt acid.

479
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,900
Some kind of
ancient booby trap.

480
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,000
Maybe this place really is cursed.

481
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,200
Oh, for goodness' sake, you two!

482
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,500
- You don't believe in curses?
- No, l don't.

483
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,300
l believe if l can see it
and l can touch it, it's real.
That's what l believe.

484
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,400
l believe in being prepared.

485
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,300
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

486
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,300
My God, what is it?

487
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,200
A broken bottle.

488
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,000
Glenlivet. Twelve years old!

489
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,900
He may have been a stinky fellow,
but he had good taste.

490
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,100
Take this. Stay here.

491
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,100
- No, wait, wait! Wait for me. Wait!
- Evy!

492
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,100
Excuse me, but didn't the man
just say ''stay here''? Evy!

493
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,900
Mr. Henderson!
Wake up!

494
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,400
O'Connell!

495
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Enough! Yallah!

496
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,200
We will shed no more blood,
but you must leave.

497
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,300
Leave this place or die.

498
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,800
You have one day.

499
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,300
Yallah! Nimshi!

500
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,500
Evelyn.

501
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,800
Hey.

502
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,100
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm fine.

503
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,000
- You sure?
- Thank you.

504
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,100
That proves it. Old Seti's
fortune's got to be under this sand.

505
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,300
For them to protect it like this,
you know there's treasure down there.

506
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,000
No, these men are desert people.
They value water, not gold.

507
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,000
You know, maybe just at night,
we could, uh, combine forces, hmm?

508
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,100
Hey, tough stuff, try a right hook.

509
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,600
Ball up your fist and put it--
put it up like that.

510
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,000
- Mm-hmm.
- And then mean it. Hit it right here.

511
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,300
- l mean it!
- Okay.

512
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,400
Okay, it's time
for another drink.

513
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,400
Unlike my brother, sir...

514
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,700
l know when to say no.

515
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,100
And unlike
your brother, miss...

516
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,900
you, l just don't get.

517
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,200
l know.

518
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,100
You're wondering...

519
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,700
what is a place like me
doing in a girl like this.

520
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
Yeah, something like that.

521
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,200
Egypt is in my blood.

522
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,700
You see, my-- my father...

523
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,300
was a very, very
famous explorer...

524
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,600
and he loved Egypt
so much...

525
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,000
he married my mother,
who was an Egyptian...

526
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,800
and quite
an adventurer herself.

527
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,000
l get your father,
and l get your mother...

528
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,300
and, uh...

529
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,400
l get him, but...

530
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,300
what are you doing here?

531
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,100
Look, l--
l may not be...

532
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,000
an explorer...

533
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,400
or-or an adventurer...

534
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,500
or a treasure seeker
or a gunfighter...

535
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,400
Mr. O'Connell...

536
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,100
but l am proud
of what l am.

537
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,700
And what is that?

538
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,700
l...

539
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,000
am a librarian.

540
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,100
And l am going
to kiss you...

541
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,700
Mr. O'Connell.

542
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,000
Call me Rick.

543
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,500
Oh, Rick.

544
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Awam, awam!

545
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,700
Djaceb, djaceb.

546
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,400
- There is a curse upon this chest.
- Curse, my ass.

547
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,000
- Who cares?
- Have a care, Mr. Henderson.

548
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,100
ln these hallowed grounds, that which
was set forth in ancient times...

549
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,800
- is as strong today as it was then.
- We understand.

550
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,700
What's it say?

551
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,800
''Death will come
on swift wings...

552
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,100
to whomsoever
opens this chest.''

553
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,700
We should not be here.

554
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,600
This is not good.

555
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,800
lt says, ''There is one...

556
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
the undead...

557
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,800
who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law...

558
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,800
to consummate this curse.''

559
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,600
Let's make sure we don't bring anyone
back from the dead then.

560
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,900
''He will kill all
who open this chest...

561
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,000
and assimilate
their organs and fluids...

562
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,700
and in so doing,
he will regenerate...

563
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,500
and no longer be
the undead...

564
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,700
but a plague
upon this Earth.''

565
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,700
Well, we didn't come
all this way for nothin'.

566
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,700
- That's right.
- lt's the curse.

567
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,800
lt's the curse.

568
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,000
lt's the curse!
Beware of the curse!

569
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,000
Beware!

570
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,700
Stupid superstitious bastard.

571
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,400
Oh, l've dreamt about this
since l was a little girl.

572
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,300
You dream about dead guys?

573
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,200
Look, his sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

574
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,200
This man must have been condemned
not only in this life but in the next.

575
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,700
- Tough break.
- Yeah, l'm all tears.

576
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,700
Now, let's see who's inside, shall we?

577
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,500
Oh, my God, l hate it
when these things do that.

578
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,400
ls he supposed to
look like that?

579
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,200
No, l've never seen a mummy
look like this before.

580
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,300
He's still-- still--

581
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,400
- Juicy.
- Yes.

582
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,600
He must be more
than 3,000 years old...

583
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,900
and, well, it looks
as if he's still...

584
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,400
decomposing.

585
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,500
Hey, look at that.

586
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,800
What do you make of this?

587
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,800
My God, these marks
were made with...

588
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,100
fingernails.

589
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,400
This man was buried alive.

590
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,300
And he left a message.

591
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,300
''Death is only the beginning.''

592
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,500
Oh, my God.

593
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,100
lt does exist.

594
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,800
- The Book of the Dead.
- A book?

595
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,400
Who cares about a book?
Where the hell's the treasure?

596
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,100
This, gentlemen...

597
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,600
this is treasure.

598
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,700
Hell, l wouldn't trade you
for a brass--

599
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,800
Look at that.

600
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,100
There's your treasure, gentlemen.

601
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,200
Now we're onto something.

602
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,900
l believe you need a key
to open that book.

603
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,500
Say, O'Connell, what do you think
these babies'll fetch back home?

604
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,100
We hear you boys found yourselves
a nice, gooey mummy.

605
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,800
Congratulations.

606
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,700
lf you dry that fella out, you might
be able to sell him for firewood.

607
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,100
Look what l found.

608
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,000
You're in her seat.

609
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,900
- Now!
- Yup.

610
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,600
Scarab skeletons,
flesh eaters.

611
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,100
l found them inside
our friend's coffin.

612
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,300
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

613
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,900
Unfortunately for our friend,
he was still alive
when they started eating him.

614
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,500
So somebody threw these in with our guy,
and then they slowly ate him alive?

615
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,900
Very slowly.

616
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,800
He certainly wasn't a popular fellow
when they planted him.

617
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, he probably got a little
too frisky with the pharaoh's daughter.

618
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,200
Well, according
to my readings...

619
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,500
our friend suffered the Hom-Dai, the
worst of all ancient Egyptian curses...

620
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,500
one reserved only
for the most evil of blasphemers.

621
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,500
ln my research, l've never heard of this
curse having actually been performed.

622
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,100
- That bad, huh?
- Yes, well, they--

623
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,900
They never used it
because they feared it so.

624
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,300
lt's written that if a victim
of the Hom-Dai should ever arise...

625
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,600
he would bring with him
the ten plagues of Egypt.

626
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,100
That's called stealing,
you know.

627
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
According to you
and my brother...

628
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,200
it's called borrowing.

629
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,100
l thought the Book of Amun-Ra
was made out of gold.

630
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,100
lt is made out of gold.
This isn't the Book of Amun-Ra.

631
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,100
This is something else.

632
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,200
l think this may be
the Book of the Dead.

633
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,100
The Book of the Dead?

634
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,800
Are you sure you want to
be playing around with this thing?

635
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,900
lt's just a book.
No harm ever came from...

636
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,700
reading a book.

637
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,800
That happens a lot around here.

638
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,400
So, what's it say?

639
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,200
''Amun Ra. Amun Dei.''

640
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,300
lt speaks of the night
and of the day.

641
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,300
You must not read from the book!

642
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
Run!

643
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,100
Go, go!

644
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,300
What have we done?

645
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,500
Where the hell
did they come from?

646
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,900
l ain't waitin' around to find out.

647
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,800
My glasses. My glasses!

648
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,100
Leave me! Leave me!

649
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,400
Hey! Hey!

650
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,000
Could you help me
find my gl-- Oh.

651
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,900
Wait for me!

652
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,400
Who's there?

653
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,800
Who's there?

654
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,900
Henderson?

655
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
Ah, Jon!

656
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,800
Scarabs!

657
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,700
- Run, Evy!
- Go, go, go! Run!

658
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,500
- Evelyn?
- Evy?

659
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,700
- Evelyn!
- Evy!

660
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,500
Oh. Oh, Mr. Burns.
Thank goodness.

661
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,000
l was just starting
to get scared.

662
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,100
l've lost everyone. l--

663
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,500
My eyes. My eyes.

664
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,300
Please help me.

665
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,600
My tongue. He took my tongue.

666
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,900
Please don't leave me.

667
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:01,000
Anck-su-namun?

668
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,900
Damn it!
lt's a trap door.

669
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,600
There's gotta be a switch or something
around here someplace.

670
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,000
Run, you sons of bitches! Run!

671
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,200
Go.

672
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,200
Go! Go!

673
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,500
There you are!
Will you quit playing hide-and-seek?

674
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,100
Come on.
Let's get out of here. Whoa!

675
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,400
Evy!

676
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,300
- Move!
- Yeah, right. Did you see that?

677
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,300
lt was walking. lt was walking!

678
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,600
l told you to leave or die.
You refused.

679
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,700
Now you may have
killed us all...

680
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,900
for you have unleashed a creature we
have feared for more than 3,000 years.

681
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,400
- Relax. l got him.
- No mortal weapon
can kill this creature.

682
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,600
He's not of this world.

683
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,600
- You bastards.
- What did you do to him?

684
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,700
We saved him, saved him before
the creature could finish his work.

685
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,500
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

686
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,300
Yallah. Nimishi.

687
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,500
We must now go on the hunt
and try and find a way to kill him.

688
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,900
l already told you l got him.

689
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Know this.

690
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,700
This creature
is the bringer of death.

691
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,400
He will never eat,
he will never sleep...

692
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,400
and he will never stop.

693
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,100
May the good Lord protect
and watch over me...

694
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,600
as a shepherd
watches over his flock.

695
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,700
No? Okay.

696
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,300
My prince.

697
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,900
l thought you said you didn't believe in
that fairy tales and hokum stuff. Shoo!

698
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:08,000
H-Having an encounter
with a 3,000-year-old
walking, talking corpse...

699
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,800
does tend to convert one.

700
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,800
Forget it. We're out the door,
down the hall and we're gone.

701
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,700
- Oh, no, we are not.
- Oh, yes, we are.

702
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,600
Oh, no, we are not. We woke him up,
and we are going to stop him.

703
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,700
''We''? What we?
We didn't read that book.

704
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,500
l told you not to play around
with that thing. Didn't l tell you?

705
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,700
Yes, then me, me, me, me, l, l,
l woke him up and l intend to stop him.

706
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,500
Yeah? How? You heard the man--
no mortal weapons can kill this guy.

707
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,500
Then we are just going to
have to find some immortal ones.

708
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:37,400
- There goes that ''we'' again.
- Will you listen to me? We have to do--

709
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Once this creature has been reborn...

710
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,700
his curse is going to spread until
the whole of the Earth is destroyed.

711
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,700
- Yeah? ls that my problem?
- lt is everybody's problem.

712
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,700
Evelyn, l appreciate you saving my life
and all, but when l signed on...

713
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,300
l agreed to take you out there
and to bring you back.

714
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,500
l have done that.
End of job. End of story.

715
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,900
- Contract terminated.
- That's all l am to you? A contract?

716
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,800
You can either
tag along with me...

717
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,300
or you can stay here...
and try and save the world!

718
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,200
- What's it gonna be?
- l'm staying.

719
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,100
- Fine!
- Fine.

720
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,200
- Fine.
- Fine.

721
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,600
- Fine.
- Ooh!

722
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,300
l'm the last of the Royal Air Corps
still stationed out here, you know.

723
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,600
Some bloody idiot
spilled his drink.

724
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,300
All the other laddies died in the sky
and were buried in the sand.

725
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,100
Good chaps,
every one of them too. Ooh.

726
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,000
- Hi, Winston.
- Ye-- Uh-- You know, O'Connell.

727
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,400
Ever since the end
of the great war...

728
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,300
there hasn't been a--
a single challenge...

729
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,800
- worthy of a man like me.
- Yeah?

730
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,000
We all got our little
problems today, Winston.

731
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,900
l just wish l could have
chucked it in with the others...

732
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,900
and gone down
in flame and glory...

733
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,900
instead of sitting
around here...

734
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,000
rotting of boredom and booze.

735
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,600
Cheers. Mmm.

736
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:57,000
Mmm. Oh, well, back to the airfield.

737
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,700
- Tell me, has your sister always been--
- Oh, yes, always.

738
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,600
We're all packed up, but the damn boat
doesn't leave till tomorrow morning.

739
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,100
Tail set firmly
between your legs, l see.

740
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,300
You can talk. You don't have
some sacred walkin' corpse after ya.

741
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,200
So, uh, how's your friend?

742
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,300
He had his eyes and his tongue
ripped out. How would you be?

743
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,500
l'm so pleased...

744
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,400
to meet you.

745
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,200
Prince lmhotep
does not like to be touched.

746
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,600
A silly Eastern superstition,
l'm afraid.

747
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Please forgive me.

748
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,400
Oh-ho. Whoops.

749
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,300
Mr. Burns...

750
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,500
Prince lmhotep thanks you
for your hospitality.

751
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,000
And for your eyes...

752
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,900
- and for your tongue.
- Wha--

753
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,100
- But l am afraid more is needed.
- Wha--

754
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,000
The prince must finish the job...

755
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,700
and consummate the curse
which you and your friends...

756
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,300
- have brought down upon yourselves.
- Wait! No!

757
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,100
Good luck, boys.

758
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:13,300
Sweet Jesus!
Tasted just like--

759
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,500
Blood.

760
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,200
''And the rivers and waters
of Egypt ran red...

761
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,400
and were as blood.''

762
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,700
He's here.

763
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh, looks like
there's gonna be a storm.

764
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,400
- Oh, Evelyn!
- Oh, so you're still here.

765
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,600
We've got problems.

766
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,200
Hey!

767
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,000
Beni, you little stinkweed.
Where you been?

768
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,600
We are in serious trouble.

769
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,200
We are in very serious trouble.

770
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,100
He does seem to like Evy.

771
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,000
Yeah, what's that about?

772
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,100
- What's this guy want?
- There's only one person
that can give us any answers.

773
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,300
- You!
- Miss Carnahan.

774
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,100
- Gentlemen.
- What is he doing here?

775
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,700
Do you really want to know,
or would you prefer to just shoot us?

776
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,800
After what l just saw...

777
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,400
l'm willing to go
on a little faith here.

778
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,200
We are part of
an ancient secret society.

779
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,700
For over 3,000 years
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

780
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:39,300
We are sworn at manhood
to do any and all in our power
to stop the High Priest lmhotep...

781
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,000
- from being reborn into this world.
- Because of you, we have failed.

782
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,400
You think this justifies
the killing of innocent people?

783
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,700
- To stop this creature?
Let me think. Yes!
- Yes!

784
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,900
Question:
Why doesn't he like cats?

785
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:56,700
Cats are the guardians of the
underworld. He will fear them
until he is fully regenerated.

786
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,800
- Then he will fear nothing.
- You know how he gets hisself
fully regenerated?

787
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,700
- By killin' everyone
who opened that chest.
- And suckin' 'em dry!

788
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,800
Jonathan, will you stop
playing with that?

789
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:10,600
When l saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-su-namun.

790
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,800
And then just now in Mr. Burns'
quarters, h-he tried to kiss me.

791
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,600
lt's because of his love
for Anck-su-namun that he was cursed.

792
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,500
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years--
- He is still in love with her.

793
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,500
Yes, that is very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

794
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,300
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

795
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,500
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.

796
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,100
Bad luck, old mum.

797
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,400
On the contrary, it may
just give us the time we need...

798
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,300
to kill the creature.

799
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,900
We will need all the help we can get.
His powers are growing.

800
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,600
''And he stretched forth
his hand towards the heavens...

801
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,400
and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt.''

802
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,600
We must stop him from regenerating.

803
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,200
- Who opened that chest?
- There was me and Daniels here.

804
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,700
- And Burns, of course.
- And that Egyptologist fellow.

805
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,100
- What about my buddy Beni?
- No, he scrammed outta there
'fore we opened the thing.

806
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,000
- Yeah, he was the smart one.
- Well, that sounds like Beni.

807
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,700
We must find the Egyptologist and bring
him back to the safety of the fort...

808
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,600
- before the creature can get to him.
- Right.

809
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,500
She stays here.
You three, come with me.

810
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,500
You can't leave me behind
like some old carpetbag.

811
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:27,100
Who put you in charge? O'Connell,
what do you think you are doing?

812
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,500
- Jonathan! O'Connell!
- Sorry, but he's a bit... tall.

813
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,000
Coward that you are! O'Connell,
you are not leaving me in here!

814
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,200
Jonathan, if you don't open this door
in one minute flat--

815
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,200
- O'Connell, let me out of here.
- This door doesn't open.

816
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,900
- She doesn't come out,
and no one goes in, right?
- Right.

817
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,200
- Right?
- Right.

818
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,600
- O'Connell! Jonathan!
- Let's go, Jonathan.

819
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,700
Oh, l thought l could just stay
at the fort and, uh, reconnoiter.

820
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,400
- Now!
- Yeah, right. We're just
gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

821
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,500
Well, well, well.
Let me guess. Spring cleaning.

822
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,100
Nice shot.

823
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,200
Oh, Beni, did you fall down?
Let me help you up.

824
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,400
You came back from the desert
with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

825
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,700
What friend?
You are my only friend.

826
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,800
What the hell are you doing
with this creep? What's in it for you?

827
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:56,800
lt is better to be the right hand
of the devil than in his path.

828
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,200
As long as l serve him,
l am immune.

829
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,200
- lmmune from what?
- Piszkas allat.

830
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,300
- What did you say?
- l don't wanna tell you.
You'll just hurt me some more.

831
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,500
What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

832
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,400
The book! The black book they found
at Hamunaptra. He wants it back.

833
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,900
He said to me it would be
worth its weight in gold.

834
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,300
- What does he want the book for?
- l don't know.

835
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,900
Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

836
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,700
But that's all.
He just wants the book, l swear.

837
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,800
Just the book, l swear.
And your sister.

838
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,400
But other than that--

839
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,700
But other than that--

840
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,600
That's two down,
two to go.

841
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,900
Then he'll be coming after Evy.

842
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,000
Guards in place!
Reporting all clear, sir!

843
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,900
To hell with this.

844
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,200
l'm goin' downstairs, get me a drink.
You want somethin'?

845
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,700
- Yeah. Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon.
- All right.

846
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,200
- A-And a shot of bourbon.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

847
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,700
- And a bourbon chaser.
- l'll get your damn bourbon!

848
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,100
Don't worry about the door.

849
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,700
Anck-su-namun.

850
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,700
Hey, get your ugly face off of her!

851
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,100
Look what l got.

852
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,400
- You all right?
- Well, l'm not sure.

853
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,900
Well, according to legend,
the black book the Americans
found at Hamunaptra...

854
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,900
is supposed to bring people
back from the dead.

855
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,600
- Until now it was a notion
l was unwilling to believe.
- Believe it, sister.

856
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,500
That's what brought
our buddy back to life.

857
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,800
l'm thinking that if the black book
can bring dead people to life--

858
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:25,500
- Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
- That's the myth.

859
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,000
Now we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

860
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,900
lmhotep. lmhotep.

861
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,600
Last but not least...

862
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,400
my favorite plague--
boils and sores.

863
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,800
They have become his slaves.

864
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,000
So it has begun,
the beginning of the end.

865
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,200
Not quite yet, it hasn't.
Come on.

866
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,500
lmhotep. lmhotep.

867
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,100
According to Bembridge scholars,
the golden Book of Amun-Ra...

868
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,200
is located inside
the statue of Anubis.

869
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,300
- That's where we found the black book.
- Exactly.

870
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,800
- Looks like the old boys
at Bembridge were mistaken.
- They mixed the books up.

871
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,700
Mixed up where
they were buried.

872
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,600
So if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis...

873
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,200
then the golden book
must be inside--

874
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,300
- Come on, Evy. Faster.
- Patience is a virtue.

875
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,400
Not right now it isn't.

876
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,900
Uh, l think l'll go
and get the car started.

877
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:01,800
l've got it. The golden
Book of Amun-Ra is at Hamunaptra
inside the statue of Horus.

878
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:04,000
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

879
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,700
lmhotep.

880
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,300
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

881
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,800
- Get this thing in gear, boy.
Let's get outta here.
- Evy!

882
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,300
- Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
- lmhotep!

883
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,900
You're gonna get yours, Beni!
You hear me?

884
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:56,000
- You're gonna get yours!
- Oh, like l've never heard that before!

885
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,100
Hang on!

886
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,800
Hey! O'Connell!
O'Connell!

887
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,900
Okay! Go, go!

888
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,500
Back! Back!

889
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,200
lmhotep. lmhotep.

890
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,700
lt's the creature.

891
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:25,200
He's fully regenerated.

892
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,300
Keetah mi pharos...

893
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:30,100
aja nilo, isirian.

894
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,100
''Come with me, my princess.

895
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,900
lt is time
to make you mine forever.''

896
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,700
''For all eternity,'' idiot.

897
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:41,200
Koontash dai na...

898
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,100
aja nilo.

899
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,400
''Take my hand...

900
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,500
and l will spare
your friends.''

901
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,800
Oh, dear.

902
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,000
- Have you got any bright ideas?
- l'm thinkin', l'm thinkin'.

903
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,600
You better think of something fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy...

904
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,000
you're the first one
l'm coming after.

905
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,200
Don't!

906
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:09,100
He has to take me to Hamunaptra
to perform the ritual.

907
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:12,000
She is right.
Live today, fight tomorrow.

908
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,700
l'll be seeing you again.

909
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,500
Evelyn!

910
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,100
- Hey, that's mine.
- Thank you.

911
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,600
No! Let go of me!

912
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,600
- lmhotep.
- Let go of me!

913
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,200
- Good-bye, my friend.
- Come here, you little--

914
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,500
lmhotep. lmhotep.

915
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,400
Come on!

916
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,900
- What about my sister?
- We're gonna get her back! Go!

917
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,500
You're next!

918
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,600
Come on!
Give me your hand!

919
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,300
- You go!
- Come on!

920
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:10,000
Go!

921
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,400
Morning, Winston.
Uh, a word?

922
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:48,400
What's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

923
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,900
Not a damn thing.

924
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,600
- ls it dangerous?
- You probably won't live through it.

925
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,900
By Jove, do you really think so?

926
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,000
Everybody else we've bumped into
has died. Why not you?

927
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,300
What's the, uh--
What's the challenge then?

928
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,500
Rescue the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy and save the world.

929
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,400
Oh! Winston Havelock
at your service, sir.

930
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,800
Are you all right?

931
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:25,000
Do l bloody look all right?

932
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,900
How you doin'?

933
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,200
See that?
l've never seen one so big.

934
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,600
- Never?
- No!

935
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,700
Get off of me! Get off!

936
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,500
l need a new job.

937
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,700
Oh, my God.

938
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,900
We're back.

939
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,900
O'Connell.

940
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,900
Oh, my God.

941
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,900
Hey, Winston!
Pedal faster!

942
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,800
Hang on, men!

943
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,800
Stop it!
You'll kill them!

944
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,300
That's the idea.

945
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,700
Here l come, laddies!

946
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,900
l love the whole
sand wall trick.

947
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,500
lt was beautiful. Bastard.

948
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,400
Excuse me.

949
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,800
Um, a little help
would be useful...

950
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,800
if it's not too much trouble!

951
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:04,900
Yeah, yeah. All right.

952
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:13,200
Winston! Hey, Winston!

953
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:30,700
Quicksand!
Get back! lt's quicksand.

954
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,200
Keep moving!

955
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,600
Nasty little fellows such as yourself
always get their comeuppance.

956
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,100
Really? They do?

957
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,400
Oh, yes. Always.

958
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:39,100
l'd take
those bigger stones first.

959
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,100
Take them from the top, otherwise
the whole thing will cave in on us.

960
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,700
Come on.
Put your backs into it.

961
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:49,200
Yes, well, you've got the idea.
Chop-chop.

962
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,500
l say!

963
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,000
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

964
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:14,000
What?

965
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,900
lt's in my arm!
My arm!

966
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,000
Whoa!

967
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,800
- Do something!
- Hold him!

968
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,900
Do something! Do something!
Not that! Not that!

969
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,800
O'Connell.

970
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:43,500
Shatay Wapay Ku Ra Eck!

971
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,100
Bembridge scholars
never wrote about this.

972
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,800
Get off me.
Get off!

973
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,800
Wha-- Wha--

974
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,800
- Can you see--
- Yeah.

975
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,300
- Can you believe--
- Yeah.

976
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,900
- Can we just--
- No.

977
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:35,400
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Priests.

978
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,700
lmhotep's priests.

979
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,800
All right then.

980
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,100
There he is!

981
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:29,500
Hello, Horus, old boy.

982
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,800
Time to close the door.

983
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:55,700
Let's go.

984
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,100
Anck-su-namun.

985
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,600
O'Connell!
Jonathan!

986
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,800
Damn.

987
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:48,300
- These guys just don't quit, do they?
- Keep digging.

988
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,300
Oh! The Book of Amun-Ra.

989
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,700
Save the girl.

990
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,200
Kill the creature.

991
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:38,800
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

992
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,400
You all right?
Let's go.

993
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:44,500
The Book of Amun-Ra!
l found it, Evy! l found it!

994
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,900
Shut up
and get me off here, Jonathan!

995
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:52,600
Open the book, Jonathan.
lt's the only way to kill him.

996
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,500
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

997
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,600
Well, l can't open it!
lt's locked or something.

998
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:04,500
- We need the key, Evy!
- lt's inside his robes.

999
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,100
O'Connell!

1000
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:14,900
lm Yub Set Na.

1001
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,500
Mummies.

1002
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,800
Mummies.

1003
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,700
Look out! There's one down--
O'Connell!

1004
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,400
Here's an inscription.

1005
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:28,600
''Rasheem-- Rasheem oola--
Rasheem oola Kashka!''

1006
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,200
Oh, boy.

1007
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,500
Oh, yeah.

1008
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,400
This just keeps gettin'
better and better.

1009
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,600
- Do something, Jonathan.
- Me?

1010
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,700
- You can command them.
- You have got to be joking.

1011
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,800
Finish the inscription
on the cover, idiot.

1012
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:05,300
- Then you can control them.
- Oh. Right.

1013
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,400
Uh-uh.

1014
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:33,000
Oh, oh, oh!

1015
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,000
Hurry up, Jonathan!

1016
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,800
- l can't figure out this last symbol.
- What does it look like?
