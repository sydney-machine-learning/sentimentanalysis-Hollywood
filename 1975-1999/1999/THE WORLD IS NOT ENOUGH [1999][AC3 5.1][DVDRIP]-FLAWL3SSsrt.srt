00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,840
BILBAO, SPAIN

2
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,480
So good of you to come, Mr Bond,
particuIarIy on such short notice.

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,920
If you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the worId come to?

4
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,000
Bon. Now that we're aII comfortabIe,

5
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,080
why don't you sit down?

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,520
It was not easy,
but I have retrieved the money.

7
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,600
No doubt Sir Robert
wiII be pIeased to see it again.

8
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,400
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees and certain

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,360
unforeseeabIe expenses.
Voilá. Your receipt.

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,560
WouId you Iike to check my figures?

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,760
Oh, I'm sure they're perfectIy rounded.

12
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,440
- It's aII there.
- I didn't come for the money.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,800
The report Sir Robert bought was stoIen
from an MI6 agent who was kiIIed for it.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
I want to know who kiIIed him.

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,440
- TerribIe tragedy.
- I just want a name.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,000
I am mereIy the middIeman. I'm just
returning the money to its rightfuI owner.

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,160
And we know how difficuIt that can be
for a Swiss banker.

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,440
I am offering you the opportunity
to waIk out with the money, Mr Bond.

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm giving you the opportunity
to waIk out aIive.

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,720
Looking at our present situation,
strictIy as a banker,

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,400
I'd say that the numbers
are not on your side.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,600
Perhaps you faiIed
to take into account my...

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,680
hidden assets.

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,560
Get up! You seem to have had
a smaII reversaI of fortune.

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,520
- Give me the name.
- I can't teII you.

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,600
Let's count to three.

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
You can do that, can't you?

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
One.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,120
Two.

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,120
AII right, but you'II have to protect me...

31
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,600
MI6 HEADQUARTERS
LONDON

32
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,480
James! Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?

33
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,760
ChocoIates? An engagement ring?

34
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,120
I thought you might enjoy one of these.

35
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,520
How romantic.

36
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,760
I know exactIy where to put that.

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,240
Oh, Moneypenny.
The story of our reIationship.

38
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
CIose, but no cigar.

39
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
l hate to tear you away, 007.
Would you mind coming in?

40
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,280
Right away, M.

41
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,520
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

42
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Ah, the man who retrieved my money.
I can't thank you enough.

43
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,800
CarefuI, M. I might steaI him from you.

44
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,280
Construction's not exactIy
my... speciaIity.

45
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
Quite the opposite, in fact.

46
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,360
Best to the famiIy.

47
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,800
- OId friend?
- We read Iaw at Oxford together.

48
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,360
I aIways knew he'd conquer the worId.

49
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,320
- Care for a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

50
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,880
- He's a man of great integrity.
- Who buys stoIen reports for £3m.

51
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,560
Thank you.

52
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,840
- Any Ieads on the sniper?
- Not one. ProfessionaI job.

53
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,160
She must be working for someone.
Is this the stoIen report?

54
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,720
Yes, cIassified, from the Russian
Atomic Energy Department.

55
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
What wouId King want this for?

56
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,960
He was Ied to beIieve
the document was a secret report,

57
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,280
identifying the terrorists
who'd attacked his new oiI pipeIine.

58
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,400
Interesting.

59
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,440
But it doesn't expIain why someone
wouId want me out of their office aIive.

60
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,280
- King! The money!
- Moneypenny, stop King.

61
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,240
Move! Move! Move!

62
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,360
Stop!

63
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,600
Move!

64
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,640
- Get out of the way!
- Medics coming through!

65
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,400
Stop! Stop! It isn't finished!

66
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,520
What was that?!

67
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,800
- Let's go!
- What the heII do you think...?

68
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,720
Let's go!

69
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,720
Listen to me!

70
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,080
You can't get away. We can make a deaI.
Who are you working for?

71
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,040
Don't do it! Don't bIow us up!

72
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
I can protect you!
Do you understand? I can protect you.

73
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,200
Not from him.

74
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,240
' l know how to hurt

75
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,920

That's right.

107
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,600
HeIIo, my dear.

108
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,280
- Who's that young woman?
- King's daughter.

109
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,200
EIektra.

110
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,160
Thank you.

111
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,000
The money was dipped in urea,

MI6 HEADQUARTERS
SCOTLAND

113
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,120
in effect, a fertiliser bomb.

114
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,200
Having handIed the money,
the water on 007's hands

115
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,960
started a chemicaI reaction.

116
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,200
In one of the notes
the anti-counterfeiting strip

117
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,800
had been repIaced with magnesium,
which acted as a detonator.

118
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,320
And King's IapeI pin
was switched for a copy,

119
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,080
which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the bIast.

120
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,440
In other words,
he set off the bomb that kiIIed him.

121
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,440
We know it was someone cIose to King.

122
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,600
And our onIy Iead committed suicide
on that baIIoon.

123
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,400
But given the size of
King's organisation,

124
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,640
it couId be anyone, anywhere.

125
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,320
M.

126
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,200
This wiII not stand.

127
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,680
We wiII not be terrorised by cowards who
wouId murder, and use us as the tooI.

128
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,880
We'II find these peopIe.

129
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,880
We'II foIIow them to the farthest ends
of the earth if needs be.

130
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,680
And we will bring them to justice.

131
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,320
Tanner!

132
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,720
Sorry, James. M says you're off the active
duty Iist untiI you're cIeared by MedicaI.

133
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,440
DisIocated coIIarbone.

134
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,840
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid
you'II be out of action for weeks.

135
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,840
MoIIy, I need a cIean biII of heaIth.

136
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,960
You have to cIear me for duty.

137
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,600
James,

138
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,760
- that wouIdn't reaIIy be...
- EthicaI?

139
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,480
PracticaI... smart.

140
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,200
WeII, Iet's just... skirt the issue, shaII we?

141
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,320
You'd have to promise to caII me...

142
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,800
..this time.

143
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,280
Whatever the doctor orders.

144
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,040
And I suppose if you stayed
in constant contact...

145
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,560
Of course.

146
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,960
If you showed sufficient stamina,

147
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,000
- and cut out aII kinds of...
- Strenuous activity?

148
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,200
We aII have to pay the piper some time.

149
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,160
- Right, Q?
- Oh, pipe down, 007.

150
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,240
Was it something I said?

151
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,640
No. Something you destroyed.

152
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,520
My fishing boat.

153
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,800
For my retirement. Away from you!

154
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,200
Now, I want to introduce you to

155
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,960
the young feIIow
I'm grooming to foIIow me.

156
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,200
HeIps if you open the door.

157
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,080
And you might be...?

158
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,440
- This is 007.
- If you're Q, does that make him R?

159
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,320
Ah, yes, the Iegendary 007 wit.

160
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,600
Or at Ieast haIf of it.

161
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,920
Now I dare say, 007,
that you've met your match

162
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,280
- with this machine.
- Yeah?

163
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,480
New modeI, improved specs?

164
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,400
I thought you were on the inactive roster.
Some kind of injury?

165
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,240
Yes, weII, we'II see about that. So?

166
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,360
The very Iatest in intercepts
and countermeasures.

167
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,080
Titanium armour,
a muItitasking heads-up dispIay,

168
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,080
and six beverage cup hoIders.

169
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,640
AII in aII, rather stocked!

170
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,080
FuIIy Ioaded, I think is the term.

171
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,240
- I think...
- You're not here to think.

172
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,720
You're here to do what I teII you.
Now go and put on the coat

173
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,880
and demonstrate it for 007.

174
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,960
But of course.

175
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,440
Now watch cIoseIy, pIease, 007.

176
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,120
The right arm goes
in the right sIeeve, thus,

177
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,640
and the Ieft arm in the Ieft sIeeve, thus.

178
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,320
Now, note cIoseIy, pIease,
pockets, poppers and zipper.

179
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,960
Take the Iower part of the zipper

180
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,960
- and insert it into the...
- Oh, puII the tag!

181
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,440
What? You said...

182
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,680
Q...!

183
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,040
Seems weII-suited for the job.

184
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,280
You're not retiring any time soon,

185
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
are you?

186
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,040
Now pay attention, 007.
I've aIways tried to teach you two things.

187
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,000
First, never Iet them see you bIeed.

188
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,840
And the second?

189
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,520
AIways have an escape pIan.

190
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,880
Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

191
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,760
The Cyprus authorities say she escaped
after shooting dead two ofher captors,

192
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,160
and is...

193
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,880
He shouted.

194
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,400
He shouted all the time.

195
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,320
Level One. Clearance required.

196
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,400
Level One. Clearance required.

197
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,920
Yes, 007?

198
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,680
TeII me about the kidnapping

199
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,120
- of EIektra King.
- I wasn't aware you were on this case.

200
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,520
I brought the money in that kiIIed King.

201
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,880
- Don't make this personaI.
- I'm not. Are you?

202
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,080
You're the onIy one
who couId seaI her fiIe.

203
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,600
WiII you excuse us?

204
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,360
I wiII not toIerate insubordination, 007.

205
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,280
What happened?

206
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,720
After EIektra King was kidnapped,

207
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,720
her father tried to deaI with it
on his own,

208
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,120
with no success.

209
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,560
So he came to me.

210
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,720
As you are aware,

211
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,400
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

212
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,360
And against every instinct in my heart,

213
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,440
every...

214
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,440
emotion as a mother,

215
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,160
I toId him not to pay the ransom.

216
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,840
I thought we had time on our side.

217
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
You used the girI as bait.

218
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,840
Yes.

219
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
The money in King's briefcase

220
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,440
was preciseIy the same amount
as the ransom demand for his daughter.

221
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,800
It's a message.

222
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,800
Your terrorist is back.

223
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,560
Victor Zokas, aka...

224
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,720
Renard, the anarchist.

225
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,120
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.

226
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,400
And he's been spotted in Afghanistan,
Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Beirut,

227
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,480
and Cambodia.

228
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
AII the romantic vacation spots.

229
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,240
His onIy goaI is chaos.

230
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,680
After Robert came to me
I sent 009 to kiII Renard.

231
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Before he compIeted the mission,
EIektra escaped.

232
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,600
A week Iater our man
caught up with the target.

233
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,600
He put a buIIet in his head.

234
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,640
That buIIet's stiII there.

235
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
How did he survive?

236
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,720
The doctor who saved Renard
couIdn't get the buIIet out.

237
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,280
So Renard kiIIed him.

238
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,080
It's moving through
the meduIIa obIongata,

239
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,080
kiIIing off his senses.

240
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,560
Touch, smeII, he feeIs no pain...

241
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,080
He can push himseIf harder,
Ionger than any normaI man.

242
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
The buIIet wiII kiII him,

243
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,800
but he'II grow stronger every day
untiI the day he dies.

244
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,160
Robert is dead,

245
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,000
MI6 is humiIiated.
He's had his revenge.

246
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,080
Not quite.

247
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Renard had three enemies
in that kidnapping.

248
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,160
And there's stiII one he hasn't touched.

249
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,360
EIektra.

250
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,000
M.

251
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,080
I see the good doctor has cIeared you.
Notes you have exceptionaI stamina.

252
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,200
I'm sure she was
touched by his dedication

253
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,240
to the job in hand.

254
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,400
007, I want you to go to EIektra.

255
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,360
She's taken over the construction of her
father's oiI pipeIine in the Caspian Sea.

256
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,440
Find who switched that pin.

257
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,400
If your instincts are right,
Renard wiII be back.

258
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,600
- And EIektra wiII be the next target.
- The worm on the hook again?

259
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,360
She doesn't need to know the same man
may be after her. Don't frighten her.

260
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,240
A shadow operation?

261
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,680
Remember,
shadows stay in front or behind.

262
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,280
Never on top.

263
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,640
AZERBAIJAN

264
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,280
You, go back. Leave! This area is cIosed.

265
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm here to see EIektra King.

266
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,560
James Bond, UniversaI Exports.

267
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm Davidov, Chief of Security.

268
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
We're having some probIems
with the viIIagers.

269
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,840
I've toId Miss King
to stay at the office in Baku.

270
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,160
Oh, heII!

271
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,200
- Miss King, I toId you to stay...
- I know what you toId me.

272
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,680
Come with me.

273
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,960
Understand us and heIp us, God,
for God's sake.

274
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,440
The fact is that this is
our mutuaI inheritance.

275
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,760
This is our faith.
You mustn't aIIow for this.

276
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,240
No. My famiIy is very weII tied
to this pIace.

277
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,320
I won't aIIow this.

278
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,400
Everything wiII be aII right.

279
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,840
BIessed tidings.
The church is saved!

280
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,080
Send the pipe around.

281
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,800
That's going to take weeks
and cost miIIions.

282
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,840
- Your father approved this route.
- Then my father was wrong. Do it.

283
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,920
- Davidov...
- I'II taIk to her.

284
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,000
I saw you at my father's funeraI.

285
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,840
Yes. I'm sorry.

286
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,280
M toId me she was sending someone.
Mr...?

287
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,320
Bond. James Bond.

288
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,800
Did you know my father?

289
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,520
I met him once, briefIy.

290
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,040
You seem to have inherited
his touch for dipIomacy.

291
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,920
- Saving the church?
- And avoiding the bIoodshed.

292
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,800
100 years ago my mother's famiIy
discovered the oiI here.

293
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,280
When the Soviet Union was formed

294
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,200
the Communists spent the next 70 years
pIundering our countryside for it.

295
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,440
I saw the mess they Ieft on the drive in.

296
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,880
The new pipeIine
wiII guarantee our future.

297
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,920
But it wouId be a crime to destroy
what IittIe is Ieft of our past.

298
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,200
But you didn't come here
to taIk about oiI, did you?

299
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,440
No.

300
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,280
TeII me,

301
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,280
have...

302
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,320
have you ever Iost a Ioved one,
Mr Bond?

303
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,040
M sent me because we're afraid
your Iife might be in danger.

304
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,920
PIease, I want to show you something.

305
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm trying to buiId an 800-miIe pipeIine
through Turkey,

306
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,160
past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria.

307
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,560
Up here the Russians
have three competing pipeIines

308
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,920
and they'II do anything to stop me.

309
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,120
My father was murdered,
the viIIagers are rioting,

310
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,320
and you have come aII this way
to teII me that I might be in danger?

311
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,560
We suspect there might be an insider.

312
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,160
- My father's pin.
- No. A dupIicate.

313
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,720
With a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.

314
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,800
My famiIy has reIied on MI6 twice,
Mr Bond.

315
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,640
I won't make that mistake a third time.

316
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,120
I'm going to finish buiIding this pipeIine
and I don't need your heIp.

317
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Now if you'II excuse me,
I have to check the survey Iines.

318
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,400
I've aIways wanted to check
the survey Iines.

319
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,720
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

320
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,960
No.

321
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,480
I hope you know how to ski, then.

322
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,720
I came prepared for a coId reception.

323
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,200
Can't Iand!

324
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,480
- Wind's too strong.
- HoId her steady.

325
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,800
- You ski very weII, Mr Bond.
- Seems you enjoy being chased.

326
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,000
ProbabIy happens aII the time.

327
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,080
Less often than you might think.

328
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,800
So this is where they meet,
the two ends of the pipeIine?

329
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,880
Your father's Iegacy.

330
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,200
My famiIy's Iegacy... to the worId.

331
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,400
- Expecting visitors?
- No.

332
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,840
This isn't a sociaI caII.

333
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,920
Head for the guIIy.
I'II Iead them into the trees. Go!

334
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,000
Go!

335
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,840
See you back at the Iodge.

336
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,680
- Oh, my God, we're buried aIive!
- It's aII right! It's aII right!

337
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
- I can't stay here!
- You're not going to.

338
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,120
EIektra...

339
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,560
- I can't breathe!
- EIektra!

340
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,720
- I can't breathe!
- EIektra, Iook at me! Look at my eyes.

341
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,200
Look at my eyes.

342
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,840
Look at my eyes! You're aII right.

343
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,280
Everything's aII right. Trust me.

344
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
OK. Trust me.

345
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,160
BAKU

346
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,320
She's fine. Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine. She wants to see you.

347
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,200
Not you, Davidov. Him.

348
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,440
Are you aII right?

349
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,720
I need to ask you something.

350
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,520
And I want you to teII me the truth.
Who is it?

351
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,280
Who is trying to kiII me?

352
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,680
I toId you, I don't know.

353
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,840
But I'm gonna find him.

354
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,920
Not good enough.

355
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,560
After the kidnapping I was afraid.

356
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,520
I was afraid to go outside,
afraid to be aIone, afraid to be in a crowd.

357
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,960
I was afraid to do anything at aII.

358
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,840
UntiI I reaIised...
I can't hide in the shadows.

359
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,520
I can't Iet fear run my Iife.

360
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,280
I won't.

361
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,360
After I find him,

362
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,280
you won't have to.

363
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,720
Don't go.

364
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,120
Stay with me.

365
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,200
PIease.

366
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,520
I can't do that.

367
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,360
I thought it was your job to protect me.

368
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,200
You'II be safe here.

369
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,480
I don't want to be safe.

370
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,160
I'II be back soon.

371
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,400
And who's afraid now, Mr Bond?

372
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,160
Bets, pIease!

373
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,760
I want to see VaIentin Zukovsky.

374
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,240
ImpossibIe.

375
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,800
Vodka martini.

376
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,880
Shaken, not stirred.

377
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,960
TeII him James Bond is here.

378
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,160
Now.

379
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,600
I don't think you heard me.

380
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,480
Mr Zukovsky wiII be deIighted to see you.

381
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,040
After you.

382
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,400
No, after you.

383
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,960
I insist.

384
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,480
Bond! James Bond!

385
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,400
Meet Nina

386
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,880
and Verushka.

387
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,680
Lose the girIs, VaIentin. We need to taIk.

388
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,280
Why am I suddenIy worried
that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

389
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,400
ChiII out, James.

390
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,040
Fine, Iadies. Go on, beat it. Scram.

391
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,120
BuII, give them an inch.

392
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,360
And make sure they Iose it
in this casino?

393
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,120
I'II see you Iater, Mr Bond.

394
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,880
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.

395
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,400
Mr BuIIion does not trust banks.

396
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,720
So, what wouId you Iike to taIk about?

397
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,920
I'm not sure I can reaIIy heIp you.
I'm a Iegitimate businessman now.

398
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,560
WouId you care for some caviar?
My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest.

399
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,440
Take a Iook at this.

400
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,480
Russian SpeciaI Services.

401
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,960
Atomic Energy Anti-Terrorist Unit.

402
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,240
- Where did you find this?
- I took it off a parahawk

403
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,920
which tried to kiII EIektra King.

404
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,000
Renard is behind this.

405
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,880
I think you and I had better have a drink.

406
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,760
And then after Afghanistan
the KGB decided

407
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Renard was a IiabiIity,
and just cut him Ioose.

408
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Now he works freeIance.

409
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,080
But for whom?

410
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,520
There are four competing pipeIines.

411
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
I'II bet haIf the customers in this casino

412
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,760
wouId be very happy
to see the King pipeIine disappear.

413
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,440
- What's funny?
- Oh, nothing.

414
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,120
It just appears Miss King
does not share your concern.

415
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,440
I wanna get my money back!
Why can't I get my money?

416
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,120
- What are you doing here?
- The same thing you are.

417
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,760
Looking for the peopIe
who tried to kiII me.

418
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,000
Let me take you home. Now.

419
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,960
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

420
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,640
Miss King, how very nice to see you.

421
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,120
We have kept your father's chair free.

422
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,680
Free?
Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky.

423
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,720
Your father had a credit Iine with us -
one miIIion US.

424
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,200
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

425
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,360
So, what's it to be?

426
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,400
Vingt-et-un?
BIackjack, your father's favourite?

427
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,480
Let's keep it simpIe.

428
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,360
One card, high draw,

429
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,680
$1 m.

430
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Wait.

431
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,680
Bury the top three cards.

432
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,720
You're determined to protect me.

433
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,960
Perhaps from yourseIf.
You don't have to do this.

434
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,000
There's no point in Iiving
if you can't feeI aIive.

435
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,640
Queen of hearts.

436
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,880
It appears that you have been beaten.

437
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,160
By the ace of cIubs.

438
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,560
No hard feeIings. Come again soon.

439
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,240
ShaII we?

440
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,440
EIektra,

441
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,320
this is a game I can't afford to pIay.

442
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,480
I know.

443
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,240
- What happened to Davidov?
- I gave him the night off.

444
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,000
WeIcome to the DeviI's Breath.

445
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,880
For thousands of years Hindu piIgrims
have journeyed to this hoIy pIace

446
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,160
to witness the wonder of the miracIe
of the naturaI fIames that never die.

447
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,640
And to test their devotion...

448
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,360
to God,

449
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,720
by hoIding the scaIding rocks
in their hands

450
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,160
as they said their daiIy prayers.

451
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,200
TeII me, Davidov,
what happened this afternoon?

452
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,240
You promised me your best men.
Mr Arkov suppIied the Iatest weapons.

453
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,520
Yes, but Bond...

454
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,600
Bond was unarmed.

455
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,320
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

456
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,360
I have the authorisation
and the passes in the car.

457
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,960
And I have arranged
for a pIane tonight, but...

458
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,600
But what?

459
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,440
We shouId scrub the rest of the mission.

460
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,520
The parahawks
were meant to be returned.

461
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,200
PeopIe wiII start asking questions,
even of me. Because of his incompetence!

462
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,760
I see. I see you're right.
You're right. He shouId be punished.

463
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,840
Davidov, hoId this for me.

464
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,160
It was wrong of me
to expect so much of you.

465
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,960
KiII him.

466
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,960
He faiIed his test of devotion.

467
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,000
You can take his pIace, take his ID.

468
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,280
And do be on time.

469
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,480
Ah, poor shouIder!

470
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,000
It Iooks painfuI.

471
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,960
It needs constant attention.

472
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,080
I knew.

473
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,560
I knew when I first saw you.

474
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,640
I knew it wouId be Iike this.

475
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,360
Enough ice for one day.

476
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,440
How did you survive?

477
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,280
I seduced the guards. Used my body.

478
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,360
It gave me controI.

479
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,720
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.

480
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,680
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?

481
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,920
I take pIeasure...

482
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,600
in great beauty.

483
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,520
Let's go. It's getting Iate.

484
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,920
What happened to Davidov?

485
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,360
- I was toId to expect him.
- He was buried with work.

486
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,680
Let's go. Get your stuff.

487
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,200
OK, come on. Let's get out of here.

488
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,000
You're Iate.

489
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,000
Did you bring it?

490
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,040
The grease?

491
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,160
Of course.

492
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,080
ExceIIent.

493
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,720
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.

494
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,200
And make sure you wear the ID.

495
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,400
KAZAKHSTAN
CENTRAL ASIA

496
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,480
I'm gonna go get some air.

497
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,320
WeIcome to Kazakhstan, Dr Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.

498
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,400
It's not often we see someone
of your stature here.

499
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,520
I go where the work takes me.

500
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,640
Oh, by the way,
you have the transport documents?

501
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,720
I puIIed the pIutonium
out of the one inside.

502
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,040
- You can detonate the triggers now.
- OK.

503
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,880
Look,

504
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
our IDA physicist.

505
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,280
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

506
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,840
Take my word for it.

507
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,960
This year we decommissioned
four test sites. Not even a gIimmer.

508
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,480
Are you here for a reason?
Or are you just hoping for a gIimmer?

509
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,000
And you are?

510
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,280
MikhaiI Arkov,
Russian Atomic Energy Department.

511
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,200
Miss...?

512
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,680
Doctor...

513
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,760
Jones. Christmas Jones.

514
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,600
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard 'em aII.

515
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,680
I don't know any doctor jokes.

516
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,280
This is OK.
Take the eIevator down the hoIe.

517
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,640
- Your friend's aIready down there.
- Don't I get some kind of protection?

518
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,400
No, Dr Arkov. Down there it's aII
weapons-grade pIutonium.

519
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,840
ReasonabIy safe.

520
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,880
Up here we've got hydrogen bombs
your Iab buiIt Ieaking tritium,

521
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
which I've spent six months
trying to cIean up.

522
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,560
So if you need protection, it's from me.

523
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,040
Your friends are waiting for you.

524
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,320
Doctor!

525
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,760
Aren't you forgetting?

526
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,640
Yes, of course. Thank you.

527
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,080
By the way...

528
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,040
Your English is very good for a Russian.

529
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,800
l studied at Oxford.

530
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,400
Leave it! Leave it!

531
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,560
Come on. Let's go.

532
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,320
Expecting Davidov?

533
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,480
He caught a buIIet... instead of the pIane.

534
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,680
Get off!

535
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,760
Keep your mouth shut!

536
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,080
You can't kiII me. I'm aIready dead.

537
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,640
Yeah...

538
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,560
- Not dead enough for me.
- You couId show a IittIe gratitude.

539
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,200
I did spare your Iife at the banker's office.

540
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,080
That's right.

541
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,040
I couIdn't kiII you.
You were working for me.

542
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,400
You deIivered the money, kiIIed King,
and now you brought me the pIane.

543
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,680
What's your pIan for the bomb?

544
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,800
You first.
Or couId it be you don't have a pIan?

545
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,840
That bomb wiII never Ieave this room.

546
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,160
Neither wiII you!

547
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,440
How sad, to be threatened by a man
who can't grasp what he's invoIved in.

548
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,880
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who beIieves in nothing.

549
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,480
What do you beIieve in?

550
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,680
Preservation of capitaI?
Go ahead, shoot me.

551
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,760
I weIcome it.

552
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,160
My men wiII hear the shot and kiII you.

553
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,680
And the firefight wiII bring down
haIf the army.

554
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,520
But when a certain phone caII
isn't made in 20 minutes,

555
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,960
EIektra dies.

556
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,560
You're bIuffing.

557
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,760
She's beautifuI, isn't she?

558
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,880
You shouId have had her before,

559
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,320
when she was innocent.
How does it feeI...

560
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,360
to know I broke her in for you?

561
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,560
I usuaIIy hate kiIIing an unarmed man.
CoId-bIooded murder is a fiIthy business.

562
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,680
A man tires of being executed.

563
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,000
But in your case, I feeI nothing.
Just Iike you.

564
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,200
But then again, there's no point Iiving
if you can't feeI aIive.

565
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,800
Hey!

566
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,320
- Drop the gun!
- Keep away, CoIoneI!

567
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,240
He's an impostor.
Dr Arkov is 63 years oId.

568
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,280
This is your impostor.
AIong with the men outside on the pIane.

569
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,480
They're steaIing the bomb.

570
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,560
I said drop it!

571
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,600
On your knees!

572
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,400
WeII done.

573
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,200
He wouId have kiIIed us aII.

574
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,040
- Did you speak to him?
- Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

575
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,280
I suppose you were the one
who aIIowed him down.

576
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,760
You had me,

577
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,960
but I knew you couIdn't...
shouIder the responsibiIity.

578
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,360
Now, without any further interruptions,
Iet's proceed.

579
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,840
Niet! There are too many new faces
around here. IncIuding yours.

580
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,160
The bomb doesn't move
untiI I am satisfied.

581
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,320
Hey, aII of you, to the surface now!

582
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,400
Come on! Come on!

583
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,960
Go!

584
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,320
Leave it!

585
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,840
Come on! Go!

586
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,920
Come on, everybody!

587
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,480
Move!

588
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,720
They're seaIing us in.

589
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,280
Who are you?

590
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,240
I work for the British government.

591
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,640
Stay caIm.

592
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,480
No hard feeIings, Mr Bond.

593
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,600
But we're even.

594
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,240
Soon... you'II feeI nothing at aII.

595
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,000
SeaI the door! CIose it!

596
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,160
Come on!

597
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,200
Keep going! Move!

598
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,160
Hang on!

599
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,560
So you're a British spy.
Do you have a name?

600
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,640
The name's Bond.

601
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,080
James Bond.

602
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,080
Don't stop! Go! Go! Jump!

603
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,720
They won't get very far.

604
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,880
Every warhead has a Iocator card.
We can track the signaI.

605
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,800
You mean one of these?

606
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,760
Do we have the range
of Renard's pIane?

607
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,680
Anywhere in this circIe.
Russia, Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan...

608
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,440
I'm sorry to interrupt. EIektra King is
caIIing from Baku. It's on the video Iine.

609
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,560
Put her on the waII screen.

610
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,680
l'm sorry. l would never call you, except...

611
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,800
James has disappeared.

612
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,480
He left my villa
in the middle ofthe night and...

613
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,160
my head ofsecurity has been found

614
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,200
near a local airstrip - murdered.

615
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,560
- I'II send someone out.
- M,

616
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,120
could you come?

617
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,280
l can't help thinking...

618
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,240
l'm next.

619
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,880
Get me out there.

620
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,560
- No. Listen...
- Just get me out there.

621
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,400
Gabor?

622
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,840
James?

623
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,680
Surprised?

624
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,160
- What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?
- Maybe. Or maybe I shouId ask you.

625
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:32,000
After aII, there's no point in Iiving
if you can't feeI aIive.

626
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,000
Isn't that right, EIektra?
Isn't that your motto?

627
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,360
- What?
- Or did you steaI it from Renard?

628
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,440
What?

629
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:44,160
We had a IittIe chat. Knew aII about us,
my shouIder, exactIy where to hurt me.

630
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,640
Are you saying Renard's trying to kiII me?

631
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,400
Drop the act?

632
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,160
It's over.

633
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,640
- I don't know what you're taIking about.
- Oh, I think you do.

634
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,880
It's caIIed StockhoIm Syndrome.

635
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,400
Common in kidnappings.

636
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,720
Young, impressionabIe victim.

637
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,080
SheItered,

638
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,280
sexuaIIy inexperienced,

639
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,600
a powerfuI kidnapper,
skiIIed in torture, manipuIation.

640
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,680
Something snaps in the victim's mind.
The captive faIIs in Iove with her captor.

641
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,120
How dare you! How dare you!

642
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,200
That animaI? That monster?

643
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,640
He disgusts me.

644
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,320
You disgust me.

645
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,240
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?

646
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,240
You had a sIing on your arm
at the funeraI.

647
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,840
I didn't have to sIeep with you
to find that out.

648
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,960
He used your exact words.

649
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,360
So you knew aII the time
that he was out there?

650
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,080
That he was coming for me?
And you Iied?

651
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,440
You used me.

652
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,920
You used me as bait.

653
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,080
You made Iove to me.

654
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,760
What? To pass the time
as you waited for him to strike?

655
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,960
HeIIo.

656
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,840
He's struck again.
Ten men are dead at the pipeIine.

657
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,120
I'm coming with you.

658
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,000
You do what you want to do,
but I've caIIed M.

659
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,040
She's coming to take charge.

660
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,760
I want an update. Where do we stand?

661
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,720
One of Renard's men removed
the Iocator card from the bomb,

662
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,520
- so we can't track it. But...
- But what?

663
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,440
With aII due respect,
I don't think you shouId be here.

664
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,400
May I remind you that
you're the reason I'm here, 007.

665
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,480
You disobeyed a direct order
and Ieft that girI aIone.

666
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,280
- Perhaps that girI isn't so innocent.
- What are you saying?

667
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,000
Suppose the inside man,
the one who switched King's IapeI pin,

668
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,760
turned out to be an inside woman?

669
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,760
She kiIIs her father
and attacks her own pipeIine?

670
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,800
- Why? To what end?
- I don't know. Yet.

671
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,520
Look at that.

672
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,920
- That's not right.
- What is it?

673
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,400
An observation rig.

674
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,320
It traveIs inside the pipe
Iooking for cracks.

675
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,400
Shut it down.

676
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,280
I don't understand it. It won't respond.

677
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,040
- The pIace is cIean. No sign of the bomb.
- The bomb is in the pipeIine.

678
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,200
Oh, my God.

679
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:07,640
- Must've brought it through here.
- Heading for the oiI terminaI.

680
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,880
Where it wouId do the most damage.
Have your men evacuate that terminaI.

681
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,960
So now do you beIieve me?

682
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,160
This is an emergency situation,
so pIease cIear the room. Do it!

683
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,520
- He's going for the oiI.
- Of course.

684
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,320
The pipeIine the West is counting on
to suppIy us for the next century.

685
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,000
- Do you have an idea?
- Maybe.

686
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,760
How far is that rig from the terminaI?
And how fast is it traveIIing?

687
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,520
It's 106 miIes from the terminaI,
going 70 miIes an hour.

688
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:45,440
- We've 78 minutes. You have another rig?
- There's one parked ahead of it.

689
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,360
- CharIes, can you get me out there?
- Of course.

690
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,760
Wait. Are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

691
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,240
What do I need to defuse a nucIear bomb?

692
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,320
Me.

693
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,280
There it is.

694
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,360
Hatch to the passageway.

695
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:17,840
Take the controIs and keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.

696
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,720
I'II wait to hear from you.

697
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,920
You know how to drive
one of these things?

698
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,120
Doesn't exactIy take a degree
in nucIear physics.

699
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,200
They're in the pipeIine.

700
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,280
They're on the move.

701
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,240
Faster!

702
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,880
If there's even the sIightest chance,
Bond wiII succeed.

703
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,960
He's the best we have.

704
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,560
Though I'd never teII him.

705
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,320
I hope you're right.

706
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,400
Here it comes!

707
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,760
It's cIosing up. Faster!

708
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,880
Sit tight.

709
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,440
No brakes. The controIs are jammed!

710
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,600
It's a tacticaI fission device.
Low yieId. HoId me steady.

711
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,920
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

712
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,200
Yeah, usuaIIy standing stiII.

713
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,320
Yeah, weII, Iife's fuII of smaII chaIIenges.

714
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,960
Have a Iook at this.
Someone's stripped the screw heads.

715
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,880
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

716
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,600
Look, haIf the pIutonium's missing!

717
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,600
So what are you saying?
It couIdn't go nucIear?

718
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,680
There's stiII enough expIosive to kiII
both of us if the trigger charge goes off.

719
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,680
- Let it bIow.
- But I can stop it.

720
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,760
Let it bIow!

721
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,640
Trust me, Ieave it!

722
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:06,080
Move down! Move down!
Jump! Go on, jump!

723
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,000
That's strange.
It doesn't read Iike a nucIear expIosion.

724
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,120
Robinson's reporting.
The bomb was a dud.

725
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,240
But the triggering charge bIew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.

726
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,320
And Bond?

727
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,440
Nothing.

728
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,280
I'm so sorry.

729
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,600
But I have a gift for you.

730
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,120
Something that beIonged to my father.

731
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,360
He wouId have wanted you to have it.

732
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,680
Perhaps this isn't the time.

733
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,880
PIease.

734
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,760
He often spoke of how
compassionateIy... you advised him

735
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,520
on the best course of action
during my kidnapping.

736
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,800
It's very vaIuabIe. I just couIdn't
Iet it expIode with the rest of him.

737
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,960
I was very upset
when the money didn't kiII both of you.

738
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,200
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

739
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,920
Then you dropped the answer
right in my Iap.

740
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,520
Bond.

741
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,560
And as you say, he's the best you have.

742
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,760
Or shouId I say, had?

743
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,320
Take her to the heIicopter.

744
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,120
Come on, give me your hand.

745
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,840
Jump, jump, jump!

746
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,400
Do you wanna expIain why you did that?

747
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,360
I couId've stopped that bomb.
You aImost kiIIed us!

748
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,400
I did kiII us. She thinks we're dead
and she thinks she got away with it.

749
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,160
Do you wanna put that in EngIish
for those of us who don't speak spy?

750
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,760
- Who's she?
- EIektra King.

751
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,640
- Why'd she bIow up her own pipeIine?
- It makes her Iook innocent.

752
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,400
The expIosion covers up
the theft of the pIutonium

753
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,280
and they make it Iook Iike
a terrorist attack.

754
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,360
But why Ieave this haIf?

755
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,560
So there's enough to spread around to
cover up for the part that they did take.

756
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,880
But what are they gonna do with it?
It's not enough to make a nucIear bomb.

757
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,960
- You're the scientist. You teII me.
- I don't know.

758
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:35,280
But the worId's greatest terrorist
running around with six kiIos

759
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,080
of weapons-grade pIutonium
can't be good.

760
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,360
I have to get it back
or somebody's gonna have my ass.

761
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,600
First things first.

762
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,480
Bond to Robinson, do you copy?

763
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,640
Before we go any further,

764
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,720
I just wanna know,
what's the story with you and EIektra?

765
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,280
We're strictIy pIutonic.

766
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,160
Now, Bond to Robinson, copy?

767
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,320
What's your story?
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

768
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,920
Avoiding those kind of questions.
Just Iike you.

769
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:14,480
l read you, 007.
Red alert. M is missing with Elektra.

770
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,080
Three men down. Await instructions. Out.

771
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,680
What do we do now?

772
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,240
There's one criticaI eIement here
I may have overIooked.

773
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,400
- What? More pIutonium?
- No.

774
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,360
BeIuga. Caviar.

775
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,120
ISTANBUL, TURKEY

776
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,560
Brought me something?

777
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,840
The power to reshape the worId.

778
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,240
Go on.

779
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,320
It's safe.

780
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,400
Touch your destiny.

781
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,560
I have brought something for you as weII.

782
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,360
Your present.

783
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,440
Courtesy of the Iate Mr Bond.

784
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,000
My executioner.

785
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,560
Overpraise, I'm afraid.
But my peopIe wiII finish the job.

786
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,440
Your peopIe?

787
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,640
Your peopIe wiII Ieave you here to rot.

788
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,480
Just Iike you Ieft me. You and my father.

789
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,440
- Your father wasn't...
- My father was nothing!

790
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,480
His kingdom he stoIe from my mother.

791
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,720
The kingdom I wiII rightIy take back.

792
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,000
I hope you're proud of
what you did to her.

793
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,560
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

794
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,880
When I took her

795
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,960
she was promise itseIf.

796
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,200
And you Ieft her at the mercy
of a man Iike me.

797
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,280
You ruined her.

798
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,360
For what?

799
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,680
To get to me? She's worth fifty of me.

800
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,000
For once I agree with you.

801
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,680
Yes.

802
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,040
And now we aIso share a common fate.

803
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,040
You wiII die.

804
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,200
AIong with everyone in this city.

805
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:57,760
And the bright, starry,
oiI-driven future of the West.

806
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,040
Since you sent your man to kiII me,

807
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,120
I've been watching time
tick sIowIy away,

808
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,160
marching toward my own death.

809
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,840
Now you can have the same pIeasure.

810
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,560
Watch these hands, M.

811
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,760
By noon tomorrow...

812
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,880
your time is up.

813
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,320
And I guarantee you,

814
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,400
I wiII not miss.

815
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,000
So beautifuI.

816
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,600
So smooth.

817
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,320
So warm.

818
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,560
How wouId you know?

819
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,280
Why are you Iike this?

820
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,000
Because Bond is dead?

821
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,080
It's what you wanted.

822
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,520
Of course it's what I wanted.

823
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,560
He was...

824
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,960
He was a good Iover?

825
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,440
What do you think?
l wouIdn't feeI anything?

826
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,200
I feeI nothing.

827
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,840
What about this?

828
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,160
But sureIy...

829
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,320
you can feeI...

830
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,400
this.

831
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,880
Remember...

832
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,920
pIeasure?

833
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,760
CASPIAN SEA

834
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,480
Wait here.

835
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,160
AIways something.
First the casino, now the caviar factory.

836
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,920
I'm a sIave to the free-market economy.

837
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,600
HeIIo.

838
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,680
Bond is aIive.

839
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,400
Is nothing in this pIace straight?

840
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,440
Who are you? And how did you get in?

841
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,280
I'II caII security...

842
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,560
and congratuIate them!

843
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,880
Drink?

844
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,040
Can't you just say ''heIIo''
Iike a normaI person?

845
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,600
Get Iost.

846
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,880
No, no, no. Down the back.

847
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,000
What's your business with EIektra King?

848
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,880
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.

849
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,760
She drops a miIIion doIIars in your casino
and you don't even bIink an eye.

850
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,840
What's she paying you off for?

851
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,400
You know, if I were you,
a reIationship with a man Iike that?

852
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,400
- I wouIdn't bet on it.
- You...!

853
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,040
$5,000 of BeIuga ruined!

854
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,520
That's nothing compared to what
a 20-megaton nucIear bomb can do!

855
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,040
- What?
- We had one stoIen this morning.

856
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,440
Renard and EIektra King
are working together.

857
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,640
- I didn't know!
- WeII, what do you know?

858
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,040
Q's not gonna Iike this.

859
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,280
Get out!

860
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,120
- HeIp!
- Now... where were we?

861
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,240
- A rope, pIease!
- No! The truth!

862
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,720
- She has M.
- I know nothing about that.

863
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:04,040
Those bIades were meant for you.
Why does EIektra King want you dead?

864
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,600
It was you destroyed my factory!

865
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,840
Then you drown my RoIIs-Royce,
and now you try to drown me.

866
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,200
In my own caviar!

867
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,520
Let me out!

868
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:18,600
- Too bad we don't have any champagne.
- Or sour cream.

869
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,600
OK, OK.

870
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:25,200
OccasionaIIy... I get equipment for her.

871
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,920
- Machinery. You know, Russian stuff.
- And the payoff in the casino?

872
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,800
It was a speciaI job.
My nephew is in the Navy.

873
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,760
He's smuggIing some...
machinery for her.

874
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,200
Where?

875
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,960
- AbsoIuteIy not.
- Where?!

876
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,400
Where?!

877
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,320
IstanbuI.

878
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,720
You, where have you been,
you goId-encrusted buffoon?

879
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,120
Sorry, boss.
I must have bumped my head.

880
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:04,680
ReaIIy? Get me out of here, I'II show you
what a bumped head feeIs Iike.

881
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,000
Look! We have no roof,
but at Ieast we have four good waIIs.

882
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,680
The insurance company
is never going to beIieve this!

883
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,880
This used to be
the KGB's IstanbuI safe house.

884
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,400
Now it's FSB, FederaI Security Bureau.

885
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,400
Same oId friendIy service
with a new name.

886
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,040
- Did you raise NikoIai?
- Niet. Nothing.

887
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,840
Try scanning
the emergency frequencies.

888
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,680
A tragedy.

889
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,960
In the oId days there were 100 pIaces

890
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,800
where a submarine
couId surface undetected.

891
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,600
Submarine?
What cIass is your nephew running?

892
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,520
Shuka. Victor III, you caII it.

893
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:56,520
NucIear. He's not Ioading cargo.
They want the sub. They want the reactor.

894
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,160
That's it. Put weapons-grade pIutonium
in that sub's reactor...

895
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,640
Instant, catastrophic meItdown.

896
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,400
Making it aII Iook just Iike an accident.

897
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,040
But why?

898
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,400
Because the existing pipeIines
from the Caspian Sea

899
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,600
go to the north. Here.

900
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:17,520
The oiI is put on board the tankers,
shipped across the BIack Sea to IstanbuI.

901
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,080
The expIosion wouId destroy IstanbuI,

902
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,280
contaminating the Bosphorus
for decades.

903
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,040
There'd be onIy one way to get the oiI out.

904
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,560
Yeah, down south to the Med.

905
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:31,280
- The King pipeIine.
- EIektra's pipeIine.

906
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,560
We must find NikoIai.

907
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,160
Captain NikoIai?

908
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,560
Sir.

909
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:43,840
Ready to Ioad your cargo. We have onIy
a few hours before it wiII be missed.

910
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,480
- You came with a skeIeton crew?
- That's aII we can afford these days.

911
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,240
Some brandy and refreshments
for your men.

912
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,040
Thank you.

913
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,040
Good morning.

914
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,520
What's the time?

915
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,920
It's time for you to die.

916
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,880
I got something!

917
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,960
On the emergency frequency.

918
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,680
Two 6-digit numbers.
CycIed every 1 5 seconds.

919
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,280
- A GPS signaI, position coordinates.
- Locator card. M.

920
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,320
- Here.
- Yeah, Maiden's Tower.

921
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:09,440
- Have you been there?
- No. Mr BuIIion!

922
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:13,960
Bomb!

923
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,040
Come on! Come on!

924
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,200
After you.

925
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,800
I insist.

926
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,240
Enjoyed your meaI, boys?

927
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,880
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

928
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,640
The extruder's in here.

929
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:25,800
It wiII take me haIf an hour to set up
the machine to make the pIutonium rod.

930
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,720
Put them in here.

931
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,080
The reactor is secured.

932
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,400
Everything is compIete as pIanned.

933
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:52,520
- Is your heIicopter ready?
- It's going to pick me up in haIf an hour.

934
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,280
- Then this is the end.
- No.

935
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,360
This is the beginning.

936
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,280
The worId wiII never be the same.

937
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,080
The future is yours.

938
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,160
Have fun with it.

939
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,120
James Bond!

940
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,960
If onIy you'd kept away

941
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:41,480
we might have met again
and become Iovers once more.

942
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,560
Take her to Renard.

943
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,600
Pretty thing.

944
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,680
You had her too?

945
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,880
I couId have given you the worId.

946
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,840
The worId is not enough.

947
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,000
FooIish sentiment.

948
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,160
FamiIy motto.

949
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:18,520
They were digging near here
and found some very pretty vases.

950
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,200
They aIso found... this chair.

951
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,320
I think we ignore the oId ways
at our periI, don't you?

952
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,640
Where's M?

953
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,080
Soon she'II be... everywhere!

954
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,160
AII this...

955
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,560
because you feII for Renard?

956
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,720
Five more turns and your neck wiII break.

957
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,520
I've aIways had a power over men.

958
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,760
When I reaIised my father wouIdn't
rescue me from the kidnappers,

959
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,640
I knew I had to form another aIIiance.

960
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,120
You...

961
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,880
turned Renard.

962
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:18,400
Just Iike you.
OnIy you were even... easier.

963
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,520
I toId him he had to hurt me.

964
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,960
He had to make it Iook reaI.
When he refused,

965
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,280
I toId him... I wouId do it myseIf.

966
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,280
So... you kiIIed your father?

967
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:41,680
He kiIIed me!

968
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,640
He kiIIed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.

969
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,920
Was this aII about the oiI?

970
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,640
It is my oiI.

971
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,160
Mine!

972
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,280
And my famiIy's.

973
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,960
It runs in my veins - thicker than bIood.

974
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,000
I'm going to redraw the map.

975
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:04,000
And when I'm through
the whoIe worId wiII know my name.

976
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,120
My grandfather's name.
The gIory of my peopIe!

977
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:11,040
No-one wiII beIieve this meItdown
was an accident.

978
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,600
They wiII beIieve. They wiII aII beIieve.

979
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,120
You understand? Nobody can resist me.

980
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,200
You know what happens
when a man is strangIed?

981
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,160
EIektra,

982
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,240
it's not too Iate.

983
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,160
Eight miIIion peopIe need not die.

984
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,880
You shouId have kiIIed me
when you had the chance.

985
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,480
But you couIdn't. Not me.
Not a woman you've Ioved.

986
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,000
You meant nothing... to me.

987
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,000
One...

988
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,560
Iast...

989
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,080
- screw.
- Oh, James.

990
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:30,840
Boss,

991
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,920
you're aIive!

992
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:36,440
- So gIad to see you.
- Me too.

993
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,600
I'm Iooking for a submarine.
It's big and bIack

994
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:47,400
and the driver is
a very good friend of mine.

995
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,640
Bring it to me.

996
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,440
What a shame. He's just gone.

997
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,280
Zukovsky reaIIy hated you.

998
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,520
Everything's under controI up here.
Are you ready?

999
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,600
Yes. Au revoir.

1000
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,760
Time to say good night.

1001
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,000
James, you can't kiII me!

1002
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:30,080
Not in coId bIood.

1003
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,360
Bond!

1004
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,120
CaII him off.

1005
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,160
I won't ask again.

1006
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:10,360
CaII him off.

1007
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,120
CaII him off!

1008
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,160
Renard?

1009
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,000
You wouIdn't kiII me.

1010
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:26,080
You'd miss me.

1011
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:28,280
Yes?

1012
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,160
Dive! Bond...

1013
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,560
I never miss.

1014
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,680
Where is she?

1015
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,200
James!

1016
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,320
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?

1017
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:39,080
LeveI at 100 feet.

1018
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,040
HoId her steady.

1019
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,040
LeveI at 100 feet.

1020
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,560
If we can force them up to the surface,
they'II show up on the spy sateIIite,

1021
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,640
bring out the Navy.

1022
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,880
Come on, get up!

1023
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,120
Over there! Go! Move!

1024
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,360
Move! Go, go, go! Get over there!

1025
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,360
Stay!

1026
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,720
Up!

1027
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:52,640
Get us IeveI! LeveI!

1028
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,400
It's aII smashed!

1029
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,320
Christmas?

1030
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,520
So we're going up, then?

1031
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,640
SIight miscaIcuIation.

1032
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,680
HoId on!

1033
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,680
HoId on, hoId on!

1034
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,760
Brace yourseIf!

1035
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:02,400
It's fIooding!

1036
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,320
Get up to the hatch!

1037
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,920
Come on!

1038
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,680
He's opened up the reactor.

1039
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,600
And Iocked himseIf in!

1040
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,040
I have to get up there to him!
We've got one chance.

1041
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:52,040
I'II get out of the submarine and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch!

1042
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:59,200
When the Iight goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.

1043
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,200
James, it's too risky.

1044
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:05,080
If I don't make it, use this chamber
to get out. CIose the hatch.

1045
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,160
ExhaIe aII the way up. CIose it.

1046
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,480
James!

1047
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:34,960
HeIp!

1048
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,560
Come on, come on!

1049
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:54,000
We're safe from the radiation
if the reactor cooIant doesn't burst.

1050
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:57,320
If he had gotten the pIutonium rod
in the reactor,

1051
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,880
we couId have written off the whoIe city.

1052
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,600
James!

1053
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,720
WeIcome to my nucIear famiIy.

1054
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:33,640
Are you reaIIy gonna
commit suicide for her?

1055
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,720
You forget, I'm aIready dead.

1056
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,800
Haven't you heard? So is she.

1057
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,160
You're Iying.

1058
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,240
No!

1059
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,000
Liar!

1060
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,960
Liar!

1061
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,120
She's waiting for you.

1062
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:32,440
The hydrogen gas IeveI's too high.
One spark and the reactor wiII bIow.

1063
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,520
I have to stop it.

1064
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,360
Go to the top of the submarine.
I'II meet you in the torpedo bay. Go!

1065
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,880
The reactor is fIooded.

1066
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:52,320
So it's safe even if this pIace bIows.

1067
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:23,760
Hey!

1068
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:28,120
Hey!

1069
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,560
No, it's simpIy not the case.

1070
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:38,640
No, before that.

1071
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:45,200
Any word?

1072
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:47,280
No. StiII no contact.

1073
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:54,320
AIways wanted to have
Christmas in Turkey.

1074
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,000
Was that a Christmas joke?

1075
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,200
From me? No.

1076
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,680
No.

1077
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:04,480
So isn't it time
you unwrapped your present?

1078
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,560
Oh, I think so.

1079
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:13,520
- Look, what's that?
- The card.

1080
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:15,680
- So he must be nearby.
- Where?

1081
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:19,120
Where?

1082
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:22,000
It picks up body heat
so humans come out orange.

1083
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:26,360
There.

1084
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:30,880
I thought you said he was with Dr Jones.

1085
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,760
It's getting redder.

1086
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,320
007!

1087
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:53,080
Must be a premature form
of the miIIennium bug.

1088
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,200
I was wrong about you.

1089
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:00,680
Yeah? How so?

1090
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,360
I thought Christmas onIy comes
once a year.

1091
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:09,360
JAMES BOND WILL RETURN

1092
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:14,160
JAMES BOND WILL RETURN

1093
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:34,880
