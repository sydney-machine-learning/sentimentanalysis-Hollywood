That is a cheap question, and

Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,

- The wages are a scandal, aren't they?
- They can be.

- Films, mainly.

Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies?

I mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid?

I actually walked into the loo with her.

when she started unbuttoning her jeans.
