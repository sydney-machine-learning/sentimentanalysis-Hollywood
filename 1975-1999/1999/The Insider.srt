1
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:41,278
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,458
<i>How have you liked</i>
<i>your stay?</i>

3
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,153
What I've seen, I've liked.

4
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,894
<i>Please to explain why</i>
<i>I should agree to interview...</i>

5
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:59,494
with pro-Zionist
American media?

6
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,164
Because I think
Hezbollah...

7
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:07,838
is trying to broaden into
a political party right now,

8
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:10,575
so you care about what
you're thought of in America,

9
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:13,516
and in America
at this moment in time,

10
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:16,577
Hezbollah does not
have a face.

11
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:20,785
- That's why.
- Perhaps you approve
journalism objectivity,

12
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,793
and I see
the questions first.

13
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:25,625
Then I decide if I grant
the interview.

14
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:28,165
No.
We don't do that.

15
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,566
You've seen <i>60 Minutes</i>
and Mike Wallace,

16
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,868
so you know our reputation
for integrity and objectivity.

17
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,343
You also know we are
the highest-rated, most-respected...

18
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:42,847
TV magazine news show
in America.

19
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:54,022
So, Mr. Wallace...
should he get on a plane or not?

20
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:59,024
<i>Tell him I'll see him</i>
<i>day after tomorrow.</i>

21
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,361
That's good.
That works.

22
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:08,903
You know, I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds odd, but...

23
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,513
Hello? Sheikh?

24
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,711
Hello? Sheikh?

25
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,927
- Norman?
- What? What?

26
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,362
Take your blindfold off.

27
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:41,865
<i>Welcome to the world.</i>

28
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,940
Fluctuating
all over the place.

29
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:54,418
Anywhere we shoot here, it's gonna
be portable gennies and we'll run cable.

30
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,593
- Hello?
- Mike, it's me.

31
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,498
We're on.

32
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:01,608
Hi, honey.

33
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,011
<i>- Hi, Daddy.</i>
- What's new?

34
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:08,109
- Miss Loughrey gave me a star today.
- Yeah? What for?

35
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:11,212
- For reading.
- That's great.

36
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:21,755
A little early for cartoons,
isn't it?

37
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,596
Okay.

38
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,936
<i>Deborah? Debbie?</i>

39
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,678
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

40
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:49,090
It's early,
isn't it?

41
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,254
Gotta take Debbie to ballet.

42
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:56,459
<i>Mommy!</i>

43
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,709
Sweetheart, come on.
Come on.

44
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,610
<i>- She was playing</i>
<i>with my Pooh doll again.</i>

45
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,445
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Breathe deep. Breathe deep.

46
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,482
Slow down, honey. Slow down.

47
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:19,421
Slow down.

48
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,653
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

49
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,195
- Deep breaths.
<i>- She was playing with the Pooh doll.</i>

50
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:29,495
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart.
He's dusty, and you breathed him in.

51
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,660
Okay? So, what's happening to you...
Look at me.

52
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:34,432
What's happening to you now
is cells called mass cells...

53
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:38,601
told your lungs, " Don't breathe
any more of that dust in."

54
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:41,167
And the airways in your lungs
are like branches,

55
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:45,147
and when the branches close up,
you get an asthmatic attack,

56
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:48,014
and we give you medicine,
and you get better.

57
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:50,553
Uh-huh? Okay?

58
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:52,555
Better already,
aren't you?

59
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,465
Okay, baby?

60
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:13,474
Can I go to dance tomorrow?
I-I'm better.

61
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:17,173
If you are, then I'll take Barbara
to soccer and take you to dance after.

62
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:19,716
I can take her.

63
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:23,311
Don't you have to
be at the office?

64
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:26,845
- Is there any more rice?
- Yes, it's on the stove.

65
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,429
<i>Do you want more rice?</i>

66
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,988
<i>- Maybe later.</i>
<i>- How about you?</i>

67
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,000
<i>- I'll take some.</i>
- Instant rice?

68
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,808
<i>Can I go over to Jeanineâ€™s house?</i>

69
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:49,313
- I'm sorry, darling.
Have you seen my coffee mug?
- Try the car.

70
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:14,762
Um, what are
those boxes?

71
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,831
- I'm going to the store.
You need anything?
- What do you need at the store?

72
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,002
- Soy sauce.
- Right now?

73
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,011
That's my stuff
from the office.

74
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,673
Why did you take
your stuff from the office?

75
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,445
- I didn't want to leave it there.
- I don't understand.

76
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:34,216
I got fired
this morning.

77
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,318
Where else am I
gonna take it?

78
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:40,831
Why?
Who said?

79
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:42,832
Thomas Sandefur.

80
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:50,899
What are we
supposed to do?

81
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:54,741
What about our medical coverage?
What about our health?

82
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:59,545
What about our... car payments?
The payments on this house?

83
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:10,317
The severance agreement
includes cash payoffs over time...

84
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:13,158
and continuing
medical coverage.

85
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,698
Sure you don't need anything?

86
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,030
No, thank you.

87
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:28,573
Jeffrey?

88
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:50,626
I am very pleased to receive you
as my guest, Mr. Wallace.

89
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:54,832
- Well, thank you for having us.
<i>- Think I got a problem with the gennie.</i>

90
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:56,840
I gotta go outside.

91
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,709
Give me a hand with this,
will you?

92
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,717
Norman!

93
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:13,485
- He says, uh, you must not sit so close.
- What?

94
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,257
I can't conduct an interview
from back there.

95
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:24,401
You must move back
your chair.

96
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:27,131
Well, you tell him that when
I conduct an interview,

97
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:30,402
I sit anywhere
I damn please.

98
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,007
- There is no interview.
- You!

99
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:45,249
I'm talking to you! What the hell do
you think I am, a 78-year-old assassin?

100
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:48,690
You think I'm gonna karate him
to death with this notepad?

101
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,724
- Are you interpreting what I'm saying?
- Yes.

102
00:13:57,802 --> 00:14:01,568
- We're there.
- Good. Well, ask him if Arabic
is his second language.

103
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,869
Don't interpret that. Hold it.

104
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,502
Hold it! Hold it!
Slow. Slow.

105
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,240
Sheikh, do you mind?

106
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:12,078
If you would just turn
your chair a little bit...

107
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,846
to face Mr. Wallace.

108
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:19,513
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

109
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,855
Are you ready, or do you
wanna keep fucking around...

110
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,862
and warm up some more?

111
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,058
- No. I've got my heart started.
- Okay.

112
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,701
All right, Todd.

113
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,466
Give me the three-button
on Mike, please.

114
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:41,137
Good. Good.

115
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:44,477
Okay, we are rolling.

116
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:50,314
<i>- Okay, Mike.</i>
- Sheikh Fadlallah.

117
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:53,448
Thank you so much for seeing us.
Are you a terrorist?

118
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:58,761
Mr. Wallace, I am
a servant of God.

119
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,924
A servant of God?
Really?

120
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,367
Americans believe that you...
as an Islamic fundamentalist...

121
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:11,102
that you are a leader who contributed
to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy.

122
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:37,767
Everybody thinks Canadian Mounties ride
horses and rescue ladies from rapids.

123
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:41,202
Mike, they backed locals
in Oka in a fight with Mohawks...

124
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:43,706
over building a golf course
on their burial site,

125
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:46,471
They beat up protesters at Kanasake...

126
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,880
- Where'd you hear that?
- Hello.

127
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:54,816
Oh, someone took a poll?
"Are all things Canadian boring?"

128
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:57,184
- It's Stuart. He's in Mexico City.
- Oh. Let me call you back.

129
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,622
Yeah, Stuart?

130
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,456
- What New York bank?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

131
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:06,725
Will he go on camera and talk
about the Mexico City branch?

132
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,925
- Hey, Jake.
- Whose money are they laundering?

133
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,197
- No classes this morning?
- I don't have to be there till 10:30.

134
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,797
<i>- Hey, Mom. Hello.</i>
- Hi, sweetheart.

135
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:22,472
- Hello? Yeah.
- Do independent sources corroborate?

136
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:30,148
<i>- Dad, you got a box out here.</i>
- Let me see this a second.

137
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:33,850
- 'Cause I gotta know where
you're going at all times.

138
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>I can't. I've gotta fly</i>
<i>to Boston tomorrow.</i>

139
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,805
2:00 P.M. Great.

140
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,641
- Bye-bye.
- "Ignition propensity."

141
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:57,078
You understand
any of this?

142
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,644
No.

143
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,619
Uh, this looks like
a table of temperatures.

144
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:10,218
- Who's this from?
- It's anonymous.

145
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:12,854
References to "P.M."

146
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,955
It's gotta be
Phillip Morris, huh?

147
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,899
Hmm. I have to
take a shower.

148
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,417
Yeah?

149
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,457
Hi. This is
Doug Oliver.

150
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,652
Oh, hi, Doug.
It's Lowell.

151
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:46,390
I'm doing this story on fire
safety, and people burning up
from falling asleep smoking.

152
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:50,924
I receive a shitload of scientific
papers from inside Phillip Morris.

153
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:54,165
Anonymous. You or anybody
in F.D.A. Know someone...

154
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,934
who can translate this stuff
into English for me?

155
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,135
Uh, yeah.

156
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:19,187
- Hello?
- Uh, Mr. Wigand, please?

157
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,301
Someone's calling
for Daddy, Mom.

158
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:28,736
- Oh. Thank you, Bob.
- Who's calling?

159
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,001
Uh, my name
is Lowell Bergman.

160
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:35,774
- Did you say "Berman"?
- No, Bergman. B-E-R-G-M-A-N.

161
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:38,371
- I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>
<i>- 60 Minutes?</i>

162
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:41,418
- Yeah.
<i>- 60 Minutes,</i> the television show?

163
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:44,886
- Yes.
- He doesn't want to talk to you.

164
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:49,888
How does he know he doesn't
want to talk to me? He doesn't
know what I'm calling him about.

165
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,520
He doesn't care to know.

166
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:17,781
<i>This is the Wigands'.</i>

167
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:21,347
<i>If you'd like to leave a message</i>

<i>This is Lowell Bergman with</i> 60 Minutes,
<i>and I'm doing a story...</i>

169
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:26,521
<i>on fire safety</i>
<i>and cigarettes.</i>

170
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:29,691
<i>I have scientific documents</i>
<i>from a tobacco company,</i>

171
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,531
<i>and I could use your help</i>
<i>as a consultant...</i>

172
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,537
<i>explaining these documents</i>
<i>to me.</i>

173
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:40,510
<i>Now, my number is</i>
<i>area code 510-555-0199.</i>

174
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:45,345
<i>I'll be there at this number</i>
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

175
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:16,891
If you're curious
to meet me,

176
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:21,927
I'm gonna be in the lobby
of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville...

177
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:26,033
<i>reading</i> The New York Times
<i>tomorrow at 5:00.</i>

178
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:47,281
<i>Have you always lived in Louisville?</i>

179
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:51,486
Mr. Bergman, what did you
want me to consult about?

180
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:55,088
Who's that?

181
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:00,031
That's room service.

182
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:02,866
They usually
knock first.

183
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,134
Come on in.

184
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,301
Over here, please.

185
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:20,619
- Thank you.
- How do you like your coffee? Black?

186
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,682
Black. Black.

187
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,785
I really don't have that much time.

188
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,693
Is there anything you want to know
about me, Mr. Wigand?

189
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,894
Like what?
Your sign?

190
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,299
I know what I
have to know.

191
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:43,175
Just so I know you know,
when I talk to people in confidence,

192
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:45,180
it stays that way.

193
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:51,519
How did a radical journalist
from <i>Ramparts</i> magazine end up at CBS?

194
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:56,848
I still do
the tough stories.

195
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:59,292
<i>60 Minutes</i> reaches
a lot of people.

196
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:03,659
Let me see
the documents.

197
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:34,021
This is a, um,

198
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:37,998
fire-safety product study
for Phillip Morris.

199
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:42,026
Burn rates, ignition propensity,
things of this nature.

200
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:44,971
I could very easily explain this
to you in layman's terms...

201
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,975
because it's from
another company.

202
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:50,809
- But that's as far as I go.
- As far as you go where?

203
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,815
This issue is
a drop in the bucket.

204
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,908
I can talk to you
about what's in here, but I...

205
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:58,613
I can't talk to you
about anything else.

206
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:05,922
I signed a confidentiality agreement.
I honor agreements.

207
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:12,399
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
agreements, Mr. Bergman?

208
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:16,336
Between journalists and management,
yes, I believe they do.

209
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:19,738
But I don't take that seriously.
Where do you work?

210
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:21,743
Did work.

211
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:25,941
<i>- Did</i> work?
- How much would I get paid?

212
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:32,777
That you have to discuss
with CBS Business Affairs.

213
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:37,485
But for something like this, I would
say anywhere between ten, 12 thousand.

214
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,523
Should I just take
the documents now?

215
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,292
If you want to do it.

216
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:56,605
I worked as a, uh,

217
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:59,580
head of Research and Development
for Brown & Williamson.

218
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:02,140
Tobacco company.

219
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:08,118
I was a corporate
vice president.

220
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:11,958
Mr. Bergman.

221
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:41,356
<i>President Assad of Syria said...</i>

222
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:44,587
<i>that difficult obstacles remain,</i>
<i>but that his country,</i>

223
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,097
"looks forward to a great long peace
with Israel."

224
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:51,656
That's a Peabody, Mike.

225
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:54,828
When you're dead and buried, this is
the one they're gonna remember you by.

226
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,303
- Are you eating with us?
- Yeah.

227
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:03,106
- Bring a tie so they let us
in the front door.

228
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,272
Come on.

229
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:15,183
- Debbie!
<i>- Hey, Lowell.</i>

230
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:18,055
Oh, Bill. Main Justice is investigating
a major New York bank...

231
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,595
laundering narco dollars
out of their Mexico City branch.

232
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:22,722
- You want it for the news?
- What about you? You got a crew already?

233
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:25,790
- I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch you later.
- Okay.

234
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:32,807
- Debbie.
- How are you?

235
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:36,311
I want you to get Legal on a corporate
confidentiality agreement.

236
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:38,778
- Okay.
- Boundaries of their constraint,

237
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:41,783
Kentucky state law about...

238
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:43,785
<i>- I want you to drop everything.</i>
- Okay.

239
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,185
- I don't have any change.
You got some change?
<i>- Oh, here.</i>

240
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:57,088
Tony.

241
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:15,111
<i>Mr. Wigand? You can go up now.</i>

242
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,103
Sorry. I'm accepting
an award...

243
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:43,940
from the Retinitis
Pigmentosa Foundation.

244
00:29:44,012 --> 00:29:46,378
It's gonna kill
the rest of my day.

245
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,150
So, have you had a chance
to play golf?

246
00:29:56,224 --> 00:30:00,058
Jeff's a premier golfer.
What are you, a two handicap?

247
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:03,359
- Seven.
- And he gets out there...

248
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:06,093
and he has
five strokes on us.

249
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,432
He has more concentration
than anybody I've ever met.

250
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:12,962
It's spooky
how he can concentrate.

251
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,174
I'd rather play
than talk about it.

252
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,477
What did you
want to see me about?

253
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,484
I don't like
being back here.

254
00:30:24,552 --> 00:30:27,316
Jeffrey says exactly
what's on his mind.

255
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:30,323
Most people consider
what they're saying... social skills.

256
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:33,326
Jeffrey just charges
right ahead.

257
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:38,388
Now, I know you understood the nature
of the confidentiality portion...

258
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:41,333
of your severance agreement
with Brown & Williamson.

259
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:44,337
- Chapter and verse.
- Yeah, I know you do.

260
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:48,364
You know, I came up
through sales.

261
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:50,809
One of the reasons
I was a great salesman...

262
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:53,938
was I never made a promise
I couldn't keep.

263
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:56,745
I knew that if I ever
broke my promise,

264
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:59,514
I'd suffer
the consequence.

265
00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:01,452
Is that a threat?

266
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:06,158
We worked together for...
what was it, three years?

267
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:09,162
Now, the work we did here is
confidential, not for public scrutiny...

268
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,357
any more than
are one's family matters.

269
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:13,696
You're threatening
my family now too?

270
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:17,397
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

271
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:20,930
About the direction of research here,
we may have had our differences, but...

272
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:25,707
Research. You declare
as a badge of honor you don't
even know what makes water boil.

273
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,271
Well, that's why
we hire scientists.

274
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:31,648
Okay.

275
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:34,552
I don't believe that you can
maintain corporate integrity...

276
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:37,420
without
confidentiality agreements.

277
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:39,517
I was paid well
for my work,

278
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:42,620
the health and welfare
benefits are good,

279
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:45,063
the severance package
is fair.

280
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:49,092
I have no intention of violating
my confidentiality agreement...

281
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,799
<i>and disclosing that</i>
<i>which I said I wouldn't.</i>

282
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:56,676
I appreciate
all that, Jeff,

283
00:31:56,744 --> 00:32:02,307
but upon reflection, we've decided
to expand our zone of comfort with you,

284
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:05,477
so we've drafted a supplement
to your agreement.

285
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:10,187
<i>It broadly defines and</i>
<i>expands in more detail...</i>

286
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,226
what is confidential.

287
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:16,059
Nobody will be able
to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret,

288
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,690
I didn't know <i>that</i>
was a secret."

289
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:22,031
We're very serious
about protecting our interests.

290
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:24,867
We'd like you
to sign it.

291
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:28,568
And if I don't?

292
00:32:28,643 --> 00:32:32,101
If we arrive at the conclusion
that you're acting in bad faith,

293
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,116
we would terminate right now
payoffs under your severance package,

294
00:32:36,184 --> 00:32:41,315
you and your family's medical
benefits and initiate litigation
against you, Mr. Wigand.

295
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,726
<i>- Dr.</i> Wigand.
<i>- Dr. Wigand.</i>

296
00:32:46,794 --> 00:32:50,457
<i>If you've examined the document, you'll</i>
<i>see it's in your own best interest...</i>

297
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:52,658
and you'll sign it.

298
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:02,933
What you're saying is it isn't enough
that you fired me for no good reason.

299
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,035
Now you question
my integrity?

300
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:09,776
On top of the humiliation
of being fired, you threaten me,

301
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:13,184
you threaten
my family.

302
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:16,382
It never crossed my mind
not to honor my agreement.

303
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:19,426
I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur...
and Brown & Williamson too...

304
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:22,691
Fuck me?
Well, fuck you!

305
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,703
I'm not sure
he got the message.

306
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:38,506
Oh, I think he did.

307
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,721
- Yeah.
- You fucked me!

308
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:56,521
- Who's this?
- Protect your sources?

309
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,531
You screwed me.
You sold me out.

310
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:05,073
- What are you talking about?
Where are you?
- Fuck you too!

311
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:30,173
Stay away from me.

312
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:33,945
You stay away from me!

313
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:45,058
Jeffrey, you forgot
the lunches!

314
00:37:51,265 --> 00:37:53,529
<i>- Mrs. Wigand?</i>
- Jump in quick. Come on.

315
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:57,162
How do you do? I'm Lowell Bergman.
We spoke on the phone.

316
00:37:59,273 --> 00:38:02,299
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Good. I want to talk to you.

317
00:38:02,376 --> 00:38:05,277
- This is my house.
In front of my wife, my kids?
- I did not burn you.

318
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:07,541
I did not give you up
to anyone.

319
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:10,778
- What business do we have?
- I'm here to straighten
something out with you.

320
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,819
Right here, right now.

321
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:15,515
You haven't mentioned my name?
You haven't talked to anybody about me?

322
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:17,022
- What am I gonna mention your name for?
- Why are Brown & Williamson...

323
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:19,025
How the hell do I know about
Brown & Williamson?

324
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:22,551
It happened just after I talked to you.
I do not like coincidences.

325
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,565
Well, I don't like paranoid accusations.
I'm a journalist.

326
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:29,763
Think. Use your head.
How do I operate as a journalist?
By screwing the people...

327
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:34,069
who could provide me with information
before they provided me with it?

328
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:37,508
- You came all the way
down here to tell me that?
- No, I did not.

329
00:38:37,578 --> 00:38:39,637
Big Tobacco
is a big story,

330
00:38:39,714 --> 00:38:42,080
and you got something
important to say. I can tell.

331
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:45,710
But yes, I did. I came all
the way down here to tell you...

332
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:48,846
Story, no story...
fuck your story.

333
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:53,222
I don't burn people.

334
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:26,888
Ride with me while I
take the girls to school.

335
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:58,086
<i>My little girl has acute asthma.</i>

336
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,856
Deborah, my oldest daughter.

337
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:05,296
And I'm unemployed, so I have
to protect my medical coverage.

338
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:11,427
So I left them a message
this morning. Their expanded
confidentiality agreement...

339
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:16,270
I will sign it.

340
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:19,107
- They're afraid of you, aren't they?
- They should be.

341
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:28,719
Talk to me outside the zone
of your agreement.

342
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:32,850
- Like what?
- Like, uh, where'd you work
before Brown & Williamson?

343
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:35,225
Johnson &Johnson.

344
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:37,321
Union Carbide in Japan.

345
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:40,856
I was the general manager and director
of new products. I speak Japanese.

346
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:45,269
I was a director
of corporate development at Pfizer.

347
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,967
All health-related.

348
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:52,435
What else
outside the zone?

349
00:40:54,782 --> 00:40:57,376
I don't know. Do you think the Knicks
are gonna make it to the semifinals?

350
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,461
- Just give me an example.
- Okay.

351
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:15,399
For example, um,
James Burke.

352
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:17,561
- C.E.O. Of Johnson &Johnson.
- Yeah.

353
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:22,472
When he found out that some lunatic
had put poison in Tylenol bottles,

354
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:24,476
he didn't argue
with the F.D.A.

355
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:27,206
He didn't even wait for the F.D.A.
To tell him. He just pulled Tylenol...

356
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,649
off every shelf of every store
right across America, instantly.

357
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:34,881
And then he developed a safety cap.

358
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:39,550
Because as a C.E.O., sure, he's
gotta be a great businessman, right?

359
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:42,060
But he's also
a man of science.

360
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:47,430
He's not gonna allow his company
to put on the shelf a product
that might hurt people.

361
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,593
Not like
the Seven Dwarfs.

362
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:52,433
- Seven Dwarfs?
- Seven C.E.O. S of Big Tobacco.

363
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:54,598
They got in front of Congress
that time. It was on television.

364
00:41:54,674 --> 00:41:57,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swore under oath that
they know nothing about addiction...

365
00:41:57,443 --> 00:41:59,434
It was on C-SPAN.
Yeah.

366
00:41:59,512 --> 00:42:04,609
Okay, so, here you are.
You-You-You go to work for tobacco.

367
00:42:04,684 --> 00:42:07,585
You come from corporate cultures
where research...

368
00:42:07,654 --> 00:42:10,316
really creative thinking...
these are core values.

369
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,757
You go to tobacco.
Tobacco is a sales culture...

370
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:16,886
market and sell enormous volume,
go to a lot of golf tournaments.

371
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:19,227
The hell with everything else.
What are you doing?

372
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:22,029
- Why are you working
for tobacco in the first place?
- I can't talk about it.

373
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:24,831
The work I was supposed to do...

374
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:27,964
might have had some positive effect,
I don't know.

375
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:32,740
Could have been beneficial.
Mostly, I got paid a lot.

376
00:42:32,812 --> 00:42:36,077
I took the money.
My wife was happy.

377
00:42:36,149 --> 00:42:39,414
My kids had good medical,
good schools. Got a great house.

378
00:42:39,485 --> 00:42:41,715
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with that?

379
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:44,348
Nothing's wrong with that. That's it.
You're making money.

380
00:42:44,424 --> 00:42:47,086
You're providing for your family.
What could be wrong with that?

381
00:42:50,163 --> 00:42:53,929
I always thought of myself as a man of
science, that's what's wrong with it.

382
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:59,029
Then you're in
a state of conflict, Jeff.

383
00:42:59,105 --> 00:43:01,801
Because look,
here's how it lays out.

384
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,842
If you've got vital
insider stuff,

385
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,572
the American people, for their
welfare, really do need to know,

386
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:08,614
and you feel impelled
to disclose it...

387
00:43:08,681 --> 00:43:11,878
and violate your agreement
in doing so, that's one thing.

388
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:15,853
On the other hand, if you want
to honor this agreement,

389
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:18,186
then that's simple...
you do so.

390
00:43:18,257 --> 00:43:20,452
You say nothing,
you do nothing.

391
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:23,757
There's only one guy
who can figure that out for you,

392
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,663
and that's you
all by yourself.

393
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:34,932
I gotta go pick up the girls.
They only had a half a day.

394
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,056
<i> I've heard virtually</i>
<i>all the... We touched on it...</i>

395
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,861
<i>- Yes or no, do you believe</i>
<i>nicotine is not addictive?</i>
<i>- Congressman,</i>

396
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:06,132
<i>cigarettes and nicotine clearly</i>
<i>do not meet the classic</i>
<i>definitions of addiction.</i>

397
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:08,867
- There is no intoxication.
- We'll take that as no.

398
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:10,932
Again, time is short.

399
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,570
I think each of you believe
nicotine is not addictive...

400
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:16,012
<i>and just would like to</i>
<i>have this for the record.</i>

401
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:20,143
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

402
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:22,619
I too believe
that nicotine...

403
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:25,715
<i>He referred to this...</i>
<i>the Seven Dwarfs...</i>

404
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:28,784
- What Seven Dwarfs?
<i>- The seven C.E.O. Of Big Tobacco...</i>
<i>referred to this.</i>

405
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:32,888
Said they should be afraid of him.
I assume afraid of what he could reveal.

406
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:37,834
Now you tell me. What does this guy
have to say that threatens these people?

407
00:44:37,904 --> 00:44:40,065
Well, it isn't cigarettes
are bad for you.

408
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:42,403
- Hardly new news.
- No shit.

409
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:48,571
- What's this?
<i>- What that is is tobacco's</i>
<i>standard defense.</i>

410
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:50,582
It's the "we don't know"
litany.

411
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,484
Addiction? We believe not.
Disease? We don't know.

412
00:44:54,554 --> 00:44:57,387
We take a bunch of leaves,
we roll them together, you smoke 'em.

413
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:00,790
After that, you're on your own.
We don't know.

414
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,919
<i>So, that</i>
<i>tells me nothing.</i>

415
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,226
- Besides, you'll never get
what he's got.
- Why not?

416
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:08,358
<i>Because of this guy's</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement,</i>

417
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:10,800
he's never gonna be able
to talk to you.

418
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,498
That's not good enough.
This guy is the top scientist...

419
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:16,041
in the number-three
tobacco company in America.

420
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:20,068
He's a corporate officer.
You never get whistle-blowers
from Fortune 500 companies.

421
00:45:20,146 --> 00:45:22,842
This guy is
the ultimate insider.

422
00:45:22,915 --> 00:45:25,941
He's got something to say. He wants
to say it. I want it on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

423
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:28,145
Doesn't matter what he wants.
<i>Am I missing something here?</i>

424
00:45:28,221 --> 00:45:31,486
- What do you mean, Mike?
- He's got a corporate secrecy agreement.

425
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:33,787
Give me a break.

426
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,694
This is a public health issue, like an
unsafe air frame on a passenger jet...

427
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:40,562
or some company dumping cyanide
into the East River.

428
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:43,329
Issues like that.
He can talk, we can air it.

429
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:46,929
They've got no right to hide behind
a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.

430
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:49,668
They don't need the right.
They got the money.

431
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:53,109
The unlimited checkbook.
That's how Big Tobacco wins...

432
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:55,170
every time
on everything.

433
00:45:55,248 --> 00:46:00,413
They spend you to death.
$600 million a year in outside legal.

434
00:46:00,486 --> 00:46:04,422
Chadbourne-Park, Ken Starr's firm,
Kirkland and Ellis.

435
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:07,186
Listen, G.M. And Ford,
they get nailed...

436
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,252
after 11 or 12 pickups
blow up, right?

437
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:13,526
- These clowns have never... I mean ever...
<i>- Not even once.</i>

438
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,091
Not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness...

439
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,833
<i>related to their product have ever</i>
<i>lost a personal injury lawsuit.</i>

440
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:24,308
On this case, they'll issue gag orders,
sue for breach... anticipatory breach...

441
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:29,144
enjoin him, you, us,
his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian,

442
00:46:29,215 --> 00:46:32,651
tie 'em up in litigation for ten
or 15 years, I'm telling you,
they bat a thousand.

443
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:36,449
Every time. He knows that.
That's why he's not gonna talk to you.

444
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:47,397
<i>Okay, let's look through</i>
<i>the looking glass the other way.</i>

445
00:46:47,466 --> 00:46:50,060
What do you mean?

446
00:46:50,136 --> 00:46:52,502
We got a guy who wants to talk,
but he's constrained.

447
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:55,735
- What if he were compelled to talk?
- Oh, torture. Great ratings.

448
00:46:55,808 --> 00:46:57,969
What do you mean, "compelled"?

449
00:46:58,044 --> 00:47:01,207
I mean, compelled
by a, uh, Justice Department.

450
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,441
State courts.
Be a witness.

451
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:06,747
That would cut through any
confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?

452
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:09,185
- What does that do?
- What do you mean, what does it do?

453
00:47:09,255 --> 00:47:12,588
What I mean is like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?

454
00:47:12,658 --> 00:47:15,491
Because he has to, uh,
reveal it in a court of law.

455
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:18,325
It's on record. It's out.
It's no secret anymore.

456
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:22,231
So how can they restrain his speech
or retaliate? It's out in the world.

457
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:24,929
If you could engineer it into the
court record, you might have something.

458
00:47:25,004 --> 00:47:28,030
They would have a hell of a time
trying to restrain his speech
then, wouldn't they?

459
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:31,873
Yeah, but what venue? And where does
he get... Does he have killer attorneys?

460
00:47:31,944 --> 00:47:34,845
I don't think he's got
any attorneys.

461
00:47:34,914 --> 00:47:38,475
<i>He's gonna need attorneys who aren't</i>
<i>afraid of risking years of litigation...</i>

462
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:42,885
and millions of dollars
of their own dough in legal costs.

463
00:47:42,955 --> 00:47:45,446
What do you say, Mike?
What do you think?

464
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,551
Even if he gets
the defense team,

465
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:57,627
will he go for it?

466
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:06,871
You're awfully
overqualified, Dr. Wigand.

467
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,053
I'm trying to start
a new career.

468
00:48:17,957 --> 00:48:20,016
I believe I could be
a good teacher.

469
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:26,798
Let me give it
some thought.

470
00:48:31,337 --> 00:48:35,569
And not a lot of companies in the health
care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.

471
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:11,775
That's it.

472
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:23,020
It's where
our babies were born.

473
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:29,157
Debbie took her first steps
right there on...

474
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:33,197
In the grass.

475
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:39,863
- I didn't plan on this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

476
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:42,031
Come on. Come on.

477
00:49:46,077 --> 00:49:50,241
We can make this
work for us. Okay?

478
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:52,249
It's just...
It's not...

479
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:55,150
It's just...
It's a smaller scale.

480
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:59,122
Simpler, easier.

481
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,422
More time.
More time together.

482
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:05,759
More time
with the kids.

483
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,663
More time for us.
Okay? It's just...

484
00:50:11,503 --> 00:50:15,166
Can you imagine me
coming home from some job...

485
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,401
feeling good
at the end of the day?

486
00:50:19,878 --> 00:50:21,812
This is gonna be better.

487
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:26,814
This is gonna be better.

488
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:48,267

<i>- Welcome back.</i>

494
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,684
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?

495
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:36,880
Who's that outside,
Daddy?

496
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,854
- Did you see somebody
or did you hear them?
- I heard him.

497
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:46,089
- Where?
- In the backyard.

498
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:05,881
Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?
Why don't you sit up at the desk.

499
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,884
All right?

500
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:12,048
Get out some paper,
and draw me a picture. Okay?

501
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:21,725
What are you gonna draw me, baby?
An animal? Something like that?

502
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,963
You stay down here until Daddy
gets back, all right, Barbara?

503
00:52:25,036 --> 00:52:26,970
You stay down here.

504
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,661
You almost got
your damn head blown off.

505
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:08,438
Daddy!

506
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:13,341
It was just a raccoon, baby.
Nothin'.

507
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:15,902
They're nocturnal.
You know what that means?

508
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,414
That means that they
only come out at nighttime.

509
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:33,513
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

510
00:54:33,548 --> 00:54:35,530
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

511
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,898
<i>Is it too late?</i>

512
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:41,062
No, no, it's okay. I...

513
00:54:41,138 --> 00:54:43,072
How-How's the new place?

514
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,540
The new place?
New.

515
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:49,045
- You okay?
- Sure.

516
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:52,549
I was thinking of
calling you tomorrow anyway.

517
00:54:52,616 --> 00:54:57,280
- Uh, how's your kids,
uh, handling the new house?
- Good.

518
00:54:57,354 --> 00:55:00,585
- You got kids?
- We have a couple.

519
00:55:00,658 --> 00:55:04,617
One's hers, one's mine.
Everybody uses a different name.

520
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:06,629
Modern marriage.

521
00:55:06,697 --> 00:55:08,892
Uh, how's Liane?

522
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:13,933
Uh, she's okay. Uh...

523
00:55:14,004 --> 00:55:15,938
Hold on a minute.

524
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,114
Lowell.

525
00:55:25,182 --> 00:55:28,379
Somebody may be following me. I-I don't
know. They came on the property.

526
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:31,717
What do you mean, following you?
Did you call the police?

527
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:34,781
I-I don't wanna be paranoid.
I mean...

528
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:38,556
- Maybe it's a game.
Some kind of mind game.
- What do you really think?

529
00:55:38,629 --> 00:55:40,563
I don't know what the fuck
I really think.

530
00:55:40,631 --> 00:55:43,623
Are they doing it?
Is some crank doing it?

531
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:45,635
Are they doing it
to make me feel paranoid?

532
00:55:45,703 --> 00:55:48,604
Are they doing it for real and don't
give a shit what I think? I don't know.

533
00:55:48,672 --> 00:55:51,573
- I don't fuckin' know.
- Jeffrey, describe for me...

534
00:55:51,642 --> 00:55:53,610
in detail what happened.

535
00:55:53,677 --> 00:55:55,702
Well...

536
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,341
No. Look, I mean, there was
a footprint. Forget it.

537
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:01,907
It's probably
not important at all.

538
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:06,855
You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching
high school. Japanese and Chemistry.

539
00:56:08,893 --> 00:56:12,090
Uh, so, uh, what were you
calling about?

540
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:15,621
- You called me.
- No, you said you were gonna
call me tomorrow.

541
00:56:15,699 --> 00:56:18,497
- So, what about?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. I did.
I wanted to talk to you.

542
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:23,302
I wanted to hook up with you,
talk to you about what we were
talking about in your car.

543
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:27,376
Okay.

544
00:56:27,444 --> 00:56:30,971
It makes you feel good,
putting what you know to use?

545
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:36,452
- How'd you know that, Lowell?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

546
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,922
Hello?
Are you there?

547
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:44,460
Yeah.

548
00:56:44,528 --> 00:56:47,053
Look, um...

549
00:56:47,131 --> 00:56:49,395
Thanks for talking.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

550
00:56:49,466 --> 00:56:53,061
- I didn't know.
- It's okay.

551
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:05,413
Lowell.

552
00:57:05,482 --> 00:57:07,416
Who is this?

553
00:57:07,484 --> 00:57:10,078
<i>Do not call here!</i>
<i>Do not...</i>

554
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,646
What are you
gonna get us?

555
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:38,705
Tempura.

556
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:45,077
The Internet said you did
graduate work at Wisconsin,

557
00:57:45,155 --> 00:57:48,647
then went to U.C. La Jolla
with Professor Herbert?

558
00:57:48,726 --> 00:57:51,126
- Marcus...
- Marcuse. Yeah.

559
00:57:51,195 --> 00:57:53,493
He was my mentor.

560
00:57:53,564 --> 00:57:56,727
He had a major influence
on the New Left in the late '60s.

561
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,825
And on me, personally.

562
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:01,428
- Next to your father?
- My father?

563
00:58:01,505 --> 00:58:04,099
What the hell's that got
to do with my father?

564
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:08,370
I, uh...

565
00:58:08,445 --> 00:58:12,404
Is that why you became a journalist?
Then you get to ask all the questions?

566
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:15,850
You charge by the hour?

567
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,821
My father was a...
A mechanical engineer.

568
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:20,823
Most ingenious man
I ever knew.

569
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:22,916
My father left us
when I was five years old.

570
00:58:22,993 --> 00:58:24,927
He was not the most ingenious man
I ever knew.

571
00:58:24,995 --> 00:58:29,591
Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.
If you decide to go on <i>60 Minutes,</i>

572
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:32,932
I gotta know everything
about why you were fired.

573
00:58:33,003 --> 00:58:37,167
- Why?
- They're gonna dig up
stuff from your past.

574
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:40,802
They're gonna throw it at you.
I gotta know what they're gonna throw.

575
00:58:40,878 --> 00:58:42,812
You understand?

576
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:47,383
I drink.

577
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:50,147
- Couple of occasions
more than I should have.
- Um-hmm.

578
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:57,090
I was cited for shoplifting
once, but it was a mistake.

579
00:58:59,763 --> 00:59:02,732
Pushed Liane one time. We were both
stressed out because of the pressure.

580
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,462
She went to her mother's.

581
00:59:05,536 --> 00:59:08,505
I got, uh, fired,
because, uh,

582
00:59:08,572 --> 00:59:11,405
when I get angry, I have
difficulty censoring myself,

583
00:59:11,475 --> 00:59:14,342
and I don't like
to be pushed around.

584
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:17,869
I'm not pushing you around.
I'm asking you questions.

585
00:59:20,384 --> 00:59:22,944
I'm just a commodity
to you, aren't I?

586
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:26,387
I could be anything, right? Anything
worth putting on between commercials.

587
00:59:26,457 --> 00:59:28,857
To a network, probably,
we're all commodities.

588
00:59:28,926 --> 00:59:31,394
To me, you're not a commodity.
What you are is important.

589
00:59:33,297 --> 00:59:36,733
You go public, and 30 million people
hear what you gotta say,

590
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,361
nothing... I mean nothing...
will ever be the same again.

591
00:59:40,437 --> 00:59:42,632
- You believe that?
- No.

592
00:59:42,706 --> 00:59:45,470
You should. Because when
you're done the judgment...

593
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:49,535
is gonna go down in the court
of public opinion, my friend.

594
00:59:49,613 --> 00:59:52,207
And that's...
the power you have.

595
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:55,547
- You believe that?
- I believe that?

596
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,553
- Yes, I believe that.
- You believe that...

597
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:00,351
- because you get information out
to people, something happens?
- Yes.

598
01:00:00,424 --> 01:00:03,291
Maybe that's just what you've been
telling yourself all these years...

599
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,294
to justify having a good job.

600
01:00:05,362 --> 01:00:07,330
Having status.

601
01:00:07,398 --> 01:00:10,424
Maybe for the audience
it's just voyeurism, something
to do on a Sunday night.

602
01:00:10,501 --> 01:00:12,492
Maybe it won't
change a fuckin' thing,

603
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:15,060
and people like myself
and my family...

604
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:19,269
are left hung out to dry,
used up, broke, alone.

605
01:00:19,343 --> 01:00:22,335
Are you talking to me, or did somebody
else just walk in here? I never...

606
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:28,115
Don't evade a choice you gotta make
by questioning my reputation...

607
01:00:28,185 --> 01:00:30,585
or <i>60 Minutes</i>
with this cheap skepticism.

608
01:00:30,654 --> 01:00:33,589
I have to put my family's welfare
on the line here, my friend.

609
01:00:33,657 --> 01:00:36,285
- What are you putting up?
You're putting up words.
- "Words."

610
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,591
While you've been dicking around some
fucking company golf tournaments,

611
01:00:39,663 --> 01:00:42,530
I've been out in the world
givin' my word...

612
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:45,124
and backing it up
with action.

613
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:51,935
Now, are you gonna go
and do this thing or not?

614
01:00:54,678 --> 01:00:56,976
I said I'd call the kids
before they went to bed.

615
01:01:09,993 --> 01:01:13,952
<i>Stringer was supposed to be shooting</i>
<i>B- roll on street cops in New Orleans.</i>

616
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:17,401
<i>- What's with all the horses?</i>
<i>- Camera guy's got</i>
<i>a thing about mounted police.</i>

617
01:01:17,534 --> 01:01:21,061
Don't any of these guys
ride in cars? Walk?

618
01:01:21,138 --> 01:01:23,402
- How long are these things?
- What was he saying?

619
01:01:23,473 --> 01:01:25,941
Hello. Yes, I'm trying
to reach Mr. Richard Scruggs.

620
01:01:26,009 --> 01:01:28,443
This is Richard Scruggs.

621
01:01:28,512 --> 01:01:30,446
Can you hold on
a second, please?

622
01:01:30,514 --> 01:01:32,846
Lowell, got him
on the phone.

623
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:39,279
- Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.
- Hold on.

624
01:01:39,356 --> 01:01:43,122
Mobile Approach, this is
Leo-November-643. Over.

625
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:47,787
Request a flight level
of 220...

626
01:01:47,864 --> 01:01:50,458
on a heading
of 284 degrees. Over.

627
01:01:52,269 --> 01:01:54,294
- Mr. Bergman?
- Yes, I'm right here.

628
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:57,067
- Could you call me back on a hard line?
- All right.

629
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:02,703
- Area code 212-555-0199.
<i>- I'll call you then.</i>

630
01:02:08,752 --> 01:02:11,516
<i>What do we do with that?</i>

631
01:02:11,588 --> 01:02:14,056
I don't know.

632
01:02:14,124 --> 01:02:16,058
Richard Scruggs.

633
01:02:16,126 --> 01:02:19,357
You filed a lawsuit against tobacco
on behalf of the state of Mississippi.

634
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:21,363
<i>- Did you not?</i>
- That's right.

635
01:02:21,431 --> 01:02:25,993
<i>I'm working with someone now</i>
<i>who's the former head of</i>
<i>research at Brown & Williamson.</i>

636
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:28,663
<i>Former corporate officer there.</i>

637
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:30,706
What's your interest
in this, Mr. Bergman?

638
01:02:30,774 --> 01:02:33,072
Well, he may tape
an interview with us,

639
01:02:33,143 --> 01:02:36,476
and we believe if his testimony
showed up in a court record first,

640
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:40,573
<i>it would free him up from his</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement</i>
<i>and give him some protection.</i>

641
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:43,642
It could work. If it's public record,
it's public record.

642
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,018
<i>Yeah, and he's gonna need</i>
<i>legal representation.</i>

643
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:48,353
He sure as hell will.

644
01:02:48,425 --> 01:02:51,155
Has he decided
to go public?

645
01:02:51,228 --> 01:02:53,924
Because let me tell ya.
We been doin' this for three years now,

646
01:02:53,997 --> 01:02:57,558
and we've worked with a lot of corporate
cases involving whistle-blowers.

647
01:02:57,634 --> 01:03:00,899
So we know Big Tobacco will do
everything in their power to stop him.

648
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:04,031
So is your man
truly committed?

649
01:03:04,107 --> 01:03:07,440
Well, actually, no... Well, he's
on the fence. That's the point.

650
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:13,547
Well, we'd certainly be interested
in making his acquaintance.

651
01:03:13,617 --> 01:03:16,108
But without knowing
what he's gonna do...

652
01:03:16,186 --> 01:03:19,553
Would you want him to call you, or you
wanna call him? How do you wanna do it?

653
01:03:19,623 --> 01:03:22,490
It would be better
if he called us.

654
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,550
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right?

655
01:03:24,628 --> 01:03:26,858
Okay. Thank you.
Shit.

656
01:03:31,101 --> 01:03:33,626
We need cops on the streets.
We don't need them on horses.

657
01:03:33,703 --> 01:03:35,603
- I don't know what he was thinking.
- For God's sake.

658
01:03:35,672 --> 01:03:37,731
- This guy got a horse fetish?
- All right, all right.

659
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:39,968
Get me, uh...
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.

660
01:03:40,043 --> 01:03:42,273
I'll shoot
the fucking thing myself!

661
01:03:43,713 --> 01:03:45,647
- Have a good one.
<i>- All right.</i>

662
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:08,403
<i>What are you cooking?</i>

663
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:12,339
- I'm cooking pasta primavera.
<i>- Oh, I love that stuff.</i>

664
01:04:15,979 --> 01:04:17,913
I'm going to
have to go downstairs.

665
01:04:49,879 --> 01:04:51,608
Jeffrey!

666
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,829
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

667
01:05:15,905 --> 01:05:19,204
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

668
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:51,340
<i>- What happened?</i>
<i>- Dispatcher received a call</i>
<i>of shots fired in the area.</i>

669
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:56,072
Uniforms arrived on the scene, found
this white male subject shot to death.

670
01:05:56,146 --> 01:05:59,411
- Was it gang related?
- There's no indication...

671
01:05:59,482 --> 01:06:04,351
as far as a tag or an advertisement.

672
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,946
Yeah.

673
01:06:08,425 --> 01:06:11,121
They're terrorizing us.
Death threats. My family, my kids.

674
01:06:11,194 --> 01:06:13,128
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

675
01:06:13,196 --> 01:06:16,688
- Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
- Jeff, call the F.B.I.

676
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:19,030
- Right away.
- They do this with impunity.

677
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:21,570
- Jeff...
- They get to go home at night.

678
01:06:21,638 --> 01:06:24,300
What does it cost these people
to do this to us? Nothing!

679
01:06:26,342 --> 01:06:28,902
My girls are crying.
So fuck them.

680
01:06:28,978 --> 01:06:31,071
- I wanna tape. I'm done...
- I heard you.

681
01:06:31,147 --> 01:06:33,638
I gotta arrange
for a legal defense first.

682
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:36,811
I gotta get you to testify in court,
get it on public record.

683
01:06:36,886 --> 01:06:39,684
Then hold it off the air until you
got that, but I wanna go to New York,

684
01:06:39,756 --> 01:06:43,089
and I wanna go on the record...
right now.

685
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:47,391
- Good. But, Jeff...
- I'll call them, Lowell.

686
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:55,635
Did you handle the round,
Mr. Wigand?

687
01:06:55,705 --> 01:06:57,639
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

688
01:06:57,707 --> 01:07:00,301
We won't be able to lift
usable prints.

689
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:04,805
Do you own a gun,
Mr. Wigand?

690
01:07:06,015 --> 01:07:08,575
- A gun? Yes.
- What caliber is your gun?

691
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,987
What caliber is <i>my</i> gun?

692
01:07:12,055 --> 01:07:14,990
Yes, sir.
What caliber is your gun?

693
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:17,925
What does that have to do
with the price of tea in China?

694
01:07:20,897 --> 01:07:24,628
You think I put the bullet
in the mailbox myself?

695
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:27,261
If we could
take a look, Mr. Wigand.

696
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:42,451
Why do you keep this gun?

697
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:46,011
I don't think it's unconstitutional
yet to own a gun. I'm a target shooter.

698
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:49,183
That bullet was for a.38 caliber.
Do you own a.38?

699
01:07:49,259 --> 01:07:52,285
<i>Yes, I do. A.38 Target Master</i>
<i>in my gun safe downstairs.</i>

700
01:07:52,362 --> 01:07:55,456
A.45 Gold Cup,
a.22 target pistol. So what?

701
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:00,529
Do you have a history
of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?

702
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:02,662
Yeah. Yes, I do.

703
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:06,470
Yes, I get extremely emotional when
assholes put bullets in my mailbox.

704
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:10,639
I didn't tell you that so you could
pick it up and take it away.

705
01:08:10,713 --> 01:08:13,238
- Jeffrey!
- What's going on?

706
01:08:13,316 --> 01:08:15,250
I told them you had an e-mail
death threat that told you...

707
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:17,252
if you didn't shut the "F" up,
they were gonna kill you.

708
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,756
You can't take that. It's personal
property. My personal correspondence,

709
01:08:20,824 --> 01:08:23,554
letters to my brother, my will.

710
01:08:35,104 --> 01:08:37,038
You all right?

711
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,350
That computer has
every single...

712
01:08:49,686 --> 01:08:51,688
<i>You all right, Mr. Wigand?</i>

713
01:08:51,821 --> 01:08:54,722
We need to take a look
at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.

714
01:09:11,808 --> 01:09:15,767
I'm telling <i>you...</i> your agents
in that office are acting improperly.

715
01:09:15,845 --> 01:09:17,779
Now who are they
trying to protect?

716
01:09:17,847 --> 01:09:19,781
Let me, tell you something,
Lowell. Look, look.

717
01:09:19,849 --> 01:09:22,113
You're talking about two agents
in a regional office in Louisville.

718
01:09:22,185 --> 01:09:25,382
I got the goddamned Unabomber
threatening to blow up L.A.X.

719
01:09:25,455 --> 01:09:29,721
I gotta move 45 agents
from all over the country into L.A.

720
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:31,726
All right? When I get a chance,
I'll give it a look.

721
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:34,627
You better take a good
look because I'm getting two things:

722
01:09:34,697 --> 01:09:36,892
Pissed off and curious!

723
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:41,767
Now, any of these guys been offered jobs
in corporate security after they retire?

724
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,171
Either one of those guys got
ex-agent pals already in those jobs?

725
01:09:45,241 --> 01:09:48,506
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor
who's already at Brown & Williamson...

726
01:09:48,578 --> 01:09:50,637
as we fuckin' speak!

727
01:09:50,713 --> 01:09:52,647
- I'll give it a look.
- You're getting my drift?

728
01:09:52,715 --> 01:09:54,649
I'll give it a look.

729
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:58,485
So is everything okay?

730
01:10:00,089 --> 01:10:02,956
- How are the rooms? Comfortable?
- Yes, very.

731
01:10:03,025 --> 01:10:06,153
Do you know,
I enjoy your work so much.

732
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:09,756
When you're talkin' to somebody,
I always feel like I'm right there.

733
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:12,130
Thank you for saying that.

734
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:14,362
Do you think we could
talk about the taping?

735
01:10:14,437 --> 01:10:18,874
Tomorrow's taping? Just so we
can get it out of the way and order.

736
01:10:18,941 --> 01:10:24,004
Yeah, well, questions will go
towards what work you did there,
why you were fired and other...

737
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,674
Taping?

738
01:10:30,286 --> 01:10:34,382
- What are you taping?
- I'm doin' an interview.

739
01:10:37,226 --> 01:10:39,524
An interview?

740
01:10:44,767 --> 01:10:47,702
Do you know what
they will do to us?

741
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,738
I thought we...

742
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:55,677
I'm sorry.

743
01:10:55,745 --> 01:10:57,679
Liane, this is
a preliminary...

744
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:10,150
You didn't
tell her we were taping?

745
01:11:10,226 --> 01:11:13,992
What did she think she was
coming to New York for?

746
01:11:14,063 --> 01:11:17,499
Talk about it, think about it.
I had a plan to, uh, ease her into it,

747
01:11:17,567 --> 01:11:20,400
but I really...
I don't know how to do that.

748
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:28,669
Oh, man.

749
01:11:32,815 --> 01:11:34,749
Who are these people?

750
01:11:37,553 --> 01:11:40,716
Ordinary people under
extraordinary pressure, Mike.

751
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:45,392
What the hell you expect,
grace and consistency?

752
01:12:13,856 --> 01:12:17,724
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

753
01:12:19,262 --> 01:12:21,492
You heard Mr. Sandefur say...

754
01:12:21,564 --> 01:12:26,160
before Congress that he believed
nicotine was not addictive.

755
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:29,227
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

756
01:12:29,305 --> 01:12:31,239
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

757
01:12:31,307 --> 01:12:35,505
<i> All of us did. I mean,</i>
<i>there was this whole line of people,</i>

758
01:12:35,578 --> 01:12:38,103
<i>whole line of C.E.O. 's</i>
<i>up there swearing.</i>

759
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:42,241
<i>Part of the reason</i>
<i>I'm here is that I felt...</i>

760
01:12:42,318 --> 01:12:44,718
that their representation
clearly misstated...

761
01:12:44,787 --> 01:12:46,721
at least within Brown & Williamson's
representation...

762
01:12:46,789 --> 01:12:51,123
clearly misstated what is common
language within the company.

763
01:12:51,193 --> 01:12:53,593
We are in
the nicotine delivery business.

764
01:12:53,663 --> 01:12:55,756
And that's what
cigarettes are for.

765
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:58,095
Delivery device for nicotine.

766
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:00,101
A delivery device
for nicotine.

767
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:02,967
Put it in your mouth, light it up
and you're going to get your fix.

768
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:07,476
- You're gonna get your fix.
<i>- You're saying that</i>
<i>Brown & Williamson...</i>

769
01:13:07,543 --> 01:13:10,671
<i>manipulates and adjusts</i>
<i>the nicotine fix...</i>

770
01:13:10,746 --> 01:13:12,680
not by artificially
adding nicotine,

771
01:13:12,748 --> 01:13:15,774
but by enhancing
the effect of nicotine...

772
01:13:15,851 --> 01:13:20,288
<i>through the use</i>
<i>of chemical elements such as ammonia.</i>

773
01:13:20,356 --> 01:13:23,052
The process is known
as impact boosting.

774
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:25,821
<i>While not spiking nicotine,</i>

775
01:13:25,895 --> 01:13:28,830
<i>they clearly manipulate it.</i>

776
01:13:28,898 --> 01:13:33,301
There is extensive use of this
technology, known as ammonia chemistry.

777
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:36,930
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung...

778
01:13:37,006 --> 01:13:39,702
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

779
01:13:43,946 --> 01:13:47,575
<i>The straw that broke the camel's</i>
<i>back for me and really put me</i>
<i>in trouble with Sandefur...</i>

780
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:50,312
was a compound called coumarin.

781
01:13:50,386 --> 01:13:52,320
When I came on board
at B&W,

782
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:57,121
they had tried to transition
from coumarin to a similar flavor...

783
01:13:57,193 --> 01:14:00,822
that would give the same taste
and had been unsuccessful.

784
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:04,525
I wanted it out immediately.
I was told...

785
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,627
that it would effect sales, so
I should mind my own business.

786
01:14:08,704 --> 01:14:11,764
I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience...

787
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:14,571
continue with coumarin
in a product that we now knew...

788
01:14:14,643 --> 01:14:19,103
we had documentation... was similar to
coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen.

789
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:21,945
And you sent the document
forward to Sandefur?

790
01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:23,952
I sent the document
forward to Sandefur.

791
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,421
I was told that we would
continue to work on a substitute.

792
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:31,290
We weren't going to remove it
as it would impact sales
and that that was his decision.

793
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,022
<i> In other words,</i>
<i>you are charging Sandefur...</i>

794
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:36,030
and Brown & Williamson...

795
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:38,464
with ignoring health
considerations consciously?

796
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:43,734
- Most certainly.
- And on March 24,

797
01:14:43,806 --> 01:14:47,503
Thomas Sandefur,
C.E.O. Of Brown & Williamson,

798
01:14:47,576 --> 01:14:49,942
had you fired.

799
01:14:51,547 --> 01:14:53,481
<i>And the reason</i>
<i>he gave you?</i>

800
01:14:55,484 --> 01:14:57,679
Poor communication skills.

801
01:14:59,822 --> 01:15:03,417
And you wish
you hadn't come forward?

802
01:15:03,492 --> 01:15:06,086
You wish you hadn't
blown the whistle?

803
01:15:07,696 --> 01:15:10,130
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

804
01:15:12,034 --> 01:15:15,299
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

805
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:19,207
If you'd asked me...

806
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:21,903
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

807
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:27,840
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

808
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:04,211
- Hi.
- Hi.

809
01:16:04,286 --> 01:16:06,652
My name is Jeff Wigand.

810
01:16:09,224 --> 01:16:11,556
You can call me, uh,
Mr. Wigand.

811
01:16:11,627 --> 01:16:13,561
You can call me
Dr. Wigand.

812
01:16:13,629 --> 01:16:17,190
I have a Ph.D. In biochemistry
and endocrinology.

813
01:16:17,266 --> 01:16:19,996
You can call me Jeff.

814
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:24,500
Anything else you want to call me,
you'll have to do so in private.

815
01:16:24,573 --> 01:16:28,339
Um, okay.

816
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:30,640
I find chemistry
to be magical.

817
01:16:30,713 --> 01:16:32,874
I find it an adventure.

818
01:16:32,948 --> 01:16:37,317
An exploration into the building
blocks of our physical universe.

819
01:16:37,386 --> 01:16:39,877
So how many of you have
taken chemistry before?

820
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:45,883
Okay. I've never taught it
before, so we're gonna be fine.

821
01:16:45,961 --> 01:16:48,725
Our first experiment
is gonna be measuring...

822
01:16:48,797 --> 01:16:50,822
the molecular weight
of butane.

823
01:16:52,868 --> 01:16:55,496
He's on line three.

824
01:16:58,907 --> 01:17:02,707
- Hello?
- Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand.

825
01:17:02,778 --> 01:17:04,871
Lowell Bergman said
I should give you a call.

826
01:17:04,947 --> 01:17:07,438
My co-counsel,
Ron Motley and I,

827
01:17:07,516 --> 01:17:10,917
have filed a lawsuit against
the tobacco industry on behalf
of the state of Mississippi...

828
01:17:10,986 --> 01:17:13,511
to get the state
reimbursed Medicaid costs...

829
01:17:13,589 --> 01:17:16,183
for treatin' people
with smoking-related illness.

830
01:17:17,393 --> 01:17:19,418
If you'd be interested
in talkin' to us,

831
01:17:19,495 --> 01:17:21,861
we'd certainly like
to talk to you.

832
01:17:23,766 --> 01:17:25,631
When should we do this?

833
01:17:49,358 --> 01:17:51,826
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my house?

834
01:17:51,894 --> 01:17:54,454
<i>- It's okay, Jeff. It's okay.</i>
- Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

835
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:58,830
You've got
your own security now.

836
01:18:01,103 --> 01:18:03,367
You know, Lowell,
I can't... I can't afford to...

837
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:07,603
No, they volunteered.
A friend owns a large security company.

838
01:18:07,676 --> 01:18:10,770
<i>How're you doing, Mr. Wigand?</i>
<i>I'm John Telafarro.</i>

839
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:13,747
There'll be three of us
on the detail.

840
01:18:13,816 --> 01:18:17,843
I'm going to the store. Please explain
our new houseguests to your children.

841
01:18:19,621 --> 01:18:22,988
Mrs. Wigand's leaving the house.

842
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:29,961
Uh, I called Richard Scruggs
in Mississippi.

843
01:18:30,032 --> 01:18:34,492
- I heard.
- I'm gonna be a witness for them
in their litigation.

844
01:18:36,572 --> 01:18:39,097
So I'm gonna fly to Pascagoula,
give a deposition.

845
01:18:39,174 --> 01:18:41,369
I know. I'm gonna
go there tonight.

846
01:18:43,278 --> 01:18:46,008
<i>You all right?</i>

847
01:18:46,081 --> 01:18:48,606
- Did you have a good day?
- Yes, I did. I had a great day.

848
01:18:48,684 --> 01:18:51,278
<i>- Uh, coffee, Lowell?</i>
- Yeah, all right.

849
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:53,685
Wanna play that game
we were playing before?

850
01:18:53,755 --> 01:18:56,588
You know, I think you
got it up to five.

851
01:18:56,658 --> 01:18:59,024
<i>I was ahead of you,</i>
<i>and then you just...</i>

852
01:19:19,481 --> 01:19:23,178
Please don't wash your hands
in the sink.

853
01:19:23,252 --> 01:19:26,312
Where should I wash them?

854
01:19:26,388 --> 01:19:28,856
Use the bathroom.

855
01:19:28,924 --> 01:19:30,858
What's the difference?

856
01:19:30,926 --> 01:19:32,860
That's for food.

857
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:49,435
Leave it on.
Just leave it on! Okay?

858
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:48,898
I don't think
I can do this.

859
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:57,408
I want to stand by
my husband.

860
01:20:57,479 --> 01:20:59,811
I really do, Jeffrey,
but...

861
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:04,117
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

862
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:09,356
I am so sorry.

863
01:21:28,844 --> 01:21:31,677
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

864
01:21:37,219 --> 01:21:39,153
Yes, Jeffrey.

865
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:37,980
It's okay.

866
01:22:50,693 --> 01:22:52,718
Jeff!

867
01:22:56,433 --> 01:22:58,367
You've been served.

868
01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:13,576
Now, what this one is is
a temporary restraining order,

869
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,108
a gag order,
issued by a Kentucky court.

870
01:23:17,187 --> 01:23:19,781
Jeff Wigand,
Michael Moore.

871
01:23:19,856 --> 01:23:21,790
Good to meet you,
Dr. Wigand.

872
01:23:21,858 --> 01:23:23,849
<i>Mike's our attorney general</i>
<i>down here.</i>

873
01:23:23,927 --> 01:23:26,157
<i>I was just explaining to Jeff</i>
<i>they got a Kentucky court...</i>

874
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:29,096
<i>to issue a gag order</i>
<i>to stop his deposition today.</i>

875
01:23:29,165 --> 01:23:31,292
<i>- Right.</i>
- Now,

876
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:33,733
they tried to get
the Mississippi court to honor it,

877
01:23:33,803 --> 01:23:35,737
but the judge threw it out.

878
01:23:35,805 --> 01:23:40,606
However, for you, there is a more
perilous effect of the gag order.

879
01:23:40,677 --> 01:23:44,738
Dr. Wigand, you do understand
what can happen, don't you?

880
01:23:47,484 --> 01:23:51,716
I'm not free to testify...
here.

881
01:23:51,788 --> 01:23:54,586
That's right. If you violate
the Kentucky order,

882
01:23:54,657 --> 01:23:56,818
when you
step foot back in Kentucky...

883
01:23:56,893 --> 01:23:59,862
they can find you in contempt
and they can incarcerate you.

884
01:23:59,929 --> 01:24:01,863
And you ought to know that.

885
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:07,800
- Jail.
- Possibly, yes.

886
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:10,897
That is one of the possible consequences
of your testifying here today.

887
01:24:10,974 --> 01:24:12,908
That's right.

888
01:24:18,014 --> 01:24:21,541
How does...
How does one go to jail?

889
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:25,281
Wh-What does my family do?

890
01:24:25,355 --> 01:24:27,721
Go on welfare?

891
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:31,055
If my wife has to work,
who's gonna look after the kids?

892
01:24:31,127 --> 01:24:33,618
Put food on the table?
I mean, my children need me.

893
01:24:33,696 --> 01:24:35,926
If I'm not teaching,
there's no medical.

894
01:24:35,999 --> 01:24:39,901
No medical, even on co-pay,
that's like... Tuition...

895
01:24:39,969 --> 01:24:42,870
Dr. Wigand, listen.

896
01:24:42,939 --> 01:24:45,373
You may not be able
to do this thing.

897
01:24:45,441 --> 01:24:48,171
As I understand from Dick,
you're our key witness,

898
01:24:48,244 --> 01:24:51,680
and I hope
you don't withdraw.

899
01:24:51,748 --> 01:24:54,239
Um, I guess we'd all
understand if you did.

900
01:24:55,552 --> 01:24:57,645
Guys, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for court.

901
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,087
I'll see y'all later.
Dr. Wigand, good luck.

902
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,491
I know what you're facing,
Jeff.

903
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:15,538
And I think I know
how you're feeling.

904
01:25:17,407 --> 01:25:21,707
In the navy, I flew
A-6's off carriers.

905
01:25:21,778 --> 01:25:25,236
In combat, events have
a duration of seconds.

906
01:25:25,315 --> 01:25:27,647
Sometimes minutes.

907
01:25:27,717 --> 01:25:30,584
But what you're going through
goes on day in, day out,

908
01:25:30,653 --> 01:25:32,814
whether you're
ready for it or not.

909
01:25:32,889 --> 01:25:34,823
Week in, week out.

910
01:25:34,891 --> 01:25:37,553
Month after month
after month.

911
01:25:37,627 --> 01:25:41,154
Whether you're up
or whether you're down.

912
01:25:41,231 --> 01:25:44,166
You're assaulted
psychologically.

913
01:25:44,234 --> 01:25:46,566
You're assaulted
financially,

914
01:25:46,636 --> 01:25:51,300
which is its own special kind
of violence because it's
directed at your kids.

915
01:25:51,374 --> 01:25:53,706
What school can you afford?

916
01:25:53,776 --> 01:25:56,267
How will that
affect their lives?

917
01:25:56,346 --> 01:25:58,280
You're asking yourself,

918
01:25:58,348 --> 01:26:01,647
"Will that limit
what they may become?"

919
01:26:01,718 --> 01:26:04,414
You feel your whole family's future
is compromised,

920
01:26:04,487 --> 01:26:07,047
held hostage.

921
01:26:07,123 --> 01:26:09,250
I do know how it is.

922
01:26:23,706 --> 01:26:25,640
You attract a crowd.

923
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:27,642
Yeah.
Great.

924
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:32,639
I heard about
the Kentucky gag order.

925
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:38,753
I don't know what to do.

926
01:27:41,216 --> 01:27:44,515
Hold on a second.

927
01:27:44,586 --> 01:27:48,682
Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
expects his witness to appear or not?

928
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:19,285
I can't seem to find
the criteria to decide.

929
01:28:21,289 --> 01:28:24,588
It's too big a decision to make
without being resolved in my own mind.

930
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:29,897
Maybe things have changed.

931
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:53,053
A lot's changed.

932
01:28:58,326 --> 01:29:00,294
You mean since this morning?

933
01:29:02,597 --> 01:29:05,828
No, I mean since whenever.

934
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,440
Fuck it.

935
01:29:14,509 --> 01:29:16,670
Let's go to court.

936
01:29:16,745 --> 01:29:19,441
<i>Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.</i>

937
01:31:44,092 --> 01:31:46,526
Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down
at that table over there.

938
01:31:46,594 --> 01:31:48,528
I want to start
as fast as possible.

939
01:31:48,596 --> 01:31:50,996
I don't want to give them a chance to
get another restraining order. Okay?

940
01:31:51,066 --> 01:31:53,000
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Doc.

941
01:32:01,242 --> 01:32:04,905
Please stand.
Raise your right hand.

942
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:09,109
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

943
01:32:09,184 --> 01:32:12,347
<i>- I do.</i>
<i>- You may be seated.</i>

944
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:15,218
<i>You understand, Dr. Wigand,</i>
<i>you are under oath?</i>

945
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:19,317
This is a sworn deposition.
There's no judge. It's not a trial.

946
01:32:19,394 --> 01:32:22,557
Will you state your name
for the record?

947
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:26,168
Jeffrey S. Wigand.
R-E-Y. W-I-G-A-N-D.

948
01:32:29,671 --> 01:32:32,105
Got any idea what's
going on in there?

949
01:32:32,174 --> 01:32:34,108
No, I don't have
a clue.

950
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:38,812
- That is correct.
- In other words, it acts as a drug,

951
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,144
- Object to the form of the question.
- It acts as a drug...

952
01:32:41,216 --> 01:32:43,047
- Object to the form...
- It acts as a drug...

953
01:32:43,118 --> 01:32:45,211
- Object!
- Is there an echo in here?

954
01:32:45,287 --> 01:32:47,312
<i>Your objection's been recorded.</i>

955
01:32:47,389 --> 01:32:50,552
<i>She typed it into her little machine</i>
<i>over there. It's on the record.</i>

956
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:55,119
<i>So now I'll proceed</i>
<i>with my deposition of my witness.</i>

957
01:32:57,032 --> 01:33:00,331
- Does it act as a drug?
- Dr. Wigand!

958
01:33:00,402 --> 01:33:02,927
I am instructing you...

959
01:33:03,004 --> 01:33:05,404
<i>not to answer that question.</i>

960
01:33:05,473 --> 01:33:09,102
In accordance to the terms of
the contractual obligations...

961
01:33:09,177 --> 01:33:11,702
<i>undertaken by you...</i>

962
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:14,840
<i>not to disclose</i>
<i>any information...</i>

963
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:18,613
about your work at the Brown
& Williamson Tobacco Company.

964
01:33:18,687 --> 01:33:21,918
And in accordance
with the force and effect...

965
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:24,083
of the temporary
restraining order...

966
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,320
<i>that has been</i>
<i>entered against you...</i>

967
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:30,262
<i>by the court</i>
<i>in the state of Kentucky.</i>

968
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:32,994
That means you don't talk.

969
01:33:33,068 --> 01:33:35,093
Mr. Motley, we have rights here.

970
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:37,468
Oh, you've got rights.

971
01:33:37,539 --> 01:33:41,532
And lefts.
Ups and downs and middles.

972
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:46,309
So what? You don't get
to instruct anything around here!

973
01:33:46,381 --> 01:33:50,681
This is not North Carolina,
not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.

974
01:33:50,752 --> 01:33:54,153
This is the sovereign state
of Mississippi's proceeding.

975
01:33:54,222 --> 01:33:57,055
Wipe that smirk off your face!

976
01:33:57,125 --> 01:34:01,027
Dr. Wigand's deposition
will be part of this record!

977
01:34:01,096 --> 01:34:05,123
And I'm gonna take my witness' testimony
whether the hell you like it or not!

978
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,114
Answer the question,
Doctor.

979
01:34:21,182 --> 01:34:26,381
<i>Yes. It produces</i>
<i>a physiological response, which</i>
<i>meets the definition of a drug.</i>

980
01:34:26,454 --> 01:34:29,685
Um, nicotine
is associated with...

981
01:34:29,758 --> 01:34:32,192
impact, satisfaction.

982
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:36,822
It has a pharmacological effect that
crosses the blood-brain barrier intact.

983
01:34:39,768 --> 01:34:42,635
<i>Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.</i>

984
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:28,915
One of the reasons
I'm here is that I felt...

985
01:35:28,983 --> 01:35:32,248
that their representation
clearly...

986
01:35:34,489 --> 01:35:38,653
Run that Sandefur piece
on "nicotine's not addictive."

987
01:35:38,727 --> 01:35:42,322
Run that on camera, then cut right to
Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."

988
01:35:42,397 --> 01:35:45,230
Then go wide to the C.E.O. S
all taking the oath.

989
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,235
Then back on Jeff...

990
01:35:48,303 --> 01:35:50,897
and play the pause after
the word "felt" on the B-side.

991
01:35:50,972 --> 01:35:54,271
Hell of a show, Mike.
Explosive material.

992
01:35:56,378 --> 01:35:59,108
- It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
- Good.

993
01:36:00,382 --> 01:36:02,441
- I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

994
01:36:02,517 --> 01:36:05,850
They argued that he was going
to reveal the secret formula
of Kools to the world.

995
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:10,958
<i>Sealed doesn't hurt Scruggsâ€™ litigation,</i>

996
01:36:11,025 --> 01:36:14,620
<i>and since we're the only ones</i>
<i>with the story, I believe</i>
<i>we're sitting on an exclusive.</i>

997
01:36:14,696 --> 01:36:17,096
I like that.
<i>Corporate has some questions.</i>

998
01:36:17,165 --> 01:36:19,531
<i>We've got a meeting at "Black Rock"</i>
<i>first thing in the morning.</i>

999
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:23,628
- When's the air date?
<i>- Lowell, Sharon's on line three.</i>

1000
01:36:23,705 --> 01:36:27,801
- Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
<i>- Here we go.</i>

1001
01:36:27,876 --> 01:36:30,344
That they had long
known that the nicotine in tobacco...

1002
01:36:30,412 --> 01:36:34,712
is an addictive drug despite their
public statements to the contrary.

1003
01:36:34,783 --> 01:36:38,549
Like the testimony before Congress
of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

1004
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:42,579
Brown & Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

1005
01:36:42,657 --> 01:36:45,182
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1006
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,820
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1007
01:36:47,896 --> 01:36:50,364
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

1008
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:53,924
All of us did.
There was this whole line of people,

1009
01:36:54,002 --> 01:36:56,436
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1010
01:36:56,504 --> 01:36:59,200
Part of the reason
I'm here is that I felt...

1011
01:37:00,408 --> 01:37:02,467
that their representation
clearly misstated...

1012
01:37:02,544 --> 01:37:04,808
what is common language
within the company.

1013
01:37:04,879 --> 01:37:07,143
We are in the nicotine
delivery business.

1014
01:37:07,215 --> 01:37:10,742
<i>There is extensive use of this</i>
<i>technology, known as ammonia chemistry.</i>

1015
01:37:10,819 --> 01:37:14,721
<i>It allows for the nicotine to be</i>
<i>more rapidly absorbed in the lung...</i>

1016
01:37:14,789 --> 01:37:17,451
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1017
01:37:17,525 --> 01:37:20,585
That's what cigarettes are for.
- Delivery device for nicotine.

1018
01:37:20,662 --> 01:37:23,529
A delivery device
for nicotine. Put it in your mouth,

1019
01:37:23,598 --> 01:37:25,691
light it up and
you're going to get your fix.

1020
01:37:25,767 --> 01:37:28,099
You're going to get your fix.

1021
01:40:32,286 --> 01:40:35,255
- Shall I send for coffee?
Sorry I'm late.
- No, we're fine.

1022
01:40:35,322 --> 01:40:38,120
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1023
01:40:38,192 --> 01:40:40,490
All right. I thought
we'd get together...

1024
01:40:40,561 --> 01:40:42,495
because there's
a legal concept...

1025
01:40:42,563 --> 01:40:45,259
that has been getting
some new attention recently.

1026
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:47,425
Tortious interference.

1027
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:51,301
<i>If two people have an agreement,</i>
<i>like a confidentiality agreement,</i>

1028
01:40:51,372 --> 01:40:55,832
and one of them breaks it because they
are induced to do so by a third party,

1029
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:59,004
the third party can be sued
for damages for interfering.

1030
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,275
Hence, tortious interference.

1031
01:41:01,348 --> 01:41:04,476
"Interfering"?
That's what we do.

1032
01:41:04,552 --> 01:41:07,282
<i>I think what we're trying to tell you</i>
<i>is that it happens all the time.</i>

1033
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:11,381
This is a news organization. People are
always telling us things they shouldn't.

1034
01:41:11,459 --> 01:41:15,691
We have to verify if it's true
and in the public interest.
And if it is, we air it.

1035
01:41:15,763 --> 01:41:20,097
And after we corroborate it.
That's why we've never lost
a lawsuit and run a classy show.

1036
01:41:20,167 --> 01:41:24,968
- Anything else?
- And <i>60 Minutes'</i> verification
is exact and precise.

1037
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:28,941
And I don't think it would hurt
to make sure you're right on this one.

1038
01:41:29,009 --> 01:41:32,945
<i>Why? You think we have liability?</i>

1039
01:41:33,013 --> 01:41:35,106
What's the CBS News position,
Eric?

1040
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:37,343
There's a possibility.
It's rather remote.

1041
01:41:37,418 --> 01:41:40,410
But one we
have to check on, Mike.

1042
01:41:40,488 --> 01:41:43,082
I've retained outside counsel
to do exactly that...

1043
01:41:43,157 --> 01:41:47,753
on a segment, I might add,
that's already rife with problems.

1044
01:41:47,828 --> 01:41:49,762
What does that mean?
"Rife with..."

1045
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:53,095
I'm told unusual promises
were made to Wigand.

1046
01:41:53,167 --> 01:41:56,261
No, only that we would hold his story
until it was safe for him.

1047
01:41:56,337 --> 01:41:59,431
And I'm told there are questions
as to our star witness' veracity.

1048
01:41:59,507 --> 01:42:02,499
His "veracity" was good enough
for the state of Mississippi.

1049
01:42:02,576 --> 01:42:05,044
Our standards have to be
higher than anyone else's,

1050
01:42:05,112 --> 01:42:08,104
because we are the standard
for everybody else.

1051
01:42:08,182 --> 01:42:13,347
Well, as a "standard," I'll hang with
"is this guy telling the truth?"

1052
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,150
Well, with tortious interference,
I'm afraid...

1053
01:42:16,223 --> 01:42:19,715
the greater the truth,
the greater the damage.

1054
01:42:21,328 --> 01:42:23,728
- Come again?
- They own...

1055
01:42:23,798 --> 01:42:26,358
the information he's disclosing.

1056
01:42:26,433 --> 01:42:28,492
The truer it is,

1057
01:42:28,569 --> 01:42:30,560
the greater
the damage to them.

1058
01:42:30,638 --> 01:42:34,267
If he lied, he didn't
disclose their information,
and the damages are smaller.

1059
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:44,215
- Is this <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>
- You said "on this one."

1060
01:42:44,285 --> 01:42:46,219
What about this one?

1061
01:42:46,287 --> 01:42:49,984
<i>If this holds up...</i>
<i>And it very well may not, Mike.</i>

1062
01:42:50,057 --> 01:42:53,356
But if it did
and we aired this segment,

1063
01:42:53,427 --> 01:42:57,454
and CBS was sued
by Brown & Williamson,

1064
01:42:57,531 --> 01:42:59,590
I think we could be
at grave risk.

1065
01:42:59,667 --> 01:43:03,467
- How grave?
<i>- Well, at the end of the day,</i>

1066
01:43:03,537 --> 01:43:06,233
because of your segment,

1067
01:43:06,307 --> 01:43:08,741
the Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Company...

1068
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:10,834
could own CBS.

1069
01:43:12,947 --> 01:43:15,848
Oh. You know,

1070
01:43:15,916 --> 01:43:19,875
I am sorry,
but I'm due upstairs.

1071
01:43:19,954 --> 01:43:22,923
Is CBS Corporate
telling CBS News...

1072
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:26,482
"Do not go to air
with this story"?

1073
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,188
You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're all in this together.

1074
01:43:29,263 --> 01:43:32,460
We're all CBS.
We'll find out soon.

1075
01:43:32,533 --> 01:43:34,467
Thank you, gentlemen.

1076
01:43:41,508 --> 01:43:43,476
"Tortious interference."

1077
01:43:43,544 --> 01:43:46,604
That sounds like a disease
caught by a radio.

1078
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,114
<i>- Lunch?</i>
- Sure.

1079
01:43:49,183 --> 01:43:51,583
Don't worry.
We call the shots around here.

1080
01:44:05,165 --> 01:44:07,531
Hello?

1081
01:44:07,601 --> 01:44:10,434
Debbie, it's me. I want
you to check some filings,

1082
01:44:10,504 --> 01:44:12,995
and give me John Wilson's number
at Bear-Stearn.

1083
01:44:21,282 --> 01:44:23,716
- What now?
- Kluster's coming over.

1084
01:44:31,392 --> 01:44:33,360
<i>Hello, Lowell, Mike.</i>

1085
01:44:33,427 --> 01:44:35,793
<i>Don.</i>

1086
01:44:35,863 --> 01:44:40,197
There has been so much soul searching
about this Wigand.

1087
01:44:40,267 --> 01:44:42,400
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

1088
01:44:42,435 --> 01:44:44,533
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

1089
01:44:44,605 --> 01:44:49,269
So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
checking with outside counsel first?

1090
01:44:49,343 --> 01:44:51,277
- All that crap?
- That's happening.

1091
01:44:51,345 --> 01:44:53,939
Hopefully, we won't have to use
the alternate, but we should
have it in the can.

1092
01:44:54,014 --> 01:44:56,346
- I'm not touching my film.
- I'm afraid you are.

1093
01:44:56,416 --> 01:45:00,580
- No, I'm not.
- We're doing this
with or without you, Lowell.

1094
01:45:00,654 --> 01:45:04,613
If you like, I can assign
another producer to edit your show.

1095
01:45:06,693 --> 01:45:08,786
Since when has the, uh,

1096
01:45:08,862 --> 01:45:12,263
paragon of
investigative journalism...

1097
01:45:12,332 --> 01:45:16,598
allowed lawyers to determine
the news content on <i>60 Minutes?</i>

1098
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:19,002
<i>It's an alternate version.</i>

1099
01:45:19,072 --> 01:45:21,768
So what if we have
an alternate version?

1100
01:45:21,842 --> 01:45:24,470
And I don't think our being cautious
is so damned unreasonable.

1101
01:45:25,813 --> 01:45:27,747
So now, if you will
excuse me, gentlemen,

1102
01:45:27,815 --> 01:45:30,409
Mr. Rather's been complaining
about his chair again.

1103
01:45:30,484 --> 01:45:33,317
Before you go,

1104
01:45:34,388 --> 01:45:36,356
I discovered this.

1105
01:45:38,325 --> 01:45:42,887
S.E.C. Filing for the sale of CBS
Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

1106
01:45:42,963 --> 01:45:45,227
- What?
- Yeah, I heard rumors.

1107
01:45:45,299 --> 01:45:48,427
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.
If Tisch can unload CBS...

1108
01:45:48,502 --> 01:45:50,834
for $81 a share
to Westinghouse,

1109
01:45:50,904 --> 01:45:52,872
and then is
suddenly threatened...

1110
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:56,706
with a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit from Brown & Williamson,

1111
01:45:56,777 --> 01:45:58,711
that could screw up the sale,
could it not?

1112
01:45:58,779 --> 01:46:02,715
<i>- What are you implying?</i>
- I'm not implying. I'm quoting.

1113
01:46:02,783 --> 01:46:06,685
Uh, " More vested interests. Persons
who will profit from this merger.

1114
01:46:06,753 --> 01:46:11,986
"Ms. Helen Caperelli, general counsel
of CBS News, 3.9 million.

1115
01:46:12,059 --> 01:46:15,119
"Mr. Eric Kluster,
president of CBS News,

1116
01:46:15,195 --> 01:46:18,062
1.4 million."

1117
01:46:18,131 --> 01:46:21,259
<i> Are you suggesting that</i>
<i>she and Eric are influenced by money?</i>

1118
01:46:21,335 --> 01:46:25,362
No, no, of course they're not
influenced by money. They work for free.

1119
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:27,873
And you are a volunteer
executive producer.

1120
01:46:27,941 --> 01:46:31,877
CBS does not do that. And you're
questioning our journalistic integrity.

1121
01:46:31,945 --> 01:46:33,879
No, I'm questioning
your hearing.

1122
01:46:33,947 --> 01:46:36,245
You hear "reasonable"
and "tortious interference."

1123
01:46:36,316 --> 01:46:39,513
I hear "potential Brown
& Williamson lawsuit...

1124
01:46:39,586 --> 01:46:42,578
jeopardizing the sale
of CBS to Westinghouse."

1125
01:46:42,656 --> 01:46:46,057
I hear "Shut the segment down.
Cut Wigand loose.

1126
01:46:46,126 --> 01:46:48,924
Obey orders and fuck off."
That's what I hear.

1127
01:46:48,996 --> 01:46:50,930
<i>- You're exaggerating.</i>
- I am?

1128
01:46:50,998 --> 01:46:53,796
You pay me
to go get guys like Wigand,

1129
01:46:53,867 --> 01:46:57,701
to draw him out, to get him to trust
us, to get him to go on television.

1130
01:46:57,771 --> 01:47:00,672
I do. I deliver him.
He sits. He talks.

1131
01:47:00,741 --> 01:47:04,108
He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement.

1132
01:47:04,177 --> 01:47:08,238
And he's only the key witness in the
biggest public health reform issue,

1133
01:47:08,315 --> 01:47:10,408
maybe the biggest,
most expensive...

1134
01:47:10,484 --> 01:47:13,419
corporate malfeasance case
in U.S. History.

1135
01:47:13,487 --> 01:47:15,819
And Jeffrey Wigand,
who's out on a limb,

1136
01:47:15,889 --> 01:47:18,255
does he go on television
and tell the truth?

1137
01:47:18,325 --> 01:47:20,657
Yes.
Is it newsworthy?

1138
01:47:20,727 --> 01:47:23,423
Yes.
Are we gonna air it?

1139
01:47:23,497 --> 01:47:25,488
Of course not. Why?

1140
01:47:25,565 --> 01:47:27,829
Because he's not
telling the truth? No.

1141
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:31,735
<i>Because he is telling the truth.</i>
<i>That's why we're not gonna air it.</i>

1142
01:47:31,805 --> 01:47:34,103
And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

1143
01:47:34,174 --> 01:47:38,110
<i> You are a fanatic,</i>
<i>an anarchist. You know that?</i>

1144
01:47:38,178 --> 01:47:41,705
If we can't have a whole show, then
I want half a show rather than no show.

1145
01:47:41,782 --> 01:47:45,548
But, oh, no. Not you. You
won't be satisfied unless you're
putting the company at risk!

1146
01:47:45,619 --> 01:47:48,850
What are you? Are you a businessman
or are you a newsman?

1147
01:47:48,922 --> 01:47:51,288
Because that happens to be
what Mike and I...

1148
01:47:51,358 --> 01:47:53,986
and some other people
around here do for a living.

1149
01:47:54,061 --> 01:47:57,656
<i>- Lowell...</i>
- Put the corporation at risk?
Give me a fucking break!

1150
01:47:57,731 --> 01:47:59,892
These people are
putting our whole reason...

1151
01:47:59,967 --> 01:48:02,629
- for doing what we do on the line!
- Lowell!

1152
01:48:02,703 --> 01:48:04,728
What?

1153
01:48:04,805 --> 01:48:07,000
I'm with Don
on this.

1154
01:48:29,463 --> 01:48:31,431
What's wrong?

1155
01:48:31,498 --> 01:48:34,058
They're killing
the Wigand interview.

1156
01:48:34,134 --> 01:48:38,400
- What?
- They're pretending it's process.
That's bullshit. It's foregone.

1157
01:48:41,808 --> 01:48:43,742
What are you and Mike
gonna do?

1158
01:48:46,546 --> 01:48:49,174
I'm alone on this.

1159
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:52,582
- Oh, baby.
- Yeah.

1160
01:49:21,782 --> 01:49:23,716
It's Jeffrey Wigand.

1161
01:49:33,493 --> 01:49:36,985
Jeffrey.
How are you?

1162
01:49:37,064 --> 01:49:39,191
How's the family?
Okay?

1163
01:49:39,266 --> 01:49:42,201
- There is... There is no family.
- What do you mean, "there is no family"?

1164
01:49:42,269 --> 01:49:44,567
Uh, Liane has filed for divorce.

1165
01:49:44,638 --> 01:49:47,971
And, so,
I've moved out.

1166
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:50,601
I see the girls
a couple of days a week.

1167
01:49:50,677 --> 01:49:56,047
- Where are you staying now?
- Our favorite hotel, honey.

1168
01:49:56,116 --> 01:50:00,212
I checked into room 930.

1169
01:50:00,287 --> 01:50:02,221
Odd choice, huh?

1170
01:50:06,026 --> 01:50:08,256
I don't know how
to say this,

1171
01:50:08,328 --> 01:50:10,694
Jeff, except to just
say it right out.

1172
01:50:10,764 --> 01:50:14,996
So, uh, I'll say it.
They do not want to air it.

1173
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:22,001
- What?
- B&W may have threatened litigation.

1174
01:50:22,075 --> 01:50:24,635
CBS is on the block.

1175
01:50:24,711 --> 01:50:27,839
- But you, I mean... I know how you...
- No.

1176
01:50:28,949 --> 01:50:31,076
No, what?

1177
01:50:31,151 --> 01:50:35,918
I do not think that you know for me
what it is to walk in my shoes.

1178
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:40,785
For my kids
to have seen it,

1179
01:50:40,861 --> 01:50:43,728
for them to know why I've
put them through what I did.

1180
01:50:43,797 --> 01:50:47,392
The public airing of that,
the testament to why I did what I did.

1181
01:50:47,467 --> 01:50:50,436
You're telling me it's not
gonna see the light of day?

1182
01:50:50,504 --> 01:50:53,268
Jeff.

1183
01:51:35,916 --> 01:51:37,850
Mrs. Wigand?

1184
01:51:39,586 --> 01:51:42,783
It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand
for some time.

1185
01:51:42,856 --> 01:51:47,520
I'm an investigator, and I was
wondering if I could ask you a
couple of questions about that.

1186
01:51:49,396 --> 01:51:51,330
All right.

1187
01:51:55,335 --> 01:51:57,860
Um, seven months
after we were married,

1188
01:51:57,938 --> 01:52:00,372
we found out that I had
multiple sclerosis.

1189
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,374
<i>And you had a daughter, Diane...</i>

1190
01:52:02,442 --> 01:52:04,376
<i>Tommy Sandefur told me himself.</i>

1191
01:52:04,444 --> 01:52:08,904
<i>He's not going to allow Brown</i>
<i>& Williamson to be demonized</i>
<i>to the American public.</i>

1192
01:52:08,982 --> 01:52:11,974
So I told Pete Jennings.
And I... Hold on.

1193
01:52:12,052 --> 01:52:15,681
You had multiple sclerosis.
You had a small child to raise.

1194
01:52:15,755 --> 01:52:19,816
Uh, mention that part in the
executive summary and in the chapters.

1195
01:52:19,893 --> 01:52:22,293
First wife
and estrangement of daughter.

1196
01:52:22,362 --> 01:52:24,796
So I was telling Pete, I said,
"You've been taken in by this guy."

1197
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:27,594
The divorce was something
that we both wanted.

1198
01:52:28,702 --> 01:52:31,330
He's a shoplifter.

1199
01:52:31,404 --> 01:52:33,872
He's a convicted
shoplifter.

1200
01:52:52,459 --> 01:52:55,792
So, um, what are you
gonna do?

1201
01:52:55,862 --> 01:52:59,025
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Quit in protest?

1202
01:52:59,099 --> 01:53:01,329
I'm not gonna do that.

1203
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:03,335
You're taking "no"
for an answer?

1204
01:53:03,403 --> 01:53:06,372
No, I'm not gonna take
"no" for an answer. No.

1205
01:53:06,439 --> 01:53:09,567
You're not?
What <i>are</i> you doing?

1206
01:53:09,643 --> 01:53:13,101
I'm staying right here, doing my job.
Fighting to get my show on the air.

1207
01:53:13,179 --> 01:53:15,875
You don't like it?
Hey, I tell you what?

1208
01:53:15,949 --> 01:53:19,009
Fire my ass.

1209
01:53:19,085 --> 01:53:22,885
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?

1210
01:53:26,192 --> 01:53:29,855
I don't think so.
Take a look at this.

1211
01:53:29,929 --> 01:53:32,762
This is a summary of a dossier
that's being prepared.

1212
01:53:32,832 --> 01:53:35,062
He wouldn't lie
about his whole life.

1213
01:53:35,135 --> 01:53:37,899
Who's gonna believe him
about anything he says?

1214
01:53:37,971 --> 01:53:41,771
<i>The</i> Wall Street Journal <i>is doing</i>
<i>a major story, and, I think, the</i> Post.

1215
01:53:42,842 --> 01:53:45,174
You backed the wrong horse.

1216
01:53:45,245 --> 01:53:49,579
The version without the interview
is gonna air the week after next.

1217
01:53:55,355 --> 01:53:58,381
What was that about?

1218
01:53:58,458 --> 01:54:00,483
- Get me Wigand.
- Sure.

1219
01:54:03,563 --> 01:54:07,294
What the fuck is this?
Fuck!

1220
01:54:07,367 --> 01:54:09,528
You never told me
you were married before.

1221
01:54:09,602 --> 01:54:12,867
- That you had a daughter.
- How is that any of your business?

1222
01:54:12,939 --> 01:54:15,339
That is not something
that you people need to know.

1223
01:54:15,408 --> 01:54:17,376
Oh, you know what we do
or do not need to know?

1224
01:54:17,444 --> 01:54:19,878
- Since when have you become
a media expert?
- What do you wanna do, Lowell?

1225
01:54:19,946 --> 01:54:22,244
- Look up my ass too?
- Oh, for God's sake.

1226
01:54:22,315 --> 01:54:25,045
- You're not even on this anymore.
What do you care?
- Jeff, wake the fuck up!

1227
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:28,610
Everybody is on the line here.
If they catch you in a lie,

1228
01:54:28,688 --> 01:54:31,418
they can paint everything with
that brush, you understand?

1229
01:54:31,491 --> 01:54:33,982
- Everything you say.
- I told the truth.

1230
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:37,587
Everything you say.
And I can't defend you, man,

1231
01:54:37,664 --> 01:54:39,689
with one hand tied
behind my back...

1232
01:54:39,766 --> 01:54:42,326
because you keep from me
what they can discover.

1233
01:54:42,402 --> 01:54:45,132
And they will discover
everything. Believe me.

1234
01:54:45,205 --> 01:54:47,366
I was young!
I was young!

1235
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,466
Confused. We didn't
handle it the right way.

1236
01:54:50,543 --> 01:54:53,307
- She sued you for back payments
of child support?
- She did not sue me.

1237
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:58,511
We had a dispute over money. I settled
it. She dropped the complaint.

1238
01:54:58,585 --> 01:55:00,519
- Any other questions?
- Yes. Did you lie...

1239
01:55:00,587 --> 01:55:02,817
about being on the American
judo team in the Olympics?

1240
01:55:03,923 --> 01:55:06,016
- What?
- Some public relations guy...

1241
01:55:06,092 --> 01:55:08,151
got hold of a tape of an interview
where you're saying...

1242
01:55:08,228 --> 01:55:10,788
you were on the American
judo team in the Olympics.

1243
01:55:10,864 --> 01:55:13,992
What kind of shit is this?
I... I was...

1244
01:55:14,067 --> 01:55:17,559
I was not <i>on</i> the team.
I <i>sparred</i> with the Olympic team.

1245
01:55:17,637 --> 01:55:20,663
- Okay?
- All right. ABC Telemarketing Company?

1246
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:24,403
- ABC...
- ABC Telemarketing Company.

1247
01:55:24,477 --> 01:55:27,344
The can opener!
A 39.95 can opener!

1248
01:55:27,414 --> 01:55:30,110
I cancelled payment.
It was junk!

1249
01:55:30,183 --> 01:55:33,346
You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
You ever look at another woman's tits?

1250
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:35,718
You ever cheat a little
on your taxes?

1251
01:55:35,789 --> 01:55:39,350
Whose life, if you look at it under
a microscope, doesn't have any flaws?

1252
01:55:39,426 --> 01:55:41,951
Well, that's the whole point, Jeffrey.
That's the whole point.

1253
01:55:42,028 --> 01:55:45,896
Anyone's, everyone's.
They are gonna look under every rock,

1254
01:55:45,965 --> 01:55:49,731
dig up every flaw,
every mistake you've ever made.

1255
01:55:49,803 --> 01:55:53,762
They are going to distort and exaggerate
everything you've ever done, man.

1256
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,536
- Don't you understand?
- What does this have to do
with my testimony?

1257
01:55:56,609 --> 01:55:58,770
- That's not the point...
- What does it have to do
with my testimony?

1258
01:55:58,845 --> 01:56:01,575
- I told the truth!
It's true and provable!
- It's not about...

1259
01:56:01,648 --> 01:56:05,015
That's not the fucking point,
whether you told the truth or not!

1260
01:56:06,586 --> 01:56:08,520
Hello?

1261
01:56:11,424 --> 01:56:13,790
I told the truth.

1262
01:56:15,495 --> 01:56:17,429
I told the truth.

1263
01:56:18,765 --> 01:56:21,325
I gotta teach class. I gotta go.

1264
01:56:21,401 --> 01:56:25,167
- I gotta teach class.
- And I gotta refute every
fucking accusation made...

1265
01:56:25,238 --> 01:56:28,105
in this report before
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> runs.

1266
01:56:31,945 --> 01:56:34,038
I am trying to protect you,
man.

1267
01:56:35,148 --> 01:56:37,082
I hope you improve
your batting average.

1268
01:56:56,536 --> 01:56:59,869
<i>They're cutting the interest rate,</i>
<i>and I have that great feature...</i>

1269
01:57:06,212 --> 01:57:08,146
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1270
01:57:08,214 --> 01:57:12,844
Are you guys planning to do a piece on
a former top executive in Big Tobacco?

1271
01:57:12,919 --> 01:57:15,752
- You caught me in a news meeting.
- Are you, are you not, Charlie?

1272
01:57:15,822 --> 01:57:17,813
You bet we are,
and I can't talk to you now.

1273
01:57:17,891 --> 01:57:20,826
- We gotta hook up.
- Sure. Where?

1274
01:57:20,894 --> 01:57:23,795
- P.J.'s.
- I'll be there.

1275
01:57:30,837 --> 01:57:33,465
Yeah, I got it.
Five hundred pages of it.

1276
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:37,169
They looked in every corner
of this guy's life,
from the spousal abuse charge,

1277
01:57:37,243 --> 01:57:40,940
to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket
he got once for running a red light.

1278
01:57:41,014 --> 01:57:44,541
It's Terry Lenzner's outfit,
I.G.I. Jack, listen to me.

1279
01:57:44,617 --> 01:57:49,213
Their strategy: Discredit
this guy, ruin his reputation
in the <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>

1280
01:57:49,289 --> 01:57:52,690
and then nobody will ever listen
to what he's got to say about tobacco.

1281
01:57:52,759 --> 01:57:55,887
He's dead unless I can
get this thing knocked down.

1282
01:57:55,962 --> 01:57:58,396
Make it even
a little more attractive.

1283
01:57:58,464 --> 01:58:01,058
I don't know if you're
ever gonna get paid.

1284
01:58:01,134 --> 01:58:03,728
- Is there any truth to any of it?
- That's a good question.

1285
01:58:03,803 --> 01:58:06,203
"Is there any truth to any of it?"
I doubt it.

1286
01:58:06,272 --> 01:58:09,730
- What's the deadline?
- Soon.

1287
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:16,546
- Fax me the summary.
- That's great, Jack.

1288
01:58:23,255 --> 01:58:26,816
- Hey. How are you? Hey, listen.
- Hey.

1289
01:58:26,892 --> 01:58:30,191
I hear you guys are sitting
on something sensational over there.

1290
01:58:30,262 --> 01:58:33,823
- Really? Hi, June.
- Oh, hi, baby.

1291
01:58:35,634 --> 01:58:37,761
- Catch you later.
- Okay. Take care.

1292
01:58:39,605 --> 01:58:41,539
- When's your deadline?
- Monday.

1293
01:58:41,607 --> 01:58:44,542
- Push it.
- What? Forget it.

1294
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:46,544
It's a smear campaign,
Charlie.

1295
01:58:46,612 --> 01:58:48,580
- It's drawn from
a selectively circulated...
- Oh, yeah.

1296
01:58:48,647 --> 01:58:51,673
Real selective. About as hard to get
ahold of as the Manhattan phone book.

1297
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:55,550
Well, it's authoritive...
and overwhelmingly documented.

1298
01:58:55,621 --> 01:58:58,613
And it's bullshit. And if
I'm right, are you gonna put...

1299
01:58:58,691 --> 01:59:01,888
the <i>Journal's</i> reputation behind a story
that's gonna blow up in your face?

1300
01:59:01,961 --> 01:59:05,863
I'll take a look at what you got
but I'm not moving any deadlines
because you say so.

1301
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:15,373
Are you all right?

1302
01:59:17,643 --> 01:59:19,577
Yeah.

1303
01:59:28,887 --> 01:59:31,287
Officer Muravchick?

1304
01:59:31,357 --> 01:59:34,383
Thank you.

1305
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:36,860
Officer Muravchick,
how are you?

1306
01:59:36,929 --> 01:59:39,022
- I'm Sandra Sutherland.
- How do you do?

1307
01:59:39,098 --> 01:59:41,157
Fine, thank you.
I'm doing a background check.

1308
01:59:41,233 --> 01:59:43,167
Mind if I sit down?

1309
01:59:45,371 --> 01:59:49,137
Your Honor,
could I have a word with you?

1310
01:59:49,208 --> 01:59:52,974
You presided in a dispute
over support payments.

1311
01:59:53,045 --> 01:59:56,344
Jeffrey Wigand?
Yeah, I cited him.

1312
01:59:56,415 --> 02:00:00,476
CBS is under criticism because
the CBS News program, <i>60 Minutes,</i>

1313
02:00:00,552 --> 02:00:02,520
will not be presenting
an interview...

1314
02:00:02,588 --> 02:00:05,489
What the hell
are you doing?

1315
02:00:05,557 --> 02:00:07,582
What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm editing.

1316
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:10,527
No, no, no that. I'm talking
about the Associated Press.

1317
02:00:10,596 --> 02:00:15,192
They got the story that
we pulled this interview,
and they talked to Mike and I.

1318
02:00:15,267 --> 02:00:17,258
Did you tell them
that we were lying?

1319
02:00:17,336 --> 02:00:19,304
No!
I should have.

1320
02:00:19,371 --> 02:00:21,566
I told them I disagreed
with you, Mike and Kluster...

1321
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:24,473
that this segment
is as good as the original.

1322
02:00:24,543 --> 02:00:26,670
<i>I'm not lying for you.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna shut up for you.</i>

1323
02:00:26,745 --> 02:00:29,612
<i>- Not on any of it.</i>
- Hey, I'm not gonna fire you.

1324
02:00:29,682 --> 02:00:32,708
Okay? Take a vacation. Now!

1325
02:00:36,388 --> 02:00:40,017
<i>Lowell? Look, I've decided</i>
<i>to preface Sunday's show.</i>

1326
02:00:40,092 --> 02:00:42,890
I did three minutes on the
<i>Evening News.</i> You'll want to see it.

1327
02:00:42,961 --> 02:00:45,987
- Where are you going?
- I've been banished...

1328
02:00:46,065 --> 02:00:49,296
<i>in lieu of being fired.</i>

1329
02:00:49,368 --> 02:00:52,337
<i>I took off on Tisch.</i>
<i>I took off on Corporate.</i>

1330
02:00:52,404 --> 02:00:55,032
They'll know they're not, uh, going
to see everything on Sunday night.

1331
02:00:56,341 --> 02:00:59,572
I don't know. How does that
get Wigand on the air?

1332
02:00:59,645 --> 02:01:01,772
Do me a favor,
will you? Spare me.

1333
02:01:01,847 --> 02:01:04,315
For God's sake, get in the
real world. What do you think?

1334
02:01:04,383 --> 02:01:07,978
I'm going to resign in protest
to force it on the air?

1335
02:01:08,053 --> 02:01:10,954
The answer's no. I don't plan
to spend the end of my days...

1336
02:01:11,023 --> 02:01:14,049
wandering in the wilderness
of National Public Radio.

1337
02:01:14,126 --> 02:01:16,060
That decision
I've already made.

1338
02:01:18,063 --> 02:01:20,463
<i> This Sunday,</i>
<i>Wallace will broadcast a report...</i>

1339
02:01:20,532 --> 02:01:24,798
<i>on the tobacco industry,</i>
<i>including the tough tactics</i>
<i>tobacco companies employ...</i>

1340
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:27,668
to keep a lid on information
that might be damaging.

1341
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:30,538
Is there information
that people should have...

1342
02:01:30,609 --> 02:01:34,943
that they're not going to have
because you're not going to
broadcast this interview?

1343
02:01:35,013 --> 02:01:39,074
- Yes.
- Today, CBS News president
Eric Kluster...

1344
02:01:39,151 --> 02:01:41,915
<i>defended the network's decision</i>
<i>not to broadcast...</i>

1345
02:01:41,987 --> 02:01:44,956
<i>key portions</i>
<i>of the controversial interview.</i>

1346
02:01:45,023 --> 02:01:47,821
<i>Mr. Kluster said, quote,</i>
<i>"The atmosphere is tougher than ever."</i>

1347
02:01:47,893 --> 02:01:50,384
- Where's the rest?
- Dan.

1348
02:01:50,462 --> 02:01:52,396
Where the hell's the rest?

1349
02:01:52,464 --> 02:01:55,433
<i>- Nebraska football</i>

- You cut it!

<i>Coming up in</i>
<i>Bernard Goldberg's America.</i>

1351
02:01:58,470 --> 02:02:01,462
- You cut the guts out of what I said!
- It was a time consideration...

1352
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:04,373
Time? Bullshit!
You corporate lackey.

1353
02:02:04,443 --> 02:02:08,277
Who told <i>you</i> your incompetent
little fingers have the
requisite skills to edit me?

1354
02:02:08,347 --> 02:02:11,077
I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation
here, and you're too dim...

1355
02:02:11,150 --> 02:02:13,516
Mike. Mike. Mike.

1356
02:02:13,585 --> 02:02:17,612
"Mike"? Mike!

1357
02:02:17,689 --> 02:02:19,486
Try "Mr. Wallace."

1358
02:02:19,558 --> 02:02:23,426
We work in the same corporation. Doesn't
mean we work in the same profession.

1359
02:02:23,495 --> 02:02:26,089
Now, now what are you going to do now?
You going to finesse me?

1360
02:02:26,165 --> 02:02:30,499
Lawyer me some more? I've been
in this profession 50 fucking years!

1361
02:02:30,569 --> 02:02:33,436
You and the people you work for
are destroying the most respected,

1362
02:02:33,505 --> 02:02:36,474
the highest rated, the most
profitable show on this network.

1363
02:02:52,524 --> 02:02:55,857
Here. These are
their leads, their sources.

1364
02:02:55,928 --> 02:02:59,193
- I want you to have your reporters...
- Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

1365
02:02:59,264 --> 02:03:01,459
Have them make
their own calls.

1366
02:03:01,533 --> 02:03:06,300
They'll find that these sources
have a different story than
the one that's in the dossier.

1367
02:03:07,573 --> 02:03:09,507
Push the deadline,
Charlie.

1368
02:03:14,746 --> 02:03:19,080
I'll push it for a week.
I want Milo and Suein to go through it.

1369
02:03:33,332 --> 02:03:35,391
What do you want
to buy him for a gift?

1370
02:03:35,467 --> 02:03:39,233
<i>Mmm, he's into</i>
<i>kind of little cars that, um...</i>

1371
02:03:39,304 --> 02:03:41,534
- That remote control thing?
- Yeah.

1372
02:03:41,607 --> 02:03:43,905
All right.
We'll go do that tomorrow.

1373

02:03:56,622 --> 02:03:58,749
And in local news,
WLKO, Louisville,

and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

1389
02:04:48,606 --> 02:04:51,234
We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us...

1390
02:04:51,309 --> 02:04:55,302
<i>whether or not the tobacco industry</i>
<i>has been leveling with the public.</i>

1391
02:04:55,379 --> 02:04:57,313
<i>That insider was formerly...</i>

1392
02:04:57,381 --> 02:05:00,316
<i>a highly-placed executive</i>
<i>with a tobacco company.</i>

1393
02:05:00,384 --> 02:05:04,218
<i>But we cannot broadcast what critical</i>
<i>information about tobacco,</i>

1394
02:05:04,288 --> 02:05:07,587
<i>addiction and public health</i>
<i>he might be able to offer.</i>

1395
02:05:07,658 --> 02:05:11,492
<i>Why? Because he had to sign</i>
<i>a confidentiality agreement...</i>

1396
02:05:11,562 --> 02:05:13,928
<i>with the tobacco company</i>
<i>he worked for.</i>

1397
02:05:13,998 --> 02:05:17,126
<i>The management of CBS</i>
<i>has told us...</i>

1398
02:05:17,201 --> 02:05:19,328
<i>that knowing</i>
<i>he had that agreement...</i>

1399
02:05:19,403 --> 02:05:21,871
<i>if we were to broadcast</i>
<i>an interview with him,</i>

1400
02:05:21,939 --> 02:05:25,898
<i>CBS could be faced with</i>
<i>a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.</i>

1401
02:05:25,977 --> 02:05:29,606
<i>The fact is, we are not allowed</i>
<i>even to mention his name...</i>

1402
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:32,410
or the name of the company
he worked for.

1403
02:05:32,483 --> 02:05:36,817
And, of course, we cannot
show you his face.

1404
02:05:36,887 --> 02:05:39,981
And your confidentiality
agreement with...

1405
02:05:40,057 --> 02:05:42,617
- Is still in force?
- Yes, it is.

1406

<i>Sue you for making this appearance?</i>

All right.
What did you think?

1414
02:06:26,103 --> 02:06:28,401
I think it was
a disgrace.

1415
02:06:51,996 --> 02:06:55,727
- Still no answer.
- Get me the manager's office.

1416
02:06:56,934 --> 02:06:59,198
David. David, you've got
a call on line four.

1417
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:02,330
I think you
better take it.

1418

This is David McDougal.
How can I help you?

1419
02:07:04,475 --> 02:07:08,343
Mr. McDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>

1420
02:07:08,412 --> 02:07:13,782
I'm concerned for a friend of mine
who's staying at your hotel right now.

1421
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:22,551
Mr. Wigand?

1422
02:07:22,626 --> 02:07:24,560
Mr. Wigand?

1423
02:07:30,201 --> 02:07:33,364
I-I think I need to call the police.
He won't respond.

1424
02:07:33,437 --> 02:07:36,167
No, no, don't call the police. Just
tell him I'm on the phone with you.

1425
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:38,708
My name is Lowell Bergman.
Just tell him that.

1426
02:07:38,776 --> 02:07:43,304
Mr. Wigand, Mr. Bergman
is on the telephone.

1427
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:45,871
Did he hear you?

1428
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:48,282
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

1429
02:07:48,352 --> 02:07:50,946
What about now?

1430
02:07:51,021 --> 02:07:53,546
- What?
- Hello? Can you hear me now?

1431
02:09:01,258 --> 02:09:05,160
- What's happening?
- He doesn't seem to be listening.

1432
02:09:05,229 --> 02:09:09,131
All right. Now listen to me.
I want you... I want you to tell him...

1433
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:11,634
in these words:
Get on the fucking phone.

1434
02:09:11,702 --> 02:09:13,966
I-I can't say that.

1435
02:09:14,038 --> 02:09:16,563
No, you can. Tell him
to get on the fucking phone!

1436
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:19,734
He told me to tell you
to get on the... fucking phone!

1437
02:09:25,749 --> 02:09:28,650
You manipulated me into this.

1438
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:30,983
- That's bullshit, Jeff.
- You greased the rails.

1439
02:09:31,055 --> 02:09:35,185
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
to say "yes." I helped him to say "yes."

1440
02:09:35,259 --> 02:09:37,887
That's all.
You're not a robot, Jeff.

1441
02:09:37,962 --> 02:09:40,897
- All right? You got a mind
of your own, don't you?
- " Up to you, Jeffrey.

1442
02:09:40,965 --> 02:09:43,160
"That's the power you have,
Jeffrey.

1443
02:09:43,234 --> 02:09:45,702
Vital inside information
the American public need to know."

1444
02:09:45,769 --> 02:09:49,227
Lowell Bergman... the hotshot who never
met a source he couldn't turn around.

1445
02:09:49,306 --> 02:09:51,501
I fought for you,
and I still fight for you!

1446
02:09:51,575 --> 02:09:54,237
You fought for me?
You manipulated me...

1447
02:09:54,311 --> 02:09:57,371
into where I am now... staring
at the Brown & Williamson building!

1448
02:09:57,448 --> 02:10:00,645
It's all dark except the tenth floor.
That's the legal department.

1449
02:10:00,718 --> 02:10:04,586
That's where they
fuck with my life.

1450
02:10:07,691 --> 02:10:09,625
Jeffrey, where you going
with this?

1451
02:10:11,262 --> 02:10:14,026
So, where you going?

1452
02:10:18,202 --> 02:10:21,035
You are... important...

1453
02:10:21,105 --> 02:10:24,006
to a lot of people,
Jeffrey.

1454
02:10:24,074 --> 02:10:26,133
You think about that.

1455
02:10:27,211 --> 02:10:29,145
You think about them.

1456
02:10:42,226 --> 02:10:44,626
I'm running out
of heroes, man.

1457
02:10:45,729 --> 02:10:47,856
Guys like you
are in short supply.

1458
02:10:54,004 --> 02:10:55,938
Yeah, guys like you too.

1459
02:11:00,711 --> 02:11:02,804
Where are you, anyway?

1460
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:07,408
I'm on a leave of absence.
Forced vacation.

1461
02:11:09,586 --> 02:11:12,783
- You try and have a good time.
- Yeah.

1462
02:11:12,856 --> 02:11:15,154
Yeah, I will.

1463
02:11:29,307 --> 02:11:32,367
I'm Lowell Bergman. I'm from <i>60 Minutes.</i>
You know, you take the <i>60 Minutes...</i>

1464
02:11:32,443 --> 02:11:34,968
out of that sentence,
nobody returns your phone calls.

1465
02:11:36,247 --> 02:11:40,047
<i>Maybe Wigand's right.</i>
<i>Maybe I'm hooked.</i>

1466
02:11:41,385 --> 02:11:43,319
What am I hooked on?

1467
02:11:43,387 --> 02:11:45,651
The rush of <i>60 Minutes?</i>

1468
02:11:45,723 --> 02:11:49,523
<i>What the hell for?</i>
<i>"Infotainment"!</i>

1469
02:11:49,594 --> 02:11:51,858
It's so fucking useless,
all of it.

1470
02:11:51,929 --> 02:11:55,660
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go and work somewhere else.

1471
02:11:55,733 --> 02:11:57,826
"Free press"?
The press is free.

1472
02:11:57,902 --> 02:12:01,565
For anyone who owns one.
Larry Tisch has a free press.

1473
02:12:01,639 --> 02:12:03,834
- Get some perspective, Lowell.
- I got perspective.

1474
02:12:03,908 --> 02:12:05,899
No, you do not.

1475
02:12:07,345 --> 02:12:09,836
From my perspective,

1476
02:12:09,914 --> 02:12:13,816
what's been going on and what
I've been doing is ridiculous.

1477
02:12:13,885 --> 02:12:16,217
- It's half-measures.
<i>- You're not listening.</i>

1478
02:12:22,627 --> 02:12:25,619
Really know what you're
going to do before you do it.

1479
02:13:07,271 --> 02:13:09,364
<i>I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone.</i>

1480
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,341
Patch him through.

1481
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:15,208
Well, Lowell, you are
not gonna believe this.

1482
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:19,579
The governor of Mississippi
is suing his own attorney general...

1483
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:23,245
to abandon litigation
against Big Tobacco.

1484
02:13:23,321 --> 02:13:27,223
- Oh, good.
- But now that the version
without Jeff ran,

1485
02:13:27,291 --> 02:13:30,624
what's the chance of getting
his interview on the air?

1486
02:13:33,097 --> 02:13:35,190
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1487
02:13:35,266 --> 02:13:37,632
What chance is there of getting
Jeff's interview on the air?

1488
02:13:37,702 --> 02:13:39,636
Less than great.

1489
02:13:44,308 --> 02:13:46,606
I'd be lying to you
if I did not tell you...

1490
02:13:46,677 --> 02:13:50,078
how important it was
in the court of public opinion.

1491
02:13:50,147 --> 02:13:52,809
I'd be lying to you
if I didn't tell you...

1492
02:13:52,883 --> 02:13:56,649
I'm about out of moves,
Dick.

1493
02:13:58,889 --> 02:14:00,857
All right.
See ya.

1494
02:14:23,014 --> 02:14:25,642
Hi.

1495
02:14:27,385 --> 02:14:31,719
So, what are you folks
doing... here in Lincoln?

1496
02:14:32,823 --> 02:14:36,816
- Geology survey.
- Geology?

1497
02:14:36,894 --> 02:14:39,920
Yeah?
Really?

1498
02:14:39,997 --> 02:14:41,931
How about you?

1499
02:14:43,334 --> 02:14:45,894
I work for CBS News.

1500
02:14:45,970 --> 02:14:48,461
Oh, yeah?

1501
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:18,360
Just ran into
two of your geologists.

1502
02:15:18,436 --> 02:15:20,961
Geologists whose hands
aren't all chewed up.

1503
02:15:21,038 --> 02:15:25,099
Lowell, do not...
screw this up.

1504
02:15:25,176 --> 02:15:27,542
We are a week away
from an arrest.

1505
02:15:27,611 --> 02:15:31,945
- So I'll hold it. And?
- We'll give you a heads-up
before we launch.

1506
02:15:32,016 --> 02:15:34,507
- How long?
- Three hours.

1507
02:15:34,585 --> 02:15:36,519
<i>You got a deal.</i>

1508
02:15:51,836 --> 02:15:55,499
<i>... like the testimony before Congress</i>
<i>of Dr. Wigand's former boss,</i>

1509
02:15:55,573 --> 02:15:59,339
<i>Brown & Williamson's chief</i>
<i>executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.</i>

1510
02:15:59,410 --> 02:16:01,640
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1511
02:16:01,712 --> 02:16:04,203
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1512
02:16:04,281 --> 02:16:07,978
- because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.
- All of us did.

1513
02:16:08,052 --> 02:16:10,247
There was this
whole line of people,

1514
02:16:10,321 --> 02:16:12,846
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1515
02:16:12,923 --> 02:16:16,017
Part of the reason I'm here
is that I felt...

1516
02:16:16,093 --> 02:16:18,288
that their representation...

1517
02:16:47,725 --> 02:16:49,659
...can be more rapidly absorbed
in the lung...

1518
02:16:49,727 --> 02:16:51,854
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1519
02:17:16,554 --> 02:17:18,488
- Hello?
- Jim, it's Lowell.

1520
02:17:18,556 --> 02:17:22,287
- Hey, where are you?
- Remember that night at P.J.'s?

1521
02:17:22,359 --> 02:17:25,886
You asked me if we were
sitting on something explosive.
Well, we're not sitting on it.

1522
02:17:25,963 --> 02:17:29,660
CBS Corporate leaned on CBS News,
which yanked an interview we did...

1523
02:17:29,733 --> 02:17:33,692
with a top-ranking tobacco scientist,
corporate officer.

1524
02:17:33,771 --> 02:17:35,830
They're trying to
close down the story.

1525
02:17:35,906 --> 02:17:39,171
You mean, <i>60 Minutes</i>
is letting CBS Corporate...

1526
02:17:39,243 --> 02:17:41,609
decide what is
or is not news?

1527
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:44,307
What's Wallace think
about this? Or Hewitt, or...

1528
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:46,508
How prominent?
What kind of placement?

1529
02:17:46,584 --> 02:17:50,042
Oh, come on, Lowell. This is
<i>The New York Times.</i> I don't know.

1530
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:54,318
Well, until you do, all I can
tell you is what you already know.

1531
02:17:54,391 --> 02:17:56,382
They will not
air an interview.

1532
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:58,860
Call me back in ten.

1533
02:18:06,670 --> 02:18:08,968
- Hello?
- Debbie, it's me.

1534
02:18:09,039 --> 02:18:11,473
Hi.
What time is it?

1535
02:18:11,542 --> 02:18:15,569
- Oh, it's late.
- That I know. When are you coming back?

1536
02:18:15,646 --> 02:18:18,410
I can't get out of here till
mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night.

1537
02:18:18,482 --> 02:18:22,145
Listen, could you call a number
for me? It's in Mississippi.

1538
02:18:22,219 --> 02:18:24,153
Okay.
Hold on a second.

1539
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:28,592
What is it?

1540
02:18:34,431 --> 02:18:36,365
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1541
02:18:36,433 --> 02:18:40,426
All right, Lowell. Page one.
Editorial's interested. Let's talk.

1542
02:18:40,503 --> 02:18:44,906
Here's how it works. You ask me
questions. I tell you if you're wrong.

1543
02:18:44,975 --> 02:18:49,241
- Lowell, you sure you want to do this?
- Why?

1544
02:18:49,312 --> 02:18:52,873
Hey, it doesn't work,
you've burned your bridges, man.

1545
02:18:52,949 --> 02:18:55,110
You ready?

1546
02:18:55,185 --> 02:18:57,745
Okay.
About this whistle-blower,

1547
02:18:57,821 --> 02:19:00,551
did Mike and Don go along
with the corporate decision?

1548
02:19:02,692 --> 02:19:07,493
- Lowell?
- Did I tell you you were wrong?

1549
02:19:07,564 --> 02:19:11,523
No. Um, I'm assuming
the cave-in begins...

1550
02:19:11,601 --> 02:19:14,001
with the threat of litigation
from Big Tobacco.

1551
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:16,561
Are we talking, uh...

1552
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:19,507
Are we talking
Brown & Williamson here?

1553
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:54,401
Did I get you up?

1554
02:19:54,477 --> 02:19:58,504
No, I usually sit around
my hotel room dressed like this
at 5:30 in the morning,

1555
02:19:58,581 --> 02:20:00,515
sleepy look on my face.

1556
02:20:02,552 --> 02:20:04,543
How many shows have
we done? Huh?

1557
02:20:04,621 --> 02:20:06,714
- Come on. How many?
- Oh, lots.

1558
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:08,724
That's right.

1559
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:13,151
But in all that time,
Mike,

1560
02:20:13,229 --> 02:20:16,027
did you ever get off a plane,
walk into a room...

1561
02:20:16,099 --> 02:20:21,298
and find that a source
for a story changed his mind?

1562
02:20:21,371 --> 02:20:23,669
Lost his heart?
Walked out on us?

1563
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:26,436
Not one fucking time.
You wanna know why?

1564
02:20:26,509 --> 02:20:29,034
I see a rhetorical question
on the horizon.

1565
02:20:29,112 --> 02:20:31,046
I'm gonna tell you why.

1566
02:20:31,114 --> 02:20:34,572
Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

1567
02:20:34,651 --> 02:20:38,781
Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage...

1568
02:20:38,855 --> 02:20:41,585
- to point me down the shining
path, to show me the way.
- Oh, please, Mike.

1569
02:20:41,658 --> 02:20:43,922
- Give me a break.
- You give me a break.

1570
02:20:43,993 --> 02:20:47,121
I never left a source
hung out to dry <i>ever.</i>

1571
02:20:47,197 --> 02:20:50,098
Abandoned.
Not till right fucking now.

1572
02:20:50,166 --> 02:20:53,897
When I came on this job,
I came with my word intact.

1573
02:20:53,970 --> 02:20:57,929
I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
Fuck the rules of the game!

1574
02:20:58,007 --> 02:20:59,941
Hell, you're supposed
to know me, Mike.

1575
02:21:00,009 --> 02:21:02,102
What the hell
did you expect?

1576
02:21:02,178 --> 02:21:04,840
You expect me to lie down?

1577
02:21:04,914 --> 02:21:07,906
Back off?
Or get over it?

1578
02:21:07,984 --> 02:21:12,182
In the real world, when you get to where
I am, there are other considerations.

1579
02:21:12,255 --> 02:21:15,452
Like what?
Corporate responsibility?

1580
02:21:15,525 --> 02:21:17,755
- What, are we talking celebrity here?
- I'm not...

1581
02:21:17,827 --> 02:21:21,786
I'm not talking about
celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm...

1582
02:21:21,865 --> 02:21:23,799
I'm...
I'm talking about...

1583
02:21:23,867 --> 02:21:27,997
when you're nearer the end
of your life than the beginning.

1584
02:21:28,071 --> 02:21:31,802
And what do you think
you think about then? The future?

1585
02:21:31,875 --> 02:21:34,537
"In the future, I'm gonna
do this, become that"?

1586
02:21:34,611 --> 02:21:36,806
What future? No.

1587
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,781
What you think is...

1588
02:21:39,849 --> 02:21:42,374
"How will I be regarded
in the end...

1589
02:21:42,452 --> 02:21:46,047
after I'm gone?"

1590
02:21:46,122 --> 02:21:50,081
Oh, along the way, I suppose
I made some minor impact.

1591
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:54,221
I did Irangate,
the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,

1592
02:21:54,297 --> 02:21:57,061
Martin Luther King,
Saddam, Sadat, etc., etc.

1593
02:21:57,133 --> 02:22:01,832
I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building...

1594
02:22:01,905 --> 02:22:03,839
all that.

1595
02:22:05,441 --> 02:22:10,777
But history only remembers most
what you did last.

1596
02:22:10,847 --> 02:22:13,975
And should that be
fronting a segment...

1597
02:22:14,050 --> 02:22:17,816
that allowed a tobacco giant
to crash this network...

1598
02:22:24,027 --> 02:22:26,552
Does it give someone...

1599
02:22:26,629 --> 02:22:31,931
at my time of life pause?

1600
02:22:32,001 --> 02:22:33,935
Yeah.

1601
02:22:40,877 --> 02:22:42,811
Mike,

1602
02:22:44,581 --> 02:22:46,515
in my...

1603
02:22:48,651 --> 02:22:51,814
You and I
have been doing this...

1604
02:22:51,888 --> 02:22:55,722
together for 14 years.

1605
02:22:57,360 --> 02:23:00,329
This is today's
<i>New York Times.</i>

1606
02:23:00,396 --> 02:23:02,591
In it is the whole
sordid story...

1607
02:23:02,665 --> 02:23:06,226
of what went on
inside our shop.

1608
02:23:06,302 --> 02:23:10,830
And in the editorial,
it accuses us...

1609
02:23:10,907 --> 02:23:13,876
of betraying the legacy
of Edward R. Murrow.

1610
02:23:39,134 --> 02:23:41,898
They conclude most of it
seems pretty unsubstantiated.

1611
02:23:51,046 --> 02:23:52,980
You're full of shit,
John.

1612
02:24:03,625 --> 02:24:05,593
Yeah.

1613
02:24:05,661 --> 02:24:08,357
<i>Front page. There's a picture of Wigand.</i>

1614
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:10,364
<i>Article's entitled,</i>
<i>"Getting Personal."</i>

1615
02:24:10,432 --> 02:24:12,423
Byline to Suein Hwang
and Milo Geyelin.

1616
02:24:12,501 --> 02:24:14,935
Wait. Hold on
a second, Lowell.

1617
02:24:15,003 --> 02:24:16,868
Yeah.

1618
02:24:21,376 --> 02:24:24,004
Yeah, I'll see
if I can find him.

1619
02:24:24,079 --> 02:24:27,207
Yeah, hold on.
Don's looking for you.

1620
02:24:27,282 --> 02:24:30,683
- Good.
- The subheading
is " Brown & Williamson...

1621
02:24:30,752 --> 02:24:33,949
has a 500-page dossier
attacking chief critic."

1622
02:24:34,022 --> 02:24:36,422
It quotes Richard Scruggs
calling it the worst kind...

1623
02:24:36,491 --> 02:24:39,790
of an organized smear campaign
against a whistle-blower.

1624
02:24:39,861 --> 02:24:43,353
"A close look at the file
and independent research
by this newspaper...

1625
02:24:43,432 --> 02:24:46,731
"into its key claim indicates
that many of the serious allegations...

1626
02:24:46,802 --> 02:24:52,104
against Mr. Wigand are backed by
scant or contradictory evidence."

1627
02:25:11,526 --> 02:25:14,222
<i>This news division has been vilified...</i>

1628
02:25:14,296 --> 02:25:17,129
in <i>The New York Times,</i>
in print, on television...

1629
02:25:17,199 --> 02:25:19,133
for caving
to corporate interests!

1630
02:25:19,201 --> 02:25:23,160
<i>The New York Times</i> ran a
blow-by-blow of what we talked
about behind closed doors.

1631
02:25:23,238 --> 02:25:25,968
- You fucked us!
- No! You fucked you!

1632
02:25:26,041 --> 02:25:28,032
Don't invert stuff.

1633
02:25:28,110 --> 02:25:30,943
Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand.
You bought it.

1634
02:25:31,012 --> 02:25:33,947
The <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>
here... not exactly...

1635
02:25:34,015 --> 02:25:36,711
a bastion of
anti-capitalist sentiment,

1636
02:25:36,785 --> 02:25:39,345
refutes Big Tobacco's
smear campaign...

1637
02:25:39,421 --> 02:25:42,857
as the lowest form
of character assassination.

1638
02:25:42,924 --> 02:25:44,892
And now, even now,
when every word...

1639
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,952
of what Wigand has said
on our show is printed,

1640
02:25:48,029 --> 02:25:51,658
the entire deposition
of his testimony in a court of law...

1641
02:25:51,733 --> 02:25:53,894
in the state of Mississippi,
the cat...

1642
02:25:53,969 --> 02:25:56,665
<i>totally</i> out of the bag,

1643
02:25:56,738 --> 02:25:58,797
you're still
standing here debating.

1644
02:25:58,874 --> 02:26:03,208
<i>Don, what the hell else</i>
<i>do you need?</i>

1645
02:26:03,278 --> 02:26:05,678
Mike, you tell him.

1646
02:26:05,747 --> 02:26:07,715
You fucked up, Don.

1647
02:26:15,023 --> 02:26:18,049
It's old news. Stick with me,
like always. We'll be okay.

1648
02:26:18,126 --> 02:26:21,220
These things have
a half-life of 15 minutes.

1649
02:26:21,296 --> 02:26:25,289
No, that's fame.
Fame has a 15-minute half-life.

1650
02:26:25,367 --> 02:26:27,335
Infamy lasts
a little longer.

1651
02:26:27,402 --> 02:26:32,601
<i>We caved. It's foolish.</i>
<i>It's simply dead wrong.</i>

1652
02:26:32,674 --> 02:26:36,576
Now this is what we're going to do.
We're going over to Black Rock...

1653
02:26:40,315 --> 02:26:44,752
Okay? So let's get back to work.
Now what we saw there...

1654
02:26:44,820 --> 02:26:47,448
<i>was two potassium chlorate...</i>

1655
02:26:47,522 --> 02:26:52,687
would yield two potassium
chloride, also a solid...

1656
02:27:02,737 --> 02:27:07,037
They cancelled the 6:00.
I don't know why. I...

1657
02:27:07,108 --> 02:27:10,874
I'm on the 8:10.
I should be home... 9:30.

1658
02:27:10,946 --> 02:27:13,414
I'll see you then.
I love you. Bye.

1659
02:27:27,662 --> 02:27:29,630
- Oh. Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks.

1660
02:27:42,277 --> 02:27:44,245
CBS management wouldn't
let us broadcast...

1661
02:27:44,312 --> 02:27:47,804
our original story and our
interview with Jeffrey Wigand...

1662
02:27:47,883 --> 02:27:50,283
because they were worried
about the possibility...

1663
02:27:50,352 --> 02:27:53,253
of a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit against us...

1664
02:27:53,321 --> 02:27:55,619
<i>for tortious interference.</i>

1665
02:27:55,690 --> 02:27:57,885
<i>But now things have changed.</i>

1666
02:27:57,959 --> 02:28:00,757
<i>What Dr. Wigand told us</i>
<i>was that his former...</i>

1667
02:28:29,958 --> 02:28:32,893
<i> This industry,</i>
<i>in my opinion, is an industry...</i>

1668
02:28:32,961 --> 02:28:36,920
that has perpetrated the biggest fraud
on the American public in history.

1669
02:28:36,998 --> 02:28:39,125
They've killed millions
and millions of...

1670
02:29:02,257 --> 02:29:05,488
<i>You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?</i>

1671
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:09,894
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

1672
02:29:09,965 --> 02:29:15,130
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

1673
02:29:15,203 --> 02:29:17,137
If you ask me...

1674
02:29:17,205 --> 02:29:20,197
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

1675
02:29:23,144 --> 02:29:25,078
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

1676
02:29:30,652 --> 02:29:34,418
I promised you a three-hour
heads up. Here it is.

1677
02:29:34,489 --> 02:29:37,925
Have a camera crew standing by
in Helena, Montana on Tuesday,

1678
02:29:37,993 --> 02:29:39,927
and I'll give you
a three-hour head start.

1679
02:29:39,995 --> 02:29:43,362
All right? By the way, that was
a hell of a good show tonight.

1680
02:29:43,431 --> 02:29:45,422
- Thank you, Bill.
- Yeah.

1681
02:30:04,819 --> 02:30:08,084
You won.

1682
02:30:08,156 --> 02:30:10,090
Yeah.

1683
02:30:13,428 --> 02:30:15,362
What did I win?

1684
02:30:19,132 --> 02:30:23,432
<i> Reporting</i>

You know, we beat everybody.
ABC, NBC, CNN.

02:30:56,603 --> 02:30:58,537
Mike.

1693

That Canada story...

1694
02:31:08,548 --> 02:31:10,482
still interest you?

1695
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:14,509
Everything interests me.

Uh, I quit, Mike.

1697
02:31:18,926 --> 02:31:20,860
Bullshit.

Come on.

You came out okay
in the end.

1701
02:31:30,637 --> 02:31:32,605
I did?

1702
02:31:32,673 --> 02:31:35,938
What do I tell a source
on the next tough story?

1703
02:31:36,009 --> 02:31:38,944
"Hang in with us.
You'll be fine. Maybe."

1704
02:31:39,012 --> 02:31:41,810
No.

1705
02:31:41,882 --> 02:31:44,908
What got broken here...

1706
02:31:44,985 --> 02:31:47,476
doesn't go
back together again.

1707
02:31:52,159 --> 02:31:54,525
So, uh...
