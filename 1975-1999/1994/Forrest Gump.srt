00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:21,557
Hello. My name's
Forrest... Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,439
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,447
I could eat about a million
and a half of these.

4
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:38,448
My mama always said

5
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:42,247
life was like
a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,449
You never know what
you're going to get.

7
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:56,800
Those must be
comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:56,868 --> 00:04:00,235
I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that

9
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,239
and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,912
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,413
My feet hurt.

12
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:12,416
Mama always said
there's an awful lot

13
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:16,420
you can tell about
a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,422
Where they're going,

15
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,957
where they've been.

16
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:29,558
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:34,438
I bet if I think
about it real hard

18
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,940
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,780
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.

20
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,939
[Gump]
She said they was my magic shoes.

21
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:49,452
All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.

22
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:57,823
Les take a little walk around.

23
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:07,061
How do those feel?

24
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:12,772
His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:15,277
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:19,406
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,850
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,182
Forrest!

29
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:26,916
Now, when I was a baby,

30
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,754
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero

31
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:30,828
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

32
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:31,920
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

33
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:35,431
She said we was related
to him in some way.

34
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:36,932
What he did was,

35
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,436
he started up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.

36
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:43,940
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bedsheets

37
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:48,444
and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.

38
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:52,448
They'd even put bedsheets
on their horses and ride around.

39
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:56,577
And, anyway, thas how
I got my name... Forrest Gump.

40
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:59,986
Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me

41
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,992
that sometimes we all
do things that, well,

42
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,494
that just don't make no sense.

43
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:17,439
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

44
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,668
All right.

45
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,677
What are y'all staring at?

46
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:23,178
Haven't you ever seen

47
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:26,238
a little boy with braces
on his legs before?

48
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,917
Don't ever let anybody

49
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,419
tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.

50
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:33,922
If God intended everybody
to be the same,

51
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,925
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

52
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:40,929
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

53
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:45,465
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

54
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:48,470
about a half mile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.

55
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,473
Thas in the county
of Greenbow.

56
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,975
Our house had been
in Mama's family

57
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:56,102
since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa

58
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,615
had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.

59
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:02,048
Since it wasjust me and Mama

60
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:04,052
and we had all these empty rooms,

61
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,554
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

62
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,056
mostly to people passing through,

63
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:11,719
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

64
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:14,730
Thas how me and Mama got money.

65
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:17,562
Mama was a real smart lady.

66
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,568
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

67
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:22,662
You're no different
than anybody else is.

68
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:27,408
Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?

69
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,911
You're the same
as everybody else.

70
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,913
You are no different.

71
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:36,645
Your boy's... different,
Mrs. Gump.

72
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,153
His I.Q. Is 75.

73
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,747
Well, we're all different,

74
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,087
Mr. Hancock.

75
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,763
She wanted me to have
the finest education

76
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:52,268
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

77
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:55,270
I met the principal and all.

78
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:58,603
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

79
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:01,075
Now, this is normal.

80
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:06,138
Forrest is right here.

81
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:09,049
The state requires
a minimum I.Q. Of 80

82
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:10,847
to attend public school.

83
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,217
Mrs. Gump,

84
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:15,189
he's going to have to
go to a special school.

85
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:17,692
Now, he'll be just fine.

86
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,194
What does normal mean anyway?

87
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:22,197
He might be...

88
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:24,392
a bit on the slow side,

89
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:25,900
but my boy Forrest

90
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:28,904
is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else.

91
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,065
He's not going to
some special school

92
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,074
to learn how to retread tires.

93
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:36,134
We're talking about
five little points here.

94
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,882
There must be something
can be done.

95
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,410
We're a progressive
school system.

96
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:48,252
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

97
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:53,091
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

98
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,899
He's on vacation.

99
00:08:58,032 --> 00:09:03,436
Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee!

100
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:06,029
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

101
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:08,132
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

102
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,885
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

103
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:20,386
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

104
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,086
You don't say much, do you?

105
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:32,832
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

106
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,300
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

107
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:38,405
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

108
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,733
"Finally, he had to try.

109
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:43,742
"It looked easy, but...

110
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,404
oh, what happened.
First they..."

111
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:49,744
Mama, whas vacation mean?

112
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,078
Vacation?

113
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,914
Where Daddy went?

114
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:57,585
Vacation's when
you go somewhere...

115
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:02,257
and you don't ever come back.

116
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:08,266
Anyway, I guess you could say

117
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:10,894
me and Mama was on our own.

118
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,938
But we didn't mind.

119
00:10:13,006 --> 00:10:15,440
Our house was never empty.

120
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,443
There was always folks
coming and going.

121
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:19,603
Supper!

122
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,112
Ls supper, everyone!

123
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,705
That sure looks special.

124
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:25,615
Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us

125
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:29,121
that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,

126
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,623
folks living
out of their suitcases

127
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:35,127
and hat cases
and sample cases.

128
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:38,892
Forrest Gump,
is suppertime! Forrest?

129
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:41,798
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

130
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:44,962
and he had him a guitar case.

131
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:47,233
[Guitar Plays]

132
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:53,308
# Well, you ain't
never caught a rabbit #

133
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,971
#And you ain't no #

134
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:56,572
# Friend of mine ##

135
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,043
Forrest,

136
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,883
I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

137
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,389
No, thas all right, ma'am.

138
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,893
I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.

139
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:10,896
All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

140
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:13,899
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

141
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,403
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you did there.

142
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,903
Slow it down some.

143
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,440
#You ain't nothing but... #

144
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,806
I liked that guitar.

145
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:26,471
It sounded good.

146
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:31,779
I started moving around
to the music,

147
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,785
swinging my hips.

148
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:35,946
# Cryin' all the time ##

149
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:37,512
This one night,

150
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,524
me and Mama was out shopping,

151
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:42,026
and we walked by Vincy's
Furniture and Appliance Store,

152
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,084
and guess what?

153
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:49,568
#You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog #

154
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:52,696
#Cryin'all the time #

155
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,341
#You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog #

156
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:59,310
This is not for
children's eyes.

157
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:01,438
#Cryin'all the time #

158
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:02,947
Some years later,

159
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:05,951
that handsome young man
who they called the King,

160
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,920
well, he sung too many songs.

161
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:11,923
Had himself a heart attack
or something.

162
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:14,983
It must be hard being a king.

163
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:20,932
You know, is funny how you
remember some things,

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,932
but some things you can't.

165
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:25,468
You do your very best now, Forrest.

166
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,938
I sure will, Mama.

167
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:31,534
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school

168
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:32,942
very well.

169
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:37,880
Are you coming along?

170
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:41,443
Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers.

171
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,046
This is the bus to school.

172
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:49,324
I'm Forrest...
Forrest Gump.

173
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,192
I'm Dorothy Harris.

174
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,698
Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore.

175
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:09,142
This seas taken.

176
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,014
Ls taken.

177
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:22,017
You can't sit here.

178
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:28,267
You know, is funny what
a young man recollects,

179
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,666
'cause I don't
remember being born.

180
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:34,138
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

181
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,640
and I don't know

182
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,142
when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,

183
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:39,644
but I do remember

184
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:43,705
the first time I heard
the sweetest voice

185
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,683
in the wide world.

186
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,687
You can sit here
if you want.

187
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:54,892
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

188
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:57,555
She was like an angel.

189
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,396
Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?

190
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,530
Whas wrong with your legs?

191
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:09,541
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

192
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,407
My legs are just fine and dandy.

193
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,413
I just sat next to her
on that bus

194
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,416
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

195
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,918
My back's crooked
like a question mark.

196
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,615
Next to Mama,
no one ever talked to me

197
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,090
or asked me questions.

198
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,423
Are you stupid or something?

199
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:31,554
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

200
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,623
I'm Jenny.

201
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:37,261
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

202
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,770
From that day on,
we was always together.

203
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,399
Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.

204
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,411
She taught me how to climb.

205
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,971
Come on, Forrest,
you can do it.

206
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,711
I showed her how to dangle.

207
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:54,309
"A good little..."

208
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:56,821
She helped me
learn how to read,

209
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,983
and I showed her how to swing.

210
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,561
Sometimes, we'djust sit out

211
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,927
and wait for the stars.

212
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,466
Mama's going to worry about me.

213
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,435
Just stay a little longer.

214
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:15,600
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.

215
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:18,439
O.K., Jenny, I'll stay.

216
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:22,811
She was my most special friend.

217
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:26,780
My only friend.

218
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:31,456
Now, my mama always told me

219
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,458
that miracles happen every day.

220
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,460
Some people don't think so,

221
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,018
but they do.

222
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,391
Hey, dummy!

223
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,936
Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?

224
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,767
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

225
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,170
Just run away, Forrest.

226
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,607
Run, Forrest!

227
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,769
Run away! Hurry!

228
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,403
Get the bikes!

229
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,277
Les get him! Come on!

230
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,146
Look out, Gump!

231
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:01,084
We're going to get you!

232
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,281
Run, Forrest, run!

233
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:05,381
Run, Forrest!

234
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:08,317
Come back here, you!

235
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:12,592
Ha ha ha ha ha!

236
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,907
Run, Forrest!

237
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,569
Run!

238
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:59,773
Now, you wouldn't
believe if I told you...

239
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:04,078
but I could run
like the wind blows.

240
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:08,409
From that day on,

241
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,921
if I was going somewhere,

242
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,356
I was running.

243
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,561
That boy sure
is a running fool.

244
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,464
Now, remember how I told you

245
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,467
that Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

246
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,902
She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

247
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,600
Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was 5,

248
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:08,112
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

249
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:09,407
Jenny?

250
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,415
He was a very loving man.

251
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:16,647
He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.

252
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,423
And then this one time,

253
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,426
Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.

254
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,928
Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?

255
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,431
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

256
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:29,591
Jenny!

257
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,931
Come on!

258
00:18:32,003 --> 00:18:34,938
Jenny, where'd you run to?

259
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:37,531
You better
get back here, girl!

260
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,675
Where you at?

261
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,449
Jenny!

262
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:48,382
Jenny, where you at?

263
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,156
Jenny!

264
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,157
Pray with me, Forrest.

265
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:55,658
Pray with me.

266
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:56,955
Jenny!

267
00:18:57,028 --> 00:19:00,327
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

268
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,332
far, far away from here.

269
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,337
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far.

270
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:10,340
Mama always said
God is mysterious.

271
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:11,739
Jenny!

272
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,744
He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.

273
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:16,575
Instead,

274
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,582
he had the police say

275
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,086
Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.

276
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:24,587
She was to live
with her grandma,

277
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,590
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

278
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:30,651
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

279
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,122
Some nights,

280
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:35,131
Jenny'd sneak out

281
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,633
and come on over to my house,

282
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,136
just 'cause
she said she was scared.

283
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:43,196
Scared of what,
I don't know.

284
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,936
But I think
it was her grandma's dog.

285
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,945
He was a mean dog.

286
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:52,176
Anyway, Jenny and me
was best friends

287
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,740
all the way up
through high school.

288
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:56,185
Hey, stupid!

289
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:58,222
Quit it!

290
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,722
Run, Forrest, run!

291
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,190
Hey,

292
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,284
didn't you hear me, stupid?

293
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,293
Run, Forrest!

294
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:05,693
Get in the truck!

295
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:09,096
Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!

296
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,635
Run, Forrest! Run!

297
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:16,335
Ha, ha!

298
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:18,602
Move it! Move it!

299
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,507
You better be runnin'!

300
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:33,989
Yeah!

301
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,720
- Whoo-hoo!
- Go!

302
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,821
Run, Forrest!

303
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:45,492
Now, it used to be

304
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,505
I ran to get
where I was going.

305
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,906
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

306
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:17,866
Ohh!

307
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:22,597
Who in the hell is that?

308
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:25,471
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

309
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:27,534
Just a local idiot.

310
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,978
And can you believe it?

311
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,845
I got to go to college, too.

312
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,989
Forrest, move it!

313
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:40,989
Run!

314
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:41,990
O. K!

315
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,151
Run!

316
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:46,060
Run, you stupid
son of a bitch! Run!

317
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,811
Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!

318
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:06,711
Run! Run! Go!

319
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,559
[Whistle Blows]

320
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:21,531
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

321
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,567
but he sure is fast.

322
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:28,402
Now, maybe isjust me,

323
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,532
but college was
very confusing times.

324
00:22:32,877 --> 00:22:35,209
Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,

325
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,543
integrated the University
of Alabama today.

326
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:39,139
Two Negroes were admitted,

327
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:41,151
but only after
Governor George Wallace

328
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:43,153
had carried out
his symbolic threat

329
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:45,655
to stand in the schoolhouse door.

330
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:48,487
I take it from that statement...

331
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,493
Earl, whas going on?

332
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,995
Coons are trying
to get into school.

333
00:22:53,064 --> 00:22:55,999
Coons? When raccoons tried
getting on our back porch,

334
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:58,501
Mama just chased them off
with a broom.

335
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:00,434
Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.

336
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,439
And they want to go
to school with us.

337
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,441
With us? They do?

338
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,443
[TV Reporter]
Shortly after Governor Wallace

339
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,446
had carried out his promise
to block the doorway,

340
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,574
Kennedy ordered the secretary
of defense to use military force.

341
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:15,983
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter

342
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:18,487
by General Graham, commander
of the National Guard,

343
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,114
and Governor Wallace.

344
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,955
Because these National Guardsmen

345
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,463
are here today as
federal soldiers for Alabama,

346
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,464
and they live within our borders.

347
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,466
They are our brothers.

348
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,128
We are winning in this fight,

349
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,139
because we are awakening
the American people

350
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:40,143
to the dangers that
we have spoken about so many times

351
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,145
that is so evident today...

352
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:46,013
A trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.

353
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,987
And so, at day's end,

354
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,513
the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,

355
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:57,117
and studentsJimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

356
00:23:57,194 --> 00:24:01,062
had been signed up
for summer classes.

357

Ma'am, you dropped your book.

358
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:06,294
Ma'am.

359
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,804
[Chet Huntley] Governor Wallace
did what he promised.

00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:12,468
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob...

361
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:14,010
Say, wasn't that Gump?

362
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,103
Naw, that couldn't be.

363
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,115
It sure as hell was.

364
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,488
[Gump]
A few years later,

365
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:26,989
that angry little man
at the schoolhouse door

366
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:30,084
thought id be a good idea
and ran for president.

367
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,193
But somebody thought
that it wasn't.

368
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,861
But he didn't die.

369
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,975
My bus is here.

370
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:47,977
Is it the number 9?

371
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:49,979
No, is the number 4.

372
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,572
It was nice talking to you.

373
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,483
I remember when that happened,

374
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:58,988
when Wallace got shot.

375
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,421
I was in college.

376
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:02,925
Did you go to a girls' college

377
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:05,360
or a girls' and boys'
together college?

378
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:06,623
It was coed.

379
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:09,427
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

380
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,593
It was a college
just for girls.

381
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,105
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

382
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:23,942
#I don't know why I love you #

383
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:27,505
#But I do #

384
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:33,345
#I don't know why I cry so #

385
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:35,890
#But I do #

386
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:43,428
#I only know I know that... #

387
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,433
Ohh!

388
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,934
That hurts.

389
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:51,963
#But I don't know why
I love you #

390
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:55,033
#But I do #

391
00:25:58,047 --> 00:25:59,571
Forrest!

392
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:01,913
Forrest!

393
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:03,918
Forrest, stop it!

394
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:05,419
Stop it!

395
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:06,921
What are you doing?

396
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:08,422
He was hurting you.

397
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,924
No, he wasn't!

398
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:11,926
Get over there!

399
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:13,427
Billy, I'm sorry.

400
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:14,929
Just keep away from me.

401
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:16,931
Don't be such... Don't go.

402
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:18,933
Billy, wait a second.

403
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:21,367
He doesn't know any better.

404
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:26,031
Forrest, why'd you do that?

405
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:31,947
I brought you some chocolate.

406
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:33,242
I'm sorry.

407
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,452
I'll go back
to my college now.

408
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:39,783
Forrest...

409
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,549
Look at you.

410
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:47,962
Come on.

411
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,122
Come on.

412
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:51,063
[Thunder]

413
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:57,738
Is this your own room?

414
00:26:57,807 --> 00:26:58,739
Shh!

415
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:04,647
Do you ever dream, Forrest...

416
00:27:06,215 --> 00:27:08,149
about who you're going to be?

417
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:10,818
Who I'm going to be?

418
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:11,818
Yeah.

419
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:13,821
Aren't I going to be me?

420
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:15,151
You'll always be you,

421
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:17,158
just another kind of you.

422
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,319
You know?

423
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:21,329
I want to be famous.

424
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:26,159
I want to be a singer
like Joan Baez.

425
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,169
I just want to be...

426
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:29,670
on an empty stage

427
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:32,332
with my guitar, my voice.

428
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:35,001
Just me.

429
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:40,181
And I want to reach people
on a personal level.

430
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:45,018
I want to be able
to say things,

431
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:46,520
just one to one.

432
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,954
Have you ever been
with a girl, Forrest?

433
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,299
I sit next to them

434
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:01,859
in my home economics class
all the time.

435
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:28,388
Oh...

436
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:29,556
Oh...

437
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,061
Oh, I'm sorry.

438
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:33,158
Ls O.K.

439
00:28:33,235 --> 00:28:34,167
Sorry.

440
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:37,667
Oh...

441
00:28:39,408 --> 00:28:41,342
Oh...

442
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,900
ls all right.

443
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:47,581
Ls O.K.

444
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:49,082
Oh, I'm dizzy.

445
00:28:56,992 --> 00:29:00,359
I'll bet that never
happened in home ec.

446
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,033
No.

447
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:15,174
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

448
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:17,677
I don't care.
I don't like her anyway.

449
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:20,339
Run! Run! Run! Run!

450
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:22,508
Run! Run! Run! Run!

451
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,016
Run! Run! Run! Run!

452
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:26,053
Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

453
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,055
Stop! Stop! Stop!

454
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:35,195
College ran by real fast

455
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:38,433
'cause I played
so much football.

456
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:39,692
They even put me on a thing

457
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,200
called the all-America team

458
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,032
where you get to meet

459
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:45,038
the president of the United States.

460
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:46,368
President Kennedy met

461
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:48,602
with the collegiate
all-American football team

462
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:50,110
at the Oval Office today.

463
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:51,938
Now the really good thing

464
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:54,946
about meeting the president
of the United States

465
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:56,447
is the food.

466
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:58,780
They put you in this little room

467
00:29:58,852 --> 00:30:02,447
with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.

468
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:04,114
But since, number one,

469
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,782
I wasn't hungry but thirsty,

470
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:08,453
and number two, they was free,

471
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:12,294
I must have drank me
about 15 Dr. Peppers.

472
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:14,765
[Burp]

473
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,428
How does it feel
to be an all-American?

474
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:18,766
Ls an honor, sir.

475
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:21,432
How does it feel
to be an all-American?

476
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,476
Very good, sir.

477
00:30:23,543 --> 00:30:26,137
How does it feel
to be an all-American?

478
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:27,645
Very good, sir.

479
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,648
Congratulations.
How do you feel?

480
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:32,150
I got to pee.

481
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:34,743
I believe he said
he had to pee.

482
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:52,099
Some time later,
for no particular reason,

483
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:55,471
somebody shot
that nice young president

484
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:57,942
when he was riding
in his car.

485
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:59,876
And a few years after that,

486
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,380
somebody shot
his little brother, too,

487
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:04,780
only he was
in a hotel kitchen.

488
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:08,112
Must be hard being brothers.

489
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,020
I wouldn't know.

490
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,486
Forrest Gump.

491
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,992
Now can you believe it?

492
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,494
After only five years
of playing football,

493
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,155
I got a college degree.

494
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:20,825
Congratulations, son.

495
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,027
Mama was so proud.

496
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,534
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.

497
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:28,198
I'll hold this for you.

498
00:31:28,274 --> 00:31:30,367
Congratulations, son.

499
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:33,037
Have you given any thought
to your future?

500
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:36,581
Thought?

501
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,751
Hello. I'm Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

502
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,411
Nobody gives a horse's shit

503
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:43,079
who you are, pus ball!

504
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:45,920
You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!

505
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:48,256
Get your maggoty ass
on the bus!

506
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:49,761
You're in the army now!

507
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,592
Seas taken.

508
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:54,925
Taken.

509
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:00,905
At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.

510
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,908
It was only
my induction day,

511
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:05,035
and I was getting yelled at.

512
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:11,209
Sit down if you want to.

513
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:13,548
I didn't know who I might meet

514
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,053
or what they might ask.

515
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:17,885
You ever been
on a real shrimp boat?

516
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:19,720
No.

517
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,556
But I been on a real big boat.

518
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,564
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

519
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:28,567
I been working on
shrimp boats all my life.

520
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:30,899
I started out
on my uncle's boat

521
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,904
when I was about maybe 9.

522
00:32:32,972 --> 00:32:35,907
I was just looking
into buying my own boat

523
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:37,909
and got drafted.

524
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:41,242
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

525
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:43,578
People call me Bubba,

526
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,084
just like one of them
old redneck boys.

527
00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:47,414
Can you believe that?

528
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,580
My name's Forrest Gump.

529
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:51,920
People call me Forrest Gump.

530
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:54,926
So Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

531
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:56,723
and his mama cooked shrimp.

532
00:32:58,698 --> 00:33:01,064
And her mama
before her cooked shrimp,

533
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:04,729
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

534
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:06,567
Bubba's family knew everything

535
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:09,073
there was to know about
the shrimping business.

536
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,406
I know everything
there is to know

537
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:12,739
about the shrimping business.

538
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:15,246
I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

539
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:17,579
after I get out of the army.

540
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:21,475
O.K.

541
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:22,816
Gump!

542
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,483
Whas your sole purpose
in this army?

543
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,992
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

544
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:31,656
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

545
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,165
Thas the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard.

546
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,827
You must have
a goddamn I.Q. Of 160.

547
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:39,497
You are goddamn gifted,
Private Gump.

548
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,004
Listen up, people!

549
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:46,011
Now for some reason,
I fit in the army

550
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,013
like one of them round pegs.

551
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,343
Ls not really hard.

552
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:51,349
You just make your bed neat,

553
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,850
remember to stand up straight,

554
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,511
and always answer every question

555
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,521
with "Yes, Drill Sergeant."

556
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:58,022
Is that clear?

557
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:00,355
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

558
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:03,862
What you do is drag your nets
along the bottom.

559
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,192
On a good day,

560
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:08,199
you can catch over
a hundred pounds of shrimp.

561
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:09,529
Everything goes all right,

562
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:11,365
2 men shrimping 10 hours,

563
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:13,530
less what you spends on gas...

564
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:15,699
Done, Drill Sergeant!

565
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,208
Gump!

566
00:34:18,778 --> 00:34:21,713
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

567
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:23,715
You told me to,
Drill Sergeant.

568
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:25,375
Jesus H. Christ.

569
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:27,385
This is a new company record.

570
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:28,886
If it wasn't a waste

571
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,388
of a fine enlisted man,

572
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,890
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

573
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,223
You're going to be
a general someday!

574
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:37,228
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

575
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:41,232
Anyway, like I was saying,

576
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,564
shrimp is the fruit
of the sea.

577
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:46,901
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it,

578
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:48,406
bake it, sauté it.

579
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:51,568
They's, uh, shrimp kabobs,
shrimp creole,

580
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:55,580
shrimp gumbo,
pan fried, deep fried,

581
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:56,910
stir fried.

582
00:34:56,983 --> 00:34:58,746
There's pineapple shrimp

583
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:01,685
and lemon shrimp,
coconut shrimp,

584
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:02,880
pepper shrimp,

585
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:05,389
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

586
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,050
shrimp salad,

587
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:08,889
shrimp in potatoes,

588
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,394
shrimp burger,

589
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:12,226
shrimp sandwich.

590
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,560
That... Thas about it.

591
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:23,970
Nighttime in the army
is a lonely time.

592
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,477
We'd lay there in our bunks,

593
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:28,980
and I'd miss my mama,

594
00:35:29,048 --> 00:35:31,642
and I'd missJenny.

595
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,988
Hey, Gump.

596
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,650
Get a load of the tits on her.

597
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:53,838
Turns out...

598
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:55,999
Jenny had gotten
into some trouble

599
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:59,340
over some photos of her
in her college sweater.

600
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,607
And she was
thrown out of school.

601
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:04,844
# My baby does the hanky panky #

602
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:07,351
But that wasn't a bad thing,

603
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,854
'cause a man who owns a theater

604
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:11,355
in Memphis, Tennessee,

605
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:13,016
saw those photos

606
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:16,858
and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

607
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,022
The first chance I got,

608
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:21,362
I took the bus up to Memphis

609
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,698
to see her perform in that show.

610
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:25,202
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

611
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:26,704
Give her a big hand.

612
00:36:26,772 --> 00:36:29,707
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

613
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:31,538
direct from Hollywood,
California,

614
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:33,374
our very own beatnik beauty.

615
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:35,710
Les give a big round of applause

616
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:37,544
to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.

617
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:52,560
# How many roads
must a man walk down #

618
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:58,002
# Before you can
call him a man? #

619
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:04,270
#Yes, and how many seas
must the white dove sail #

620
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:06,277
Her dream had come true.

621
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:08,279
# Before she sleeps
in the sand? #

622
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:10,178
She was a folksinger.

623
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:13,343
#Yes, and how many times #

624
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:16,479
# Must the cannonballs fly #

625
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:21,152
# Before they're
forever banned? #

626
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:22,558
Shake it up now.

627
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:24,061
Somebody get her a harmonica.

628
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,859
#The answer, my friend #

629
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,695
# Is blowin' in the wind ##

630
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,200
This ain't Captain Kangaroo.

631
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:32,032
Hey, honey, I got
something here for you.

632
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:34,163
Hey! God damn it!

633
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,504
Hey, you stupid jerk!

634
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:38,339
I'm singing a song here.

635
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:42,847
Polly, get out here!

636
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:45,349
Shut up yourself!

637
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:46,885
Just shut up!

638
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:52,390
Forrest! What are you
doing here?

639
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,789
What are you doing?

640
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:54,791
- Hey!
- Aw!

641
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,623
What are you doing, Forrest?

642
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,721
Let me down!

643
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,323
- Oh! Ooh!
- Ooh!

644
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,802
Ha ha ha!

645
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:05,369
You can't keep
doing this, Forrest.

646
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,871
You can't keep
trying to rescue me.

647
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,737
They was trying to grab you.

648
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,141
A lot of people try to grab me.

649
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:16,204
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

650
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:19,809
I can't help it.
I love you.

651
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:22,149
Forrest...

652
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,189
You don't know what love is.

653
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,865
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

654
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:38,703
We prayed for God
to turn me into a bird

655
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,705
so I could fly far away.

656
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:43,533
Yes, I do.

657
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:48,946
You think I could
fly off this bridge?

658
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:59,214
What do you mean, Jenny?

659
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:03,656
Nothing.

660
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:08,996
I got to get out of here.

661
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,329
Wait, Jenny.

662
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:14,838
Forrest, you stay
away from me, O. K?

663
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:16,841
You stay away from me, please.

664
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:18,342
Can I have a ride?

665
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,672
Where are you going?

666
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:20,837
I don't care.

667
00:39:20,913 --> 00:39:22,141
Get in the truck.

668
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:24,409
So bye-bye, Jenny.

669
00:39:25,818 --> 00:39:28,685
They sending me to Vietnam.

670
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:33,222
Ls this whole other country.

671
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:37,557
Just hang on a minute.

672
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:42,066
Listen, you promise me
something, O. K?

673
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:44,068
Just if you're
ever in trouble,

674
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:45,398
don't be brave.

675
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:48,406
You just run, O. K?
Just run away.

676
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:49,839
O.K.

677
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,343
Jenny.

678
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:01,011
I'll write you all the time.

679
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,430
Andjust like that,
she was gone.

680
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,193
Andjust like that,
she was gone.

681
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:30,881
You come back safe to me.

682
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,382
Do you hear?

683
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,562
# Some folks are born #

684
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:55,902
# Made to wave the flag #

685
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:59,239
# Ooh, they're red,
white, and blue #

686
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:02,838
#And when the band plays
"Hail To The Chief" #

687
00:41:02,914 --> 00:41:06,509
# Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you #

688
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:08,348
# It ain't me #

689
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,354
# It ain't me #

690
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:13,516
# I ain't no senator's son #

691
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:15,355
# It ain't me ##

692
00:41:15,427 --> 00:41:16,860
Now they told us

693
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:19,863
that Vietnam was going
to be very different

694
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:21,956
from the United States
of America.

695
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:26,129
Except for all
the beer cans and barbecues,

696
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:27,967
it was.

697
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:40,810
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

698
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:43,821
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

699
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:45,823
After we win this war

700
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:47,518
and we take over everything,

701
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:49,856
we can get American
shrimpers out here

702
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:51,190
and shrimp these waters.

703
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:53,197
Just shrimp all the time, man.

704
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:58,198
You must be my FNGs.

705
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,362
Morning, sir.

706
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,961
Oh, get your hands down.

707
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,472
Do not salute me.

708
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,975
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

709
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:07,136
who'd love
to grease an officer.

710
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:10,477
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

711
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:13,308
Whas wrong with your lip?

712
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:16,650
I was born with big gums, sir.

713
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:18,814
Well, you better tuck that in.

714
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,324
Gonna get that caught
on a trip wire.

715
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:24,995
Where are you boys
from in the world?

716
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,155
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

717
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,366
You twins?

718
00:42:30,602 --> 00:42:33,196
No. We are not relations, sir.

719
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:36,535
Look,

720
00:42:36,608 --> 00:42:37,939
is pretty basic here.

721
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,272
You stick with me

722
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:41,778
and learn from the guys

723
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:43,780
who've been in country a while,

724
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:45,110
you'll be all right.

725
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:47,447
There is one item of G.I. Gear

726
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,613
that can be the difference
between life and death...

727
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:51,747
Socks.

728
00:42:51,823 --> 00:42:53,848
Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.

729
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,756
Try and keep your feet dry.

730
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:58,261
When we're out humpin',
change your socks

731
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,524
whenever we stop.

732
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:01,862
The Mekong will eat
a gruns feet

733
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:03,366
right off his legs.

734
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:04,868
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

735
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:07,370
where's that sling rope
I said to order?

736
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,872
I put in the requisitions.

737
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,204
Well, you call
those sons of bitches...

738
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:13,369
Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.

739
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:16,380
I felt real lucky
he was my lieutenant.

740
00:43:16,448 --> 00:43:20,111
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

741
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,710
Somebody in his family
had fought

742
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:24,254
and died

743
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:25,914
in every...

744
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,117
single...

745
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:29,285
American war.

746
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:31,295
God damn it, kick some ass.

747
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:32,625
Get on it!

748
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,130
I guess you could say

749
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:36,633
he had a lot to live up to.

750
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,636
So, you boys
from Arkansas, huh?

751
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:40,796
Well,

752
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:42,635
I been through there.

753
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:45,471
Little Rock's a fine town.

754
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:47,306
Now, shake down your gear.

755
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:48,641
See the platoon sergeant.

756
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:51,477
Draw what you need
for the field.

757
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:52,982
If you boys are hungry,

758
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:55,815
we got steaks burning
right over here.

759
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:58,651
Two standing orders
in this platoon...

760
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:01,248
1... take care of your feet,

761
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:04,921
2... try not to do
anything stupid,

762
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:06,588
like getting
yourself killed.

763
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:15,362
I sure hope I don't
let him down.

764
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:29,486
I got to see
a lot of the countryside.

765
00:44:29,554 --> 00:44:31,954
We would take
these real long walks.

766
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:35,959
#There must be
some kind of way #

767
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:38,120
# Out of here #

768
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:40,289
# Said the joker
to the thief #

769
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:41,798
And we were always lookin'

770
00:44:41,866 --> 00:44:43,800
for this guy named Charlie.

771
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:45,460
#There's too much confusion #

772
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:49,635
# I can't get no relief ##

773
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,302
Hold it up!

774
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:54,811
Hold up, boys!

775
00:44:56,381 --> 00:44:59,407
It wasn't always fun.

776
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:02,749
Lieutenant Dan was always
getting these funny feelings

777
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,915
about a rock or a trail
or the road,

778
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,925
so he'd tell us
to get down, shut up.

779
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:10,085
Get down!

780
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:11,253
Shut up!

781
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,592
So we did.

782
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:33,380
Now I don't know
much about anything,

783
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,386
but I think some of
America's best young men

784
00:45:36,454 --> 00:45:37,716
served in this war.

785
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:40,053
There was Dallas from Phoenix.

786
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:44,223
Cleveland...
he was from Detroit.

787
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:45,523
Hey, Tex.

788
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:47,087
Hey, Tex.

789
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:48,757
What the hell's going on?

790
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,028
And Tex was...

791
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:53,696
Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from...

792
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:55,296
Ah, nothing.

793
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,235
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

794
00:46:01,312 --> 00:46:04,213
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river.

795
00:46:04,282 --> 00:46:05,874
Move out.

796
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,384
1, 2! Hup!

797
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,221
Step it up!

798
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:12,620
Look alive out there.

799
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,123
The good thing about Vietnam

800
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:16,456
is there was always
someplace to go.

801
00:46:16,528 --> 00:46:17,790
Fire in the hole!

802
00:46:21,366 --> 00:46:23,960
Gump, check out that hole.

803
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:26,970
And there was always
something to do.

804
00:46:27,038 --> 00:46:28,130
Mount 'em up!

805
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:30,003
Spread out!
Cover his back!

806
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:37,673
One day it started raining,

807
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:41,082
and it didn't quit for four months.

808
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:44,588
We've been through
every kind of rain there is...

809
00:46:44,656 --> 00:46:47,284
little bitty stinging rain

810
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,260
and big old fat rain,

811
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:54,130
rain that flew in sideways,

812
00:46:54,263 --> 00:46:55,924
and sometimes rain even seemed

813
00:46:55,998 --> 00:46:59,331
to come straight up
from underneath.

814
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:02,928
Shoot, it even rained at night.

815
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:04,768
Hey, Forrest.

816
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,932
Hey, Bubba.

817
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:08,272
I'm going to lean up against you.

818
00:47:08,344 --> 00:47:09,777
You lean up against me.

819
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:12,109
This way we don't have to sleep

820
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:14,115
with our heads in the mud.

821
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:16,777
You know why we're
a good partnership, Forrest?

822
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:20,117
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

823
00:47:20,189 --> 00:47:21,952
like brothers and stuff.

824
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:25,451
Hey, Forrest,

825
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:27,621
something I been thinking about.

826
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:30,631
I got a very important
question to ask you.

827
00:47:32,368 --> 00:47:34,302
How would you like to go

828
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,304
into the shrimping
business with me?

829
00:47:37,873 --> 00:47:39,135
O.K.

830
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,971
Man, I tell you what.

831
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:43,307
I got it all figured out, too.

832
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:44,812
So many pounds of shrimp

833
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,313
will pay off the boat.

834
00:47:46,382 --> 00:47:47,815
So many pounds for gas.

835
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:49,817
We'll live right on the boat.

836
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:52,149
We ain't got to pay no rent.

837
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:54,155
We can just work it together,

838
00:47:54,223 --> 00:47:56,157
split everything right
down the middle.

839
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:58,318
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

840
00:47:58,394 --> 00:48:01,420
Hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

841
00:48:02,998 --> 00:48:05,592
Thas a fine idea.

842
00:48:05,668 --> 00:48:08,432
Bubba did have a fine idea.

843
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,102
I even wroteJenny

844
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:15,109
and told her all about it.

845
00:48:15,177 --> 00:48:16,769
I sent her letters...

846
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:18,938
Not every day, but almost.

847
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:21,278
I told her what I was doing

848
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,784
and asked her what she was doing

849
00:48:23,852 --> 00:48:27,088
and told her how
I thought about her always.

850
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:30,390
And how I was looking forward

851
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,392
to getting a letter from her

852
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,224
just as soon
as she had the time.

853
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:38,231
I'd always let her know
that I was O.K.

854
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:45,728
Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump."

855
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:58,413
#There's somethin'
happenin' here #

856
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:03,348
This one day, we was out
walking like always,

857
00:49:03,424 --> 00:49:07,190
and then, just like that,

858
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:09,195
somebody turned off the rain,

859
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:10,855
and the sun come out.

860
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:13,695
# I got to beware ##

861
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:15,860
Ambush!

862
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:17,870
Take cover!

863
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:29,116
Get that pig up here,
god damn it!

864
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:31,376
Forrest! You okay?

865
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:36,888
Strong-arm, Strong-arm!

866
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:39,755
Hey! We got a man down!

867
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:43,284
Strong-arm,
this is Leg Lima 6! Over!

868
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,797
Roger, Strong-arm!
Be advised we have incoming

869
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:48,266
from the treeline at point blue

870
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:50,667
plus two!
A.K. S and rockets!

871
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,999
We're getting it hard!

872
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,630
Misfire! Misfire!

873
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,505
God damn it!

874
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:02,014
Get that pig unfucked
and on the treeline!

875
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,444
They got us,
and it hurt.

876
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,012
We're going to move
back to the blue line.

877
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,991
Pull back! Pull back!

878
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:15,050
Forrest! Run, Forrest!

879
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:16,857
Pull back!

880
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,125
Run! Run, man!

881
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,291
Run!

882
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:21,629
Pull back, Gump!

883
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:26,366
Run, God damn it! Run!

884
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,326
I ran and ran
just likeJenny told me to.

885
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:01,267
I ran so far so fast

886
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:03,775
that pretty soon
I was all by myself,

887
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:05,435
which was a bad thing.

888
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:06,604
Bubba.

889
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:11,275
Bubba was my best good friend.

890
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:13,785
I had to make sure he was O.K.

891
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,296
Where the hell are you?

892
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:27,458
Bubba!

893
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:30,469
And on my way
back to find Bubba,

894
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:33,301
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

895
00:51:33,373 --> 00:51:34,362
Tex.

896
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:37,901
O.K.

897
00:51:37,978 --> 00:51:40,412
I couldn't let him
lay there all alone,

898
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,913
scared the way he was,

899
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:43,745
so I grabbed him up

900
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:45,546
and run him out of there.

901
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:03,497
Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

902
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,003
somebody else was saying,

903
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:08,006
"Help me, Forrest, help me!"

904
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:16,742
O.K. Here. Here.

905
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:22,021
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be O.K.

906
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:28,884
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

907
00:52:28,962 --> 00:52:30,395
I know my position

908
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,363
is danger close!

909
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:34,866
We got Charlie
all over this area.

910
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:37,869
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

911
00:52:37,937 --> 00:52:40,371
Lieutenant Dan,
Coleman's dead!

912
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,873
I know he's dead!

913
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:44,876
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

914
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:46,377
God damn it!

915
00:52:46,446 --> 00:52:48,380
What are you doing?

916
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:49,881
You leave me here!

917
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,883
Get away.
Just leave me here!

918
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:53,384
Get out!

919
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:57,389
Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!

920
00:52:57,457 --> 00:52:59,823
Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.

921
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:02,862
Be advised your fast movers
are inbound. Over.

922
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,330
Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

923
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:09,163
Aah! Something bit me!

924
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:16,000
Aah! Aah!

925
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:18,010
You son of a bitch!

926
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:19,409
Aah!

927
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:22,505
I can't leave the platoon.

928
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:25,517
I told you
to leave me there, Gump.

929
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:27,553
Forget about me.
Get yourself out!

930
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,850
Did you hear what I said?

931
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:32,357
Gump, damn it, put me down.

932
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:34,950
Get your ass out of here.

933
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,058
I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

934
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,068
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

935
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,569
To get Bubba.

936
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:47,572
I got an air strike
inbound right now.

937
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,131
They're going to nape
the whole area.

938
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,677
Stay here!
Thas an order.

939
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:53,178
I gotta find Bubba!

00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:10,090
Forrest.

941
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:18,735
Bubba.

942
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:20,636
I'm O.K., Forrest.

943
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:22,231
I'm O.K.

944
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,675
O-Oh, Bubba, no.

945
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:34,549
I'll be all right.

00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:39,281
[Voices Speaking In Vietnamese]

947
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:44,021
Come on.

948
00:54:44,097 --> 00:54:45,826
Come on. Come on.

949
00:54:49,803 --> 00:54:52,499
Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.

950
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:55,370
[Airplanes Approach]

951
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:57,376
I'm O.K. I'm fine.

952
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,906
[Lieutenant Dan]
Top smoke. Get it up there.

953
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:39,850
If I'd have known
this was going to be

954
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,854
the last time
me and Bubba was gonna talk,

955
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,857
I'd of thought of
something better to say.

956
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:46,983
Hey, Bubba.

957
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,322
Hey, Forrest.

958
00:55:50,763 --> 00:55:52,196
Forrest...

959
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,359
Why did this happen?

960
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,370
You got shot.

961
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,807
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

962
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:06,437
I want to go home.

963
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:09,311
Bubba was my best good friend.

964
00:56:09,382 --> 00:56:11,316
And even I know

965
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:14,820
that ain't something you can
findjust around the corner.

966
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:18,324
Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,

967
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:22,691
but instead, he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

968
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:30,600
Thas all I have
to say about that.

969
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:35,000
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

970
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,343
A bullet?

971
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:41,141
That jumped up and bit you.

972
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:44,147
Oh. Yes, sir.

973
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:46,845
Bit me directly
in the but-tocks.

974
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,357
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

975
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:53,358
the army must keep that money,

976
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:57,362
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

977
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,233
The only good thing about being
wounded in the but-tocks

978
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:03,129
is the ice cream.

979
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:06,102
They gave me all
the ice cream I could eat.

980
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:07,604
And guess what?

981
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:11,574
A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.

982
00:57:12,877 --> 00:57:15,937
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

983
00:57:17,816 --> 00:57:20,546

00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:31,187
Gump, how can you
watch that stupid shit?

998
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:32,688
Turn it off.

999
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:35,190
You are tuned
to the American forces

1000
00:58:35,259 --> 00:58:36,692
Vietnam network.

1001
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,318
This is channel 6, Saigon.

1002
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:42,425
Good catch, Gump.

1003
00:58:44,268 --> 00:58:46,168
You know how to play this?

1004
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:50,239
Come on. Let me show you.

1005
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,209
Now, the secret to this game is

1006
00:58:54,278 --> 00:58:56,212
no matter what happens,

1007
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,714
never, ever...

1008
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:00,875
take your eye off the ball.

1009
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:05,049
All right.

1010
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:09,725
For some reason,

1011
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:12,227
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

1012
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:13,456
See?

1013
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,725
Any idiot can play.

1014
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:19,235
So I started playing it
all the time.

1015
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:20,930
I played Ping-Pong

1016
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:24,600
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

1017
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,383
The hospital's people

1018
00:59:34,451 --> 00:59:38,387
said it made me look
like a duck in water...

1019
00:59:38,455 --> 00:59:39,888
Whatever that means.

1020
00:59:39,957 --> 00:59:43,188
Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.

1021
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:50,398
I played Ping-Pong so much,

1022
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:53,299
I even played it in my sleep.

1023
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:01,341
Now...

1024
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,843
you listen to me.

1025
01:00:02,912 --> 01:00:04,846
We all have a destiny.

1026
01:00:04,914 --> 01:00:08,350
Nothing just happens.
Ls all part of a plan!

1027
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:11,409
I should have died
out there with my men,

1028
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:15,480
but now... I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

1029
01:00:15,558 --> 01:00:17,253
a legless freak!

1030
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,419
Look. Look! Look at me!

1031
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:20,928
You see that?

1032
01:00:20,997 --> 01:00:22,862
Do you know what is like

1033
01:00:22,932 --> 01:00:25,924
not to be able to use your legs?

1034
01:00:27,937 --> 01:00:29,996
Y-Y-Yes, sir, I do.

1035
01:00:33,442 --> 01:00:36,206
Did you hear what I said?

1036
01:00:36,279 --> 01:00:38,144
You cheated me!

1037
01:00:38,214 --> 01:00:39,647
I had a destiny.

1038
01:00:39,715 --> 01:00:42,240
I was supposed
to die in the field

1039
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:43,512
with honor!

1040
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:45,315
That was my destiny,

1041
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:48,357
and you...
cheated me out of it!

1042
01:00:56,899 --> 01:00:59,265
You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

1043
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:04,831
This wasn't supposed
to happen...

1044
01:01:04,907 --> 01:01:06,704
Not to me.

1045
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:09,768
I had a destiny.

1046
01:01:11,747 --> 01:01:13,339
I was...

1047
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:15,179

01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:16,980

1049
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:23,792

1050
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,521
Lieutenant Dan.

1051
01:01:47,884 --> 01:01:49,317
Look at me.

1052
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:53,321
What am I going to do now?

1053
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:58,690
What am I going to do now?

1054
01:02:08,404 --> 01:02:10,031
PFC Gump?

1055
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:13,637
Yes, sir!

1056
01:02:13,709 --> 01:02:15,108
As you were.

1057
01:02:16,245 --> 01:02:17,337
Son,

1058
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:19,916
you been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

1059
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:22,279
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?

1060
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:25,081
They want to give me a med...

1061
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,794
Ma'am.

1062
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:35,296
What did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

1063
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:37,229
They sent him home.

1064
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:47,240
Two weeks later,
I left Vietnam.

1065
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,800
The ceremony was kicked off

1066
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:50,971
with a candid speech
by the president

1067
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:55,484
regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.

1068
01:02:55,551 --> 01:02:59,487
Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to
men from each of the armed services.

1069
01:02:59,555 --> 01:03:01,455
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

1070
01:03:03,392 --> 01:03:05,326
I understand you were wounded.

1071
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:07,328
Where were you hit?

1072
01:03:07,396 --> 01:03:08,988
In the but-tocks, sir.

1073
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:10,999
Well, that must be a sight.

1074
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:13,831
I'd kinda like to see that.

1075
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:17,669
#And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson #

1076
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,800
#Jesus loves you more
than you will know #

1077
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:24,377
# Whoa, whoa, whoa #

1078
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:27,780
# God bless you, please,

1079
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:29,511
God damn, son!

1080
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:34,790
After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,

1081
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:38,793
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

1082
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:40,795
Hilary! I got the vets.

1083
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:43,661
What do you want
to do with them?

1084
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:46,293
Ls a good thing
Mama was resting,

1085
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:49,304
'cause the streets
was awful crowded with people

1086
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:52,307
lookin'at all the statues
and monuments,

1087
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,310
and some of them people
were loud and pushy.

1088
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:57,209
O.K., follow me!

1089
01:03:57,279 --> 01:04:00,578
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

1090
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:08,448
Come on.

1091
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:09,513
Go!

1092
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:21,768
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this.

1093
01:04:21,837 --> 01:04:23,202
Good.

1094
01:04:23,272 --> 01:04:24,762
O.K.

1095
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,775
There was this man
giving a little talk.

1096
01:04:27,843 --> 01:04:29,276
And for some reason,

1097
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:32,280
he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.

1098
01:04:33,849 --> 01:04:37,785
And he liked to say
the "F"word... a lot.

1099
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:40,117
"F"this and "F"that.

1100
01:04:40,189 --> 01:04:43,158
And every time
he said the "F"word,

1101
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:46,285
people, for some reason,
well, they cheered.

1103
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:50,525
Yeah! Yeah!

Come on, man.
Come up here, man.

Come on. Come on.

Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!

Go on. Les get up there.

1108
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:17,850
Tell us a little bit
about the war, man.

1109
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:19,827
The war in Vietnam?

1110
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:22,659
The war in Viet-

1111
01:05:22,731 --> 01:05:24,289
fucking-nam!

1112
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:49,790
Well...

1113
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:52,794
There was only one thing
I could say

1114
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:54,295
about the war in Vietnam.

1115
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:57,298
There's only one thing
I can say about...

1116
01:05:57,366 --> 01:05:58,856
the war in Vietnam.

1117
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:04,236

Hey!

1142
01:07:39,835 --> 01:07:43,669
It was the happiest
moment of my life.

1143
01:07:45,374 --> 01:07:49,276
Jenny and me werejust like
peas and carrots again.

1144
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:50,778
She showed me around

1145
01:07:50,846 --> 01:07:53,781
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

1146
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:55,282
Shut that blind, man!

1147
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:58,286
And get your white ass
away from that window.

1148
01:07:58,354 --> 01:07:59,586
Don't you know we in a war here?

1149
01:07:59,586 --> 01:08:00,644
Don't you know we in a war here?

01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,620
He's cool.
He's one of us.

1151
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:04,623
Let me tell you about us.

1152
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:07,626
Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders

1153
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:10,162
from the racial
onslaught of the pig

1154
01:08:10,229 --> 01:08:13,062
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

1155
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:16,329
rape our women, and destroy
our black communities.

1156
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:17,801
Who's the baby killer?

1157
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,805
This is my good friend
I told you about.

1158
01:08:20,873 --> 01:08:23,808
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

1159
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:26,310
Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,

1160
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:29,314
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

1161
01:08:29,382 --> 01:08:32,317
We are here to offer
protection and help

1162
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:34,819
for all those
who need our help,

1163
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:36,320
because we,
the Black Panthers,

1164
01:08:36,389 --> 01:08:38,323
are against the war in Vietnam.

1165
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:39,824
We are against any war

1166
01:08:39,892 --> 01:08:42,827
where black soldiers
are sent to the front line

1167
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:45,830
to die for a country
that hates them.

1168
01:08:45,898 --> 01:08:49,834
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

1169
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:53,429
and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities.

1170
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:56,407
We are against
these racist and imperial acts...

1171
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:01,175
#And I gave her the gun #

1172
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:02,839
# I shot her ##

1173
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:06,407
Forrest!

1174
01:09:06,486 --> 01:09:07,680
Stop it!

1175
01:09:07,754 --> 01:09:09,244
Stop it!

1176
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:11,585
Forrest!

1177
01:09:11,658 --> 01:09:14,058
Stop it! Stop it!

1178
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:25,303
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

1179
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:30,070
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

1180
01:09:30,143 --> 01:09:32,703
He should not be
hitting you, Jenny.

1181
01:09:37,884 --> 01:09:39,715
Come on, Forrest.

1182
01:09:44,824 --> 01:09:49,659
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

1183
01:09:51,363 --> 01:09:54,264
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

1184
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,801
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

1185
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:00,671
I know you wouldn't,
Forrest.

1186
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:05,437
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

1187
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:18,082
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

1188
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,790
You look handsome in it.

1189
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,589
You do.

1190
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:28,298
You know what?

1191
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:29,459
What?

1192
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:36,204
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

1193
01:10:37,709 --> 01:10:39,301
Me, too, Forrest.

1194
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:42,836
We walked around
all night, Jenny and me,

1195
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:44,848
just talkin'.

1196
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:49,683
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done

1197
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:53,623
and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind

1198
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:57,296
and learn how
to live in harmony...

1199
01:10:57,429 --> 01:10:59,329
which must be
out west somewhere,

1200
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:02,333
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

1201
01:11:02,401 --> 01:11:04,335
# Love one another right now ##

1202
01:11:04,403 --> 01:11:05,335
Hey.

1203
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:08,703
Anybody want to go
to San Francisco?

1204
01:11:08,774 --> 01:11:10,241
I'll go.

1205
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:11,640
Far out!

1206
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,144
It was a very special night

1207
01:11:14,212 --> 01:11:15,907
for the two of us.

1208
01:11:17,616 --> 01:11:19,550
I didn't want it to end.

1209
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,584
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

1210
01:11:23,855 --> 01:11:25,379
I have to, Forrest.

1211
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:27,790
Jenny?

1212
01:11:29,628 --> 01:11:32,290
Things got
a little out of hand.

1213
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:33,956
Ls just this war

1214
01:11:34,032 --> 01:11:36,796
and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

1215
01:11:38,203 --> 01:11:41,070
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

1216
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,775
Know what I think?

1217
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:49,212
I think...

1218
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:51,306
you should go home to Greenbow,

1219
01:11:51,383 --> 01:11:53,374
Alabama!

1220
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:04,760
Forrest,

1221
01:12:05,897 --> 01:12:08,525
we have very
different lives, you know.

1222
01:12:17,409 --> 01:12:19,343
I want you...

1223
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:21,504
to have this.

1224
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,341
Forrest, I can't keep this.

1225
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:30,787
I got it...

1226
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,189
just by doing
what you told me to do.

1227
01:12:35,861 --> 01:12:39,126
Why are you so good to me?

1228
01:12:39,197 --> 01:12:41,028
You're my girl.

1229
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:44,863
I'll always be your girl.

1230
01:13:07,793 --> 01:13:12,753
#To everything,
turn, turn, turn #

1231
01:13:12,831 --> 01:13:17,325
#There is a season,
turn, turn, turn #

1232
01:13:17,402 --> 01:13:21,168
#And a time to every purpose #

1233
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:23,264
# Under heaven ##

1234
01:13:24,443 --> 01:13:27,276
Andjust like that,

1235
01:13:27,345 --> 01:13:31,304
she was gone
out of my life again.

1236
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:34,349
Thas one small step for man,

1237
01:13:36,354 --> 01:13:39,152
one giant leap for mankind.

1238
01:13:43,862 --> 01:13:46,797
I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,

1239
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:48,298
but instead they decided

1240
01:13:48,366 --> 01:13:51,301
the best way for me
to fight the Communists

1241
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:52,802
was to play Ping-Pong,

1242
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:54,805
so I was in the Special Services,

1243
01:13:54,873 --> 01:13:56,465
traveling around the country,

1244
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:59,169
cheering up wounded veterans
and showing 'em

1245
01:13:59,244 --> 01:14:00,802
how to play Ping-Pong.

1246
01:14:00,879 --> 01:14:03,848
I was so good
that some years later,

1247
01:14:03,915 --> 01:14:05,815
the army decided I should be

1248
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:08,045
on the all-American Ping-Pong team.

1249
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:11,384
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

1250
01:14:11,456 --> 01:14:13,856
in a million years or something.

1251
01:14:13,925 --> 01:14:16,860
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

1252
01:14:16,928 --> 01:14:19,624
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

1253
01:14:19,698 --> 01:14:22,565
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

1254
01:14:22,634 --> 01:14:24,534
famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.

1255
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:26,703
Here he is, Forrest Gump.

1256
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:28,136
Right here.

1257
01:14:33,979 --> 01:14:36,948
Gump, have a seat.

1258
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:39,779
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

1259
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:41,785
Welcome home.

1260
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:43,787
Can you tell us, um,

1261
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:45,982
what was China like?

1262
01:14:49,227 --> 01:14:51,286
In the land of China...

1263
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:53,297
people hardly got nothin'at all.

1264
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:55,526
No possessions?

1265
01:14:58,003 --> 01:15:02,804
And in China,
they never go to church.

1266
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:04,307
No religion, too?

1267
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:06,310
Oh.

1268
01:15:06,378 --> 01:15:07,970
Hard to imagine.

1269
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:11,311
Well, is easy if you try, Dick.

1270
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:12,816
Some years later,

1271
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:14,818
that nice young man from England

1272
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:17,855
was on his way home
to see his little boy

1273
01:15:17,923 --> 01:15:19,823
and was signing some autographs.

1274
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:21,756
For no particular reason at all,

1275
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:24,294
somebody shot him.

1276
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:28,765
They gave you...

1277
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,824
the congressional Medal of Honor.

1278
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:34,034
Now, thas Lieutenant Dan.

1279
01:15:36,975 --> 01:15:38,567
Lieutenant Dan!

1280
01:15:38,643 --> 01:15:40,508
They gave you...

1281
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:43,605
the congressional
Medal of Honor.

1282
01:15:44,849 --> 01:15:46,783
Yes, sir.
They surely did.

1283
01:15:46,851 --> 01:15:48,682
They gave you,

1284
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,277
an imbecile,

1285
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:52,289
a moron who goes on television

1286
01:15:52,357 --> 01:15:54,791
and makes a fool out of himself

1287
01:15:54,859 --> 01:15:57,828
in front of
the whole damn country,

1288
01:15:57,896 --> 01:16:00,228
the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

1289
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:02,598
Yes, sir.

1290
01:16:04,869 --> 01:16:08,100
Well... that...
thas just perfect!

1291
01:16:08,173 --> 01:16:11,870
Yeah, well, I just got
one thing to say to that...

1292
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:14,309
Goddamn bless America.

1293
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,845
Hey, hey!

1294
01:16:16,915 --> 01:16:17,904
Whoa...

1295
01:16:17,983 --> 01:16:20,645
Oh, God, whoa!

1296
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,483
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!

1297
01:16:23,555 --> 01:16:25,182
Lieutenant Dan!

1298
01:16:25,256 --> 01:16:28,248
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel

1299
01:16:28,326 --> 01:16:31,261
and because he didn't
have no legs,

1300
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:34,264
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

1301
01:16:36,368 --> 01:16:38,268
Make a right. Take a right!

1302
01:16:41,339 --> 01:16:42,271
Hey!

1303
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,534
Ah, ah!

1304
01:16:43,608 --> 01:16:47,271
What do you do here
in New York, Lieutenant Dan?

1305
01:16:47,345 --> 01:16:49,779
I'm living off
the government tit.

1306
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,140
[Honk]

1307
01:16:53,218 --> 01:16:55,277
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?

1308
01:16:55,353 --> 01:16:56,786
I'm walking here!

1309
01:16:56,855 --> 01:16:58,288
Ah, get out!

1310
01:16:58,356 --> 01:17:00,017
Come on. Go, go, go!

1311
01:17:00,225 --> 01:17:02,352
[Singing Silent Night]

1312
01:17:05,697 --> 01:17:07,790
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan

1313
01:17:07,866 --> 01:17:10,198
and celebrated the holidays.

1314
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:16,868
You have a great year,
and hurry home.

1315
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:18,636
God bless you.

1316
01:17:20,879 --> 01:17:24,007
Have you found
Jesus yet, Gump?

1317
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,318
I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for Him, sir.

1318
01:17:35,326 --> 01:17:38,784
Thas all these cripples
down at the V. A...

1319
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:42,264
Thas all they ever
talk about.

1320
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:46,565
Jesus this
and Jesus that. Ha.

1321
01:17:46,638 --> 01:17:50,130
Have I... found Jesus?

1322
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:53,644
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

1323
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:56,272
He said God is listening,

1324
01:17:56,347 --> 01:17:59,282
but I have to help myself.

1325
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:02,285
Now, if I accept Jesus
into my heart,

1326
01:18:02,353 --> 01:18:06,790
I'll get to walk beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1327
01:18:06,858 --> 01:18:09,088
Did you hear what I said?

1328
01:18:10,361 --> 01:18:12,158
Walk...

1329
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,790
beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1330
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:17,300
Well... kiss my crippled ass.

1331
01:18:17,368 --> 01:18:19,302
God is listening?

1332
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,429
What a crock of shit.

1333
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,866
I'm going to heaven,
Lieutenant Dan.

1334
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,312
Oh?

1335
01:18:34,886 --> 01:18:36,114
Well...

1336
01:18:38,723 --> 01:18:40,247
before you go...
why don't you

1337
01:18:40,325 --> 01:18:42,760
get your ass
down to the corner

1338
01:18:42,893 --> 01:18:44,554
and get us more Ripple?

1339
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:45,652
Yes, sir.

1340
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:47,162
We're at approximately

1341
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:50,325
45th Street in New York City
at One Astor Plaza.

1342
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,334
This is the site of the old...

1343
01:18:52,402 --> 01:18:54,836
What the hell is
in Bayou La Batre?

1344
01:18:54,905 --> 01:18:56,338
Shrimping boats.

1345
01:18:56,406 --> 01:18:59,842
Shrimping boats? Who gives
a shit about shrimping boats?

1346
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,844
I got to buy me one

1347
01:19:01,912 --> 01:19:03,846
soon as I have some money.

1348
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:05,347
I promised Bubba in Vietnam

1349
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:08,851
that as soon as the war
was over, we'd be partners.

1350
01:19:08,919 --> 01:19:12,355
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

1351
01:19:12,422 --> 01:19:15,357
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

1352
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:17,359
A shrimp boat captain.

1353
01:19:17,427 --> 01:19:20,521
Yes, sir. A promise
is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1354
01:19:22,866 --> 01:19:24,800
Now hear this!

1355
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:26,301
Private Gump here

1356
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,804
is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

1357
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:30,806
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.

1358
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:33,809
The day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1359
01:19:33,877 --> 01:19:36,812
I will come and be
your first mate.

1360
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,313
Ha ha ha!

1361
01:19:38,382 --> 01:19:41,317
If you're ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1362
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:43,319
thas the day
I'm an astronaut!

1363
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:45,321
Danny, what are you
complaining about?

1364
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:46,822
Danny, how you doing, huh?

1365
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,323
Mr. Hot Wheels!

1366
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:49,825
Who's your friend?

1367
01:19:49,893 --> 01:19:52,361
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1368
01:19:52,429 --> 01:19:54,863
This is cunning Carla

1369
01:19:54,932 --> 01:19:56,866
and long-limbs Lenore.

1370
01:19:56,934 --> 01:19:58,834
So where you been,
babycakes, huh?

1371
01:19:58,902 --> 01:20:00,836
Haven't seen you
around lately.

1372
01:20:00,904 --> 01:20:03,338
You should have been here
for Christmas,

1373
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:05,341
'cause Tommy bought a free round

1374
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:07,343
and gave everybody
a turkey sandwich.

1375
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:09,345
Well, well,
I had, uh... company.

1376
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:11,347
Hey! Hey, we was just there!

1377
01:20:11,415 --> 01:20:13,349
Thas like Times Square.

1378
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,851
Don't you just love New Year's?

1379
01:20:15,919 --> 01:20:18,353
You can start all over.

1380
01:20:18,422 --> 01:20:20,356
Everybody gets a second chance.

1381
01:20:20,424 --> 01:20:21,789
Ls funny...

1382
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,794
but in the middle
of all that fun,

1383
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,693
I began to think about Jenny,

1384
01:20:26,763 --> 01:20:30,199
wondering how she was
spending her New Year's night

1385
01:20:30,267 --> 01:20:32,929
out in California.

1386
01:20:33,003 --> 01:20:36,302
# Don't you love her ways? #

1387
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:39,467
#Tell me what you say #

1388
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:42,637
# Don't you love her madly? #

1389
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:45,807
# Want to meet her daddy? #

1390
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,943
# Don't you love her face? #

1391
01:20:49,019 --> 01:20:53,820
# Don't you love her
as she's walkin' out the door? ##

1392
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,324
9... 8...

1393
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,326
7... 6...

01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,328
5... 4...

1395
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,863
3... 2...

1396
01:21:00,931 --> 01:21:01,863
1!

1397
01:21:01,932 --> 01:21:04,127

Happy new year!

Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!

# Should auld acquaintance

# In days of auld lang syne ##

# Les work together ##

1411
01:21:58,388 --> 01:22:00,822
Oh! What are you,
stupid or something?

1412
01:22:00,891 --> 01:22:02,324
Whas your problem?

1413
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:03,825
Whas his problem?

1414
01:22:03,894 --> 01:22:06,829
Did you lose your packet
in the war or something?

1415
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:08,831
Is your friend
stupid or something?

1416
01:22:08,899 --> 01:22:10,332
What did you say?

1417
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,834
I said is your friend
stupid or something?

1418
01:22:12,903 --> 01:22:14,165
Don't call him stupid!

1419
01:22:14,237 --> 01:22:15,670
Hey, don't push her!

1420
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:16,763
You shut up!

1421
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,740
Don't you ever call him stupid!

1422
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,141
Come on, baby,
why you being so upset, huh?

1423
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:22,371
Get your goddamned clothes

1424
01:22:22,446 --> 01:22:24,880
and get the hell out of here!

1425
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:26,779
You should be in a sideshow.

1426
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,976
You're so pathetic!

1427
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:29,541
Get out of here!

1428
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:31,052
You big guy!

1429
01:22:31,121 --> 01:22:33,089
Loser. You freak!

1430
01:22:37,861 --> 01:22:39,522
Oh, no. No.

1431
01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:05,821
I'm sorry I ruined

1432
01:23:05,889 --> 01:23:08,824
your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.

1433
01:23:08,892 --> 01:23:11,224
She tastes like cigarettes.

1434
01:23:27,344 --> 01:23:29,278
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured

1435
01:23:29,346 --> 01:23:32,281
there's some things
you just can't change.

1436
01:23:32,349 --> 01:23:35,284
He didn't want
to be called crippled

1437
01:23:35,352 --> 01:23:38,788
just like I didn't
want to be called stupid.

1438
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:44,986
Happy new year, Gump.

1439
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,291
The U.S. Ping-Pong team

1440
01:23:51,368 --> 01:23:52,801
met with President Nixon today...

1441
01:23:52,869 --> 01:23:54,496
Wouldn't you know it?

1442
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,300
A few months later,

1443
01:23:56,373 --> 01:23:59,308
they invited me
and the Ping-Pong team

1444
01:23:59,376 --> 01:24:00,809
to visit the White House.

1445
01:24:00,877 --> 01:24:02,276
So I went...

1446
01:24:02,345 --> 01:24:03,505
again.

1447
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,380
And I met the president
of the United States again.

1448
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:10,011
Only this time,
they didn't get us rooms

1449
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,816
in a real fancy hotel.

1450
01:24:11,888 --> 01:24:13,321
Are you enjoying yourself

1451
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,324
in our nation's capital,
young man?

1452
01:24:15,392 --> 01:24:16,825
Where are you staying?

1453
01:24:16,893 --> 01:24:18,326
Ls called the Hotel Ebbott.

1454
01:24:18,395 --> 01:24:21,330
Oh, no, no, no.
I know a much nicer hotel.

1455
01:24:21,398 --> 01:24:22,763
Ls brand-new. Very modern.

1456
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:25,461
I'll have my people
take care of it.

1457
01:24:25,535 --> 01:24:26,763
Security.

1458
01:24:26,837 --> 01:24:28,270
Yeah. Sir,

1459
01:24:28,338 --> 01:24:31,273
you might want to send
a maintenance man

1460
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:33,775
over to that office
across the way.

1461
01:24:33,844 --> 01:24:35,277
The lights are off

1462
01:24:35,345 --> 01:24:38,280
and they must be looking
for a fuse box,

1463
01:24:38,348 --> 01:24:41,283
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1464
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:43,285
O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.

1465
01:24:43,353 --> 01:24:44,650
Thank you. Good night.

1466
01:24:47,858 --> 01:24:49,291
Therefore...

1467
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,293
I shall resign the presidency

1468
01:24:51,361 --> 01:24:53,625
effective at noon tomorrow.

1469
01:24:53,697 --> 01:24:55,631
Vice President Ford

1470
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:57,792
will be sworn in as president

1471
01:24:57,868 --> 01:25:00,530
at that hour in this office.

1472
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,115
Forrest Gump.

1473
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:14,810
Yes, sir!

1474
01:25:14,885 --> 01:25:16,318
As you were.

1475
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:18,320
I have your discharge papers.

1476
01:25:18,388 --> 01:25:20,049
Service is up, son.

1477
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:25,624
Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?

1478
01:25:25,695 --> 01:25:27,663
For the army, it does.

1479
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,767
Andjust like that,

1480
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:35,271
my service in
the United States Army was over.

1481
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,811
So I went home.

1482
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,024
I'm home, Mama.

1483
01:26:05,101 --> 01:26:07,501
I know. I know.

1484
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,305
Louise, he's here.

1485
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:13,308
Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,

1486
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,810
but Mama had all sorts
of visitors.

1487
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:17,813
We've had all sorts of visitors.

1488
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:21,317
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1489
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:24,251
One man even left
a check for $25,000

1490
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:27,757
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

1491
01:26:27,824 --> 01:26:30,759
I only like using
my own paddle.

1492
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:32,226
Hi, Miss Louise.

1493
01:26:32,295 --> 01:26:33,284
Hey, Forrest.

1494
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:36,264
I know that,
but is $25,000, Forrest.

1495
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:39,769
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

1496
01:26:39,836 --> 01:26:42,270
see if it grows on you.

1497
01:26:42,339 --> 01:26:44,273
That Mama, she sure was right.

1498
01:26:44,341 --> 01:26:47,076
Ls funny how things work out.

1499
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:49,109
I didn't stay home for long

1500
01:26:49,178 --> 01:26:51,612
because I'd made
a promise to Bubba,

1501
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,114
and I always try
to keep my promise,

1502
01:26:54,183 --> 01:26:56,617
so I went on down
to Bayou La Batre

1503
01:26:56,685 --> 01:26:58,175
to meet Bubba's family.

1504
01:26:58,253 --> 01:27:02,656
Are you crazy
or just plain stupid?

1505
01:27:02,724 --> 01:27:05,955
Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.

1506
01:27:06,028 --> 01:27:06,960
I guess.

1507
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:08,462
And, of course,

1508
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:11,624
I paid my respect
to Bubba himself.

1509
01:27:12,868 --> 01:27:15,530
Hey, Bubba.
Ls me, Forrest Gump.

1510
01:27:18,874 --> 01:27:20,808
I remember everything
you said,

1511
01:27:20,876 --> 01:27:23,743
and I got it
all figured out.

1512
01:27:25,414 --> 01:27:32,047
I'm taking $24,562.47

1513
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:34,248
that I got, thas left

1514
01:27:34,323 --> 01:27:36,757
after a new haircut
and a new suit

1515
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:39,760
and took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1516
01:27:39,828 --> 01:27:42,695
and I bought a bus ticket,
then three Dr. Peppers.

1517
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:44,755
Tell me something.

1518
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:47,267
Are you stupid or something?

1519
01:27:47,336 --> 01:27:50,032
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1520
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:52,039
Thas whas left
after me saying,

1521
01:27:52,107 --> 01:27:56,043
"When I was in China on
the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1522
01:27:56,111 --> 01:27:58,045
"I just loved
playing Ping-Pong

1523
01:27:58,113 --> 01:28:00,240
with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle,"

1524
01:28:00,315 --> 01:28:02,249
which everybody knows isn't true,

1525
01:28:02,317 --> 01:28:05,252
but Mama said it was just
a little white lie,

1526
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,254
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1527
01:28:07,322 --> 01:28:09,756
So anyway,
I'm putting all that

1528
01:28:09,825 --> 01:28:12,259
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1529
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:15,262
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1530
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:39,821
Now Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1531
01:28:39,888 --> 01:28:42,823
but you know what I found out?

1532
01:28:43,892 --> 01:28:46,452
Shrimping is tough.

1533
01:28:48,397 --> 01:28:51,059
I only caught five.

1534
01:28:51,133 --> 01:28:54,569
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

1535
01:28:56,405 --> 01:28:59,340
Hey, you ever think about
naming this old boat?

1536
01:28:59,408 --> 01:29:02,343
Ls bad luck to have
a boat without a name.

1537
01:29:02,411 --> 01:29:04,845
I'd never named a boat before,

1538
01:29:04,913 --> 01:29:09,941
but there was only one
I could think of,

1539
01:29:10,018 --> 01:29:13,977
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

1540
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,550
#Do a little dance #

1541
01:29:19,628 --> 01:29:21,596
#Make a little love #

1542
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:23,597
#Get down tonight #

1543
01:29:23,665 --> 01:29:25,963
#Get down tonight #

1544
01:29:26,034 --> 01:29:28,229
#Do a little dance #

1545
01:29:28,303 --> 01:29:30,066
#Make a little love #

1546
01:29:30,138 --> 01:29:31,765
#Get down tonight #

1547
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,932
#Whoo #

1548
01:29:33,008 --> 01:29:34,305
#Get down tonight... ##

1549
01:29:34,376 --> 01:29:36,776
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny

1550
01:29:36,845 --> 01:29:38,142
in a long while,

1551
01:29:38,213 --> 01:29:40,647
but I thought about her a lot.

1552
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:43,810
I hoped whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1553
01:29:43,885 --> 01:29:48,913
# Oh, and the bird
you cannot change #

1554
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:59,062
#And this bird
you cannot change #

1555
01:29:59,134 --> 01:30:06,506
# Lord knows I can't change #

1556
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:13,504
# Lord, help me, I can't change ##

1557
01:31:29,724 --> 01:31:33,160
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1558
01:31:56,484 --> 01:31:58,577
Hey!

1559
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:26,706
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1560
01:32:26,781 --> 01:32:30,148
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.

1561
01:32:30,218 --> 01:32:33,153
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1562
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:34,654
Yes, I know that.

1563
01:32:34,722 --> 01:32:38,920
You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.

1564
01:32:38,993 --> 01:32:41,359
Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.

1565
01:32:41,429 --> 01:32:44,296
I had to see this for myself...

1566
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,067
and...

1567
01:32:47,135 --> 01:32:51,572
I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1568
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:53,573
that I'd be your first mate.

1569
01:32:53,641 --> 01:32:55,302
Well, here I am.

1570
01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:57,310
I'm a man of my word.

1571
01:32:57,378 --> 01:32:58,402
O.K.

1572
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:00,640
But don't you be thinking

1573
01:33:00,715 --> 01:33:03,149
that I'm going
to be calling you "sir."

1574
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:04,149
No, sir.

1575
01:33:12,693 --> 01:33:14,217
Ls my boat.

1576
01:33:17,398 --> 01:33:21,494
I have a feeling
if we head due east,

1577
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:25,130
we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.

1578
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:27,974
Take a left!

1579
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:28,974
Which way?

1580
01:33:29,043 --> 01:33:29,975
Over there!

1581
01:33:30,044 --> 01:33:31,477
They're over there!

1582
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:34,879
Get on the wheel
and take a left.

1583
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:36,382
O.K.

1584
01:33:37,718 --> 01:33:39,652
Gump, what are you doing?

1585
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,153
Take a left!

1586
01:33:41,222 --> 01:33:42,211
Left!

1587
01:33:44,091 --> 01:33:48,027
Thas where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1588
01:33:48,095 --> 01:33:49,027
Ha ha!

1589
01:33:49,096 --> 01:33:51,223
Thas where we'll find them.

1590
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:05,578
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1591
01:34:05,646 --> 01:34:07,580
O.K., so I was wrong.

1592
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:10,583
Well, how are we
going to find them?

1593
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:14,678
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1594
01:34:14,755 --> 01:34:17,417
# So pray that #

1595
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:20,757
# I'm homeward bound... ##

1596
01:34:20,828 --> 01:34:23,524
So I went to church every Sunday.

1597
01:34:24,966 --> 01:34:26,900
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1598
01:34:26,968 --> 01:34:30,836
though I think he left
the praying up to me.

1599
01:34:45,353 --> 01:34:46,752
No shrimp.

1600
01:34:47,855 --> 01:34:50,790
Where the hell's
this God of yours?

1601
01:34:50,858 --> 01:34:53,292
Ls funny Lieutenant Dan said that

1602
01:34:53,361 --> 01:34:57,231
'cause right then God showed up.

1603
01:35:12,879 --> 01:35:15,313
[Dan]
You'll never sink this boat!

1604
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:18,044
Now, me, I was scared,

1605
01:35:18,118 --> 01:35:22,179
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1606
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:23,245
Come on!

1607
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:28,090
You call this a storm?

1608
01:35:28,161 --> 01:35:32,097
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1609
01:35:32,165 --> 01:35:36,101
Ls time for a showdown!

1610
01:35:36,169 --> 01:35:37,636
You and me!

1611
01:35:37,704 --> 01:35:40,764
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

1612
01:35:40,841 --> 01:35:43,366
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1613
01:35:43,443 --> 01:35:44,876
You'll never sink...

1614
01:35:44,945 --> 01:35:46,242
this...

1615
01:35:46,313 --> 01:35:47,405
boat!

1616
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:49,415
Ha ha ha ha!

1617
01:35:49,483 --> 01:35:51,618
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

1618
01:35:51,751 --> 01:35:53,548
destroying nearly
everything in its path.

1619
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,555
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1620
01:35:56,623 --> 01:35:59,421
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1621
01:35:59,492 --> 01:36:01,824
has fallen victim to Carmen

1622
01:36:01,894 --> 01:36:04,727
and has been left in utter ruin.

1623
01:36:04,797 --> 01:36:06,230
This reporter has learned,

1624
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:08,733
in fact, only one shrimping boat

1625
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:10,325
actually survived the storm.

1626
01:36:10,403 --> 01:36:12,871
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1627
01:36:12,939 --> 01:36:16,033
[Gump]
After that, shrimping was easy.

1628
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:18,873
#There will be great bounty #

1629
01:36:18,945 --> 01:36:21,607
# Oh, my God... ##

1630
01:36:21,681 --> 01:36:23,615
Since people still
needed them shrimps

1631
01:36:23,683 --> 01:36:26,049
for shrimp cocktails
and barbecues and all

1632
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:29,054
and we were the only boat
left standing,

1633
01:36:29,122 --> 01:36:31,556
Bubba Gump shrimp's
what they got.

1634
01:36:31,624 --> 01:36:34,559
We got a whole bunch of boats.

1635
01:36:34,627 --> 01:36:36,561
12 Jennys, big old warehouse.

1636
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:38,563
We even have hats

1637
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:41,065
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1638
01:36:41,134 --> 01:36:42,567
Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1639
01:36:42,635 --> 01:36:44,068
Ls a household name.

1640
01:36:44,137 --> 01:36:45,798
Hold on there, boy.

1641
01:36:45,872 --> 01:36:48,306
Are you telling me
you're the owner

1642
01:36:48,374 --> 01:36:50,604
of the Bubba Gump
Shrimp Corporation?

1643
01:36:50,677 --> 01:36:53,612
Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1644
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,615
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time,

1645
01:36:56,683 --> 01:36:59,618
but that tops them all.

1646
01:36:59,686 --> 01:37:01,654
Ha ha ha ha!

1647
01:37:01,721 --> 01:37:05,122
We were sitting
next to a millionaire.

1648
01:37:08,127 --> 01:37:13,121
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

1649
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,259
and you tell it so well,

1650
01:37:16,335 --> 01:37:18,428
with such enthusiasm.

1651
01:37:18,504 --> 01:37:22,600
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1652
01:37:22,675 --> 01:37:24,905
Yes, I would.

1653
01:37:29,182 --> 01:37:30,809
Thas him right there.

1654
01:37:33,052 --> 01:37:36,112
Let me tell you
something about Lieutenant Dan.

1655
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:37,679
Forrest...

1656
01:37:42,862 --> 01:37:46,992
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

1657
01:38:12,191 --> 01:38:14,625
He never actually said so,

1658
01:38:14,694 --> 01:38:19,063
but I think
he made his peace with God.

1659
01:38:24,704 --> 01:38:25,762
[Gunshots]

1660
01:38:25,838 --> 01:38:28,636
For the second time in 17 days,

1661
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:31,142
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1662
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:34,145
Base to Jenny 1.
Base to Jenny 1.

1663
01:38:34,213 --> 01:38:35,646
Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1664
01:38:35,715 --> 01:38:37,649
Forrest has a phone call.

1665
01:38:37,717 --> 01:38:42,154
Yeah, well, you'll have
to tell them to call him back.

1666
01:38:42,221 --> 01:38:44,655
He is indisposed at the moment.

1667
01:38:44,724 --> 01:38:46,191
His mama's sick.

1668
01:39:05,278 --> 01:39:06,210
Where's Mama?

1669
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:08,076
She's upstairs.

1670
01:39:10,516 --> 01:39:12,245
Hi, Forrest.

1671
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:14,513
I'll see you tomorrow.

1672
01:39:14,587 --> 01:39:15,884
Oh, all right.

1673
01:39:22,261 --> 01:39:25,094
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1674
01:39:37,276 --> 01:39:38,766
Whas the matter, Mama?

1675
01:39:38,845 --> 01:39:42,008
I'm dying, Forrest.

1676
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:47,051
Come on in,
sit down over here.

1677
01:40:00,766 --> 01:40:02,893
Why are you dying, Mama?

1678
01:40:02,969 --> 01:40:05,062
Ls my time.

1679
01:40:05,137 --> 01:40:08,197
Ls just my time.

1680
01:40:08,274 --> 01:40:10,299
Oh, now...

1681
01:40:11,377 --> 01:40:13,937
don't you be afraid,
sweetheart.

1682
01:40:14,013 --> 01:40:17,414
Death is just a part of life.

1683
01:40:17,483 --> 01:40:21,442
Something we're all
destined to do.

1684
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,852
I didn't know it,

1685
01:40:23,923 --> 01:40:26,858
but I was destined
to be your mama.

1686
01:40:26,926 --> 01:40:29,656
I did the best I could.

1687
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:31,663
You did good.

1688
01:40:31,731 --> 01:40:38,000
Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1689
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:42,598
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1690
01:40:46,112 --> 01:40:48,706
Whas my destiny, Mama?

1691
01:40:48,781 --> 01:40:53,218
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1692
01:40:54,553 --> 01:40:57,488
Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest.

1693
01:40:57,556 --> 01:41:00,491
You never know what
you're going to get.

1694
01:41:00,559 --> 01:41:03,494
Mama always had a way
of explaining things

1695
01:41:03,562 --> 01:41:05,496
so I could understand them.

1696
01:41:05,564 --> 01:41:07,031
I will miss you, Forrest.

1697
01:41:08,768 --> 01:41:11,032
She had got the cancer

1698
01:41:11,103 --> 01:41:13,037
and died on a Tuesday.

1699
01:41:13,105 --> 01:41:15,699
I bought her a new hat

1700
01:41:15,775 --> 01:41:17,800
with little flowers on it.

1701
01:41:20,746 --> 01:41:23,442
And thas all I have
to say about that.

1702
01:41:30,723 --> 01:41:33,419
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?

1703
01:41:33,492 --> 01:41:36,222
There'll be another one
along shortly.

1704
01:41:39,732 --> 01:41:44,169
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1705
01:41:44,236 --> 01:41:47,171
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1706
01:41:47,239 --> 01:41:48,672
and a college graduate,

1707
01:41:48,741 --> 01:41:51,175
the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,

1708
01:41:51,243 --> 01:41:53,734
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1709
01:41:55,247 --> 01:41:58,774
So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1710
01:41:58,851 --> 01:42:01,786
though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.

1711
01:42:01,854 --> 01:42:04,789
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1712
01:42:04,857 --> 01:42:07,291
So then I got a call from him

1713
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,920
saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,

1714
01:42:09,996 --> 01:42:14,399
and I said,
"Thas good. One less thing."

1715
01:42:14,467 --> 01:42:16,264
# I've got a new hope... ##

1716
01:42:16,335 --> 01:42:18,769
Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune

1717
01:42:18,838 --> 01:42:20,465
a man really needs,

1718
01:42:20,539 --> 01:42:23,940
and the rest
isjust for showing off.

1719
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,911
So I gave a whole bunch of it

1720
01:42:26,979 --> 01:42:30,244
to the Foursquare Gospel Church...

1721
01:42:30,316 --> 01:42:35,379
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...

1722
01:42:36,856 --> 01:42:39,290
and even though Bubba was dead

1723
01:42:39,358 --> 01:42:42,794
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1724
01:42:42,862 --> 01:42:45,592
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1725
01:42:48,968 --> 01:42:50,629
You know what?

1726
01:42:50,703 --> 01:42:54,639
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1727
01:42:54,707 --> 01:42:57,301
That smells wonderful.

1728
01:42:57,376 --> 01:42:59,810
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire

1729
01:42:59,879 --> 01:43:02,814
and I liked doing it so much,

1730
01:43:02,882 --> 01:43:06,318
I cut that grass for free.

1731
01:43:07,753 --> 01:43:11,189
But at nighttime
when there was nothing to do

1732
01:43:11,257 --> 01:43:13,691
and the house was all empty,

1733
01:43:13,759 --> 01:43:16,694
I'd always think ofJenny.

1734
01:44:20,259 --> 01:44:24,059
And then... she was there.

1735
01:44:56,828 --> 01:44:58,125
Hello, Forrest.

1736
01:44:58,196 --> 01:45:00,391
Hello, Jenny.

1737
01:45:11,243 --> 01:45:14,371
Jenny came back
and stayed with me.

1738
01:45:14,446 --> 01:45:19,281
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1739
01:45:19,351 --> 01:45:22,718
or maybe it was because
she was so tired

1740
01:45:22,788 --> 01:45:26,224
'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept

1741
01:45:26,291 --> 01:45:28,521
like she hadn't slept in years.

1742
01:45:28,593 --> 01:45:30,959
It was wonderful
having her home.

1743
01:45:31,029 --> 01:45:33,463
Every day we'd take a walk,

1744
01:45:33,532 --> 01:45:37,468
and I'djabber on
like a monkey in a tree,

1745
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:40,471
and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping

1746
01:45:40,539 --> 01:45:43,474
and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.

1747
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:45,476
I did all the talking.

1748
01:45:45,544 --> 01:45:48,035
Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.

1749
01:46:27,686 --> 01:46:30,416
How could you do this?

1750
01:47:07,726 --> 01:47:12,220
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1751
01:47:13,732 --> 01:47:16,667
I never really knew
why she came back,

1752
01:47:16,735 --> 01:47:18,168
but I didn't care.

1753
01:47:18,236 --> 01:47:20,170
It was like olden times.

1754
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:23,036
We was like
peas and carrots again.

1755
01:47:24,676 --> 01:47:27,110
Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers

1756
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:30,740
and put them in her room for her,

1757
01:47:30,816 --> 01:47:34,252
and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get

1758
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:35,752
in the wide world.

1759
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:38,346
They're made just for running.

1760
01:47:38,423 --> 01:47:39,685
#Carry me home to see my kin #

1761
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,885
And she even showed me
how to dance.

1762
01:47:46,731 --> 01:47:49,097
#I miss ol'Bammy once again #

1763
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:50,395
#And I think is a sin #

1764
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:53,331
#Sweet home Alabama... ##

1765
01:47:53,405 --> 01:47:58,433
Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...

1766
01:48:01,346 --> 01:48:04,543
and it was the happiest time
in my life.

1767
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:30,173
You done watching it?

1768
01:48:30,242 --> 01:48:31,174
Mm-hmm.

1769
01:48:31,243 --> 01:48:33,234
I'm going to bed.

1770
01:48:44,155 --> 01:48:45,713
Will you marry me?

1771
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:53,730
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1772
01:48:56,267 --> 01:48:58,167
You would, Forrest.

1773
01:49:00,605 --> 01:49:02,368
But you won't marry me.

1774
01:49:04,775 --> 01:49:07,175
You don't want to marry me.

1775
01:49:10,281 --> 01:49:12,681
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1776
01:49:18,122 --> 01:49:20,056
I'm not a smart man,

1777
01:49:20,124 --> 01:49:24,584
but I know what love is.

1778
01:50:01,499 --> 01:50:02,761
Jenny...

1779
01:50:04,835 --> 01:50:07,133
Forrest, I do love you.

1780
01:51:00,157 --> 01:51:02,751
Where are you running off to?

1781
01:51:02,827 --> 01:51:04,385
I'm not running.

1782
01:52:34,819 --> 01:52:36,787
That day,

1783
01:52:36,854 --> 01:52:38,287
for no particular reason,

1784
01:52:38,355 --> 01:52:41,347
I decided to go for a little run.

1785
01:52:41,425 --> 01:52:44,883
So I ran to the end of the road,

1786
01:52:44,962 --> 01:52:48,295
and when I got there, I thought
maybe I'd run to the end of town.

1787
01:52:48,365 --> 01:52:50,993
[TV] President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...

1788
01:52:51,068 --> 01:52:53,059
And when I got there,

1789
01:52:53,137 --> 01:52:57,073
I thought maybe I'djust
run across Greenbow County.

1790
01:52:57,141 --> 01:52:59,575
Now, I figured
since I'd run this far,

1791
01:52:59,643 --> 01:53:03,511
maybe I'djust run across
the great state of Alabama.

1792
01:53:03,581 --> 01:53:05,515
And thas what I did.

1793
01:53:05,583 --> 01:53:07,574
I ran clear across Alabama.

1794
01:53:07,651 --> 01:53:12,179
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

1795
01:53:12,256 --> 01:53:14,190
I ran clear to the ocean.

1796
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:21,022
And when I got there,

1797
01:53:21,098 --> 01:53:23,532
I figured since
I'd gone this far,

1798
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:26,764
might as well turn around,
just keep on going.

1799
01:53:28,806 --> 01:53:31,866
And when I got to another ocean,

1800
01:53:31,942 --> 01:53:34,877
I figured since
I'd gone this far...

1801
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:39,078
I might as well just turn back

1802
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:40,742
and keep right on going.

1803
01:53:40,818 --> 01:53:44,151
When I got tired, I slept.

1804
01:53:44,221 --> 01:53:46,314
When I got hungry, I ate.

1805
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:48,824
When I had to go...

1806
01:53:48,893 --> 01:53:49,917

1807
01:53:51,061 --> 01:53:52,221
I went.

1808
01:53:52,296 --> 01:53:53,490
And so...

1809
01:53:53,564 --> 01:53:55,589
you just ran.

1810
01:53:57,234 --> 01:53:58,792
Yeah.

1811
01:53:58,869 --> 01:54:02,566
# Lookin' out at the road
rushin' under my wheels #

1812
01:54:05,743 --> 01:54:08,610
# Lookin' back
at the years gone by #

1813
01:54:08,679 --> 01:54:10,977
# Like so many summer fields #

1814
01:54:12,583 --> 01:54:15,814
# In '65, I was 17 #

1823
01:54:33,771 --> 01:54:35,363
I'd think a lot...

1824
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:39,705
about Mama and Bubba
and Lieutenant Dan.

1825
01:54:39,777 --> 01:54:41,301
But most of all,

1826
01:54:41,378 --> 01:54:43,369
I thought about Jenny.

1827
01:54:43,447 --> 01:54:46,211
I thought about her a lot.

01:54:47,685 --> 01:54:49,277

stopping only to sleep,

1831
01:54:54,225 --> 01:54:56,489

1832
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,653

brings you this report.

1833
01:54:58,729 --> 01:54:59,991
For the fourth time

1834
01:55:00,064 --> 01:55:01,656
on hisjourney across America,

1835
01:55:01,732 --> 01:55:04,166
Forrest Gump, the gardener
from Greenbow, Alabama,

1836
01:55:04,235 --> 01:55:06,999
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1837
01:55:07,071 --> 01:55:08,504
I'll be damned. Forrest?

1838
01:55:08,572 --> 01:55:10,506
Sir, where are you running?

1839
01:55:10,574 --> 01:55:13,008
Are you doing this
for world peace?

1840
01:55:13,077 --> 01:55:15,511
Are you doing this
for the homeless?

1841
01:55:15,579 --> 01:55:17,513
Are you running
for women's rights?

They just couldn't believe

1844
01:55:19,917 --> 01:55:22,351
that somebody would do
all that running

1845
01:55:22,419 --> 01:55:23,852
for no particular reason.

1846
01:55:23,921 --> 01:55:25,513
Why are you doing this?

1847
01:55:25,589 --> 01:55:27,853
I just felt like running.

1848
01:55:27,925 --> 01:55:29,552
I just felt like runnin'.

1849
01:55:30,628 --> 01:55:31,560
Thas you.

1850
01:55:31,629 --> 01:55:34,223
I can't believe is really you.

1851
01:55:34,298 --> 01:55:35,731
Now... for some reason,

1852
01:55:35,799 --> 01:55:38,233
what I was doing seemed to...

1853
01:55:38,302 --> 01:55:39,826
make sense to people.

1854
01:55:39,903 --> 01:55:42,838
It was like an alarm
went off in my head.

1855
01:55:42,906 --> 01:55:45,932
I said, "Here's a guy
thas got his act together.

1856
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:47,944
Here's somebody
who has the answer."

1857
01:55:48,012 --> 01:55:49,946
I'll follow you
anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1858
01:55:50,014 --> 01:55:52,346
So I got company.

1859
01:55:53,884 --> 01:55:56,444
And after that,
I got more company.

1860
01:55:56,520 --> 01:56:00,047
And then, even
more peoplejoined in.

1861
01:56:02,059 --> 01:56:03,793
Somebody later told me

1862
01:56:03,926 --> 01:56:05,484
it gave people hope.

1863
01:56:07,062 --> 01:56:08,222
Now...

1864
01:56:08,297 --> 01:56:10,788
Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1865
01:56:10,866 --> 01:56:13,300
but some of those people asked me

1866
01:56:13,369 --> 01:56:15,303
if I could help them out.

1867
01:56:15,371 --> 01:56:17,805
I was wondering
if you might help me.

1868
01:56:17,873 --> 01:56:19,807
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1869
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:21,467
I need a good slogan,

1870
01:56:21,544 --> 01:56:23,478
and since you've
been so inspirational,

1871
01:56:23,546 --> 01:56:26,140
I thought you might
be able to help me...

1872
01:56:26,215 --> 01:56:27,978
Whoa, man! You just ran

1873
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:30,348
through a big pile of dog shit!

Sometimes.

1877
01:56:39,428 --> 01:56:41,896
And some years later,
I heard that that fella

1878
01:56:41,964 --> 01:56:44,228
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan

1879
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:47,565
and made a lot of money
off of it.

1880
01:56:47,636 --> 01:56:49,570
Another time,
I was running along.

1881
01:56:49,638 --> 01:56:52,573
Somebody who'd lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1882
01:56:52,641 --> 01:56:56,077
he wanted to put my face
on a T-shirt,

1883
01:56:56,145 --> 01:56:58,079
but he couldn't draw that well,

1884
01:56:58,147 --> 01:57:00,081
and he didn't have a camera.

1885
01:57:00,149 --> 01:57:03,585
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

Have a nice day.

1888
01:57:11,393 --> 01:57:13,327
Some years later, I found out

1889
01:57:13,395 --> 01:57:16,831
that that man did come up
with an idea for a T-shirt.

1890
01:57:16,899 --> 01:57:19,060
He made a lot of money.

1891
01:57:21,403 --> 01:57:23,337
Anyway, like I was saying,

1892
01:57:23,405 --> 01:57:26,340
I had a lot of company.

1893
01:57:26,408 --> 01:57:27,841
My mama always said,

1894
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:30,845
"You got to put the past
behind you

1895
01:57:30,913 --> 01:57:33,347
before you can move on."

1896
01:57:33,415 --> 01:57:37,351
And I think thas
what my running was all about.

1897
01:57:38,754 --> 01:57:41,348

No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.

1968
02:01:34,323 --> 02:01:35,290
O.K. Thanks.

1969
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,394
This is my
very good friend Mr. Gump.

1970
02:01:40,462 --> 02:01:41,724
Can you say hi?

1971
02:01:41,797 --> 02:01:43,230
Hello, Mr. Gump.

1972
02:01:43,298 --> 02:01:44,162
Hello.

1973
02:01:44,233 --> 02:01:46,463
Can I go watch TV now?

1974
02:01:46,535 --> 02:01:48,366
Yes. Just keep it low.

1975
02:01:50,572 --> 02:01:52,335
You're a mama, Jenny.

1976
02:01:52,407 --> 02:01:53,874
I'm a mama.

1977
02:01:57,212 --> 02:01:58,645
His name's Forrest.

1978
02:02:00,082 --> 02:02:01,014
Like me!

1979
02:02:02,417 --> 02:02:04,851
I named him after his daddy.

1980
02:02:06,088 --> 02:02:09,854
He got a daddy
named Forrest, too?

1981
02:02:09,925 --> 02:02:11,358
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1982
02:02:26,275 --> 02:02:27,867
Hey...

1983
02:02:27,943 --> 02:02:29,376
Forrest, look at me.

1984
02:02:29,444 --> 02:02:31,912
Look at me, Forrest.

1985
02:02:33,949 --> 02:02:35,883
There's nothing you need to do.

1986
02:02:35,951 --> 02:02:37,885
You didn't do anything wrong.

1987
02:02:38,954 --> 02:02:39,886
O. K?

1988
02:02:44,393 --> 02:02:46,122
Isn't he beautiful?

1989
02:02:47,396 --> 02:02:50,331
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1990
02:02:54,403 --> 02:02:55,335
But...

1991
02:02:58,907 --> 02:03:01,341
is... is he s-smart? Like, can he...

1992
02:03:01,410 --> 02:03:03,002
He's very smart.

1993
02:03:03,078 --> 02:03:06,275
He's one of
the smartest in his class.

1994
02:03:14,923 --> 02:03:17,517
Yeah, is O.K.
Go talk to him.

1995
02:03:26,935 --> 02:03:28,368
What are you watching?

1996
02:03:28,437 --> 02:03:29,870
Bert and Ernie.

1997
02:03:52,893 --> 02:03:54,087
Forrest...

1998
02:03:56,063 --> 02:03:57,394
I'm sick.

1999
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:03,336
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

2000
02:04:03,404 --> 02:04:06,840
I have some kind of virus,
and the doctors,

2001
02:04:06,907 --> 02:04:08,841
they don't know what it is,

2002
02:04:08,909 --> 02:04:12,003
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

2003
02:04:16,750 --> 02:04:18,843
You could come home with me.

2004
02:04:20,588 --> 02:04:22,180
Jenny, you and...

2005
02:04:22,256 --> 02:04:23,188
little Forrest

2006
02:04:23,257 --> 02:04:24,690
could come stay

2007
02:04:24,758 --> 02:04:27,056
at my house in Greenbow.

2008
02:04:30,431 --> 02:04:33,525
I'll take care of you
if you're sick.

2009
02:04:35,769 --> 02:04:37,862
Would you marry me, Forrest?

2010
02:04:43,777 --> 02:04:44,744
O.K.

2011
02:04:45,913 --> 02:04:47,642
[Man]
Please take your seats.

2012
02:04:51,218 --> 02:04:52,480
Forrest?

2013
02:04:52,553 --> 02:04:54,214
Ls time to start.

2014
02:05:13,073 --> 02:05:14,005
Hi.

2015
02:05:15,242 --> 02:05:16,573
Your tie.

2016
02:05:29,323 --> 02:05:31,587
Lieutenant Dan.

2017
02:05:46,373 --> 02:05:48,000
Lieutenant Dan.

2018
02:05:49,209 --> 02:05:50,699
Hello, Forrest.

2019
02:05:50,778 --> 02:05:53,303
You got new legs.

2020
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:55,314
New legs!

2021
02:05:55,382 --> 02:05:58,476
Yeah. I got new legs.

2022
02:05:58,552 --> 02:05:59,814
Custom-made.

2023
02:05:59,887 --> 02:06:00,979
Titanium alloy.

2024
02:06:01,055 --> 02:06:04,149
Ls what they use
on the space shuttle.

2025
02:06:07,895 --> 02:06:09,522
Magic legs.

2026
02:06:11,398 --> 02:06:12,330
This...

2027
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:14,924
is my fiancée.

2028
02:06:15,002 --> 02:06:15,934
Susan.

2029
02:06:18,405 --> 02:06:20,965
Lieutenant Dan.

2030
02:06:21,041 --> 02:06:23,134
Hi, Forrest.

2031
02:06:23,210 --> 02:06:25,678
Lieutenant Dan...

2032
02:06:25,746 --> 02:06:27,338
this is my Jenny.

2033
02:06:27,414 --> 02:06:30,679
Hi. Ls nice
to meet you finally.

2034
02:06:40,961 --> 02:06:43,521
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny

2035
02:06:43,597 --> 02:06:45,064
to be your wife?

2036
02:06:46,867 --> 02:06:49,301
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

2037
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:50,962
to be your husband?

2038
02:06:52,539 --> 02:06:55,997
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

2039
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:27,866
Hi.

2040
02:07:27,941 --> 02:07:29,033
Hi.

2041
02:07:42,089 --> 02:07:43,488
Hey, Forrest...

2042
02:07:48,862 --> 02:07:51,353
were you scared in Vietnam?

2043
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:54,463
Yes.

2044
02:07:54,535 --> 02:07:56,127
Well, I...

2045
02:07:56,203 --> 02:07:58,330
I don't know.

2046
02:07:58,405 --> 02:08:00,464
Sometimes it would stop raining

2047
02:08:00,541 --> 02:08:03,942
long enough for
the stars to come out...

2048
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:08,814
and then it was nice.

2049
02:08:12,086 --> 02:08:15,146
It was like just
before the sun goes to bed

2050
02:08:15,222 --> 02:08:16,621
down on the bayou.

2051
02:08:16,690 --> 02:08:21,423
There was always
a million sparkles on the water...

2052
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:25,357
like that mountain lake.

2053
02:08:25,432 --> 02:08:27,366
It was so clear, Jenny,

2054
02:08:27,434 --> 02:08:30,369
it looked like
there were two skies

2055
02:08:30,437 --> 02:08:32,371
one on top of the other.

2056
02:08:34,074 --> 02:08:37,441
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up...

2057
02:08:39,913 --> 02:08:41,346
I couldn't tell

2058
02:08:41,415 --> 02:08:47,217
where heaven stopped
and the earth began.

2059
02:08:48,522 --> 02:08:50,683
Ls so beautiful.

2060
02:08:54,762 --> 02:08:57,788
I wish I coulïve
been there with you.

2061
02:09:01,034 --> 02:09:03,025
You were.

2062
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:14,975
I love you.

2063
02:09:19,052 --> 02:09:22,180
[Gump]
You died on a Saturday morning.

2064
02:09:24,057 --> 02:09:28,153
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

2065
02:09:32,566 --> 02:09:36,002
And I had that house
of your father's

2066
02:09:36,069 --> 02:09:38,333
bulldozed to the ground.

2067
02:09:41,575 --> 02:09:42,769
Mama...

2068
02:09:43,911 --> 02:09:45,845
always said

2069
02:09:45,913 --> 02:09:50,009
that dyin' was a part of life.

2070
02:09:52,586 --> 02:09:54,349
I sure wish it wasn't.

2071
02:09:57,758 --> 02:09:59,282
Little Forrest is...

2072
02:10:00,594 --> 02:10:02,858
doing just fine.

2073
02:10:02,930 --> 02:10:03,919
"But..."

2074
02:10:03,997 --> 02:10:06,431
About to start school again soon,

2075
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:08,525
and...

2076
02:10:08,602 --> 02:10:11,867
and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner

2077
02:10:11,939 --> 02:10:12,997
every day.

2078
02:10:14,775 --> 02:10:16,367
I make sure he...

2079
02:10:17,778 --> 02:10:19,211
combs his hair

2080
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:21,372
and brushes his teeth every day.

2081
02:10:23,617 --> 02:10:26,177
Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong.

2082
02:10:28,455 --> 02:10:29,888
He's really good.

2083
02:10:29,957 --> 02:10:32,050
Uh, Forrest, you go.

2084
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:33,183
Uhh!

2085
02:10:36,630 --> 02:10:38,063
We fish a lot.

2086
02:10:41,468 --> 02:10:43,834
And every night,
we read a book.

2087
02:10:43,904 --> 02:10:45,337
He's so smart, Jenny.

2088
02:10:48,408 --> 02:10:50,501
You'd be so proud of him.

2089
02:10:52,246 --> 02:10:53,508
I am.

2090
02:10:54,915 --> 02:10:58,078
He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter.

2091
02:10:59,419 --> 02:11:02,354
And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,

2092
02:11:02,422 --> 02:11:05,357
so I'll just leave it
here for you.

2093
02:11:21,608 --> 02:11:23,543
Jenny...

2094
02:11:28,447 --> 02:11:31,382
I don't know
if Mama was right

2095
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:34,544
or if it... is
Lieutenant Dan.

2096
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:36,485
I don't know...

2097
02:11:37,623 --> 02:11:40,285
if we each have a...

2098
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:42,586
destiny...

2099
02:11:44,063 --> 02:11:47,829
or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like

2100
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:49,333
on a breeze...

2101
02:11:53,573 --> 02:11:55,507
but I... I think...

2102
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:59,173
maybe is both.

2103
02:12:03,416 --> 02:12:06,647
Maybe both get happening
at the same time.

2104
02:12:12,425 --> 02:12:14,359
But I miss you, Jenny.

2105
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:22,924
If there's anything
you need...

2106
02:12:24,103 --> 02:12:26,037
I won't be far away.

2107
02:12:49,562 --> 02:12:51,496
[Birds Chirping]

2108
02:13:00,406 --> 02:13:02,840
Here's your bus.

2109
02:13:02,908 --> 02:13:04,273
O.K.

2110
02:13:04,343 --> 02:13:06,834
Hey...

2111
02:13:06,912 --> 02:13:08,345
I know this.

2112
02:13:08,414 --> 02:13:10,848
I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell

2113
02:13:10,916 --> 02:13:14,079
because Grandma used
to read it to you.

2114
02:13:14,153 --> 02:13:16,212
My favorite book.

2115
02:13:19,692 --> 02:13:21,125
Here we are.

2116
02:13:21,193 --> 02:13:22,524
Hey...

2117
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,863
here you go.

2118
02:13:31,037 --> 02:13:32,595
Hey, Forrest...

2119
02:13:32,672 --> 02:13:34,139
don't...

2120
02:13:36,942 --> 02:13:39,467
I want to tell you
I love you.

2121
02:13:39,545 --> 02:13:41,513
I love you, too, Daddy.

2122
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:44,447
I'll be right here
when you get back.

2123
02:13:44,517 --> 02:13:45,484
[Pop]

2124
02:13:49,889 --> 02:13:53,325
You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?

2125
02:13:53,392 --> 02:13:57,158
Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
