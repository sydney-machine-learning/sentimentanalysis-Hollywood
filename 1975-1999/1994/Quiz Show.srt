1
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,603
So this is the 300.

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,987
The forward look. 1958 is here today.

3
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,906
That's the Ermine White.
Seventeen coats, hand-sanded.

4
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,539
- I'm sure it's the 17th coat that does it.
- Power steering, power windows,

5
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,617
power brakes, power mirrors.

6
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,127
The new auto-pilot will
make you virtually superfluous.

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,167
- I'm not sure I need a car for that.
- TorqueFlite transmission.

8
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,541
The standard that sets the standard.

9
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,002
And the top operates by
just the touch of a button.

10
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,971
- I can feel the wind in my hair already.
- You just out of school?

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,016
- Harvard Law School.
- That degree sells itself.

12
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,135
Do you live here in Washington?

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,017
- I've been working for the government.
- Oh.

14
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,440
- Not that it's permanent.
- Oh.

15
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,977
Care to get behind the wheel,
Mr. Goodman?

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,902
- Goodwin.
- Oh.

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,360
Just be careful with the cigar.

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,238
Used to be a man drove the car.
Now the car drives the man.

19
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,489
Go on. Turn it over.

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,203
- Here? Is it, uh...
- Go on. It's in neutral.

21
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,168
Listen to that power.

22
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,504
- This is the town for it.
- And with the new Bendix Electrojector,

23
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,214
we can rate this honey up to...

24
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,513
- 390 horsepower.
- Correct to the hoof.

25
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,515
If my wife knew I was here,
she'd kill me.

26
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,016
What a way to go.

27
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,849
- Yeah.
- I see you're admiring the seats.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,694
That's pigskin and calfskin.

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,111
Hand rubbed.

30
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,905
Nicest piece of furniture I own
would be in the garage.

31
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,615
Try the radio.

32
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:03,070
The only thing that sounds
better than the engine is the radio.

33
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,752
<i>The Russians have beaten</i>
<i>us into outer space.</i>

34
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,463
<i>You are listening</i>
<i>to the sound of</i> Sputnik,

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,417
<i>a satellite launched</i>
<i>this morning via rocket,</i>

36
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,253
<i>in orbit, right now,</i>
<i>directly over our heads.</i>

37
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,224
<i>A sound that says</i>
<i>all is not well with America.</i>

38
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,768
America doesn't own the 300.

39
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,688
<i>Oh, the shark, babe</i>

40
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,021
<i>Has such teeth, dear</i>

41
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,157
<i>And he shows them</i>

42
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,951
<i>Pearly white</i>

43
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,788
<i>Just a jackknife</i>

44
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>Has old Macheath, babe</i>

45
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:55,127
<i>And he keeps it out of sight</i>

46
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,919
<i>You know when that shark bites</i>

47
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,254
<i>With his teeth, babe</i>

48
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,054
<i>Scarlet billows</i>

49
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,933
<i>Start to spread</i>

50
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,428
<i>Fancy gloves, oh</i>

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,602
<i>Wears old Macheath, babe</i>

52
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,770
<i>So there's never</i>

53
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,147
<i>Never a trace of red</i>

54
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,106
<i>Now on the sidewalk</i>
<i>Uh-huh, uh-huh</i>

55
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,281
<i>Ooh, Sunday mornin', uh-huh</i>

56
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,869
<i>Lies a body</i>

57
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,117
<i>Just oozin' life</i>

58
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,001
<i>And someone's sneakin'</i>

59
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,962
<i>'Round the corner</i>

60
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,503
<i>Could that someone</i>

61
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,466
<i>Be Mack the Knife?</i>

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,338
<i>Now did ya hear about Louie Miller</i>

63
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,637
<i>He disappeared, babe</i>

64
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,805
<i>After drawin' out</i>

65
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,975
<i>All his hard-earned cash</i>

66
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,024
<i>And now Macheath spends</i>

67
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,019
<i>Just like a sailor</i>

68
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,992
<i>Could it be our boy's done</i>
<i>somethin' rash?</i>

69
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,659
<i>Ah, Jenny Diver</i>

70
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,031
<i>Hey, Suki Tawdry</i>

71
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,868
<i>Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya</i>

72
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,167
<i>And old Lucy Brown</i>

73
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,711
<i>Oh, the line forms</i>

74
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,043
<i>On the right, babe</i>

75
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:29,008
<i>Now that Mackie's</i>

76
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,556
<i>Back in town</i>

77
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,605
- What's this? Get this thing out of here.
- It's not my station.

78
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,899
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
- We're still hot on the right.

79
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:38,892
Watch it.

80
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,607
Oh, it's very exciting.
You know, my mother said that...

81
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,442
Hey, those are the questions.

82
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,027
Ah, he's got the questions there.

83
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:54,583
Like walking on the bottom of the sea,

84
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,750
as if I had drowned long ago.

85
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,963
- As if...
- Five minutes, Mr. Barry.

86
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,753
- We're ready, Mr. Barry.
- You ready, America?

87
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,675
Oh, thanks, Tim.

88
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,597
- All right, one minute.
- Move a little to your left.

89
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,966
Hey, video,
you done with the test patterns?

90
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,301
Camera one.

91
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,807
Okay, clear the floor, folks.

92
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,559
- Marty, you're still very hot.
- Light it up.

93
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,555
Lighting.

94
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,733
- Stand by. Thirty seconds.
- Give me his opening shots, please.

95
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,068
- Thirty seconds to air.
- I'm getting a glare on camera one.

96
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,314
You think you can adjust the barn door
on Jack's back light? Yeah, if you can.

97
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,568
Twenty seconds.

98
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,616
My light okay?
My nose doesn't look big?

99
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,786
- You look great, Jack.
- Last week I looked like a sun dial.

100
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,238
Jack, we're on countdown.

101
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,912
Coming to air in ten,
nine, eight, seven...

102
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,991
Stand by, timpani.
Stand by, opening film.

103
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,668
- Stand by, music. Stand by, announcer.
...six, five,

104
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,590
- four, three, two, one.
- Cue the timpani.

105
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,801
And fade up. Announce.

106
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,923
Geritol. America's #1 tonic.

125
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,738
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

126
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,198
Due to a series of ties, Herbert Stempel,
our 29-year-old ex-G.I. College student,

127
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,999
must play at $3,000 a point,

128
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,039
which means that
in a few brief minutes,

129
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,005
he can either win as much as $ 100,000,

130
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,047
the most money won on television
to date,

131
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,047
or lose everything he's won
in the last eight weeks.

132
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,342
You nervous?

133
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,215
It's only money.

134
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,596
Isolated in their soundproof studios,

135
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,394
neither player is aware
of the other's score.

136
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,689
I've been assured by our friends
at the Encyclopedia

137
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,688
that they've concocted some
real brain-breakers this week,

138
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,526
so we'll find out in the next 30 minutes

139
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,068
if the unstumpable
Herbert Stempel can be stumped.

140
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,193
Could I have the questions, please?

141
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,951
Thank you, gentlemen.

142
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,870
Remember, the questions on
<i>Twenty-One</i> are secured each week

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,867
in a Manhattan bank vault
till just before show time.

144
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,250
So right now, let's meet Herbert
Stempel and his challenger as Geritol,

145
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,298
America's #1 tonic,
presents <i>Twenty-One.</i>

146
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,802
Welcome back to the show, gentlemen.

147
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,430
Mr. Peloubet, a very cordial
welcome to you, sir.

148
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,302
How are you, Herb?
How's everything in Queens?

149
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,265
- Fine, Mr. Barry.
- It's a nervous strain in the family, I bet.

150
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,224
- How's your wife holding out?
- She's fine, thank you.

151
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,942
Thank you, Mr. Barry, for asking.

152
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,144
As you know, Herb, the questions

153
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,776
are graded for difficulty
by the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica...</i>

154
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,279
I might add that my wife
no longer suffers from tired blood,

155
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,242
now that I've got her on Geritol.

156
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,116
That's fine.
Graded on a scale from one...

157
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,740
I personally vouch that
it's a fine product.

158
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,742
I'm sure our sponsor
will be pleased to know that, Herb.

159
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,959
Now, to get on with the show...

160
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,583
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank Geritol

161
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,082
<i>for giving a poor ex-G. I.</i>
<i>This amazing opportunity</i>

162
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,585
<i>to realize his dream</i>
<i>of a college education.</i>

163
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,131
Now there's a face for radio.

164
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,676
<i>Dick Peloubet back again</i>
<i>from sunny Miami, Florida,</i>

165
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,851
<i>and Herb Stempel.</i>

166
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,770
- Yeah.
- Stempel is giving me a headache.

167
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,440
- Well, he sells Geritol.
<i>- Have you seen the ratings?</i>

168
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,527
- Well, they've evened out.
- I don't think he works anymore.

169
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,320
Stempel is an underdog.
You know, people root for that.

170
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,609
It's a New York thing.

171
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,198
Queens is not New York.

172
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,118
<i>Let's play</i> Twenty-One.

173
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,166
Mr. Kintner's office, please.

174
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,511
<i>Office of the President.</i>
<i>Could you hold, please?</i>

175
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,503
<i>Mr. Kintner's office.</i>

176
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,511
Once inside the isolation booth,
neither player can see the other,

177
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,553
nor can they hear anything

178
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,977
until I turn their studios on,
which I'm gonna do right now.

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,389
<i>All right, gentlemen?</i>

180
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,898
- He's not hurting sales, is he?
- He just doesn't think he works.

181
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,820
- Why?
- Look, I don't know.

182
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,739
I guess the sponsor wants a guy
on <i>Twenty-One</i>

183
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,817
who looks like he'd get a table at 21.

184
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,029
You just tell him I said Stempel
has an everyman quality.

185
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,206
You know that whole American
dream thing? You, too, can be rich?

186
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,000
- If the ratings stay high.
- Very funny.

187
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,080
I'm just passing it along, sir.

188
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,713
Every schoolboy knows about
the midnight ride of Paul Revere.

189
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:03,050
For 11 points, how many lanterns
were hung in the Old North Church?

190
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,011
Who rode with Paul Revere?
Who lent him his horse?

191
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,062
Was it a mare or a stallion?

192
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,606
<i>And what was the horse's name?</i>

193
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,564
<i>- Stand by, Joe, on Herbie.</i>
- Kill the air.

194
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,690
Tommy, air off.

195
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,158
Uh...

196
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,041
<i>A little tighter. Kelly, put the sign up.</i>

197
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,541
Control booth. Uh, yeah, hold on, sir.

198
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,505
Dan, it's for you. It's Kintner.

199
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,795
Would you mind, Mr. Barry,
could I take the third part last?

200
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,509
<i>That's fine.</i>

201
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,720
The code was, uh,
"One if by land, two if by sea."

202
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,564
<i>Therefore, it would have to be</i>
<i>two lanterns in the Old North Church.</i>

203
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,060
<i>That's right. And the second part.</i>
<i>Who rode with him?</i>

204
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,613
- Dawes and Prescott.
<i>- Dawes and Prescott.</i>

205
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,786
What these books have conclusively
proven is that the difference

206
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,496
between men and women
is exactly 38 pages.

207
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,573
Can I quote you, Mark?

208
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,999
Not before I quote me.

209
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,576
His own quotes
are his greatest pleasure.

210
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,457
Did you hear the market dropped
30 points today?

211
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,624
There's a rumor Eisenhower died.

212
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,963
How would they tell?

213
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,336
Oh, please, don't get Dorothy
started on politics.

214
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,339
- There'll be a raid.
- Good night.

215
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,513
Good night, Dorothy. Sorry I'm late.
It's impossible out there.

216
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,309
- You can't get a cab without a dragnet.
- Eisenhower died.

217
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,635
- What?
- Professor Van Doren,

218
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,477
I took your course at Columbia,

219
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,847
Hawthorne, Original Sin
and the American Experience.

220
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,807
- Nixon is president?
- Well, as silly as it sounds,

221
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,934
it changed my life.

222
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,776
Was it the Hawthorne or the sin?

223
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,943
Perhaps you'd like to meet my son,
the unmarried Van Doren.

224
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,366
- Oh, where is Charlie?
<i>- You're right again, Herb.</i>

225
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,945
<i>You got the first two parts correct.</i>
<i>Just three more for 11 points.</i>

226
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,117
Excuse me. Are you the son?

227
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,868
- I'm Charlie. Pleasure.
- Elizabeth. The pleasure's all mine.

228
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,378
<i>It was a mare, Mr. Barry.</i>

229
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,497
How did he know that?

230
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,294
Oh, there you are.

231
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,468
We're making our getaway, Charlie,
if you want a ride.

232
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,679
Have you ever watched one
of these quiz shows, Dad?

233
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,515
<i>The $64,000 Question</i> or <i>Twenty-One?</i>

234
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:11,306
For $64,000, I hope they ask you
the meaning of life.

235
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:16,399
<i>Okay, Herb, finally: Name the man</i>
<i>who loaned Paul Revere his horse</i>

236
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,483
<i>for that fateful midnight ride.</i>

237
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,436
<i>The horse. Who loaned him the horse?</i>

238
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,031
Okay, Herb, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask for your answer.

239
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,197
Yes, Mr. Barry.

240
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,991
Look, just give him
what he wants.

241
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,826
I don't want to talk
to these agency guys.

242
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,320
So what do you want me to do,
Mr. Kintner?

243
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,202
You're a producer, Dan. Produce.

244
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,325
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>more time, Herb?</i>

245
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,793
- Right.
- <i>If I may.</i>

246
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,208
Herbie's dead.

247
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,677
Larkin? Deacon John Larkin?

248
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,263
That's correct for 11 points!

249
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,354
All right, Herb, take a deep breath
and relax, will you?

250
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,393
And we'll get back to the game
after this word from our sponsor.

251
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,778
Now, friends, I was just wondering,
what kind of a day did you have today?

252
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,735
Did you greet the sunrise
with plenty of vim, vigor and vitality,

253
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,079
only to feel the wind go out
of your sails just after lunchtime?

254
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,248
Do you find you're not having
as much fun as you used to?

255
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,539
This beats the subway,
huh, Mr. Stempel?

256
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,665
You said it.

257
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,556
- Hooray!
- Hey, Herbie!

258
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,598
You were the greatest tonight, Herbie!

259
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,939
Great, Einstein!

260
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,934
Hey, the audience
really loves you!

261
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,731
Herbie, you remember me when!

262
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,813
Herbie! I remember you when!

263
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,070
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hey, Herbie, what color was she?

264
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,743
You looked so good
on TV tonight, Herbie!

265
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,745
You should have gone for 11
on the movies, Herbie.

266
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,615
You should win $ 100,000.

267
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,491
Hey, you were really
cookin' tonight, Stempel.

268
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,789
- Of course I watched it.
- <i>You didn't go to the show?</i>

269
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,497
The genius is home.
The rich genius is home.

270
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,299
I watched it on television
like everybody else.

271
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,421
<i>Would you tell him that...</i>

272
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,093
You were great tonight, Herb.

273
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,422
Come on. I wanna dance.
Dance with me.

274
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,094
<i>Looking for the light</i>

275
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,841
<i>Would you ask him for me,</i>
<i>please, right now?</i>

276
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,925
<i>Of a new love</i>

277
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,013
Mother wants to know why
you only went for 8 on the movies.

278
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,473
Because my real expertise
is pain-in-the-ass in-laws.

279
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,521
- Now would you get off the phone?
- I'm not gonna start with this.

280
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,773
<i>Tell him that everybody</i>
<i>is watching that show.</i>

281
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,274
Steve Allen is gettin' a busy signal

282
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,822
because my mother-in-law
won't shut up.

283
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,274
- Look, Ma, I got...
<i>...drops dead,</i>

284
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,866
<i>- and I don't want to have to deal with it.</i>
- I gotta go.

285
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,284
- All right. Goodbye.
<i>- Call me before you go to bed.</i>

286
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,494
<i>That's all I'm sayin'.</i>

287
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,699
What are you doin'? My father
paid good money for this suit.

288
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,204
He wore it to his own funeral.

289
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,377
You make it sound like
it was the suit that killed him.

290
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,546
You wanna know why Enright
makes me wear that suit?

291
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,169
Because it makes me
look like a schmuck.

292
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,341
Yeah, well, stop actin'
like a schmuck then.

293
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,837
You don't get it, do you? I go out
on the street, and everybody knows me.

294
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:55,642
Me. Herb Stempel. And they love me for
the same reason they used to hate me.

295
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,636
Because I'm the guy
who knows everything.

296
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:01,356
You should worship the ground I walk
on, what my family's done for you.

297
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,691
You wanna be worshiped?
Go to India and moo.

298
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,986
Without my family, you'd be
on that show in your underwear.

299
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,856
Things are gonna change
around here, boy.

300
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,324
What does that mean,
everything's gonna change?

301
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,159
You think I should
get my teeth capped?

302
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,540
What's gonna change, Herbert?

303
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,751
Everything's gonna change.

304
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,087
For us.

305
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,167
Hey, what the hell were you thinking?

306
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,591
Toby, that box is the biggest thing

307
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,549
since Gutenberg
invented the printing press,

308
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,383
and I'm the biggest thing on it.

309
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,304
We don't need your mother
and her money anymore.

310
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,516
Don't you wanna tell her where
to get off after 28 years?

311
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,819
Now would you please

312
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,572
dance with me?

313
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,947
<i>Dancing in the dark</i>

314
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,195
<i>Until the tune ends</i>

315
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,575
<i>We're dancing in the dark</i>

316
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,035
<i>And it soon ends</i>

317
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,246
<i>We're waltzing</i>

318
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:11,422
<i>In the wonder</i>
<i>of why we're here...</i>

319
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,136
Because of a disagreement
with his commanding general,

320
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,589
Ulysses S. Grant was virtually placed
under arrest

321
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,559
for a brief time early in 1862.

322
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,144
Who was the commanding general
of the Union Army at that time?

323
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,940
Oh, I know that. Uh, Halleck.
General H.W. Halleck.

324
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,558
That's correct.

325
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,481
Who was Sebastian Cabot
and what country

326
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,233
- was he in the service of?
- Hey, Terry.

327
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,070
He was an explorer from Spain.

328
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,776
That's correct.

329
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,243
Who founded the former hub
of the Byzantine Empire...

330
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,657
Who's that guy in the corner?

331
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,740
- Constantinople?
- Constantine the First.

332
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,000
Charles Van Doren.

333
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,294
Charles Van Doren?
Like "Van Doren" Van Doren?

334
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,044
- He wants to be on <i>Tic-Tac-Dough?</i>
- I guess so.

335
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,086
- Meriwether Lewis.
- That's it.

336
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,054
Who was the editor
of the socialist paper...

337
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,674
Oh, this is the guy. This is the guy.

338
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,976
<i>I got the guy</i>
<i>I got the guy</i>

339
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,935
I got the guy!

340
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,477
I got the guy.

341
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,476
So I turned to astrophysics,
but of course, as you know,

342
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,859
all the great physicists were
great before the age of 25.

343
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,815
It just wasn't in the cards.

344
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,494
So I went to Paris
and wrote my novel about a patricide.

345
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,657
What?

346
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,996
A boy who kills his father.

347
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,829
My dad liked it quite a lot, actually,

348
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,128
although you could fill Yankee Stadium
with the world's mediocre novelists.

349
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,126
And your father is Carl Van Doren.

350
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,966
My uncle. My father
is Mark Van Doren, the poet.

351
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,342
He also teaches... I mean,
I also teach at Columbia. Literature.

352
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,716
- Same as Dad.
- Oh, same as Dad, huh? That's nice.

353
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,676
Could I ask you
a personal question, Professor?

354
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,807
Actually, I'm not a professor yet.
I'm just an instructor.

355
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,896
How much do they pay instructors
up at Columbia?

356
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,849
Eighty-six dollars a week.

357
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,809
You have any idea how much
Bozo the Clown makes?

358
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,145
Well, we can't all be Bozo the Clown.

359
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,856
No, no, not to question
your choice of profession. Not at all.

360
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,075
I'm questioning the values of a society
that pays somebody like you...

361
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,527
- What was it?
- Eighty-six dollars a week.

362
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,580
Eighty-six dollars a week. You plan
on raising a family, right, Professor?

363
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,873
- Yes, I hope to, very much.
- Can you imagine

364
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,200
raising a family on 86 dollars a week?

365
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,371
Eighty-six dollars a week.

366
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,041
And meanwhile, look at the crisis
of education in this country.

367
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,790
Well, yes, I agree.
It's a national problem.

368
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,508
So I understand you came down
to try out for <i>Tic-Tac-Dough.</i>

369
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,508
Well, my friends tell me I have
a good mind for this sort of thing.

370
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,714
They coaxed me...

371
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,340
How'd you like to be on <i>Twenty-One?</i>

372
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,681
<i>- Twenty-One?</i>
- Dan produces both shows.

373
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,013
You're young, you're clean-cut,
you're from a prominent family.

374
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,266
Kids would run to do their homework
to be like Charles Van Doren.

375
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,442
- What about Herbert Stempel?
- What about him?

376
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,110
Herb? Oh, I love him.

377
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,562
- People don't like him.
- Well, we love Herb.

378
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,443
- Kids don't look up to him.
- If you were a kid,

379
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,071
would you want to be an annoying
Jewish guy with a sidewall haircut?

380
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,950
- Well, I wanted to be Joe DiMaggio.
- Oh, yeah? Me, too.

381
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,077
- Especially after he signed for 100,000.
- Yeah, Al...

382
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,126
But you see, that's what this country
needs, is an intellectual Joe DiMaggio,

383
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,123
with the women and the money
and all of it,

384
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,920
but from his brain
instead of a bat and ball.

385
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,590
- Dan.
- I know. You're probably right.

386
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,169
Yeah, boy.
What are we gonna do here?

387
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,514
Well, I could take a whack at it.

388
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:13,399
Yeah, see, the problem, Professor, is
the old college try ain't gonna do it.

389
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,228
And you've seen Stempel.
The guy's unbeatable.

390
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,779
I have to admit <i>Tic-Tac-Dough</i>
seemed more feasible.

391
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,738
What if we were to put you
on the show...

392
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,236
Put you on <i>Twenty-One</i> and ask
you questions that you know.

393
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:30,116
Say, the questions that he answered
correctly on the test this morning.

394
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,747
- I don't follow you.
- Just thinkin' out loud.

395
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,497
I thought the questions
were in a bank vault.

396
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,923
- In a way, they are.
- You wanna win, don't you?

397
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,340
Well, I think I'd really rather
try to beat him honestly.

398
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,419
What's dishonest?

399
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,346
When Gregory Peck parachutes
behind enemy lines,

400
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,764
do you think that's really Gregory Peck?

401
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,467
That book that Eisenhower wrote?
A ghostwriter wrote it. Nobody cares.

402
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,018
It's not like we'd be
giving you the answers.

403
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,937
Just 'cause we know you know,
you still know.

404
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,102
Right. It's not like you're putting me
on the show, or Al,

405
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,184
and pretending to be
some sort of intellectual.

406
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,940
You have put in years of study
and erudition.

407
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,195
I mean, I'm just trying to imagine
what Kant would make of this.

408
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,034
I don't think he'd have a problem with it.

409
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,659
Think about what this could mean
for the cause of education.

410
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,661
Forty million people
will watch you on <i>Twenty-One.</i>

411
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,456
It's not like anybody
has to know. Just us three.

412
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,134
It just doesn't seem right.

413
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,717
I'd have to say no.

414
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,603
Just an idea.

415
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,641
Was that part of the test?

416
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,203
- So we're okay.
- You're gonna give it a try.

417
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:54,325
Well, I just want to make sure
it'll be, you know, not

418
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,247
the way we discussed it before?

419
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,705
- No. So pure, it floats.
- Not at all.

420
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,753
Okay? So we'll see you
Monday night then.

421
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,879
You'll come by
and see how the show works.

422
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,050
Great.

423
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,760
- All right. And we'll look forward to that.
- Monday night.

424
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,429
- N ice meeting you.
- Okay. Goodbye.

425
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,507
- Take care.
- Bye-bye.

426
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,221
- Reservations are at 9:00.
- Thanks. All right.

427
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,935
Boys.

428
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,516
- H i, Jack.
- H i, Jack.

429
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,853
- Who's that?
- That's Charles Van Doren.

430
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,447
- As in "Van Doren" Van Doren?
- Van Doren. Yes.

431
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,446
He wants to be on <i>Tic-Tac-Dough.</i>

432
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,448
Now, why would a guy like that
want to be on a quiz show?

433
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,746
<i>Richard Goodwin. I'm an investigator.</i>

434
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:40,746
<i>An investigator.</i>

435
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,206
Richard Goodwin
with the Subcommittee

436
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,087
on Legislative Oversight.

437
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,635
I'm calling because the rate schedules
for the Baltimore and Ohio

438
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,428
for the first four months of 1954

439
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,757
seem to be missing
from the documents you just sent me.

440
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,263
Oh, go get 'em, Dickie.
They're sweatin' now.

441
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,390
Do they know you were first in
your class at Harvard Law School?

442
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,603
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

443
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,892
I was first in my class
at Harvard Law School.

444
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,562
- There we go. What have you got?
- Forty-three seconds.

445
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,439
- Not bad.
- Railroad regulation.

446
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,607
Now that's political dynamite
he's playing with.

447
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,401
Oh, just an oversight.

448
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,608
- We're an oversight committee.
- Right.

449
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,567
The end of next week.
That'll be just fine.

450
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,574
And I'll send you a little
helpful reminder, okay?

451
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,906
You'll notice it 'cause it'll look
very much like a subpoena.

452
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:15,952
Oh!

453
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,453
Thank you.

454
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,410
You know, Dick, you stick with this...
I don't know.

455
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,501
Ten, fifteen years,

456
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,080
you could bring the Interstate
Commerce Commission to its knees.

457
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,133
Of course, by then,
there may not be railroads.

458
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,965
You'll still be sittin' right there, too, Alex.

459
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,259
- He's so sensitive.
- Truce.

460
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,807
<i>Herb, you got ten points.</i>

461
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,928
<i>The category is "Explorers."</i>
<i>How many you want to try for?</i>

462
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,144
- <i>I'll try for 11 points, Mr. Barry.</i>
- Hello!

463
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,517
<i>Gonna go all the way, huh?</i>
<i>All right.</i>

464
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,273
<i>I'm gonna name four spots</i>
<i>on the globe.</i>

465
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,522
<i>You name the explorer</i>
<i>who discovered them.</i>

466
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,779
<i>- First, Newfoundland.</i>
- John Cabot.

467
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,328
Hi. I see you're really churning out
the chapters today.

468
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,038
Go away. No cigar in the bedroom.

469
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,866
<i>- That's correct.</i>
- Out.

470
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,371
<i>The Cape of Good Hope.</i>

471
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,044
No cigar in the bedroom.
We allow a television in the bedroom,

472
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,293
but no cigar in the bedroom.

473
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,508
- This...
- <i>Bartolomeu Dias.</i>

474
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,881
<i>- He originally called it...</i>
<i>- You're right, Herb.</i>

475
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,556
So today, chairman calls me aside.

476
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,633
My big break, right?

477
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,013
He asks me to write him a speech

478
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,813
to deliver to the Kiwanis Club
of Arkadelphia, Arkansas.

479
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,812
You're good at that.
Gee, do we get to go there?

480
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,653
Yeah. Just like to know
where the challenge is.

481
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,482
You know? I feel like a race horse
whose gate won't open.

482
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,325
You didn't want the Wall Street job.

483
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,030
Yeah, I know.
Well, money isn't everything.

484
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,999
I'm not the one who came home
with the Chrysler catalog.

485
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,577
<i>Give me the name of the explorer</i>
<i>who discovered Mozambique.</i>

486
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,335
- Vasco da Gama.
- Vasco da Gama.

487
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,052
- <i>Well...</i>
- Maybe I should get on a quiz show.

488
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,845
At least I could get in my own bedroom.

489
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,841
It's just a job, Dick. It's not sex.

490
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,016
<i>Vasco da Gama?</i>

491
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,389
- Great show, Herbie.
- Terrific show. I really think so.

492
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,016
- Jack, wasn't Herb terrific tonight?
- Can't you see I'm busy, Dan?

493
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,897
- Okay.
- Oh, Herb, I'd like you to meet

494
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,861
next week's challenger,
Charles Van Doren.

495
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:14,283
Hello. I'm scared of you.
Boy, oh, boy, let me tell you.

496
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,860
Scared of me?

497
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,664
- More wine, Herb?
- Thank you, Dan. Why not?

498
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,716
You've earned it. How's that steak?

499
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,388
Nothing like a fine piece of meat.

500
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,217
You know, Herb, it's a hell of a thing.
I'm lookin' at the thing today.

501
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,303
- You know, the Trendex rating?
- Yeah?

502
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,390
Well, it's the damndest thing,
but you've plateaued.

503
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,276
Plateaued? What kind of word is that?

504
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,228
- What, plateaued?
- Plateaued.

505
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,405
Plateaued? Well, it's like you...

506
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,740
You mean people
don't like me anymore?

507
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,613
No, no, no, it's not you per se.

508
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,569
- It's just... No, it's...
- Maybe I should get my teeth capped.

509
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,653
It's the nature of the show.

510
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,739
They've already seen you win,
and they want something new.

511
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,913
So what are you saying?
You think they want me to lose?

512
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,086
Well, don't you think that's natural?

513
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,790
Joe Louis was the champ for 12 years.
Nobody ever wanted Joe Louis to lose.

514
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,216
- Think about the cause of education.
- The cause of education?

515
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,504
I waited 29 years for this.

516
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,806
Now I'm supposed to take a dive
for the cause of education?

517
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,805
I didn't say take a dive.
Now I'm askin' you for your help.

518
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,137
Fine. Just let me play it honestly.

519
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,597
Will you keep your voice down?

520
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,353
Go ahead. Give me a number.
Give me a number.

521
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,268
Excuse me, sir.
Give me a number, a random number.

522
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,819
I don't know. Twenty-three?

523
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,988
Beethoven was 23 when he
composed his first piano sonata.

524
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,990
In 1923, Jack Bentley set the record
for average by a pitcher, batting.427.

525
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,365
There are 23 chromosomes

526
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,822
- in the human egg.
- Herb...

527
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,950
Also, the human sperm. Twenty-third
president, Benjamin Harrison.

528
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,701
Asian countries along
the 23rd parallel...

529
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,377
Look, don't start believing
your own bullshit, all right?

530
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,625
You wouldn't know the name of
Paul Revere's horse

531
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,796
if he took a crap on your lawn.

532
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,000
- She.
- What?

533
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,678
- It was a mare, remember?
- Look, you lose when I tell you to lose.

534
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,346
- But why now?
- It's an arrangement.

535
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,220
- It's always been an arrangement.
- But if you told me to lose before,

536
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,802
if you told me to lose right from
the beginning, that I'd understand.

537
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,351
That'd be the story of my life.
But why now? What did I do?

538
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,355
Look at the big picture. It's not like
television is gonna go away, you know.

539
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,984
- I mean, think about the future.
- You mean like a panel show?

540
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,525
Check. Look, I'm gonna do
what I can do, Herb.

541
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,157
But meanwhile, maybe you could use
somebody to talk to.

542
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,702
I'm gonna give you the name
of my analyst. Just send me the bills.

543
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,166
You know, I could be terrific
on one of those panel shows.

544
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,333
Here you go, sir.

545
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,878
Witty, off-the-cuff.
A Bill Cullen sort of thing.

546
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,206
Now the last category is movies.

547
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,879
We're gonna ask you
what won the Academy Award

548
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,880
for Best Picture in 1955.

549
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,254
You don't know it.
You answer <i>On The Waterfront.</i>

550
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,550
Oh, no. Oh, no. Don't... Don't do that.

551
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,724
Not <i>Marty.</i> I saw <i>Marty</i> three times.

552
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,598
The Best Picture from two years ago
and I don't know it?

553
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,853
Someone of your intellect,
and it's such a simple question.

554
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,903
- Don't you see the drama of that?
- Drama?

555
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,355
Herb, don't do this to yourself.

556
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,109
Please, let me lose on
a physics question, not <i>Marty,</i> Dan.

557
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,029
Don't do this to me. It's too humiliating.

558
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,208
For 70 grand, Herb, you can afford
to be humiliated.

559
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,930
Who was the captain of the <i>Mayflower?</i>

560
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,049
Christopher Jones.

561
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,975
- What year?
- 1620.

562
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,223
<i>Here's Mr. Moto!</i>

563
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,396
<i>And we'll return to Mr. Moto after this.</i>

564
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,316
<i>Will Herbert Stempel</i>
<i>become the first man</i>

565
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,315
<i>to win over $ 100,000 on television?</i>

566
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,273
No, Herbert Stempel is not
going to win over $ 100,000.

567
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,403
Herbert Stempel
is going to take a dive!

568
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,118
Dad, the quiz is tomorrow.
If you're gonna talk to the TV...

569
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,784
All right, big shot. So who bought
Manhattan Island from the Indians?

570
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,780
Peter Minuit.

571
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,616
- What year?
- 1626.

572
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,576
- How much?
- Twenty-four dollars.

573
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,413
<i>...this week on Twenty-One.</i>

574
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,256
<i>- Now back to our program.</i>
- This week on <i>Twenty-One,</i>

575
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,797
watch Herb Stempel be fed
to the Columbia Lions.

576
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:05,798
Watch Charles Van Doren eat his
first kosher meal on <i>Twenty-One.</i>

577
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:09,306
What are you doing?
Why aren't you dressed?

578
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,476
The child has to learn.

579
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,314
The child has to learn the depths
that humanity can sink to.

580
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,151
The tribes of
the Iroquois League, Mohawks,

581
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,860
- Cayugas, Oneidas...
- Twenty-four bucks for Manhattan.

582
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,312
First the Indians, then us.

583
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,191
- What's eatin' you?
- You know why they call them Indians?

584
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,320
Because Columbus

585
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,363
- thought he was in India.
- Mohawks, Cayugas...

586
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,945
They're Indians because
some white guy got lost.

587
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,119
You're gonna give him your ulcer.
Let him grow up with his own ulcer.

588
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,664
- He wouldn't let me practice my drums.
- Who won Best Picture for 1955?

589
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,620
- <i>Marty.</i>
- Thank you.

590
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,457
- Well, what's the problem?
- Lester, do me a favor.

591
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,801
Go in your bedroom, do your homework,
all right? Hey, hey!

592
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,295
With your books.

593
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,056
Homework with your books.

594
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,564
- They want me to take a dive.
- What?

595
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:00,353
They're going to ask me
what won the Best Picture for 1955,

596
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,356
and I have to answer
<i>On The Waterfront.</i>

597
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,988
They have to <i>utz</i> me with a question
any child knows.

598
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,532
How can they do that? I thought
the questions were in a bank vault.

599
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,500
They just put me in an isolation booth
and pump cyanide into it.

600
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,578
Herbie, they can't do that.

601
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,880
- How can they do that?
- Well, obviously, Toby,

602
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,000
this particular question
isn't in the bank vault.

603
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,170
- Why?
- How the hell do I know why?

604
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,554
Well, then the hell with them.
Just answer <i>Marty</i> then.

605
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:35,725
- I already agreed.
- Well, screw them.

606
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,475
Let them ask you a question you
really don't know. Good luck.

607
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:47,362
You're Herbert Stempel.
What are they gonna do to you? Huh?

608
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:52,287
<i>Judo chop into</i>
<i>the throat. Once again, it's a judo chop.</i>

609
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,739
You're right. What could they do to me?

610
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,540
Yeah.

611
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,413
- Screw 'em.
- Yeah.

612
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,877
Remember, call him "Jack"
as often as possible.

613
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,543
Jack.

614
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,091
Fifteen seconds.

615
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,259
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

616
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,428
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

617
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,519
- <i>Five.</i>
- Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

618
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,222
- Watch your headroom.
- Coming to air in ten, nine,

619
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,815
- eight, seven...
- I'm Jack Barry.

620
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,233
...six, five...
- Steady, one.

621
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,233
...four, three...
- Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

622
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,277
...two, one.
- Fade up. Cue up.

623
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,946
Good evening. I'm Jack Barry.

624
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,653
<i>So let's meet our</i>

<i>And returning with $69, 500,</i>

628

<i>...Mr. Herbert Stempel.</i>

630
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,008
- Think that's his son?
- <i>Are you related in any way</i>

631
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,255
<i>to Mark Van Doren</i>
<i>of Columbia University...</i>

632
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,423
I don't know. I guess so.

00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,470
<i>...The famous poet and author?</i>
<i>- Yes, he's my father.</i>

<i>He is your father.</i>

<i>Yes, both he and my uncle Carl</i>

638
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,104
<i>Okay, Herb, you know</i>
<i>something about Mr. Van Doren.</i>

639
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:07,859
<i>You have $69, 500. Do you want to take</i>

640
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,940

641
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,496
<i>It's a tough decision, I know.</i>

642
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,205

<i>- I'll take a chance.</i>

643
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,207
<i>You will take a chance. All right,</i>
<i>then, here we go, gentlemen.</i>

644
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,665
You sure Herbie's on board with this?

645
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,796
Can I take the third part last?

646
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:34,055
I guess that Atahualpa was the leader
of the Incas at the time of the conquest.

647
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,975
- Correct.
- Wouldn't that be William Allen White?

648
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,640
- That's correct.
- I'd like to take the third part last.

649
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,186
His fourth wife was Anne of Cleves.

650
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,483
He divorced Catherine of Aragon.

651
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,154
- He divorced her.
- He beheaded Anne Boleyn.

652
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,027
Well, they all died.

653
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:54,451
<i>Herb Stempel leads at this point</i>
<i>by 18 to 10.</i>

654
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,995
<i>- Herb?</i>
<i>- Yes, Mr. Barry?</i>

655
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,741
The category is "Movies."
How many points you want to try for?

656
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,873
I'll try for three. Three points.

657
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,420
<i>Which motion picture</i>
<i>won the Academy Award for 1955?</i>

658
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,094
<i>Marty.</i>

659
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,898
Best Picture.

660
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,530
<i>Marty.</i>

661
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,149
<i>Best Picture.</i>

662
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,702
<i>Marty.</i>

663
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,201
He doesn't know it?

664
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,048
<i>All right, Herb,</i>
<i>I'll tell you when your time is up.</i>

665
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,717
I don't remember. I don't remember.

666
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,388
<i>Are you sure you wouldn't want</i>
<i>to guess at it, Herb?</i>

667
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,474
<i>- Otherwise, I'll have to call it wrong.</i>
<i>- Wait.</i>

668
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,309
<i>Marty.</i>

669
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,029
<i>Your time is up, Herb.</i>
<i>I'll need your answer.</i>

670
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,201
Best Picture...

671
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,741
...of 1955...

672
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,325
<i>On The Waterfront?</i>

673
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,084
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>The answer is</i> Marty.

674
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,926
Marty. <i>It was</i> Marty
<i>that won the Academy Award</i>

675
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,892
<i>for Best Picture in 1955.</i>

676
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,101
<i>- Marty was Ernest Borgnine.</i>
- Geez, what an easy question.

677
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,475
<i>The Academy Award for 1955.</i>
<i>You lose three points.</i>

678
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,482
<i>You go back down to 15.</i>
<i>Better luck on the next round.</i>

679
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,232
<i>And now for you, Professor,</i>
<i>the category is...</i>

680
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,150
Civil War.

681
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,448
How many points you want
to try for, from 1 to 11?

682
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,827
Civil War. That's a...
That's an awful big subject.

683
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,791
Well, here goes nothing.
I'll... I'll try for 11.

684
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,833
<i>Eleven points will bring you to 21,</i>
<i>and you will be our new champion!</i>

685
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,047
Because of a disagreement
with his commanding general,

686
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,550
Ulysses S. Grant was virtually
placed under arrest

687
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,804
for a brief time early in 1862.

688
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:26,895
Who was the commanding general
of the Union Army at that time?

689
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,853
<i>Tough question.</i>

690
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,234
It's just so oddly familiar.

691
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,373
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>some more time?</i>

692
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,256
- Whatever you can spare.
<i>- All right.</i>

693
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,719
Do you know the name?

694
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,688
Yes, I know his name. Halleck.
General H.W. Halleck.

695
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:17,859
<i>You are our new</i>
<i>champion for $20,000!</i>

696
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,528
<i>Come on out, Herb.</i>
<i>Come on out, Professor.</i>

697
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,781
<i>Wasn't that somethin', folks? Huh?</i>

698
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,209
<i>You feelin' all right?</i>

699
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:34,788
Very good. Perhaps we can get
an ice pack out here for the professor.

700
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,874
I suspect his gray matter is red-hot.

701
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,376
I wonder if he's married.

702
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,221
<i>Our congratulations for a wonderful</i>
<i>victory. Professor Charles Van Doren.</i>

703
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:47,058
I am constantly amazed at the facts
these guys have at their fingertips.

704
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,644
- Tough questions tonight.
- Yeah. Oh, well, not really.

705
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,223
Wow, you were fantastic. Hey, you
better unlist your phone number.

706
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,316
Can you believe the pressure?
Look at him, he's soakin' wet.

707
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,065
- Is this guy a natural or what? Jesus!
- He's a natural.

708
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,438
Do you think he's involved
with anyone?

709
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,567
I don't know.

710
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,277
I'm gonna miss ya, Herb. You know,
I'm really gonna miss this guy.

711
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,243
Hey, Dan, listen,
that guy is really terrific.

712
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,737
We could easily beat out
<i>I Love Lucy</i> with him.

713
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,322
I know we can.

714
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,248
Let's get a photo here.
Oh, George. Here we go.

715
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:15,041
<i>Charles Van Doren. Miles Bronfman,</i>
<i>an executive here at the network.</i>

716
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,663
Oh, there we go.

717
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,248
So what do you think, Charlie?
You excited?

718
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,250
- Professor, can I interrupt you?
- Charlie, I just wanted to...

719
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,297
My son was in your father's class.

720
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,754
- Oh, really?
- Says he's a saint.

721
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,427
Charlie, I want you to meet
Bill Henderson. He promotes the show.

722
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,349
- Congratulations. Sensational.
- Thank you.

723
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,926
Now we have a clean-cut intellectual

724
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,929
instead of a freak
with a sponge memory.

725
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,601
See you next week, Charlie.

726
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,519
I don't even want to think about that.
I was so nervous.

727
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,441
Dan! Dan!

728
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,275
So pure, it floats? Hmm?

729
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,648
Are you kidding? It was great.

730
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,109
Go home and have a martini.
We'll talk in the morning.

731
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,203
Uh, I'm gonna take the stairs.

732
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,873
- How did you know he'd go for it?
- What would you do?

733
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,464
Meanwhile, it's okay
if you know the answer.

734
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,342
Yeah, so it's... My God, it's not like
I haven't worked hard.

735
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,300
I deserve $20,000
as much as anybody.

736
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,350
My God! $20,000.

737
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:21,569
The highest navigable lake
in the world is,

738
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,318
- Lake Titicaca.
- Lake Titicaca.

739
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,817
- That'd have to be Lake Titicaca.
- Correct for ten points!

740
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,531
Michel Montaigne. Around his neck,

741
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,493
Montaigne wore a medallion
which read, "What do I know?"

742
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,870
Hello. This is Herb Stempel
calling for Mr. Enright.

743
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,497
<i>I'm terribly sorry. He's not in.</i>

744
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,420
<i>Our current reigning champion,</i>
<i>from New York, New York,</i>

745
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,342
<i>Mr. Charles Van Doren.</i>

746
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,514
<i>... twenty-four hours,</i>
<i>Geritol liquid, or now, in new...</i>

747
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,186
It's the only town house
available in the Village.

748
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,480
I'll take it.

749
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,933
<i>Will do. It's just that</i>
<i>he's out of the office right now...</i>

750
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,393
This is Herb Stempel.

751
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,695
This is about the 17th time
I've called.

752
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,905
I guess William Pitt, the Elder.

753
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,194
You have 21!

754
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,570
Come to me, Charlie. Good. Smile.
Hold the bag right there.

755
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,201
Hold it right there. Good.

756
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,748
<i>Here, Professor Van Doren turns in</i>

757
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,458
<i>the evidence of his amazing popularity,</i>

758
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,207
<i>thousands of letters a week</i>
<i>for the egghead turned national hero.</i>

759
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,380
<i>Winnings to date, $50,000!</i>

760
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,209
<i>Hey, Charlie! The check's in the mail.</i>

761
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,211
- Is Mr. Enright in?
<i>- I'm sorry. He's not right now.</i>

762
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,803
This is Herb Stempel. You tell him that

763
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,630
he promised that
he would call me back,

764
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,716
and if he doesn't,
something is going to happen.

765
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,926
- Do you understand that?
<i>- I understand.</i>

766
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,976
That's right. Okay, bye.

767
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,899
You just tell Mr. Enright
that if he doesn't want to talk to me,

768
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,651
maybe the district attorney
would like to talk to me.

769
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,232
If he wants to play hardball,
I'll play hardball.

770
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,407
<i>Very well.</i>

771
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,282
- Good morning, Mr. Van Doren.
- Hello.

772
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,469
<i>And returning with $83,000,</i>

773
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,965
<i>our champion, after seven weeks,</i>
<i>Charles Van Doren.</i>

774
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,642
<i>Welcome to</i> Twenty-One, <i>gentlemen.</i>

775
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,103
- <i>Evening, Jack.</i>
<i>- Charlie...</i>

776
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,104
Gentlemen, please.

777
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:32,196
It was a totally humiliating experience.
All my friends knew that I loved <i>Marty.</i>

778
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,198
It's one of my favorite films.

779
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,746
I saw it three times.
It's about a boy in the Bronx...

780
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,127
Mr. Enright will see you now.

781
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,634
Have a seat, Herb.

782
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,473
Thanks for comin' up.

783
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,846
I feel we have some unfinished
business we need to hash out.

784
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,148
I have some unfinished
business with you, too.

785
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,692
This whole thing with the grand jury
and the things you said,

786
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,145
well, they hurt me.

787
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,902
I can't tell you how...
Well, they hurt me deeply.

788
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,156
- I told the truth.
- There you go again.

789
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,828
You promised me, Dan.
You promised that you'd help me out.

790
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,744
Don't you think that I want to
help you more than I already have?

791
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,541
But the point is,
you've made it impossible.

792
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,664
Look, you want me to apologize?

793
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,747
- I want you to sign this statement.
- I apologize.

794
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,502
What kind of statement?

795
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,004
It clears me and the show
of any wrongdoing.

796
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,175
- What about the panel show?
- See? That's a perfect example.

797
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,509
I told you I'd do what I could,
and I did. I put your name on a list.

798
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,890
You put me on a list? That's it?

799
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,772
N BC owns our company.
Everything goes through them.

800
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,568
N BC bought your company
for two million bucks. What about me?

801
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,529
People watched me on that show.
Look. Look. Look at this.

802
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,356
- Oh, Herb, don't start...
- "He has become a friend

803
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,199
"in over 50 million homes,

804
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,866
"whose weekly visits the whole family
eagerly anticipates."

805
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,411
- I was a friend, too, in 50 million homes.
- Look, what can I tell you, Herb?

806
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,784
- Life is unfair.
- Life is unfair to me.

807
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,086
Life's not unfair to Charles Van Doren.

808
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,038
Remember how he snubbed me
after the show?

809
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,122
There'll be other shows.

810
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,381
What other shows?
I need the money, Dan.

811
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,755
What?
How could you need the money?

812
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,716
It's gone. I mean it's invested.
It's tied up. It's...

813
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,219
- Well, can't you talk to your broker?
- He's not a broker.

814
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,305
He's more of a bookmaker.
It's seed money.

815
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,358
He's setting up in Florida right now.
He says it's the next growth area.

816
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,736
You gave your money
to a bookie who skipped town?

817
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:35,315
I want what I have coming, Dan.
I have to get back on television.

818
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,026
- Herb, I'm gonna...
- Show me this list. Where's this list?

819
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,162
I submitted a list of 45 names.

820
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,160
They rejected three.
You were one of them.

821
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:47,164
That big uncircumcised putz is
on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine,

822
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,621
and I can't even make
the top 42 for a panel show.

823
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,590
Look, maybe you could warm up
the audience before the show.

824
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,760
- I could throw you 50 bucks a week.
- Fifty bucks a week?

825
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,628
That should be me
on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

826
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,466
- Shit, Herb, just sign the statement.
- Charles Van Doren.

827
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,967
He wouldn't know the answer to
a doorbell if you didn't give it to him.

828
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,015
Sign the statement,
and get on with your life!

829
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,973
Sign the statement, Herb. Sign
the statement. Who cares if it's true?

830
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,851
- I'm giving you a chance.
- You promised me!

831
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,151
You get me that panel show,

832
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,150
or I'm gonna bring you down with me,
ya lousy, lyin' prick!

833
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,607
- You and Charles Van fuckin' Doren!
- No, you're not.

834
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,988
I'll just tell everyone that it's a fraud.
That'll warm 'em up.

835
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,286
"The fix is in,
this week on <i>Twenty-One."</i>

836
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,453
When's my next appointment?

837
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,825
The cover of <i>Time?</i> His mug shot
will be on the cover of <i>Time!</i>

838
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,960
What the hell happened?

839
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,416
<i>Oy.</i>

840
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,631
<i>Why am I the only one</i>
<i>workin' this mornin'?</i>

841
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,132
<i>You got here earlier, Mooie.</i>

842
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,215
"Demonstrators stoned
Vice President Nixon's motorcade

843
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,299
"as it proceeded through Caracas."

844
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,302
Gee, Dick, what's the
<i>New York Times</i> say? Same thing?

845
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,477
Generally.

846
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,974
Most people who live in Washington
settle for the Washington papers.

847
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,809
Well, the <i>Times</i>
is the paper of record.

848
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,644
- Ah.
- Ooh.

849
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,863
Dick hopes someday to be confused
with an important person.

850
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,155
"Although the crowd was cordoned off
at a distance of a hundred yards,

851
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,830
"an unidentified Venezuelan struck
Nixon in the head with a thrown onion."

852
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,161
The Senators should sign this guy.

853
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,039
Did you guys know there was a grand
jury in New York on the quiz shows?

854
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,583
Jim Lemon can't even hit
the cutoff man.

855
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,664
This guy throws a 300-foot strike
with an onion.

856
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,712
- Have they come up with anything?
- They sealed the presentment.

857
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,261
- That's a no.
- Why do you say that?

858
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,838
A presentment's
a statement of findings.

859
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,346
If there were anything in it, they'd want
to release it to the public, right?

860
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,845
If the purpose is to make findings
public, then why keep it a secret?

861
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,901
<i>Why seal</i>
<i>the presentment? It's illogical.</i>

862
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:38,237
- It's a local matter.
- It's television.

863
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,532
Whoa. TV.

864
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,901
It's under our jurisdiction, right?

865
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,701
I mean, we have oversight
over all the agencies.

866
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,949
It includes the F.C.C.

867
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,372
You're gonna investigate
a dead investigation?

868
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,452
We're gonna put television
on trial. Television.

869
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,458
Everybody in the country'll
know about it.

870
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,210
- What do you have?
- There's somethin' there.

871
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,047
Mr. Chairman, I'll find it.

872
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,093
The networks,
pharmaceutical industry?

873
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,930
Cosmetics?

874
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,149
That's big game, son.
You don't go huntin' in your underwear.

875
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:19,650
Sir, I smell somethin'. At least give
me a chance to see what I can dig up.

876
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,731
Let me go up to New York.

877
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,068
<i>This isn't some junket</i>
<i>for you to stay in a hotel</i>

878
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,364
<i>and see a Broadway show.</i>

879
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:30,740
<i>I'm givin' you exactly one week</i>
<i>to find something. You get that?</i>

880
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:35,913
Unseal a presentment. I don't know.

881
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,632
I don't know how
you go about that. I've never...

882
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,093
Oh, here you go. Look at this.

883
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:47,140
Hasn't been a presentment under seal
in the State of New York since 1869.

884
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,591
That explains it.

885
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,810
- 1869?
- Yeah.

886
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:55,519
Counselor, I've reviewed in detail
the material submitted in your request.

887
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,601
A man's reputation
is coin of the realm to him.

888
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,107
I sealed this presentment

889
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,026
to protect the reputations
of those unfairly implicated

890
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,701
by a certain mentally
unstable finger-pointer.

891
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:11,030
That interest, along with
important issues of federalism,

892
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:14,125
dictate that I reject your committee's
request at this time.

893
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,510
Mr. Enright's office. Mr. Enright?

894
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,803
It's Judge Schweitzer.

895
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,818
- Yes?
- H i. Miss Mitchell?

896
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,524
- Uh-huh.
- My name is Richard Goodwin.

897
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,322
I'm with the Congressional
Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight.

898
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,197
We've been investigating
the quiz shows recently.

899
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,869
I was wondering
if I could ask you a quick question.

900
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,325
<i>Oh! I've got people.</i>

901
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,668
Could I just have
a moment of your time?

902
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,871
No.

903
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,083
I was curious how many
episodes you appeared on.

904
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,008
- Not very many. No.
- How...

905
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,001
Three weeks.

906
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,088
Did anyone ever ask you
not to talk to anyone?

907
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,393
The Today Show
<i>with Dave Garroway,</i>

908
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,563
<i>and Dave's regular co-host,</i>
<i>Mr. J. Fred Muggs.</i>

909
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,392
<i>Dave's guests this morning are,</i>
<i>the Aga Khan,</i>

910
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,398
<i>Lyle Goodhue, inventor</i>
<i>of the aerosol spray can,</i>

911
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,572
<i>and quiz champion</i>
<i>Charles Van Doren.</i>

912
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,237
Take a look at that.
Look at that. You see that?

913
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,569
Yes. Uh-huh.

914
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,367
Well, you have that conversation,
and I'm gonna begin the show.

915
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,582
I'll see you, Mr. Muggs.

916
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,411
Good morning.

917
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,245
- And good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, Dave.

918
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,418
- How are you this morning?
- I'm fine, thank you.

919
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,548
I see we have an unusually
large crowd outside there this morning.

920
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,220
- So how long has it been now, Charlie?
- It's been nine weeks now.

921
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,636
- And you've won how much?
- $93,000.

922
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,560
- H mm, so that's $ 10,000 a week.
- That's right.

923
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,433
Although last week, I know you were
preempted for another program.

924
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:02,150
Well, that's the problem with television.
The pay's good, but it's not that steady.

925
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,603
Don't remind me. I'm up for renewal.

926
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,404
So tell us about the book
you're working on.

927
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,447
Well, it's called <i>Lincoln's Commando,</i>

928
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,068
and I hope people will find it
as interesting as I do.

929
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,404
How do you think Honest Abe
would do on a quiz show?

930
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,332
- Honest Abe?
- Yeah.

931
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,410
Well, I think he'd do very well.

932
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,413
And, of course, on a show like this,
he'd be wonderful.

933
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,247
I'm sure he would.

934
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,427
Here we are, Professor.

935
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,187
Yeah, I'm just...
I just have to tie my shoe.

936
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,869
- Hi, Mr. Van Doren.
- Hey, Mr. Van Doren.

937
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,329
- Oh!
- Hey!

938
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,843
- Oh!
- Good morning. H i.

939
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,962
- Good morning, Mr. Van Doren.
- Good morning.

940
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,218
- Where's the monkey?
- I saw you on TV this morning.

941
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,847
Is Thomas Merton Episcopalian
or Catholic?

942
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,435
Catholic.

943
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,147
Hello. Are you here for office hours?

944
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,309
Oh, no. I'm Richard Goodwin.

945
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,028
- Did Clark Byse call?
- Clark Byse? No, he didn't.

946
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,357
See, I'm up from Washington.
He suggested I might look you up.

947
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,614
- You're not a stockbroker, are you?
- Lawyer, which is bad enough.

948
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,871
- Professor Byse taught me Contracts.
- Then we have something in common.

949
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,410
He taught me my backhand.

950
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,662
I'm with the House Subcommittee
on Legislative Oversight.

951
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,001
I've been swarmed by
stockbrokers lately.

952
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,830
I feel like a girl with a bad reputation.

953
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,799
The Committee has jurisdiction
over television.

954
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,469
I'm sorry. Please have a seat.

955
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,429
Thank you.

956
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:03,680
You must have done very well
at Harvard. Clark doesn't like anyone.

957
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,682
I was, uh, actually first in my class.

958
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,858
- You make it sound like an affliction.
- Well...

959
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,025
Did you clerk?

960
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,439
- Frankfurter.
- Oh, really? Hmm.

961
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,731
It's nothin'. I tell you,
what I love is what you do, literature.

962
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:18,198
Well, hell, if I was first
in my class, I'd get a tattoo.

963
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,573
So, what brings you
to New York, Dick, literature?

964
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,873
Let me ask ya.

965
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,377
Did you ever notice anything out of the
ordinary about the quiz show you're on?

966
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,162
What?

967
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,752
Anything suspect. Anything at all.

968
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,588
You mean besides its popularity?

969
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,714
What I'm hoping is that

970
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,587
you might be able to give me
some kind of road map here.

971
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,048
- I feel like we speak the same language.
- Well, of course.

972
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,425
Anything I can do to help.

973
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:42,893
- Oh, um, Mr. Van Doren.
- Yes? Yes, yes.

974
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,936
I'm sorry. I'm in your class
on the Romantics, and...

975
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,013
Of course you are.

976
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,441
I... Actually, I'm auditing it
because you've been on television.

977
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,565
- Do you... Should I come back later?
- Oh, if you don't mind...

978
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,653
- I'll come back.
- I tell you what.

979
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,231
Why don't you meet me tomorrow?

980
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,949
- I'll take you to lunch at the Athenaeum.
- The what?

981
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,239
I'm sorry. The Athenaeum Club
at Forty-third and Fifth?

982
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,993
Say, tomorrow at noon?

983
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,789
- Lunch at The Athenaeum.
- At noon.

984
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,908
- Great.
- Great. See you then.

985
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,332
I wanted to talk to you
about <i>Ode on a Grecian Urn.</i>

986
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,333
"Beauty is truth, truth, beauty.

987
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,336
"That is all ye know on earth
and all ye need to know."

988
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,758
Does he really mean that
about beauty and truth?

989
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,468
Why foster child? I don't under...

990
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,796
Congress investigates communists.

991
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,803
Congress investigates mobsters.
That is not me.

992
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:25,432
Yeah, well, look on the bright side.
You'll be on national television.

993
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,430
- That's a joke, Charlie.
- Well, that's not funny.

994
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,856
- Charles Van Doren.
- It's just not funny.

995
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,150
Hey! Charles Van Doren!

996
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,144
- How ya doin'?
- I'm worried about this.

997
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,606
- Yeah, well, look, I... Who was that?
- It's just some guy.

998
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,357
Well, look, I already know about
this guy Goodwin,

999
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,783
and I'm on top of it. So trust me.

1000
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,152
- You callin' Information?
- You don't understand.

1001
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,327
What are you dialin' for?

1002
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:43,366
- Oh, for information?
- I have a name.

1003
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,790
Charles Van Doren,
he's dialin' for information.

1004
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,994
Hey, Chuck, what do you do?
Chuckie! Answer this question.

1005
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,336
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1006
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,831
What street do I live
on in Brooklyn, huh?

1007
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,675
- Did you tell him anything?
- No, no, I didn't...

1008
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,219
I gotta go. I gotta go! I've gotta go!

1009
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,548
Come on! Let's go! Hey, Chuck, how ya
doin'? How ya holdin' up? All right?

1010
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,554
Hey, can I get an autograph
for my wife?

1011
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,476
Give me an autograph for my wife!

1012
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,017
Come on, Charles, don't be a snob.
Give me an autograph for my wife!

1013
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,982
So Sandra says
what's ever on her mind.

1014
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,193
And you've been married how long?

1015
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,312
Five years. You?

1016
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,153
Oh, no. I'm supposed to be
fixed up with this girl

1017
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,993
on the cover of the new
<i>Harper's Bazaar,</i> but...

1018
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,662
- Well, you know how that is.
- Yeah.

1019
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,826
- Waldorf salad for you, Mr. Van Doren.
- Oh, thank you.

1020
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,661
- And a Reuben sandwich.
- Thank you.

1021
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,755
- So...
- Oh.

1022
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,427
What do you know about this
grand jury investigation, Charlie?

1023
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,509
Oh, I remember Dan mentioned
something about this,

1024
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,593
that it was all some...
Some wild goose chase.

1025
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,932
Uh, a political thing.

1026
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,349
They talk so fast in that business.
Half of it goes right past me.

1027
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,395
Dan?

1028
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,148
Enright. He's really the one to talk to.

1029
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,276
- You know if he testified?
- Uh, uh, more water?

1030
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,195
You can reach him at N BC.
Dan Enright.

1031
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,662
So, how long have you been
with this committee, Dick?

1032
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:19,042
Six months. Seemed like a good way
to postpone the inevitable.

1033
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,887
Postpone the inevitable.
Is there a spot for me?

1034
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,798
I mean Wall Street.

1035
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,429
Oh.

1036
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,723
So, back to this grand jury business.

1037
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,349
- I'm wondering...
- Oh.

1038
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,360
- Dad.
- Charlie.

1039
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,188
Excuse me, Frank.

1040
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,948
This is a surprise.

1041
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,445
How are you, son? We share an office,
and I never see you anymore.

1042
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,575
I'm there, Dad.
I'm just hiding behind your reputation.

1043
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,074
No, I'm serious.
We all miss you at home.

1044
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,792
Please, join us.
Dad, this is Dick Goodwin.

1045
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,081
He's up from Washington.

1046
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,455
- Narrow escape.
- Dad doesn't like Washington.

1047
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,712
A swamp that traded malaria for politics.

1048
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,796
- What's the special?
- It's the Reuben.

1049
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,599
Reuben sandwich is the only
entirely invented sandwich.

1050
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,178
Won the National Sandwich
Contest two years ago.

1051
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,105
- A salient point. Who invented it?
- Reuben Kay.

1052
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,355
- At a poker game in Omaha.
- I knew there was a "K" in Nebraska.

1053
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,982
Unfortunately,
they have the sandwich here,

1054
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,813
but they don't seem to have
any Reubens.

1055
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,698
- Touché.
- Dick's a protégé of Clark Byse.

1056
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,197
I just finished a clerkship
with Justice Frankfurter.

1057
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,663
Of course you did.

1058
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,118
Frankfurter collects brains
the way other people collect stamps.

1059
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,249
Did you happen to see
the show Monday, Dad?

1060
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,123
Monday.
Uh, we were with Bunny Wilson.

1061
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,467
Oh, no, it's nothing. Just there
was a question about Hawthorne.

1062
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,796
Oh, well, you know how it is
with Bunny once he gets going.

1063
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,139
So, Dick, Charlie invite you
to his poker game yet?

1064
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,966
He's a helluva poker player.

1065
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,972
We have a regular game
Thursday nights,

1066
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,470
just some friends I went to school with.

1067
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,017
You're welcome to come over
next week.

1068
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,309
Are you a gambler, Dick?

1069
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,610
I don't know if I'm a gambler.
I know which end of an ace is up.

1070
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:06,319
Well, Dick, if you look round the table
and you can't tell who the sucker is,

1071
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,821
it's you.

1072
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,909
Yeah, Dan Enright, please.

1073
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,825
Uh, Dick Goodwin.

1074
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,004
Uh, no. Actually, I'll just call back.
Thanks.

1075
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,507
"Name the three heavyweight
champions who preceded Joe Louis."

1076
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,096
Oh, I know that.
Uh, Jim Braddock.

1077
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,012
- Mmm-hmm.
- Max Baer.

1078
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,348
And...

1079
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,682
- Damn.
- Primo Carnera.

1080
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,522
- Primo Carnera. Of course.
- Yeah, good old Primo.

1081
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,524
I was there that night at the Garden,
the night Baer beat him.

1082
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,611
- Really?
- Yeah.

1083
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,736
The big guinea.
12 times Baer knocked him down.

1084
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,067
Al, I've been thinking.

1085
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,945
Maybe you shouldn't
give me the answers anymore.

1086
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,371
Now what do you wanna
do that for, Professor?

1087
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,579
Charlie, you're doin'
the right thing, really.

1088
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,913
Everybody's makin' money.

1089
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,418
Well, what if you just
gave me the questions

1090
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,296
and I could look up
the answers on my own?

1091
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,469
I mean, don't you think that'd be...
Well, be less egregious.

1092
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,512
<i>Only in the balcony.</i>

1093
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,761
<i>You know about that.</i>

1094
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,347
<i>All right. Now, your consequence...</i>

1095
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,144
Doesn't want the answers anymore.
Just wants the questions.

1096
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,481
- Who?
- "Who." The Great White Hope.

1097
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,952
Dan, what the hell is "egregious"?

1098
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,454
He just wants the questions?

1099
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,409
Excuse me. Mr. Noland?

1100
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,290
- Yeah?
- My name is Richard Goodwin.

1101
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,838
I'm with the Congressional
Subcommittee on Legislative...

1102
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,131
Ah.

1103
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,297
<i>No, no, I don't wanna say</i>
<i>anything. No, can't help you.</i>

1104
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,919
<i>I told them</i>
<i>everything I had to say.</i>

1105
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,887
<i>Everything I knew, I told them.</i>

1106
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,524
Yeah?

1107
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,853
Mr. Stempel. My name is Dick Goodwin.

1108
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,815
I'm an investigator with the
Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight

1109
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,316
of the U. S. Congress.

1110
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,362
Yeah?

1111
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,489
Did you recently testify
before a grand jury?

1112
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,616
Yeah.

1113
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,740
Well, if you have a minute,
I'd really like to talk to you about it.

1114
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,168
Gee.

1115
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,463
Finally. I knew it was
just a matter of time.

1116
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,790
Come in.

1117
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,632
Didn't you go to City College?

1118
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,254
- Harvard.
- Toby.

1119
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,683
This is my wife, Toby.
This is Mr. Goodwin.

1120
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,136
He's an investigator from
the United States Congress.

1121
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,144
Would you like a cup of coffee, Mr...
I already got the pot on.

1122
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,733
I tell ya, that sounds great, actually.

1123
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,145
And bring some rugulach
if there are any left.

1124
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,073
I love my wife, but it's like
livin' with a plague of locusts.

1125
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,155
If Charles Van Doren told 'em
what I told 'em,

1126
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,988
do you think this whole grand jury thing
would be squashed?

1127
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,324
- Quashed. It's not "squashed."
- Not in a million years.

1128
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,496
Quashed, okay?

1129
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,373
What exactly did you
tell the grand jury?

1130
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,416
- Have one.
- No, thanks.

1131
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,839
Lester, will you
knock it off for 10 minutes?

1132
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,044
Come on. They're a Jewish delicacy.
Before Toby eats it.

1133
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,718
- I'm retainin' water for your information.
- You and the Grand Coulee Dam.

1134
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,215
Come on. You don't know
what you're missing.

1135
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,676
I'm quite familiar with rugulach,
thank you.

1136
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,557
- How'd a guy like you get into Harvard?
- Capped teeth.

1137
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,059
Lester.

1138
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,904
Herb, what exactly did you
tell the grand jury?

1139
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,194
No, you can't ask me that.
It's... It's sealed. It's illegal.

1140
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,528
Well, just between us.

1141
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,248
They made me take a dive. <i>Marty.</i>

1142
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,873
They made me lose on <i>Marty</i>
just to humiliate me.

1143
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,246
- Who made you take a dive?
- Dan Enright.

1144
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,919
He told me I had plateaued,
that the ratings had plateaued.

1145
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,588
A sinking ship and the rats stayed.

1146
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,419
Do you think in a million years
I wouldn't know <i>Marty,</i>

1147
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:56,924
and meanwhile, Charles Van Moron

1148
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,721
would be on the show
11 weeks in a row?

1149
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,558
I don't understand.
How could they make you take a dive?

1150
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,767
What?

1151
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,095
Why didn't you just answer <i>Marty</i>
if you knew it?

1152
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,602
What, and throw away
his future in television?

1153
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:10,810
Would you please go inside
and tell Gene Krupa to take five?

1154
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,774
Lester. Lester!

1155
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:16,239
You're so naive. It's a fix.
It's all... It's all a fix.

1156
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,656
A setup. I made a study of it.
They always follow a Jew with a Gentile.

1157
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:23,079
And the Gentile wins more money.
What is that, a coincidence?

1158
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,449
Herb, you're saying this whole grand
jury thing was because of you.

1159
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,044
You know what you have to do?
You have to nail Van Doren.

1160
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,746
Are you gonna nail Van Doren?

1161
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,588
Look, first of all,
I'm not here to nail anyone, okay?

1162
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,752
This isn't McCarthyism.

1163
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,630
Listen, think about
what McCarthyism did for McCarthy.

1164
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,672
Let me ask you something.

1165
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,628
Do you have any corroborative
evidence to what you're saying?

1166
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,301
Listen to me. Don't make necessarily

1167
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,804
the mistakes that I might have
made in life.

1168
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,600
Think about your career.

1169
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,640
You nail Van Doren,
it'll be bigger than Sputnik.

1170
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:50,687
It'll be like a big, blond Sputnik crashing
right down on his, whew, friggin' head.

1171
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,276
Charlie? Hi. Dick Goodwin.

1172
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,364
I hope you don't mind.

1173
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,943
The English Department gave me
your number up in Connecticut.

1174
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,663
Yeah. Look, I met with
Herbert Stempel yesterday.

1175
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,708
He told me a couple of things.
I'm kinda curious...

1176
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,122
What?

1177
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,459
Sure. Well, what train was that?

1178
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,633
<i>Yeah, just hold on.</i>
<i>I got a pen right here.</i>

1179
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,877
<i>Grand Central Station.</i>

1180
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,382
<i>Housatonic.</i>

1181
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,972
<i>Cornwall, Connecticut.</i>

1182
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,302
<i>I will... I will... I'll get right on the way.</i>

1183
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,648
- Dick, I'm glad you could make it.
- Charlie.

1184
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,650
That's some snappy-looking Mercedes.

1185
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,527
Come around the back.
We're just about to eat.

1186
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:44,828
What's that, the 300?

1187
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,073
Yeah, it's my father's birthday,
so I bought myself a car.

1188
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:52,252
- It's only got 110 miles on it.
- The show's treatin' you well, huh?

1189
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,581
Dorothy, your tomato salad is fabulous.

1190
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,167
- What's your secret?
- Manure.

1191
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,214
Now, look at Thomas.

1192
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:04,173
Thomas is aerodynamically designed
to go directly to heaven.

1193
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:08,018
- And who are you?
- Dick. Goodwin.

1194
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,266
- I'm a friend of Charlie's.
- Ah.

1195
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,018
- You sound like you're from Boston.
- Brookline, actually.

1196
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,854
The wrong girl for me.

1197
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,607
- You know I didn't.
- You did.

1198
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,237
We have horseradish
growing in the garden.

1199
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,115
Well, that's true.

1200
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,739
- How long have you been married?
- 20 years.

1201
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:31,826
Aunt Irita had an affair
with Wendell Willkie.

1202
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,080
Hmm?

1203
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:39,008
"Now see summer bloom upon this lea.
Three score rings around this tree.

1204
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,301
"Once green, now bare.

1205
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,379
"Once lush, now sere.

1206
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,055
"Consoled only that I am

1207
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,892
- "planted here."
- You certainly are.

1208
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,760
- "Roots thick..."
- And old.

1209
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,387
- "...and deep,"
- And doddering.

1210
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:56,392
- "...assuage my woes..."
- A termite nibbles at my toes.

1211
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,815
<i>- Et tu,</i> Bunny?
- Charlie, is Jack Barry single?

1212
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:00,895
I think so.

1213
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,573
My roommate has a crush on him.
She wants you to introduce her.

1214
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,900
What's Dave Garroway like?

1215
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,405
- Cheap.
- "Cheat"?

1216
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,619
Wasn't I talking?

1217
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,618
You were, yes.
Talking and talking and talking.

1218
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,576
Charlie's famous, like Elvis Presley.

1219
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:17,296
Like Leopold of Belgium,
usurped by his son before his time.

1220
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,498
I suppose that makes me
King Baudouin?

1221
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,175
Next birthday,
you all get a dirty limerick.

1222
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,969
I certainly hope so.

1223
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,095
So how's it feel, Charlie?

1224
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,261
Well, I can't even
eat dinner in a restaurant anymore.

1225
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:36,815
People follow me inside to discover
what kind of "brain food" I eat.

1226
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,936
In my day, it was flagpole-sitting
and swallowing goldfish.

1227
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,773
Last week alone,
I had 11 proposals of marriage.

1228
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,319
Perhaps you should
accept one of them.

1229
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,652
To think they unleash you
on those impressionable young minds.

1230
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,283
Why not? He's 33 years old.

1231
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,872
Jesus Christ had a girlfriend
at 33 years old.

1232
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,621
- Look how that turned out.
- And he shared an office with his father.

1233
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,460
I'm sure they're all very nice girls.

1234
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,671
In that case, perhaps I should
appear on a quiz show.

1235
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,462
The money, meanwhile,
no one knows what to do with it.

1236
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,636
Though every stockbroker in New York
seems eager to try.

1237
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,631
Why don't you just put it in the bank?

1238
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,849
That's what I've always done
with my prize money.

1239
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:13,473
No, it's just...
You don't understand, Dad.

1240
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,349
There are all sorts of tax implications.

1241
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,806
I think I can understand
the concept of taxes.

1242
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,732
At this level, it's a bit more complicated.

1243
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,400
And at my level?

1244
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,521
I never thought of myself
having a level, Charlie.

1245
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,988
What level might that be?

1246
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,694
I mean, it's not as if the money fell
into my lap. I worked for it.

1247
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,824
Work? Oh!

1248
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,323
Millions of people watch
the game shows, Dad.

1249
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,079
Then I suppose we've become
a nation of proctors.

1250
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,411
- Mark.
- Help me out here, Harvard.

1251
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,791
Uh...

1252
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,419
Claim victory and depart the field.

1253
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,171
We don't have a television.

1254
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,344
Why on earth
would we need a television?

1255
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,546
How much money is it again?

1256
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:52,173
- What?
- They don't have a television.

1257
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,265
You haven't seen the show?

1258
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,514
We were supposed to watch it
the other night at Thurber's...

1259
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,638
Even Thurber has a television,
and he's blind.

1260
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,474
How much is it now, Charlie?

1261
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,068
- $ 122,000.
- What?

1262
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,238
She heard that all right.

1263
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,194
Well.

- Well, what have we here?

1277
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,287
Aw.

1278
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,299
Uh-huh.

1279
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,301
Oh, now.

1280
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:18,093
Oh, my God. How swell.

1281
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:22,939
I guess I'm surrounded.
Thank you, Charlie.

1282
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,768
I thought you might like it, Dad.

1283
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,446
So do you remember Herbert Stempel?

1284
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,944
Remember him?
I still can't believe I beat him.

1285
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:40,658
Stempel tells me that Dan Enright
made him take a dive from the show.

1286
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,455
What?

1287
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:47,046
He tells me that Dan Enright
made him take a dive.

1288
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,175
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah?

1289
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,344
A little odd, though, don't ya think?

1290
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,430
I mean, losing on
such an easy question?

1291
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,512
You know, frankly, Dick,
if Stempel can just run around

1292
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,016
and smear a man like Dan Enright
to the United States Congress...

1293
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,354
No, nobody's smearing anybody.

1294
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,394
I'm just trying to
figure out the truth here.

1295
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,350
Could you just untie the bowline there
and shove us off?

1296
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,649
All right.

1297
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,197
Dick, could you raise
the jib for us, please?

1298
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,998
The jib. Just... Yeah.

1299
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,342
Do you remember what it was like for
guys like us when we were in school?

1300
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,592
Being smart was like being cross-eyed.

1301
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,889
But you should see the letters I get.

1302
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,509
Kids are excited about... About books

1303
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,012
and learning and general knowledge.

1304
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,478
Dan Enright had a lot to do with that.

1305
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,276
Yeah, but don't you think
he wanted you to win?

1306
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,729
I mean, if you look at the ratings,
they're staggering.

1307
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:56,575
Well, what did he say,
they "made" him take a dive?

1308
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,741
Well.

1309
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,906
Well, how did they "make" him
take a dive anyway?

1310
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,701
He didn't want to jeopardize any
future he might have in television.

1311
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,451
Yeah, well...

1312
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:10,539
Anyway, how many people did you say
testified in front of the grand jury?

1313
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,631
Why? What's your point?

1314
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,337
Well, if what you're saying is true,
then everybody lied.

1315
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,229
- H i. Al Freedman.
- H i. I'm Danny.

1316
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,938
Good to see you. I'm sorry for the delay.
Come on in. Have a seat.

1317
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,943
Would you like a cup of coffee
or a soft drink?

1318
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,565
- Anything?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

1319
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,113
- You sure?
- We're very well stocked up here.

1320
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:40,239
- Nothing?
- I'm fine.

1321
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,235
No trouble.

1322
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,071
I understand you've spoken to
Charles Van Doren.

1323
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,953
- And Herbert Stempel.
- Oh, I was afraid of that.

1324
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,918
He says and I quote,
that he was made to "take a dive."

1325
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,334
Believe me, I'm quite familiar
with Herb's allegations.

1326
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,130
I could recite them by rote.

1327
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:56,130
46 witnesses swore up and down
Herbie's a lying tub of shit.

1328
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,252
- Al.
- Sorry.

1329
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,635
- Why the big secret?
- Well, to protect people's reputations.

1330
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:05,636
I mean, frankly, you never know what
the public is gonna believe, you see?

1331
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,433
There's that and...

1332
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,104
And what?

1333
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,815
Look, Dick, I... Can I call you Dick?

1334
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,112
Sure, Dan.

1335
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,487
After the loss, Herb came to
visit me in an agitated...

1336
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:23,490
Well, I suppose the clinical term
would be... What?

1337
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,284
- The guy's nuts.
- Manic.

1338
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,532
- He was in a manic frame of mind.
- Manic.

1339
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,710
And I took the precaution
of tape recording that meeting.

1340
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,253
Al, would you play the tape?

1341
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,252
Listen to this.

1342
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,501
<i>You get me that panel show</i>

1343
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:41,300
<i>or I'm gonna bring you down,</i>
<i>you lousy lyin' prick.</i>

1344
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,552
<i>You and Charles Van fuckin' Doren.</i>

1345
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,508
<i>What is this, Herb?</i>
<i>Are you blackmailin' me?</i>

1346
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,845
<i>I need that money, Dan.</i>
<i>I need to get back on television.</i>

1347
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,062
<i>You get me that panel show</i>

1348
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,640
<i>- or I'll tell everyone it's a fraud.</i>
- <i>You know that's not true.</i>

1349
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,895
<i>Who cares if it's true?</i>

1350
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,568
<i>"The fix is in</i>
<i>this week on</i> Twenty-One."

1351
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:56,644
Okay.

1352
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,698
So he needed more money
after all that money he won.

1353
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,162
Gambling. And that's the least of it.

1354
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:10,208
I mean, if the judge was protecting
anyone, he was protecting Herb.

1355
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,497
Given... Well...

1356
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:20,047
- His medical condition.
- His medical condition?

1357
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,919
- Oh, yeah.
- Al, get the bills.

1358
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,679
I mean, put yourself in his shoes.

1359
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,101
He's no longer in the public eye.

1360
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,019
He's remembered,
if he's remembered at all,

1361
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,766
as "the guy that lost to Van Doren."

1362
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,600
Television is like a monkey on his back,

1363
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,528
and we're not talking about someone
who is necessarily stable to begin with.

1364
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:41,732
- No.
- So you paid for his psychoanalysis?

1365
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:43,233
- I felt responsible.
- You're too nice.

1366
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,700
- No, I'm not.
- If it were up to me,

1367
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,535
I would've sent him to the skating rink
the fast way.

1368
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:49,535
- Five sessions a week?
- Five, and not a dent.

1369
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,910
Herb is so angry with himself for losing,

1370
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,206
and it was on
such a simple question, too.

1371
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,047
<i>- Marty.</i>
<i>- Marty.</i> His ego couldn't handle it.

1372
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,380
He blames Charles Van Doren
for his downfall.

1373
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,094
And, of course,
the real downfall of Herbert Stempel

1374
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,555
- has always been Herbert Stempel.
- Herbert Stempel. Absolutely.

1375
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,554
You met him.
Does he seem stable to you?

1376
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,220
Well, I definitely have an inkling
of what you're talking about.

1377
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:15,723
He told me this whole story about
how when a Jew is on the show,

1378
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,481
he always loses to a Gentile, and then
the Gentile wins more money.

1379
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,399
Right? Who could
dream up a scheme like that?

1380
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,609
A symptom of his Van Doren fixation.

1381
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,445
The thing of it is, I looked it up. It's true.

1382
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,412
We could check it.

1383
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,290
Herbie, I wanna go home.

1384
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:39,088
I took you to dinner, didn't I?
Just hold your horses.

1385
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,424
This is ridiculous.

1386
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,928
Where have you been?

1387
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,928
Why don't you return my phone calls?
Did you talk to Van Doren?

1388
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,100
I'll tell you who I spoke to.
I spoke to Dan Enright.

1389
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,313
Forget Enright.

1390
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:57,937
Goodwin, 1535.

1391
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,643
You threatened to blackmail him
if he didn't get you on a panel show?

1392
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,988
What? When? I didn't blackmail him.
What are you talking about?

1393
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:08,159
- He's got the whole thing on tape.
- He promised me that panel show.

1394
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,824
What tape?
What are you talking about?

1395
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,122
Listen, Goodwin, don't think
I don't see what you're doin'.

1396
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,120
You're building this great case
against me.

1397
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:18,666
A pile of evidence, an army of witnesses
against me, Herb Stempel.

1398
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,371
And meanwhile,
you and Van Doren are off

1399
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,502
giving each other the secret
Ivy League handshake.

1400
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,000
Herb, you're makin' me look like a jerk.

1401
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,676
I know what they're doin' to you.
They did it to me.

1402
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:26,843
Just because you went to Harvard,

1403
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,671
you think you have
some stake in the system?

1404
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,381
He didn't pay for your psychiatrist bills?

1405
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:33,183
The point is
Van Doren got the answers.

1406
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,224
He did not get the answers.
If anything, he gave them the answers.

1407
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,680
I know he got the answers.

1408
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,686
Ah, bullshit, Herb.
How do you know he got the answers?

1409
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,358
Because I got the answers.

1410
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,365
You got the answers?

1411
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,158
What do you mean,
you got the answers?

1412
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,372
Not very many answers.

1413
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,701
I just wanted to get out from
under the financial thumb of my in-laws.

1414
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,537
I don't understand.
I thought you were a victim in all this.

1415
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:04,044
I didn't hold myself up to be
the crowned prince of education.

1416
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,713
I didn't preen myself
on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine

1417
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,340
with a face full of phony humility...

1418
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,757
Good night, Herb.

1419
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,309
Toby.

1420
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,186
Toby, where do you think
you're going without me?

1421
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,188
You never told me you got the answers.

1422
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,861
I knew the answers to
a good part of the questions anyhow.

1423
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,404
The ones I didn't, they fed me.

1424
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,948
- I'm sure I must've mentioned it.
- It's not a thing you mentioned.

1425
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,904
What else did you do
that you didn't mention?

1426
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:38,583
Enright sat right in our kitchen and said,
"How'd you like to make $25,000?"

1427
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,081
I don't know any man in America
who would turn that down.

1428
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:44,209
- It's dishonest.
- Let me tell you about honest.

1429
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:45,878
You know what
my father used to tell me?

1430
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,710
"Work hard and you'll get ahead."
Was that honest?

1431
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,213
Look at Geritol.
"Geritol cures tired blood."

1432
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,386
And I'm the one
who's supposed to be ashamed.

1433
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,475
You never said that you were
getting the answers.

1434
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,553
Let them believe whatever they want.
What do I care?

1435
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:03,062
- What do I care if a bunch of saps...
- I was one of those saps, Herbert.

1436
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,454
He got the answers.

1437
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,624
Now why would he admit that?
He's only implicating himself.

1438
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:24,166
- Well, maybe it's the truth.
- Yeah, well I have a hunch it is the truth.

1439
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:27,249
Though meanwhile, we'll have to
have him testify in a straitjacket.

1440
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,426
But Van Doren isn't crazy.
Maybe you should put him on the stand.

1441
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,596
- What's Van Doren got to do with this?
- They gave Stempel the answers.

1442
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,260
Why would Van Doren be any different?

1443
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,842
You have no idea what
these people are like.

1444
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,929
It's all Thurber and Trilling
and Bunny Wilson.

1445
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,012
<i>Bunny?</i>

1446
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,440
Yeah, Edmund Wilson.
That's what they call him.

1447
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,313
Well, that doesn't mean you have to.

1448
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,687
Look, my point is, why would a guy
like that jeopardize everything he has?

1449
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,318
- Which is what?
- Sandra,

1450
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,445
the man is on
the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine.

1451
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,869
He's not gonna be on the cover of
<i>Time</i> as Mark Van Doren's son, Dick.

1452
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:00,164
<i>Boxing. How many</i>
<i>points would you like to risk?</i>

1453
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,617
<i>I'll risk eight points, Jack.</i>

1454
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:06,462
<i>All right. For eight points, name</i>
<i>the three heavyweight champions</i>

1455
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,956
<i>immediately preceding Joe Louis.</i>

1456
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,012
<i>Well, my father would know that.</i>

1457
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,716
<i>- That'd be James J. Braddock.</i>
<i>- Correct.</i>

1458
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,806
<i>Max Baer lost the belt to Braddock.</i>

1459
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,310
<i>Yes. And the fellow Baer beat?</i>

1460
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,356
<i>Oh, now, I remember</i>
<i>he knocked him down 12 times</i>

1461
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:28,025
<i>before he finally succumbed.</i>

1462
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,979
<i>- Would you like to guess?</i>
<i>- Primo Carnera.</i>

1463
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,026
<i>Correct. You have 21.</i>

1464
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,866
Second base is Eddie Stanky.

1465
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,286
No, it's Red Schoendienst.

1466
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,202
I hear that Pat Boone
plays on the White Shoes.

1467
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,534
- No, that's Daniel Boone.
- Ace-King bets.

1468
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:45,835
- Check.
- Check.

1469
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,002
Bet five.

1470
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,080
- I'll raise that a dollar.
- I'm out.

1471
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:51,875
You better watch out, Fred.

1472
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,218
Dick's one of the brightest
young lawyers down in Washington.

1473
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:58,715
Great. All my money already
goes to Washington. Taxes.

1474
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:01,183
- It's nothin' but organized theft.
- No, property.

1475
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,512
- What?
- "Property is theft," I believe.

1476
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,893
That's the locus classicus
from Proudhon.

1477
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,724
I warned you.

1478
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,526
- Oh, great, another one.
- Ace bets five.

1479
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,490
- And another one.
- I'll see that.

1480
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,407
- What are you working on, Charlie?
- I raise $5.

1481
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,405
I'd love to know
what you got under there, Charlie.

1482
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,077
The truth has its price.

1483
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:25,541
Everything has its price.

1484
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,421
So where'd ya prep, Dick?

1485
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:33,921
Dick's up here on a witch hunt.
He thinks <i>Twenty-One</i> is rigged.

1486
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,547
Is it?

1487
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:43,225
Hey, which face cards are
in profile, without looking?

1488
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,473
Jack of spades,
king of diamonds, jack of hearts.

1489
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,772
Can we play cards? It's bad enough
my wife makes me watch this crap.

1490
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:51,768
Okay, you're writing a book on Lincoln.
The night he was shot,

1491
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:53,235
who was the doctor at his deathbed?

1492
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,980
Joseph K. Barnes was the doctor.

1493
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,942
- Whoa.
- Who was the detective on the case?

1494
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:02,278
The detective was Clarvoe.
John Alexander Clarvoe.

1495
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,995
- Who embalmed him?
- Come on.

1496
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,914
Black or brown, Charles D. Brown.

1497
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,625
Then he was murdered
with estate taxes. Let's play.

1498
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:11,086
- You're not impressed?
- Ace checks.

1499
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,209
Check.

1500
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,089
Whoa!

1501
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,137
Now I'm impressed.

1502
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,302
Go ahead, Dick, call 'em.

1503
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,093
What do you say, Dick?

1504
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,101
I know you're lying.

1505
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,267
Whoa-oh.

1506
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:36,066
Bluffing. The word is bluffing.

1507
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,198
Too rich for my blood.

1508
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,372
- Try Geritol.
- Sandwich time.

1509
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,996
How 'bout a drink?

1510
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,211
This game could use a little juice, huh?

1511
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,547
<i>Charlie? Charlie?</i>

1512
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,800
The only people who can implicate you
directly are all in this room.

1513
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,172
Just think about that.

1514
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:04,973
You think that <i>nudzh</i> is gonna
get me to talk?

1515
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,141
He may be a <i>nudzh,</i>

1516
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,685
but he was also first in his class
at Harvard Law School.

1517
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,684
- Oh, Harvard?
- Will you please stop that?

1518
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,311
- Al, stop it.
- Sorry.

1519
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,684
Charlie, they could kill me,
I wouldn't talk.

1520
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:17,395
They could subject me
to any kind of torture...

1521
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,855
- The rack?
- Thank you.

1522
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,197
They could put me on the rack...

1523
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,524
- The iron maiden?
- Whatever.

1524
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:22,524
The bastinado?

1525
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,077
Charlie, I'm not tellin' 'em
a goddamned thing.

1526
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,029
- Correct me, Dan, if I'm wrong.
- No, you're right.

1527
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,580
Plus, what did you do wrong?

1528
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,578
Everybody knows the magician don't
saw the lady in half.

1529
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,661
- It's not exactly the same thing.
- It's entertainment.

1530
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,833
I am a college professor.

1531
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,876
They need the professor in make-up.

1532
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,731
Oh, well.

1533
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:43,905
Aren't you Charles Van Doren?

1534
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,945
I'm sorry, Dad.
I didn't mean to wake you.

1535
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,818
I just had to get out of the city.

1536
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,154
You're always welcome, Charlie.

1537
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,416
Sometimes it's hard sleeping in the city.

1538
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,744
I hope you don't mind.
I took the rest of the cake.

1539
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,455
You look like you could use it.

1540
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,461
Under a little strain lately.

1541
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:04,084
That's the way it always is
when you're finishing a book.

1542
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,963
Oh, no, actually,
it's the television show.

1543
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:11,468
Oh, Jesus, I just realized,
we watched your show.

1544
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,936
Did I tell you? Mother and I
moved the television to the den.

1545
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,642
- No, no, you didn't mention it.
- Anyway, what was it?

1546
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,359
Something about
the Galapagos Islands?

1547
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,984
You know what? I'll try some of that.

1548
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,986
The origin and the destination
of the voyage of the <i>Beagle.</i>

1549
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:30,661
That's right. Biology for six points.

1550
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:33,326
Good God, the pressure.

1551
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:37,501
All those lights, the money,
those strange little booths,

1552
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:41,497
that man talking so fast,
like being in a bull ring.

1553
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,500
I don't think I could remember my name.

1554
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:46,968
You know, I always had a good head
for that kind of stuff.

1555
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:50,590
It's just amazing that
you could make it look so easy.

1556
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:55,344
But your mother always said you were
the actor in the family, Charlie.

1557
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,020
Yeah.

1558
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:01,646
As long as it doesn't interfere
with your teaching, why not?

1559
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,148
Dad.

1560
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,659
Huh? What?

1561
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,577
Something on your mind?

1562
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,130
You never told me you felt pressure...

1563
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:36,093
You know, like finishing a book.

1564
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,971
Oh-ho, are you kidding?

1565
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,896
When I was finishing the Hawthorne
book, I tossed and turned so badly

1566
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,694
your mother threatened
to check into a hotel.

1567
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,692
Oh, sure.

1568
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:52,694
You know, I think the old bird's
finally getting the hang of this.

1569
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,748
You know, I just had
the strongest memory.

1570
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:01,084
Coming home from school,
going to the fridge.

1571
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:04,663
Ice-cold bottle of milk,
big piece of chocolate cake.

1572
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:08,209
It was just the simplicity of it.

1573
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:12,262
I can't think of anything that will
make me feel that happy again.

1574
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,059
Not till you have a son.

1575
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,158
<i>That would</i>
<i>be our most difficult question</i>

1576
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,234
<i>on American literature.</i>

1577
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:38,289
<i>For 11 points, I'll read you lines</i>
<i>from America's greatest poets.</i>

1578
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,783
<i>You must identify the author. First,</i>

1579
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:44,753
<i>"I hear America singing,</i>
<i>the varied carols I hear."</i>

1580
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,252
<i>That would be Walt Whitman.</i>

1581
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,425
<i>That's right. Second,</i>

1582
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:53,925
<i>"I shot an arrow in the air.</i>
<i>It fell to earth I know not where."</i>

1583
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:57,933
- <i>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</i>
<i>- Right again, Jim.</i>

1584
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:02,184
<i>Finally, "Hope is the thing with feathers</i>
<i>that perches in the soul."</i>

1585
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:06,358
<i>That is actually</i>
<i>by one of my favorite poets,</i>

1586
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:08,853
<i>Emily Dickinson.</i>

1587
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,562
<i>I'm sorry, Jim.</i>

1588
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,489
<i>Did... Did you say Emily Dickinson?</i>

1589
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,618
<i>Oh! Well, yes. All right.</i>

1590
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,786
<i>...Dickinson.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, Jim.</i>

1591
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,966
<i>Did... Did you say Emily Dickinson?</i>
<i>Oh! Well, yes.</i>

1592
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,973
<i>...favorite poets, Emily Dickinson.</i>

1593
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,392
<i>I'm sorry, Jim.</i>

1594
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:47,061
<i>Did... Did you say Emily Dickinson?</i>

1595
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:49,526
<i>Oh! Well, yes.</i>

1596
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,026
- Who is it?
- Mr. Snodgrass?

1597
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,828
- Yeah?
- My name is Richard Goodwin.

1598
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,534
- Yeah?
- Hi.

1599
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,992
I'm a Federal Investigator
on a congressional subcommittee.

1600
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,873
The committee's been
investigating the quiz shows.

1601
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,839
I was just looking at a kinescope of
your appearance on <i>Twenty-One,</i>

1602
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,379
and I noticed...

1603
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,925
Mr. Snodgrass?

1604
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:27,355
- This is good.
- Yeah? What is it?

1605
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,906
- Drive on by.
- What?

1606
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:46,203
- Go around to the back entrance.
- Okay.

1607
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,544
Mr. Kintner's office.

1608
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:57,761
Excuse me. Do you think he might
see me before the peacock molts?

1609
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,133
Who are you with again?

1610
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,806
I'm with the U.S. Congress.
Perhaps you've heard of them.

1611
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,761
Oh, your name is Gold... Excuse me,
not you. Your name is Goldwyn?

1612
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:06,932
- Goodwin.
- Yes.

1613
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,980
Please have a seat, Mr. Goldwyn...
Goodwin.

1614
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,773
- I'll see if he's available.
- Right.

1615
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:14,736
Yes, that's red, long stem. Thank you.

1616
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,652
Well, I'm sure he'd be available
if my name were Geritol.

1617
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,655
Perhaps if you could
come back another time.

1618
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,950
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Mr. Kintner.

1619
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,657
Mr. Kintner.
My name is Richard Goodwin.

1620
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:29,164
I'm with the Congressional
Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight.

1621
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,585
Congratulations.

1622
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:34,002
- How's Chairman Harris?
- He's fine.

1623
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,458
Still in that sand trap where I left him?

1624
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:39,761
I am here to give you
a chance to cooperate.

1625
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,590
We'll cooperate in any way we can.
Now will you excuse me?

1626
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,174
<i>Twenty-One</i> is rigged,
and I can prove it.

1627
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,600
Who won, how long they were on,

1628
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,143
it was all a scheme
to keep the ratings up,

1629
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,603
and N BC made millions off it.

1630
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,938
Young man,

1631
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:54,485
I am the President of the
National Broadcasting Company.

1632
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:58,857
I have no idea what the day-to-day
operations of <i>Twenty-One</i> are.

1633
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:02,284
Does Chairman Harris know every
little thing you're up to?

1634
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:06,284
I have Enright cold.
And, sir, that means I have you.

1635
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,122
- Really?
- Really.

1636
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:11,536
Then why are you the one
that's sweating?

1637
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,835
This week's challenger
from New York, New York,

1638
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,673
welcome Mrs. Vivienne Nearing.

1639
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:22,342
And returning this week with $ 139,000,
our champion, Charles Van Doren.

1640
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,809
A very cordial welcome to the show,
Mrs. Nearing.

1641
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,181
- Mr. Van Doren.
- Jack.

1642
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,305
You're back again with
a lot of money at stake.

1643
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,311
Mrs. Nearing, let's tell the Professor
and our audience

1644
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,358
a little something about you.

1645
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:38,858
<i>A sometimes painter,</i>
<i>pianist and Double-Crostics fan,</i>

1646
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:42,198
<i>she has a Bachelor's Degree</i>
<i>from Queens College, New York,</i>

1647
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,818
<i>and a M.A. and L.L.B. From Columbia.</i>

1648
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,825
<i>She and her husband Victor</i>
<i>are lawyers in New York.</i>

1649
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,664
Quite a bean
inside that pretty head, huh?

1650
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:50,908
She's terrifying.

1651
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:53,039
All right, I think you both know
how to play the game.

1652
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,836
Don't forget to put your earphones on.

1653
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,332
The very best of luck to both of you.
Let's play <i>Twenty-One.</i>

1654
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:07,341
<i>Some of the most important airplanes</i>
<i>of World War II were the following,</i>

1655
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:10,894
<i>the P-40, the P-47, the P-51,</i>

1656
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:14,685
<i>the B-24, the B-25 and the B-26.</i>

1657
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:18,944
<i>Give me the nicknames</i>
<i>the Air Force gave to these planes.</i>

1658
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,773
That's much harder than
the question they asked that woman,

1659
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,732
and hers was 10 points.

1660
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,363
Do you know
the names of those planes?

1661
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,576
Of course not. Sit down.

1662
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:29,200
Who would know the names
of those planes?

1663
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:32,040
- He's not the Secretary of Defense.
- Shh, shh.

1664
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,288
As we enter our final round,

1665
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,212
Mrs. Nearing leads
by a score of 21 to 16.

1666
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,046
It is the moment of truth, as it were,

1667
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,258
for Charles Van Doren,
our reigning champion,

1668
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,802
after a record-breaking 14 weeks.

1669
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,629
Will he hold onto his title?

1670
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:46,839
Wow.

1671
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,717
- Mrs. Nearing.
<i>- Yes?</i>

1672
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:51,639
You have the required 21 points.

1673
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,971
We're going to let you listen in
on this last round.

1674
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:57,558
Please do not divulge your score
or speak in any way.

1675
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,276
Mr. Van Doren, the category is royalty.

1676
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,655
- Royalty. Yes, sir.
- <i>Royalty.</i>

1677
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,482
How many points
would you like to try for?

1678
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:06,942
<i>Well, let's see.</i>

1679
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,571
<i>I'll take five, five points.</i>

1680
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:14,621
All right. Name the kings
of the following countries,

1681
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:18,462
Norway, Sweden, Belgium and Iraq.

1682
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:21,164
<i>- Could I take the third part last?</i>
<i>- Certainly.</i>

1683
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,749
<i>Take as much time</i>
<i>as you need, Charlie.</i>

1684
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,425
<i>You have a lot</i>
<i>riding on these answers.</i>

1685
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:28,172
<i>I sure have. Well, Norway,</i>
<i>that would be Haakon. King Haakon.</i>

1686
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,383
- <i>That's right.</i>
<i>- And Sweden, um, Gustavus.</i>

1687
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,520
<i>- Right again, Charlie. The King of Iraq?</i>
<i>- Iraq, uh...</i>

1688
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:39,520
Turn it... Turn it off.
Turn the damn thing off.

1689
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:44,313
- Good God. What got into you?
- It's just too nerve-wracking.

1690
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,320
<i>I remember that's his</i>

1691
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:51,245
<i>great-uncle in that wonderful book,</i>
The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom.

1692
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,197
<i>Um, Do... No, um...</i>

1693
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,123
<i>King Faisal.</i>

1694
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:57,951
Correct. And Belgium?

1695
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,664
<i>Belgium. Belgium. Belgium. Belgium.</i>
<i>Let me see... That's the third part?</i>

1696
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,214
That's right.

1697
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,583
Um...

1698
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:08,003
<i>King of Belgium...</i>

1699
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,888
<i>Let me see...</i>

1700
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:21,850
Professor, would you like more time?

1701
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,196
<i>Belgium, the King of Belgium.</i>

1702
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,066
<i>I can picture him, Jack.</i>

1703
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:32,195
<i>Right down to that</i>
<i>Hapsburg lip that they...</i>

1704
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:34,621
<i>I can't seem to summon the name.</i>

1705
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,160
<i>Um...</i>

1706
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,208
He's gonna dump it.

1707
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:46,041
Is Garroway here?

1708
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:53,431
Professor, I'm sorry. I'm going
to have to ask for your answer.

1709
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,433
<i>It seems like an easy one.</i>

1710
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,189
<i>Leopold.</i>

1711
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:11,654
No.

1712
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:20,705
No, I'm... I'm sorry, Charlie.
The answer is Baudouin.

1713
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:23,210
King Baudouin.

1714
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,540
Leopold is Baudouin's father,
the former king.

1715
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,217
What a stunning turn of events.

1716
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:32,088
Mrs. Nearing, you have just
unseated our champion.

1717
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:33,759
<i>Baudouin. Of course.</i>

1718
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,135
Come out here, both of you.

1719
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,231
You don't know what to do?
Give him another chance, that's what.

1720
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:47,774
Call it a bonus round,
but get him on that show again.

1721
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:51,072
Someone will call if he loses,
won't they?

1722
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,282
I'm sure.

1723
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,741
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1724
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:55,281
Changing of the guard, as it were.

1725
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,784
You take home
$ 10,000 of Mr. Van Doren's money.

1726
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,741
We'll try not to hold that against you.
Please, come back next week.

1727
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,576
Tell us you want to continue playing.
I sure hope you do.

1728
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,248
How 'bout a warm hand
for our new champion,

1729
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,087
- Mrs. Vivienne Nearing.
- Thank you.

1730
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,631
Whoa, who is that in our wing?
Is that Dave Garroway?

1731
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:16,180
Dave Garroway of the N BC
<i>Today Show,</i> ladies and gentlemen.

1732
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,805
Hello, Dave.

1733
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,102
- How are you, Charlie?
- Fine, thank you, Dave.

1734
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,721
I was wondering,
what are you gonna do now?

1735
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:27,104
Well, I was hoping to
enjoy some peace and quiet now

1736
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,273
and a chance to get back to my books.

1737
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:31,943
You know, eventually,
this sad day had to come,

1738
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,656
but we don't wanna lose you.

1739
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,483
So, at the <i>Today Show,</i> we decided

1740
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,612
why not make Charlie
our special cultural correspondent,

1741
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,540
to the people and to
the schoolchildren of America.

1742
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,742
Well, I...
I hope you're not firing the chimp.

1743
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:49,627
How does $50,000 a year
sound to you, Professor?

1744
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,636
Well, I...

1745
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:58,973
I was hoping to, um...
To get back to my teaching.

1746
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:03,554
Well, this is the largest classroom
in the world, Professor, television.

1747
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:07,061
So, if you will,
just sign right here on the dotted line.

1748
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:11,611
Charlie, walk away.
Come on. You don't need it.

1749
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:18,531
- Congratulations, Charlie.
- Thank you.

1750
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,536
- Did Mr. Garroway leave?
- Yes, sir.

1751
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,164
- Good show, Dave.
- Thanks.

1752
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,415
- Mrs. Nearing, congratulations.
- Thank you.

1753
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:29,746
It was a wonderful show.

1754
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,332
Gentlemen, this is Mrs. Nearing.
You know Al Freedman.

1755
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,667
Yes, we've met.

1756
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,214
You're gonna be
needed tomorrow.

1757
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,846
You're a very disruptive young man.

1758
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:44,015
Okay, let's bring the camera out,
and let's bring the blackboard in.

1759
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:46,229
- You remember James Snodgrass?
- Who?

1760
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:47,688
And can we get Mrs. Nearing in there?

1761
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,438
- James Snodgrass.
- Get her in there with her family.

1762
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,393
He was a contestant on your show.

1763
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,487
You know how many contestants
we've had?

1764
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,441
This man was an artist.
Maybe that'll jog your memory.

1765
01:30:57,535 --> 01:31:00,072
Al digs these people up.
God knows where he finds them.

1766
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:03,030
- Now, a picture with her mother.
- He's in Greenwich Village.

1767
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:06,082
There was a question about the first
line of a poem by Emily Dickinson.

1768
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,375
Barry apparently expected

1769
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,244
he was going to say
Ralph Waldo Emerson and get it wrong.

1770
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,875
Really? I'm very busy now.

1771
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:12,747
Yeah, and I have it
on the kinescope, okay?

1772
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,299
It's clear as day.
The man literally did a double take.

1773
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:18,754
He did a double take.
And who told you this?

1774
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,130
Is this Herb again?

1775
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,307
Or is this the Greenwich Village
beatnik?

1776
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:23,383
That's interesting.

1777
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,220
Why is he a beatnik?
Because he's not Charlie Van Doren?

1778
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,893
Yeah, you're damn right.
He's not Charlie Van Doren.

1779
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:30,724
You got crackpots
comin' out of the woodwork.

1780
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,434
You're snoopin' around
askin' questions.

1781
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:34,276
You don't have a shred of
concrete evidence.

1782
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,941
Let me tell you somethin'.

1783
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:37,943
In this envelope are all the questions

1784
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:40,613
that James Snodgrass was
asked on <i>Twenty-One,</i> okay?

1785
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:44,784
The odd thing about this envelope is he
appeared on the show on January 13,

1786
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:48,913
yet somehow he mailed this to himself
January 11, registered mail.

1787
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,087
I'd say that's pretty goddamn concrete,
wouldn't you?

1788
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,583
Look right into the camera.

1789
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,677
I wasn't in there, was I?
You didn't see me?

1790
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,551
No, you were out. It's okay.

1791
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:18,359
Why would he do that?

1792
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:22,026
How's that trap feel
clamped on your leg?

1793
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,321
He sent it to himself registered mail?

1794
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:28,202
Why should you be the fall guy here

1795
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,285
when NBC and Geritol are
makin' the real money?

1796
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,331
Dick.

1797
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:41,294
Dan.

1798
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,635
You want me to implicate the network?

1799
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:46,758
You don't owe them a thing.

1800
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:51,805
If I even hinted that the network knew,

1801
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:54,391
and they didn't know,

1802
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,732
they'd never let me
through the door again.

1803
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:02,824
I got a sneakin' suspicion you're not
going through that door anyway.

1804
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:08,200
Television's my life, Dick.

1805
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:12,079
It's over.
Why don't you go talk to your family?

1806
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:19,340
I just had a thought.

1807
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,006
Would you be interested
in your own panel show?

1808
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,220
Seriously.

1809
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,721
What?

1810
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,817
I'll get back to you on that, Dan.

1811
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:56,582
- Excuse the robe.
- That's all right.

1812
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:59,380
First decent night's sleep I've had
in months. Would you like coffee?

1813
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:02,968
I thought I'd drop by before I head back
to Washington. I got a 10: 00 train.

1814
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,591
We're going to announce
our hearings later today.

1815
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,599
Oh, really?
As I exit the stage, you enter.

1816
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:12,139
Well, don't forget
the world's biggest classroom.

1817
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:16,314
Oh, that. Well, it's...
It's the world's biggest something.

1818
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:17,891
Uh...

1819
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:22,066
How do you like it, Dick?
You seem like a black coffee man.

1820
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,196
Yeah, black's fine.

1821
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,411
Here we go.

1822
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:32,246
A toast to

1823
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:34,957
escape.

1824
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,626
"It is the basket
in which the heart is caught

1825
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:44,251
"when down some awful Battlement
the rest of Life is dropt."

1826
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,585
King Baudouin.

1827
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:50,598
Emily Dickinson, actually.

1828
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,425
The one you lost on.

1829
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:55,804
Oh, that.

1830
01:34:55,899 --> 01:35:00,313
Well, it seems the Belgian Consulate
has formally protested my ignorance.

1831
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:05,609
Up at Cornwall, Charlie, your father
said he felt like Leopold, remember?

1832
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:09,109
You lost on one you knew.
Same as Stempel.

1833
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,702
Well, I...
I must have had a mental block.

1834
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:13,654
I was there last night.

1835
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,789
I could swear a smile crept across
your face when you lost.

1836
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:24,215
I wanted to get off the show.
You can understand that.

1837
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,303
I feel like I've been holding
my breath for 14 weeks.

1838
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:32,178
Why? What'd you think it was?

1839
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,352
Look, I spoke to the committee, okay?

1840
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:38,475
We're going to hold the hearings
without you.

1841
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:41,182
I am not out to destroy
you or your family.

1842
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,525
You go on and you live your life,

1843
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:43,818
- and God bless you.
- Okay.

1844
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:48,406
But I wanna know, man to man,
did you get the answers?

1845
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,823
- "Man to man"?
- Yeah, just between us.

1846
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,696
What is this?
Is this still that business with Stempel?

1847
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,533
I mean, Dan says he's not
the most reliable fellow.

1848
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:58,749
There's a problem, Charlie.

1849
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:01,168
I found another contestant,
a man named James Snodgrass.

1850
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,666
He says he got the answers, too.

1851
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,414
Are you sure
these people are telling the truth?

1852
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,215
He put the questions
in a sealed envelope

1853
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,005
and sent them to himself,
registered mail.

1854
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,548
That was two days before
he appeared on the show.

1855
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:10,845
That doesn't prove anything.

1856
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,554
You don't have to be a genius
to connect the dots.

1857
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:13,718
Don't connect them through me.

1858
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:16,552
Don't treat me like I'm some member
of your goddamned fan club.

1859
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:19,058
Are you telling me
everybody got the answers but you?

1860
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:21,104
You're so persistent. I envy that.

1861
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:22,398
Was it just the money?

1862
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:23,725
You'll forgive me,
but anyone that thinks

1863
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:25,567
money is ever just money
couldn't have much of it.

1864
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:29,239
You wanna insult me, fine.
But you can't envy me at the same time.

1865
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:33,781
Jesus. If someone offered you all this
money to be on some rigged quiz show,

1866
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,827
instant fame, would you do it?

1867
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:39,032
- No. Of course not.
- No, no.

1868
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:41,243
Throw the whole thing in.
Cover of <i>Time,</i> Dave Garroway,

1869
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:44,246
50,000 to read poetry on TV,
would you do it?

1870
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:47,878
No.

1871
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,379
And I would?

1872
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:58,013
Honestly, Dick.

1873
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:04,732
All right.

1874
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:08,437
Look, do me a favor.
Don't embarrass me.

1875
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:11,773
Keep your mouth shut. Don't say
anything. Don't talk to the papers.

1876
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:13,859
Just disappear for two weeks.

1877
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:16,365
Please, don't make me call you.

1878
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,127
More coffee, Dick?

1879
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:28,999
Nope. I better go.

1880
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,668
I don't wanna miss my train.

1881
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,725
The subcommittee
will be in order.

1882
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:45,106
The special Subcommittee
on Legislative Oversight

1883
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,942
was created pursuant to Section 136

1884
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:51,779
of the Legislative
Reorganization Act of 1946

1885
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:54,824
to conduct a general investigation
into the operation

1886
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:57,819
of the federal regulatory agencies.

1887
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:01,118
I'll ask if you were assisted in any way.
You answer, "Yes." I'll say, "How?"

1888
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:04,121
You say, "I was given the questions
and answers in advance."

1889
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:07,336
- Why don't you just sit on my pants?
- I'll ask, "Was this done routinely?"

1890
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:10,673
- You answer, "Yes."
- Not that tie. The television tie.

1891
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:16,629
We've gone over this five times already.

1892
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,635
Just try to relax.

1893
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:21,009
Be confident. Look at the Chairman
directly when you answer.

1894
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:24,392
Enough. You're worse than Enright.
I'm telling the truth.

1895
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:27,519
If they prefer to be lied to,
they can just turn on the television.

1896
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:28,858
There's a lot riding on this.

1897
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:32,312
You're telling me
there's a lot riding on it, yeah.

1898
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:35,156
- What do you think, Toby?
- What do I think about what?

1899
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,899
Ready to watch your husband
give 'em hell?

1900
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,359
I don't know
what you're gonna accomplish.

1901
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:39,819
As soon as Enright realizes...

1902
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:41,696
What do you want,
the two-tone or the oxford?

1903
01:38:41,707 --> 01:38:42,992
You should wear the oxford.

1904
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:47,334
When Enright realizes he's alone up
there and they're gonna cut him loose,

1905
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,329
he will implicate N BC and Geritol
like that,

1906
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:50,834
and believe me,
you're gonna see somethin'.

1907
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:53,587
I know what you're gonna accomplish.

1908
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,418
I just don't know
what he's gonna accomplish.

1909
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,926
You wanna know what? If I do
nothing else, I will convince them

1910
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:02,850
that Herbert Stempel knows what won
the goddamned Academy Award

1911
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:05,098
for best goddamned picture of 1955.

1912
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:08,101
- That's what I'm going to accomplish.
- I'm sick of all this.

1913
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:12,060
The subcommittee calls
Herbert Stempel.

1914
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:25,789
So, in other words,
you kept on winning.

1915
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:27,208
Yes, sir, that is correct.

1916
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:29,877
At any time
during this championship run,

1917
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,872
were you ever assisted in any way?

1918
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:35,049
I was given
the questions and answers in advance.

1919
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:38,260
Generally, I would receive the questions
and answers on Friday.

1920
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:40,759
Then we'd have sort of
a rehearsal on Monday.

1921
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:43,428
- This is from the very beginning?
- Yes.

1922
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:47,145
Dan Enright came to see me
in my kitchen and he said,

1923
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:51,975
"How'd you like to make $25,000?"
And I said, "Who wouldn't?"

1924
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:53,934
What do you mean by rehearsal?

1925
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:58,273
Well, for example, he told me how to
breathe heavily into the microphone

1926
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:00,733
and sigh such as this.

1927
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:07,990
He taught me how to stutter
and say in a plaintive voice,

1928
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:11,953
"I will take, nine... Nine points."

1929
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,295
It was all choreographed.

1930
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:16,587
How to bite my lip.
How to mop my brow.

1931
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:19,293
He told me specifically
not to smear my brow,

1932
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:21,512
but rather to pat for optimum effect.

1933
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:23,430
Of course, I'm shvitzing the whole time

1934
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:24,924
because they turned off
the air conditioning.

1935
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,972
Excuse me?

1936
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:30,809
- That's funny.
- Mr. Chairman.

1937
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,185
With your permission,
we might at this point,

1938
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,315
view a portion of the program,
<i>Twenty-One.</i>

1939
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:38,813
Whenever you're ready.

1940
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:52,285
<i>Herb Stempel, with your $69, 500</i>
<i>still at stake,</i>

1941
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:56,464
<i>although now at $2, 500 a point,</i>
<i>the category is...</i>

1942
01:40:57,635 --> 01:40:58,875
<i>Newspapers.</i>

1943
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:01,336
<i>How many points you wanna try for?</i>

1944
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:04,634
There. There's the lip biting.

1945
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:05,973
Yes, we see.

1946
01:41:06,936 --> 01:41:10,303
Finally, I was told to open my eyes

1947
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:12,805
and with a dazzling smile,
give the answer

1948
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,524
and explode when Jack Barry says,
"That is right."

1949
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:17,442
The Emporia Gazette?

1950
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,562
<i>That is right.</i>

1951
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:23,153
I don't know where he got it all.

1952
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:26,236
Some article on mass psychology
he read in <i>Esquire.</i>

1953
01:41:31,669 --> 01:41:34,411
<i>- I'll try eight points.</i>
- Watch Van Doren.

1954
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:38,589
- He's better at it than I am.
- Mr. Stempel, if I might refer you...

1955
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:41,383
Are you suggesting that
Charles Van Doren was also coached?

1956
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:42,505
Of course he got the answers.

1957
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,838
Why would they give me the answers
and not give him the answers?

1958
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,217
Why would they make me take a dive

1959
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:48,762
unless they knew
the other guy would get to 21?

1960
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:52,345
It's illogical. You don't fix one guy
without fixing the other guy.

1961
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:55,018
It's implausible, mathematically.

1962
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:58,400
<i>It would be,</i>
<i>and you have eight points.</i>

1963
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:01,695
You see? Look at him.
You see with the brow?

1964
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,860
Patting, not smearing.

1965
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:08,991
Mr. Stempel, have you ever received
any psychiatric treatment of any kind?

1966
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:11,409
What?

1967
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:15,501
- Mr. Stempel, I was wondering...
- Mr. Goodwin, please.

1968
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:19,756
Five sessions a week.
That's pretty extensive, isn't it?

1969
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:23,881
Well, I believe we can all use a little
help at various times in our lives.

1970
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:26,470
Is it possible that any of
your testimony is motivated

1971
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:30,550
by an irrational animosity
toward Mr. Enright?

1972
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,974
I don't know. If a man doesn't
live up to his agreement...

1973
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:36,602
A morbid fixation on Mr. Van Doren?

1974
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:39,604
If a man promises certain things
just to shut me up...

1975
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:43,438
"How'd you like to make $25,000?"
And you said, "Well, who wouldn't?"

1976
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:47,445
In retrospect, look at Van Doren.
I should've held out for a lot more.

1977
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:50,695
You prostituted
your intellectual ability for money.

1978
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:53,156
That's the difference
between me and Van Doren.

1979
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,241
I admit it. I have my morality.

1980
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:58,915
Charles Van Doren is a professor
at Columbia University.

1981
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:02,047
A Master's degree in astrophysics.

1982
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,591
A Ph. D. In literature.

1983
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:10,056
Hails from one of the most prominent
intellectual families in this country.

1984
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:13,764
Isn't it just possible, Mr. Stempel,

1985
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,396
that you got the answers and he didn't?

1986
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:29,821
So I told my husband,
"We really need a vacation."

1987
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:31,868
My husband says,
"What are you gonna do with the cat?"

1988
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:33,696
- Uh-huh.
- And I said, "I don't know."

1989
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,247
Good morning.

1990
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:37,867
Will you excuse us?

1991
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:43,464
Charlie, I'm Bob Kintner.

1992
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:45,712
- Oh.
- Don't get up.

1993
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:48,465
- It's about time we met.
- Hi. It's a pleasure.

1994
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:52,181
This whole quiz show mess,
and hearings and all that.

1995
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:55,135
I've been following that in the paper.

1996
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:59,017
Well, our legal department
has prepared this for you.

1997
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:11,067
We'd like you to hold
a press conference.

1998
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:15,238
Oh, there's a split infinitive
here in the second paragraph.

1999
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,450
Shall I schedule it?

2000
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,916
Well, look, um...

2001
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:24,747
I haven't been subpoenaed,

2002
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:27,379
and I can't think of
anything that'd sound guiltier

2003
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:31,054
than a man who hasn't been accused
of anything protesting his innocence.

2004
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:38,849
Charlie, speculation in our society
has a way of becoming fact.

2005
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:44,567
Television is a public trust.

2006
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:48,897
We can't afford even a hint of
a scandal in our company.

2007
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:55,032
Well, I... I'd rather not do it.

2008
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:57,241
I'm sorry.

2009
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:01,409
Haven't we been good to you?

2010
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:06,164
Haven't we treated you
like part of our family?

2011
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:11,673
We have great expectations
for you, Charlie.

2012
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:16,928
I know you're gonna do the right thing.

2013
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:42,783
- I'm sorry, Mr. Van Doren.
- Is he in?

2014
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:46,086
- He's gone, Mr. Van Doren.
- He's gone to Washington?

2015
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:48,793
Mr. Freedman's gone to Mexico.

2016
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:56,638
I still don't understand

2017
01:45:56,725 --> 01:45:58,841
how you can hold a quiz show hearing
without Van Doren.

2018
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:01,803
Van Doren had no contact
with NBC or Geritol.

2019
01:46:01,814 --> 01:46:03,099
Don't you understand,

2020
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:05,314
they deal with Enright.
Enright's the key here.

2021
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:07,642
The key to what?
The jury hears the public.

2022
01:46:07,736 --> 01:46:09,272
The public doesn't know Dan Enright.

2023
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:11,274
The purpose is not to
reform the souls of the contestants.

2024
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,772
The purpose is to reform TV.

2025
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:14,614
It's like the Barenblatt and
the Sweezy cases.

2026
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:15,817
You don't wanna call him.

2027
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:18,323
Fine, Dick. Just don't patronize me
with your legal bullshit.

2028
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:19,824
She's got a point, Dick.

2029
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:22,289
Bob, maybe it's time for you to go home.

2030
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,332
How'd you like Dick's steak
done, Bob? Medium?

2031
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:26,452
There's absolutely no need to
drag the man into the spotlight.

2032
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,203
You dragged Herb Stempel in.

2033
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,664
The man has to be

2034
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:31,840
dragged from the spotlight
with his teethmarks still on it.

2035
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:33,042
Yeah, well, nobody forced

2036
01:46:33,137 --> 01:46:35,344
Charles Van Doren to go in front of
50 million people either.

2037
01:46:35,431 --> 01:46:38,798
This is not McCarthyism. We are not
here to expose for the sake of exposing.

2038
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:42,051
- This is not the point.
- That is the point. That is not your point.

2039
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:45,684
You are ten times the man
Charles Van Doren is.

2040
01:46:45,774 --> 01:46:49,141
Ten times the brain
and ten times the human being.

2041
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,852
Meanwhile, you're bending
over backwards for him.

2042
01:46:51,864 --> 01:46:54,526
You are like the Uncle Tom of the Jews.

2043
01:46:56,035 --> 01:46:58,196
I'm glad it's so easy for you
to destroy a man's life.

2044
01:46:58,203 --> 01:46:59,534
I'll have to keep that in mind.

2045
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,488
Bob, sit down.

2046
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,533
The quiz show hearings
without Van Doren

2047
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:08,620
is like doing <i>Hamlet</i> without Hamlet.

2048
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:14,882
The Chairman's instructions

2049
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,211
are for me to get you up there
as promptly as possible.

2050
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:19,383
The questions are to take
no longer than 15 minutes.

2051
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:21,006
You're to receive
the questions in advance,

2052
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:24,389
and I'm to thank you for the courtesy
of attending this hearing.

2053
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:31,104
Mercy. What a grueling line of inquiry.

2054
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:35,238
Must have a familiar ring,
the questions in advance.

2055
01:47:38,077 --> 01:47:40,819
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

2056
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,873
Take this, please. Thank you.

2057
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:51,540
Young man...

2058
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:54,920
The ratings went up if the same
contestant came back week after week.

2059
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:58,169
There was only one way for that
to happen. You had to know that.

2060
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:02,556
Young man, I sell over $ 14 million
a year worth of Geritol.

2061
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:05,551
Geritol. That's the kind
of businessman I am.

2062
01:48:05,688 --> 01:48:09,101
That show, <i>Twenty-One,</i> cost me three
and a half million year in, year out.

2063
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:12,692
Sales went up 50%
when Van Doren was on. 50%.

2064
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:18,823
So the very idea that I was unaware of
every detail of that show's operation,

2065
01:48:19,535 --> 01:48:21,617
frankly, it's very insulting.

2066
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,451
- So you knew.
- That's even more insulting.

2067
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:25,279
- You had to know...
- It's not about what I know.

2068
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:26,325
It's about what you know.

2069
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:27,907
You don't know what I know.

2070
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,954
You know that Dan Enright
ran a crooked quiz show.

2071
01:48:29,962 --> 01:48:31,327
He never informed you?

2072
01:48:33,424 --> 01:48:34,630
Did he?

2073
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:36,673
Let's see what he says.

2074
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:42,005
Dan? Look, Dan Enright wants
a future in television, okay?

2075
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:45,262
You have to understand that the public
has a very short memory.

2076
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:47,468
But corporations, they never forget.

2077
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:50,141
He's not that stupid.
He knows he's through.

2078
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:54,392
No. He'll be back. NBC is gonna go on.
Geritol's gonna go on.

2079
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:57,440
Makes me wonder what you hope
to accomplish with all this.

2080
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:59,362
Don't worry. I'm just gettin' started.

2081
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:02,612
Even the quiz shows'll be back.
Why fix them?

2082
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:04,034
Think about it.

2083
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:07,113
You could do exactly the same thing
by just making the questions easier.

2084
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,367
The audience didn't tune in

2085
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:11,292
to watch some amazing
display of intellectual ability.

2086
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:17,002
They just wanted to watch the money.

2087
01:49:17,009 --> 01:49:19,625
Imagine if they could watch you.

2088
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:26,803
You're a bright young kid with a bright
future. Watch yourself out there.

2089
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:29,803
I turned in my clubs after that day.

2090
01:49:29,897 --> 01:49:32,183
Well, you weren't too good
when you were out on the links

2091
01:49:32,274 --> 01:49:33,514
with me that day.

2092
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:35,311
I can't wait to get you out there again.

2093
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:39,152
- Stuck in that sand trap for an hour.
- No more for me.

2094
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:42,648
Would you state your name
and profession?

2095
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:44,654
My name is Robert Kintner.

2096
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:47,152
I'm the president of the
National Broadcasting Company.

2097
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:50,739
My name is Martin Rittenhome.
I run Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.

2098
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:53,496
I take that responsibility
very seriously, Congressman.

2099
01:49:53,504 --> 01:49:56,496
We immediately commenced
our own internal investigation.

2100
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:59,332
To ferret out this corruption
wherever it may exist.

2101
01:49:59,343 --> 01:50:02,210
Nobody brought the article
in <i>Time</i> magazine to your attention?

2102
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:04,382
I was in Europe. I didn't see it.

2103
01:50:04,973 --> 01:50:06,759
You didn't see it. You were traveling.

2104
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,511
I didn't see it.
I was traveling at the time.

2105
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:11,056
You sure you never asked
about particular contestants

2106
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:12,852
or about the ratings, nothing?

2107
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:14,346
That was their department.

2108
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:17,191
I relied on the excellent reputation
of Dan Enright.

2109
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:19,936
Dan Enright was more in the nature
of an independent contractor.

2110
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:22,612
Do you remember what you thought
when you found out?

2111
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:24,030
I was as shocked as you are. I mean,

2112
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:25,904
this was a terrible thing to do
to the American people.

2113
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:28,197
I never, never imagined

2114
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:31,746
they could perpetrate this fraud
on the American public.

2115
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:35,709
I'd like to say one other thing. I
think all that money should be returned.

2116
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:39,539
Mr. Goodwin, any further questions?

2117
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:44,339
No, sir, thank you. No further questions.

2118
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:50,299
<i>On behalf of the subcommittee,</i>

2119
01:50:50,394 --> 01:50:52,601
<i>I wish to thank you</i>
<i>for your appearance</i>

2120
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:55,225
<i>and your testimony here.</i>

2121
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:07,482
Van Doren's made a statement.

2122
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:11,787
I look like the mark in a shell game
here, and you look like the shill.

2123
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:14,281
- Sir, if you...
- Shut up.

2124
01:51:14,293 --> 01:51:15,749
When is Van Doren coming here?

2125
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:18,077
- I don't see him on the schedule.
- He's not on the schedule.

2126
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:20,629
Wait a minute. We discussed this.
The contestants are not the villains.

2127
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,839
We were gonna only bring in the ones
who would come in voluntarily.

2128
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:24,587
All I know is in the last hour,

2129
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,132
I've gotten over 200 telegrams
from people askin' me

2130
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:29,926
why I won't let poor
Charles Van Doren defend himself.

2131
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:33,175
I've got every woman in Arkadelphia
squealin' like a pig under a gate.

2132
01:51:33,312 --> 01:51:34,802
Let me tell you somethin'.
These women vote.

2133
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:36,474
I cannot believe this.

2134
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:38,271
Where is Albert Freedman?

2135
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:40,098
The marshals are bringing him
back from Mexico.

2136
01:51:40,402 --> 01:51:41,858
By what? By mule?

2137
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:44,687
Sir, please, just tell me
what it is that he said.

2138
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:48,945
"Mr. Van Doren made himself
available to the subcommittee staff.

2139
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:51,614
"He has advised them at no time
was he supplied

2140
01:51:51,622 --> 01:51:54,455
"with any questions, answers..."

2141
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:21,185
That statement of yours
took me a bit by surprise.

2142
01:52:21,276 --> 01:52:23,312
I know. I know. We had a deal.

2143
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:26,736
I asked myself, "Why would he make
a statement like that?

2144
01:52:27,074 --> 01:52:30,487
"He knows I'll come after him."

2145
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:33,201
But then it occurred to me.

2146
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:36,072
He knows I'll come after him.

2147
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:42,411
I can't decide if you think
too much of me or too little.

2148
01:52:42,714 --> 01:52:45,922
Charlie, I wanna think the best of you.

2149
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:48,625
Everyone does.

2150
01:52:48,804 --> 01:52:51,511
That's your curse.

2151
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,508
- Did you bring a subpoena?
- Right here.

2152
01:52:58,355 --> 01:53:00,220
Well?

2153
01:53:02,859 --> 01:53:05,896
I remember five, six years ago,
my Uncle Harold told my aunt

2154
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:07,860
about this affair he had.

2155
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:10,189
It was a sort of mildly
upsetting event in my family.

2156
01:53:10,284 --> 01:53:12,115
Mmm-hmm. Mildly?

2157
01:53:12,286 --> 01:53:14,197
You have to put it in context.

2158
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:17,075
The thing of it is, the affair
was over like eight years.

2159
01:53:17,082 --> 01:53:21,451
So, I remember askin' him, "Why'd you
tell her? You got away with it."

2160
01:53:21,586 --> 01:53:24,669
I'll never forget what he said.

2161
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:28,874
It was the "getting away with it"
part he couldn't live with.

2162
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,754
I might take that chance.

2163
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:40,894
A chance is what I'm givin' ya.

2164
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,437
- Don Quixote is life.
- I still don't see

2165
01:53:46,445 --> 01:53:51,235
how this old guy with a horse and a fat
old sidekick can think he's a knight.

2166
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:53,903
It means if you wanna be
a knight, act like a knight.

2167
01:53:53,994 --> 01:53:55,734
Okay.

2168
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:58,741
Act like a knight? You act like a knight.

2169
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:01,289
I am a knight.

2170
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:02,741
I shall miss them.

2171
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,452
What is this?
That retirement business again?

2172
01:54:05,464 --> 01:54:08,627
That'd be like a snail
retiring from his shell.

2173
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:13,586
I can't go on doing this forever.
It's for you now, Charlie.

2174
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,763
So, what's the news? Did you
read Norman Mailer in <i>Dissent?</i>

2175
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,590
I only glanced at it.

2176
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:22,762
Everyone's talking about it. They don't
know whether he's a genius or a fool.

2177
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,931
Have you heard there's this
congressional committee that's...

2178
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:28,062
Well, they're investigating
the quiz shows.

2179
01:54:28,153 --> 01:54:30,269
I read that. What's it about?

2180
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,817
Well, evidently,
certain of the contestants

2181
01:54:32,908 --> 01:54:35,490
were given the answers in advance.

2182
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:39,703
Cheating on a quiz show.
That's like plagiarizing a comic strip.

2183
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:42,532
Well, at any rate, it seems
the committee wants to call me

2184
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:43,832
to testify.

2185
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:47,544
Oh, I've testified before.
Funding for the arts. It's nothing.

2186
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:51,540
- I think this is a little different.
- You'll run circles round them.

2187
01:54:51,676 --> 01:54:54,258
It's not exactly Jefferson
and Lincoln down there anymore.

2188
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:56,549
I think this is a little different.

2189
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:59,514
I'd think you'd be glad
at a chance to clear your name.

2190
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:00,966
Otherwise, people might believe...

2191
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:04,098
People will believe whatever they
want to believe. That's not the issue.

2192
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:07,021
Just tell 'em the truth. You'll do fine.

2193
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:09,892
The real issue, Charlie,
is how this keeps distracting you

2194
01:55:10,028 --> 01:55:11,017
from your teaching.

2195
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:14,362
This and that program in the morning,
though you insist that it doesn't.

2196
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:17,324
Dad, I can't simply just tell 'em the truth.

2197
01:55:20,205 --> 01:55:22,696
Can't tell them the truth?

2198
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:25,324
Why on earth not?

2199
01:55:25,961 --> 01:55:27,292
It's complicated.

2200
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:30,329
Complicated?

2201
01:55:30,632 --> 01:55:33,965
Yeah, I can't. I...

2202
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:37,210
Charlie, from what I understand,
it's just this bunch of frauds

2203
01:55:37,305 --> 01:55:40,263
showing off an erudition
they didn't really have.

2204
01:55:40,976 --> 01:55:42,841
- All you have to do...
- The problem is

2205
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:45,769
it seems I was one of those frauds.

2206
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:49,355
What?

2207
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:00,567
What... What do you mean?

2208
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:04,325
They gave me the answers.

2209
01:56:04,749 --> 01:56:07,616
They gave you the answers.

2210
01:56:08,795 --> 01:56:10,535
They gave you the answers.

2211
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:12,871
Well... No, no.

2212
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:16,421
At first, they asked me questions they
already knew I knew the answers to.

2213
01:56:16,428 --> 01:56:18,089
We ran through those, and I still
didn't want them

2214
01:56:18,096 --> 01:56:19,552
to give me the answers,

2215
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:22,597
so I had them give me questions
and I'd go look up the answers,

2216
01:56:22,726 --> 01:56:24,057
as if that were any different.

2217
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:26,176
We ran through those
in a couple of weeks.

2218
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:29,638
Then I just didn't have the time.
Finally, it just seemed silly.

2219
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:33,726
They gave you all that money to answer
questions they knew you knew?

2220
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:36,399
- Now, that's inflation.
- You're not being very helpful.

2221
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:38,731
I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm an old man.

2222
01:56:38,825 --> 01:56:40,565
It's all a little difficult
for me to comprehend.

2223
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,242
It's television, Dad. It's just television.

2224
01:56:43,246 --> 01:56:45,111
You make it sound like
you didn't have a choice.

2225
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:46,454
What was I supposed
to do at that point?

2226
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:47,951
Disillusion the whole
goddamn country?

2227
01:56:47,959 --> 01:56:50,826
- You took the money.
- Yes, I know. I took the money.

2228
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:55,039
- Is that what this was about?
- No. No. I don't know.

2229
01:56:55,425 --> 01:56:58,132
It was a goddamned quiz show, Charlie.

2230
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:01,628
- "An ill-favored thing, sir."
- This is not the time to play games.

2231
01:57:01,723 --> 01:57:06,308
- "But mine own." It was mine.
- Your name is mine.

2232
01:57:21,409 --> 01:57:24,116
Charlie.

2233
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:31,829
I'm sorry.

2234
01:57:33,129 --> 01:57:35,620
I'm really sorry, Dad.

2235
01:57:36,967 --> 01:57:39,174
You'll be

2236
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:44,296
dragged into all this, you and Mother.

2237
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:48,967
Oh, my God, Charlie.

2238
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:52,767
How are you gonna tell that committee?

2239
01:57:55,527 --> 01:57:57,563
Will you come down there with me?

2240
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:05,491
<i>The, uh, subcommittee</i>
<i>calls Charles Van Doren.</i>

2241
01:58:30,478 --> 01:58:32,890
Photographers will please
clear the room.

2242
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:37,227
- Will you please state your name?
- Charles Van Doren.

2243
01:58:37,235 --> 01:58:39,692
I've gotta get in there.
I've gotta get in there.

2244
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:41,903
Excuse me, sir.

2245
01:58:41,906 --> 01:58:45,023
Wait a minute.
Hey, you, come back here.

2246
01:58:45,035 --> 01:58:46,525
<i>Do you solemnly swear</i>
<i>that the testimony</i>

2247
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,531
<i>you are about to give will be the truth,</i>

2248
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:50,779
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

2249
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:51,863
I do.

2250
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:01,923
Now, we are advised that you have

2251
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:06,216
a prepared statement that you would
prefer to give at the outset?

2252
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:08,634
Yes, sir.
Might I first have a glass of water?

2253
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:10,181
Of course you may.

2254
01:59:21,738 --> 01:59:23,478
You may proceed.

2255
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:35,828
I would give almost anything I have

2256
01:59:35,919 --> 01:59:39,252
to reverse the course of my life
in the last year.

2257
01:59:41,216 --> 01:59:44,504
The past doesn't change for anyone.

2258
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:47,927
But at least I can learn from the past.

2259
01:59:49,307 --> 01:59:52,174
I've learned a lot about life.

2260
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:54,934
I've learned a lot about myself

2261
01:59:56,439 --> 02:00:00,398
and about the responsibilities
any man has to his fellow men.

2262
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,439
I've learned a lot about good and evil.

2263
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:06,608
They're not always
what they appear to be.

2264
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:13,286
I was involved,

2265
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:17,457
deeply involved, in a deception.

2266
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:21,081
I have deceived my friends.

2267
02:00:22,966 --> 02:00:26,299
And I had millions of them.

2268
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:35,634
I lied to the American people.

2269
02:00:37,063 --> 02:00:42,558
I lied about what I knew, and then
I lied about what I did not know.

2270
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:47,854
In a sense, I was like a child

2271
02:00:47,866 --> 02:00:50,949
who refuses to admit a fact
in the hope that it'll go away.

2272
02:00:52,662 --> 02:00:55,654
Of course it did not go away.

2273
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,991
I was scared,

2274
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:02,084
scared to death.

2275
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:05,042
I had no solid position.

2276
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:08,337
No basis to stand on for myself.

2277
02:01:08,428 --> 02:01:13,548
There was one way out and that was
simply to tell the truth.

2278
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:19,727
It may sound trite to you,

2279
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:22,977
but I've found myself again
after a number of years.

2280
02:01:24,861 --> 02:01:27,819
I've been acting a role,

2281
02:01:29,866 --> 02:01:32,699
maybe all my life,
of thinking I've done more,

2282
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:37,328
accomplished more,
produced more than I have.

2283
02:01:39,375 --> 02:01:42,412
I have had all the breaks.

2284
02:01:45,548 --> 02:01:47,630
I have stood on the shoulders of life,

2285
02:01:47,717 --> 02:01:51,255
and I've never gotten down
into the dirt to build,

2286
02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:54,345
to erect a foundation of my own.

2287
02:01:56,351 --> 02:01:59,468
I have flown too high
on borrowed wings.

2288
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:05,857
Everything came too easy.

2289
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:10,862
That is why I am here today.

2290
02:02:19,666 --> 02:02:21,782
Mr. Van Doren,

2291
02:02:22,085 --> 02:02:25,248
I want to compliment you
for that statement.

2292
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:28,830
Thank you, sir.

2293
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:32,801
Mr. Van Doren, I would like to join
the Chairman in commending you

2294
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:38,469
for the soul-searching fortitude
displayed in your statement.

2295
02:02:38,476 --> 02:02:41,809
- Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
- Mr. Van Doren,

2296
02:02:41,813 --> 02:02:43,929
I just wanna add my kudos.

2297
02:02:44,524 --> 02:02:48,187
I have listened to many
witnesses, in both civil

2298
02:02:48,278 --> 02:02:50,018
and criminal matters,

2299
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:53,196
and yours is the most
soul-searching confession

2300
02:02:53,283 --> 02:02:55,524
I think I've heard in a long time.

2301
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:57,609
Thank you, sir.

2302
02:02:57,787 --> 02:03:00,073
Mr. Van Doren,

2303
02:03:00,874 --> 02:03:04,458
I'm also from New York,
a different part of New York.

2304
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,459
I'm happy
that you've made the statement,

2305
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:09,788
but I cannot agree
with most of my colleagues.

2306
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:14,885
You see, I don't think an adult of your
intelligence ought to be commended

2307
02:03:14,971 --> 02:03:17,963
for simply at long last telling the truth.

2308
02:03:51,049 --> 02:03:56,260
If the committee has nothing to add,
Mr. Van Doren, you are dismissed.

2309
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:06,891
Charlie. Over here.

2310
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:20,738
Let him out, boys.

2311
02:04:29,629 --> 02:04:32,041
The subcommittee will come to order.

2312
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:37,209
Our next witness will be
Mr. Daniel Enright.

2313
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:47,931
Charles, you're gonna have to
answer some questions.

2314
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:49,179
Okay, one at a time.

2315
02:04:49,565 --> 02:04:52,272
- How do you feel, Charlie?
- Relieved.

2316
02:04:52,443 --> 02:04:55,025
...the truth, the whole truth and
nothin' but the truth, so help you God?

2317
02:04:55,113 --> 02:04:57,195
- I do.
- Who helped you write that statement?

2318
02:04:57,323 --> 02:04:59,405
Did you know you'd been fired by N BC?

2319
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:01,987
No, I didn't know.

2320
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:03,951
What do you have to say
to the young people?

2321
02:05:03,955 --> 02:05:05,661
Are you proud of your son?

2322
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:08,907
- I've always been proud of Charlie.
- Proud of what he did?

2323
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:12,327
The most important thing now is for
Charlie to get back to his teaching.

2324
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:14,583
Did you know Columbia trustees
are meeting right now?

2325
02:05:14,799 --> 02:05:16,915
They're going to ask
for Charlie's resignation.

2326
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:22,633
Professor Van Doren, you spent
your whole career at Columbia.

2327
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:24,631
What's your reaction to that?

2328
02:05:26,102 --> 02:05:27,967
Prof. Van Doren?

2329
02:05:31,607 --> 02:05:33,814
Dad, go ahead with Mother.
I'll meet you outside.

2330
02:05:33,943 --> 02:05:36,059
- No reaction.
- Charles, a few more questions.

2331
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:42,239
Did the network or sponsor
bring pressure on you

2332
02:05:42,326 --> 02:05:45,238
to bring the same contestant
back week after week?

2333
02:05:45,329 --> 02:05:46,739
No, sir.

2334
02:05:47,123 --> 02:05:49,114
Did they express any approval

2335
02:05:49,125 --> 02:05:51,241
or disapproval
of any particular contestant?

2336
02:05:51,794 --> 02:05:53,785
Never. Not to me.

2337
02:05:54,297 --> 02:05:55,377
Were they aware

2338
02:05:55,465 --> 02:05:58,923
that you were supplying
the contestants with the answers?

2339
02:06:00,344 --> 02:06:04,257
No, sir.
They had no knowledge whatsoever.

2340
02:06:04,474 --> 02:06:08,717
Herb Stempel. Herbie, how 'bout
a picture, you and Van Doren together?

2341
02:06:08,811 --> 02:06:11,018
No. Not now. Christ, look at the guy.

2342
02:06:11,105 --> 02:06:12,311
Come on, the both of you.

2343
02:06:12,398 --> 02:06:14,354
You know what the problem
with you bums is?

2344
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:17,021
You never leave a guy alone
unless you're leaving him alone.

2345
02:06:17,028 --> 02:06:19,565
- Who do you blame, Charlie?
- Professor, one more shot.

2346
02:06:20,698 --> 02:06:22,313
Did you feel the committee
treated you fairly?

2347
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:24,566
How'd the pressure up there
compare to <i>Twenty-One?</i>

2348
02:06:24,702 --> 02:06:28,615
So you freely admit that
you helped rig these shows?

2349
02:06:28,706 --> 02:06:31,322
- What else could we do?
- Congratulations.

2350
02:06:31,417 --> 02:06:33,499
- For what?
- Van Doren.

2351
02:06:34,045 --> 02:06:37,503
I thought we were gonna get television.

2352
02:06:38,174 --> 02:06:42,008
The truth is television is gonna get us.

2353
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:47,847
And you obviously
don't think you did anything wrong.

2354
02:06:47,975 --> 02:06:51,888
Yes, we did one thing
wrong. We were too successful.

2355
02:06:52,021 --> 02:06:54,012
<i>You were too successful.</i>

2356
02:06:54,023 --> 02:06:57,390
<i>Those advertising dollars</i>
<i>came from somewhere.</i>

2357
02:06:57,527 --> 02:06:59,392
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>the newspapers and magazines</i>

2358
02:06:59,403 --> 02:07:01,064
<i>are making such a big thing about this?</i>

2359
02:07:01,739 --> 02:07:03,695
<i>Mr. Enright,</i>

2360
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:06,532
<i>you make it sound like</i>
<i>you are the victim here.</i>

2361
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:09,201
<i>The sponsor makes out,</i>
<i>the network makes out,</i>

2362
02:07:09,539 --> 02:07:13,031
<i>the contestants see money</i>
<i>they would never see in a lifetime</i>

2363
02:07:13,042 --> 02:07:14,407
<i>and the public is entertained.</i>

2364
02:07:14,544 --> 02:07:16,409
<i>So who gets hurt?</i>

2365
02:07:24,679 --> 02:07:26,465
<i>Mr. Freedman,</i>

2366
02:07:26,556 --> 02:07:30,925
<i>you freely admit that</i>
<i>you helped rig these shows?</i>

2367
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:34,678
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>- "Yes, sir"? That's it?</i>

2368
02:07:35,898 --> 02:07:38,605
<i>Well, sir,</i>
<i>I don't know what else to say.</i>

2369
02:07:38,734 --> 02:07:42,898
<i>Give the public what they want.</i>
<i>It's like your business.</i>

2370
02:07:43,072 --> 02:07:48,112
<i>Do you see a need</i>
<i>for government regulation in this area?</i>

2371
02:07:48,244 --> 02:07:51,532
<i>You know, it's not like</i>
<i>the quiz shows are a public utility, sir.</i>

2372
02:07:51,622 --> 02:07:53,783
<i>It's entertainment.</i>

2373
02:07:53,916 --> 02:07:56,328
<i>We're not exactly</i>
<i>hardened criminals here.</i>

2374
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:59,452
<i>We're in show business.</i>

2375
02:08:43,633 --> 02:08:46,670
<i>See the shark with</i>

2376
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:50,469
<i>Teeth like razors</i>

2377
02:08:50,973 --> 02:08:53,840
<i>You can read his</i>

2378
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,267
<i>Open face</i>

2379
02:08:58,189 --> 02:09:00,305
<i>And Macheath</i>

2380
02:09:00,316 --> 02:09:04,650
<i>He's got a knife, but</i>

2381
02:09:05,738 --> 02:09:07,820
<i>Not in such</i>

2382
02:09:07,823 --> 02:09:12,192
<i>An obvious place</i>

2383
02:09:13,037 --> 02:09:15,403
<i>On a beautiful</i>

2384
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:19,327
<i>Blue Sunday</i>

2385
02:09:20,211 --> 02:09:22,327
<i>See the corpse</i>

2386
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:26,338
<i>Stretched in the Strand</i>

2387
02:09:27,343 --> 02:09:31,256
<i>See a man dodge</i>

2388
02:09:31,347 --> 02:09:33,679
<i>Round the corner</i>

2389
02:09:34,725 --> 02:09:37,341
<i>Mackie's friends will</i>

2390
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:41,061
<i>Understand</i>

2391
02:09:42,316 --> 02:09:43,522
<i>Mr. Meier</i>

2392
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:47,856
<i>Reported missing</i>

2393
02:09:49,115 --> 02:09:51,356
<i>Like so many</i>

2394
02:09:52,493 --> 02:09:55,030
<i>Wealthy men</i>

2395
02:09:56,247 --> 02:09:57,908
<i>Mack the Knife</i>

2396
02:09:57,999 --> 02:10:02,368
<i>Acquired his cash box</i>

2397
02:10:03,337 --> 02:10:06,750
<i>God alone knows</i>

2398
02:10:06,841 --> 02:10:09,924
<i>How or when</i>

2399
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,802
<i>Jenny Towler</i>

2400
02:10:13,264 --> 02:10:16,347
<i>She turned up lately</i>

2401
02:10:17,351 --> 02:10:19,842
<i>With a knife stuck</i>

2402
02:10:20,604 --> 02:10:23,266
<i>Through her breast</i>

2403
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:26,098
<i>While Macheath</i>

2404
02:10:26,193 --> 02:10:30,186
<i>He walks the Embankment</i>

2405
02:10:30,948 --> 02:10:34,532
<i>Nonchalantly</i>

2406
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:37,360
<i>Unimpressed</i>

2407
02:10:38,289 --> 02:10:40,405
<i>And the ghastly</i>

2408
02:10:41,375 --> 02:10:44,242
<i>Fire in Soho</i>

2409
02:10:44,795 --> 02:10:47,878
<i>Seven children</i>

2410
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:50,714
<i>At a go</i>

2411
02:10:51,802 --> 02:10:54,965
<i>In the crowd stands</i>

2412
02:10:55,056 --> 02:10:57,968
<i>Mack the Knife, but</i>

2413
02:10:58,059 --> 02:11:00,425
<i>He isn't asked</i>

2414
02:11:01,437 --> 02:11:04,349
<i>He doesn't know</i>

2415
02:11:05,608 --> 02:11:08,441
<i>And the child-bride</i>

2416
02:11:08,903 --> 02:11:11,815
<i>In her nightgown</i>

2417
02:11:12,406 --> 02:11:15,148
<i>Whose assailant's</i>

<i>Still at large</i>

2419
02:11:19,163 --> 02:11:22,155
<i>Violated</i>

<i>In her slumbers</i>

2421
02:11:25,836 --> 02:11:28,373
<i>Mackie, how much</i>

2422
02:11:29,006 --> 02:11:32,248
<i>Did you charge?</i>

2423
02:11:32,635 --> 02:11:35,627
<i>Yes, the child-bride</i>

2424
02:11:36,097 --> 02:11:39,305
<i>In her nightgown</i>

<i>In her slumbers</i>

02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:56,147
<i>Mackie, how much</i>

2430
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:59,696
<i>Did you charge?</i>

2431
02:11:59,787 --> 02:12:03,325
<i>Mackie, how much did you charge?</i>

2432
02:12:03,332 --> 02:12:09,919
<i>How much did you charge?</i>

2433
02:12:10,214 --> 02:12:13,627
<i>How much did you charge?</i>

2434
02:12:14,051 --> 02:12:18,420
<i>How much did you charge?</i>
