1
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,139
Monsieur Brunner.

2
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,420
Honey, I' m home.

3
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,429
Roger that.
Copy at the boathouse.

4
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:35,897
Right on time.

5
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,902
Faisil, get your butt in here.
Harry's inside.

6
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,461
Yeah, yeah.
I'm coming. I' m coming.

7
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:47,947
- Were you born in a barn?
- Whorehouse.

8
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,012
Uh-huh.

9
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:56,581
You got your fur coat
razor blade there...

10
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:58,889
and a bunch of guys with guns.

11
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:00,054
Hmm.

12
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,190
I'm switching to sub-vocal now.

13
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:06,795
Check, check.

14
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:10,035
It' s talk radio.
You're on the air.

15
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:29,187
That guard nearest to you
is moving away.

16
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,637
He's at the service door.
He's inside.

17
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,416
Excusez-moi. Monsieur?

18
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:23,933
All right.
Have you seen Khaled yet?

19
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:28,269
Yep. There he is.

20
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:30,707
How come billionaires
are always short?

21
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:32,903
Jamal...

22
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,245
Excuse me.

23
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:46,454
Colonel, how are you?
It's so good to see you again.

24
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:48,930
- It' s been a long time.
- Terrific.

25
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,296
Who was that guy?

26
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:54,870
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

27
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:57,937
You should be crossing
the main foyer...

28
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,467
heading for the stairs.

29
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:00,911
Mm-hmm.

30
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:08,152
OK, keep moving. Keep moving.

31
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:19,629
I' m in the library...

32
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,070
and I' m heading out
to the second floor balcony.

33
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:18,132
Modem in place.

34
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:20,741
Transmitting now.

35
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,977
Affirmatory.
It's a good hookup.

36
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:28,285
These are encrypted files.
It'll take a few minutes.

37
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,961
Uh-huh. I got your password.

38
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,071
Magnificent, isn't it?

39
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:15,410
Yes, quite.

40
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:17,882
I thought I knew
most of Khaled's friends...

41
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,386
but I don't believe
I've met you before.

42
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,220
No, we haven't met.
I certainly would remember.

43
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:25,658
Renquist, Harry Renquist.

44
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,925
Juno Skinner.

45
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:31,764
Juno Skinner. Juno Skinner.

46
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,235
Come on. Come on.

47
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,796
Juno Skinner,
arts and antiquities dealer...

48
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,275
specializing in Ancient Persia.

49
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:41,438
This is Persian,
if I' m not mistaken.

50
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,917
Very good.
6th century B.C., to be exact.

51
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,821
Do you like the period?

52
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,982
Oh, I adore it.

53
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:57,125
Alarm! Alarm!

54
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,604
Harry, we got a problem. Guards
are going apeshit down there.

55
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:03,641
Acquired
most of these pieces for Jamal.

56
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:06,007
Do you tango?

57
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,706
Mmm. Oh!

58
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,544
Tango?

59
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,451
Harry? You do not
have time to tango, buddy.

60
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,887
You copy?

61
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,476
Don't be stopping
to smell the roses now.

62
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,544
You got to get out of there.

63
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:09,579
Yes! Files are unlocked!

64
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,491
Fast Faisil strikes again.
I'm in. I' m down, baby.

65
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,928
I got my hand up her dress,
and I am going for...

66
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,864
Just copy the goddamn files, OK?

67
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:49,005
Wow. And I thought
this was just going to be...

68
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,771
another bunch of boring bankers
and oil billionaires.

69
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,747
Harry, seconds count, buddy.
Ditch the bitch.

70
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,013
Unfortunately, I have to leave.

71
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:01,282
I have a plane to catch.

72
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,516
Oh.

73
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,962
Well... call me sometime.

74
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:09,464
My offices are in Rome.

75
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,524
I would like that.

76
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,969
Son of a bitch
is with her two minutes...

77
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,849
and she's ready
to bear his children.

78
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,247
All right, twinkle toes,
what's your exit strategy?

79
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,914
I' m going to walk
right out of the front gate.

80
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,288
Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy.

81
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:37,967
Sir?

82
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,469
May I see
your invitation, please?

83
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:41,904
Sure. Here's my invitation.

84
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,718
Aw, shit. Here we go.

85
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:54,983
- Slight change in plans.
- Hal

86
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,470
Stay.

87
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:36,238
We're en route
to the lower rendezvous point.

88
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:37,935
I repeat...
backup rendezvous point.

89
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:40,237
Watch it! Watch it!

90
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:43,407
It' s called ice,
and it gets a little slick.

91
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,100
Harry, do you copy? Whoa.

92
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,472
I got it.

93
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,469
Shit!

94
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:08,707
Whoops!

95
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,318
Aah!

96
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:55,762
Oh, my God.

97
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:57,866
Whoa!
I got it, I got it, I got it.

98
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:01,607
- There he is!
- Shit!

99
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:03,706
Hi, guys.

100
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:09,821
Oh, yeah, that worked good.
Right out the old front gate.

101
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,052
Can you lean back a second?

102
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:16,123
Let's go.
We can still make our flight.

103
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:31,951
All right,
that's it for Mr. Renquist.

104
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,179
OK, go.

105
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:35,188
All right,
we got Harry Tasker billfold...

106
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:39,489
Harry Tasker passport,
ticket stub, hotel bill.

107
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:42,521
I got two postcards here
from Geneva.

108
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,503
Got some house keys
right there...

109
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:49,905
and I' ve got a souvenir
Swiss snowing village.

110
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:52,102
- What's that for?
- For Dana, stupe.

111
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,544
You know,
bring your kid home a gift.

112
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,108
Nice touch.
Pick me up tomorrow at eight.

113
00:14:58,151 --> 00:14:59,311
Will do.

114
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,715
The debriefing
is at ten-hundred.

115
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:04,725
Mm-hmm.

116
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,227
See you at eight.

117
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:09,492
OK. Hey, Harry.
Did you forget something?

118
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,158
What a team.

119
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,365
All right. Sleep fast, buddy.

120
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,651
Hi, honey.
How was your flight?

121
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:02,464
- It was fine.
- Good.

122
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,952
Brought you a little gift
from Switzerland.

123
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:20,954
Snowy village.

124
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:24,982
Wow. Thanks, Dad.
I've never had one of these.

125
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,585
You're welcome.

126
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,596
You're late for school.
You better get going.

127
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,498
- Donâ€™t forget to feed Gizmo.
- OK.

128
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,471
It' s pretty lame.

129
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,464
It' s pretty lame.

130
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:42,681
- I' m late.
- Me, too.

131
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:44,683
How'd it go at the convention?

132
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,686
Did you make
all the other salesmen jealous?

133
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,188
It was fantastic.
You wouldn't believe it.

134
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:51,691
We were the big hit of the show

135
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,752
with that
new model ordering system...

136
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,296
the six-eighty
I told you about.

137
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,459
You can write up an order...

138
00:16:57,534 --> 00:16:59,695
and as soon as
the customer's name comes up...

139
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,897
you see
what his credit line is...

140
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,372
what he's ordered in the past...

141
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:06,502
what discount he's gotten,
every little detail.

142
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:07,704
Sounds great.

143
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,772
It' s fantastic.
I love the computer business.

144
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,318
Listen, the plumber called.

145
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:15,447
He says he has to dig
under the slab or something.

146
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:18,959
- It' s going to cost $600.
- That's OK.

147
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:21,496
Well, it's not OK.
It's extortion.

148
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,498
So what did you tell him?

149
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:26,058
I slept with him,
and he said he'd knock off $100.

150
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:29,332
That's good thinking.
Bye, honey.

151
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:34,171
Hello.

152
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,632
Dana!

153
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,784
I remember the first time
I got shot out of a cannon.

154
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,824
Morning. Go to school.

155
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,291
Sure, Dad.

156
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,158
Thanks, dear.

157
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,792
Check these out.

158
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,394
Check 'em out.

159
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:23,440
Where's the image coming from?

160
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:25,705
Got a CCD camera
and a transmitter...

161
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:28,678
in a pack of smokes.
Pretty cool, huh?

162
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,045
Mm-hmm.

163
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,380
What the hell?

164
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,793
- Bye, Dad!
- What's she...

165
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,490
Dana!
She's ripping you off. Dana!

166
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:47,002
I knew it.

167
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,971
Dana!

168
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:51,634
Dana!

169
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:52,801
Let's go!

170
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:55,403
Can't stop, I' m late! Bye, Dad!

171
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,676
Shit.

172
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,615
Kids... 10 seconds of joy,
30 years of misery.

173
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,159
I got married three times.

174
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,751
I was never dumb enough
to have any.

175
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:10,128
She shouldn't be
stealing. I taught her better.

176
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,292
But you're not
her parents anymore.

177
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,837
Her parents
are Axel Rose and Madonna.

178
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,339
The five minutes a day
you spend with her...

179
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,705
can't compete with
that constant bombardment.

180
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:20,300
You're outgunned, daddy-o.

181
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,381
It's not just because
you're a bad parent.

182
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:26,544
Kids today are ten years
ahead of where we were.

183
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,383
- Morning.
- Morning, Mr. Tasker.

184
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:29,718
I' II bet you think
she's still a virgin.

185
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,485
Don't be ridiculous.
She's only...

186
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,029
- She's 14.
- She's only 14.

187
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:35,724
Her hormones
are going like a fire alarm.

188
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:38,460
It's even money, she lets that
physicist on the bike boink her.

189
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,003
Not Dana.

190
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:43,064
Denial- -
it's not just a river in Egypt.

191
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,803
She's probably stealing
the money for an abortion.

192
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,310
Why don't you open the door?

193
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,379
Or drugs.

194
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,453
Twenty here, fifty there.

195
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:56,456
I figured my wife's scumbag
boyfriend was taking it.

196
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,426
He takes everything else.
Never a beer in the fridge.

197
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,089
- Thought you moved out.
- I had to move back in.

198
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:03,392
My lawyer said
it'd give me a better shot...

199
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:06,196
at getting the house
in the property settlement.

200
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:07,793
Don't change the subject.
You still owe me 200 bucks.

201
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:09,567
Good morning, Janice.

202
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,875
Good morning.

203
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,852
Please identify
yourselves to the scanner.

204
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,379
Harry Tasker, 10024.

205
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:25,926
Albert Gibson,34991.

206
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,235
[Faisil tapping pencil

207
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,776
All right, Frances...

208
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,973
I don't believe
we need you any longer now.

209
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,139
Thank you.

210
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,194
Sweet Jesus, Harry.

211
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:57,688
You surely screwed the pooch
last night, didn't you?

212
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,668
Please tell me
how I can see this...

213
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:02,899
as anything
but a total disaster.

214
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,941
Total is a strong word.

215
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,444
There are different
degrees of totality.

216
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,946
It' s a scale, really...

217
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,040
with a perfect mission
on one end...

218
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:14,087
and a total pooch-screw
on the other.

219
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:17,488
Faisil, you're new
on Harry's team, aren't you?

220
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:20,057
Yes.

221
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:22,563
What makes you think
the slack I cut him...

222
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:25,500
in any way translates to you?

223
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,730
Let me show you what we got.

224
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,632
Jamal Khaled.

225
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:35,408
We think he's dirty, so we raid
his private financial files.

226
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,375
$100 million in transfers from
the Commerce Bank International.

227
00:21:40,453 --> 00:21:43,423
A front for countries
to finance terrorist activities.

228
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,188
That's why we think
something big's going down.

229
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,695
A week ago, four MIR V
warheads were smuggled out...

230
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,699
of the former Soviet Republic
of Kazakhstan.

231
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,530
We think Khaled's group
bought the nukes...

232
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,036
and is trying to bring them
to U.S. Soil.

233
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,269
So far, this is not
blowing my skirt up.

234
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:01,835
Don't you have anything
remotely substantial

235
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:05,112
Harry,
do you have any hard data?

236
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:07,619
Nothing you would call
rock-hard.

237
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:08,917
Actually, it's pretty limp.

238
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:11,549
Perhaps you'd better get some
before somebody parks...

239
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,253
an automobile
in front of the White House...

240
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:16,195
with a nuclear weapon
in the trunk.

241
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:18,393
It' s not like
he's saving the world.

242
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:21,029
He's a sales rep,
for Christ's sake.

243
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:22,572
Whenever I can't sleep...

244
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,767
I just ask him
to tell me about his day.

245
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,038
Six seconds, and I' m out.

246
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:29,980
He acts like he's curing cancer
or something.

247
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,483
So you didn't get away
for the weekend?

248
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,749
No. Harry had to go out of town.

249
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,256
- I' m shocked.
- You know Harry.

250
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:42,325
- What's up?
- Check this out.

251
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:47,102
A $2 million disbursement
from Khaled to Juno Skinner.

252
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,162
That's right,
the babe at the party.

253
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,979
That doesn't mean anything.
She buys antiquities for Khaled.

254
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:58,778
He keeps his antique buys
on a separate ledger.

255
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:00,409
And this is
a little above market rate...

256
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:03,456
for the horizontal bop,
even for a biscuit like her.

257
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:06,153
All right. I want
a complete work-up on her.

258
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:07,558
Do we know where she is?

259
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:09,097
- Right here in River City.
- You're kidding.

260
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:11,531
She lives in Rome, but
does stuff at the Smithsonian.

261
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,863
She has a lot of
diplomatic connections...

262
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:15,097
so she has offices here.

263
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:17,164
So I guess it's time
to send in a specialist.

264
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,280
- Care to tango?
- Yes, I would.

265
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,123
Assholes.

266
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,114
Assholes.

267
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:34,060
It' s all set up.

268
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:36,792
I got fax machine,
ghost phones, the usual stuff.

269
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:39,198
You have
a suite at the Marquis Hotel...

270
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:40,463
under the name of Renquist.

271
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:42,334
All right, reality check.

272
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,636
Hi. My name is Harry Renquist.

273
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,678
I own a corporate art consulting
company in San Francisco...

274
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,908
and have an appointment
with Miss Skinner.

275
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:52,177
- Harry.
- Oh, hello.

276
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:55,085
Hello.
I thought I' d see you again.

277
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:57,147
I just didn't know
it would be so soon.

278
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:59,989
- What's the point of waiting?
- I agree.

279
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:04,858
So, you said your clients
are looking for something...

280
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:06,902
for the lobby of their new
corporate headquarters?

281
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,405
Yes. They would like
to see something very dramatic.

282
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,930
That's a nice piece.

283
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:12,533
I talked
to a number of people...

284
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,205
and they all said
you're the one to see.

285
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,771
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:18,750
Checking on me?

287
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:22,380
So, what did these people
say about me, exactly?

288
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:24,982
They said you can read
ancient Sanskrit...

289
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:27,050
without having
to sound out the words...

290
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:28,824
and other art dealers
and archaeologists...

291
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,422
don't really like you very much.

292
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,467
Oh!

293
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:34,127
Those wimps.

294
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:38,608
It's because I use my diplomatic
contacts to export treasures...

295
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,442
from countries
which tell them to take a hike.

296
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:50,018
See, most of our pieces
come from ancient Persia.

297
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,821
Unfortunately, ancient Persia
sits 20 feet under the sand...

298
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:54,953
of Iran, Iraq, and Syria.

299
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,465
Not the most popular places
lately.

300
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:02,802
So I' ve had to become an expert
in international diplomacy.

301
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,634
Well, Mr. Renquist...

302
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:11,105
do you see anything you like?

303
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:14,316
Maybe.

304
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:16,113
Give me a break, Fise.

305
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:18,124
I don't think
they bugged my tuna sandwich.

306
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,651
She's importing stuff
from all over the Mideast.

307
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,664
She could be moving
money, guns, anything.

308
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:25,133
We've been getting calls
to the ghost numbers...

309
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:27,136
checking out the Renquist front.

310
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,696
Step up surveillance.
Put on two more guys.

311
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:34,302
Maurizio, I said Saturday...
not Tuesday, Saturday.

312
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:36,347
Va bene. Ciao.

313
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,948
Ms. Skinner, may I have
a word with you please?

314
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,996
Stupid, undisciplined bitch!

315
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:57,534
It' s a good thing
you're paying me a lot of money.

316
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:01,711
Do you realize
there are surveillance teams...

317
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:03,715
watching this place right now?

318
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:05,741
Your telephones
are almost certainly tapped.

319
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:08,788
And you were busy
laughing and flirting...

320
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:10,016
like a whore
with this Renquist...

321
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,421
He checked out OK.

322
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:15,688
We do not tolerate mistakes.

323
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:22,734
What would you like me to do?

324
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:25,140
Find out where this Renquist is.

325
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:28,908
Hello. Tektel Systems.
Mr. Tasker's office.

326
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:30,972
Hi, Charlene?
Hi. It' s Helen. Is he in?

327
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,110
Harry's in a sales meeting,
Mrs. Tasker.

328
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:34,949
Let me try him in there.
Hold, please.

329
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,888
Relay 10024.

330
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:41,086
It' s a patch from Tektel.

331
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:44,623
It's Helen.

332
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:47,669
Hello, honey.
How are you? What's going on?

333
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:49,228
I'm sorry to bother you
in the middle of a meeting.

334
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:53,300
Dana and I wanted to make sure
you'll be home by 8:00.

335
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,608
We're going to a lot of trouble
for your birthday...

336
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,583
and we just wanted to make sure
you would be home...

337
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,883
Absolutely.
This time you can count on me.

338
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,217
- Promise?
- Trust me.

339
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,348
Great.

340
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,086
- Gotta go. Bye.
- Bye.

341
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,255
- That's disgusting, Dana.
- Calm down.

342
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:15,902
We've got a friend.
3 cars back on the inside lane.

343
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,908
They've been on us
since we left the hotel.

344
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:20,276
In the station wagon?

345
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:22,337
Uh-huh. Want me to lose them?

346
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:24,713
No. We need this lead.

347
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:26,611
Unit Seven?

348
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,349
Seven here.

349
00:27:29,423 --> 00:27:31,914
We need you at the
Georgetown mall in 3 minutes.

350
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:33,085
Copy that. We're rolling.

351
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:35,153
Helen's going to be pissed.

352
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:38,833
Well, this is
the problem with terrorists.

353
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:41,861
They're really inconsiderate
about people 's schedules.

354
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:54,278
Pull over here. This is good.

355
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:01,662
- Testing 1, 2,3.
- I got you.

356
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:09,097
OK, they're right with us.
I make three of them in the car.

357
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:23,054
- Dickhead.
- Blow me.

358
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:42,147
Hey, Harry, I got a couple
of them coming after you.

359
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,944
You think I' m blind?

360
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,450
You do look
like Ray Charles.

361
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:48,009
So what's the plan?

362
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:50,750
Just getting a closer
look at Beavis and Butt-head.

363
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:52,725
There's a third one
still in the car.

364
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,227
Stay on him.

365
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,914
Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib.

366
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,393
Oh, not much.

367
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:22,919
Listen, Harry forgot something
back at the office...

368
00:29:22,964 --> 00:29:26,594
and you know Harry, and, uh...

369
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:29,195
Yeah, Gib, I know Harry.

370
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:30,365
Bye.

371
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,566
Bye. See you soon.

372
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:34,412
See?

373
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:18,494
Harry, I lost the third guy.

374
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:04,191
Aah!

375
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:05,317
Shit!

376
00:31:06,527 --> 00:31:08,257
Hold it! Oh, shit!

377
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,818
Hey!

378
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:00,189
Here. Cool off.

379
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,530
Move! Move!

380
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:20,551
Sorry about this.

381
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:28,861
Look out! Get out of the way!

382
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,945
Hey! Freeze!

383
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,583
Oh, thank God.

384
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:06,918
- Get to the car!
- Yep.

385
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:14,161
Here we go.

386
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:38,452
Federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.

387
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,156
Sorry.

388
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,359
Hey!

389
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,420
- Harry, what's your 20?
- Westbound from the park.

390
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:04,481
Suspect is on a motorcycle,
coming out on Franklin.

391
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:05,719
Copy that.

392
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:08,558
I want you on 14th
in case he turns south...

393
00:35:08,596 --> 00:35:11,497
and Seven on the north side
to box him in.

394
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,529
And make it quick because
my horse is getting tired.

395
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,404
Your horse?

396
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:22,939
Hyah!

397
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:37,192
There he is! That's him!

398
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:38,426
Come on!

399
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,897
Move!

400
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:54,218
- Go around to the back.
- Copy that.

401
00:35:57,057 --> 00:35:58,922
Out of my way!

402
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:11,970
Out of my way!

403
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:14,868
Sorry.

404
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:17,114
Excuse me. Excuse me.

405
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:28,523
Sorry.

406
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,254
Out of my way!

407
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:35,096
Excuse me.

408
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:36,537
Excuse me.

409
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:50,383
Out of the way!

410
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,594
Move! Move! Move!

411
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:04,573
Federal officer!
Get down now!

412
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:05,734
Duck or die!

413
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,572
Down! Down!

414
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,181
Aah!

415
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:13,549
Hold still!

416
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:15,612
Come on! Hyah!

417
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,125
Whoa!

418
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,660
Hold still!

419
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,798
Hold still!

420
00:37:32,943 --> 00:37:34,240
Hyah!

421
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:44,222
Would you press the button
for the top floor, please?

422
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:46,854
Thank you.

423
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,733
No!

424
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:54,929
Shut up!

425
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:58,933
Whoa.

426
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,740
Say something.

427
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,907
That's a f-fine animal.

428
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,109
Eww!

429
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:24,303
Stay against the glass!

430
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:27,710
OK. Come on.

431
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:29,303
I'm so sorry.

432
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:32,981
Ooh!

433
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:34,883
Stay there! Don't move!

434
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,810
Hyah! Come on, fella.

435
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:06,921
Aah!

436
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,121
Whoa!

437
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:21,471
Hyah!

438
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:26,409
Hyah!

439
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:40,430
Ohh! Ohh!

440
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:43,830
Aah!

441
00:39:52,384 --> 00:39:55,149
OK... back up.

442
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:58,180
Back up.

443
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:01,758
You can do it.

444
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:03,890
Come on.

445
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:05,900
Good horse. Good.

446
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:08,460
Yeah, yeah. Go back now.

447
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:10,631
Come on. Yeah.
That's teamwork now.

448
00:40:10,673 --> 00:40:13,939
Keep pulling. Come on. Good.

449
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:15,912
A little bit more.

450
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,446
Attaboy.

451
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:24,956
OK.

452
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:37,830
Now, what the hell
were you thinking?

453
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:42,810
I had the guy,
and you let him get away.

454
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:44,577
Look at me when I talk to you.

455
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,880
What kind of a cop
are you anyway?

456
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:08,138
Hi, honey.

457
00:41:13,118 --> 00:41:16,213
I know you're upset.
I'm sorry...

458
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:19,355
but I hurried home
as fast as I could.

459
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:26,061
- It' s OK.
- Ow.

460
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:27,399
It's OK.

461
00:41:29,806 --> 00:41:34,039
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the party.

462
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,740
Yeah. It was great.

463
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,724
Huh. Hey.

464
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,465
That's him.

465
00:41:57,507 --> 00:41:59,499
OK. Pause it right there.

466
00:41:59,543 --> 00:42:01,443
Salim Abu Aziz.

467
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,969
This guy's really hard-core.

468
00:42:03,014 --> 00:42:05,141
Highly fanatical, a real psycho.

469
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,153
He's been linked to dozens
and dozens of car bombings.

470
00:42:08,187 --> 00:42:11,351
You know that cafe bomb in Rome
last year?

471
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,881
That was his.

472
00:42:12,926 --> 00:42:14,895
As well as
the 727 out of Lisbon.

473
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:16,123
This guy's a major player.

474
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:19,601
He's formed his own
splinter faction... Crimson Jihad.

475
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:21,466
I guess
the other terrorist groups...

476
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:23,529
were too warm and fuzzy.

477
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:25,632
- They call him the Sand Spider.
- Why?

478
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:28,406
Probably because
it sounds scary.

479
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,505
This is impressive, gentlemen.

480
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:35,249
It would be even more impressive
if you knew where he was.

481
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:37,381
We'll get him.

482
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:39,389
Why don't you pull over
right here?

483
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:40,586
What's up?

484
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:44,390
I really screwed up
with Helen last night.

485
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,235
I'm going to run in and see
if she's available for lunch...

486
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:52,367
to smooth things over.

487
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:55,038
- You just want me to hang?
- Yeah. Just hang.

488
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,410
OK, buddy, I' II just be hanging.

489
00:43:02,388 --> 00:43:03,981
Hold, please.

490
00:43:04,024 --> 00:43:07,722
Helen,
it's your mystery man on two.

491
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:08,956
Simon?

492
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:12,359
Oh, my God!

493
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:18,304
Hello? Simon?

494
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:21,609
Yes, I can talk.

495
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:26,677
You mean right now?

496
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:30,548
Yes... I can meet you.

497
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:33,821
OK. I can't wait.

498
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,294
Bye.

499
00:43:36,097 --> 00:43:38,292
Can you cover me
for an hour?

500
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,928
Just an hour? Tell that
stud to take more time!

501
00:43:41,003 --> 00:43:42,402
Would you shut up?

502
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:44,703
I should have never
told you about him.

503
00:43:46,242 --> 00:43:48,837
Have a good time!

504
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:52,643
Get a little bit for me
while you're at it!

505
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,198
Hey, hold it!

506
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:05,367
Fucker.

507
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,393
What's going on, man?
You sick or something?

508
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,801
Looks like you got gut-kicked.

509
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:14,538
It' s Helen... it's Helen.
It's Helen.

510
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:16,410
It has something to do
with Helen, I' m guessing.

511
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,780
- Helen...
- Helen...

512
00:44:18,817 --> 00:44:20,148
Helen...

513
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:24,384
Helen... is having an affair.

514
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:30,725
Welcome to the club, man.

515
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:35,660
Nobody thinks it can happen
to them the first time.

516
00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:37,673
Same thing happened to me
with wife number two.

517
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:39,767
I had no idea.
Nothing's going on, right?

518
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,335
I come home one day,
the house is completely empty.

519
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,645
She even took the ice cube trays
from the freezer.

520
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:50,314
What kind of a sick bitch
takes the ice cube trays?

521
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:53,585
Not Helen.

522
00:44:53,627 --> 00:44:56,461
Hey, Harry.
Listen, Helen still loves you.

523
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:58,693
She just wants to bang this guy
for a while.

524
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:00,369
It's nothing serious.

525
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:03,771
Stop cheering me up!

526
00:45:07,244 --> 00:45:08,973
What'd you expect, Harry?

527
00:45:09,013 --> 00:45:11,244
Helen's a flesh-and-blood
woman, and you're never there.

528
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:13,514
It was just a matter of time.

529
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:23,754
You know what?
I say we concentrate on work.

530
00:45:23,798 --> 00:45:26,426
That's what I do every time
my life turns to dog shit.

531
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:28,494
I concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.

532
00:45:28,537 --> 00:45:30,471
This is gonna be great.

533
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:32,236
We're gonna catch
some terrorists...

534
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:33,765
we're gonna beat
the crap out of them...

535
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,938
you're gonna feel
a hell of a lot better.

536
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,641
Watch your head now.

537
00:45:37,682 --> 00:45:39,378
OK. All right.

538
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:49,653
Women... can't live with them,
can't kill 'em.

539
00:46:06,685 --> 00:46:08,710
I came by your office today.

540
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:11,216
I was in the area...

541
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,259
and I thought that
you might want to have lunch.

542
00:46:14,462 --> 00:46:18,296
R-really?
You must've just missed me.

543
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:22,198
They said you had to run
out or something like that.

544
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,206
It was this rush job.

545
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,071
They needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.

546
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:31,348
And so of course,
the big problem?

547
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,815
Our printer shut down.

548
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:34,717
I went to the third floor
to use theirs...

549
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,847
but they have the 1720...

550
00:46:36,923 --> 00:46:40,519
and of course, the disk
isn't formatted for the 1720.

551
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:43,360
So I have to go back
upstairs and reformat...

552
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:46,332
go back downstairs
and use their printer...

553
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:50,465
then I couldn't get
my car to start.

554
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,372
Then traffic...
Well, I barely got there.

555
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:59,816
That's a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.

556
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,512
Did it work out OK?

557
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:05,618
Yeah. Great.

558
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:08,459
I'll check on dessert.

559
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:10,557
I' m done.

560
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:20,635
He's practically given us
a blank check on wiretaps.

561
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:23,306
I've set them up on Juno's
shipping agents and clients...

562
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:25,542
and Faisil' s made a list
of all the possible contacts...

563
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:27,347
the Crimson Jihad
may have in this country.

564
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:28,977
Now all we gotta do
is sit around...

565
00:47:33,326 --> 00:47:37,127
Hey, this national security
stuff boring you?

566
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:39,326
Put a tap on her phone.

567
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,698
What are you talking about?
I already did that.

568
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:42,203
I'm talking about Helen's.

569
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:44,968
Put a tap on her office line
and my house. Do it now.

570
00:47:45,008 --> 00:47:47,500
OK. Just come over here.
Sounds great.

571
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:49,011
I just want to ask you
about something.

572
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:52,039
I got two words to describe
that idea... in-sane.

573
00:47:52,117 --> 00:47:54,176
An unauthorized wiretap
is a felony.

574
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:56,017
And we're doing it
twenty times a day!

575
00:47:56,055 --> 00:47:59,787
So don't give me that crap.
Do it.

576
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:13,068
Hello?

577
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:15,612
Helen, it's Simon.
Is it safe to talk?

578
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:17,204
Yes. Go ahead.

579
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:18,716
I can't talk long.

580
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,945
Can you meet me for lunch
tomorrow? I must see you.

581
00:48:20,986 --> 00:48:23,785
I suppose so. Where?

582
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:25,425
Same place. One o'clock.

583
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:27,428
I have to go now.

584
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:29,328
See you tomorrow.

585
00:48:29,396 --> 00:48:31,957
Remember, I need you.

586
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,959
I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

587
00:48:55,296 --> 00:48:59,996
You know, darn it,
I'm meeting Allison.

588
00:49:00,035 --> 00:49:02,561
We're going to go shopping.
Sorry.

589
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,630
No problem.

590
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,185
I think you're going
about this all wrong.

591
00:49:44,257 --> 00:49:46,427
See, women like you
to talk to them.

592
00:49:46,427 --> 00:49:49,055
And maybe you're not in touch
with your feminine side.

593
00:49:49,096 --> 00:49:51,433
I was watching
Sally Jessy Raphael- -

594
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:54,437
All right. OK.
I got the usual stuff here.

595
00:49:54,437 --> 00:49:56,905
I got a telemetry-burst
transmitter, a GPS tracker...

596
00:49:56,939 --> 00:49:58,931
an audio transmitter,
a power supply.

597
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:01,671
I've got it
sewn into the lining here...

598
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:03,202
Hey, Harry?

599
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:06,217
If you need to talk...
speak into the purse.

600
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:13,325
Here she comes,
right in front of us.

601
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,260
- Watch this. Bingo!
- Yep.

602
00:50:20,035 --> 00:50:22,266
Looks like
she's going into Chinatown.

603
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,507
OK, she's parking.

604
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:37,852
OK, give me audio.

605
00:50:46,535 --> 00:50:47,866
You sure you werenâ€™t followed?

606
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,765
No. I kept looking
behind me like you taught me...

607
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:54,903
but I didn't see anyone.

608
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:56,742
It' s just things
are a bit hot right now.

609
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,218
If I get a signal,
I may have to leave suddenly.

610
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:02,778
I understand.

611
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:10,559
Look, it's my job
to take risks, but not yours.

612
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:13,066
I feel bad
about bringing you into this...

613
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:15,161
but you're the only one
I can trust.

614
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:18,133
Were you out on a mission?

615
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:21,803
Shh. We say "op."

616
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,108
Covert operation...

617
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:26,117
and this one,
well, got a little rough.

618
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:28,642
- Worse than Cairo?
- Cairo?

619
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:33,115
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

620
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,391
- The guy's a spook.
- But for whom?

621
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,456
He could be working her
to get to you.

622
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,469
Did you read
the papers yesterday?

623
00:51:41,503 --> 00:51:42,698
Yes.

624
00:51:47,444 --> 00:51:50,346
Sometimes a story's
a mask for a covert operation.

625
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:52,246
See " Two men killed
in a rest room...

626
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:56,277
and two unidentified men
in a shoot-out at the Marriott"?

627
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,018
That was you.

628
00:51:58,058 --> 00:52:00,856
You're very good.
You recognize my style.

629
00:52:00,894 --> 00:52:03,523
You're a natural at this.

630
00:52:03,598 --> 00:52:05,999
The guy's a fake. He's
taking credit for our moves.

631
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:08,628
- What happened?
- Hardly worth talking about.

632
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,474
Two of them
won't bother me again.

633
00:52:11,474 --> 00:52:14,035
Unbelievable!

634
00:52:14,078 --> 00:52:16,376
- You chased one?
- Something came over me.

635
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:19,008
I had to nail this guy
no matter what the risk.

636
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,143
Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple of times...

637
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:24,350
but I really can't take credit.

638
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,550
Why not?

639
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,093
It's the training.

640
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,425
It shapes you
into a lethal instrument.

641
00:52:29,463 --> 00:52:30,298
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

642
00:52:30,298 --> 00:52:31,287
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

643
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:33,467
I' m starting
to like this guy.

644
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:37,063
We've still got to kill him.
That's a given.

645
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,313
More than a woman to me

646
00:52:46,718 --> 00:52:49,084
More than a woman

647
00:52:51,324 --> 00:52:54,522
More than a woman to me

648
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:57,523
More than a wo...

649
00:53:03,773 --> 00:53:06,334
The guy is a goddamn
used car salesman.

650
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:09,243
This keeps getting
better and better!

651
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:12,244
I'm sorry. I know
this has got to be painful.

652
00:53:12,283 --> 00:53:14,252
But you gotta admit,
it's pretty damn funny.

653
00:53:14,286 --> 00:53:15,844
If it was some idiot
and not you...

654
00:53:15,888 --> 00:53:18,449
you'd be laughing your ass off.

655
00:53:19,459 --> 00:53:21,552
One born every minute.

656
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:24,530
It wants you, too.

657
00:53:24,565 --> 00:53:26,261
Feel it vibrate?

658
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:27,666
Say, how about a little spin?

659
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:29,101
Sure.

660
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:33,441
It' s not just a car.
It's a total image...

661
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:35,774
an identity
you have to go for.

662
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,508
This isn't
some high-tech sports car.

663
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,779
Tell you the truth, it
doesn't even handle that great.

664
00:53:39,818 --> 00:53:41,810
But that's not the idea, is it?

665
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,355
What are we talking about here?

666
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,652
Pussy, right?

667
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:46,920
Ha ha ha.

668
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,257
Absolutely.

669
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:55,930
Let's face it, Harry.
The 'Vette gets 'em wet.

670
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:58,805
But it's not enough.

671
00:53:58,842 --> 00:54:00,343
If you really want
to close escrow...

672
00:54:00,343 --> 00:54:03,313
well, you gotta have an angle.

673
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:05,315
I suppose you have an angle.

674
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:08,319
Oh, it's killer.
I mean, look at me.

675
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:10,322
I'm not that much to look at.

676
00:54:10,356 --> 00:54:12,324
No, no. I can be honest.

677
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:14,327
But I got 'em lining up.

678
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:17,592
And not just the skanks.
Well, some are.

679
00:54:17,632 --> 00:54:18,792
What's your angle?

680
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:23,396
Oh, oh, no.
Sorry. Trade secret.

681
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:28,400
OK. Just ask yourself...
what do women really want?

682
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:30,845
Take these bored housewives,
married for years.

683
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:33,647
They're stuck in a rut.
They need some release!

684
00:54:33,685 --> 00:54:36,313
The promise of adventure,
a hint of danger.

685
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:38,324
I create that for them.

686
00:54:38,391 --> 00:54:41,759
Basically, you're lying
your ass off the whole time.

687
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:43,091
I couldn't do that.

688
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,927
What are you, a boy scout?

689
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:47,536
Think of it as playing
a role, as fantasy.

690
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:49,401
You gotta work
on their dreams...

691
00:54:49,437 --> 00:54:52,874
get them out of their daily
suburban grind for a few hours.

692
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:55,377
- What about their husbands?
- Dickless!

693
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:58,712
Face it,
if they took care of business...

694
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,048
I'd be out of business,
you know what I mean?

695
00:55:01,085 --> 00:55:02,212
Those idiots.

696
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,326
Hey, hey!
You mind keeping it under90?

697
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,330
I'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.

698
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:12,332
Who are you
working on right now?

699
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:14,631
I always got a couple
on the hook.

700
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,129
There's this one right now,
I got her panting like a dog.

701
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,972
- It' s great.
- What does she do?

702
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,979
Some sort of legal secretary.

703
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:24,981
You know,
uptight and conservative.

704
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:28,782
Oh! She could be so hot
if she wanted to be.

705
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,482
With you,
she gets to be real hot?

706
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:33,823
Oh, red hot!
Her thighs steam.

707
00:55:33,894 --> 00:55:36,362
It's like a dying plant.
Just needs a little water.

708
00:55:36,396 --> 00:55:39,230
- Married to some boring jerk.
- Married to some boring jerk?

709
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:41,360
He doesn't appreciate her.

710
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:43,803
She's like all these babes...
you get their pilot lit...

711
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,468
they can suck-start
a leaf-blower.

712
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,444
God, she's got
the most incredible body...

713
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,108
and a pair of titties
make you want to stand up...

714
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:53,742
and beg for buttermilk.

715
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:55,685
Ass like a 10-year-old boy!

716
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:03,096
Ah ha ha ha!

717
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,827
Then she must be
really good in bed then, huh?

718
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:08,461
Slow down.
You'll miss the turn.

719
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:15,204
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

720
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,351
See?

721
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:25,118
You and this car
were made for each other.

722
00:56:25,157 --> 00:56:26,386
Why fight it?

723
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:28,519
Sure, I got
some other buyers on the line...

724
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:30,189
but I like your style.

725
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:32,392
So, what do you say?

726
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,800
Should we start up
the paperwork?

727
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:38,603
Let me think about it.
Hold it for me for a day, OK?

728
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:43,305
Hey. Because it's you.

729
00:56:43,414 --> 00:56:47,715
I got today's transcripts.
Not much going on.

730
00:56:49,555 --> 00:56:52,547
- Nothing from Simon?
- No.

731
00:57:04,373 --> 00:57:05,739
My turn to drive?

732
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,538
- Give me the page.
- What are you talking about?

733
00:57:07,577 --> 00:57:09,135
This jumps
from page nine to page eleven.

734
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:11,171
- Where's page ten?
- It' s got to be a typo.

735
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:12,715
Give me the goddamn page!

736
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,718
OK.

737
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,593
Seek help, Harry.

738
00:57:24,631 --> 00:57:25,758
Hello?

739
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,601
Helen, I need your help.
Can you meet me tonight?

740
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:31,606
- What's happened?
- It' s serious.

741
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:35,133
Meet me on K Street
under the Key Bridge.

742
00:57:35,212 --> 00:57:36,372
Eight o'clock sharp.

743
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,312
Gotcha.

744
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,820
Shit.
It's almost eight o'clock.

745
00:57:50,765 --> 00:57:52,995
She's still at the house.

746
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:55,161
The purse is still
at the house.

747
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:56,761
Shit.

748
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,376
Unit Two, Unit Seven.
Immediate roll.

749
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,437
Acquire subject at K Street
and Key Bridge.

750
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,882
Red and white convertible.
You've got six minutes.

751
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:09,887
Wait a minute, man.
Are you out of your mind?

752
00:58:09,922 --> 00:58:11,412
You can't pull agents
off a priority surveillance...

753
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,014
to follow your wife!

754
00:58:13,092 --> 00:58:14,856
It's a misappropriation
of sector resources...

755
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:16,863
and a breach
of national security.

756
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:20,834
You copy, Harry?
You're losing it big-time.

757
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:23,531
- I have to stop you.
- How? By telling?

758
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:26,633
Both of our butts
are on the line here.

759
00:58:26,676 --> 00:58:27,973
So your life's in the crapper.

760
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:29,980
So your wife's banging
a used car salesman.

761
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:33,473
It's humiliating, but, damn it,
take it like a man!

762
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,281
You tell on me, I tell on you.

763
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,653
I' m as clean
as a preacher's sheets.

764
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,180
I'm as clean as a baby's...

765
00:58:39,258 --> 00:58:41,250
What about the time
you blew a six-week operation...

766
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:43,228
because you were busy
getting a blowjob?

767
00:58:44,164 --> 00:58:45,325
You knew about that?

768
00:58:45,366 --> 00:58:46,628
Huh.

769
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:50,539
Let's take Franklin.
It's a lot quicker.

770
00:59:18,307 --> 00:59:19,774
Quick, get in.
Hurry up. Let's go.

771
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,921
Two here.
Suspect, vehicle in sight.

772
00:59:30,956 --> 00:59:33,824
One male, one female.

773
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,350
Don't be alarmed.

774
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:38,832
If I' m spotted, it'd be best
if they didn't see you.

775
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,563
You should keep your head down
till we're out of the city.

776
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:45,531
Here. Let me help you.

777
00:59:47,944 --> 00:59:49,469
That's better.

778
00:59:53,017 --> 00:59:56,010
OK, now the woman has
her head in the guy's lap...

779
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:58,751
southbound on the Key Bridge.
Two in pursuit.

780
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:02,819
Roger, Two.
One to Condor, you got a visual

781
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:06,331
Roger, One. This is Condor.

782
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:09,337
Subject is in sight.
Repeat. We have the ball.

783
01:00:09,371 --> 01:00:12,033
We got a pretty good
lockup on infrared.

784
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:14,805
She's got her head
in his lap, all right.

785
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,004
Yahoo.

786
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,414
Maybe she's sleepy.

787
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:25,124
OK, this is a safe house.

788
01:00:25,158 --> 01:00:28,616
My place in the city
is too hot right now.

789
01:00:28,661 --> 01:00:30,061
So is the penthouse in New York.

790
01:00:43,313 --> 01:00:46,181
What is it exactly
you need me to do?

791
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:50,619
Helen, I want you
to be my wife.

792
01:00:50,656 --> 01:00:52,715
But I' m married!

793
01:00:52,758 --> 01:00:55,227
It' s just
for the operation in Paris.

794
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:56,922
I need to be married.

795
01:00:56,963 --> 01:00:59,330
They'll be looking
for a man traveling alone.

796
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:02,428
Par-Par...
You want me to go to Paris?

797
01:01:02,471 --> 01:01:05,464
Paris,
with a quick stopover in London.

798
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,436
Helen, there's
a double agent in my outfit.

799
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:12,244
I don't know who.

800
01:01:12,316 --> 01:01:15,912
There's no one
I can trust except you.

801
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:19,254
Can you get away,
just for a couple of days?

802
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:20,758
I just don't know.

803
01:01:20,793 --> 01:01:22,762
Of course. I' m rushing you.

804
01:01:22,796 --> 01:01:25,789
Forgive me. Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

805
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:29,033
Let me pour you
some more wine.

806
01:01:42,888 --> 01:01:44,287
OK.

807
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:48,351
I'll do it. I' II do it.

808
01:01:50,764 --> 01:01:52,288
You just saved my life.

809
01:01:53,802 --> 01:01:55,963
You are incredibly brave.

810
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:59,969
I have to remind myself
of the fear you must be feeling.

811
01:02:01,244 --> 01:02:03,041
For me, fear is not an option.

812
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,017
Now, in order to pull
this cover story off...

813
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:09,419
we have to look
like two people...

814
01:02:09,455 --> 01:02:11,548
who are completely
intimate with each other.

815
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,650
The enemy
can spot a fake easily.

816
01:02:18,532 --> 01:02:20,967
- You see what I mean?
- I' m sorry.

817
01:02:21,002 --> 01:02:22,663
That reaction
could get us both killed.

818
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:24,638
- I' m sorry.
- We can't afford that.

819
01:02:24,673 --> 01:02:26,642
No. I' m sorry.

820
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,109
Try to relax.

821
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,647
It' s just been
a long time...

822
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:33,082
since anybody but Harry's
touched me like that.

823
01:02:33,118 --> 01:02:37,351
I know.
It's awkward for me, too.

824
01:02:37,423 --> 01:02:40,187
- I' m sorry.
- That's all right.

825
01:02:40,226 --> 01:02:41,854
- Just sit back.
- I' m OK.

826
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:44,625
There. That's better.

827
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,032
Just let yourself...
slip into the role.

828
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:49,537
Mm-hmm.

829
01:02:57,615 --> 01:02:58,741
That's it.

830
01:03:00,251 --> 01:03:01,844
There we go.

831
01:03:03,722 --> 01:03:06,988
- Just let yourself go.
- Mm-hmm.

832
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:08,653
Yeah. That's good.

833
01:03:08,694 --> 01:03:10,026
That's great.

834
01:03:11,031 --> 01:03:13,159
That's it. Mmm.

835
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:15,999
No. I can't do this.
I can't do this.

836
01:03:16,037 --> 01:03:17,528
What's wrong? It' s OK.

837
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:20,133
No. I cannot do this.
I cannot... do this!

838
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:26,339
If not for me...

839
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:29,115
do it for your country?

840
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,094
Aah!

841
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:43,029
Shit!

842
01:03:57,623 --> 01:03:59,887
Ohh, God! Don't hurt me!

843
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:03,362
Don't hurt me!
I'll do whatever you want. Oh!

844
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,664
Please! I didn't do anything!

845
01:04:10,038 --> 01:04:11,665
Oh, no!

846
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:14,571
Ohh!

847
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,637
Goddamn it!

848
01:04:29,796 --> 01:04:30,956
No!

849
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,270
Take her! Take her!

850
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,107
Oh, God, don't hurt me!

851
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:46,046
Oh! Ohh! Ow.

852
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:49,349
Son of a bitch! Oh!

853
01:05:40,317 --> 01:05:42,309
Sit down.

854
01:05:43,455 --> 01:05:46,448
I said sit down.

855
01:05:50,998 --> 01:05:52,694
Who do you work for?

856
01:05:54,636 --> 01:05:59,040
Um, Stern, Kessler,
Goldstein & Krupnik.

857
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:02,376
I'm just a legal secretary.

858
01:06:02,412 --> 01:06:04,141
Sure, Mrs. Tasker.

859
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,741
What were you doing with
the international terrorist...

860
01:06:06,784 --> 01:06:09,117
Carlos the Jackal,
taking dictation?

861
01:06:09,154 --> 01:06:11,247
How long have you been
a member of his faction?

862
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:14,123
I don't know anything
about a faction.

863
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:18,597
I just met Simon...

864
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:21,101
or whoever you say he is...

865
01:06:21,136 --> 01:06:25,574
just a couple weeks ago.
I barely know him.

866
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:27,769
That's not what it looked
like when we found you.

867
01:06:29,112 --> 01:06:31,103
How did you meet him?

868
01:06:33,484 --> 01:06:35,611
Well, ahem...

869
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,732
Keep this for me.

870
01:06:47,768 --> 01:06:49,430
I can't afford
to be taken with it.

871
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,597
What?

872
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,231
It' s a matter
of national security.

873
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,640
- No.
- Please.

874
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,167
It' s important.
I'll contact you.

875
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,204
Shit.

876
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:32,724
Why did you
continue to see him?

877
01:07:32,759 --> 01:07:35,193
He said he needed my help.

878
01:07:35,228 --> 01:07:38,198
Not because
you were attracted to him?

879
01:07:38,232 --> 01:07:39,665
No!

880
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,864
You were not attracted
to him at all?

881
01:07:42,904 --> 01:07:44,497
No.

882
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:50,747
Well, maybe just a little.

883
01:07:51,882 --> 01:07:54,511
So, is cheating
a common thing for you?

884
01:07:54,552 --> 01:07:55,849
No. Never.

885
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:58,356
You're telling me
this was your first time?

886
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:01,087
I wasn't cheating!

887
01:08:01,127 --> 01:08:04,153
Tell me about your husband,
Mrs. Tasker.

888
01:08:04,197 --> 01:08:06,530
Harry?

889
01:08:10,372 --> 01:08:13,171
L... l- -What can I say
about Harry?

890
01:08:14,544 --> 01:08:17,036
I mean, he's a sales rep
for a computer company.

891
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,744
So sex with him
isn't waving your flag anymore?

892
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:23,481
That is none
of your goddamn business!

893
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:24,723
What kind of questions
are these?

894
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:27,726
You're in trouble.
I suggest you cooperate.

895
01:08:27,726 --> 01:08:29,524
If we want to know
intimate details...

896
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,588
about your life,
you'd better tell us.

897
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,436
My husband is a good man.

898
01:08:37,472 --> 01:08:40,601
But he's not exactly
ringing your bell...

899
01:08:40,643 --> 01:08:43,043
Let me handle this part.
Do you mind?

900
01:08:44,782 --> 01:08:47,273
Why did you
go to Carlos' hideout?

901
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:52,154
He wanted me to go to
Paris with him on a mission...

902
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:54,682
to... pose as his wife.

903
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:56,719
And you agreed?

904
01:08:58,332 --> 01:08:59,594
Why?

905
01:09:01,402 --> 01:09:03,495
I don't know.

906
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,434
I guess I needed something.

907
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,968
What did you need?

908
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,419
I needed to feel alive.

909
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,556
I just wanted
to do something outrageous.

910
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,531
And it felt really good...

911
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:33,201
to be needed.

912
01:09:37,648 --> 01:09:39,377
And to be trusted.

913
01:09:42,987 --> 01:09:44,717
And to be special.

914
01:09:46,358 --> 01:09:50,625
It's just that there's so much
I wanted to do with this life...

915
01:09:50,664 --> 01:09:53,498
and it's like
I haven't done any of it.

916
01:09:53,534 --> 01:09:56,002
And the sand's running
out of the hourglass...

917
01:09:56,037 --> 01:09:59,496
and I wanted to be able
to look back and say...

918
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:01,305
"See? I did that!

919
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:06,009
I was reckless, and I was wild,
and I fucking did it!"

920
01:10:11,022 --> 01:10:16,485
Quite frankly, I don't give
a shit whether you understand.

921
01:10:18,398 --> 01:10:20,162
This Simon...

922
01:10:24,206 --> 01:10:25,867
did you sleep with him?

923
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:27,637
No.

924
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:29,076
She's lying.

925
01:10:30,347 --> 01:10:34,114
You mean you did not have
sexual relations with him?

926
01:10:35,886 --> 01:10:39,323
Listen, if you're going to
ask me every question twice...

927
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:41,793
this is going to take
a really long time...

928
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:43,728
and I have to get back
to my family.

929
01:10:43,763 --> 01:10:46,255
You're not
going anywhere, lady.

930
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,770
Just let me out of here!

931
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:50,704
Answer the question.

932
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:54,574
Answer the question!

933
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,272
No!

934
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:59,407
I did not...

935
01:10:59,449 --> 01:11:02,214
sleep... with him!

936
01:11:02,253 --> 01:11:03,413
Calm down, please.

937
01:11:03,454 --> 01:11:06,754
You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

938
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:08,556
Calm down.

939
01:11:08,595 --> 01:11:10,620
She could be
telling the truth.

940
01:11:10,663 --> 01:11:12,791
Calm down, Mrs. Tasker.

941
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:17,300
Calm down, please.

942
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:22,805
I' ve only
one more question, Mrs. Tasker.

943
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,110
What?

944
01:11:27,251 --> 01:11:28,776
Do you...

945
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,947
still love your husband?

946
01:11:36,563 --> 01:11:38,326
Yes, I love him.

947
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,764
I've always loved him.

948
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,672
And I will always love him.

949
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,779
She loves you! Now what?

950
01:11:57,155 --> 01:12:00,250
There's only one solution
to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.

951
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:03,194
You must work for us.

952
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,325
What are you doing, Harry?

953
01:12:06,366 --> 01:12:08,767
Just giving her
a little assignment.

954
01:12:08,803 --> 01:12:10,168
You gotta be shitting me!

955
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:13,266
She wants an adventure.
I'm going to give her one.

956
01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:15,300
I'm offering you a choice.

957
01:12:15,344 --> 01:12:18,781
If you work for us,
we will drop the charges...

958
01:12:18,815 --> 01:12:20,784
and you can go back
to your normal life.

959
01:12:20,818 --> 01:12:24,482
If not, you will go
to a federal prison...

960
01:12:24,523 --> 01:12:26,218
and your husband and daughter...

961
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:29,194
will be left
humiliated and alone.

962
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:31,220
Your life will be destroyed.

963
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:36,926
Oh. Gee. Hmm.

964
01:12:36,972 --> 01:12:38,462
Let me think.

965
01:12:38,507 --> 01:12:40,772
Yes or no?

966
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:43,506
Of course yes.

967
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:44,912
What's involved?

968
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:48,043
You will be contacted
with the assignment.

969
01:12:48,086 --> 01:12:51,078
The code name
of your contact will be Boris.

970
01:12:52,191 --> 01:12:54,421
And your code name will be...

971
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,691
- Natasha?
- No.

972
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,528
Doris.

973
01:13:10,713 --> 01:13:12,807
Pricks!

974
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:23,528
You son of a bitch.

975
01:13:23,563 --> 01:13:25,862
Did you think you could
elude us forever, Carlos?

976
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:28,801
You got the wrong guy.
My name's Simon!

977
01:13:28,836 --> 01:13:32,000
Just let me go.
There's no need to kill me.

978
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:35,169
I haven't seen your face...
Don't! Don't!

979
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,974
I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

980
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:42,207
It's you!

981
01:13:42,286 --> 01:13:45,347
Hey, you still interested
in that 'Vette at all?

982
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,654
Hey, Carlos. The game's over.

983
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:49,753
Your career as an international
terrorist is well -documented.

984
01:13:49,796 --> 01:13:51,525
- No!
- Oh, yeah!

985
01:13:51,564 --> 01:13:54,534
Oh, no!
I sell cars. That's all!

986
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:57,003
Come on.
I'm not a terrorist!

987
01:13:57,038 --> 01:13:58,835
I'm actually a complete coward.

988
01:13:58,873 --> 01:14:01,468
If I ever saw a gun... Oh, God!

989
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:04,378
Oh, please, don't!
Don't! Don't kill me!

990
01:14:06,216 --> 01:14:08,820
I'm not a spy.

991
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,651
I'm nothing!

992
01:14:10,688 --> 01:14:13,487
I'm navel lint!

993
01:14:14,226 --> 01:14:16,661
I have to lie to women
to get laid!

994
01:14:16,696 --> 01:14:18,630
And I don't score much.

995
01:14:18,665 --> 01:14:21,362
I got a little dick.
It's pathetic!

996
01:14:22,937 --> 01:14:25,930
Oh! Oh, God.

997
01:14:25,974 --> 01:14:31,106
Oh!
Would a spy pee himself? Huh?

998
01:14:31,147 --> 01:14:32,877
Oh, God!

999
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:36,821
Please, I' m not worth a bullet.
Oh, mercy, sir.

1000
01:14:36,821 --> 01:14:39,085
Get the fuck outta here, huh?

1001
01:14:39,124 --> 01:14:40,922
Just beat it. Go on.

1002
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,159
No! Soon as I turn,
you're gonna shoot me!

1003
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:47,063
You're gonna shoot me!

1004
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:50,070
Please, you can
have the car for free.

1005
01:14:50,104 --> 01:14:52,539
What do you say, huh?

1006
01:14:53,809 --> 01:14:55,675
Get lost, dipshit.

1007
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:17,628
So, last night must've
been pretty exciting for you.

1008
01:15:21,711 --> 01:15:24,579
Um... my flat tire?

1009
01:15:24,614 --> 01:15:26,138
Actually,
it was a little scary...

1010
01:15:26,183 --> 01:15:29,847
because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.

1011
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:37,819
I'll get it.

1012
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:42,168
Hello?

1013
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:43,865
Doris?

1014
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:46,533
Um...

1015
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,976
Um, yes?

1016
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:51,841
Yes?

1017
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:53,509
Listen carefully.

1018
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,577
In exactly one hour,
go to the Hotel Marquis.

1019
01:15:56,621 --> 01:15:58,816
Pick up an envelope
marked "Doris"...

1020
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:01,622
at the front desk
and dress sexy.

1021
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,820
What?

1022
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,161
Hello?

1023
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:08,134
No, no. Turn around.

1024
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,097
Do it doucement.

1025
01:16:12,141 --> 01:16:14,939
Do it very slowly.

1026
01:16:14,977 --> 01:16:16,570
You've reached a new
all -time low with this one.

1027
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:19,481
I can't believe you're crazy
enough to use the suite.

1028
01:16:19,517 --> 01:16:22,213
Do you think I can afford
a suite on my salary?

1029
01:16:22,253 --> 01:16:24,856
- Is Jean-Claude done yet?
- Hang on.

1030
01:16:24,856 --> 01:16:26,949
Who wrote this shit... Harry?

1031
01:16:26,992 --> 01:16:28,483
C'est la merde.

1032
01:16:29,362 --> 01:16:30,829
It' s going great.

1033
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:46,579
Hi. Do you have
an envelope for Doris?

1034
01:17:04,406 --> 01:17:05,873
This is Doris.

1035
01:17:05,907 --> 01:17:09,935
You are
a prostitute named Michelle.

1036
01:17:09,979 --> 01:17:13,677
Go to the room.
There will be a man there.

1037
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,845
He is a suspected arms dealer.

1038
01:17:15,887 --> 01:17:17,856
Now, wait a minute.

1039
01:17:17,856 --> 01:17:21,293
You don't expect me
to, uh... you know.

1040
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,457
No.
He has particular tastes.

1041
01:17:25,532 --> 01:17:27,626
He likes to watch.

1042
01:17:27,668 --> 01:17:32,470
Tell him that
his regular girl Carla is sick.

1043
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:35,943
If he likes you,
he will tell you what to do.

1044
01:17:35,979 --> 01:17:40,212
You must plant the bug
near the telephone by the bed...

1045
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:41,741
before you leave.

1046
01:17:41,785 --> 01:17:44,755
If you do not
complete your mission...

1047
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:46,848
the deal is off.

1048
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:50,386
I'm gonna go to hell.

1049
01:19:47,276 --> 01:19:48,607
Hello?

1050
01:19:56,988 --> 01:19:58,888
Hello.

1051
01:20:06,299 --> 01:20:08,165
Have some champagne.

1052
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:24,083
Come in here.

1053
01:20:44,614 --> 01:20:46,582
My name is Michelle.

1054
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:48,916
Carla thought you'd like me.

1055
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,014
Let me do the talking.

1056
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:54,786
You may start
by unzipping your dress.

1057
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,296
No, no.

1058
01:20:59,366 --> 01:21:01,163
Turn around.

1059
01:21:01,235 --> 01:21:03,568
Do it doucement.

1060
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:05,833
Do it very slowly.

1061
01:21:11,848 --> 01:21:12,940
Good.

1062
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:18,288
Now slip the dress down slowly.

1063
01:21:30,237 --> 01:21:31,364
Good.

1064
01:21:37,146 --> 01:21:39,115
Now slide your nylons off...

1065
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,413
one by one.

1066
01:21:42,954 --> 01:21:44,751
I'm not wearing any.

1067
01:21:44,856 --> 01:21:46,653
That's good.

1068
01:21:48,427 --> 01:21:50,988
Now, dance for me.

1069
01:21:55,269 --> 01:21:56,930
No, no, no.

1070
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:58,734
Dance sexy.

1071
01:21:58,806 --> 01:22:01,867
Let your hands
be your lover's hands...

1072
01:22:01,944 --> 01:22:03,412
on your own skin as you move.

1073
01:22:45,832 --> 01:22:48,768
It's extreme self-pity

1074
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:53,938
And frozen fear

1075
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:59,704
'Cause I want you with me

1076
01:22:59,783 --> 01:23:02,947
And you're not here

1077
01:23:05,556 --> 01:23:10,551
So I rub my nose in it, babe

1078
01:23:10,629 --> 01:23:15,330
Till the roses
smell just like death

1079
01:23:15,403 --> 01:23:20,000
I'm all alone
in the dark now, baby

1080
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,339
I'm all alone

1081
01:23:22,577 --> 01:23:25,046
In the dark now, baby

1082
01:23:25,114 --> 01:23:26,878
I'm all alone

1083
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:29,647
Drawing whiskey breath

1084
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,383
Alone in the dark

1085
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:39,926
I'm all alone in the dark

1086
01:23:39,967 --> 01:23:44,928
Since the night that you left

1087
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,534
I just couldn't stand
myself anyway

1088
01:23:49,611 --> 01:23:54,413
I'm all alone
in the dark now, baby

1089
01:23:54,484 --> 01:23:59,219
I'm all alone
in the dark now, baby

1090
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:03,956
I'm all alone,
drawing whiskey breath

1091
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:09,197
I'm all alone
in the dark now, baby

1092
01:24:09,269 --> 01:24:11,795
I'm all alone

1093
01:24:11,873 --> 01:24:14,843
Now lie
on the bed and close your eyes.

1094
01:24:20,884 --> 01:24:23,479
I thought
you only liked to watch.

1095
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:32,222
Now lie on the bed
and close your eyes.

1096
01:25:43,855 --> 01:25:45,482
Oh...

1097
01:25:45,556 --> 01:25:47,184
Aah!

1098
01:25:56,937 --> 01:25:58,530
You pig!

1099
01:25:59,774 --> 01:26:00,900
Bastard!

1100
01:26:11,589 --> 01:26:13,648
Helen. Helen.
Wait, wait, wait.

1101
01:26:17,863 --> 01:26:19,161
Harry?

1102
01:26:19,232 --> 01:26:20,665
Yes, it's Harry.

1103
01:26:20,734 --> 01:26:24,539
I know it looks bad,
but I can explain.

1104
01:26:26,007 --> 01:26:28,476
Nobody move!

1105
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:29,636
Don't move!

1106
01:26:32,515 --> 01:26:34,814
Helen, just don't do anything.

1107
01:26:34,852 --> 01:26:37,082
No! I' m the one you want!

1108
01:26:37,121 --> 01:26:38,281
Shut up!

1109
01:26:38,322 --> 01:26:40,655
Quiet, Helen. Do what they say.

1110
01:26:43,996 --> 01:26:46,966
Guys, let the hooker go.
She's not important.

1111
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,467
You don't need her.

1112
01:26:48,502 --> 01:26:51,404
Harry,
please just let me handle this.

1113
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:52,599
Shut up!

1114
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:56,574
What were you doing there?

1115
01:26:57,613 --> 01:26:58,740
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1116
01:26:58,782 --> 01:27:00,773
Talk again, I' II kill you!

1117
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:40,957
Harry.

1118
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:44,961
I wish I could say it's
nice to see you again, Juno.

1119
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:46,132
You know her?

1120
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:51,412
You know, this shade's
totally wrong for you.

1121
01:27:51,447 --> 01:27:53,608
So who's your little friend?

1122
01:27:54,618 --> 01:27:56,415
I'm Helen Tasker.
Harry is my husband.

1123
01:27:56,453 --> 01:27:58,045
And you are?

1124
01:27:58,088 --> 01:28:00,785
So now it's Tasker,
not Renquist.

1125
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:05,986
She's just some
wacko hooker I met at the bar.

1126
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:08,001
What is the matter
with you?

1127
01:28:08,035 --> 01:28:10,003
Just tell her the truth.

1128
01:28:10,037 --> 01:28:12,506
We are married,
and we have a daughter.

1129
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:14,532
I don't know
what the crazy bitch is on...

1130
01:28:14,576 --> 01:28:17,238
but you should cut her loose
so we can get down to business.

1131
01:28:17,313 --> 01:28:20,806
Oh, yeah?
Where did I get this then, huh?

1132
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,375
Where did I get this?

1133
01:28:29,728 --> 01:28:31,162
Something before takeoff?

1134
01:28:31,197 --> 01:28:32,391
Ow!

1135
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,664
That hurt, you b...

1136
01:28:39,774 --> 01:28:42,744
She was telling the truth,
wasn't she, Harry?

1137
01:28:42,778 --> 01:28:44,769
She really doesn't know.

1138
01:28:47,217 --> 01:28:49,208
How interesting.

1139
01:29:38,982 --> 01:29:40,313
Bring them.

1140
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,889
Incredible, aren't they?

1141
01:29:51,864 --> 01:29:54,732
I call them The Four Horsemen.

1142
01:29:54,768 --> 01:29:56,235
They're warrior figures...

1143
01:29:58,106 --> 01:30:03,875
from the Persian Empire
of Darius I, around 500 B.C.

1144
01:30:06,116 --> 01:30:08,584
They're absolutely priceless.

1145
01:30:10,221 --> 01:30:11,347
Pity.

1146
01:30:34,218 --> 01:30:35,549
Wait! Wait!

1147
01:30:38,022 --> 01:30:39,489
Open it.

1148
01:31:09,427 --> 01:31:11,123
Do you know what this is?

1149
01:31:13,232 --> 01:31:15,224
I know what this is.

1150
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,397
This is an espresso machine.

1151
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:24,008
No, no, no.

1152
01:31:24,046 --> 01:31:27,039
It's a snow-cone maker.
That's what it is.

1153
01:31:31,355 --> 01:31:33,380
Is it a water heater?

1154
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:38,793
Do you know
why you've been brought here?

1155
01:31:38,831 --> 01:31:41,800
So that this man
can verify to the world...

1156
01:31:41,834 --> 01:31:45,293
the Crimson Jihad
is now a nuclear power.

1157
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:48,709
How can he do that?

1158
01:31:48,743 --> 01:31:51,144
He is just a salesman,
for Christ's sake.

1159
01:31:55,485 --> 01:31:56,975
You're wrong about him.

1160
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:59,615
The last thing you will see...

1161
01:31:59,657 --> 01:32:02,320
will be your blood
spraying across his face.

1162
01:32:08,268 --> 01:32:10,104
It's a Soviet MIR V-6...

1163
01:32:10,104 --> 01:32:12,766
from an SS-22N launch vehicle.

1164
01:32:12,807 --> 01:32:15,038
The warhead contains
14.5 kilograms...

1165
01:32:15,077 --> 01:32:18,377
of enriched uranium
with a plutonium trigger.

1166
01:32:18,414 --> 01:32:21,042
The nominal yield
is 30 kilotons.

1167
01:32:35,302 --> 01:32:36,667
What can I say?

1168
01:32:37,638 --> 01:32:39,106
I'm a spy.

1169
01:32:47,884 --> 01:32:50,945
You bastard!
You lying son of a bitch!

1170
01:32:50,988 --> 01:32:52,046
Sorry, honey.

1171
01:32:52,089 --> 01:32:53,613
Don't you call me honey!

1172
01:32:53,691 --> 01:32:56,094
You don't ever
get to call me honey again!

1173
01:32:56,094 --> 01:32:58,529
You understand me, you pig?

1174
01:32:58,564 --> 01:33:01,869
I can verify
that they have the arming box...

1175
01:33:02,002 --> 01:33:06,770
and all the equipment necessary
to detonate all four warheads.

1176
01:33:15,686 --> 01:33:19,418
You have killed our women
and our children...

1177
01:33:19,457 --> 01:33:23,292
bombed our cities from afar
like cowards...

1178
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:26,890
and you dare
to call us terrorists?

1179
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:30,370
Now the oppressed have been
given a mighty sword...

1180
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:33,373
with which to strike back
at their enemies.

1181
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:37,469
Unless you, America,
pulls all military forces...

1182
01:33:37,512 --> 01:33:41,883
out of the Persian Gulf area
immediately and forever...

1183
01:33:41,919 --> 01:33:44,547
Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

1184
01:33:44,588 --> 01:33:49,789
on one major U.S. City each week
until our demands are met.

1185
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:52,491
First, we will detonate
one weapon...

1186
01:33:52,531 --> 01:33:57,560
on this uninhabited island as
a demonstration of our power...

1187
01:33:57,604 --> 01:34:01,336
and Crimson Jihad's willingness
to be humanitarian.

1188
01:34:02,244 --> 01:34:05,703
However, if these demands
are not met...

1189
01:34:05,782 --> 01:34:08,216
Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

1190
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:10,982
on one major American city
each week...

1191
01:34:14,593 --> 01:34:16,151
Battery, Aziz.

1192
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:25,338
Get another one, you moron.

1193
01:34:25,372 --> 01:34:27,864
- I think I have...
- Shh. Shh.

1194
01:34:27,909 --> 01:34:29,342
In the truck.

1195
01:34:30,412 --> 01:34:32,175
- Yahrayis?
- What?

1196
01:34:32,214 --> 01:34:33,374
Look at this.

1197
01:34:34,584 --> 01:34:36,074
That's not mine.

1198
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:37,781
Nice transmitter.

1199
01:34:40,324 --> 01:34:42,816
Miami tower,
Jet Star 6479 Delta on final.

1200
01:34:42,861 --> 01:34:45,854
We'll be on the ground
in 12 minutes.

1201
01:34:45,899 --> 01:34:47,867
Tell those DEA boys...

1202
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:49,870
to have the helos hot
and ready to fly in 12 minutes.

1203
01:34:49,904 --> 01:34:51,269
Signal' s definitely
stopped moving.

1204
01:34:51,305 --> 01:34:53,900
It's an island in the keys
out past Marathon.

1205
01:34:59,382 --> 01:35:00,542
We lost the signal.

1206
01:35:00,616 --> 01:35:01,743
Shit!

1207
01:35:20,508 --> 01:35:23,000
All right, everyone.
This is Samir.

1208
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:28,514
For 50 points, see if
you can guess his specialty.

1209
01:35:28,585 --> 01:35:30,554
Oral hygiene?

1210
01:35:30,588 --> 01:35:32,556
Not exactly.

1211
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:34,855
Harry, what's going on?

1212
01:35:34,926 --> 01:35:37,053
Samir's going to ask Harry
a few questions.

1213
01:35:37,128 --> 01:35:41,259
We're not even sure
which agency Harry works for.

1214
01:35:41,334 --> 01:35:43,064
Now, Samir's
absolutely first-class.

1215
01:35:43,136 --> 01:35:44,933
On the other hand,
we have Harry here...

1216
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:47,065
who's managed
to lie convincingly...

1217
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:49,576
to the woman he loves
for 15 years.

1218
01:35:49,612 --> 01:35:54,050
So it'll be interesting
to see how long he can resist.

1219
01:35:54,084 --> 01:35:55,711
This will help.

1220
01:35:57,622 --> 01:35:59,522
You know, you should
swab that with alcohol.

1221
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:02,660
I might get an infection.

1222
01:36:04,196 --> 01:36:06,995
I'll return
when this has taken effect.

1223
01:36:07,767 --> 01:36:09,234
Then we'll talk.

1224
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:12,234
I'm looking forward to it.

1225
01:36:12,306 --> 01:36:15,435
Now why are you helping
these raving psychotics?

1226
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:18,480
Because they're very well -funded
raving psychotics...

1227
01:36:18,514 --> 01:36:21,484
and I' m getting a lot of money.

1228
01:36:24,288 --> 01:36:27,281
What, you think I care
about their cause?

1229
01:36:27,358 --> 01:36:28,825
Or yours?

1230
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,125
Not at all.

1231
01:36:32,364 --> 01:36:34,299
You're damaged goods, lady.

1232
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:43,277
Did you tell her
about us, Harry?

1233
01:36:43,345 --> 01:36:46,645
There is no "us,"
you psychopathic bitch.

1234
01:36:46,716 --> 01:36:48,183
Oh, sure.

1235
01:36:49,486 --> 01:36:50,817
Say that now.

1236
01:36:55,994 --> 01:36:57,860
Thanks for everything, Harry.

1237
01:36:57,897 --> 01:37:00,127
It wasn't bad while it lasted.

1238
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:02,430
Let's go.

1239
01:37:02,502 --> 01:37:04,436
You two stay here.

1240
01:37:10,045 --> 01:37:12,013
There was nothing.

1241
01:37:14,017 --> 01:37:15,279
I swear.

1242
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:40,208
What did they give you?

1243
01:37:43,286 --> 01:37:46,882
Sodium amytal
or some other truth agent.

1244
01:37:48,126 --> 01:37:50,095
It makes you tell the truth?

1245
01:37:50,129 --> 01:37:51,323
Mm-hmm.

1246
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:55,829
Is it working?

1247
01:37:56,903 --> 01:38:00,101
Ask me a question
that I normally would lie to.

1248
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,678
Are we going to die?

1249
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:05,179
Yep.

1250
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,681
I'd say it's working.

1251
01:38:06,716 --> 01:38:08,684
They'll shoot us
in the head...

1252
01:38:08,718 --> 01:38:11,313
or torture us to death...

1253
01:38:11,388 --> 01:38:13,584
or they'll leave us here
until the bomb blows up...

1254
01:38:13,658 --> 01:38:14,784
Harry!

1255
01:38:19,465 --> 01:38:23,197
How long have you
been a spy, Harry?

1256
01:38:26,908 --> 01:38:28,535
Seventeen years.

1257
01:38:41,593 --> 01:38:43,322
Have you ever killed anyone?

1258
01:38:45,465 --> 01:38:47,558
Yeah, but they were all bad.

1259
01:39:18,339 --> 01:39:21,309
Is there anything
you want to tell me...

1260
01:39:21,343 --> 01:39:23,573
before we start?

1261
01:39:23,645 --> 01:39:25,238
Yeah.

1262
01:39:25,314 --> 01:39:27,282
I'm going to kill you
pretty soon.

1263
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:28,647
I see.

1264
01:39:30,521 --> 01:39:32,182
How, exactly?

1265
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:36,894
First, I' m going to use you
as a human shield...

1266
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:40,391
then I' m going to kill
this guard over there...

1267
01:39:40,466 --> 01:39:43,698
with the Patterson trocar
on the table...

1268
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:47,070
and then I was thinking
about breaking your neck.

1269
01:39:48,643 --> 01:39:51,875
And what makes you think
you can do all that?

1270
01:39:51,947 --> 01:39:54,075
You know my handcuffs?

1271
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:55,412
Mmm.

1272
01:39:55,485 --> 01:39:57,249
I picked them.

1273
01:40:20,849 --> 01:40:22,317
Let's get out of here.

1274
01:41:12,481 --> 01:41:13,642
Come on!

1275
01:41:53,499 --> 01:41:54,898
Harry!

1276
01:41:56,369 --> 01:41:57,860
Drop the gun!

1277
01:42:04,746 --> 01:42:05,873
Honey...

1278
01:42:05,915 --> 01:42:07,906
next time, duck.

1279
01:42:13,491 --> 01:42:14,617
Let's go.

1280
01:42:14,659 --> 01:42:16,559
I married Rambo.

1281
01:42:42,394 --> 01:42:43,884
What are they doing?

1282
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:04,550
Uh-oh.

1283
01:43:07,858 --> 01:43:09,486
It is done.

1284
01:43:11,496 --> 01:43:13,965
In 90 minutes...

1285
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,434
a ball of holy fire...

1286
01:43:16,469 --> 01:43:18,665
will light up the skies...

1287
01:43:21,509 --> 01:43:23,204
to show to the world...

1288
01:43:24,345 --> 01:43:26,940
that we speak the truth.

1289
01:43:42,135 --> 01:43:45,003
We are set on our course.

1290
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:47,337
No force can stop us now.

1291
01:43:47,374 --> 01:43:50,310
We are cool, we are badasses,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1292
01:43:50,345 --> 01:43:53,179
If we're on an island,
why are they using trucks?

1293
01:43:53,216 --> 01:43:55,684
We must be in the Florida Keys.

1294
01:43:55,718 --> 01:43:57,186
The Overseas Highway...

1295
01:43:57,221 --> 01:43:59,018
connects all the islands
to the mainland.

1296
01:43:59,056 --> 01:44:01,025
There's no borders, no customs.

1297
01:44:01,059 --> 01:44:04,028
They can go anywhere in the U.S.

1298
01:44:04,062 --> 01:44:05,553
There's nothing to stop them.

1299
01:44:05,598 --> 01:44:07,998
Just us.

1300
01:44:09,903 --> 01:44:11,928
Here. Take this.

1301
01:44:11,972 --> 01:44:13,201
Oh, shit.

1302
01:45:39,214 --> 01:45:40,374
Shoot!

1303
01:45:56,503 --> 01:45:57,697
Shit!

1304
01:46:09,352 --> 01:46:11,479
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1305
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,234
Ohh!

1306
01:47:01,551 --> 01:47:03,041
Whoa!

1307
01:47:10,328 --> 01:47:11,989
Shit!

1308
01:47:49,344 --> 01:47:50,868
Shit!

1309
01:48:28,192 --> 01:48:29,626
Yes!

1310
01:48:57,696 --> 01:48:59,254
Let's go.

1311
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:08,407
Ohh.
My condolences to the widow.

1312
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:27,255
We may need the hostage.

1313
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:32,835
OK, let's go, Suzy Homemaker.

1314
01:49:40,048 --> 01:49:41,277
Hurry up!

1315
01:49:41,317 --> 01:49:43,285
Just get her in the car.
Let's get going.

1316
01:50:54,441 --> 01:50:56,034
I thought this
looked like your work.

1317
01:50:56,111 --> 01:50:57,544
Let's go.
I'll brief you in the air.

1318
01:50:58,813 --> 01:51:00,281
You're welcome.

1319
01:51:00,316 --> 01:51:02,511
Let's go. Let's get out of here!

1320
01:51:02,585 --> 01:51:04,611
Let's go. Come on!

1321
01:51:26,748 --> 01:51:28,717
You tell that son of a bitch...

1322
01:51:28,785 --> 01:51:30,753
this is a Bright Boy Alert.

1323
01:51:30,787 --> 01:51:32,847
I repeat... a Bright Boy Alert.

1324
01:51:32,923 --> 01:51:35,687
This is not a drill.
Do you understand that?

1325
01:51:35,759 --> 01:51:36,920
All right. Hold on.

1326
01:51:36,995 --> 01:51:38,622
Put me through
to the White House.

1327
01:51:38,696 --> 01:51:41,393
No, the minimum
safe distance is 12 miles.

1328
01:51:41,467 --> 01:51:43,458
Get the Marine Patrol
in right away.

1329
01:51:43,536 --> 01:51:45,630
I want the Coast Guard
and the Sheriff's Department.

1330
01:51:45,705 --> 01:51:47,434
Anyone that cannot
make that distance...

1331
01:51:47,507 --> 01:51:48,770
you gotta get 'em out by air.

1332
01:51:48,843 --> 01:51:51,812
OK. You've got exactly
34 minutes.

1333
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:52,972
Wait one.

1334
01:51:53,048 --> 01:51:55,414
I can get two Marine Corps
Harriers here in 11 minutes.

1335
01:51:55,484 --> 01:51:57,783
They're on maneuvers
outside of N.A.S. Key West.

1336
01:51:57,854 --> 01:51:59,344
Get them.
I'll brief them on the way in.

1337
01:51:59,389 --> 01:52:00,948
Send 'em in right away.

1338
01:52:12,406 --> 01:52:13,873
Would you like one?

1339
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:23,115
I want the State Police
driving through the streets...

1340
01:52:23,185 --> 01:52:24,483
on their damn loudspeakers.

1341
01:52:24,554 --> 01:52:26,021
Hey, here they come.

1342
01:52:36,402 --> 01:52:37,869
Lime 0-1's got a tally...

1343
01:52:37,937 --> 01:52:40,406
on three trucks
eastbound on the bridge.

1344
01:52:40,441 --> 01:52:43,205
Roger, Lime 0-1.
You're clear to engage.

1345
01:52:43,277 --> 01:52:45,644
In hot with guns.

1346
01:52:46,414 --> 01:52:47,676
Let's get some.

1347
01:53:52,264 --> 01:53:53,822
OK, Marines,
it's time to kick ass.

1348
01:53:53,899 --> 01:53:56,869
Recommend using your Mavericks
to take out the bridge.

1349
01:53:56,903 --> 01:53:58,871
Roger that. Lime flight,
switch Mavericks.

1350
01:53:58,905 --> 01:54:00,806
Two.

1351
01:54:00,841 --> 01:54:03,241
These missiles won't
set off those nukes, will they?

1352
01:54:03,310 --> 01:54:05,973
Negative.
That's a negative, Lime 0-1.

1353
01:54:08,618 --> 01:54:09,744
Fire.

1354
01:54:31,479 --> 01:54:33,505
- Bingo!
- Good shooting, Marines.

1355
01:54:33,582 --> 01:54:34,947
Aah!

1356
01:54:38,588 --> 01:54:40,580
Aah!

1357
01:55:03,887 --> 01:55:06,856
Aah!

1358
01:55:06,923 --> 01:55:08,414
Aah!

1359
01:55:15,635 --> 01:55:16,727
Hello.

1360
01:55:24,579 --> 01:55:26,342
I' II kill you!

1361
01:55:35,092 --> 01:55:36,287
Aah!

1362
01:55:37,862 --> 01:55:38,988
Aah!

1363
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:45,829
It' s out of control.

1364
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:47,395
Looks like somebody
capped the driver.

1365
01:55:54,816 --> 01:55:56,182
Bitch!

1366
01:56:25,889 --> 01:56:27,858
Like one?

1367
01:56:27,892 --> 01:56:29,693
How about two?

1368
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:57,693
Get down to the limo!

1369
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:03,631
Come on. Take it down.
Let's go!

1370
01:57:04,771 --> 01:57:05,897
Get down!

1371
01:57:05,939 --> 01:57:07,703
Take it down. All right.

1372
01:57:13,915 --> 01:57:15,383
Harry?

1373
01:57:15,418 --> 01:57:16,851
Harry!

1374
01:57:16,886 --> 01:57:19,286
The bridge is out!

1375
01:57:19,322 --> 01:57:20,457
What?

1376
01:57:20,457 --> 01:57:23,393
The bridge is out!

1377
01:57:23,428 --> 01:57:25,463
I can't hear you!

1378
01:57:25,463 --> 01:57:27,055
What?

1379
01:57:29,034 --> 01:57:30,626
Oh, God!

1380
01:57:30,669 --> 01:57:32,137
The bridge is out!

1381
01:57:32,172 --> 01:57:34,474
The bridge is out!

1382
01:57:34,474 --> 01:57:35,806
Harry!

1383
01:57:35,843 --> 01:57:37,936
Harry, come on! Come on!

1384
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:39,675
Speed up a little bit.

1385
01:57:39,715 --> 01:57:41,148
Get down there.

1386
01:57:48,959 --> 01:57:50,688
Come on! Hurry!

1387
01:57:50,728 --> 01:57:52,720
Hurry, Harry!

1388
01:57:52,764 --> 01:57:54,425
Grab my hand!

1389
01:57:54,466 --> 01:57:56,059
Come back! Harry!

1390
01:57:56,102 --> 01:57:57,262
To the right.

1391
01:57:57,303 --> 01:57:59,864
I can't reach! Get lower!

1392
01:58:01,475 --> 01:58:03,307
Lower! Harry!

1393
01:58:09,818 --> 01:58:12,310
Let's go! Hold on!

1394
01:58:12,355 --> 01:58:13,686
Hold on really tight.

1395
01:58:15,993 --> 01:58:18,154
Harry!

1396
01:58:18,195 --> 01:58:19,754
Harry!

1397
01:58:19,798 --> 01:58:21,129
Oh, come back!

1398
01:58:21,166 --> 01:58:22,633
Pull up, pull up, pull up!

1399
01:58:25,772 --> 01:58:28,071
Grab my hand! Do it!

1400
01:58:28,108 --> 01:58:29,541
I can't reach!

1401
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:31,238
Come down!

1402
01:58:31,279 --> 01:58:33,907
Oh, God, Harry!

1403
01:58:33,949 --> 01:58:35,143
Harry!

1404
01:58:38,788 --> 01:58:40,950
Oh, shit.

1405
01:58:42,259 --> 01:58:43,750
Come on, baby.

1406
01:58:46,965 --> 01:58:50,925
Ooooaaaaahhhh!

1407
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:53,064
Hold on!

1408
01:58:53,106 --> 01:58:54,698
I got you!

1409
01:58:56,477 --> 01:58:57,944
Hold on tight!

1410
01:58:57,979 --> 01:58:59,811
Harry!

1411
01:59:31,254 --> 01:59:33,119
OK, let's get
this thing on the ground.

1412
01:59:33,156 --> 01:59:35,284
Whoo!

1413
01:59:43,202 --> 01:59:45,329
Let's get these aircraft
on the ground, gentlemen.

1414
01:59:45,371 --> 01:59:47,806
We got a nuclear bomb
going off in about one minute.

1415
01:59:52,447 --> 01:59:54,972
Any minute now. Go, go, go.

1416
01:59:56,018 --> 01:59:57,576
Come here. Give me a bullhorn.

1417
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:01,619
All right, everybody,
it's showtime.

1418
02:00:01,658 --> 02:00:04,594
Do not look at the flash!
Do not look at the flash!

1419
02:00:04,629 --> 02:00:06,096
Get down over there.

1420
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:07,826
We should be safe here.

1421
02:00:14,908 --> 02:00:16,968
Tsk, tsk.

1422
02:00:17,011 --> 02:00:19,173
This is the wrong finger.

1423
02:00:56,861 --> 02:01:00,059
Harry. Hey, Harry, come here!

1424
02:01:01,099 --> 02:01:02,396
- Go to work.
- OK.

1425
02:01:02,434 --> 02:01:04,062
Bye.

1426
02:01:04,103 --> 02:01:05,502
OK. All right.

1427
02:01:05,538 --> 02:01:07,097
Listen, Aziz's copter
landed about 20 minutes ago...

1428
02:01:07,141 --> 02:01:08,472
on top a high-rise
in downtown Miami.

1429
02:01:08,509 --> 02:01:09,601
It' s right here.

1430
02:01:09,643 --> 02:01:12,112
He rendezvoused with about
a dozen faction members...

1431
02:01:12,147 --> 02:01:13,409
and they're holed up
on the twentieth floor.

1432
02:01:13,448 --> 02:01:14,472
I got S.W.A.T. Down there...

1433
02:01:14,516 --> 02:01:15,711
and the cops cordoned off
the area.

1434
02:01:16,919 --> 02:01:19,445
Harry, they got a hostage.
It's Dana.

1435
02:01:20,657 --> 02:01:22,990
What do you mean? My Dana?

1436
02:01:23,027 --> 02:01:25,461
I' m real sorry, Harry.
I don't know what to say.

1437
02:01:25,496 --> 02:01:27,488
I guess he grabbed her
in the middle of the night.

1438
02:01:27,533 --> 02:01:29,228
We just found out.

1439
02:01:29,268 --> 02:01:31,703
But don't worry.
We'll get her back.

1440
02:01:31,738 --> 02:01:33,535
I've already got a guy inside.

1441
02:01:33,573 --> 02:01:35,633
Harry, listen.
We're going to get her back.

1442
02:01:35,676 --> 02:01:37,041
Here we go.

1443
02:01:39,014 --> 02:01:40,606
Excuse me, Captain.

1444
02:01:40,649 --> 02:01:42,948
- I got to borrow your plane.
- Excuse me, sir?

1445
02:01:42,985 --> 02:01:46,011
You were cleared to give us
total cooperation, right?

1446
02:01:46,055 --> 02:01:47,182
Yes, sir, but...

1447
02:01:47,224 --> 02:01:48,452
That comes directly
from the President

1448
02:01:48,492 --> 02:01:50,119
of these United States.

1449
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,891
But, sir, you'll have
to sign for this aircraft.

1450
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:56,060
I' II sign. You got a pen?
You take care of it.

1451
02:01:57,102 --> 02:01:59,196
Harry, do you realize
it has been 10 years...

1452
02:01:59,239 --> 02:02:00,331
since you've been behind
the wheel of one of these?

1453
02:02:00,373 --> 02:02:03,866
If I break it,
they can take it out of my pay.

1454
02:02:03,911 --> 02:02:06,744
Harry, listen,
we got a guy on the inside.

1455
02:02:10,085 --> 02:02:11,246
Whoa!

1456
02:02:13,089 --> 02:02:15,422
Got to move back, everybody. Go!

1457
02:02:33,114 --> 02:02:35,106
All right, everybody,
it's going to be all right!

1458
02:02:37,486 --> 02:02:39,955
He's got hundreds of hours
in the Harrier there.

1459
02:02:43,928 --> 02:02:45,361
He is a little rusty now...

1460
02:02:45,396 --> 02:02:48,127
but that's a trademark
Tasker takeoff.

1461
02:02:48,166 --> 02:02:51,364
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget, really.

1462
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:56,372
We might want
to seek shelter!

1463
02:03:01,549 --> 02:03:03,142
Sorry.

1464
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:06,053
Fuck!

1465
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:27,648
The streets are filled
with running people...

1466
02:03:27,683 --> 02:03:29,810
as the police
try to evacuate the buildings.

1467
02:03:29,851 --> 02:03:31,342
They're firing again.

1468
02:03:31,387 --> 02:03:33,981
Appear to be
shooting wildly into the air.

1469
02:03:34,023 --> 02:03:35,855
These seem to be warning shots.

1470
02:03:35,893 --> 02:03:38,863
So far, they have not fired
at us or the police.

1471
02:03:38,897 --> 02:03:40,455
This apparently
is the same group...

1472
02:03:40,498 --> 02:03:43,366
which just detonated a nuclear
bomb in the Florida Keys.

1473
02:03:43,402 --> 02:03:45,029
Crimson Jihad
will rain fire...

1474
02:03:45,071 --> 02:03:50,510
on one major U.S. City each week
until our demands are met.

1475
02:03:50,544 --> 02:03:53,013
This tape was released
to the media...

1476
02:03:53,047 --> 02:03:55,016
just minutes
after the terrorists...

1477
02:03:55,050 --> 02:03:57,518
I have to go to the bathroom.

1478
02:03:57,553 --> 02:04:00,523
We'll repeat the tape
in just a few moments...

1479
02:04:00,557 --> 02:04:02,354
following this live report
from the scene.

1480
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:07,862
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1481
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:09,127
The video crew
you wanted is here!

1482
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:10,327
Send them!

1483
02:04:13,239 --> 02:04:15,765
They're coming in.
They're unarmed.

1484
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:33,964
Come on. Let's go.

1485
02:04:34,032 --> 02:04:35,193
Go.

1486
02:04:41,274 --> 02:04:41,608
This is a communique
from Crimson Jihad.

1487
02:04:41,608 --> 02:04:44,339
This is a communique
from Crimson Jihad.

1488
02:04:44,378 --> 02:04:47,371
You have seen a demonstration
of our power.

1489
02:04:47,416 --> 02:04:50,875
Do not force us
to destroy this city...

1490
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:52,979
and do not try to use
force against us.

1491
02:04:53,056 --> 02:04:55,890
L... we... are all
prepared to die.

1492
02:04:55,926 --> 02:04:57,860
With one turn of that key...

1493
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:02,890
two million of your people
will die instantly.

1494
02:05:02,935 --> 02:05:04,869
- What key?
- That key!

1495
02:05:05,938 --> 02:05:08,134
Who's taken the key?

1496
02:05:14,315 --> 02:05:15,476
Shoot her!

1497
02:05:40,915 --> 02:05:43,146
Holy shit!

1498
02:05:43,185 --> 02:05:44,914
Whoa.

1499
02:06:15,259 --> 02:06:18,422
Unit One to Unit Seven.
Give me a situation report.

1500
02:06:18,463 --> 02:06:19,987
One to Seven. Give me a sit rep.

1501
02:06:20,031 --> 02:06:21,999
Faisil, do you copy?

1502
02:06:22,033 --> 02:06:24,525
Seven here.
Twenty-first floor secure.

1503
02:06:24,603 --> 02:06:27,539
About twelve faction members
on the twentieth floor.

1504
02:06:27,607 --> 02:06:28,767
No hostages there.

1505
02:06:28,808 --> 02:06:30,970
- Where's Dana?
- She's on the roof.

1506
02:06:31,012 --> 02:06:32,274
OK. Stay put.

1507
02:06:32,313 --> 02:06:33,610
Give me that address again.

1508
02:06:40,089 --> 02:06:41,886
You shoot me, this'll fall!

1509
02:06:44,562 --> 02:06:45,688
Stay where you are!

1510
02:06:45,729 --> 02:06:47,493
Stay where you are!

1511
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:52,733
Give me the key!

1512
02:06:52,772 --> 02:06:54,502
I'll drop it, I swear!

1513
02:06:54,541 --> 02:06:56,031
No!

1514
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:00,548
Give me the key.

1515
02:07:00,582 --> 02:07:02,015
Come on, child.

1516
02:07:02,050 --> 02:07:04,519
You don't want to die, do you?

1517
02:07:06,389 --> 02:07:07,686
Give me the key...

1518
02:07:07,724 --> 02:07:10,888
and you won't get hurt.

1519
02:07:10,928 --> 02:07:13,089
I give you my word!

1520
02:07:14,265 --> 02:07:16,632
No way, you wacko!

1521
02:07:21,641 --> 02:07:24,236
Help me!

1522
02:08:14,608 --> 02:08:16,769
Please don't come
any closer!

1523
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:18,175
Aah!

1524
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:21,311
Help me! Help me!

1525
02:08:21,382 --> 02:08:22,782
Somebody!

1526
02:08:25,587 --> 02:08:26,987
Help me!

1527
02:08:27,023 --> 02:08:28,513
Help me, please!

1528
02:08:28,591 --> 02:08:30,560
Help me, somebody!

1529
02:08:30,594 --> 02:08:32,084
Help!

1530
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:36,697
Dana, jump down!

1531
02:08:36,735 --> 02:08:38,260
Come on down. Jump down.

1532
02:08:38,338 --> 02:08:40,329
Dad?

1533
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:50,619
Help me!

1534
02:08:50,619 --> 02:08:52,746
Daddy!

1535
02:09:25,963 --> 02:09:28,194
Daddy! Come back!

1536
02:09:33,038 --> 02:09:35,337
Daddy, get me down!

1537
02:09:35,409 --> 02:09:36,637
Daddy!

1538
02:09:38,946 --> 02:09:40,538
Dana, jump!

1539
02:09:40,581 --> 02:09:43,676
Jump! Daddy will catch you!

1540
02:09:43,719 --> 02:09:45,954
- Jump!
- I can't!

1541
02:09:45,954 --> 02:09:47,946
- Jump!
- I can't!

1542
02:09:50,161 --> 02:09:51,458
Hold on. Hold on!

1543
02:09:53,964 --> 02:09:55,455
Arrr!

1544
02:10:01,073 --> 02:10:03,338
Daddy, don't you
let me fall, please!

1545
02:10:03,377 --> 02:10:05,572
- Daddy!
- Dana, I got you!

1546
02:10:05,612 --> 02:10:06,739
I' m slipping!

1547
02:10:09,684 --> 02:10:11,277
No, Dana!

1548
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:13,288
Help me! I' m gonna fall!

1549
02:10:19,764 --> 02:10:21,391
Hold my hand!

1550
02:10:25,437 --> 02:10:27,804
Hold on tight, honey.

1551
02:10:27,841 --> 02:10:29,240
Yaah!

1552
02:11:00,681 --> 02:11:02,582
Ahh!

1553
02:11:23,677 --> 02:11:24,974
Daddy, he's behind you!

1554
02:11:26,247 --> 02:11:28,044
Take this plane down now!

1555
02:11:28,082 --> 02:11:29,674
I'll kill her!

1556
02:11:29,717 --> 02:11:32,482
Take it down now!

1557
02:11:41,299 --> 02:11:46,170
Ohh!

1558
02:11:49,342 --> 02:11:51,504
My God, do something!

1559
02:11:54,215 --> 02:11:55,409
Huh?

1560
02:11:59,121 --> 02:12:00,281
You're fired.

1561
02:12:02,492 --> 02:12:04,619
Aah!

1562
02:12:04,661 --> 02:12:07,460
Aah!

1563
02:12:07,498 --> 02:12:09,125
- Aah!
- Aah!

1564
02:12:46,114 --> 02:12:47,741
It' s OK.

1565
02:12:49,450 --> 02:12:50,577
Dana.

1566
02:12:50,619 --> 02:12:51,745
Honey.

1567
02:12:51,787 --> 02:12:53,448
It's over.

1568
02:13:02,634 --> 02:13:04,499
Hi, pumpkin.

1569
02:13:08,041 --> 02:13:10,067
Just seconds after
the jet landed...

1570
02:13:10,144 --> 02:13:13,113
the unidentified pilot
was escorted from the scene...

1571
02:13:13,147 --> 02:13:14,615
by federal agents.

1572
02:13:14,649 --> 02:13:17,618
Though it is unclear
which agency was responsible...

1573
02:13:17,652 --> 02:13:19,814
for the operation which ended
the terrorist threat...

1574
02:13:19,855 --> 02:13:22,051
so dramatically
early this morning...

1575
02:13:22,092 --> 02:13:24,117
we've learned
from Miami police...

1576
02:13:25,629 --> 02:13:26,756
One...

1577
02:13:26,798 --> 02:13:29,596
No, wait. Stop.
Just begin. Now watch.

1578
02:13:29,634 --> 02:13:30,897
It's not just one.

1579
02:13:30,936 --> 02:13:32,904
OK, ready? Do it properly.

1580
02:13:32,971 --> 02:13:34,098
One...

1581
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:36,608
One, two, three, four...

1582
02:13:36,643 --> 02:13:38,612
I declare a thumb war.

1583
02:13:38,646 --> 02:13:40,273
Five, six, seven, eight...

1584
02:13:40,314 --> 02:13:42,112
try to keep your thumb straight.

1585
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:43,879
Stop it!

1586
02:13:43,919 --> 02:13:45,147
You don't wait!

1587
02:13:45,187 --> 02:13:46,917
I got you.

1588
02:13:46,956 --> 02:13:48,821
Just listen.
Listen to the rules.

1589
02:13:48,858 --> 02:13:49,985
One, two...

1590
02:13:51,295 --> 02:13:52,922
No. Just start over.

1591
02:13:54,132 --> 02:13:55,599
Hello?

1592
02:13:55,633 --> 02:13:56,895
Boris and Doris?

1593
02:13:58,170 --> 02:13:59,899
We're on.

1594
02:14:01,173 --> 02:14:03,870
Yes? Go ahead.

1595
02:14:30,644 --> 02:14:33,112
Colonel,
how nice to see you again.

1596
02:14:33,147 --> 02:14:34,410
Good evening.

1597
02:14:35,650 --> 02:14:37,117
Who's that?

1598
02:14:41,223 --> 02:14:44,625
Doo doo...

1599
02:14:44,661 --> 02:14:46,630
Doo doo doo doo...

1600
02:14:46,664 --> 02:14:48,131
What's the scoop, team?

1601
02:14:48,166 --> 02:14:49,634
You see your contact yet?

1602
02:14:49,701 --> 02:14:51,225
Haven't seen him yet.

1603
02:14:52,905 --> 02:14:55,932
But I see somebody
I'd like to say hello to.

1604
02:14:56,009 --> 02:14:57,978
Let me pour you
some more champagne.

1605
02:14:58,012 --> 02:15:00,640
I got to keep up
the waiter bit.

1606
02:15:00,681 --> 02:15:02,149
These stakeouts
can be tricky.

1607
02:15:02,184 --> 02:15:04,652
You never know
when things might explode...

1608
02:15:04,686 --> 02:15:06,621
into a life or death situation.

1609
02:15:06,656 --> 02:15:07,748
If it gets rough...

1610
02:15:07,790 --> 02:15:10,521
just stay low until it's over,
and I' II contact you later.

1611
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:12,119
Maybe you should
give me your tel- -

1612
02:15:12,196 --> 02:15:14,188
So, we meet again, Carlos.

1613
02:15:14,265 --> 02:15:15,823
Yuh!

1614
02:15:18,237 --> 02:15:20,137
Honey, I' m just going
to do him right here, OK?

1615
02:15:20,172 --> 02:15:21,970
Go for it.

1616
02:15:23,643 --> 02:15:25,201
Oh, God.

1617
02:15:31,153 --> 02:15:33,383
Fear is not an option.

1618
02:15:45,337 --> 02:15:47,135
Dance?

1619
02:15:50,344 --> 02:15:51,641
- Oh, no.
- Tango.

1620
02:15:51,678 --> 02:15:53,213
Oh, shit. Here we go.

1621
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:10,429
Harry, Helen?

1622
02:16:10,469 --> 02:16:11,561
Guys?

1623
02:16:11,603 --> 02:16:14,072
Come on, now.
Let's not get distracted.

1624
02:16:14,107 --> 02:16:15,301
We got some work to do.

1625
02:16:21,583 --> 02:16:23,574
All right, guys. Come on.

1626
02:16:24,986 --> 02:16:26,045
You guys better get
serious in there.

1627
02:16:26,088 --> 02:16:28,579
I'd be serious
if I was in there.

1628
02:16:30,627 --> 02:16:32,185
Don't ignore me, Harry.

1629
02:16:32,229 --> 02:16:33,754
That's rude.

1630
02:16:36,868 --> 02:16:38,268
All right, guys. Come on.

1631
02:16:41,608 --> 02:16:43,576
National security, guys.
Come on.

1632
02:16:43,610 --> 02:16:45,100
Life and death.

1633
02:16:48,115 --> 02:16:49,343
Harry.

1634
02:16:50,619 --> 02:16:51,881
Harry.

1635
02:16:51,954 --> 02:16:53,080
Helen?

1636
02:16:53,121 --> 02:16:56,091
Helen, I was always
on your side.

1637
02:16:56,125 --> 02:16:57,991
I was always
there for you, Helen.

1638
02:17:37,010 --> 02:17:38,410
You know what?

1639
02:17:38,445 --> 02:17:39,878
I'm sick of being in the van.

1640
02:17:39,913 --> 02:17:42,815
You guys are going to be
in the van next time.

1641
02:17:42,851 --> 02:17:45,554
I been in the van
for 15 years, Harry.

1642
02:19:27,414 --> 02:19:30,043
It's getting near dawn

1643
02:19:31,286 --> 02:19:35,417
And the light
falls on tired eyes

1644
02:19:35,491 --> 02:19:39,929
I'll soon be with you, my love

1645
02:19:39,963 --> 02:19:43,991
And give you my dawn surprise

1646
02:19:44,035 --> 02:19:48,336
I'll stay with you, darling, now

1647
02:19:48,407 --> 02:19:49,568
I'll stay with you

1648
02:19:49,609 --> 02:19:54,809
Till my seeds are dried up

1649
02:19:59,988 --> 02:20:01,581
Hey

1650
02:20:01,624 --> 02:20:05,925
I've been waiting so long

1651
02:20:05,963 --> 02:20:09,798
I've been waiting so long

1652
02:20:09,834 --> 02:20:14,238
I've been waiting so long

1653
02:20:14,273 --> 02:20:18,472
To be where I' m going

1654
02:20:18,545 --> 02:20:29,254
In the sunshine of your love

1655
02:20:29,292 --> 02:20:34,526
