00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ripped & synched by Fingersmaster.
Enjoy!

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,200
With this ring be thou consecrated
unto me as my wife.

3
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:42,890
According to the law of Moses
and faith of Israel.

4
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:45,835
According to the law of Moses
and faith of Israel.

5
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:49,047
And you, Judy,
say to Yale these words.

6
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:50,716
Take the ring.

7
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:56,680
This ring is a symbol
that you are my husband.

8
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,209
This ring is a symbol
that you are my husband.

9
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,728
And a sign of my love and devotion.

10
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,755
And a sign of my love and devotion.

11
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,341
In the presence of these witnesses...

12
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,995
...you've spoken the words
and performed the rites...

13
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,263
...which unite your lives.

14
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:14,016
I therefore declare you,
Yale and Judy...

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,419
...husband and wife.

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,355
Step on it.

17
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,317
Mazel tov!

18
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:18,402
But I only have eyes

19
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:21,364
For you

20
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:24,535
Judy Goodman

21
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:26,345
Why? You have a late date?

22
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:30,374
No, I told your Uncle Phil
I'd meet him to look at his lease.

23
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,711
- You're not going to work now?
- No, I'm not going to work.

24
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:36,965
He thinks he's getting evicted.
Let me just talk to him.

25
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:38,318
Okay?

26
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:42,220
- Thanks for marrying me.
- You're welcome.

27
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:45,182
Get me a Perrier with a twist?

28
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,985
- Arnie!
- So you did it, huh?

29
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,780
I can't believe you married Goodman...

30
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,907
...when you could've had me.

31
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,577
I could have lived with you, Arnie.

32
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,705
Big difference.

33
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,500
Judy!

34
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:14,715
Look who I found!
Mr. Waxman, the upholsterer.

35
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:19,219
I didn't recognize you
without nails in your mouth.

36
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:23,932
I brought a little something
I think you're going to love.

37
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:36,030
Mr. Waxman, you finished the ottoman!

38
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,782
Yale will be thrilled.

39
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:42,536
Wait a minute!
Is this mushroom piping?

40
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:45,665
Looks beige-y to me, Ma.
This isn't the right color, is it?

41
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,042
Ben...

42
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,169
...what happened to the mushroom?

43
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,006
That's as close as you're going
to get to mushroom in Philadelphia.

44
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:56,219
Mr. Waxman, we've been
through this a zillion times.

45
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,597
I told you I'm doing Yale's study
in mushroom.

46
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:03,893
I'm sure you could've found
a yard of mushroom fabric.

47
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:07,689
You want it, I'll get it.

48
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,275
This is your night!

49
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:13,737
Wheels?!

50
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:16,533
Mr. Waxman, I wanted upholstered balls.

51
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,537
Upholstered balls?

52
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,467
- Come on, Peanut.
- Where're we going?

53
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,678
- My feet hurt.
- Your feet will be fine.

54
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,222
I just want to talk to you.

55
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,150
What? Want a divorce already?

56
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,528
Darling, I have a very bad headache.

57
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:54,949
No wonder, you've danced all night.
I'll get some Tylenol from Mom.

58
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,241
Sweetheart...

59
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,537
...it's not a Tylenol headache.

60
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,206
- Honey!
- Please?

61
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:04,585
- Honey, not here!
- Please, why not? Come on!

62
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:07,629
Why? Because everybody
I know is ten feet away.

63
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,092
- They're having a good time. Please?
- No, I'll ruin my dress.

64
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:15,013
- Your dress is fine. Come on!
- Honey, please? I don't want to.

65
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:20,644
Kiss me first.

66
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:37,871
I love you so much.

67
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,498
Hi, Yale.

68
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,086
Judy's always been
a good girl. Always!

69
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:46,881
She made a mistake
with the first husband.

70
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:51,220
That's ancient history. The smartest
thing she ever did was to marry you.

71
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,470
That's nice, Teddy.

72
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,932
It's very important
for a father to know...

73
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,560
...his daughter's going to be
well taken care of. Don't laugh!

74
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,065
You'll know what I mean
when your daughter gets married.

75
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,192
Anyway, that's number one.

76
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,777
Number two!

77
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,820
We'll still have Sunday breakfasts?

78
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,865
- Of course, Daddy.
- Good.

79
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:12,535
You can get the whitefish
on your way over.

80
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:17,122
I want to give you two
a little something from mother and me...

81
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:18,832
...a little extra happiness.

82
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:24,589
I guess it's not
carpeting for the living room.

83
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,097
That's for the future, not
Lord and Taylor, you little jerk!

84
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:36,853
Teddy, you're amazing!

85
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:40,314
It's my pleasure.
Just use it in good health.

86
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,984
Thanks, Mom.

87
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,403
I'll show my mother,
she'll go crazy!

88
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,905
I can't believe it!

89
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:50,910
Jude, get me a cigarette.

90
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,917
Coming back inside, Daddy?

91
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:01,297
I just want to see the recap
of tonight's game.

92
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:03,924
Should I wait for you here?

93
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,930
Dad?

94
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:13,184
Get me a match, doll.

95
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:30,328
Jerry, if you call her you'll
screw it up. That's my job, all right?

96
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:31,578
No, to call her.

97
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:35,834
How long you married? Anything more
than 15 years, you lose the house.

98
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:38,962
It's not my rule,
that's just the way it is.

99
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,215
Keep the boat, it's a male item.

100
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:46,429
Prenups is the only way
to get around this and it's too late.

101
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,641
Give her the microwave,
it's a built-in!

102
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:52,937
It comes with the house.
What'll you do with one oven?

103
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,357
It's late now.
6:30 a.m. Monday...

104
00:08:56,607 --> 00:09:00,402
...we'll play racquetball. We'll
figure it out then. Can you wait?

105
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:02,989
We'll be in Jamaica
6:30 Monday.

106
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,908
I'll be on my honeymoon Monday.

107
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:06,868
I'll call you from Jamaica.

108
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:08,870
I don't know, from the hotel.

109
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:12,707
No, you'll be halved at worst.
You're okay.

110
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,710
Prenups, babe!

111
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,675
- That'll never happen to us.
- I know.

112
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,930
- Did this bathroom turn out gorgeous?
- This ass is gorgeous.

113
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,682
Come here.

114
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,103
- What?
- Wait, honey.

115
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,272
Wait just one second.

116
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,942
- Lift your back leg.
- I don't have a back leg.

117
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:40,864
It's our wedding night. It's not
real romantic making love in the sink.

118
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:44,493
- It's romantic making love anywhere.
- I know. I love you.

119
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:49,081
- Let's go into the bedroom.
- We're going into the bedroom next.

120
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:52,209
Just here. Good, sweetie!

121
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:54,086
Honey, good!

122
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,592
You're on my hair,
get off my hair.

123
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:00,927
How's that?

124
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,608
- Oh, honey!
- What?

125
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,780
- Oh, sweetie!
- What?

126
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,033
I'm coming!

127
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:35,716
Why don't we go and get in bed?

128
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:56,739
Oh, God, full of compassion,
thou who dwellest on high.

129
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,035
Grant perfect rest unto
the soul of Yale Goodman...

130
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,579
...who has departed from this world.

131
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,875
Lord of mercy, bring him
into Thy presence...

132
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:12,089
...and let his soul be bound up
in the bond of eternal life.

133
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,591
Amen.

134
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,512
I can't try to console you...

135
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:20,390
...by saying there is
any justice in this world.

136
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,017
Just be thankful for the friendship...

137
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:27,398
...and tenderness you and Yale
had the opportunity to share.

138
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,946
My philosophy of life has gotten me
through some very rough times.

139
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:36,323
Let me share it with you.

140
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,870
Que será será.

141
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:43,999
I got it from the song.

142
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:56,888
Judith?

143
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:00,601
Just one thing.

144
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,020
If you can remember...

145
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:07,190
...what were Yale's last words?

146
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,821
"I'm coming."

147
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:16,117
I know you don't want to hear this...

148
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:20,539
...but you got to get
right back into circulation.

149
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,585
When you fall off the horse,
you got to climb right back on.

150
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,213
Aunt Kissy, please!

151
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:31,134
Could I be alone now?

152
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,303
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,145
She wants to be alone.

154
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,481
She wants to be alone.

155
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:47,401
She doesn't want to live in their place.
I can't blame her.

156
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:52,115
- Sell everything and buy her new.
- Buy her new? She'll live with us.

157
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:55,911
- What if she doesn't want to?
- She doesn't know what she wants.

158
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:59,540
And what's she going to do now?
Be my secretary again?

159
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:04,462
The girl's 29 years old
and trained to do nothing.

160
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,631
I'm 28.

161
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:21,273
Look what we got!

162
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:57,395
I've never not belonged to somebody.

163
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:58,730
Never.

164
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,026
My first boyfriend was
in nursery school. I was two...

165
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,153
...and he was three and since then...

166
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:08,657
...I've been pinned,
lavaliered, engaged...

167
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:11,118
...married twice.

168
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:14,789
The first time, I was twenty.

169
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,002
See, I've been in this room
eight days...

170
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:24,008
...and it's really the first eight days
I've ever been alone in my life.

171
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,552
If I'm not going to be married...

172
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:30,348
...I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with myself.

173
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,853
Did you happen to see
that movie Unmarried Woman?

174
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:38,232
Well, I didn't get it.

175
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:41,151
I would've been
Mrs. Alan Bates so fast...

176
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:43,821
...that guy wouldn't have
known what hit him.

177
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,616
The thing is, and then I'll shut up...

178
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,163
...I haven't done anything wrong.

179
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:55,542
And I feel like I'm being punished!

180
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:00,839
I thought I'd be
filling up my freezer...

181
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,804
...and be getting this new
pine sideboard that I ordered and...

182
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,940
Jessica, I do hate...

183
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,277
...to stop your free association,
but our switchboard's flooded.

184
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:23,489
So set your phone down
and turn your radio up, okay?

185
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,409
Hello, Night Owl,
you're on the air.

186
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:29,621
You lucked out. I read in
the Enquirer this morning...

187
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,456
...that marriage causes cancer.

188
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:34,002
Philadelphia Night Owl,
you're on the air.

189
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:37,547
About that Palestinian homeland.
In your Bible you'll see...

190
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:40,592
...that the Arabs had first dibs
on the West Bank.

191
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,010
Not tonight, Del, thanks.

192
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,430
Line 4, have you
got advice for Jessica?

193
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,765
Yes, I do. Hi, Jessica.

194
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,058
My name is Jim.

195
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:50,519
First let me say
how terribly sorry I am...

196
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,855
...about your misfortune.

197
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:56,985
And nobody knows better than you
that things can't get much worse.

198
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:01,239
It's also pretty obvious that
you need guidance, security...

199
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:05,453
...good friends and a healthy dose
of self-confidence, Jessica.

200
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:10,833
What I'm saying is,
I think I can help you find a new life.

201
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,487
- Are you Jessica?
- Jim?

202
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:37,988
Yeah, hi.

203
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:40,407
Am I late or you early?

204
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:42,660
I'm just a few hours early.

205
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,161
Come on.

206
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,544
I should tell you,
my name is really Judy.

207
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:55,257
I just didn't want anybody I knew
to hear me on the radio.

208
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:57,927
- Macht nichts.
- What?

209
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:01,013
It means,
"It makes no difference" in German.

210
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,641
I was stationed over there
for 26 months.

211
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:09,022
What does that look like to you?

212
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,941
What? Club Med?

213
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:14,778
It's the Fort Ord Army
Base in Monterey, California.

214
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,365
Those look like condos.

215
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:22,453
And every soldier gets
his or her own private room.

216
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:24,289
What are these, yachts?

217
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:28,419
The Army is the best-kept secret
in the world, Judy.

218
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:31,630
Looks great, but you don't know me.

219
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,841
I'm not the Army type.

220
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:36,635
Forget that old brown boot
image of the Army.

221
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:41,266
It's the 80s Army, all the ladies love
it. All 89,000 of them.

222
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,060
Check out this list of jobs.

223
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:48,774
There's over 300 jobs, and only
a couple of them not offered to ladies.

224
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,235
Trained killers, stuff like that.

225
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,989
- How much do you earn per month now?
- Now?

226
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,073
Nothing.

227
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,493
Nothing?

228
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,207
Thanks.

229
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,294
What are you thinking?

230
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,425
I'm thinking about...

231
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,137
...my family...

232
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,556
...and my house...

233
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,937
...and all the gifts I have to return.

234
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,904
You shouldn't be saddled with a lot of
responsibilities and decisions now.

235
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:36,284
I'm prepared to offer you $458 a month,
train you in the job of your choice...

236
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:39,580
...pay for your food, your housing,
all your medical...

237
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,542
...and give you a 30-day paid vacation.
I'll tell you something...

238
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,753
...with your education and background...

239
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,631
...you could easily land an assignment
in Europe.

240
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,217
Europe?

241
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:53,470
I do need to get away.

242
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,349
I promise, you'll be in the best
physical shape you've ever been in.

243
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:01,062
It will be like 3 years at La Costa.

244
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:03,982
La Costa. That's good!

245
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:10,029
What if I hate it once I get there?

246
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,323
Quit.

247
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:13,701
It's a job, like anything else.

248
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,210
I...

249
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:24,754
State your full name.

250
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,341
Do solemnly swear or affirm...

251
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,846
...I will support and defend...

252
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,683
...the Constitution
of the United States...

253
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:40,563
...from all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

254
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:44,901
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance...

255
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:47,528
...to the same...

256
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,657
...and will obey the orders...

257
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:54,537
...of the President
of the United States...

258
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:58,791
...and the orders of
the officers over me...

259
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,922
...according to regulations.

260
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,223
All right.

261
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:16,186
My name is Sergeant L.C. Ross.

262
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:20,523
And I'll be your drill sergeant
for your 6 weeks basic training.

263
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:23,861
My job is to turn you
lovely ladies and gentlemen...

264
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:26,197
...into United States soldiers.

265
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:30,284
The first thing we'll do is put you
through your in-processing.

266
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:35,332
While you are waiting in line for your
processing, you will not, I repeat...

267
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:39,086
...you will not be flapping your lips.

268
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:42,089
You'll be filling out these forms.

269
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:47,220
I'm going to call out your names
and I want you to line up behind me.

270
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,890
Abbott.

271
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,227
Barnett.

272
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:55,980
Benjamin.

273
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:58,357
Benjamin!

274
00:20:58,607 --> 00:20:59,858
- Sir.
- Fall in, Benjamin.

275
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:01,277
I'm Private Winter...

276
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:05,407
...but I think I can be of assistance
in locating Private Benjamin.

277
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:07,284
Sir.

278
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:21,257
- Are we at the fort?
- Yes we are.

279
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,634
Time to wake up now.

280
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:26,012
In a sec.

281
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,098
Get your ass up
and out on the company street!

282
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,229
I never!

283
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,691
Give me 10 pushups!
Knock them out!

284
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:39,068
You mind if I check into
my room first?

285
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,529
Assume the position and hit it!

286
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,947
Now!

287
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,086
Up! Down!

288
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,426
What is this, hell week?

289
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:02,719
No, Benjamin...

290
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:04,888
...this is the Army!

291
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:17,027
Excuse me, sir, is green
the only color these come in?

292
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:21,865
Close it up back there,
you meatheads. Go!

293
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,576
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Close it up!

294
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,997
Close up that field back there!
Come on, move it!

295
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,751
Where are the yachts?

296
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,721
- Excuse me, are you a reporter?
- Who, me?

297
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:44,389
No.

298
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:48,645
I joined up, but I'm not staying.
There's been a mistake.

299
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:50,981
I'll straighten it out
when the manager gets here.

300
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:54,317
Man on the floor! In front
of your cots at attention!

301
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,575
Barracks ready for inspection, Captain.

302
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:16,174
What's the matter, honey?
Are you a crybaby?

303
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:17,425
No, sir.

304
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:18,594
Ma'am!

305
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:25,560
I know how all you ladies
drool over this...

306
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,397
...this Fonzie character...

307
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:30,065
...but not in my outfit.

308
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:31,316
Burn it.

309
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:46,082
- Your name, soldier?
- Private Winter, ma'am.

310
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:01,308
Outstanding, Winter. Outstanding.

311
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,143
Ladies!

312
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:05,270
Examine Private Winter's locker.

313
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,688
Learn from it.

314
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,195
You keep this up and we'll talk
officer's candidate school.

315
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,572
Thank you, ma'am!

316
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:28,712
This brassiere isn't regulation, Ross.

317
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:30,840
And neither is this face.

318
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:34,219
And you look like a clown, soldier.
Clean up your act.

319
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:40,893
Gianelli's a 308, ma'am.

320
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:47,400
So it was the Army or jail?

321
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,822
After 6 weeks with me,
you're going to wish you chose Attica.

322
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,157
Don't push me, punk.

323
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,371
This is the most pathetic group
of trainees I have ever laid my eyes on.

324
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,293
My companies are the best-trained...

325
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,504
...the best-disciplined
soldiers on this base.

326
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,846
I hate to interrupt you,
but could I speak to you for a sec?

327
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,641
My Lord! Sergeant,
would you look at this!

328
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,727
I've seen it, ma'am.

329
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,231
What's your name, Princess?

330
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,566
Judy.

331
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,153
Judy Benjamin.

332
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:33,743
I think they sent me to the wrong...

333
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,870
...place.

334
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:41,375
You see, I did join the Army,
but I joined a different Army.

335
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:46,214
I joined the one with the condos
and the private rooms.

336
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:52,680
No, really! My recruiter,
Jim Ballard, told me that...

337
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,893
I don't care what your lousy recruiter
told you, Benjamin.

338
00:25:57,143 --> 00:25:59,312
I'm telling you, there is no other Army.

339
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:01,397
Wait a minute.

340
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:04,151
I don't want to have to
go to your boss, okay?

341
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:11,492
To be truthful with you, I can't
sleep in a room with 20 strangers.

342
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:12,827
Oh, dear!

343
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:15,872
Look at this place.
The Army couldn't afford drapes?

344
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:18,833
I'll be up at the crack of dawn here.

345
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:23,881
And I have to tell you,
I am frankly a little shocked.

346
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:26,133
You're shocked?

347
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:27,467
Why?

348
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:30,721
This place is a sty.

349
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:36,687
Look at these stains.
God knows where this has been.

350
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,399
And have you seen the bathroom?

351
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,325
Do you think that
the latrine is unsanitary?

352
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,536
It's disgusting!

353
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:55,249
There are urinals in there.

354
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,044
That's because this is the Army...

355
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:02,256
...it's not a sorority house.

356
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:08,972
May I see your toothbrush?
Please?

357
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:32,247
Yale, how could you do this to me?

358
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:54,938
You could eat off that floor.

359
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:56,941
Why don't you.

360
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,666
Reveille! Let's go!

361
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,584
Everybody up!

362
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:15,086
Move it!

363
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,631
Everybody up! Everybody move!

364
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,467
Everybody, Benjamin!

365
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:24,137
You can't mean me.
I worked the night shift.

366
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:26,849
Go check out the bathroom,
it's fabulous.

367
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,534
Alpha Company...

368
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:45,494
...attention!

369
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:48,748
Bravo Company, attention!

370
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,017
At ease, gentlemen...

371
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:07,436
...and ladies.

372
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,024
I'm your post commander.

373
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:14,401
Colonel Clay Thornbush.

374
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:15,736
Welcome...

375
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:19,198
...to the Biloxi, Mississippi
Basic Training Center.

376
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:21,326
The backbone of the U.S. Army.

377
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:24,704
You have two company commanders
to lead you through basic.

378
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,873
Capt. Doreen Lewis,
a 5-year veteran...

379
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,168
...here at Fort Biloxi,
of Alpha Company.

380
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:30,961
And a newcomer to the family...

381
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:33,964
...Captain William Wooldridge,
Bravo Company.

382
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:37,051
Here, we turn out
the best-fed, best-trained...

383
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:39,638
...soldiers, but it doesn't come easy.

384
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:43,308
It does not happen overnight.
You must have the strength...

385
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,520
...the self-discipline,
and mental stamina necessary...

386
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:50,691
...to meet the standards
of the United States Army.

387
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:53,027
The next 6 weeks will be the test.

388
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,237
It'll be hell...

389
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:59,034
...but you'll be glad you did it.

390
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,497
Move it!

391
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:06,875
Left, right! Left!

392
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:19,848
I thought it would be
a few leg lifts, a little stretching...

393
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,476
...maybe a disco class, you know.

394
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:25,437
You're not real talkative,
are you, Soyer?

395
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:27,439
We run them out...

396
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,358
...and we march them back.

397
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:34,781
Then about twice a week,
I spring a surprise inspection on them.

398
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,700
That's good Army.

399
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:39,786
Keeps them on their toes.

400
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:44,125
- Got one more question.
- Shoot.

401
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:46,751
Are you busy Friday?

402
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,854
Look out, Gianelli!

403
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,866
I can't take anymore.
They've broken me.

404
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,704
- I'm quitting.
- Girl, you can't quit this Army.

405
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:37,207
I can. The recruiter told me
quit anytime I want.

406
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:40,168
Jesus, you still believe
your recruiter?

407
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,295
It's only for 3 years.

408
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,757
Company halt!

409
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,723
Move it, Benjamin!

410
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:56,020
I don't want to see you stop running
unless you collapse, faint or puke!

411
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:11,745
I have never looked
worse in my life!

412
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:15,791
Has anybody ever died from basic?

413
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:51,955
Excuse me.

414
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:02,467
I think you took my blanket.

415
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,472
This is my blanket.
You gave it to me.

416
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:11,644
- I don't think I did.
- Maybe you just forgot.

417
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:13,688
Maybe you got brain damage.

418
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:18,485
Okay, I gave it to you.

419
00:34:18,735 --> 00:34:20,237
By mistake.

420
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:23,323
- I want it back, okay?
- Take it.

421
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,299
Where are you going?

422
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,345
Home.

423
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:30,773
We're going to have to
do this again real soon.

424
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:34,068
How about every Friday night?

425
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:38,698
I'm going to set you free, Doreen.

426
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:04,768
Captain Lewis, ma'am,
we've got trouble.

427
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:10,358
My hair!

428
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:21,995
Benjamin, you are not fit
to wear that uniform!

429
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,914
No shit!

430
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:31,214
What do you want from me?
I didn't ask her to punish everybody!

431
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:34,175
You think I like schlepping
in rain all day and night?

432
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,553
Just keep marching, Benjamin!

433
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:39,931
My name is Judy! J-U-D-Y...

434
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:42,810
...and I'd like somebody
to call me by my name.

435
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:44,812
Hey, Judy!

436
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:48,774
I took my life in my own hands.
I made a mistake.

437
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:52,404
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again!
I want to wear my sandals!

438
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:56,199
I want to go out to lunch.

439
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,326
I want to be normal again.

440
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:01,497
Would you please
just shut up, Benjamin!

441
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:05,209
God! Never in all my born days
met such a whiny...

442
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:07,420
...candy-ass as you!

443
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,965
I don't want to be in the Army!

444
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:17,890
But we do, okay?

445
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,559
We can't afford any more trouble
on account of you.

446
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,731
I thought you and I
could be friends, but you're...

447
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,776
- Forget it!
- What? I'm what?

448
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:31,822
You're the most
insensitive person I've ever met.

449
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:34,158
That is so untrue!

450
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:38,496
I never go to someone's
home empty-handed!

451
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,706
People love me!

452
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:41,957
Platoon, halt!

453
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:44,586
Fall out!

454
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,679
To the day room...

455
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,098
...on the double!

456
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,745
They didn't tell me it was you.

457
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,049
Hi, Mom.

458
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:37,227
Hi, Daddy.

459
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:45,820
Sit down, Judy.

460
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:48,906
I was...

461
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:52,493
...going to call, but I wasn't
feeling very good.

462
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:57,499
Eight days.

463
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,586
Our daughter disappears...

464
00:39:00,836 --> 00:39:03,589
...for eight days without a single word.

465
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:09,679
We thought you were kidnapped.
The FBI was looking for you...

466
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:11,973
...when some stranger calls...

467
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:16,228
...telling us how fine you are
and that you'd enlisted in the Army.

468
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,523
We tried to figure out why.

469
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,694
Personally, I think you've gone
temporarily insane.

470
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,531
That's what we told everyone.

471
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,576
We said that you had a collapse...

472
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,870
...and that you were in a mental home.

473
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,831
People think I'm in a mental home?

474
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,001
What should we say?

475
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:41,089
That you're in an Army barracks
in Mississippi with a bunch of...

476
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,716
- What?
- I don't know what!

477
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,262
That's why I don't like it.

478
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,726
How could you do this to your parents?

479
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:57,816
Haven't we done enough for you?
Given you everything you wanted?

480
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:02,570
Did I get you a car on your sixteenth
birthday? Did I get you into college?

481
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:06,325
Did I bail you out of your first
marriage to that schmuck? Did I?

482
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:07,575
Relax.

483
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,495
I am relaxed!

484
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,920
Why are you punishing us?

485
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:23,719
Maybe you hate us.

486
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,307
I don't hate you,
I love you.

487
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:33,312
You know your Aunt Kissy
is living with us now.

488
00:40:34,605 --> 00:40:35,605
Why?

489
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:38,527
Because you mother's had a
nervous breakdown, that's why!

490
00:40:43,532 --> 00:40:47,912
You were never a smart girl.
We're all going to stop pretending now.

491
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:54,753
You are obviously incapable
of making your own decisions.

492
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:59,133
Starting tomorrow,
I do not let you out of my sight.

493
00:40:59,383 --> 00:41:00,843
I don't care how much you cry.

494
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:03,345
The Benjamins!

495
00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:05,931
Captain Lewis.

496
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:12,689
It is so good to meet you in person.

497
00:41:13,398 --> 00:41:14,398
Thank you.

498
00:41:15,942 --> 00:41:18,279
Captain Lewis said we could
take you home, darling.

499
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:23,159
I'm sorry that things just
didn't work out here for Judy.

500
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,287
She's a hard worker.

501
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:28,791
She's very... popular...

502
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,335
...with all the other girls.

503
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:34,505
We are sad to see her go.

504
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:41,137
If you sign here on the dotted line,
you're as good as home, young lady.

505
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:43,556
Right there.

506
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:48,395
Here, darling. Here you are.

507
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:52,400
Come on, take it.

508
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:56,779
No, thanks.

509
00:41:58,155 --> 00:41:59,908
Think I'll stay.

510
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:14,047
Mom.

511
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,590
Daddy.

512
00:43:13,197 --> 00:43:14,573
All right, knock it off!

513
00:43:14,823 --> 00:43:16,325
Break it! Let's go!

514
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:50,821
Welcome to the Biloxi War Games,
the Super Bowl of Basic Training.

515
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:54,033
Simulated combat will test
your skills and courage.

516
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:57,703
Captain Wooldridge will lead
the red team. Captain Lewis...

517
00:43:57,954 --> 00:44:01,833
...the blue team. I will be observing
the exercises from the air.

518
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,795
Good luck.
And fight proud!

519
00:44:06,922 --> 00:44:08,173
Fight proud!

520
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:20,061
Thompson, Hike...

521
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:22,355
...Katz, Byron...

522
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:23,649
...Richter!

523
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,529
Your objective is to capture and blow
up Red Team's communication center.

524
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,740
Beware, mine-fields are out there.

525
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,742
Most of them are inert...

526
00:44:32,992 --> 00:44:34,244
...but some are ert.

527
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:36,121
Take off!

528
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:37,497
Private Winter!

529
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,586
You'll serve as Captain Lewis'
aide-de-camp.

530
00:44:43,795 --> 00:44:45,631
Sir. Yes, sir!

531
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:47,716
Team "C"!

532
00:44:48,134 --> 00:44:50,094
Gianelli, Glass...

533
00:44:50,344 --> 00:44:52,346
...Moe, Benjamin...

534
00:44:52,597 --> 00:44:53,765
...Soyer!

535
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:57,770
Your objective is to
guard this area here.

536
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,481
Excuse me, Drill Sergeant,
what is that area?

537
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:03,025
That's the swamp.

538
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,650
Swamp?

539
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,698
Take off!

540
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:28,428
If you can't read that map,
why don't you just say it?

541
00:45:28,678 --> 00:45:30,889
You're supposed
to be the point man!

542
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:33,141
Benj pointed me in the wrong direction!

543
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:36,896
- What am I, Magellan?
- What are we going to guard, algae?

544
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:40,691
Let's just go straight north.

545
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:43,069
- We came from the north!
- Let's go south.

546
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:44,737
Wait! Relax.

547
00:45:44,987 --> 00:45:46,949
If we can't get back by tomorrow...

548
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:48,826
...they'll send a search plane.

549
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:51,328
We have enough bodies
to spell "help"?

550
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:52,829
Let's go.

551
00:45:59,712 --> 00:46:02,674
The first time I ever did it...

552
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:14,019
...was on an overnight hike
with my Bible class.

553
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:20,694
We're talking Laemil Lefebvre,
my preacher's son.

554
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:30,955
I'd never done nothing
in my life before. Nothing!

555
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,791
And he just climbed right smack-dab...

556
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,836
...in the middle of my sleeping bag,
and I was scared.

557
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,050
Not to mention the fact
that his daddy, the preacher...

558
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:44,970
...was right over there,
just about ten feet away.

559
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,220
How was it?

560
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:48,725
Quiet...

561
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:52,270
...but very nice. Very nice!

562
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,817
I had an orgasm once.

563
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,573
But I was alone.

564
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,953
I guess you must have been alone.

565
00:47:15,337 --> 00:47:16,880
Once...

566
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:22,178
...when I was with my first husband,
I got to this place...

567
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,431
...that was kind of nice and tingly.

568
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:32,940
I don't know if it was official.

569
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,026
I mean, I don't know
if this was an official...

570
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:38,278
...orgasm, you know.

571
00:47:40,865 --> 00:47:44,953
But I counted it as one for five years.

572
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:50,042
How many times
have you been married?

573
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:54,505
Twice.

574
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:00,011
The first time for six weeks...

575
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,097
...and the second time...

576
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:03,723
...for six hours.

577
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:04,974
Six hours?

578
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,894
My husband had a heart attack and died.

579
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:09,145
What?!

580
00:48:11,107 --> 00:48:13,609
My husband had a heart attack...

581
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,029
...and died on our wedding night.

582
00:48:18,698 --> 00:48:20,743
While we were making love.

583
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,454
Holy shit!

584
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:25,664
Jesus, Benjamin!

585
00:48:25,998 --> 00:48:28,751
I don't get it. What do you do
after a thing like that?

586
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:34,841
Join the Army.

587
00:48:57,032 --> 00:49:00,994
We're lost. We've passed
that same alligator 7 times.

588
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:03,039
I bet the war games are over by now.

589
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:06,459
- Lewis is going to just kill us!
- There's a plane!

590
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:09,295
I bet that's headed back to base.
Let's follow it.

591
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:12,091
I hope it's not Delta to Miami.

592
00:49:13,258 --> 00:49:15,886
Look, it's the Red Army headquarters.

593
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,099
Quiet!

594
00:49:26,314 --> 00:49:27,398
Great.

595
00:49:27,774 --> 00:49:31,277
- You owe me $6.95.
- You got it!

596
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:47,045
Hey, blood, how you doing?
All right, looking good!

597
00:49:47,295 --> 00:49:50,006
- What's happening, girl?
- What can I tell you?

598
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:53,094
You're my prisoner of war,
that's what's happening!

599
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:57,181
- I ain't your nothing. Get that...
- I mean what I say!

600
00:50:00,768 --> 00:50:01,936
Drop it!

601
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:06,232
No, you drop it.

602
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:09,319
I said, drop it!

603
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:15,160
- Where's Captain Wooldridge?
- In the tent interrogating a P.O.W.

604
00:50:16,035 --> 00:50:17,454
Get the keys to the truck.

605
00:50:17,996 --> 00:50:19,164
Come on.

606
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,253
- Oh, shit!
- Don't worry.

607
00:50:24,503 --> 00:50:26,672
- I'll hot-wire it.
- You know how?

608
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:28,758
That's my former career.

609
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:30,134
Excellent!

610
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:49,071
What?

611
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:52,532
Freeze!

612
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:55,162
Private Winter!

613
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:58,832
Well, lookee here!

614
00:50:59,082 --> 00:51:02,711
- Look what we got.
- Listen, Captain Lewis...

615
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,799
She sent me out to find you guys and...

616
00:51:07,092 --> 00:51:08,384
...I got captured.

617
00:51:09,677 --> 00:51:12,305
He promised me he'd put in
a good word with Captain Lewis.

618
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:14,224
And I really don't like him.

619
00:51:14,974 --> 00:51:16,727
Take the prisoners.

620
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:21,023
Attention all Red Team personnel.

621
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:24,401
The Blue Team has surrendered.
The Red Team has won.

622
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:26,196
So follow us.

623
00:51:27,114 --> 00:51:29,324
Attention all Red Team personnel.

624
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:31,326
The Blue Team has surrendered.

625
00:51:31,576 --> 00:51:34,121
The Red Team has won, so follow us.

626
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:41,879
Red Team captured!

627
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:45,049
Ross, take the platoon...

628
00:51:46,217 --> 00:51:47,344
...head due west.

629
00:51:49,012 --> 00:51:52,558
I'll lead the remaining troops
to the east.

630
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:01,734
What now?

631
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,361
Got any ideas?

632
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:12,455
Off your asses!
On your feet!

633
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,880
Overwhelming enemy forces approaching.

634
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:25,302
Blue Team Company Commander
requests permission to surrender, sir.

635
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:27,805
Do you accept
surrender of Blue Team?

636
00:52:28,055 --> 00:52:31,476
No, sir. We do not, because
we are also the Blue Team, sir.

637
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:33,269
Identify yourself, soldier!

638
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:35,938
Sir, Private Benjamin, sir!

639
00:52:49,454 --> 00:52:50,789
At ease!

640
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,957
Which one of you is Private Benjamin?

641
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:54,375
Sir, I am, sir.

642
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:58,464
- Outstanding!
- Thank you, sir!

643
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:01,759
Here's the rest of the squad.
Privates Glass, Gianelli...

644
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:04,345
...Private Moe and Private Soyer, sir.

645
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:07,681
Where is the Red Team Commander?

646
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,803
Captain Lewis, you are lucky
to have troopers like this!

647
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:43,471
Congratulations!

648
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:47,016
Next time don't be so quick
to raise the white flag.

649
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:50,187
- Yes, sir.
- The war games are concluded.

650
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:53,691
Troops are dismissed.
I will see you tomorrow at graduation.

651
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:02,784
- Yes, sir!
- Can I offer your team a lift?

652
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:23,891
Meet two of our Thornbirds!
Lieutenant Gomez and Sergeant Gates.

653
00:54:26,685 --> 00:54:29,605
Fabulous uniforms!
What's a Thornbird, sir?

654
00:54:29,855 --> 00:54:34,444
An elite airborne corp. We recruit
them from the best bases in the country.

655
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:37,822
I'm damn proud of them,
like I'm proud of you girls.

656
00:54:38,072 --> 00:54:40,200
It's a hell of a job you did today!

657
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:43,037
Where do you hail from?

658
00:54:44,246 --> 00:54:45,956
Philadelphia, sir.

659
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:51,337
It's the seat of our democracy!
Thornie Two is from Philadelphia.

660
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:52,798
Thornie Two, sir?

661
00:54:53,215 --> 00:54:54,466
My wife.

662
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,470
After 20 years watching us crazy guys
jump out of airplanes...

663
00:54:58,845 --> 00:55:01,640
...she decided she wanted to try it.
Remember, Ed?

664
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,894
We took her up,
almost had to shove her out!

665
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:07,480
She had a good time,
but she landed wrong.

666
00:55:07,855 --> 00:55:11,692
Broke her arm in 3 places. Lucky
we didn't have to shoot her, right?

667
00:55:13,112 --> 00:55:14,446
We're approaching, sir.

668
00:55:14,822 --> 00:55:17,282
I'll take her down.
You trust me, don't you?

669
00:55:17,533 --> 00:55:18,617
Oh, yes, sir!

670
00:55:18,992 --> 00:55:21,662
Then let's do it to it!

671
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:26,459
- Tell your men to hang on, Benjamin!
- Hang on, men.

672
00:56:35,494 --> 00:56:37,579
Whoop-de-do!

673
00:56:40,207 --> 00:56:43,293
Inspection, ladies!

674
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:58,477
Lady Luck!

675
00:57:03,398 --> 00:57:06,194
Don't you look at me
with those baby blues.

676
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:10,740
I'm not the great Thornie.

677
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:18,374
You finally succeeded in making
a fool out of me, didn't you?

678
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:21,544
Ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

679
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:25,631
I've got a reward for you,
my little hero.

680
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:30,595
You're all going to scour
every inch of this rat's nest!

681
00:57:31,429 --> 00:57:33,265
Inside and out.

682
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:38,479
I mean the bed frames,
the window ledges...

683
00:57:38,729 --> 00:57:40,815
...the linoleum...

684
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,402
...the toilet seats.

685
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:48,240
You understand me?

686
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,784
Ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

687
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:52,911
I can't hear you.

688
00:57:55,164 --> 00:57:57,459
I can't hear you!

689
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:07,511
Thank you.

690
00:58:11,432 --> 00:58:14,351
It breaks my little old heart...

691
00:58:14,602 --> 00:58:16,896
...to have to bust up
our winning team...

692
00:58:17,146 --> 00:58:20,150
...but I have been assigned
to a new post.

693
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,068
A good post!

694
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,323
Let's not keep in touch, shall we!

695
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:11,164
Busted up, the whole team.

696
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,916
Busted up.

697
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:17,045
I have been assigned to a new post.

698
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:25,221
Come on.

699
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:05,557
Good post!

700
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,301
That was nice.

701
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,722
Keep in touch, shall we?

702
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:04,730
At ease!

703
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:10,694
Didn't think you'd make it, did you?

704
01:02:12,988 --> 01:02:15,909
You will no longer
be known as trainees.

705
01:02:18,328 --> 01:02:20,788
You have earned the right
to call yourselves...

706
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,292
...United States soldiers,
and I'm proud of each of you.

707
01:02:26,962 --> 01:02:28,672
On Monday you will receive...

708
01:02:28,923 --> 01:02:31,926
...your advanced individual
training assignments.

709
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:33,677
Each of you...

710
01:02:40,685 --> 01:02:41,770
...will be given...

711
01:02:42,312 --> 01:02:44,940
...a special responsibility
which will play...

712
01:02:45,191 --> 01:02:48,277
...a key role in the
defense of the free world.

713
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:50,863
My heartfelt congratulations
and best wishes.

714
01:02:53,324 --> 01:02:54,992
I almost forgot.

715
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:59,790
Dismissed till 0800 Monday morning.
Have a good one!

716
01:03:28,446 --> 01:03:29,446
Evening, ladies.

717
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:31,116
We're not interested.

718
01:03:31,366 --> 01:03:33,201
Sorry.

719
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:36,538
All right, I'm uptight, okay?

720
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:40,209
Get yourself a drink,
we're going to cruise.

721
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:12,328
Judy Benjamin, this is Johnny Rourke.

722
01:04:12,578 --> 01:04:14,955
And Kim... I forget your last name.

723
01:04:15,206 --> 01:04:16,332
Osaka.

724
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,462
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

725
01:04:23,507 --> 01:04:25,759
What's happening, Judy?

726
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:29,764
Bourbon, no ice.

727
01:04:31,933 --> 01:04:34,185
I'm with Olivetti of Tokyo.

728
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:36,896
Johnny is my southeastern
U.S. Sales manager.

729
01:04:37,146 --> 01:04:39,942
He always shows me a hip time.

730
01:04:44,112 --> 01:04:45,781
What time is it?

731
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,161
I just took your picture, mama!

732
01:04:52,372 --> 01:04:54,374
Very hip.

733
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:57,585
Look, I've got to go back to the base.

734
01:04:57,836 --> 01:05:00,297
Where's the fire? Come on.

735
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,759
This could be a big night for you.

736
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:07,054
Sincerely.

737
01:05:09,307 --> 01:05:10,976
Liz?

738
01:05:11,476 --> 01:05:12,894
- How are you?
- God, I'm fine.

739
01:05:13,144 --> 01:05:15,438
I can't believe this!

740
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:19,944
Listen, thanks,
but I don't need the loan.

741
01:05:20,194 --> 01:05:21,904
What are you doing in New Orleans?

742
01:05:22,154 --> 01:05:24,782
My dad's here on a medical
conference and we all came.

743
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:26,659
Come and see them, they'll die!

744
01:05:26,909 --> 01:05:29,412
Wait a minute.
Who is that with your parents?

745
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,960
A French gynecologist. He and Dad
spoke on the Lamaze panel together.

746
01:05:35,419 --> 01:05:37,462
- Isn't he totally gorgeous?
- Totally.

747
01:05:37,713 --> 01:05:40,007
If it weren't for Jeffrey,
I'd go for him myself.

748
01:05:40,258 --> 01:05:42,177
Look who I found!

749
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,972
My God, how are you, darling?

750
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:50,101
Kid, you look wonderful!
Please give me a hug.

751
01:05:54,023 --> 01:05:55,399
Sit down.

752
01:05:58,277 --> 01:06:00,654
- Henri Tremont.
- Benjamin, Judy.

753
01:06:00,906 --> 01:06:03,658
Will you look at this?
GI Judy!

754
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,869
We'll call your parents.

755
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:08,079
They'll be so thrilled we saw you.

756
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,832
Your mother's coming along very nicely.

757
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:13,002
She gained back some of the weight.

758
01:06:14,545 --> 01:06:15,588
Champagne?

759
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,173
I'd love some, thank you.

760
01:06:17,423 --> 01:06:18,799
Since Yale's fu...

761
01:06:20,218 --> 01:06:24,014
By the way, I can't get over you
in this Army outfit.

762
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:26,975
She didn't swim because
she didn't want her hair wet.

763
01:06:27,226 --> 01:06:28,435
This is true.

764
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:30,062
What it's like to be a WAC?

765
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,941
- I'm not a WAC.
- How often do you talk to your folks?

766
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:35,944
Tell Henri how long
we've known your parents.

767
01:06:36,236 --> 01:06:38,863
Shall I make a long story short?

768
01:06:39,697 --> 01:06:41,407
Leo and I and Judy's parents...

769
01:06:41,658 --> 01:06:45,871
...double-dated in Atlantic City,
before even any one of us was married.

770
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:49,375
It wasn't Atlantic City.
It was Asbury Park, but it's all right.

771
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:53,046
I've never been to
Asbury Park in my life.

772
01:06:55,966 --> 01:06:57,092
Would you like to dance?

773
01:06:57,592 --> 01:06:59,302
I'd love to dance.

774
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:14,862
The Lemishes are terrific people...

775
01:07:15,112 --> 01:07:18,657
...but 4 hours of making long stories
short was driving me crazy.

776
01:07:18,907 --> 01:07:21,743
4 hours? Try 28 years.

777
01:07:25,707 --> 01:07:28,501
I've never danced with a soldier before.

778
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:31,629
I've never danced as a soldier before.

779
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,844
- I kind of like it.
- So do I.

780
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,811
Do you have a boyfriend in this Army?

781
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,313
No.

782
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,358
Don't you get lonely?

783
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:55,156
- How'd you get to speak English so well?
- Baltimore.

784
01:07:55,406 --> 01:07:58,451
- Maryland?
- I went to med school at Johns Hopkins.

785
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:20,975
I just can't believe
that you're in this Army.

786
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:26,106
If I knew you better,
I'd show you my dog tags.

787
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:28,984
How much better?

788
01:08:49,257 --> 01:08:51,217
Let's go to my room.

789
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:58,851
I'm really attracted to you.

790
01:08:59,852 --> 01:09:04,273
But I'm not ready to make love to a
man I just met an hour and a half ago.

791
01:09:05,148 --> 01:09:06,860
I'm sorry.

792
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:09,404
That's just the way I am.

793
01:09:11,155 --> 01:09:15,785
Usually, by the time I kiss a guy, I
already know his mother's maiden name.

794
01:09:18,497 --> 01:09:20,249
I wish I knew you better.

795
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,585
I'm thirty-four...

796
01:09:22,877 --> 01:09:25,921
...and I live alone in Neuilly,
on the outskirts of Paris.

797
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:29,801
I'm the only child...

798
01:09:30,302 --> 01:09:32,637
...and my father is also a doctor.

799
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:35,223
What else?

800
01:09:36,433 --> 01:09:38,936
When I'm not working I play soccer.

801
01:09:40,646 --> 01:09:42,648
Let's see...

802
01:09:43,816 --> 01:09:45,401
I'm Jewish.

803
01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:12,514
Now I know what I've been
faking all these years.

804
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,985
That was your first?

805
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:27,614
And second.

806
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,713
Where are you going?

807
01:10:41,964 --> 01:10:45,175
- Just to get a sip of champagne.
- I want to go with you.

808
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,652
I'm sorry.

809
01:11:05,865 --> 01:11:07,157
No I'm not.

810
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:11,913
What?

811
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:15,041
Private Benjamin.

812
01:11:18,044 --> 01:11:20,506
Meeting you tonight was...

813
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:26,012
It was just what I needed.

814
01:11:36,064 --> 01:11:38,191
What you needed?

815
01:11:46,409 --> 01:11:48,161
If you're ever in Paris...

816
01:11:49,329 --> 01:11:51,123
If you're ever in Biloxi.

817
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:57,588
It was nice meeting you.

818
01:12:18,444 --> 01:12:19,570
What did you get?

819
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,784
- MP School.
- You can put your violence to good use.

820
01:12:24,076 --> 01:12:26,328
- Smoke and flame specialist.
- What's that?

821
01:12:26,578 --> 01:12:27,578
A fireman.

822
01:12:27,788 --> 01:12:30,374
I got transferred to
Fort Ord, California.

823
01:12:30,624 --> 01:12:33,419
You got the yachts, honey!
You got the yachts!

824
01:12:34,003 --> 01:12:36,214
- What?
- OCS.

825
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:38,132
Can you believe it?!

826
01:12:38,383 --> 01:12:43,180
- Honey, you're going to be an officer.
- There goes a beautiful friendship.

827
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,430
What did you get?

828
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,934
I don't know. I'm petrified.

829
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:48,811
Excuse me!

830
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:51,105
- Where's Benjamin?
- Right there.

831
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,108
Thornbirds?

832
01:12:54,067 --> 01:12:55,318
Me?

833
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:57,487
They don't have women Thornbirds.

834
01:12:57,737 --> 01:12:59,155
They do now.

835
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:08,165
I was a skinny fighting lad
No more than seventeen

836
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:12,503
The sorriest excuse for a man
That you have ever seen

837
01:13:12,753 --> 01:13:16,425
But now I am a Thornbird
And as proud as I can be

838
01:13:16,675 --> 01:13:20,721
Colonel Thornbush
Made a man out of me

839
01:13:25,643 --> 01:13:29,606
Glory, glory
I'll be falling through the sky

840
01:13:29,856 --> 01:13:33,735
Glory, glory
I am not afraid to die

841
01:13:33,986 --> 01:13:37,448
Glory, glory
I'm as proud as I can be

842
01:13:37,698 --> 01:13:41,785
Colonel Thornbush
Made a man out of me

843
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,223
Good morning, sir.

844
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:40,058
I'd like you to meet my wife.

845
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:44,813
- Good to meet you, Mrs. Thornbush.
- Good to meet you, Miss Lady Thornbird.

846
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,984
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

847
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,278
I guess this is the Thorndog.

848
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,862
Shake, Scrabble!

849
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:57,411
You must be nervous
about the big jump tomorrow.

850
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:00,163
The Colonel says I can do it.
I guess I can.

851
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:03,000
The Colonel's motto is,
"Life is a series...

852
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:06,754
...of challenges to be
met and mastered."

853
01:15:07,046 --> 01:15:11,175
I hope you catch a cloud, Benjamin.
Not a feeling like it in the world.

854
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:15,346
You're in a veil of white,
not a sound except your beating heart.

855
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,808
It's godlike.

856
01:15:23,063 --> 01:15:26,150
You must be very special.

857
01:15:26,483 --> 01:15:28,612
The "Big T" is a
great judge of character.

858
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,739
Stop gabbing and let this soldier...

859
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:31,990
...get some chow.

860
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,658
Goodbye, sir.

861
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:39,290
I really appreciate
your confidence in me.

862
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,417
I'm not going to let you down.

863
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:45,421
See you at 13,000 feet, okay?

864
01:15:52,846 --> 01:15:54,765
Oy vey!

865
01:16:06,653 --> 01:16:08,656
Go with it!
Soar! You're a Thornbird!

866
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:13,202
Come on, Benjamin,
let's go! All right?

867
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,627
- You can do it! Trust me!
- I can't!

868
01:16:21,795 --> 01:16:24,005
I'm ashamed, but I'm afraid to die.

869
01:16:24,256 --> 01:16:27,550
- I'm afraid, Colonel. I'm not brave.
- Take it easy!

870
01:16:27,801 --> 01:16:29,095
I can't. I'm afraid...

871
01:16:29,345 --> 01:16:31,180
...my chute won't open.

872
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,933
- Calm down, Benjamin!
- What if I fall upside down?

873
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:37,520
- I could vomit in midair!
- Take it easy!

874
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:41,692
I tried to be macho, but those guys
are better at being men than I am!

875
01:16:41,984 --> 01:16:43,986
Relax, Benjamin,
you don't have to jump!

876
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,238
- I don't?
- No!

877
01:16:46,488 --> 01:16:48,657
Take it easy, girl! Shape up!

878
01:16:49,409 --> 01:16:50,743
You better?

879
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:53,037
I feel better now.

880
01:16:53,288 --> 01:16:55,915
You don't have to jump.

881
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:58,293
You're a good man.

882
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:00,212
There are other ways you can serve.

883
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:07,719
Happy, darling?

884
01:17:08,387 --> 01:17:10,473
- You want it!
- What are you doing?

885
01:17:10,724 --> 01:17:13,226
I can smell fear in any man
and passion in any woman!

886
01:17:13,476 --> 01:17:14,519
You want it!

887
01:17:16,438 --> 01:17:19,232
My God, this isn't happening to me!

888
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:21,611
I'm going to take you.

889
01:17:21,944 --> 01:17:24,655
I'm not in the mood.
Suddenly I feel nauseous.

890
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,574
Come to papa.

891
01:17:27,325 --> 01:17:30,453
I don't think so, sir,
but thanks anyway.

892
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:36,793
My God! Open, please!

893
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,638
At ease.

894
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,310
I'm glad you're back in one piece.

895
01:17:52,853 --> 01:17:57,274
I apologize for yesterday's indiscretion.
An unforgivable breach of discipline.

896
01:17:57,983 --> 01:17:59,568
And taste, sir.

897
01:18:02,614 --> 01:18:04,991
I hope it hasn't soured you
on the military.

898
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:08,119
The question is how long
you'll continue as a Thornbird.

899
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:10,330
Hopefully not too long, sir.

900
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:13,668
Understood.

901
01:18:13,918 --> 01:18:17,797
That's why I've put you on special
assignment, transferred to another post.

902
01:18:18,965 --> 01:18:21,259
A special assignment
on the ground, I hope.

903
01:18:22,135 --> 01:18:24,096
- A job in procurement.
- Procurement?

904
01:18:24,346 --> 01:18:27,432
That's purchasing. I've cut
your orders, you leave at 1500.

905
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:30,686
Greenland?

906
01:18:30,936 --> 01:18:32,897
What, penguins? Forget it!

907
01:18:33,648 --> 01:18:34,774
Forget it!

908
01:18:35,942 --> 01:18:38,987
I was in the first wave of the Rangers
at Normandy on D-day.

909
01:18:39,237 --> 01:18:43,742
In 1952 I was standing with my troops
on the banks of the Yalu River, waiting.

910
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:46,287
MacArthur phoned.
"Come home, Thornie...

911
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,914
...it's not our year."
I am a good leader.

912
01:18:49,164 --> 01:18:51,166
No, I am a great leader!

913
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:54,004
Your ass is going to
Greenland for a reason.

914
01:18:54,254 --> 01:18:58,967
I won't let you shoot your mouth off,
blemishing my record with innuendo.

915
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,052
Innuendo? Try rape.

916
01:19:04,056 --> 01:19:05,056
How about Guam?

917
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:07,435
My hair will frizz.

918
01:19:08,769 --> 01:19:09,769
Okinawa?

919
01:19:10,062 --> 01:19:13,107
Malaria? Pass.

920
01:19:13,775 --> 01:19:16,153
We have bases all over the world.

921
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:49,981
Dear Glass, hello from Belgium.

922
01:19:50,231 --> 01:19:53,944
Sorry it's taken me so long to write,
but I've been very busy.

923
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:56,030
S.H.A.P.E. Is an amazing place.

924
01:19:56,322 --> 01:19:59,158
The top military headquarters
in Europe.

925
01:19:59,408 --> 01:20:02,453
Definitely the most exciting duty
a soldier could pull.

926
01:20:02,703 --> 01:20:05,082
My M. O. S. Is Purchasing Specialist...

927
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:08,168
...the one job I've
trained for all my life.

928
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:10,754
My superior is a terrific guy...

929
01:20:11,546 --> 01:20:14,341
...a Turkish officer
named Lieutenant Rahmi.

930
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:18,721
But the best one can say of his English
is that it's better than my Turkish.

931
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,307
Benyameen, ka'.

932
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:23,768
Sate.

933
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:29,275
Benyameen, I need the inpoormation
on the drying caruses.

934
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:30,693
Driving courses?

935
01:20:30,943 --> 01:20:33,153
Yes, sir. I'm working on that now.

936
01:20:33,404 --> 01:20:37,325
Excellent. I want you
to rye-eed it to the counsule.

937
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,078
Me? Read it to the council?

938
01:20:40,537 --> 01:20:42,581
Do want me to rye-eed it?

939
01:20:46,377 --> 01:20:48,421
Private Benyameen... Benjamin!

940
01:20:48,671 --> 01:20:51,841
I got a charming apartment
through an ad in Stars and Stripes.

941
01:20:52,091 --> 01:20:55,553
It's right over a bakery,
has a hot plate, running water...

942
01:20:55,803 --> 01:20:57,764
...and all the croissants I can eat.

943
01:20:58,015 --> 01:21:00,767
It's not exactly Versailles,
but it's home.

944
01:21:01,018 --> 01:21:05,147
For the first time in months, I feel
that things are really going my way.

945
01:21:20,748 --> 01:21:23,584
I finally got the nerve
to pay Henri a surprise visit.

946
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:27,714
I'll let you know how it turns out.
I hope he remembers me.

947
01:21:27,964 --> 01:21:32,344
My love to Moe and Gianelli.
Votre amie, Private B.

948
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:36,139
Let's see... just got into town.

949
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:41,604
And feeling kind of lonely.
No, don't say lonely.

950
01:21:41,854 --> 01:21:43,064
Oh, God!

951
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:13,305
It's a great house, but don't be
impressed. It's a hand-me-down.

952
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:34,078
- Morning.
- Nine o'clock?

953
01:22:34,328 --> 01:22:37,123
I haven't slept this late in 3 months.

954
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,923
- Where are you going?
- Sunday soccer.

955
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:47,593
Merde! I'm late.

956
01:22:47,884 --> 01:22:49,762
I have to go anyway.

957
01:22:50,054 --> 01:22:51,764
Don't be ridiculous, please!

958
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:55,351
Stay. I want you to be here when
I get back at three o'clock.

959
01:22:55,602 --> 01:23:00,065
I'm going to make love to you,
and I'll take you to my favorite bistro.

960
01:23:00,858 --> 01:23:03,527
And we'll listen to
some nice Italian jazz.

961
01:23:04,903 --> 01:23:05,903
Max!

962
01:23:16,249 --> 01:23:18,335
Hello, baby!

963
01:23:20,671 --> 01:23:22,340
He's beautiful.

964
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:23,633
Sit!

965
01:23:28,596 --> 01:23:30,306
The dog is deaf.

966
01:23:36,897 --> 01:23:39,191
Wait for me, please.

967
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:46,282
I could get used to you.

968
01:24:08,974 --> 01:24:11,851
I paid 8,000 francs for this rug.

969
01:24:12,895 --> 01:24:17,275
I'm sorry. He gets nervous
around new people.

970
01:24:17,525 --> 01:24:19,360
He's not the only one.

971
01:24:23,782 --> 01:24:26,868
- I have to clean this up.
- You go play. I'll clean up.

972
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:29,621
No, I'll clean it.
Go play.

973
01:24:41,759 --> 01:24:43,053
I adore you.

974
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:55,317
There are two bids we recommend:
Sergio Devoto's Driving Academy...

975
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:58,361
...which teaches evasive driving
to the chauffeurs...

976
01:24:58,612 --> 01:25:01,948
...of such dignitaries as
General Alexander Haig...

977
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:05,911
...President Giscard d'Estaing,
Mick Jagger...

978
01:25:06,203 --> 01:25:08,539
Excuse me, Private Benjamin...

979
01:25:08,789 --> 01:25:11,917
...I'm afraid I missed
the security data on these drivers.

980
01:25:12,168 --> 01:25:14,755
The security data was
unavailable to me, sir.

981
01:25:15,422 --> 01:25:17,883
Who's here from security?

982
01:25:19,718 --> 01:25:20,718
I am, sir.

983
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:27,060
That material is highly classified, sir.

984
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:30,772
I am certain this soldier
is not cleared for that level.

985
01:25:31,022 --> 01:25:33,107
Then clear her, Captain.

986
01:25:34,777 --> 01:25:35,777
Is there a problem?

987
01:25:38,906 --> 01:25:39,906
No, sir.

988
01:25:40,074 --> 01:25:43,243
Then we'll expect a revised report
by the next council session.

989
01:25:43,494 --> 01:25:44,536
Gentlemen...

990
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:45,914
...chow time.

991
01:25:50,377 --> 01:25:51,419
Good job.

992
01:26:11,275 --> 01:26:13,068
Behave yourself, Judy Benjamin...

993
01:26:13,318 --> 01:26:17,991
...or I'll drum your ass out of S.H.A.P.E.
So fast it'll make your head spin.

994
01:26:25,498 --> 01:26:27,126
Sorry, Helga.

995
01:26:27,418 --> 01:26:29,336
Who is your friend, Doreen?

996
01:26:29,586 --> 01:26:31,922
She's no fwiend... friend.

997
01:26:32,715 --> 01:26:34,925
Listen, the bags are packed.

998
01:26:40,223 --> 01:26:42,350
My ex-girlfriend, Claire, painted it.

999
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,396
- What's it supposed to be, death?
- No, it's a self-portrait.

1000
01:26:47,273 --> 01:26:49,358
How long ago did you and this...

1001
01:26:50,234 --> 01:26:52,028
...painter break up?

1002
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:57,075
- 14 weeks ago, Monday.
- You're still counting it in weeks?

1003
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:02,831
How come you broke up?
Or is that too personal?

1004
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:06,168
Claire is a brilliant woman.

1005
01:27:06,418 --> 01:27:10,757
I even joined the Communist Party
for her for a week.

1006
01:27:11,424 --> 01:27:15,219
Not romantic though,
much too independent.

1007
01:27:19,058 --> 01:27:21,268
Do you know a lot of tortured artists?

1008
01:27:21,852 --> 01:27:24,146
Only tortured lawyers.

1009
01:27:25,564 --> 01:27:27,901
Your first husband was a lawyer?

1010
01:27:28,151 --> 01:27:31,571
No, Rick was a tennis pro
at the El San Juan.

1011
01:27:32,072 --> 01:27:35,909
My therapist said that I had
a neurotic need to find a father figure.

1012
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:40,081
And he had a neurotic need to find
a father-in-law who had a lot of money.

1013
01:27:49,716 --> 01:27:54,596
You know, I've been married to men
I haven't felt this comfortable with.

1014
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:11,848
What's the story with you
and this Tremont character?

1015
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:14,517
Why are you spying on me?

1016
01:29:27,782 --> 01:29:31,536
- Your lover-boy's a Red!
- Don't be ridiculous!

1017
01:29:31,787 --> 01:29:34,748
He was a Red for about five seconds.

1018
01:29:34,998 --> 01:29:36,875
Because of a woman he used to date.

1019
01:29:37,334 --> 01:29:41,380
Nobody stops being a Communist.
It's a terminal disease.

1020
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:45,426
And I am not going to sit around
with my thumb up my ass...

1021
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:48,179
...while you divulge
classified information...

1022
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:50,682
...during the throes of passion.

1023
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:54,186
Please! I can barely speak
during the throes of passion.

1024
01:29:54,603 --> 01:29:57,940
Believe me, Henri Tremont is
as much a Communist as me.

1025
01:29:58,315 --> 01:29:59,441
Or you!

1026
01:30:01,026 --> 01:30:04,322
If Patton were alive,
he would slap your face.

1027
01:30:07,701 --> 01:30:08,952
As you were.

1028
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:14,917
Captain Lewis.

1029
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:20,715
Private Benjamin has made herself
vulnerable to a Red, sir.

1030
01:30:20,965 --> 01:30:22,174
I read the report.

1031
01:30:22,425 --> 01:30:23,427
It's not true, sir.

1032
01:30:23,677 --> 01:30:28,140
We're not blind to the fact
that half of Europe is Communistic.

1033
01:30:29,308 --> 01:30:31,643
But here at S.H.A.P.E.
They're still the enemy.

1034
01:30:32,352 --> 01:30:33,980
General Foley, Henri Tremont...

1035
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:37,650
...is not a Communist.
He's a gynecologist.

1036
01:30:38,693 --> 01:30:41,029
Captain Lewis is hung up
on a technicality.

1037
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:45,659
I'm sorry, but it's against regulations
for you to associate with this man.

1038
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:49,038
You're up for a promotion.

1039
01:30:49,288 --> 01:30:52,583
I'd hate to see this incident
jeopardize your career.

1040
01:30:53,793 --> 01:30:55,837
What are you trying to tell me, sir?

1041
01:30:57,464 --> 01:30:59,174
It's either him...

1042
01:30:59,466 --> 01:31:00,508
...or us.

1043
01:31:25,828 --> 01:31:27,955
- Can't you hear?
- Can't you move?

1044
01:31:34,462 --> 01:31:35,923
It's Judy.

1045
01:31:36,173 --> 01:31:37,174
Judy who?

1046
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:40,386
Darling, how are you?

1047
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:42,720
What?

1048
01:31:49,145 --> 01:31:50,772
She's getting married.

1049
01:32:06,957 --> 01:32:10,252
Monsieur Shiffman!
Thank God!

1050
01:32:15,716 --> 01:32:18,302
Listen, the tablecloths...

1051
01:32:22,682 --> 01:32:26,729
...they're terrible.
The color, la couleur, is all wrong.

1052
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:33,360
The wedding is in yellow...

1053
01:32:33,944 --> 01:32:36,238
...and butterscotch.

1054
01:32:37,365 --> 01:32:40,327
And right now I'm looking at
something entre...

1055
01:32:40,577 --> 01:32:43,288
...canari et banane.

1056
01:32:43,705 --> 01:32:44,705
Gabby!

1057
01:32:47,043 --> 01:32:48,252
Pardon, Madame!

1058
01:32:49,337 --> 01:32:51,881
I get the Hoover.

1059
01:32:57,053 --> 01:32:59,765
Was she a good maid
before she met me?

1060
01:33:01,808 --> 01:33:04,853
Is it smart to fire the maid
just before the wedding?

1061
01:33:05,312 --> 01:33:07,440
Especially with your parents coming.

1062
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:11,319
Okay, she stays until after the wedding.

1063
01:33:13,696 --> 01:33:15,740
You look very beautiful today.

1064
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:18,202
So do you.

1065
01:33:18,952 --> 01:33:21,205
What did your friends say
when they called?

1066
01:33:21,455 --> 01:33:24,291
They're coming over on
Army Transport next week.

1067
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:27,461
I can't wait to see them.
It's going to be so much fun.

1068
01:33:27,711 --> 01:33:30,090
And Glass is learning French!

1069
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:41,268
Honey, who was that?

1070
01:33:42,937 --> 01:33:44,855
It was Claire.

1071
01:33:48,567 --> 01:33:49,861
Claire?

1072
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:04,669
Get over this obsession with Claire.

1073
01:34:05,003 --> 01:34:07,130
You stood with your tongue hanging out.

1074
01:34:07,463 --> 01:34:09,258
I was surprised to see her.

1075
01:34:09,508 --> 01:34:12,720
Surprised?
I'd call it catatonic.

1076
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:16,724
You don't see me getting hung up on your
old boyfriends and husbands.

1077
01:34:16,974 --> 01:34:18,392
Do you?

1078
01:34:20,228 --> 01:34:21,688
Listen to me.

1079
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:23,064
Come here.

1080
01:34:25,358 --> 01:34:26,358
I love you.

1081
01:34:26,901 --> 01:34:28,987
We're getting married in a week.

1082
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:38,456
I want to have a baby with you.

1083
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:42,336
You do?

1084
01:34:44,046 --> 01:34:45,797
Oh, honey!

1085
01:34:47,049 --> 01:34:48,675
I'd love to have a baby.

1086
01:34:50,177 --> 01:34:51,888
I thought I was getting too old.

1087
01:34:56,059 --> 01:34:57,769
A baby!

1088
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:04,193
- I want us to be together always.
- We will!

1089
01:35:10,741 --> 01:35:12,786
It's the reality of things sometimes...

1090
01:35:13,036 --> 01:35:16,915
...they don't always work out
exactly as they are planned, so...

1091
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,793
What are you saying?

1092
01:35:22,713 --> 01:35:24,882
- I want you to sign this.
- What is it?

1093
01:35:25,132 --> 01:35:27,093
Contrat de mariage.

1094
01:35:28,094 --> 01:35:30,846
A letter of financial agreement.

1095
01:35:31,514 --> 01:35:35,977
God forbid something should happen
to us. It just helps us stay friends.

1096
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:40,190
I want to be your wife, not your friend.

1097
01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:44,445
It's fair. I allocated for myself
what was mine before our marriage.

1098
01:35:45,029 --> 01:35:47,198
You cannot expect me to give you...

1099
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:51,452
...half of a house that's been
in my family for centuries.

1100
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:58,752
We don't need this kind of thing
between us. We'll make it.

1101
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,672
I can't get married without it.

1102
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,644
It's in French.

1103
01:36:13,894 --> 01:36:15,354
Please.

1104
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,169
Private Benjamin?

1105
01:36:36,419 --> 01:36:38,880
Did I write that? I'm sorry.

1106
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:40,798
I'll just cross it out.

1107
01:36:46,055 --> 01:36:47,765
Initial it.

1108
01:37:02,072 --> 01:37:04,533
Where shall we go tonight?
Regine's?

1109
01:37:19,883 --> 01:37:23,512
Took Henri's car to the shop.
Made Henri's hair appointment.

1110
01:37:23,762 --> 01:37:25,640
Took Max to the vet.

1111
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:28,351
Picked up Henri's soccer uniform.

1112
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:38,529
You've got to remember that
I used to be a very active person.

1113
01:37:38,779 --> 01:37:41,031
I was jumping out of airplanes...

1114
01:37:41,281 --> 01:37:44,368
...and at S.H.A.P.E. It was
like nonstop chaos.

1115
01:37:44,618 --> 01:37:46,996
You're not thinking about
opening a store?

1116
01:37:47,247 --> 01:37:49,165
No, you were right about that.

1117
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:52,961
It would've been too much
of a hassle to do. It was a bad idea.

1118
01:37:53,211 --> 01:37:56,924
But there have to be other choices.

1119
01:37:57,174 --> 01:37:59,593
Do you know what I did today?

1120
01:38:00,803 --> 01:38:02,888
I rearranged my closet.

1121
01:38:03,139 --> 01:38:04,557
For three hours.

1122
01:38:04,807 --> 01:38:08,103
There's definitely something wrong
with that, isn't there?

1123
01:38:10,147 --> 01:38:12,607
- Am I making sense?
- No.

1124
01:38:13,525 --> 01:38:15,360
And that's what I love about you.

1125
01:38:18,698 --> 01:38:21,159
This is the color of hair
I was talking about.

1126
01:38:22,827 --> 01:38:24,912
I don't know. Maybe.

1127
01:38:26,957 --> 01:38:28,333
I love it.

1128
01:38:56,155 --> 01:38:58,283
Rita Hayworth, I swear to God!

1129
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:01,578
- I wouldn't have recognized you.
- You look stunning!

1130
01:39:01,828 --> 01:39:05,248
Turn around, let me see the outfit.
Oh God, doll! Gorgeous!

1131
01:39:05,499 --> 01:39:07,000
It's an absolute vision.

1132
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,379
Her hair is the worst!

1133
01:39:09,629 --> 01:39:13,841
To see you looking like your
old self again, you have no idea!

1134
01:39:14,092 --> 01:39:15,968
Who knows what we'd do
in her place.

1135
01:39:17,095 --> 01:39:19,973
The important thing is,
Judy's Judy again.

1136
01:39:20,224 --> 01:39:24,812
- Truthfully, you don't miss the Army?
- What's to miss? $400 a month?

1137
01:39:25,062 --> 01:39:28,065
The only good thing about it
was that what's-her-name.

1138
01:39:28,315 --> 01:39:29,693
Captain Lewis?

1139
01:39:30,276 --> 01:39:33,571
I hope her coat's good enough.
I had no idea it'd be so chilly.

1140
01:39:33,822 --> 01:39:38,661
- It's November here, Kissy.
- It's November everywhere, genius!

1141
01:39:47,545 --> 01:39:48,754
Sit!

1142
01:39:50,382 --> 01:39:52,634
I was talking to Max.

1143
01:39:55,137 --> 01:39:57,222
It's good to see you up.

1144
01:39:58,515 --> 01:40:00,727
Excuse me for interrupting.

1145
01:40:01,811 --> 01:40:03,479
Does this belong to anyone?

1146
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:06,482
Because I'm positive it isn't mine.

1147
01:40:06,733 --> 01:40:08,568
Oui, Madame.
Where did you find it?

1148
01:40:08,818 --> 01:40:10,404
Where you left eet!

1149
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:13,574
May I ask what you were doing
in my bed?!

1150
01:40:13,824 --> 01:40:16,535
I was not in your bed, madame.
I make your bed.

1151
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,663
It must have fallen.

1152
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:21,790
What are you doing?

1153
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,919
I would like to know how
this item got into my bed.

1154
01:40:29,382 --> 01:40:33,054
This is too much!
Judy, give Gabrielle back the cross.

1155
01:40:40,186 --> 01:40:42,689
What should I think?
She's the world's worst maid!

1156
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:44,608
Enough! Please!

1157
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:52,742
What's gotten into you lately? It's like
I live with the kid from the Exorcist!

1158
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:56,412
Two weeks ago I was like a god to you!

1159
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,331
Now you show me no respect.

1160
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,583
I respect you.

1161
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:05,422
Accusing me of sleeping with Gabrielle!
You think I'm so low I'd seduce a child?

1162
01:41:08,258 --> 01:41:09,258
Do you?

1163
01:41:14,474 --> 01:41:16,726
Honey, I'm nervous.

1164
01:41:17,477 --> 01:41:19,646
I'm very nervous.

1165
01:41:19,896 --> 01:41:24,151
And I know that once we get married
everything is going to be fine.

1166
01:41:24,402 --> 01:41:26,070
I'm sorry.

1167
01:41:35,372 --> 01:41:39,126
I fly 6,000 miles to attend
my daughter's wedding...

1168
01:41:39,376 --> 01:41:41,253
...and the groom is playing soccer!

1169
01:41:41,503 --> 01:41:44,757
Daddy, he'll be here any minute.
He probably went into overtime.

1170
01:41:45,091 --> 01:41:47,343
Monsieur, my son is very reliable.

1171
01:41:47,593 --> 01:41:50,471
- He will be here shortly.
- It just isn't right!

1172
01:41:55,728 --> 01:41:57,271
Jean-Paul!

1173
01:42:02,234 --> 01:42:03,695
Where is Henri?

1174
01:42:04,362 --> 01:42:07,323
The bum never showed up
for the game. Isn't he here?

1175
01:42:08,491 --> 01:42:09,617
No.

1176
01:42:09,951 --> 01:42:11,036
He never showed up?

1177
01:42:14,498 --> 01:42:17,877
Judy, don't hate me
for saying this or nothing...

1178
01:42:18,127 --> 01:42:22,465
...but you really might be better-off.

1179
01:42:22,715 --> 01:42:24,634
Don't be ridiculous!

1180
01:42:26,386 --> 01:42:31,058
I don't know how to say this, but you
were starting to act a bit weird again.

1181
01:42:31,308 --> 01:42:33,477
What am I going to do?
I'm a wreck.

1182
01:42:34,228 --> 01:42:35,605
He's back!

1183
01:42:40,485 --> 01:42:42,070
You look perfect.

1184
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,946
- Where were you?
- I'm fine.

1185
01:42:44,198 --> 01:42:46,992
No, where were you?
I was so scared.

1186
01:42:47,242 --> 01:42:50,579
- You don't want to know this.
- I do want to know.

1187
01:42:53,207 --> 01:42:55,085
I had to see Claire.

1188
01:42:57,837 --> 01:42:58,838
You were with Claire?

1189
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:02,842
She is in so much trouble.
You've no idea what I've been through.

1190
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:07,014
There are 75 people waiting for you.
Couldn't you have phoned?

1191
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:10,893
- Don't bad French artists have phones?
- She was overwrought.

1192
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:15,273
Her boyfriend beat her up.
I prescribed a sedative for her to sleep.

1193
01:43:15,524 --> 01:43:18,068
That takes 2 minutes,
you were gone 4 hours.

1194
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:20,946
The place was a mess.
I hung up clothes and did dishes.

1195
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:23,407
You did Claire's dishes?

1196
01:43:25,284 --> 01:43:28,079
Shall I stop being nice to people
because we're marrying?

1197
01:43:28,621 --> 01:43:31,916
I just don't understand
how you could be with Claire...

1198
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:33,375
...today.

1199
01:43:33,501 --> 01:43:36,088
You want to walk down the aisle
with me or not?

1200
01:45:14,404 --> 01:45:16,823
Not so fast.

1201
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:23,038
I know this is a very awkward time
to do this...

1202
01:45:24,248 --> 01:45:25,582
...but I want to break up.

1203
01:45:25,874 --> 01:45:27,626
She's crazy again.

1204
01:45:28,377 --> 01:45:29,587
Listen to me.

1205
01:45:29,879 --> 01:45:34,592
You're having an anxiety attack.
I'll give you a shot to calm down.

1206
01:45:34,843 --> 01:45:37,971
No, I want to be perfectly conscious
when I call a cab.

1207
01:45:38,221 --> 01:45:41,767
What are you doing to me?
What is this about? Gabrielle?

1208
01:45:42,476 --> 01:45:45,187
I slept with her one night
when you were acting crazy.

1209
01:45:46,522 --> 01:45:48,983
We'll fire her after the wedding.

1210
01:45:52,529 --> 01:45:53,947
You're such a schmuck!

1211
01:45:56,324 --> 01:45:57,324
Daddy...

1212
01:45:57,451 --> 01:45:59,704
...Mom just fainted.

1213
01:46:01,122 --> 01:46:02,498
Schmuck?!

1214
01:46:03,624 --> 01:46:06,085
When I met you,
you were in the Army.

1215
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:08,880
You were nothing,
picking up strangers in bars!

1216
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:11,300
- Now just a minute!
- She was.

1217
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,429
I'll give you a future, a home, a name.
For once don't be stupid!

1218
01:46:16,805 --> 01:46:18,223
- There's Claire.
- Where?

1219
01:46:25,215 --> 01:46:26,499
Don't call me stupid.

1220
