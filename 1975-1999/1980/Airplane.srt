1
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:40,266
The white zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only.

2
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,061
There is no stopping in the red zone.

3
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:49,526
The white zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only.

4
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,529
There is no stopping in the red zone.

5
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,585
Hello. Take this flower from
the Religious Consciousness Church.

6
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,589
- Would you care to make a donation?
- No, but thank you anyway.

7
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,929
The red zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only.

8
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,099
There's no stopping
in the white zone.

9
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,602
No. The white zone
is for loading and unloading.

10
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,689
There's no stopping in the red zone.

11
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,693
The red zone's always been
for loading and unloading.

12
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,320
There's never stopping
in a white zone.

13
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,241
Don't tell me which zone's for
stopping and which is for loading.

14
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,078
Listen, Betty, don't start up
with your white zone shit again.

15
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,793
Hello. Take this flower from
the Religious Consciousness Church.

16
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,628
Would you like to make a donation?

17
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,256
No, thanks. We gave at the office.

18
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,810
Would you put all your metal objects
into this dish, please?

19
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,738
There's just no stopping
in a white zone.

20
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,782
Really, Vernon, why pretend?

21
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,743
We both know
what you're talking about.

22
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,787
You want me to have an abortion.

23
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,415
It's the only sensible thing to do.
If it's done properly,

24
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,585
therapeutically,
there's no danger involved.

25
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,003
Taxi!

26
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,346
I'll be back in a minute.

27
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,399
Hello, sir, take this flower from
the Religious Consciousness Church.

28
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,109
Would you care...

29
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,794
- Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?
- Forklift?

30
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,588
It's over there
by the baggage loader.

31
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,428
Look out!

32
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,567
- Elaine.
- Ted!

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,278
I came home early
and found your note.

34
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,323
I guess you meant for me to read
it later. I've got to talk to you.

35
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,868
I don't want to go over it any more.

36
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,537
Things haven't been right
for a long time,

37
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,832
but it'll be different,
like in the beginning.

38
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,959
Just be patient
and I'll work things out.

39
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,171
I have been patient
and I've tried to help,

40
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
but you wouldn't even let me do that.

41
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,595
Don't you feel anything
for me any more?

42
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,058
It takes so many things
to make love last.

43
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,268
Most of all, it takes respect.

44
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,564
I can't live with a man
I don't respect!

45
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,280
What a pisser.

46
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,958
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

47
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,212
Captain Clarence Oveur,
white courtesy phone.

48
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,135
No, the white phone!

49
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,432
This is Captain Oveur.

50
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,644
One moment for your call
from the Mayo Clinic.

51
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,647
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

52
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,941
- I've got it!
- Thank you.

53
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,984
Go ahead with your call.

54
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,153
This is Dr Brody at the Mayo Clinic.

55
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,823
There's a passenger
on your Chicago flight,

56
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,992
a little girl named Lisa Davis,
en route to Minneapolis.

57
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,495
She's scheduled
for a heart transplant.

58
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,872
Tell her mother we found a donor.

59
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,041
The heart is ready for surgery.

60
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,628
We must have the recipient on
the operating table within six hours.

61
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,173
Make sure she's kept
in a reclined position,

62
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,260
that a continuous watch
is kept on her IV.

63
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,679
It's very important
she remain calm...

64
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,681
Excuse me, this is the operator.

65
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,893
I have an emergency call
on line five from Mr Hamm.

66
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,104
Give me Hamm on five, hold the Mayo.

67
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,050
You'll be back tomorrow night.

68
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,177
We'll have dinner.
We'll talk things over.

69
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,764
I won't be back.
I've requested the Atlanta run.

70
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,767
Elaine... I promise I can change.

71
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,771
Then why didn't you take the job that
Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

72
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,649
I haven't been able to get near
a plane since the war.

73
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,403
And they wouldn't hire me
because of my war record.

74
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,157
War record? You're the only one
keeping that alive.

75
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,493
For everyone else,
it's ancient history.

76
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,038
- You expect me to believe that?
- It's the truth.

77
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,208
What's hurt you the most
is your record since the war -

78
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,793
different cities, different jobs -

79
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,338
and not one of them shows you
can accept any real responsibility.

80
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,466
- Elaine, just give me one more...
- It's too late, Ted.

81
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,052
When I get back to Chicago,

82
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,431
I'm going to start my life
all over again. I'm sorry.

83
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,270
Excuse me, take this flower
from the Church of Religious...

84
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,408
Hi! Well, good evening.

85
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,412
There you go.
Just follow them to the back.

86
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,293
Any word on that storm lifting
over Salt Lake, Clarence?

87
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,921
No, not likely, Victor.

88
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:29,050
I just reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

89
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,137
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas,

90
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,097
backed up all the way to Utah.

91
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,101
If she decides to push over the Great
Lakes, it could get plenty soupy.

92
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,145
What about that southern route
around Tulsa?

93
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,689
I double-checked
the terminal forecast,

94
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,026
and the wind's aloft
and IFR ceilings all the way.

95
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,944
Where do they top out?

96
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,948
Light scattered cover
at 20,000, icing around 18.

97
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:57,162
- Looks like over Denver is best.
- Denver it is.

98
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,955
Sorry, Clarence.

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,334
Latest report shows everything's
socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

100
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,169
Hi, Roger. Glad to have you aboard.

101
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,046
Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Victor Basta.

102
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,381
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

103
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,676
I was telling Victor
I reviewed the area report

104
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,055
for 1600 hours through 2400.

105
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,391
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas.

106
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,487
There you go. Thank you.

107
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,448
Is Elaine Dickinson on this flight?

108
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:38,370
The whole flight crew has boarded.
Let me see.

109
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,288
Oh, yes. She is on board.

110
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,212
I'd like one ticket to Chicago.
No baggage.

111
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,513
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Smoking, please.

112
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,725
There. Have a nice trip.

113
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,744
Striker, this is Red Leader Four.

114
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,996
Primary target covered by fog.

115
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,165
Decision to proceed is yours.

116
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,585
The decision is yours...

117
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,463
is yours... is yours...

118
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,934
Golly, that white fellow
should stay away from my wife,

119
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,645
or I will punch him.

120
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,233
Yes, he is wrong for doing that.

121
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,944
I knew a man
in a similar predicament,

122
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,529
and he ended up being sorry.

123
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,865
Don't be naive, Arthur.

124
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,160
Each of us faces
a clear moral choice.

125
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,708
Early to bed, early to rise makes
a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

126
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,418
How true!

127
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,502
Golly!

128
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,417
Nervous?

129
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,378
Yes.

130
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,172
First time?

131
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,217
No. I've been nervous lots of times.

132
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,185
Hi. We'll be taking off real soon,
so I better fasten you in tight.

133
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,271
Thank you.
Oh, Mother, this is so exciting!

134
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,274
I know, but remember,
you must get some rest.

135
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,445
That's good advice. You relax,
and I'll be back after takeoff.

136
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,905
Thank you.

137
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,619
- I'm going to miss you so much.
- I'm going to miss you, too.

138
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,622
Promise you'll write?

139
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,833
Every day.

140
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,669
Bill!

141
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,963
Better get on board, son.

142
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,842
All aboard!

143
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,220
209er to ground control.
We're ready to taxi.

144
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,140
- Goodbye, Bill!
- Goodbye, darling!

145
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,100
I love you, darling!

146
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,728
209er, taxi to runway 19er.

147
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,024
Goodbye, darling!

148
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,736
Have your picture taken the minute
you get there and send me one.

149
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,946
OK. Here, hurry.

150
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,452
It's your watch. You shouldn't.
You're going to need this.

151
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,829
It's all right. It doesn't work.

152
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,831
- Bill!
- Goodbye, darling!

153
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,249
Bill!

154
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,129
Bill! Bill!
I'll keep it with me all the time.

155
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,631
Goodbye, darling.
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.

156
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,052
- Flight 209er - clear for takeoff.
- Roger.

157
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,222
- LA departure frequency 123.9er.
- Roger.

158
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,310
- Request vector. Over.
- What?

159
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,687
Flight 209er, clear for vector 324.

160
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,065
- We have clearance, Clarence.
- Roger, Roger.

161
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,025
What's our vector, Victor?

162
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,112
- I want radio clearance. Over.
- That's Clarence Oveur. Over.

163
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,989
- Roger.
- Huh?

164
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,950
- Roger. Over.
- Huh? Who?

165
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,853
Do you feel all right, sir?

166
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,524
Oh, I haven't flown for a long time.

167
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,451
Good evening.
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

168
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,746
We'll be cruising
at 36,000 feet this evening...

169
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,926
Relax and enjoy your flight.

170
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,137
Would you like something to read?

171
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,305
Do you have anything light?

172
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,270
How about this leaflet,
"Famous Jewish Sports Legends"?

173
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,313
Yes. Thank you.

174
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,943
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk to you.

175
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,612
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

176
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,740
- Stewardess?
- Excuse me.

177
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:07,866
But...

178
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,591
No wonder you're upset. She's lovely.

179
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,471
And a darling figure.

180
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:34,225
Supple, pouting breasts, firm thighs.

181
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,646
It's a shame you two
don't get along.

182
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,774
Yes, I know.

183
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,901
Things used to be different.

184
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,782
I remember when we first met.

185
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,868
It was during the war.

186
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,787
I was in the air force,

187
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:57,540
stationed in Drambuie,
off the Barbary Coast.

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,085
I used to hang out
at the Magumba Bar.

189
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,047
It was a rough place.
The seediest dive on the wharf,

190
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:09,094
populated with every reject and
cut-throat from Bombay to Calcutta.

191
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,137
It was worse than Detroit.

192
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,109
The mood in the place was ugly.

193
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,779
You wouldn't be there unless
you knew how to use your fists.

194
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,490
A fight broke out almost every night.

195
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,021
I didn't go there that night
to fall in love.

196
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,148
I just wanted a couple of drinks.

197
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,233
And suddenly, there she was.

198
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,997
I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt.

199
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,627
I had to asked this guy to pinch me
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

200
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,509
I was afraid to approach her,

201
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,345
but that night, fate was on my side.

202
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:25,535
We laughed, we talked, we danced.

203
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,372
I never wanted it to end.
I guess I still don't.

204
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:33,585
Enough about me. I hope
this hasn't been boring for you.

205
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,546
Whenever I talk about Elaine,
I get carried away.

206
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,590
I lose all track of time.

207
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,969
Would you like to order dinner?

208
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,972
Joey will have steak.
We'll have fish.

209
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,016
When can I see the cockpit?

210
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:52,020
The pilots are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

211
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,730
Aw, gee whizz!

212
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:57,317
I'll talk to the captain
and see what I can arrange.

213
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,652
Gee, that'd be swell!

214
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,324
Would you care to order your dinners?

215
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,952
I would like the steak, please.

216
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,792
I'll have the fish.

217
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,469
Excuse me, I happened to be passing.

218
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,055
I thought you might like some coffee.

219
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,849
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

220
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,230
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

221
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,527
- Cream?
- No, I take it black.

222
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,487
Like my men.

223
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,019
Ted, I never knew
I could be so happy.

224
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:59,439
These past few months
have been wonderful.

225
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:04,402
Tomorrow, why don't we drive
to that little seafood place and...

226
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,656
- What's the matter?
- My orders came through.

227
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,700
My squadron ships out tomorrow.

228
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:14,287
We're bombing the storage depots
at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

229
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,831
We're coming in
from the north, below their radar.

230
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,750
When will you be back?

231
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,170
I can't tell you that.
It's classified.

232
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:26,966
Oh, Ted, please be careful.
I worry about you so much.

233
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,552
I love you, Elaine.

234
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,721
I love you.

235
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,205
Flight 209er,
this is Denver flight control.

236
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,374
You're approaching rough weather.

237
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,918
Please climb to 42,000 feet.

238
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,089
- Roger, Denver.
- We have a visitor.

239
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,215
Hello.

240
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,636
Captain Oveur, Mr Murdock,
and Mr Basta, this is Joey Hammen.

241
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,888
- Hi, Joey.
- Come up here.

242
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:18,018
This is for special visitors.
Would you like to have it?

243
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:22,647
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- Sure. Ever been in a cockpit?

244
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,650
No, I've never been up
in a plane before.

245
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,486
Have you ever seen a grown man naked?

246
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:32,741
- Shall I check the weather?
- No, why don't you take care of it?

247
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:36,786
Joey, do you ever hang around
a gymnasium?

248
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:40,373
- We'd better get back.
- No, Joey can stay for a while.

249
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,335
- Could I?
- OK, if you don't get in the way.

250
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,297
Flight 209er to Denver,
climbing to cruise at 42,000.

251
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,675
Will report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

252
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,721
Wait a minute, I know you.
You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

253
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:57,932
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

254
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:01,519
Sorry, you have me confused
with someone else.

255
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,898
My name's Roger Murdock.
I'm the co-pilot.

256
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,860
You are Kareem! I've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

257
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:12,197
You should go back to your seat now.
Right, Clarence?

258
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,409
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

259
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,581
All right, but just remember
my name is Roger Murdock.

260
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,416
I'm an airline pilot.

261
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,543
I think you're the greatest,

262
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,090
but my dad says you don't work hard
enough on defence.

263
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,927
And he says lots of times
you don't even run downcourt.

264
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:37,263
And you don't try,
except during play-offs.

265
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,224
The hell I don't!

266
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:44,813
Listen, kid, I've been hearing
that crap ever since I was at UCLA.

267
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm out there busting my buns
every night.

268
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,403
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

269
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,822
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

270
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,204
Joey...

271
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:03,415
Do you like movies about gladiators?

272
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:11,881
Elaine, just hear me out.

273
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,676
Things haven't been right
for a long time,

274
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,930
but it'll be different,
like in the beginning, remember?

275
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:22,100
I remember everything.

276
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,978
All I have is memories.

277
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:28,273
Mostly, I remember the nights
we were together.

278
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,776
I remember how you used to hold me,

279
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:35,238
and how I used to sit on your face
and wriggle, and...

280
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:39,117
afterwards, how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

281
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:42,537
When it did, it was almost like...

282
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:47,083
like each new day was
created only for us.

283
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,919
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be.

284
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,088
But it won't be.

285
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:56,092
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past!

286
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,855
You're too low, Ted! You're too low!

287
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,992
The mind plays tricks on you.

288
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:26,247
He looks so happy today, doesn't he?

289
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,375
You look so happy today.

290
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:34,047
OK, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

291
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,841
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

292
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,010
Headquarters? What is it?

293
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,681
A big building where generals meet,
but that's not important.

294
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:46,643
They've cleared you of any blame
for what happened on that raid.

295
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,521
- Isn't that good news?
- Is it?

296
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:54,526
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

297
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,696
Seven.
Lieutenant Zip died this morning.

298
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:01,658
But Dr Sandler says you'll be out
in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

299
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:05,787
I wish I could say the same
for George Zip.

300
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:10,834
Be patient, Ted. Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

301
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,838
Hey, Striker, how about a break?
I'm getting tired.

302
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,048
Yeah, all right. Take five.

303
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,260
Thanks.

304
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:24,014
I found a wonderful apartment for us.

305
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,141
It has a brick fireplace

306
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,602
and a cute bedroom
with mirrors on the ceiling and...

307
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,647
Red Leader!
Red Leader, I'm going down!

308
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:37,360
Captain Geline. He think he's
a pilot, still fighting the war.

309
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,406
I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
It's this way!

310
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:44,367
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

311
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:51,249
- What's his problem?
- It's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

312
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,460
Severe shell shock.

313
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,670
He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

314
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:16,608
War is hell.

315
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:25,283
Excuse me, sir. Would you
like coffee before dinner?

316
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,702
No. No, thank you.

317
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:33,249
- Would you like another cup?
- I will, but Jim won't.

318
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:37,671
I think I will have
another cup of coffee.

319
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:41,049
Jim never has a second
cup of coffee at home.

320
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,766
- Excuse me, sister.
- Yes?

321
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,310
There's a little girl
onboard who's ill.

322
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,188
Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

323
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:59,317
Could I borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

324
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,903
- Of course.
- Thank you.

325
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,495
- Hi.
- Hi.

326
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,415
Do you mind if I talk
to your daughter?

327
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,084
I think that'd would be nice.

328
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,505
- Hi, I'm Randy.
- I'm Lisa.

329
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,425
Oh, you have a guitar!

330
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,594
I thought maybe you'd
like to hear a song.

331
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,263
I'd love to.

332
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:31,099
OK. Let's see...

333
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,268
This is one of my favorites.

334
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:02,524
You're late. We've been waiting.

335
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,859
- Who's first?
- Go ahead, Clarence.

336
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,986
How's the weather?

337
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,114
We got some heavy stuff ahead.

338
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,116
We've got to climb on top.

339
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:17,122
Yeah, after the war, I wanted
to get as far away as possible,

340
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:21,084
so Elaine and I
joined the Peace Corps.

341
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:25,797
We were assigned
to an isolated tribe, the Molombos.

342
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,800
They'd never seen Americans before.

343
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:44,733
It was really a challenge,

344
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:48,028
introducing them
to our western culture.

345
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:54,993
At first, they didn't know
what to think of us.

346
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,245
But soon, we gained their trust.

347
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,507
It'll help you better
prepare storing foods

348
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,886
for the up and coming
monsoon months.

349
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:17,891
Also, Supperware products
are ideal for storing leftovers

350
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,769
to help stretch your food dollar.

351
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:24,731
This two-quart
"Seals-M-Rite" container

352
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,525
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

353
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,946
These people had been completely
isolated from civilization.

354
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:35,867
No one had outlined a physical
fitness program for them,

355
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,827
and they had no athletic equipment.

356
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,871
I started them
on simple calisthenics,

357
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,664
worked up to rudimentary game skills,

358
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,709
and finally,
advanced competitive theory.

359
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:48,088
I was patient,
and they were eager to learn.

360
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,964
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

361
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,468
Probably due to advanced
American teaching techniques,

362
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:56,471
we bridged the generations
of isolation,

363
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,265
and communicated successfully
with the Molombos.

364
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:07,482
They're getting the hang of it.

365
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,609
When we re-enlist,
I'll teach them baseball.

366
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:12,529
Ted, I don't want to stay here.

367
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:16,991
It's time to go home
to the plans we made before the war.

368
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,248
A lot of people made plans
before the war. Like George Zip.

369
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:33,299
At that moment, I realised Elaine
had doubts about our relationship.

370
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:37,512
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.

371
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,684
We did come back to the States.
I tried a number of jobs.

372
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:46,104
I could go on,
but I'd probably bore you.

373
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,940
I couldn't blame Elaine.
She wanted a career.

374
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,783
- I can't stand it.
- What is it?

375
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,952
- Yes?
- It's my stomach.

376
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:05,373
I haven't felt this awful
since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

377
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:09,127
I'll see if I can find
some dramamine.

378
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:19,471
Captain, a woman passenger
is very sick.

379
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,097
Airsick?

380
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:25,226
I think so,
but I've never seen it so acute.

381
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:29,397
Find out if a doctor's onboard
as quietly as you can.

382
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:36,529
Joey, have you ever been
in a Turkish prison?

383
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,035
I shouldn't have had
that second cup of coffee.

384
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:56,841
Jim never vomits at home.

385
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,969
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for a doctor.

386
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,805
There's nothing to worry about.

387
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,809
Stewardess, I think the man
next to me is a doctor.

388
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:09,646
Sir, excuse me. Sorry to wake you,
are you a doctor?

389
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:13,024
- That's right.
- We have sick passengers.

390
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:16,903
- Could you come look at them?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

391
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,956
Let me see your tongue.

392
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,155
I'll be back in a minute.

393
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:09,539
Tell the captain to land.
She must go to a hospital.

394
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,708
A hospital! What is it?

395
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,878
It's a big building with patients,
but that's not important.

396
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,964
- I must speak to the captain.
- Certainly.

397
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,723
Victor, we're running into heavy...

398
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:29,017
Roger, take over!

399
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:55,001
- Captain, how soon can you land?
- I can't tell.

400
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,338
- You can tell me. I'm a doctor.
- No, I'm not sure.

401
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:03,134
- Can't you take a guess?
- Not for another two hours.

402
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:06,346
You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

403
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:10,016
No, we can't land.
Fog has closed down everything.

404
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,268
We've got to get through to Chicago.

405
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,569
Get him out of there!

406
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,305
What is it, Doctor? What's going on?

407
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,891
I'm not sure.
Haven't seen anything like this

408
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,019
since the Anita Bryant Concert.

409
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:58,815
- What did we have for dinner?
- We had a choice - steak or fish.

410
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:01,901
Yes, I remember. I had Lasagna.

411
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,404
- What did he have?
- He had fish.

412
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:08,700
Doctor, two more are sick.
The other passengers are worried.

413
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:10,827
We'll handle the passengers.

414
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,997
Find out what the sick people
had for dinner.

415
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,707
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

416
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:20,003
It's bumpy, but we'll be past it
in a few minutes.

417
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,340
We're now flying over Hoover Dam,

418
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:26,968
and later we'll pass south
of the Grand Canyon.

419
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:29,596
Meanwhile, relax
and enjoy your flight, OK?

420
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:35,685
Chicago, this is flight 209er.
We're in trouble.

421
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,812
We need traffic below us cleared

422
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,606
and priority landing in Chicago.

423
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,570
Yes?

424
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:49,574
My husband's very sick.
Can you do something?

425
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:53,161
The doctor will be with you
in just a moment.

426
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,205
Do you know what he had for dinner?

427
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,499
Yes, we both had fish. Why?

428
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,959
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

429
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,170
We'll be back to you very quickly.

430
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,262
Doctor, Mr Hammen ate fish,

431
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:15,308
and Randy said there are five
more cases, and they all had fish.

432
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:18,478
The co-pilot had fish.
What did the navigator have?

433
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:20,230
He had fish.

434
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,566
All right, now we know
what we're up against.

435
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:28,655
Those who had fish for dinner
will soon become violently ill.

436
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,826
- Just how serious is it?
- Extremely serious.

437
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:36,454
It starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

438
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:39,374
When the virus penetrates,
the victim becomes dizzy,

439
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:42,752
and begins to experience
an itching rash.

440
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:46,339
From there, the poison works
on the central nervous system,

441
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:48,341
causing severe muscle spasms,

442
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:50,385
followed by the inevitable drooling.

443
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,971
At this point,
the digestive system collapses,

444
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,849
accompanied
by uncontrollable flatulence.

445
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:58,309
Until, finally,
the poor bastard is reduced

446
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:01,021
to a quivering,
wasted piece of jelly.

447
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:22,167
Put it on... automatic pilot.

448
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:27,172
Automatic pilot, automatic pilot...
There it is!

449
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:38,600
I'll go back to the passengers.

450
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:43,480
Come in, 209er. This is Chicago.

451
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:45,857
Flight 209er, come in.

452
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,694
This is Elaine Dickinson,
the stewardess.

453
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:51,780
Captain Oveur's passed out.

454
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:55,408
We've lost the co-pilot
and navigator, too. We're in trouble.

455
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:58,787
Roger. I'm Steve McCroskey,
Chicago air control.

456
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:02,665
I'll be back in a moment.
Hold all takeoffs.

457
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,460
When 508 reports,
bring it straight in.

458
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:09,422
Suspend all meal service
on flights leaving Los Angeles.

459
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:12,300
Tell all dispatchers
to remain at the post.

460
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,135
- How about coffee?
- No, thanks.

461
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,597
I want the weather
on every available landing field.

462
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:19,391
You understand?

463
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,894
Any place available
to land that plane!

464
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,856
Go to the tower
and get a runway diagram.

465
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,193
Check down the field
for emergency equipment.

466
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,614
Chief, we got fog every place
east of the Rockies.

467
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,410
They'll have
to come through to Chicago.

468
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:41,705
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

469
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,376
Get the best available man
who won't crack under pressure.

470
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:48,962
How about Mr Rogers?

471
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,134
Get me Rex Kramer.

472
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,684
Next to the throttle
is the air speed gauge.

473
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,854
What speed does it indicate?

474
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:10,650
- 520 miles per hour.
- Good. Very good.

475
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:13,236
Now, check your altitude.

476
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:16,865
That's the dial below and right
of the speed indicator.

477
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:20,076
35,000 feet.

478
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,079
No, wait. 34,000 feet.

479
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:26,666
No. It's dropping!
It's dropping fast!

480
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,461
Why is it doing that?

481
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:35,967
Oh, my God! The automatic pilot,
it's deflating!

482
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,428
Elaine, don't panic.

483
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:41,473
On his belt line
there's a hollow tube.

484
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,100
That's the manual inflation nozzle.

485
00:44:44,225 --> 00:44:46,728
Pull it out and blow on it.

486
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:53,777
What the hell's going on up there?

487
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:51,292
- Elaine.
- Yes, Doctor?

488
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,547
Elaine, you're a member of this crew.

489
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:58,216
- Can you face some unpleasant facts?
- No.

490
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:01,970
Unless we hospitalise
those people quickly,

491
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:04,973
I can't be sure
of saving their lives.

492
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:08,143
Is there anyone on board
who can land this plane?

493
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,103
Well...

494
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:14,315
No. No one I know of.

495
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:19,863
You ought to know our chances.
Our lives depend on just one thing -

496
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:25,118
finding someone to fly this plane
who didn't have fish for dinner.

497
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:40,592
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your stewardess speaking.

498
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:44,763
We regret any inconvenience
the sudden cabin movement caused.

499
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:48,600
This is due to periodic air pockets.

500
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:53,188
There's no reason to become alarmed.
We hope you enjoy your flight.

501
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:58,068
By the way, is there anyone
on board who can fly a plane?

502
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,724
Hello. I'm Paul Carey
from the airline.

503
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:32,268
- I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
- Yes. Come in, Paul.

504
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,479
Rex will be right out.

505
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:39,484
Shep, sit. Sit!

506
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:42,278
I understand there's an emergency.

507
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:46,825
Something like that. There wasn't
time to tell me very much...

508
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:51,162
Shep, no!

509
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,582
I'll bet exciting things
happen all the time down there.

510
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,210
Airline business
does have its moments.

511
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:59,921
After a while, you get used to it.

512
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:03,508
Shep! Come!

513
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:08,596
He gets so excited
when new people are here.

514
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:11,766
- Are you a pilot?
- No, I'm in...

515
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:14,227
a training program.

516
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:17,647
It's unbelievable.
It's just unbelievable.

517
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:21,276
How many times have I warned
about food inspection?

518
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,237
You'd think
someone would listen to you.

519
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:29,242
Well, airport management,
the FAA, and the airlines...

520
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:31,619
they're all cheats and liars.

521
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:34,414
All right. Let's get out of here.

522
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:45,967
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for someone with flying experience.

523
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:50,055
When they built those roads,
they didn't think about drainage,

524
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,100
so we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

525
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:56,269
We were lucky to get a jeep,

526
00:48:56,394 --> 00:49:00,690
since, just the day before,
only one we had broke down.

527
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:02,317
It had a bad axle...

528
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:05,320
Excuse me, sir.
There's a problem in the cockpit.

529
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,322
The cockpit? What is it?

530
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:10,742
The little room where the pilot sits.
That's not important.

531
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:12,494
The first officer is ill,

532
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,747
and the captain needs someone
to help him with the radio.

533
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:18,333
Do you know anything about planes?

534
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:21,378
I flew in the war years ago.

535
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,756
I wouldn't know anything about it.

536
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:26,883
Would you go up, please?

537
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:45,527
The stewardess said...

538
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:51,533
- Both pilots?
- Can you fly this plane and land it?

539
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:53,993
Surely, you can't be serious.

540
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,830
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

541
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:01,751
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr Striker's the only one.

542
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:03,586
What's your flying experience?

543
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:07,799
I flew single-engine fighters,
but this plane has four engines.

544
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:10,802
It's an entirely different
kind of flying... altogether.

545
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:14,139
It's an entirely different
kind of flying.

546
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:19,519
I haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

547
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:22,981
Mr Striker,
I know nothing about flying.

548
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:27,861
You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it.

549
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:30,655
You're the only chance we've got.

550
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:15,492
That's right. That's what I said.
You heard me.

551
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,619
Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

552
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:21,164
Every piece
of emergency equipment available.

553
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:24,334
Alert rescue units every mile
of the way, from here to the Rockies.

554
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:26,503
Chief!

555
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,631
We'll need
a free-landing flight check. Fast.

556
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:31,925
- It's your wife.
- I want the kids in bed by nine,

557
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,260
the dog fed, the yard watered,
the gate locked.

558
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:37,430
Get a note to the milkman -
"No more cheese."

559
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:41,559
Where the hell is Kramer?

560
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:54,030
No, he can't do that.
The risk of a flame-out's too great.

561
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:57,367
Keep him at 24,000... No, feet.

562
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,289
A passenger is going
to land that plane.

563
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,501
- Is that possible?
- It's a hundred to one shot.

564
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,050
- I know this guy.
- You do? Who is it?

565
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,928
Ted striker.
I flew with him during the war.

566
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:20,724
It won't make my job easier.

567
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:24,060
Ted Striker was a crack
flight leader.

568
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:29,607
He was one of those men who...
felt too much inside.

569
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,776
Maybe you know that kind.

570
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:35,613
He went all to pieces
on a particular mission.

571
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:38,783
Let's just hope
that doesn't happen tonight.

572
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:50,462
Let's see... Altitude, 24,000 feet.

573
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:55,175
Level flight. Speed, 520 knots.

574
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,011
Course Zero Niner Zero.

575
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:01,973
Trim, mixture.
Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

576
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,814
Ted! What are you doing here?
You can't fly this plane!

577
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:12,025
That's what I'm trying to tell them.

578
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:16,529
Elaine. I don't have time to be
gentle, so I'll be very direct.

579
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:19,157
Everyone is in a desperate situation.

580
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,619
Mr Striker is the only hope we got.

581
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:31,086
Those are the flaps.
This is the thrust.

582
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:34,589
This must turn on the landing lights.

583
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:51,898
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Mayday? What the hell is that?

584
00:53:52,023 --> 00:53:55,694
May Day's the Russian new year.
We'll have a big parade and serve...

585
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,998
I can't stand it any more.

586
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:11,960
I've got to get out of here!

587
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,129
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself!

588
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:17,298
- Please let me handle this.
- I've got to get out...

589
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:22,262
Calm down. Get to your seat.
I'll handle it.

590
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:24,347
Calm down. Get ahold of yourself.

591
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:26,766
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

592
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:30,228
Everything will be all right.

593
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,481
- Sister, I can handle this.
- Got to get out of here!

594
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,739
We'd like you to have this flower.

595
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,284
Excuse me, sir, would you...

596
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:47,203
Donations for Reverend Moon?

597
00:54:47,328 --> 00:54:49,039
Jews for Jesus?

598
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:52,500
Read about Jehovah's Witness?

599
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,086
How about Buddhism?

600
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:57,339
Help Jerry's kids?

601
00:54:57,464 --> 00:55:00,508
- Scientology?
- For nuclear power?

602
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:11,311
Your attention, please.
No-frills passengers now arriving.

603
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:15,440
Please have your baggage
claim checks ready to show

604
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:17,776
upon leaving the terminal.

605
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,904
This guy has no airline experience.

606
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:23,865
He's a menace
to everything in the air.

607
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,784
Yes, birds, too.

608
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:29,371
OK, he's a terrible risk,
but what other choice have we got?

609
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:33,333
That's the whole story, Rex.
Everything we know.

610
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,585
Let's face a few facts.

611
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,421
I flew with Striker during the war.

612
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:42,676
He can't afford to worry about those
times when... things weren't so good.

613
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:47,013
- Right now things aren't so good.
- Let me tell you something.

614
00:55:47,138 --> 00:55:50,266
Striker was a top-notch
squadron leader long ago.

615
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:54,771
Get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

616
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:57,941
Let him get the feel
of that airplane,

617
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:02,487
then you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground.

618
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,783
Very well.
Put Striker on the speaker.

619
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:09,953
Use my radio.

620
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:13,498
I took the wrong week
to quit drinking.

621
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,795
You can work them direct
from here, Captain.

622
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:25,719
Striker? Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

623
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,726
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

624
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:39,274
All right.
It's obvious you remember me.

625
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:43,862
What do you say we forget about
everything, except what we must do?

626
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,322
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

627
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,492
You know I've never flown
a bucket like this.

628
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:53,079
- I'll need all the luck there is.
- Stand by, Striker.

629
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:58,209
Our one hope is to build this man up.
I've got to give him confidence.

630
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:01,880
Striker, you ever flown
a multi-engine plane?

631
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:04,924
- No, never.
- Shit! It's a goddamn waste of time.

632
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,093
There's no way he can land it!

633
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:09,804
You got to talk him down! You got to!

634
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:13,350
Route him into Lake Michigan. At
least avoid killing innocent people.

635
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:16,436
You're the only chance they've got.

636
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:21,107
All right.

637
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:24,986
Striker, you listen,
and you listen close.

638
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:27,364
Flying a plane
is like riding a bicycle.

639
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:31,159
It's just harder
to put baseball cards in the spokes.

640
00:57:31,284 --> 00:57:33,203
First, get the feel of the plane.

641
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:38,249
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

642
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:44,381
All right.
Disengage the automatic pilot.

643
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:48,760
Make no violent control movements
like you did in the fighter planes.

644
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:51,930
All right.
I'll unlock the automatic pilot.

645
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:00,939
The controls will feel very heavy
compared to a fighter.

646
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:05,985
Don't worry about that.
It's perfectly normal.

647
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:20,291
Now, one more thing.

648
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:23,670
Can somebody work the radio
and leave you free for flying?

649
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,630
The stewardess is here with me.

650
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:29,384
Good. Have her sit
in the co-pilot seat.

651
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:34,723
Elaine, he wants you
to sit in the co-pilot seat.

652
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:46,401
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

653
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:48,528
All right, I'll level with you all.

654
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:51,781
The most important thing
is that you remain calm.

655
00:58:51,906 --> 00:58:54,075
There's no reason to panic.

656
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,454
It's true
one of the crew members is ill.

657
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,581
Slightly ill.

658
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,375
The other two pilots are fine.

659
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,377
They're flying the plane,

660
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:06,838
free to pursue
a life of religious fulfilment.

661
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:11,718
The radio is all yours. Keep an eye
on number three engine gauge.

662
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:13,845
It's running a little hot.

663
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:20,185
Striker,
first I'd like to say something.

664
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:24,022
I know things must look
pretty rough up there.

665
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:26,900
If you do what I tell you
when I tell you,

666
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:29,736
there's no reason
you should lack confidence

667
00:59:29,861 --> 00:59:33,490
in your chances of coming out
alive and in one piece.

668
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:35,992
What weather are you in?

669
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:39,496
- Rain.
- And a little ice.

670
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,289
And a little ice.

671
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:47,170
- How's it handling?
- Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

672
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:49,673
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

673
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,176
All right, Striker.
You're doing just fine.

674
00:59:54,302 --> 00:59:57,263
It's damn good
he doesn't know I hate his guts.

675
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:01,309
It's damn good
you don't know he hates your guts.

676
01:00:07,982 --> 01:00:10,652
Can I get you something?

677
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:17,867
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

678
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:22,622
- Stewardess. I speak jive.
- Good.

679
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:24,708
He said he's in great pain,

680
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:27,877
and he wants to know
if you can help him?

681
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:32,340
Tell him to relax.
I'll be back with some medicine.

682
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:05,248
Call Captain Oveur's wife
and let her know what's going on.

683
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:08,626
This weather bulletin
just came off the wire.

684
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:12,172
What can you make out of this?

685
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:16,634
This? I can make a hat
or a brooch or pterodactyl...

686
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:29,105
- Hello?
- Mrs Oveur?

687
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,066
Yes, this is Mrs Oveur.

688
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:33,651
This is Ed Macias
calling from the airport.

689
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:36,071
There's trouble
on your husband's flight.

690
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:38,198
We don't know how serious it is,

691
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:41,785
but Steve McCroskey thought you'd
want to come over right away.

692
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,746
Yes. I'll be right down.

693
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,834
I've got to go to the airport.

694
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:52,462
You can let yourself
out the back door.

695
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:54,589
There's juice in the refrigerator.

696
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:06,017
Doctor says the sick people
are getting worse.

697
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:08,061
We're running out of time.

698
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,731
I've got to concentrate.

699
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:15,777
I've got to concentrate.

700
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:19,489
Hello?

701
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:22,617
Echo!

702
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:28,081
Pinch hitting for Pedro Bourbone,

703
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:30,208
Manny Mota.

704
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:37,674
- How you doing, honey?
- Jack, I'm so hot, I'm burning up.

705
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,843
I'll turn on some air.

706
01:02:45,765 --> 01:02:49,144
- What's going on?
- Close the window!

707
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,688
Chicago,
the passengers are panicking.

708
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:54,024
When do we start down?

709
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:58,278
Not yet. You'll be in radar range
any second now.

710
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:02,073
They should have been in range
10 minutes ago.

711
01:03:02,198 --> 01:03:06,119
Gunderson, check the radar range.
Anything yet?

712
01:03:06,244 --> 01:03:08,163
About two more minutes, chief.

713
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,586
Two minutes?
They could be miles off course.

714
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:16,421
Impossible! They're on instruments.

715
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:23,136
This is going to be a real sweat.

716
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:26,014
Gunderson,
let me know when you get anything.

717
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:27,766
Got a cigarette, Nels?

718
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:30,685
I can't take much more of this.

719
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,609
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit amphetamines.

720
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,819
- Johnny, how about some more coffee?
- No, thanks.

721
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,489
These reporters want a statement.

722
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:46,409
- How much longer can they hold out?
- 30, 45 minutes.

723
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:49,329
- Who's flying the plane?
- A passenger.

724
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:52,791
He's an experienced air force pilot.
No cause for alarm.

725
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,085
- Take over.
- What kind of plane?

726
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,671
It's a big, pretty white plane

727
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:00,799
with red stripes,
curtains and wheels.

728
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,926
It looks like a big tylenol.

729
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:06,137
OK, boys. Let's get some pictures.

730
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,085
This bulletin just handed to me.

731
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,170
Stricken airliner
approaching Chicago...

732
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:56,146
Shana, they bought their tickets.

733
01:04:56,271 --> 01:05:00,442
They knew what
they were getting into.

734
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:03,737
I say, let them crash!

735
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,213
- Would you like some whisky, ma'am?
- Certainly not!

736
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:36,394
How are the passengers?

737
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:39,564
I won't deceive you, Mr Striker.
We're running out of time.

738
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:42,567
Surely, there's something you can do.

739
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:45,070
I'm doing everything I can...

740
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,280
and stop calling me Shirley.

741
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:13,682
Randy, are you all right?

742
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:17,310
Oh, Dr Rumack.

743
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:18,895
I'm scared.

744
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,690
I've never been so scared...

745
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:25,610
And besides,
I'm 26 and I'm not married.

746
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:29,197
We're going to make it.
You've got to believe that.

747
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:32,534
Dr Rumack, do you have any idea
when we'll be landing?

748
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,661
Pretty soon. How are you bearing up?

749
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:37,872
To be honest,
I've never been so scared,

750
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:40,417
but at least I have a husband.

751
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,308
Stay in formation.
Target's just ahead.

752
01:06:57,434 --> 01:07:00,729
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

753
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:04,399
You'll have to decide.
You'll have to decide.

754
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:07,318
You'll have to decide.

755
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:09,904
Stay in formation.
Target's just ahead.

756
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:13,658
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

757
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:16,870
You'll have to decide.
You'll have to decide.

758
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:18,747
You'll have to decide.

759
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:27,464
Oh, rats! Lost number four.

760
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:30,008
What happened? What went wrong?

761
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,094
I forgot to check the oil pressure.

762
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:37,098
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's going to hit the fan.

763
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:43,021
I told him to watch that
oil temperature. What's he doing?

764
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:45,899
Stiker, that plane can't land itself.

765
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:49,652
Ease off. It's not his fault.
It could happen to any pilot.

766
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:51,654
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

767
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,408
Can't push him too hard. Might break.
Remember who you're dealing with.

768
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,702
Nick, Pete, Jerry,
there's a fire in the barn.

769
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:02,665
He's right.
I can't take the pressure.

770
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,835
I was crazy to think
I could land this plane.

771
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,880
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- I don't care.

772
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:10,840
I don't have what it takes.

773
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:14,511
They would be better off with someone
who's never flown before.

774
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:27,857
Bad news. Fog's getting thicker.

775
01:08:27,982 --> 01:08:32,404
And Leon's getting larger.

776
01:08:55,885 --> 01:08:59,347
I know what you're going to say,
so save your breath.

777
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:03,935
Well, I don't have a thing to say.

778
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,938
You've done the best you could.

779
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:09,941
You really have. The best you could.

780
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:13,028
We can't expect to win them all.

781
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:19,576
I want to tell you something I've
kept to myself through these years.

782
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,788
I was in the war. Medical corps.

783
01:09:23,913 --> 01:09:29,002
One night, they brought in
a badly wounded pilot from one raid.

784
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:31,421
He could barely talk.

785
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:33,631
He looked up at me, he said,

786
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:38,511
"The odds were against us there,
but we went in anyway.

787
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:43,683
"I'm glad.
Captain made the right decision."

788
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:47,729
The pilot's name was George Zip.

789
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:51,608
George Zip said that?

790
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,195
The last thing he said to me,

791
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,074
"Doc," he said, "Sometime...

792
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,284
"...the crew is up against it.

793
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:03,703
"The breaks are beating the boys.

794
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:08,500
"Tell them to give it all they've got

795
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,753
"and win just one for the Zipper.

796
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:18,093
"I don't know
where I'll be then," he said...

797
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,930
"but I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."

798
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:26,893
Excuse me, doc.

799
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:29,145
I've got a plane to land.

800
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,114
You'd better stay up there a bit.

801
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,533
When the fog lifts,
we'll bring you in.

802
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:43,702
I'll take it, Elaine.

803
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:55,547
Listen, Dr Rumack says the sick
people are in critical condition.

804
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:58,758
Every minute counts.
We've got to land now.

805
01:10:58,925 --> 01:11:03,054
Don't be a fool, Striker. You know
what landing like this means.

806
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:05,098
I'm ordering you to stay up there.

807
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:07,183
No dice, Chicago.

808
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:10,311
I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.

809
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:13,898
I guess the foot's
on the other hand now.

810
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,445
He'll never make it in this soup.

811
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,198
But it's his ship now.
He's in charge.

812
01:11:22,323 --> 01:11:24,993
He's boss, head man, top dog,

813
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:27,203
big cheese, head honcho...

814
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:29,164
Captain, look at this.

815
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:32,000
"Passengers certain to die."

816
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,336
"Airline negligent."

817
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:37,297
There's a sale at Penny's!

818
01:11:39,674 --> 01:11:43,136
I'll need three men in the tower.
You, Neubauer, you, Macias.

819
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,263
Me John. Big tree.

820
01:11:46,264 --> 01:11:49,559
Striker, we're going to the tower.
Good luck.

821
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:51,436
They're going to the tower.

822
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:55,774
The tower! The tower!
Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

823
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:02,947
Stewardess, how soon till we land?

824
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:06,451
It won't be long now.
Try not to worry.

825
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,341
We're all ready, sir.

826
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:23,551
Captain McCroskey,
this is Captain Roberts.

827
01:12:23,677 --> 01:12:25,845
Captain Kramer,
this is Captain Colosimo.

828
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,806
Captain Hinshaw,
this is Captain Gantz.

829
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:31,476
Captain Kramer, Captain Gantz.
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

830
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:33,561
Colosimo, you work the relay.

831
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,855
Roberts, check air traffic.

832
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:40,318
Get that finger out of your ear.
You don't know where it's been.

833
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:44,572
- Steve!
- Got a cigarette, Nels?

834
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:48,326
Linda, your husband and the others
are alive but unconscious.

835
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:50,412
Just like Gerald Ford.

836
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:54,958
There's a chance we can save them
if Striker lands that plane in time.

837
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:57,419
That isn't much of a chance.

838
01:12:57,544 --> 01:13:01,423
I don't know. We're doing
everything we can. Now excuse me.

839
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:07,679
Where did you get that dress?
It's awful!

840
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:10,765
And those shoes and that coat! Geez!

841
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:18,773
8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

842
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:23,862
We're now at 2,000 feet
beginning our descent.

843
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:28,616
- Pour every light onto that field.
- It's being done.

844
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:36,416
Tower to emergency vehicles,
runway is niner.

845
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:40,128
Airport vehicles,
take positions one and two.

846
01:13:40,253 --> 01:13:42,422
Civilian equipment, number three.

847
01:13:44,549 --> 01:13:47,385
Air force, positions four and five.

848
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,763
All ambulances go to number three.

849
01:13:49,846 --> 01:13:53,892
Air Israel, please clear the runway.

850
01:13:58,688 --> 01:14:01,941
In a moment, we'll ask you
to assume crash positions.

851
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:04,319
Life jackets are under your seat.

852
01:14:04,402 --> 01:14:06,821
Place it over your head.

853
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:10,450
When I give the word,
pull the cord on the right side flap.

854
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,663
Your seat cushions are also equipped
with a flotation device.

855
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:21,211
WZAZ in Chicago,
where disco lives forever.

856
01:14:25,006 --> 01:14:29,260
Your altitude's too erratic.
You can't come straight in.

857
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:31,638
You've got enough fuel for two hours.

858
01:14:31,763 --> 01:14:34,891
I'll take it, Elaine.
Listen to me, Kramer.

859
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:39,187
We have people up here who will die
in less than an hour.

860
01:14:39,312 --> 01:14:44,317
I may bend your precious airplane,
but I'll get it down.

861
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:48,571
- The passengers are ready.
- Thanks, Randy.

862
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:52,951
You better leave, sweetheart.
You might get hurt up here.

863
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:05,130
- Ted...
- Yes?

864
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:09,509
I wanted you to know... now...

865
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:12,220
I'm very proud.

866
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:18,309
Tell them the gear is down
and we're ready to land.

867
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:25,066
The gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

868
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:28,570
He's on final now.

869
01:15:28,695 --> 01:15:31,656
Put out all runway lights
except niner.

870
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,245
Captain, maybe we ought
to turn on the searchlights.

871
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,122
No.

872
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:43,335
That's just what they'll
be expecting us to do.

873
01:15:47,964 --> 01:15:52,177
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

874
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:56,056
Now listen carefully.

875
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:58,475
You'll see the runway at 300 feet.

876
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,728
Touch down a third of the way.

877
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:04,314
A slight cross wind, so be ready.

878
01:16:04,397 --> 01:16:07,400
Land too fast,
use your emergency brakes.

879
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:11,321
Red handle's right in front.
If that doesn't stop you...

880
01:16:16,868 --> 01:16:20,663
If that doesn't stop you,
cut the four ignition switches.

881
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:28,672
Can you see us now? You should
be able to see the field.

882
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:39,391
- Sure is quiet out there.
- Yeah, too quiet.

883
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:44,854
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit sniffing glue.

884
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,285
There it is.

885
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:02,080
There he is!

886
01:17:04,624 --> 01:17:06,668
Striker, you're coming in too fast.

887
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:08,545
I know, I know!

888
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,505
He knows, he knows!

889
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:15,677
Below 700 now. Still going down.

890
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:19,597
675, 650, 625, he's holding.

891
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:21,599
No, he's down, he's down.

892
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,727
Sound your alarm now.

893
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:28,398
Now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

894
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,697
Put down 30 degrees of flap.

895
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:42,787
All right, listen to me.
Remember your brakes and switches.

896
01:17:42,912 --> 01:17:44,664
Get ready to flare it out!

897
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:46,875
He's all over the place.

898
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,628
900 up to 1,300 feet.
What an asshole.

899
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:53,465
More left rudder. Put down more flap.

900
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,513
Just kidding!

901
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:04,976
Striker, lift your nose.
Straighten your wings.

902
01:18:05,101 --> 01:18:08,063
Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

903
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:10,440
He's coming right at us!

904
01:18:14,569 --> 01:18:17,947
Coming in too hot.
Ease up on the throttle.

905
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:21,910
Watch out for that cross wind.
Level it out.

906
01:18:21,993 --> 01:18:24,079
You'll have to dip your left wing.

907
01:18:26,581 --> 01:18:30,043
You're drifting. Keep your eyes
on the far end of the runway.

908
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:34,214
You're too low, damn it!

909
01:18:35,965 --> 01:18:37,717
Watch your stall speed.

910
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:42,597
Flare it out!

911
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,310
Ease her down. Down!

912
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:54,734
The brake! Pull the red handle!

913
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:03,493
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

914
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:14,045
Flight 209 now arriving
at gate eight.

915
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:16,339
Gate nine.

916
01:19:16,464 --> 01:19:17,882
Gate ten.

917
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:20,677
Pull out of it! Push that button!

918
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:30,687
Gate 13... Gate 14.

919
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,355
Gate 15...

920
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:45,326
Auntie Em! Toto! It's a twister!

921
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:51,541
Gate 23, 24, 25...

922
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:19,694
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

923
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,617
Striker?

924
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:30,038
- Striker, are you all right?
- Yeah. We're OK.

925
01:20:30,163 --> 01:20:33,208
Ted, that was probably
the lousiest landing

926
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:35,919
in the history of this airport.

927
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:38,088
But some of us, particularly me,

928
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:42,175
would like to buy you a
drink and shake your hand.

929
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:50,308
And, Ted, when the going got rough...

930
01:20:53,144 --> 01:20:55,647
Have a nice day. OK.

931
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:59,109
Have a nice day and thank you
for flying TransAmerican.

932
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:02,654
Loneliness, that's the bottom line.

933
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:04,823
I was never happy as a child.

934
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:07,200
Christmas,
what does that mean to you?

935
01:21:07,325 --> 01:21:09,452
Mine was living hell.

936
01:21:09,577 --> 01:21:12,622
Do you know what it's like
to fall in the mud

937
01:21:12,747 --> 01:21:15,625
and get kicked in the head
by an iron boot?

938
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:18,003
Of course not. It never happens.

939
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:20,380
Sorry. That's a dumb question.
Skip that.

940
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:28,221
There you go. Have a nice day.

941
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:46,448
Municipal bonds, Ted.
Talking double "A" rating.

942
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:49,242
Best investment in America.

943
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:24,828
Well, I'll give him
another 20 minutes, but that's it.
