1
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,332
Fire!
Fire in the hole.

2
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,960
Fire in the hole!

3
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,052
Let's get it, boys.
Always loads easy on payday.

4
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,934
Hi, Daddy. Look at your knee. Daddy,
why don't you wear your knee pad?

5
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,646
Oh, Loretty,
that old shaft's so low,

6
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,649
you wear your knee pads,
you skin your back.

7
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,235
If you don't wear 'em,
you skin your knees.

8
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,404
I'll wear 'em tomorrow
and give my back a turn.

9
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,742
Boys, there ain't no
place this thing can't take me.

10
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,286
There ain't a creek she can't
ford, a gully she can't jump

11
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,579
or a hill she can't climb.

12
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,040
By God, I know a thing
that you can't climb.

13
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,917
That heap of red dog
back yonder.

14
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,752
Oh, hell, buddy,
I can climb that damn mess

15
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,878
in a by-God
New York minute.

16
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,713
Shit!
Hey!

17
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,384
You boys watch your language
in front of these kids.

18
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:03,266
All right, does anybody wanna bet me
I can't climb that mess up there?

19
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,725
That great
pile up there?

20
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,727
Hell, yes, buddy!
I can ride up there at the top...

21
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,313
Oh, I'm sorry, little girl. Excuse me.

22
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,440
Never done.
Can't be done.

23
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,152
I got me $25 that says I can do it.
Does anybody wanna bet me?

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,948
I'll take all bets.

25
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,410
Okay, come on, kids.
Let's get to the store.

26
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,454
Give the company
their money back.

27
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,083
Loretta, come on, honey.

28
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,215
Hi, Ted.
Hey, Carl.

29
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,468
Who's that
soldier boy out there

30
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,470
strutting around
like a banty rooster?

31
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,266
It's old man Red Lynn's
boy. Doolittle.

32
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,977
Come back from the army
acting like a wild heathen.

33
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,857
He'll calm down as soon as they
slap a coal shovel in his hand.

34
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,941
Yeah.

35
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,819
That Sears Roebuck
I ordered come in yet?

36
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,321
Yeah, I'll get it for you.

37
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,073
All right.

38
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,243
Loretty, get you and Herman
a jar of vyannies, honey.

39
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,328
Great!

40
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,012
Get your mule, son.

41
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,598
Hey, Cousin Ted,

42
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,768
come on in here and get in on this bet.
It's a sure thing.

43
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,436
OI' Doolittle will
never get up there

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,521
without rolling over
and killin' himself.

45
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,605
Lord have mercy,
that son of a gun Doolittle

46
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,482
don't know what
quit means, does he?

47
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,234
He sure went to
a lot of trouble

48
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,944
to get on top of
a pile of junk.

49
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,739
Come on, Herman.

50
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,660
Mommy, Daddy's home!

51
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,704
What you got
in that box?

52
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,666
Something special.
Don't open it till we get inside.

53
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,260
Y'all get washed up
before you come in.

54
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,180
Y'all hear your Mama?
Everybody go wash now. Come on.

55
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,150
Lee Dollarhide?

56
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,071
Come on in here, Doo.
I was just about to blast you one.

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,497
Old boy down at the store
said you wanted to see me.

58
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,624
Here, take you a sip.

59
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,129
Okay, fellas.

60
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,507
Donald Ray.

61
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,468
Thanks, Daddy.

62
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,137
Jack, well...
Hand that to brother Jack.

63
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,764
Thank you.

64
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,057
Take the baby, Jack.

65
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,850
How do they feel, gang?

66
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,519
Daddy,
Peggy got two right feet.

67
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,645
What?

68
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,730
I mean, two right shoes.

69
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,358
I'll be darned. Don't worry.
We'll get 'em changed.

70
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,777
How they feel?
Loretta.

71
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,574
Get your hands off. Leave 'em
alone. Leave 'em alone, Donald Ray.

72
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,162
Daddy.

73
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,249
Hey, how come she gets
something extra?

74
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,128
Jack, Loretta's getting to be a woman.
Going on 14.

75
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,422
Women's 'sposed to
have pretty things.

76
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,467
Oh, she ain't no woman.
She ain't nothing but a dad-burned kid.

77
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,970
Well, what are you, Herman?

78
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,904
Remember when
you used to work for me,

79
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,531
sell my goods down at the mine?

80
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,784
Yeah, I remember you used to pay
me a nickel for every jug I sold.

81
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,786
How'd you like to
come back to work for me?

82
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,704
Not for no nickel a jug!

83
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm talking about
real money, Doo.

84
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:44,213
Business is good, you see. I'm selling
more whiskey than I can make.

85
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,132
But I heard you'd
been stealing some

86
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,758
from the boys
over in Greasy Creek.

87
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,844
Oh, just when
I run shy of my own.

88
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,308
I'm fixing to make me another
run on Greasy Creek, Doo.

89
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,353
You got that jeep.

90
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,398
You know how to use a gun
and you can use you a job.

91
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,484
I'll go 50-50 with you.

92
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:13,075
Doo, if you're born in the
mountains, you got three choices,

93
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:19,456
coal mine, moonshine
or moving on down the line.

94
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,297
I'm walkin'
the floor over you

95
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,260
I can't sleep a wink,
that is true

96
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,347
Herman, get your feet off!

97
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,101
Turn the radio off.
We can't afford no new batteries.

98
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,900
You got one of your bad
headaches again, Daddy?

99
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,194
Ted, you want me to mix
you up some medicine?

100
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,571
It don't do no good.
It'll pass.

101
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,240
What you see in
them grounds, Mommy?

102
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,867
Loretty,
take the baby, hon.

103
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,288
I see a woman crying.
Looks to me like a man crying, too.

104
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,998
Who are they?

105
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,834
Loretty.

106
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,213
What are they
crying about, Mommy?

107
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,341
Take the baby out
and rock her, Loretty.

108
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,761
Bad times is a-coming.

109
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,223
Well, we don't need no
fortune-teller to know that.

110
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,477
In the pines, in the pines

111
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,688
Where the sun never shines

112
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,985
And I shiver
when the cold wind blows

113
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,365
The longest train

114
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,368
I ever saw

115
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:42,248
Was on that Georgia line

116
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,377
The purtiest boy

117
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,255
I ever saw

118
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,677
Was on that caboose behind

119
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,887
In the pines...

120
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,583
Good thing you wasn't
still working for him, son.

121
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,002
You'd be laying there
aside him.

122
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,378
I know that, Daddy.

123
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,297
Course if you had have
been working for him,

124
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,882
at least you'd have
been working somewhere.

125
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,273
You're out.

126
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,192
That's all right, sweetheart,
you did fine.

127
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,738
Get up and dance!

128
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,622
Preacher Banks was supposed to be
here to auction off these pies.

129
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,374
And he's sick and I...

130
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,668
I sure can't take no
time to auction no pies.

131
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,046
Besides, if these girls want
to eat pies with a boy,

132
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,964
they'll do it whether
there's an auction or not.

133
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,928
Say, lady, I'll auction
off them pies for you.

134
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,679
You will?
I sure will.

135
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,100
Six bits? Got six bits right there.
Who's gonna bid a dollar?

136
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,267
I will!

137
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,727
All right, now we got
a dollar right here, now.

138
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,314
It's a dollar one time.
Boys, that's a dollar twice.

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,983
That's sold, right there, for a dollar.

140
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,112
Give me that
dollar right there.

141
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,655
Thank you.

142
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,163
All right, you all
got one more pie left.

143
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,457
It's a chocolate pie
here, belong to

144
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,000
Loretta Webb.

145
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,837
Who's gonna bid first?

146
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,339
I bid two bits.

147
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,007
Two bits?
Buddy, that's an insult!

148
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,387
Who's gonna start off with a dollar?
Who'll give me a dollar, now?

149
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,891
I guess I get it, then.

150
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,853
Heck, I'll bid a dollar, buddy.

151
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,063
You're the auctioneer.
You ain't supposed to bid.

152
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,107
Oh, all right, that's a dollar
once, that's a dollar twice...

153
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,358
Hey, a dollar and a dime.

154
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,526
Three dollars.

155
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,112
That ain't fair, he's cheating!

156
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,780
All right,
that's $3 once, $3 twice...

157
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,365
Three and a dime.

158
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,159
$3.75.

159
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,910
$3.77.

160
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,665
$5.

161
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,292
Ooh!

162
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,546
Once, twice, sold to
Mr. Doolittle Lynn for $5.

163
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,220
Play in the
house and play in the sea

164
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,724
And when that
pretty girl turns to me

165
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,352
Swing her high
and swing her low

166
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,231
Swing your partner, do-si-do

167
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,110
Takes that lamb and
takes that squirrel

168
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,572
Takes that pretty
girl round the world

169
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,293
Make a lot of
chocolate pies, Loretta?

170
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,378
Not too many, except this one.

171
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,097
How much salt did
that recipe call for?

172
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,976
You don't put no salt in a chocolate pie.
You just put in sugar and...

173
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,939
Well, you must have got 'em
mixed up, Loretta.

174
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,193
Makes a lot of sense, though.
The salt and sugar's both white.

175
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,626
Well, there ain't no sense in
walking when you can ride. Come on!

176
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,211
I ain't gettin' in that thing.

177
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,421
You ain't never rode
in a car before, have you?

178
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,300
That ain't no car.
Looks like something from Mars.

179
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:50,013
Mars? Gal, what the hell do
you know about Mars anyway?

180
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,891
I'll bet you ain't never been
past the mouth of this hollow.

181
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,603
Come on now, get in this thing.

182
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,523
I said I ain't gettin'
in it and I ain't!

183
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,442
If you like me so much,
you can walk me home.

184
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,948
Oh, Lord, them pies ain't the only
thing salty about you, are they?

185
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,242
Wait a minute! Wait,
we'll walk it, then. Wait!

186
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,540
You know, the first time
I ever seen you I said,

187
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,293
"Me and that little ol' gal's
gonna get together."

188
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,462
I saw you, too,
in that little soldier suit.

189
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,425
I thought you looked just
like a little toy soldier.

190
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,261
Hey, now, you listen here, I went
ashore over yonder at D-day plus four

191
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,471
and I stayed in combat until the
day the damn thing was over.

192
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,765
I wasn't no
little ol' toy soldier.

193
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,103
You know what
D-day is, don't you?

194
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,358
What?
Never mind.

195
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,824
Tell you one thing
that army showed me.

196
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,577
There's a whole
big world out yonder.

197
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,081
Showed me I ain't
about to spend my life

198
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,959
buried in no
coal mine, neither.

199
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,003
Ain't no future in it,
not a damn bit.

200
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,632
And that's what I'm interested in,
mainly, course, is the future.

201
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,842
You got any
plans for the future?

202
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,388
Not that I know of.

203
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,016
You sure cuss a lot, don't ya?

204
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,267
Yeah, I do.

205
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,645
Cuss, drink, chase wild women.

206
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,480
What? What are you doing?

207
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:26,068
I'm gonna kiss you good night.
Ain't you ever been kissed before. Huh?

208
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,252
Hey, Loretta?

209
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,005
I'm gonna bring my jeep up
here and take you for a ride.

210
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,216
You ain't gonna get
that thing up this holler.

211
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,760
There ain't nothing I can't do,
girl, once I set my mind to it.

212
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,478
Loretty, honey, take
Peggy Sue in and feed her.

213
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,147
Come on.

214
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,656
Stranger coming!
Stranger coming!

215
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:20,080
Stranger coming!

216
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,750
What is it?

217
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,882
I told you I'd get
this thing up here, gal.

218
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,676
You gotta take
a ride with me now.

219
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,759
Hey, Bill.

220
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,843
Hey, Doo.

221
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,133
I can't breathe.
I feel like I'm gonna faint.

222
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,385
Well, that's the way you're supposed
to feel when you're in love.

223
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,221
It is?
Yeah.

224
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,412
Where have you been?

225
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,707
Doolittle took me riding.

226
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,084
What?

227
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,627
Doolittle took me riding.

228
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,420
Took you riding?

229
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,174
You just run off.
Didn't ask nobody or nothing.

230
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,386
Run off and worry
everybody to death.

231
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,524
Y'all get to bed.
Go on.

232
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,460
Don't you know he'd
rather cut off his arm

233
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,421
than have to
whip you like that?

234
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,633
What you mean running off
like that with that wild boy?

235
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,969
I love him, Mommy.

236
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,472
You do no such a thing.

237
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,932
Stay away from that
Doolittle Lynn

238
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,351
or I'll give you worse than
what your Daddy did.

239
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,356
I'll go make you up
some salve for your legs.

240
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:18,902
Loretty, you know I don't like to
boss you, but I got to now, honey.

241
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,986
Daddy, I...

242
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,905
Just let me talk.

243
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,199
Doolittle's been up the
house every day this week.

244
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,284
I don't want him
hanging around no more.

245
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,494
Why?

246
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,581
'Cause you ain't got no business
hanging around with him.

247
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,751
You're just a little girl,
he's a grown-up man,

248
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,545
wild as the devil.

249
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,756
I love him, Daddy.

250
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,675
And he's a-wanting me
to marry him.

251
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,721
You ain't even 14 yet.

252
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,850
Y'all ain't knowed
each other a month.

253
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,354
I know. But I love him.

254
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,317
Lord, Lord,
don't do it, Loretty.

255
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,570
Don't throw all
them young years away.

256
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,574
You're my pride, girl.
My shining pride.

257
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,372
I just can't help it.

258
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,000
I can't.

259
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,759
Okay.

260
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,429
Okay.

261
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,600
Presenting
the Grand Ole Opry.

262
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,103
Let her go, boys.

263
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,816
Get up, Mommy.
Do your squaw dance.

264
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,902
See if we can't get a smile
out of old sourpuss here.

265
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,279
Yeah, come on, Mama.

266
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,739
Come on, dance.

267
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,615
Come on, Clary.

268
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,378
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'

269
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,883
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

270
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,803
Blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shinin'

271
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,308
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

272
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:17,854
It was on a moonlit night
The stars shining bright

273
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,275
They whispered from high
Your love said goodbye

274
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,904
Blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shinin'

275
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,990
Shine on the one that's gone...

276
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,827
I knocked, but I reckon
y'all couldn't hear me outside.

277
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,965
Guess I broke up the party.

278
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,342
Oh, it don't matter.

279
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,969
Come on and sit down.

280
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,097
Okay, come on, Donald Ray.

281
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,849
Mmm. Why don't
you try that one?

282
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:55,934
Y'all get out of
here or I'm gonna

283
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,894
knock the tar out
of every one of you.

284
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,270
Why? We're
playing checkers.

285
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,605
Jack, go on.

286
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,690
Say, "Please."
Herman?

287
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,112
Junior, come on,
take 'em out. Please?

288
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,114
Come on, fellas, let's go.

289
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,657
Pretty please.

290
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,870
Look here at this, Loretty.

291
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,207
My gosh, Doo.

292
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,501
Where'd you get all that?

293
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,545
Mess of paychecks.
I've been saving 'em.

294
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,464
You know what tomorrow is?
It's our anniversary.

295
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,260
Get a little closer.

296
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,720
Herman, I'm gonna kill you!

297
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,892
What were you saying, Doo?

298
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,645
I was saying that tomorrow
is our anniversary.

299
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,940
I figured that'd be a good day
for you and me to get married,

300
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,651
especially since
I got all that money.

301
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,909
Go ask Daddy.

302
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,508
Mr. Webb,
me and Loretta

303
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,303
is fixing to get married
if it's all right with you.

304
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,930
Tomorrow.

305
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,982
Go ask Clary.

306
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,998
Mrs. Webb, uh, me...

307
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:47,295
Me and Loretty was thinking
about getting married.

308
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,963
Tomorrow.

309
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,427
Go ask Ted.

310
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,317
Where's lover boy?

311
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,279
Doolittle, what are you doing?

312
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:17,825
Hell, Ted said to ask Clary and Clary
said to ask Ted and... I don't know.

313
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,286
Come on and sit down.

314
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,874
Wait'll they go to bed, then
you can catch them together,

315
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,669
else they'll keep you running
back and forth all night long.

316
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,673
Mr. And Mrs. Webb?

317
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,472
I know everything's
happened real fast.

318
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,183
I know she's young, I know
how much y'all love her,

319
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:48,189
but the deal is
I love her, too.

320
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,733
Just as much as you do.

321
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:56,030
I growed up real fast,
I seen a lot of the world.

322
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,824
I want you to know
first time I seen that girl

323
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,743
I said, "That's all I'm ever
gonna want out of life."

324
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,413
And I promise you

325
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,583
I'm gonna break my back
working to make her happy.

326
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,922
I reckon y'all set on it
no matter what we say.

327
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,967
I don't wanna go
against y'all, Mrs. Webb,

328
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,427
but, yes, I'm really set on it.

329
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,310
Two things I want
you to promise me, boy.

330
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,521
Don't you never hit her

331
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,399
and don't take her off
far away from home.

332
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:36,070
Yes, sir.
I promise you that.

333
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,851
Wilt thou love her,
comfort her,

334
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,978
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health

335
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,647
and forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto her

336
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,649
so long as you both shall live?

337
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,151
I will.

338
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,196
And, Loretta, wilt thou have this
man to be thy wedded husband,

339
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,157
to live together in the
holy estate of matrimony?

340
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,242
Wilt thou love him,
comfort him,

341
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,203
honor and keep him
in sickness and in health

342
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,122
and forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto him

343
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,957
so long as you both shall live?

344
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,043
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I will.

345
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,296
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

346
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,884
I do.

347
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,969
Please join right hands.

348
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,350
The wedding ring is
an outward and visible sign

349
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,227
of an inward
and spiritual grace

350
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,396
signifying unto all the uniting

351
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,481
of this man and this
woman in holy matrimony.

352
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,110
Do you two have rings?

353
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,986
I ain't got
no ring, Judge.

354
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,965
She'll warm up here
in just a minute.

355
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,259
I got a present
for you from Mama.

356
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,876
Well, go on, get ready
for bed, baby, come on.

357
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,371
Loretta, you ain't supposed to wear
a nightgown over your clothes.

358
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,998
I'm freezing, Doo.

359
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:40,463
Get on in there and take off
everything, but your nightgown now.

360
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,507
Go on, Loretty.

361
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,175
Go on!

362
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,260
Move. Go on, now.

363
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,057
Get off.

364
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,269
Don't do that.
Don't! Doo, no!

365
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,230
It's just a little rough the
first time, Loretty, is all.

366
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,399
Don't worry about that.
Come on, baby.

367
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,276
Don't, Doo. No!

368
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,610
Hush, Loretty.

369
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:45,861
No, Doo!

370
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,822
No! No.

371
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,440
This stuff's cold.

372
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,360
It's because it froze between
here and the damn restaurant.

373
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,696
You want a hot breakfast,
you got to go with me.

374
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,656
I ain't going in there having
all them people looking at me

375
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,783
knowing what we've
been doing in here.

376
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,621
Hell's bells, Loretta, do
you think this is something

377
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,372
the rest of the world
ain't caught on to yet?

378
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,999
They don't give a damn.

379
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,712
Baby, it's just a little rough
the first time, that's all.

380
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,380
Didn't seem too rough on you.

381
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,757
Well, you better get
used to it, darling,

382
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,300
because that's what
a damn marriage...

383
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:54,096
I ain't gonna get used to you getting
on me and sweating like an old pig!

384
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,895
You told Daddy you wouldn't hit
me and look at you already.

385
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,565
Well, hell, I'm sorry, Loretta,
but you drove me to it!

386
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,556
Hi, hon.

387
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,359
Look here at this. These
radios are on sale real cheap.

388
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,569
You reckon we could get us one?

389
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,331
Here, you read that.
Then we'll talk radios.

390
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,878
My gosh, Doo, this has
got pictures in it.

391
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,719
Ugh!

392
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,892
Here, dog.

393
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,242
Oh, Loretty, that there book,

394
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,498
that thing's helped millions
of people the world over.

395
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,959
I thought it might
do us a little good.

396
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,589
I can't read this book, Doo. It's got
all 'em great big ol' words in it.

397
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,300
Look at this one. Look.

398
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,219
That dadgum word
is a foot long.

399
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,872
Now, what's a foot-long
word supposed to mean, huh?

400
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,358
Oh, Doo, I don't need no book
to tell me what's wrong.

401
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,694
You just need to be
a little more patient

402
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,571
and gentle with me,
honey, that's all.

403
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,366
I just need a little more time.

404
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,162
Give you a little more time.

405
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,122
Well, let me add up
all these damn things

406
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,624
I'm supposed to give
you some more time on.

407
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,709
You need a little more time
to learn how to cook.

408
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,755
You need a little more time to
learn how to clean the damn house.

409
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,258
Plus you need
a little more time to learn

410
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,843
how to love your man
the way you're supposed to.

411
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,513
Goddamn, is there anything that
you know how to do right now?

412
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,393
Doo, when you gonna get me
that wedding ring?

413
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,941
Stop making that noise.
You sound like an old bear growling.

414
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,695
Where are you going?
Doo, are you leaving?

415
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,164
No, I ain't leaving.

416
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,754
Mommy,
look who's here! Loretta!

417
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,758
Hi. Hi, Peggy.

418
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,510
Hi, Donald.

419
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,847
Look who's here, Dad!

420
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,934
Hi, Mommy.
Doo's thrown me out, Mommy.

421
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,603
Oh, thank the Lord.
Maybe it ain't too late

422
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,522
to save you from
ruining your life.

423
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,773
Loretty, you home!

424
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,024
Hi, Daddy.

425
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,150
Mmm!

426
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,237
I believe married life's
making you fat, girl.

427
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,032
Oh, no.

428
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,286
F, O, D...

429
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,204
Ready, Loretta?

430
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,625
The last time I seen you

431
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,669
I was giving you kids
a shot for the measles.

432
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,630
Here you are an old married woman.
How do you like it?

433
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,465
Fine.

434
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,679
Except me and Doo is separated.

435
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,893
Things happen pretty fast between
you and Doo, don't they?

436
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,667
Hey!

437
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,170
Hold up there.

438
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,882
Hey, Doolittle, how are you?

439
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,634
Good day, isn't it?

440
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,843
It sure is.

441
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,428
What have you been doing?

442
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:48,223
No, not a hell of a lot. Working
too goddamn hard. What about you?

443
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,225
Hey, Doolittle Lynn.

444
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,479
Who's that sow
wallowing in your jeep?

445
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,022
What did you call me?

446
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,566
A sow.
That's a woman pig.

447
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,160
Hi, Loretta, I just...

448
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,245
Hey, Loretta!

449
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,462
Hey, Loretta!
I was just fixing to come see you.

450
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,130
Was you gonna bring
your girlfriend with you?

451
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,299
Oh, hell, that don't mean nothing.
She just flagged me down.

452
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,634
I got something
to tell you, girl.

453
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,844
Yeah, I got something
to tell you, too.

454
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,057
Loretta, I am leaving Kentucky.

455
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,935
I'm going out west
to Washington

456
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,269
to get me a job on
a ranch or something.

457
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,147
That damned ol' coal mine's
got me buried alive.

458
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:39,733
Was you just gonna leave me?

459
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,694
Just long enough to get the
money to send for you.

460
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,487
What makes you think I'd come?

461
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,947
'Cause you're my wife, darling.

462
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,951
I'm your wife! Boy, you better think
of a better reason than that.

463
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,746
There ain't nothing for me
in Kentucky, Loretta.

464
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,498
Except a chest
full of coal dust

465
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,417
and being an old man
time I'm 40.

466
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,920
You ask your daddy.

467
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,923
'Sides that, you got to
come with me, I love you.

468
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,511
You promised Daddy you wouldn't
take me off far from home.

469
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,847
Well, you just have to
make up your mind, darling,

470
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,599
whether or not you're
his daughter or my wife.

471
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,147
Get in. I'll take
you back to the house.

472
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,360
What are you doing
in the bottom anyhow?

473
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,904
I come to see Doc Turner.

474
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,823
You sick?

475
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,117
Yeah, I'm gonna have a baby.

476
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,664
Oh, Lord, Loretta.

477
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,959
You know, darlin', you
might have found something

478
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,794
that you know how to do.

479
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,072
It's from Doo, Daddy!

480
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,741
He sent me the money
to come to Washington.

481
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:28,425
Well, she's late. Reckon she
might have jumped the tracks.

482
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,930
Oh, Daddy, them things don't do that.
Do they?

483
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,350
They've been known to.

484
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,188
Get up here.
Let's see what you weigh.

485
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,031
117?

486
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:54,868
Boy, Daddy, this baby's gonna be a
big one, ain't it? You weigh now.

487
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,371
It wouldn't do no good.

488
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,164
I wouldn't know
how much was me,

489
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,375
how much was all that
coal dust I swallowed.

490
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,679
I ain't never
gonna see you again.

491
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,390
Yes, you will, Daddy.

492
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,061
Maybe. But I ain't never gonna
see my little girl again.

493
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,358
Them years has
been robbed from me,

494
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,861
like a thief broke in
and robbed 'em.

495
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,464
As I listen to the words

496
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,218
You are saying

497
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,346
It brings memories

498
00:41:56,431 --> 00:42:01,935
When I was a trusting wife

499
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,314
It wasn't God

500
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:09,860
Who made honky tonk angels...

501
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,612
Thank you, Betty Sue.

502
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,741
As you said in the words

503
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,827
Of your song

504
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,289
Ernest Ray, your daddy
is gonna wear you out

505
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,415
when he gets home.

506
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,794
...married men
think they're still single

507
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,386
Y'all scared of the rain?
You ain't gonna melt.

508
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,305
Let's go to work, boys.

509
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,294
Come here, boy. Come here.
Come here, my little...

510
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,647
Daddy, Daddy!

511
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,357
How you doing, Bo?

512
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:52,736
Hello, darlin'.
Come here, baby.

513
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,032
What did you do all day, baby?

514
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,118
Well, I put up 17 quarts
of this apple butter.

515
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,704
And, Doo,
the dadgum sink stopped up.

516
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,165
And I spent half
the morning fixing that.

517
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,670
Jack Benny, stop kicking
him under the table.

518
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,255
Do you hear me?

519
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,757
And then I had that
doctor's appointment.

520
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,009
He said it was a false alarm.

521
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,136
We'd better be a whole lot
more careful next time.

522
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,681
Let's cover your
mouth when you're coughing.

523
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,809
And then I come home.

524
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,352
Eat, boy.

525
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,688
Betty Sue, you are
not leaving this table

526
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,439
till you finish that,
do you hear me?

527
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,732
You were eating all day.
Sit up there.

528
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,276
Sit up. Come here.

529
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,403
Then I come home
and cooked supper.

530
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,196
And I'm about ready to die.

531
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,824
How was your day?
Wet.

532
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:45,956
Hey, Mooney!

533
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,082
Yo!

534
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,544
Your mama called long
distance from Kentucky today,

535
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,881
said happy anniversary and said why
don't you call her more often.

536
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,592
Much obliged.

537
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,305
Why don't you have a phone
put in sometime, Mooney?

538
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,557
Really don't like telephones.

539
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,897
The captain,
he must have been drinkin'

540
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,901
For he knew that
he had done wrong

541
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,823
He was trying to win the record

542
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,952
When he let the Titanic go down

543
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,665
The children were cryin',
"Dear Mother"

544
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,462
Dear Mother has gone to stay

545
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,424
But maybe it'll
turn to somethin'...

546
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,301
Close your eyes, Cissy.

547
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:43,180
...that'll raise
the Titanic some day

548
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,559
Do-do di-do-do do-do-do...

549
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:55,442
Baby, I was just thinking,
we got an anniversary coming up,

550
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,112
I was wondering what kind of
anniversary present you wanted.

551
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,242
Well, I ain't got
no wedding ring yet.

552
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:07,788
Wedding ring? Bullshit.

553
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,623
Oh, bullshit!

554
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,792
Doo! Jack Benny!

555
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,754
Now, go to sleep, Ernest Ray.
You, too, Jack Benny.

556
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,151
Happy anniversary, darlin'.

557
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,489
Yeah, it looks like
you had a happy one.

558
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:48,286
You know, Doo, most couples spend
their anniversary together.

559
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:51,081
What's that?

560
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,376
That's your anniversary present, baby.
Happy anniversary.

561
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,254
My anniversary present?
Mmm-hmm.

562
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,257
Doo, sometimes I think you got a
washer missing in your brain.

563
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,842
I can't play that thing.

564
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,637
Most people can't without
they learn how first.

565
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,849
You're not too
ignorant to learn, are you?

566
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,810
Hell, if you don't want it,
I'll give it to the kids.

567
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,936
They probably
don't want it either,

568
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,396
so I'll put it in
the kindling box.

569
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,898
Give me that.

570
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,201
What you get me a guitar for?

571
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,537
'Cause I like the way you sing.

572
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,002
Do you really
think I sing good?

573
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,087
Baby, I know you do.

574
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,383
Can I have a present, too?

575
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:51,308
Have I told you
lately that I love you?

576
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,898
Have I...
Could I tell you once again

577
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,359
Somehow?

578
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,656
If you boys knock Cissy off
of this porch one more time,

579
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,950
I'll have to whup you.

580
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,660
That's right.

581
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,580
No, no

582
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,919
With all my

583
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:24,925
Heart and soul how I adore you

584
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,012
Well, darlin',
I'm tellin' you now

585
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,182
You boys stop fighting
and listen to me sing.

586
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:38,313
This heart would break
in two if you refuse me

587
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:44,194
I'm no good without you anyhow

588
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,866
Dear, have I told you
lately that I love you?

589
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,622
Well, darlin',
I'm tellin' you now

590
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,666
Hey, darling,
how about Saturday night

591
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,585
let's get us one
of them babysitters

592
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,504
and go honky-tonkin'?

593
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,713
You mean together?

594
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,090
Yeah,  Together.

595
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,341
Okay.

596
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,766
What are you grinning about?

597
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,144
Doo!

598
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,106
What are you up to?

599
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,609
My Lord.

600
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:42,377
I'll have one of them beers,
please, plus one Coca-Cola.

601
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,260
How about a dance, darling?

602
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,178
I can't. I'm married.

603
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,682
You must not be too married,
you ain't wearing no ring.

604
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,520
I bet I know what
this is all about.

605
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,731
Oh, dang, you guessed it.

606
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,191
Wait right here,
I'll be right back.

607
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,450
Hey, buddy!
Hey, buddy, come here.

608
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,621
I got something sitting right
on back there at that table...

609
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,212
Come here, darling.
Come here, honey.

610
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,928
I'll be right with you, Hoss.

611
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,266
Excuse me.

612
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,648
Loretta!

613
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,902
What the hell are you doing
running off and hiding like a...

614
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,113
Don't make me get up and sing, Doo.
Please, I'm sick.

615
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,449
Oh, hell, you're not gonna
have to get up there and sing.

616
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,159
That ol' boy wouldn't allow it.
Thank the Lord.

617
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,744
You're gonna have to audition
for 'em in the morning.

618
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,455
I ain't no singer, Doo.
I can't sing for no strangers.

619
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,165
Yes, you can.
I done fixed it up for you.

620
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,167
There ain't no problem.
You didn't ask me nothing about it!

621
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,752
How the hell can I ask you
something about it

622
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,837
if you run off and hide
like a stupid hillbilly?

623
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:11,508
Don't call me that. I may be
ignorant, but I ain't stupid.

624
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,718
Why do you want me to sing
so much for anyway?

625
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,345
'Cause I'm proud of
you when you sing.

626
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,517
Doo, I'm glad I
make you proud, honey,

627
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,895
but I can't sing in front
of people. I just can't.

628
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,272
Yes, you can, baby.

629
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,651
You're gonna sing for these old
boys in here in the morning,

630
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,528
and next week you're gonna
be up on that stage

631
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,196
singing for
all these people here,

632
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,448
if I have to kick your

633
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,243
ignorant hillbilly ass
every step of the way!

634
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,335
And now, folks, we've got
a special treat for you.

635
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,879
Making her very
first public appearance,

636
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,924
please welcome The Westerneers'
new girl singer,

637
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,468
Miss Loretta Lynn!

638
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:26,040
There he goes

639
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:30,211
He's walkin' away

640
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,674
And each step he takes

641
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,803
Brings heartache my way

642
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,559
She's won his heart

643
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,189
I lost him someway

644
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,194
There he goes

645
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:58,740
He's walkin' away

646
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,747
Oh, if I hadn't cheated

647
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,709
And if I hadn't lied

648
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,548
I'd be the one

649
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:19,219
Who's walkin' by his side

650
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,388
I love him still

651
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,477
And I guess it shows

652
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:32,106
The way that I feel

653
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,569
As there he goes

654
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:43,618
Oh, if I hadn't cheated

655
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:47,914
And if I hadn't lied

656
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:54,128
I'd be the one

657
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,507
Who's walkin' by his side

658
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,510
I love him still

659
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,765
And I guess it shows

660
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:10,562
The way that I feel

661
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:16,025
As there he goes

662
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,373
Darling,
you were good.

663
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,708
You got a big voice.

664
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,793
How'd you
like that, folks?

665
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,212
Would you like to hear the
little lady sing another one?

666
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,547
Doo, they liked me!

667
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,840
Yeah, baby, they loved you.
They loved you.

668
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,550
They gonna love you
a hell of a lot more

669
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,176
if you get up there
and do another one, honey.

670
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,804
Go on, do another one.
Go on.

671
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:50,727
So fill my glass up to the top

672
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:53,813
...star

673
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,651
So fill my glass up to the rim

674
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,116
...him

675
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:09,287
I've lost
everything in this world

676
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,750
And now I'm a honky tonk girl

677
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:17,045
I done wrote myself a song,
Betty Sue.

678
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,255
Your mama's
a dadgum songwriter.

679
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,465
It's a nice song, Mommy.

680
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,633
Thank you.

681
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,345
Deal is, Loretta, you can sing
in every little honky tonk in the country.

682
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,554
There's thousands doing it

683
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,264
and they ain't getting
nowhere and they never will.

684
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,225
The thing that's gonna give you the
edge is getting yourself a record.

685
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,144
And the next step's even
more important than that

686
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,104
and that's getting people to
play the dad-burned thing,

687
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:38,524
but right now what you and
me have to worry about...

688
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,776
Listen to your daddy.

689
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,570
...is you making the best
doggone record you can,

690
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,447
it all depends on that,
darling.

691
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,950
Boy, Doo,
I didn't know you knew

692
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,326
so much about
the music business.

693
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,203
I don't. I'm just figuring
it out as I go along,

694
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,038
listening to people talk.

695
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,249
It's just got three chords.

696
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,591
All right, honey, what are
you gonna sing for us?

697
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:07,637
She's gonna do a song that she wrote
herself called Honky Tonk Girl.

698
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,223
Right.
Honey, what key's it in?

699
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,141
Y'all just go right
ahead and play along,

700
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,977
and she'll
follow you just fine.

701
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,270
Go ahead and y'all just play.

702
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,897
She does talk,
don't she, partner?

703
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,942
I mean, generally people
that can sing can talk.

704
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,318
Oh, she'll talk up a storm
if she feels like it.

705
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,653
All right.

706
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,780
Y'all settle down
here now and be quiet.

707
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,740
Darling, come over here
and sit on my knee.

708
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,244
You'll have a lot better view, boys.
Sit up here, now.

709
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,704
Sit up big and
listen to your mama.

710
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:36,082
All right, tape is rolling, we're ready.
Let's go for take one.

711
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,002
Three, four, one.

712
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,184
That's all right, that's all right,
don't worry. We got a lot of tape.

713
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,854
All right, you all, get ready and
set, and we'll go for take two.

714
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,063
Buddy, could you give
us a minute, please?

715
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,231
Well, sure.

716
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,109
Kids, come along with me.
Come here.

717
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,653
I guess we're
leaving now, so...

718
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,905
Hey,
put that thing back on.

719
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,824
What are you doing in
here with them kids?

720
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,244
Doo? What are you doing?

721
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,247
Darling, I want you to
sing to these babies.

722
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,582
Sing to the babies?

723
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,125
Yes, just like you was at home.

724
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,252
I'll sit there in
that green chair.

725
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,962
Okay.

726
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,380
Are you sure?

727
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,590
I'm positive.

728
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:42,648
Ever since you left
me I've done nothin' but wrong

729
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:48,488
Many nights
I've laid awake and cried

730
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:52,909
All right, hold it, everybody.
Just hang on a minute.

731
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:56,621
Let's take a little break and let me
see if I can find a few more pickers.

732
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,122
Man, I can't afford
no more pickers.

733
00:56:58,207 --> 00:56:59,749
I done spent every
last penny I had.

734
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,876
As bad as them two are,
what do you want more for?

735
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,089
No, no, I mean more better.
That little lady sings her hind end off.

736
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:15,431
Ever since you left
me I've done nothin' but wrong

737
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:21,020
Many nights
I've laid awake and cried

738
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:29,278
We were so happy
my heart was in a whirl

739
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,032
Let's go, darlin'. Let's do this
thing now, I ain't got all day.

740
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,827
Wait a minute, I ain't got all
these doodads sewed on yet.

741
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,537
Baby, I got to get to work.
Come on, now.

742
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,871
Okay.

743
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,457
It's just gonna be your
head and shoulders anyhow.

744
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,543
Get up there in
front of the backdrop.

745
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,461
You mean that bedspread?
Yeah.

746
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,964
Oh, wait a minute, Doo!
I ought to put on some lipstick.

747
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,967
Get back in here. I like you better
natural. Forget the lipstick.

748
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,385
Slip's all rotten.

749
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,719
Sit down there.

750
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,180
Get up on the back
of the chair, babe.

751
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,390
Up on the back of the chair?

752
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,724
Yeah.

753
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,691
Oh, that's gonna be pretty.
That's gonna be pretty.

754
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,484
I don't want you ever
wearing no lipstick,

755
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,945
or makeup or none of
that junk, I don't like it.

756
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,697
It ain't right.

757
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,324
All right, here we go now.

758
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,576
Where do you want me to look?

759
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,578
- I want you to look at heaven, baby.
- Mama.

760
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,872
Get out of there, sweetheart, I'm
trying to take your mama's picture.

761
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,040
Get over there
and sit down now.

762
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,835
Thank you, baby.

763
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,336
Smile.

764
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,462
Oh...

765
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:32,049
Beautiful. That's just beautiful.
That's it, babe.

766
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,179
Put the backdrop
back on the bed.

767
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,431
Are you and Daddy going out
again tonight, Mama?

768
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,516
Yes, honey, I've got
to sing over in Lynden.

769
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:41,726
Can I go with you?

770
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,813
Oh, no, that's a rough old honky tonk.
You can't be going over there.

771
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,014
Did you stay up all
night again, honey?

772
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,350
Yeah, darling,
I'll get me a nap later on.

773
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:23,768
Well, let me fix
you some breakfast.

774
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,394
No, I'll get me
a bite later on, baby.

775
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,313
I got to go now.
You be ready when I get home.

776
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,856
We gotta drive
all the way to Spokane.

777
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,274
Okay. Bye-bye.

778
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,653
Where's my egg, Mommy?

779
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,739
I'm cooking it as fast
as I can, darling.

780
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,075
Loretty!

781
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,618
Loretty.

782
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,169
Loretty!

783
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,715
Loretty!

784
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:02,473
Long distance!
Your ma's calling from Kentucky!

785
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,184
Emergency, she said.

786
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,314
Amazing grace,
how sweet it sounds.

787
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:16,862
Amazing grace

788
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:23,452
How sweet it sounds

789
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,913
That saved
a wretch like me.

790
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:32,586
That saved a wretch

791
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:36,048
like me

792
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,302
I once was lost,
but now I'm found.

793
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,807
He come to me, Mommy,
when he died.

794
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,312
I seen him just as plain.

795
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,648
You know, he wanted to be with
you and them grand-young'uns.

796
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,067
Was blind
but now I see.

797
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:58,070
Mommy, I shouldn't have left.

798
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,999
I don't guess he ever got over me
taking her off from home, Doc.

799
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,586
You did the right thing,
Doo, leaving here.

800
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:18,674
Well, anyhow, it's over
and done now, I reckon.

801
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:25,264
No, it ain't, Doc,
it ain't never gonna be over.

802
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:33,439
We have already come

803
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:59,715
Finished widening that trail.

804
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,968
It ain't gonna be so hard
to get up here next time.

805
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,237
Loretta, this ol' mountain top

806
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,072
is gonna be covered in
wildflowers in six weeks' time,

807
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,574
what the hell are you doing
bringing plastic ones up here?

808
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,911
Because they don't die.
The real ones just die.

809
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,873
Darlin'...
Like everything else.

810
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,503
Mommy's moving away,
Daddy's gone.

811
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,507
I ain't gonna
have no home left.

812
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,676
You got our home.

813
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,513
Baby.

814
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,640
Get away from me!

815
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:55,146
Leave me alone.

816
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,938
Loretta, we gotta
decide something.

817
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,069
Most of them radio stations that
we sent records and pictures to

818
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,113
is right here in
this part of the country.

819
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,325
If we're really
gonna do this thing,

820
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:53,120
we gotta go see 'em in person and
make sure they play that record.

821
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:57,208
I already talked to your mama and she
said she'd watch the kids for us.

822
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,588
We gotta move right now,
you understand?

823
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,176
Darlin', if you don't want it,

824
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,969
I ain't gonna make you
do nothing you don't wanna do.

825
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,596
It's your choice.

826
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:16,143
We'll just go back to what
we was doing, that's all.

827
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,565
I want it.
What?

828
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,609
I said I want it!

829
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,945
Baby, I can't hear you!

830
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,073
I wanna be a singer, Doo!

831
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,158
I want it real bad.

832
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,246
I want it real bad.

833
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:39,583
Jack, you see that little
row of numbers right there?

834
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,795
That tells you how many miles you've
gone, and tell us how far we've been

835
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,171
when we get back here.

836
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,674
I love you. I'll see you
when we come home.

837
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:47,967
Go with Grandma.
Come on, girl.

838
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,218
Mommy, I love you.

839
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,469
I love you.

840
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:54,431
Betty Sue, you take care
of the little ones, okay?

841
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,101
Will you mind Grandma? Okay?

842
01:04:57,185 --> 01:05:00,145
Bye, Jack!
Bye, Ernest Ray! Bye-bye.

843
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,900
I left y'all some Tootsie Rolls

844
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,570
in the top drawer, Mommy,
in the bedroom!

845
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,613
Bye-bye!
Bye, Mommy!

846
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,156
Bye, Mommy!

847
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,200
Come back, Mommy!

848
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,835
Now here's that number
one hit, Walkin' After Midnight.

849
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,336
Patsy Cline.

850
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,422
That's right, that's WCBL.

851
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,674
Disc jockey name of Bobby Day.

852
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,427
Keep your eyes open for the
transmitter, honey, it's right up here.

853
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,929
The what? Oh.
The transmitter.

854
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:38,517
I'm always walkin' after midnight

855
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:42,229
Searching for you

856
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:49,236
I walked for miles
along the highway

857
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,532
Well, that's just my way

858
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:02,291
Dadgummit, Doo, wait a minute!
People can see in here.

859
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,751
Hurry up, let's go.

860
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,085
What am I supposed
to say when we get in there?

861
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,295
I don't know what to say.

862
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,382
Don't even think about what you're
supposed to say, just start talking.

863
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,028
Hey, I'm sorry, folks, there's no
visitors allowed in the studio.

864
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:34,406
Uh... Hi, Bobby.
My name's Loretta Lynn

865
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:39,286
and I sent you a picture and my
newest record on the Zero label.

866
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,247
Hey, look, no kidding, you can't be
in here while I'm doing a show, okay?

867
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:46,168
It's a song I wrote myself,
it's called Honky Tonk Girl.

868
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:47,628
I got the idea...

869
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,630
I got it and I played it

870
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,465
and it just sorta
laid right there.

871
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,552
So thanks for coming in, you all.
Bye-bye, now. Bye-bye.

872
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,055
Bye-bye.

873
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:02,017
You're listening to Tri-State
Country with your DJ, Bobby Day

874
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:04,144
right here till 6:00,
neighbors.

875
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:07,940
And now here's a word from our
friends down at Hutchins' Hot Pigs.

876
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,652
Tell them all about it, Hutch,
and all of them little piglets.

877
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:15,447
You played it, huh? You ain't
even took it out of the wrapper.

878
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,741
Do you know how many
do-it-yourself records

879
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,118
I get in here every day?

880
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,370
If I played all of 'em, I wouldn't
have time to play anything else.

881
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,414
Well, why did you lie to us?
Huh?

882
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,416
Why'd you say
they didn't like us?

883
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,376
Doo worked so hard
to get us this record!

884
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,295
Hey, buddy, get her out of here.
I gotta go back on the air.

885
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:31,922
I'm sorry, buddy,
there's nothing I can do

886
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,299
once she gets
cranked up like this.

887
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,635
He took the picture, too.

888
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,555
Heck, we got four babies we had
to leave home with my mommy.

889
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:43,100
We drove all the way here,
spent every last dime we had.

890
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:46,019
Folks, we got a special treat
for you here today,

891
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:49,022
a young lady who I predict
is gonna go all the way.

892
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:51,567
I can't believe it!
I can't believe

893
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,610
you'd do something
so dadgum mean as that!

894
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,112
Tell them
all about yourself, darling.

895
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,530
About myself?

896
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:06,081
And then I sung it
for Doolittle. That's my husband.

897
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,958
Except everybody else calls
him Mooney on account of

898
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,586
he used to sell moonshine
back in Butcher Holler.

899
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,087
Where?
Butcher Holler,

900
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:14,757
that where me and Doo's
from back in Kentucky.

901
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,551
Anyway, I wrote the song
and Doo heard it,

902
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,970
and he said, "That's about the
prettiest song as I ever heard,

903
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,347
"good as Patsy Cline."

904
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,767
I said, "Oh, ain't nobody
sings as good as Patsy."

905
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:29,021
Well, let's get a listen to it,
folks, brand-new on the Zero label,

906
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,981
Miss Lorene Lynn singing...
What?

907
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,108
...Honky Tonk Girl.

908
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,778
It's Loretta Lynn, not Lorene.

909
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,529
Loretta?
Uh-huh.

910
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:47,956
Girl, you sure got
over being bashful fast.

911
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:52,211
I just done what you said, just
opened my mouth and out it come.

912
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,670
I couldn't even stop.

913
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:55,172
I didn't have no more notion of

914
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,757
what I was gonna
say than a rabbit.

915
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,634
You keep on being
a rabbit then, darlin'.

916
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:00,302
Hey, where is the next one?

917
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,262
You want me to watch for
that next transmitter?

918
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:05,057
Hell, yes, watch out
for that transmitter.

919
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:10,562
We were so happy my heart was in a...

920
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,566
WTMT, the voice
of country in Hazard, Kentucky.

921
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,152
We've been seeing all
different parts of the country

922
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,154
and meeting all kinds of people

923
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,198
and Doolittle, he's driving...

924
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,158
WMIT in Middlesboro...

925
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,744
Mama's back in Kentucky
taking care of the four babies.

926
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,830
Bet they're wondering what's
happened to their mama.

927
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,332
Top Ridge, Tennessee...

928
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,125
I had no idea where
singers got songs to sing,

929
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,503
so I thought, "Shoot.
I better just lock myself up in it,

930
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,589
"at least till I get this
music business figured out."

931
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,847
Come fast through the mail

932
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:48,600
with a satisfied mind...

933
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,855
Doo, can we send the kids
some suckers or something?

934
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,315
No, baby, we can't afford it.
We ain't got the money.

935
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,526
Here's your baloney, 48 cents.

936
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,862
I'm getting so sick of baloney.

937
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,948
You are? Well, you know what they
say about baloney now, don't you?

938
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,032
What?

939
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,410
Makes you horny.

940
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,328
What's that mean?

941
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,539
Are you so
dad-burned ignorant,

942
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,291
you don't know
what horny means?

943
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,917
No. What does it mean?

944
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,460
Ain't gonna tell you.

945
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,421
Doo!

946
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,257
Doo, what does it mean?

947
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:26,179
With all these months on
the road have you hit Nashville yet?

948
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:27,973
No, sir,
but I'm dying to.

949
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,268
I'm gonna get on the Grand Ole
Opry, too, just as soon as I can.

950
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,395
Well, you know,
sometimes you gotta pay

951
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,564
a lot of dues to
get on the Opry.

952
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,149
Pay dues?

953
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:40,193
Well, for most people it takes
years and years of hard work.

954
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,905
Still,
from the looks of things,

955
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,948
you're off to
a real good start.

956
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,867
Shoot.
We've been driving so much

957
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,827
I don't even know
where I am half the time.

958
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,748
Oh, it's fun, though, you
know, we sing and talk

959
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,958
and Doo, that's my husband,

960
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,710
he'll get to acting horny.
What?

961
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,629
The more I laugh
the hornier he gets.

962
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,464
Loretta, goddamn!

963
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,174
He'll say,
"Loretta, spread me up

964
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,759
"one of them
baloney sandwiches!"

965
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:07,262
I don't know where in the
hell you think you are, lady,

966
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:10,223
but that kind of smut don't go
on in this part of the country.

967
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,850
I didn't know it was dirty.

968
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,436
I thought horny meant cutting
up and acting silly.

969
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,688
Come off that
dumb hillbilly act.

970
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:17,898
You know, mister,
if you knew Loretta,

971
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:18,982
you'd know that ain't no act.

972
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:20,067
Thank you, Doo.

973
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,526
Yeah, well, let me
tell you something.

974
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,696
We're gonna be damn lucky not to
lose our FCC license for this.

975
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,698
And I mean damn lucky!

976
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,785
You know, I'm gonna tell
you something else,

977
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:33,455
I ain't never playing another record
of yours on this radio station! Never!

978
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:34,873
Goddamn, Loretta.
Don't you ever stop to think

979
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,166
what the hell you're saying?

980
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,834
You told me not to!

981
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:39,461
Wait up!

982
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,046
Don't worry about him, kids.

983
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,298
If you're on the charts,
you're gonna get played.

984
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:44,800
What charts?

985
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:48,178
You got a hit record.
You don't know that?

986
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,682
That really
isn't an act, is it?

987
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:54,601
Look here, Cash Box magazine,
came out today.

988
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,396
You're number 14 nationwide.

989
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,565
You really didn't know.

990
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,989
Thank you. Doo!

991
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:14,913
I love you, Doo.

992
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,290
For the girl
with roses on her pillow,

993
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:21,169
here's Patsy Cline's
number one hit, Crazy.

994
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,046
Crazy

995
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:29,928
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely

996
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,144
I'm crazy

997
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:43,775
Crazy for feeling so blue

998
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,115
I knew

999
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:54,286
You'd love me as long...

1000
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,042
Doolittle?

1001
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,548
Doo? Doo?

1002
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,823
That old building sure would
hold a lot of hay, wouldn't it?

1003
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,034
This is the
Grand Ole Opry.

1004
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,368
You want chocolate or glazed?

1005
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,954
The Grand Ole Opry!

1006
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,748
What if they won't let me in?

1007
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:43,376
They'd better let us in, I done spent
all the money on these donuts.

1008
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,004
Besides that, how are
they gonna keep us out?

1009
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:51,510
We're number 14!
Nationwide.

1010
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:00,185
I'm walkin'
the floor over you

1011
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:05,690
I can't sleep a wink,
that is true

1012
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:10,779
I'm hoping and I'm praying as
my heart breaks right in two

1013
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:14,991
Walkin' the floor over you

1014
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,538
You left me and you went away

1015
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:23,875
You said that
you'd be back in just a day

1016
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:28,130
Are you Loretta Lynn?
Loretta Lynn?

1017
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:32,384
Loretta Lynn?
Loretta Lynn? Loretta Lynn?

1018
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,596
You Loretta Lynn?
I've been calling and calling you.

1019
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:39,307
Now, Mr. Devine says to
put you on Ernest's show.

1020
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:42,811
Now, you go stand right over yonder
and keep your eyes on Ernest.

1021
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,731
He'll introduce you if the
show ain't running too long.

1022
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:52,946
What's the matter with you?

1023
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,031
I'm scared, Doo.
Scared? Goddamn!

1024
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,741
I don't belong here.

1025
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,326
You belong here as
much as anybody does.

1026
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,911
Now try to quit that
complaining and relax.

1027
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:03,248
I ain't ready.
I ain't paid my dues to be here.

1028
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,333
By God, we'll pay
'em later on then.

1029
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,756
Where you going?

1030
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,426
If there's one thing I can't stand,
Loretta, it's a nervous damn woman.

1031
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,969
Don't leave.

1032
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,179
I ain't leaving you,

1033
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,848
I'm just going to get out there
and get me some fresh air!

1034
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:28,064
I'm walkin' the floor over you

1035
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:32,736
I can't sleep a wink,
that is true

1036
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:42,454
Ain't got no place
in here for drunks.

1037
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,789
We don't want
no trouble. Go home.

1038
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,084
Thank you all.

1039
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:49,920
Thank you so very
much and welcome

1040
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,048
to this portion of
our Grand Ole Opry.

1041
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,842
Right now I want you
to meet a little gal

1042
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:58,094
that I feel sure you're
going to love very much.

1043
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:00,805
So, let's give a great
big Grand Ole Opry welcome

1044
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,391
to Miss Loretta Lynn!

1045
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,152
Get out there.

1046
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,655
Well, if you ain't a picker,
what are you?

1047
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,448
Got a wife singing on the Opry.

1048
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:21,451
Oh, I see.
You're one of the husbands.

1049
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:24,955
Well, I'm one of
the wives, darling.

1050
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:26,289
See you later.

1051
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,792
Hey, hey. How about one fifth
wheel buying another one a drink?

1052
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,919
Oh, there she is. She's on
right now, she's on the radio!

1053
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:34,214
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy,
could you turn the radio up?

1054
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,841
...nothing but wrong

1055
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:42,430
Many nights I've
laid awake and cried

1056
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,519
We were so happy

1057
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:50,897
My heart was in a whirl

1058
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:56,569
But now I'm a honky tonk girl

1059
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,449
Hey, sweet thing!

1060
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,868
Sweet thing!

1061
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,914
How's that big ol'
ugly husband of yours?

1062
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,333
He's out in the alley trying to
sober up enough to do his show.

1063
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:12,377
Hey, Del, turn
the radio up, will you?

1064
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:15,839
Listen, I'm trying to hear the radio,
you all. Delmar, turn that thing up!

1065
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,049
He's got a wife on the Opry.
That's right.

1066
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:22,304
Oh, is that right?
Hell, you got it made, man!

1067
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:25,765
All you gotta do is lay up and count
it as the old lady rakes it in.

1068
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,934
Oh, I do my share of the work,
mister. Delmar, turn it up!

1069
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:29,894
Sure you do, Hoss, sure you do.

1070
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,313
Hey, listen,
I told you all politely,

1071
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,023
I'm trying to hear my
wife sing on the radio.

1072
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:36,568
Oh, is that your job?
I mean, she sings and you listen?

1073
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,777
Yeah.

1074
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:46,328
And now I'm a honky tonk girl

1075
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,544
I'll be!

1076
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,380
Wonderful.

1077
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:00,133
Real wonderful, honey,
thank you so much.

1078
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,803
Hey, by the way, you think you
might come back next week?

1079
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:06,639
I ain't got
nothing else planned.

1080
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,517
She ain't got...
Okay, Loretta Lynn!

1081
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,940
She's a doll, I'll tell you.
Thank you, honey.

1082
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:18,360
Doo, did you hear?
They loved me!

1083
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:19,694
Yeah, I heard ya.

1084
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,781
And they want me to come back
next week, can you believe it?

1085
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,699
I can believe it, baby.
Now what we gotta do next

1086
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,409
is to sit down
and plan real careful

1087
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,036
what we're gonna do next.

1088
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,413
I'm too happy to even
think about that now.

1089
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:32,457
I don't care if I
die tomorrow, Doo,

1090
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:36,961
if I never sing another song, it ain't
never gonna be any better than this.

1091
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,464
Did you hurt yourself?
Your jaw's swelling up.

1092
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,509
That's just from grinning, baby,
that's from pure happiness.

1093
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:50,308
I fall to pieces

1094
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:56,648
How can I be just your friend?

1095
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:05,448
You want me to act
like we've never kissed

1096
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:10,161
You want me to forget

1097
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:13,957
Pretend we've never met

1098
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,546
And I've tried and I've tried

1099
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,799
But I haven't yet

1100
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:29,514
You walk by and
I fall to pieces

1101
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:34,018
Friends, this is a number one
hit song by Miss Patsy Cline.

1102
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,146
I guess y'all all know
she's over in the hospital

1103
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,523
'cause she's been in
a real bad car wreck.

1104
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,525
So I wanna
dedicate this song to her.

1105
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,945
So, Patsy, if you're listening,
this song is for you.

1106
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:55,206
I fall to pieces

1107
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:04,174
Oh, thank you.

1108
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,135
Loretta, Patsy Cline's husband.

1109
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,137
Charlie Dick.
Hello.

1110
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:12,098
Patsy heard you tonight and she
wants you to come and see her.

1111
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:13,558
Can you come?

1112
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,894
Doo, this is Charlie Dick,
Patsy Cline's husband.

1113
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,146
She heard me.
She was listening in the hospital.

1114
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,315
She wants to meet me.
Can we go?

1115
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:23,943
Sure, baby, go ahead. I'll take the
young'uns. Get your mama's guitar.

1116
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,195
Are you sure?

1117
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:26,613
Get in the car, baby.
Yeah.

1118
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:29,991
Okay, honey, Mama will be
home soon. Bye-bye.

1119
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,159
Bye, Mom.

1120
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:34,537
Patsy Cline was listening?
To me?

1121
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:36,831
Bye-bye, honey.

1122
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,541
Bye!
See you later, Mama!

1123
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,341
Hey.

1124
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,637
Hey! Did you bring me
that beer like I...

1125
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:56,267
I keep my straw in the top
drawer, honey, right behind you.

1126
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:59,354
Right behind, top drawer.

1127
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,901
It's right in there.
Thank you.

1128
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:09,113
That's the one.
Thank you.

1129
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:18,540
What's the matter
with you?

1130
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:22,585
Ain't you ever seen
no glamorous star before?

1131
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:25,380
You ain't mad at me for singing
your song, are you, Patsy?

1132
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,048
Mad?

1133
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,133
Sit down.

1134
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:35,014
I'm scared

1135
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,559
because people might think you
sing that thing better than I do.

1136
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:38,685
Uh-uh.

1137
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,688
You're stirring
things up in this town.

1138
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:45,358
Hey. How many times
you been on the Opry now?

1139
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,527
I've been on 17 straight times.

1140
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,406
People wanna know
who you been sleeping with

1141
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,408
that you been on so many times.

1142
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,201
Who's been saying that?

1143
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:58,454
Gals that have been sleeping with
everybody and still ain't been on yet.

1144
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,707
Like who?

1145
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,208
Oh.
Let me put it this way,

1146
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,137
take it as a compliment, you
got 'em running scared.

1147
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,091
I just can't believe I'm sitting
here, talking to Patsy Cline.

1148
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:11,759
You know,
Patsy Cline has been

1149
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,761
hospitalized for
several months now

1150
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,430
due to a serious accident.

1151
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:18,349
We are happy to say she is
here tonight to sing for you.

1152
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,561
A Grand Ole Opry welcome
for Patsy Cline!

1153
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:26,524
You're looking
hotter tonight, girl.

1154
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:42,624
Sweet dreams of you

1155
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:51,007
Every night

1156
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:57,555
I go through

1157
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:04,896
Why can't I forget you

1158
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:09,984
And start my life anew?

1159
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:16,199
Instead of having sweet dreams

1160
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:20,995
About you

1161
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:28,086
You don't love me

1162
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,923
It's plain...

1163
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,801
Johnny
didn't need any dogs...

1164
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:36,219
Great, Patsy!

1165
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:37,595
Nice show, Patsy!

1166
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:41,307
What y'all two devils been up to
besides getting into trouble?

1167
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:43,101
Don't answer that.

1168
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,852
Delmar, two Co-Colas.

1169
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,980
Hey, Patsy, Mooney says he's
gonna take me squirrel hunting.

1170
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:50,191
Oh, now, Charlie Dick, don't
you bring home no squirrels.

1171
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,026
When I left Virginia I swore

1172
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,779
I'd never eat another
squirrel as long as I live.

1173
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:59,158
I love squirrel meat.
Don't you like squirrel, Patsy?

1174
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,661
Of course I do.
I married Charlie, didn't I?

1175
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:05,748
Charlie, you know I love you.

1176
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,335
Even if I have to remind
him every now and then

1177
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,629
he ain't nothin' but
a damn tax deduction.

1178
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,884
That goes for you, too, Doolittle
Lynn, and don't you forget it.

1179
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,780
Right from the
start, most every heart

1180
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,533
That's ever been broken...

1181
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,037
Doo? You all right?

1182
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,330
Yeah.

1183
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,834
Got you enough books?

1184
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,639
Get down from there.
Let me try.

1185
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,645
My Lord, Patsy, I hope
we don't get rained out.

1186
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:12,774
You don't get rained
out on circuits like these,

1187
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,776
you just keep on singing.

1188
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,195
Mud, flood, hell or high water.

1189
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,697
Five minutes, Patsy.

1190
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,449
Looks like that's it for me.

1191
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,367
What else do you wear?

1192
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:27,038
I start out with some liquid makeup
and then I powder that down.

1193
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,623
Now, look, Loretta,
you get ready

1194
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:30,625
'cause I'm gonna call you
up after my first song.

1195
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,043
Okay.

1196
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,380
Somebody moving!

1197
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,134
What did you do that for?

1198
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:43,054
What have you got on your face?

1199
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,389
I just thought I'd try it.

1200
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,351
Do you like it?
No.

1201
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,938
Hell, no. You know
that I don't like it.

1202
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,732
Now get on back there
and take it off.

1203
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,486
No.
What?

1204
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:00,321
Hey, now,
wait a minute, by God...

1205
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,031
Loretta Lynn!

1206
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,950
I'll be darned!

1207
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:12,458
I'm back in baby's arms

1208
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:17,088
How I missed those lovin' arms

1209
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:21,634
I'm back where I belong

1210
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:25,888
Back in baby's arms

1211
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:30,268
Don't know why we quarreled

1212
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:31,686
I'm sorry.

1213
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,606
We never did before

1214
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:40,736
Since we found
how much it hurts

1215
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:44,490
I bet we never quarrel anymore

1216
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:46,993
No good.

1217
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,870
What do you have to do to win
one of these parrots here?

1218
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,705
Two out of three.

1219
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:54,500
One...

1220
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:57,920
One parrot. Let me know
when I run out of money now.

1221
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:01,048
Get away with every parrot you got.
Uh-huh.

1222
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,223
Put them right there under the
guitar against the red trailer.

1223
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:12,560
Come on, let's move it up.
I'm cold, I'm miserable, I'm wet,

1224
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,145
I'm gonna lose my voice.

1225
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,064
Have you seen Doo?

1226
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,190
No, darling.

1227
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:20,860
The corner and
put that big ol' thing

1228
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,111
up against the dashboard.

1229
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,654
Take this, will ya?

1230
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:25,740
Anything else
in this here?

1231
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:26,824
Yeah,
I got this right here.

1232
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,954
Put them on top.
That's it.

1233
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:34,373
Let's go.
This bus is taking off!

1234
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,209
Woman, if you
wanna keep that arm,

1235
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,628
you better get it
off my husband.

1236
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,129
Who are you telling what?

1237
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,798
I don't know who you are.
But I know what you are.

1238
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,759
Come on, Doo, if you can walk,
they're gonna leave us.

1239
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,260
Well, let me
tell you something,

1240
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:48,012
if you was keeping
your man satisfied,

1241
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,348
he wouldn't have to go nowhere else.

1242
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,433
Doo, come on, they're
gonna leave without us.

1243
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:53,851
Loretta, let's go!

1244
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:55,645
Let me get my parrots, baby.

1245
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,028
Loretta!

1246
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,696
Thank you.

1247
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,786
The hell you getting in such
an uproar about, Loretta?

1248
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:12,954
I wasn't doing nothing.

1249
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,330
Yeah, I saw you doing nothing.

1250
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:17,375
Loretta, darlin', I get lonesome
standing around by myself,

1251
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:18,793
I need somebody to talk to.

1252
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:22,880
It didn't look like no talking to me.
I'm warning you, Doo,

1253
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:25,967
I'd better not ever catch you
with trash like that again.

1254
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,718
I mean it.

1255
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,721
Warning me?

1256
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:34,016
Goddamn, woman, don't you
ever warn me about nothing!

1257
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:36,185
You understand that?

1258
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:39,397
Hear me talking to you?

1259
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,735
You hear me talking to you?

1260
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:55,079
Women like you,
they're a dime a dozen

1261
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:58,165
You can buy 'em anywhere

1262
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,669
For you to get to him
I'll have to move over

1263
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,380
And I'm gonna stand right here

1264
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:05,589
This is the chorus.

1265
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:08,801
It'll be over my dead body

1266
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:12,096
So get out while you can

1267
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:17,268
'Cause you ain't woman enough
to take my man

1268
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,397
Where the hell did you
get the idea for that?

1269
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:22,857
Where do you think?

1270
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,866
Hey, Charlie!

1271
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,242
Charlie!

1272
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,621
Wake up, Charlie.

1273
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,167
Where the hell you been?

1274
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,502
Shopping.
Looks like you have, too.

1275
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,463
Get all that crap
off your face, by God,

1276
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:46,630
I had about
enough of this crap.

1277
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:48,799
I like it and it's stayin'.
Where the hell you going?

1278
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,176
Hold on a minute, Mooney,
this is my idea.

1279
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,469
You don't talk to me like that.

1280
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:53,387
If I wanna wear makeup, I will.

1281
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:55,890
The hell you will. You're gonna do
exactly whatever the hell I tell you.

1282
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:57,266
I'll do just what I want!

1283
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,018
Don't you talk to me like that.
Don't you hit me!

1284
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:02,772
Don't you hit me.
I'll whip your butt, girl! Goddamn!

1285
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,399
Hey, hey. Come on,
let's get in the car.

1286
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,695
Charlie, get in the car and drive.
Loretta, get in the car.

1287
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,990
Charlie,
get in that car and drive.

1288
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,575
Oh, that's Patsy Cline.

1289
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,368
That's Loretta Lynn!

1290
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:17,995
- Damn!
- Hello, Patsy!

1291
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:19,789
Get
your camera, honey.

1292
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:21,999
Get ready now.

1293
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:27,671
Ain't no chance of gettin' in
that goddamned car, hey, boys?

1294
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,696
Oh, my God. Did I do that?

1295
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,701
Is it broke?

1296
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:07,294
Aren't you gonna talk?

1297
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:24,019
Baby, what I think I'm gonna
do is get me a job somewhere,

1298
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,188
driving a truck
or being a mechanic

1299
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,274
or doing something
that I'm good at.

1300
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:32,778
You're good at managing me.

1301
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:34,989
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

1302
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:39,201
Getting here's one thing
and being here's another.

1303
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:43,664
My job's done, baby,
I'll just get me another one.

1304
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,710
Doo, if it's gonna
break us up, I'll quit.

1305
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:50,296
Successful people
don't quit, baby.

1306
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:58,512
Got another one of your
headaches, don't you?

1307
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:03,809
Just like your daddy.

1308
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:06,604
Coal dust give
him the headache.

1309
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:09,440
I guess I'm what's
giving 'em to you.

1310
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:19,950
Loretta.

1311
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,791
Figured it was about time.

1312
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,603
Doo.

1313
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,737
For you
to get to him I'll have to move over

1314
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,490
And I'm gonna stand right here

1315
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:02,451
It'll be over my dead body

1316
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:05,955
So get out while you can

1317
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:11,502
'Cause you ain't woman enough
to take my man

1318
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,591
I'm pregnant again, Patsy.

1319
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,760
Are you sure?

1320
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,227
I don't wanna have it.

1321
01:33:29,688 --> 01:33:32,189
I've been having
babies since I was 14.

1322
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:34,733
What does Mooney think?

1323
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:36,402
He doesn't know.

1324
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:38,779
Hey, come on, I think you
oughta be happy about this.

1325
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,114
I'm tickled.

1326
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,283
We're gonna have a baby!

1327
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,159
You know what I'm gonna do?

1328
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:47,496
I'm gonna give you the biggest
baby shower in Nashville.

1329
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,707
Now, I want you to make a list.

1330
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,376
Then we'll go shopping.

1331
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:54,837
Hey, you know, I saved all
of my maternity clothes.

1332
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:57,631
In fact, I got
Randy's old things, too.

1333
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:00,092
You're gonna need
all of this, Loretta.

1334
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:05,097
You know, I forgot I had this.

1335
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:06,390
Oh, Patsy.

1336
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:07,683
Can you believe it?

1337
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:09,810
You scared me.

1338
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,687
Red's the color
that drives men wild.

1339
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:13,480
Oh, great,
that's just what I need.

1340
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:16,900
Well, you never know
when it'll come in handy.

1341
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,822
Hey, listen, anything
you can't find in this box

1342
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:22,906
we're gonna buy
when I get back.

1343
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,408
Where are you going?

1344
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:26,535
I got a benefit in Kansas City.

1345
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,037
Oh, I didn't know
I threw that thing away.

1346
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:29,496
Maybe I oughta keep that.
Keep it burnin'.

1347
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,915
Now look, this'll take
you through your fifth month.

1348
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,335
Oh, Patsy, are you
sure you want me to have this?

1349
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,128
Oh, yes, darlin', take it.
Take it.

1350
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:39,214
I got something with your name
written on it right here.

1351
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:41,508
I love that.

1352
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,972
Oh, Patsy, I got to go.
Doo's waiting for me.

1353
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,141
You all right?
Yeah.

1354
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:52,019
All right, now,
I'll call you on Monday.

1355
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,021
Okay.
We'll go shopping.

1356
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:57,149
Anything we can't buy
we'll make.

1357
01:34:57,776 --> 01:34:59,777
Anything we can't make,
we'll steal.

1358
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:02,279
Now, you take care of
yourself, all right?

1359
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:03,489
Okay.

1360
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:04,865
Okay, darling.
Bye-bye, darling.

1361
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,158
Thank you, Patsy.

1362
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,745
Take care. Now, I'm calling you
first thing Monday, don't forget.

1363
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:15,501
You don't love me

1364
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,463
It's plain

1365
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:23,884
I should know

1366
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,011
I'll never wear...

1367
01:35:26,096 --> 01:35:30,015
You're listening to a special
memorial tribute to the late Patsy Cline,

1368
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,725
tragically killed
early this morning

1369
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:34,937
in a plane crash near
Dyersburg, Tennessee.

1370
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:49,868
Baby.

1371
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,329
Darlin'.

1372
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:54,331
She can't be dead.

1373
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,375
Baby.

1374
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,502
We was going shopping.

1375
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:01,338
Who am I gonna talk to now?

1376
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,681
I got the names for 'em, Doo.

1377
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,100
Peggy and Patsy.

1378
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,518
Which one is which?

1379
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,603
I don't know.

1380
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:20,399
I reckon we'll have to wait and
see who grows up to be who.

1381
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:21,775
Well, one thing's for sure,

1382
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,777
we're gonna have to get us
a bigger house someplace

1383
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,196
soon as you get some rest.

1384
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:28,699
I'm gonna go back to work
just as soon as I can, Doo.

1385
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,672
Ladies and gentlemen,
from world-famous Grand Ole Opry,

1386
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,091
make welcome Miss Loretta Lynn.

1387
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,394
Well, I like my lovin'
done country style

1388
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:00,564
And this little girl
would walk a country mile

1389
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:03,984
To find her a good ol'
slow-talkin' country boy

1390
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,487
I said a country boy

1391
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:10,240
I'm about as
old-fashioned as I can be

1392
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:13,076
And I hope you're
likin' what you see

1393
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:16,747
'Cause if you're lookin' at me

1394
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,583
You're lookin' at country

1395
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,629
You don't see no city

1396
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:24,922
When you look at me

1397
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:27,799
'Cause the country is all I am

1398
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:31,929
I love runnin' barefooted
through the old cornfields

1399
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:35,933
And I love that country ham

1400
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
make welcome, please,

1401
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:43,774
a young lady with 21 number one
records, Miss Loretta Lynn.

1402
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:47,945
You don't love me

1403
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:50,989
It's plain

1404
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:55,994
I should know

1405
01:37:56,454 --> 01:38:00,499
I'll never wear your ring

1406
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:08,799
I should hate you

1407
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:13,470
The whole night through

1408
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:18,892
Instead of
having sweet dreams...

1409
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,061
Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

1410
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:22,771
the number one
country music entertainer,

1411
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:24,147
Miss Loretta Lynn.

1412
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:27,150
You've been
making your brags around town

1413
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:29,653
That you've been
a-lovin' my man

1414
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:33,240
But the man I love
when he picks up trash

1415
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:36,827
He puts it in a garbage can

1416
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:39,663
That's what you look like to me

1417
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:42,666
And what I see's a pity

1418
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,419
You better move your feet...

1419
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,504
Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

1420
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:48,839
the first lady
of country music,

1421
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,173
Miss Loretta Lynn.

1422
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,176
There ain't no
pipe can settle this fight

1423
01:38:53,303 --> 01:38:57,347
Your squaw is on
the warpath tonight

1424
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:01,852
Well, I found out,
a-big brave chief

1425
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:04,730
The game you're
a-hunting for ain't beef

1426
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:08,483
Get off-a my huntin' grounds
Get outta my sight

1427
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:13,030
This a-war dance I'm doin'
means I'm fightin' mad

1428
01:39:13,323 --> 01:39:16,033
You don't need no more
of what you've already had...

1429
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:19,745
All I could hear was those
dadgum drums beatin' in my ear.

1430
01:39:20,747 --> 01:39:23,165
When you sing, I feel like
you're talking about my life.

1431
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:24,374
I made this for you.

1432
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:26,501
Darlin', thank you, I love it.

1433
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:28,086
You look tired, you okay?

1434
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:31,340
No, this is it. I feel like I've
been on the road...

1435
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:33,216
I got it! I got it!

1436
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,052
What did she do to my hair?

1437
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:37,471
She cut it. Let's get on the bus.

1438
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:24,559
That sounds like your mama.

1439
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,605
It sure enough is.

1440
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:29,898
There's your mama,
kids, let's go.

1441
01:40:31,234 --> 01:40:32,526
Come on.

1442
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:37,781
Hop in that jeep, let's go say
hello to Mama. There she is!

1443
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:41,159
Get in there, baby.

1444
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:48,959
Howdy, Jim.

1445
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:50,168
Hi, Mooney.

1446
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:51,878
How you doing, baby?

1447
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:53,338
I'm fine.

1448
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:57,759
Come here, twin, get out of
there and give me a hug.

1449
01:40:57,844 --> 01:40:59,219
My name ain't Twin!

1450
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:02,431
You all get out of that jeep, get
down here and say hello to your mama.

1451
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:05,392
When do you think I'll ever
be able to tell y'all apart?

1452
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:06,768
Probably never.

1453
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:09,229
Wait a minute. I want you to
mind your manners around here

1454
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:10,522
or I'm gonna
whip some hind ends.

1455
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:14,234
Get on over there and help Jim
unload your mama's stuff.

1456
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:19,322
My Lord, Doo, what happened?

1457
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:22,826
Oh, Jack Benny done that. Him and
Ernest Ray was having a little race.

1458
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,578
Well, they didn't
get hurt, did they?

1459
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,830
No, they've done gone to
Nashville to get another one.

1460
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:29,791
Did you do
something to your hair?

1461
01:41:29,876 --> 01:41:31,835
Yeah, this fan cut it for me.

1462
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,795
Huh.

1463
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,881
Looks real good.

1464
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:41,386
Doo?
Huh?

1465
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:44,973
I'm gonna ask you to do
something for me, honey.

1466
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:51,897
I've been having
them bad headaches again, Doo.

1467
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:54,900
The doctor gave you them pills.
You taking them pills?

1468
01:41:57,445 --> 01:42:00,470
I'm taking them, but they
ain't doing no good.

1469
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,951
Nothing does.

1470
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,745
Maybe you ought
to slow down some.

1471
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:10,332
Yeah, if you slow down,
they forget about you.

1472
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:16,505
Doo, when I go back out on the
road I want you to go with me.

1473
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:18,924
I'm getting rung to
death out there, honey.

1474
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:22,511
I need somebody to take
care of me a little bit.

1475
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:26,389
Hell, you got people fighting
each other to take care of you.

1476
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,603
I need you, Doo.

1477
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:35,315
I need somebody
that cares about me.

1478
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,443
I need you.

1479
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:03,426
I ain't even gonna bother you.

1480
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:06,763
Don't worry.

1481
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:25,407
It's 1:00 in the morning,
what the hell do you want?

1482
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:28,368
No, Loretta ain't here,
lady, she's on the road.

1483
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,121
How the hell did you get
this number, anyway?

1484
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,458
Hey, quit that crying, lady.

1485
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:41,298
Quit it and I'll give
Loretta your message.

1486
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,634
Yeah.

1487
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:48,138
All right, you liked
her last album a lot.

1488
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:52,893
She loves you, too.

1489
01:43:54,937 --> 01:43:56,938
She'll pray for you, too.

1490
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:02,527
Lady, you're gonna
have to quit that crying.

1491
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:06,239
Get yourself some sleep, gonna
be better in the morning,

1492
01:44:06,324 --> 01:44:07,741
I guarantee it.

1493
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,996
No. No. You didn't
wake me up.

1494
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:15,665
Uh-uh.

1495
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:18,793
That's right.

1496
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:22,547
There's a lot of lonesome
people in the world.

1497
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,011
Good night.

1498
01:44:37,939 --> 01:44:39,898
- Go get 'em, Loretta.
- There she is.

1499
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:41,107
Better step back there.

1500
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:42,317
Would you sign this, honey?

1501
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,235
Would you sign this, Loretta?
All right.

1502
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:48,865
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you make welcome

1503
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:50,450
the first lady
of country music,

1504
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,202
Miss Loretta Lynn.

1505
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:08,385
Well, I like my
lovin' done country style

1506
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:11,680
And this little girl
would walk a country mile

1507
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:14,265
To find her a good
ol' slow-talkin'...

1508
01:45:17,269 --> 01:45:19,104
Hey, Jim!

1509
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:39,457
What does it look like, boys?

1510
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:42,836
She's looking good tonight.

1511
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,600
"They say
to have her hair done."

1512
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:06,901
They say
to have her hair done

1513
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:09,446
Liz flies all the way to France

1514
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:13,783
"Jackie's seen
in a discotheque."

1515
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:17,287
"Jackie is seen
in a discotheque."

1516
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:23,293
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque
doing a brand-new dance

1517
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:27,922
"The White House
social season."

1518
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:32,052
"The White House social season
should be glittering and gay."

1519
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,971
Hold it, guys.
You Ain't Woman Enough.

1520
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:41,978
You Ain't Woman Enough.

1521
01:46:42,313 --> 01:46:45,065
You come
to tell me somethin'

1522
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:48,109
You say I ought to know

1523
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,626
Here's the tape
of her new song.

1524
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,503
She has a problem
with the words now.

1525
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:08,797
Would you see she gets it?

1526
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,578
There she is!

1527
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:44,707
Will you
please move down?

1528
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:47,210
Thank you, move on, now,
keep moving, please.

1529
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,295
Doo, what time is it?

1530
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:53,777
Doo?

1531
01:48:19,102 --> 01:48:20,394
Doo?

1532
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,872
Is it time for me to go on yet?

1533
01:48:40,264 --> 01:48:41,598
Where have you been?

1534
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:45,602
I was just coming to get you.
Are you ready?

1535
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,937
You're supposed to
be taking care of me.

1536
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:49,981
That's what I'm doing.

1537
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:53,943
It's just not clear and we have
to set up the schedule properly.

1538
01:48:55,446 --> 01:48:57,280
Honey, you're early, you
got another 10 minutes.

1539
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:59,407
We gotta talk about what you're
gonna do for the Vegas show.

1540
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:01,367
I wanna talk to Doo.

1541
01:49:01,744 --> 01:49:04,078
I wanna be with
Doo for a minute.

1542
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:18,468
I can't sing tonight, Doo.
Somebody tell them.

1543
01:49:19,428 --> 01:49:22,972
Baby, you've got 10,000 people
sitting out there waiting on you.

1544
01:49:25,893 --> 01:49:27,602
Please, Doo.

1545
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:29,646
Baby, they're out
there waiting on you,

1546
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:30,855
now you don't
wanna let 'em down.

1547
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:33,149
Don't tell me about
letting them down,

1548
01:49:33,234 --> 01:49:35,401
you don't even
know them people!

1549
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:49,916
Darlin', I don't know
what to tell you.

1550
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,001
I swear I don't.

1551
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:05,473
Hell, baby, there ain't
nothing I can tell you.

1552
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:16,192
All I can do is just tell you to get the
hell out there and sing for the folks.

1553
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,702
Okay, get me on stage,
I wanna go out there.

1554
01:50:42,678 --> 01:50:44,637
Hold it, boys.
Hold it.

1555
01:50:47,182 --> 01:50:48,725
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you make welcome

1556
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:50,435
the first lady
of country music,

1557
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:52,145
Miss Loretta Lynn.

1558
01:51:20,758 --> 01:51:24,677
I had something I wanted to come
out here and tell y'all tonight.

1559
01:51:26,347 --> 01:51:28,431
But, Doo, he don't
want me to say nothing.

1560
01:51:35,773 --> 01:51:37,690
But I can tell you.

1561
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:41,903
Friends.

1562
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:50,411
'Cause you wouldn't be here
if you didn't care about me.

1563
01:51:56,293 --> 01:51:58,294
See...

1564
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:19,065
Things is moving
too fast in my life.

1565
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:23,903
Always have.

1566
01:52:25,697 --> 01:52:28,533
I mean, one day I was just

1567
01:52:30,994 --> 01:52:33,204
a little girl, the next
day I was married,

1568
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:35,998
the next day
I was having babies,

1569
01:52:40,379 --> 01:52:43,214
and next day I was out
here singing for y'all.

1570
01:52:45,092 --> 01:52:46,843
And...

1571
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:55,017
Patsy was always saying, "Little
girl, you got to run your own life."

1572
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:03,568
But my life's running me and...

1573
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:10,450
Uh...

1574
01:53:16,582 --> 01:53:19,834
Where's my...
Where's Doo?

1575
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:28,801
Doo?

1576
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:32,722
Come on, let's go to the bus.

1577
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:39,061
We've got you.

1578
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:51,199
Come on, baby.

1579
01:53:52,034 --> 01:53:53,201
Baby.

1580
01:54:57,849 --> 01:55:00,184
Whoa, babies.
Whoa, babies.

1581
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:04,897
Whoa, babies, slow down, now.
Whoa, babies.

1582
01:55:08,485 --> 01:55:09,652
Hey.

1583
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:11,487
I got something
I wanna show you.

1584
01:55:11,572 --> 01:55:13,155
What?

1585
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:21,914
Slow down, Doo!

1586
01:55:34,886 --> 01:55:36,053
What do you think?

1587
01:55:36,138 --> 01:55:37,179
About what?

1588
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:42,101
What are you up to, Doo?

1589
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:44,770
I'm gonna build us
a house right here.

1590
01:55:48,025 --> 01:55:49,692
That's a hell of a view,
ain't it?

1591
01:55:49,776 --> 01:55:53,821
I picked this particular spot on
account of, well, from right in there

1592
01:55:54,698 --> 01:55:57,199
it looks a bit like
Kentucky used to be.

1593
01:55:58,702 --> 01:56:02,455
Thought I'd put the bedroom back over
in here in the front of the house

1594
01:56:03,498 --> 01:56:04,790
so we can wake up every morning

1595
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:06,083
and look out that
old picture window

1596
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:08,461
and watch the sun come up.

1597
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:13,132
Thought back up here would be a
good place for a breakfast nook.

1598
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:14,175
And then right...

1599
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:16,677
Dadgummit, Doo.

1600
01:56:16,762 --> 01:56:19,764
You never asked me nothing
about no new house.

1601
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:22,016
I wanted to surprise you, baby.

1602
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,060
Well, stop surprising me.

1603
01:56:25,145 --> 01:56:27,855
You never ask me about nothing.

1604
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:32,068
Well, hell, I thought you'd
want a new house, babe.

1605
01:56:33,362 --> 01:56:35,321
For the privacy if not for
nothing else, by God.

1606
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:39,241
I ain't said I don't
want no new house.

1607
01:56:39,326 --> 01:56:43,329
I just said you ain't asked me
nothing about it. You never do.

1608
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:48,084
You just say, "Hey, baby, here's
the deal, take it or leave it!"

1609
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:49,919
Well, it's driving
me crazy, Doo.

1610
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:52,713
Hell, let's go to the house, let's
call the lawyers and get a divorce.

1611
01:56:52,839 --> 01:56:54,799
I'm tired of this bullshit.

1612
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,137
I don't want no divorce,

1613
01:57:00,222 --> 01:57:02,932
I just want the dadgum bedroom
in the back of the house.

1614
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:08,604
You put the dadgum bedroom in
the front of the house, Doo,

1615
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:12,858
and the sun comes in every morning
at 5:00 and shines in my eyes.

1616
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:14,860
How am I supposed
to get any sleep?

1617
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:17,530
You're not too ignorant to get out
of the bed and walk over here

1618
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:19,824
and pull a set of window
blinds down, are you?

1619
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,076
No, and I'm not
too ignorant to know

1620
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,412
that the dadgum bedroom don't
belong in the front of the house

1621
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:26,288
where the living
room ought to be.

1622
01:57:28,417 --> 01:57:32,086
Stop growling, Doo, you sound
like an old bear or something.

1623
01:57:35,215 --> 01:57:36,549
All right,
we'll put the bedroom

1624
01:57:36,633 --> 01:57:38,467
in the back of the house,
all right?

1625
01:57:42,097 --> 01:57:43,973
Let's not be too hasty, Doo,

1626
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:46,225
maybe we oughta leave the bedroom
in the front of the house,

1627
01:57:46,309 --> 01:57:49,478
it's always been there
and it's pretty here.

1628
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:52,273
It's beautiful, darlin'. We'll put the
bedroom in the back of the house

1629
01:57:52,357 --> 01:57:54,442
and then we'll put one in
front of the house, too.

1630
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:58,112
Oh, great. Then we'll both
have our own bedroom.

1631
01:57:58,196 --> 01:58:00,781
No, I'm gonna be
living in a tree house,

1632
01:58:00,866 --> 01:58:02,408
I'm gonna build
right up the hill there.

1633
01:58:06,997 --> 01:58:09,749
Ladies and gentlemen,
back with us once again,

1634
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:13,127
the first lady of country music,
the coal miner's daughter,

1635
01:58:13,211 --> 01:58:15,212
Miss Loretta Lynn.

1636
01:58:17,174 --> 01:58:22,052
Well, I was born
the coal miner's daughter

1637
01:58:24,306 --> 01:58:29,810
In a cabin on a hill
in Butcher Holler

1638
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:34,648
We were poor but we had love

1639
01:58:34,858 --> 01:58:38,360
That's the one thing
my daddy made sure of

1640
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:44,283
He shoveled coal
to make a poor man's dollar

1641
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:50,706
Daddy loved and raised eight
kids on a miner's pay

1642
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:57,880
Mommy scrubbed our clothes
on a washboard every day

1643
01:59:00,217 --> 01:59:03,803
Why, I've seen
her fingers bleed

1644
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:07,056
To complain there was no need

1645
01:59:07,516 --> 01:59:12,895
She'd smile in Mommy's
understanding way

1646
01:59:14,856 --> 01:59:20,319
In the summertime
we didn't have shoes to wear

1647
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:26,909
But in the wintertime
we'd all get a brand-new pair

1648
01:59:29,329 --> 01:59:32,289
From a mail-order catalogue

1649
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:36,293
Money made from sellin' a hog

1650
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:42,091
Daddy always managed
to get the money somewhere

1651
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:48,973
Yeah, I'm proud to be
a coal miner's daughter

1652
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:56,480
I remember well
the well where I drew water

1653
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,277
The work we done was hard

1654
02:00:01,736 --> 02:00:05,030
At night we'd sleep
'cause we were tired

1655
02:00:05,282 --> 02:00:11,078
I never thought of ever
leavin' Butcher Holler

1656
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:17,626
Well, a lot of things have
changed since way back then

1657
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:25,175
And it's so good to
be back home again

1658
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:29,722
Not much left but the floor

1659
02:00:30,557 --> 02:00:33,809
Nothing lives here anymore

1660
02:00:34,311 --> 02:00:39,815
'Cept the memories
of a coal miner's daughter

1661
02:00:45,196 --> 02:00:48,240
They say to have her hair done

1662
02:00:48,325 --> 02:00:51,577
Liz flies all the way to France

1663
02:00:52,454 --> 02:00:58,834
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque
doing a brand-new dance

1664
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:05,758
And the White House social season
should be glittering and gay

1665
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:10,554
But here in Topeka
The rain is a-fallin'

1666
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:14,016
The faucet is a-drippin'
and the kids are a-bawlin'

1667
02:01:14,142 --> 02:01:17,603
One of the them's a-toddlin'
and one is a-crawlin'

1668
02:01:17,687 --> 02:01:20,522
And one's on the way

1669
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:28,989
Ever since you left me
I've done nothing but wrong

1670
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:35,245
Many nights I've
laid awake and cried

1671
02:01:36,539 --> 02:01:42,419
We were so happy
my heart was in a whirl

1672
02:01:43,338 --> 02:01:48,842
But now I'm a honky tonk girl

1673
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:52,554
You come to tell me somethin'

1674
02:01:52,681 --> 02:01:55,891
You say I ought to know

1675
02:01:56,184 --> 02:02:02,022
That he don't love me anymore
and I'll have to let him go

1676
02:02:02,482 --> 02:02:08,696
You say you're gonna take him
but I don't think you can

1677
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:14,952
'Cause you ain't woman enough
to take my man

1678
02:02:15,745 --> 02:02:19,415
Well, I like my lovin'
done country style

1679
02:02:19,499 --> 02:02:22,751
And this little girl
would walk a country mile

1680
02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:26,380
To find her a good ol'
slow-talking country boy

1681
02:02:26,464 --> 02:02:28,590
I said a country boy

1682
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:32,636
I'm about as
old-fashioned as I can be

1683
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:35,597
And I hope you're
likin' what you see

1684
02:02:36,307 --> 02:02:38,934
'Cause if you're lookin' at me

1685
02:02:39,978 --> 02:02:43,147
You're lookin' at country

1686
02:02:44,107 --> 02:02:47,276
Well, you've been
makin' your brags around town

1687
02:02:47,402 --> 02:02:50,237
That you've been lovin' my man

1688
02:02:50,321 --> 02:02:53,699
But the man I love
when he picks up trash

1689
02:02:53,783 --> 02:02:56,702
He puts it in a garbage can

1690
02:02:56,828 --> 02:02:59,913
And that's what
you look like to me

1691
02:02:59,998 --> 02:03:02,458
And what I see's a pity

1692
02:03:02,959 --> 02:03:06,253
You better move your feet
if you don't wanna eat

1693
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:09,173
A meal that's called Fist City

1694
02:03:10,967 --> 02:03:13,719
Well, your pet name
for me is "squaw"

1695
02:03:13,803 --> 02:03:16,805
When you come home drinkin'
and can barely crawl

1696
02:03:16,931 --> 02:03:21,143
And all that lovin' on me
won't make things right

1697
02:03:22,437 --> 02:03:25,147
Well, you leave me at home
to keep the tepee clean

1698
02:03:25,315 --> 02:03:28,150
And six papooses
to break and wean

1699
02:03:28,234 --> 02:03:32,237
Your squaw is on
the warpath tonight

1700
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:36,492
No, don't come home a-drinkin'

1701
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:39,369
With lovin' on your mind

1702
02:03:39,496 --> 02:03:44,875
Just stay out there, on the
town and see what you can find

1703
02:03:45,293 --> 02:03:48,087
'Cause if you want
that kind of love

1704
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:50,798
Well, you don't
need none of mine

1705
02:03:50,924 --> 02:03:56,595
So don't come home a-drinkin'
with lovin' on your mind

1706
02:03:58,139 --> 02:04:04,770
No, don't come home a-drinkin'
with lovin' on your mind
