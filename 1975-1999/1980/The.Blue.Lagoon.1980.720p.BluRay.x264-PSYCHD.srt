1
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,476
Richard, don't go out too far.

2
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,531
Em's a fraidy cat!

3
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,413
Richard! Emmeline!

4
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:00,272
Come back here this minute.

5
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,963
And be careful.

6
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:05,512
What's gotten into you, Richard?

7
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:08,618
Bad enough to endanger yourself,
but to encourage Emmeline...

8
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,347
I'm sorry, Father.

9
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:12,652
I know you want to have fun.

10
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:17,457
All I'm trying to do is get us all
to San Francisco in one piece.

11
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,398
Will Mommy be coming to San Fr'isco?

12
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:22,776
I don't believe so, Richard.

13
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,241
I told you. Once they go to heaven...

14
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:28,392
they don't come back.
Isn't that right, Uncle Arthur?

15
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:30,720
My mommy and daddy haven't come back.

16
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,288
Because God wants them to stay...

17
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:35,715
and do his work and wait for the day...

18
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,975
when you will take
the long voyage to see them.

19
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:40,870
When will that be?

20
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,081
When you've lived a full life...

21
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,394
and experienced all
that it has to offer.

22
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,695
Look!

23
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,455
Father, what are they called?

24
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,619
Sharks.

25
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:58,795
I wish I had a hook. I'd pull 'em aboard
and the cook would fry 'em for dinner.

26
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:30,612
Captain, do you know
there's a fog bank coming in?

27
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,003
I'm aware of that fact, sir.

28
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:36,208
I heard one of the men say
those storms rounding the cape...

29
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,335
pushed us far west of our course.

30
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,263
That's right, sir.
Last night's celestial puts us about here.

31
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,370
Richard, what are you looking at?

32
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,847
They don't have any clothes on.

33
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:08,309
What the hell are you two doing here?
I'll teach you, bucko!

34
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,440
Come here.

35
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,765
Don't you dare hurt him.

36
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,136
You want a hiding, too, do you?

37
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:19,494
- Fire!
- Fire?

38
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,903
Did somebody say "fire"?

39
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,240
Man the pumps.

40
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,920
- Button.
- Yes, sir?

41
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,420
Take the children and Mr. Lestrange
and row them away from the ship.

42
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:35,401
Come on.

43
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,798
Mr. Lestrange.

44
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,225
There's blasting powder in that hold.
I saw them load it.

45
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,488
Keep moving!

46
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,680
Come on, will you?

47
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,719
Come on, you.

48
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:58,671
Uncle Arthur!

49
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,276
Richard! Emmeline!

50
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,301
- This way, Lestrange.
- The children!

51
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,269
They've already taken their leave.
Follow me, sir.

52
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,350
No, there is no more room.

53
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:12,874
Lower away!

54
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,707
Abandon ship!

55
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,346
Don't explode yet!

56
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:31,276
Further.

57
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,067
What's happening? I can't see.

58
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,727
- What was that?
- The ship. Cover your faces.

59
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,820
Richard!

60
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:44,286
Emmeline!

61
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:46,530
Uncle Arthur!

62
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,128
There they are!

63
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:49,417
Where?

64
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:50,796
Captain, over here.

65
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:51,972
Richard!

66
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,235
Hello.

67
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,594
Father!

68
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:59,304
Don't go shouting both at once.

69
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:02,058
I won't know which way to steer.

70
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,255
Longboat, ahoy! Where are you?

71
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,646
Hello!

72
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:18,867
Father!

73
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:28,881
Gone.

74
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:37,416
Lord, help us.

75
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:20,179
Where is Father?

76
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,679
What is your name?

77
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:27,338
Paddy Button. Now, belay your questions.
Can't you see I'm busy?

78
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,989
Damn it. No food or water.

79
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:36,420
That's Chopin. I can play it on the piano.

80
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:44,394
Mr. Button, can I ask you a question?

81
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:45,833
Yes.

82
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,609
Are you a pirate?

83
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:56,338
I'm thirsty.

84
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,003
Me, too.

85
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:01,510
Listen...

86
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:04,952
you'll hear it hiss
when it touches the water.

87
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,265
- You hear it?
- I think so.

88
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,285
I don't hear anything.

89
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:15,270
Listen harder.
It must be fairly boilin' by now.

90
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,773
There. Do you hear it?

91
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:20,515
I hear it. Don't you hear it now, Em?

92
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,546
I think so.

93
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:24,662
Yes, I hear it.

94
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,145
I smell flowers.

95
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,311
Flowers?

96
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,704
Mr. Button! Richard! Look!

97
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,049
It's land!

98
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:18,793
Land!

99
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:22,184
We're saved.
I would never have believed it.

100
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:42,470
Where are we?

101
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:48,288
Nirvana, that's where we are. No more
"yes, sir," "no, sir," for Paddy Button.

102
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,447
No more breaking my back
over a stinkin' stove.

103
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:56,412
Will Father be coming to fetch us?

104
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:57,983
Come on, let's look around.

105
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:24,875
Listen.

106
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,809
Come on.

107
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,399
I knew it.

108
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:39,612
It's lovely.

109
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,525
Water.

110
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,047
Down there! Look out below!

111
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:29,009
Mr. Button, there's a barrel over here...

112
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,815
with funny stuff in it
that smells like the Captain's breath.

113
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,188
The Captain's breath?

114
00:13:40,524 --> 00:13:42,082
It's rum.

115
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,828
Sweet Jesus.

116
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,440
Look what a funny thing I found.
It's got holes in it.

117
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:54,754
Give me that. Where did you get it?

118
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,901
- What was it?
- We'd better get out of here.

119
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:02,678
There's a bunch of them up there.

120
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:04,954
Come on, let's get out of here.

121
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,853
Hurry it up, will you?

122
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:19,632
I don't see Father's boat.

123
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:24,743
No, not yet. Maybe he'll be along later.

124
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,806
Maybe not.

125
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:34,992
Take them things out of your mouth!

126
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:37,883
Open your mouth!
Take them out of your mouth!

127
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,880
Spit them out! Go on!

128
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:45,097
Don't cry. I ain't mad at you.

129
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:49,102
If you eat them berries, you'll go to sleep.
You'll never wake up again.

130
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:52,222
They're never-wake-up berries, you see?

131
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:58,604
Just leave them berries alone. Come on.

132
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:04,890
We had a cat once
that went to sleep and never woke up.

133
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:08,376
Uncle Arthur said she was dead and buried.

134
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:12,088
Mr. Button, do you think she ate
some of those berries?

135
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:13,725
Maybe.

136
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,828
What does it really mean, Paddy,
"dead and buried"?

137
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,018
It means that they put you in the ground
and they cover you up.

138
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,926
And you're dead and buried, do you see?

139
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:28,100
Like Mrs. Jones' baby. Remember, Em?

140
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:31,471
The doctor dug it out of the cabbage patch.

141
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:32,961
The cabbage patch?

142
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,567
That's right.
But he took it back and planted it again.

143
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,562
So it could grow and turn into an angel.

144
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,729
I got a trowel
and dug our cabbage patch all up.

145
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,819
But there weren't any babies or any angels.

146
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,131
Only worms.

147
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,975
What's in them pictures, Richard?

148
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:01,600
It's a story about these funny people
who get married.

149
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,114
There is a saying under each one.

150
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,101
Give us a look.

151
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:14,211
Yeah.

152
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,850
Were you ever married, Paddy?

153
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,373
Seven times.

154
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,754
Kids in every port from Callao to Macao.
Seventeen at the last count.

155
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,969
Never set eyes on a single of them.

156
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,634
Slanted-eyed little devils...

157
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,535
black little devils,
even a couple of pink ones like you.

158
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,583
And all with my eyes.

159
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,078
Paddy, what's "subjugation"?

160
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,472
Something I've been trying to avoid
all my life.

161
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,436
Come back here. This ain't gonna hurt you.

162
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,924
We don't want to go swimming!
We don't have our bathing costumes!

163
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,893
To hell with your bathing costumes!

164
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,449
You don't wear them
when you have a bath, do you?

165
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,955
This isn't a bathtub. This is the ocean!

166
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,626
Ready, go. That's it.

167
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,752
Whenever you see a ship,
you run down quick...

168
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:29,998
and you light the signal fire.
Do you hear me?

169
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:35,773
There's the rabbit hole...

170
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:41,605
There's a fox, see. Pull it tight.
There's a knot. Do it.

171
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:56,404
Run your finger up like that.
You shove that around under there.

172
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:10,065
There you are. Put it there, shipmate.

173
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:18,979
Where'd you find that?

174
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:22,301
I didn't find it.
I made it from the knots you taught me.

175
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,637
You made it? Well...

176
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,731
pity it's not a bit bigger.

177
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:29,460
Let's go swimming.

178
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:30,727
Yeah.

179
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:58,103
Come back here and put your clothes on!

180
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,989
I don't want to wear my old britches.

181
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:06,953
It ain't proper to be
running around naked all the time.

182
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,139
Alone at last.

183
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,664
Richard, Emmeline,
I want you both to promise me something.

184
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:52,828
I want you to promise me
that you will never, ever go over...

185
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,120
to the other side of the island.

186
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:56,656
Why, Paddy?

187
00:20:58,014 --> 00:21:00,733
Why? Because I tell you, that's why!

188
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,739
There's nasty things go on over there, see?

189
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,215
Vile, evil, sinister things.

190
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:08,092
Like what?

191
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,110
Yes, Mr. Button, like what?

192
00:21:10,277 --> 00:21:13,235
Well, for a start,
that's where the bogeyman lives.

193
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,799
The bogeyman?

194
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,985
That's right. And you know what happens
when the bogeyman...

195
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:21,080
gets his hands on little people
like yourselves?

196
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,594
Why, he just eats them.

197
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,901
He pops them into his mouth like candy...

198
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,714
and he chews them up
and he swallows them, bones and all.

199
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,712
Do you know what "law" is?

200
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:41,255
Good. From now on, that's the law, see?

201
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:45,085
No one goes over to the other side.

202
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:51,921
You look funny.

203
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:55,486
Children, where are you?

204
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,304
Look at me.

205
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,807
Look at me.

206
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:32,452
You're silly
when you drink out of that barrel.

207
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,825
This is a serious dance.

208
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,339
Sing the one
about the Hoochie Coochie girls.

209
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,603
Come on. Are you ready?

210
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,270
Where's Paddy?

211
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:25,252
He's gone.

212
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:28,252
There he is.

213
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,950
He must have swum over there
and gone to sleep. Come on.

214
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:42,870
What are you doing that for?

215
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:47,397
I'm going to put it on Mr. Button's head,
so when you say "boo" into his ear...

216
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:50,066
he'll jump up with it on.

217
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:17,108
Paddy, wake up, it's us.

218
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,860
Wake up!

219
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:06,968
Don't worry, Em, we'll be all right.

220
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,595
Take me away from this place, Richard.

221
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,067
Look!

222
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:06,491
This looks like a good place
to stay for awhile.

223
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:29,615
Wake up. It's Christmas morning.

224
00:30:30,018 --> 00:30:31,053
Christmas?

225
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:34,461
Yesterday, I counted 52 big marks
on the tree and last night he came.

226
00:30:34,688 --> 00:30:36,087
What are you talking about?

227
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:40,110
Santa Claus. I saw all his reindeer
right there on the beach.

228
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:42,272
Let's see if he brought us anything.

229
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:43,721
Come on, Em, hurry.

230
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:51,759
That's where the reindeer were, see?

231
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,255
Look at our stockings.

232
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,291
And there's something in them!

233
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:14,229
Look, just what I always wanted.

234
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:15,666
What are they?

235
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:17,926
What do they look like? They're marbles.

236
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:21,100
See, these are your Jaspers
and these are your Peewees.

237
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,295
You did it all.

238
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:27,579
But...

239
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,627
Fooled ya, didn't I?

240
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:39,823
You!

241
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:51,615
Why are we always fighting so much?

242
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:54,880
I don't know.

243
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:58,965
That should be our New Year's revolution:
To stop fighting so much.

244
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,263
- I'll try, but...
- But, what?

245
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:07,216
I don't know what's wrong with me
when I say the things I say.

246
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,298
I just keep on having
all these strange thoughts.

247
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,172
What kind of thoughts?

248
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,418
Just thoughts.
Funny thoughts about you and me.

249
00:32:19,213 --> 00:32:20,328
Tell me.

250
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:21,817
I couldn't.

251
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:25,094
They're just thoughts.
They don't mean anything.

252
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,657
Where did you find these?

253
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,882
I found them in those little shells.

254
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,984
They're beautiful. Thank you.

255
00:32:45,323 --> 00:32:48,315
"O come, all ye faithful"

256
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:55,170
"O little town of Bethlehem"

257
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:02,102
"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh"

258
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:03,906
"All the"

259
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:09,772
Help!

260
00:34:21,337 --> 00:34:22,326
What's wrong?

261
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:27,246
You're bleeding.

262
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,499
Don't! I'm all right.

263
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:31,999
But you're bleeding.

264
00:34:32,432 --> 00:34:34,070
Go away! Don't look at me.

265
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:38,500
Go away!

266
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:08,439
What was it, Em?

267
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:11,636
- Why were you bleeding like that?
- I don't know.

268
00:35:11,932 --> 00:35:13,047
Liar!

269
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:15,265
It's true, I don't know.

270
00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:22,663
People don't bleed like that
unless they've cut themselves.

271
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:26,163
Maybe you're hurt real bad
and you just don't know it.

272
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:28,836
- Let me look.
- No! I don't want you to look.

273
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:31,547
- But, why?
- Just because.

274
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:33,843
That is not fair.

275
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,276
I don't keep any secrets from you.
I tell you everything.

276
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:39,145
Everything.

277
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,882
What are you looking at?

278
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,004
Your muscles.

279
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:28,786
What about them?

280
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:34,368
You're really acting silly lately.
Always saying dumb things like that.

281
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:36,234
Always looking at me funny.

282
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:39,115
You're not coming down with something,
are you?

283
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:42,866
Well, don't give it to me.

284
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:03,221
Tell me again.

285
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:06,281
- Where are your mother and father?
- In heaven.

286
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,369
But where's heaven?

287
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:10,547
You know, up there.

288
00:38:11,282 --> 00:38:14,399
- Your father might be there, too.
- No, he's not.

289
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:17,337
He's coming on a ship someday
to take us home.

290
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:23,354
Do you hear it?

291
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:25,039
No.

292
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:26,927
Do you ever hear it?

293
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,001
Sometimes I think I do.

294
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:31,184
I think Paddy was a liar.

295
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:35,121
He told us there was a pot of gold
at the end of every rainbow...

296
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,948
and that was a lie.

297
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:40,347
He told us if we dug far enough
we'd reach China.

298
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,966
And Santa Claus never came.

299
00:38:49,322 --> 00:38:51,916
Do you ever think about him?

300
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:56,150
I do.

301
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,298
I know you don't like to
talk about it, but...

302
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:05,080
don't you ever wonder
what really happened?

303
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:10,154
I don't want to know what happened.

304
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:14,252
I do.

305
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:18,237
There are so many things
I don't understand.

306
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:22,872
Why do fish stop swimming and lie on top
of the tide pools after it rains?

307
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:26,916
Why do you hear the waves
inside the big shells?

308
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,586
Why are all these funny hairs
growing on me?

309
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:37,014
I wish a big book with all the answers
to every question in the world...

310
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:40,204
would drop out of the sky
and land in my hand right now.

311
00:39:40,415 --> 00:39:44,090
- I'd read it till I knew everything.
- You can't know everything.

312
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:47,210
Only God knows everything.

313
00:39:47,631 --> 00:39:48,700
God?

314
00:39:48,924 --> 00:39:51,722
He can't find us
any better than Santa Claus.

315
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:26,534
I wonder what fish think about?

316
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,239
What are you doing?

317
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,303
Trying to cheer you up. Come on, laugh.

318
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:39,816
It's not going to work.

319
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:43,274
There it is again.

320
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:48,770
Do you think it's the bogeyman?

321
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,697
Maybe it's another person.

322
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:56,951
No...

323
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,369
or he would have come over
to meet us and say hello.

324
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:02,552
That's the proper thing to do.

325
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:05,541
What if he's not nice?
What if he wants to hurt us?

326
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:09,405
Then I'll spear him.

327
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:34,127
Look! I'm the greatest fisherman
who ever lived.

328
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,019
I'm the greatest fisherman who ever lived.

329
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:40,000
While you scare them off,
I catch as many as I want to.

330
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:42,684
That's my fish dance!
It doesn't scare them off.

331
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:45,785
It brings them up to the surface
where I can spear them.

332
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:47,515
Who cares what you say?

333
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,389
It's not how many you catch.
It's how you do it.

334
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,594
Stop that!

335
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:13,549
Please play something else.

336
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,770
Why must you do that
when you know it makes me angry?

337
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,652
"It doesn't scare them away.
It brings 'em to the top..."

338
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,437
"...where I can spear them."

339
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,246
I'll spear you.

340
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,145
Here I am.

341
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:00,973
Come back here...

342
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:04,163
or I'll pull your britches down
and take a switch to you.

343
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,056
Don't you dare try to spank me. I mean it.

344
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,051
I'll put never-wake-up berries
in your food! I mean it.

345
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,611
Say, "Richard is the smartest person
on the island."

346
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:17,130
- Say it!
- Stop it, Richard. I'm getting angry.

347
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:19,433
- Stop it! Now get off.
- Say it!

348
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,532
Richard is the smartest person
on the island.

349
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,877
- The fastest swimmer.
- The fastest swimmer.

350
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,133
- The fastest runner.
- The fastest runner.

351
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:30,351
- The best hut builder.
- You're the best everything. Now get off!

352
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:31,854
It's true.

353
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:35,622
Just you wait.
You'll never know when it'll happen.

354
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:38,418
Just one little bite
and you'll never wake up again.

355
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,267
- What is it? What happened?
- I saw him.

356
00:48:13,442 --> 00:48:15,876
- Who?
- The face Paddy thought was a bogeyman.

357
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:18,754
- You went to the other side?
- He's not the bogeyman.

358
00:48:18,947 --> 00:48:20,585
I think he's God.

359
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:21,415
God?

360
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:23,763
He looks like Pastor Logan said
he looked like:

361
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:26,750
"You'd better be good or else."
And he was bleeding.

362
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,915
- I don't believe you.
- Just like Jesus.

363
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:31,039
Don't go there again. It's the law.

364
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:33,564
What if he really is God?
Shouldn't we go and pray?

365
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:36,313
Or won't he be mad
and not let us go to heaven?

366
00:48:36,506 --> 00:48:38,462
I don't want to talk about it.

367
00:49:57,923 --> 00:49:59,242
What is it?

368
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:01,221
I'm here.

369
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:09,257
- You ate the "dead and berries"...
- No, I'm fine.

370
00:50:09,478 --> 00:50:12,231
- You just had a bad dream.
- Don't ever leave me.

371
00:50:12,938 --> 00:50:15,498
Promise you won't.
Promise you'll always be with me.

372
00:50:15,984 --> 00:50:16,894
I promise.

373
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:30,480
Don't.

374
00:51:32,229 --> 00:51:33,947
What are you doing?

375
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:36,710
Go away!

376
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:03,393
Where are you going?

377
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:12,050
Wait. What's the matter?

378
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:33,648
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

379
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:36,393
Why won't you talk to me?

380
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:39,225
Just leave me alone.

381
00:54:02,424 --> 00:54:04,142
A ship, Emmeline!

382
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:11,211
The signal fire, you didn't light it.
Why didn't you light it?

383
00:54:11,475 --> 00:54:15,468
You know how much I want to leave.
It's the most important thing to me.

384
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:16,965
I know.

385
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,408
First you cry for help,
then you throw sticks at me.

386
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:21,884
A ship comes, a ship!

387
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:26,548
The first ship we've seen
since we've been here and you let it go by.

388
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:29,096
Well, that's it. I've had it.

389
00:54:29,285 --> 00:54:31,719
I'm sick and tired
of waiting for you to get better.

390
00:54:31,954 --> 00:54:34,070
I'm going to San Fr'isco without you.

391
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,791
You'll never build a boat strong enough
to get to San Fr'isco.

392
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:39,941
That's the fourth time you've tried
and they've all sunk.

393
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:41,060
Shut up!

394
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:42,511
Why don't you give up?

395
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:45,212
You don't even know where San Fr'isco is.

396
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:50,983
You're such a silly dodo.
We're never getting off this island.

397
00:55:51,203 --> 00:55:52,636
Thanks to you.

398
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:55,749
This is where we live.
This is our home, now and forever.

399
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:56,992
No!

400
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:59,397
I could never live here forever
with just you.

401
00:55:59,628 --> 00:56:02,188
I don't even like you.
You never used to laugh at me.

402
00:56:02,381 --> 00:56:04,053
You never used to have secrets.

403
00:56:04,216 --> 00:56:06,889
You're not so perfect either,
Mr. Richard Lestrange.

404
00:56:07,094 --> 00:56:08,686
I've seen you playing with it.

405
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:11,234
And I'll tell your father
if he ever gets here.

406
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:13,069
You. I hate you.

407
00:56:15,144 --> 00:56:16,463
You almost hit me.

408
00:56:16,603 --> 00:56:19,356
- Take back what you said.
- I've seen it all.

409
00:56:19,565 --> 00:56:21,521
What happens after you do it a long time.

410
00:56:21,693 --> 00:56:23,649
Shut up! That isn't fair, peeking.

411
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:25,377
- I don't peek on you.
- That's a lie.

412
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,361
You're always staring at my buppies.

413
00:56:27,532 --> 00:56:30,569
Only because they look so funny.
You know what you look like now?

414
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:32,901
You look like
one of those pictures Paddy had.

415
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:34,797
One of his Hoochie Coochie girls.

416
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:35,991
I do not!

417
00:56:39,044 --> 00:56:41,512
Stop that, or I'll never talk to you again.

418
00:56:43,173 --> 00:56:45,164
See them jiggle, wiggle and shake.

419
00:56:47,677 --> 00:56:50,475
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.

420
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:54,621
I wish you were dead and buried.

421
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:04,335
What are you doing?

422
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,404
It's my hut. I built it.

423
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:14,614
That's not true. I helped you.

424
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:17,542
I did most of it.
You can find some other place to live.

425
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,220
I said I was sorry, Richard.
What more do you want me to say?

426
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:23,851
I don't want you to say anything.

427
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:29,269
I don't ever want to see you again.

428
00:57:30,471 --> 00:57:33,747
You just wait, Richard Lestrange.
I'll get you for this!

429
00:58:42,336 --> 00:58:44,167
What's wrong with you?

430
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,068
Go away.

431
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,311
What happened?

432
00:58:55,016 --> 00:58:58,531
I stepped on one of those fish
that looks like a rock.

433
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:06,592
Don't go to sleep.

434
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,918
Oh, no. Please wake up.

435
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:13,353
God.

436
00:59:16,205 --> 00:59:17,718
Take me to God.

437
00:59:18,832 --> 00:59:20,231
But the law...

438
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:25,302
God...

439
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:29,287
please don't make Em never wake up.

440
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,045
I didn't mean it when I said
I wanted her dead and buried.

441
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:38,217
I forgot most of my prayers, God...

442
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:41,572
But...

443
01:00:46,046 --> 01:00:47,638
Our Father...

444
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:51,897
who art in heaven...

445
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,539
kingdom come...

446
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:10,886
with liberty and justice for all.

447
01:01:11,323 --> 01:01:12,312
Amen.

448
01:01:38,267 --> 01:01:39,939
Em, are you all right?

449
01:01:42,354 --> 01:01:43,992
I've been so worried.

450
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:49,293
You mean, you're not mad at me anymore?

451
01:01:49,612 --> 01:01:51,091
Of course not.

452
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:55,041
I was so scared.

453
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:02,251
All I could think of was:

454
01:02:05,044 --> 01:02:06,762
What if I lost my Em?

455
01:02:10,925 --> 01:02:12,517
What would I do?

456
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:50,814
Here's some food
to help you get your strength back.

457
01:02:55,055 --> 01:02:57,444
Do you see that island out there?

458
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,376
Yes.

459
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:03,299
I've been thinking, maybe the person
who makes the drum noise...

460
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:06,274
lives there and then comes here to pray.

461
01:03:07,776 --> 01:03:08,925
Maybe.

462
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:12,508
Would you like to try to walk?

463
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:29,115
You all right?

464
01:03:29,674 --> 01:03:30,743
Yes.

465
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:16,967
Kiss me.

466
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:19,205
You're all sticky.

467
01:05:19,535 --> 01:05:21,412
So what? Kiss me.

468
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:28,052
Stop it, I can't breath.

469
01:05:28,252 --> 01:05:30,243
But I don't want to stop.

470
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,518
What are you doing?

471
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:43,704
Stop it.

472
01:06:01,328 --> 01:06:03,558
I feel so funny in my stomach.

473
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:08,730
Me, too.

474
01:06:14,134 --> 01:06:16,204
My heart is beating so fast.

475
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,416
Mine, too.

476
01:12:43,324 --> 01:12:45,792
Will you stop eating? You're getting fat.

477
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:51,981
Come on up, keep me warm?

478
01:13:13,772 --> 01:13:15,410
Where's Em, Coco?

479
01:13:53,938 --> 01:13:55,656
I'm sorry, Richard.

480
01:13:55,857 --> 01:13:58,325
You didn't want it all
day yesterday either.

481
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:01,085
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?

482
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:04,032
Yes, I love you more than ever, Richard.

483
01:14:04,532 --> 01:14:06,602
Then why don't you want to do it?

484
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:09,925
It just hurts right now, that's all.

485
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:13,442
When it stops hurting, we'll do it.

486
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,456
When is that going to be?

487
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:21,303
I don't understand. Why does it hurt?

488
01:14:22,259 --> 01:14:23,692
I don't know.

489
01:14:24,177 --> 01:14:26,008
I don't know anything.

490
01:14:29,683 --> 01:14:32,641
But if you touch my tummy right now,
you can feel it.

491
01:14:35,273 --> 01:14:36,422
Feel what?

492
01:14:41,946 --> 01:14:44,255
How did you make
your tummy move like that?

493
01:14:44,449 --> 01:14:46,087
I'm not doing it.

494
01:14:47,118 --> 01:14:49,268
It's not doing it by itself.

495
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:51,223
Yes, it is.

496
01:14:53,123 --> 01:14:55,079
There. I felt it again.

497
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:57,742
What's making it do that?

498
01:14:59,088 --> 01:15:00,521
I don't know.

499
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:36,980
Where are you?

500
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:46,177
Where are you?

501
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,849
What's wrong? Did they hurt you?

502
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:07,687
They?

503
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:25,270
What is it? Tell me what to do.

504
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:26,820
What is it?

505
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,455
Answer me.

506
01:19:35,038 --> 01:19:36,676
Why did you have a baby?

507
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,973
I don't know.

508
01:19:43,714 --> 01:19:45,113
Hello, baby.

509
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,596
Look, I think he's hungry.

510
01:19:58,896 --> 01:20:00,693
What do you feed him?

511
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:02,539
Try some fruit.

512
01:20:04,109 --> 01:20:05,508
Here you go.

513
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,831
Good food. Fruit.

514
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,292
It doesn't like it.

515
01:20:12,827 --> 01:20:14,624
Here, let me try this.

516
01:20:24,172 --> 01:20:25,605
What do I do?

517
01:21:07,049 --> 01:21:08,607
Why are you doing that?

518
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,159
The drum people.

519
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:11,502
What?

520
01:21:13,222 --> 01:21:14,291
I saw them.

521
01:21:14,765 --> 01:21:15,834
When?

522
01:21:15,974 --> 01:21:17,646
The night he came.

523
01:21:18,728 --> 01:21:20,320
What did they look like?

524
01:21:20,604 --> 01:21:23,072
I don't want to talk about it.
Paddy was right.

525
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:25,151
We shouldn't have gone to the other side.

526
01:21:25,318 --> 01:21:27,354
We should have never broken the law.

527
01:21:27,528 --> 01:21:29,917
- Do they know we're here?
- I don't think so.

528
01:21:30,114 --> 01:21:32,469
If they come,
I'll do to them what I do to the fish.

529
01:21:32,659 --> 01:21:34,297
I'll stick it through their eyes!

530
01:21:34,453 --> 01:21:38,571
I'll stick it through their bellies
and watch their guts come out!

531
01:22:05,442 --> 01:22:08,912
Remember on the ship
when we tried to get to the dinghy...

532
01:22:09,529 --> 01:22:12,282
how the men
pushed and shoved each other?

533
01:22:13,993 --> 01:22:15,824
How their eyes looked?

534
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:19,673
It was the same with the drum people.

535
01:22:23,127 --> 01:22:27,723
I don't understand. Why do people
have to be so bad to each other?

536
01:25:49,172 --> 01:25:50,605
Come here, hurry.

537
01:25:51,132 --> 01:25:52,770
I'm busy keeping watch.

538
01:25:53,051 --> 01:25:55,201
Come on, you have to see this.

539
01:26:20,496 --> 01:26:22,407
You taught him to swim.

540
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:27,258
Water.

541
01:27:31,193 --> 01:27:32,672
Look at the fishies.

542
01:27:34,363 --> 01:27:36,240
Around the tree and back down the hole.

543
01:27:41,162 --> 01:27:42,595
Get the boat.

544
01:28:33,924 --> 01:28:37,041
Look at the bird. Look, Paddy.

545
01:28:43,809 --> 01:28:46,164
Do you see some fishies?
What do you see?

546
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:48,443
Tell me, do you see a ship?

547
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,593
Paddy, fan.

548
01:29:02,995 --> 01:29:04,223
Richard.

549
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:06,845
He said my name.

550
01:29:13,298 --> 01:29:15,892
Look, Paddy, we're making footprints.

551
01:29:16,259 --> 01:29:18,011
Like Boston in the winter.

552
01:29:18,178 --> 01:29:21,773
Remember the snowball fights we had
every time it snowed?

553
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,232
See, it's freezing.

554
01:29:29,273 --> 01:29:30,592
It's cold.

555
01:29:36,447 --> 01:29:38,517
The bogeyman.

556
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:56,601
You better bring him up to see
or he'll hear about it from the crew...

557
01:29:56,842 --> 01:29:59,436
and we'll have to sail back tomorrow.

558
01:30:00,429 --> 01:30:01,657
Excuse me, sir.

559
01:30:01,847 --> 01:30:03,644
We sighted something.

560
01:30:09,397 --> 01:30:10,625
There.

561
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,992
What do you think?

562
01:30:14,194 --> 01:30:15,832
Can we go closer?

563
01:30:16,822 --> 01:30:19,973
I'll see,
but we have to be careful of that reef.

564
01:30:29,084 --> 01:30:30,483
Look at that face.

565
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:34,412
Boat.

566
01:31:12,171 --> 01:31:14,207
No, that couldn't be them.

567
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:53,015
Do you know how to get to
the place where we lived with Paddy?

568
01:31:53,254 --> 01:31:55,643
Sure. I go there for bananas.

569
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,273
Take me there?

570
01:31:57,925 --> 01:31:59,517
I thought you were afraid.

571
01:31:59,677 --> 01:32:01,588
I want to see it again.

572
01:32:04,432 --> 01:32:05,751
In you go.

573
01:32:42,471 --> 01:32:43,824
You coming?

574
01:35:31,561 --> 01:35:32,710
Shark!

575
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,638
I have to get the oars.

576
01:36:00,382 --> 01:36:02,293
Help me, Em, we're drifting.

577
01:36:06,931 --> 01:36:08,364
Go away.

578
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:19,186
Look how far out we are!

579
01:36:37,837 --> 01:36:39,509
I can't stop this.

580
01:37:21,423 --> 01:37:22,651
Paddy, look.

581
01:37:23,091 --> 01:37:25,366
When it hits the water,
you can hear it hiss.

582
01:37:25,554 --> 01:37:26,873
Look, see?

583
01:37:27,013 --> 01:37:28,241
Hear it?

584
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:43,822
I'm thirsty.

585
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:46,294
I wish we had some water.

586
01:38:05,093 --> 01:38:06,287
Fishies.

587
01:38:10,057 --> 01:38:12,173
No, Paddy!

588
01:38:12,643 --> 01:38:15,362
- Where did you get those?
- Get those out of your mouth.

589
01:38:15,562 --> 01:38:19,680
What are you doing?
Get those out of your mouth.

590
01:38:26,574 --> 01:38:28,246
He swallowed some.

591
01:38:44,259 --> 01:38:45,578
Come here.

592
01:38:56,562 --> 01:38:58,314
Don't close your eyes, Paddy.

593
01:38:58,482 --> 01:39:00,473
Please don't go to sleep.

594
01:39:11,036 --> 01:39:12,025
Please.

595
01:40:53,475 --> 01:40:57,434
Three points to port, sir.
Looks to be a small craft.

596
01:40:58,104 --> 01:40:59,457
See anyone in it?

597
01:40:59,898 --> 01:41:01,650
I can't make it out.

598
01:41:04,152 --> 01:41:07,064
Captain, three points to port.

599
01:42:14,349 --> 01:42:15,828
Are they dead?

600
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,431
No, sir. They're asleep.
