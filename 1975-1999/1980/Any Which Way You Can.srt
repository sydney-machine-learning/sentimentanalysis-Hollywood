1
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,103
How would you like to have
your goddamn rig impounded?

2
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,480
Sorry, officer. My hand slipped.

3
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:33,045
Hey! You better get ready
to hock your tricycle, Jack.

4
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,215
Yeah? Let's see your money, big mouth.

5
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,469
-Two hundred on Philo!
-You're covered!

6
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,729
I'll go handle this.

7
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,947
-Put all of it on him. Put all of it on him.
-I got it.

8
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,951
Twelve hundred dollars.

9
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,535
Twelve hundred.

10
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,413
MAN 1:
Fifty dollars on Philo.

11
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,123
MAN 2: What's your name?
-Boys!

12
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,418
-Got 1 200 more on Philo!
-You're covered!

13
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,257
You know,
we're covering over $8000 here so far.

14
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,842
We'll eat him for breakfast.

15
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,055
Hell, Joe whipped every Marine
in the 1st Division.

16
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,390
Yeah.

17
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,016
But he ain't a Marine.

18
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,234
-Jesus, he's big.
-Yeah, he's sizeable.

19
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,861
ORVILLE: They said he beat everybody
in the Marine Corps.

20
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,947
I ain't a Marine.

21
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,783
I got 2800 from the boys in Bakersfield.

22
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,870
-You're covered.
-All right!

23
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,668
You lose this fight, we'll be patrolling
Death Valley for the next five years.

24
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,796
Don't worry about it, sarge.
Eat him up, Joe.

25
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,673
Eat him up, Joe. Ha-ha-ha!

26
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,800
Take care of Clyde, will you?

27
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,594
You know how he likes
to crap in squad cars.

28
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,533
Hold it, hold it.

29
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,991
Okay, Joe. All right!

30
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,077
Come on!

31
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,469
He's killing him.

32
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,680
-Come on, boy.
-He's moving pretty good for a corpse.

33
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,850
MAN:
Come on, get in there! Let's go!

34
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,228
-Get in!
-Come on!

35
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,159
Attaboy!

36
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,154
WOMAN:
Get him, baby!

37
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,572
Bingo!

38
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,581
WOMAN:
Get up, Philo! You got him!

39
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,027
All right. That's it.

40
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,780
-He ain't down yet.
-No, he ain't and I ain't putting him down.

41
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,450
If you want to take his place,
we can arrange that.

42
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,411
-Fight ain't over till he's down.
-Shut up.

43
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,088
ORVILLE:
Great. You got him.

44
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,508
-How much we pull down?
-Twelve hundred.

45
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,135
Where's Clyde?

46
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,013
-Shit.
-There.

47
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,358
Clyde, you got damn little respect
for the law.

48
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,194
God.

49
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,416
Sergeant Smith.

50
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,765
This is gonna be my last fight.

51
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,642
How come?

52
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,477
Right turn, Clyde.

53
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,402
I'm getting to like the pain.

54
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,409
-Well, I guess it's time, then.
-Yeah, I think.

55
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,371
I don't understand it.
I whipped every Marine in my division.

56
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,791
-Some real tough guys.
SMITH: Jesus.

57
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,712
-How can you stand the stench?
-I can't smell nothing.

58
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,260
The captain won't really transfer us,
will he, sarge?

59
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,680
Seeing as how we flushed 2800
of his hard-earned bucks...

60
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,308
...it's Death Valley, son,
you can believe me.

61
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,476
Some real tough guys.

62
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,694
Hey. Pull those guys over!
They're littering!

63
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,112
Shut up, will you?

64
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,060
Pardon me, sir, was that, uh, 3000?

65
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,063
No, it is not 3000.

66
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,776
Mr. Paoli bets 30,000 on the challenger?

67
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,156
-Ha! That's it! That's it!
-He never touched him!

68
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,867
Your animal's gonna be dead
in 15 seconds.

69
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,664
BEEKMAN:
Young man.

70
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,958
Keep your terrier in his cage, Beekman.

71
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,003
Junior, he's only looking out
for my interests, that's all.

72
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,092
-Your money will be here by 5 p.m.
-I expected no less.

73
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,733
Whoo!

74
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,404
-Hey, did you set up a fight for Wilson?
-No, not yet.

75
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,281
Well, come on.

76
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,951
What the hell am I paying him
5 grand a month, to sit on his hands?

77
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,661
Nobody will take him on.

78
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,789
Not after what he did
to those last couple of guys.

79
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,418
Yeah, well, maybe we ought to, uh,
set up a match...

80
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,503
...between Wilson and the rattler, huh?
Ha, ha.

81
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,214
Ha, ha. You'd lose a good rattler.

82
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,343
There is a guy on the West Coast
named Philo Beddoe.

83
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,929
Philo Beddoe. I never heard of him.

84
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,098
Some folks in Dallas think a lot of him.

85
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,100
Yeah? Which folks?

86
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,853
The folks that bet.
And he's well-known in California.

87
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,482
I think we could get a good piece
of action on this one, Jim.

88
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,778
-All right. You set it up.
-All right.

89
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,792
Well, Loretta, we've talked about it
for 20 years, but now we're doing it.

90
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,711
We're in California.

91
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,672
I hear people here are a little peculiar.

92
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,885
Oh, Loretta, folks are just folks
the world over.

93
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,435
-Luther.
-Yeah?

94
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,812
I think we should go back to Iowa.

95
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,003
LYNNE [SINGING]:
Then your whiskey eyes undress me

96
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,714
As we hide the night away

97
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,467
I know it's wrong to want you

98
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,345
But God knows it feels so right

99
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,181
Just stay a little longer

100
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,642
Before you go to her tonight

101
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,936
There's one too many women in your life

102
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,898
-You didn't tell me she was here.
-I didn't know. We can go.

103
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,692
No, it's all right.

104
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,366
There's one too many women in your life

105
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,704
The one you say you love

106
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,832
And the one you call your wife

107
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,343
You tell me you don't love her

108
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,305
And you say someday you'll leave

109
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:37,060
Then when our love starts feelin' right
You walk away from me

110
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:42,357
Bedroom lies and alibis
Are the only words you know

111
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:47,279
Just tell me that you love me
Before you have to go

112
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:52,284
There's one too many women in your life

113
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,456
Neither one of us can make it right

114
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,337
There's one too many women in your life

115
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,927
Lynne Halsey-Taylor,
ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,847
Let's have a big welcome
for Johnny Duncan.

117
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,857
[SINGING]
It's raining on the west coast

118
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,735
Snowing in Topeka

119
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:31,365
The weatherman says there's ice
For old Tennessee

120
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,700
Mind if I sit here?

121
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,245
No. It's a free country.

122
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,499
You're still mad at me, I guess.

123
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,835
No, I like having my guts kicked out.

124
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,216
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I-- I was mixed up.

125
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,759
Oh?

126
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,761
What do you think I was?

127
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,262
I'm sorry.

128
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,598
But that's in the past.

129
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,725
Yeah, it sure is.

130
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,648
You want me to leave?

131
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,526
Yeah.

132
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,331
DUNCAN [SINGING]:
I see a loser in my mirror

133
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,626
Got a devil in my brain

134
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,087
And the woman I've been loving

135
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,507
All right, Clyde, keep your pants on.
I'm coming.

136
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:35,387
DUNCAN:
She left blossom in my bedroom

137
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,515
And dirty dishes in my sink

138
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,394
I knew you and Philo came in here a lot.

139
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,648
So I told them I'd sing for nothing
just to get a chance to talk to him.

140
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,859
Guess I shouldn't have bothered, huh?

141
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,862
I don't like drinking with filthy apes.

142
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,780
Clyde is a clean ape.

143
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,367
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna
kick his ass out of here.

144
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,788
If I was you, friend, I'd just sit back there
and I'd have myself another beer.

145
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,250
-You ain't me.
-No.

146
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,802
-I'll have another beer.
-Right.

147
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,389
Looks like Clyde's getting a little rowdy.
We better get out of here.

148
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,442
You're getting rowdy, Clyde.

149
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:35,363
-Why don't you leave Philo alone, honey?
-I'm not your honey.

150
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,534
Listen, he was down for two months
after you pushed him over.

151
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,661
So was I.

152
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:47,250
The three of us are doing fine now
so why don't you just leave him alone?

153
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,558
Clyde, come on, let's go.
Leave the bananas alone. Come on.

154
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,480
Kind of grows on you, doesn't he?

155
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,526
There's gotta be a better way

156
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,947
But the sun shines bright

157
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,200
In Acapulco

158
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,329
And there's no snow

159
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,415
In old Monterey

160
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,214
MEN:
We are the Black Widows!

161
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,342
Then who stomped a mud hole in you?

162
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,302
ALL:
Philo Beddoe!

163
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,390
Then spat on you,
and let his ape stomp it dry?

164
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,559
ALL:
Philo Beddoe!

165
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,895
So whose hide you gonna nail
to the gates of hell?

166
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,689
ALL:
Philo Beddoe's!

167
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,943
All right, then, let's start doing
some stomping of our own.

168
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,444
Yeah.

169
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,781
Good grief, my brownies are burning.

170
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,289
-His what?
-He's baking brownies.

171
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,258
Why me, Lord?

172
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,013
I mean, you made other men out of clay.

173
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,349
Mine, you made out of shit.

174
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,983
-I should have expected it.
-Expected what, Ma?

175
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:41,448
Quitting your job, letting an old lady
die of frostbite, canker sores.

176
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,743
It ain't froze around here in 30 years, Ma.

177
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,828
Don't have to freeze.

178
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,039
I got thin blood.

179
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,959
Besides, I didn't quit my job.
Fighting ain't my job.

180
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,377
Yeah.

181
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,464
Well, I have to admit, it ain't much.

182
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,134
But it's the closest you've come
to earning a decent living.

183
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,095
But, hell, you don't care
about keeping a roof...

184
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,807
...over a poor, helpless old lady's head.

185
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,226
You don't care
if she has to eat dog food.

186
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,813
You don't care
if she has to soak her teeth in Clorox.

187
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:20,403
Come back here with my Oreos,
you hairy ass!

188
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,414
-I'm looking for Mr. Philo Beddoe.
PHILO: You're talking to him.

189
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,086
-I'm talking to his feet.
PHILO: The top half of him can hear you.

190
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,880
I represent a man
who would like to back you, Mr. Beddoe.

191
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,216
See that crescent wrench
up on top there?

192
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,177
Yes, I see it.

193
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,513
Well, why don't you hand it to me?

194
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,182
Tail first, of course.
The jaws may be venomous.

195
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,479
Thanks.

196
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,440
-Back me at what?
-A fight?

197
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,694
-Sorry, I'm retired.
-Since when?

198
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,029
Since I decided to retire.

199
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:08,243
My employer is willing to pay you
$15,000 for this fight, Mr. Beddoe.

200
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,915
-Against who?
-A man named Jack Wilson.

201
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,293
-You know Wilson?
-I know of him.

202
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,047
Let's not quibble, Mr. Beddoe.
Twenty-five thousand.

203
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:33,893
-Is that win or lose, or just win?
-The money will be payable, win or lose.

204
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,772
Ten thousand in advance.

205
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,111
-Give it to Clyde.
-Yes.

206
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,614
-Who's Clyde?
-He's my manager.

207
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,743
Ah, Jesus Christ!

208
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,372
-Don't worry, he won't hurt you.
-You want me to give $10,000 to an ape?

209
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,249
He handles all my business.

210
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,044
You stash that, Clyde,
and don't let Ma see you.

211
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,628
MAN:
Good boy.

212
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,797
Good boy.

213
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,018
I'll be in touch.

214
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,729
Yeah, I'm sure.

215
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,317
MAN [OVER CB]: You there, Harry?
HARRY: Yeah, what do you got?

216
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,319
MAN:
Dead battery at Sunset and Lincoln.

217
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,237
Green '73 Chevrolet.

218
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,656
HARRY:
Got it. Be about 20 minutes.

219
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,039
Twenty minutes is too late by half, Harry.

220
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:50,553
Hang on there, green Chevy.
Harry's on the way.

221
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,724
Have you seen Clyde?

222
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,520
No. Is he gone?

223
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,605
Well, a couple hours.

224
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,609
-Is he in the shed?
-I'll take another look.

225
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:10,949
No hairy-ass jungle jumper...

226
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,577
...is going to outsmart Senovia Boggs.

227
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:19,666
That goddamn banana-head
probably ate it.

228
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,334
Send him down to that....

229
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:28,424
Work and slave for that ape of yours.
Work and slave.

230
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:32,303
Well, I appreciate that, Ma.
You haven't seen him, have you?

231
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,931
No. No, I ain't seen him.

232
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,107
I'll find it. You better believe I'll find it.

233
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:50,572
[SINGING] Am I being too tender
Or are you just too tough?

234
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,910
Right now I'm feeling
Like I've had enough

235
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:01,749
If I've been all wrong
Instead of all right

236
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,794
Either your love's too loose

237
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:09,257
Or mine is too tight

238
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,886
When the wheel of fortune spins again

239
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,888
I plan to be a winner

240
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,394
Does the magic in your eyes disguise
A saint or just a sinner?

241
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:27,275
Playing your game
Is one hell of a gamble

242
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:33,406
You're too loose to love
And you're too hot to handle

243
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:43,291
Am I being too weak
When I need to be strong?

244
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:48,421
Hanging around here
After your love is gone

245
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,133
Has it all been a lie?

246
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,303
Or am I thinking small?

247
00:25:55,471 --> 00:26:00,433
I love all the way
Or I don't love at all

248
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,605
When the wheel of fortune spins again

249
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,191
I plan to be a winner

250
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:14,447
Does the magic in your eyes disguise
A saint or just a sinner?

251
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,911
-You seen Clyde?
-Yeah. Right behind you, Philo.

252
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,917
You're too loose to love
And you're too hot to handle

253
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,302
Lynne Halsey-Taylor,
ladies and gentlemen.

254
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,264
Now let's everybody get ready
for Fats Domino.

255
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:51,067
[SINGING]
Every afternoon when I wake up

256
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:55,238
I say a little prayer and drink up

257
00:26:55,948 --> 00:27:01,786
And thank the Lord
For driving me home once more

258
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,542
He ain't supposed to be, uh, out like this.

259
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,838
What did I do? I was just singing a number
and he came in and sat down.

260
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,425
He probably got lost
and recognized this place.

261
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,179
Maybe he wanted to see me.
Not everybody hates me, you know.

262
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,392
I don't hate you.

263
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:29,814
I can take just about any kind of pain.
There's just one I have no tolerance for.

264
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,860
Some kinds I can't tolerate either.

265
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,536
You gotta do another set?

266
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:48,666
Uh, no, I'm just doing one set a night.
They're all here to see Fats.

267
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,335
-You sound good.
-Thank you.

268
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,544
Real good.

269
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,340
DOMINO [SINGING]:
Hangovers every day

270
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:01,429
Flyin' high with honky-tonk angels

271
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,516
In whiskey heaven

272
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,394
Do you have any wheels?

273
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,646
No.

274
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,359
I'll give you a ride home. If you like.

275
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,320
I like.

276
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,573
Okay. Let's go.

277
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,451
In whiskey heaven

278
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:29,457
We drink a little beer and wine

279
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:34,212
Stay drunk most of the time

280
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:41,010
We're always raisin' hell all night
In whiskey heaven

281
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:49,936
This is it?

282
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,231
-Anything wrong with it?
-No. Not a thing.

283
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,361
-Well, I guess I can't ask you in.
-I guess not.

284
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,161
Good night, Clyde.

285
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,501
Thanks, Philo.

286
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,694
Shut up, meathead.

287
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,411
Hey! It's Philo Beddoe!

288
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,746
Are we bad mothers?

289
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,291
ALL:
We are bad mothers!

290
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,647
Hey, Beddoe, it's us.

291
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,194
Are you talking to me?

292
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,948
I ain't talking to you, Beddoe.
I'm reading your death warrant.

293
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,160
I didn't know you boys could read.

294
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,829
Oh. Now, that's real cute, real cute.

295
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,208
We're gonna kill you slow, boy.
Take maybe a week.

296
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,544
Well, I wouldn't want to rush you.

297
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,964
After the first day, I think,
you're probably gonna be shaking...

298
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,133
...like some blind faggot
at a weenie roast.

299
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,389
You got him real good, Cholla.
You got him real good with that one.

300
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,891
Shut your hole.

301
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:59,524
Except this time,
it ain't gonna be no weenie roast.

302
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,027
No, this time it's gonna be
an ape roast.

303
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,113
Right turn, Clyde.

304
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,798
Hey, Cholla, they're getting away.

305
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,468
Why me?

306
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,351
Ah, what the hell.

307
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,104
I guess maybe it's time.

308
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,281
She's in Room 25,
but you can't go up there.

309
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,533
No, ma'am, I know that.

310
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,579
-You're not allowed up there!
-I won't be long, ma'am.

311
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,502
Operator, get me the police.

312
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,673
Oh. Excuse me, ma'am.

313
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,510
Hey, wait a minute.

314
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,805
Excuse me, ma'am,
I didn't see a thing, hardly.

315
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,225
-You aren't allowed up here.
-I know that, ma'am.

316
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,813
LYNNE: Who is it?
-Philo.

317
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,650
You're not allowed up here.

318
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,321
Must be true. You're the third person
who's told me that.

319
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,118
Well?

320
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,538
Well, we've got an extra room
at the house.

321
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,499
I don't need any handouts.

322
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,669
Handouts are what you get
from the government.

323
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,755
A hand up is what you get from friends.

324
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,424
Are you a friend?

325
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,634
I'm a friend.

326
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:58,392
Well, I don't have so many friends
that I can afford to lose one.

327
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,569
What is it?

328
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,447
Sorry, ma'am.

329
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,087
I believe what we got here, ladies,
is a case of wishful thinking.

330
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:30,466
They all think we moon around all day,
lusting after their bodies.

331
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,968
Well, some of us do, Rita.

332
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,040
Where's Clyde?

333
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,004
Shit.

334
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,426
So how are you gonna
write this one up?

335
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,469
I'm not. Plus, you were a lot of help.

336
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:19,181
You can always say she was nuts
about your toothpaste smile.

337
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,478
You could bust them
for harassing an officer.

338
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,564
-Just shut up.
-Ha-ha-ha!

339
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,649
OFFICER 1:
Hey.

340
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,776
It's them!

341
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,877
-Come on, come on! We can catch them!
-You catch them.

342
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,924
So where are you gonna sleep?

343
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,178
We have a guest room out back,
I told you.

344
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,847
-Good night.
-Good night.

345
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,212
Clyde, you still up?

346
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,182
What are you doing, pal?

347
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,559
An Oreo cookie for me?

348
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,562
I'll save mine till later.

349
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,272
Night, buddy.

350
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,618
-Mind if I come in?
-No, not at all.

351
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,920
What was that?

352
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,716
Just a cookie I was saving till later.

353
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,636
Well, never mind.

354
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,638
You can have me instead.

355
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,018
No looking, now. Hmm.

356
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,516
LYNNE:
Oh.

357
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,894
We chased him away.

358
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:14,982
Ah, the fresh air's good for him.
Besides, he'll guard the door.

359
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,401
Is he reliable?

360
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,155
Anything gets past Clyde
is 40 feet high with fangs.

361
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,619
-I think we're safe.
-I think.

362
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,373
I think I love you.

363
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,211
I think that's a piece of luck for me.

364
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,169
Philo?

365
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,216
Jordan said he'd give us 200 big ones
if we scrap that Merc for him.

366
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,262
Great. Clyde, scrap the Merc.

367
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,432
ORVILLE:
Come on, Clyde, you got work to do.

368
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,243
Mind if I jog with you?

369
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,621
Hell no.

370
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:22,336
We must be three miles out.
How much further before you turn back?

371
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,254
A couple more.

372
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,174
That's 10 miles round trip.

373
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,719
-You do this every day?
-More or less.

374
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:36,183
I'm not sure I'm gonna make it.
I'm kind of new to this physical stuff.

375
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,560
You're doing real good.

376
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,648
Thanks. The doc said
I had to get some exercise.

377
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,026
All I do is sit behind a desk all day.

378
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,697
You sit behind it, or you carry it around?

379
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,034
Well, I play a little squash sometimes.

380
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,047
MAN: You look like you do some lifting.
PHILO: A little.

381
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,176
-Mostly engine blocks.
-That'll do the job.

382
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,222
PHILO:
Careful of that soft shoulder there.

383
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,182
That's a hell of a drop.

384
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,520
Hey, you got a pretty good grip
for a new guy.

385
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,689
There's a lot of strength in fear.

386
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,570
-I believe I owe you.
-I believe you do.

387
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,117
Philo.

388
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,746
-You can't do this fight.
-Why not?

389
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:24,249
I've been checking with some people
and I found out who Jack Wilson is.

390
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,670
Look, the fight's gonna get us a new truck,
a new roof, and a few extras for Ma.

391
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,382
-He killed two men last year.
-One.

392
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:37,638
So? The other one's lying someplace with
nothing below the neck but memories.

393
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,848
Well, I told them I was gonna do it.

394
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,559
ORVILLE: I know I don't have
much influence with you anymore...

395
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,771
...since you got a girlfriend,
but damn it, you can't do this!

396
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,940
Well, I'm going to do it.

397
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,610
Don't you go telling Lynne
about Wilson now, you hear?

398
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,570
Damn.

399
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,624
Yeah, Clyde.

400
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,127
Looks like both of us are getting aced.

401
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,129
Yeah.

402
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:16,510
LYNNE & BAND [SINGING]:
There's one too many women in your life

403
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:23,392
The one you say you love
And the one you call your wife

404
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,649
-A friend of yours?
-Yeah.

405
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:35,195
Nice voice. Nice style.

406
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,197
I think so.

407
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,742
There's one too many women in your life

408
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,545
Why don't you get somebody who can sing
around here?

409
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,672
Uh....

410
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,217
-That's not polite.
-Ah, forget it.

411
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,680
MAN: Complaint department's
open now, sonny.

412
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,461
-You play a hell of a game of squash.
-So do you.

413
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,298
-I believe that makes us even.
-I believe it does.

414
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,176
Did you find out what you wanna know?

415
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,095
Yeah, I did.

416
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,139
You're fast and you like pain.

417
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,142
You eat it like candy.

418
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,521
I've seen a few cases like that
in my time.

419
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,899
The more they get hurt,
the more dangerous they become.

420
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,737
But you gotta be durable too.
Real durable.

421
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,323
Most ain't.

422
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,077
Yeah, you're right. Most ain't.

423
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,663
Let's call this fight off.
There's no point.

424
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,291
I ain't doing it for points.

425
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:01,758
You're good,
but you're not good enough.

426
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,721
I....

427
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,810
I don't wanna hurt you,
and that's the truth.

428
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,106
Sometimes we can't always do
what we want to. Right?

429
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,526
-Yeah.
-Your money's no good here.

430
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,029
Well, thank you.

431
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,243
-Pleasure watching you work.
-Same here.

432
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,293
Who was that?

433
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:43,008
That was a friend of mine.
We used to play squash sometimes.

434
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,725
[SINGING] The good guys always say
That crime doesn't pay

435
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:56,480
But for some men there's no other way

436
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:01,485
The bad guys always claim
Both sides are the same

437
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,906
The good guys and the bad guys

438
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,798
I don't want you to fight.

439
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,845
You too? I thought you weren't
supposed to say anything to her.

440
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,223
I thought she'd have more influence.

441
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:34,434
LYNNE:
Don't do it, Philo.

442
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,562
-I'm doing it, and that's the end of it.
-But he kills people.

443
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,649
The subject ain't open for discussion.

444
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:45,612
Go ahead, get yourself killed,
you selfish lunkhead.

445
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,614
Better still.

446
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,952
Let him scramble your brains
and turn you into a turnip...

447
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,122
...so I can spend the next 20 years
watering you.

448
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,794
You too?

449
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,504
All right.

450
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,965
All right. Clyde, go get the money.

451
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:08,843
Go ahead.

452
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,764
PHILO:
Orville.

453
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:18,228
Here's the card. Call that guy,
tell him to come and get his dough.

454
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,118
MA:
Under my own mattress. Humiliating.

455
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:37,330
Outsmarted by a banana-head.

456
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:41,918
Hey.

457
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:45,338
I just spent the last five hours
on a very bumpy airplane, Mr. Beddoe.

458
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:46,715
I'm not in a good mood.

459
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,094
-I don't blame you.
-We have a deal, Mr. Beddoe.

460
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:54,764
We had a deal.
Clyde, get the man his money back.

461
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,976
One does not cancel deals
with James Beekman.

462
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:02,188
One takes one's money back,
or else Clyde gets bugged at one.

463
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,482
I am holding it for you, Mr. Beddoe.

464
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,236
I will add 15,000 to it and give it to you
when you show up for the fight.

465
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,364
Bear this in mind:
What Wilson will do to you is nothing...

466
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,618
...compared to what we will do
if you don't show up for the fight.

467
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,495
Clyde, escort the man out.

468
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,665
You will have a visit
from my friends very soon.

469
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,876
Will they be driving Cadillacs too?

470
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,211
Yes. Long and black.

471
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,506
Clyde, scrap the Caddie.

472
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:32,677
MAN:
Oh, Jesus!

473
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,205
Oh, Jesus!

474
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,604
MAN:
Oh, God!

475
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:32,821
He's crazy.

476
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,708
How about we go up to Bakersfield
and mess around for a couple days?

477
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:49,212
No, thank you. I'm not Clyde.
I can't sit around eating bananas...

478
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,465
...while you and the broad
are playing patty cake.

479
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:56,261
-Hey, she's not a broad.
-I know that.

480
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,888
Damn it, I'm just talking mad.

481
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,309
You're allowed to talk mad to your friends,
you know, if they are.

482
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,271
They are, and you're allowed.

483
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,817
Shit.

484
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,570
She's a real nice girl.

485
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:15,488
I know.

486
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,324
-A piece of luck.
-I think.

487
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,162
But I don't have to like it.

488
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,664
Hell no. I wouldn't either.

489
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,459
-You wouldn't?
-Uh-uh.

490
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,506
Maybe I ought to get
really mad at you, then.

491
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,014
You better go before
he goes down the block again...

492
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:42,807
...after that lady Saint Bernard.

493
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,770
Jesus, I never saw a dog
turn gray overnight before.

494
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,024
That's enough.
Come on, you'll get plastered.

495
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,984
Bakersfield. Let's go.

496
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:56,780
-You take care, now.
-All right. You too.

497
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,365
Okay, Clyde.

498
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,884
Seems like Orville's
not very happy these days.

499
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,971
I know. I guess he thinks
you're taking up some of his space.

500
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,934
-But I can't give it back to him.
-I know.

501
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,944
Hang on.

502
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,270
-Uh-oh.
-No!

503
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,458
PHILO:
Lock the doors.

504
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,357
Cholla, I'm hardening.

505
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,484
I'm hardening too.

506
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,362
Shut up and get him! Move!

507
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,243
I'm froze.

508
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,786
CHOLLA:
Dead meat, Beddoe.

509
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:12,081
Dead meat.

510
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:21,799
Oh, you're gonna pay for this.
You're gonna pay.

511
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,436
What are you going to do with them?

512
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:38,358
Well, we can't leave them here.
Dogs would come along and piss on them.

513
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,526
Ain't fair to the dogs.

514
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,196
CHOLLA:
You'll pay for that too, Beddoe.

515
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:53,081
-Will you be able to get this stuff off?
-Sure. We'll just peel them like bananas.

516
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,708
Of course, that tar will take
their hair off with it.

517
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,211
-Oh. Painful?
-Moderately.

518
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:02,256
-Too bad.
-Both of you are really gonna pay for this.

519
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,509
I already am paying for it.

520
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:09,222
It's $20 for this tow boom
and another 20 I'm adding on...

521
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,766
...for cleaning up my truck.
That's $40 you owe me.

522
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,359
We should be back
in 15, 20 minutes, I hope.

523
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,153
LYNNE: Good luck.
PHILO: Come on, Clyde. Scrap the gate.

524
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:41,754
Despite your irresistible charm, old buddy,
she may have some reservations.

525
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,590
You just feed her this banana
and it'll put her out.

526
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,259
Not more than about 40 minutes.

527
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,429
If that doesn't work,
pop her in the ass and squeeze the bulb.

528
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,888
Got that?

529
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:05,028
Clyde, sometimes I think
you're not too tightly wrapped.

530
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,242
LYNNE: Oh, no. What happened?
PHILO: Ah.

531
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:15,621
I seem to have the only primate
in the country that's a dope addict.

532
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,458
-Be right back.
-Be careful.

533
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:24,964
Well, it's his own damn fault
if I get the wrong one.

534
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:04,796
-Who the hell are you?
-We're looking for Philo Beddoe.

535
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,840
Well, he ain't here. Get out of my house.

536
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,927
Who the hell are you--?

537
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,146
That ain't him. Where is he?

538
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,941
-Why don't you go f--
-Ma.

539
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,485
Where is he?

540
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:31,823
-Uh, Bakersfield.
-Where in Bakersfield?

541
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,199
I don't know.

542
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,495
Um...

543
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:41,040
...he's gonna find a motel
when he gets there.

544
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,385
Orville.

545
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,732
Son of a bitch!

546
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,455
-Looks like you got the right one.
-Yeah.

547
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,624
Come on, Clyde.

548
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,508
Do you think he knows what to do?

549
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,680
Well, there have been primates around
for 80 million years.

550
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:04,767
I don't think they'd set that kind of record
without, uh, knowing something.

551
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,936
I guess not.

552
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,676
What is that?

553
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,221
It's just Clyde showing off.
It's part of the courtship.

554
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:09,040
My God. That's obscene.

555
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,586
Sure sounds obscene.

556
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,758
Hey. Don't I get a courtship?

557
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,926
Well, what do you want me to do?

558
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:27,016
I don't know. Show off a little.
What do you say, big boy?

559
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,277
How's that?

560
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,738
I'm impressed.

561
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,159
Will it hold both of us?

562
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,803
We're leaving this place immediately.
Get up.

563
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,685
Mm.

564
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,312
Savage.

565
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:26,575
Luther.

566
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,832
Luther, stop that.

567
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:35,668
My back!

568
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,003
I've thrown out my back.

569
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,881
Stretch your arms, Luther. Don't tense.

570
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:46,887
Oh. Damn fool. I should've known better.

571
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:51,851
It was very brave, Luther.
That was a heavy chair.

572
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,482
You looked very impressive.

573
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,528
So did you.

574
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,115
It's been a long time.

575
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:57,666
How many?

576
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,880
About a hundred.

577
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,299
Let's go.

578
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,456
Bakersfield.

579
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:14,034
Hey. Get away from there.

580
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:18,831
It ain't right to watch folks
go humpity-bumpity.

581
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,792
Hey, baby.

582
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,799
Oh, my God, what have I done?

583
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:33,345
The first live one in 20 years,
and I disabled him.

584
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:34,805
Oh.

585
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:39,018
-Aw, come on, sweetie.
-Oh.

586
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:43,647
That was just a little tickle
to loosen you up, you know?

587
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:48,193
Now, I tell you what you do.
You get yourself a good eyeful.

588
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,947
Come on. Just look right in.
Enjoy yourself.

589
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:56,076
And then when you're ready
for a little romp...

590
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,203
... I'll be in the office.

01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,919
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha

594
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,556
You know,
I ain't a churchgoing person...

595
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:22,102
...but, I swear,
that's gonna be a thing of a past.

596
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,355
Um, let him be all right.

597
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:29,485
I didn't hit him hard,
he should still have one good one left.

598
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,926
MA:
Sweetie.

599
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,137
Thank you, Lord.

MAN:
That's it.

601
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:27,793
Uh, say, excuse me, officer. Can you tell me
where the Pink Cloud Motel is?

602
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,628
Yeah.

603
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:34,299
Just hang a right out here.
Go down a little bit of ways. Can't miss it.

604
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:43,058
How would you and your girlfriend there
like to race me over?

605
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,224
Come on, guys. Come on.

606
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,588
Philo!

607
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,717
All right, wise guy.

608
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,969
-Which station?
-Fourth Street. Why?

609
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,931
Fourth Street Station!

610
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,687
LORETTA:
What is it, snookums?

611
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,941
Somebody's bashed into our car,
honeybunch.

612
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:18,612
LORETTA: We can always get another car.
Come back to bed, sweetheart.

613
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,248
What's that for?

614
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,833
Just in case.

615
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,636
Here. Take her home. Hurry on back.

616
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,271
You wait here.

617
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,092
Over this way.

618
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,852
That's enough.

619
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:49,429
Thanks, old buddy.
That took guts. I owe you one.

620
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,734
PHILO:
Don't even think about it.

621
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:14,705
-How long has she been like this?
-All morning. Ain't said a word.

622
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:28,260
I suppose you'll have to fight now.

623
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,970
Yeah.

624
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:36,643
I don't think they're gonna hurt her.
I think they just want you to fight.

625
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,020
I know.

626
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:41,857
ORVILLE: Piece of crap, though.
PHILO: Yeah.

627
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,453
She's getting on.

628
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:59,833
I think maybe her brains are, you know,
turning soft.

629
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,003

Yeah?

636
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:38,830
Jackson, Wyoming. Saturday, noon.

637
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,499
Not until I talk to her.

638
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,794
-You are in no position to set conditions.
-You heard me.

639

Nino.

640
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,681
-Philo?
-You okay?

641
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,101
I'm fine.
Don't fight, they don't dare hurt me.

01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,104
MAN: I trust you're not so foolish
as to believe that, Mr. Beddoe.

01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,563
No, I'm not.

644
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:07,234
Lynne, the fight's not your concern.
I'll have you out of there on Saturday.

Philo, listen--

646
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,822
We have a deal, Mr. Beddoe?

647
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:15,450
You'll produce her Saturday noon,
before the fight, right?

648
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,620
Deal.

649
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,873
CHOLLA:
All right, boys. Belly up to the table.

650

Get yourself some hair there.

01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:28,547
And here. Paint on some eyebrows.

01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,022
Cholla, why don't you tell them
to give me what I asked for?

I checked everybody I know,
even the sleazies.

Well, they're probably holding her
somewhere near Jackson.

Oh, Jesus.

01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:11,066
Why don't you just shut up
and start passing out them tickets there?

664
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,401
I ain't got the heart.

665
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,320
You've got enough trouble.

666
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:17,572
CHOLLA:
Wait a minute.

667
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,742
You have to give us them tickets.
You have to.

668
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,411
I mean, didn't you see us?
We're lawbreakers.

669
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,580
I mean, we are totally despicable.

Son, you are a walking violation
of the laws of nature.

672

...and I will carry them...

...all the way from Jerusalem to Jackson,
whichever's closer.

But hear me, Lord.

Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

... I will chew on Philo Beddoe's ass
for my last supper.

680
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,563
Hyah!

681
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:35,150
[SINGING] Yippie-aye-ay
Cow Patti

682
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,736
WOMAN:
I lose.

683
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:41,281
The killer hit town at daybreak
Ate the door off the local saloon

684
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,284
He started to drink you could tell
He was thinking

685
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,202
There'll be a showdown soon

686
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:52,834
Patti hit town in a cloud of dust
Ol' Flame was buzzin' like a saw

687
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,004
And the whole town got
As quiet as a church

688
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,715
When the killer stepped out for the draw

689
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:02,093
Excuse me, sir, there's a call for you.
A Mr. Beekman.

690
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:06,639
Hello, Beeky, it's your dime.

691
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:11,394
Zack? I got a sporting event laid out
for this Saturday.

692
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:15,523
A fire-eater named, uh, Philo Beddoe.
Ha, ha.

693
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,233
Against Jack Wilson.

694
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:20,195
Philo Beddoe? Never heard of him.

695
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,447
Hey, Melvin,
can Beddoe whup Jack Wilson?

696
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:26,993
Beddoe's good, real good,
but I'd have to give Wilson the edge.

697
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:30,747
-How big an edge?
-If it was my money, 7-to-5.

698
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:33,041
But 6-to-5 is a fair bet.

699
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,711
I might be interested in 4-to-1.

700
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,171
Even money, Zack.

701
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,507
Well, I might go 3-to-1.

702
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,550
I've reserved your suite for you.

703
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,427
I'll be there.

704
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:47,972
Yippie-aye-ay, yay
Cow Patti

705
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,476
Yee-haw!
Y'all saddle up. We going on a trip.

706
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,940
Jim Martin and his crew
are coming in from Kansas City.

707
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:58,775
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

708
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:03,947
We got contingents coming in
from Seattle, L.A., Frisco.

709
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,074
Any takers at 6-to-5?

710
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:09,494
Uh, we got about 30 grand.

711
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,037
You know, Jim...

712
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:13,832
...might have to go 2-to-1
we wanna pick up the action, huh?

713
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,668
We'll get enough action at 8-to-5.

714
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:18,044
All right.

715
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:21,131
-I'll call up Boston, set up a layoff.
-No.

716
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,385
No. There's not gonna be a layoff.

717
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,804
Jim.

718
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:30,807
We're liable to get
a couple million bucks on this.

719
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,559
Wilson's not going to lose.

720
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:38,022
We try any funny stuff here,
they're gonna retire us to the Jersey Flats.

721
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:42,193
No, no funny stuff.
I'm telling you, Wilson's gonna take him.

722
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:43,653
Jim.

723
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,072
All we gotta do....

724
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,533
We set up a little layoff.

725
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,077
You and me,
we take a nice 6, 7 percent cut.

726
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:54,080
We walk away, couple hundred grand.
No risk.

727
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:57,167
I'd rather walk away
with a couple of million.

728
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:00,962
Yeah.

729
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:04,048
Yeah, all right.
All right, I'll go along.

730
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:07,218
But if Wilson loses,
you better have snowshoes.

731
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,513
Because north of the Arctic Circle
is the only place we'll be safe.

732
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,767
Welcome to Jackson, Mr. Wilson.
Welcome.

733
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:17,020
It's a great honor to serve you.
Great honor.

734
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:20,064
Uh, I'm going to take you up to the suite
myself. Here, let me take this.

735
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:27,739
Uh, there are three parties in progress,
one of which started yesterday afternoon.

736
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:32,452
If there's anything you need, anything.
The hotel does allows pets in the room.

737
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,537
If you understand my meaning.

738
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,248
I don't keep pets.

739
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:45,215
No pets, no booze.

740
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,968
-I can read.
-And no parties.

741
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:50,929
Oh, that's Aunt Hortense.

742
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:54,807
The last party she was at
was, uh, Teddy Roosevelt's inauguration.

743
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:58,311
-Is she your aunt by blood or marriage?
-Blood.

744
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,397
I'd be careful about having any children
if I were you.

745
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,651
Always am.

746
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:20,792
That's the fifteenth private jet this morning.
What's going on?

747
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,460
Bare-knuckle fight.

748
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,420
California boy named Philo Beddoe...

749
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:27,173
...is taking on some monster
from the East Coast.

750
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:30,301
-I ain't seen anything in the papers.
-Strictly illegal.

751
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:34,264
No referee, and the fight won't end
until one or the other's half dead.

752
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,686
Oh, my God.

753
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:49,529
-I think I'm doing something wrong.
-You're doing just fine, hon.

754
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:53,241
Yeah, but we've been flying upside down
for 15 minutes, Zack.

755
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:58,955
It takes a little time to get the hang of it.
Don't be so hard on yourself, foxy.

756
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,626
It's like that ride at the fair
where everything falls out.

757
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,504
-I hope so.
-Oh, you're terrible.

758
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:09,882
-You can't drink upside down.
-Sure, you can.

759
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,928
-Here, try it.
-All right.

760
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,514
Hey, it worked.

761
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,017
You'd be surprised
what you can do upside down.

762
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,435
-Surprise me.
-Oh!

763
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:27,275
I'll take the south side of town.
You take the north.

764
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,611
-What are we looking for?
-I don't know.

765
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,863
Keep your eyes
out for anything peculiar.

766
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:35,033
And keep Aunt Hortense out of sight,
will you?

767
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,431
Why, you're Philo Beddoe.

768
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,516
PHILO: Yes, ma'am.
-It's him!

769
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:05,104
-Why, he's looking too good.
-Oh. Too good by half.

770
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:06,898
Excuse me, ma'am.

771
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,817
We can't get decent odds on you
looking that good.

772
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,154
We're trying to find some fool
who'll give us 2-to-1.

773
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,823
Try to look a little more peaked,
would you?

774
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,242
Excuse me.

775
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,600
-Oh. Sorry.
-You damn fool!

776
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,727
-Let me see that hand.
-What?

777
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:46,437
Wiggle your fingers.

778
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:51,776
You could have broke that hand
and made paupers out of all of us.

779
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,236
Sorry.

780
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:57,782
What are you standing here gabbing for?
Get on back to jogging.

781
01:23:58,409 --> 01:23:59,701
I think I might do that.

782
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:04,288
Oh, and no booze, no parties.
In bed by 8:00.

783
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,541
You can count on that.

784
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,169
I do.

785
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:13,047
Did y'all see that?

786
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:16,634
The way he grabbed me with one hand
like I was a feather?

787
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:21,973
Son of a gun, boys, we're gonna be rich.

788
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,976
We're already rich, Zack.

789
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:33,776
Mind if I jog with you?

790
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,946
You work for some pretty strange folks.

791
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,866
Who I work for is my business.

792
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:41,993
They got my girl.

793
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,328
Hey, they're running together.

794
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,457
Jesus. Talk about beef on the hook.

795
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,751
MAN:
Wilson will eat him for breakfast.

796
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,712
-I got 40 on Beddoe.
-You're on.

797
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:54,630
I didn't know.

798
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:58,301
I didn't say you did. I just said
you worked for some strange folks.

799
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:00,845
Well, their business isn't mine.

800
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,097
I never said it was.

801
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:07,351
We're even, remember?

802
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:13,775
Uh, yeah.

803
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,276
Oh, Jim.

804
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,403
Tony Paoli's on the way up.

805
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:23,493
-Poor little Tony, he never learns.
-Not junior, senior.

806
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:25,828
-Big Tony?
-Big Tony.

807
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:27,497
What's he coming here for?

808
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:48,059
Ah, Mr. Paoli. What a pleasure to see you.

809
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:58,820
I hear you ain't laying off
any of the action.

810
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,572
No, not so far. No, sir.

811
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:06,577
You got guts. I admire a man with guts.

812
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:13,209
So I says, "Big Tony,
maybe now's the time you go out...

813
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:17,588
...and make a little bet with this
high-roller Beekman with guts."

814
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,429
A hundred thousand?

815
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:31,978
Mr. Beekman, you and I are not men
who deal in five zeroes.

816
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:35,106
Uh, he means six zeroes, Jim.

817
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,108
"He means six zeroes, Jim."

818
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,737
Of course, I have to cover it.

819
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,031
Ha, ha. Of course.

820
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,478
Give us a look, sweetie.

821
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,523
Come on, honeybunch,
show us those big blue eyes.

822
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:29,535
No.

823
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:31,579
Uh-uh. Mm-mm.

824
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:34,040
He's a menace.
Goes around peeking in windows.

825
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:38,252
Ogled at me last night while I was
getting it on with two young beauties.

826
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:41,339
Look, Clyde has no interest
in human sex.

827
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,674
What were you doing,
getting it on with apes?

828
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,843
Get out. Out.

829
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:48,930
Let's go.

830
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,890
-The fight ain't on till noon.
-I know.

831
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:54,852
But I found where they're holding Lynne.
Best to hit them when they move her.

832
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,355
-What's going on?
-He found out where Lynne is.

833
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:58,773
Let's go.

834
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,567
Uh, I know they're packing heat
and they might use it.

835
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:05,071
I'm his friend and Clyde's his friend.
We go.

836
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:09,659
Hop in there, kid.

837
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,675
Hey.

838
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,315
Right turn, Clyde.

839
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:47,905
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

840
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,408
Why don't you get the cops
and the ambulance?

841
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:54,578
-The cops ain't part of the bargain.
PHILO: Just the ambulance, then.

842
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:55,871
That bullet was mine.

843
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:59,041
I like being a hero too,
sometimes, you know.

844
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:01,335
Well, you're doing a good job with it.

845
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:05,840
Look, I just saved you guys' ass
from the slam.

846
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:07,758
So now they belong to me.

847
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:11,220
But if I ever see you again,
I'm gonna come a-collecting.

848
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:16,600
You just get in this car and
keep driving west, till you see the surf.

849
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,603
You got it? Move.

850
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,650
PHILO: I owe you one.
WILSON: Uh-uh. We're even.

851
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:28,279
Your hairy friend back there
saved my skin for me.

852
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:32,408
-We're even, then.
LYNNE: You're not gonna fight, are you?

853
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,785
Well, if I don't, it's a forfeit.

854
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,663
A lot of people bet money on me.
Not all of them are rich.

855
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:41,083
If neither one of us showed up,
then there wouldn't be any fight.

856
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,252
Then all the bets would be off.

857
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,297
That's something to think about.

858
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,592
Wilson! He hung up.

859
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:52,428
Well, that's it.

860
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,889
Neither of them are gonna show.

861
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:57,391
-All the bets are off, then.
-Damn it.

862
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:01,437
I spent a lot of time,
a lot of money setting this thing up.

863
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:06,776
Well, you better let
the sporting folks know.

864
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:07,985
Yeah.

865
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:11,489
-So are you gonna fight?
PHILO: I don't know. Depends on Wilson.

866
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,282
You wanna stay here with Orville?

867
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:17,745
On your way out, could you kind of
tell the nurses what a hero I am?

868
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:20,247
-Why didn't I think of that?
-Is that the hero?

869
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,042
Oh, yeah. That's him lying right there.

870
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,462
You're a good man, Philo Beddoe.

871
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:28,255
It hurts right here.

872
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:36,514
-Young man's got a real healthy appetite.
-That he does.

873
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:41,185
I don't think we can end it even.

874
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,271
I don't think.

875
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,858
But then, on the other hand...

876
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:50,611
... I don't have any great desire
to make Beekman rich.

877
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:53,864
You figure you would?

878
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,242
I figure.

879
01:30:58,537 --> 01:31:01,914
But then, I guess we'll just have to find out
if I would have or not, huh?

880
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,500
I guess.

881
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,882
Real shame.

882
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:15,052
It would've been the fight of the century.

883
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,388
Sure as hell would have.

884
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,730
I blew a $100,000 deal to get out here
for this fight.

885
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,108
Hell, it would have been worth it.

886
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:34,738
-Wilson would have taken him.
-Ha.

887
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,408
-The hell he would have.
-Who cares?

888
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,232
PHILO:
Get up there.

889
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,468
BOY 1:
Hey, look at this.

890
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,178
BOY 2: What?
GlRL: What?

891
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:40,763
BOY 2:
Whoa!

892
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,765
Let me see.

893
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:52,399
OFFICER: All right, you kids,
what are you doing here?

894
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,655
I said, what are you kids doing here?
Come on. Move back, move back.

895
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:07,498
It's on. It--

896
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,334
-What? What?
-The fight. Give me that.

897
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:16,465
Jackson Base, this is Car 2.
Uh, the fight-- The fight is on. Here.

898
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,427
Breaker, breaker, 1-9.
This is your good news channel.

899
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,638
MAN:
It's on! The fight is on!

900
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,181
Did you hear that?

901
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:28,852
What you waiting for, dummy?

902
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,774
Aren't you gonna have any? Come on.

903
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:38,612
Yeah?

904
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:44,159
-Jim, the fight is on. They're fighting!
-What time is it?

905
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:48,122
-Uh, it's 11:50.
-All bets don't cancel till noon.

906
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:52,668
That means all bets are still on.
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

907
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:06,640
It's on.

908
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:08,892
-What?
-The fight.

909
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,828
It's on. The fight's on!

910
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:37,880
Hey, Cholla. What are we doing on foot?

911
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:41,967
-I told you, the cops pinched the bikes.
-Yeah, but what for?

912
01:34:42,135 --> 01:34:45,054
Who's running this outfit anyway,
you or me?

913
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,261
-Come on, Clyde.
-Come on.

914
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:47,699
Just right around the corner
and we'll be ringside, boys.

915
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:05,092
-Get along, honey. Come on.
-It's just around the corner.

916
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,885
Where's the fight?

917
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,513
Come on, Zack. Let's go!

918
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,537
That's it. That's it.

919
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,799
Come on, baby. Come on.

920
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:52,181
Come on, Philo! Come on!

921
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:31,887
Come on!

922
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,522
Kill him. You heard me. Right now.

923
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:45,567
Nino.

924
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:56,411
Listen up.
That's Beekman's hoods up there.

925
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:57,955
They're gonna kill Beddoe.

926
01:37:58,122 --> 01:38:00,290
Cholla, that's great.
Let's give them a hand.

927
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:01,500
You twit!

928
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:04,795
I sold all the bikes and put
every nickel we had on Beddoe to win!

929
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:06,213
Cholla, how could you?

930
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,507
We've been at war with Beddoe
for over a year.

931
01:38:08,675 --> 01:38:11,301
War is war, but business is business.

932
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:14,388
If Beddoe losses, we are flat busted.

933
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:16,682
Hell yeah, business is business.

934
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:19,226
Don't just stand there, you freaks,
go get them!

935
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:21,103
BLACK WIDOWS:
Yeah!

936
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,114
Yeah!

937
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:46,837
-Aah!
-Shall we?

938
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:55,656
We could end it here, you know.

939
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:57,491
Even?

940
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,826
No, you owe me one.

941
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:07,376
-Hey, is it over?
-I don't know.

942
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:14,716
You think I'd buy that
when I'm still standing?

943
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,426
Nope.

944
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:09,312
It's broke.

945
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:15,026
That's it.

946
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,739
-No, it ain't.
-That's it.

947
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,910
-His arm's broke.
-Philo broke his arm.

948
01:41:31,544 --> 01:41:34,838
Stop this. It doesn't matter.

949
01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:37,716
-It matters to me.
WILSON: Beddoe.

950
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:40,635
We're even.

951
01:41:48,186 --> 01:41:49,770
I owe you.

952
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,951
MAN: Come on. Put that
spaghetti down. Come on.

953
01:43:20,486 --> 01:43:21,528
I knew he'd do it.

954
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,534
MAN:
You get your money's worth.

955
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:42,674
-Was I out?
-Yeah.

956
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:45,385
-How long?
-Long enough.

957
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:50,891
That's it, then.

958
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:53,685
That's it.

959
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:02,777
That was one hell of a fight.

960
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:04,821
You better get that arm fixed.

961
01:44:13,706 --> 01:44:16,917
-I think we better get out of here.
-I think you're right.

962
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:34,726
He's paying off 30 cents on the dollar.

963
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:38,855
But he offered us 40 cents
if we promised not to touch him.

964
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:47,238
-Did you promise?
-Of course.

965
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:49,783
Good.

966
01:44:50,952 --> 01:44:54,204
Now go back there and kill him.

967
01:44:56,374 --> 01:45:00,794
Hell, Zack, 30 cents on the dollar
isn't gonna pay for the cost of that plane.

968
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:02,379
It don't matter.

969
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:06,383
Hell, it's worth it to pay for the privilege
of seeing a fight like that.

970
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,301
Sure as hell is.

971
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:10,804
I should say.

972
01:45:12,264 --> 01:45:15,266
I'm gonna have to call you
on your bloomers, ma'am.

973
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:18,937
Oh, damn it. Chivalry ain't dead in Texas.

974
01:45:19,397 --> 01:45:20,897
Well, thank you, ma'am.

975
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:33,660
-What's the matter? Who is it?
-Tony's boys.

976
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:35,829
Tony's boys?
What are they coming here for?

977
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:39,416
-What the hell do you think for?
-Yeah, but they promised.

978
01:45:58,269 --> 01:45:59,686
Come on. Come on.

979
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,815
Hurry up. Grab the case. Come on.

980
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:12,365
Hey, Beekman, I believe you owe us
another 70 cents on the dollar.

981
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:14,743
Come on, get out of the way, you punks.

982
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:19,164
You really don't know who we are, do you?
Tell him who we are.

983
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:21,416
We're the Black Widows.
We're feared throughout the land.

984
01:46:25,463 --> 01:46:27,547
MAN: Jim.
-Let's get the hell out of here!

985
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,593
Hey.

986
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:35,722
You see how they lit out of here
when they found out who we was?

987
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,933
-Didn't I tell you I'd make you great?
-Yeah.

988
01:46:39,101 --> 01:46:43,063
-Yeah, but we sure got screwed, man.
-Right, Dallas, we got screwed.

989
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:50,361
Not quite.

990
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:55,075
And I'd, uh, check that case if I were you.

991
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:57,577
-Nothing.
ALL: Ha-ha-ha!

992
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:09,339
[SINGING]
Just love me any which way you can

993
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:16,346
My love's not the choking kind

994
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:22,977
You've got your life
And I've got mine

995
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:27,607
So if you can never be free

996
01:47:27,775 --> 01:47:30,110
ORVILLE: I got a telegram
from Ma in Bakersfield.

997
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:32,737
She's at another revival meeting.

998
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,825
What are you gonna do,
you gonna head back East?

999
01:47:37,618 --> 01:47:38,827
Yeah, I guess so.

1000
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:41,788
California ain't such a bad place.

1001
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:45,708
Well, I'm not all that wild about it.
But I do like the people.

1002
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:48,211
And the music is great.

1003
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:50,004
Why, thank you.

1004
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:53,508
What about Beekman?
You gonna have problems with him?

1005
01:47:54,135 --> 01:47:57,554
Beekman's the one with a problem.
He can't cover the bets.

1006
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:08,231
-Orville, what do you say?
-I'm staying here in Jackson. Medical care.

1007
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:10,150
Sure.

1008
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:13,736
I love the place and I love the people.

1009
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,446
Right, Clyde? Mm.

1010
01:48:15,614 --> 01:48:17,407
Right, Clyde. Mm.

1011
01:48:20,953 --> 01:48:26,082
Just love me any which way you can

1012
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:33,006
My love's not the choking kind

1013
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:39,679
You've got your life
And I've got mine

1014
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:49,772
Hey, Beddoe!

1015
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:51,524
You talking to me?

1016
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:55,320
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
We got a little debt to settle.

1017
01:48:55,738 --> 01:48:56,779
We do, huh?

1018
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:01,784
Forty bucks.

1019
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,454
Now, I believe that makes us even.

1020
01:49:06,207 --> 01:49:07,665
I believe so.

1021
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:11,586
You know, Beddoe, that was one hell
of a fight you put up over there.

1022
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,630
I mean, one hell of a fight.

1023
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:16,633
I understand you boys
had a little scuffle yourself.

1024
01:49:18,093 --> 01:49:20,261
Yeah, wasn't half bad.

1025
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:22,096
Uh....

1026
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:25,725
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

1027
01:49:25,893 --> 01:49:28,603
These things don't look bad
when you get them on straight.

1028
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:33,191
No, they look real good.

1029
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,278
You take care, Beddoe.

1030
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:39,614
You do the same.

1031
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:42,492
Let's go.

1032
01:49:48,958 --> 01:49:53,086
CHOLLA: Are we rich, Widows?
BLACK WIDOWS: We are rich, brother!

1033
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,018
PHILO:
What do we have here?

1034
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:10,937
New girlfriend, Clyde?

1035
01:50:17,695 --> 01:50:21,030
Very nice, but we may have trouble
getting you this one.

1036
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:29,330
We'll do what we can, boy.

1037
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:54,939
I thought I recognized you
and your hairy friend.

1038
01:50:55,107 --> 01:50:57,734
Because of you,
I'm stuck out here in this steam bath.

1039
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:00,820
I'm citing you for speeding
and reckless driving.

1040
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:03,364
What? We were only doing 50.

1041
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:06,868
-I'm impounding this truck for evidence.
-Impounded for what?

1042
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:12,332
Evidence for transporting an animal
without certificates of ownership...

1043
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,542
...and certificates of inoculation.

1044
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,753
Nobody owns Clyde. He's a free person.

1045
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:20,006
The animal goes to the kennel.
The truck goes to the yard.

1046
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:24,844
I'm gonna be roasting out in this desert
for three years because of you, Beddoe.

1047
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:26,721
You're gonna pay.

1048
01:51:29,892 --> 01:51:31,225
Right turn, Clyde.

1049
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:36,314
Onward.
