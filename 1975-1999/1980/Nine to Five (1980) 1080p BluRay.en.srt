But, Norman, she has never
worked in her life before.

54
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,549
I thought you'd be
sympathetic.

55
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,050
I am sympathetic, but, please,

56
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,052
why do I have to train her?

57
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,180
Let her work in
someone else's section.

58
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,140
She's willing
and needs the job.

59
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,683
She's recently divorced.

60
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,685
I'm a widow with four kids.

61
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,187
Jerry should never
have died.

62
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,232
I'd be better off.
I could've divorced him.

63
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,984
Is that her?

64
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,194
Yes.

65
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,739
We're going to need
a special locker for the hat.

66
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,409
This way.

67
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,412
This is
quite a day for me.
I'll bet it is.

68
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,707
I was so excited,
I left an hour early
so I wouldn't be late.

69
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,921
It took 45 minutes
to find parking.

70
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,048
We park inside the building.

71
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,842
I just moved
to an apartment
near the airport.

72
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,010
Ah.

73
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,511
Hey, Violet,
what it is?

74
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,679
Hi, Eddie.

75
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,223
What do you hear
about your promotion?

76
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,225
Nothing now.
Uh, Eddie Smith...

77
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,684
Judy Bernly.

78
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,186
Judy starts work today.

79
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,479
What?

80
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,483
How will I ever
get out of this
mail room prison

81
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,485
if they keep hiring
from outside?

82
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,987
Lady, you're going
to hate it here.

83
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,740
Judy.

84
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,243
Okay. Now, we're
on the 12th floor.

85
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,245
Above us is
the executive suite,

86
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:08,249
where the president,
Mr. Hinkle, is
and the chairman of the board.

87
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,250
It sounds so big.

88
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,252
It is.
I've been here 12 years.

89
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,254
I've never even seen
the chairman of the board.

90
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,258
12 years? All I've done
is be a housewife.

91
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,760
I wanted to ask you
about my salary.

92
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,263
That's a very
touchy subject
around here.

93
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,265
You'll have
to take that up

94
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,766
with our boss
Mr. Hart.

95
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,269
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's all so new.

96
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,271
You'll get
the hang of it.

97
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,273
Then you'll really
be sorry.

98
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,441
Come on.

99
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,447
Well, welcome
to the front lines.

100
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,789
Uh-oh. Here comes
General Patton.

101
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,291
Violet, just a moment.

102
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,458
Come on.

103
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,960
Uh, just a moment.

104
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,128
Violet?

105
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,879
Oh, yes, Roz.
So sorry.

106
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:00,301
I've been meaning to talk to you
about Mr. Hart's rules
on office decor.

107
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,469
They seem to be getting
lax in your section.

108
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,722
Really? How?

109
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,223
I've typed it up here.

110
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,225
"No coffee cups
on the desks.

111
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,227
"No personal items
left in view‒

112
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,395
"photos...

113
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,896
plants, et cetera."

114
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,066
We mustn't look
cluttered or sloppy.
Mm-mmm.

115
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,151
An office that...

116
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,528
looks efficient
is efficient,
looks efficient
is efficient,

117
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,488
as Mr. Hart says.
As Mr. Hart says.

118
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,323
Oh, hello.

119
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:26,535
Judy Bernly, Roz Keith,
Mr. Hart's administrative
assistant.

120
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,746
Judy is starting
today.

121
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,247
It's nice to meet you.

122
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,250
Welcome to Consolidated.
I hope you enjoy it.

123
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,752
We're all
a happy bunch.

124
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,253
I think so.

125
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,255
Put this
on the bulletin board.

126
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,758
I know just where
to stick it.

127
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,345
Judy, if there's
anything I can do
to help you settle in,

128
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,931
just drop on by.
Thank you.

129
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,270
One thing you should know
about dear Roz‒

130
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,564
she's the eyes, ears, nose,
and throat of Mr. Hart.

131
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,777
Anything she hears,
he hears.
She's a company spy?

132
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,278
Shh! I wouldn't say that.

133
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,697
If you gossip
in the ladies' room,

134
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,200
check under the stalls
for her shoes.

135
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,701
Happy birthday, Myra.

136
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,703
She and Roz
are like this.

137
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,705
This section's
divided into three zones,

138
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,207
each with a supervisor.

139
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,210
As senior,
the other two supervisors
report to me.

140
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:20,339
I report to Mr. Hart.
That's his office there.
He was just made vice president.

141
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:24,051
I've never seen anyone
leapfrog so fast.

142
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,929
I have the bad back
to prove it.

143
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,515
Margaret, anything serious?

144
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,058
Nothing so far.

145
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,226
Uh-huh.

146
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,728
Margaret, please.
Roz is on my case.

147
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,938
Sorry.

148
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,400
I remember
when he was just
a management trainee.

149
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,403
In fact, I'm the one
who trained him.

150
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,738
What's he like?

151
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,785
I like to think, Judy,

152
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,787
if there is a word

153
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,331
to describe my philosophy
of business...

154
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,709
it's "teamwork."

155
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,463
Everybody
working together.

156
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,675
You girls, of course,
never got a chance
to play football

157
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,218
or baseball.

158
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,221
And I've always felt
like that's unfortunate

159
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,724
because I think it's‒
it's probably
the best place

160
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,769
to learn what teamwork
is all about.

161
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,689
I remember Coach Frye
used to tell us

162
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,818
"a chain is only as strong
as its weakest link."

163
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,699
Its weakest link‒
God damn it!

164
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,076
Get this chair fixed.

165
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,582
Well, I...
I'm not going to bore you
with a long harangue.

166
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,585
Just suffice to say that
it's a jungle out there,

167
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,086
but if we work together,

168
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,464
we'll cut the balls off
the competition

169
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,800
and be sitting pretty
on top of the hill.

170
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,806
Thank you, sir.

171
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,558
I'm happy
to be working here.

172
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,059
Well, you're
a welcome addition,

173
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,021
and a damn pretty one, too,
if I might add.

174
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,397
Thank you, sir.
I mean that.

175
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,317
You should see the crones
coming through here lately.

176
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,943
Real pathetic.
Right, Violet?

177
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,614
Oh, Violet,
my wife's coming by later.

178
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,616
I'd like to get her
a present.

179
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,493
Could you pick out a scarf?

180
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,036
We've discussed
this before.

181
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,663
It's not my place
to shop‒

182
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,665
God damn it.
For five minutes

183
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,167
I've been talking
about teamwork.

184
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,336
You're not there
for the hand-off.

185
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,879
All I'm saying,
Mr. Hart,

186
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,881
is my job description
says nothing

187
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,300
about making
purchases
for your wife.

188
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,303
All I'm saying is
I like people around me

189
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,305
who are flexible
and get along.

190
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,806
When I ask an employee,

191
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,434
especially one who wants
to be promoted to management,

192
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,936
I expect
a little cooperation.

193
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,103
You savvy?

194
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,271
Savvy.

195
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,774
Good. Silk, blue,
maybe a red stripe.

196
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,276
You're talking
to the right person.

197
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,778
Violet's the best.

198
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,279
First person I met here.

199
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,281
Knows more about
what's going on

200
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,450
than anybody
but Mr. Hinkle.

201
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,369
Oh, a deer.

202
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,912
Yeah. Lucky shot.

203
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,914
Listen, if you ever
have anything

204
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,416
of a serious nature
on your mind,

205
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,377
feel free
to talk to me,

206
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,880
because that's actually
why I have my office
on this floor‒

207
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,383
to be close to my girls.
Okay?

208
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,884
Certainly. Thank you.

209
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:11,969
Good.

210
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,180
Oh, is Doralee
back yet?

211
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,517
No.

212
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,018
Get me coffee
then, Violet.

213
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,396
No sugar.
Just Skinny and Sweet.

214
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,647
Yes, sir.

215
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,947
Well, that's
Franklin Hart, Jr.

216
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,033
But to me
he'll always be
F. Hart.

217
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,412
Oh, good.

218
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,663
She's back.

219
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,125
Hi, Violet.
How's everything going?

220
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,793
Oh, Doralee,
your boss wants coffee.

221
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,297
Great. I just got back
from gassing up his car.

222
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm filling one tank
or another.

223
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,842
This is Judy Bernly.

224
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,344
Judy will be working
in my section.

225
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,846
Doralee Rhodes.

226
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,347
Nice to meet you.

227
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,266
Hope everybody's been
treating you friendly

228
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,809
and showing you around.

229
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,811
Everybody's been
very nice, thank you.

230
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,814
If there's anything
I can do, just holler.

231
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,442
I know what it's like
to be the new girl.

232
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,110
Thank you.

233
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,781
Judy, over here.

234
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,784
This is your typewriter,
Dictaphone, adding machine.

235
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,704
I better get you
a locker for that hat.

236
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,596
Hello.

237
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,222
Hello.

238
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,808
Uh...

239
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:42,809
yes.

240
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,187
Hello?

241
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,529
Jo's leaving.
They won't let her
work part-time.

242
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,991
Of course they won't.
It would make things
too convenient.

243
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,827
Hi, Violet. Hi, Judy.
How's it going?

244
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,245
Fine, thank you.

245
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,748
Violet's going to show me
around outside.

246
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,751
Hart's asked me
to buy his wife a scarf.

247
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,420
Why doesn't he ask
Doralee?

248
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,923
She does
everything else for him.

249
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,424
Oh, she's too tired.

250
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,678
They've been
in conference together
all morning.

251
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,179
We'll see you later.

252
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,681
Come on, Judy.

253
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,848
Have fun.

254
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,017
Your salmon
looks good. Mmm!

255
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,185
$20?

256
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,687
I like this.

257
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,690
What did Margaret mean
about Doralee?

258
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,693
Well, rumor has it
that, uh...

259
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,695
she is banging the boss.

260
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,781
She and Mr. Hart?

261
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,282
I think that's awful.

262
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,284
Well, live
and let live.

263
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,287
Though, frankly,
I credit her
with more brains.

264
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,789
Certainly more taste.

265
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,290
That's how
my husband left.

266
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,293
He was having an affair
with his secretary.

267
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,296
I don't think Hart
will leave his wife.

268
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,799
She's been
too good a meal ticket
all these years.

269
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,927
Besides, she's bananas.
She adores him.

270
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,561
Doralee, would you
grab your pad

271
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,397
and bring your pretty face
in here, please?

272
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,149
Yes, sir.

273
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,745
Hold it right there.

274
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,079
What?

275
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,249
Turn around
just a second.

276
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,001
Something wrong?

277
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,254
Have I got something
on my dress?

278
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,255
Nothing's wrong.

279
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,299
Matter of fact,
everything is...

280
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,884
very, very right.

281
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,555
Shall we begin,
Mr. Hart?

282
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,723
Yeah. Um...

283
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,851
take a letter
to Vernon Henshaw

284
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,061
over at Metropolitan Mutual.

285
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,106
Dear Vern,

286
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,608
as you know,

287
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,778
the chairman of the board
of Consolidated Companies,

288
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,030
Mr. Russell Tinsworthy,

289
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,783
spends most of his time
in Brazil

290
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:07,204
working on the jungle
clearance operation.

291
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,955
Consequent‒

292
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,499
Oh, the pencils dropped.

293
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,084
It's all right.
I'll get it.

294
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,380
Here, let me...

295
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,383
Let me‒
Let me help you
with those.

296
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,886
That's okay, really.
I've got them.

297
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,180
There you go.
Okay.

298
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,767
Doralee.
Yes?

299
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,894
About my conduct
in the office here
yesterday...

300
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:35,065
I'm afraid I got
a little carried away. I'd...

301
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,567
I'd just like
to apologize to you.

302
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,069
Don't you worry
about it.

303
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,321
I've been chased
by swifter men than you,

304
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,365
and I ain't
been caught yet.

305
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,077
Shall we get back
to our letter now?

306
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,081
But could you just
come over here
for a second?

307
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,333
I have a little
something for you.

308
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,211
You know...

309
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,754
ever since I made
that stupid mistake

310
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,674
about the convention
in San Francisco, I...

311
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,676
Oh, you didn't
make a mistake.

312
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,177
I'll just have to make sure

313
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,681
the next time I'm asked
to work at a convention,

314
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,432
there's a convention
going on.

315
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,687
Right. And nothing happened anyway,
so let's forget the whole thing.

316
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,896
Fine.

317
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,024
Doralee...

318
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,235
you know, you mean
so much more to me

319
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,529
than just a dumb secretary,

320
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,573
so I bought this for you.

321
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,074
I picked it out myself.

322
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,868
Well, thank you.

323
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,746
You didn't have
to do that.

324
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,748
Oh, it's nice.

325
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,334
It's very nice.

326
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,461
It's also very nothing.

327
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,963
Doralee, I'm a rich man.

328
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,507
I've got a checkbook
on that desk.

329
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,510
Say the word,
you can write
your own figure.

330
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,012
I could do that now.

331
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,389
I sign your name
better than you do.

332
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,143
Doralee,
don't you understand?
I'm crazy about you.

333
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,811
You're all I think about.

334
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,981
I've told you before.
I'm a married woman.

335
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,526
And I'm a married man.
That makes it perfect.

336
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,944
Oh, Mr. Hart‒ Aah!

337
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,446
Doralee, please!
I want you.

338
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,947
Oh, for heaven's sake.

339
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,241
What are you doing,
Mr. Hart?

340
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,618
Call me Frank.

341
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,745
Frank?

342
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,996
Huh?

343
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,707
What are you doing
on the floor?

344
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,208
Nothing. I tripped.

345
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,712
Hit my knee
on the damn
coffee table.

346
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,880
Ow! Oh!

347
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,381
Did you hurt yourself?

348
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,549
No.

349
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,551
What are you
doing down here?

350
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,554
You know I hate it
when you come here.

351
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,056
You know that.

352
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,557
Don't be mad at me.

353
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,476
I just came
from the travel agency.

354
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,062
They have the most
wonderful cruises‒

355
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,563
Oh, hello, Doralee.

356
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,231
Hi, Mrs. Hart.
Well, how are you?

357
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm fine, and you?
What a lovely scarf.

358
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,571
It's a present
from your husband.

359
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,074
Oh, Frank,
that was so thoughtful.

360
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,076
I'm just glad
he appreciates you.

361
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,994
Put it on.

362
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,541
Oh, it's absolutely
adorable.

363
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,086
And you are so attractive.

364
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,546
You're sweet.
I appreciate that.

365
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,548
Doralee,
that'll be all for now.

366
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,717
You can just finish
the letter later on.

367
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:11,388
Bye. Oh, Frank,
let me show you
these brochures.

368
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:16,059
It won't take a second.
You did promise to go.
Right.

369
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,270
Here's a lovely one.
An Italian line.

370
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,272
Looks just like
the <i>Love Boat.</i>

371
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,440
It does.

372
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,819
Four weeks of sunshine.

373
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,405
Four weeks? Are you
out of your mind?

374
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,115
I'm not spending
four weeks of my life

375
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,826
drifting around
on that dago boat.

376
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,251
Well, I'll be damned.

377
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,587
Just look and see
who got paid off
for services rendered.

378
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,589
That's‒That's the scarf
you bought.

379
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,678
Aw, who cares?
I suppose
she deserves it.

380
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,222
I'll bet you
can't wait to see
the Xerox room.

381
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,144
Now, all these rush memos
are always done

382
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,812
on regulation
Consolidated letterhead,

383
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,774
so you place it in here,
8 1/2 X 11.

384
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,694
Close the bin firmly,
turn on the power.

385
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,365
Several people
have lost their hearing
in this room!

386
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,409
Select the number
of copies,

387
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,411
make this a little darker,

388
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,121
and start the print.

389
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,622
Here it comes.

390
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,125
If anything goes wrong,
watch this panel.

391
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,627
The machine tells you
what to do.

392
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,129
I'll leave you to it.

393
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:14,886
Oh!

394
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,246
You're too much.

395
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,457
Your wife's going off
on vacation. There'll be
no stopping you.

396
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,837
I know. Wait till you hear
this new little
scheme I've got going.

397
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,423
Come on in here
a minute.

398
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,763
What the hell
is going on here?

399
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,392
I'm sorry, Mr. Hart.

400
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,810
It was going too fast.

401
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,855
Why didn't you just
shut it off right here?

402
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,274
Catch you upstairs, Frank.
Great little scheme
you got here.

403
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,067
Right here. Right here.

404
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,278
I'm sorry, Mr. Hart.
I thought
I could keep up.

405
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,822
Weren't you
checked out
on this machine?

406
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,992
Any moron could
operate this.

407
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,535
I was.

408
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,037
I know what to do
now, sir.

409
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,539
I suggest
you do it,

410
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,416
or your first day
will be your last,
understand?

411
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,085
Yes, sir.
Clean this mess up
and get back to work.

412
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,920
Yes, sir.

413
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,166
Dick?

414
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,793
Oh, Judy.

415
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,881
What are you doing here?

416
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,718
I just dropped by to
give you these papers.

417
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,264
They're the last.

418
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,766
You, uh, you sign them,

419
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,769
and then you give them
to your lawyer.

420
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,145
Okay.

421
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,399
How are things with you?

422
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,443
Everything's fine.

423
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,611
Terrific!

424
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,279
I got a job.

425
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,447
Oh!

426
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,573
I'm a...

427
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,492
I'm a secretary.

428
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,663
Well, how's Liza?

429
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,165
Fine. She's waiting in the car.

430
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,711
We‒We've got to go.

431
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,341
Well, so long.

432
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,135
Bye.

433
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,496
I feel like I was
just here a minute ago.

434
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,498
You'll get
used to it.

435
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,666
Everybody does.

436
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:32,875
Eventually.

437
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,224
Medicinal purposes.

438
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,395
Violet Newstead,
please hold.

439
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,896
Violet Newstead,
please hold.

440
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,398
Hi, this is Violet.

441
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,401
Mel, no, no.
That's 210, net 30.

442
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,902
Delivered in 9 days.

443
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,407
That's 2% of 4,405.50 is...

444
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,575
88.11.

445
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,827
Oh, my pleasure, Mel.

446
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,580
Violet Newstead,
please hold.
Hi, this is Violet.

447
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,165
Charlotte,
I've got it right here.

448
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:16,252
I was waiting for your call.
That route is...

449
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:20,340
32 via Dixie Express.

450
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,383
Don't worry.
I've got it under control.

451
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,760
Okay. Bye-bye.

452
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,094
Violet News‒
Come on, kids.

453
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,181
No fighting.

454
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,225
Believe me. There's more than one
peanut butter and banana
sandwich in the world.

455
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,270
What did I say this morning?
Okay. Love you, too.

456
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,273
No, I don't want to talk
to the dog. Bye-bye.

457
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,112
Oh, hi, Judy.
How's everything going?

458
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,198
Fine, thanks.

459
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,783
How'd you like to have
lunch today?

460
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,785
Well, I'm afraid
I can't, thanks.

461
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,952
Maybe tomorrow.

462
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,455
I know the cutest
little Italian restaurant

463
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,458
just a hop, skip,
and a jump from here.

464
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,460
I should stay
in the office

465
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,961
and learn
the routine,

466
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,213
but thanks anyway.

467
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,256
Yeah, sure.

468
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,059
You know, I just
don't get it, Dwayne.

469
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,394
What's that, honey?

470
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:18,898
I'm as nice
as I know how to be
to everyone at that office.

471
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:23,277
Everybody treats me
like a bastard
at a family reunion.

472
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,780
Well, come over here
and sit down.

473
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,366
Well, that hurts my feelings.

474
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,284
Where's my smile?
I don't have one.

475
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,079
They're just jealous
'cause you're so pretty.

476
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,580
They're not jealous.

477
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:35,748
Mm-hmm.

478
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,250
Now, where's my smile?

479
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,252
I want you to smile, okay?

480
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,504
You forget
all about them.

481
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:45,007
I'm going to give you
a real warm reception.

482
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,009
I just bet you will.

483
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,889
Violet, a little coffee.

484
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,308
Yes, sir.

485
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,498
Yeah. What else?

486
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,960
Did you have a chance
to look at the report
on color-coding of accounts?

487
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,463
Last month.
I gave it to you.

488
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,174
We could improve
efficiency 20%.

489
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,675
Sure, I looked
into that.

490
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,177
That needs
a little work.

491
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,761
I'll get back
to you on that.

492
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,598
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Okay.

493
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:40,771
Oh, Violet,

494
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,607
I haven't heard
from you.

495
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,233
Did you get
my memo?

496
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,652
I did, Roz.
I tore right through it.

497
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:47,653
Good.

498
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,655
We must
clamp down hard

499
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,657
on any signs
of unionization.

500
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:55,286
Oh, here comes Mr. Hart
with Mr. Hinkle.

501
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,122
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

502
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,624
Hello, girls.
How's it going?

503
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:00,625
Just fine.

504
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,168
Hello, Mr. Hinkle.

505
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:06,714
Roz, you'll be getting
a copy of this report
Frank just gave me.

506
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:10,551
We're going to start
color-coding the accounts
from now on.

507
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,554
Frank's done
a brilliant study
with efficiency.

508
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:17,099
Really?
Congratulations,
Mr. Hart.

509
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,059
Thanks, Roz.

510
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,061
Was just‒just brilliant.

511
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,688
You're a fine piece
of manpower, Frank.

512
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,317
Any other reforms
you want to make
are fine with me.

513
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,318
Thank you.

514
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,736
This is your floor.

515
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,072
You run it
as you please.

516
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,156
Going up?

517
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,450
No. We're going down.

518
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,080
Oh, I can't believe
that man.

519
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,581
He has no shame.

520
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,251
He stood right there
and presented my idea

521
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,752
to the company's
president

522
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,254
like it was his own.

523
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,755
Why didn't you
call him on it?

524
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,591
Oh, because
I'm playing it safe, damn it.

525
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:54,595
In six weeks,
he makes the decision
about that promotion,

526
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,431
and until then,
I'm playing
the good girl.

527
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,766
You finished
up there?

528
00:25:58,849 --> 00:25:59,767
Yeah.

529
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,768
Nice job.

530
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,228
Thanks.

531
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,231
Can you imagine
a mature woman
with four kids

532
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,066
installing
a garage door opener,

533
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,569
he still refers to me
as his girl.

534
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,737
Mom, you gotta relax.

535
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm going to
roll you a joint.

536
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,742
Josh, you know how
I feel about that.

537
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,245
Besides, your grandmother
will pitch a fit

538
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,747
if she even hears you
mention marijuana.

539
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,250
She doesn't understand
moderation.

540
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,752
Besides, you're
the one that keeps
talking about

541
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,754
"harm springs
from excess," right?

542
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,256
Okay. Yes, I know.

543
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,258
I'm talking
about one joint.

544
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,760
Okay.
I don't like it, Josh.

545
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,264
How long have you
been waiting
for this promotion?

546
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,766
Slip it in my purse.

547
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,767
It works!

548
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,102
You did it.

549
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,443
What?

550
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,612
Don't go flying
off the handle.

551
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,406
You gave that promotion
to Bob Enright?

552
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,950
I've got five years
seniority over him.

553
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:58,951
I know.

554
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,119
Christ,
I trained him.

555
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,413
I know, but see,
the company‒

556
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,873
Oh, the company,
bullshit.

557
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,459
You promoted him.
You tell me why.

558
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,254
Well, in the first place,
Bob does have
a college degree.

559
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,255
Oh, brilliant.

560
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,049
While he's
away at college

561
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,550
getting
his useless degree,

562
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,427
I'm working
my butt off.

563
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,430
In the second place,
he's supporting a family.

564
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,723
And I don't?

565
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,225
What's that
got to do
with anything?

566
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,560
My hands are tied.

567
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,896
The company needs
a man in this position.

568
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,565
Clients would rather
deal with men
about figures.

569
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,233
Now we're getting at it.

570
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,236
I lose a promotion
because of some
idiot prejudice.

571
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,155
The boys in the club
are threatened,

572
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,659
and you're
intimidated by any woman that
won't sit at the back of the bus.

573
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,244
Spare me the women's
lib crap, okay?

574
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,413
I know your feelings.
I understand.

575
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,415
You understand zilch.

576
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,918
I understand
I'm still the boss here,

577
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,920
and though you
have your value,

578
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,589
you better get
hold of yourself.

579
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,091
God damn it.

580
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,592
Doralee, get in here!

581
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:57,593
Okay.

582
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,595
I told you
to have this chair fixed.

583
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,430
Okay,
I'm going to leave,

584
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,516
but I'm telling you
one thing‒

585
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,936
Don't you ever
refer to me as
your girl again.

586
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,688
What are you
talking about?

587
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,691
Doralee,
what's with this chair?

588
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,192
I'll tell you‒

589
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,361
I'm no girl.
I'm a woman.

590
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,487
You hear?

591
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,198
I'm not your wife
or your mother...

592
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,700
or even
your mistress.

593
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,535
What?

594
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,036
I am your employee,

595
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,540
and as such,
I expect to be treated equally,

596
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,793
with a little dignity
and a little respect.

597
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,045
What do you mean,
mistress?

598
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,505
She's just upset.

599
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,340
Doralee, the whole
company knows

600
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,551
you two are
having an affair.

601
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,886
Who's been saying
we're having an affair?

602
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,388
Who's been saying it?

603
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,764
He has.

604
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,351
What?

605
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,897
Violet, where
are you going?

606
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,566
I'm going
to get drunk.

607
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,901
Atta girl.

608
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,403
You've been
telling everybody

609
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,238
I'm sleeping
with you, huh?

610
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,240
Well, that's why
these people

611
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,700
treat me
like some floozy.

612
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,744
They think
I'm screwing the boss.

613
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,746
That's not it at all‒

614
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,706
You just love it,
don't you?

615
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,583
Gives you some
cheap thrill,

616
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,084
like knocking over
pencils‒

617
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,502
Let's don't get exc‒

618
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,713
Get your
scummy hands off me.

619
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,090
I've been
straight with you
since I got here.

620
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,885
I put up with
your pinching

621
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,386
'cause I need this job,

622
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,388
but this is
the last straw!

623
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,848
Let's just‒

624
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,309
I got a gun
in my purse.

625
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:32,229
I've been forgiving
because of the way
I was brought up,

626
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,232
but if you ever say
another word about me

627
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,734
or make another
indecent proposal,

628
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,235
I'll get that gun,

629
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,822
and I'll change you
from a rooster to a hen
with one shot!

630
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,242
Don't think
I can't do it!

631
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,289
Shit.

632
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,753
Where are you going?

633
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,588
I need a drink, Roz.

634
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,257
I'm taking the rest
of the day off.

635
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,927
Atta girl.

636
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,264
What do you want?
I'm busy.

637
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:10,267
I wouldn't
disturb you if this
weren't important,

638
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,770
but I just heard
one of the girls

639
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,271
commit a serious
infraction.

640
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,314
What?

641
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,775
Maria Delgado
was speaking
to a girl

642
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,610
whose voice
I didn't recognize

643
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,613
when I overheard her
reveal her salary

644
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:26,075
and make estimates
of yours and mine.

645
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,828
Get rid of her.
Dismiss her.

646
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,497
It isn't as if
she hasn't
been warned.

647
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,957
I clearly outlined‒

648
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,291
Did you hear me?

649
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,168
Fire the bitch.

650
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,795
What?

651
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,296
I don't believe it.

652
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,090
You were fired for that?

653
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,341
That's okay.

654
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,302
I wanted to spend
more time with
my kids anyway.

655
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:46,971
But it's so unfair.

656
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,348
We've got to
do something.

657
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,267
Sure. Let's all revolt.

658
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,811
No. Don't you get
in trouble for me.

659
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,145
It's not worth it.

660
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,648
I'll find another job.

661
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,652
It was hard for me
to work full-time
anyway.

662
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,239
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

663
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,240
Oh...

664
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,616
Where's Violet?

665
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,909
Does she know?

666
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,537
Not yet.
She's at Charlie's
getting drunk.

667
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,581
Well, I'm going to
tell her.

668
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,624
This is a disgrace.

669
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,668
Atta girl.

670
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,604
What a rat.

671
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,772
What a liar.

672
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,608
What a creep.

673
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:44,445
To think he told everybody
I was sleeping with him.

674
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,946
It's so unfair.

675
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,365
Just so unfair.

676
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,162
Twelve years of service,
and he shoots me down.

677
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,290
We've got
to do something.

678
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,959
He can't just treat
people like that.

679
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,878
Do? What's to do, quit?

680
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,254
Well, I can't quit.

681
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,590
It's the same
all over, anyway.

682
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,092
Couldn't we all
get together and...

683
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,093
and complain?

684
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,428
Complain to who?

685
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,763
Let's face it‒

686
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,765
We're in
a pink collar ghetto.

687
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,099
Let's have another drink.

688
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,434
This one's on me.

689
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,936
I've got it.

690
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,437
It's my turn.

691
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,272
I've really got it.

692
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,273
What's that?

693
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,275
I didn't think
you smoked.

694
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,777
You roll your own?

695
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,446
This is a gift
from my son.

696
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,282
Let's pop to
the ladies' room
and light up.

697
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:33,118
Is that one of them
marijuana cigarettes?

698
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,788
We don't have enough
for everybody. Cool it.

699
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,289
We can't, Violet.

700
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:38,624
Someone
might come in.

701
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,959
It is dangerous,
Violet.

702
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,628
Would you two show
a little spunk?

703
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,798
What are you,
a man or a mouse?

704
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,300
I mean a woman
or a wouse?

705
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,802
Let's go
to my house.

706
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,638
My husband's away.
We'll have the place
to ourselves.

707
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:56,642
We could have ourselves
an old-fashioned ladies'
pot party.

708
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,312
You know,
that stuff don't do
that much for me.

709
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,732
I smoked
a marijuana cigarette
at a party once.

710
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:07,903
I could never
figure out what
the big deal was.

711
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,154
Huh.

712
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,247
Threatening Hart
with a gun?

713
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,624
He knows
I've got one, too.

714
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,628
I keep it right here
at all times.

715
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:28,340
All I can think,
he must have peed
in his pants.

716
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,928
Have you ever fired it?

717
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,264
Have I ever fired it?

718
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,433
Well, really,
just once,

719
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,435
right after Dwayne
bought it.

720
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:43,272
I was coming home
from this rodeo
with a girlfriend,

721
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,774
and these two men
started hassling us.

722
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,192
They wouldn't let up.

723
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,112
I was being big
'cause I had a gun,

724
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,281
so I reached to get it,

725
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,784
and I shot a hole
clean through my purse.

726
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,622
But they ran off.

727
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,416
I bet they did.

728
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,502
Like turkeys.

729
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,047
Wow.

730
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,215
This is...

731
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,801
This is
really good pot.

732
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,556
What did you
call it again?

733
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,683
Maui wowee.

734
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,019
Well, I love it.

735
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,562
It's primo.

736
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,233
I don't think
I could ever carry a gun.

737
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,069
I don't understand
guys like Hart

738
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:33,238
who go out and
shoot those poor,
defenseless animals

739
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,241
like Bambi
and Thumper...

740
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,077
and that cute little skunk.

741
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,246
I'd like to hunt.
I'd like to hunt Hart.

742
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,749
I'd like to chase
his lily-white tail

743
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,168
and see how he likes it.

744
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,809
I think she's stoned.

745
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,228
Thumper.

746
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,064
Am I stoned?

747
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,649
I think
you're stoned.

748
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,236
Oh, it's so funny.

749
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,737
What's so funny?

750
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,406
Oh, I have
this image of Hart

751
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,242
running for his life,

752
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,496
and the whole office
is out to get him
and hunt him down.

753
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,023
There he is!

754
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,442
Get him!

755
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,906
Kill the bastard!

756
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,675
Aah! Who's there?

757
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,596
Hello, Hart.

758
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,683
Looks like you're
in a spot of trouble.

759
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,060
Judy?

760
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,729
You've
got to help me.

761
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,148
That mob's crazy.
They're trying
to kill me.

762
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,692
Why would they
want to do that?

763
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,944
I don't know. I'm not a bad guy.

764
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,989
You're a sexist, egotistical,
lying, hypocritical bigot.

765
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,741
So I have a few flaws.

766
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,701
Is that reason
to kill me?

767
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,244
You're foul, Hart,

768
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:47,247
a wart on the nose
of humanity,

769
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,291
and I'm going to
blast it off.

770
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,460
Judy, Judy, Judy...

771
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,253
Good-bye, boss-man.

772
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,589
It's quittin' time.

773
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,758
You can't
mean this.

774
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,968
1...2...3...

775
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:00,928
4...5...

776
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,055
Why me?
I'm an ordinary guy

777
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,348
trying to do his job.

778
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,850
8...9...

779
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,352
Holy shit.

780
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,353
10.

781
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,375
Hi?

782
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,344
That's great.

783
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,561
Well, I have just
wrecked my diet,

784
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,397
but I love good barbecue,
don't you?

785
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,274
Dwayne fixed these
last night.

786
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,734
Mmm...

787
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,569
Oh, that is
so wonderful.

788
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,404
Oh, these
olives. Mmm.

789
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,905
Everything tastes
so wonderful.

790
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,657
I can't get over it.

791
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,159
What about you,
Doralee?

792
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,828
What's your fantasy
for doing him in?

793
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,079
Me?

794
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:55,250
Well, I think I'd like to
just come ridin' up one day

795
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:58,337
and give him a taste
of his own medicine.

796
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,022
Hey, hot stuff,

797
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,858
grab your pad
and get your buns
in here.

798
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,109
Yes, ma'am.

799
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,408
Morning.

800
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,537
Hold it.

801
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,872
Hold it right there.

802
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:34,998
Something wrong?

803
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,041
No, no.

804
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,210
I just wanted to
check your bod.

805
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,712
Turn around
for a second.

806
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,715
You got
a nice ass, Frank.

807
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,385
You ought to get
your pants cut tighter,

808
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,720
bring 'em up
a little in the crotch.

809
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,222
You got a nice package.

810
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,765
Might as well
show it off.

811
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:53,642
Mrs. Rhodes.

812
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,144
Come over here.
I want you to take a memo.

813
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,651
To all personnel...

814
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,196
Boy, that's great cologne
you're wearing, Frank.

815
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,073
Oh, thank you.

816
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:11,910
It's turning me on.
What's that called?

817
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:12,911
Stud.

818
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,162
Stud.

819
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,873
Ohh.

820
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,750
Well, it's very sexy,

821
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,752
only I don't like
that tie you're wearing.

822
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,255
What happened to
the ones I gave you?

823
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,881
Well, nothing. I just‒

824
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:25,924
Take it off.

825
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:26,925
Excuse me?

826
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,427
Take it off.

827
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,388
Can't work
with those stripes
glaring out at me.

828
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,266
How 'bout unbuttoning
that coat and your shirt?

829
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,309
You need to loosen up.

830
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,563
That's better.

831
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,064
Now, where were we?

832
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,149
The memo.

833
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,735
Oh, by the way,
I got a surprise for you.

834
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,779
I am a married man.

835
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,781
Forget about
your wife, Frank.

836
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,284
You may be hers
in the evening,

837
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,786
but you're my boy
from nine to five.

838
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,788
Look what
I got for you.

839
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,123
Isn't that pretty?

840
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,125
Yes, it's pretty.
Very pretty.

841
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,253
But you shouldn't
be buying gifts
for me, Mrs. Rhodes.

842
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,797
Let me put it on you.

843
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,800
Now, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

844
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,135
No.

845
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,804
I love your hair.
It's so sexy.

846
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:15,557
Go over on the couch.
I'll lock the door.

847
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,267
Mrs. Rhodes‒

848
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,269
Oh, let's be friendly, Frank.

849
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,771
You got to be
more cooperative

850
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,274
if you want to
keep this job.

851
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,776
Mrs. Rhodes,
I'm not that kind of boy.

852
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,069
Oh, get off it.

853
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,780
One little kiss?
What's that
going to hurt?

854
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,282
Who's gonna know?

855
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,283
No, no.

856
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,951
I won't.
I won't.

857
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,286
No! No!

858
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,287
Jeez!

859
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,664
Frank,
you get back here.

860
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,625
I'm warning you‒
come back here.

861
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,293
No, I won't.

862
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,421
<i>And he's out of the chute,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

863
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:49,883
<i>Look out. That's a big bull
from the high glass tower.</i>

864
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:53,470
<i>Now, Miss Doralee Rhodes
is gonna try to rope him.</i>

865
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,639
<i>She's already got him down.</i>

866
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,142
<i>How long will it take
to hog-tie this sexist,</i>

867
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:02,020
<i>egotistical, lying,
hypocritical bigot?</i>

868
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,980
<i>Five seconds,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

869
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,398
<i>Just five seconds!</i>

870
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,253
I can just see
Hart hanging there

871
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,255
wondering what
the hell happened.

872
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,923
Ha, ha. Ohh.

873
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,424
What's your
fantasy, Violet?

874
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,927
How would you
bump off
the boss?

875
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,930
Oh, I have to
think about it.

876
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:40,267
For me, it would have to be
like a fairy tale,

877
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,770
something gruesome
and horrible
and real gory...

878
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,480
but kind of cute.

879
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,485
Violet, get me
some coffee.

880
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,153
Yes, sir.

881
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,757
Sorry.

882
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,067
Thank you.

883
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,692
Your coffee,
Mr. Hart.

884
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:54,776
Hmm?

885
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,153
Oh, you can
put it down.

886
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,158
Just the way
you like it.

887
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,212
More coffee,
Mr. Hart?

888
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,755
Coffee?

889
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:18,883
Aah!

890
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,009
Ooh.

891
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:25,807
Aah!

892
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,521
Ooh...ooh...

893
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,575
I think
there was something
in that coffee.

894
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,828
I think you're right.

895
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,747
I think it was poison.

896
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,748
Right again.

897
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,209
I think you did it.

898
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,587
♪ Ha, ha-ha, ha-ha ♪♪

899
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,629
Uh...

900
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,425
But why?

901
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,509
Why?

902
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,219
Why do you think?

903
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:08,683
Because I'm a sexist,
egotistical, lying,
hypocritical bigot?

904
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,226
Bingo.

905
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,437
Aah!

906
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:38,797
♪ Hallelujah ♪

907
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,927
♪ Hallelujah ♪

908
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:51,434
♪ Hallelujah ♪♪

909
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,772
Hip-hip hoorah!

910
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,274
Hip-hip hoorah!

911
00:46:58,358 --> 00:46:59,609
Yay!

912
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,706
I had such
a good time
last night.

913
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,209
You know, we should
do that more often.

914
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,212
How is Hart? I haven't
seen him all morning.

915
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,673
He didn't say a word
about yesterday.

916
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:22,882
He's happy.

917
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:26,344
His wife left this morning
on a two-month cruise.

918
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,554
Lucky her.

919
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:31,015
She still has to
come back to him,
poor thing.

920
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,517
Let's have
lunch today.

921
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,018
I got to
go shopping.

922
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:35,520
We're running out
of everything‒

923
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,939
cat food, fish food,
ant spray, rat poison.

924
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,984
Hart wants me to take
papers to his lawyer.

925
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,443
I'll be gone
all afternoon.

926
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,987
Aw, damn it.

927
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,990
When you're away,
that only means
one thing.

928
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,034
Ahh.
Ahh.
Ahh.

929
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,370
Coffee, Violet.

930
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,164
Now.

931
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,293
Yes, sir.

932
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,924
I swear, Betty,
one of these days,

933
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,426
he'll push me too far,

934
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,553
then I'll let him
have it.

935
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,054
I mean,
enough is enough.

936
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:12,056
We're out of
Skinny and Sweet.

937
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,225
I got some
at lunch today.

938
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,728
Who does he think
he is anyway‒

939
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,730
a miserable, petty,
two-bit dictator,

940
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,231
ordering me around

941
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,567
like I'm
some sort of flunky?

942
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,652
I get so mad
at myself.

943
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,154
I've been
such a nerd.

944
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,907
Violet, he just
does it to annoy you.

945
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,909
Don't let him
get to you.

946
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,577
Besides,
the day's almost over.

947
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,620
You're right.

948
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,622
I tell myself
the same thing,

949
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,123
but the pressure's
building up.

950
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,292
I can't take
much more of this.

951
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,128
Something,
somewhere, sometime
is going to snap,

952
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,130
and then,
God help Mr. Hart,

953
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:47,175
because I won't
be responsible
for my actions.

954
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:51,679
Ahh, but right now,

955
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,765
I'm calm,
perfectly calm.

956
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,064
No.

957
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,525
Not for one second.

958
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:07,612
Right.

959
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,572
Hold it.
Hold it a minute.

960
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,074
I've already
told Bob Enright,

961
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,076
and now
I'm telling you.

962
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,079
When you get
anything at all
from Ajax Warehouse,

963
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,956
you bring it
directly to me.

964
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:18,957
Got that?

965
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,125
You're the boss.

966
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,753
You might remember that
a little more often.

967
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,254
Ha, ha, ha.

968
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:26,756
See he caught you.

969
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,758
I'm a tree.
I can bend.

970
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,259
Hang in there, honey.

971
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:31,970
It's almost 5:00.

972
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,513
Now, you listen to me.

973
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,014
Ajax is my deal.

974
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:38,434
You get your money
when I give it to you.

975
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,895
Don't ever call me
at this number again.

976
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:41,896
Jerk.

977
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,193
Doralee. Doralee!

978
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,821
Uhh.

979
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,163
Oh, my goodness.

980
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,707
Mr. Hart.

981
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,458
Mr. Hart!

982
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,460
Oh, Mr. Hart.

983
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:05,461
Mr. Hart.

984
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:06,713
Oh, no.

985
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,270
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

986
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,771
Violet,
where have you been?

987
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,273
You've missed
all the excitement.

988
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,524
What happened?

989
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,985
They took Hart away
in an ambulance
unconscious.

990
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,987
He had an attack
or something.

991
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,488
He did?
Well, where's Doralee?

992
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:33,948
Well, she went
with him.

993
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:35,450
I hope it's
not serious.

994
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:36,451
Me, neither.

995
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,952
Well, maybe
a little serious.

996
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:41,956
Some trifle that'll
keep him out for
the next 20 years.

997
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,957
Let's go.

998
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,959
I'll meet you
at the elevator.

999
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:45,960
Okay.

1000
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,136
Oh, my God!

1001
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,307
Oh, my God.

1002
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,600
Ahh.

1003
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,313
Oh.

1004
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:07,857
Violet,

1005
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,151
isn't it awful
about Mr. Hart?

1006
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,694
How did it happen,
Roz?

1007
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:15,323
Fell and hit his head
on the credenza.

1008
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,824
What about
the coffee?

1009
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:17,825
What?

1010
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,327
Where is the coffee cup?

1011
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,328
Oh, here.

1012
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,747
It was by him
on the floor.

1013
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,541
He must've been
drinking it
when he blacked out.

1014
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,542
What hospital?

1015
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,086
St. Ambrose.

1016
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,128
Oh.

1017
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,671
Oh, my God.

1018
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,176
I know you feel.

1019
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,095
Aah. Aah.

1020
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,137
Judy.

1021
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,139
Oh, Judy.
Hurry. Hurry.

1022
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,641
What's the matter?

1023
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,142
Something terrible's
happened.

1024
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:44,685
You won't
believe it.

1025
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,188
I don't believe it.

1026
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,690
How could you make
such a stupid mistake?

1027
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,984
I thought it was
Skinny and Sweet.

1028
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:53,486
Here, look.
They're identical,

1029
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,447
except for
the skull and crossbones
on the label.

1030
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:57,949
Someone's
going to see you.

1031
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,909
I've got to
go to the hospital.

1032
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:02,078
They'll have to
pump his stomach.

1033
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,830
Don't be hysterical.
Don't be hysterical.

1034
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,873
You're right.
Keep calm. Keep calm.

1035
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,595
You'd better speak
to admitting, ma'am.

1036
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:20,596
Yeah. Right.

1037
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,771
My boss was
brought in.

1038
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:30,189
Franklin Hart.

1039
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,320
There we go.

1040
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:43,327
What's go‒

1041
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:44,829
What's going on?

1042
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,456
Take it easy now.
You blacked out.

1043
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,083
How do you feel?

1044
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,585
I feel fine.

1045
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,963
I fell off a chair
and hit my head.

1046
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,298
Uh-huh.

1047
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,299
Ooh.

1048
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,259
You got quite
a bump there.

1049
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,179
I think we'll take you
upstairs for X-rays.

1050
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:02,180
X-rays?

1051
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,973
Mm-hmm.

1052
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,474
Wait a minute, doc.

1053
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,476
I don't want
any X-rays.

1054
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,769
I like my head.

1055
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,813
We ought to do some tests.

1056
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:12,315
You do tests
on yourself.

1057
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,859
I know what you guys
racket is.

1058
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,361
You're not
suckering me
into hospital bills,

1059
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:19,739
not for a little
bump on the head.

1060
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,866
Hey, doc.
Cardiac arrest.

1061
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,367
He stopped breathing.

1062
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:26,370
Open his shirt.
Plug him into
the monitor.

1063
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:31,125
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1064
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,585
1, 2.

1065
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,221
Hurry.

1066
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:47,391
2, 3, 4, 5.

1067
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:51,145
1, 2, 3, 4.

1068
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:53,981
That bum.

1069
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,692
He was our
only witness.

1070
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:58,527
We had him all ready
to testify.

1071
00:53:58,611 --> 00:53:59,904
Now this.

1072
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:02,782
There's Doralee.

1073
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:03,783
Doralee.

1074
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,284
What are you
doing here?

1075
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:06,744
Doralee, something
terrible has happened.

1076
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,745
What?

1077
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,747
Violet put poison
in Hart's coffee.

1078
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,207
It was an accident.

1079
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,708
You mean,
that's why‒

1080
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:15,169
It looks just like
Skinny and Sweet.

1081
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:16,212
Good grief.

1082
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,713
Where is he?

1083
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:20,549
The emergency room.
First door
on the right.

1084
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:22,718
Oh, my God.
There's a policeman.

1085
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:25,721
What's he doing here?

1086
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:27,265
I don't know.

1087
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:30,101
The guy on the gurney,
how is he?

1088
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,602
He's not so good.

1089
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:33,813
Can I speak
to the doctor?

1090
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:35,773
He knows
you're here.

1091
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,275
He knows I'm here.

1092
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,819
Oh, my God.
They found out already.

1093
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,279
Don't panic.
Please don't panic.

1094
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,072
How is he, doc?

1095
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,573
Ah, he's dead.

1096
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:45,616
Aw.

1097
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,743
Oh, my God.

1098
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,203
Can you tell
what caused it?

1099
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:50,955
Not without
an autopsy.

1100
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,457
You fellows can
come into my office.

1101
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,459
I'm fairly certain
it was poison.

1102
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:56,460
Poison?

1103
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:57,628
Ahh.

1104
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:00,589
It's okay.
It's okay.

1105
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,549
Easy now.

1106
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,550
Poison.

1107
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,551
Poison.

1108
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,052
It's all over.

1109
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,554
Did you hear‒
an autopsy?

1110
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,974
I'll save them the trouble
and give them the poison.

1111
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:10,975
Violet!

1112
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,893
You want someone
to see it?

1113
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,395
Who cares?
I'm finished.

1114
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,813
I'm a murderer.

1115
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,315
No, you're not.

1116
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,108
I'm a murderess.

1117
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,609
My poor kids.

1118
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,111
Violet, you're nothing
until proven guilty.

1119
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:25,323
They'll find
the poison when
they do the autopsy.

1120
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,325
I'll get rid
of the poison.

1121
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,327
I'll get rid
of the body.

1122
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,829
No, it's not murder.
They're are extenuating
circumstances.

1123
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,497
It was an accident.

1124
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:34,665
An accident?

1125
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,043
She was thinking
about doing it
last night.

1126
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:39,045
We all thought
about it.

1127
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,047
She didn't do it
on purpose.

1128
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,548
Oh, maybe
unconsciously I did.

1129
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,426
I'm going to the pen.

1130
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,345
Let's get
her a lawyer.

1131
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,180
I'll be locked up for life.
Where's the phone?

1132
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,514
Over there.

1133
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:51,974
Do you have
any change?

1134
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,976
I'm going to
lose my job.

1135
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,977
Calm down.

1136
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,479
I've killed the boss.

1137
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,981
You think they're not going to
fire me for that?

1138
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:01,609
Hush. Now just sit here.
We'll be right back.

1139
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,961
Oh, medic,
this the guy
for the autopsy?

1140
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:21,962
Yeah.

1141
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,465
The doctor would
like to see you.

1142
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,133
Right this way.

1143
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:32,199
They're looking for
a second opinion.

1144
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:33,659
I'm going to
go ahead.

1145
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:37,705
So, look, if you can
get it to them by Friday...

1146
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:22,666
Ma'am.
Ohh!

1147
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,503
Excuse me. Where's
the coffee shop?

1148
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,504
What?

1149
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,005
The coffee shop.

1150
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,507
The coffee shop?

1151
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,258
No. I'm new here.

1152
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:34,470
I'm new here, too.
Where do you work?

1153
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:35,513
Downstairs.

1154
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,348
The morgue?

1155
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,307
That's right.

1156
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,308
He's...

1157
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,809
Yes, he is.

1158
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:41,810
How?

1159
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,604
Coffee,
too much coffee.

1160
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,106
I'm just taking him
out for some air‒

1161
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,193
Air for me.
He's coming along
for the ride.

1162
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,279
You're a doctor.

1163
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:53,822
I didn't see
your badge.

1164
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:54,782
Sorry.

1165
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,033
I'm a doctor.

1166
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,576
Why am I talking
to you?

1167
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,619
Piss off.

1168
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,292
How's Violet?

1169
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,387
Oh, honey, I think
Violet has flipped out.

1170
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,131
Violet,
what are you doing?

1171
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,133
Come on,
get in. Get in.

1172
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,927
There's no time
for talking. Get in.

1173
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:03,100
Violet, slow down.

1174
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,560
Why are you
driving fast?

1175
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:07,104
They can't
do an autopsy
without a body.

1176
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,772
I told you
she's flipped.

1177
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:11,442
She has just
absolutely flipped.

1178
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,110
Where is the body?

1179
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,570
In the trunk.

1180
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,071
We'll get
cement blocks

1181
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:18,282
and pitch him
off the pier.

1182
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,783
No one will
ever know.

1183
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:20,784
You're crazy.

1184
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,620
They always find it.

1185
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:24,079
Oh, crazy, am I?

1186
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,748
They never found
Jimmy Hoffa.

1187
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,583
Slow down.

1188
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,543
Will you just
slow down?

1189
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,629
Let's not panic.
Let's not panic.

1190
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,130
There's a restaurant
up there.

1191
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,633
Why don't we pull over
and stop for a bite?

1192
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,969
How can you
think of food
at a time like this?

1193
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,512
I'm not thinking
of food.

1194
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:42,056
I'm not hungry.

1195
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,482
Violet,
we're not criminal.

1196
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,817
You're not a criminal.
It was an accident.

1197
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,444
Well, we're
criminals now.

1198
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,946
We've just
stolen a corpse
from a hospital.

1199
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,448
That sounds like
criminal to me.

1200
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:02,493
We'll just turn around
and take it back.

1201
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,161
We'll get caught.

1202
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,163
You think they'll
listen to us?

1203
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,665
Will you please
stop arguing?

1204
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:10,501
Think about
where we can get
some cement.

1205
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,632
Look out!

1206
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,759
Don't panic. Don't panic.

1207
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,597
Aah.
Aah.
Aah.

1208
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:28,936
What happened?

1209
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:29,978
She panicked.

1210
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:31,021
Nobody's hurt.

1211
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,898
It's just a little accident.

1212
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,567
We'll be out
of here in no time.

1213
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:39,446
The front fender's
hitting the tire.

1214
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,449
Oh, good Lord. Get out.
Let's look at it.

1215
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,288
Oh, that ain't
too bad.

1216
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,374
We'll pull
that fender out.

1217
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,875
Give me a hand.

1218
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,460
Oh, God.

1219
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,129
Wait. That's no use.

1220
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,089
We need a crowbar
or something.

1221
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,134
There's a tire iron
in the trunk.

1222
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,393
Judy, turn
the blinkers off.

1223
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:31,123
Uh, Judy, would
you come back here
for a second?

1224
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,420
What?

1225
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,922
Look.

1226
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:39,923
Who's that?

1227
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,425
I don't know.

1228
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,426
Where's Hart?

1229
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,595
I don't know.

1230
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:47,389
Oh, my God.
You mean, she‒

1231
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:49,391
Oh, my God!

1232
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:56,774
Violet, honey,
would you come over here
for a second?

1233
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,734
What is the matter
with you?

1234
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,235
We have got
to get the‒

1235
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,236
Who is that?

1236
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,405
I don't know.

1237
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:05,949
What do you mean
you don't know?

1238
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:07,826
What happened
to Hart's body?

1239
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:11,121
It's not here.
You think it walked away?

1240
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:12,080
But I‒

1241
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:13,582
Violet,
how could you?

1242
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:15,083
How could you?

1243
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,795
I guess I must have
made a mistake.

1244
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,755
You steal
the wrong body,

1245
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:22,633
and all you can say
is, "I made a mistake."

1246
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,134
It could happen
to anyone.

1247
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:26,136
Oh, this is awful.

1248
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,679
It's so improper.

1249
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:29,181
It's so disrespectful.

1250
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:30,891
He's dead.
He doesn't mind.

1251
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,893
There's nothing to
get excited about.

1252
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,478
We'll just take it back.

1253
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:35,479
What?

1254
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,148
No harm's done.
We'll take it back.

1255
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:39,316
That's great.

1256
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:42,820
We waltz in there and
say, "we made a mistake."

1257
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,280
Maybe they'll give us
Hart's body in exchange.

1258
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:47,115
There's no need
to get sarcastic.

1259
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,117
You took it.
You take it back.

1260
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,077
Stop it.

1261
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,495
We're all
in this together.

1262
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,956
Now we have
to be very calm.

1263
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,958
We're going to
fix the fender.

1264
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,960
We'll go back
to the hospital.

1265
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,963
We'll figure
out a plan to
drop off the body.

1266
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,715
Then we'll decide
what we're
going to do next.

1267
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:05,759
I tried to tell
this woman‒

1268
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,594
Will you two shut up?

1269
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:34,997
It's not a bad plan.

1270
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,498
It might work.

1271
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:39,001
If we could just
find a wheelchair.

1272
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,004
I saw a couple
outside the emergency
entrance before.

1273
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,922
I think
that's a good idea.

1274
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:46,925
I just wish we knew
what happened to Hart.

1275
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:49,469
We're going to
find out soon enough.

1276
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,058
What's that?

1277
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:57,769
It's a siren.

1278
01:04:57,853 --> 01:04:59,313
It's a policeman.

1279
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,106
He wants us
to pull over.

1280
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,483
Do I make
a break for it?

1281
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,110
I've got my gun.

1282
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:06,528
Are you crazy?

1283
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,030
Oh, my God.

1284
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,032
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

1285
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,158
What does he want?

1286
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,869
I don't know.
Pull over.

1287
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,079
Pull over.
Be ready for anything.

1288
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:18,582
Listen to what he says
and don't panic.

1289
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,083
But what if he wants‒

1290
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,794
For Christ's sake,
pull over! Pull over!

1291
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,435
Good evening, ladies.

1292
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,938
May I see
your license and
registration, please?

1293
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:42,439
Why? I wasn't speeding.

1294
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,899
I didn't say
you were.

1295
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,275
Your taillight
is blinking.

1296
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,276
It is?

1297
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,112
Are your signals on?

1298
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:50,113
No.

1299
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,240
There's a short
in the trunk.

1300
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:53,742
A short in the trunk?

1301
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,703
We've got a short
in the trunk.

1302
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,205
Probably just
a defective wire.

1303
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,873
You want
to take a look?

1304
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:01,792
Do we want
to take a look?

1305
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,795
No, we can't, Officer.
We don't have time.

1306
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,296
We're on an emergency.

1307
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,465
That's‒that's right.
She's a doctor.

1308
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:09,800
Oh, you're
a doctor?

1309
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,678
What do think I am,
a beautician?

1310
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,137
I didn't see
your badge.

1311
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:15,639
What's
the trouble?

1312
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:19,309
I'm taking this woman
to the hospital,
and she's sick.

1313
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,061
Which one
of you is sick?

1314
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,771
I am.
I am.

1315
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,481
She is.
She is.

1316
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:27,109
They're both sick.

1317
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:32,155
What is that
you're hiding there?

1318
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,156
What? This?

1319
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,157
Yes.

1320
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,659
It's rat poison.

1321
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,160
She ate it.

1322
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:38,245
What?

1323
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,831
She ate
the rat poison.
That's why they're sick.

1324
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,290
You ate the rat poison?

1325
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:44,668
I thought it was
Skinny and Sweet.

1326
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,170
It looks just like
Skinny and Sweet,

1327
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:50,632
except for the little
skull and crossbones
on the label.

1328
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:52,134
Can we go now,
Officer?

1329
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,844
I'm not feeling very well.

1330
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,345
Did you hear that?

1331
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,847
She's not feeling
very well.

1332
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,640
I've got a dying woman,

1333
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:01,059
and you want to look
for a short.

1334
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:03,562
I'm sorry.
If we don't
make it on time,

1335
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,063
I'm holding you
responsible.

1336
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:06,064
Don't worry.

1337
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:07,566
I'll give you
an escort.

1338
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:08,567
An escort?

1339
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,194
He's going to
give us an escort.

1340
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:12,863
Oh, Lord.

1341
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:13,822
Hang on‒

1342
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,408
Forget it, Mac.
We can't wait.

1343
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,133
How did it go?

1344
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,135
I couldn't find out
about Hart.

1345
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,721
They don't know,
or they won't tell us.

1346
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,222
What are we
going to do?

1347
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,307
Nothing.

1348
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,768
We're going to wait
until they come to us.

1349
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,728
Go to the office
in the morning

1350
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,730
and pretend like
nothing has happened.

1351
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,108
Well, what about
the other matter?

1352
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:51,651
Don't worry about it.

1353
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,155
It's been taken care of.

1354
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:17,928
Hey, Viv.

1355
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:21,723
We got another stiff
in the john.

1356
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:32,275
Morning, Judy.

1357
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,444
Morning, Violet.

1358
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:36,446
Doralee, uh,
no calls this morning.

1359
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,491
I don't want to be
disturbed at all.

1360
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:50,043
All that running
around last night
was useless.

1361
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:53,088
Hart left with
a little bump
on his head.

1362
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,590
I did put the poison
in the coffee.

1363
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:57,092
I know it.

1364
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,678
Well, he absolutely
did not drink it, Violet.

1365
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,680
How could we
be so stupid?

1366
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,224
Did anybody
think to look
under the stalls.

1367
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,226
Yes. Yes.
And there's nobody there.

1368
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,645
Look, I propose we forget
the whole thing.

1369
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,147
It never happened.

1370
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,648
That's okay with me.

1371
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,483
I'll never
mention it again.

1372
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:14,985
Thank God
it's Friday.

1373
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,987
Why don't we start
the weekend

1374
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,488
with a drink
at Charlie's?

1375
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:20,657
You know,
we are so lucky.

1376
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,326
I'm glad this whole
mess is finally over.

1377
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,120
Oh, me, too.

1378
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:37,299
Is this accurate?

1379
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:38,800
They actually
said this?

1380
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:40,802
Clearly as I could
make out.

1381
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:42,804
My notes were
a little fuzzy.

1382
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:44,723
Well, this is
very interesting.

1383
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:48,226
Stealing corpses,
eluding the police.

1384
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,729
May-Maybe they knew
you were hiding,

1385
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,647
just‒just pulling
your leg.

1386
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,232
I don't think so.

1387
01:09:54,316 --> 01:09:59,404
In any event, I think
you should be aware of
that coffee business.

1388
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:03,867
Yeah. I think
I can use that
to some advantage.

1389
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,368
Whoo! Look out,
Charlie's,

1390
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:06,870
here we come.

1391
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,872
Oh, Judy.
Wait just a second.

1392
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,457
I'll be right back.

1393
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,000
I'll‒I'll tell Violet.

1394
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:15,962
It's 5:00, Mr. Hart.
You wanted to see me?

1395
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:16,963
I did, Doralee.

1396
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:20,008
I'd like you to come over
to my house tonight.

1397
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,970
I'm not working
tonight.
This is Friday.

1398
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:26,223
Who said anything
about work?

1399
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,768
Oh, uh, by the way,

1400
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,103
have you ever
heard of strychnine?

1401
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:34,606
Strychnine
is a poison, I think.

1402
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,233
Yes, it is a poison.

1403
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,193
I just talked to
the hospital.

1404
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,237
They found
traces of strychnine

1405
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,948
when they pumped out
my stomach yesterday.

1406
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,575
What? You told me
you just hit your head.

1407
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:49,496
I had to be sure.
I think you need
evidence like that

1408
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,915
if you're going to
accuse somebody of murder.

1409
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:52,999
Murder?

1410
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:53,917
Yeah.

1411
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,419
You and Violet
and that girl Judy

1412
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:57,921
tried to murder me
yesterday.

1413
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,882
Put the rat poison
in my coffee.

1414
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,385
Oh, my goodness.
I don't believe this.

1415
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,387
It was all a big mistake.

1416
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,888
That's very good.

1417
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:09,891
You should be scared,
because I know
all about it.

1418
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:12,894
All I have to do
is call the police.

1419
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:14,896
It really
was a mistake.

1420
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,899
Violet put the poison in
strictly by accident.

1421
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:20,360
She might get a jury
to believe that.

1422
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,861
Then again, she might not.

1423
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:24,698
But the big question here
is whether or not

1424
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:25,949
you want to take
that chance.

1425
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,118
What are you
driving at?

1426
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,619
It's very simple.

1427
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:31,454
You come over
to my house,

1428
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:33,290
and I'll forget
the whole thing.

1429
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:34,874
You are disgusting.

1430
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,418
Is that a no?

1431
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,378
Too bad.

1432
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:39,963
Mr. Hart,
I'm begging you,

1433
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,881
think about
what you're doing.

1434
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:45,427
I didn't start this.
You three girls
did all the plotting.

1435
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,262
I won't let you
do this!

1436
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,723
There's another phone
over there, Doralee.

1437
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,391
Incidentally,
that's something else

1438
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,727
you might want
to think about.

1439
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,229
I'm very funny,
but I don't like it

1440
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:58,648
when people give back
my presents.

1441
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,608
Oh, you are rotten,
Mr. Hart.

1442
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:02,610
Did anybody
ever tell you that?

1443
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:06,114
I never thought
I'd say this about
another human being,

1444
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,825
but you are evil‒
evil to the core!

1445
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,328
I love it when you
get mad like that.

1446
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:15,457
If you touch that phone,
I'll jerk it
clean out of the wall.

1447
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,334
Ooh...

1448
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,294
I mean it!

1449
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,005
You think this
is all a joke.

1450
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,174
You're going to
listen to me

1451
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,009
whether you like it
or not!

1452
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,928
Will you shut up now
and let me explain
what happened?

1453
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:32,140
Let me loose
or I'm calling for help.

1454
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:35,268
No, I don't want you
to call for help.

1455
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:38,271
You won't listen,
but you'll shut up
and stay there!

1456
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:40,857
I got to figure out
what to do.

1457
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:44,694
Roz.

1458
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:46,196
Is Mr. Hart in?

1459
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:50,200
Yeah‒well, yeah,
but he's tied up
at the moment.

1460
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:51,201
Oh. Well...

1461
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,870
I guess it can wait
until Monday.

1462
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,372
Have a nice weekend.

1463
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,831
Yeah, you, too, Roz.

1464
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:57,874
Oh, Judy.

1465
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,335
Can you come here
a second?

1466
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,836
You ready, Doralee?

1467
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,839
No! Something awful
has happened.
Where's Violet?

1468
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:07,842
She's in
the storage room.
What's the matter?

1469
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:10,345
Hart knows everything
about last night.

1470
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,429
What?

1471
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:14,682
He really thinks
we were trying to kill him.

1472
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,185
He was going to
have us arrested.

1473
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:18,686
Oh, dear God.

1474
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,688
Get in there
and watch him.

1475
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,191
Lock that door,
and don't let
anybody in.

1476
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,526
I'm getting Violet.

1477
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,736
Oh, dear God.

1478
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,656
Oh, dear God.

1479
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,247
Mr. Hart, I'm so sorry.

1480
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,417
What?

1481
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,420
Oh, I can't understand
what you're saying.

1482
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:49,259
Thank God one of you
has come to your senses.

1483
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:50,677
Now get me loose.

1484
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,096
Doralee didn't mean
any harm, Mr. Hart.

1485
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,597
Just get me untied, okay?

1486
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:56,933
I can't do that
until they come back.

1487
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,394
You think
I'm going to run away?

1488
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,896
I won't do anything.
I give you
my word of honor.

1489
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:06,276
Just get me untied.
There's a little pain
involved here.

1490
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,777
Oh, I'm sorry.

1491
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,780
Maybe I'll just
loosen it a little bit.

1492
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:12,115
Good. Loosen it.

1493
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:15,076
You've got to understand
what happened last night.

1494
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,079
It was just a series
of misunderstandings.

1495
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:20,582
Violet didn't mean
to kill you.

1496
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:24,085
She just accidentally
put rat poison
in your coffee.

1497
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:26,087
Get out of my way!

1498
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,088
Mr. Hart.

1499
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,424
Mr. Hart,
you gave me your word!

1500
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,967
I lied.

1501
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,469
God damn it.

1502
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:34,429
You're not leaving
this office.

1503
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,972
Watch me.

1504
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,475
I was just pretending
a while ago,

1505
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,977
but this thing
is getting out of hand.

1506
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,605
Nobody makes a fool
out of me
in my own office.

1507
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,148
I'm calling the police.

1508
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,984
Hold it right there.

1509
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,488
You're as crazy
as the other two.

1510
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:54,699
Close that door
or I'll shoot.

1511
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,620
Aah!

1512
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,331
Hold it! Don't shoot!
I give up!

1513
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,333
Don't shoot it!

1514
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,168
Judy, put it‒

1515
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:06,836
Judy, what are you doing?

1516
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,964
Oh, my God.

1517
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:11,591
Christ.

1518
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,761
He‒He was going
to call the police.

1519
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,527
I just feel terrible
doing this to him.

1520
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:34,531
We'll get him to his place
and try to reason with him.

1521
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:37,283
His wife's on vacation,
and that house
is so far off the road,

1522
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,953
if he yells,
ain't nobody gonna hear him.

1523
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,380
So what do we do now?

1524
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,839
You'll pay for this.

1525
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:54,467
I swear you'll pay for this.

1526
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,885
If you'd only listen.

1527
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,178
You listen to me.

1528
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,431
I'll see you all in prison
before I'm through.

1529
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:01,432
Kidnapping.

1530
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:02,725
Attempted murder.

1531
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,185
Roped, beaten,

1532
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,728
rat poison.

1533
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:08,648
I won't rest
until you all get
20 years in prison!

1534
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,191
You understand that?

1535
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:11,276
20 years!

1536
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:13,903
God!

1537
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,823
We can't just
keep him here forever.

1538
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,324
Oh, you heard him.

1539
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:19,826
He don't believe us.

1540
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,327
He wants
to prosecute.

1541
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:22,954
Why wouldn't he?
He's got you
for poisoning him

1542
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,247
and me for roping him

1543
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:28,501
and you for acting like
he was first prize
in a turkey shoot.

1544
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:32,505
How are we going
to keep him from talking?

1545
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,425
I say we hire
a couple of wranglers

1546
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,677
to go upstairs
and beat the shit
out of him.

1547
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:44,183
If we could only
find something on him,
maybe we could trade off.

1548
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,935
Blackmail.
All that sounds good.

1549
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:48,021
What could we
get on him?

1550
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,774
A sex scandal.

1551
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:55,111
Take a picture of him
in bed with a prostitute.

1552
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,780
Oh, who would care?

1553
01:16:57,864 --> 01:17:00,241
Hart would just
buy up the copies

1554
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:03,244
and send them out
as Christmas cards.

1555
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:07,206
Oh, Lord.

1556
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,677
We've gone over
everything.

1557
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,680
Well, we might
as well face it.

1558
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:25,224
He's got us.
We're licked.

1559
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,144
Wait a minute.
What's this doing here?

1560
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,730
What?

1561
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:35,985
Maybe we do have something
to bargain with after all.

1562
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:37,320
What is it?

1563
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:41,032
An account book
for Ajax Warehouse.

1564
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,919
There's
something suspicious
going on here.

1565
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,922
This is out
in the middle of nowhere.

1566
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,508
What do you see?

1567
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,009
Nothing.
It's too dark.

1568
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:03,054
Why don't you
climb up to that window?

1569
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:20,321
I think we got him.

1570
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:22,824
Ha, ha, ha!
I think we got him!

1571
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:23,991
Aah!

1572
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,953
Whoo! Yes, indeed,

1573
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,123
it looks like Frank
has been a very
naughty boy.

1574
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,291
An empty warehouse?

1575
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,044
What's wrong with that?

1576
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,547
That's what
Billie Sol Estes
said,

1577
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,049
and they gave him
15 years
for embezzlement.

1578
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,552
That warehouse
is supposed to be
filled with inventory

1579
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,137
from Consolidated.

1580
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,973
But you sold it
and pocketed the money.

1581
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,725
You can't prove that.

1582
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:51,185
I'm going to order
the invoices

1583
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,187
from head office,
on Monday.

1584
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:57,567
I think you'll...
see the light
when they arrive.

1585
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,527
You start tangling with me,

1586
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,530
you'd better be prepared
to play very rough,

1587
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:05,533
because I'm not
going to be stopped

1588
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,493
by three
dumb-witted broads.

1589
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:08,578
I'm not‒

1590
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,915
I'm going to get loose.

1591
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,917
I'm going to break loose

1592
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:18,421
if I have to kill somebody
to do it.

1593
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:21,424
To keep him tied up
three of four days,

1594
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:24,177
we need a better
system of confinement.

1595
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,596
Yes. Something that
limits his movement,

1596
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:30,349
but it should
wear well
and be comfortable.

1597
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:55,917
We figure you'll
sign our statement
by the end of the week,

1598
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,419
and then we'll
be able to let you go.

1599
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:00,922
I got all the razors
and the scissors

1600
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,924
and all the glass,
just in case.

1601
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,426
I brought you
some books and magazines.

1602
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,928
This one is really good.

1603
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:09,931
This'll keep you
up-to-date on all
the soap operas.

1604
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,433
Once you watch them,
you really get hooked.

1605
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:13,935
And I got you cigars.

1606
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:17,438
Judy will stay at night,
Doralee will bring
your lunch,

1607
01:20:17,522 --> 01:20:20,441
and in the daytime,
we have this little
security system.

1608
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:22,777
I paid for it
on your
Master Charge.

1609
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,487
You're out of your mind.

1610
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,490
You think you can
keep me here for a week?

1611
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,158
For Christ's sake,
I'm the boss.

1612
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:31,828
Don't you think I might
be missed at the office?

1613
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,164
Franklin Hart's office.

1614
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:37,458
No, he's, uh, not here
right now.

1615
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:38,835
Can I help you?

1616
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:41,671
Yes, Mr. Strell.

1617
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,131
Judy Bernly. Please hold.

1618
01:20:45,216 --> 01:20:47,009
Judy Bernly. Please hold.

1619
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,511
Hello. Judy Bernly.

1620
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:50,513
Hey, Violet.

1621
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,515
What can I
do you for, Bob?

1622
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,517
Would you look at this?

1623
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,143
I can't make it out.

1624
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:59,647
But, Doralee,
I want to talk
to him today.

1625
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,649
Well, I will tell him.

1626
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,678
He's not here.

1627
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:33,639
He's not? Well,
that's kind of funny.

1628
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,474
I thought he was.

1629
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,938
Well, he hasn't
gone to lunch.

1630
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:42,440
His coat's still here.

1631
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:45,401
Look at that.
I've told him
a hundred times

1632
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,403
this can be
very dangerous.

1633
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,906
I'm sure
he'll be back, Roz.

1634
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:51,407
You want to wait?

1635
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,911
No, thank you,
but please tell him
it's very important

1636
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:56,913
I talk to him
sometime today.

1637
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:59,415
I will "soitenly"
tell him, Roz.

1638
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,918
She is going
to be tough.

1639
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,419
Hmm.
What about the others?

1640
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,921
Piece of cake.

1641
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:07,924
There were a few
questions we need
answered from‒

1642
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,425
Yeah, I saw those.

1643
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,427
And some letters
you should see,

1644
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,930
but other than that
I think we're fine.

1645
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,432
Did you want
a cup of coffee?

1646
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,352
Oh. Sorry.

1647
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,378
Hello, Mr. Hart.

1648
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,587
It's lunch.

1649
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:50,716
Where's the tray stand
that was here yesterday?

1650
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,846
Oh, uh, it's behind
that pile of stuff
over there.

1651
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:01,894
Aah!

1652
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:05,815
Doralee!

1653
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,733
Damn it!

1654
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:09,902
I'll get your ass!

1655
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:11,570
Promise.

1656
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:17,785
I don't understand.

1657
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,787
Did you give him
my message?

1658
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:23,290
Yes, but he left the office
just this second.

1659
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:26,419
But I'll bet you can
still catch him.

1660
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:27,336
Judy!

1661
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,338
Do you see Mr. Hart?

1662
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:30,673
Uh, yes.

1663
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,551
Well, stop him.

1664
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,844
Mr. Hart!

1665
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:37,513
Mr. Hart!

1666
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:38,931
Mr. Hart!

1667
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:40,016
Mr.‒

1668
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:43,019
Oh, you just
missed him.

1669
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,603
Mmm.

1670
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,278
We can't keep that up
all week.

1671
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,281
You're right.
She's going
to be a problem.

1672
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,285
I've got
some bad news.

1673
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,956
Here's the telex
from head office
in New York.

1674
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,542
They've started
the computer changeover.

1675
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,503
They won't be able
to send us

1676
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:12,006
the inventory invoices
for Ajax Warehouse

1677
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,717
for another
four to six weeks.

1678
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,177
Four to six weeks?

1679
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,388
We have to keep Hart
tied up all that time?

1680
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:21,891
Do we have a choice?

1681
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:24,852
I think we can
pull it off.

1682
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:27,855
I never realized
how unpopular
Hart is.

1683
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:29,565
Nobody wants
to see him
face-to-face.

1684
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:32,151
Except Roz.

1685
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:37,073
What if we sent Roz
on vacation?

1686
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:38,574
That's only two weeks.

1687
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:41,077
We've got to
keep her away longer.

1688
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,954
Have you ever
heard of the Aspen
Language Center?

1689
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:45,456
It's one
of these places

1690
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,459
that gives you very
concentrated lessons
in foreign languages.

1691
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,461
Why don't we
send her there?

1692
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,463
You know,
that's not half bad.

1693
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:57,009
We could get Hart
to write her
that it's top-secret.

1694
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:58,761
Consolidated is opening
overseas centers,

1695
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:00,346
and they need executives
who can...

1696
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,306
I don't know‒
Speak French.

1697
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:03,933
Do you think
she'd go?

1698
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,519
Are you kidding?
If Hart asked her to?

1699
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,945
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1700
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,446
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1701
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:19,657
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1702
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,617
Hmm.

1703
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,577
It was just so easy.

1704
01:25:23,661 --> 01:25:27,081
I just typed up this memo
and signed Hart's name.

1705
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:29,583
She doesn't get back
until the 15th,

1706
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:32,586
and Missy doesn't return
until the 24th.

1707
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:35,089
Don't you feel sorry
for Missy?

1708
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:38,092
I'll have Hart
send her some flowers
in Tahiti.

1709
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,593
How's everything
upstairs?

1710
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:40,594
Very subdued.

1711
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:42,596
I think he's
plotting something.

1712
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,515
It's going to be
a race

1713
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,517
to see if he can
get free

1714
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,020
before we
get the invoices,
sometime around here.

1715
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:52,523
While I'm at it,
I'll just have Hart

1716
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:55,025
let everybody
keep flowers
on their desks.

1717
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,194
Change some things
around that office.

1718
01:25:57,278 --> 01:26:00,281
Some of those rules of his
are so depressing.

1719
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:25,848
It's looking good.

1720
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:29,185
But why don't we
make some changes
that really count?

1721
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:30,269
Yeah.

1722
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:02,176
<i>Like sands
through the hourglass,</i>

1723
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:05,137
<i>so are the
days of our lives.</i>

1724
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:41,924
I'm happy to see

1725
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,343
you still have
a hearty appetite.

1726
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:46,345
And I'll see you
tomorrow.

1727
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,847
If you keep being
a good boy,

1728
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:51,976
you'll be out of here
the end of the week.

1729
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:54,973
Aah!

1730
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:58,811
Dick.

1731
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:00,687
Can I come in?

1732
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:05,901
Thanks.

1733
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,403
It's cold out there.

1734
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:09,405
Dick, what are you
doing here?

1735
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,907
You're supposed to be
in Mexico.

1736
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,409
I was.
I came back.

1737
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:16,078
Dick,
you can't stay here.

1738
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,163
You're here alone,
aren't you?

1739
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:21,917
W-Well, yes. I'm...

1740
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,211
house-sitting
for a friend.

1741
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:28,215
Yeah. I've been
casing the house
the last few days to make sure.

1742
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:31,343
You could spare
a cup of coffee

1743
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:33,512
for your freezing
old husband,
couldn't you?

1744
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,181
Ex-husband.

1745
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:38,434
Well, all right.
You sit down,

1746
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:41,478
but then you're going
to have to go.

1747
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:55,409
It was no good
from the start.

1748
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:56,410
Nothing worked.

1749
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:59,371
She left
after the first week.

1750
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:04,418
Maybe you could
call me tomorrow
at work

1751
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:06,044
and we could
have lunch,

1752
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:07,463
talk some more.

1753
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:09,465
I've wanted to see you.

1754
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,967
I followed you
from the office.

1755
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:15,554
I thought maybe
you were living
with someone.

1756
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:17,431
No.

1757
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,488
What was that?

1758
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:33,989
Oh, it's nothing.

1759
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:35,991
Probably the cat.
I'd better check.

1760
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,660
I'll go with you.
It's all right.
I'll be right back.

1761
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:41,330
Judy, you look
beautiful as ever.

1762
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,415
Thanks.

1763
01:32:02,935 --> 01:32:04,520
Holy shit!

1764
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:05,521
Oh!

1765
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:08,190
Oh, my God.

1766
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:20,035
Let go of me!

1767
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:22,079
Get away from me!

1768
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,039
Hey!

1769
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:26,041
Oh! Hey!
Stay away!

1770
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:27,918
Stay away!
I'll kill you!

1771
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:34,800
I'll kill you!

1772
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,016
Let go!

1773
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,393
Help!

1774
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:45,477
Help!

1775
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,312
Let go!

1776
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:48,855
Judy?

1777
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,857
Dick.

1778
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:57,072
Let me down!
When I get
my hands on you‒

1779
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:00,701
Judy.

1780
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:02,160
You shut up!

1781
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,751
What's going on?

1782
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:10,919
Nothing.

1783
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:12,087
Who's in that room?

1784
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,589
Nobody.
Let's go downstairs.

1785
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:16,592
Judy, there's somebody
in that room. Let me see.

1786
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:17,593
Good God.

1787
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,428
Oh.

1788
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,390
Who is that?

1789
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:24,474
A friend.

1790
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:25,601
Obviously.

1791
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:28,270
So, that's what
you're into now. Bondage.

1792
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:29,271
What's that?

1793
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,440
Bondage. S and M.
Sex games.

1794
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:34,735
That's right.
I'm into everything.
Now get out of here.

1795
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:35,944
I can't believe it.

1796
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:37,279
Who is that guy?

1797
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:38,447
He's my boss.

1798
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,450
An affair with your boss.
Isn't that typical!

1799
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,785
Just like you had one
with your secretary.

1800
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:46,955
But, Judy, this isn't you.
You can't be serious.

1801
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:49,958
Don't tell me
what I can or can't do.

1802
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:51,460
Those days are over!

1803
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:55,464
And if I want
to have an affair
or play sex games

1804
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,175
or do M&Ms,
you can't stop me!

1805
01:33:58,258 --> 01:33:59,301
M&Ms?

1806
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:01,595
Matter of fact,
I smoke pot.

1807
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:04,097
I see what
it's done to you!

1808
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:05,057
Well, I've changed.

1809
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,476
I'll say. And not
for the better!

1810
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:11,438
And I came here
tonight to ask you
to come back... Ha!

1811
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:12,814
Fat chance.

1812
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:16,610
Your leaving was
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1813
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:19,071
If that's
the way you feel,

1814
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:20,572
there's
nothing more to say.

1815
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:21,990
Oh, yes, there is.

1816
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:26,328
Hit the road, buster.
This is where you get off.

1817
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:37,923
What are we going
to do about Roz?
She gets back on Friday.

1818
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:39,925
Well, if she causes
any more trouble,

1819
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:43,428
we'll send her back
to language school
to learn German.

1820
01:34:43,512 --> 01:34:44,346
Bet she would.

1821
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:45,597
Talking about Roz?

1822
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:47,891
Forget her. I just
talked to New York.

1823
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,268
The invoices will
be here Friday morning.

1824
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:53,313
Perfect, three more days.
Ooh, good.

1825
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,295
Uh, driver, would you
bring the bags inside,
please?

1826
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:41,862
Missy.

1827
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:43,321
Frank.

1828
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:46,283
What on earth
are you up to?

1829
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:04,426
Operator?

1830
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,428
Uh, good morning.

1831
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:09,848
Uh, would you find
a number for me, please?

1832
01:36:12,851 --> 01:36:13,935
Hello?

1833
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:15,645
<i>Doralee,
this is Missy Hart.</i>

1834
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:16,938
Missy.

1835
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:20,442
Frank told me
never to call anybody
at the office,

1836
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,778
so I'm calling
you at home.

1837
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,613
I wanted to thank you.

1838
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,614
Thank me?

1839
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:28,617
I just realized
it must have been you

1840
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:32,287
who sent me
those beautiful flowers
during my trip.

1841
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,289
And you signed
Frank's name.

1842
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:36,458
Well, it was his idea.

1843
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:39,419
Oh, no, no, no.
It wasn't. I asked him.

1844
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:41,797
That's why
I came back early...

1845
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,591
Missy, did you just say
you've come back?

1846
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,134
Yeah, three days ago.

1847
01:36:46,218 --> 01:36:49,638
Frank sent me to a hotel
for another week.

1848
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:53,642
He's trying out
some kind of new exercise
program at the house.

1849
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,143
Oh, my goodness.

1850
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:58,146
You should see what
he's done to our bedroom.

1851
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:02,192
Hello? Hello?

1852
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:10,450
Hello.

1853
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,452
What?

1854
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:14,454
I don't believe it.

1855
01:37:14,538 --> 01:37:18,792
If she's back, then Hart
must've been free
for the last three days.

1856
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,044
Listen, call Judy
right away.

1857
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:25,173
If Hart's been doing
what I think he's been doing,
we've been had.

1858
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:28,927
That's silly. I just
brought him breakfast.
He's tied up.

1859
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:30,387
Or he's just pretending.

1860
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:32,180
Look, you keep
ahold of my gun.

1861
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:35,392
I'm coming over.
Sit tight till I get there.

1862
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,376
Judy?

1863
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:05,964
Judy.

1864
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:07,966
He found your gun.

1865
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:20,437
Wait a minute.

1866
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,772
What happened
to the time clock?

1867
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:24,274
You retired it.

1868
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:26,943
What does
that mean?

1869
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:28,445
Well, while
you were away,

1870
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:30,947
we managed
to make a few changes.

1871
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:33,408
Changes? What changes?

1872
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,337
Holy shit.

1873
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:58,099
What the hell
is going on?
Who authorized this?

1874
01:38:58,183 --> 01:39:01,102
You did, Mr. Hart.
It's your signature.

1875
01:39:01,186 --> 01:39:04,773
What are all these
people doing here?
It's not even 9:00.

1876
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:06,274
It's another
of your programs.

1877
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:07,609
It's called
flexible hours.

1878
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:09,611
People set
their own time.

1879
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:11,112
Some work
8:00 to 4:00

1880
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:13,615
or 10:00 to 6:00
or 9:00 to 5:00.

1881
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:16,618
Well, I'll put
a stop to that.
Let's go, girls.

1882
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,953
Let's go.

1883
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,955
Sir, it's working
very nicely.

1884
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:22,457
Less absenteeism.
People really like it.

1885
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:25,418
Oh, do they?
Well, I hate it,
and what I say goes.

1886
01:39:25,502 --> 01:39:28,630
Just keep going
to my office.

1887
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,468
Good morning, Violet.
Here it is.

1888
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:34,970
Oh, thanks, Eric.

1889
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:40,809
Here are the invoices
we've been waiting for.
They're worthless now.

1890
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,311
He's managed to put
all that missing equipment

1891
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:44,980
back into the warehouse.

1892
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:49,567
Cost me a pretty penny
to set it straight.

1893
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:52,237
Well, you've won.
You've trumped our ace.

1894
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,780
So now what?

1895
01:39:53,863 --> 01:39:55,240
Oh, I'm sorry, Violet.

1896
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,242
Why don't you
sit down there?

1897
01:39:57,325 --> 01:40:00,870
I'm just getting ready
to send you three
bitches to jail.

1898
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,089
Hello.

1899
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:12,424
What?

1900
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:14,259
Who's here?

1901
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,429
Jeez,
I'll be right out.

1902
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:19,431
And you better
tell Hart.

1903
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:26,771
What?

1904
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:29,107
When?

1905
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,942
Holy shit.

1906
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:32,444
No, no. No problem.

1907
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:33,945
Okay, right. Thanks.

1908
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:34,946
What is it?

1909
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:36,364
Tinsworthy's here.

1910
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:37,699
Who's that?

1911
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,785
Russell Tinsworthy,
the goddamn
chairman of the board.

1912
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:43,288
He's here to meet
with me.

1913
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:46,082
All right, just...

1914
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:50,962
Violet, you've
got to stand by me.

1915
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:00,096
Holy shit,
there he is.

1916
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:10,065
Here's the man himself,
Mr. Tinsworthy.

1917
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:11,399
Franklin Hart.

1918
01:41:11,483 --> 01:41:15,028
Frank Hart.
My boy, I would like
to shake your hand.

1919
01:41:16,488 --> 01:41:18,406
And here is a, uh,

1920
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:21,076
small token
of my esteem.

1921
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:23,745
Thank you, sir.
It's an honor
meeting you.

1922
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:26,539
You know, I don't
get up here very often.

1923
01:41:26,623 --> 01:41:29,417
But I keep tabs
on the situation
through Perkins.

1924
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:31,419
And when I find
a division

1925
01:41:31,503 --> 01:41:33,922
that shows a 20% rise
in productivity

1926
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,924
over a period
of six weeks,

1927
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:38,593
I want to meet the man
who's responsible.

1928
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:41,930
Huh, well, I...
We all appreciate that.

1929
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:45,558
You've managed to create
a very, very splendid
environment here.

1930
01:41:45,642 --> 01:41:47,936
Very livable,
very personal.

1931
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:50,939
Well, I find it very...
I don't know.

1932
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:54,275
The people seem
to like it.

1933
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:57,904
Keep the crew happy
and you can't go wrong,
eh, Frank?

1934
01:41:57,987 --> 01:41:59,447
That's the idea, sir.

1935
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:02,283
Mr. Tinsworthy's
interested in

1936
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,911
some of those other
new programs of yours.

1937
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:05,912
Uh-huh.

1938
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:08,039
Like the job-sharing program.

1939
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:10,291
Job-sharing.

1940
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:12,377
A bold concept.

1941
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,045
How's it working out?

1942
01:42:14,129 --> 01:42:16,506
Well, I think
very well, sir.

1943
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:19,008
Um... well, Violet.

1944
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:22,595
Sorry, Mr. Tinsworthy.
I'd like you to meet
Violet Newstead.

1945
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:24,764
She's my senior supervisor.

1946
01:42:24,848 --> 01:42:26,724
I'm very happy
to meet you.

1947
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:28,101
How do you do?

1948
01:42:28,184 --> 01:42:30,436
I've heard a lot of
wonderful things
about you.

1949
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,437
Thank you.

1950
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:33,106
Violet is my right arm
around here.

1951
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:38,444
In fact, Violet,
explain to Mr. Tinsworthy
the job-sharing situation.

1952
01:42:38,528 --> 01:42:40,947
It's been most effective,
Mr. Tinsworthy.

1953
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:43,992
Maria Delgado
is a perfect example.

1954
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,368
She shares her job
with another worker

1955
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:47,245
who takes over
in the afternoon.

1956
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:49,455
She does?
I mean, she does.

1957
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:50,915
Both women are happy,

1958
01:42:50,999 --> 01:42:52,917
and we couldn't
be more pleased

1959
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:54,419
with their
performance.

1960
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,171
So you
pulled it off?

1961
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:58,256
Well, I like
to think we did.

1962
01:42:58,339 --> 01:43:00,758
Good. Like
the day care center.

1963
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:01,759
Day care center?

1964
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:03,761
That reminds me,
during the war,

1965
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:05,763
I set up day care centers

1966
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:07,098
in all
the defense plants.

1967
01:43:07,182 --> 01:43:08,725
Glad you
brought it back.

1968
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:10,226
That's the idea.
It...

1969
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:12,520
The day care center...

1970
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:15,064
Would you like to see it?
It's just down the hall.

1971
01:43:15,148 --> 01:43:18,902
Thank you. I can see
why Frank reposes
such trust in you.

1972
01:43:18,985 --> 01:43:19,903
Ha, ha. Exactly.

1973
01:43:19,986 --> 01:43:20,904
Thank you.

1974
01:43:20,987 --> 01:43:22,280
Violet...

1975
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:26,576
Our day care center
has been open two weeks.

1976
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:28,077
It's been wonderfully
successful.

1977
01:43:28,161 --> 01:43:29,412
Really?

1978
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:31,414
Yes, our working
parents love it.

1979
01:43:31,497 --> 01:43:34,876
Oh, Mr. Hart. It's so
good to see you again.

1980
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:36,085
Who are you?

1981
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:37,629
Don't you recognize me?

1982
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,714
Margaret Foster.

1983
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:41,007
The old lush?

1984
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:42,675
Yes! That was me.

1985
01:43:42,759 --> 01:43:44,636
But thanks
to the company's

1986
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:49,098
alcoholics rehabilitation
program you started,
those days are over.

1987
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:53,978
I'll never forget
those wonderful letters
of encouragement you sent.

1988
01:43:55,355 --> 01:43:57,482
God bless you,
Mr. Hart.

1989
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:58,942
Good to see you.

1990
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:00,443
Doesn't she look great?

1991
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:01,486
Hold this.

1992
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:05,782
When we transformed it,
the cost was minimal.

1993
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:08,910
It's cut down on absenteeism,
and we loved doing it.

1994
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,621
Well, Frank, I got
to give you credit.

1995
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:13,915
You really
pulled it off.

1996
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:16,918
That equal pay thing, though,
that's, uh, got to go.

1997
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:17,919
Oh, yes.

1998
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,128
It's a good incentive,

1999
01:44:19,212 --> 01:44:22,465
but we don't need to keep on
priming the pump.

2000
01:44:22,548 --> 01:44:25,468
I've been talking
to Hinkle over here.

2001
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:26,928
Here, take her.

2002
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:31,516
And, uh, you're my kind
of guy, Frank.

2003
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:34,477
Creative, incisive,
get the job done.

2004
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,561
Right, sir.

2005
01:44:35,645 --> 01:44:38,147
Now, I want you
to work with me.

2006
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:39,315
Excuse me?

2007
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:41,651
I need a man
like you, Frank.

2008
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:44,612
A Brazilian operation
is just about to take off.

2009
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:45,697
Brazil, sir?

2010
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:47,782
You're going to
love it down there.

2011
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:49,450
You'll get
a handsome bonus,

2012
01:44:49,534 --> 01:44:52,370
and you'll be
doing me a big favor.

2013
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:55,123
Yes, but, how can
I move to Brazil?

2014
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,292
Take a leave of absence.
Right, Hinkle?

2015
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:58,793
Anything you say, R.T.

2016
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:01,462
We'll go upstairs
and work this thing out.

2017
01:45:01,546 --> 01:45:03,464
My team needs you
right away.

2018
01:45:03,548 --> 01:45:05,800
Mr. Tinsworthy,
I appreciate this.

2019
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:06,801
Teamwork, teamwork.

2020
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:08,803
That's what
it's all about, huh?

2021
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:11,306
Go where you're
most needed
when you're most needed.

2022
01:45:11,389 --> 01:45:12,807
Mr. Tinsworthy,
the jungle...

2023
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,810
Hell, man! I'm offering you
the chance of a lifetime.

2024
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:19,147
Two or three years there,
you'll never want
to come back.

2025
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:20,606
Two or three years?

2026
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:22,817
Yeah, you'll love it
down there.

2027
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,152
Healthy climate.

2028
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,236
Mr. Tinsworthy.

2029
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,238
Hart!

2030
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:29,490
Let me tell you
one thing.

2031
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:33,161
I ain't the kind of boy
takes no for an answer.
Yes, sir.

2032
01:45:34,412 --> 01:45:36,622
Brazil?

2033
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,669
Did you see the look
on his face?

2034
01:45:41,753 --> 01:45:44,213
I almost felt
sorry for him.

2035
01:45:44,297 --> 01:45:46,090
We actually
pulled it off.

2036
01:45:46,174 --> 01:45:47,592
And we didn't panic.

2037
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:50,595
And Tinsworthy
loved what we did.

2038
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,930
Everything except
that part about the money.

2039
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:54,766
What'll we do
about that?

2040
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:56,768
We've come this far,
haven't we?

2041
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,603
This is just
the beginning.

2042
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,438
And here's
to the beginning.

2043
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:01,939
I'll drink to that.

2044
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:03,107
To the beginning.

2045
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:06,110
