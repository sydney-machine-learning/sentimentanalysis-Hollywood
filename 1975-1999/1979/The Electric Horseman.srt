1
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,706
Take it easy, we're comin'.
Shake it up, we gotta go.

2
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,918
What do you think I'm doin'? I'm pushin'
his boot and he won't even help.

3
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,380
# Whiskey river... don't run dry...

4
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,882
- All right, here.
- Thanks.

5
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,511
Hey, how about a little coffee?

6
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,598
Here you go... Can you use a little of that?

7
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,269
Put his arm in that sleeve, Leroy.

8
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,521
Got a little somethin' to go with that?

9
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,773
- Got his wires?
- Go get my wires.

10
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,569
- You said to put his arm in the sleeve.
- Button his shirt.

11
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,031
Button his shirt, put his arm
in the sleeve and get the wire.

12
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,826
- His hat. Where's his hat?
- I'm buttoning his shirt.

13
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,038
Ooh... It's pinchin' my hair.

14
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,832
Come on, let's go. Here we go, rollin'.

15
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,168
I'm all right. Let me go.

16
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,341
- Is he gonna make it?
- Sure. Don't he always?

17
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,258
No.

18
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:27,142

00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,801
<i>Well, there he comes, there he comes.
Give him a big hand, folks.</i>

24
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,386
<i>There he is. How about that?</i>

25
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:10,727

29
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,285
- Wendell...
- Shut up.

30
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,291
Oh, shit.

00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:58,191
For all you hard-playin' little folks

35
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,820
...you remember
that Ranch Breakfast... uh...

36
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,906
...is the cereal that builds champions.

37
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:10,453
It's explodin' with a kind of energy
that's... that's got more stuff in it, uh...

38
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,956
...than toast, and bacon...

39
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,209
- Eggs.
- Eggs...

40
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,504
And toast, and bacon, and, uh...

41
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,925
...meat loaf, and olives...

...nuts...

43
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,849

Just so much good stuff...

Hey, it's Lucinda. Lucinda.
Lucinda Fairlee. You...

51
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,046
The JB Ranch trick cowgirl rider.

52
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,840
OK, up we go. Hello, how you doin'?

53
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,385
You don't remember me?

54
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,057
Last month, after the Watsonville Rodeo?

55
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,395
Mommy!

56
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,064
I know how you feel.

57
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,569
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,

<i>...Ampco Industries, the rising star.</i>

63
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,927
Well, I won my rent
on that sucker many a time.

64
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,888
- Horse should be standin' stud.
- We all should.

65
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,058
That's the beauty
you're ridin' in Vegas Friday.

66
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,353
He ain't gonna ride him.
Just sit on him up on the stage...

67
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,981
...and he's gonna have
little rubber booties on his hooves.

68
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,193
Leroy, you wanna sign this?
It's for that Watkins kid.

69
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,280
He drawed ol' Little Venus over
in Fairview. Let's send him some luck.

70
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,116
I don't think he's gonna need it.

71
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,953
- You stayed on worse than Little Venus.
- Ain't no worse than Little Venus.

72
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,958
The hell there ain't. Nameless was worse,
and he did eight on Nameless.

73
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,045
Well, I ain't on Nameless any more.
And I got no intention of bein'.

74
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,507
That was a little compliment there.

75
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,719
Here's a ranch for sale in Baily. 450 acres.

76
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,015
You shoulda got that place at Spanish
Fork instead of that Malibu house.

77
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,311
Oh, Spanish... What's the matter
with the Malibu house?

78
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,649
I don't remember your minding it so much.
You was in the water half the time...

79
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,112
...wearin' them flippers, lookin' dumb,
actin' like a damn penguin.

80
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:54,534
What's the matter with you pickers?
You're not on the bacon-and-bean circuit.

81
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,330
You got room service, you're flyin' around
first class, you got limousines...

82
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,959
...ladies in the lobby,
the laundry has tissue paper in it...

83
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:08,506
You're livin' like a bunch of fat oil barons!
Livin'... better than we got a right to.

84
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,803
- Cowboys in the ocean makes no sense.
- Beats havin' a bull tap-dance on you.

85
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:18,766
- Leroy, get them pants pressed, will you?
- And it beats havin' your legs braided.

86
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,478
And it beats havin' a bull
use your head for a floor mat. Don't it?

87
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
Ah...

88
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,078

89

# Even with someone they love

95
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,414
We'd have been here sooner,
but we ran into these, uh, javelinas...

96
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,917
- Can I have a coffee?
- Just a minute...

97
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,378
- There's no rush.
- There ain't?

98
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,130
Come on. I wanna show you something.

99
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:37,095
<i>...tonight's half-time highlight,

Well, what in the hell...?!

104
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,202
- That's not me.
- They don't know the difference.

105
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,939
What's your name?
How come you're so cute?

106
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,528
- What time's the press conference?
- Uh, got half an hour.

107
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,697
Here you are, Hallie.

108
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,201
Now, if there's anything you need,
just say the word.

109
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,413
We got about half a dozen
movie people here...

110
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,416
...Bud Broderick,
Joanna Camden just came in...

111
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,752
...Rising Star is here...
- What are you gonna do with the horse?

112
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:56,465
He'll appear on stage with Sonny Steele,
the cowboy we use in Ranch Breakfast.

113
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,051
You think he's worth coverin'?

114
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,389
Well, there's better stuff.
I mean, the cowboy's a peach of a guy...

115
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:08,019
...but there's just a lot of "yup"
and "shucks", and stuff like that.

116
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,980
He's no interview.
Better steer clear of him.

117
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,026
See you downstairs.

118
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:22,241
Bernie... So, they don't want us
to talk to the cowboy.

119
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:26,412
- Where do you wanna start?
- Where do I wanna start?!

120
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,218
Excuse me, please.

121
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,182
- Where the hell is he?
- Probably drunk in Barstow somewhere.

122
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:53,856
Excuse me, could you tell me
if Mr Sonny Steele has checked in yet?

123
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,527
No, he's not listed.

124
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,908
- It's an interesting watchband.
- Thank you. It's Indian.

125
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,452
- May I see it?
- Sure.

126
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,791
Oh, it's lovely.

127
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:17,004
Why does Ampco say absolutely
no interviews with Sonny Steele?

128
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,175
- Who told you that?
- Oh, one of the people at Ampco.

129
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,179
That don't really
mean anything, you know.

130
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,558
Sonny hasn't been himself lately.
They're a little down on him. But it's OK.

131
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,354
He's just a cowboy. Sometimes
he loses the best part of himself.

132
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,981
What is the best part of himself?

133
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>- You'd have to know him a long time.
- How long have you known him?</i>

134
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,364
<i># Cowboys ain't easy to love</i>

135
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,075
<i># And they're harder to hold</i>

<i># And they'd rather give you a song
than diamonds and gold</i>

137

<i># Lone Star belt buckles

138

140
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,471
<i># And he don't die young</i>

141
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,808
<i># He'll probably just ride away</i>

142
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,704
- Where the hell you been?
- What's he doin' in a parking lot?

143
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,665
I don't know, but he got here on time.
Come on.

144
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,296
Press conference has started and Danny
Miles has waited all day to rehearse you.

145
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,674
- Well, here you are.
- Wendell, what do I have to do?

146
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,053
Well, there's been all kind of hell to pay,
so just behave yourself.

147
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,517
Boy, you smell like a tequila factory.
Here, put these Tic Tacs in your mouth.

148
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,438
You'll never guess who I seen.
Rush, and Hawkman, and old Edgar...

149
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,525
Hey, watch it there, partner!
They all send their hellos.

150
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,403
Foggy Tate's wife Louise
gave me this handkerchief.

151
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,158
- I told you he was in Barstow.
- Whew! God, they got pretty girls here!

152
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:14,705
Come on. This is a serious thing to these
people. They're tryin' to buy this big bank.

153
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,750
- Hold it. What's in here?
- It's a press conference.

154
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,086
So don't tell no jokes,
don't lift up nobody's dress, OK?

155
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,673
- What do I have to say?
- Nothin', if we're lucky. Come on.

156
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,550
John, you had a question.

157
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:31,013
Do you anticipate opposition
to the takeover of Omnibank?

158
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,642
Just a moment.
It isn't a takeover, it's a merger.

159
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:40,272
- But Omnibank has always opposed...
- We think that attitude's changing.

160
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,817
We've made a generous tender offer
for the Omnibank shares.

161
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,362
We're confident they'll accept it.

162
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,574
Troy, you look like you're gonna jump
outta that seat. You have a question?

163
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,534
For Mr Broderick.

164
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,331
Bud, you've played opposite just about
every great motion-picture actress.

165
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,418
- Yes, I have.
- Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser?

166
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,175
That depends. What part of the body
are you talking about?

167
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,302
Print that. I dare you.

168
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,682
Mr Steele, why were you 45 minutes late
to the press conference?

169
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,269
Ha... Well...

170
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,273
I'd like to apologise for that.

171
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:30,364
I was, uh... I was givin' mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to a bottle of tequila.

172
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,493
And we lost her, too.

173
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,414
Do you in fact
eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast?

174
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, ma'am, I eat
steak and eggs for breakfast.

175
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,379
- You were three-time...
- And Ranch Breakfast for lunch.

176
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,508
You were three-time
Worid Champion Cowboy...

177
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,427
Five.

178
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:57,391
Five-times Worid Champion Cowboy,
and now you're selling cereal.

179
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,852
How do you feel about that?

180
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:08,318
- Lady, I don't wanna tangle with you.
- Listen, we've got a time problem here.

181
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,363
You are all invited
by our chairman, Mr Hunt Sears...

182
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:16,201
...to a reception before the performance.
And enjoy yourselves, you hear?

183
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,871
- You got a rehearsal.
- What was that all about?

184
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,832
- I don't know. Come on.
- Rehearse what?

185
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:26,253
After you circle, you stop
on your mark, stage left...

186
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,840
...lean forward in the saddle,
face the audience, wave...

187
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,384
Where's the horse?

188
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,262
Bring in the damn horse.

189
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,852
Spot, please.

190
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,234
God, he's a beauty.

191
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,614
Tom, Sonny rides in circles three times,
applause, applause, applause...

192
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,701
...then stops on the mark.
Sonny, your first line is...

193
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:02,623
- What have you got him on?
- A little bute. And some penicillin.

194
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,632
This tendon, it ought
to be braced and bandaged.

195
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,801
- They think it don't look right.
- Uh, hello?

196
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,763
- What do you mean, they think...
- Sonny.

197
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,266
- After you stop, you say...
- Your horse is stoned.

198
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,311
How else are we gonna get him up here
with all these lights?

199
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,272
Excuse me, gentlemen!
We're trying to rehearse!

200
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,151
Sonny, your first line...

201
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:37,616
"Ranch Breakfast...
a champ's way to start the morning."

202
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,787
Then you look at the horse and you say
"Ain't that right, Risin' Star?"

203
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,706
"If you agree, don't say anything."

204
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:49,044
It's funny. It's funny. You try it.

205
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,512
"Ranch Breakfast,
a champ's way to start the morning."

206
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,473
Wonderful. But much, much bigger.

207
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,017
Much bigger. Louder.

208
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,896
"Ranch Bre..."

209
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,360
- There's more. There's more.
- I saw it.

210
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,704
That's the most discourteous thing
I ever saw in the theatre.

211
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:26,999
Sonny, this is Hunt Sears.
He ain't no flunky.

212
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,417
This it here?

213
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,752
You ain't in no shape
to see no Hunt Sears.

214
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,838
What I gotta do first? Jog?

215
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:38,343
Dual overhead camshafts, fully enclosed
drive shaft, dual disc brakes in front...

216
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:44,433
Each item will appear in several major
magazines during the month of July.

217
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,520
As an example of our confidence
in the success of these new fashions...

218
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:53,817
...Ampco will be sending these lovely
models on a one-month tour...

219
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,570
Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol.

220
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,196
Hey. How are you?

221
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,949
Well, then let's...

222
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,704
Carol's interested in commercials...

223
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,332
Hey, Sonny, I wanna get my son a horse.
What kind is best?

224
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,793
- How old is your kid?
- He's six years old.

225
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,879
Get him a short horse.

226
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:18,300
- Hey, Hallie Martin. We met in New York.
- Did we like each other?

227
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,803
That question about the merger -
who the hell was that guy?

228
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:26,516
<i>That was Cross, the Washington bureau
of the Times. He's connected to Treasury.</i>

229
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,977
- He shouldn't have been here.
- Spilt milk.

230
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:33,440
Sonny, here's a couple I'd
like you to meet. Mr and Mrs Phillips.

231
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,359
- Hi.
- Steve Phillips, the Million-Dollar Club.

232
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,529
Sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year.

233
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:43,450
- Well, the mean-question lady.
- I'm just curious.

234
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:48,121
- Uh, Steve Phillips, the...
- You know what curiosity did to the cat.

235
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:52,959
He sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year. Wholesale.

236
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:56,129
Are you kiddin' me? That's just fantastic.

237
00:20:56,254 --> 00:21:00,008
- We're very proud of it.
- I'll bet you are. And I am too. Damn.

238
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,928
- I just love that...
- This is Grace Phillips.

239
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,264
I know. We met too.
Everything's going around and around.

240
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:10,519
- Oh, that poster is beautiful.
- It's a great gimmick. Very effective.

241
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:15,941
Grace, why don't you stand in front of it
with Sonny, and Steve can take a picture.

242
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:20,153
Why not just take a picture of Grace in
front of that picture of me and the box...

243
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,240
...with a picture of me on the box,
holding a picture of me...

244
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,077
Then you got Grace
and a whole bunch of pictures of me.

245
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,415
Sonny, you know that TV show in Denver?
We've had to make changes in your copy.

246
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,793
I bet it's shorter.

247
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,880
- In a multimedia situation...
- Mr Sears?

248
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,968
Hello, Sonny. It's about time
we finally met, isn't it?

249
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,680
- Yes, sir, it's about time.
- Everybody here know Mr Steele?

250
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,641
Like our horse?
Couldn't have a better straight man.

251
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,477
- Can I have a word with you, sir?
- Perhaps later.

252
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,231
- Beautiful animal, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, he's an amazing animal.

253
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,901
But he don't belong
in a parking lot in Las Vegas.

254
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:04,739
I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most
natural place in the worid for any of us.

255
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,410
Well, sir, I don't think he's feelin' so good.

256
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,829
Let's give him a drink!

257
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,832
Rising Star represents
a substantial investment.

258
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,168
You can be sure
we've entrusted his care to experts.

259
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,880
Well, I don't think
them experts are so expert.

260
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:27,345
Mr Steele, would you please sign this
picture for me? For my daughter Tammy.

261
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,184
Look, why don't I make an appointment
with Mr Sears's secretary...

262
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,563
Why would you put that horse
on a stage with dancing girls?

263
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,274
<i>- Just a minute...
- I'm talkin' to him.</i>

264
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,487
It sells products, Sonny.

265
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:50,076
You mustn't apply logic to advertising.
It'll just confound you, believe me.

266
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,371
Well, it just don't feel right to me.
It seems wrong.

267
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:56,750
All them lights blinkin' and winkin',
and girls...

268
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,169
Sir, I used to rodeo.

269
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,715
- And I was good at it.
- That's irrelevant.

270
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,219
To who?

271
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:11,181
This is a conversation
we might have some other time.

272
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,223
Would it matter?

273
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:15,810
What matters is that you fulfil
the requirements of your contract.

274
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:20,023
Which don't include your passing
judgment on corporate policy.

275
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,693
Nothin' in that contract
about me ridin' toy horses.

276
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,237
You're not in rodeo any more.

277
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,740
Actually, you're more famous now,
aren't you?

278
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,702
Your face is on millions of boxes,
on billboards all over the country...

279
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:35,121
...people want your autograph...

280
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,416
What I'm talking about
is that you voluntarily accepted...

281
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,586
...a highly paid, relatively simple job...

282
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:46,549
...that more than a handful of cowboys
would give their right arm for.

283
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,886
You're right.

284
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,555
I don't want just to be right.

285
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,644
- You want me to like it?
- It would be a factor in our relationship.

286
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,397
Mr Sears, Joanna Camden
is waiting over by the earthmover.

287
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,776
- Why don't we have a picture session?
- Excuse us, please.

288
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,111
You bet.

289
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,032
- I'm sorry, sir.
- When this is over, get rid of him.

290
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,396
- Charlotta! Hey!
- Got a quarter?

291
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,482
No, don't... don't say it.
I bet that cheque's in the mail.

292
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:47,944
Wendell handles all that, babe,
you know that. Come talk to me.

293
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,738
<i>How is old Wendell
who can't find a stamp?</i>

294
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:56,327
Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels,
please. Tall glass.

295
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:02,250
- The lady will take a Rob Roy.
- Orangeade. I quit.

296
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:06,421
What... What's the matter?
You're not born-again, are you?

297
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,883
Maybe I am.
I got me a record contract now.

298
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,886
<i>All on my own too.
You be sure and tell Wendell Hixson that.</i>

299
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,099
You sure are tough on Wendell. Not that
I blame you, cheques bein' late an' all.

300
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:22,145
I don't wanna talk about the cheques.
You know what I wanna talk about.

301
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,480
I want you to sign these papers.

302
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,359
You don't think I saw you tryin'
to slip out? I left three messages.

303
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,988
Well, now wait a minute.
I didn't get no messages.

304
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,827
Sonny, that judge told you
to sign the papers.

305
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:44,167
- Don't you wanna be divorced for real?
- Yes, I do. I just... Well, I've been busy.

306
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,129
Busy?! Doin' what? Makin' up excuses?

307
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,255
Excuses?

308
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,551
You got somebody now who sits up
all night cos you lost your keys?

309
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:55,386
Or you got a flat tyre?

310
00:25:55,511 --> 00:26:00,391
Comin' home at 6am, expectin' me
to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys.

311
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:04,687
And cowgirls who didn't bother to look
like they hadn't been in your back seat!

312
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:07,648
Charlotta, yoo-hoo,
you got a mean memory.

313
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,193
- Just a couple of parties...
- A couple?!

314
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,029
That light-up suit
musta given you shock treatment!

315
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>I'm talkin' a lot of parties,
and a lot of back seats!</i>

316
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,701
But for back seats, we'd never have met.

317
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,079
And I'll bet you're still doin' it.

318
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,748
Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out.

319
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,668
You're just walkin' around
to save funeral expenses.

320
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,797
You smile, babe. You get my insurance.

321
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,343
Do you know what your skeleton looks like
in them x-ray pictures? A junkyard.

322
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,513
You couldn't get through
a metal detector stark naked.

323
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,640
Give me the papers.

324
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,141
Huh?

325
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,519
Give me the papers.

326
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,231
- For real?
- Give me them.

327
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,579
You look like hell.

328
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,791
Well, you look great.

329
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,838
Hey. Would you come up to my room?

330
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:16,092
I can't. You just know what'd happen.

331
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,094
Yeah.

332
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,805
Besides, I got somebody
who really likes me now.

333
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,266
Well, it's not hard to do.

334
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,353
- Who's the lucky fella?
- Billy-Roy Fix.

335
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,023
Billy-Roy Fix?

336
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,192
Is that right?

337
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,154
I guess there's just somethin'
about us Western stars.

338
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,410
<i>-  Mr Sonny Steele, please report...
- Oop, that's me. I'm late.</i>

339
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,332
Goodbye, darlin'.

340
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,421
Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh?

341
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,996
Well, Mr Steele.

342
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,837
After this number,
the motorcycle daredevils - God save us.

343
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:19,381
And then you and the horse.

344
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:43,072
Now, listen. You don't start those things
until I give you the cue, yes?

345
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,593
Not now.

346
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:07,179
Not now! Not now!

347
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,081
Open the curtain.

348
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:12,119
Forget the routine! Go right to the finale!

349
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:15,789
That was very effective.
This is no criticism, you understand...

350
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:18,667
...but it's too dangerous
to use that horse on a ramp.

351
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:20,711
He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp!

352
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:25,758
He wasn't even supposed to be out there
yet! He's ruined the whole concept!

353
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:38,187
<i># I gotta run to keep from hidin'</i>

354
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:43,067
<i># And I'm bound to keep on ridin'</i>

355
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:49,031
<i># And I got one more silver dollar</i>

356
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:51,200
<i># And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me</i>

357
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:57,164
<i># No, I ain't gonna let 'em catch
the midnight rider</i>

358
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,830
- What did he say?
- He was rude. He was very rude!

359
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:41,333
- And he wasn't concentrating.
- He must've said something to you.

360
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,337
Well, he was askin' about
the horse's tendon, and the drugs.

361
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,133
Drugs? What drugs?

362
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,928
- Well, the tranquillisers and...
- That's done all the time.

363
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,430
They tranquillise the animal
to keep it calm.

364
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,684
And the Butazolidin
they use for the... tendon.

365
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,562
Mutual Indemnity and the police.
Which do you want?

366
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:04,940
- Neither. I wanna keep this quiet.
- You may as well know the rest.

367
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:10,154
Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed
we've used steroids to muscle him up.

368
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,906
Well, are they dangerous?

369
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:15,993
Well, they make the horse sterile.

370
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:20,664
Well, temporarily. I mean, it's just
a side effect. It's not a permanent thing.

371
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:23,292
Do we put that on the box top,
"Temporary"?

372
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:28,046
- It goes away in, what, how many hours?
- Gentlemen, would you excuse us?

373
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:31,592
- There are drinks upstairs.
- Ah, the worid of illusion.

374
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,262
Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out.

375
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,431
Jesus...

376
00:33:39,975 --> 00:33:44,021
We're not talking about a horse,
we're talking about a $300 million merger.

377
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:46,273
Omnibank will make a feast out of this.

378
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,902
If Steele talks to anyone before
he's caught, we have no merger.

379
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,404
Ampco and the horse are the same thing.

380
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:56,033
If we've mismanaged the horse,
we've mismanaged the corporation.

381
00:33:56,158 --> 00:34:00,245
- Couldn't he have called the SPCA?
- What'll we say to the reporters?

382
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,290
- Tell 'em to go to bed.
- It's a little late for that.

383
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,876
And get those morons out of here.

384
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:09,379
- Come on, Bob.
- One drunken cowboy!

385
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,528
We have been advised
by the attorney general...

386
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,324
...that the theft of Rising Star
is grand larceny, a felony.

387
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:42,788
Should this prove to be a deliberate act,
a warrant will be issued for Mr Steele.

388
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:47,000
At this time, however, our primary concern
is the welfare of our horse.

389
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,462
What did he say to Sears?
They were really goin' at each other.

390
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,631
Hallie, give me a break, will ya?

391
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:56,510
<i>- Ransom. What about ransom?
- The man's not that crazy.</i>

392
00:34:56,635 --> 00:35:00,972
He's been tossed on his head enough
times. Thought about brain damage?

393
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:05,519
The cowboy is a little hot-tempered.
He's emotionally disturbed, that's all.

394
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:10,399
Come on, Fitz. He's made a mistake
and he'll bring it back when he cools out?

395
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:13,235
- Oh, come on.
- Look, let me alone, will ya?

396
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,153
I don't know any answers.

397
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,198
I don't know from brain damage,
from cooling out...

398
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:22,369
<i>Look, why don't you go have a sauna?
Give me some good news, for chrissake!</i>

399
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:24,704
"Cool... out."

400
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:37,092
<i>...these days.</i>

401
00:35:37,217 --> 00:35:40,429
<i>-  Why'd she quit him?
-  Who knows?</i>

402
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:47,561
<i>Sonny was married in Gus's living room.
And when that woman quit him,...</i>

403
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:50,105
<i>...well, you know
where Sonny came to cool out.</i>

404
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,316
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old
and strange these da...</i>

405
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:58,822
<i>...well, you know
where Sonny came to cool out.</i>

406
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:01,616
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old
and strange these days.</i>

407
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:27,142
Seen Wendell?

408
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:31,605
No. I haven't seen nobody. They're just
runnin' round like crazy people today.

409
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,026
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit.

410
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:41,448
Hey, tell me somethin'. Somethin'
personal. Were you surprised he did it?

411
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,617
Who, Sonny?

412
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:47,454
Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. Just some
surprises are bigger than others.

413
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,999
Like he gave me this ring one day,
just like that.

414
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:53,627
Had old Wendell's teeth
fixed for him, too.

415
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:56,630
- What's your last name?
- Smitley.

416
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,424
Say, you know something?
We got a mutual friend.

417
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:03,053
- Oh, we do? Well, who do we know?
- Gus Atwater.

418
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,015
I know Gus. Do you know Gus?
Where do you know Gus from?

419
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,228
Oh, sure. Wait, are we talkin' about
the same Gus, from, uh, Tuba City?

420
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:17,317
No, not Tuba City. No, the Gus I mean
is from Mesquite, about 30 miles up here.

421
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:18,360
Mesquite.

422
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,670
You wanna drive?

423
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,158
Morning.

424
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:09,327
Hello.

425
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:14,999
- You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves?
- You must be a Capricorn.

426
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,215
- You got any eucalyptus leaves?
- Just tea bags.

427
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,385
- Well, I need some of them tea bags.
- How many would you like?

428
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,053
Oh, five or six dozen.

429
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:29,389
- Bags?
- Boxes.

430
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:35,895
Come on, boy. Come on, son.

431
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:41,568
Just a couple more times of doin' this
and you'll be breathin' just fine.

432
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:43,778
<i>If I live.</i>

433
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:10,430
- Mr Atwater?
- # Golden hills

434
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:12,765
# Round her head

435
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:17,061
# Glimmer golden hills

436
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,107
Mr Atwater?

437
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:23,276
You wounded?

438
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:26,863
- No, I'm looking for a friend of ours.
- He ain't here.

439
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,741
- But he was.
- Yep.

440
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:33,161
From about this high.

441
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:38,625
- Was he here today?
- Here today, gone tomorrow.

442
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,044
Like a flutterin' bird.

443
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:45,924
- Hey, hey, who are you?
- I work for television.

444
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:49,344
- You know television?
- Yeah. I got one.

445
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:53,348
Works sometimes. Comes a-flashin'.

446
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:56,851
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

447
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:01,522
- Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's.
- Leroy! Oh-ho!

448
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:05,276
Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell.

449
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:08,947
They told me you'd know
where to find him.

450
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:14,035
How else would I know
where you were? Huh?

451
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:19,082
We're real worried about him.

452
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,584
I gotta find him. I have to talk to him.

453
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:25,588
I can't hurt him.

454
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:29,300
He came here. Covered with a mist.

455
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:33,763
You know? Like floats atop a river?

456
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:38,768
And... and it grows into a cloud...

457
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:43,022
...and it shuts away the sun...

458
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,068
Where'd he go, Gus?

459
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:54,450
- No, please!
- What?! How did you find me?

460
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:57,370
- What are you doing?
- You're hurting me! Stop it!

461
00:40:57,495 --> 00:40:58,997
- Who's with you?
- I'm alone.

462
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:00,998
- How did you find me?
- I swear to God...

463
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:03,543
- How did you get here?
- I drove myself.

464
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:05,670
How? How did you find me?

465
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:08,715
Gus.

466
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:12,051
Gus Atwater.

467
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:14,220
Gus?

468
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:20,435
Gus.

469
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,020
Can I... can I get up now?

470
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:25,940
Please?

471
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:28,443
How did you know to get to Gus?

472
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:33,906
I... interviewed your friends.

473
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:37,118
Who?

474
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:40,204
Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd...

475
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:45,126
Wait a minute, you hit my face,
you son of bitch!

476
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:48,004
I'm not gonna stay here.

477
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:55,595
What did you take the horse for?

478
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:57,972
You're crazy.

479
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:03,394
- Does anybody else know about Gus?
- No. No. And nobody knows anything...

480
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,566
<i>Oh, I'm crazy? You go off with somebody
else's $12 million horse, and I'm crazy?!</i>

481
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,568
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't you hit me!

482
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:12,737
- Did you scare that old man?
- No.

483
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:15,698
Does anybody else know you're here?

484
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:21,162
No. Nobody knows anything. I don't have
any reason to tell anybody anything.

485
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:23,789
Go away. Go home.

486
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:29,670
<i>Well, what are you gonna do with him?</i>

487
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:37,470
Look, just tell me why you took the horse.
You can't race him. You can't sell him.

488
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:41,307
And you're not gonna start
your own cereal company.

489
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:45,561
<i>I mean, what the hell do you want?</i>

490
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:51,734
Oh, can't you just answer one question?

491
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,864
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I don't usually get hit doing this, but...

492
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:59,617
What do you expect,
sneakin' up like some cat?

493
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:02,578
I tried to call, but your line was busy.

494
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:11,545
Do you know how worried your friends are
about you? Wendell and Leroy?

495
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:16,133
Isn't there something I can tell them?

496
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:22,473
What is this place?
Does this have special meaning to you?

497
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:25,393
You want information, go to the library.

498
00:43:26,102 --> 00:43:29,397
I know what you want. It ain't answers.

499
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:33,526
You just want a story. Any story.
Why don't you make one up?

500
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:37,655
That's what you all do anyway.
You don't need me to tell you no story.

501
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,701
You ask me why I'm 45 minutes late.
You're not interested in why I'm late.

502
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:46,038
Just in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat
Ranch Breakfast?" Who the hell cares?

503
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:48,708
Honest to hell, you people
are all the same.

504
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:51,210
There's folks in Africa,
or some damn place...

505
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:53,879
...you try to take a picture of them,
they'll kill ya.

506
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:57,883
They figure you're takin' somethin' from
them, and you just got so much stuff...

507
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:00,636
...and if other people take it all
you got nothin' left.

508
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:03,389
Well, I don't wanna be no story.

509
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:09,729
- I've just retired from public life.
- Boy, have you got that wrong.

510
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:13,733
You rode down the Las Vegas Strip
with somebody else's $12 million horse.

511
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:17,319
Did you think we wouldn't notice?
You're a story all right.

512
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:19,739
But not yours.

513
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:27,204
I'm nobody's story but my own now.

514
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:33,085
But... Wait, wait a minute...
Where are you going?

515
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:37,298
Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I?

516
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:42,511
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Was it something I said?

517
00:44:43,053 --> 00:44:45,639
Look, can't you just do
a working girl a favour?

518
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:49,310
I'm just trying to earn an honest buck,
tell an honest tale.

519
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:52,480
I don't want to make up
a story about you.

520
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:54,982
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

521
00:44:55,107 --> 00:44:58,944
Everybody's wondering where you're going,
why you did it.

522
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:02,698
The great American cowboy
and the worid-champion horse...

523
00:45:02,823 --> 00:45:04,241
...riding into the sunset...

524
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:08,329
Boy, are you full of shit.
With all due respect, ma'am.

525
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:11,874
- And you're standin' in poison sumac.
- Oh!

526
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,545
Come on, son. Come on, boy.

527
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:23,260
If you think you're gettin' away from me
you're not, cos I'm gonna follow you.

528
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:28,265
I'm gonna follow you till you tell me
what you're gonna do with the horse.

529
00:45:32,144 --> 00:45:34,396
What are you doing?

530
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:37,316
Oh, my God!

531
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:41,362
Now it shouldn't take you more
than about 15 minutes to change that.

532
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:45,449
Goddamn you! You're nuts! I'm gonna call
the cops. I got your license plate.

533
00:45:45,574 --> 00:45:46,909
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

534
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:51,580
No, you won't. I know what you'll do.
You'll milk this story for all it's worth.

535
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:56,752
You don't want me to be captured.
A captured horse thief ain't no story.

536
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:04,885
It was from this hotel that Rising Star,
greatest money-winner in racing history...

537
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,806
...and corporate symbol for one
of the worid's largest conglomerates...

538
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,016
...was taken late Friday night.

539
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:15,521
Yesterday I uncovered information
which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele.

540
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:19,191
<i> Now to raise
the old Stars and Stripes.</i>

541
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:21,860
<i>Where's that blasted flagpole?</i>

542
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:24,697
<i>Good gracious! A bird's nest!</i>

543
00:46:25,197 --> 00:46:29,576
<i>How clumsy of me. I hope
I didn't step on your eggs, birdie.</i>

544
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:33,122
You got any shoelaces?

545
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:35,958
- What?
- Shoelaces?

546
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:41,505
Anita, get rid of that stuff.
Over here by the cash register.

547
00:46:42,464 --> 00:46:45,467
<i>By the dim glow of a shrouded campfire...</i>

548
00:46:45,592 --> 00:46:49,763
<i>...I saw Rising Star,
and I encountered Sonny Steele himself.</i>

549
00:46:49,888 --> 00:46:51,056
- What?
- What?

550
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:53,392
<i>- We talked for many hours.
- What?!</i>

551
00:46:53,517 --> 00:46:58,147
<i>As a result of our wide-ranging
conversation, I formed these impressions:</i>

552
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:03,694
<i>Mr Steele, in my opinion,
did not take the horse for monetary gain...</i>

553
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,363
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

554
00:47:07,114 --> 00:47:09,366
- Where was he?
- I forgot.

555
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:13,162
- How were you able to find him?
- That's my job.

556
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:15,581
- What did he tell you, Hallie?
- Nothing.

557
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:20,794
Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could
put you right in the middle of the story.

558
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,090
We could guarantee
that you get first crack at everything.

559
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:28,052
I've already had first crack at everything.

560
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:30,554
Suppose we made it exclusive?

561
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,516
How about if we gave you
exclusive footage on the capture?

562
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:37,019
Oh, when are you planning that?

563
00:47:37,144 --> 00:47:42,191
Wanna tell me about that confrontation
with Steele at the reception, Mr Sears?

564
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:46,653
- Miss Martin, we could take you to court.
- You could try.

565
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:51,408
Aiding a felon during the commission of
a felonious act, concealment of a felony...

566
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:53,994
"Misprision of felony", the law calls it.

567
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,373
You're not the law. If Ampco wants to take
on the First Amendment, be my guest.

568
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:01,418
That oughta sell
a whole lot of breakfast cereal.

569
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:05,214
I'll be around,
if you wanna handcuff me later.

570
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:14,640
<i>- We could take her to court.
- Have her locked up.</i>

571
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:17,810
And gain what? The last thing
we need is a female martyr.

572
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:21,021
At least he didn't say anything
about mistreating the horse.

573
00:48:21,146 --> 00:48:23,857
- Do we know that?
- I think she'd have said something.

574
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:27,236
You "think". It's a chance
we can't afford to take.

575
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:30,656
Do we have a choice?

576
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:35,327
We could make sure that if he speaks
to anyone he won't be believed.

577
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,372
Can you get to the media
by the 11 o'clock news?

578
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:52,135
How the hell did she find him,
we ain't even heard from him?

579
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:55,013
We sent her over there,
that's how she found him.

580
00:48:55,138 --> 00:49:00,143
Well, she buddied up to me. She tried
to buy me drinks, said she liked my ring...

581
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:03,689
She liked your ring, she liked
my watch, I liked her eyes...

582
00:49:03,814 --> 00:49:08,151
That's how those people are. They tell
you they're your friend, and they use you.

583
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:10,195
Well, what are we gonna do?

584
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,156
I don't know about you.
I'm gonna get a bottle of tequila...

585
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:18,203
...one of those keno girls that can suck the
chrome off a trailer hitch, and kick back.

586
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:23,166
<i>10.59 here at KLSG in St George,
and here's Harvey Del Rio...</i>

587
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:27,879
If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep
standin', boy, we'd have this licked.

588
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:33,635
<i>In Las Vegas, investigators still have no
leads to the whereabouts of Rising Star,...</i>

589
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,014
<i>...whose ab duction by Sonny Steele
triggered a massive search.</i>

590
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:40,559
<i>Ampco officials are expressing alarm
over the welfare of the horse.</i>

591
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:44,730
<i>According to one, Steele has a long history
of alcoholism and drug abuse.</i>

592
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:48,859
<i>He's appeared in public in an intoxicated
state on several occasions,...</i>

593
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:51,361
<i>...and has been abusive
to press and public.</i>

594
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:54,823
<i>They believe if the horse is to survive,
time is of the essence.</i>

595
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:16,636
Excuse me, Miss Martin?
I'm Charlotta Steele.

596
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:21,349
- I was married to Sonny.
- Yes, I know.

597
00:50:21,475 --> 00:50:25,312
I don't mean to bother you, but
I was just wonderin' if he was all right.

598
00:50:25,437 --> 00:50:28,523
- He isn't hurt?
- No.

599
00:50:29,816 --> 00:50:35,655
- Are you gonna be seein' him again?
- Well, we haven't made any plans. Why?

600
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:38,366
Just wonderin'.

601
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,454
- Why do you think he did it?
- I don't know.

602
00:50:44,581 --> 00:50:50,420
He gets ornery. Guess it takes him a long
time to admit he's got a horn in his gut.

603
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:54,257
<i>What is the horn in his gut, Mrs Steele?</i>

604
00:50:56,218 --> 00:51:00,055
All's I know is he musta had a good
reason, or he woulda been back by now.

605
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,518
He's no thief by nature.
I mean, it takes your breath!

606
00:51:08,063 --> 00:51:11,066
You know, they only said
those bad things about him.

607
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:15,362
They didn't say what's decent. Even
though it is hard to find it sometimes.

608
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:17,531
How'd you meet Sonny?

609
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:28,250
Hallie Martin, please.

610
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:40,178
<i>- What?
- You alone?</i>

611
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:43,765
- Who is this?
- Are you alone?

612
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:47,269
OK, fella, say your dirties. Get it over with.

613
00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:50,730
It's time for another
wide-rangin' conversation.

614
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:55,861
<i>- Hello?
- Is it you?</i>

615
00:51:55,986 --> 00:51:58,655
Right from the dim glow
of the shrouded campfire.

616
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,781
<i>You maniac!</i>

617
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:02,200
I broke three nails changing that tyre.

618
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,203
- You want a story?
- Yes.

619
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:11,001
- Can you leave without anybody knowin'?
- If I can't, I won't come.

620
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:16,131
- Who saw him?
- Some little shopkeeper in Utah.

621
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:19,843
Near St George, about five last night.
He must've gotten a vehicle.

622
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:25,348
So if he stopped for the night he should
be within 150 miles of St George.

623
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:28,184
- Who knows this?
- The local police are taken care of.

624
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,645
- The press?
- No, not yet, not yet.

625
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,274
- We'll take care of it.
- Can we cover the surrounding towns?

626
00:52:34,399 --> 00:52:37,652
Taking care of it now. We'll concentrate
on Liberty and Cedarville.

627
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:42,115
You and Toland take the jet.
You can organise this from St George.

628
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,201
- If he stopped for the night.
- He must sleep sometimes.

629
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:47,829
He crossed the state line.
The FBI will want in.

630
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:51,708
- Can you keep 'em out?
- They already know he's been spotted.

631
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:57,047
Then get to him first. Tell him we won't
prosecute. Do whatever you have to do.

632
00:52:57,172 --> 00:52:59,549
Just don't let him start up
about the horse.

633
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,682
I'm here!

634
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:13,355
Hey, I'm here!

635
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,774
I'm alone. No troops.

636
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:25,116
Come on. Come on.

637
00:53:32,499 --> 00:53:34,751
Oh... Oh, God!

638
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:37,170
I think I've broken my leg.

639
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,883
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

640
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:02,153
Here. Get your camera ready.

641
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,241
Uh...

642
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:09,828
Listen, would you mind standing
over here with that background?

643
00:54:09,953 --> 00:54:12,747
No, this is all right. Right here.

644
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:15,625
But I think it'd be more dramatic
in front of...

645
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:20,213
Tell 'em it was dramatic.
You got a colourful imagination.

646
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:27,137
Listen, I've been driving all night,
and I'm not used to being talked to like...

647
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:29,764
I'm not used to being called a horse thief.

648
00:54:29,889 --> 00:54:33,351
<i>What do you call
a man who steals horses?</i>

649
00:54:34,352 --> 00:54:37,188
Have you ever seen this horse race?

650
00:54:38,523 --> 00:54:41,359
Have you ever seen... I've seen him run.

651
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:47,866
I saw him stumble and fall back,
and lose his stride, and pick himself up.

652
00:54:47,991 --> 00:54:51,119
<i>I saw him stretch out
when he had nothin' left to give...</i>

653
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:54,163
...but he found it... somewhere.

654
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,457
And he won.

655
00:54:56,583 --> 00:55:00,461
Lady, that horse is a champion.
He's got a heart the size of a locomotive.

656
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:05,633
He's got more heart, and more drive,
and more... soul...

657
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:09,304
...than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.

658
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:12,599
Trot him round with dancing girls,
ta-da-da-ta-ta!

659
00:55:12,724 --> 00:55:17,729
They'd have him wearin' short pants and
smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!

660
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:23,067
They got him tanked up on tranquillisers
and bute, stickin' him full of needles...

661
00:55:23,192 --> 00:55:26,946
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up,
he's shot full of steroids...

662
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:30,158
And it's just for looks.
Makes the horse sterile!

663
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:32,785
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...

664
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:38,708
Even if they wanted to breed him, pass on
some of them fine qualities, they couldn't.

665
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:42,170
To say nothin' of what
the horse hisself is missin'.

666
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:43,713
So...

667
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:47,425
...so I took him.

668
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:52,221
Come on, let's go. Get this...

669
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:59,562
Let's crank up this little hummer
and I'll... give ya a speech. Or try.

670
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:07,862
All right?

671
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,784
Any time you're... Can you see me?
Can you see the horse?

672
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:15,787
Yeah. Keep going. I can see everything.

673
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:21,542
Uh, this here is Sonny Steele...

674
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:25,338
...and, uh, his name is Risin' Star.

675
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:28,841
And he's one of the best.

676
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:36,140
He's one of the greatest animals
in the... in the history of... animals.

677
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:04,460
Maybe they bought him.
Maybe they own him.

678
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:08,923
But there's some rights you can't buy.
Even from an animal.

679
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:16,472
Now, this horse earned a better life.
I'm gonna try and see that he gets it.

680
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:27,859
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll do it.

681
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:32,405
Appreciate your comin'.
You got stamina.

682
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:36,659
- It's a family trait.
- You'll forgive me for not entertainin'.

683
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:39,579
I gotta tend this horse
and get him movin'.

684
00:57:39,704 --> 00:57:42,748
Listen, can I... can I come with you?

685
00:57:42,874 --> 00:57:44,125
No!

686
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:46,586
Why? I wouldn't be any...

687
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:48,337
- Trouble?
- No.

688
00:57:51,716 --> 00:57:55,553
- Well, here, let me give you my card.
- Your what?

689
00:57:55,678 --> 00:58:01,392
Card. Sometimes you think of something
you forgot to say, or... wish you'd said.

690
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:04,478
<i>Steele, what are you gonna do with him?</i>

691
00:58:04,604 --> 00:58:07,773
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me anything.

692
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:10,026
Enough.

693
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:13,404
- Why does it have to be a big secret?
- So they can't stop me.

694
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:15,740
From doing what?

695
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,576
I'm gonna turn him loose.

696
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,369
What?! Rising Star?

697
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:24,290
I'm gonna get him back
to where he was, what he was.

698
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:28,753
It's in his blood. He knows what to do.
He's just half forgot, is all.

699
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:31,130
But he's a thoroughbred racehorse!

700
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:34,759
Maybe it isn't gonna work, lady.
Maybe he ain't gonna make it...

701
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:39,347
...but at least he's gonna try. He's gonna
have his own shot at it, that's all.

702
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:43,184
- Where?
- Where? Have a safe trip back, miss.

703
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:45,895
Miss, my ass!
Where will you do it? Do you know?

704
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,272
- I know.
- Who else knows?

705
00:58:48,397 --> 00:58:51,817
I don't know. Maybe he does.
Why don't you interview him?

706
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:54,612
You know you're gonna
screw up your whole life?

707
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:57,782
<i>Goddamnit, I'm trying to unscrew it, lady!</i>

708
00:58:57,907 --> 00:59:02,578
- Wendell says you forgot your best part.
- Wendell? Oh, he's a good man, Wendell.

709
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:04,330
- Is it true?
- Nope.

710
00:59:04,455 --> 00:59:09,085
- Charlotta says you screw up...
- Charlotta? You got her in on this too?

711
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,253
Don't tell me.

712
00:59:11,754 --> 00:59:14,340
She says you take her breath away.

713
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:20,471
Yeah, well, that's not hard to do.
She's all breath anyway.

714
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:25,059
She's, uh, she's pretty.

715
00:59:25,184 --> 00:59:27,645
Yes, she is pretty.

716
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:32,191
She said that when you two
first met you... Oh...

717
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:35,236
Wait, that canyon
where you went on your honeymoon...

718
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:37,738
- Damn that woman.
- With wild mustangs.

719
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:40,199
Goddamn that woman!

720
00:59:40,408 --> 00:59:43,702
- Rim Rock. Rim Rock!
- That's why I left her.

721
00:59:43,828 --> 00:59:47,581
That's exactly why I left her,
her and her big m... Or she left me.

722
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:50,668
Anyway, I'm not goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon.

723
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:55,923
I have an idea. Let's go into town,
have a cup of coffee, and talk about it.

724
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:58,300
My treat.

725
01:00:00,636 --> 01:00:02,430
- Huh?
- I'm not gonna be... No.

726
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:07,768
I'm not gonna be passin' a...
Now where'd I put that son of a bitch?

727
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:12,148
Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin'
a mailbox, so if you'd be...

728
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:15,776
- It's got a stamp on it.
- Yeah, first one I pass.

729
01:00:18,446 --> 01:00:20,489
Well...

730
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:24,326
What do I do? Just take this road
back to the broken tree?

731
01:00:24,452 --> 01:00:28,664
Yeah. Same way you came.
Only backwards.

732
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:31,542
- Don't lose my card.
- Oh, no, it's... Goodbye.

733
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:34,420
OK, good luck, wherever you're going.

734
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:58,569
Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures.

735
01:00:58,694 --> 01:01:02,364
And wait till you hear the talk.
People are gonna eat him up!

736
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:06,285
Tell me an affiliate between here and
Vegas. I wanna get this on the cable.

737
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,163
<i>Hold your horses...
Hear that about horses?</i>

738
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:13,125
Les, I am trying to convey a sense
of urgency. I want this on the air today.

739
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,046
<i>OK. KLSG-TV in St George, Utah.
Looks like about 60 miles.</i>

740
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:19,340
OK, now pay attention. This is crucial.

741
01:01:19,465 --> 01:01:23,594
I need a camera crew to meet me at a
place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah.

742
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:27,014
<i>- Try the Automobile Club or something.
- When do you need 'em?</i>

743
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:31,810
They should leave right now, cos I don't
know when I'll get there or he'll get there.

744
01:01:31,936 --> 01:01:34,021
And they should be prepared to camp out.

745
01:01:34,146 --> 01:01:37,149
I have a feeling this place
does not have a Hilton Hotel.

746
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:41,278
<i>I mean, this is a place
horses like, Les, and...</i>

747
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:47,910
Les, when Steele gets there,
he's gonna turn Rising Star loose.

748
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:49,119
<i>What?!</i>

749
01:01:49,244 --> 01:01:53,582
$12 million worth of thoroughbred
racehorse, loose in horse heaven.

750
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:55,376
Think you got a story?

751
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:59,088
<i>Stick with the lunatic, Hallie.
Tape everything. This is gold!</i>

752
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:02,883
<i>- He doesn't want me around.
- That never stopped you before.</i>

753
01:02:03,008 --> 01:02:05,386
<i>Just find some way to talk to the guy.</i>

754
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:10,099
Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew
and I'll talk to you later.

755
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:34,957
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody rob a bank?

756
01:02:35,082 --> 01:02:40,462
I don't know for sure. I think somebody
may have spotted that cereal cowboy.

757
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:50,973
Hello?

758
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:54,601
Hi. Listen, are you, uh...
are you going to St George?

759
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:56,645
'Less they moved the road.

760
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:13,454
- You're wearin' out your welcome, lady.
- There's a cop convention back there.

761
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:15,497
- What?
- I saw two patrol cars...

762
01:03:15,622 --> 01:03:18,667
...two motorcycle cops,
a county marshal and a sheriff.

763
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:23,172
- You said nobody'd follow you.
- They didn't. An expert got me out.

764
01:03:23,297 --> 01:03:25,299
Expert, huh?

765
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:36,018
Hey.

766
01:03:38,145 --> 01:03:41,482
- Wait a minute.
- Why? You wanna film the capture?

767
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:43,567
I am in as much trouble as you are.

768
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:47,738
If I go back I'll have to tell them
everything I know. And I mean everything.

769
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:51,950
If I don't, I'll go to jail.
It's called misprision of felony.

770
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,578
You go ahead and tell 'em.
I'll be long gone.

771
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:59,166
I can't. Don't you understand? I can't
divulge sources and expect anybody...

772
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,585
"Divulge sources"...? What are you doin'?

773
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,712
- Besides...
- Wait a minute...

774
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:06,381
Hey! Hold it!
What do you think you're doin'?

775
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:09,218
I'd have to tell them about Gus.

776
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:11,386
I would.

777
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:35,244
Ohh! God!

778
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:12,990
What are we gonna do?

779
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:15,200
Get on the floor.

780
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:18,036
- What?
- Do it. Get on the floor.

781
01:05:22,457 --> 01:05:25,127
- Easy, boy.
- What are we doing?

782
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:28,797
You stay right there. When I go
out the back, you count to 60.

783
01:05:28,922 --> 01:05:31,633
- Out the back...?
- Then drive the hell outta here.

784
01:05:31,758 --> 01:05:34,803
- The cops'll chase me.
- You're crazy!

785
01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:38,140
Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls.

786
01:05:38,265 --> 01:05:41,476
There's a lake there
at the bottom of some dry red cliffs.

787
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:44,604
- Well, where is Cisco Falls?
- Find it. You found me.

788
01:05:45,439 --> 01:05:48,984
But, no, listen... You can't...
You can't make it out there.

789
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:52,237
- There's at least dozen cops!
- That'll be up to him.

790
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:56,783
OK now, junkie, no excuses. Tendon's
gone down, you ain't wheezin' any more...

791
01:05:56,908 --> 01:05:59,786
...and, goddamn, I've seen you run.
Let's go.

792
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:02,164
No, wait! You can't...

793
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:16,970
That's him!

794
01:07:31,878 --> 01:07:34,798
...28, 29, 30...

795
01:08:07,038 --> 01:08:08,790
...58, 59, 60.

796
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:34,858
He's in Bundy's Field.

797
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:37,694
<i>- We can't follow him.
- Ten-four.</i>

798
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:52,709
He's headin' for the dam.

799
01:09:22,113 --> 01:09:24,616
Come on, come on! Do it! Do it!

800
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:31,039
Go! Go!

801
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:53,853
Come on! Come on! Go!

802
01:09:56,898 --> 01:09:59,275
All the way! Go! Go!

803
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:20,547
For chrissake, look out!

804
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,658
Oh, jeez!

805
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:01,629
<i>- How did he get away?
- On a horse.</i>

806
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:03,589
<i>On a horse. Find him.</i>

807
01:11:03,715 --> 01:11:06,050
Bring him back here.

808
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:10,388
Use the FBI. Use the state police.
Use helicopters.

809
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:12,724
Put out a reward - a large one.

810
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:16,269
Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines.
Where is he, Utah?

811
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:20,815
Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Have them sing him in. But get him!

812
01:11:25,028 --> 01:11:27,071
Hello?

813
01:11:27,864 --> 01:11:29,907
Hello?

814
01:11:30,867 --> 01:11:33,745
Oh, you made it! You made it!

815
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:38,541
Hey. There's some witch hazel
in the cabinet over the sink...

816
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:41,627
...and there's an old T-shirt by the bunk.

817
01:12:00,646 --> 01:12:03,107
I owe you one, buddy.

818
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:07,195
Is he all right?

819
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,946
Easy.

820
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:12,366
They didn't chase me. You were right.

821
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:15,787
You should've seen yourself.
You were great.

822
01:12:17,038 --> 01:12:19,081
You were.

823
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:29,634
Were you surprised that I got here?

824
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:31,385
No.

825
01:12:32,136 --> 01:12:36,724
It was on the road map. I didn't even
need to ask anybody or anything.

826
01:12:38,518 --> 01:12:40,269
Easy, boy.

827
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,941
It's gonna be getting dark soon.

828
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,611
How long does it take
to drive to Rim Rock Canyon?

829
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:51,948
Few days. Only we ain't drivin'.

830
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:53,282
What?

831
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:57,328
Cops'll be lookin' everywhere
for that camper. We'll have to leave it.

832
01:12:57,829 --> 01:13:00,289
- And do what?
- Walk.

833
01:13:01,415 --> 01:13:04,835
<i> I've seen him run.
I saw him stumble and fall back,...</i>

834
01:13:04,961 --> 01:13:07,463
<i>...lose his stride, and pick himself up.
- You bet!</i>

835
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:11,592
<i>He had nothin' left to give,
but he found it... somewhere.</i>

836
01:13:11,717 --> 01:13:17,056
<i>...and more drive, and more... soul
than most people you'll ever know.</i>

837
01:13:17,181 --> 01:13:19,100
<i>And they hang lights on him.</i>

838
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:22,436
<i>Trot him round with dancing girls,
ta-da-da-ta-ta!</i>

839
01:13:22,562 --> 01:13:26,941
<i>They'd have him wearin' short pants and
smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!</i>

840
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:30,570
<i>...stickin' him full of needles...
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up.</i>

841
01:13:30,695 --> 01:13:34,156
<i>He's shot full of steroids...
And it's just for looks. Makes him sterile!</i>

842
01:13:34,282 --> 01:13:36,659
<i>So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...</i>

843
01:13:36,784 --> 01:13:40,037
<i>Even if they wanted to pass on
them fine qualities, they couldn't.</i>

844
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:44,875
I could tape a bit along the way.
Nothing that'll give away where we are.

845
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:49,255
And maybe I could find someone that
could take it to the network, like today.

846
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:53,593
And since you figure it's gonna be
a long trip, that would give us...

847
01:13:53,718 --> 01:13:55,761
Oh, no, I'm not hungry, thanks.

848
01:13:55,886 --> 01:14:00,266
That would give us, what,
maybe four or five more days on news.

849
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:05,646
That way, once you set Rising Star free,
the whole country will be behind you.

850
01:14:06,564 --> 01:14:10,234
Then I'd just have to keep
lookin' back over my shoulder.

851
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:14,822
- What's so funny?
- Do you want to go to jail?

852
01:14:14,947 --> 01:14:15,656
No.

853
01:14:15,781 --> 01:14:18,576
Well, how do you think
this is gonna end up?

854
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:22,246
Not on television.

855
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:36,385
OK, I, uh... respect your position.

856
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:40,473
I do. I don't understand it,
but I respect it.

857
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:44,310
A lot of famous people hated publicity.

858
01:14:44,727 --> 01:14:47,104
Albert Schweitzer, Franco...

859
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:51,859
Albert Schweitzer... Um...

860
01:15:06,832 --> 01:15:09,085
How you doin', partner?

861
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:17,676
- Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.
- You didn't.

862
01:15:23,682 --> 01:15:25,476
What are we... doing?

863
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:27,645
Going to sleep.

864
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:31,482
- I'm not sleepy.
- You weren't hungry, either.

865
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:35,277
It's gonna be a long way, lady. Long way.

866
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:40,324
Well, um... where am I supposed to...?

867
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:42,701
Wherever you want.

868
01:15:57,174 --> 01:16:01,095
Where the hell are we,
the Donner Pass, for God's sakes?

869
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:08,894
I'm ready.

870
01:16:09,019 --> 01:16:11,689
I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus.

871
01:16:12,398 --> 01:16:16,735
When they spot that camper
they're gonna trace it right to him.

872
01:16:16,861 --> 01:16:19,363
What... what are you doin' with that?

873
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:22,658
This is expensive equipment,
and I'm responsible for it.

874
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:26,328
- I'm not gonna leave it there.
- We're walkin'. With our feet.

875
01:16:26,453 --> 01:16:29,290
There's no escalators out here,
or bellhops.

876
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:32,501
- Uh...
- Oh, no. He ain't carryin' it.

877
01:16:32,626 --> 01:16:35,337
- I didn't ask.
- And I ain't carryin' it, and you can't.

878
01:16:35,462 --> 01:16:37,506
I've carried this stuff a lot of times.

879
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:43,053
Where? Up the escalator at Bloomington's,
or Bloomingberg's, or wherever it is?

880
01:16:43,178 --> 01:16:47,099
Bloomingdale's. And what the hell
do you know about New York?

881
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:50,060
Ever hear of the Madison Square Gardens?

882
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:50,894
No.

883
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,857
They got a rodeo there, and it's
a damn big thing. And I've been in it.

884
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:57,651
Well, I've been to the rodeo. Twice.

885
01:17:01,655 --> 01:17:03,866
Did you stay
for the rattlesnake roundup?

886
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:06,452
Yes. I stayed right to the end.
I saw the whole thing.

887
01:17:06,577 --> 01:17:10,205
They don't have one. How are you
gonna round up a rattlesnake?

888
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:14,543
Oh, God. I'm just trying to be pleasant.
You get so worked up about everything.

889
01:17:14,668 --> 01:17:18,172
What have I got to be worked up about?
I've only got a stole horse...

890
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:23,218
...everybody but the Coast Guard after me,
and now I'm carryin' a crazy woman...

891
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:28,599
...wearin' shoes from Bloomingberg's, that
thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup.

892
01:17:31,018 --> 01:17:34,480
Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it.
Only it ain't goin' on my horse.

893
01:17:34,605 --> 01:17:36,940
Your horse

894
01:17:43,614 --> 01:17:47,326
Ahh... Here, give me
those glasses, would you?

895
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:49,828
They're prescription.

896
01:17:50,454 --> 01:17:53,707
You wait here with him
till I get back, ya hear?

897
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,877
But if you're spotted
and you don't come back...

898
01:17:57,002 --> 01:17:58,879
Call your lawyer.

899
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:07,262
Hello. Can I help you?

900
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:09,515
Howdy. Uh...

901
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:15,938
Well, uh, I'm broke down the road apiece,
and I wondered if I could use your phone...

902
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:21,360
I got a friend in Mesquite, and he's in
a bit of trouble, so I need to use a phone.

903
01:18:21,485 --> 01:18:25,656
I'd be obliged if I could use yours.
Happy to pay you for it.

904
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:30,327
- We got a phone. Come on in.
- Oh. Great. Appreci... Appreciate it.

905
01:18:32,412 --> 01:18:35,290
Phone's right there. You help yourself.

906
01:18:37,209 --> 01:18:39,253
Thank you.

907
01:19:04,111 --> 01:19:06,780
<i>- Hello?
- Gus, it's Sonny.</i>

908
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:07,948
Sonny!

909
01:19:08,073 --> 01:19:10,784
I gotta talk to you.
I can't talk long. Now listen...

910
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:13,704
<i>- Sonny!
- Gus, please, just listen real careful.</i>

911
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:17,124
<i>- I'm in the kitchen.
- People are gonna come, probably police.</i>

912
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:21,128
They're gonna ask you about the camper.
I want you to tell 'em I stole it.

913
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:23,881
Say it, Gus. "Sonny stole the camper."

914
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:26,925
My Wild Blue Yonder? I bought it in Elko.

915
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:31,346
No, Gus. I bought it for you, remember?
And I'll buy you a nice new one.

916
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:35,726
When the people ask about the camper,
tell them "Sonny stole the camper."

917
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:38,812
Try to remember it.
I'll see ya, friend. I gotta go.

918
01:19:42,566 --> 01:19:44,484
Oh, uh...

919
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,863
Partner, I'm much obliged
for the use of that phone.

920
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:50,699
Here. Five oughta cover it.

921
01:19:50,824 --> 01:19:52,868
Mr Steele...

922
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:58,749
...I don't want your money.

923
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:01,418
I saw you on the television.
You and the horse.

924
01:20:01,543 --> 01:20:05,088
I want you to know
I'd be proud to help you any way I can.

925
01:20:05,213 --> 01:20:09,217
Right now, it looks like
we oughta get you out of this county.

926
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:23,106
How do you like it so far?

927
01:20:34,534 --> 01:20:37,162
Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good?

928
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:41,416
Doin' all right. Got the whole worid
lookin' for that cowboy.

929
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:46,338
He's probably over that mountain by now.
I'd go take a nap on my porch.

930
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:49,508
I wouldn't wanna find him anyway -
except for that reward.

931
01:20:49,883 --> 01:20:52,177
50,000 bucks is a mound of cash.

932
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,931
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

933
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:45,856
All right, you're clear. Come on down.

934
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:06,126
I don't know where you're headed, but
Escalante's six miles over that mountain.

935
01:22:06,251 --> 01:22:11,631
The woman put together some stuff -
bread and cake and stew and coffee.

936
01:22:11,756 --> 01:22:14,259
I put a bottle in there
to keep your blood pumpin'.

937
01:22:14,384 --> 01:22:16,553
- I sure do thank you.
- Ain't no need to.

938
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:21,057
Listen, there's not many people
you'd trust $50,000 worth.

939
01:22:21,892 --> 01:22:26,313
You better get on over the mountain
'fore it comes to me what I'm passin' up.

940
01:22:28,481 --> 01:22:30,525
Come on.

941
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:35,989
Oh, my God!

942
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:41,369
- Can we rest a little?
- Not yet.

943
01:22:42,621 --> 01:22:47,000
- Where the hell are we?
- Well, not in jail, look at it that way.

944
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:51,087
- I can't go any farther.
- Oh, sure you can.

945
01:22:51,212 --> 01:22:57,052
Hell, I've known people go through stuff.
I knew a guy... misjudged a Brahma once.

946
01:22:57,177 --> 01:23:02,098
Put his rib through his right lung,
the guy could hardly breathe...

947
01:23:02,766 --> 01:23:06,186
He still got up and rode
the rankest mare there.

948
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:12,942
I will never understand why you find
that kind of behaviour admirable.

949
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:16,696
- Gets you up the hill.
- I have to rest... for a minute.

950
01:23:18,948 --> 01:23:21,076
Hey, Steele?

951
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:23,119
Sonny?

952
01:23:23,244 --> 01:23:25,789
Norman!

953
01:23:29,918 --> 01:23:32,253
How do you know "Norman"?

954
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:35,256
I never divulge sources.

955
01:23:36,633 --> 01:23:40,345
"Divulge sources"..."Divulge sources"...

956
01:23:41,846 --> 01:23:45,975
Here, get up. Come on.
You sure do your homework, don't you?

957
01:23:49,562 --> 01:23:52,899
Try to put your mind on somethin' else,
make things easier.

958
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,819
Get it off your feet.

959
01:23:57,195 --> 01:23:59,280
Do you know "The Star-Spangled Banner"?

960
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:01,408
- What?!
- The national anthem?

961
01:24:01,533 --> 01:24:06,287
I know it's the national anthem.
You mean can I sing it? It's hard to sing.

962
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:09,290
Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is?

963
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:14,212
Hey, that's a very interesting question.
Why don't we sit down and discuss it?

964
01:24:14,337 --> 01:24:16,840
I used to be a psychology major.

965
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:20,301
"America the Beautiful",
that's an easy tune to carry.

966
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:23,221
Why don't we sit down
and sing it together?

967
01:24:23,346 --> 01:24:25,390
# O spa...

968
01:24:26,391 --> 01:24:29,978
# O beautiful for spacious skies

969
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:33,273
# With amber waves of grain

970
01:24:33,398 --> 01:24:36,025
- Come on. Come on, sing it.
- Oh, God!

971
01:24:36,151 --> 01:24:40,989
# For purple mountains majesty

972
01:24:41,114 --> 01:24:46,244
# Above the fruited plain

973
01:24:46,744 --> 01:24:52,417
# America, America...

974
01:25:16,816 --> 01:25:19,235
Halloween.

975
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:21,571
Ha...

976
01:25:22,614 --> 01:25:24,866
Hal-louise?

977
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:28,161
- What?
- Your name: Hallie.

978
01:25:29,204 --> 01:25:31,539
That's not your name.

979
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:35,668
Alice.

980
01:25:36,127 --> 01:25:37,921
My name is Alice.

981
01:25:40,465 --> 01:25:43,801
My kid sister used
to holler at me after school.

982
01:25:44,427 --> 01:25:48,139
She'd yell "Haaa-lice!"

983
01:25:52,226 --> 01:25:54,938
So they called me Hallie.

984
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:57,398
Alice Martin.

985
01:26:00,318 --> 01:26:02,487
That fits you.

986
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,575
I used to bite and pinch a lot too.

987
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,577
I'll bet you did.

988
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:20,630
It's mustangs. Mares.
They smell the horse.

989
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:33,309
You know what you need?

990
01:26:37,271 --> 01:26:40,149
A pair of proper shoes.

991
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:48,741
Hey.

992
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:53,621
Where are we?

993
01:26:54,539 --> 01:26:56,582
Are we lost?

994
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:01,295
Lost?

995
01:27:02,797 --> 01:27:04,424
No.

996
01:27:09,595 --> 01:27:12,557
Good night... Alice.

997
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,772
Good night, Norman.

998
01:27:31,284 --> 01:27:34,996
If she's with Steele, then the network
will know where they are.

999
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:37,582
That's the news department, Mr Sears.

1000
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:41,210
I don't think they'll want
to give out that kind of information.

1001
01:27:41,335 --> 01:27:44,755
Are you saying we spent
$80 to $100 million in TV time...

1002
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:47,383
...and we can't get
a simple piece of information?

1003
01:27:47,508 --> 01:27:51,012
- No, sir, I'm not saying that...
- You don't ask the news department.

1004
01:27:51,137 --> 01:27:54,515
Ask the advertising department.
They'll ask the news department.

1005
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:32,303
What are you doin' up?

1006
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,723
Nothing much.

1007
01:28:38,017 --> 01:28:42,230
You've had a hard day.
Why don't you scrunch down in the bag?

1008
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:47,068
Oh, I wish it were that easy.

1009
01:28:47,777 --> 01:28:49,820
I don't sleep.

1010
01:28:50,863 --> 01:28:53,157
Ever?

1011
01:28:53,282 --> 01:28:55,618
How old are you?

1012
01:28:59,205 --> 01:29:03,042
Not in front of... in front
of people I don't know.

1013
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:08,881
You slept last night.

1014
01:29:09,006 --> 01:29:11,258
The hell I did.

1015
01:29:16,222 --> 01:29:18,599
Not in front of a stranger.

1016
01:29:20,893 --> 01:29:25,022
What, are you afraid of what you'll
look like with your mouth open?

1017
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:30,403
You have a mean streak in you.

1018
01:29:33,864 --> 01:29:35,616
No.

1019
01:29:36,784 --> 01:29:38,828
No, I don't.

1020
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:57,680
I still pinch and bite.

1021
01:30:03,644 --> 01:30:05,479
OK.

1022
01:30:42,308 --> 01:30:44,351
Morning.

1023
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,857
I'm still here.

1024
01:30:58,407 --> 01:31:03,829
There's... there's coffee from last night.
It's probably cold.

1025
01:31:05,748 --> 01:31:08,584
It probably is, if it hasn't been heated.

1026
01:31:10,085 --> 01:31:12,254
And there's cheese.

1027
01:31:13,964 --> 01:31:16,008
Cheese.

1028
01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:20,971
You're all bent. Are you sick?

1029
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:23,766
No. Just bent.

1030
01:31:25,518 --> 01:31:28,521
Well... Here, have some cheese.

1031
01:31:29,271 --> 01:31:33,359
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

1032
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:37,112
I know. I'm the one that said it.

1033
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:44,745
- Are you sure you're not hurt?
- No. Just...

1034
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:47,915
...some parts wake up faster than others.

1035
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:51,377
Broke parts take a little longer, though.

1036
01:32:05,266 --> 01:32:07,977
I, uh, I would've called a cab,
left you a note.

1037
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:11,522
You know, "Call me",
with my phone number.

1038
01:32:12,982 --> 01:32:17,111
Actually, I'd have left my answering
service number, just stuck it on the...

1039
01:32:17,236 --> 01:32:19,071
What's the matter?

1040
01:32:19,446 --> 01:32:21,907
I wanna know what's botherin' you.

1041
01:32:23,075 --> 01:32:27,913
It was just you and me last night.
It's not gonna be on television.

1042
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:33,961
- Is it?
- I don't know what you mean.

1043
01:32:34,086 --> 01:32:38,757
The problem is you get up slowly, I get
up fast. It's... the way that I was raised.

1044
01:32:38,882 --> 01:32:42,928
- Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up.
- We just got up, and got to work.

1045
01:32:43,053 --> 01:32:45,222
I was up before the sun
ever hit your room.

1046
01:32:45,347 --> 01:32:48,475
Well, then you get the getting-up medal.

1047
01:32:54,565 --> 01:32:58,360
Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry?
Isn't that what you said?

1048
01:32:58,652 --> 01:33:00,988
Good mornin', Alice.

1049
01:33:05,576 --> 01:33:07,786
Good morning.

1050
01:33:11,457 --> 01:33:13,959
You're right. We are in a hurry.

1051
01:33:14,835 --> 01:33:17,421
But let's say we lighten up a bit.

1052
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:20,215
I think that's a great idea. Lighten up.

1053
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,344
We're gonna be travelling together
a little while...

1054
01:33:29,475 --> 01:33:30,726
Oh...

1055
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:33,270
There. All lightened up.

1056
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:47,951
<i>...temperatures are dipping
below freezing in the high plateau.</i>

1057
01:33:48,076 --> 01:33:51,079
<i>On the national scene,
the search for Sonny Steele...</i>

1058
01:33:51,205 --> 01:33:55,417
<i>...is concentrated in central Utah.
KLSG switchboards have been jammed...</i>

1059
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:58,879
- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls.
- There ain't any.

1060
01:33:59,004 --> 01:34:01,799
Hell, you can name anything anything.

1061
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:06,845
It's like those people who
look up at the stars and see things.

1062
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:11,058
Chickens and bulls and chariots
and snakes and shit...

1063
01:34:14,978 --> 01:34:19,107
What's this guy's name who's supposed
to have a belt? Ryan, or O'Ryan...

1064
01:34:19,233 --> 01:34:21,735
Hell, there ain't no belt up there.

1065
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:24,613
Probably there was a falls here once.

1066
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:28,825
This whole land was under water
millions of years ago.

1067
01:34:28,951 --> 01:34:34,414
If you go... if you go slow,
take your time and you look real close...

1068
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,877
...you can find skeletons of these
weird-lookin' fishes in the hardpan...

1069
01:34:39,002 --> 01:34:41,296
...long, long gone.

1070
01:34:44,675 --> 01:34:49,179
All these mountains...
Hell, everything, everything you can see...

1071
01:34:49,805 --> 01:34:52,516
...everything, was under an ocean once.

1072
01:34:56,812 --> 01:35:01,108
- What are you smilin' at?
- I'm just enjoying the fact that you...

1073
01:35:01,733 --> 01:35:04,695
...that you know all that. It's interesting.

1074
01:35:06,655 --> 01:35:09,324
Well, this country's where I live.

1075
01:35:09,449 --> 01:35:13,078
- Don't you know where the subways go?
- Not lately.

1076
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:16,581
Oh, yeah, you do.

1077
01:35:17,249 --> 01:35:19,334
How'd you know to find me?

1078
01:35:19,459 --> 01:35:23,213
Musta been 70, 80 reporters there,
but you were the one that found me.

1079
01:35:23,338 --> 01:35:26,466
Just had a few hunches
and got a head start.

1080
01:35:27,426 --> 01:35:31,930
Oh, you had more than that, Alice.
You are good.

1081
01:35:44,526 --> 01:35:46,570
Let's go.

1082
01:35:48,655 --> 01:35:50,824
Here, give me that stuff here.

1083
01:35:50,949 --> 01:35:54,369
OK, I want you to put
your left foot right here.

1084
01:35:54,494 --> 01:35:56,580
- Come on.
- I don't know how to ride.

1085
01:35:56,705 --> 01:35:59,583
You're not gonna ride.
I'm gonna be doin' the steering.

1086
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,836
Listen, I'm not interested in horses.
They're... too big.

1087
01:36:02,961 --> 01:36:05,589
Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body.

1088
01:36:05,714 --> 01:36:10,343
We're not gonna get anywhere
with you in them spiky shoes. Come on.

1089
01:36:11,386 --> 01:36:14,723
- Oh, God...
- OK, swing your right leg right on over.

1090
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,142
That's it. There you go.

1091
01:36:17,601 --> 01:36:19,644
Here.

1092
01:36:19,853 --> 01:36:23,523
- Uh, should I pet him?
- Do what you want. He ain't no dog.

1093
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:38,121
<i> Doyle Hicks.
Go ahead, you're on the air.</i>

1094
01:36:38,246 --> 01:36:40,874
<i>-  Is this Doyle?
- Turn down your radio.</i>

1095
01:36:40,999 --> 01:36:44,169
<i>Yeah, well, I just wanna say
that what Sonny Steele done...</i>

1096
01:36:44,294 --> 01:36:47,339
<i>...is wonderful news
for the animals of this country.</i>

1097
01:36:47,464 --> 01:36:52,052
<i> If somebody's poisoning an
animal, a person should try and stop it.</i>

1098
01:36:52,177 --> 01:36:54,846
<i> I'd have done
the same damn thing myself.</i>

1099
01:36:54,971 --> 01:36:59,100
<i>Them Ampco people
got no right to dope up a horse.</i>

1100
01:37:30,465 --> 01:37:33,176
- What you got?
- Not gonna throw this away, are you?

1101
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:34,469
- What is it?
- Just notes.

1102
01:37:34,594 --> 01:37:36,388
Can I see 'em?

1103
01:37:36,513 --> 01:37:38,765
They're just my notes.

1104
01:37:41,393 --> 01:37:44,229
- What are these, in Russian?
- That's my handwriting.

1105
01:37:44,354 --> 01:37:46,606
- Well, read 'em.
- No.

1106
01:37:48,233 --> 01:37:50,527
You got a secret?

1107
01:37:58,034 --> 01:38:02,372
"I feel I'm seeing this country
for the first time."

1108
01:38:03,582 --> 01:38:07,294
"Not looking down
from a jet 30,000ft up...

1109
01:38:07,419 --> 01:38:13,550
...but from the low angle... of a special
man who means to cross it on foot...

1110
01:38:13,675 --> 01:38:19,180
...leading a thoroughbred stallion to
a secret destination... to a private goal."

1111
01:38:20,557 --> 01:38:25,020
"To a fairness that he intends
to find in these valleys."

1112
01:38:26,604 --> 01:38:30,900
"I..." I can't. They're just my notes.
I'm embarrassed.

1113
01:38:40,618 --> 01:38:42,454
Nice.

1114
01:38:42,954 --> 01:38:45,874
- It's hype.
- Coulda fooled me.

1115
01:38:49,085 --> 01:38:52,047
She ordered a camera crew
to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon.

1116
01:38:52,172 --> 01:38:55,884
- I suppose to photograph the...
- The ceremony.

1117
01:38:56,009 --> 01:38:58,595
The sales figures again, exactly.

1118
01:38:59,512 --> 01:39:04,184
In the three days since he took the horse,
office equipment has been as projected...

1119
01:39:04,309 --> 01:39:06,311
The cereal.

1120
01:39:06,436 --> 01:39:08,855
Cumulatively, up 30 per cent.

1121
01:39:09,397 --> 01:39:13,318
And by closing time today
they'd emptied the shelves.

1122
01:39:18,364 --> 01:39:20,325
Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it?

1123
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:25,914
Well, sir, there's something here
that I think you should be aware of.

1124
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:34,130
- Where'd you get that?
- There are kids selling 'em on the street.

1125
01:39:35,965 --> 01:39:38,468
Now that's not supposed to be there.

1126
01:39:38,593 --> 01:39:40,929
Or we're not supposed to be here.

1127
01:39:41,054 --> 01:39:43,098
<i>You're lost?</i>

1128
01:39:44,557 --> 01:39:48,269
About a mile's worth, I'd say.
We gotta get off this ridge.

1129
01:39:49,145 --> 01:39:51,189
Maybe... Do...

1130
01:39:51,564 --> 01:39:56,361
- Maybe I could get us some supplies.
- We got enough supplies. Let's go.

1131
01:39:59,197 --> 01:40:00,448
Oh!

1132
01:40:03,034 --> 01:40:05,078
Here, here...

1133
01:40:05,203 --> 01:40:07,247
You OK?

1134
01:40:08,248 --> 01:40:09,999
Are you all right?

1135
01:40:10,124 --> 01:40:12,293
A- OK.

1136
01:40:12,418 --> 01:40:16,089
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1137
01:40:16,756 --> 01:40:18,508
Maybe you ought to sit down.

1138
01:40:18,633 --> 01:40:23,805
- You don't understand the problem.
- Well, lay down or somethin'. Here.

1139
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:26,558
And listen to you bitch about my boots?
No, thank you.

1140
01:40:26,683 --> 01:40:29,727
No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em.
Here. Right here.

1141
01:40:29,853 --> 01:40:32,272
Oh... God, my back.

1142
01:40:32,981 --> 01:40:34,649
Easy.

1143
01:40:34,941 --> 01:40:36,985
Let's take a look.

1144
01:40:37,402 --> 01:40:41,155
You just relax, cos we're makin'
good time, don't worry.

1145
01:40:42,532 --> 01:40:44,576
Hold on.

1146
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,798
Here.

1147
01:40:58,923 --> 01:41:00,049
Oh.

1148
01:41:00,174 --> 01:41:02,176
Little hair of the dog.

1149
01:41:02,302 --> 01:41:03,803
Oh!

1150
01:41:12,353 --> 01:41:16,274
- I feel better already.
- Yeah, well, don't put it away.

1151
01:41:23,906 --> 01:41:29,662
Hey, why don't you get some rest?
I'll go find us a place to cross the road.

1152
01:41:30,955 --> 01:41:32,999
I won't be long.

1153
01:41:40,423 --> 01:41:42,800
Hi, there. What's your name?

1154
01:41:43,509 --> 01:41:46,596
- Louise.
- Oh! Same as mine.

1155
01:41:47,638 --> 01:41:52,226
You, uh... you taking care
of this place all by yourself?

1156
01:41:52,352 --> 01:41:57,106
- Is your name really Louise?
- You bet. Your mom and dad here?

1157
01:41:57,231 --> 01:42:00,193
My mom went to get butane.
We're all out.

1158
01:42:00,902 --> 01:42:03,029
- You have a telephone?
- It's out too.

1159
01:42:03,154 --> 01:42:07,909
Every time it snows up at Marysville,
first thing, the phone goes out.

1160
01:42:08,034 --> 01:42:10,078
Where's your car?

1161
01:42:10,703 --> 01:42:14,874
Oh, I'm... I'm sort of camping out,
and my car went on the blink.

1162
01:42:14,999 --> 01:42:18,544
And I, uh... I need
to get a message to my boss.

1163
01:42:18,669 --> 01:42:21,756
Are you gonna be near a phone later on?
After you close up?

1164
01:42:21,881 --> 01:42:23,674
Well, we got a phone at home.

1165
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,427
I bet you could call for me
and get a message to him.

1166
01:42:26,552 --> 01:42:30,223
Could you do that? How much
do you charge to make a call?

1167
01:42:30,348 --> 01:42:31,974
One dollar.

1168
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:35,186
That's fair. OK, let me
give you the phone number...

1169
01:42:35,311 --> 01:42:39,607
...and when you get him on the phone, ask
for Les Charles. Don't talk to anybody else.

1170
01:42:39,732 --> 01:42:41,943
And tell him you're calling for me...

1171
01:42:42,068 --> 01:42:44,695
- For Louise.
- No... Yeah.

1172
01:42:44,821 --> 01:42:47,573
- Louise, in Utah.
- I know what state it is.

1173
01:42:47,698 --> 01:42:53,788
Tell him I said call off the crew, call off
everything. I'll explain when I see him.

1174
01:42:53,913 --> 01:42:57,291
- Shouldn't I say your car broke down?
- No, no. Just the rest of it.

1175
01:42:57,416 --> 01:43:01,420
<i>- About the flu?
- No, the crew. I'll write it out for you.</i>

1176
01:43:01,546 --> 01:43:04,298
- Her car broke down.
- Oh, where's it at, miss?

1177
01:43:04,423 --> 01:43:06,551
Well, it...

1178
01:43:06,676 --> 01:43:09,428
Well, it didn't really break down,
it's just acting...

1179
01:43:09,554 --> 01:43:11,722
And I have to call her boss about it.

1180
01:43:11,848 --> 01:43:15,852
Say, aren't you... You know, television.
You've seen her.

1181
01:43:15,977 --> 01:43:19,147
- Last week I saw her.
- News. News. News commentator.

1182
01:43:19,272 --> 01:43:22,733
It's too complicated, Louise.
Thanks anyway.

1183
01:43:23,818 --> 01:43:26,696
- What's your name? Please.
- Louise.

1184
01:43:30,324 --> 01:43:32,577
Found us a spot.

1185
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:37,206
- How you doin'?
- Good as new.

1186
01:43:37,999 --> 01:43:40,042
Serves you right.

1187
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,882
There's a place we can cross the road
about a mile south.

1188
01:43:46,007 --> 01:43:50,845
Gotta honk on it though.
I wanna get there before dark.

1189
01:43:51,345 --> 01:43:52,930
We're that close?

1190
01:43:53,055 --> 01:43:56,934
Yeah, for where we can spend the night.
Inside, for a change. Come on.

1191
01:43:57,059 --> 01:44:01,522
Isn't there some closer place where
you guys take horses to let 'em go?

1192
01:44:01,647 --> 01:44:04,525
No. I just usually use the one, myself.

1193
01:44:05,651 --> 01:44:08,779
It's so pretty here.
If I were Rising Star, I'd love to...

1194
01:44:08,905 --> 01:44:10,865
Well, you're not. Come on.

1195
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:15,411
Do me a favour, will you, Alice?
Don't go tryin' to think like a horse.

1196
01:44:16,329 --> 01:44:18,456
I'll worry about him. You just take notes.

1197
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:39,894
OI' Clark Wembly had this place built.
Us cowboys used to use it for huntin'.

1198
01:44:40,019 --> 01:44:43,689
Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin'.

1199
01:44:44,357 --> 01:44:48,277
He had a voice that was
just like runnin' molasses.

1200
01:44:49,111 --> 01:44:53,324
And it'd come over the PA system...
"Sorry you lost, Sonny."

1201
01:44:53,449 --> 01:44:57,578
And there I'd be, lyin' in the dirt, just
havin' been dumped on by some bull...

1202
01:44:57,703 --> 01:45:02,124
...just broke and busted, but ol' Clark's
voice'd come sailin' across...

1203
01:45:02,249 --> 01:45:06,629
...and he'd say "Give him a big hand, folks.
Glad you come. Better luck next time."

1204
01:45:06,754 --> 01:45:09,382
God, Jesus! He was so terrific.

1205
01:45:09,882 --> 01:45:13,219
He made me feel good.
He made me feel like tryin'.

1206
01:45:13,344 --> 01:45:18,224
And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho.
Oh, what an animal.

1207
01:45:18,349 --> 01:45:20,601
That horse used to ju...

1208
01:45:22,395 --> 01:45:26,273
Bub-bub-blurgh-blurgh,
runnin' right off at the mouth.

1209
01:45:26,941 --> 01:45:28,984
I enjoyed it.

1210
01:45:35,699 --> 01:45:40,037
- When are we gonna get there?
- About midday.

1211
01:45:47,086 --> 01:45:49,130
It's been a long haul.

1212
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:01,016
Somethin' bothering you?

1213
01:46:03,018 --> 01:46:07,690
- What are you gonna do after?
- Oh, you gonna start with the questions?

1214
01:46:08,315 --> 01:46:14,738
Well, when he's loose, chasing mares,
do you just... do you just do the same?

1215
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:18,367
<i>What do you think?</i>

1216
01:46:18,492 --> 01:46:23,247
You're the one takin' the notes.
You're a... clever lady.

1217
01:46:23,622 --> 01:46:27,793
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- You say it like it's a bad word, "clever".

1218
01:46:27,918 --> 01:46:30,254
No. I like you bein' smart.

1219
01:46:31,714 --> 01:46:36,343
It's just sometimes you're so busy
being clever that I don't...

1220
01:46:37,887 --> 01:46:40,931
When was the last time
you were surprised?

1221
01:46:43,142 --> 01:46:45,186
You.

1222
01:46:45,728 --> 01:46:47,938
You were a surprise.

1223
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:58,866
I told them.

1224
01:46:58,991 --> 01:47:01,076
Wha... Who?

1225
01:47:02,369 --> 01:47:04,246
I, uh...

1226
01:47:08,918 --> 01:47:13,631
I called the network and I told them
you were going to Rim Rock Canyon.

1227
01:47:13,756 --> 01:47:17,426
And I asked them to meet me there
with a camera crew.

1228
01:47:18,636 --> 01:47:20,262
Oh.

1229
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,516
And that's not all.

1230
01:47:25,017 --> 01:47:27,436
<i>Oh, now for the bad news?</i>

1231
01:47:28,938 --> 01:47:33,359
I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail.
I wasn't in any trouble.

1232
01:47:38,864 --> 01:47:40,407
Well.

1233
01:47:41,659 --> 01:47:44,161
Well, well, well.

1234
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:51,669
<i>What do you know.</i>

1235
01:47:52,628 --> 01:47:56,382
Oh, Sonny... Please, don't just walk away.

1236
01:47:56,507 --> 01:47:59,802
Don't be like that. Hit me,
yell at me, slap me or something.

1237
01:47:59,927 --> 01:48:02,388
I already slapped you.
First time we was alone.

1238
01:48:02,513 --> 01:48:07,309
- Swear to God I wouldn't do it now.
- Oh? Is that right? You a new person?

1239
01:48:07,434 --> 01:48:09,978
It was three days ago.
I didn't understand what...

1240
01:48:10,104 --> 01:48:12,606
Yeah. A lot can happen in three days.

1241
01:48:14,108 --> 01:48:17,152
I didn't want to ruin anything for you,
Sonny.

1242
01:48:17,277 --> 01:48:21,532
- I had a job to do and I wanted a story.
- Well, you got it.

1243
01:48:22,157 --> 01:48:24,201
You did it.

1244
01:48:33,544 --> 01:48:35,796
Hey, how about my letter?

1245
01:48:37,089 --> 01:48:39,925
Did you mail it?
Or is that gonna be on TV?

1246
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:42,094
Oh, please!

1247
01:48:46,974 --> 01:48:49,810
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What I said.

1248
01:48:49,935 --> 01:48:52,813
- Why not just take him to another place?
- No.

1249
01:48:53,063 --> 01:48:55,732
<i>- Why?
- I want him at that place.</i>

1250
01:48:55,858 --> 01:48:58,986
Everybody's done their thing.
Ampco did what they had to do...

1251
01:48:59,111 --> 01:49:01,321
...you did, now I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

1252
01:49:01,447 --> 01:49:05,117
Sonny, you can't go there.
They'll be there. The police may be there.

1253
01:49:05,242 --> 01:49:09,163
I can't run for ever. Look, we're either
all goin' to heaven or we ain't.

1254
01:49:09,288 --> 01:49:13,041
Besides, you want to see the finish.
Well, be still.

1255
01:49:14,168 --> 01:49:16,211
Let it finish.

1256
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:21,008
Oh, I don't want you to be hurt.

1257
01:49:21,925 --> 01:49:24,636
I've been hurt. I still get up.

1258
01:49:32,728 --> 01:49:34,980
Thanks for the worry.

1259
01:49:40,194 --> 01:49:42,404
Do me a favour?

1260
01:49:42,529 --> 01:49:45,699
Tomorrow... don't take notes.

1261
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:50,704
Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry.

1262
01:50:27,991 --> 01:50:30,243
Better get off.

1263
01:50:35,415 --> 01:50:38,001
How soon before we get there?

1264
01:50:41,171 --> 01:50:43,465
<i>We are there.</i>

1265
01:50:48,387 --> 01:50:51,515
Wait a minute...
The camera crew, they're not here.

1266
01:50:53,392 --> 01:50:55,268
Appears not.

1267
01:50:55,394 --> 01:50:58,563
Well, Star, what do you think of the place?

1268
01:50:59,064 --> 01:51:01,817
They... they must be at another entrance.

1269
01:51:01,942 --> 01:51:04,236
Ain't no other entrance.

1270
01:51:05,821 --> 01:51:08,073
Well, then hurry. Maybe they're lost.

1271
01:51:08,198 --> 01:51:10,450
I doubt it.

1272
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:13,453
Well, where the hell are they?

1273
01:51:13,578 --> 01:51:17,332
Probably in Rim Rock Canyon.
Isn't that where you told 'em to go?

1274
01:51:20,794 --> 01:51:23,296
They'd be about 90 miles north.

1275
01:51:24,464 --> 01:51:28,719
- This isn't...
- This here's Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it?

1276
01:51:30,137 --> 01:51:30,804
You...

1277
01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:34,558
Oh, no, now! I never said we were goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon! You said it!

1278
01:51:34,683 --> 01:51:37,602
Hey, look out!
Don't get me with them boots!

1279
01:51:40,147 --> 01:51:42,566
Where is he?
And what was this about a reward?

1280
01:51:42,691 --> 01:51:45,193
- I... I...
- We've been misinformed.

1281
01:51:45,318 --> 01:51:48,071
When our own investigation
revealed the truth...

1282
01:51:48,196 --> 01:51:50,991
...naturally we understood
Mr Steele's motivation.

1283
01:51:54,286 --> 01:51:58,415
I don't think there's enough food
to last another night.

1284
01:52:01,126 --> 01:52:04,379
- I don't think he's coming.
- It's occurred to me.

1285
01:52:10,677 --> 01:52:14,347
Well, Star, you wanna
say goodbye to the lady?

1286
01:52:19,019 --> 01:52:21,062
Hey, boy.

1287
01:52:26,985 --> 01:52:29,488
- Swing your tail.
- Excuse us.

1288
01:52:41,333 --> 01:52:43,168
OK.

1289
01:52:44,336 --> 01:52:48,340
Remember, they're just horses.
Same as you.

1290
01:52:49,174 --> 01:52:53,386
Only they've never been broke. But
they ain't won no championships neither.

1291
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:59,684
So when you cross that stallion
and he wants to fight...

1292
01:52:59,809 --> 01:53:04,898
...you remember, you got the blood
on your side. And you can take him.

1293
01:53:07,317 --> 01:53:10,612
- Is he just gonna go, just like that?
- You bet.

1294
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:14,199
- I thought you guys were pals.
- We are.

1295
01:53:19,329 --> 01:53:21,831
Make somethin' outta yourself now.

1296
01:54:19,514 --> 01:54:22,267
Yeah. When I see you, Les.
About nine o'clock.

1297
01:54:22,392 --> 01:54:24,436
OK, bye-bye.

1298
01:54:29,441 --> 01:54:32,861
There's your bus. Looks like it's on time.

1299
01:54:33,278 --> 01:54:35,447
Oh. Good.

1300
01:54:41,286 --> 01:54:43,788
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

1301
01:54:44,998 --> 01:54:47,751
Maybe not as good as him, but... good.

1302
01:54:47,876 --> 01:54:49,878
What did they say?

1303
01:54:50,003 --> 01:54:54,674
Oh, they're full of congratulations.
Can't wait to get the story.

1304
01:54:54,799 --> 01:54:58,595
Especially now that Ampco
has reversed its position.

1305
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,263
Yeah, I'll bet.

1306
01:55:00,388 --> 01:55:04,309
They have me going to Paris next
to cover the elections.

1307
01:55:04,851 --> 01:55:08,772
Well, no kiddin'?
That oughta be interesting.

1308
01:55:11,399 --> 01:55:15,320
- More coffee?
- No, not for me, thanks. You want any?

1309
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:17,780
Yes, please.

1310
01:55:20,074 --> 01:55:23,077
Just a little somethin' for the road.

1311
01:55:40,261 --> 01:55:43,014
Ho, ho, ho... Careful there.

1312
01:55:55,944 --> 01:55:57,028
Tell me, Norman...

1313
01:55:57,153 --> 01:56:00,823
...did you think it'd be this tough
to get rid of a pain in the ass like me?

1314
01:56:01,908 --> 01:56:03,826
Ma'am, I had no idea.

1315
01:56:03,952 --> 01:56:08,790
All aboard the bus. Cedar City,
Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado.

1316
01:56:14,587 --> 01:56:17,590
Uh, that story you're gonna tell...

1317
01:56:17,715 --> 01:56:21,261
It'd be nice if you didn't mention
where it was that we let him go.

1318
01:56:21,386 --> 01:56:22,887
Silver Reef?

1319
01:56:23,012 --> 01:56:25,598
<i>Be nice if you didn't divulge that source.</i>

1320
01:56:25,723 --> 01:56:28,893
I don't know, leave out a name like that...

1321
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:38,194
What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny?

1322
01:56:38,695 --> 01:56:41,906
Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on.

1323
01:56:43,533 --> 01:56:45,910
Find me somethin' simple.

1324
01:56:47,954 --> 01:56:51,624
Hard, maybe, but plain and quiet.

1325
01:56:53,001 --> 01:56:55,086
Any bags, ma'am?

1326
01:56:55,211 --> 01:56:57,046
Uh, no.

1327
01:56:59,632 --> 01:57:01,467
Uh, hey...?

1328
01:57:03,261 --> 01:57:05,638
I keep wantin' to thank you.

1329
01:57:05,763 --> 01:57:08,307
But then I keep wonderin' what for.

1330
01:57:08,891 --> 01:57:11,227
I know. I know. Me too.

1331
01:57:13,896 --> 01:57:19,027
Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel
whenever I see you on television.

1332
01:57:22,905 --> 01:57:25,867
Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV.

1333
01:57:30,371 --> 01:57:31,956
So...

1334
01:57:32,081 --> 01:57:34,125
All aboard, ma'am.

1335
01:57:43,801 --> 01:57:46,471
- So long, Alice.
- So long, Norman.

1336
01:57:47,513 --> 01:57:49,807
Have a safe trip back now.

1337
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:06,991
All charges have been dropped,
and, sources say...

1338
01:58:07,116 --> 01:58:11,287
...the Ampco art department
is hard at work designing a new logo.

1339
01:58:11,412 --> 01:58:14,081
As to the whereabouts of Rising Star...

1340
01:58:15,166 --> 01:58:17,460
...nothing further is known.

1341
01:58:17,585 --> 01:58:21,506
So ends the bizarre saga
of horse racing's most honoured stallion...

1342
01:58:21,631 --> 01:58:24,217
...and the man who set him free.

1343
01:58:25,927 --> 01:58:29,972

from this reporter to Mr Steele...

00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,507
That was a little compliment there.

1445
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,719
Here's a ranch for sale in Baily. 450 acres.

1446
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,015
You shoulda got that place at Spanish
Fork instead of that Malibu house.

1447
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,311
Oh, Spanish... What's the matter
with the Malibu house?

1448
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,649
I don't remember your minding it so much.
You was in the water half the time...

1449
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,112
...wearin' them flippers, lookin' dumb,
actin' like a damn penguin.

1450
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:54,534
What's the matter with you pickers?
You're not on the bacon-and-bean circuit.

1451
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,330
You got room service, you're flyin' around
first class, you got limousines...

1452
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,959
...ladies in the lobby,
the laundry has tissue paper in it...

1453
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:08,506
You're livin' like a bunch of fat oil barons!
Livin'... better than we got a right to.

1454
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,803
- Cowboys in the ocean makes no sense.
- Beats havin' a bull tap-dance on you.

1455
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:18,766
- Leroy, get them pants pressed, will you?
- And it beats havin' your legs braided.

1456
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,478
And it beats havin' a bull
use your head for a floor mat. Don't it?

1457
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
Ah...

1458
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,078
# Momma...

1459
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:43,124
# Don't let your babies
grow up to be cowboys

1460
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,838
# Don't let 'em pick guitars
and drive them old trucks

1461
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,926
# Make 'em be doctors
and lawyers and such

1462
00:09:54,594 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>(all) # Momma, don't let your babies

<i>(car horn blasts)</i>

1466
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,414
We'd have been here sooner,
but we ran into these, uh, javelinas...

1467
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,917
- Can I have a coffee?
- Just a minute...

1468
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,378
- There's no rush.
- There ain't?

1469
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,130
Come on. I wanna show you something.

1470
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:37,095
<i>(PA)...tonight's half-time highlight,
one of the all-time great cowboys,...</i>

1471
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,432
<i>...five-time All-Around World Champion
Sonny Steele!</i>

1472
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:48,189
<i>Sonny Steele appears tonight

1473
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,775
<i>...a division of Ampco Industries.</i>

1474
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,944
Well, what in the hell...?!

1475
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,202
- That's not me.
- They don't know the difference.

1476
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,939
What's your name?
How come you're so cute?

1477
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,528
- What time's the press conference?
- Uh, got half an hour.

1478
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,697
Here you are, Hallie.

1479
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,201
Now, if there's anything you need,
just say the word.

1480
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,413
We got about half a dozen
movie people here...

1481
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,416
...Bud Broderick,
Joanna Camden just came in...

1482
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,752
...Rising Star is here...
- What are you gonna do with the horse?

1483
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:56,465
He'll appear on stage with Sonny Steele,
the cowboy we use in Ranch Breakfast.

1484
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,051
You think he's worth coverin'?

1485
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,389
Well, there's better stuff.
I mean, the cowboy's a peach of a guy...

1486
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:08,019
...but there's just a lot of "yup"
and "shucks", and stuff like that.

1487
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,980
He's no interview.
Better steer clear of him.

1488
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,026
See you downstairs.

1489
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:22,241
Bernie... So, they don't want us
to talk to the cowboy.

1490
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:26,412
- Where do you wanna start?
- Where do I wanna start?!

1491
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,581
<i>(horn blast)</i>

1492
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,218
Excuse me, please.

1493
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,182
- Where the hell is he?
- Probably drunk in Barstow somewhere.

1494
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:53,856
Excuse me, could you tell me
if Mr Sonny Steele has checked in yet?

1495
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,527
No, he's not listed.

1496
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,908
- It's an interesting watchband.
- Thank you. It's Indian.

1497
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,452
- May I see it?
- Sure.

1498
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,791
Oh, it's lovely.

1499
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:17,004
Why does Ampco say absolutely
no interviews with Sonny Steele?

1500
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,175
- Who told you that?
- Oh, one of the people at Ampco.

1501
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,179
That don't really
mean anything, you know.

1502
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,558
Sonny hasn't been himself lately.
They're a little down on him. But it's OK.

1503
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,354
He's just a cowboy. Sometimes
he loses the best part of himself.

1504
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,981
What is the best part of himself?

1505
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>- You'd have to know him a long time.
- How long have you known him?</i>

1506
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,364
<i># Cowboys ain't easy to love</i>

1507
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,075
<i># And they're harder to hold</i>

1508
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,707
<i># And they'd rather give you a song
than diamonds and gold</i>

1509

<i># Lone Star belt buckles

1510

00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,177
<i># And if you don't understand him</i>

1512
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,471
<i># And he don't die young</i>

1513
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,808
<i># He'll probably just ride away</i>

1514
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,704
- Where the hell you been?
- What's he doin' in a parking lot?

1515
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,665
I don't know, but he got here on time.
Come on.

1516
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,296
Press conference has started and Danny
Miles has waited all day to rehearse you.

1517
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,674
- Well, here you are.
- Wendell, what do I have to do?

1518
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,053
Well, there's been all kind of hell to pay,
so just behave yourself.

1519
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,517
Boy, you smell like a tequila factory.
Here, put these Tic Tacs in your mouth.

1520
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,438
You'll never guess who I seen.
Rush, and Hawkman, and old Edgar...

1521
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,525
Hey, watch it there, partner!
They all send their hellos.

1522
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,403
Foggy Tate's wife Louise
gave me this handkerchief.

1523
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,158
- I told you he was in Barstow.
- Whew! God, they got pretty girls here!

1524
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:14,705
Come on. This is a serious thing to these
people. They're tryin' to buy this big bank.

1525
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,750
- Hold it. What's in here?
- It's a press conference.

1526
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,086
So don't tell no jokes,
don't lift up nobody's dress, OK?

1527
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,673
- What do I have to say?
- Nothin', if we're lucky. Come on.

1528
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,550
John, you had a question.

1529
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:31,013
Do you anticipate opposition
to the takeover of Omnibank?

1530
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,642
Just a moment.
It isn't a takeover, it's a merger.

1531
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:40,272
- But Omnibank has always opposed...
- We think that attitude's changing.

1532
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,817
We've made a generous tender offer
for the Omnibank shares.

1533
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,362
We're confident they'll accept it.

1534
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,574
Troy, you look like you're gonna jump
outta that seat. You have a question?

1535
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,534
For Mr Broderick.

1536
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,331
Bud, you've played opposite just about
every great motion-picture actress.

1537
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,418
- Yes, I have.
- Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser?

1538
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,175
That depends. What part of the body
are you talking about?

1539
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,302
Print that. I dare you.

1540
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,682
Mr Steele, why were you 45 minutes late
to the press conference?

1541
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,269
Ha... Well...

1542
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,273
I'd like to apologise for that.

1543
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:30,364
I was, uh... I was givin' mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to a bottle of tequila.

1544
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,157
<i>(laughter)</i>

1545
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,493
And we lost her, too.

1546
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,414
Do you in fact
eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast?

1547
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, ma'am, I eat
steak and eggs for breakfast.

1548
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,379
- You were three-time...
- And Ranch Breakfast for lunch.

1549
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,508
You were three-time
World Champion Cowboy...

1550
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,427
Five.

1551
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:57,391
Five-times World Champion Cowboy,
and now you're selling cereal.

1552
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,852
How do you feel about that?

1553
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:08,318
- Lady, I don't wanna tangle with you.
- Listen, we've got a time problem here.

1554
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,363
You are all invited
by our chairman, Mr Hunt Sears...

1555
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:16,201
...to a reception before the performance.
And enjoy yourselves, you hear?

1556
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,871
- You got a rehearsal.
- What was that all about?

1557
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,832
- I don't know. Come on.
- Rehearse what?

1558
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:26,253
After you circle, you stop
on your mark, stage left...

1559
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,840
...lean forward in the saddle,
face the audience, wave...

1560
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,384
Where's the horse?

1561
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,262
Bring in the damn horse.

1562
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,852
Spot, please.

1563
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,234
God, he's a beauty.

1564
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,614
Tom, Sonny rides in circles three times,
applause, applause, applause...

1565
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,701
...then stops on the mark.
Sonny, your first line is...

1566
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:02,623
- What have you got him on?
- A little bute. And some penicillin.

1567
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,632
This tendon, it ought
to be braced and bandaged.

1568
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,801
- They think it don't look right.
- Uh, hello?

1569
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,763
- What do you mean, they think...
- Sonny.

1570
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,266
- After you stop, you say...
- Your horse is stoned.

1571
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,311
How else are we gonna get him up here
with all these lights?

1572
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,272
Excuse me, gentlemen!
We're trying to rehearse!

1573
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,151
Sonny, your first line...

1574
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:37,616
"Ranch Breakfast...
a champ's way to start the morning."

1575
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,787
Then you look at the horse and you say
"Ain't that right, Risin' Star?"

1576
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,706
"If you agree, don't say anything."

1577
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,999
<i>(laughs)</i>

1578
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:49,044
It's funny. It's funny. You try it.

1579
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,512
<i>(flatly) "Ranch Breakfast,
a champ's way to start the morning."</i>

1580
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,473
Wonderful. But much, much bigger.

1581
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,017
Much bigger. Louder.

1582
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,896
"Ranch Bre..."

1583
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,360
- There's more. There's more.
- I saw it.

1584
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,704
That's the most discourteous thing
I ever saw in the theatre.

1585
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:26,999
Sonny, this is Hunt Sears.
He ain't no flunky.

1586
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,417
This it here?

1587
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,752
You ain't in no shape
to see no Hunt Sears.

1588
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,838
What I gotta do first? Jog?

1589
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:38,343
Dual overhead camshafts, fully enclosed
drive shaft, dual disc brakes in front...

1590
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:44,433
Each item will appear in several major
magazines during the month of July.

1591
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,520
As an example of our confidence
in the success of these new fashions...

1592
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:53,817
...Ampco will be sending these lovely
models on a one-month tour...

1593
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,570
Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol.

1594
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,196
Hey. How are you?

1595
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,949
Well, then let's...

1596
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,704
Carol's interested in commercials...

1597
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,332
Hey, Sonny, I wanna get my son a horse.
What kind is best?

1598
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,793
- How old is your kid?
- He's six years old.

1599
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,879
Get him a short horse.

1600
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:18,300
- Hey, Hallie Martin. We met in New York.
- Did we like each other?

1601
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,803
That question about the merger -
who the hell was that guy?

1602
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:26,516
<i>That was Cross, the Washington bureau
of the Times. He's connected to Treasury.</i>

1603
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,977
- He shouldn't have been here.
- Spilt milk.

1604
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:33,440
Sonny, here's a couple I'd
like you to meet. Mr and Mrs Phillips.

1605
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,359
- Hi.
- Steve Phillips, the Million-Dollar Club.

1606
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,529
Sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year.

1607
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:43,450
- Well, the mean-question lady.
- I'm just curious.

1608
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:48,121
- Uh, Steve Phillips, the...
- You know what curiosity did to the cat.

1609
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:52,959
He sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year. Wholesale.

1610
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:56,129
Are you kiddin' me? That's just fantastic.

1611
00:20:56,254 --> 00:21:00,008
- We're very proud of it.
- I'll bet you are. And I am too. Damn.

1612
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,928
- I just love that...
- This is Grace Phillips.

1613
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,264
I know. We met too.
Everything's going around and around.

1614
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:10,519
- Oh, that poster is beautiful.
- It's a great gimmick. Very effective.

1615
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:15,941
Grace, why don't you stand in front of it
with Sonny, and Steve can take a picture.

1616
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:20,153
Why not just take a picture of Grace in
front of that picture of me and the box...

1617
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,240
...with a picture of me on the box,
holding a picture of me...

1618
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,077
Then you got Grace
and a whole bunch of pictures of me.

1619
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,415
Sonny, you know that TV show in Denver?
We've had to make changes in your copy.

1620
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,793
I bet it's shorter.

1621
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,880
- In a multimedia situation...
- Mr Sears?

1622
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,968
Hello, Sonny. It's about time
we finally met, isn't it?

1623
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,680
- Yes, sir, it's about time.
- Everybody here know Mr Steele?

1624
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,641
Like our horse?
Couldn't have a better straight man.

1625
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,477
- Can I have a word with you, sir?
- Perhaps later.

1626
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,231
- Beautiful animal, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, he's an amazing animal.

1627
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,901
But he don't belong
in a parking lot in Las Vegas.

1628
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:04,739
I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most
natural place in the world for any of us.

1629
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,410
Well, sir, I don't think he's feelin' so good.

1630
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,829
Let's give him a drink!

1631
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,832
Rising Star represents
a substantial investment.

1632
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,168
You can be sure
we've entrusted his care to experts.

1633
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,880
Well, I don't think
them experts are so expert.

1634
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:27,345
Mr Steele, would you please sign this
picture for me? For my daughter Tammy.

1635
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,184
Look, why don't I make an appointment
with Mr Sears's secretary...

1636
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,563
Why would you put that horse
on a stage with dancing girls?

1637
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,274
<i>- Just a minute...
- I'm talkin' to him.</i>

1638
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,487
It sells products, Sonny.

1639
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:50,076
You mustn't apply logic to advertising.
It'll just confound you, believe me.

1640
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,371
Well, it just don't feel right to me.
It seems wrong.

1641
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:56,750
All them lights blinkin' and winkin',
and girls...

1642
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,169
Sir, I used to rodeo.

1643
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,715
- And I was good at it.
- That's irrelevant.

1644
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,219
To who?

1645
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:11,181
This is a conversation
we might have some other time.

1646
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,223
Would it matter?

1647
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:15,810
What matters is that you fulfil
the requirements of your contract.

1648
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:20,023
Which don't include your passing
judgment on corporate policy.

1649
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,693
Nothin' in that contract
about me ridin' toy horses.

1650
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,237
You're not in rodeo any more.

1651
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,740
Actually, you're more famous now,
aren't you?

1652
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,702
Your face is on millions of boxes,
on billboards all over the country...

1653
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:35,121
...people want your autograph...

1654
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,416
What I'm talking about
is that you voluntarily accepted...

1655
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,586
...a highly paid, relatively simple job...

1656
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:46,549
...that more than a handful of cowboys
would give their right arm for.

1657
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,886
You're right.

1658
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,555
I don't want just to be right.

1659
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,644
- You want me to like it?
- It would be a factor in our relationship.

1660
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,397
Mr Sears, Joanna Camden
is waiting over by the earthmover.

1661
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,776
- Why don't we have a picture session?
- Excuse us, please.

1662
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,111
You bet.

1663
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,032
- I'm sorry, sir.
- When this is over, get rid of him.

1664
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,396
- Charlotta! Hey!
- Got a quarter?

1665
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,482
No, don't... don't say it.
I bet that cheque's in the mail.

1666
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:47,944
Wendell handles all that, babe,
you know that. Come talk to me.

1667
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,738
<i>How is old Wendell
who can't find a stamp?</i>

1668
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:56,327
Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels,
please. Tall glass.

1669
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:02,250
- The lady will take a Rob Roy.
- Orangeade. I quit.

1670
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:06,421
What... What's the matter?
You're not born-again, are you?

1671
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,883
Maybe I am.
I got me a record contract now.

1672
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,886
<i>All on my own too.
You be sure and tell Wendell Hixson that.</i>

1673
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,099
You sure are tough on Wendell. Not that
I blame you, cheques bein' late an' all.

1674
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:22,145
I don't wanna talk about the cheques.
You know what I wanna talk about.

1675
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,480
I want you to sign these papers.

1676
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,359
You don't think I saw you tryin'
to slip out? I left three messages.

1677
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,988
Well, now wait a minute.
I didn't get no messages.

1678
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,827
Sonny, that judge told you
to sign the papers.

1679
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:44,167
- Don't you wanna be divorced for real?
- Yes, I do. I just... Well, I've been busy.

1680
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,129
Busy?! Doin' what? Makin' up excuses?

1681
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,255
Excuses?

1682
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,551
You got somebody now who sits up
all night cos you lost your keys?

1683
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:55,386
Or you got a flat tyre?

1684
00:25:55,511 --> 00:26:00,391
Comin' home at 6am, expectin' me
to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys.

1685
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:04,687
And cowgirls who didn't bother to look
like they hadn't been in your back seat!

1686
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:07,648
Charlotta, yoo-hoo,
you got a mean memory.

1687
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,193
- Just a couple of parties...
- A couple?!

1688
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,029
That light-up suit
musta given you shock treatment!

1689
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>I'm talkin' a lot of parties,
and a lot of back seats!</i>

1690
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,701
But for back seats, we'd never have met.

1691
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,079
And I'll bet you're still doin' it.

1692
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,748
Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out.

1693
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,668
You're just walkin' around
to save funeral expenses.

1694
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,797
You smile, babe. You get my insurance.

1695
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,343
Do you know what your skeleton looks like
in them x-ray pictures? A junkyard.

1696
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,513
You couldn't get through
a metal detector stark naked.

1697
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,640
Give me the papers.

1698
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,141
Huh?

1699
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,519
Give me the papers.

1700
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,231
- For real?
- Give me them.

1701
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,579
You look like hell.

1702
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,791
Well, you look great.

1703
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,838
Hey. Would you come up to my room?

1704
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:16,092
I can't. You just know what'd happen.

1705
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,094
Yeah.

1706
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,805
Besides, I got somebody
who really likes me now.

1707
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,266
Well, it's not hard to do.

1708
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,353
- Who's the lucky fella?
- Billy-Roy Fix.

1709
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,023
Billy-Roy Fix?

1710
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,192
Is that right?

1711
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,154
I guess there's just somethin'
about us Western stars.

1712
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,410
<i>- (PA) Mr Sonny Steele, please report...
- Oop, that's me. I'm late.</i>

1713
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,332
Goodbye, darlin'.

1714
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,421
Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh?

1715
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:22,408
<i>(# "Disco Magic")</i>

1716
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,996
Well, Mr Steele.

1717
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,837
After this number,
the motorcycle daredevils - God save us.

1718
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:19,381
And then you and the horse.

1719
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:43,072
Now, listen. You don't start those things
until I give you the cue, yes?

1720
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,593
Not now.

1721
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:07,179
Not now! Not now!

1722
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,081
Open the curtain.

1723
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:12,119
Forget the routine! Go right to the finale!

1724
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:15,789
That was very effective.
This is no criticism, you understand...

1725
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:18,667
...but it's too dangerous
to use that horse on a ramp.

1726
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:20,711
He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp!

1727
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:25,758
He wasn't even supposed to be out there
yet! He's ruined the whole concept!

1728
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:38,187
<i># I gotta run to keep from hidin'</i>

1729
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:43,067
<i># And I'm bound to keep on ridin'</i>

1730
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:49,031
<i># And I got one more silver dollar</i>

1731
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:51,200

1732
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:57,164
<i># No, I ain't gonna let 'em catch
the midnight rider</i>

1733
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,830
- What did he say?
- He was rude. He was very rude!

1734
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:41,333
- And he wasn't concentrating.
- He must've said something to you.

1735
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,337
Well, he was askin' about
the horse's tendon, and the drugs.

1736
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,133
Drugs? What drugs?

1737
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,928
- Well, the tranquillisers and...
- That's done all the time.

1738
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,430
They tranquillise the animal
to keep it calm.

1739
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,684
And the Butazolidin
they use for the... tendon.

1740
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,562
Mutual Indemnity and the police.
Which do you want?

1741
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:04,940
- Neither. I wanna keep this quiet.
- You may as well know the rest.

1742
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:10,154
Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed
we've used steroids to muscle him up.

1743
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,906
Well, are they dangerous?

1744
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:15,993
Well, they make the horse sterile.

1745
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:20,664
Well, temporarily. I mean, it's just
a side effect. It's not a permanent thing.

1746
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:23,292
Do we put that on the box top,
"Temporary"?

1747
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:28,046
- It goes away in, what, how many hours?
- Gentlemen, would you excuse us?

1748
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:31,592
- There are drinks upstairs.
- Ah, the world of illusion.

1749
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:32,718
<i>(knocking)</i>

1750
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,262
Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out.

1751
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,431
Jesus...

1752
00:33:39,975 --> 00:33:44,021
We're not talking about a horse,
we're talking about a $300 million merger.

1753
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:46,273
Omnibank will make a feast out of this.

1754
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,902
If Steele talks to anyone before
he's caught, we have no merger.

1755
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,404
Ampco and the horse are the same thing.

1756
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:56,033
If we've mismanaged the horse,
we've mismanaged the corporation.

1757
00:33:56,158 --> 00:34:00,245
- Couldn't he have called the SPCA?
- What'll we say to the reporters?

1758
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,290
- Tell 'em to go to bed.
- It's a little late for that.

1759
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,876
And get those morons out of here.

1760
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:09,379
- Come on, Bob.
- One drunken cowboy!

1761
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,528
We have been advised
by the attorney general...

1762
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,324
...that the theft of Rising Star
is grand larceny, a felony.

1763
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:42,788
Should this prove to be a deliberate act,
a warrant will be issued for Mr Steele.

1764
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:47,000
At this time, however, our primary concern
is the welfare of our horse.

1765
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,462
What did he say to Sears?
They were really goin' at each other.

1766
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,631
Hallie, give me a break, will ya?

1767
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:56,510
<i>- Ransom. What about ransom?
- The man's not that crazy.</i>

1768
00:34:56,635 --> 00:35:00,972
He's been tossed on his head enough
times. Thought about brain damage?

1769
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:05,519
The cowboy is a little hot-tempered.
He's emotionally disturbed, that's all.

1770
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:10,399
Come on, Fitz. He's made a mistake
and he'll bring it back when he cools out?

1771
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:13,235
- Oh, come on.
- Look, let me alone, will ya?

1772
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,153
I don't know any answers.

1773
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,198
I don't know from brain damage,
from cooling out...

1774
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:22,369
<i>Look, why don't you go have a sauna?
Give me some good news, for chrissake!</i>

1775
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:24,704
"Cool... out."

1776
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:37,092
<i>...these days.</i>

1777
00:35:37,217 --> 00:35:40,429
<i>- (Hallie) Why'd she quit him?
- (Wendell) Who knows?</i>

1778
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,597
<i>(winds tape)</i>

1779
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:47,561
<i>Sonny was married in Gus's living room.
And when that woman quit him,...</i>

1780
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:50,105
<i>...well, you know
where Sonny came to cool out.</i>

1781
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,316
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old
and strange these da...</i>

1782
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:58,822
<i>...well, you know
where Sonny came to cool out.</i>

1783
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:01,616
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old
and strange these days.</i>

1784
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:27,142
Seen Wendell?

1785
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:31,605
No. I haven't seen nobody. They're just
runnin' round like crazy people today.

1786
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,026
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit.

1787
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:41,448
Hey, tell me somethin'. Somethin'
personal. Were you surprised he did it?

1788
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,617
Who, Sonny?

1789
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:47,454
Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. Just some
surprises are bigger than others.

1790
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,999
Like he gave me this ring one day,
just like that.

1791
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:53,627
Had old Wendell's teeth
fixed for him, too.

1792
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:56,630
- What's your last name?
- Smitley.

1793
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,424
Say, you know something?
We got a mutual friend.

1794
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:03,053
- Oh, we do? Well, who do we know?
- Gus Atwater.

1795
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,015
I know Gus. Do you know Gus?
Where do you know Gus from?

1796
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,228
Oh, sure. Wait, are we talkin' about
the same Gus, from, uh, Tuba City?

1797
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:17,317
No, not Tuba City. No, the Gus I mean
is from Mesquite, about 30 miles up here.

1798
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:18,360
Mesquite.

1799
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,670
You wanna drive?

1800
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,158
Morning.

1801
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:09,327
Hello.

1802
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:14,999
- You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves?
- You must be a Capricorn.

1803
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,215
- You got any eucalyptus leaves?
- Just tea bags.

1804
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,385
- Well, I need some of them tea bags.
- How many would you like?

1805
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,053
Oh, five or six dozen.

1806
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:29,389
- Bags?
- Boxes.

1807
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:35,895
Come on, boy. Come on, son.

1808
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:41,568
Just a couple more times of doin' this
and you'll be breathin' just fine.

1809
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:43,778
<i>If I live.</i>

1810
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:47,157
<i>(coughs)</i>

1811
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:10,430
- Mr Atwater?
- # Golden hills

1812
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:12,765
# Round her head

1813
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:17,061
# Glimmer golden hills

1814
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,107
Mr Atwater?

1815
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:23,276
You wounded?

1816
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:26,863
- No, I'm looking for a friend of ours.
- He ain't here.

1817
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,741
- But he was.
- Yep.

1818
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:33,161
From about this high.

1819
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:38,625
- Was he here today?
- Here today, gone tomorrow.

1820
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,044
Like a flutterin' bird.

1821
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:45,924
- Hey, hey, who are you?
- I work for television.

1822
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:49,344
- You know television?
- Yeah. I got one.

1823
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:53,348
Works sometimes. Comes a-flashin'.

1824
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:56,851
<i>Woo-woo-woo-woo! (chuckles)</i>

1825
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:01,522
- Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's.
- Leroy! Oh-ho!

1826
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:05,276
Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell.

1827
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:08,947
They told me you'd know
where to find him.

1828
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:14,035
How else would I know
where you were? Huh?

1829
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:19,082
We're real worried about him.

1830
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,584
I gotta find him. I have to talk to him.

1831
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:25,588
I can't hurt him.

1832
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:29,300
He came here. Covered with a mist.

1833
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:33,763
You know? Like floats atop a river?

1834
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:38,768
And... and it grows into a cloud...

1835
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:43,022
...and it shuts away the sun...

1836
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,068
Where'd he go, Gus?

1837
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:54,450
- No, please!
- What?! How did you find me?

1838
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:57,370
- What are you doing?
- You're hurting me! Stop it!

1839
00:40:57,495 --> 00:40:58,997
- Who's with you?
- I'm alone.

1840
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:00,998
- How did you find me?
- I swear to God...

1841
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:03,543
- How did you get here?
- I drove myself.

1842
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:05,670
How? How did you find me?

1843
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:08,715
Gus.

1844
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:12,051
Gus Atwater.

1845
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:14,220
Gus?

1846
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:20,435
Gus.

1847
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,020
Can I... can I get up now?

1848
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:25,940
Please?

1849
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:28,443
How did you know to get to Gus?

1850
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:33,906
I... interviewed your friends.

1851
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:37,118
Who?

1852
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:40,204
Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd...

1853
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:45,126
Wait a minute, you hit my face,
you son of bitch!

1854
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:48,004
I'm not gonna stay here.

1855
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:55,595
What did you take the horse for?

1856
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:57,972
You're crazy.

1857
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:03,394
- Does anybody else know about Gus?
- No. No. And nobody knows anything...

1858
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,566
<i>Oh, I'm crazy? You go off with somebody
else's $12 million horse, and I'm crazy?!</i>

1859
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,568
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't you hit me!

1860
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:12,737
- Did you scare that old man?
- No.

1861
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:15,698
Does anybody else know you're here?

1862
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:21,162
No. Nobody knows anything. I don't have
any reason to tell anybody anything.

1863
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:23,789
Go away. Go home.

1864
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:29,670
<i>Well, what are you gonna do with him?</i>

1865
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:37,470
Look, just tell me why you took the horse.
You can't race him. You can't sell him.

1866
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:41,307
And you're not gonna start
your own cereal company.

1867
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:45,561
<i>I mean, what the hell do you want?</i>

1868
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:51,734
Oh, can't you just answer one question?

1869
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,864
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I don't usually get hit doing this, but...

1870
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:59,617
What do you expect,
sneakin' up like some cat?

1871
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:02,578
I tried to call, but your line was busy.

1872
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:11,545
Do you know how worried your friends are
about you? Wendell and Leroy?

1873
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:16,133
Isn't there something I can tell them?

1874
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:22,473
What is this place?
Does this have special meaning to you?

1875
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:25,393
You want information, go to the library.

1876
00:43:26,102 --> 00:43:29,397
I know what you want. It ain't answers.

1877
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:33,526
You just want a story. Any story.
Why don't you make one up?

1878
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:37,655
That's what you all do anyway.
You don't need me to tell you no story.

1879
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,701
You ask me why I'm 45 minutes late.
You're not interested in why I'm late.

1880
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:46,038
Just in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat
Ranch Breakfast?" Who the hell cares?

1881
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:48,708
Honest to hell, you people
are all the same.

1882
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:51,210
There's folks in Africa,
or some damn place...

1883
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:53,879
...you try to take a picture of them,
they'll kill ya.

1884
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:57,883
They figure you're takin' somethin' from
them, and you just got so much stuff...

1885
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:00,636
...and if other people take it all
you got nothin' left.

1886
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:03,389
Well, I don't wanna be no story.

1887
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:09,729
- I've just retired from public life.
- Boy, have you got that wrong.

1888
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:13,733
You rode down the Las Vegas Strip
with somebody else's $12 million horse.

1889
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:17,319
Did you think we wouldn't notice?
You're a story all right.

1890
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:19,739
But not yours.

1891
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:27,204
I'm nobody's story but my own now.

1892
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:33,085
But... Wait, wait a minute...
Where are you going?

1893
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:37,298
Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I?

1894
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:42,511
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Was it something I said?

1895
00:44:43,053 --> 00:44:45,639
Look, can't you just do
a working girl a favour?

1896
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:49,310
I'm just trying to earn an honest buck,
tell an honest tale.

1897
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:52,480
I don't want to make up
a story about you.

1898
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:54,982
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

1899
00:44:55,107 --> 00:44:58,944
Everybody's wondering where you're going,
why you did it.

1900
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:02,698
The great American cowboy
and the world-champion horse...

1901
00:45:02,823 --> 00:45:04,241
...riding into the sunset...

1902
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:08,329
Boy, are you full of shit.
With all due respect, ma'am.

1903
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:11,874
- And you're standin' in poison sumac.
- Oh!

1904
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,545
Come on, son. Come on, boy.

1905
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:23,260
If you think you're gettin' away from me
you're not, cos I'm gonna follow you.

1906
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:28,265
I'm gonna follow you till you tell me
what you're gonna do with the horse.

1907
00:45:32,144 --> 00:45:34,396
What are you doing?

1908
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:37,316
Oh, my God!

1909
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:41,362
Now it shouldn't take you more
than about 15 minutes to change that.

1910
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:45,449
Goddamn you! You're nuts! I'm gonna call
the cops. I got your license plate.

1911
00:45:45,574 --> 00:45:46,909
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

1912
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:51,580
No, you won't. I know what you'll do.
You'll milk this story for all it's worth.

1913
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:56,752
You don't want me to be captured.
A captured horse thief ain't no story.

1914
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:04,885
It was from this hotel that Rising Star,
greatest money-winner in racing history...

1915
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,806
...and corporate symbol for one
of the world's largest conglomerates...

1916
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,016
...was taken late Friday night.

1917
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:15,521
Yesterday I uncovered information
which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele.

1918
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:19,191
<i>(Mr Magoo on TV) Now to raise
the old Stars and Stripes.</i>

1919
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:21,860
<i>Where's that blasted flagpole?</i>

1920
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:24,697
<i>Good gracious! A bird's nest!</i>

1921
00:46:25,197 --> 00:46:29,576
<i>How clumsy of me. I hope
I didn't step on your eggs, birdie.</i>

1922
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:33,122
You got any shoelaces?

1923
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:35,958
- What?
- Shoelaces?

1924
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:41,505
Anita, get rid of that stuff.
Over here by the cash register.

1925
00:46:42,464 --> 00:46:45,467
<i>By the dim glow of a shrouded campfire...</i>

1926
00:46:45,592 --> 00:46:49,763
<i>...I saw Rising Star,
and I encountered Sonny Steele himself.</i>

1927
00:46:49,888 --> 00:46:51,056
- What?
- What?

1928
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:53,392
<i>- We talked for many hours.
- What?!</i>

1929
00:46:53,517 --> 00:46:58,147
<i>As a result of our wide-ranging
conversation, I formed these impressions:</i>

1930
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:03,694
<i>Mr Steele, in my opinion,
did not take the horse for monetary gain...</i>

1931
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,363
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1932
00:47:07,114 --> 00:47:09,366
- Where was he?
- I forgot.

1933
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:13,162
- How were you able to find him?
- That's my job.

1934
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:15,581
- What did he tell you, Hallie?
- Nothing.

1935
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:20,794
Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could
put you right in the middle of the story.

1936
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,090
We could guarantee
that you get first crack at everything.

1937
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:28,052
I've already had first crack at everything.

1938
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:30,554
Suppose we made it exclusive?

1939
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,516
How about if we gave you
exclusive footage on the capture?

1940
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:37,019
Oh, when are you planning that?

1941
00:47:37,144 --> 00:47:42,191
Wanna tell me about that confrontation
with Steele at the reception, Mr Sears?

1942
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:46,653
- Miss Martin, we could take you to court.
- You could try.

1943
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:51,408
Aiding a felon during the commission of
a felonious act, concealment of a felony...

1944
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:53,994
"Misprision of felony", the law calls it.

1945
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,373
You're not the law. If Ampco wants to take
on the First Amendment, be my guest.

1946
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:01,418
That oughta sell
a whole lot of breakfast cereal.

1947
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:05,214
I'll be around,
if you wanna handcuff me later.

1948
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:14,640
<i>- We could take her to court.
- Have her locked up.</i>

1949
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:17,810
And gain what? The last thing
we need is a female martyr.

1950
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:21,021
At least he didn't say anything
about mistreating the horse.

1951
00:48:21,146 --> 00:48:23,857
- Do we know that?
- I think she'd have said something.

1952
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:27,236
You "think". It's a chance
we can't afford to take.

1953
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:30,656
Do we have a choice?

1954
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:35,327
We could make sure that if he speaks
to anyone he won't be believed.

1955
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,372
Can you get to the media
by the 11 o'clock news?

1956
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:52,135
How the hell did she find him,
we ain't even heard from him?

1957
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:55,013
We sent her over there,
that's how she found him.

1958
00:48:55,138 --> 00:49:00,143
Well, she buddied up to me. She tried
to buy me drinks, said she liked my ring...

1959
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:03,689
She liked your ring, she liked
my watch, I liked her eyes...

1960
00:49:03,814 --> 00:49:08,151
That's how those people are. They tell
you they're your friend, and they use you.

1961
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:10,195
Well, what are we gonna do?

1962
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,156
I don't know about you.
I'm gonna get a bottle of tequila...

1963
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:18,203
...one of those keno girls that can suck the
chrome off a trailer hitch, and kick back.

1964
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:23,166
<i>10.59 here at KLSG in St George,
and here's Harvey Del Rio...</i>

1965
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:27,879
If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep
standin', boy, we'd have this licked.

1966
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:33,635
<i>In Las Vegas, investigators still have no
leads to the whereabouts of Rising Star,...</i>

1967
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,014
<i>...whose ab duction by Sonny Steele
triggered a massive search.</i>

1968
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:40,559
<i>Ampco officials are expressing alarm
over the welfare of the horse.</i>

1969
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:44,730
<i>According to one, Steele has a long history
of alcoholism and drug abuse.</i>

1970
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:48,859
<i>He's appeared in public in an intoxicated
state on several occasions,...</i>

1971
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:51,361
<i>...and has been abusive
to press and public.</i>

1972
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:54,823
<i>They believe if the horse is to survive,
time is of the essence.</i>

1973
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:16,636
Excuse me, Miss Martin?
I'm Charlotta Steele.

1974
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:21,349
- I was married to Sonny.
- Yes, I know.

1975
00:50:21,475 --> 00:50:25,312
I don't mean to bother you, but
I was just wonderin' if he was all right.

1976
00:50:25,437 --> 00:50:28,523
- He isn't hurt?
- No.

1977
00:50:29,816 --> 00:50:35,655
- Are you gonna be seein' him again?
- Well, we haven't made any plans. Why?

1978
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:38,366
Just wonderin'.

1979
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,454
- Why do you think he did it?
- I don't know.

1980
00:50:44,581 --> 00:50:50,420
He gets ornery. Guess it takes him a long
time to admit he's got a horn in his gut.

1981
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:54,257
<i>What is the horn in his gut, Mrs Steele?</i>

1982
00:50:56,218 --> 00:51:00,055
All's I know is he musta had a good
reason, or he woulda been back by now.

1983
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,518
He's no thief by nature.
I mean, it takes your breath!

1984
00:51:08,063 --> 00:51:11,066
You know, they only said
those bad things about him.

1985
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:15,362
They didn't say what's decent. Even
though it is hard to find it sometimes.

1986
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:17,531
How'd you meet Sonny?

1987
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:28,250
Hallie Martin, please.

1988
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,003
<i>(rings)</i>

1989
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:40,178
<i>- What?
- You alone?</i>

1990
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:43,765
- Who is this?
- Are you alone?

1991
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:47,269
OK, fella, say your dirties. Get it over with.

1992
00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:50,730
It's time for another
wide-rangin' conversation.

1993
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:55,861
<i>- Hello?
- Is it you?</i>

1994
00:51:55,986 --> 00:51:58,655
Right from the dim glow
of the shrouded campfire.

1995
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,781
<i>You maniac!</i>

1996
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:02,200
I broke three nails changing that tyre.

1997
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,203
- You want a story?
- Yes.

1998
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:11,001
- Can you leave without anybody knowin'?
- If I can't, I won't come.

1999
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:16,131
- Who saw him?
- Some little shopkeeper in Utah.

2000
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:19,843
Near St George, about five last night.
He must've gotten a vehicle.

2001
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:25,348
So if he stopped for the night he should
be within 150 miles of St George.

2002
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:28,184
- Who knows this?
- The local police are taken care of.

2003
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,645
- The press?
- No, not yet, not yet.

2004
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,274
- We'll take care of it.
- Can we cover the surrounding towns?

2005
00:52:34,399 --> 00:52:37,652
Taking care of it now. We'll concentrate
on Liberty and Cedarville.

2006
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:42,115
You and Toland take the jet.
You can organise this from St George.

2007
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,201
- If he stopped for the night.
- He must sleep sometimes.

2008
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:47,829
He crossed the state line.
The FBI will want in.

2009
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:51,708
- Can you keep 'em out?
- They already know he's been spotted.

2010
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:57,047
Then get to him first. Tell him we won't
prosecute. Do whatever you have to do.

2011
00:52:57,172 --> 00:52:59,549
Just don't let him start up
about the horse.

2012
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,682
I'm here!

2013
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:13,355
Hey, I'm here!

2014
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,774
I'm alone. No troops.

2015
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:25,116
Come on. Come on.

2016
00:53:32,499 --> 00:53:34,751
Oh... Oh, God!

2017
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:37,170
I think I've broken my leg.

2018
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,883
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

2019
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:02,153
Here. Get your camera ready.

2020
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,241
Uh...

2021
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:09,828
Listen, would you mind standing
over here with that background?

2022
00:54:09,953 --> 00:54:12,747
No, this is all right. Right here.

2023
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:15,625
But I think it'd be more dramatic
in front of...

2024
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:20,213
Tell 'em it was dramatic.
You got a colourful imagination.

2025
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:27,137
Listen, I've been driving all night,
and I'm not used to being talked to like...

2026
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:29,764
I'm not used to being called a horse thief.

2027
00:54:29,889 --> 00:54:33,351
<i>What do you call
a man who steals horses?</i>

2028
00:54:34,352 --> 00:54:37,188
Have you ever seen this horse race?

2029
00:54:38,523 --> 00:54:41,359
Have you ever seen... I've seen him run.

2030
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:47,866
I saw him stumble and fall back,
and lose his stride, and pick himself up.

2031
00:54:47,991 --> 00:54:51,119
<i>I saw him stretch out
when he had nothin' left to give...</i>

2032
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:54,163
...but he found it... somewhere.

2033
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,457
And he won.

2034
00:54:56,583 --> 00:55:00,461
Lady, that horse is a champion.
He's got a heart the size of a locomotive.

2035
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:05,633
He's got more heart, and more drive,
and more... soul...

2036
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:09,304
...than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.

2037
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:12,599
Trot him round with dancing girls,
ta-da-da-ta-ta!

2038
00:55:12,724 --> 00:55:17,729
They'd have him wearin' short pants and
smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!

2039
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:23,067
They got him tanked up on tranquillisers
and bute, stickin' him full of needles...

2040
00:55:23,192 --> 00:55:26,946
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up,
he's shot full of steroids...

2041
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:30,158
And it's just for looks.
Makes the horse sterile!

2042
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:32,785
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...

2043
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:38,708
Even if they wanted to breed him, pass on
some of them fine qualities, they couldn't.

2044
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:42,170
To say nothin' of what
the horse hisself is missin'.

2045
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:43,713
So...

2046
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:47,425
...so I took him.

2047
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:52,221
Come on, let's go. Get this...

2048
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:59,562
Let's crank up this little hummer
and I'll... give ya a speech. Or try.

2049
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:07,862
All right?

2050
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,784
Any time you're... Can you see me?
Can you see the horse?

2051
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:15,787
Yeah. Keep going. I can see everything.

2052
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:21,542
Uh, this here is Sonny Steele...

2053
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:25,338
...and, uh, his name is Risin' Star.

2054
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:28,841
And he's one of the best.

2055
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:36,140
He's one of the greatest animals
in the... in the history of... animals.

2056
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:04,460
Maybe they bought him.
Maybe they own him.

2057
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:08,923
But there's some rights you can't buy.
Even from an animal.

2058
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:16,472
Now, this horse earned a better life.
I'm gonna try and see that he gets it.

2059
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:27,859
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll do it.

2060
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:32,405
Appreciate your comin'.
You got stamina.

2061
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:36,659
- It's a family trait.
- You'll forgive me for not entertainin'.

2062
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:39,579
I gotta tend this horse
and get him movin'.

2063
00:57:39,704 --> 00:57:42,748
Listen, can I... can I come with you?

2064
00:57:42,874 --> 00:57:44,125
No!

2065
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:46,586
Why? I wouldn't be any...

2066
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:48,337
- Trouble?
- No.

2067
00:57:51,716 --> 00:57:55,553
- Well, here, let me give you my card.
- Your what?

2068
00:57:55,678 --> 00:58:01,392
Card. Sometimes you think of something
you forgot to say, or... wish you'd said.

2069
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:04,478
<i>Steele, what are you gonna do with him?</i>

2070
00:58:04,604 --> 00:58:07,773
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me anything.

2071
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:10,026
Enough.

2072
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:13,404
- Why does it have to be a big secret?
- So they can't stop me.

2073
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:15,740
From doing what?

2074
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,576
I'm gonna turn him loose.

2075
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,369
What?! Rising Star?

2076
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:24,290
I'm gonna get him back
to where he was, what he was.

2077
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:28,753
It's in his blood. He knows what to do.
He's just half forgot, is all.

2078
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:31,130
But he's a thoroughbred racehorse!

2079
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:34,759
Maybe it isn't gonna work, lady.
Maybe he ain't gonna make it...

2080
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:39,347
...but at least he's gonna try. He's gonna
have his own shot at it, that's all.

2081
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:43,184
- Where?
- Where? Have a safe trip back, miss.

2082
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:45,895
Miss, my ass!
Where will you do it? Do you know?

2083
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,272
- I know.
- Who else knows?

2084
00:58:48,397 --> 00:58:51,817
I don't know. Maybe he does.
Why don't you interview him?

2085
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:54,612
You know you're gonna
screw up your whole life?

2086
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:57,782
<i>Goddamnit, I'm trying to unscrew it, lady!</i>

2087
00:58:57,907 --> 00:59:02,578
- Wendell says you forgot your best part.
- Wendell? Oh, he's a good man, Wendell.

2088
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:04,330
- Is it true?
- Nope.

2089
00:59:04,455 --> 00:59:09,085
- Charlotta says you screw up...
- Charlotta? You got her in on this too?

2090
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,253
Don't tell me.

2091
00:59:11,754 --> 00:59:14,340
She says you take her breath away.

2092
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:20,471
Yeah, well, that's not hard to do.
She's all breath anyway.

2093
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:25,059
She's, uh, she's pretty.

2094
00:59:25,184 --> 00:59:27,645
Yes, she is pretty.

2095
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:32,191
She said that when you two
first met you... Oh...

2096
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:35,236
Wait, that canyon
where you went on your honeymoon...

2097
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:37,738
- Damn that woman.
- With wild mustangs.

2098
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:40,199
Goddamn that woman!

2099
00:59:40,408 --> 00:59:43,702
- Rim Rock. Rim Rock!
- That's why I left her.

2100
00:59:43,828 --> 00:59:47,581
That's exactly why I left her,
her and her big m... Or she left me.

2101
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:50,668
Anyway, I'm not goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon.

2102
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:55,923
I have an idea. Let's go into town,
have a cup of coffee, and talk about it.

2103
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:58,300
My treat.

2104
01:00:00,636 --> 01:00:02,430
- Huh?
- I'm not gonna be... No.

2105
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:07,768
I'm not gonna be passin' a...
Now where'd I put that son of a bitch?

2106
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:12,148
Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin'
a mailbox, so if you'd be...

2107
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:15,776
- It's got a stamp on it.
- Yeah, first one I pass.

2108
01:00:18,446 --> 01:00:20,489
Well...

2109
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:24,326
What do I do? Just take this road
back to the broken tree?

2110
01:00:24,452 --> 01:00:28,664
Yeah. Same way you came.
Only backwards.

2111
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:31,542
- Don't lose my card.
- Oh, no, it's... Goodbye.

2112
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:34,420
OK, good luck, wherever you're going.

2113
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:58,569
Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures.

2114
01:00:58,694 --> 01:01:02,364
And wait till you hear the talk.
People are gonna eat him up!

2115
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:06,285
Tell me an affiliate between here and
Vegas. I wanna get this on the cable.

2116
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,163
<i>Hold your horses... (laughs)
Hear that about horses?</i>

2117
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:13,125
Les, I am trying to convey a sense
of urgency. I want this on the air today.

2118
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,046
<i>OK. KLSG- TV in St George, Utah.
Looks like about 60 miles.</i>

2119
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:19,340
OK, now pay attention. This is crucial.

2120
01:01:19,465 --> 01:01:23,594
I need a camera crew to meet me at a
place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah.

2121
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:27,014
<i>- Try the Automobile Club or something.
- When do you need 'em?</i>

2122
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:31,810
They should leave right now, cos I don't
know when I'll get there or he'll get there.

2123
01:01:31,936 --> 01:01:34,021
And they should be prepared to camp out.

2124
01:01:34,146 --> 01:01:37,149
I have a feeling this place
does not have a Hilton Hotel.

2125
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:41,278
<i>I mean, this is a place
horses like, Les, and...</i>

2126
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:47,910
Les, when Steele gets there,
he's gonna turn Rising Star loose.

2127
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:49,119
<i>What?!</i>

2128
01:01:49,244 --> 01:01:53,582
$12 million worth of thoroughbred
racehorse, loose in horse heaven.

2129
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:55,376
Think you got a story?

2130
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:59,088
<i>Stick with the lunatic, Hallie.
Tape everything. This is gold!</i>

2131
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:02,883
<i>- He doesn't want me around.
- That never stopped you before.</i>

2132
01:02:03,008 --> 01:02:05,386
<i>Just find some way to talk to the guy.</i>

2133
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:10,099
Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew
and I'll talk to you later.

2134
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:34,957
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody rob a bank?

2135
01:02:35,082 --> 01:02:40,462
I don't know for sure. I think somebody
may have spotted that cereal cowboy.

2136
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:50,973
Hello?

2137
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:54,601
Hi. Listen, are you, uh...
are you going to St George?

2138
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:56,645
'Less they moved the road.

2139
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:13,454
- You're wearin' out your welcome, lady.
- There's a cop convention back there.

2140
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:15,497
- What?
- I saw two patrol cars...

2141
01:03:15,622 --> 01:03:18,667
...two motorcycle cops,
a county marshal and a sheriff.

2142
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:23,172
- You said nobody'd follow you.
- They didn't. An expert got me out.

2143
01:03:23,297 --> 01:03:25,299
Expert, huh?

2144
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:36,018
Hey.

2145
01:03:38,145 --> 01:03:41,482
- Wait a minute.
- Why? You wanna film the capture?

2146
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:43,567
I am in as much trouble as you are.

2147
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:47,738
If I go back I'll have to tell them
everything I know. And I mean everything.

2148
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:51,950
If I don't, I'll go to jail.
It's called misprision of felony.

2149
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,578
You go ahead and tell 'em.
I'll be long gone.

2150
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:59,166
I can't. Don't you understand? I can't
divulge sources and expect anybody...

2151
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,585
"Divulge sources"...? What are you doin'?

2152
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,712
- Besides...
- Wait a minute...

2153
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:06,381
Hey! Hold it!
What do you think you're doin'?

2154
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:09,218
I'd have to tell them about Gus.

2155
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:11,386
I would.

2156
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:35,244
Ohh! God!

2157
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:12,990
What are we gonna do?

2158
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:15,200
Get on the floor.

2159
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:18,036
- What?
- Do it. Get on the floor.

2160
01:05:22,457 --> 01:05:25,127
- Easy, boy.
- What are we doing?

2161
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:28,797
You stay right there. When I go
out the back, you count to 60.

2162
01:05:28,922 --> 01:05:31,633
- Out the back...?
- Then drive the hell outta here.

2163
01:05:31,758 --> 01:05:34,803
- The cops'll chase me.
- You're crazy!

2164
01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:38,140
Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls.

2165
01:05:38,265 --> 01:05:41,476
There's a lake there
at the bottom of some dry red cliffs.

2166
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:44,604
- Well, where is Cisco Falls?
- Find it. You found me.

2167
01:05:45,439 --> 01:05:48,984
But, no, listen... You can't...
You can't make it out there.

2168
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:52,237
- There's at least dozen cops!
- That'll be up to him.

2169
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:56,783
OK now, junkie, no excuses. Tendon's
gone down, you ain't wheezin' any more...

2170
01:05:56,908 --> 01:05:59,786
...and, goddamn, I've seen you run.
Let's go.

2171
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:02,164
No, wait! You can't...

2172
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:16,970
That's him!

2173
01:07:31,878 --> 01:07:34,798
...28, 29, 30...

2174
01:08:07,038 --> 01:08:08,790
...58, 59, 60.

2175
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:34,858
He's in Bundy's Field.

2176
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:37,694
<i>- We can't follow him.
- Ten-four.</i>

2177
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:52,709
He's headin' for the dam.

2178
01:09:22,113 --> 01:09:24,616
Come on, come on! Do it! Do it!

2179
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:31,039
Go! Go!

2180
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:53,853
Come on! Come on! Go!

2181
01:09:56,898 --> 01:09:59,275
All the way! Go! Go!

2182
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:20,547
For chrissake, look out!

2183
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,658
Oh, jeez!

2184
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:01,629
<i>- How did he get away?
- On a horse.</i>

2185
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:03,589
<i>On a horse. Find him.</i>

2186
01:11:03,715 --> 01:11:06,050
Bring him back here.

2187
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:10,388
Use the FBI. Use the state police.
Use helicopters.

2188
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:12,724
Put out a reward - a large one.

2189
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:16,269
Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines.
Where is he, Utah?

2190
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:20,815
Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Have them sing him in. But get him!

2191
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:24,902
<i>(scraping)</i>

2192
01:11:25,028 --> 01:11:27,071
Hello?

2193
01:11:27,864 --> 01:11:29,907
Hello?

2194
01:11:30,867 --> 01:11:33,745
Oh, you made it! You made it!

2195
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:38,541
Hey. There's some witch hazel
in the cabinet over the sink...

2196
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:41,627
...and there's an old T-shirt by the bunk.

2197
01:12:00,646 --> 01:12:03,107
I owe you one, buddy.

2198
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:07,195
Is he all right?

2199
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,946
Easy.

2200
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:12,366
They didn't chase me. You were right.

2201
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:15,787
You should've seen yourself.
You were great.

2202
01:12:17,038 --> 01:12:19,081
You were.

2203
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:29,634
Were you surprised that I got here?

2204
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:31,385
No.

2205
01:12:32,136 --> 01:12:36,724
It was on the road map. I didn't even
need to ask anybody or anything.

2206
01:12:38,518 --> 01:12:40,269
Easy, boy.

2207
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,941
It's gonna be getting dark soon.

2208
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,611
How long does it take
to drive to Rim Rock Canyon?

2209
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:51,948
Few days. Only we ain't drivin'.

2210
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:53,282
What?

2211
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:57,328
Cops'll be lookin' everywhere
for that camper. We'll have to leave it.

2212
01:12:57,829 --> 01:13:00,289
- And do what?
- Walk.

2213
01:13:01,415 --> 01:13:04,835
<i>(Sonny) I've seen him run.
I saw him stumble and fall back,...</i>

2214
01:13:04,961 --> 01:13:07,463
<i>...lose his stride, and pick himself up.
- You bet!</i>

2215
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:11,592
<i>He had nothin' left to give,
but he found it... somewhere.</i>

2216
01:13:11,717 --> 01:13:17,056
<i>...and more drive, and more... soul
than most people you'll ever know.</i>

2217
01:13:17,181 --> 01:13:19,100
<i>And they hang lights on him.</i>

2218
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:22,436
<i>Trot him round with dancing girls,
ta-da-da-ta-ta!</i>

2219
01:13:22,562 --> 01:13:26,941
<i>They'd have him wearin' short pants and
smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!</i>

2220
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:30,570
<i>...stickin' him full of needles...
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up.</i>

2221
01:13:30,695 --> 01:13:34,156
<i>He's shot full of steroids...
And it's just for looks. Makes him sterile!</i>

2222
01:13:34,282 --> 01:13:36,659
<i>So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...</i>

2223
01:13:36,784 --> 01:13:40,037
<i>Even if they wanted to pass on
them fine qualities, they couldn't.</i>

2224
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:44,875
<i>(Hallie) I could tape a bit along the way.
Nothing that'll give away where we are.</i>

2225
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:49,255
And maybe I could find someone that
could take it to the network, like today.

2226
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:53,593
And since you figure it's gonna be
a long trip, that would give us...

2227
01:13:53,718 --> 01:13:55,761
Oh, no, I'm not hungry, thanks.

2228
01:13:55,886 --> 01:14:00,266
That would give us, what,
maybe four or five more days on news.

2229
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:05,646
That way, once you set Rising Star free,
the whole country will be behind you.

2230
01:14:06,564 --> 01:14:10,234
Then I'd just have to keep
lookin' back over my shoulder.

2231
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:11,944
<i>(Hallie laughs)</i>

2232
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:14,822
- What's so funny?
- Do you want to go to jail?

2233
01:14:14,947 --> 01:14:15,656
No.

2234
01:14:15,781 --> 01:14:18,576
Well, how do you think
this is gonna end up?

2235
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:22,246
Not on television.

2236
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:36,385
OK, I, uh... respect your position.

2237
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:40,473
I do. I don't understand it,
but I respect it.

2238
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:44,310
A lot of famous people hated publicity.

2239
01:14:44,727 --> 01:14:47,104
Albert Schweitzer, Franco...

2240
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:51,859
Albert Schweitzer... Um...

2241
01:15:06,832 --> 01:15:09,085
How you doin', partner?

2242
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:17,676
- Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.
- You didn't.

2243
01:15:23,682 --> 01:15:25,476
What are we... doing?

2244
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:27,645
Going to sleep.

2245
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:31,482
- I'm not sleepy.
- You weren't hungry, either.

2246
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:35,277
It's gonna be a long way, lady. Long way.

2247
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:40,324
Well, um... where am I supposed to...?

2248
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:42,701
Wherever you want.

2249
01:15:57,174 --> 01:16:01,095
Where the hell are we,
the Donner Pass, for God's sakes?

2250
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:08,894
I'm ready.

2251
01:16:09,019 --> 01:16:11,689
I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus.

2252
01:16:12,398 --> 01:16:16,735
When they spot that camper
they're gonna trace it right to him.

2253
01:16:16,861 --> 01:16:19,363
What... what are you doin' with that?

2254
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:22,658
This is expensive equipment,
and I'm responsible for it.

2255
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:26,328
- I'm not gonna leave it there.
- We're walkin'. With our feet.

2256
01:16:26,453 --> 01:16:29,290
There's no escalators out here,
or bellhops.

2257
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:32,501
- Uh...
- Oh, no. He ain't carryin' it.

2258
01:16:32,626 --> 01:16:35,337
- I didn't ask.
- And I ain't carryin' it, and you can't.

2259
01:16:35,462 --> 01:16:37,506
I've carried this stuff a lot of times.

2260
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:43,053
Where? Up the escalator at Bloomington's,
or Bloomingberg's, or wherever it is?

2261
01:16:43,178 --> 01:16:47,099
Bloomingdale's. And what the hell
do you know about New York?

2262
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:50,060
Ever hear of the Madison Square Gardens?

2263
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:50,894
No.

2264
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,857
They got a rodeo there, and it's
a damn big thing. And I've been in it.

2265
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:57,651
Well, I've been to the rodeo. Twice.

2266
01:17:01,655 --> 01:17:03,866
Did you stay
for the rattlesnake roundup?

2267
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:06,452
Yes. I stayed right to the end.
I saw the whole thing.

2268
01:17:06,577 --> 01:17:10,205
They don't have one. How are you
gonna round up a rattlesnake?

2269
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:14,543
Oh, God. I'm just trying to be pleasant.
You get so worked up about everything.

2270
01:17:14,668 --> 01:17:18,172
What have I got to be worked up about?
I've only got a stole horse...

2271
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:23,218
...everybody but the Coast Guard after me,
and now I'm carryin' a crazy woman...

2272
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:28,599
...wearin' shoes from Bloomingberg's, that
thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup.

2273
01:17:31,018 --> 01:17:34,480
Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it.
Only it ain't goin' on my horse.

2274
01:17:34,605 --> 01:17:36,940
Your horse(!)

2275
01:17:43,614 --> 01:17:47,326
Ahh... Here, give me
those glasses, would you?

2276
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:49,828
They're prescription.

2277
01:17:50,454 --> 01:17:53,707
You wait here with him
till I get back, ya hear?

2278
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,877
But if you're spotted
and you don't come back...

2279
01:17:57,002 --> 01:17:58,879
Call your lawyer.

2280
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:07,262
Hello. Can I help you?

2281
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:09,515
Howdy. Uh...

2282
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:15,938
Well, uh, I'm broke down the road apiece,
and I wondered if I could use your phone...

2283
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:21,360
I got a friend in Mesquite, and he's in
a bit of trouble, so I need to use a phone.

2284
01:18:21,485 --> 01:18:25,656
I'd be obliged if I could use yours.
Happy to pay you for it.

2285
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:30,327
- We got a phone. Come on in.
- Oh. Great. Appreci... Appreciate it.

2286
01:18:32,412 --> 01:18:35,290
Phone's right there. You help yourself.

2287
01:18:37,209 --> 01:18:39,253
Thank you.

2288
01:19:04,111 --> 01:19:06,780
<i>- Hello?
- Gus, it's Sonny.</i>

2289
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:07,948
Sonny!

2290
01:19:08,073 --> 01:19:10,784
I gotta talk to you.
I can't talk long. Now listen...

2291
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:13,704
<i>- Sonny!
- Gus, please, just listen real careful.</i>

2292
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:17,124
<i>- I'm in the kitchen.
- People are gonna come, probably police.</i>

2293
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:21,128
They're gonna ask you about the camper.
I want you to tell 'em I stole it.

2294
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:23,881
Say it, Gus. "Sonny stole the camper."

2295
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:26,925
My Wild Blue Yonder? I bought it in Elko.

2296
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:31,346
No, Gus. I bought it for you, remember?
And I'll buy you a nice new one.

2297
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:35,726
When the people ask about the camper,
tell them "Sonny stole the camper."

2298
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:38,812
Try to remember it.
I'll see ya, friend. I gotta go.

2299
01:19:42,566 --> 01:19:44,484
Oh, uh...

2300
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,863
Partner, I'm much obliged
for the use of that phone.

2301
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:50,699
Here. Five oughta cover it.

2302
01:19:50,824 --> 01:19:52,868
Mr Steele...

2303
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:58,749
...I don't want your money.

2304
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:01,418
I saw you on the television.
You and the horse.

2305
01:20:01,543 --> 01:20:05,088
I want you to know
I'd be proud to help you any way I can.

2306
01:20:05,213 --> 01:20:09,217
Right now, it looks like
we oughta get you out of this county.

2307
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:23,106
How do you like it so far?

2308
01:20:34,534 --> 01:20:37,162
Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good?

2309
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:41,416
Doin' all right. Got the whole world
lookin' for that cowboy.

2310
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:46,338
He's probably over that mountain by now.
I'd go take a nap on my porch.

2311
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:49,508
I wouldn't wanna find him anyway -
except for that reward.

2312
01:20:49,883 --> 01:20:52,177
50,000 bucks is a mound of cash.

2313
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,931
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

2314
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:45,856
All right, you're clear. Come on down.

2315
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:06,126
I don't know where you're headed, but
Escalante's six miles over that mountain.

2316
01:22:06,251 --> 01:22:11,631
The woman put together some stuff -
bread and cake and stew and coffee.

2317
01:22:11,756 --> 01:22:14,259
I put a bottle in there
to keep your blood pumpin'.

2318
01:22:14,384 --> 01:22:16,553
- I sure do thank you.
- Ain't no need to.

2319
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:21,057
Listen, there's not many people
you'd trust $50,000 worth.

2320
01:22:21,892 --> 01:22:26,313
You better get on over the mountain
'fore it comes to me what I'm passin' up.

2321
01:22:28,481 --> 01:22:30,525
Come on.

2322
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:35,989
Oh, my God!

2323
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:41,369
- Can we rest a little?
- Not yet.

2324
01:22:42,621 --> 01:22:47,000
- Where the hell are we?
- Well, not in jail, look at it that way.

2325
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:51,087
- I can't go any farther.
- Oh, sure you can.

2326
01:22:51,212 --> 01:22:57,052
Hell, I've known people go through stuff.
I knew a guy... misjudged a Brahma once.

2327
01:22:57,177 --> 01:23:02,098
Put his rib through his right lung,
the guy could hardly breathe...

2328
01:23:02,766 --> 01:23:06,186
He still got up and rode
the rankest mare there.

2329
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:12,942
I will never understand why you find
that kind of behaviour admirable.

2330
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:16,696
- Gets you up the hill.
- I have to rest... for a minute.

2331
01:23:18,948 --> 01:23:21,076
Hey, Steele?

2332
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:23,119
Sonny?

2333
01:23:23,244 --> 01:23:25,789
Norman!

2334
01:23:29,918 --> 01:23:32,253
How do you know "Norman"?

2335
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:35,256
I never divulge sources.

2336
01:23:36,633 --> 01:23:40,345
"Divulge sources"..."Divulge sources"...

2337
01:23:41,846 --> 01:23:45,975
Here, get up. Come on.
You sure do your homework, don't you?

2338
01:23:49,562 --> 01:23:52,899
Try to put your mind on somethin' else,
make things easier.

2339
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,819
Get it off your feet.

2340
01:23:57,195 --> 01:23:59,280
Do you know "The Star-Spangled Banner"?

2341
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:01,408
- What?!
- The national anthem?

2342
01:24:01,533 --> 01:24:06,287
I know it's the national anthem.
You mean can I sing it? It's hard to sing.

2343
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:09,290
Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is?

2344
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:14,212
Hey, that's a very interesting question.
Why don't we sit down and discuss it?

2345
01:24:14,337 --> 01:24:16,840
I used to be a psychology major.

2346
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:20,301
"America the Beautiful",
that's an easy tune to carry.

2347
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:23,221
Why don't we sit down
and sing it together?

2348
01:24:23,346 --> 01:24:25,390
# O spa...

2349
01:24:26,391 --> 01:24:29,978
# O beautiful for spacious skies

2350
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:33,273
# With amber waves of grain

2351
01:24:33,398 --> 01:24:36,025
- Come on. Come on, sing it.
- Oh, God!

2352
01:24:36,151 --> 01:24:40,989
<i>(both) # For purple mountains majesty</i>

2353
01:24:41,114 --> 01:24:46,244

# America, America...

2355
01:25:16,816 --> 01:25:19,235
Halloween.

2356
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:21,571
Ha...

2357
01:25:22,614 --> 01:25:24,866
Hal-louise?

2358
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:28,161
- What?
- Your name: Hallie.

2359
01:25:29,204 --> 01:25:31,539
That's not your name.

2360
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:35,668
Alice.

2361
01:25:36,127 --> 01:25:37,921
My name is Alice.

2362
01:25:40,465 --> 01:25:43,801
My kid sister used
to holler at me after school.

2363
01:25:44,427 --> 01:25:48,139
She'd yell "Haaa-lice!"

2364
01:25:52,226 --> 01:25:54,938
So they called me Hallie.

2365
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:57,398
Alice Martin.

2366
01:26:00,318 --> 01:26:02,487
That fits you.

2367
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,575
I used to bite and pinch a lot too.

2368
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,577
I'll bet you did.

2371
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:20,630
It's mustangs. Mares.
They smell the horse.

2372
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:33,309
You know what you need?

2373
01:26:37,271 --> 01:26:40,149
A pair of proper shoes.

2374
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:48,741
Hey.

2375
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:53,621
Where are we?

2376
01:26:54,539 --> 01:26:56,582
Are we lost?

2377
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:01,295
Lost?

2378
01:27:02,797 --> 01:27:04,424
No.

2379
01:27:09,595 --> 01:27:12,557
Good night... Alice.

2380
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,772
Good night, Norman.

2381
01:27:31,284 --> 01:27:34,996
If she's with Steele, then the network
will know where they are.

2382
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:37,582
That's the news department, Mr Sears.

2383
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:41,210
I don't think they'll want
to give out that kind of information.

2384
01:27:41,335 --> 01:27:44,755
Are you saying we spent
$80 to $100 million in TV time...

2385
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:47,383
...and we can't get
a simple piece of information?

2386
01:27:47,508 --> 01:27:51,012
- No, sir, I'm not saying that...
- You don't ask the news department.

2387
01:27:51,137 --> 01:27:54,515
Ask the advertising department.
They'll ask the news department.

2388
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:32,303
What are you doin' up?

2389
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,723
Nothing much.

2390
01:28:38,017 --> 01:28:42,230
You've had a hard day.
Why don't you scrunch down in the bag?

2391
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:47,068
Oh, I wish it were that easy.

2392
01:28:47,777 --> 01:28:49,820
I don't sleep.

2393
01:28:50,863 --> 01:28:53,157
Ever?

2394
01:28:53,282 --> 01:28:55,618
How old are you?

2395
01:28:59,205 --> 01:29:03,042
Not in front of... in front
of people I don't know.

2396
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:08,881
You slept last night.

2397
01:29:09,006 --> 01:29:11,258
The hell I did.

2398
01:29:16,222 --> 01:29:18,599
Not in front of a stranger.

2399
01:29:20,893 --> 01:29:25,022
What, are you afraid of what you'll
look like with your mouth open?

2400
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:30,403
You have a mean streak in you.

2401
01:29:33,864 --> 01:29:35,616
No.

2402
01:29:36,784 --> 01:29:38,828
No, I don't.

2403
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:57,680
I still pinch and bite.

2404
01:30:03,644 --> 01:30:05,479
OK.

2405
01:30:42,308 --> 01:30:44,351
Morning.

2406
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,857
I'm still here.

2407
01:30:58,407 --> 01:31:03,829
There's... there's coffee from last night.
It's probably cold.

2408
01:31:05,748 --> 01:31:08,584
It probably is, if it hasn't been heated.

2409
01:31:10,085 --> 01:31:12,254
And there's cheese.

2410
01:31:13,964 --> 01:31:16,008
Cheese.

2411
01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:20,971
You're all bent. Are you sick?

2412
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:23,766
No. Just bent.

2413
01:31:25,518 --> 01:31:28,521
Well... Here, have some cheese.

2414
01:31:29,271 --> 01:31:33,359
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

2415
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:37,112
I know. I'm the one that said it.

2416
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:44,745
- Are you sure you're not hurt?
- No. Just...

2417
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:47,915
...some parts wake up faster than others.

2418
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:51,377
Broke parts take a little longer, though.

2419
01:32:05,266 --> 01:32:07,977
I, uh, I would've called a cab,
left you a note.

2420
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:11,522
You know, "Call me",
with my phone number.

2421
01:32:12,982 --> 01:32:17,111
Actually, I'd have left my answering
service number, just stuck it on the...

2422
01:32:17,236 --> 01:32:19,071
What's the matter?

2423
01:32:19,446 --> 01:32:21,907
I wanna know what's botherin' you.

2424
01:32:23,075 --> 01:32:27,913
It was just you and me last night.
It's not gonna be on television.

2425
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:33,961
- Is it?
- I don't know what you mean.

2426
01:32:34,086 --> 01:32:38,757
The problem is you get up slowly, I get
up fast. It's... the way that I was raised.

2427
01:32:38,882 --> 01:32:42,928
- Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up.
- We just got up, and got to work.

2428
01:32:43,053 --> 01:32:45,222
I was up before the sun
ever hit your room.

2429
01:32:45,347 --> 01:32:48,475
Well, then you get the getting-up medal.

2430
01:32:54,565 --> 01:32:58,360
Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry?
Isn't that what you said?

2431
01:32:58,652 --> 01:33:00,988
Good mornin', Alice.

2432
01:33:05,576 --> 01:33:07,786
Good morning.

2433
01:33:11,457 --> 01:33:13,959
You're right. We are in a hurry.

2434
01:33:14,835 --> 01:33:17,421
But let's say we lighten up a bit.

2435
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:20,215
I think that's a great idea. Lighten up.

2436
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,344
We're gonna be travelling together
a little while...

2437
01:33:29,475 --> 01:33:30,726
Oh...

2438
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:33,270
There. All lightened up.

2439
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:47,951
<i>(radio)...temperatures are dipping
below freezing in the high plateau.</i>

2440
01:33:48,076 --> 01:33:51,079
<i>On the national scene,
the search for Sonny Steele...</i>

2441
01:33:51,205 --> 01:33:55,417
<i>...is concentrated in central Utah.
KLSG switchboards have been jammed...</i>

2442
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:58,879
- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls.
- There ain't any.

2443
01:33:59,004 --> 01:34:01,799
Hell, you can name anything anything.

2444
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:06,845
It's like those people who
look up at the stars and see things.

2445
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:11,058
Chickens and bulls and chariots
and snakes and shit...

2446
01:34:14,978 --> 01:34:19,107
What's this guy's name who's supposed
to have a belt? Ryan, or O'Ryan...

2447
01:34:19,233 --> 01:34:21,735
Hell, there ain't no belt up there.

2448
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:24,613
Probably there was a falls here once.

2449
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:28,825
This whole land was under water
millions of years ago.

2450
01:34:28,951 --> 01:34:34,414
If you go... if you go slow,
take your time and you look real close...

2451
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,877
...you can find skeletons of these
weird-lookin' fishes in the hardpan...

2452
01:34:39,002 --> 01:34:41,296
...long, long gone.

2453
01:34:44,675 --> 01:34:49,179
All these mountains...
Hell, everything, everything you can see...

2454
01:34:49,805 --> 01:34:52,516
...everything, was under an ocean once.

2455
01:34:56,812 --> 01:35:01,108
- What are you smilin' at?
- I'm just enjoying the fact that you...

2456
01:35:01,733 --> 01:35:04,695
...that you know all that. It's interesting.

2457
01:35:06,655 --> 01:35:09,324
Well, this country's where I live.

2458
01:35:09,449 --> 01:35:13,078
- Don't you know where the subways go?
- Not lately.

2459
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:16,581
Oh, yeah, you do.

2460
01:35:17,249 --> 01:35:19,334
How'd you know to find me?

2461
01:35:19,459 --> 01:35:23,213
Musta been 70, 80 reporters there,
but you were the one that found me.

2462
01:35:23,338 --> 01:35:26,466
Just had a few hunches
and got a head start.

2463
01:35:27,426 --> 01:35:31,930
Oh, you had more than that, Alice.
You are good.

2464
01:35:44,526 --> 01:35:46,570
Let's go.

2465
01:35:48,655 --> 01:35:50,824
Here, give me that stuff here.

2466
01:35:50,949 --> 01:35:54,369
OK, I want you to put
your left foot right here.

2467
01:35:54,494 --> 01:35:56,580
- Come on.
- I don't know how to ride.

2468
01:35:56,705 --> 01:35:59,583
You're not gonna ride.
I'm gonna be doin' the steering.

2469
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,836
Listen, I'm not interested in horses.
They're... too big.

2470
01:36:02,961 --> 01:36:05,589
Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body.

2471
01:36:05,714 --> 01:36:10,343
We're not gonna get anywhere
with you in them spiky shoes. Come on.

2472
01:36:11,386 --> 01:36:14,723
- Oh, God...
- OK, swing your right leg right on over.

2473
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,142
That's it. There you go.

2474
01:36:17,601 --> 01:36:19,644
Here.

2475
01:36:19,853 --> 01:36:23,523
- Uh, should I pet him?
- Do what you want. He ain't no dog.

2476
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:38,121
<i>(radio) Doyle Hicks.
Go ahead, you're on the air.</i>

2477
01:36:38,246 --> 01:36:40,874
<i>- (feedback) Is this Doyle?
- Turn down your radio.</i>

2478
01:36:40,999 --> 01:36:44,169
<i>Yeah, well, I just wanna say
that what Sonny Steele done...</i>

2479
01:36:44,294 --> 01:36:47,339
<i>...is wonderful news
for the animals of this country.</i>

2480

<i>(woman) If somebody's poisoning an
animal, a person should try and stop it.</i>

2481
01:36:52,177 --> 01:36:54,846
<i>(man) I'd have done
the same damn thing myself.</i>

2482
01:36:54,971 --> 01:36:59,100
<i>Them (beep) Ampco people
got no right to dope up a horse.</i>

2483
01:37:30,465 --> 01:37:33,176
- What you got?
- Not gonna throw this away, are you?

2484
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:34,469
- What is it?
- Just notes.

2485
01:37:34,594 --> 01:37:36,388
Can I see 'em?

2486
01:37:36,513 --> 01:37:38,765
They're just my notes.

2487
01:37:41,393 --> 01:37:44,229
- What are these, in Russian?
- That's my handwriting.

2488
01:37:44,354 --> 01:37:46,606
- Well, read 'em.
- No.

2489
01:37:48,233 --> 01:37:50,527
You got a secret?

2490
01:37:58,034 --> 01:38:02,372
"I feel I'm seeing this country
for the first time."

2491
01:38:03,582 --> 01:38:07,294
"Not looking down
from a jet 30,000ft up...

2492
01:38:07,419 --> 01:38:13,550
...but from the low angle... of a special
man who means to cross it on foot...

2493
01:38:13,675 --> 01:38:19,180
...leading a thoroughbred stallion to
a secret destination... to a private goal."

2494
01:38:20,557 --> 01:38:25,020
"To a fairness that he intends
to find in these valleys."

2495
01:38:26,604 --> 01:38:30,900
"I..." I can't. They're just my notes.
I'm embarrassed.

2496
01:38:40,618 --> 01:38:42,454
Nice.

2497
01:38:42,954 --> 01:38:45,874
- It's hype.
- Coulda fooled me.

2498
01:38:49,085 --> 01:38:52,047
She ordered a camera crew
to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon.

2499
01:38:52,172 --> 01:38:55,884
- I suppose to photograph the...
- The ceremony.

2500
01:38:56,009 --> 01:38:58,595
The sales figures again, exactly.

2501
01:38:59,512 --> 01:39:04,184
In the three days since he took the horse,
office equipment has been as projected...

2502
01:39:04,309 --> 01:39:06,311
The cereal.

2503
01:39:06,436 --> 01:39:08,855
Cumulatively, up 30 per cent.

2504
01:39:09,397 --> 01:39:13,318
And by closing time today
they'd emptied the shelves.

2505
01:39:15,779 --> 01:39:17,363
<i>(knocking)</i>

2506
01:39:18,364 --> 01:39:20,325
Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it?

2507
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:25,914
Well, sir, there's something here
that I think you should be aware of.

2508
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:34,130
- Where'd you get that?
- There are kids selling 'em on the street.

2509
01:39:35,965 --> 01:39:38,468
Now that's not supposed to be there.

2510
01:39:38,593 --> 01:39:40,929
Or we're not supposed to be here.

2511
01:39:41,054 --> 01:39:43,098
<i>You're lost?</i>

2512
01:39:44,557 --> 01:39:48,269
About a mile's worth, I'd say.
We gotta get off this ridge.

2513
01:39:49,145 --> 01:39:51,189
Maybe... Do...

2514
01:39:51,564 --> 01:39:56,361
- Maybe I could get us some supplies.
- We got enough supplies. Let's go.

2515
01:39:59,197 --> 01:40:00,448
Oh!

2516
01:40:03,034 --> 01:40:05,078
Here, here...

2517
01:40:05,203 --> 01:40:07,247
You OK?

2518
01:40:08,248 --> 01:40:09,999
Are you all right?

2519
01:40:10,124 --> 01:40:12,293
A-OK.

2520
01:40:12,418 --> 01:40:16,089
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.

2521
01:40:16,756 --> 01:40:18,508
Maybe you ought to sit down.

2522
01:40:18,633 --> 01:40:23,805
- You don't understand the problem.
- Well, lay down or somethin'. Here.

2523
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:26,558
And listen to you bitch about my boots?
No, thank you.

2524
01:40:26,683 --> 01:40:29,727
No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em.
Here. Right here.

2525
01:40:29,853 --> 01:40:32,272
Oh... God, my back.

2526
01:40:32,981 --> 01:40:34,649
Easy.

2527
01:40:34,941 --> 01:40:36,985
Let's take a look.

2528
01:40:37,402 --> 01:40:41,155
You just relax, cos we're makin'
good time, don't worry.

2529
01:40:42,532 --> 01:40:44,576
Hold on.

2530
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,798
Here.

2531
01:40:58,923 --> 01:41:00,049
Oh.

2532
01:41:00,174 --> 01:41:02,176
Little hair of the dog.

2533
01:41:02,302 --> 01:41:03,803
Oh!

2534
01:41:12,353 --> 01:41:16,274
- I feel better already.
- Yeah, well, don't put it away.

2535
01:41:23,906 --> 01:41:29,662
Hey, why don't you get some rest?
I'll go find us a place to cross the road.

2536
01:41:30,955 --> 01:41:32,999
I won't be long.

2537
01:41:36,169 --> 01:41:37,920
<i>(door opens)</i>

2538
01:41:40,423 --> 01:41:42,800
Hi, there. What's your name?

2539
01:41:43,509 --> 01:41:46,596
- Louise.
- Oh! Same as mine.

2540
01:41:47,638 --> 01:41:52,226
You, uh... you taking care
of this place all by yourself?

2541
01:41:52,352 --> 01:41:57,106
- Is your name really Louise?
- You bet. Your mom and dad here?

2542
01:41:57,231 --> 01:42:00,193
My mom went to get butane.
We're all out.

2543
01:42:00,902 --> 01:42:03,029
- You have a telephone?
- It's out too.

2544
01:42:03,154 --> 01:42:07,909
Every time it snows up at Marysville,
first thing, the phone goes out.

2545
01:42:08,034 --> 01:42:10,078
Where's your car?

2546
01:42:10,703 --> 01:42:14,874
Oh, I'm... I'm sort of camping out,
and my car went on the blink.

2547
01:42:14,999 --> 01:42:18,544
And I, uh... I need
to get a message to my boss.

2548
01:42:18,669 --> 01:42:21,756
Are you gonna be near a phone later on?
After you close up?

2549
01:42:21,881 --> 01:42:23,674
Well, we got a phone at home.

2550
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,427
I bet you could call for me
and get a message to him.

2551
01:42:26,552 --> 01:42:30,223
Could you do that? How much
do you charge to make a call?

2552
01:42:30,348 --> 01:42:31,974
One dollar.

2553
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:35,186
That's fair. OK, let me
give you the phone number...

2554
01:42:35,311 --> 01:42:39,607
...and when you get him on the phone, ask
for Les Charles. Don't talk to anybody else.

2555
01:42:39,732 --> 01:42:41,943
And tell him you're calling for me...

2556
01:42:42,068 --> 01:42:44,695
- For Louise.
- No... Yeah.

2557
01:42:44,821 --> 01:42:47,573
- Louise, in Utah.
- I know what state it is.

2558
01:42:47,698 --> 01:42:53,788
Tell him I said call off the crew, call off
everything. I'll explain when I see him.

2559
01:42:53,913 --> 01:42:57,291
- Shouldn't I say your car broke down?
- No, no. Just the rest of it.

2560
01:42:57,416 --> 01:43:01,420
<i>- About the flu?
- No, the crew. I'll write it out for you.</i>

2561
01:43:01,546 --> 01:43:04,298
- Her car broke down.
- Oh, where's it at, miss?

2562
01:43:04,423 --> 01:43:06,551
Well, it...

2563
01:43:06,676 --> 01:43:09,428
Well, it didn't really break down,
it's just acting...

2564
01:43:09,554 --> 01:43:11,722
And I have to call her boss about it.

2565
01:43:11,848 --> 01:43:15,852
Say, aren't you... You know, television.
You've seen her.

2566
01:43:15,977 --> 01:43:19,147
- Last week I saw her.
- News. News. News commentator.

2567
01:43:19,272 --> 01:43:22,733
It's too complicated, Louise.
Thanks anyway.

2568
01:43:23,818 --> 01:43:26,696
- What's your name? Please.
- Louise.

2569
01:43:30,324 --> 01:43:32,577
Found us a spot.

2570
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:37,206
- How you doin'?
- Good as new.

2571
01:43:37,999 --> 01:43:40,042
Serves you right.

2572
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,882
There's a place we can cross the road
about a mile south.

2573
01:43:46,007 --> 01:43:50,845
Gotta honk on it though.
I wanna get there before dark.

2574
01:43:51,345 --> 01:43:52,930
We're that close?

2575
01:43:53,055 --> 01:43:56,934
Yeah, for where we can spend the night.
Inside, for a change. Come on.

2576
01:43:57,059 --> 01:44:01,522
Isn't there some closer place where
you guys take horses to let 'em go?

2577
01:44:01,647 --> 01:44:04,525
No. I just usually use the one, myself.

2578
01:44:05,651 --> 01:44:08,779
It's so pretty here.
If I were Rising Star, I'd love to...

2579
01:44:08,905 --> 01:44:10,865
Well, you're not. Come on.

2580
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:15,411
Do me a favour, will you, Alice?
Don't go tryin' to think like a horse.

2581
01:44:16,329 --> 01:44:18,456
I'll worry about him. You just take notes.

2582
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:39,894
OI' Clark Wembly had this place built.
Us cowboys used to use it for huntin'.

2583
01:44:40,019 --> 01:44:43,689
Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin'.

2584
01:44:44,357 --> 01:44:48,277
He had a voice that was
just like runnin' molasses.

2585
01:44:49,111 --> 01:44:53,324
And it'd come over the PA system...
"Sorry you lost, Sonny."

2586
01:44:53,449 --> 01:44:57,578
And there I'd be, lyin' in the dirt, just
havin' been dumped on by some bull...

2587
01:44:57,703 --> 01:45:02,124
...just broke and busted, but ol' Clark's
voice'd come sailin' across...

2588
01:45:02,249 --> 01:45:06,629
...and he'd say "Give him a big hand, folks.
Glad you come. Better luck next time."

2589
01:45:06,754 --> 01:45:09,382
God, Jesus! He was so terrific.

2590
01:45:09,882 --> 01:45:13,219
He made me feel good.
He made me feel like tryin'.

2591
01:45:13,344 --> 01:45:18,224
And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho.
Oh, what an animal.

2592
01:45:18,349 --> 01:45:20,601
That horse used to ju...

2593
01:45:22,395 --> 01:45:26,273
Bub-bub-blurgh-blurgh,
runnin' right off at the mouth.

2594
01:45:26,941 --> 01:45:28,984
I enjoyed it.

2595
01:45:35,699 --> 01:45:40,037
- When are we gonna get there?
- About midday.

2596
01:45:47,086 --> 01:45:49,130
It's been a long haul.

2597
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:01,016
Somethin' bothering you?

2598
01:46:03,018 --> 01:46:07,690
- What are you gonna do after?
- Oh, you gonna start with the questions?

2599
01:46:08,315 --> 01:46:14,738
Well, when he's loose, chasing mares,
do you just... do you just do the same?

2600
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:18,367
<i>What do you think?</i>

2601
01:46:18,492 --> 01:46:23,247
You're the one takin' the notes.
You're a... clever lady.

2602
01:46:23,622 --> 01:46:27,793
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- You say it like it's a bad word, "clever".

2603
01:46:27,918 --> 01:46:30,254
No. I like you bein' smart.

2604
01:46:31,714 --> 01:46:36,343
It's just sometimes you're so busy
being clever that I don't...

2605
01:46:37,887 --> 01:46:40,931
When was the last time
you were surprised?

2606
01:46:43,142 --> 01:46:45,186
You.

2607
01:46:45,728 --> 01:46:47,938
You were a surprise.

2608
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:58,866
I told them.

2609
01:46:58,991 --> 01:47:01,076
Wha... Who?

2610
01:47:02,369 --> 01:47:04,246
I, uh...

2611
01:47:08,918 --> 01:47:13,631
I called the network and I told them
you were going to Rim Rock Canyon.

2612
01:47:13,756 --> 01:47:17,426
And I asked them to meet me there
with a camera crew.

2613
01:47:18,636 --> 01:47:20,262
Oh.

2614
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,516
And that's not all.

2615
01:47:25,017 --> 01:47:27,436
<i>Oh, now for the bad news?</i>

2616
01:47:28,938 --> 01:47:33,359
I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail.
I wasn't in any trouble.

2617
01:47:38,864 --> 01:47:40,407
Well.

2618
01:47:41,659 --> 01:47:44,161
Well, well, well.

2619
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:51,669
<i>What do you know.</i>

2620
01:47:52,628 --> 01:47:56,382
Oh, Sonny... Please, don't just walk away.

2621
01:47:56,507 --> 01:47:59,802
Don't be like that. Hit me,
yell at me, slap me or something.

2622
01:47:59,927 --> 01:48:02,388
I already slapped you.
First time we was alone.

2623
01:48:02,513 --> 01:48:07,309
- Swear to God I wouldn't do it now.
- Oh? Is that right? You a new person?

2624
01:48:07,434 --> 01:48:09,978
It was three days ago.
I didn't understand what...

2625
01:48:10,104 --> 01:48:12,606
Yeah. A lot can happen in three days.

2626
01:48:14,108 --> 01:48:17,152
I didn't want to ruin anything for you,
Sonny.

2627
01:48:17,277 --> 01:48:21,532
- I had a job to do and I wanted a story.
- Well, you got it.

2628
01:48:22,157 --> 01:48:24,201
You did it.

2629
01:48:33,544 --> 01:48:35,796
Hey, how about my letter?

2630
01:48:37,089 --> 01:48:39,925
Did you mail it?
Or is that gonna be on TV?

2631
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:42,094
Oh, please!

2632
01:48:46,974 --> 01:48:49,810
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What I said.

2633
01:48:49,935 --> 01:48:52,813
- Why not just take him to another place?
- No.

2634
01:48:53,063 --> 01:48:55,732
<i>- Why?
- I want him at that place.</i>

2635
01:48:55,858 --> 01:48:58,986
Everybody's done their thing.
Ampco did what they had to do...

2636
01:48:59,111 --> 01:49:01,321
...you did, now I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

2637
01:49:01,447 --> 01:49:05,117
Sonny, you can't go there.
They'll be there. The police may be there.

2638
01:49:05,242 --> 01:49:09,163
I can't run for ever. Look, we're either
all goin' to heaven or we ain't.

2639
01:49:09,288 --> 01:49:13,041
Besides, you want to see the finish.
Well, be still.

2640
01:49:14,168 --> 01:49:16,211
Let it finish.

2641
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:21,008
Oh, I don't want you to be hurt.

2642
01:49:21,925 --> 01:49:24,636
I've been hurt. I still get up.

2643
01:49:32,728 --> 01:49:34,980
Thanks for the worry.

2644
01:49:40,194 --> 01:49:42,404
Do me a favour?

2645
01:49:42,529 --> 01:49:45,699
Tomorrow... don't take notes.

2646
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:50,704
Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry.

2647
01:50:27,991 --> 01:50:30,243
Better get off.

2648
01:50:35,415 --> 01:50:38,001
How soon before we get there?

2649
01:50:41,171 --> 01:50:43,465
<i>We are there.</i>

2650
01:50:48,387 --> 01:50:51,515
Wait a minute...
The camera crew, they're not here.

2651
01:50:53,392 --> 01:50:55,268
Appears not.

2652
01:50:55,394 --> 01:50:58,563
Well, Star, what do you think of the place?

2653
01:50:59,064 --> 01:51:01,817
They... they must be at another entrance.

2654
01:51:01,942 --> 01:51:04,236
Ain't no other entrance.

2655
01:51:05,821 --> 01:51:08,073
Well, then hurry. Maybe they're lost.

2656
01:51:08,198 --> 01:51:10,450
I doubt it.

2657
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:13,453
Well, where the hell are they?

2658
01:51:13,578 --> 01:51:17,332
Probably in Rim Rock Canyon.
Isn't that where you told 'em to go?

2659
01:51:20,794 --> 01:51:23,296
They'd be about 90 miles north.

2660
01:51:24,464 --> 01:51:28,719
- This isn't...
- This here's Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it?

2661
01:51:30,137 --> 01:51:30,804
You...

2662
01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:34,558
Oh, no, now! I never said we were goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon! You said it!

2663
01:51:34,683 --> 01:51:37,602
Hey, look out!
Don't get me with them boots!

2664
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:40,021
<i>(whinnies)</i>

2665
01:51:40,147 --> 01:51:42,566
Where is he?
And what was this about a reward?

2666
01:51:42,691 --> 01:51:45,193
- I... I...
- We've been misinformed.

2667
01:51:45,318 --> 01:51:48,071
When our own investigation
revealed the truth...

2668
01:51:48,196 --> 01:51:50,991
...naturally we understood
Mr Steele's motivation.

2669
01:51:54,286 --> 01:51:58,415
I don't think there's enough food
to last another night.

2670
01:52:01,126 --> 01:52:04,379
- I don't think he's coming.
- It's occurred to me.

2671
01:52:10,677 --> 01:52:14,347
Well, Star, you wanna
say goodbye to the lady?

2672
01:52:19,019 --> 01:52:21,062
Hey, boy.

2673
01:52:26,985 --> 01:52:29,488
- Swing your tail.
- Excuse us.

2674
01:52:41,333 --> 01:52:43,168
OK.

2675
01:52:44,336 --> 01:52:48,340
Remember, they're just horses.
Same as you.

2676
01:52:49,174 --> 01:52:53,386
Only they've never been broke. But
they ain't won no championships neither.

2677
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:59,684
So when you cross that stallion
and he wants to fight...

2678
01:52:59,809 --> 01:53:04,898
...you remember, you got the blood
on your side. And you can take him.

2679
01:53:07,317 --> 01:53:10,612
- Is he just gonna go, just like that?
- You bet.

2680
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:14,199
- I thought you guys were pals.
- We are.

2681
01:53:19,329 --> 01:53:21,831
Make somethin' outta yourself now.

2682
01:54:19,514 --> 01:54:22,267
Yeah. When I see you, Les.
About nine o'clock.

2683
01:54:22,392 --> 01:54:24,436
OK, bye-bye.

2684
01:54:29,441 --> 01:54:32,861
There's your bus. Looks like it's on time.

2685
01:54:33,278 --> 01:54:35,447
Oh. Good.

2686
01:54:41,286 --> 01:54:43,788
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

2687
01:54:44,998 --> 01:54:47,751
Maybe not as good as him, but... good.

2688
01:54:47,876 --> 01:54:49,878
What did they say?

2689
01:54:50,003 --> 01:54:54,674
Oh, they're full of congratulations.
Can't wait to get the story.

2690
01:54:54,799 --> 01:54:58,595
Especially now that Ampco
has reversed its position.

2691
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,263
Yeah, I'll bet.

2692
01:55:00,388 --> 01:55:04,309
They have me going to Paris next
to cover the elections.

2693
01:55:04,851 --> 01:55:08,772
Well, no kiddin'?
That oughta be interesting.

2694
01:55:11,399 --> 01:55:15,320
- More coffee?
- No, not for me, thanks. You want any?

2695
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:17,780
Yes, please.

2696
01:55:20,074 --> 01:55:23,077
Just a little somethin' for the road.

2697
01:55:40,261 --> 01:55:43,014
Ho, ho, ho... Careful there.

2698
01:55:55,944 --> 01:55:57,028
Tell me, Norman...

2699
01:55:57,153 --> 01:56:00,823
...did you think it'd be this tough
to get rid of a pain in the ass like me?

2700
01:56:01,908 --> 01:56:03,826
Ma'am, I had no idea.

2701
01:56:03,952 --> 01:56:08,790
<i>(driver) All aboard the bus. Cedar City,
Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado.</i>

2702
01:56:14,587 --> 01:56:17,590
Uh, that story you're gonna tell...

2703
01:56:17,715 --> 01:56:21,261
It'd be nice if you didn't mention
where it was that we let him go.

2704
01:56:21,386 --> 01:56:22,887
Silver Reef?

2705
01:56:23,012 --> 01:56:25,598
<i>Be nice if you didn't divulge that source.</i>

2706
01:56:25,723 --> 01:56:28,893
I don't know, leave out a name like that...

2707
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:38,194
What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny?

2708
01:56:38,695 --> 01:56:41,906
Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on.

2709
01:56:43,533 --> 01:56:45,910
Find me somethin' simple.

2710
01:56:47,954 --> 01:56:51,624
Hard, maybe, but plain and quiet.

2711
01:56:53,001 --> 01:56:55,086
Any bags, ma'am?

2712
01:56:55,211 --> 01:56:57,046
Uh, no.

2713
01:56:59,632 --> 01:57:01,467
Uh, hey...?

2714
01:57:03,261 --> 01:57:05,638
I keep wantin' to thank you.

2715
01:57:05,763 --> 01:57:08,307
But then I keep wonderin' what for.

2716
01:57:08,891 --> 01:57:11,227
I know. I know. Me too.

2717
01:57:13,896 --> 01:57:19,027
Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel
whenever I see you on television.

2718
01:57:22,905 --> 01:57:25,867
Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV.

2719
01:57:30,371 --> 01:57:31,956
So...

2720
01:57:32,081 --> 01:57:34,125
All aboard, ma'am.

2721
01:57:43,801 --> 01:57:46,471
- So long, Alice.
- So long, Norman.

2722
01:57:47,513 --> 01:57:49,807
Have a safe trip back now.

2723
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:06,991
All charges have been dropped,
and, sources say...

2724
01:58:07,116 --> 01:58:11,287
...the Ampco art department
is hard at work designing a new logo.

2725
01:58:11,412 --> 01:58:14,081
As to the whereabouts of Rising Star...

2726
01:58:15,166 --> 01:58:17,460
...nothing further is known.

2727
01:58:17,585 --> 01:58:21,506
So ends the bizarre saga
of horse racing's most honoured stallion...

2728
01:58:21,631 --> 01:58:24,217
...and the man who set him free.

2729
01:58:25,927 --> 01:58:29,972
Except for one note of thanks
from this reporter to Mr Steele...

2730
01:58:30,097 --> 01:58:34,435
...for his... cooperation
in bringing this story to you.

2731
01:58:35,853 --> 01:58:39,398
<i>This is Hallie Martin in New York,
saying good night.</i>

2732
01:58:39,649 --> 01:58:41,734
<i># At a time</i>

2733
01:58:41,859 --> 01:58:44,070
<i># When the world</i>

2734
01:58:44,195 --> 01:58:47,323
<i># Seems to be spinnin'</i>

2735
01:58:49,825 --> 01:58:53,913
<i># Hopelessly out of control</i>

2736
01:58:56,332 --> 01:58:58,376
<i># There's deceivers</i>

2737
01:58:58,501 --> 01:59:00,545
<i># And believers</i>

2738
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:04,173
<i># And old in-betweeners</i>

2739
01:59:05,007 --> 01:59:09,595
<i># That seem to have no place to go</i>

2740
01:59:12,014 --> 01:59:15,893
<i># Well, it's the same old song</i>

2741
01:59:16,018 --> 01:59:19,438
<i># It's right and it's wrong</i>

2742
01:59:19,564 --> 01:59:24,318
<i># And livin' is just something that I do</i>

2743
01:59:26,737 --> 01:59:29,657
<i># And with no place to hide</i>

2744
01:59:30,491 --> 01:59:33,661
<i># I looked in your eyes</i>

2745
01:59:34,036 --> 01:59:39,000
<i># And I found myself in you</i>

2746
01:59:40,876 --> 01:59:44,088
<i># I looked to the stars</i>

2747
01:59:44,588 --> 01:59:48,175
<i># Tried all of the bars</i>

2748
01:59:48,301 --> 01:59:53,431
<i># And I've nearly gone up in smoke</i>

2749
01:59:55,224 --> 01:59:58,686
<i># Now my hand's on the wheel</i>

2750
01:59:58,811 --> 02:00:01,647
<i># Of somethin' that's real</i>

2751
02:00:02,273 --> 02:00:03,983
<i># And I feel</i>

2752
02:00:04,108 --> 02:00:07,278
<i># Like I'm goin' home</i>

2753
02:00:09,238 --> 02:00:15,494
<i># And I feel like I'm goin' home</i>
