Okay, one more time from the top.

2
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,639
Six beats, all right?

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,199
One, two, three, four. One, two...

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
To be on the wire is life.
The rest is waiting.

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,559
That's very theatrical, Joe.

6
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,559
- Yeah, I know.
- Did you make it up?

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,199
I wish I had.

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,121
- Do you like it?
- Well, it's all right.

I've never been
in any show in my life.

48
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,959
I had to put something.
I really need a job, so I lied.

49
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,399
That's all right.
I lie all the time myself.

50
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,359
Oh, fuck him. He never picks me.

51
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,079
I did fuck him,
and he never picks me either.

52
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,719
- You were in Traffic Jam?
- Yes, sir.

53
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,439
Who was the director
of Traffic Jam?

54
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,799
- You were, Mr. Gideon.
- Oh. How was I?

55
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,279
- Terrific.
- And who was the choreographer?

56
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,679
- You were, Mr. Gideon.
- How was I?

57
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,884
- Fantastic.
- That's how you get a job.

58
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,239
God! I hope he doesn't pick her.

59
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,479
She's uglier than a witch's tit.

60
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,119
The expression is
"colder than a witch's tit."

61
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,679
How would you know?
You've never seen a woman's tit.

62
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,119
Shh! Be quiet.

63
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,439
Okay. Thank you all very much.
It was a terrific audition.

64
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,999
Just stay in line.

65
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,239
Now, that's what I call
a real drinker's nose.

66
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,439
And you should know, because
you're a real drinker, aren't you?

67
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,239
Yeah.

68
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,119
- Also heavy into speed, aren't you?
- Yeah.

69
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,846
Also sleep with a great many women.

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,559
Real turn-off, huh?

71
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,599
Just the opposite.

72
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,039
I'll make up my mind about the men later,
but I know which girls I want now...

73
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,359
Candy, Casey, Rima, Jennifer,
and Victoria Porter.

74
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,319
- In the shocking pink leotard?
- Yeah.

75
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,599
See if any are willing
to be swing dancers.

76
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,079
- She's tone-deaf, Joey.
- With those legs, who cares?

77
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,279
Joey, I know you're in a hurry.

78
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,119
- I just want to check your schedule.
- Same as always.

79
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,529
Joey? Joey, can we talk
a minute, please?

80
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,879
- Joey...
- What is it?

81
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,799
- What about Diane?
- You left me without a soprano again!

82
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,599
Paul, please, please,
will you let me handle it?

83
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,399
- What about Diane?
- What about Diane?

84
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,399
- I've had her in three shows. She's wonderful.
- She's wonderful.

85
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,759
- He needs a soprano.
- You left me without a soprano.
I gotta have a soprano!

86
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,639
Gentlemen,
Mr. Gideon will make up...

87
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,679
The tall dancer on stage right...

88
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,359
with the blue eye shadow...
he'll hit the high notes.

89
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,599
Tovar, Narin-Smith...

90
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,239
The five Murray is talking to are
the girls I want. Okay with you?

91
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,359
The tall girl, Victoria...
I like her, Daddy.

92
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,319
Mm, she's all right.

93
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,319
Oh, I really screwed
up that marriage.

94
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,525
Because I cheated. Oh, man,
I cheated every chance I could get.

95
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,639
Okay with you, Audrey?

96
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,239
Sure, fine with me. What about
this weekend with Michelle?

97
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,399
Oh, Jesus! I forgot.
I gotta work this weekend.

98
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,439
Oh, Joe, you promised her!

99
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,479
I know I promised,
but what am I gonna do?

100
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,679
That's okay.

101
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,724
- I'm sorry, Michelle.
- That's okay.

102
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,959
If you want me,
I'll be in the cutting room.

103
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,810
He promised me.

104
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,359
Some fucking father!

105
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,119
- Family?
- Screwed up.

106
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,561
- Work?
- All there is.

107
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,279
If I were God, man...

108
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,370
sometimes I think I am...

109
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,479
Depends on the shit you're smoking.

110
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,999
Mm, okay.

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,159
If I were God, man...

112
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,639
everybody would live forever.

113
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,239
No death, man!

114
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,559
No pennies on the eyes for anybody.

115
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,159
Well, there are a couple people, like my
agent, who booked me into this toilet.

116
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,639
Why is he mumbling like that?

117
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,919
I'll tell you why: 'Cause I'm the
dummy who let him mumble like that.

118
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,479
- Right.
- Shh!
- death and the clap.

119
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,287
So far I've managed
to avoid one of them.

120
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,759
You know, man, death is
really a hip thing now.

121
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,959
But we all have very
different feelings about it.

122
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,439
For instance, to a Catholic,
death is a promotion.

123
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,639
Excuse me, Stacy.

124
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,839
Women.

125
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,679
Uh...

126
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,759
hope?

127
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,359
There's all this bullshit
about death with dignity.

128
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,999
You know what death with dignity is?
You don't drool.

129
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,359
Change-of-pace time.
Request. Here we go.

132
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,279
- You're a flirt.
- Mm-hmm.

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,959

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,799
Ken and Barbie dolls who

to look at the same thing?

Until he gets it the
way he wants it.

140
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,999
There's a lady in Chicago,
man, wrote a book...

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,999
Dr. Kubler-Ross, with a dash.

without the benefit
of dying herself...

144
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,399
has broken the process of
death into five stages...

145
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,199
anger, denial, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

146
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,519
Sounds like a Jewish law firm.

147
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,319
"Good morning. Anger, Denial,
Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance."

148
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,443
Anger.

149
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,559
"Jesus Christ!

150
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,519
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch
pig-fucking bastards!

151
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,559
Oh, poo!"

152
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,683
Bargaining.

153
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,559
What did I say? Anger, denial,
bargaining, depression, acceptance.

154
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,839
If you happen to get to denial...

155
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,119
denial... "No.

156
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,999
No, that's not me, man. No.
Oh, ho-ho!

157
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,599
Somebody else, maybe,
but not me. Oh, no.

158
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,039
You got the wrong...
How about my mother, man?

159
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,239
She's old, I'm weaned, I'm toilet-trained.
I don't need her anymore.

160
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,959
'Bye, Ma. You've been terrific.
I love ya, but not me!"'

161
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,199
Mother.

162
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,799
Kind of chubby. And jolly.

163
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,479
And sexy.

164
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,684
Bargaining! Remember her?

165
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,399
"Can we sit down and talk
about this like businessmen?

166
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,959
A negotiation, okay?
No more hard drugs.

167
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,279
A little grass, maybe,
but that's it.

168
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,919
Okay? Look, I promise I won't
flash on subways anymore, okay?"

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,919
Oh, God, am I dying!

174
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,599
Do you want to have dinner together
before I go to the theater?

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,159
- I can't.
- The doctor's not dying!

176
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,439
Should I come over
to your apartment later?

177
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,759
- Yeah, sure.
- Father?

178
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,599
Liar, cheat, womanizer.
You would've liked him.

179
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,639
Wait a minute. We may be
working very late tonight.

180
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,959
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

181
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,839
- We'll talk later.
- ...for this hospital room!

182
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,839
At those prices, man,
who can afford to live?

183
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,279
So...

184
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,209
acceptance.

185
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,039
- "I accept..."
- Hold it.

186
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,039
- Hold it, Irv.
- You finished, or run it again?

187
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,679
No, I do not want to run it again,
thank you. We are finished.

188
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,679
- Thank you, Irv.
- Anybody have any ideas?

189
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,199
I like it, Joe.
I think it's really funny.

190
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,039
Who asked you, Stacy?

191
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,279
It's too long. I don't know.

192
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,759
Maybe we can get away with it.

193
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,319
Do you suppose Stanley Kubrick
ever gets depressed?

194
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,359
- You want to work tonight, Joe?
- No. I wish I could...

195
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,679

No.

247
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,848
I screwed it up.

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,004
Oh, I meant to call her.

00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,603
Oh, boy, you are really something.

250
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,159
I'm Joey's mother.

251
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,319
Ever since he was so high,
he's had such a crush on you!

252
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,839
I've always been fond of Joe too.

253
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,279
Of all the children, he
was the least worry.

254
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,319
He worked in all those
cheap burlesque clubs.

255
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,599
Always around stark-naked girls.

256
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,119
But did it bother him? No.

257
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,679
He never paid any attention.

258
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,079
Never even looked at them.

259
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,682
Amatis: "you love."
Amant: "they love."

260
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,519
Amo, amas, amat...

261
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,559
amamus, amatis, amant.

262
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,604
Hey, kid.
What kind of language is that?

263
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,839
Oh, it's not a language.

264
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,399
Just some jokes I'm working on.

265
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,199
Some crazy jokes.

266
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,207
"Pu..." "Pu..."

267
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,528
Puella. "Girl."

268
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,090
Oh.

269
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,239
First-year Latin?

270
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,239
It's my kid brother's.

271
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,719
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

272
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,159
Uh-huh. What year were you born?

273
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,559
Uh, 19... uh... 30...

274
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,559
Try 1934.

275
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,839
- Right. 1934.
- 1935?

276
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,079
Yeah, 1935, yeah.

277
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,760
Now try 1492.

278
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,922
See ya around, kid.

279
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,279
Maybe we could have a drink
together sometime.

280
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,289
Oh, sure.

281
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,079
You notice we have these small
waitresses here, right?

282
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,319
You know why?
Make the drinks look bigger.

283
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,759
That's my favorite one...
the one with the big tips.

284
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,119
I got problems too. The other day
I went to see my psychiatrist.

285
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,919
I told him I have suicidal tendencies.
He says, "From now on, pay in advance."

286
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,199
I don't have to do
this for a living.

287
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,719
I have four chinchillas
at home in heat.

288
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,119
I make a lot of money
I just have trouble passing it.

289
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,799
I just have trouble passing it.
Is this on?

290
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,159
First-year Latin!

291
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,679
It's 3:00 in the morning.

292
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,039
Isn't it past your beddy time?

293
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,519
I don't look for big laughs.
I'll settle for intelligent nods.

294
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,159
Anything. Wink.

295
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,559
You'd better stop lying
or your nose will grow.

296
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,479
Ooh! Something's growing.

297
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,839
The drummer's not really with the band,
but he has the car. Married 14 years.

298
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,399
Fourteen years. No children.
Strict mother-in-law.

299
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,599
Let's continue on. Right
now, ladies and gentlemen...

300
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,679
here he is, tops in taps...

301
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,879
may we present Mr. Joe Gideon!

302
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,844
You're on.

303
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,922
Joey's never done anything
to disappoint me.

304
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,047
It's showtime, folks.

305
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,199
- Do you believe in love?
- I believe in saying "I love you."
Helps you concentrate.

306
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,839
Joe, they've asked me to
go on tour with the show.

307
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,039
How long?

308
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,239
Six months. What do you think?

309
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,599
- And you say it all the time.
- I say it a lot. A lot.

310
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,759
- When?
- When it works.

311
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,439
You know I love you, Katie...

312
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,399
but I think you have to do
what's best for you.

313
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,999
Just what do you mean?

314
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,804
Sometimes it doesn't work.

315
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,199
I mean, for your sake...

316
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,448
I think you should go.

317
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,519
Hello, Michael? It's Katie.

318
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,639
So...

319
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,842
did you mean it about dinner?

320
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,799
Wally's at 11:00? You're surprised?

321
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,319
I'm a little surprised.

322
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,279
Thank you.

323
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,006
Okay, Michael. Bye-bye.

324
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,799
I'm a little surprised too.

325
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,639
Isn't that nice?

326
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,968
Now we're all a little surprised.

327
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,239
- Who was that?
- Michael Graham.

328
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,359
- Who is Michael Graham?
- A dancer in my ballet class.

329
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,759
Straight? Or gay?

330
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,939
What do you mean?

331
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,999
I mean, is he looking
to get laid...

332
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,159
or is he looking for Mr. Right?

333
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,805
He's straight.

334
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,450
And tall.

335
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,161
"Michael Graham"
is a very tall name.

336
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,519
Goddamn it!

337
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,199
How dare you use my phone...

338
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,399
my telephone...
to call somebody who's not gay?

339
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,639
I... You can go out with any girl...
any girl in town.

340
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,411
That's right.
I go out with any girl in town.

341
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,359
- I stay in with you.
- Joe, it's not... oh, shit!

342
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,959
I'm spilling everything...
the coffee... It's all wrong.

343
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,731
Everything is all wrong.

344
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,999
That's some set of
rules you had for her.

345
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,999
Yeah, I know. I know.

346
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,771
As long as you could
get away with it, right?

347
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,439
Right.

348
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,039
I don't want to go out with Michael
Graham. I don't want to date.

349
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,879
I have no more small talk left.

350
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,679
I don't want to fool around...

351
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,879
I don't want to play games,
and I don't want to fight.

352
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,527
I just want to love you.

353
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,604
Katie...

354
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,799
I try to give you
everything I can give.

355
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,999
Oh, you give, all right...

356
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,919
presents, clothes.

357
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,839
I just wish...

358
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,646
you weren't so generous
with your cock.

359
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,963
That's good!

360
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,687
Maybe I can use that sometime.

361
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,879
Katie, about the goddamn tour...

362
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,279
I don't think you should go.

363
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,164
Wrong reading.

364
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,241
Softly and with feeling.

365
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,170
Don't go.

366
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,522
Please?

367
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,999
Why do you suppose
she put up with it?

368
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,839
Oh, I can think of many reasons
for wanting to be with you.

369
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,239

Audrey?

392
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,961
Uh, ask, uh...

393
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,967
Yeah, it's okay. Uh...

394
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,559
let me see what I can do with it.

395
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,319
I think it's just what the show needs.
It's catchy, it's bouncy. Right, Ted?

396
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,359
Yeah, it's very bouncy and catchy.

397
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,079
- Could we hear it again?
- I'd love to.

398
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,679
Oh! Arnie...

399
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,959
Turn. That is some fucking music.

400
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,519
Turn back.

401
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,959
Arch your back.
Extend the right leg.

402
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,119
Ease your partner down gently.
Slide. Slide.

403
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,481
Slide!

404
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,799
Have you ever slept
with another woman?

405
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,005
I once tried living with two
girls... two girls at once.

406
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,999
We lived together.

407
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,239
- Laughed together.
- Drank together.

408
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,439
Smoked together.

409
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,008
Slept together.

410
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,759
Woke up one morning...

411
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,399
one of them was gone.

412
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,639
On the bureau, she left a note.

413
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,519
I'm sorry.

414
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,999
I cannot share you anymore.

415
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,359
I want you all to myself...

416
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,399
or not at all.

417
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,079
Please. Please try to understand.

418
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,159
I not only understood, I...
I was flattered.

419
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,840
I was flattered that she felt
so strongly about me.

420
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:27,759
How did you know
the note was to you?

421
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,639
"No. No, that's not me,
man. No. Oh, ho-ho!

422
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,919
Somebody else, maybe, but not me."

423
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,359
- What is this, Eddie?
- Got me. Talk to him.

424
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,199
Joey, I gotta talk to you
about these time sheets.

425
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,519
Three weeks now
we've been on triple-time.

426
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,519
The brass is eating my ass out!

427
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,359
You shot 82 days
on a 65-day schedule.

428
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,519
On a four-month editing schedule,
you've gone seven months.

429
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,519
We're already two million, two
over the original budget.

430
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,919
Joey, God made
the entire world in six days.

431
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,279
He didn't go on overtime once.

432
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,399
You can't even cut
an hour-and-a-half movie...

433
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,519
in seven months, on triple-time?

434
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,679
Joey, I hate to do this.
I'm usually a very calm man...

435
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,039
but this whole thing
has got me terribly crazy.

436
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,839
I must put my foot down.
The whole thing has gotta stop.

437
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,759
It has to stop. It's got to stop!

438
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,039
It just simply must stop!

439
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,719
Josh, I made a few changes in the
monologue. I think you'll like it.

440
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,839
I have to go to rehearsal.

441
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,039
- At those prices, who can afford to live?
- See you at 5:30, Eddie.

442
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,679
Nice talking to you, Josh.

443
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,639
So I accept!

444
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,159
Oh, my God. It is better.

445
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,319
- God help us all.
- Wait a minute. Real dead body.

446
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,199
It's better.

447
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,759
Okay, that looks good. I like it.
Everybody down, in a straight line.

448
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,559
Come on. Here we go.
Move down, move down.

449
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,439
Move down, Victoria.
And sing it out. Here we go.

450
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,439
Five, six, seven, eight.

451
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,639
♪ And any seat ♪

452
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,879
♪ You grab will be first-class ♪

453
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,839
Two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. And I don't like it.

454
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,484
Uh, double that.

455
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,879
- Which button?
- The white one. Down.

456
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,719
That stinks. Let's try something
else. Do me a favor.

457
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,879
Take off your shoes.

458
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,039
What's that?

459
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,719
- It's a mint.
- Can I have one?

460
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,079
No. Come on. You wouldn't like it.

461
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,439
Let me try this.

462
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,719
Here, you stand over here and
then jump up on my shoulder.

463
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,199
God, you're getting heavy!

464
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,439
Put your leg in an arabesque.
There we are.

465
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,559
- How are things at home?
- Pretty good.

466
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,039
All right.

467
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,159
All right, watch your back, now.

468
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,959
- Anything you want to tell me?
- I promised Mom I wouldn't bring it up.

469
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,439
But you're gonna
bring it up anyway.

470
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,759
Sit down, Michelle.
You can tell me anything.

471
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,639
Gimme your wrists. Ready, and...

472
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,119
jump!

473
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,239
It's just that
I keep wondering, Dad...

474
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,759
Bend your knees.

475
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,999
What is it you keep wondering?

476
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,359
Why don't you get married again?

477
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,564
Do a head roll.

478
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,519
I don't get married again
because I can't find anyone...

479
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,599
I dislike enough...

480
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,599
to inflict that kind of torture on.

481
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,439
Hey, why don't you marry Katie?
She's terrific.

482
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,159
Keep rolling your head.

483
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,039
Straighten your leg.

484
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,919
Yeah, you're right. She's terrific.

485
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,279
That's exactly why
I don't want to marry her.

486
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,719
Run off in the corner and
jump, and I'll catch you.

487
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,239
What about Victoria?
You're not too crazy about her.

488
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,519
Just run and jump. Never mind that.

489
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,688
Come on. And...

490
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,199
- What about the blonde?
- What blonde?

491
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,999
The one in Philadelphia
with the television show?

492
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,399
You know, the one
Mom keeps talking about.

493
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,159
- Oh, yeah. That blonde.
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,359
Jump up and wrap
your legs around me.

495
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,450
Wrap around. That's it.

496
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,479
Why is it so important to you that...
Follow my hand.

497
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,559
Why is it so important
that I get married again?

498
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,039
'Cause then you'd settle down
and stop screwing around.

499
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,239
Hey! Watch your language.

500
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,159
Oh, shit!

501
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,079
- Look at the time.
- Can't we stay a little longer?

502
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,919
- No, your mother will kill me.
- It's so much fun!

503
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,239
- No. Absolutely. Come on.
- Just five minutes!

504
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,359
Stop flocking your legs. Come on!

505
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,599
- I'll get you home.
- Please?

506
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,759
No, no, no, no.

507
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,119
Besides,
if you got married again...

508
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,279
maybe you'd have a baby,
and I'd have a little brother.

509
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,599
I'll call Hertz
and rent you a brother.

510
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,929
- Very funny.
- Oh, everybody's a critic.

511
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,210
Showtime, folks.

512
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,719
Showtime.

513
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,719
Five, six, seven, eight.

514
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,199
Stop smiling. Lay back.

515
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,479
Lay back!

516
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,319
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

517
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,159
Candy, Casey, very good.
You're gonna do it again, Victoria.

518
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,239
Gary, Danny, let's go.

519
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,799
Stop smiling.
It's not the high-school play.

520
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,199
- Count.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

521
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,359
Hold it.

522
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,719
Stand on your right foot.

523
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,679
Point your left toe.

524
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,479
Drop that shoulder.

525
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,160
Now, that's not too hard, is it?

526
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,449
Again.

527
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,763
Five, six, seven, eight.

528
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,087
Lay back, Victoria.
Lay back! Lay back!

529
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,764
Hold it, hold it.

530
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,079
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're right.

531
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,799
I'm terrible. I know I'm terrible.

532
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,199
I look in the mirror,
and I'm embarrassed.

533
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,559
Maybe I should quit.
I... I just can't...

534
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,842
seem to do anything right.

535
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,848
Listen, I can't make you
a great dancer.

536
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,079
I don't even know
if I can make you a good dancer.

537
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,682
But if you keep trying
and don't quit...

538
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,926
I know I can make you
a better dancer.

539
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,247
And I... I'd like
very much to do that.

540
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,684
Stay?

541
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,842
Are you gonna keep yelling at me?

542
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,519
Probably.

543
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,639
Five, six, seven, eight.
One and two...

544
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,525
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, one, two.

545
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,399
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, one, two.

546
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,879
- Better.
- All right!

547
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,199
Breathe deep. Again.

548
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,839
Hold it.

549
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,159
All right, you can turn around now.

550
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,368
Breathe deep.

551
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,444
Again.

552
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,881
All right, you can put
your shirt on now.

553
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,919
Well, Doctor? Does he pass?

554
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,839
Good.
Now I'm worth a million dollars.

555
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,566
That's only if you die
before February 1.

556
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,479
Schedules, Goldie...
always schedules.

557
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,479
Can we take you to lunch, Doctor?

558
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,799

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,479

Nah, that's no good either.
Let's try this.

562
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,999
- There's your 412th.
- I do the same as before?

563
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,519
Yeah, same thing,

All right, let's everybody try it.

568
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,039
Grab a partner.
Sandahl, you do it alone.

569
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,439
Okay, here we go. Ready?

570
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,239

Do it again.

575
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,726
Once more, everybody.

576
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,759

Okay, once more, everybody.

582
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,759
I gotta get out of here.
I'll be back later.

583
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,407
- How does this look, Paul?
- I love it. Love it.

584
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,522
No. It's too cute.

585
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,443
Oh, shit!

586
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,282
I can't go back to that room.
I can't face those dancers.

587
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,999
I'm stuck.

588
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,559
They keep staring at me,
and nothing's coming out.

589
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,399
- Oh, boy, that number's lousy!
- My song? Lousy?

590
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,479
No, not the song. Me, me.

591
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,479
The way I'm staging it.

592
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,799
- Maybe we should cut it.
- "Cut it"?

593
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,719
I think I'll leave.

594
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,159
Paul, sit right there.

595
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,840
Go back to bar 17.

596
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,043
And...

597
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,319
Did you hear what I said?
Nothing is coming.

598
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,679
Don't worry, Paul.

599
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,079
He always says the same thing
about every number in every show.

600
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,279
How the hell do you know
what I always say?

601
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,879
Don't you think it would be
better if I stepped outside?

602
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,039
Keep playing, Paul.

603
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,279
I'm only doing this show because you want
to play that stupid 24-year-old girl.

604
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,279
I knew sooner or later
you'd say that.

605
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,959
You do think
I'm too old for the part.

606
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,999
Well, you're wrong.

607
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,599
I can play 24 years old...

608
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,079
and I'll damn well prove it.

609
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,839
You want to quit the show?
Quit the show.

610
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,479
You don't have to do
anything for me...

611
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,159
but just don't kid yourself
that you're doing this show...

612
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,959
for any other reason
except guilt about me.

613
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,686
Guilt? What guilt?

614
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,159
For never going one day
when you were faithful to me.

615
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,442
Oh. That guilt.

616
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,079
Faithful, faithful!

617
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,639
You're always talking
about being faithful.

618
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,446
Audrey, why do you think so small?

619
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,599
Besides, how do I know
you were faithful to me?

620
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,079
Oh, you know I was.

621
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,799
That's right. I know you were.

622
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,959
Oh! You meant to do that.

623
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,679
Yes, I did.

624
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,719
You kept me working all the time.

625
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,559
I never had a chance to cheat.

626
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,199
What is this big hang-up
you've got about fidelity?

627
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,279
What makes you think
that being faithful...

628
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,799
is the greatest friggin' virtue
in the world?

629
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,759
Excuse me. Well...

630
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,359
it is a great deal better
than those...

631
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,199
meaningless affairs
you keep tap-dancing through...

632
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,599
those Stacys, those Victorias.

633
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,719
You're not even fooling Michelle
with Victoria, you know.

634
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,479
Straighten that leg.

635
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,799
It is as straight as
it's ever going to get.

636
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,399
Oh! The Boonies...

637
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,719
the Wendys, the Debbies,
the Donnas...

638
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,319
I can't even remember all their
names. Give me a hand.

639
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,719
Keep playing, Paul.

640
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,079
Bet you can't either.

641
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,119
Quick, tell me: What was the name
of the girl in Philadelphia...

642
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,971
the blonde
with the television show?

643
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,679
Ah. The blonde
with the television show.

644
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,759
The blonde in Philadelphia?
I remember that girl's name.

645
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,479
I remember because
that girl meant something to me.

646
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,809
The blonde with the television
show, her name was Sweetheart.

647
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,488
- Honey?
- No.

648
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,530
Baby?

649
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,769
I can't remember her name.

650
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,079
Dorothy.

651
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,879
- Dorothy.
- Who cares?

652
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,526
I can't remember her name.

653
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,047
The number's looking good.
Keep working.

654
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,599
- Is he gonna cut the number?
- No, I don't think so, Paul.

655
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,327
He's gonna cut it.
He's gonna cut it.

656
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,999
Oh, God, that man!

657
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,479
He's gonna drive me crazy.

658
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,682
It's showtime, folks.

659
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,559
It's, uh...
It's not quite ready yet.

660
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,399
And, uh, Paul...

661
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,919
it's not exactly the way
we talked about it.

662
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,159
- Hmm?
- It's a little different.

663
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,159
- You mind doing that somewhere else?
- Sorry.

664
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,559
If you want to come in,
I'll show you in five minutes.

665
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,411

smoke, smoke.

703
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,439
The lights go down, and a
light comes up over there.

704
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,359
Welcome.

705
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,519

Remember: We can take you anywhere.

712
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,439
- They're taking their clothes off.
- Mm-hmm.

713
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,399
Just reach out your hand
and introduce yourselves.

714
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,002
- My name is Sandahl.
- My name is Autumn.

715
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,959
- My name is Jennifer.
- My name is Rima.

716
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,279
- Gary.
- John.

717
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,439
Uh-oh.

718
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,723
I think we just lost
the family audience.

719
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,159
- My name is Candace.
- My name is Jennifer.

720
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,959
- My name is Rima.
- My name is Danny.
- My name is Autumn.

721
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,239
- My name is Sandahl.
- My name is John.
- My name is Gary.

722
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,930
And don't forget about our
group fun-fun-fun plan.

723
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,402
Now Sinatra will never record it.

724
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,966
Then an actor comes out from the
side of the stage and says...

725
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,639
"Not once during any
of our flights..."

726
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,599
- Good-bye.
- See you around.

727
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,119
- Hope to see you again soon.
- It was nice to have met you.

728
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,919
- You mean a lot to me.
- Well, uh...

729
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,319
- Good-bye.
- "Our motto is...

730
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,119
'We take you everywhere
but get you nowhere."'

731
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,439
I hate to hurt his feelings...

732
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,039
- but we can't have that on a stage.
- Take five?

733
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,005
- Sure.
- Take five.

734
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,610
Well?

735
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,119
Eh, it's, um...

736
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,322
It's, uh...

737
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,359
interesting.

738
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,279
Mm, yes. Very interesting.

739
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,639
Did you like it?

740
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,605
- It's unusual.
- Mm-hmm. Very unusual.

741
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,449
Ooh, I don't think they liked it.

742
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,159
What do you think?

743
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,439
I don't know about the audiences...

744
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,564
but I think it's the best work
you've ever done.

745
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,848
You son of a bitch.

746
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,839
Jesus Christ! Sex, sex, sex!

747
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,999
Can't he ever think
of anything else but sex?

748
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,567
It's a sickness.

749
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,399
Nah. Nothing I ever do
is good enough.

750
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,799
It's not beautiful enough,
it's not funny enough...

751
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,686
it's not deep enough,
it's not anything enough.

752
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,919
Now, when I see a rose,
that's perfect.

753
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,039
I mean, that's perfect.

754
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,159
I want to look up to God and say,
"How the hell did you do that...

755
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,119
and why the hell can't I?"

756
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,719
That's probably
one of your better con lines.

757
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,519
It is, but that doesn't mean
I don't mean it.

758
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,799
If I were God...

759
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,162
sometimes I think I am...

760
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,559
Depends on the shit you're smoking.

761
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,759
If I were God, man...

762
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,079
everybody would live forever.

763
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,239
No death, man. No pennies
on the eyes for anybody.

764
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,039
You know, man, death is
really a hip thing now.

765
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,999
Death is in.

766
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,719
- Books, magazine articles, TV shows...
- It's terrific!

767
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,919
Ken and Barbie dolls
who have a mutual suicide pact.

768
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,239
Bury them in a little shoebox.
Knew a guy who bought a pair.

769
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,489
He was into doll necrophilia.

770
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,399
If it cooks!

771
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,279
All right, little thing! Whoo!

772
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,999
It's terrific!

773
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,079
There's a lady in Chicago, man,
wrote a book...

774
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,159
Dr. Kubler-Ross, with a dash.

775
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,285
This chick, man, without the
benefit of dying herself...

776
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,519
has broken the process of death
into five stages...

777
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,759
anger, denial, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

778
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,039
- That's it. Eddie.
- Kill it, Irv.

779
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,519
- Got time to make some changes?
- Not and make the screening tonight, no.

780
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,519
- I cannot believe people are gonna see this.
- Neither can I.

781
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,239
- It's a bomb.
- Really?

782
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,759
Yeah, really. You're gonna
have to make a speech.

783
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,439
Tell 'em it's a rough cut,
we're not finished yet...

784
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,639
- or any excuse you can think of.
- Why don't you tell 'em?

785
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,839
- I'm not gonna be there.
- You're not coming to the screening?

786
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,039
- Where you gonna be?
- Hiding someplace.

787
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,039
Probably vomiting or
drinking... or both.

788
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,479
We'll start recutting
Monday morning.

789
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,399
They really bought that love story?

790
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,119
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wasn't answering the phone.

791
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,279
I think they told me they liked it.

792
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,879
Just wasn't answering the phone.

793
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,399
Come on.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

794
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,119
No, I don't believe you would.

795
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,479
I'll have her home by 10:30.
Don't worry.

796
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,799
Bye.

797
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,004
Oh, shit!

798
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,679
Hello. Stacy?

799
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,079
Oh, listen. I'm sorry.
I'm in a meeting.

800
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,679
Just don't panic on the staircase.

801
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,999
At least three people said how
much they liked the screening.

802
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,079
One was my producer...

803
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,679
one was my lawyer,
and one was Michelle's mother.

804
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,679
Joe, everybody loved it.

805
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,519
We tried to tell you that last
night. You wouldn't listen.

806
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,839
That was the first R-rated movie
I ever saw, and I loved it.

807
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,679
- Did you understand it?
- Well, I understood everything...

808
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,719
except the part where the two girls
were in bed together kissing.

809
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,199
What was that supposed to mean?

810
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,039
- Is dinner ready yet?
- No.

811
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,279
- What was that supposed to mean?
- Well, Michelle...

812
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,679
uh, there are certain women who...

813
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,199
- Who...?
- Thanks a lot.

814
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,119
Yeah.

815
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,439
There are certain women who just...

816
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,039
don't relate to men, so they...

817
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,559
I think lesbian scenes
are a big turn-off.

818
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,889
You're right: I should've cut it.

819
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,611
- What's goin' on here?
- Never mind. You'll find out.

820
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,208
- Couldn't I be doin' something?
- Just sit there and turn off
the lights when we tell you.

821
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,839
- Turn on the phonograph when we tell you.
- Yes, ma'am.

822
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,928
Oh, no! No, don't...

823
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,079
- Where'd you get those hats?
- We're not telling you.

824
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,119
- That's for us to know and you to find out.
- Get back!

825
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,961
- The lights!
- Joe, could you turn off the lights?

826
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,679
Now turn on those
whatchamacallit lights.

827
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,325
Yes, ma'am.

828
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,799
Crash! Ladies and
gentlemen, in honor...

829
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,919
of "el stink-o,"
"el blotto" screening...

830
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,879
of Joe Gideon's new film,
The Stand-up...

831
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,079
we are proud to present...

832
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,279
those two dancing sensations,
Jagger and Gideon...

833
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,959
- Gideon and Jagger!...
- Gideon and Jagger!...

834
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,679
give us our music, Joe...
in an under-rehearsed tribute.

835
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,279
- Sit down, Joe.
- Sit down, Daddy.

836
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,211
And... go!

837
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,999
- I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous too.

838
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,770
- Wait for it.
- Wait for it.

875
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,521
It's showtime, folks.

876
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,239
And these two columns revolve
New York to L.A.

877
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,279
And over here on the other side,
the same thing.

878
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,319
Two staircases come down here...

879
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,839
and two more come back
into the orchestra.

880
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,439
Oh, and this centerpiece
moves out...

881
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,599
for the interior scenes...

882
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,519
and up there, that's Stan.

883
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,559
But you'll get familiar with it
when we start.

884
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,159
Okay, now, all I want to do now...

885
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,039
is to read easily
through the script...

886
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,519
and frankly, I'm not too
familiar with it myself.

887
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,839
So if we go through it...

888
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,199
you'll give Paul and me some
rough idea of what we've got.

889
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,999
Okay. No acting.

890
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,959
Everyone just take it easy. Easy.

891
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,719
All right, lights up.

892
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,039
Audrey, you have
your first number...

893
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,402
and then you begin reading
on page two.

894
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,959
"You see, Sammy, in California,
everybody needs a car.

895
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,688
I got a friend who bought a Mercedes
just to get to the bathroom."

896
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,639
"I guess only in America...

897
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,879
can a 24-year-old girl like me...

898
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,368
own a house like this
in Beverly Hills."

899
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,119
Thank you all very much.
You've done a wonderful job.

900
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,039
Take an hour and a half
for lunch. Back at 3:00.

901
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,319
Don't forget to sign
the Boston hotel list.

902
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,999
- Excuse me.
- Anything wrong?

903
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,884
No, no. Nothing.

904
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,088
- There's no use to panic till
we find out what it really is.
- Would you stop that?

905
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:26,199
Dr. Ballinger is looking at him now.
Ballinger is the best there is, Audrey.

906
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,359
- Dr. Hyman, we just left him.
- About half an hour ago.

907
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,439
- And he seemed fine.
- Just fine.

908
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,479
Well, he called. He said he had
chest pains. His left arm was numb.

909
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,162
I'm bewildered myself.
I checked him about a month ago.

910
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,239
All right, who's in charge
of this all-important...

911
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,839
million-dollar show that
Mr. Gideon keeps talking about?

912
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,639
I guess I am.

913
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,599
Mr. Gideon is having attacks of angina
that could lead to a massive coronary.

914
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,359
Ah, shit! I gotta get back.
I'm fine. What do doctors know?

915
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,119
About angina, just a little
more than show people.

916
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,079
If you want to leave, fine, but I
think you'll die. Can I see you?

917
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,930
Dr. Hyman?

918
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,159
The pain is gone. Nothing wrong
with me a rewrite wouldn't cure.

919
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,399
- Couple of good jokes is what I need.
- You can't leave now.

920
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,919
- Yes, I can.
- Damn it, Joe!

921
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,879
Didn't you hear
what the doctor just said?

922
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,128
Please, stay.

923
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,479
Joey, I've been talking
to Dr. Ballinger...

924
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,519
Jonesy, wait a minute.
Let me talk to the star here.

925
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,079
If I stay, how much time
are we talking about?

926
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,759
At least two or three weeks.

927
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,879
You've got to be kidding!

928
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,919
I got a show to put on!

929
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,239
For chrissakes, will you
talk to these people?

930
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,319
They don't understand anything!

931
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,319
Oh, Jesus.

932
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,719
- What's wrong?
- Miss Collins.

933
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,359
- All right, easy.
- Damn it.

934
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,679
You guys are doing this to me.

935
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,959
I wasn't sick until I got here.

936
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,164
- What's wrong with him?
- It's exhaustion.

937
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,728
You're lying to me.

938
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,444
Yes.

939
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,479
Uh, no, I'm not a member
of his immediate family.

940
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,959
I'm, uh... I'm his girlfriend.

941
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,719
Well, could I leave a message
for him, please?

942
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,446
Could you tell him that... Hello?

943
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,879
It was just simply exhaustion.

944
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,759
He just tried to do too much.

945
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,119
Anyway...

946
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,799
we've made a decision to postpone
the show for four months.

947
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:46,439
- The doctors assured us Joe will be fine.
- There goes my new apartment.

948
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,439
Therefore the show will
definitely be done. I promise.

949
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,839
Now, we're aware of the...

950
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,479
- financial burdens this might impose...
- I gave up a TV series.

951
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,879
- On some of you, and...
- What a dummy.

952
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,999
We're prepared to try to get you...

953
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,799
temporary jobs,
or even lend you money.

954
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,399
Jonesy, easy on the money,
easy on the money.

955
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,809
All right, Larry. All right, okay.

956
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,919
We don't have
a lot of cash available, but...

957
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,959
what I'd like to say to you is...

958
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,119
I... we...

959
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,359
think of you all as family.

960
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,239
- Bullshit.
- And we want to do...

961
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,599
everything we possibly can...

962
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,039
to keep you all together.

963
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,559
I was with him last night.
Already he's much better.

964
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,919
I just left him an hour ago.

965
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,519
He was in a great mood...
making jokes...

966
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,639
making passes at all the nurses...

967
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,039
and he told me to tell all of
you he has a terrific idea...

968
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,479
- for a new hospital number.
- Hold it, Audrey!

969
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,039
Hospital number, hospital number!

970
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,239
Just give me a minute. Stan,
will you give me some room?

971
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,399
- How does the title "Hospital Hop" grab you?
- It grabs me.

972
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,648
Great, great.

973
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,039
- I think I got it. I got it!
- I think he's got it!

974
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,519
Stan, help me out, please.

975
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,326
Clap your hands!

976
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,919
Cheer up!

977
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,487
Let's go! Everybody!

978
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,919
And Lucas...

979
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,599
they are without question
an absolutely...

980
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,639
marvelous cast.

981
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,839
Now we gotta wait around
four months.

982
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,999
Maybe even lose them.

983
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,039
I can see where it'd be difficult
to hold a cast like that together.

984
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,479
It's really a shame.

985
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,199
And, of course,
even after four months...

986
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,839
a heart attack...

987
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,679
There's no guarantee
that he'll be able to work.

988
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,639
None.

989
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,366
Jules, it's still too bright.

990
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,079
- Take number seven down to five...
- And he's the greatest.

991
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,328
- And eight down to two.
- Hmm.

992
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,639
And Lucas,
I think we have a sure hit.

993
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,079
A sure hit.

994
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,044
Reads like a dream.

995
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,799
I'd love to read it sometime.

996
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,679
I'll get a copy to you
this afternoon.

997
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,724
Oh, I forgot. Wait a minute.

998
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,159
I've got one right here with me.

999
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,567
Dimmer five up to three.

1000
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,479
Hold that. That's good.

1001
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,279
I know you couldn't care less
about the money.

1002
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:50,199
- Hmm?
- What do you think about this, Lucas?

1003
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,402
Is it any better?

1004
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,879
No. No, no.
It needs to be more... shadowy.

1005
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,999
We talked about this, Jules.

1006
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,239
It's a seduction scene.

1007
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,091
Take the shadow lights to half.

1008
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,999
How much, uh... is Joe getting?

1009
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,239
Five percent of the gross
until payoff.

1010
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,799
Then he goes to six percent. Twenty
percent of subsidiary rights...

1011
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,083
- including a movie sale.
- Thanks. That's good.

1012
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,079
Well...

1013
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,409
of course my schedule's
impossible, but, uh...

1014
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,319
you know how I feel
about you, Jonesy.

1015
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,399
You've been like a father to me.

1016
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,967
And you a son to me.

1017
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,999
I always look for the
worst in people.

1018
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,919
A piece of you in them?

1019
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,479
Yeah. A piece of me.

1020
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,599
And generally, I find it.

1021
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,439
Well, it may take you years,
but you'll find it.

1022
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,962
Oh, you're cute. You are cute.

1023
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,599
It's looking better.

1024
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,759
I think we'll move you upstairs
to a private room.

1025
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,959
Oh, yeah.

1026
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,559
But you better rest. If you
don't, you're in for trouble.

1027
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,799
Oh, I will, Doctor.

1028
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,971
I promise. I will.

1029
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,924
Mr. Gideon!

1030
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,399
Mr. Gideon, what are you doing?

1031
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,759
Oh, this?
I was just getting rid of it.

1032
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,279
I caught someone smoking and told
him a man in my condition...

1033
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,479
shouldn't even be around smoke.

1034
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,199
I'm telling you, Gideon,
I got real insight into you.

1035
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,039
There's a deep-rooted fear
of being conventional.

1036
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,083
Right.

1037
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,359
Your blood pressure
is higher than we hoped.

1038
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,359
Your cardiograms
haven't improved one bit.

1039
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,564
If you don't give a damn,
it's hard to expect us to.

1040
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,969
Mr. Gideon!

1041
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,079
I'll leave these menus with you.

1042
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,279
Please check off what you want
for the coming weeks, okay?

1043
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,399
Monday, I'll have roast beef. Tuesday,
chicken. Wednesday, steak.

1044
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,519
Thursday I plan to be dead, so...
I'll just have something light.

1045
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,210
Mr. Gideon!

1046
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,119
She wrote a little note on the back.
She said you'd understand.

1047
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,999
"Dear loving, giving, generous"...

1048
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,559
underlined four times... "Dad...

1049
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,759
I hear nurses are nice people.
Hint, hint.

1050
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,439
Your poor, brother-less daughter."

1051
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,007
Joe, what does it mean?

1052
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,959
It means she's inherited
her mother's determination.

1053
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,039
That's what it means.

1054
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,119
Oh, no. Thank you. No, no, no, no.

1055
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,399
You're wonderful, wonderful.
The word "superstar"...

1056
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,599
is greatly overused
in this business.

1057
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,359
- Mm.
- But for my next guest...

1058
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,079
the word "superstar"
is totally inadequate.

1059
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,599
Whenever I do a benefit... and I've
done 150, 160, 170 this year...

1060
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,639
all for very worthy causes...
I can always count on this dude...

1061
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,799
to be right there with me.

1062
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,919
I feel humbled in his presence.

1063
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,119
From deep, deep in here,
ladies and gentlemen...

1064
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,519
- let me lay on you...
- A great entertainer.

1065
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,559
- A great entertainer...
- A great humanitarian.

1066
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,039
- A great humanitarian...
- And my dear friend for 25 years.

1067
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,519
And my dearest, dearest friend
for20years...

1068
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,919
You missed by five years.

1069
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,199
Oh, boy, do I hate show business.

1070
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,319
Joey, you love show business.

1071
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,047
That's right. I love show business.
I'll go either way.

1072
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,479
I got insight into you, Gideon.

1073
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,679
You know what's underneath?

1074
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,759
The dreadful fear
that you're ordinary...

1075
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,759
not special.

1076
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,883
Right.

1077
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,999
I think...

1078
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,999
I think...

1079
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,799
I'm getting an erection.

1080
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,402
Oh, Mr. Gideon, don't...
don't do that!

1081
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,119
That sex thing... Jesus!

1082
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,719
Listen, I wouldn't say
you were a faggot...

1083
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,999
but you do have a lot
of feminine characteristics.

1084
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,770
Right?

1085
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,679
Right.

1086
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,042
You are foolishly and childishly
flirting with disaster.

1087
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,559
Joe, what are you doing?

1088
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,809
You're really crazy! What do
you want to do, kill yourself?

1089
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,766
Dr. Ballinger told me
to get a little exercise.

1090
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,239
Everything he does seems to be
a denial of his condition.

1091
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,879
Dr. Ballinger, every time I've
seen him, I get the impression...

1092
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,999
that he doesn't care
whether he lives or dies.

1093
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,959
Yes, I know.
But I think he cares a lot.

1094
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,919
Starting now, we'll limit his
visitors to no more than two.

1095
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,319
Joe, I wish you could
have been there.

1096
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,239
9:30 this morning, before a
single review was out...

1097
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:20,239
the line at Cinema One
was around the block.

1098
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,039
The people know.
I mean, the people know!

1099
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,839
This broke every first-day record.
It's a blockbuster. A blockbuster.

1100
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,359
I mean a blockbuster!

1101
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,279
And those guys in California...

1102
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,439
You wouldn't believe
the telephone calls.

1103
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,199
"Congratulations," they say.
"We're glad you took your time.

1104
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,479
It was worth it.

1105
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,839
Every dollar we put in that film
is up there on the screen."

1106
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,879
I'm telling you, they're talking about
a $ 3 1/2 million advertising budget.

1107
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,199
Three and a half million dollars!

1108
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,679
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Do you believe that?

1109
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,679
Three and a half million dollars!

1110
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,039
This picture is going
right through the roof.

1111
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,279
Right through...

1112
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,959
the roof!

1113
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,279
Look at those reviews.
See? We did it.

1114
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,359
Joe, we did it!

1115
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,479
Where are the bad ones?

1116
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,839
There are no bad ones.

1117
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,959
Josh.

1118
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,959
There were a couple that quibbled
a little. I left them at the office.

1119
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:23,879
I want you to do me a favor:
Don't show them to me.

1120
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,559
Never.

1121
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,319
- How were the television reviews?
- I think we got Leslie Perry.

1122
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,799
At the screening,
she told me she loved it.

1123
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,479
Following Joe Gideon's triumphant
directorial achievement...

1124
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,879
with Fifty Beautiful
Girls, Fifty...

1125
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,039
when he won every possible award...

1126
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,759
it would be nice to report that
Mr. Gideon's latest effort...

1127
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,999
The Stand-up, starring
Davis Newman...

1128
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,799
was a better film.

1129
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,039
- Oh, boy. Here it comes.
- The Stand-up, however,
does not quite stand up.

1130
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,359
- Joey, turn it off, please.
- Leaning toward the frenetic, Gideon falls...

1131
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,879
into his characteristic weakness
of trying too hard...

1132
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,359
- to please, to entertain.
- I'm gonna turn that off.

1133
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,119
- Josh, no. I want to hear it.
- Slickness obscures reality.

1134
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,279
- The old razzle-dazzle obliterates drama.
- What the hell does she know?

1135
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,719
She never gave anything
a good review.

1136
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,879
That woman is totally unqualified
to criticize anything.

1137
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,199
She doesn't know
a goddamn thing about film.

1138
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,879
- Or anything.
- She's not even reviewing a film.

1139
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,039
She's telling you
how clever she is!

1140
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,839
where the has-been comic, played
impeccably by Davis Newman...

1141
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,239
demonstrates
his former brilliance...

1142
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,679
in a monologue where clearly...

1143
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,239
director Gideon gave
Mr. Newman free rein.

1144
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,799
Rising above
rather commonplace material...

1145
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,439
- the actor creates a classic comic aura...
- I don't care what she says.

1146
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,759
I guarantee this picture will do
30 million domestic, at least.

1147
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,039
- One of you better get somebody.
- What?

1148
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,159
I think I'm in trouble.

1149
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,399
- I'll get somebody.
- ...chopping offends of scenes
before the drama has played out...

1150
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,759
left this reviewer
with bewilderment...

1151
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,999
and a four-aspirin headache.

1152
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,279
Using my four-balloon
rating system...

1153
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,609
I give The Stand-up half a balloon.

1154
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,679
- How are you feeling?
- The truth?

1155
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,679
I'm scared.

1156
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,519
Roll 'em. Action.

1157
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,451
Oh-ho-ho-ho, my God.

1158
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,559
Ladies and gentlemen, the doctors.

1159
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,239
I'm Dr. Hyman, the internist.

1160
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,439
I'm Dr. Garry, the surgeon.

1161
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,159
- I'm Dr. Ballinger, the cardiologist.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

1162
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,409
ALL EXPLAINING CARDIOLOGY:
VOICES OVERLAPPING

1163
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,849
Huh?

1164
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,559
That means he had total blockage...

1165
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:07,479
in... two arteries.

1166
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,959
Oh!

1167
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,839
This is the man
who would be my first choice...

1168
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,679
as a modern-day saint.

1169
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,919
When I was in those marches,
like Selma...

1170
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,559
this brother was shufflin'
right alongside me...

1171
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,199
long before those other cats who thought
civil rights was a hip scene...

1172
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,719
and jumped on the "blackwagon"...

1173
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,599
The blackwagon!

1174
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,559
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me lay on ya...

1175
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,839
- A great entertainer.
- a great entertainer...

1176
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,839
- A great humanitarian.
- a great humanitarian...

1177
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,359
- And my dearest friend.
- and my dearest, dearest friend...

1178
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,599
- For years.
- for 17years.

1179
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,519
Let's hear it...

1180
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,119
- See how much I learn from you?
- I'm afraid you've learned too much.

1181
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,039
There you are, Mr. Gideon.
This is one of my...

1182
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,359
A1, first-rate, top-drawer jobs.

1183
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,559
That's it.

1184
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,922
Good luck tomorrow.

1185
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,799
Wh-What did you mean,
I learned too much from you?

1186
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,519
You're gonna make it.
I'm hardly ever wrong.

1187
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,926
Thanks.

1188
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,479
You remember last Tuesday night?

1189
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,479
It was raining...

1190
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,599
very hard.

1191
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,565
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was raining.
What about it?

1192
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,251
I called you at midnight.

1193
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,891
I must have been walking the dog.

1194
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,966
I don't have time
for this sort of thing.

1195
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,288
You were with someone.

1196
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,970
Yes.

1197
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,602
And you made love to him.

1198
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,770
Yeah.

1199
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,759
Well, that's it, huh?

1200
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,645
- We're finished?
- I don't know.

1201
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,802
How do you feel about me?

1202
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,639
I love you.

1203
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,491
Then I guess we're not finished.

1204
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,330
Be-Because I really do
love you, Katie.

1205
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,119
- You mean that?
- Ah, hell, no!

1206
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,759
I was pissed off at her.

1207
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,559
I don't know.

1208
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,279
Yeah, I did mean it. Sort of.

1209
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,802
Sometimes I don't know where the
bullshit ends and the truth begins.

1210
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,319
I just wanted to say
something nice to her.

1211
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,279
Why?

1212
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,404
In case, uh...

1213
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,242
"In case."

1214
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,761
In case.

1215
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,719
If I die...

1216
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,879
I'm sorry for all...

1217
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,679
the bad things I did to you.

1218
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,719
And if I live...

1219
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,919
I'm sorry for all the bad things...

1220
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,487
I'm gonna do to you.

1221
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,959
as stated in the declarations,
sustained directly and solely...

1222
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,839
as the result of injury, sickness,
death of, or permanent disability...

1223
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,519
Excuse me, Mr. Clark.

1224
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,690
Larry, give me our figures.

1225
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:41,199
Well, on an estimated
production budget...

1226
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,039
of $941,000...

1227
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:48,199
with a contingency of 59,000 to
round it out to the million...

1228
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,959
so far we're in for at least
two-thirds of the fees.

1229
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,199
Design: 8,000. Costumes: 8,000.

1230
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,199
Electrics: 4,000.

1231
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,999
We're in for the full
director-choreographer: 15,000.

1232
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,919
Casting is another four.

1233
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,239
Construction of scenery...

1234
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,399
where more than half
has been done...

1235
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,399
that's 125,000-plus.

1236
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,559
Stage manager's about 8, 000.

1237
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,959
Press agent: 1,500.

1238
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,719
Musicians: about two.

1239
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:24,959
Assistants, secretaries,
et cetera: 3,000.

1240
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,359
Rehearsal halls
and auditions: 9,500.

1241
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,319
Script and administrative: 1,500.

1242
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,199
Managers: I'd say 10.

1243
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,839
Advertising and printing:
about 20, 000.

1244
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:43,090
Orchestrations:
so far around 10,000.

1245
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,959
Legal: 10,000. Auditing: 2,000.

1246
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,079
Payroll taxes: maybe seven.

1247
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,679
Well, seven.

1248
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,119
Author's advances: 10,000.
Equity bonds: 50,000.

1249
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:01,799
Rehearsal salaries... and we've made
some advances to a few of the cast...

1250
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,999
about 43,000.

1251
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,959
We're in for about, uh...

1252
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,559
$480,500.

1253
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,199
Yes.

1254
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,199
That's the figure I had here.

1255
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,289
And change.

1256
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,719
Let me try to understand.

1257
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,799
Of that figure,
how much do we recoup?

1258
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,399
I'm confused too. Do we get
all of that or part or what?

1259
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,279
Simply, here are the options. One:

1260
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,199
If Mr. Gideon recovers...

1261
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,559
and you resume production
within the 180 days...

1262
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,399
we are not liable for any of it.

1263
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,799
Two: If Mr. Gideon should die...

1264
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,959
and you resume production with another
director within the 180 days...

1265
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,119
we are still not liable.

1266
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,959
Three, however:

1267
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,079
If Mr. Gideon should expire
before February 1...

1268
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,759
and you abandon production...

1269
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,119
we are liable
for the full million dollars.

1270
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,519
This means, gentlemen...

1271
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:01,041
you could make a profit of...

1272
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,887
$519,500.

1273
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,599
You could be
the first show on Broadway...

1274
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,043
to make a profit
without really opening.

1275
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,889
Well...

1276
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,051
it's all very clear to me.

1277
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,199
There's all this bullshit
about death with dignity.

1278
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,439
You know what death
with dignity is, man?

1279
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,959
You don't drool.

1280
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,599

Yes, you are alive.

Miss Paris, would you like
to see something nice?

Oh, that is beautiful!

1410
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:23,639
That is an absolutely
beautiful scar, Dr. Garry.

1411
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,239
- Mm. Thank you.
- How soon do you think he'll be able to work?

1412
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:31,079
Well, he's out of intensive
care, back in a private room.

1413
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,519
The doctor says
it's just a matter of rest.

1414
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:37,439
Two months at the outside.

1415
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,599
You know Joey. This morning
he said he could hardly wait.

1416
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,119
Said he had a lot of new ideas.

1417
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,799
Mm. And not
all that sex stuff, either.

1418
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,399
Well, that's terrific.

1419
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,879
You must feel really good
about that, Jonesy.

1420
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,439
Relieved. We're all relieved.

1421
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,239
Check, please.

1422
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:00,999
I did some thinking about your
script and made a few notes.

1423
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,879
Ah! My.

1424
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,880
Use them, don't use them...
you know, whatever you want.

1425
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:13,239
I hate to bother you,
but are you... Lucas Sergeant?

1426
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,559
- Yes.
- Would you mind?

1427
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,967
No, no. Not at all.

1428
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:23,570
I'm an actress, and next to Joe
Gideon, you're my favorite director.

1429
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,405
I'm so sorry your show was a flop.

1430
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,089
- Best of luck with your career.
- Thank you so much.

1431
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,199
Lucas, you put in
an awful lot of work on this.

1432
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,879
I'm moved.

1433
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:45,719
- Yoo-hoo! Teddy!
- For somebody to do something like this just...

1434
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,599
just out of friendship,
it touches me.

1435
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,199
Listen, what are friends for?
We're all rooting for each other.

1436
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,639
I'm just pleased
that Joe is well again.

1437
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:58,764
- Let me get this.
- No, Lucas. This is on me.

1438
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,128
I said I'll get this.

1439
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,159
I can't believe it.

1440
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,839
Joe, what's the matter?

1441
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,519
I'm having a heart attack.

1442
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,639
No, that's impossible, Mr. Gideon.

1443
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,719
I just gave you your medication.

1444
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,239
Goddamn it, he knows the symptoms!

1445
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,279
Will you call somebody, please?

1446
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,319
He can't be in pain...

1447
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,559
- but let me take his pulse.
- How can it be?

1448
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,159
Goddamn it, get somebody!

1449
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:32,599
But I just gave you
your medication 20 minutes ago.

1450
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,319
You can't possibly be in pain.

1451
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,999
At least you're getting
use out of the equipment.

1452
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,279
That's funny, Doctor.

1453
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,879
I gotta tell you,
it hurts like a son of a bitch.

1454
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,519
Miss Briggs, two milligrams
of morphine, please.

1455
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,599
- What's this?
- That's my name and address.

1456
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,326
You can send my check there.

1457
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,599
Feeling any pain now?

1458
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,719
- Bitch!
- What?
- No.

1459
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:01,039
But something is... something
is breaking up in there.

1460
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,322
Now, that I like.

1461
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,719
Something's gone wrong.

1462
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:10,199
All wrong.

1463
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,846
No.

1464
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,119
- No.
- Oh, my God.

1465
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,879
Where's Mr. Gideon?

1466
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,199
Anger, denial, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

1467
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,559
- Anger.
- No. No.

1468
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,919
- No! Not now.
- "Jesus Christ!

1469
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,319
Goddamn son of a bitch,
pig-fucking bastards!"

1470
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:34,599
- Not now.
- I don't know.

1471
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:39,044
We were busy with an emergency, and the
next thing I noticed, he was gone.

1472
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:43,919
Denial? Denial?

1473
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,879
"No. No, that's not me, man. No.
Oh, ho-ho!

1474
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,919
No, somebody else, maybe,
but not me. Oh, no.

1475
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,519
You got the wrong...
How about my mother, man?

1476
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,559
She's old. I'm weaned.
I'm toilet-trained.

1477
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,319
I don't need her anymore...
'Bye, Ma. You've been terrific.

1478
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,519
I love ya! But not me. "'

1479
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:05,566
Oh, Jesus, don't take me out now.

1480
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,199
What's the matter?

1481
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,599
Don't you like musical comedy?

1482
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,759
Bargaining.

1483
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,439
Finished, or do you
want to run it again?

1484
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,959
Yes, I'd like to run it again.

1485
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,686
I'd like to run
the whole thing again.

1486
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,319
"Look, man, can we... Come here.

1487
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:30,399
Can we sit down and talk
about this like businessmen?

1488
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,719
A negotiation, okay?
Look, I don't want to haggle.

1489
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:36,239
You'll find me
a reasonable man, man.

1490
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:39,399
The blonde on East 63rd Street
I see on Tuesday nights?

1491
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,039
Right? Gone. Finished.
I'll never see her again.

1492
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,039
That's it.

1493
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,239
All right, no more hard drugs.

1494
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,839
A little grass, maybe,
but that's it. Okay?

1495
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,279
I promise I won't flash
on subways anymore, okay?

1496
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:56,927
We got a deal? Huh? Huh? Huh?"
Guy drives a hard bargain.

1497
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:02,039
What are you staring at?
I told you guys before...

1498
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,119
too much smoking, too much boozing,

1499
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:07,439
too much screwing around,
it'll get you every time.

1500
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,079
I'll be back.

1501
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,759
Well, goddamn it, find him!

1502
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:18,919
I want him back in ICU,
and right now! Damn fools!

1503
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,599
Depression.

1504
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:24,919
And here he is, ladies and
germs, tops in taps...

1505
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:28,919
- Oh, my God!
- tap dancer extraordinaire.

1506
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,399
- If I were God...
- "I'm dying!

1507
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:35,079
- And sometimes I think I am...
- Oh, God, am I dying!

1508
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:40,119
- Depends on how much morphine I've had...
- I'm dying! Nobody's dying but me!

1509
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:44,839
- I would spare this terrific tap dancer!
- The doctor's not dying.

1510
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,964
He's alive in Florida,
and I'm dying!"

1511
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,131
No pennies on the eyes for me.

1512
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,999
Please.

1513
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,719
Right away, sir. Bye.

1514
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,559
Come on, we better try
to find this guy.

1515
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:06,319
"Oh, God!

1516
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:09,359
I'm dying!

1517
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:13,610
I'm paying $240 a day
for the hospital room!

1518
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,159
At those prices, man,
who can afford to live?"

1519
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,522
So...

1520
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,128
acceptance.

1521
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,684
Oh, God!

1522
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,966
I think you're the most
beautiful thing in the world.

1523
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,323
And I love you.

1524
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,719
Just a cut on the head.

1525
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,919
Man, I won't have any trouble
at all keeping him here.

1526
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,279
He just wants to sit around
and sing old-time songs.

1527
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:45,280
Don't hurry, baby. I'm having
a pretty good time myself.

1528
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,879

Eh, just found out. They're
coming to get you, you know.

1531
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,559
I knew they would.
Can I have another?

1532
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:59,922
Oh, help yourself.

1533
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:06,239
Could you do it one more time?
Just for me?

1534
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:09,119

Wonderful, wonderful.

1558
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,519
Folks, what can I tell you
about my next guest?

1559
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,599
This cat allowed himself...

1560
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,039
to be adored but not loved...

1561
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,599
and his success
in show business was matched...

1562
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,039
by failure in his
personal-relationship bag.

1563
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,159
That's where he really bombed.

1564
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:49,399
And he came to believe
that work, show business...

1565
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,839
love, his whole life,
even himself...

1566
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,039
and all that jazz was bullshit.

1567
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,519
He became numero uno game player...

1568
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,919
to the point
where he didn't know...

1569
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,999
where the games ended
and the reality began.

1570
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,519
Like, to this cat,
the only reality...

1571
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,559
is death, man.

1572
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,719
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me lay on you...

1573
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,879
a so-so entertainer,
not much of a humanitarian...

1574
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,439
and this cat
was never nobody's friend.

1575
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,519
In his final appearance
on the great stage of life...

1576
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,639
