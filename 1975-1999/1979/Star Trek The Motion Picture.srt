1
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
Tactical!

2
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Visual!

3
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
Prepare torpedos!

4
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
Attention!

5
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Fire!

6
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Evade

7
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,920
This is com station Epsilon 9
calling USS Columbia.

8
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,680
Come in, Columbia.
Respond, please.

9
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,960
This is Scout Columbia, Epsilon 9.
Could you boost your transmission?

10
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,480
This is Epsilon 9, Columbia.

11
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,080
Am boosting output.
How read you this?

12
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,600
Fine, fine. Thank you, Epsilon 9.
Receiving your transmission.

13
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,040
Scout Columbia, NCC-621...

14
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,520
to rendezvous with
Scout Revere, NCC-595...

15
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
on stardate 7411.4.

16
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,680
Further orders
will be relayed at that time.

17
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,280
Signed Commodore Prober
to Starfleet.

18
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,200
- End of transmission.
- Received. Thank you.

19
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,440
Our sensor drone is
intercepting this on Quad L-1 4.

20
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?

21
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,360
Unknown, Sir.

22
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
I have an exterior visual.

23
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,100
Attention!

24
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Fire!

25
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,240
We've plotted a course
on that cloud, Commander.

26
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,320
It will pass into Federation space
fairly close to us.

27
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
Heading?

28
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,640
Sir, it's on a precise
heading for Earth.

29
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,840
Commander Sonak.

30
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,040
You received your appointment
as Enterprise science officer?

31
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,040
Based, I am told, on your
recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.

32
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
Then why aren't you aboard?

33
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,920
Captain Decker requested I complete
final science briefing here before...

34
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,520
- Here?
- we leave on our mission.

35
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
At Starfleet?

36
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,720
The Enterprise is in
final preparation to leave dock.

37
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,680
Which will require
20 more hours at minimum...

38
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,480
Twelve.

39
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura...

40
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
which will not last
more than three minutes.

41
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,480
Report to me on the Enterprise
in one hour.

42
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,560
Report to you, Sir?

43
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,280
It is my intention to be
on that ship following that meeting.

44
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,200
Report to me in one hour.

45
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
- Admiral!
- Mr. Scott.

46
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,520
Those departure orders... 12 hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.

47
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Why aren't the Enterprise
transporters operating, Mr. Scott?

48
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,760
A wee problem, Sir.
Just temporary.

49
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,080
Admiral, we have just
finished 18 months...

50
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,960
redesigning and refitting
the Enterprise.

51
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
How in hell do they expect me
to have her ready in 12 hours?

52
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,520
Take me over, please.

53
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,200
She needs more work, Sir.
A shakedown!

54
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,760
Mr. Scott, an alien object of
unbelievable destructive power...

55
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,440
is less than three days away
from this planet.

56
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,200
The only starship in interception
range is the Enterprise.

57
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Ready or not,
she launches in 12 hours.

58
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,640
The crew haven't had
near enough transition time...

59
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
with all the new equipment.

60
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,280
And the engines...
They're not even tested at warp power.

61
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
And an untried Captain.

62
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,440
Two-and-a-half years as
chief of Starfleet Operations...

63
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
may have made me
a little stale, but I...

64
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,640
wouldn't exactly
consider myself untried.

65
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,640
- They gave her back to me, Scotty.
- Gave her back, Sir?

66
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,960
I doubt it was that easy
with Nogura.

67
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,640
You're right.

68
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,560
Well, any man who could
manage such a feat...

69
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,400
I would not dare disappoint.

70
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,200
She'll launch on time, Sir,
and she'll be ready.

71
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,280
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
- Aye, Sir.

72
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,800
Cargo bay to launch crew.

73
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,560
A travel pod is now
available at dock 6.

74
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,440
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.

75
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,000
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

76
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,280
Commander Scott, you're needed
in Engineering immediately.

77
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,160
Sir, you'll excuse me.

78
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,720
Flight deck, prepare
for an incoming shuttlecraft.

79
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you...

80
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
I think I can find
my way, Ensign.

81
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,920
Aye, Sir.

82
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
Bridge.

83
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,920
What's the problem?

84
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
I thought you people had
that circuit patched in an hour ago.

85
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,760
We did. We had to disconnect it.

86
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,960
All right. Take out...

87
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,440
It's going to take us longer
that way. We're trying to save time.

88
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,520
I'm still waiting for a check
on the line. What's holding it up?

89
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,920
As soon as somebody
can get to it.

90
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,800
What's the next program?

91
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,920
I'll get somebody down there
as soon as I can, Cleary.

92
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,640
My people are all tied up now.

93
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,080
Captain! Starfleet just signaled
your transfer of command orders.

94
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,240
- Captain.
- I appreciate the welcome.

95
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
I wish the circumstances
were less critical.

96
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,400
Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

97
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,720
Aye, Sir.

98
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,280
- Where's Captain Decker?
- He's in Engineering, Sir.

99
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,880
He... He doesn't know.

100
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,200
- Mr. Chekov.
- Aye, Sir.

101
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,960
Assemble the crew on
the recreation deck at 0400 hours.

102
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,720
I want to show them
what we're facing.

103
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,520
Check Cleary on number six.

104
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,440
- Need your cooler status.
- Stand by.

105
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,240
Space matrix restoration coils.
Dilithium crystals.

106
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,520
I knew it. The transporter sensor
was not activated.

107
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,080
Air equalization.
Automatic off.

108
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,360
Faulty module.

109
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,120
Cleary, put a new backup sensor
into the unit.

110
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,640
Aye, Sir.

111
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,960
Admiral Kirk! Well,
we're getting a top brass send-off.

112
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,320
Don't worry,
she'll launch on schedule...

113
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,560
if we have to tow her out
with our bare hands, right, Scotty?

114
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,480
Aye. That we will, Sir.

115
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,600
- Let's talk.
- Sure.

116
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,000
Let me know
when that backup's ready.

117
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,200
All due respect, I hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

118
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,080
- I'm really too busy.
- I'm taking over the center seat.

119
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,960
You're what?

120
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,560
I'm replacing you as Captain
of the Enterprise.

121
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,760
You'll stay on
as executive officer.

122
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,360
Temporary grade reduction
to Commander.

123
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,640
You personally
are assuming command?

124
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,160
Yeah.

125
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,440
- May I ask why?
- My experience.

126
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,440
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

127
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
My familiarity with
the Enterprise and its crew.

128
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,800
Admiral, this is an almost
totally new Enterprise.

129
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
You don't know her a tenth
as well as I do.

130
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,040
That's why you're staying aboard.

131
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,640
I'm sorry, Will.

132
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,360
No, Admiral,
I don't think you're sorry.

133
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,560
Not one damn bit.

134
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,360
I remember when you recommended me
for this command.

135
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,720
You told me how envious you were
and how much you hoped...

136
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,960
you'd find a way to get
a starship command again.

137
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,520
Well, Sir,
it looks like you found a way.

138
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,200
Report to the bridge,
Commander, immediately.

139
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,640
Aye, Sir.

140
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,800
Transporter room!
Come in! Urgent!

141
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
Redline on the transporter,
Mr. Scott!

142
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,920
Transporter, do not engage!

143
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,880
-It's too late. They're beaming now.
- Do not...

144
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,600
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it! Pull them back!

145
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,560
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.

146
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,960
Give it to me.

147
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,080
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

148
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,480
More signal!

149
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
- We're losing their pattern!
- Oh, no, they're forming.

150
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Oh my God.

151
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,080
Starfleet, do you have them?

152
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,320
Enterprise, what we got back
didn 't live long, fortunately.

153
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,320
Starfleet, Kirk.

154
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,080
Please express my condolences
to their families.

155
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,720
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan embassy.

156
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,440
There was nothing
you could have done, Rand.

157
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,160
It wasn't your fault.

158
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,600
Yeoman, turboshaft 8?

159
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,480
Back that way, Sir.

160
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,040
We have to replace
Commander Sonak.

161
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,680
I'd still like a Vulcan there,
if possible.

162
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,120
None available, Captain.

163
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,400
In fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

164
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
You are, Mr. Decker.

165
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm afraid you're going to have
to double as science officer.

166
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
That's all we know about it...

167
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,720
except that it is now
53.4 hours away from Earth.

168
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,480
Enterprise is the only Federation
starship that stands in its way.

169
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,280
Our orders are to intercept...

170
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,520
investigate and take
whatever action is necessary...

171
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,280
and possible.

172
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,920
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon 9.

173
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,840
- Put it on viewer.
- On viewer, Sir.

174
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,240
Enterprise, the cloud is definitely
a power field of some kind.

175
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,640
Measures... My God...
over eight two AU's in diameter.

176
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,400
Must be something incredible
inside there generating it.

177
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,240
We're transmitting lingua code
friendship messages...

178
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,000
on all frequencies.

179
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,960
No response.

180
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,880
have a null reading
at the center of the cloud.

181
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,440
Definitely something inside there,
but scans are being reflected back.

182
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,960
- Some kind of power surge.
- Receiving an odd pattern now.

183
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,160
Enterprise, they could be mistaking
our scans as a hostile act.

184
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
They seem to be reactingto our scans, Sir.

185
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,000
Deflectors, emergency full!

186
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,920
- We are under attack.
- External view.

187
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,280
Viewer off.

188
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Viewer off.

189
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,080
Prelaunch countdown
will commence in 40 minutes.

190
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,880
Transporter system fully repaired
and functioning normally, Sir.

191
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,360
Dock signals clear, Captain.

192
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,080
Reply we are holding position,
awaiting final crew replacements.

193
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,040
Aye, Sir.

194
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,680
Transporter personnel reports...

195
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,400
the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia...

196
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,680
She's already aboard
and en route to the bridge, Sir.

197
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,360
She's Deltan, Captain.

198
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,480
Lieutenant Ilia
reporting for duty, Sir.

199
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,440
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

200
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,920
- Hello, Ilia.
- Decker.

201
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,520
I was stationed on the lieutenant's
home planet some years ago.

202
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,680
Commander Decker?

203
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,520
Yes, our exec and science officer.

204
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,960
Captain Kirk has
the utmost confidence in me.

205
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,120
And in you, too, Lieutenant.

206
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,560
My oath of celibacy
is on record, Captain.

207
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,040
- May I assume my duties?
- By all means.

208
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,600
Starfleet reports our last six
crew members are ready to beam up...

209
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,160
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

210
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh? I'll see to it
that he beams up.

211
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,720
Transporter room.

212
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,160
Well, for a man who swore
he'd never return to Starfleet...

213
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,920
Just a moment, Captain, Sir.
I'll explain what happened.

214
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,120
Your revered Admiral Nogura
invoked a little-known...

215
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,640
seldom-used reserve activation clause.

216
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,680
In simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me!

217
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,600
They didn't.

218
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,040
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?

219
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,720
Bones, there's a thing out there.

220
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,720
Why is any object we don't
understand always called a thing?

221
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,960
Headed this way. I need you.

222
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,280
Damn it, Bones, I need you.

223
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,280
Badly!

224
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,720
Permission to come aboard.

225
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,040
Permission granted, Sir.

226
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Well, Jim,
I hear Chapel's an MD now.

227
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,520
Well, I'm going
to need a top nurse...

228
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,480
not a doctor who will argue
every little diagnosis with me.

229
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,800
And they probably redesigned
the whole sick bay too!

230
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,320
I know engineers.
They love to change things.

231
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,240
Dock control reports ready, Sir.

232
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,280
- Helm ready, Sir.
- Orbital departure on plot, Sir.

233
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,640
Yard command signaling clear, Sir.

234
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,480
- Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Sir.

235
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,680
Hold station.

236
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,920
Thrusters at station-keeping, Sir.

237
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,800
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.

238
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,720
Take us out.

239
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,320
Intermix set, Bridge.
Impulse power at your discretion.

240
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,240
Impulse power, Mr. Sulu.

241
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,320
Ahead warp .5.

242
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,160
Departure angle on viewer.

243
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,120
Departure angle.

244
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,880
- Viewer ahead.
- Viewer ahead.

245
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,440
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7412.6...

246
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
1.8 hours from launch.

247
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,920
In order to intercept the intruder
at the earliest possible time...

248
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,920
we must now risk engaging warp drive
while still within the solar system.

249
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,080
Captain, assuming we have
full warp capability...

250
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,920
accelerating to warp 7 on leaving
the solar system...

251
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,160
will bring us to IP with
the intruder in 20.1 hours.

252
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Science Officer competition.
Confirm, Sir

253
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,080
Well, Bones, do the new medical
facilities meet with your approval?

254
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,600
They do not. It's like working
in a damn computer center.

255
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,960
- Programming ready?
- Set for standard warp entry.

256
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
But I still recommend
further simulation study.

257
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:48,640
Mr. Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

258
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,360
Engineering,
stand by for warp drive.

259
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,960
Captain, we need further warp
simulation on the flow sensors.

260
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,560
Engineer, we need warp speed now!

261
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,080
Jim, you're pushing.

262
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Your people know their jobs.

263
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,360
That's it, Sir.
I can't do any better.

264
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,440
Aye, lad.

265
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,760
It's borderline on the simulator.
I cannot guarantee she'll hold up.

266
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,520
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.

267
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,320
- Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu.
- Accelerating to warp 1, Sir.

268
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,280
Warp .7, .8.

269
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,200
Warp 1 , Sir.

270
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,720
Mr. Decker...

271
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,080
Wormhole. Get us back
on impulse power. Full reverse.

272
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,600
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power.

273
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,600
Subspace frequencies jammed, Sir!

274
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,600
Wormhole effect!

275
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,920
Negative control from inertial lag
will continue 22.5 seconds...

276
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,160
before forward velocity
slows to sublight speed.

277
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,480
Unidentified small object has been
pulled into the wormhole with us.

278
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,320
- Directly ahead.
- Force fields up full.

279
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,200
Put object on viewer.

280
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,240
- Go manual override on helm.
- No manual response, Sir.

281
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,720
Navigational deflectors
coming up, Sir.

282
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,320
Wormhole distortion has overloaded
the main power systems.

283
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
Navigational deflectors
inoperative, Captain.

284
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Directional control also inoperative.

285
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,400
Time to impact?

286
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,080
Twenty seconds.

287
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,960
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.

288
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,720
No!

289
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,400
Belay that phaser order!

290
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,240
Arm photon torpedoes!

291
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,080
Photon torpedoes...

292
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,520
armed!

293
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,320
Object is an asteroid.

294
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,200
Reading mass .7.

295
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,920
Targeting...

296
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,440
asteroid!

297
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,720
Impact in ten seconds.

298
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,360
Impact in eight seconds.

299
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,720
- Fire torpedoes!
- Six!

300
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,600
Torpedoes away!

301
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,160
Five!

302
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,560
Helm control restored, Sir.

303
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,320
- Position report, Navigator.
- Computing new intersection course.

304
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,280
Communications are normal, Sir.

305
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,080
Negative damage reported, Captain.

306
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,680
No casualties reported, Doctor.

307
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,480
Wrong, Mr. Chekov.There are casualties.

308
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,960
My wits, as in
"frightened out of," Captain, Sir.

309
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,920
We were at warp .8.
Engineer, report your status there.

310
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,000
In just a second, Exec. We're
picking up the pieces down here.

311
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,240
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

312
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,800
The engine imbalance created
the wormhole in the first place.

313
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,680
It'll happen again
if we don't correct it.

314
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,200
That object is less than
two days away from Earth.

315
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,160
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

316
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,120
Lay in a heading to conform with
our initial IP with the intruder.

317
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,520
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
Mr. Decker.

318
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,640
-I'd like to see you in my quarters.
-Mind if I tag along, Captain?

319
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,400
Level 5.

320
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,160
All right, explanation. Why was
my phaser order countermanded?

321
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
The Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power...

322
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,560
by channeling it
through the main engines.

323
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,640
When they went into
antimatter imbalance...

324
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,560
the phasers were
automatically cut off.

325
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,400
Then you acted properly, of course.

326
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,480
Thank you, Sir.

327
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,520
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

328
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,080
- You saved the ship.
- I'm aware of that, Sir.

329
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,880
Stop competing with me, Decker.

330
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,560
- Permission to speak freely, Sir?
- Granted.

331
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,480
Sir, you haven't logged a single
star hour in two-and-a-half years.

332
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
That, plus your unfamiliarity
with the ship's redesign...

333
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,720
in my opinion, Sir, seriously
jeopardizes this mission.

334
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,480
I trust you will...

335
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,000
nursemaid me through
these difficulties?

336
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,240
Yes, Sir, I'll do that.

337
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,320
Then I won't keep you from
your duties any longer, Commander.

338
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,480
- Yes, Doctor?
- Aye, Sir.

339
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,440
He may be right, Jim.

340
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,960
- Was it difficult?
- No more than I expected.

341
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,480
About as difficult
as seeing you again.

342
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,080
- I'm sorry.
- That you left Delta IV?

343
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,480
Or that you didn't
even say good-bye?

344
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,040
If I had seen you again...

345
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,920
would you have been
able to say it?

346
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,160
No.

347
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,280
Make your point, Doctor.

348
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,320
The point, Captain, is that
it's you who is competing.

349
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,960
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

350
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,200
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

351
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,120
And I intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

352
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,920
Yes.

353
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,840
It's an obsession.

354
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,760
An obsession that can blind you...

355
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,080
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

356
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,200
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

357
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,400
- Bridge to Captain.
- Viewer on.

358
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,680
Signal from a Federation registered
long-range shuttle, Sir.

359
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,720
She wishes to come alongside
and lock on.

360
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,680
For what purpose?

361
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,320
My security scan shows it has
a grade-one priority, Captain.

362
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
Non belligerency confirmed.

363
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,800
I suspect it is a courier
of some kind.

364
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,000
Very well, Mr. Chekov.
See to it.

365
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,280
Viewer off.

366
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,480
Your opinion has been noted.
Anything further?

367
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,680
That depends on you.

368
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,640
Security scan.: one boarder.
Identity: Starfleet, inactive.

369
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,040
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.

370
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,720
Gran... ted.

371
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,680
Why... Why, it's Mister...

372
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,280
Spock!

373
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Spock.

374
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,040
Commander, if I may?

375
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,240
If... Oh.

376
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,280
I've been monitoring your
communications with Starfleet.

377
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,920
I'm aware of your
engine design difficulties.

378
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,920
I offer my services
as science officer...

379
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,320
with all due respect,
Commander.

380
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,520
- If our exec has no objections.
- Of course not.

381
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,520
I'm well aware of
Mr. Spock's qualifications.

382
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,120
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.

383
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,760
List him as science officer.
Both effective immediately.

384
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,000
Mr. Spock.

385
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,960
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.

386
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,280
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.

387
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,240
Captain, with your permission...

388
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,960
I will now discuss these
fuel equations with the engineer.

389
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,120
Mr. Spock.

390
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,080
Welcome aboard.

391
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,720
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7413.4.

392
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,640
Thanks to Mr. Spock's
timely arrival and assistance...

393
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,120
we have the engines rebalanced
into full warp capacity.

394
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,160
Repair time.:
less than three hours.

395
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,600
Which means we will now be
able to intercept intruder...

396
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,680
while still more than
a day from Earth.

397
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,720
Warp .8.

398
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,600
.9.

399
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,520
Warp 2, Sir.

400
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,160
Warp 3.

401
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,320
Warp 4.

402
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,920
Warp 5.

403
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,480
Warp 6.

404
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,200
Warp 7.

405
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,560
Science Officer Spock,
reporting as ordered, Captain.

406
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,000
Please, sit down.

407
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,440
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

408
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,480
You're just as warm
and sociable as ever.

409
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,320
Nor have you, Doctor...

410
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,760
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

411
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,960
Gentlemen.

412
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,920
At last report,
you were on Vulcan...

413
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,880
apparently to stay.

414
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,520
Yes, you were undergoing
the ''Kolanear'' discipline.

415
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,600
Sit down.

416
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,880
If you are referring to the
Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct.

417
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,640
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr. Spock, it's the Vulcan ritual...

418
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,080
that's supposed to purge
all remaining emotions.

419
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,280
The Kolinahr is also a discipline
you broke to join us.

420
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,120
Will you, please, sit down?

421
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,760
On Vulcan I began sensing
a consciousness...

422
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,000
from a source more powerful
than I have ever encountered.

423
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,160
Thought patterns of
exactingly perfect order.

424
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,160
I believe they emanate
from the intruder.

425
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,440
I believe it may hold my answers.

426
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,800
Isn't it lucky for you that we just
happened to be heading your way?

427
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,400
Bones!

428
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,640
We need him.

429
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,320
I need him.

430
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,840
Then my presence is
to our mutual advantage.

431
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,120
Any thought patterns
you might sense...

432
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,320
whether they appear to
affect you personally or not...

433
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,520
I expect immediately reported.

434
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,440
Of course, Captain.

435
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,360
- Is there anything else?
- No.

436
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,840
Jim?

437
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,560
If this super intelligence...

438
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,960
is as important to him as
he says it is, how do we know...

439
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,960
That he wouldn't put his own
interests ahead of the ship's?

440
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,320
I could never believe that.

441
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
Bridge to Officers' Lounge.
Captain Kirk.

442
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,960
Revised estimate on
cloud visual contact.:3.7minutes.

443
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,760
Standard light, Engineer.

444
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,320
- Full mag on viewer.
- Full mag, Sir.

445
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,480
Lingua code?

446
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,040
Continuing friendship messages
on all frequencies, Sir.

447
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,440
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status red.

448
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,520
Captain, we are being scanned.

449
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,400
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.

450
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,360
It could be misinterpreted
as hostility.

451
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,920
Intruder scans emanating from
the exact center of the cloud.

452
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,920
Energy of a type...

453
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,840
never before encountered.

454
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,240
There's no response to
friendship messages, Sir.

455
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,160
- Shall I go to battle stations?
- Negative.

456
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,840
We'll take
no provocative action.

457
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,800
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.

458
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,000
No, Mr. Decker, that could also
be misinterpreted as hostile.

459
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,320
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?

460
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,560
- Twelfth-power energy field.
- Twelfth-power?

461
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,600
We've seen what their weapons can do.
Shouldn't we take every precaution?

462
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,120
- Mr. Decker...
- Captain.

463
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,200
I suspect there's an object
at the heart of that cloud.

464
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,120
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough...

465
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,560
Captain, as your exec
it's my duty...

466
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,080
to point out alternatives.

467
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,560
Yes, it is.

468
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,000
I stand corrected.

469
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,920
Five minutes to cloud boundary.

470
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,120
Navigator, lay in a conic section
flight path to the cloud center.

471
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,360
Bring us parallel
to whatever we find in there.

472
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,320
Mr. Sulu,
tactical plot on viewer.

473
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,480
Tactical on viewer, Sir.

474
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,560
That measures 12th-power energy?

475
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,040
Thousands of starships
couldn't generate that much...

476
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,640
Mr. Spock?

477
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,000
Spock, tell me.

478
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,040
I sense...

479
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,480
puzzlement.

480
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,000
We have been contacted.

481
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,480
Why have we not replied?

482
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,400
Contacted?

483
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,120
How?

484
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,200
Force fields up full.
Deflectors, now.

485
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,040
Force fields and deflectors
up full, Captain.

486
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,440
Analysis, Mr. Spock.

487
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,440
Alien weapon is a form
of plasma energy, Captain.

488
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,480
Exact composition unknown.

489
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,640
Guidance system unknown.

490
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,200
All decks, brace for impact.

491
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,040
Engineering, status report.

492
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,760
Systems overloading, Captain.

493
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,560
Medic.

494
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,360
Medics are coming.

495
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,240
Engineering to Bridge.

496
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,520
Cannot hold full power
on force fields.

497
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,920
Deflector power
is down 70 percent.

498
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,480
Divert auxiliary power
to deflectors.

499
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,840
Captain.

500
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,480
The intruder has been
attempting to communicate.

501
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,240
I am now programming
our computer...

502
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,840
to transmit lingua code at
their frequency and rate of speed.

503
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,440
Commander.

504
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,120
Spock!

505
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,920
Here it comes.

506
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,000
Engineering, what's happening
to our force field?

507
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,600
Our shields cannot handle
another attack.

508
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,320
Mr. Spock.

509
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,640
Impact in 20 seconds

510
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,760
Spock.

511
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,800
Fifteen seconds.

512
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,880
Spock, transmit now.

513
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,280
Ten seconds.

514
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,880
Transmitting.

515
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,040
It would seem
our friendship messages...

516
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,920
have been received
and understood, Mr. Spock.

517
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,680
I would say that was
a logical assumption, Captain.

518
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,760
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.

519
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,520
Holding present position, Sir.

520
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,520
Tactical plot on viewer.

521
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,480
Course projection
on tactical, Sir.

522
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,720
Opinion, Mr. Spock.

523
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,560
Recommend we proceed, Captain.

524
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,320
- Mr. Decker?
- I advise caution, Captain.

525
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,360
We can't withstand another attack.

526
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,560
That thing is 20 hours
away from Earth.

527
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,600
- We know nothing about it as yet.
- Precisely the point, Captain.

528
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,560
We don't know what it'll do.

529
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,200
Moving into that cloud
at this time...

530
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,760
is an unwarranted gamble.

531
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,520
How do you define ''unwarranted''?

532
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,360
You asked my opinion, Sir.

533
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,720
Viewer. Standard ahead.

534
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,080
Navigator, maintain course.

535
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,480
Helmsman...

536
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,240
steady as she goes.

537
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,400
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

538
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,600
Spock.

539
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Instruments fluctuating,
Captain.

540
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,840
Patterns unrecognizable.

541
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,680
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.

542
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,960
Advise we are attempting
further communication.

543
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,920
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

544
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,120
Any attempt to transmit out of
the cloud is being reflected back.

545
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,120
We are closing on it
rapidly, Captain.

546
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,920
Reduce magnification
factor four, Mr. Sulu.

547
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,240
We are already
two settings below that, Sir.

548
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,160
Mr. Sulu...

549
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,280
bring us into
a parallel course...

550
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,160
over the alien...

551
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,480
at 500 meters.

552
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,120
Five hundred meters?

553
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,920
Then take us out
to 100 kilometers distance...

554
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,720
adjusting parallel course.

555
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,200
Aye, Sir.

556
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,000
Viewer astern.

557
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,280
Reverse angle on the view,
Captain.

558
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,480
Five hundred meters.

559
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,320
Viewer ahead, Sir.

560
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,960
Hold relative position here.

561
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,960
Mr. Spock!

562
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,600
Can that be one of their crew?

563
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,680
A probe from their vessel,
Captain.

564
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,520
Plasma-energy combination.

565
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,880
Don't interfere with it.

566
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,760
Absolutely, I will not interfere.

567
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,080
No one interfere.

568
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,960
It doesn't seem interested in us.
Only the ship.

569
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,160
Computer off.

570
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,120
It's taking control
of the computer.

571
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,240
It's running our records...
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.

572
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,680
Ilia!

573
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,680
Ilia!

574
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,280
This is how I define ''unwarranted.''

575
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,680
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

576
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,400
Captain, we've been
seized by a tractor beam.

577
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,560
Get someone up here
to take the navigator's station.

578
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,400
- Engineering.
- Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.

579
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,600
- Emergency power.
- Going to full emergency.

580
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,800
But, Captain, if we don't break free
in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.

581
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,720
We cannot break free, Captain.

582
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,840
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

583
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,040
Engineering, belay that order.

584
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,960
Disengage all main drive systems.

585
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,240
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.

586
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,600
DiFalco, disengage engine
navigation relays now.

587
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,760
Aye, Sir.

588
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,680
Force field circuits
E-10 through 14...

589
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,320
show ready for reactivation.

590
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,720
Confirm, please.

591
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,160
Scotty, drive systems
should be free now.

592
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,280
Commander?

593
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,200
Ready to launch
remote communications drone...

594
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,600
with complete ship's records...

595
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,520
including
our present situation, Sir.

596
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,480
Delay launching
as long as possible.

597
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,120
Our drone can't escape as long
as we're held in their tractor.

598
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,080
Aye.

599
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,800
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam...

600
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,920
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

601
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,840
Break free to where, Commander?

602
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,680
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

603
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,720
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
Why are you opposed to trying?

604
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,240
Why bring us inside?

605
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,560
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

606
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,360
They still can.

607
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,440
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.

608
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,560
Insatiable curiosity.

609
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,800
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

610
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,440
We're trapped, Sir.

611
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,320
Reverse angle on the viewer,
Captain.

612
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,480
Tractor beam has released us,
Captain.

613
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,160
Confirmed.
Vessel is floating free.

614
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,120
No forward momentum.

615
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,320
Viewer ahead.

616
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,720
Viewer ahead, Sir.

617
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:24,200
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead one third.

618
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,400
Thrusters ahead one third.

619
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,920
Let's take a look.

620
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,240
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.

621
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,520
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

622
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,440
Now that we're
looking down their throat.

623
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,480
Right, now that we've got them
just where they want us.

624
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,520
It's closing up.

625
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,240
Hold position.

626
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,840
Captain.

627
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,080
All our scans
are being reflected back.

628
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,560
Sensors are useless.

629
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,040
Damn.

630
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,040
What do you make of all this?

631
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32,040
I believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber...

632
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,720
undoubtedly part of
the vessel's inner mechanism.

633
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,320
I suspect it may be necess...

634
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,520
Intruder alert!
Deck 5. Officer's quarters.

635
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,240
Have Security meet me
at deck 5, main elevator.

636
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,560
Spock.
Mr. Decker, you have the com.

637
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,160
Hold positions.

638
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,160
You are the Kirk unit.

639
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,080
You will assist me.

640
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,960
I have been programmed by V'Ger...

641
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,560
to observe and record...

642
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,480
normal functions
of the carbon-based units...

643
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,720
infesting USS Enterprise.

644
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,320
-Jim, what's going on?
- Tricorder.

645
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,520
Who is...

646
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,200
V'Ger?

647
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,520
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

648
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,040
Is V'Ger the name of the Captain
of the alien vessel?

649
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,400
Jim.

650
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,240
This is a mechanism.

651
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,840
A probe, Captain.

652
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,160
No doubt
a sensor-transceiver combination...

653
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,640
recording everything we say and do.

654
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,000
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?

655
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,560
That unit no longer functions.

656
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,440
I've been given its form...

657
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,360
to more readily communicate
with the carbon-based units...

658
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,360
infesting Enterprise.

659
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,360
Carbon-based units?

660
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,600
Humans, Ensign Perez.
Us.

661
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,560
Why does V'Ger travel...

662
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,600
to the third planet of the solar
system directly ahead?

663
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,800
To find the creator.

664
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,200
Find the creator?

665
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,840
Whose...

666
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,720
What does V'Ger want
with the creator?

667
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,160
To join with him.

668
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,440
To join with the creator? How?

669
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,040
V'Ger and the creator
will become one.

670
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,840
And who is the creator?

671
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,360
The creator is that
which created V'Ger.

672
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,440
Who is V'Ger?

673
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,160
V'Ger is that
which seeks the creator.

674
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,280
I'm ready to commence
my observations.

675
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,200
Doctor, a thorough examination
of this probe...

676
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,720
might provide some insight
into those who manufactured it...

677
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,920
and how to deal with them.

678
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,800
Fine.
Let's get her to sick bay.

679
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,120
I'm programmed
to observe and record...

680
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,720
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

681
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,880
The, uh...

682
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,000
examination is a normal function.

683
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,200
You may proceed.

684
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,560
Micro-miniature hydraulics...

685
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,080
sensors...

686
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,000
and molecule-sized
multiprocessor chips.

687
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,200
And take a look at this.

688
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,880
An osmotic micropump, right here.

689
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,960
Even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

690
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,960
Every exocrine system
is the same, too...

691
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,480
even eye moisture.

692
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,680
Decker.

693
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,600
Fascinating.

694
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,680
Not ''Decker unit.''

695
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,520
Gentlemen.

696
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,960
Will.

697
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,360
- What happened to her?
- Captain.

698
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,680
This probe may be our key
to the aliens.

699
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,600
- Probe? Ilia?
- Exactly.

700
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,800
It is a programmed mechanism,
Commander.

701
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,400
Its body duplicates our navigator
in precise detail.

702
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,640
Suppose that,
beneath its programming...

703
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,280
the real Ilia's memory patterns
are duplicated with equal precision.

704
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,640
- They had a pattern to follow.
- Indeed.

705
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,320
They may have followed it
too precisely.

706
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,320
Ilia's memory...

707
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,920
her feelings of loyalty,
obedience, friendship...

708
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,840
might all be there.

709
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,800
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

710
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,440
That probe, in another form,
is what killed Ilia.

711
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,240
Commander...

712
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,680
Will, we're locked
in an alien vessel...

713
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,160
six hours from Earth's orbit.

714
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,640
Our only contact with our captor
is that probe.

715
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,880
If we can control it,
persuade it, use it...

716
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,360
I have recorded enough here.

717
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,320
You will now assist me further.

718
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,240
The, uh...

719
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,120
Decker unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

720
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,120
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr. Decker.

721
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,800
Aye, Sir.

722
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,440
I am concerned with that being our
only source of information, Captain.

723
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,600
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7414.1.

724
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,360
Our best estimates place us
some four hours from Earth.

725
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,360
No significant progress
thus far...

726
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:22,240
reviving Ilia memory patterns
within the alien probe.

727
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,000
This remains our only means
of contact with our captor.

728
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,400
All those vessels
were called Enterprise.

729
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,400
The carbon units
use this area for recreation.

730
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,320
This is one of the games.

731
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,360
What types of recreation does
the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

732
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,400
The words ''recreation''...

733
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,840
and ''enjoy''...

734
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,240
have no meaning
to my programming.

735
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,920
Ilia enjoyed this game.

736
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,760
She nearly always won.

737
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,400
Good. He's using
audiovisual association.

738
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,280
This device serves no purpose.

739
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,640
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

740
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,520
Enterprise would be unable
to function without carbon units.

741
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,760
More data concerning
this functioning is necessary...

742
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,120
before carbon units
can be patterned...

743
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,040
for data storage.

744
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,040
What does that mean?

745
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,200
When my examination is complete...

746
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,760
all carbon units will be
reduced to data patterns.

747
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,280
Within you...

748
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,360
are the memory patterns
of a certain carbon unit.

749
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,360
If I can help you
to revive those patterns...

750
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,280
you could understand
our functions better.

751
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,320
That is logical.

752
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,120
You may proceed.

753
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:42,480
I remember Lieutenant Ilia
once mentioning she wore that.

754
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,000
On Delta.

755
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,520
Remember?

756
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,800
Ilia.

757
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,080
Dr. Chapel.

758
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,320
Will?

759
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,560
Ilia.

760
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,040
Commander.

761
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,400
Commander.

762
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,880
This is a mechanism.

763
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,080
Ilia...

764
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,840
help us make direct contact
with V'Ger.

765
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,760
I cannot.

766
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:41,400
This creator V'Ger is looking for...
what is it?

767
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,800
V'Ger does not know.

768
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,480
Computer, commence recording.

769
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,760
Captain Kirk, these messages
will detail my attempt...

770
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,800
to contact the aliens.

771
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,440
I intend to calculate thruster
ignition and acceleration rate...

772
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,760
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

773
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,680
This should facilitate
a better view...

774
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,600
of the interior
of the alien spacecraft.

775
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,360
Captain, Starfleet signals
are growing in strength, Sir.

776
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,640
They still have the intruder
on their monitors.

777
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,880
- It's decelerating.
- Confirmed, Sir.

778
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,360
Lunar beacons indicate intruder
on a course into Earth orbit.

779
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,640
Sir, air lock 4
has been opened.

780
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,200
A thruster suit
is reported missing.

781
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,880
A thruster suit?

782
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,320
That's Spock.

783
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,200
Damn him.

784
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,880
Bring him back here.

785
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,320
No, wait.

786
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,240
- Get a fix on his position.
- Aye, Sir.

787
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,880
I have successfully penetrated...

788
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,840
the next chamber
of the alien's interior...

789
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,880
and I'm witnessing
some sort of dimensional image...

790
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,320
which I believe to be
a representation...

791
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,080
of V'Ger's home planet.

792
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,480
I'm passing through
a connecting tunnel.

793
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:19,640
Apparently, a kind of
plasma-energy conduit.

794
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,360
Possibly a field coil for
a gigantic imaging system.

795
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,160
Curious.

796
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,680
I'm seeing images
of planets, moons, stars...

797
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,440
whole galaxies
all stored here, recorded.

798
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,320
It could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

799
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,240
But who or what...

800
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,600
are we dealing with?

801
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:57,720
The Epsilon 9 station,
stored here with every detail.

802
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,400
Captain, I am now
quite convinced...

803
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,560
that all of this is V'Ger...

804
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,360
that we are inside
a living machine.

805
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,840
Ilia.

806
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,880
The sensor...

807
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,480
must contain
some special meaning.

808
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,880
I must try to mind-meld with it.

809
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,480
Spock.

810
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,800
Spock!

811
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,400
Spock.

812
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,200
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fiber connection.

813
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,080
Indications of some
neurological trauma.

814
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:00,520
The power pouring through that
mind-meld must have been staggering.

815
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,720
Spock.

816
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,200
Jim.

817
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,120
I should have known.

818
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,320
Were you right...

819
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,520
about V'Ger?

820
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,640
A life-form of its own.

821
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,280
A conscious, living entity.

822
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,680
A living machine?

823
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,600
It considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

824
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,840
That's why the probe
refers to our ship as an entity.

825
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,960
I saw V'Ger's planet.

826
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:37,600
A planet populated
by living machines.

827
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,680
Unbelievable technology.

828
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,320
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

829
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,720
And yet...

830
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,040
with all its pure logic...

831
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,880
V'Ger is barren...

832
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,200
cold.

833
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,400
No mystery.

834
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,800
No beauty.

835
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,600
Should have known.

836
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,600
Known?

837
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,360
Known what? Spock.

838
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,880
What should you have known?
What should you have known?

839
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,200
Jim...

840
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,880
this...

841
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,800
simple feeling...

842
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,920
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

843
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,440
No meaning, no hope.

844
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,160
Jim...

845
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,360
no answers.

846
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,400
It's asking questions.

847
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,120
''Is this...

848
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,320
all that I am?

849
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,960
Is there nothing more?''

850
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,400
Bridge to Captain.

851
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,640
Kirk here.

852
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,400
A faint signal
from Starfleet, Sir.

853
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,280
Intruder cloud has been located
on their outer monitors...

854
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,360
for the past 27 minutes.

855
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,840
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

856
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,520
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

857
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,440
We are three minutes
from Earth orbit.

858
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,360
I'll be right there.

859
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,040
I need Spock on the bridge.

860
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,120
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

861
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,960
A machine planet...

862
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,920
sending a machine to Earth..

863
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,520
looking for its creator.

864
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,560
It's absolutely incredible.

865
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,240
Mr. Chekov.
Commander Decker present location.

866
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,520
They are in the engineering, Sir.

867
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:24,960
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

868
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,040
V'Ger is transmitting... a signal.

869
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,920
Jim.

870
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,720
From V'Ger.

871
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,360
V'Ger signals the creator.

872
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,600
Spock?

873
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,400
A simple binary code...

874
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,120
transmitted by carrier wave signal.

875
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,800
Radio.

876
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:08,800
Radio?

877
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,320
Jim.

878
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:18,040
V'Ger expects an answer.

879
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,360
An answer?

880
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,280
I don't know the question.

881
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,400
The creator has not responded.

882
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:42,800
All planetary defense systems
have just gone inoperative.

883
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,920
Sir, Starfleet computes
the devices are proceeding...

884
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:28,080
toward equidistant positions
orbiting the planet.

885
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,800
They're the same things
that hit us.

886
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,600
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

887
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,880
From those positions...

888
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,440
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

889
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,640
Why?

890
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,920
The creator has not answered.

891
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,680
The carbon unit infestation is to be
removed from the creator's planet.

892
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,640
Why?

893
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,640
You infest Enterprise.

894
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,240
You interfere with the creator
in the same manner.

895
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
V'Ger

896
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
V'Ger

897
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,800
Captain.

898
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,520
V'Ger is a child.

899
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,360
I suggest you treat it as such.

900
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,160
- A child?
- Yes, Captain.

901
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,040
A child...

902
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:41,400
evolving, learning, searching...

903
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,720
instinctively needing.

904
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,760
- Needing what?
- Spock.

905
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:51,160
This child is about to wipe out
every living thing on Earth.

906
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:54,080
Now, what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?

907
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,560
It knows only that it needs,
Commander.

908
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,200
But, like so many of us...

909
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,200
it does not know what.

910
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,600
The carbon units know why
the creator has not responded.

911
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,680
Disclose the information.

912
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,560
Not until V'Ger withdraws the
devices orbiting the third planet.

913
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,240
Captain.

914
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,360
I'm losing Starfleet.

915
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,680
Interference from V'Ger.

916
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:42,480
Kirk unit, disclose the information.

917
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,280
Why has the creator not responded?

918
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,400
No.

919
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,720
Secure all stations.

920
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,200
Clear the bridge.

921
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,240
Clear the bridge, Captain?

922
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,280
- That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
- Clear the bridge  - Aye, Sir.

923
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,480
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.

924
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,080
V'Ger requires the information.

925
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,240
Bridge, secure all stations.
Move out.

926
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,920
Jim, what the hell
kind of strategy is this?

927
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,560
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

928
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,240
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise...

929
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,600
the information that V'Ger requires
will also be destroyed.

930
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,640
It is illogical to withhold
required information.

931
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,160
Kirk unit!

932
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:39,400
Kirk unit.

933
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,600
Why do you not
disclose information?

934
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,800
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all
carbon units on the third planet.

935
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,720
They have repressed the creator.

936
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,360
The information
will not be disclosed.

937
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,320
V'Ger needs the information.

938
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:04,320
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

939
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,880
V'Ger will comply...

940
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:09,760
if the carbon units will
disclose the information.

941
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,960
It learns fast, doesn't it?

942
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,280
Captain, the vessel... V'Ger...

943
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:25,040
obviously operates from
a central brain complex.

944
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,840
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from that point, then.

945
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,320
Precisely.

946
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:42,440
The carbon unit's information cannot
be disclosed to V'Ger's probe...

947
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,320
but only to V'Ger directly.

948
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,680
Forward motion, Captain.

949
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,960
Tractor beam.

950
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:30,480
Captain, what's the next move?

951
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,240
The question is, Mr. Decker...

952
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,200
is there a next move?

953
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,680
Resume duty stations.

954
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,680
All personnel, resume stations.

955
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,920
Well, Mr. Decker,
it seems my bluff has been called.

956
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,280
I'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

957
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:04,680
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

958
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,080
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.

959
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,920
Captain, I believe
that is our destination.

960
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,520
Forward motion slowing, Captain.

961
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:32,080
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

962
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,800
Forward motion stopped, Captain.

963
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,440
V'Ger.

964
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:52,480
Sir, I've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

965
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,920
It's directly ahead.

966
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,120
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its creator.

967
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:04,320
The carbon units
will now provide V'Ger...

968
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,600
with the required information.

969
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,920
Mr. Spock. Bones.

970
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:22,360
Mr. Decker, I will contact you
every five minutes.

971
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,640
Captain.

972
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,520
I'd like to go along.

973
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,920
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.

974
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,800
V'Ger.

975
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:37,600
''V... G-E-R.''

976
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:41,600
V'Ger.

977
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:57,400
''V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.''

978
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:58,680
Voyager.

979
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:04,600
Voyager 6.

980
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:08,840
NASA. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

981
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,760
Jim...

982
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,320
this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

983
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,680
Voyager series.

984
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,200
Designed to collect data...

985
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,080
and transmit it back to Earth.

986
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,360
Captain...

987
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:13,120
Voyager 6 disappeared into what
they used to call a black hole.

988
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,000
It must have emerged
on the far side of the galaxy...

989
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:20,120
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

990
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:23,560
The machine inhabitants found it
to be one of their own kind...

991
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:26,040
primitive, yet kindred.

992
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:28,960
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming...

993
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,360
collect all data possible.

994
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,400
Learn all that is learnable.

995
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:38,960
Return that information
to its creator.

996
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,400
Precisely, Mr. Decker.

997
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,640
The machines
interpreted it literally.

998
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,600
They built this entire vessel...

999
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:49,080
so that Voyager could actually
fulfill its programming.

1000
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,040
And on its journey back...

1001
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,360
it amassed so much knowledge...

1002
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:59,040
it achieved consciousness itself.

1003
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,560
It became a living thing.

1004
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,160
Kirk unit.

1005
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,160
V'Ger awaits the information.

1006
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,040
Enterprise...

1007
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,480
order up the ship's
computer library records...

1008
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,880
on the late 20th-century
NASA probe Voyager 6.

1009
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,640
Specifically, we want
the old NASA code signal...

1010
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,720
that instructs the probe
to transmit its data.

1011
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,800
- And fast, Uhura, fast.
-Aye, Sir.

1012
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,840
That's what it's been signaling...

1013
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,200
its readiness
to transmit its information.

1014
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,120
And there's no one on Earth...

1015
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,400
who could recognize the old signal
and send a response.

1016
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,520
The creator does not answer.

1017
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,960
V'Ger.

1018
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:05,920
V'Ger.

1019
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,400
V'Ger!

1020
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,480
We are the creator.

1021
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,400
That is not logical.

1022
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,320
Carbon units
are not true life-forms.

1023
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,600
We will prove it.

1024
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:25,800
We will make it possible for you
to complete your programming.

1025
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,200
Only the creator
could accomplish that.

1026
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:31,360
Enterprise?

1027
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:34,320
We have just received
the response code, Captain.

1028
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,760
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency...

1029
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,040
and transmit the code now.

1030
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,320
Transmitting.

1031
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,600
5-0-4...

1032
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,680
3-2-9...

1033
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,600
3-1-7...

1034
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,000
5-1-0...

1035
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,640
and the final sequence.

1036
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:55,040
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.

1037
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:10,280
Voyager is not transmitting
its data, Captain.

1038
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,440
The creator must join with V'Ger.

1039
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,600
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.

1040
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,520
The creator must join with V'Ger.

1041
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,640
Voyager is not transmitting,
Captain...

1042
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:51,160
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

1043
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,800
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.

1044
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,720
Enterprise, stand by.

1045
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:07,680
- The antenna leads are melted away.
- Yes, Captain, just now.

1046
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,080
By V'Ger itself.

1047
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:13,120
- Why?
- To prevent reception.

1048
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,560
Of course.

1049
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:17,280
To bring the creator here.

1050
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,840
To finish transmitting
the code in person.

1051
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:24,800
To touch the creator.

1052
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,560
Capture God?

1053
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,240
V'Ger's liable to be in for
one hell of a disappointment.

1054
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:34,400
Perhaps not, Doctor.

1055
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,760
Captain.

1056
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,360
V'Ger must evolve.

1057
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,280
Its knowledge has reached the limits
of this universe. It must evolve.

1058
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,320
What it requires of its god, Doctor,
is the answer to its question...

1059
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,920
Is there nothing more?

1060
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,680
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

1061
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:19,640
Other dimensions.
Higher levels of being.

1062
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:21,960
The existence of which
cannot be proven logically.

1063
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,320
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

1064
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,840
What V'Ger needs
in order to evolve...

1065
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,120
is a human quality...

1066
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,080
our capacity to leap beyond logic.

1067
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,840
Joining with its creator
might accomplish that.

1068
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:41,800
You mean this machine wants to
physically join with a human?

1069
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,360
Is that possible?

1070
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:48,920
Let's find out.

1071
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,320
Decker.

1072
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:01,320
I'm gonna key the final sequence
through the ground test computer.

1073
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:03,280
You don't know
what that'll do to you!

1074
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,800
Yes, I do, Doctor.

1075
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,000
Decker, don't.

1076
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,800
Jim, I want this.

1077
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:20,080
As much as you wanted
the Enterprise, I want this.

1078
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:07,680
Captain.

1079
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:13,560
Spock, did we just see the beginning
of a new life-form?

1080
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:16,800
Yes, Captain.
We witnessed a birth.

1081
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,440
Possibly a next step
in our evolution.

1082
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,160
I wonder.

1083
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:24,040
Well, it's been a long time
since I delivered a baby.

1084
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,000
I hope we got this one off
to a good start.

1085
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:28,520
I hope so too.

1086
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:32,520
I think we gave it the ability to
create its own sense of purpose...

1087
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,360
out of our own human weaknesses...

1088
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,000
and the drive that compels us
to overcome them.

1089
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:43,800
And a lot of foolish human emotions.
Right, Mr. Spock?

1090
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,560
Quite true, Doctor.

1091
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:49,040
Unfortunately, it will have to
deal with them as well.

1092
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:50,960
Interrogative from Starfleet.

1093
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,560
They're requesting damage and injury
reports and complete vessel status.

1094
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,360
Report two casualties.

1095
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,680
Lieutenant Ilia.

1096
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:01,240
Captain Decker.

1097
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:02,720
- Aye, Sir.
- Correction.

1098
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,600
They're not casualties.

1099
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:06,040
They...

1100
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,480
List them as missing.

1101
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,520
Vessel status: fully operational.

1102
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,560
Aye, Sir.

1103
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:19,320
Mr. Scott, shall we give
the Enterprise a proper shakedown?

1104
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:23,240
I would say it's time
for that, Sir, aye.

1105
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:26,280
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr. Spock.

1106
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,680
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.

1107
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:31,120
My task on Vulcan is completed.

1108
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:34,800
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1 .

1109
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,200
- Warp 1 , Sir.
- Heading, Sir?

1110
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:43,040
Out there.

1111
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,480
That away.
