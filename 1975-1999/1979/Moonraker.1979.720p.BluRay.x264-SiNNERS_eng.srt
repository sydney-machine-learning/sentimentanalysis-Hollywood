1
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,395
How we doing, Richard?

2
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,565
We should pass over the English
coast 15 minutes ahead of time, sir.

3
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,735
Well, with this load
on our back, that's good going.

4
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,862
Just trust the RAF, sir.

5
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,152
-What the hell is that?
-The shuttle ignition.

6
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,879
Disappeared?
And what happened to the Moonraker?

7
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,383
Good God.

8
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,263
Yes, yes, of course, Minister. Right away.

9
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,774
Moneypenny, is 007 back
from that African job?

10
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,150
He's on his last leg, sir.

11
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,578
Any higher, Mr. Bond, my ears will pop.

12
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,794
I don't think I'm ever going
to fly with anyone else.

13
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,921
You're so right, Mr. Bond.

14
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,098
This is where we leave you, Mr. Bond.

15
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,433
A little premature, isn't it?

16
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,107
Enjoy your flight.

17
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,041
-Good morning, Moneypenny.
-James.

18
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,542
But why are you so late?

19
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,921
I fell out of an airplane
without a parachute.

20
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,299
-Who's in there?
-Q and the Minister of Defense.

21
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,051
You don't believe me, do you?

22
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,471
-And you should go right in.
-Yes, Moneypenny.

23
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,603
-007. At last.
-Good morning, sir.

24
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,272
I think you know Frederick Gray,
Minister of Defense.

25
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,024
-Commander.
-Minister. Q.

26
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,651
007.

27
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,239
Moonraker?

28
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,243
-What do you know about Moonraker?
-What I read in the newspaper, sir.

29
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,328
Then you'll know that Moonraker,
the space shuttle,

30
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,412
was being flown over here

31
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,915
on loan from the Americans
on the back of a 747.

32
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,167
Yes, which crashed
somewhere in the Yukon,

33
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,461
aircraft and shuttle
totally destroyed, correct?

34
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,548
-That's the official version.
-The truth is rather more disturbing, 007.

35
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,259
Look at this.

36
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,894
Now, that's the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn over a large area.

37
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,729
That's all that's left of the fuselage.

38
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,731
We've been through it
with a fine-toothed comb,

39
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,317
but there's no sign of Moonraker,
not a trace.

40
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,903
Are you suggesting the shuttle
was hijacked in midair?

41
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,197
That's for you to find out, 007.

42
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,741
The shuttles are built in California
by Drax Industries.

43
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:22,705
Yes. We were responsible
for the safety of that shuttle, Commander.

44
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,958
The United States government
is justifiably concerned.

45
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,878
I can imagine.
Then, California must be the place to start.

46
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,965
-I agree.
-Don't make any mistakes, 007.

47
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,552
The situation is critical.
We've got to find that shuttle.

48
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,053
Yes, sir.

49
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,723
If that's all, gentlemen...

50
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,310
Just a minute, 007.
I've got something for you.

51
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,024
Roll up your right sleeve, will you?

52
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,027
This is now being issued
as standard equipment.

53
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,070
Strap it on your wrist.

54
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,703
It's activated by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.

55
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,121
Like this?

56
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,001
Oh, thank you, 007.

57
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,503
-Be careful, will you?
-Yes, Q.

58
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,715
Ten darts, five blue-tipped
with armor piercing heads,

59
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,011
five red-tipped, cyanide coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.

60
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,015
Very novel, Q. You must get them
in the stores for Christmas.

61
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,059
Good morning, gentlemen.

62
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,783
-Welcome to California, Mr. Bond.
-I like it already.

63
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,463
My name is Corinne Dufour.

64
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,216
Oh, and you're going to be showing
me around, are you, Corinne?

65
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,553
No. I'm just a humble pilot
in the service of the Drax Corporation.

66
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:17,319
This is the Drax estate now.
Everything you see belongs to Mr. Drax.

67
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,865
-Owns a lot, doesn't he?
-What he doesn't own, he doesn't want.

68
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,997
We're approaching
the main complex now.

69
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,918
That's where
the Moonraker shuttle is made?

70
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,921
That's right, workshops, hangars,

71
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,134
design and experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.

72
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,677
Very impressive.

73
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:56,024
I'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.

74
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,779
Now, I can believe it. Good Lord.

75
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,708
The Drax residence.
Every stone brought from France.

76
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,962
-Cute, isn't it?
-Magnificent.

77
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,797
Why didn't he buy
the Eiffel Tower as well?

78
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,509
He did, but the French government
refused him an export permit.

79
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,030
Look there.
Those are the astronaut trainees.

80
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:47,701
Mr. Drax is financing the entire
training program out of his own pocket.

81
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,872
He seems to have an eye
for a good investment.

82
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,437
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond
in the drawing room, Miss Dufour.

83
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,815
-Thank you, Cavendish.
-This way, please, sir.

84
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,481
Mr. Bond, sir.

85
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,279
-Mr. Bond.
-Mr. Drax.

86
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,658
Allow me to present, before they leave
us, Countess Lubinski,

87
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,703
Lady Victoria Devon, Mr. Bond.

88
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,247
How do you do?

89
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,545
Well, my dear fellow,
your reputation precedes you, of course.

90
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm honored that your government should
send you on so delicate a mission.

91
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,509
Delicate, Mr. Drax?

92
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,555
Well, to apologize in person
for the loss of my space shuttle.

93
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,476
How would Oscar Wilde have put it?

94
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,772
"To lose one aircraft may be regarded
as a misfortune,

95
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,860
"to lose two seems like carelessness."

96
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,367
Well, an apology will be made
to the American government, Mr. Drax,

97
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,580
when we've discovered why there was no
trace of the Moonraker in that wreckage.

98
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,709
And your loyalty
commands respect, Mr. Bond.

99
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,880
You have arrived at a propitious moment,

100
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,300
coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution

101
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,219
to Western civilization.

102
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,055
Afternoon tea.

103
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,685
-May I press you to a cucumber sandwich?
-Thank you, no, nothing at all.

104
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,605
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?

105
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,316
No. I own a number of subsidiaries
throughout the world,

106
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,151
producing components.

107
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,321
The conquest of space represents
an investment in the future

108
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,532
of the entire human race, Mr. Bond.

109
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:38,121
It is, therefore, logical to seek out
the best that each nation has to offer.

110
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:44,002
-Are you referring to people or skills?
-Both, Mr. Bond.

111
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,349
-Am I too soon?
-Not at all.

112
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,769
I'm sure Mr. Bond
is eager to start his tour.

113
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,523
Miss Dufour will escort you to
Dr. Goodhead who will show you around.

114
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,733
Ask anything you like.

115
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,320
-Thank you for being so cooperative.
-A pleasure.

116
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:26,461
Look after Mr. Bond.
See that some harm comes to him.

117
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,801
You'll find Dr. Goodhead first on the right.

118
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,305
-Oh. Thank you for the ride.
-Call on me if you need anything.

119
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,497
Good afternoon.

120
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,083
-Can I help you?
-Yes. My name is Bond.

121
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,878
James Bond.
I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.

122
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,590
-You just found her.
-A woman.

123
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,470
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.

124
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,513
James, to my friends.

125
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,016
Holly Goodhead.

126
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:26,313
-Are you training to be an astronaut?
-I'm fully trained.

127
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,441
On loan from NASA,
the Space Administration.

128
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,112
Well, Mr. Bond,
I guess we'd better get started.

129
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:38,408
You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle, do you?

130
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,834
This is it, the Moonraker.

131
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,337
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...

132
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,631
Orbiting the Earth and reentering
the atmosphere to land

133
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,091
like any conventional aircraft.

134
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,309
This is the centrifuge training.

135
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:09,022
It simulates the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.

136
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,072
The speed is controlled
by the instructor from up there.

137
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,241
Why not try it?

138
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,744
Why not?

139
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,879
-Strap yourself in firmly.
-Yes, Doctor.

140
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,967
Now your arms.

141
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,511
That's to prevent you
from knocking yourself out.

142
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,887
I see.

143
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,064
How fast does it go?

144
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,360
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.

145
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,196
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.

146
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,283
Most people pass out at seven.

147
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,869
You make a great saleswoman.

148
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,998
You don't have to worry.
This is what we call a "Chicken Switch."

149
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,166
You just keep your finger on that button,

150
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,711
the moment the pressure gets
too much for you, release the button

151
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,214
-and the power's cut off.
-Just like that?

152
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:20,677
Come on, Mr. Bond.
A 70-year-old can take 3 Gs.

153
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:25,390
Well, the trouble is there is never
a 70-year-old around when you need one.

154
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,149
-You want me?
-Mr. Drax says to telephone him.

155
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:39,946
All right, I'll call him from my office.
You go ahead. I'll be right back.

156
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:44,034
The instructor will supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.

157
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,712
Yes. We're taking good care of him.

158
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,032
I don't know what could've happened.

159
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,202
Something must've gone wrong
with the controls.

160
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,885
Let me help you.

161
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,546
My mother gave me a list of things
not to do on a first date.

162
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,216
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.

163
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,386
No. What do you want then?

164
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:38,685
Would your feelings be shattered
if I were to say information?

165
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:43,022
-Why should I tell you anything?
-Why, indeed?

166
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,947
You presume a great deal, Mr. Bond.

167
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,508
What goes on here
besides the manufacture of Moonraker?

168
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,219
And the astronaut training program?

169
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:17,849
There are other laboratories,
but not much is happening now.

170
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,767
No?

171
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:24,981
They were working on something very
secret, but everything's been moved.

172
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,983
Where to?

173
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,821
I don't know.

174
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,914
What about that list of your mother's?

175
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,625
I never learned to read.

176
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,269
What are you doing?

177
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,897
You whetted my appetite for information.

178
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,401
Is there a safe in here? Thank you.

179
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,613
James, no.

180
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,533
That's amazing.

181
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,955
There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.

182
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,749
Eighteen karat.

183
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:25,703
You must go.

184
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,831
Well, you go first. I'll turn off the lights.

185
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,838
Thank you.

186
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,516
-Take care of yourself.
-And you.

187
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,073
Ah, my dear Bond.

188
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:31,204
This is Mademoiselle Deladier
and La Signorina del Mateo.

189
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,664
-Ladies.
-I'll see you at lunch.

190
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,337
A pity you leave us. Such good sport.

191
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,923
Unless you're a pheasant.

192
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:46,511
Really, Mr. Bond. Take my gun,
a stray bird may fly over.

193
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,971
I only stopped to thank you
for your hospitality.

194
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:52,558
Fraser will get you
to the airport in plenty of time.

195
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,354
Come now.

196
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:18,751
-I doubt if I'm in your class.
-Oh, you're too modest, Mr. Bond.

197
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,803
Over there.

198
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,354
You missed, Mr. Bond.

199
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,149
Did I?

200
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,822
As you said, such good sport.

201
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,098
You called for me, Mr. Drax.

202
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,309
You were with Bond last night
in my study.

203
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,393
No, I...

204
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,604
-You showed him the safe.
-I didn't.

205
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,524
I'm terminating your employment.
You will leave immediately.

206
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,119
Franco, I'll call you
to tell you where to meet me.

207
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,891
Could I interest you in something?

208
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,769
Why, I'm tempted to say yes immediately.

209
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,397
But I think maybe
I'd better have a look around.

210
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,983
Please. Go anywhere you wish.

211
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,529
And in 1955,
the Venini Museum and Glass Works

212
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,448
was taken over by Drax Industries.

213
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,076
And here, ladies and gentlemen,
we have some of the rarest examples

214
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,661
of the glassblower's art.

215
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,373
As you know, everything was done
absolutely by hand.

216
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,293
Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati,

217
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:34,882
sometime between 1850 and 1860.
If you'd like to follow me over here.

218
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:43,307
This exquisite bowl was fashioned
about 1520, over 450 years ago.

219
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,352
If it ever came on the market,
it would certainly fetch a price

220
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,647
in excess of one million American dollars.

221
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:53,275
But if any of you are thinking
of taking it...

222
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,488
Now, we have here
a very early 17th century dish

223
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,240
with an aquamarine medallion.

224
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:03,160
Over here, we have
something very, very interesting.

225
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,621
This glass-handled sword,

226
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:09,208
the only one of its kind in the world,

227
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:13,003
was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century

228
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,296
and is the work of Bruno...

229
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,582
14th century.

230
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,504
Dr. Goodhead.

231
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,091
I can only hope your presence here
is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.

232
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:03,304
-I dislike being spied on.
-Well, don't we all?

233
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,890
You're staying at the Danieli, aren't you?

234
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:10,227
-Yes. How did you know?
-Well, I like to keep abreast of things.

235
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,565
May I ask what you're doing in Venice?

236
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,110
I'm addressing a seminar
of the European Space Commission.

237
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,154
My, heavy stuff.

238
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,364
But there again,
I keep forgetting that you are

239
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,159
more than just a very beautiful woman.

240
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,413
If you're trying to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.

241
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,415
I have more important things
on my mind.

242
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,584
Ah, that's what I'd like
to talk to you about.

243
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,545
-Dinner this evening?
-This evening I'm giving my address.

244
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:41,008
Well, then, can you think of reason
why we don't have a drink afterwards?

245
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,844
Not immediately. But I'm sure I shall.

246
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,558
Franco.

247
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,692
Play it again, Sam.

248
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,644
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Convalescing.

249
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,438
Your friend Cha just tried to kill me.

250
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,274
And you think I had something
to do with it?

251
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,027
Well, the thought
had flashed across my mind.

252
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:55,617
-What's Drax up to in that laboratory?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?

253
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:01,998
-You leaving me your telephone number?
-I don't see the point.

254
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,044
Ah, now I do.

255
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,757
Not what I want to get stuck with tonight.

256
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:16,513
James, why don't you
pour yourself a drink?

257
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,181
Thank you.

258
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,603
Daily diary.

259
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,444
Fairly deadly diary.

260
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,866
Bollinger.
If it's '69, you were expecting me.

261
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,763
Trifle overpowering, your scent.

262
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,109
Standard CIA equipment.

263
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,987
And the CIA
placed you with Drax, correct?

264
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,740
-Very astute of you, James.
-Oh, not really.

265
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,825
I have friends in low places.

266
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,662
Could this possibly be the moment
for us to pool our resources?

267
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,166
It could have its compensations.

268
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:43,016
Where are you
planning on going from here?

269
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,852
I'm not planning on going anywhere.

270
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,026
Oh, I suppose you're right, Holly.
We would be better off working together.

271
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,112
-Detente?
-Agreed.

272
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,990
-Understanding?
-Possibly.

273
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,077
-Cooperation?
-Maybe.

274
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,372
-Trust?
-Out of the question.

275
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,910
Send the night porter up
for my bags immediately, please.

276
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:54,629
I hope you know what you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge with this fellow Drax.

277
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,341
007 doesn't usually push the panic
button unless it's something serious.

278
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,717
-I should hope not.
-Good morning, Inspector.

279
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,427
-Good morning.
-I see you've covered everything

280
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,097
-with our Italian friends.
-Yes, sir.

281
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,695
-Is this it?
-Yes, sir.

282
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,741
Gas masks?

283
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:26,870
We can't afford to take
any chances, Minister.

284
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:04,073
Frederick Gray. What a surprise.

285
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,660
And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks.

286
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,414
You must excuse me, gentlemen,
not being English,

287
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,585
I sometimes find your sense of humor
rather difficult to follow.

288
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,676
On behalf of the British government,
I apologize.

289
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:28,932
I think you owe us an explanation, 007.

290
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:33,227
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

291
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,605
Your man
should be taken off the assignment.

292
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,732
I'll see you at the consulate.

293
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,902
I'll have to do what he says.

294
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:45,740
Well, before you do that, sir,
have Q do an analysis of this.

295
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,868
I took it from the laboratory.

296
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:52,538
Tell him to exercise extreme caution.
It is lethal.

297
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:56,125
So, there was a laboratory.

298
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:01,214
You better take two weeks
leave of absence, 007.

299
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:04,759
Do have any thoughts
about where you might go?

300
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:08,846
I've always had a hankering
to go to Rio, sir.

301
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,808
I think I can recall your mentioning it.

302
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:16,688
007, no slipups or we're both in trouble.

303
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,239
Yes, a minor crisis has been averted.

304
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,783
No, no, nothing serious,
but all merchandise

305
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,036
is to be rerouted as from today.

306
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,956
Now, regarding a replacement for Cha,

307
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,167
do you have someone in mind?

308
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,670
Oh, yes, well,
if you can get him, of course.

309
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:47,218
Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro
now boarding, gate number seven.

310
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,837
Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.

311
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:08,091
-The President Suite.
-Really?

312
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:13,012
Well, don't bother showing me the rest.
If I get lost, I'll take a cab.

313
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,784
-Do you come with the suite?
-It depends who's renting it.

314
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,537
Vodka martini? Shaken not stirred.

315
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,874
Why were you
following me from the airport?

316
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,336
I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.

317
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,507
I work for Station VH.
We have been asked to assist you.

318
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,968
M thinks of everything.

319
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:55,429
Tell me, Manuela, do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?

320
00:57:55,556 --> 00:58:00,268
C and W? Yes, Carlos and Wilmsberg.

321
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:02,478
They are very big importers in Rio.

322
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,481
A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe.

323
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:08,651
They have a warehouse
on Carioca Avenue.

324
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,862
I'd like to pay it a discreet visit tonight.

325
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:15,408
Tonight? I think you may find that
a little difficult.

326
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:20,037
Difficult or not,
it's something we have to do.

327
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,498
And meanwhile,

328
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:27,253
how do you kill five hours in Rio
if you don't samba?

329
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,241
-There's the warehouse.
-And not a soul about.

330
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:00,828
-I think there's a way around the back.
-Good thinking.

331
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:35,821
This is it.

332
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,951
Don't talk to any strange men. I'll be back.

333
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:37,086
-Are you all right?
-Yes, but I'd rather dance with you.

334
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,381
I did tell you
not to talk to any strange men.

335
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,927
-Did you find anything in there?
-Only this.

336
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,305
"Drax Air Freight."

337
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,849
Do you know which airport
they operate from?

338
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:53,310
Yes. San Pietro.
Do you want me to take you there?

339
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,105
No, I think you need some rest.

340
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,940
-Come on. I'll drop you off.
-Okay.

341
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:33,702
-Haven't we met before somewhere?
-The face is familiar, as is the manner.

342
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,540
It's become distinctly chilly since Venice.

343
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,458
Well, that was
before you walked out on me.

344
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:42,503
Yes, nearly tripping over your suitcase
on the way through the door.

345
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,879
So?

346
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:47,883
So why waste time
working against each other?

347
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:52,263
I've checked Drax's warehouse in town.
It's empty.

348
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,764
That's no surprise. Since I've been here,

349
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,225
those planes have been
taking off every two hours.

350
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,603
-Yes. He's moving out.
-Where to?

351
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,731
That's what we're going to find out,

352
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:05,150
now that we're working together.

353
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:14,868
-I still don't know if I trust you.
-I don't know if I trust you either.

354
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,373
That's what makes it
more exciting, doesn't it?

355
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:55,242
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

356
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,203
But I'm sure we're better off out than in.

357
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,873
Bring that chain.

358
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:32,237
-Hang on, James.
-The thought had occurred to me.

359
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,320
I might have guessed.

360
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,864
-Do you know him?
-Not socially.

361
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,450
His name's Jaws. He kills people.

362
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,356
Here, give me the chain.

363
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,286
Come on. Hang on to me.

364
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,242
Jump.

365
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,061
-Have you broken something?
-Only my tailor's heart.

366
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,236
-What was that for?
-For saving my life.

367
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:43,572
Remind me to do it more often.

368
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:59,004
Oh, thank you, but we're in great shape.

369
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,076
Sorry about that.

370
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:09,444
James! You look as though
you've just fallen off a mountain.

371
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,905
Well, it's funny
you should say that, Moneypenny.

372
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:15,742
As a matter of fact,
I was in a cable car and...

373
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:18,537
-Never mind.
-The other courtyard.

374
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:26,086
-Ah, there you are, 007.
-Balls, Q?

375
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,046
Bolas, 007.

376
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:44,938
-Good. Have that ready for Army Day.
-Yes, sir.

377
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,899
-Where's M?
-He's in the office over there.

378
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,620
This way.

379
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,958
-Good morning, 007.
-Good morning, sir.

380
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:08,753
-You're just in time. Sit down.
-Thank you, sir.

381
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,258
-Q's come up with something.
-Splendid.

382
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,470
-Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
-Afraid not. Right, Q.

383
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,474
Well, it's a breakdown on that phial
of liquid you picked up in Venice.

384
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,394
-You know, you seem to be right, 007.
-Thank you.

385
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:29,316
It's a highly toxic nerve gas that
appears to have no effect on animals.

386
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,610
May I see the formula?

387
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,704
It's a chemical formula of a plant.

388
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:49,002
Orchideae anegra.
A very rare orchid indeed.

389
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,379
Yes. It was thought to be extinct.

390
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:55,508
Until a missionary brought one back
from the upper reaches of the Amazoco.

391
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:58,553
Well, actually he brought it back
from the area of the River Tapirape.

392
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:02,557
Well done, James.
You better get up there and fast.

393
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:07,729
And I've got something to get him there,
if 007 can be trusted to look after it.

394
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:17,969
Mr. Bond, you defy all my attempts
to plan an amusing death for you.

395
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,680
You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond.

396
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,850
Why did you break off
the encounter with my pet python?

397
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,477
I discovered he had a crush on me.

398
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:28,604
Jaws.

399
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:43,661
Moonraker One on preset
launch program, minus two minutes.

400
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:46,122
Retract crew access arm.

401
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,541
CAA retracted.

402
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,378
-Transfer orbiter power.
-Internal power transferred.

403
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,338
Activate hydraulics.

404
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:58,176
-Hydraulics activated.
-Activate auxiliary power unit.

405
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:02,346
-APU activated.
-LH2 replenish.

406
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:06,559
-Status confirmed.
-Pressurize MPS helium tanks.

407
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,270
Helium flight pressure confirmed.

408
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,775
What exactly are you up to here, Drax?

409
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:17,779
-And why the orchids?
-The curse of a civilization.

410
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,782
It was neither war nor pestilence
that wiped out the race

411
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:24,285
who built the great city lying around us.

412
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,705
It was their reverence
for this lovely flower.

413
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:32,335
Because long-term exposure
to its pollen caused sterility.

414
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,712
Correct, Mr. Bond.

415
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:38,549
As you discovered,
I have improved upon sterility.

416
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:42,220
Those same seeds now yield death.

417
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:47,975
Not, of course, to animals or plant life.
One must preserve the balance of nature.

418
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,686
Moonraker launch program
now commencing.

419
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:52,271
Minus 20 seconds.

420
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:55,817
-SRB gimbal profile.
-Activated.

421
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,151
-Cooling pumps.
-On.

422
01:25:57,236 --> 01:26:00,071
-IMU to inertial.
-IMU confirmed.

423
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,281
Moonraker One, liftoff.

424
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,582
We have liftoff.

425
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:18,339
Moonraker Two,
T minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

426
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:24,303
five, four, three, two, one.

427
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,556
Main engine start.

428
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,517
Moonraker Two, liftoff.

429
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:37,400
-Moonraker Three.
-Moonraker Three, liftoff.

430
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:41,279
-Moonraker Two, confirm program pitch.
-PP confirmed.

431
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,865
Moonraker Four
on preset launch program.

432
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,908
Moonraker Four, liftoff.

433
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,786
Moonraker One, SRB jettison.

434
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:54,125
We have separation. Confirmed.

435
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,295
Moonraker Three, confirm program pitch.

436
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:00,506
Moonraker Five,
on preset launch program.

437
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:03,885
-Minus ten...
-Drax, one more thing.

438
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,554
You delivered a shuttle
to the U.S. government,

439
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,432
then you hijacked it. Why?

440
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:13,269
Because I needed it.

441
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:17,648
One of my own Moonrakers
developed a fault during assembly.

442
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:21,277
Now, you have distracted me enough.

443
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:25,740
Jaws,
Mr. Bond must be cold after his swim.

444
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:28,576
Place him where he can
be assured of warmth.

445
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:32,246
-Confirmed.
-Moonraker Two, go for orbit.

446
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:34,290
Velocity, 1,000 feet per second.

447
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:37,251
-All systems...
-SRB jettison.

448
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,837
Separation motors fired.

449
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:44,634
Moonraker Five, cleared for launch.

450
01:27:58,607 --> 01:27:59,899
James.

451
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:06,197
Thank God, you're safe.

452
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:10,201
Moonraker Five, transfer orbiter power.

453
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,926
Hydraulics activated.

454
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:31,263
-Activate auxiliary power unit.
-APU activated.

455
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:34,016
-LH2 replenish.
-Confirm.

456
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:37,395
Even in death,
my munificence is boundless.

457
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,855
When this rocket lifts off,

458
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:43,109
I shall be leaving you
in your own private crematorium.

459
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:48,072
Mr. Bond, Dr. Goodhead,
I bid you farewell.

460
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:53,911
-EPS, power on.
-EPS, power confirmed.

461
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,003
Come on, the air vent.

462
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:07,842
Fuel tanks go, and go.

463
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,976
Moonraker Five, preset.

464
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,562
External LH2 pressure.

465
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:26,444
-Retract crew access arm.
-CAA retracted.

466
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,988
Get back quick.

467
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:36,787
T minus ten seconds, nine,

468
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,331
seven,

469
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,876
-six, five, four...
-Bang on time.

470
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,962
-four, three, two...
-Come on, quick.

471
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,759
Straight on.

472
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,441
Moonraker Six,
astro-technicians prepare to embark.

473
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:13,282
I repeat, Moonraker Six
astro-technicians, prepare to embark.

474
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:21,624
-Moonraker Five crew.
-All systems go.

475
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,131
Moonraker Six, start launch sequence.

476
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:35,346
-Go for orbit.
-Confirm.

477
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:39,266
We have separation.

478
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:42,561
Moonraker Five ground crew stand down.

479
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:45,064
Thrust 6.8 million pounds.

480
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,459
We're going the wrong way.

481
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:16,011
Moonraker Six,
preset launch program completed.

482
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,889
Pilots proceed from base to launch area.

483
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:35,322
Shuttle go. Boosters go.

484
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,534
Launch pad go.

485
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,955
-External LO2 pressure?
-Confirmed, 21 psia.

486
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:48,377
-External LH2 pressure?
-Confirmed, 42.5 psia.

487
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:51,172
-IECF to internal power.
-CAA retracted.

488
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:55,134
Moonraker Six cleared for launch.
T minus 10 seconds.

489
01:31:55,218 --> 01:32:01,015
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

490
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:04,393
three, two, one, go.

491
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:08,022
It's all right.
We're on a prearranged flight program.

492
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:00,574
That's Drax in Moonraker Five.

493
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:17,800
-What about the others?
-I don't know. Let's see.

494
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,098
We're all on parallel courses.

495
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:27,017
So, we must be headed
for a rendezvous in orbit.

496
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:16,984
Let's see what cargo we have.

497
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:30,998
-The animals went in two by two.
-What do you mean by that?

498
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:33,500
Noah's Ark. This operation.

499
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,907
We're converging.

500
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:13,457
-Control rockets?
-Yes, we're slowing down.

501
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,131
What's that?

502
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:57,793
There's no image on the radar scanner.

503
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:16,520
An entire city in space
and still nothing on the radar scanner.

504
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,607
-So nobody on Earth knows it's there.
-Right.

505
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:25,362
Drax must have a radar-jamming system.

506
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:31,118
All Moonrakers prepare
to initiate docking procedures

507
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,370
and continue radio silence.

508
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:03,650
Moonraker Six, you are now in manual.
Initiate docking sequence.

509
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:23,670
All shuttles now docked.
Execute station activation procedure.

510
01:38:56,764 --> 01:39:00,350
Gravity, normal conditions.
Life-support system, nominal.

511
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:06,773
Moonraker Six technicians,
commence operational sequence.

512
01:39:07,108 --> 01:39:10,152
-Sequence four initiated.
-Check airlock seals.

513
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:12,195
ALS secure.

514
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:21,830
All personnel to Command satellite.

515
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:26,043
All personnel to Command satellite.

516
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:32,299
All crews to M5 segment.

517
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:36,094
Moonraker Six technicians to M2 segment.

518
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:39,473
Moonraker One and Three to M1 segment.

519
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:44,144
Moonraker Four and Five to M4 segment.

520
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:47,314
Moonraker Two to M5 segment.

521
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:52,569
Units four and seven,
man console as planned.

522
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:57,824
Units one, three, five and six,
assume pre-assigned stations.

523
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:00,202
-Pressure on-line?
-Confirmed.

524
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:02,162
-Life support?
-Normal.

525
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:11,254
Those are the globes I saw in Venice
with the nerve gas phials inside.

526
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:20,764
First there was a dream.
Now there is reality.

527
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:25,519
Here in the untainted
cradle of the heavens

528
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:28,689
will be created a new super-race,

529
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:33,443
a race of perfect physical specimens.

530
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:38,532
You have been selected
as its progenitors, like gods.

531
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:43,578
Your offspring will return to Earth
and shape it in their image.

532
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:48,333
You have all served in humble capacities
in my terrestrial empire.

533
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:50,544
Your seed, like yourselves,

534
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:56,591
will pay deference to the ultimate
dynasty which I alone have created.

535
01:40:56,676 --> 01:41:01,513
From their first day on Earth
they will be able to look up

536
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:07,144
and know that there is
law and order in the heavens.

537
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:12,524
All units, start Operation Orchid.

538
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:20,449
If we were visible from Earth,
they'd investigate.

539
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:23,452
Where do you suppose
that radar-jamming system is?

540
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:27,456
We didn't pass anything on the way here,
so let's try this way.

541
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,793
Station two, check coordinates,
mode four.

542
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:36,923
Initiate globe launch timing sequence.

543
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:40,177
Orbital communicator, level 10.
Zero gravity.

544
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:07,871
This is it, the radar-jamming system.

545
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:15,629
-Coordinate conversion program.
-Check.

546
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:19,216
-Side lobe gain.
-Check.

547
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,010
-Spectral response.
-Check.

548
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:28,141
-Spin stabilizer correction factor.
-Okay.

549
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:30,560
Gigahertz reflector efficiency.

550
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,731
Solar photon screen.

551
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:58,672
Where did you learn to fight like that?
NASA?

552
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,131
No, Vassar.

553
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:12,894
-Switched off?
-Permanently.

554
01:43:12,979 --> 01:43:14,312
Now we can be spotted from Earth.

555
01:43:18,776 --> 01:43:22,863
-This doesn't look good at all.
-It's over 200 meters in diameter.

556
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:25,365
Yes, yes.

557
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:28,660
Will you please listen, General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.

558
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:33,832
Neither did we, Colonel Scott.
So what are you suggesting?

559
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:37,669
We've taken action already.
We're sending up a vehicle to intercept.

560
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:41,381
Very well, but if we don't hear from you
in the next 12 hours

561
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:45,135
we take action ourselves and hold you
responsible for the consequences.

562
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:49,180
We'll be in touch, General.

563
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:52,309
-Sorry to have woken you.
-I was already awake.

564
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:57,689
How can I sleep? Nothing but problems.

565
01:43:57,773 --> 01:44:00,692
Problems, problems.

566
01:44:01,903 --> 01:44:04,237
Marine astronauts to launch pad.

567
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:17,667
-Launch pre-program complete, sir.
-Launch globe number one.

568
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:18,853
T.D.R.S.S. reports a launch, sir.
Continental U.S.A. Vandenberg.

569
01:45:22,066 --> 01:45:26,236
There are no launches scheduled.
Check radar-jamming system.

570
01:45:29,365 --> 01:45:30,365
Well?

571
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:33,660
Jamming power supply
and backup have failed, sir.

572
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:37,622
-Investigate immediately.
-Investigate number 28, immediately.

573
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:41,918
James Bond.

574
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:47,257
You appear with the tedious
inevitability of an unloved season.

575
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:50,135
I didn't think
there were any seasons in space.

576
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:53,680
As far as you're concerned, only winter.

577
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:56,766
And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead.

578
01:45:56,851 --> 01:46:01,604
Despite your efforts, my finely
wrought dream approaches its fulfillment.

579
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:06,359
Your dream, whatever sort of nightmare
it is, hasn't a chance, Drax.

580
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:09,571
You think not? We shall see.

581
01:46:09,655 --> 01:46:12,157
We're coming up to
second launch position.

582
01:46:12,241 --> 01:46:14,200
Launch globe number two.

583
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:29,924
No doubt you have realized
the splendor of my conception.

584
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:33,553
First, a necklace of death about the Earth.

585
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:39,601
50 globes, each releasing its nerve gas
over a designated area,

586
01:46:39,685 --> 01:46:43,730
each capable of killing 100 million people.

587
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:49,527
And the human race as you know it
will cease to exist.

588
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:54,240
Then a rebirth, a new world.

589
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:57,035
U.S. spacecraft on course
to intercept us, sir.

590
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:02,499
Activate laser.
Prepare to destroy spacecraft.

591
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:21,851
You see, my dear Bond, we're well able
to protect ourselves against all enemies.

592
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:29,150
Allow me to introduce you
to the airlock chamber.

593
01:47:29,235 --> 01:47:34,280
Observe, Mr. Bond, your route
from this world to the next.

594
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,622
And you, Dr. Goodhead.

595
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:45,416
Your desire to be
America's first woman in space

596
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:47,460
will shortly be fulfilled.

597
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:52,966
Leaving you on your flying stud farm,
conceiving your new master race?

598
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:55,260
If you like, yes.

599
01:47:55,344 --> 01:48:00,723
And of course, anyone not measuring up
to your standards of physical perfection

600
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:04,727
-will be exterminated.
-Certainly.

601
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:09,983
Interesting.

602
01:48:10,067 --> 01:48:11,442
Most interesting.

603
01:48:11,527 --> 01:48:14,571
Jaws, expel them.

604
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,745
Jaws! You obey me!

605
01:48:29,086 --> 01:48:30,420
Expel them!

606
01:48:43,309 --> 01:48:44,642
Hold them!

607
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:51,107
Sir, U.S. spacecraft,
three minutes to intercept.

608
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:53,610
Stand by to laser it.

609
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:06,122
-Initiate firing sequence.
-Initiating.

610
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:10,627
U.S. spacecraft in laser range,
25.5 and closing.

611
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:13,546
Range 15.

612
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:14,964
Range 10.

613
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:24,307
Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two...

614
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:48,498
It's stopped rotating.

615
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:27,662
Open the cargo doors.

616
01:50:33,794 --> 01:50:36,796
Number one platoon, EVA.

617
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,881
Number one platoon, EVA.

618
01:51:36,774 --> 01:51:37,899
Let's try docking.

619
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:16,604
Colonel Scott will take the first landing!

620
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:19,816
Intruders have docked
at satellite seven, sir.

621
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,486
Double the guard at every entrance
in this satellite.

622
01:52:23,612 --> 01:52:26,406
Report intruders' progress
throughout the space station.

623
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:28,699
Number three globe
ready for launching, sir.

624
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:29,826
Proceed!

625
01:52:40,462 --> 01:52:44,048
Group One, attack enemy.
All units shoot to kill.

626
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:54,517
-Colonel Scott, don't shoot.
-Hold your fire.

627
01:52:55,018 --> 01:53:00,106
Corridor five penetrated. Intruders
advancing on Command satellite.

628
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:02,567
Maintenance crew needed, section three.

629
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:13,638
At least I shall have the pleasure
of putting you out of my misery.

630
01:54:16,725 --> 01:54:18,476
Desolated, Mr. Bond?

631
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:24,690
Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.

632
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,236
Allow me.

633
01:54:30,489 --> 01:54:32,740
Take a giant step for mankind.

634
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:52,009
-Where's Drax?
-He had to fly.

635
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:53,844
How's Scott doing?

636
01:54:53,929 --> 01:54:55,096
He's got control
of the Command satellite.

637
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:57,515
We put the launching gear
for the globes out of action.

638
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:00,977
When the station breaks up,
they'll disintegrate. They'll harm no one.

639
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:03,104
But the three that have gone,
they'll kill millions.

640
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:05,523
Those three must be destroyed.

641
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:18,828
Come on!

642
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:28,004
Colonel, get your men off
as quickly as possible.

643
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:30,131
Your mission is completed.

644
01:55:30,215 --> 01:55:32,883
Sergeant, round up your men,
get them back to the shuttle. Fast!

645
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:35,261
Back to the shuttle, everybody!
On the double!

646
01:56:00,996 --> 01:56:03,956
Moonraker Five, that's the answer.
Drax's shuttle is armed with a laser.

647
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:06,500
We can track those globes
and destroy them.

648
01:56:09,087 --> 01:56:12,048
It's hopeless, sir. The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.

649
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:13,924
All right, let's go.

650
01:57:02,099 --> 01:57:04,141
Docking release system is jammed.

651
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:35,840
Release the door lock.
I'll see if I can operate it manually.

652
01:57:35,924 --> 01:57:37,508
It's jammed too.

653
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:54,525
Well, here's to us.

654
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:14,336
Jaws, we can't disengage.
The docking release system is jammed.

655
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:16,380
Can you help us?

656
01:58:40,906 --> 01:58:42,281
We're free.

657
01:58:57,923 --> 01:59:01,717
Don't worry, they'll make it.
It's only 100 miles to Earth.

658
01:59:01,802 --> 01:59:03,385
Let's get a read-out on those globes.

659
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:30,079
I have the three globes on the screen.
We should have a visual in a minute.

660
01:59:38,755 --> 01:59:40,172
There it is.

661
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:47,930
The laser's on automatic. Code 945 set.

662
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:05,239
One down, two to go.

663
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:11,120
Number two straight ahead.

664
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:19,420
What is it?

665
02:00:19,504 --> 02:00:21,755
We're skipping on the Earth's atmosphere.

666
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,132
In range.

667
02:00:32,809 --> 02:00:37,646
-We should see the last one soon.
-There it is.

668
02:00:47,449 --> 02:00:49,408
-It's getting hot.
-It can't be helped.

669
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:53,454
I'm coming in at a steeper angle than I
should in order to catch that last globe.

670
02:01:00,754 --> 02:01:05,716
I can't hold this course much longer.
We'll break up at 200,000 feet.

671
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,509
Just a few seconds more.

672
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:22,608
Automatic firing system negative.
Must be the heat. Switching to manual.

673
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:39,625
Controls aren't responding.

674
02:01:42,712 --> 02:01:46,256
-The wings are beginning to glow.
-Just hold her steady.

675
02:01:48,677 --> 02:01:49,885
Steady.

676
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:08,862
It's entering Earth's atmosphere!
James, this is our last chance.

677
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:13,534
Steady.

678
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:36,098
Colonel Scott reports picking up
two survivors from the space station,

679
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:38,308
a tall man and a short blonde woman.

680
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:41,103
Right. Okay.

681
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:43,772
Dr. Goodhead reported their position
20 minutes ago.

682
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:46,984
They're just coming into range
of our tracking ship in the Pacific Ocean.

683
02:02:47,068 --> 02:02:48,527
We should have audiovisual
within a few minutes

684
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:50,279
from the remote onboard TV monitors.

685
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:58,704
Houston calling Dr. Goodhead.
Houston calling. Confirm your position.

686
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:07,921
As this is the first joint venture
between our two countries,

687
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:11,925
I'm having it patched directly to
the White House and Buckingham Palace.

688
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:14,970
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty
will be fascinated.

689
02:03:15,055 --> 02:03:17,473
-We have audiovisual.
-Ah, at last.

690
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:31,487
-007.
-My God, what's Bond doing?

691
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:34,198
I think he's attempting re-entry, sir.

692
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:50,881
-James?
-I think it may be time to go home.

693
02:03:50,965 --> 02:03:54,343
Take me round the world one more time.

694
02:03:54,427 --> 02:03:56,427
Why not?
