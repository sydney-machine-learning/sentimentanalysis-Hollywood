5
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:16,316
- Private screening?
- Yeah, they're afraid to show it in public

6
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:18,509
(Statler) Look at this place.
What a dump.

7
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:21,247
(Waldorf) Bunch of weirdos around here.
Look at 'em.

8
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:27,123
- Yes, I know you all want to sit with moi
- Hey, lady. Is this seat taken?

9
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,661
Hey. you!
Hey! Bring that back.

10
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:33,893
I'm so nervous. If I'm not funny.
I won't be able to live with myself.

11
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:36,936
Well. then you'll have to get
another apartment. won't you?

12
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,905
You know.
I hear this movie is dynamite.

13
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:44,205
Get your fresh organic popcorn.
Only a buck.

14
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:46,301
Oh. honey.
Buy me some. please.

15
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,006
Oh. sure. Momma.
Nothin's too good for my woman.

16
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:52,414
Woman!
Woman! Woman!

17
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:56,779
- Well. I like the movie fine so far.
- It hasn't started yet.

18
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:59,517
That's what I like about it.

19
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,587
Do it.

20
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,063
Oh. hey. Mr. the Frog.

21
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:12,194
Is it OK for me and my boomerang fish
to be in your movie?

22
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,531
Hey!

23
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,505
I told you. Lew.
Not in the movie or at the screening.

24
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,906
Hey. but watch.
Whoa!

25
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:22,776
Kermit. does this film
have socially redeeming value?

26
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:26,977
Oh. I... I certainly hope so. Sam.
Sorry about that.

27
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,417
- Kermie.
- Oh. hi. Piggy.

28
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:32,945
Kermie, I tried to save you a seat,
but somebody took it.

29
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:36,858
Hi. everybody. and welcome
to the first screening of The Muppet Movie.

30
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:39,691
(cheering)

31
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:43,392
But before we begin. I'd like to thank
everyone who contributed to this film.

32
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:49,029
Starting with the little people.
from the hairdressers to special effects.

33
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:51,164
That's enough of that. Harry.

34
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:54,073
Boom!
Blow it up. Ka-boom!

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,134
- (Muppet) Boring.
- To the costume designers.

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,770
- To the prop makers.
- (Piggy) Kermie. Kermie.

37
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:01,942
Speeches are not necessary. dear.
Roll film.

38
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:06,580
Yeah. but I'd like to thank everybody
for all of their hard work and their patience

39
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,590
- and their...
- Roll film! Roll film!

40
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,687
Roll film.

41
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,689
Shh!

42
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:26,939
Excuse me.

43
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:32,402
Uncle Kermit. is this about
how the Muppets really got started?

44
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:36,246
Well. it's sort of approximately
how it happened.

45
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,997
(I "The Rainbow Connection')

46
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:53,889
(Kermit) I Why are there so many
songs about rainbows

47
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:58,418
I And what's on the other side?

48
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,265
I Rainbows are visions

49
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,394
I But only illusions

50
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:11,135
I And rainbows have nothing to hide

51
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,038
J' So we've been told

52
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:19,072
I And some choose to believe it

53
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:23,644
J' I know they're wrong
wait and see

54
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:28,325
I Someday we-'II find it

55
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:31,452
I The rainbow connection

56
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:36,022
I The lovers.
the dreamers and me

57
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:43,936
I Who said that every wish

58
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,976
I Would be heard and answered

59
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:51,879
I When wished on the morning star?

60
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:56,519
I Somebody thought of that

61
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:59,817
I And someone believed it

62
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:04,724
J' Look what it's done so far

63
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,689
I What's so amazing

64
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:12,063
I That keeps us stargazing?

65
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,468
I And what do we think we might see?

66
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,442
I Someday we-'II find it

67
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:24,570
I The rainbow connection

68
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:29,413
I The lovers.
the dreamers and me

69
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,682
I All of us under its spell

70
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:40,854
I We know that it's probably magic

71
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,995
I Have you been half asleep?

72
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:48,331
I And have you heard voices?

73
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:53,340
I I've heard them calling my name

74
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,401
I Is this the sweet sound

75
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:00,606
I That calls the young sailors?

76
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:05,345
I The voice might be
one and the same

77
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:12,957
I I've heard it too many times
to ignore it

78
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:18,021
I it's something that
I'm supposed to be

79
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:22,458
I Someday we-'II find it

80
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:25,367
I The rainbow connection

81
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:30,466
I The lovers.
the dreamers and me

82
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:32,909
I La da-da de

83
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,674
I Da-da me

84
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:36,908

(man) Help! Hello.

87
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:50,556
This is a serious call for help.

88
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,461
- Yeah?
- Someone help.

89
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,694
Ah. I...
Oh. Oh.

90
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:00,262
You. you with the banjo.

91
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:03,501
Can you help me?
I have lost my sense of direction.

92
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,941
Have you tried Hare Krishna?

93
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,171
Ha ha. No.

94
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,543
- No. I mean I'm really lost.
- (buzzing)

95
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,604
One second.

96
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:14,845
Darn. I missed. You know.
that's the first thing to go on a frog.

97
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,820
His tongue.
The tongue goes and you can't catch flies.

98
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:20,049
Oh. that's rough.
I'm sorry about your tongue.

99
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,922
But I have to get out of this swamp.
I have to catch a plane.

100
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,223
With that tongue?
No way.

101
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,564
But seriously.
there-'s a boat dock just downstream.

102
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,623
- Thank you.
- Just watch out for the alligators.

103
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,863
I will

104
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:35,769
- Alligators?
- That's right.

105
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:40,334
- Did you say alligators?
- Read my lips - alligators.

106
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,073
It's just that I'm not used to alligators
where I come from.

107
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:47,378
See. I'm an agent.
I... I winged in from Hollywood.

108
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:49,213

- That's right.

109
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:53,380
- Did you say Hollywood?
- Read my lips - Hollywood.

110
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,082
You know...

Hey. don't you ever go to the movies?

113
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:03,859
Oh. sure. There-'s a double feature
in town every Saturday.

114
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,298

116
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:10,738

00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,968
- Feast your eyes on that.
- Uh...

I'd miss this old swamp. but...

140

I told you not to step on it.
We gotta get this... Off the asphalt!

141
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,475

That's pretty dangerous.
building a road in the middle of the street.

149
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:27,566
I mean. if frogs couldn't hop.
I'd be gone with the Schwinn.

150
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:32,772
(Kermit) The El Sleezo Cafe.

151
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:37,236
Hm.

152
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,912
Foreign food.

153
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:44,385
Doesn't smell promising
but a frog's gotta eat.

154
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,251
(arguing and fighting)

155
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:48,484

Rough place. huh?

158
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,798
That's the toughest. meanest. filthiest.
pesthole on the face of the Earth.

159
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:08,207
Well. why not complain to the owner?

160
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:10,745
I am the owner.

161
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:34,363
(man) Watch out.
Hot plates comin' through. Look out.

162

All right, you got
your French-fried frog legs on Cotton

You got your frog legs on Eugenie.
You got your frog legs stroganoff.

164
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:43,633
- Everybody happy? All right.

165
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:54,413
Hello. sailor.
Buy me a drink?

166
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:56,479
Well. you see.
I'm not a sailor. I'm a frog.

167
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:59,048
Cut the small talk
and buy me a drink.

168
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:03,756
- But I don't even know you.
- Hey. You makin' a move on my girl?

169
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,958
- No. sir.
- He did too. He touched me.

170
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:08,865
Ugh! Go wash.
You'll get warts.

Thank you, sir.
Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka.

This guy's lost.

189
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,792
Maybe he should try Hare Krishna.

190
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,601
- Grief. it's a running gag.
- Uh...

191
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,933
There was this sailor who was so fat...

192
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,598
How fat was he?

193
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,004
Uh...

194
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:29,137
He was so fat that everybody liked him and
there was nothing funny about him at all.

195
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,407
(booing)

196
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,278

Oh, wait, please.
Oh, please. Please wait

198
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,345
I'm trying so hard.
Please don't do that.

199
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,349
I'm a professional.
I've had three performances.

200
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,451
- Cut. cut. please.
- Do you know any dance routines?

201
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,655
What? Not really.
Do you?

202
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,797
- Play something snappy.
- You got it.

203
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,461

204
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,060

Aha. wacka. wacka.

209
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:05,970
Ah!

210
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:11,716
It's too bad the dancing girls
are on vacation. The crowd is getting ugly.

211
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:17,783
Ha ha. You think this crowd's ugly.
you should see the dancing girls.

212
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:23,459
(Fozzie) Two. three. four.

213
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:27,860

00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,851
(Kermit groans)

219
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:13,173
I hope you appreciate
that I'm doing all my own stunts

220
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,443

00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:36,498
(man) I don't see no drinks up here.
What's he talkin' about?

227
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,868
The bartender said
there were drinks on the house.

228
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,176
Works every time.

229
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,143
Well...
Well. hey. listen.

230
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,807
My name is Kermit the Frog

231
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,577
- Hollywood?
- You wanna join me?

232
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:55,245
Big-time show biz.
That's always been my dream.

233
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:58,119
Yeah, well, they're holding auditions
for frogs next week.

234
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,351
And if they need frogs.
they must need bears too.

235
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:02,223
Oh.

236
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:04,023
My car's right outside.

237
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,998
Gee. a Studebaker.
Where did you get it?

238
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:11,797
- Oh. my uncle left it to me.
- Huh? Is he dead?

239
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:14,202
No. he-'s hibernating.

240
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:32,153
You know. Fozzie.
you really do have a lot of talent.

241
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,554
Thank you.

242
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,526
You know. how about you and me

243
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:39,926
Oh. no. Sorry.
I only work as a single.

244
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:41,658
Oh. OK.

245

246
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,901
Oh. good.

247
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,999

- Hey. you better pull over here.

248
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:54,907

(brakes screech)

250
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,411

251
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:01,473
Hey. what's going on?

252

Howdy. Mr. Frog.

253
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,122
- I'm a businessman with a proposition.

254
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:11,489
Let me show you some-thin'

- Listen. mister.
- That's it.

258
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,036
This is the kind of chance
you can't afford to pass up.

259
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:27,701
- (Kermit gasps)
- Oh. no. now. don't be afraid.

260
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,870

(Kermit winces)

275
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:18,285
That is terrible. That's the most appalling.
disgusting. revolting thing I've ever seen.

276
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:20,623
I know. I'm a great businessman
and a sweet fella.

277
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:24,789
- But I do lack the skills of a performer.
- You also make a lousy frog.

278
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:27,663
You. on the other hand.

There-'s $500 in it for you up-front.

284
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,207
$500 is just the beginning.

285
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:49,084
You could be earning this much
every year.

286
00:19:49,477 --> 00:19:52,117
- Let's go. Fozzie.
- $500?

287
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,984
Would you consider
a bear in a frog suit?

288
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,394
- Fozzie.
- Yes. sir. I just lost my head. I...

335
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,595
Ah.

336
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:29,369
A bear in his natural habitat.

337
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,875
A Studebaker.

338
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,012
- (Kermit) Hey. Fozzie. look up ahead.
- What is that?

339
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,878
(Kermit) Maybe we should give him a ride.

340
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,147
(Fozzie) I don't know.
He-'s pretty big.

341
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,587
- Hey. there. Wanna lift?
- Oh. no thanks.

342
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:48,684
I'm on my way to New York City
to try to break into public television.

343
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:50,660
Ah.

344
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:52,060
Good luck.

345
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:59,700
(both) I Movin' right along.
we-'re truly birds of a feather

346
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,933
I We-'re in this together

347
00:23:01,995 --> 00:23:04,441
(Kermit) I And we know where we-'re goin'

348
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:08,537
I Movie stars with flashy cars
and life with the top down

349
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:11,139
I We-'re stormin' the big town

350
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:13,276
Yeah. storm is right.
Should it be snowing?

351
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,943
No. I don't think so.

352
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:17,009
(both) I Movin' right along

353
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,886
(Kermit) I Footloose and fancy-free

354
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:21,857
I You're ready for the big time

355
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,360
I Is it ready for me?

356
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:32,363
I Movin' right along

357
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:36,870
I Movin' right along

358
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:41,135
I Movin' right along

359
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:46,145
I Movin' right along

360
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:47,683
(Kermit) Hey.

361
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:50,117
Hey. Fozzie.
look up ahead there.

362
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:52,985
There-'s one of those
Doc Hopper billboards.

363
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:56,582
- Maybe you'd better pull over.
- Yes. sir.

364
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,685
Oh. look at that.

365
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:02,793
Kermit. that's you.

366
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:04,231
(laughs)

367
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,792
You got the picture. boy?
You see what I mean?

368
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:11,135
Kermit the Frog, symbol of Doc Hopper's
French-fried frog legs.

369
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:15,666
Isn't that splendid? Just splendid.
Just take a look at it.

370
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:19,146
All I can see are millions of frogs
on tiny crutches.

371
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,046
Now. listen. boy.
Don't you wanna be rich and famous?

372
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:26,179
- Not workin' for you. I don't.
- That's right.

373
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:29,622
- Crutches?
- Shut up. Max.

374
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,422
We-'re a small-time operation.
but we-'re expandin'.

375
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:35,396
Expandin'. just like you frogs expand.

376
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:37,728
Don't you frogs expand?

377
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:40,265
- That's a myth.
- What?

378
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:43,532
- Myth! Myth!
- Yeth?

379
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:44,901
(both) Hmm...?

380
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:50,006
- Come on. Bear. Burn rubber.
- Yes. sir.

381
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,239
Hey. Frog!

382
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:56,205
That's the second time!

383
00:24:56,272 --> 00:25:00,277
Max. I've done my best with that frog.
Now's the time to do my worst.

384
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:02,653
- Open the door.
- No! You open the door.

385
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:05,556
- What?
- I'm through. Doc. The frog is right.

386
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:08,220
You're asking him to do something terrible.
I can't be a part of it.

387
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:10,627
It's a moral decision
and I'll stand by it.

388
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:15,135
- I'll double your percentage.
- I'll open the door.

389
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:21,299
- (Fozzie) Kermit. where are we?
- Well. let's see.

390
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:24,503
We were just traveling down
this little black line here.

391
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,342
And we just crossed
that little red line over here.

392
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,281
(Fozzie) Oh. well. how about...
Let's take the blue line. huh?

393
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:33,946
- No. we can't take that. That's a river.
- Oh. I knew that.

394
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,614
- Yeah. sure.
- Listen. Kermit. why don't we just go...

395
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:39,283
- Fozzie. Fozzie.
- Yeah?

396
00:25:39,347 --> 00:25:41,349
Who's driving?

397
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:44,156
Agh!

398
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:47,722
- (Kermit) Look out! Stop!
- (Fozzie) No problem.

399
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,661
- OK. back it up.
- Yes. sir.

400
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:57,267
- Fozzie. where did you learn to drive?
- I took a correspondence course.

401
00:25:58,032 --> 00:26:03,105
- (Kermit) This looks like a nice quiet spot.
- Uh-huh.

402
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:06,875
Boy, it feels like
we've been driving for days

403
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,477
Yeah.
Funny. I'm still wide awake.

404
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,215
Yeah. me too.

405
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:13,279
(Snares)

406
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:16,483
Me too.

407
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:21,258
(keyboard music)

408
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:26,397
- (band plays)
- What? What? What? I'm up. I'm up.

409
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,767
What's that?

410
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,841
They don't look
like Presbyterians to me.

411
00:26:50,883 --> 00:26:53,090
Hey. cool it. everybody.

412
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:55,996
Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.

413
00:26:56,055 --> 00:27:00,264
Our gentle mornin' melodies
have attracted wanderin' admirers.

414
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:03,965
- Hey. who are you guys?
- We am. is. are and be

415
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:07,703
they whom as are known as
the Electric Mayhem.

416
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,676
For sure.

417
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:11,941
He-'s Dr. Teeth.

418
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:16,509
Golden teeth and golden tones.
Welcome to my presence.

419
00:27:16,574 --> 00:27:18,611
- Thank you.
- Fozzie.

420
00:27:18,676 --> 00:27:23,557
- I'm Floyd. I blow bass.
- And I'm... I'm...

421
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:25,685
Zoot. Sax is your ax

422
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,730
Uh-oh.
Zoot's skipped a groove again.

423
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:32,733
Wow. like. I'm Janice.
I'm lead guitar. for surely.

424
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:34,791
(roars)

425
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:39,370
Oh. yeah. That's Animal.
Show 'em what you do. Animal.

426
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:42,103
I want to eat drums.

427
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,837
No. no.
Beat drums. beat drums.

428
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:50,111
Beat drums. Beat drums.

429
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:55,281
- Down. Animal. Back. Sit.
- Down. Back. Sit.

430
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:58,416
(Muppet) Hey. don't forget about me.

431
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,791
I'm Scooter.
the band's road manager.

432
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,320
Oh. yeah. The road manager.
We couldn't go anywhere without him.

433
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:09,165
- He's the man with the contacts?
- No. he's the man with the van.

434
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:12,502
Yeah. we're takin' this old church
and turnin' it into a coffeehouse.

435
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:17,032
Yeah. with real good music
and organic refreshments.

436
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:20,842
It'll be so fine and laid-back
and mellow and profitable.

437
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:22,849
(Animal) Profitable.

438
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:25,145
Yeah. but what brings you dudes here?

439
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:28,710
Oh. listen. see. Kermit here.
he was living in the swamp...

440
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,119
- Fozzie.
- ...and then a fisherman came along.

441
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:35,321
Fozzie. you can't tell 'em the whole story.
You'll bore the audience.

442
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:36,885
Oh. sorry.

443
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:41,730
- But. Kermit. the band here wants to know.
- Well. let 'em read the screenplay.

444
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,292
Ah. yes. sir.

445
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,300
Uh...

446
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:50,275
You see.
It starts here on page one.

447
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:52,367
The Muppet Movie. huh?

448
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:54,639
Hm. Let's see.

449
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:59,150
"Exterior. Swamp. Day.
In a long helicopter shot,

450
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:03,177
we discover Kermit the Frog.
playin' his banjo and singin'."

451
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,315
"A Hollywood agent
starts the frog travelin' west."

452
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,156
"Doc Hopper comes on strong
and they get to this church."

453
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:11,696
"Interior. Church. Day."

454
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:16,497
"Fozzie:
'They don't look like Presbyterians to me-.'"

455
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:19,628
"Kermit and Fozzie
come walkin' down the aisle

456
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:25,301
to the thunderously loud music
of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem."

457
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,834
- Which am us.
- For sure. for sure.

458
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:32,405
This is a narrative
of very heavy-duty proportions

459
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,178
Yeah. Cosmic. man.

460
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,211
We gotta keep his little froggy self
away from this Hopper dude.

461
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,450
Too true. too true.

462
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:44,586
It is indeed a problem
for us to probosculate upon.

463
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:50,565
But it seems to me that the frog
and the bear are temporarily out of service.

464
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,626
Oh. wow. like.
what can we do to help them?

465
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,605
- Well. if this were the movies...
- Which it is.

466
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,766
We'd think of a clever plot device

467
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,778
Like disguising their car
so they won't be recognized.

468
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,609
Right. Two. three. four.

469
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,240
(I "Can You Picture That?)

470
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,375
Oh. yeah!

471
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,253
Whoo!

472
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,256

00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:35,466
I Can you picture that?

482
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:39,336
Oh. yeah.

483
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,681
Hey. Floyd.
Take a verse.

484
00:30:44,574 --> 00:30:46,986

00:30:49,112 --> 00:30:51,490

00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:33,138
Oh? You call that a miss?

559
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:38,339
(Gonzo) Well. I'm getting in your car.

Why are you hopping up and down?

563
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,144
Because I'm hopping mad.

564
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,210
Guy's got a sense of humor.

565
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:52,690

00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:08,766
You don't go to Bombay
to become a movie star.

572
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:11,309
You go where we-'re going - Hollywood.

573
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:15,074
Sure. if you wanna do it the easy way.

574
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:18,947

589
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,446

I To sing its worth

671
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:19,360

I And could they take it back?

678
00:41:38,237 --> 00:41:41,878
I Oh. no. they wouldn't dare

679
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:44,979
I Why should they take it back

680
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,651
I When there-'s enough

681
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:52,059
I To share with all the world

682
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:56,964
I And fill the heavens above

695
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:55,616
(Wedding bells)

696
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:05,564
Oh. oh.

697
00:43:05,621 --> 00:43:07,862
Thanks. Excuse me.

698
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:10,131
- Oh. yes. Of course.

699
00:43:10,193 --> 00:43:13,504
Listen. congratulations
on winning the beauty contest.

700
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:18,706
Thank you. Of course. normally.
I don't do anything so trivial.

701
00:43:18,768 --> 00:43:21,577
- I am an actress-model.
- Oh. is that right?

702
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:24,742
Well... I...
I'm gonna be a performer too.

703
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:25,910
Oh.

704
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:28,784
Hey. Kermit.
Who's the cute-lookin' pig?

705
00:43:28,844 --> 00:43:30,915
I beg your pardon.

706
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:33,459
If you were a chicken.
you'd be impeccable.

707
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:34,425
Gonzo.

708
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:36,554
Hey. I thought we were
gonna go get some ice cream.

709
00:43:36,618 --> 00:43:40,088
Oh. well. in a minute.
I'll join you.

710
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:44,471
Um...

711
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:46,233
Well...

712
00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:50,673
What are you doing in town.
short. green and handsome?

713
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:54,144
Well...
We-'re headed west.

714
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,306
- Really?
- Yeah. but...

715
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,748
You know. I really should
join my friends for ice cream.

716
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:00,046
Oh.

717
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:02,348
You... you wanna come along?

718
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,686
Me? You... you mean it? Oh.

719
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:07,089
I'll... I'll be right back. Oh. Oh.

720
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:09,321
Don't move.

721
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:11,485
Hm.

722
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:13,725
Hello. I'd like an ice cream.

723
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:17,701
What do you want? Chocolate, vanilla
coffee, peach fudge, rum, banana?

724
00:44:17,757 --> 00:44:19,168
- Honey.
- Honey?

725
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:22,798
- I beg your pardon. I hardly know you.
- Ah.

726
00:44:22,862 --> 00:44:26,469
But seriously.
I'd like a honey ice cream cone for me.

727
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:29,514
And a dragonfly ripple
for my friend. the frog.

728
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:33,244
OK. One honey cone for the bear.

729
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:35,616
And one dragonfly ripple for the frog.

730
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:36,676
Ugh!

731
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:39,451
- Don't get 'em mixed up.
- Gotcha.

732
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:45,417
(clucking)

733
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:49,256
(Camilla clucks)

734
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:53,269
Oh. all right. all right. Camilla. I'll get you
a balloon. but you have to pick the color.

735
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,375
Red or green?

736
00:44:56,203 --> 00:45:00,015
- Can I give you a word of advice?
- (Gonzo) What?

737
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,576
Why not take both?

738
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:07,581
What a wild idea.

739
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:10,389
Yeah. A beautiful chicken like that
deserves two balloons.

740
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,861
- You're right.
- I have guys come in all the time.

741
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,898
Sometimes they get a bunch of balloons
for their girls.

742
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:18,731
- They go gaga for it.
- Gaga? I'll take the whole bunch.

743
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,135
Gaga. Gaga. Aw.

744
00:45:27,032 --> 00:45:29,308
Gonzo?

745
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:30,938
Wonder...

746
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,939
where they went? Fozzie?

747
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:35,917
(Fozzie) Kermit. Kermit.

748
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:39,047
Hey. Kermit.
Hey. Where-'s your pig friend?

749
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,114
Well. I'm not really sure. She said
she was coming for ice cream. but...

750
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,923
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.
Here I am. Here I am.

751
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:49,056
- I'm packed. I'm packed.
- Yeah. so I see.

752
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,031
What for?

753
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:53,501
You said I could come with you.

754
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:56,368
Yeah. but...
To buy ice cream. not to Hollywood.

755
00:45:56,428 --> 00:46:00,035
- We-'re going to Hollywood?
- No. I mean. listen...

756
00:46:00,098 --> 00:46:03,545
When I... when I said...
I mean. well. when you heard...

757
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:06,172
- Oh. brother.
- (Gonzo) Oh! Oh!

758
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:08,216
(clucking)

759
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:09,842
What? Gonzo?

760
00:46:09,907 --> 00:46:12,251
(Gonzo screams)

761
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,851
- (Kermit) Gonzo! What are you doing?
- (Piggy) What?

762
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:18,086
About seven knots.

763
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,788
- We-'II follow you. To the car.
- Yes. sir.

764
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:26,290
(Kermit) Gonzo. we-'re coming!

765
00:46:26,457 --> 00:46:28,801
- (Kermit) Step on it, Fozzie!
- Yes, sir.

766
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:32,773
- (Piggy) Oh. Kermit. You're a born leader.
- (Kermit) Now. where is he?

767
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:37,975
Isn't this great?
Here I am floating in space.

768
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:41,015
This is the place to be.

769
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,947
Whoopee!

770
00:46:43,005 --> 00:46:44,541
- Fozzie.
- Yes.

771
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:46,086
- Bear left.
- What?

772
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:47,746
- Bear left.
- Right. Frog.

773
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,017
- What? That's cute.
- Never mind.

774
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,088
This is...
Look at our little car down there.

775
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,596
Oh. this is like flying.

776
00:46:57,587 --> 00:46:59,794
Hey. this is flying.

777
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:02,666
I'm flying! Whoopee!

778
00:47:02,725 --> 00:47:05,898
Doc. isn't that a frog up there?

779
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:08,339
No. that's a frog down here.

780
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:11,103
(Kermit) He-'s caught in a crosswind.
Fozzie. We-'re gonna lose him.

781
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,203
(Fozzie) Oh. no.

782
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:19,176
- Oh! What are you doin'. Doc?
- I'm goin' after the tires.

783
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,983
(Kermit) We-'re OK now.
The wind's shifted.

784
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:24,353
- Wait a minute. Stay with him. Fozzie.
- (Fozzie) Yeah.

785
00:47:24,412 --> 00:47:28,224
- (Kermit) He's right above us
- (Gonzo) Woo hoo!

786
00:47:28,283 --> 00:47:30,160
- He-'s OK.
- Yeah. Hi. Gonzo.

787
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:31,959
- Fozzie. come back in here.
- What?

788
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,465
- Come back in here.
- Yes. sir.

789
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:35,592
Oh!

790
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:37,397
(Kermit) Why don't you stay on the road?

791
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,131
Kermit!

792
00:47:39,994 --> 00:47:43,203
(Kermit) Look out for the billboard.

793
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,501
(MEX) No!

794
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:46,670
(gunshot)

795
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,513
- Take off. Fozzie.
- Yes. sir.

796
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:54,382
Come back. you!

797
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:57,854
No frog's gonna make a monkey out of me!

798
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,883
I'm back.

799
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,792
I don't understand any of this.

800
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:07,687
(screaming)

801
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:13,863
I just gotta catch up with those guys.

802
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:20,635
(Piggy) Kermit. you were so courageous.
So magnificent.

803
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:24,840
- Gee. I don't know what to say.
- Say the bear was magnificent.

804
00:48:24,904 --> 00:48:26,747
After all. I did the driving.

805
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:30,343
And I took a 100ft belly flop
onto a moving car.

806
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:36,451
Yes. but Kermit assumed
the awesome responsibility of command.

807
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:38,688
- Gee.
- Oh. brother.

808
00:48:39,952 --> 00:48:41,829
Um...

809
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:46,165
Why don't we stop somewhere
for the night and have a quiet little dinner...

810
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:48,170
for two?

811
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:51,207
Terrific!
I'll eat with you. Miss Piggy.

812
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:54,142
Not you. buzzard beak.

813
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,201
Just mon capitaine

814
00:48:56,268 --> 00:48:58,269
and moi.

815
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:03,107
Well... That...
That might be nice.

816
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,048
(romantic music)

817
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,497
Oh, wow.

818
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:20,168
Good evening. Miss Piggy.

819
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:22,670
You look lovely tonight.

820
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,899
Thank you.

821
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,141
I'm so sorry if I kept you waiting.

822
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,312
Oh. it...
it was worth it.

823
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,549
How charming of vous.

824
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:54,193
I... I took the liberty
of ordering us some wine.

825
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:56,625
Mm.

826
00:49:56,692 --> 00:49:58,330
Oh. waiter.

827
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:01,068
Yes?

828
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,667
May I help you?

829
00:50:03,732 --> 00:50:06,178
The... the wine. please.

830
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:08,170
Mm.

831
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:12,413
You mad. impetuous thing.
It's champagne.

832
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:15,284
Not exactly.
Sparkling muscatel.

833
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:18,450
One of the finest wines of Idaho.

834
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:21,282
Well. you may serve us now. please.

835
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:24,228
Oh. May I ?

836
00:50:25,153 --> 00:50:28,498
- Look how he does that.
- Yep.

837
00:50:28,556 --> 00:50:31,264
- Very suave.
- Mm.

838
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:43,176
Don't you want to smell the bottle cap?

839
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:44,739
Oh.

840
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:49,149
- Mm-hm. Smells good.
- Mm. Yes.

841
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:53,055
- Would you like to taste it first?
- Well...

842
00:50:53,113 --> 00:50:55,787
I think he-'s supposed to.

843
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:59,826
Would you taste it for us. please?

844
00:51:06,393 --> 00:51:08,395
Ugh!

845
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:15,569
- Excellent choice.
- Should be for 95 cents.

846
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:17,136
Hmm.

847
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:23,212
- And may we have straws, please?
- Yes.

848
00:51:23,275 --> 00:51:25,448
I expected that.

849
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,553
Thank you.
That'll be all for now.

850
00:51:30,616 --> 00:51:33,222
Oh. thank you.

851
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:36,289
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

852
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:41,135
- Here-'s to you. Miss Piggy.
- Oh.

853
00:51:41,193 --> 00:51:43,366
Drink up.

854
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:01,614
Oh.

855
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,852
Makes me giggly-

856
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:07,089
The wine?

857
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:09,929
Everything.

858
00:52:13,323 --> 00:52:16,167
It's a beautiful evening. isn't it?

859
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:19,038
Mm-hm.

860
00:52:20,664 --> 00:52:23,008
The moon is just lovely.

861
00:52:24,368 --> 00:52:26,245
Mm-hm.

862
00:52:27,871 --> 00:52:30,010
You know. Miss Piggy.

863
00:52:30,073 --> 00:52:33,077
The moon doesn't look like you

864
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:36,713
(whimpers)

865
00:52:40,883 --> 00:52:42,920
- (Waiter) Miss Piggy.
- Hm?

866
00:52:42,985 --> 00:52:44,987
Miss Piggy.

867
00:52:45,054 --> 00:52:47,898
- Are you Miss Piggy?
- Yes.

868
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:50,860
- Telephone.
- Oh.

869
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:54,074
Uh... Oh...

870
00:52:54,130 --> 00:53:00,012
Kermie. I did place
one phone call to my agent.

871
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:03,778
It'll only be an eensy-teensy moment.

872
00:53:07,877 --> 00:53:09,878
What the hey?

873
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:14,520
(piano music)

874
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:24,431
(slow blues)

875
00:53:30,298 --> 00:53:33,074
Evenin'.
Rowlf. Rowlf the Dog.

876
00:53:33,134 --> 00:53:35,410
Sit yourself down.

877
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,177
- Kermit. Kermit the Frog.
- Pleased to meet you.

878
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,083
I'm no Heifetz.
but I get by.

879
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:47,681
That was...
that was very nice

880
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,728
- (sniffs)
- Oh.

881
00:53:49,783 --> 00:53:52,263
A broken heart. right?

882
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,799
- Does it show?
- Listen.

883
00:53:54,855 --> 00:53:58,166
When you've been ticklin' the ivories
as long as I have.

884
00:53:58,225 --> 00:54:01,206
You've seen a broken heart
for every drop of rain.

885
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:04,834
A shattered dream
for every fallen star.

886
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:08,875
Exactly.
She just walked out on me.

887
00:54:08,935 --> 00:54:12,576
Yeah? Typical.
That's why I live alone.

888
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:15,142
- You do. huh?
- You bet.

889
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,052
I finish work.
I go home. read a book.

890
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:22,287
Have a couple of beers.
take myself for a walk and go to bed.

891
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:27,093
- Nice and simple.
- Stay away from women - that's my motto.

892
00:54:27,153 --> 00:54:31,033
- But I can't.
- Neither can I. That's my trouble.

893
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,966
(I "I Hope That
Something Better Comes Along')

894
00:54:33,025 --> 00:54:35,027
I You can't live with 'em

895
00:54:35,093 --> 00:54:37,664
I You can't live without 'em

896
00:54:37,729 --> 00:54:41,905
I There-'s some-thin'
irresistible-ish about 'em

897
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:45,471
I We grin and bear it
'cause the nights are long

898
00:54:45,537 --> 00:54:49,542
I I hope that
some-thin' better comes along

899
00:54:49,608 --> 00:54:51,645
I see what you mean.

900
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,712
I it's no good complainin'

901
00:54:53,779 --> 00:54:56,225
I And pointless to holler

902
00:54:56,281 --> 00:55:00,252
I If she-'s a beauty.
she-'II get under your collar

903
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,822
I She made a monkey
out of old King Kong

904
00:55:03,888 --> 00:55:07,927
I I hope that
some-thin' better comes along

905
00:55:09,293 --> 00:55:11,773
J' Still, it's fun when they're fetchin'

906
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:17,575
I And agree to see an etching
that you keep at your lily pad

907
00:55:17,635 --> 00:55:21,310
I There is no solution.
It's part of evolution

908
00:55:21,372 --> 00:55:25,980
I The pitter-patter of souls.
the little feet of tadpoles

909
00:55:26,043 --> 00:55:28,523
Rowlf. tadpoles don't have feet.

910
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:31,855
Oh. Sorry about that.
Two. three. four.

911
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:36,193
I There-'s no limitation
to mixin' and matchin'

912
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:40,223
I Some get an itchin'
for a critter they've been scratchin'

913
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:43,737
I A skunk was badge-red.
the results were strong

914
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:45,500
I I hope that some-thin' better

915
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:47,731
I I hope that some-thin' better

916
00:55:47,797 --> 00:55:51,870
I I hope that
some-thin' better comes along

917
00:56:02,378 --> 00:56:04,858
(Waiter) Phone call for Kermit the Frog.

918
00:56:04,913 --> 00:56:07,223
- Are you Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.

919
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:09,421
Phone.

920
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:13,899
Huh.

921
00:56:13,956 --> 00:56:19,838
It's not often you see a guy that green
have the blues that bad.

922
00:56:22,097 --> 00:56:24,872
- Hello.
- Kermie. please...

923
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:29,510
- Piggy. is that you?
- (Hopper) Yes. that's her.

924
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:33,780
And this is Doc Hopper.
You listen, Frog. And listen good.

925
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:37,347
Step outside the motel right now.

926
00:56:37,412 --> 00:56:39,858
My guys will meet you there.

927
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:42,417
Well... what if I don't?

928
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,458
Then your girlfriend
will be ham-hooked by breakfast.

929
00:56:47,522 --> 00:56:49,695
Oh. Kermie.
Don't. don't. don't. don't. Ker...

930
00:56:49,757 --> 00:56:51,361
(laughs)

931
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:06,209
Uh. uh...

932
00:57:06,273 --> 00:57:08,446
Are you the guys
I'm supposed to meet?

933
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:15,889
That's good. Glen.
That's good. That's nice and tight.

934
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,392
- The professor's here. Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.

935
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:25,499
Kermie. I'm not a bit worried.

936
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:29,938
I know you're planning
something bold and clever.

937
00:57:29,995 --> 00:57:33,101
Well. I got us this far. didn't I?

938
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:37,247
(laughs)

939
00:57:37,303 --> 00:57:39,749
- How are you?
- Ah. Professor Krassman.

940
00:57:39,805 --> 00:57:44,811
It's good to see you. Doc. you little
rustic devil. you. Where-'s my victim?

941
00:57:44,877 --> 00:57:46,914
I mean. patient?

942
00:57:46,979 --> 00:57:52,018
Step this way. Professor.
Let me introduce you to your patient.

943
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:56,725
Professor Krassman is the world's leadin'
authority on mind control in frogs.

944
00:57:56,788 --> 00:58:01,430
It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic. don't you?

945
00:58:01,493 --> 00:58:04,440
Tell us what you're gonna do
to our little Kermit.

946
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:09,036
Well. we're going to perform
an electronic cerebrectomy.

947
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,477
- Hm?
- A what?

948
00:58:10,535 --> 00:58:13,209
Electronic cerebrectomy.

949
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:17,085
What's that?

950
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:20,611
It's something so sensational
that you'll have to hold on to your hat.

951
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:21,678
Yes?

952
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:25,352
When a German scientist says "hold on to
your hat." it's not casual conversation.

953
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:27,952
Hold on to your hat!
Hat! Hold! Good.

954
00:58:28,018 --> 00:58:31,431
Now, what we're going to do is bring out
a machine that's going to wow you.

955
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:34,230
Bertram! Bertram. you...
Bring out the machine!

956
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:36,601
Wait till you see this.
You think we-'re sleeping in DÃ¼sseldorf?

957
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,903
You think we-'re taking a nap in Cologne?
No. we-'re working at night.

958
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:44,503
- Each night a new dial. a new knob...
- Electronic ce...

959
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:49,141
Cerebrectomy. cerebrectomy.
Electronic cerebrectomy.

960
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:52,448
- What does it do?
- What does it do? What does it do?

961
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:56,217
It turns the brains into guacamole.

962
00:58:58,347 --> 00:59:00,918
First of all.
I'll pull out of this. OK?

963
00:59:00,983 --> 00:59:02,985
Wonderful.

964
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:07,131
Second?

965
00:59:09,725 --> 00:59:11,295
Halt!

966
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,270
Argh!

967
00:59:12,328 --> 00:59:14,705
I detest the surfeit of provincial laughter.

968
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:18,734
Now. we take your friend.
the little f-0-r-g.

969
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,371
Put him in the chair.
clamp on the terminals.

970
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:23,541
Drop the electronic yarmulke.

971
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:26,552
And throw.
what we call in German. the switch.

972
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:28,053
Ha ha ha.

973
00:59:29,644 --> 00:59:35,117
Yes. you little green devil. Soon it'll be
a hot time for the old skull tonight.

974
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:37,528
Thank you. Herr Machine.

975
00:59:37,586 --> 00:59:40,999
Now, the frog will do your bidding. He will
do your every whim, your every wish.

976
00:59:41,056 --> 00:59:43,092
He will do your television commercial. yes.

977
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:47,537
He will sell your frogs legs.

978
00:59:47,595 --> 00:59:49,734
- Zaparoonie.
- Head full of jelly.

979
00:59:49,797 --> 00:59:53,939
- A noggin full of library paste.
- Let's fry them brains!

980
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:55,844
Professor Krassman.
you've got a fun job.

981
00:59:55,903 --> 01:00:01,012
I love it. I love it. If I can inflict a little pain
during the afternoon. I sleep good at night.

982
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:03,385
- Well. we-'II let you get on with it. then.
- My pleasure.

983
01:00:03,444 --> 01:00:05,117
Max.

984
01:00:06,947 --> 01:00:10,052
I'll be back later
to pick up what's left of the frog.

985
01:00:10,116 --> 01:00:14,292
Whats left of the frog?
You can have everything. excuse the brain.

986
01:00:14,354 --> 01:00:17,267
All right. Bring over the frog.

987
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:19,132
Oh. Kermie.

988
01:00:19,192 --> 01:00:24,699
Whatever happens next, I wouldn't give up
this evening together for anything.

989
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:27,643
- Would you?
- Make me an offer.

990
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:32,483
Oh. Kermie.

991
01:00:32,538 --> 01:00:34,040
- Hey.
- OK.

992
01:00:34,107 --> 01:00:35,882
I got him. I got him.

993
01:00:35,942 --> 01:00:38,353
Good. good. good. good. good.

994
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:42,290
And why don't we
take a little seat. Kermit?

995
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,258
Hands down.

996
01:00:44,316 --> 01:00:46,489
- Get the feet into place.
- (Whimpers)

997
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:51,728
Oh. will you stop whimpering?
Go out like a frog. not a little toad.

998
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:55,294
OK. Herr Machine.
This is big time here.

999
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,739
Ready to go to work?
Hand clamps!

1000
01:00:58,797 --> 01:01:00,640
Foot clamps!

1001
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:02,876
(laughs evilly)

1002
01:01:02,934 --> 01:01:05,607
You can struggle all you want now, Frog

1003
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,276
it'll do you very little good.

1004
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:14,716
All right. And now it's time
to drop the electronic beanie.

1005
01:01:15,846 --> 01:01:19,521
Soon. there'll be enough voltage
coursing through your little frog brain

1006
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:22,325
to light up Cincinnati.

1007
01:01:22,386 --> 01:01:25,993
Oh, please, please.
Not my frog. Please!

1008
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:30,199
- Say goodbye to the frog. pig.
- Why should I?

1009
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:35,334
Because in ten seconds.
he won't know you from kosher bacon.

1010
01:01:35,398 --> 01:01:37,742
That does it!

1011
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:41,576
Hiiiiii-yah!

1012
01:01:43,406 --> 01:01:44,885
Hi! Hi!

1013
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:46,215
Hii-yah!

1014
01:01:46,443 --> 01:01:48,548
Hii-yah!

1015
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:51,022
Hii-yah!

1016
01:01:52,215 --> 01:01:53,853
Hii-yah!

1017
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:55,757
Hii-yah!

1018
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:06,198
What the heck's goin' on here?
A pig that goes bananas?

1019
01:02:06,261 --> 01:02:08,400
What is this? A luau?

1020
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:11,843
- (man) Where'd she go?
- (Piggy) Oh. boys.

1021
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,244
- There she is.
- Get her!

1022
01:02:15,537 --> 01:02:18,518
I must reach the switch.
I must...

1023
01:02:18,574 --> 01:02:20,554
- Switch. I must reach...
- Oh. no.

1024
01:02:20,609 --> 01:02:22,611
Hii-yah!

1025
01:02:25,714 --> 01:02:27,716
Hiiiiii-yah!

1026
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:30,318
- Now. Kermie.
- Oh. thank you.

1027
01:02:32,387 --> 01:02:34,799
Argh!

1028
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:38,269
Ribbit. ribbit. ribbit.

1029
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:43,598
Well...

1030
01:02:43,664 --> 01:02:45,666
Shall we go now. Kermie?

1031
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:47,872
(phone rings)

1032
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,747
Well...

1033
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:53,547
Just a second.

1034
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:56,043
Hello.

1035
01:02:57,944 --> 01:03:01,756
- Piggy. it's your agent.
- Ooh.

1036
01:03:01,815 --> 01:03:03,590
Thank you.

1037
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,493
(clears throat)

1038
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:07,554
(low voice) Yeah. Morty.
what have you got?

1039
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,294
Commercial?

1040
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,629
How much? Mm-hm.

1041
01:03:12,692 --> 01:03:14,433
When?

1042
01:03:14,494 --> 01:03:16,496
Take it.

1043
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:21,368
(normal voice) Um...

1044
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:27,844
Goodbye.

1045
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:30,080
(sad music)

1046
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,252
(music winds down)

1047
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:47,330
- (Fozzie) What's going on?
- Hey. what happened?

1048
01:03:47,393 --> 01:03:49,839
(speaks in mock Swedish)

1049
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,608
Irritated!

1050
01:03:53,832 --> 01:03:56,073
Irritated!

1051
01:03:56,134 --> 01:03:58,614
Don't worry. Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.

1052
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:02,516
Yeah. yeah.
Just be cool and eat another seat cushion.

1053
01:04:02,574 --> 01:04:04,576
Seat cushion!

1054
01:04:07,912 --> 01:04:09,914
Well. how do you like the film?

1055
01:04:09,981 --> 01:04:14,088
I've seen detergents
that leave a better film than this.

1056
01:04:14,152 --> 01:04:18,362
Well. I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm having a great time.

1057
01:04:18,423 --> 01:04:20,425
Oh. good.

1058
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:23,496
Der flim is okey-dokey.

1059
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,030
- Good. Roll film.
- Flim is rolling.

1060
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,669
- (Gonzo) Quiet.
- (Fozzie) Quiet.

1061
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:31,804
(Fozzie) Quiet. Gonzo.

1062
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:35,647
- This is the patriotic part.
- Should we stand up?

1063
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,014
No.

1064
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:38,348
(T "America the Beautiful')

1065
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:42,720
(Fozzie) I O beautiful
for spacious skies

1066
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:46,886
I For amber waves of grain

1067
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:51,227
I For purple mountain majesties

1068
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:55,702
I Above the fruited plains

1069
01:04:55,758 --> 01:05:00,070
I America. America

1070
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:04,475
I God shed his grace on thee

1071
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:08,983
J' And crown thy good
with brotherhood

1072
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:15,045
I From sea to shining sea

1073
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:23,354
Patriotism swells
in the heart of the American bear.

1074
01:05:36,665 --> 01:05:39,202
Hold it. boys.
Hold it!

1075
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,042
Hold your fire!

1076
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,881
Boys, no reflection
on the job you've been doin

1077
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,649
but I decided to bring in a specialist.

1078
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:03,224
Now. boys.
this is Snake Walker.

1079
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:05,964
Tell 'em what you do. Snake.

1080
01:06:07,261 --> 01:06:09,434
Kill frogs.

1081
01:06:16,269 --> 01:06:19,478
- (Fozzie) How long is it to Hollywood?
- (Kermit) We gotta be there by tomorrow.

1082
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:22,713
(Gonzo) Hey. Kermit. Are you gonna
get an agent like that pig had?

1083
01:06:22,775 --> 01:06:26,382
(Fozzie) Gonzo.
you know he-'s touchy about that.

1084
01:06:26,446 --> 01:06:29,916
- (Rowlf) Hey. who's that?
- (Kermit) I don't believe that.

1085
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:31,223
- (Kermit) Piggy?
- (Fozzie) Kermit.

1086
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:33,423
Kermit.

1087
01:06:33,486 --> 01:06:35,864
- That's Piggy.
- Yeah. I know.

1088
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:39,260
(Rowlf) Hey. do you think
we should help her with her bag?

1089
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:41,134
- (all) No.
- Kermie.

1090
01:06:41,194 --> 01:06:43,366
<i>(Piggy grunts)</i>

1091
01:06:44,596 --> 01:06:48,305
Kermie. what an unbelievable coincidence.

1092
01:06:48,367 --> 01:06:50,369
(Fozzie) Hm.

1093
01:06:52,037 --> 01:06:54,108
Hello again. it's me.

1094
01:06:54,172 --> 01:06:57,984
Would you hold my vanity case?
Hii-yah!

1095
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:02,049
- Well.
- Well. what?

1096
01:07:02,114 --> 01:07:05,960
So much has happened to me
since I saw you last.

1097
01:07:06,018 --> 01:07:09,295
- Yeah. sure.
- Frankly. Miss Piggy. I don't give a hoot.

1098
01:07:09,354 --> 01:07:13,802
My name is Rowlf the Dog and I was
playing the piano... Oh. never mind.

1099
01:07:15,893 --> 01:07:18,305
- Kermie.
- Yeah?

1100
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,942
- I missed you.
- Yeah.

1101
01:07:23,934 --> 01:07:27,177
Don't I get one kissy-kissy?

1102
01:07:27,238 --> 01:07:30,447
Uh... No. I...
I don't think so. Miss Piggy.

1103
01:07:30,508 --> 01:07:33,751
- Oh. just one little hug.
- (Fozzie) Hm.

1104
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,282
- Oh. Piggy.
- Kermie.

1105
01:07:39,983 --> 01:07:42,589
(Hopper on radio) You've been listenin'
to music to hug frogs by.

1106
01:07:42,652 --> 01:07:47,260
And this is Doc Hopper sayin' that if Kermit
the Frog don't stop right now and call me.

1107
01:07:47,323 --> 01:07:51,362
And agree to be my national spokesman.
he will soon be a frog burger.

1108
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:54,770
Kermie. Ah!

1109
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:57,175
We-'II be OK.

1110
01:07:57,233 --> 01:07:59,440
Mon capitaine.

1111
01:07:59,502 --> 01:08:01,504
(engine splutters)

1112
01:08:03,707 --> 01:08:06,550
- (Fozzie) Oh. boy. Yeah. what?
- (Kermit) Fozzie?

1113
01:08:06,608 --> 01:08:09,248
(Fozzie) No problem.
It's OK. it's OK.

1114
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:11,655
No problem.
OK. all right.

1115
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:14,252
- Listen...
- (Kermit) Oh. boy.

1116
01:08:14,316 --> 01:08:17,354
(Fozzie) Oh. we-'re in trouble.

1117
01:08:17,419 --> 01:08:20,059
I wish I still had my Studebaker

1118
01:08:20,122 --> 01:08:22,762
(Rowlf) Probably somethin' broken
about the engine. I think.

1119
01:08:22,825 --> 01:08:28,366
(Gonzo) Hey. don't worry.
Someone-'s bound to come along.

1120
01:08:45,513 --> 01:08:49,051
Well. I guess we blew it.
huh. Gonzo?

1121
01:08:49,117 --> 01:08:50,960
Yeah.

1122
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,727
But the sky sure is beautiful out here.

1123
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,963
Look at that.

1124
01:08:59,861 --> 01:09:01,534
We...

1125
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:06,340
We-'re gonna miss
the auditions tomorrow. right?

1126
01:09:08,335 --> 01:09:10,337
Kermit?

1127
01:09:15,275 --> 01:09:20,020
(Gonzo) Boy. you could
get lost in a sky like that.

1128
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:24,028
I wish I had those balloons again.

1129
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:27,354
So much for Hollywood.

1130
01:09:28,355 --> 01:09:32,234
Listen, gang.
I never promised we'd make it

1131
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,794
I never promised anything.

1132
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:38,672
(I "I'm Going To
Go Back There Someday')

1133
01:09:43,335 --> 01:09:46,578
I This looks familiar

1134
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:50,816
I Vaguely familiar

1135
01:09:51,777 --> 01:09:55,315
I Almost unreal. yet

1136
01:09:55,381 --> 01:09:59,692
I it's too soon to feel yet

1137
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:03,062
I Close to my soul

1138
01:10:03,121 --> 01:10:06,898
I And yet so far away

1139
01:10:07,892 --> 01:10:13,240
I I'm going to go back there someday

1140
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:20,877
I Sun rises. night falls

1141
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:25,149
I Sometimes the sky calls

1142
01:10:26,143 --> 01:10:28,783
I Is that a song there?

1143
01:10:28,846 --> 01:10:32,157
I And do I belong there?

1144
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:36,829
I I've never been there

1145
01:10:36,887 --> 01:10:39,959
I But I know the way

1146
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:46,704
I I'm going to go back there someday

1147
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,772
I Come and go with me

1148
01:10:52,836 --> 01:10:56,715
I it's more fun to share

1149
01:10:56,772 --> 01:11:00,618
I We-'II both be completely

1150
01:11:00,676 --> 01:11:04,488
I At home in midair

1151
01:11:04,547 --> 01:11:08,359
I We're flyin', not walking

1152
01:11:08,417 --> 01:11:11,887
I On featherless wings

1153
01:11:11,954 --> 01:11:15,868
I We can hold on to love

1154
01:11:15,925 --> 01:11:19,930
I Like invisible strings

1155
01:11:24,766 --> 01:11:29,010
I There-'s not a word yet

1156
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:33,485
I For old friends who've just met

1157
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:37,614
I Part heaven. part space

1158
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:42,150
I Or have I found my place?

1159
01:11:42,217 --> 01:11:46,256
I You can just visit

1160
01:11:46,321 --> 01:11:50,735
I But I plan to stay

1161
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:55,069
I I'm going to go back there

1162
01:11:55,129 --> 01:11:57,973
I Someday

1163
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:05,581
I I'm going to go back there

1164
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:08,483
I Someday

1165
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:46,314
I didn't promise anybody anything.

1166
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,991
What do I know about Hollywood anyway?

1167
01:12:50,048 --> 01:12:53,996
Just the dreams I got from sitting
through too many double features.

1168
01:12:54,052 --> 01:12:56,965
(Kermit's voice) So, why did you leave
the swamp in the first place?

1169
01:12:57,022 --> 01:13:00,299
'Cause some agent fella
said I had talent.

1170
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:02,236
He probably says that to everybody.

1171
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,831
On the other hand,
if you hadn't left the swamp,

1172
01:13:04,896 --> 01:13:07,536
you'd be feeling
pretty miserable anyhow.

1173
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:11,945
Yeah. but then it would
just be me feeling miserable.

1174
01:13:12,004 --> 01:13:14,347
Now I got a lady pig and a bear.

1175
01:13:14,405 --> 01:13:18,319
And a chicken. a dog.
a thing - whatever Gonzo is.

1176
01:13:18,376 --> 01:13:20,014
He-'s a little like a turkey.

1177
01:13:20,077 --> 01:13:23,524
Yeah. A little like a turkey.
but not much.

1178
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:27,586
No. I guess not. Anyhow. I brought 'em all
out here into the middle of nowhere.

1179
01:13:27,651 --> 01:13:29,858
It's all my fault.

1180
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,891
Still. whether you promised them
something or not.

1181
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:37,667
You gotta remember
they wanted to come.

1182
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:40,140
But that's because they believed in me.

1183
01:13:40,197 --> 01:13:42,767
No. they believed in the dream.

1184
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:46,041
- Well. so do I. but...
- You do?

1185
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:48,378
Yeah. Of course I do.

1186
01:13:48,438 --> 01:13:52,113
- Well. then?
- Well. then...

1187
01:13:52,175 --> 01:13:56,089
I guess I was wrong
when I said I never promised anyone.

1188
01:13:56,146 --> 01:13:58,023
I promised me.

1189
01:14:01,418 --> 01:14:03,420
(harmonica)

1190
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:07,964
(Electric Mayhem playing)

1191
01:14:08,024 --> 01:14:09,731
Hey. Now, wait a minute

1192
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:30,850
- Hey. what... What's happening?
- At the moment. we're what's happening.

1193
01:14:30,913 --> 01:14:33,723
Oh. great.
Wonderful. Yeah.

1194
01:14:33,782 --> 01:14:36,126
Zoot. hey. Zoot.

Animal. cool it back there.

1197
01:14:40,088 --> 01:14:42,068
Yeah.

1198
01:14:42,123 --> 01:14:44,694
All right. yeah.

1199
01:14:44,759 --> 01:14:48,104
Hey. listen. it's wonderful to see you guys.

1200
01:14:48,162 --> 01:14:51,439
Oh. easy.
We just read the screenplay you left us.

1201
01:14:51,499 --> 01:14:54,844
"Exterior. Desert. Night."
We knew right where you were.

1202
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:57,041
Like. can you get behind it?

1203
01:14:57,105 --> 01:14:59,483
Hey. listen. When do you dudes
have to be at that audition?

1204
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,611
Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

1205
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:05,089
Well. climb aboard the bus. We-'II have
breakfast at Hollywood and Vine.

1206
01:15:05,146 --> 01:15:07,625
(cheering)

1207
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:09,783
(I "Movin' Right Along')

1208
01:15:12,152 --> 01:15:14,723
(all) I Movin' right along

1209
01:15:14,788 --> 01:15:17,064
(Floyd) Oh. yeah.

1210
01:15:17,124 --> 01:15:18,831
(Dr. Teeth) Here we go.

1211
01:15:21,194 --> 01:15:23,538
I Movin' right along

1212
01:15:33,406 --> 01:15:37,285
Kermie. whisper
sweet nothings into my ear.

1213
01:15:38,077 --> 01:15:39,750
Motorcycle cop.

1214
01:15:39,812 --> 01:15:41,883
Motorcycle cop is a sweet nothing?

1215
01:15:41,947 --> 01:15:44,257
A motorcycle cop is chasing us.

1216
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:46,455
(siren)

1217
01:15:46,519 --> 01:15:51,992
- Hey. Dr. Teeth. you better pull over.
- Hey. easier done than said.

1218
01:15:52,758 --> 01:15:55,967
- (Floyd) Uh-oh.
- (Janice) Drag city.

1219
01:15:56,028 --> 01:15:58,770
What do we do now. huh?

1220
01:15:58,831 --> 01:16:01,243
Oh. dear.

1221
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:06,908
Hey. hey. The man with the badge.
The police. the cops. the fuzz. the p-I...

1222
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:10,544
- Don't you dare!
- I wouldn't think of it.

1223
01:16:15,413 --> 01:16:18,360
Did we do something wrong. Officer?

1224
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:19,656
(shocked gasps)

1225
01:16:19,717 --> 01:16:22,493
- Kermit. it's him.
- OK. gang. Let him explain.

1226
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:25,558
This whole disguise
is only so I could warn you

1227
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,694
Oh. yeah. Sure. sure.

1228
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:29,761
I never thought that Doc
was gonna hurt Kermit.

1229
01:16:29,827 --> 01:16:32,136
I only thought he was
gonna lean on him a little.

1230
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:36,941
But now he's got this frog killer
in from the Coast. and the man is deadly.

1231
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,002
(Fozzie) Oh. no. Kermit.
What are we gonna do?

1232
01:16:39,069 --> 01:16:41,845
- It's time to beat feet. green stuff.
- (Fozzie) Let's get out of here. Kermit.

1233
01:16:41,905 --> 01:16:44,579
I love it.
Chase music is one of our best riffs.

1234
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:47,144
Hold it. Dr. Teeth.
What's up ahead?

1235
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:50,522
- It's only an old ghost town.
- Fine.

1236
01:16:50,581 --> 01:16:53,755
Listen. you go back and tell Doc Hopper
I'll be waiting for him there.

1237
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:55,319
- What?
- What?

1238
01:16:55,385 --> 01:16:57,023
- Kermit. you'll get killed.
- Oh. please. no.

1239
01:16:57,087 --> 01:16:59,794
- (Fozzie) Kermit. you can't do that.
- Now. listen. guys.

1240
01:16:59,855 --> 01:17:02,927
Listen. I can't spend my whole life
running away from a bully.

1241
01:17:02,992 --> 01:17:05,438
It's time for a showdown.

1242
01:17:21,677 --> 01:17:24,180
Showdown! Showdown!

1243
01:17:34,956 --> 01:17:37,596
Uh... Hey. listen.
I'm gonna check things out.

1244
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:41,630
- Everybody stay in the bus. OK?
- Mm-hm.

1245
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:43,937
(roars)

1246
01:17:43,999 --> 01:17:49,415
Hey. Kermit. Can I take Animal for a walk?
He needs some exercise.

1247
01:17:49,471 --> 01:17:51,644
Yeah. yeah. sure.

1248
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:08,259
(I "Lady of Spain')

1249
01:18:08,322 --> 01:18:10,359
What is that?

1250
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:15,305
That's one of my latest inventions.
A musical rotating rain barrel.

1251
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,966
Oh. Oh. yeah.

1252
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:21,002
You see. I'm Dr. Bunsen Honeydew
and this is my assistant. Beaker.

1253
01:18:21,068 --> 01:18:22,069
(meeps)

1254
01:18:22,136 --> 01:18:25,776
We live here perfecting useful inventions.
Come in. come in.

1255
01:18:25,838 --> 01:18:27,840
(meeps)

1256
01:18:31,577 --> 01:18:34,251
(Dr. Bunsen) Welcome to our laboratory.

1257
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:39,829
Please don't touch anything.

1258
01:18:42,121 --> 01:18:43,122
Uh...

1259
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:46,864
- Is this the only street into town?
- Yes. yes.

1260
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,831
Hey. what are you dudes doin' in here?

1261
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:54,503
Oh. I'm so glad you asked.
We're perfecting our latest invention.

1262
01:18:54,566 --> 01:18:57,308
Insta-Grow pills.

1263
01:18:57,369 --> 01:19:02,341
Yeah. well. what in the name
of Fats Waller is that?

1264
01:19:02,407 --> 01:19:05,320
A four-foot prune.

1265
01:19:05,377 --> 01:19:07,414
Four-foot prune?

1266
01:19:07,946 --> 01:19:11,291
Yeah. man. well.
what else do these pills make big?

1267
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:15,526
Oh. they work on anything.
but the effect is sadly temporary.

1268
01:19:15,587 --> 01:19:18,624
- Sadly temporary
- (sighs)

1269
01:19:18,689 --> 01:19:20,032
(meeps)

1270
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,004
Oh. no!

1271
01:19:27,865 --> 01:19:30,209
(Scooter) Hey. Kermit.
Here comes Doc Hopper.

1272
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:33,373
I know.
I'll be ready for him.

1273
01:19:37,608 --> 01:19:40,919
OK. Frog.
Where are you?

1274
01:19:42,413 --> 01:19:44,859
(Kermit) I'm here.
I'll meet you in the middle of the street.

1275
01:19:44,915 --> 01:19:46,655
Oh. yeah?

1276
01:19:46,716 --> 01:19:48,423
(Kermit) Man to frog.

1277
01:19:48,485 --> 01:19:50,487
(chimes)

1278
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:11,712
- (Kermit) All right. Hopper.
- All right. Frog.

1279
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:14,949
One last chance.

1280
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:19,516
You gonna do my TV commercials
live or stuffed?

1281
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,824
Hopper. what's the matter with you?

1282
01:20:23,886 --> 01:20:26,366
You gotta be crazy.
chasin' me halfway across the country.

1283
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:29,699
Why are you doing this to me?

1284
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:33,399
'Cause all my life I wanted
to own a thousand frog leg restaurants

1285
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:37,239
- and you're the key. greenie.
- Yeah. well. I've got a dream too.

1286
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:40,803
But it's about singing and dancing
and making people happy.

1287
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:44,543
That's the kind of dream that gets better
the more people you share it with.

1288
01:20:44,605 --> 01:20:50,248
And. well. I've found a whole bunch of
friends who have the same dream.

1289
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:52,257
And...

1290
01:20:52,313 --> 01:20:55,294
And it kind of makes us like a family.

1291
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:57,158
Do you have anybody like that. Hopper?

1292
01:20:57,218 --> 01:21:01,064
I mean. once you get all those restaurants.
who are you gonna share it with?

1293
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,865
Who are your friends. Doc?
Those guys?

1294
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:07,361
Max.

1295
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,740
I got lots of friends.

1296
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,573
Max. for instance.

1297
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:21,351
- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man. Doc.

1298
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,718
And I think if you look in your heart.

1299
01:21:23,777 --> 01:21:28,692
You'll find you really wanna let me
and my friends go to follow our dreams.

1300
01:21:28,748 --> 01:21:32,457
But if that's not the kind of man you are.

1301
01:21:32,519 --> 01:21:35,762
Or what I'm saying
doesn't make any sense to you

1302
01:21:35,822 --> 01:21:39,633
well. then...
go ahead and kill me.

1303
01:21:52,905 --> 01:21:55,351
All right. boys.

1304
01:21:55,407 --> 01:21:57,080
Kill him.

1305
01:21:58,043 --> 01:22:00,489
No, wait, please

1306
01:22:06,851 --> 01:22:08,853
(crashing)

1307
01:22:26,437 --> 01:22:28,348
Animal!

1308
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:33,745
(roars)

1309
01:22:42,219 --> 01:22:45,598
Ha! Ha ha ha!

1310
01:22:46,023 --> 01:22:48,196
(Animal roars)

1311
01:22:51,695 --> 01:22:54,369
Everybody. on to Hollywood.

1312
01:23:06,075 --> 01:23:07,520
(Gonzo) Wow! Wicked!

1313
01:23:07,577 --> 01:23:12,117
(Dr. Teeth) Yeah.
next stop is Hollywood and Vine.

1314
01:23:17,787 --> 01:23:21,132
(Fozzie) Look at the ocean.
The ocean.

1315
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:29,975
Yes. Mr. Lord. I'll have
those deal numbers for you in a jiffy.

1316
01:23:30,032 --> 01:23:32,033
(phone rings)

1317
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:33,841
Mm-hm.

1318
01:23:33,902 --> 01:23:37,247
Oh. I'm sorry.
Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.

1319
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:40,309
He-'s packaging a blockbuster.

1320
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:44,748
- Ah. Kermie. look. it's wonderful.
- Yeah.

1321
01:23:44,813 --> 01:23:46,190
Like a dream come true.

1322
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:48,420
Well. don't count your tadpoles
until they're hatched.

1323
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:53,762
- I still have to audition. you know.
- Hey. there ain't nothin' to it. but to do it.

1324
01:23:53,822 --> 01:23:55,529
(buzzer)

1325
01:23:56,157 --> 01:23:58,467
And where do you think you're going?

1326
01:23:58,526 --> 01:24:02,166
Oh. hi. there.
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.

1327
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:05,335
You can't just walk in here
off the street. you know.

1328
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:10,906
- Especially not with all these animals.
- Animals? What's wrong with animals?

1329
01:24:10,971 --> 01:24:13,144
(Animal) Animal!

1330
01:24:13,207 --> 01:24:16,518
This is a movie studio. not a zoo!

1331
01:24:16,577 --> 01:24:18,420
Besides...

1332
01:24:20,547 --> 01:24:23,050
I'm allergic to animal hair.

1333
01:24:23,117 --> 01:24:26,723
- Now. get along. all of you.
- No. Wait a second. See here. miss.

1334
01:24:26,786 --> 01:24:30,199
I may not be one of your fancy
Hollywood frogs. but I deserve a chance.

1335
01:24:30,256 --> 01:24:33,203
And we-'re gonna stay right here in this
office until you let us in to see Lew Lord.

1336
01:24:33,259 --> 01:24:35,603
- Aren't we, gang, huh?
- Yes!

1337
01:24:35,662 --> 01:24:37,232
- (Floyd) What he says.
- (Gonzo) Yeah. come on.

1338
01:24:37,296 --> 01:24:40,834
(Kermit) We'll just sit right down and wait

1339
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,039
Hello. security. it's Miss Tracey.

1340
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:45,104
I wanna report a... (sneezes)

1341
01:24:45,171 --> 01:24:47,981
- (Gonzo) Shake. Shake. Shake. everyone.
- (Kermit) That's it.

1342
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,918
