1
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,084
<i>Saigon,</i>

2
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:25,823
<i>Shit,</i>

3
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:29,790
<i>I'm still only in Saigon,</i>

4
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:41,700
<i>Every time, I think I'm gonna
wake up back in the jungle,</i>

5
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,639
<i>When I was home after my
first tour, it was worse,</i>

6
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:01,822
<i>I'd wake up and there'd be nothing,</i>

7
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:14,268
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce,</i>

8
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,710
<i>When I was here, I wanted to be there,</i>

9
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:25,477
<i>When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle,</i>

10
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,784
<i>I'm here a week now,</i>

11
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:36,155
<i>Waiting for a mission,</i>

12
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:39,020
<i>Getting softer,</i>

13
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,268
<i>Every minute I stay in
this room, I get weaker,</i>

14
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,738
<i>And every minute Charlie squats
in the bush, he gets stronger,</i>

15
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:01,181
<i>Each time I looked around, the
walls moved in a little tighter,</i>

16
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,952
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants,</i>

17
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,917
<i>I wanted a mission,</i>

18
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,292
<i>and for my sins, they gave me one,</i>

19
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,863
<i>Brought it up to me like room service,</i>

20
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:56,065
Captain Willard, are you in there?

21
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,669
Yeah, I'm coming.

22
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,668
<i>It was a real choice mission,</i>

23
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,137
<i>And when it was over,</i>

24
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,808
<i>I'd never want another,</i>

25
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:15,546
What do you want?

26
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:18,848
- Are you all right, captain?
- What does it look like?

27
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,828
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

28
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,434
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

29
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,095
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?

30
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:40,974
We have orders to escort you to the airfield.

31
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:46,078
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

32
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:49,048
- What did I do?
- There's no charges, captain.

33
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:53,190
You have orders to report to
COMSEC Intelligence at Nha Trang.

34
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:55,926
Now, you see? All right?

35
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:59,119
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.

36
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:02,422
Come on, captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

37
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:06,195
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

38
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:09,997
Dave, come here and give me
a hand. We got a dead one.

39
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,540
Come on, captain. Let's take a shower.

40
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,541
- Don't be an asshole.
- Get ahold of him good.

41
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,306
We're gonna take a shower, captain. In we go.

42
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,676
Stand underneath this, captain.

43
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:33,622
<i>I was going to the worst place in the world</i>

44
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:36,130
<i>and I didn't even know it yet,</i>

45
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,592
<i>Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river</i>

46
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:42,932
<i>that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable,</i>

47
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,837
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz,</i>

48
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:51,047
<i>It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker</i>

49
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:53,717
<i>of Colonel Walter E, Kurtz's memory</i>

50
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:57,684
<i>any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident,</i>

51
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:02,984
<i>There is no way to tell his
story without telling my own,</i>

52
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:05,161
<i>And if his story is really a confession,</i>

53
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:06,489
Captain Willard reporting, sir.

54
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:07,665
<i>Then so is mine,</i>

55
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:11,029
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

56
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,931
Stand at ease.

57
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:14,862
General.

58
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,375
Do you want a cigarette?

59
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:21,043
No, thank you, sir.

60
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:25,080
Captain, have you ever
seen this gentleman before?

61
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:28,309
- No, sir.
- Met the general or myself?

62
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,919
No, sir. Not personally.

63
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,016
You've worked a lot on your
own, haven't you, captain?

64
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,522
Yes, sir, I have.

65
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,752
Your report specifies
intelligence, counterintelligence

66
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:39,259
with COMSEC I Corps.

67
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,762
I'm not presently disposed to
discuss those operations, sir.

68
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:54,809
Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?

69
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:57,181
No, sir.

70
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:59,748
Did you not assassinate a
government tax collector,

71
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,784
Quang TrÃ­ Province, June 18, 1968?

72
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,948
Captain?

73
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:14,093
Sir, I am unaware of any
such activity or operation.

74
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:19,032
Nor would I be disposed to
discuss such an operation

75
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:22,673
if it did in fact exist, sir.

76
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,779
I thought we'd have a bite
of lunch while we talk.

77
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,320
I hope you brought a good appetite, captain.

78
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,518
I noticed that you have a...

79
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,256
...bad hand there. Are you wounded?

80
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:47,363
I had a little fishing
accident on R and R, sir.

81
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,867
- Fishing on R and R.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:53,299
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

83
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,802
Yes, general. Very much so, sir.

84
00:11:56,174 --> 00:12:02,079
Well, let's see what we have here.
Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

85
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,116
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.

86
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:10,253
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

87
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,920
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp,

88
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:21,760
but if you'll eat it, you'll never have
to prove your courage in any other way.

89
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:26,228
Actually, why don't I just take a piece here.

90
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:31,036
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

91
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:34,309
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.

92
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:36,343
Oh, Jesus.

93
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,141
Operations officer, 5th Special Forces.

94
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,319
Luke, would you play that
tape for the captain, please?

95
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,489
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, captain.

96
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:50,890
<i>October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter, Victor, King,</i>

97
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:53,655
These were monitored out of Cambodia.

98
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,962
This has been verified
as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

99
00:12:57,168 --> 00:13:01,070
<i>I watched a snail</i>

100
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:03,602

105

106
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,392
<i>...of a straight razor...</i>

<i>What do you call it when the
assassins accuse the assassin?</i>

117
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,429
<i>They lie,</i>

118
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,197
<i>They lie, and we have to be merciful</i>

119
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,466

120
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:15,945
<i>Those nabobs,</i>

00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:19,073
<i>I hate them,</i>

122
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:22,011
<i>I do hate them,</i>

123
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:30,024
Walt Kurtz was one of the
most outstanding officers

124
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:32,526
this country's ever produced.

125
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,927
He was brilliant. He was
outstanding in every way.

126
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:42,034
And he was a good man
too. A humanitarian man.

127
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:45,267
A man of wit and humor.

128
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,208
He joined the Special Forces.

129
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:52,279
And after that...

130
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:57,745
...his ideas, methods...

131
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,615
...became...

132
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,791
...unsound.

133
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,396
Unsound.

134
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:19,369
Now he's crossed into Cambodia with this

135
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:25,345
Montagnard army of his that
worship the man like a god

136
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,509
and follow every order, however ridiculous.

137
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:34,814
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.

138
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:38,361
Colonel Kurtz was about to be

139
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,497
arrested for murder.

140
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:44,267
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

141
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:48,529
Kurtz had ordered the execution of
some Vietnamese intelligence agents,

142
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,004
men he believed were double agents.

143
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,572
So he took matters into his own hands.

144
00:15:57,515 --> 00:16:00,040
Well, you see, Willard,

145
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:03,145
in this war, things get...

146
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:06,379
...confused out there.

147
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:10,315
Power, ideals, the old morality

148
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:13,156
and practical military necessity.

149
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,200
But out there with these natives,

150
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:22,999
it must be a temptation to...

151
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,403
...be God.

152
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:32,107
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart

153
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,718
between the rational and the irrational,

154
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:38,647
between good and evil,

155
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:42,859
and good does not always triumph.

156
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:46,863
Sometimes...

157
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,933
...the dark side

158
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,829
overcomes what Lincoln called
"the better angels of our nature. "

159
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,008
Every man has got a breaking point.

160
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:02,243
You and I have them.

161
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:06,041
Walt Kurtz has reached his...

162
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:10,786
...and very obviously, he has gone insane.

163
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,232
Yes, sir. Very much so,
sir. Obviously insane.

164
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:36,973
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a Navy patrol boat,

165
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,576
pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Bha,

166
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:43,618
follow it, learn what you can along the way.

167
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:47,723
When you find the colonel,
infiltrate his team

168
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,859
by whatever means available,

169
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:52,120
and terminate the colonel's command.

170
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,099
Terminate the colonel.

171
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:06,170
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

172
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:10,438
totally beyond the pale of any acceptable

173
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:12,309
human conduct,

174
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,051
and he is still in the
field, commanding troops.

175
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:21,221
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

176
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:26,654
You understand, captain, that
this mission does not exist,

177
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,789
nor will it ever exist.

178
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:27,357
<i>How many people had I already killed?</i>

179
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:31,422
<i>There were those six that
I knew about for sure...</i>

180
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:35,759
<i>...close enough to blow
their last breath in my face,</i>

181
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:41,004
<i>But this time, it was an American...</i>

182
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:43,305
<i>...and an officer,</i>

183
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,052
<i>That wasn't supposed to
make any difference to me,</i>

184
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:58,881
<i>but it did,</i>

185
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,515
<i>Shit,</i>

186
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,421
<i>Charging a man with murder in this place</i>

187
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:08,394
<i>was like handing out speeding
tickets at the Indy 500,</i>

188
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:11,996
<i>I took the mission,</i>

189
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:14,694
<i>What the hell else was I gonna do?</i>

190
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,707
<i>But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him,</i>

191
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:29,352
Did you check the tank?

192
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,311
Yeah.

193
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,248
<i>I was being ferried down
the coast in a Navy PBR,</i>

194
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,920
<i>a type of plastic patrol boat, a
pretty common sight on the rivers,</i>

195
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,996
<i>They said it was a good
way to pick up information</i>

196
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,762
<i>and move without drawing a lot
of attention, and that was okay,</i>

197
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:50,736
<i>I needed the air and the time,</i>

198
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,374
<i>Only problem was I wouldn't be alone,</i>

199
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:55,477
Morning, captain.

200
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,876
<i>The crew were mostly just kids,</i>

201
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:04,543
<i>rock 'n' rollers with
one foot in their graves,</i>

202
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:08,556
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

203
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,256
<i>The machinist, the one they
called Chef, was from New Orleans,</i>

204
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:15,159
<i>He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam,</i>

205
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:17,027
<i>Probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans,</i>

206
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:21,021
<i>Lance, on the forward
50s, was a famous surfer</i>

207
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:22,855
<i>from the beaches south of L, A,</i>

208
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:33,034
<i>Clean, Mr, Clean, was from
some South Bronx shithole,</i>

209
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,174
<i>and I think the light
and the space of Vietnam</i>

210
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,969
<i>really put the zap on his head,</i>

211
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:42,845
<i>Then there was Phillips, the chief,</i>

212
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,679
<i>It might have been my mission, but
it sure as shit was the chief's boat,</i>

213
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:49,117
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water

214
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:51,348
to get into the Nung River.

215
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:54,755
They're both hot. Belong to Charlie.

216
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:57,728
Don't worry about it.

217
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:00,025
Don't smoke.

218
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:04,628
You know, I've pulled a
few special ops in here.

219
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:07,133
About six months ago,

220
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:11,305
I took a man who was going
up past the bridge at Do Lung.

221
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,572
He was regular Army too.

222
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:19,151
Heard he shot himself in the head.

223
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,134
<i>Good morning, Vietnam,</i>

224
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:37,803
<i>I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AMVN,</i>

225
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:41,532
<i>It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid,</i>

226
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:43,733
<i>And we have an important message for all Gls</i>

227
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:46,071
<i>who are living off-base
from the mayor of Saigon,</i>

228
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,247
Yeah!

229
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:50,678
<i>He'd like you to hang your laundry
indoors instead of on the windowsills,</i>

230
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:53,978
<i>The mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful,</i>

231
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,620
<i>Here's another blast from the past</i>

232
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:58,518
<i>going out to Big Sam, who's
alone in the mantle room out there</i>

233
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,990
<i>with the 1 st Battalion, 35th
Infantry, and dedicated by the fire team</i>

234
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:04,720
<i>at An Khe to their groovy CO Fred the Head;</i>

235
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:07,867
<i>- The Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction,"
- All right!</i>

236
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:11,836
Watch out, Clean!

237
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,269
Get down, bubba!

238
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:24,350
Hang on, Lance!

239
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,150
Get down, bubba!

240
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:52,077
Tell them you did it,
Lance. Tell them you did it.

241
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,408
I see you is right on target today, baby.

242
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:01,148
Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

243
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,617
All right!

244
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:05,716
Look out, Lance!

245
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:25,137
<i>At first, I thought they
handed me the wrong dossier,</i>

246
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:28,109
<i>I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead,</i>

247
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:32,581
<i>Third-generation West
Point, top of his class,</i>

248
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:36,813
<i>Korea, airborne, about
a thousand decorations,</i>

249
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:39,618
<i>et cetera, et cetera,</i>

250
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:46,029
<i>I'd heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me...</i>

251
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:51,729
<i>...but I couldn't connect
up that voice with this man,</i>

252
00:24:57,477 --> 00:25:01,072
<i>Like they said, he had an impressive career,</i>

253
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,545
<i>Maybe too impressive,</i>

254
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:06,276
<i>I mean, perfect,</i>

255
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:10,416
<i>He was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation,</i>

256
00:25:10,624 --> 00:25:14,560
<i>General, chief of staff, anything,</i>

257
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:19,755
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour
with Advisory Command in Vietnam,</i>

258
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:22,127
<i>and things started to slip,</i>

259
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:27,295
<i>His report to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and Lyndon Johnson was restricted,</i>

260
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:30,910
<i>Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them,</i>

261
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:35,481
<i>During the next few months, he
made three requests for transfer</i>

262
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:41,245
<i>to airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted,</i>

263
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:45,388
<i>Airborne?</i>

264
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:50,355
<i>He was 38 years old,</i>

265
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,058
<i>Why the fuck would he do that?</i>

266
00:25:56,069 --> 00:26:00,267
<i>1966, joins Special Forces,</i>

267
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:02,499
<i>returns Vietnam,</i>

268
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:04,667
Hey, what's that?

269
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:07,210
- Arc Light.
- What's up?

270
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:10,349
- B-52
strike. - Yeah?

271
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:11,778
- What's that?
- Arc Light.

272
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:14,977
I hate that. Every time I hear
that, something terrible happens.

273
00:26:15,188 --> 00:26:17,019
Charlie don't never see
them or hear them, man.

274
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:18,191
There they are.

275
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:20,859
The concussion will suck the
air out of your damn lungs.

276
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:22,921
Something terrible is gonna happen.

277
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,461
Smoke!

278
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:26,723
Secondary burning.

279
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,628
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

280
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:30,962
Let's have a look, Chief.

281
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:37,036
<i>- It was the Air Cav, 1 st of the 9th,
- That's them.</i>

282
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:39,838
<i>Our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River,</i>

283
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:43,880
<i>But they were supposed to be waiting
for us another 30 kilometers ahead,</i>

284
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:49,112
<i>Well, Airmobile, those
boys just couldn't stay put,</i>

285
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:04,769
Hey, kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

286
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:17,709
<i>First of the 9th was an old cavalry division</i>

287
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:19,715
<i>that had cashed in its horses for choppers</i>

288
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,583
<i>and gone tear-assing around
Nam looking for the shit,</i>

289
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:27,860
<i>They had given Charlie a few
surprises in their time here,</i>

290
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:29,822
<i>What they were mopping up now</i>

291
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,931
<i>hadn't even happened yet an hour ago,</i>

292
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,528
Just keep running by. We're for television.

293
00:27:35,735 --> 00:27:38,260
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on. Keep going.

294
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,996
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

295
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,699
Just go by like you're
fighting. Like you're fighting.

296
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,707
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television.

297
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:49,507
Just go through. Go through. Just
go by. Keep on going. Keep going.

298
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:51,445
Don't look at the camera. Go on. Keep going.

299
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:53,642
All right, come on. Go.

300
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,323
Yes. Over here. Over here.

301
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:18,575
- Where can I find the CO?
- Can't miss him, sir. He's over there.

302
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:21,613
Looking for a tank? I
got five tanks broken...

303
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:25,148
We're all right with the
tanks. It's all right, captain.

304
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:27,650
Captain Willard! I carry priority papers

305
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:30,186
from COMSEC Intelligence II Corps.

306
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,255
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you

307
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,017
on the requirements of my mission.

308
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,661
What mission? I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

309
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:39,696
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung.

310
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,264
- We'll see what we can do,
- Colonel.

311
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:44,699
But just stay out of my way
till this is done, captain.

312
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:52,070
All right, let's see what we
have. Let's see what we have.

313
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,182
A two of spades, three of
spades, four of diamonds,

314
00:28:57,617 --> 00:29:00,950
six of clubs, eight of spades.

315
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:03,384
There isn't one worth a
jack in the whole bunch.

316
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:05,584
Four of diamonds.

317
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:10,562
- Hey, captain, what's that?
- Death cards.

318
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:13,426
- What?
- Death cards.

319
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:16,067
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.

320
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:22,470
- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.

321
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:25,372
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

322
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:29,173
We are here to help you.

323
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:34,380
We are here to extend a welcome hand

324
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:37,613
- Come on. Everybody in?
- To those who would like to return

325
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:41,419
to the arms of the South
Vietnamese government.

326
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:44,126
Get in. Hurry up.

327
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:50,130
- Move it out.
- This is an area that is controlled

328
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:52,305
by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.

329
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:55,804
Hey! Hey, what's this?

330
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,773
What is this?

331
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:01,037
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

332
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:04,546
About the only thing that's holding
his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

333
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,185
Yeah? What do you have to say?

334
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:09,582
This soldier is dirty VC.

335
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:14,055
He wants water. He can drink paddy water.

336
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,557
Get out of here! Give me
that. Give me that canteen.

337
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:19,599
- He's VC.
- Any man that's brave enough to...

338
00:30:19,804 --> 00:30:22,329
Get out of here! I'll kick your fucking ass!

339
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,201
He killed a lot of our people!

340
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:27,105
Any man brave enough to fight
with his guts strapped on him

341
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:28,973
can drink from my canteen any day.

342
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,741
Hey, colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

343
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:34,213
Where? Here? You sure?

344
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:35,977
Down there.

345
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:39,014
Yeah? Here.

346
00:30:39,357 --> 00:30:42,417
Repeat, we have a body count. We have...

347
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:46,923
What's your name, sailor?

348
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,861
Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir.

349
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:52,298
- Gunner's Mate Third Class...
- Hey. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

350
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:53,994
Yes, sir.

351
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,830
It's an honor to meet you, Lance.

352
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,168
I've admired your nose riding for years.

353
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:01,277
I like your cutback too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

354
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,039
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

355
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:06,114
I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.

356
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:08,285
- This guy with you?
- Yeah.

357
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:10,147
I want you to meet some guys.

358
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:12,118
- This is Mike from San Diego.
- Far out.

359
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:13,415
Johnny from Malibu.

360
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,956
- John, hi.
- Pretty solid surfers.

361
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,650
- Far out.
- None of us are anywhere near

362
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:18,852
- your class, though.
- No way.

363
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:20,759
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.

364
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:22,796
I like to finish operations early.

365
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,492
Fly down to Vung Tau for the evening glass.

366
00:31:25,704 --> 00:31:28,002
Where you been riding, Lance?
Been riding since you got here?

367
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:30,674
No way. I haven't surfed since I been here.

368
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,811
- Through Christ, our Lord,
from whom all good things come.

369
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:37,675
Through him in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

370
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:41,010
all glory and honor is
yours, almighty Father.

371
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:43,119
- Amen.
- Let us bring our iniquities

372
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,585
to the Father in the
words our savior gave us.

373
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,625
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

374
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:53,229
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

375
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:55,194
on earth as it is in heaven.

376
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,925
Give us this day, our daily bread...

377
00:31:59,537 --> 00:32:02,301
- as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

378
00:32:02,507 --> 00:32:06,603
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

379
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:18,913
<i>Kilgore had had a pretty
good day for himself,</i>

380
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:21,149
<i>They choppered in the T-bones and the beer</i>

381
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,328
<i>and turned the LZ into a beach party,</i>

382
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:27,658
<i>The more they tried to
make it just like home,</i>

383
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:30,266
<i>the more they made everybody miss it,</i>

384
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:34,564
Make my meat rare. Rare but not cold.

385
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:43,077
<i>Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess,</i>

386
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:46,717
<i>He loved his boys, and
you felt safe with him,</i>

387
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:50,445
<i>He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him,</i>

388
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:53,749
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here,</i>

389
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,687
What happened to your mission, captain?

390
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:58,089
Nha Trang forget all about you?

391
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,101
Airborne.

392
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:10,574
Sir,

393
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:12,572
two places we can get into the river.

394
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:15,473
- Yeah.
- Here and here.

395
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,776
It's a pretty wide delta, but these are
the only two spots I'm really sure of.

396
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,788
Well, that village you're pointing
at is kind of hairy, Willard.

397
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:26,320
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.

398
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:28,014
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.

399
00:33:28,226 --> 00:33:31,024
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

400
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:32,662
What's the name of that goddamn village?

401
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:36,356
- Vin Drin Dop or Lop?
- Drop.

402
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:39,537
Damn gook names all sound the same.

403
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:43,803
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vin Din Drop?

404
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,440
That's a fantastic peak.

405
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:48,177
- Peak?
- About 6 foot.

406
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:52,042
It's an outstanding peak. It's got
both the long right and left slide,

407
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,481
with a bowl section. It's
unbelievable. It's just tube city.

408
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:01,589
Why didn't you tell me
that before? A good peak.

409
00:34:01,793 --> 00:34:04,353
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

410
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:07,122
- It's all goddamn beach break.
- It's really hairy in there, sir.

411
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:08,663
That's where we lost McDonald.

412
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:12,769
They shot the hell out of us
there. That's Charlie's point.

413
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:16,563
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.

414
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:19,106
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

415
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,107
We may not be able to get the boat in.

416
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,974
The draft at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

417
00:34:24,782 --> 00:34:27,683
We'll pick your boat up and put
it down right where you want it.

418
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:30,480
This is the 1 st of the 9th, Air Cav, son.

419
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,121
Airmobile.

420
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:34,821
I can take that point and
hold it as long as I like.

421
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:37,995
You can get anyplace up that river
that suits you, young captain.

422
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:40,562
Hell, a 6-foot peak.

423
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:44,227
All right, take a gunship
back to the division.

424
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:46,460
Lance, go with Mike,
let him pick out a board.

425
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:48,161
Bring me my Yater Spoon, the 8' 6".

426
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:50,568
- I don't know, sir, it's...
- What is it, soldier?

427
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:53,300
I mean, it's pretty hairy in
there. It's Charlie's point.

428
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,570
Charlie don't surf!

429
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:22,671
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't
gonna believe this. Look.

430
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:26,675
Hey, man. They're picking up the boat.

431
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:31,146
How are you feeling, Jimmy?

432
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:34,318
Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

433
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,050
All right, son. Let her rip.

434
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:39,985
Let's go.

435
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:05,098
I never have got used to a light board.

436
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:06,469
I can't get used to one.

437
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:09,271
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

438
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,540
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.

439
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,012
- Really?
- Yeah.

440
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:16,379
I thought all the young
guys like lighter boards.

441
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:18,384
You can't ride the nose on those things...

442
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:20,181
<i>Big Duke Six, Big Duke Six,</i>

443
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,222
This is Eagle Thrust 7. We got it spotted.

444
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:25,157
Big Duke Six to Eagle
Thrust. Put on heading 2-7-0.

445
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:26,921
Assume attack formation.

446
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,895
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke,
Okay, we're going in,</i>

447
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,068
Here we go.

448
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:33,533
We'll come in low out of the rising sun

449
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:36,263
and about a mile out, we'll put on the music.

450
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:38,806
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

451
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,071
Scares the hell out of the
slopes. My boys love it.

452
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:45,511
Hey, they're gonna play music.

453
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:54,915
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

454
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,787
So we don't get our balls blown off.

455
00:38:10,274 --> 00:38:13,471
Big Duke Six to Eagle
Thrust. Put on psy-war- op.

456
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:16,545
Make it loud. This is a Romeo Foxtrot.

457
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:18,681
Shall we dance?

458
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,249
Yes, sir.

459
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,227
- Come on.
- All right, all right.

460
00:40:57,108 --> 00:40:59,440
<i>We got a couple characters at that tree line,</i>

461
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:01,737
<i>We're taking fire from the holes,</i>

462
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,005
Run, Charlie!

463
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:10,785
<i>This should make everything down burn,</i>

464
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:25,599
<i>We got a couple of people ahead here,</i>

465
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:26,895
<i>What's going on down here?</i>

466
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:28,765
<i>We got an automatic, Shoot to kill!</i>

467
00:41:28,973 --> 00:41:30,099
<i>Shoot to kill in the open,</i>

468
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:33,971
I spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go and check it out.

469
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:37,409
<i>All right, this is Foxtrot, We're pulling in,</i>

470
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:48,180
What a shot.

471
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:51,793
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
Get you a case of beer for that.

472
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:16,147
Six-four-one-zero, we're
over the village right now.

473
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:19,255
I think I see a vehicle in the
courtyard. I'm gonna check it out.

474
00:42:19,457 --> 00:42:21,220
Well done, Hawks. Well done.

475
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:24,622
Want some 20 mike-mike Vulcan
right along those tree lines.

476
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:26,319
Ripple the shit out of them.

477
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:28,992
Got a vehicle on the
bridge. .50-caliber onboard.

478
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,760
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

479
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,598
Big Duke Six, clear the
area. I'm coming down myself.

480
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:37,501
Don't these people ever give up?

481
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:43,347
Nice shot, Bill.

482
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:46,842
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

483
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:49,513
It's just a flare!

484
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,588
- Get me out of here!
- Don't ask that shit.

485
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,690
Get it out of here! Don't ask to get it out.

486
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:57,861
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right. It's just a flare.

487
00:42:58,062 --> 00:42:59,962
Everybody all right? Lance, you all right?

488
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:01,358
I'm fine!

489
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:17,947
Get down!

490
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:40,135
I'm not going! I'm not going!

491
00:43:40,337 --> 00:43:41,998
I'm not going!

492
00:43:56,587 --> 00:43:58,612
<i>Now we just got secondaries
down in the plaza,</i>

493
00:43:58,823 --> 00:44:01,314
<i>Blue Three, Blue Four,
hold on to your position,</i>

494
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:04,756
<i>Duke Six, Duke Six, we've
got wounded down there,</i>

495
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:16,500
Get a stretcher over here!

496
00:44:21,612 --> 00:44:24,638
Please, God! Help me!

497
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:27,211
- Give him some morphine.
- My God!

498
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:29,818
Oh-three-seven-seven-four-two.

499
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,647
Where's that duster?!

500
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:34,723
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

501
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,449
I want my men out.

502
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,457
<i>Somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke,</i>

503
00:44:38,662 --> 00:44:42,189
<i>This is 10-10, We're gonna be
in, throw them on and get out,</i>

504
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:05,346
She's got a grenade!

505
00:45:05,556 --> 00:45:06,887
She's got a grenade!

506
00:45:09,326 --> 00:45:11,817
Oh, Jesus, the whole goddamn thing blew up.

507
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:14,361
<i>- She blew the shit out of...
- Fucking savages.</i>

508
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:17,422
<i>Get a medevac,</i>

509
00:45:17,635 --> 00:45:20,103
<i>Holy Christ, she's a sap,
I'm gonna get that dink bitch,</i>

510
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:23,501
<i>Get over there, Johnny, Put
the right skid right up her ass,</i>

511
00:45:26,377 --> 00:45:29,505
We gotta get air in these trees.
It's damn eat-up with enemy down here.

512
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:31,578
I'm taking fire. I'm taking hits all over.

513
00:45:31,782 --> 00:45:33,215
Three o'clock! Three o'clock.

514
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,248
I'm drawing fire. I'm drawing heavy fire.

515
00:45:35,452 --> 00:45:39,115
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm going
in, My tail rotor's out, I got control,</i>

516
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:50,325
- What do you think?
- Wow, this is really exciting, man.

517
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:52,195
No, no, the waves!

518
00:45:52,403 --> 00:45:53,768
- The waves!
- Oh, right.

519
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:55,632
Look at that. Breaks both ways. Watch.

520
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,568
Watch.

521
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:00,573
Look! Good 6-foot swells!

522
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:25,525
Come here, Lance.

523
00:46:29,306 --> 00:46:31,069
Incoming!

524
00:46:34,578 --> 00:46:37,638
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
You ought to surf somewhere else.

525
00:46:37,848 --> 00:46:39,475
What do you know about surfing, major?

526
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:41,708
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

527
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:46,415
Come here. Come here!

528
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,058
- Change.
- You mean right now, sir?

529
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:54,162
I wanna see how rideable
that stuff is. Go change.

530
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:55,923
It's still pretty hairy out there.

531
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:58,033
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

532
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:01,636
That's good, son, because you
either surf or fight, that clear?

533
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,272
Now get going.

534
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:06,773
I'll cover for them. And
bring a board for Lance.

535
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:10,043
We can't do shit until the boat gets here.

536
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:13,546
Lance, I'll bet you can't
wait to get out there.

537
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:15,651
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

538
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,583
One guy can break right,
one left, simultaneous.

539
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:19,915
What do you think of that?

540
00:47:20,124 --> 00:47:22,251
I think we ought to wait
for the tide to come up.

541
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:25,257
- Lance, come here. Look, look.
- Incoming!

542
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:30,964
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!

543
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:34,967
You wanna wait here for six hours?

544
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:41,039
Chief!

545
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:50,418
<i>Okay, fellas, quit hiding, Come on! Let's go!</i>

546
00:47:52,714 --> 00:47:54,113
- Dickheads, take off!
- Goddamn it!

547
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:56,716
Don't you think it's a
little risky for R and R?

548
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:58,214
If I say it's safe to
surf this beach, captain,

549
00:47:58,249 --> 00:47:59,511
If I say it's safe to
surf this beach, captain,

550
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:01,382
it's safe to surf this beach!

551
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,421
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place.

552
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:06,355
I'll surf this fucking place.

553
00:48:08,496 --> 00:48:10,589
Give me that RT, soldier.

554
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:15,330
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six. Goddamn it!

555
00:48:15,537 --> 00:48:17,300
<i>I wanted that tree line bombed!</i>

556
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:20,133
Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.

557
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:22,173
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son!</i>

558
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:24,208
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove
One-Three, Roger,</i>

559
00:48:24,412 --> 00:48:27,575
<i>They need napalm in the tree
line, Can you put it down there?</i>

560
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:30,842
<i>Right, One-Three, We're fixing to
fuck with them, What's the target?</i>

561
00:48:31,052 --> 00:48:33,987
<i>We're trying to suppress some
mortar fire off the tree line there,</i>

562
00:48:34,189 --> 00:48:35,281
<i>Roger, Here we come,</i>

563
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,687
<i>Good, Give it all you got,
Bring in all your ships,</i>

564
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:42,330
Don't worry.

565
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:46,159
We'll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.

566
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:49,229
<i>Big Duke Six, the jets are inbound now,</i>

567
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:52,634
<i>You got 30 seconds, Get your
people back and heads down,</i>

568
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:54,604
<i>This is gonna be a big one,</i>

569
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:18,762
You smell that?

570
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,401
- Do you smell that?
- What?

571
00:49:21,603 --> 00:49:23,833
Napalm, son.

572
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:26,473
Nothing else in the world smells like that.

573
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,166
Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!

574
00:49:30,912 --> 00:49:33,642
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

575
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:36,715
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

576
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:39,216
And when it was all over, I walked up.

577
00:49:40,088 --> 00:49:43,751
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

578
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,295
But the smell... You
know, that gasoline smell.

579
00:49:48,496 --> 00:49:50,589
The whole hill...

580
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,467
...smelled like...

581
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,331
...victory.

582
00:50:02,277 --> 00:50:04,677
Someday this war's gonna end.

583
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:29,201
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

584
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:30,564
Come on. Let's get high.

585
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:32,672
- Wanna smoke?
- Just do it, man. Light up.

586
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:35,172
<i>Someday this war's gonna end,</i>

587
00:50:36,211 --> 00:50:38,975
<i>That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat,</i>

588
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,671
<i>They weren't looking for
anything more than a way home,</i>

589
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:46,547
<i>- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there</i>

590
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:49,383
<i>and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore,</i>

591
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:55,092
Buddha time. Here.

592
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,445
All right, that's great, motherfuckers. Yeah.

593
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,160
All right, that's great, motherfuckers. Yeah.

594
00:51:04,172 --> 00:51:06,572
<i>If that's how Kilgore fought the war</i>

595
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:10,711
<i>I began to wonder what they
really had against Kurtz,</i>

596
00:51:10,912 --> 00:51:13,608
<i>It wasn't just insanity and murder,</i>

597
00:51:13,815 --> 00:51:16,511
<i>There was enough of that
to go around for everyone,</i>

598
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:29,653
I mean, he never was hurting for pussy.

599
00:51:29,864 --> 00:51:35,996
I'm not here. I'm walking through
the jungle gathering mangoes.

600
00:51:36,204 --> 00:51:38,434
I meet Raquel Welch.

601
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:43,636
I make a nice mango cream pudding.

602
00:51:46,347 --> 00:51:49,043
You know, kind of spread it around on us.

603
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:53,812
Hey, captain, I wanna get some mangoes.

604
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:56,081
Just don't go out there by yourself.

605
00:51:56,925 --> 00:51:58,039
You don't want to go in there alone.

606
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,153
You don't want to go in there alone.

607
00:52:00,462 --> 00:52:01,986
Not unless you really know the territory.

608
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:04,028
Any poisonous snakes around here?

609
00:52:04,532 --> 00:52:07,467
Fuck it. I'm gonna go get some mango.

610
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,368
Chef?

611
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:20,404
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

612
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:23,277
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

613
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:27,353
- Because you like mangoes and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

614
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:31,456
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

615
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,791
Yes, sir.

616
00:52:33,995 --> 00:52:35,724
See, I come from New Orleans.

617
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:40,333
I was raised to be a
saucier, a great saucier.

618
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:44,198
- What's a saucier?
- We specialize in sauces.

619
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:50,710
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.

620
00:52:57,018 --> 00:52:59,646
Then I was supposed to go to Paris,

621
00:52:59,854 --> 00:53:02,220
study at the Escoffier school.

622
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:05,920
But then I got orders for my physical.

623
00:53:18,892 --> 00:53:20,484
Hell, I joined the Navy.

624
00:53:20,694 --> 00:53:22,821
Heard they had better food.

625
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:25,694
Cook school, that did it.

626
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:29,801
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.

627
00:53:32,506 --> 00:53:36,499
They lined us up in front of
a hundred yards of prime rib.

628
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:39,907
All of us, you know, lined up looking at it.

629
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:43,880
Magnificent meat, really.
Beautifully marbled.

630
00:53:46,987 --> 00:53:50,582
Next thing, they're throwing the
meat into these big cauldrons.

631
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,123
All of it. Boiling it.

632
00:53:54,094 --> 00:53:57,063
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.

633
00:53:58,232 --> 00:54:00,666
I couldn't fucking believe that one.

634
00:54:00,868 --> 00:54:04,326
That's when I applied for radioman
school, but then they gave me the...

635
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:47,770
What is it?

636
00:54:49,883 --> 00:54:51,851
Charlie?

637
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:03,589
It's a tiger!

638
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:09,027
Son of a bitch. It's a
tiger, man! It's a tiger!

639
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:11,770
Battle stations. Lance, up front.

640
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:13,166
- Get on your 60.
- Got it.

641
00:55:13,373 --> 00:55:17,969
- Holy shit. A fucking tiger.
- Chef, come on!

642
00:55:18,178 --> 00:55:21,170
- Captain, come on.
- Let's hop in and go.

643
00:55:21,381 --> 00:55:22,848
Let's go!

644
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,118
Chief, you were right.
Never get out of the boat.

645
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,914
- Bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?

646
00:55:29,923 --> 00:55:32,414
I gotta remember. Never get out of the boat.

647
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:34,783
Never get out of the boat.

648
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,865
- What happened? How many is it?
- A fucking tiger!

649
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,557
- What?
- A fucking tiger.

650
00:55:41,768 --> 00:55:43,030
- A tiger?
- Yes.

651
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:48,038
I've had it! I've had the
whole goddamn fucking shit, man!

652
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:50,836
You can kiss my ass on the county square

653
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:52,841
because I'm fucking bugging out.

654
00:55:53,046 --> 00:55:54,479
I didn't come here for this.

655
00:55:54,681 --> 00:55:57,343
I don't fucking need it! I don't want it.

656
00:55:57,551 --> 00:56:01,282
I didn't get out of the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

657
00:56:02,156 --> 00:56:04,283
All I wanna do is fucking cook!

658
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:06,686
I just wanted to learn to fucking cook, man!

659
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:08,521
You're all right. You're all right.

660
00:56:09,596 --> 00:56:11,757
What happened, bro?

661
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,733
You're all right. You're gonna be all right.

662
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:17,301
All right. It's gonna be all right?

663
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:18,766
It's gonna be all right.

664
00:56:18,972 --> 00:56:22,464
Never get out of the fucking boat.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

665
00:56:22,676 --> 00:56:25,770
Hi, tiger. Bye, tiger. Goodbye!

666
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:30,145
<i>Never get out of the boat,</i>

667
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,818
<i>Absolutely, goddamn right,</i>

668
00:56:34,254 --> 00:56:36,518
<i>Unless you were going all the way,</i>

669
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:43,625
<i>Kurtz got off the boat,</i>

670
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:47,992
<i>He split from the whole fucking program,</i>

671
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:53,565
<i>How did that happen?</i>

672
00:56:53,774 --> 00:56:56,470
<i>What did he see here that first tour?</i>

673
00:57:03,016 --> 00:57:05,541

<i>His family and friends
couldn't understand it,</i>

680
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:25,538

681
00:57:28,267 --> 00:57:31,464
<i>He had to apply three times,
and he put up with a ton of shit,</i>

resign, they gave it to him,</i>

<i>A tough motherfucker,</i>

688
00:57:58,764 --> 00:58:00,459
<i>He finished it,</i>

689
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:05,134
<i>He could have gone for general...</i>

690
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:08,805

Jesus.

714

- It goes back up into the truck.
- What?

715
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:17,531
We gotta get all that stuff up.

716
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:26,267
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?

717
01:00:26,478 --> 01:00:27,843
I bet you we can score up here.

Yo, man. Check out the bikes, Lance.

719
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,816
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah.

720
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:37,045
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.

721
01:00:37,255 --> 01:00:38,916
Yeah, man. This is something.

722
01:00:42,928 --> 01:00:44,327
- Please.
- This must be the guy.

723
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:46,019
Right over there.

Come on, man. Move. We don't have time.

727
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:02,040
One hour. That's all. What do you want?

728
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:06,183
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

729
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:08,876
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

730
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:12,352
- I don't have no destination.
- Can't do a goddamn thing without it.

731
01:01:12,557 --> 01:01:14,889
- Sarge? Sarge?
- Got a destination?

732
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:17,618
I need a destination. Can't
do a goddamn thing without it.

733
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:21,287
Sarge, these guys are with
me. Destination's classified.

734
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,900
I carry priority papers
from COMSEC Intelligence.

735
01:01:24,102 --> 01:01:26,866
Okay. Right, sir. Hey,
listen, it's a real big night.

736
01:01:27,072 --> 01:01:29,540
- Eight bucks for that...
- Hey.

737
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:32,941
All right. Damn.

738
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:36,410
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

739
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:39,209
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, captain.

740
01:01:39,418 --> 01:01:42,979
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

741
01:01:43,889 --> 01:01:46,790
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

742
01:01:46,992 --> 01:01:50,189
Would you guys like some seats...?
Some press-box seats for the show?

743
01:01:50,395 --> 01:01:53,523
You want those? The show out here.

744
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:55,892
- Bunnies, bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

745
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:57,830
You got it. Are you gonna be here?

746
01:01:58,036 --> 01:02:01,301
Hey, listen, captain, on the house.

747
01:02:01,506 --> 01:02:04,066
No hard feelings, huh?

748
01:02:40,378 --> 01:02:42,539
How you doing out there?

749
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:45,414
I said, how you doing out there?

We wanna let you know we're proud of you.

756
01:03:02,534 --> 01:03:05,867
We know how tough and
how hard it's been. Yeah!

757
01:03:06,071 --> 01:03:08,164

- Take it off!

771

Take it off!

772
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:16,727
Hey, lover! You want us to come over?

773
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:20,803

824
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:14,373
<i>And they called me in,</i>

I know where I'm going.

833
01:10:50,251 --> 01:10:52,685
I'm going to the White House to have dinner

837
01:11:02,397 --> 01:11:04,024
Clean.

838
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:10,036
How long has that kid been on this boat?

839
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:12,035
Seven months.

840
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,737
He's really specializing in busting my balls.

841
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:18,674
Very possible, captain,
he thinks the same of you.

842
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,372
Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?

843
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:24,211
I don't think.

844
01:11:24,419 --> 01:11:26,046
My orders say I'm not supposed to know

845
01:11:26,254 --> 01:11:28,620
where I'm taking this boat, so I don't.

846
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:32,884
But one look at you and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

847
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:46,804
We're going upriver about 75
klicks above the Do Lung Bridge.

848
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:54,148
- That's Cambodia, captain.
- That's classified.

849
01:11:55,216 --> 01:11:56,808
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,

850
01:11:57,018 --> 01:11:58,952
but that's where I'm going.

851
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:02,748
You just get me close to my destination
and I'll cut you and the crew loose.

852
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:09,174
All right, captain.

853
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,395
<i>"Dear son,</i>

854
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:35,461
<i>I'm afraid both you and your
mother will have been worried</i>

855
01:12:35,672 --> 01:12:38,539
<i>at not hearing from me during the past weeks,</i>

856
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:42,075
<i>but my situation here has
become a difficult one,</i>

857
01:12:42,679 --> 01:12:46,513
<i>I have been officially
accused of murder by the Army,</i>

858
01:12:52,856 --> 01:12:56,087
<i>The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents,</i>

859
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:58,259
<i>We spent months uncovering
them and accumulating evidence,</i>

860
01:12:58,294 --> 01:13:00,225
<i>We spent months uncovering
them and accumulating evidence,</i>

861
01:13:02,098 --> 01:13:04,362
<i>When absolute proof was completed, we acted,</i>

862
01:13:04,568 --> 01:13:06,832
<i>We acted like soldiers,</i>

863
01:13:07,604 --> 01:13:09,936
<i>The charges are unjustified,</i>

864
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,735
<i>They are, in fact, and in the
circumstances of this conflict,</i>

865
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:16,606
<i>quite completely insane,</i>

866
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:31,184
<i>In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action,</i>

867
01:13:31,394 --> 01:13:34,124
<i>There are many moments for ruthless action,</i>

868
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:36,765
<i>What is often called ruthless,</i>

869
01:13:36,967 --> 01:13:40,266
<i>but may in many
circumstances be only clarity,</i>

870
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:43,769
<i>seeing clearly what there
is to be done and doing it</i>

871
01:13:43,974 --> 01:13:46,943
<i>- directly, quickly, awake,
- Alpha, Tango, Tango,</i>

872
01:13:47,143 --> 01:13:48,940
<i>- Echo, Tango, Alpha.
- Looking at it,</i>

873
01:13:49,145 --> 01:13:52,012
Request dust-off. Three,
maybe four KIAs. Over.

874
01:13:52,215 --> 01:13:55,582
<i>I would trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter,</i>

875
01:13:55,785 --> 01:14:00,119
<i>As for the charges against
me, I am unconcerned,</i>

876
01:14:00,323 --> 01:14:05,920
<i>I am beyond their timid, lying
morality, and so I am beyond caring,</i>

877
01:14:06,763 --> 01:14:08,890
<i>You have all my faith,</i>

878
01:14:09,099 --> 01:14:11,260
<i>Your loving father,"</i>

879
01:14:23,647 --> 01:14:25,205
Shove it, fuck-up.

880
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:28,509
Sorry about that. If I'd have
known, I'd take you to New Orleans.

881
01:14:28,718 --> 01:14:31,152
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to cooz.

882
01:14:31,688 --> 01:14:32,985
You're a fucking dog!

883
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:35,783
Come on down to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, you prick.

884
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:37,186
Lay off, Chef.

885
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:39,555
You're the only fucking
prick I see around here.

886
01:14:39,763 --> 01:14:42,163
If I wanna play with a
prick, I'll play with my own.

887
01:14:42,365 --> 01:14:44,890
You wouldn't know what
to do with it, cherry boy.

888
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:46,898
Chef, I said lay off!

889
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:51,468
Chef, knock it off! Give him a
break! What do you think I said?

890
01:14:52,108 --> 01:14:53,507
Then give your jaws a rest!

891
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:57,643
And this ain't the Army. You are a sailor.

892
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:00,308
So get out of that
frizzly Army-looking shit,

893
01:15:00,517 --> 01:15:03,918
and stop smoking that dope. You hear me?

894
01:15:07,924 --> 01:15:10,222
Lance, what's with all the green paint?

895
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:12,759
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

896
01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:15,123
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

897
01:15:15,565 --> 01:15:18,659
I want you to stay awake up
there, man. You got a job to do.

898
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:42,296
Sampan off the port bow.
Let's take a look. Lance.

899
01:15:42,505 --> 01:15:46,339
Bring them in. Clean, on
the 60. Chef, get a 16.

900
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:49,603
Clean, get on that 60!

901
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,712
What's up, Chief?

902
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:58,177
A junk boat, captain. We're
gonna take a routine check.

903
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,754
Well, let's forget routine
now and let them go.

904
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:03,448
These boats are running
supplies in this delta, captain.

905
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,457
I'm gonna take a look.

906
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,629
Chief, my mission's got priority.

907
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:11,130
Hell, you wouldn't even be in this
part of the river if it wasn't for me.

908
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:14,861
Until we reach your destination,
captain, you're just on for the ride.

909
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:18,402
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.

910
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:21,702
All right. Come on. Let's bring it over.

911
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:37,760
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

912
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,033
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker! Move it!

913
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:51,366
- You too. Come on.
- Keep your eyes open.

914
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:52,734
I got you, Chief.

915
01:16:57,514 --> 01:16:59,106
It's clear, Chief.

916
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:08,218
Okay, that's them. That's them. They're okay.

917
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:11,552
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fucking boat.

918
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:14,127
- There ain't nothing on it.
- Board it and search it.

919
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,696
There's baskets, there's
ducks. Fucking bananas.

920
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,333
Ain't nothing on it.

921
01:17:18,568 --> 01:17:22,436
- What's wrong with you? Search it.
- There's the goat. Some fish.

922
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,266
- Chef.
- Fucking vegetables...

923
01:17:24,474 --> 01:17:26,601
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothing on it, man!

924
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,901
- Get on it!
- All right!

925
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:31,305
Move it, asshole! Move it, goddamn it!

926
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:33,607
Some pigs. Look, mangoes.

927
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,284
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fucking rice.

928
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:39,319
- Look in there, Chef. Look in it.
- Coconuts and fucking fish.

929
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:43,458
More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.

930
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:47,287
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here! Come on!

931
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:50,432
- Get over there, goddamn it!
- Chef, check that vegetable basket.

932
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:52,430
- All right.
- Shut up, slope!

933
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:55,069
- There ain't nothing in here.
- What's in the boxes?

934
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:57,501
- Look in that tin can. That rusty can.
- Nothing.

935
01:17:57,707 --> 01:18:00,335
Just fucking rice and that's
all! There ain't nothing on it!

936
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:03,671
Check the yellow can. She was
sitting on it. What's in it?

937
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,874
Chef!

938
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:12,918
Motherfuckers!

939
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:14,089
Motherfuckers!

940
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,755
Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers!

941
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:25,524
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all, huh?

942
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:28,431
- Motherfucking cocksucking mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

943
01:18:28,638 --> 01:18:31,402
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit out of all of them.

944
01:18:31,608 --> 01:18:35,237
- Hold it, Chef! Hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

945
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:38,140
Why the fuck not?

946
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:41,582
- Clean?
- I'm good.

947
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,350
- You okay, Lance?
- Fuck! Shit!

948
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:53,892
- Chef, you okay?
- Look what she was hiding, huh?

949
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:57,794
- You all right?
- See what she was running for?

950
01:19:00,703 --> 01:19:02,034
It's a fucking puppy.

951
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:05,803
It's a fucking puppy.

952
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,378
- Give me that dog! Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!

953
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:12,412
- Fucking give it to me!
- No, give me the fucking dog, asshole!

954
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:14,515
Fuck you!

955
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,750
- Chef. Chef.
- Fucking mango too! You want that?

956
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:20,980
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

957
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:23,886
Chef! She's moving behind you. Check her out!

958
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,254
All right. All right.

959
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:28,657
- Come on, Clean!
- She's not dead. She's wounded.

960
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:30,833
- Clean, give him a hand.
- Fuck it.

961
01:19:31,034 --> 01:19:33,093
Just take it easy. Take it easy.

962
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:36,902
- Slow down and take it easy.
- All right, Chef, just wait a minute.

963
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,903
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing?

964
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:42,703
- She's hurt. She's bleeding.
- Oh, man.

965
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,277
Bring her onboard. We're
taking her to an ARVN.

966
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:48,507
- What are you talking about?
- We're taking her to some friendlies.

967
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:51,243
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there, Chef.

968
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:52,546
The book says, captain...

969
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:06,493
Fuck, yeah. Fuck them.

970
01:20:06,703 --> 01:20:08,694
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.

971
01:21:09,887 --> 01:21:13,687
<i>It was a way we had over
here of living with ourselves,</i>

972
01:21:14,058 --> 01:21:15,821
<i>We'd cut them in half with a machine gun</i>

973
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:18,052
<i>and give them a Band-Aid,</i>

974
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:21,689
<i>It was a lie,</i>

975
01:21:22,033 --> 01:21:24,399
<i>And the more I saw of them,</i>

976
01:21:24,769 --> 01:21:27,363
<i>the more I hated lies,</i>

977
01:21:28,906 --> 01:21:30,601
<i>Those boys were never gonna look at me</i>

978
01:21:30,808 --> 01:21:32,799
<i>the same way again,</i>

979
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:36,203
<i>But I felt like I knew one
or two things about Kurtz</i>

980
01:21:36,414 --> 01:21:38,644
<i>that weren't in the dossier,</i>

981
01:21:43,521 --> 01:21:48,220
<i>Do Lung Bridge was the last
Army outpost on the Nung River,</i>

982
01:21:52,063 --> 01:21:54,759
<i>Beyond it, there was only Kurtz,</i>

983
01:21:56,467 --> 01:21:59,061
Lance. Hey, Lance.

984
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:01,636
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

985
01:22:03,774 --> 01:22:07,232
I mean, what's the matter with
you? You acting kind of weird.

986
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:10,306
Hey, you know that last
tab of acid I was saving?

987
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:13,039
- Yeah.
- I dropped it.

988
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,651
You dropped acid? Far out.

989
01:22:18,456 --> 01:22:21,084
- Hey, friendly!
- Friendly!

990
01:22:27,832 --> 01:22:30,892
- Take me home!
- Goddamn it!

991
01:22:31,102 --> 01:22:34,128
- Fucking shore police!
- Man, you wanna die?

992
01:22:34,672 --> 01:22:36,970
Don't keep going!

993
01:22:38,376 --> 01:22:40,640
- You fucking police!
- Don't leave me!

994
01:22:40,845 --> 01:22:42,642
Fuck you!

995
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,148
You'll get what you deserve!

996
01:22:53,357 --> 01:22:56,656
- Is there a Captain Willard onboard?
- Yeah.

997
01:22:56,861 --> 01:22:58,852
- Captain Willard?
- Yeah. Who's that?

998
01:22:59,063 --> 01:23:02,032
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.
- Get that light off me.

999
01:23:03,868 --> 01:23:06,598
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1000
01:23:06,804 --> 01:23:10,035
They expected you here a little
sooner. This is mail for the boat.

1001
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:12,141
You don't know how happy this makes me, sir.

1002
01:23:12,343 --> 01:23:14,402
- Why?
- Now I can get out if I can find a way.

1003
01:23:19,573 --> 01:23:23,134
You're in the asshole of the world, captain.

1004
01:23:27,047 --> 01:23:28,708
Captain, where you going?

1005
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:32,511
I gotta find somebody.
I need some information.

1006
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,917
Pick me up at the other side of the bridge.

1007
01:23:35,122 --> 01:23:36,885
- Somebody go with him.
- Chef.

1008
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,648
I'll go.

1009
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:40,822
I wanna go.

1010
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,022
<i>Get your ass in gear,</i>

1011
01:24:33,302 --> 01:24:35,463
Man, listen to the music, man.

1012
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:37,229
Where can I find the CO?

1013
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:41,205
- You came right to it, son of a bitch.
- Lance!

1014
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:43,571
Get down here!

1015
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:48,648
You still got a commanding officer here?

1016
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,182
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1017
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,580
Straight up the road

1018
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:56,315
there's a concrete fucking
bunker called Beverly Hills!

1019
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:59,892
Where the fuck else do you think it would be?

1020
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:36,193
Goddamn it. You stepped in my face.

1021
01:25:36,398 --> 01:25:39,765
- We thought you were dead.
- Well, you thought wrong, damn it.

1022
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,939
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?

1023
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,937
You think you're so bad, huh, nigga?

1024
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:49,066
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1025
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:51,712
Man, what the fuck you think I'm shooting at?

1026
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:54,279
I'm sorry, sir. There are
gooks out there by the wire.

1027
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,916
But I think I killed them all.

1028
01:25:56,118 --> 01:25:58,109
Oh, you ain't shot shit, man. Listen.

1029
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,785
Oh, shit. He's trying to call
his friends, man. Send up a flare.

1030
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,791
Think you're so bad, huh,
nigga? You think you bad, huh?

1031
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,995
They're all dead, stupid. There's one
still alive underneath the dead bodies.

1032
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,764
Who's the commanding officer here?

1033
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:22,605
Ain't you?

1034
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:25,773
You think you so bad, huh?

1035
01:26:25,981 --> 01:26:28,074
I got something for your ass now, nigga!

1036
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:30,547
I got something for you now!

1037
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,016
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1038
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,123
- Go get the Roach, man.
- Man, he's asleep.

1039
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:40,955
- Go get the Roach, nigga!
- I'm gonna go get the Roach.

1040
01:26:41,163 --> 01:26:42,562
Go get him.

1041
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:48,568
Roach. Roach.

1042
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:50,431
Roach.

1043
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,130
Got slopes on the wire, man. You hear them?

1044
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:56,072
- Lance!
- Do you hear them?

1045
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,483
We'll bust them.

1046
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:08,480
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1047
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:19,632
You hear him out there on the wire, man?

1048
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:21,835
Yeah.

1049
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:24,005
I kill you, GI!

1050
01:27:24,206 --> 01:27:26,003
You need a flare?

1051
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,342
No.

1052
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,305
He's close, man.

1053
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,676
He's real close.

1054
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:57,869
GI, fuck you!

1055
01:28:00,175 --> 01:28:03,872
GI! GI, fuck...

1056
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:10,443
Motherfucker.

1057
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,715
Hey, soldier.

1058
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:18,725
Do you know who's in command here?

1059
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,063
Yeah.

1060
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,411
Holy shit.

1061
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:46,911
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys
just got blown off that bridge.

1062
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:50,216
Yo, hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.

1063
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:55,591
- What's that?
- Mail, man.

1064
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:58,459
Later on the mail. Watch them trees.

1065
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:03,365
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1066
01:29:03,572 --> 01:29:05,130
Let's move out.

1067
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,739
Did you find the CO, captain?

1068
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:09,672
There's no fucking CO here.

1069
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:13,213
Let's just get going.

1070
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:15,280
Which way, captain?

1071
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,683
You know which way, Chief.

1072
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:26,053
You're on your own, captain.

1073
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:29,995
Still wanna go on? It's like this bridge.

1074
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,031
We build it every night. Charlie
blows it right back up again

1075
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:35,760
just so the generals can say the road's open.

1076
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:37,563
Think about it.

1077
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:43,845
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1078
01:29:47,983 --> 01:29:50,508
Chef, on the bow.

1079
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:53,783
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!

1080
01:30:50,145 --> 01:30:51,737
Whose package is that?

1081
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,916
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit. Wait a minute.

1082
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,105
Is that it?

1083
01:30:56,318 --> 01:30:57,876
That's it for you. Lance.

1084
01:30:58,687 --> 01:31:01,884
Mr. L.B. Johnson, there you go.

1085
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:05,787
Far out, man. All right, I've
been waiting for this one.

1086
01:31:05,994 --> 01:31:07,461
I got another one.

1087
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,254
I got a box from Eva.

1088
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:12,024
"Lance, I am fine.

1089
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:14,201
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.

1090
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:15,733
Sue skinned her knee. "

1091
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:17,928
Man, I wanna get back to Antoine's.

1092
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,630
Yes, I remember the time. How
could I fucking forget, man?

1093
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,037
- Beautiful.
- Man, you know, that's the best.

1094
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:25,576
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1095
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:26,804
Let me know. "

1096
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:30,178
Jim, it's here. It really is here.

1097
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:37,257
<i>"There has been a new
development regarding your mission</i>

01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,561

1113
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,663
That's really weird, ain't it?

1114
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:27,206
- Purple haze. Look.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1115
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:29,240
I got a tape from my mom for Chief.

1116

01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:36,878
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1119
01:32:37,085 --> 01:32:40,577
She pictures me at home
having a beer, watching TV.

1120
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:45,757
- Hey, Lance, man.
- Hot potato, hot potato.

<i>I'm so glad you decided to join the Navy,</i>

1122

Eva's not sure she can have a
relationship with me, you know.

1123
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,895
Here I am 13,000 fucking miles away

01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:33,469
Take this, motherfuckers!

Chef! Chef, check out Clean!

1132
01:33:57,599 --> 01:33:59,396
Captain, he's hit, he's hit. Clean's hit.

Lance, check out Clean!

Clean...

1154
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,821
Can't see nothing. We stopping.

1155
01:36:55,023 --> 01:36:57,321
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1156
01:36:57,526 --> 01:37:00,893
I said I can't see a thing,
captain. I'm stopping this boat.

1157
01:37:01,096 --> 01:37:02,495
I ain't risking no more lives.

1158
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:06,225
I'm in command here, goddamn
it. You'll do what I say.

1159
01:37:07,803 --> 01:37:10,101
You see anything, Chef?

1160
01:37:11,974 --> 01:37:14,841
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1161
01:37:33,429 --> 01:37:35,226
Watch it over here, Chief.

1162
01:37:36,799 --> 01:37:38,391
Got a stump.

1163
01:37:40,369 --> 01:37:42,837
Lance, on the 50s.

1164
01:37:43,038 --> 01:37:45,131
<i>He was close,</i>

1165
01:37:46,809 --> 01:37:49,300
<i>He was real close,</i>

1166
01:37:50,779 --> 01:37:53,543
<i>I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him</i>

1167
01:37:53,749 --> 01:37:55,580
<i>as if the boat were being sucked upriver</i>

1168
01:37:55,784 --> 01:37:58,685
<i>and the water was flowing
back into the jungle,</i>

1169
01:38:01,223 --> 01:38:03,088
<i>Whatever was going to happen,</i>

1170
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:07,558
<i>it wasn't going to be the way
they called it back at Nha Trang,</i>

01:38:12,259 --> 01:38:14,523
Arrows! Fire!

1172
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:19,690
Chef, open up! Fire!

1173
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:25,199
Chef, fire!

1174
01:38:33,346 --> 01:38:36,907
Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.

1175
01:38:37,117 --> 01:38:38,516
They're just little toy arrows.

1176
01:38:38,718 --> 01:38:40,709
Cut it out! Quiet!

1177
01:38:40,921 --> 01:38:43,481
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1178
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:46,420
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1179
01:38:46,626 --> 01:38:48,560
Quiet!

1180
01:38:48,895 --> 01:38:51,295
You got us in this mess,
and now you can't get us out,

1181
01:38:51,498 --> 01:38:54,092
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do you?

1182
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:56,235
Do you?

1183
01:38:56,436 --> 01:38:59,837
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1184
01:39:01,241 --> 01:39:03,368
Lance, get the wheel!

1185
01:39:03,877 --> 01:39:07,836
You savages, come and get
it! You son of a bitches!

1186
01:39:28,001 --> 01:39:30,026
A spear.

1187
01:40:49,115 --> 01:40:52,312
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia.

1188
01:40:52,519 --> 01:40:54,987
There's a Green Beret colonel
up there who's gone insane

1189
01:40:55,188 --> 01:40:56,849
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1190
01:40:58,358 --> 01:41:01,191
That's fucking typical. Shit.

1191
01:41:01,394 --> 01:41:03,487
Fucking Vietnam mission.

1192
01:41:03,697 --> 01:41:07,224
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1193
01:41:07,434 --> 01:41:11,234
That's fucking great! That's
just fucking great, man.

1194
01:41:12,205 --> 01:41:15,333
Shit. That's fucking crazy.

1195
01:41:15,542 --> 01:41:18,443
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge

1196
01:41:18,645 --> 01:41:22,012
or some fucking railroad tracks or something.

1197
01:41:22,482 --> 01:41:24,541
- Sorry.
- No. No, wait. Wait.

1198
01:41:24,751 --> 01:41:27,777
We'll go together on the
boat. We'll go with you.

1199
01:41:27,988 --> 01:41:32,118
We'll go up there but on the boat. Okay?

1200
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:40,593
<i>Part of me was afraid of what I would find</i>

1201
01:42:40,794 --> 01:42:43,524
<i>and what I would do when I got there,</i>

1202
01:42:45,732 --> 01:42:47,825
<i>I knew the risks,</i>

1203
01:42:48,568 --> 01:42:51,036
<i>Or imagined I knew,</i>

1204
01:42:52,706 --> 01:42:57,973
<i>But the thing I felt the
most, much stronger than fear,</i>

1205
01:42:58,578 --> 01:43:01,547
<i>was the desire to confront him,</i>

1206
01:44:13,186 --> 01:44:15,120
Just keep moving.

1207
01:44:15,321 --> 01:44:19,758
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.

1208
01:45:45,745 --> 01:45:49,875
It's all right! It's all
right! It's all been approved!

1209
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:53,280
I ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1210
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:57,817
Hey, zap them with your siren,
man. Zap them with your siren!

1211
01:46:08,368 --> 01:46:10,302
There's mines over there and over there too.

1212
01:46:10,503 --> 01:46:13,597
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys bite you, I'll tell you.

1213
01:46:13,806 --> 01:46:16,969
That's a pretty one. Move
it right in toward me.

1214
01:46:17,644 --> 01:46:20,613
I'm an American! Yeah. An American civilian.

1215
01:46:20,813 --> 01:46:22,110
Hi, Yanks.

1216
01:46:22,315 --> 01:46:26,342
Hi. American. American
civilian. It's all right.

1217
01:46:26,553 --> 01:46:30,353
And you got the cigarettes and
that's what I've been dreaming about.

1218
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:32,081
Chef.

1219
01:46:32,292 --> 01:46:34,021
Who are you?

1220
01:46:34,227 --> 01:46:35,854
Who are you?

1221
01:46:39,332 --> 01:46:40,890
I'm a photojournalist.

1222
01:46:41,634 --> 01:46:43,761
I've covered the war since '64.

1223
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:47,167
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and Nam.

1224
01:46:50,176 --> 01:46:54,704
Baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.

1225
01:46:54,914 --> 01:46:56,176
Who are all these people?

1226
01:46:56,382 --> 01:46:59,749
Yeah, well, they think you've come...

1227
01:47:00,553 --> 01:47:03,545
...to take him away, and
I hope that isn't true.

1228
01:47:03,756 --> 01:47:04,882
Take who away?

1229
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,327
Him. Colonel Kurtz.

1230
01:47:10,663 --> 01:47:14,224
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1231
01:47:14,434 --> 01:47:17,961
Hell, man, out here, we're all his children.

1232
01:47:18,171 --> 01:47:21,766
Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1233
01:47:21,975 --> 01:47:26,139
Hey, man, you don't talk to the colonel.

1234
01:47:26,346 --> 01:47:28,109
Well, you listen to him.

1235
01:47:29,315 --> 01:47:31,476
The man's enlarged my mind.

1236
01:47:32,118 --> 01:47:35,417
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1237
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:38,352
I mean, sometimes he'll... Well,
you say hello to him, right?

1238
01:47:38,558 --> 01:47:41,322
And he'll just walk right by
you, and he won't even notice you.

1239
01:47:41,527 --> 01:47:42,789
And suddenly he'll grab you

1240
01:47:42,996 --> 01:47:44,987
and he'll throw you in
a corner and he'll say,

1241
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:47,257
"Do you know 'if' is the
middle word in 'life'?

1242
01:47:47,467 --> 01:47:49,992
If you keep your head when all about
are losing theirs and blaming you...

1243
01:47:50,203 --> 01:47:52,000
If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you... "

1244
01:47:52,205 --> 01:47:55,834
I can't... I'm a little man. I'm
a little man. He's a great man.

1245
01:47:56,042 --> 01:47:59,569
"I should have been a pair of ragged claws

1246
01:47:59,779 --> 01:48:01,804
scuttling across floors of silent seas. "

1247
01:48:02,015 --> 01:48:03,983
- I mean...
- Stay with the boat.

1248
01:48:04,183 --> 01:48:06,651
Don't go any... Don't go without me, okay?

1249
01:48:06,853 --> 01:48:09,083
I wanna get a picture.

1250
01:48:10,523 --> 01:48:14,084
He can be terrible, and he can be mean,

1251
01:48:14,293 --> 01:48:15,954
and he can be right.

1252
01:48:16,162 --> 01:48:18,130
He's fighting the war.

1253
01:48:18,331 --> 01:48:20,299
He's a great man.

1254
01:48:22,468 --> 01:48:24,095
I mean...

1255
01:48:27,073 --> 01:48:30,509
I wish I had words, you
know. I wish I had words.

1256
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:33,736
I could tell you something. The
other day he wanted to kill me.

1257
01:48:33,946 --> 01:48:34,970
Something like that.

1258
01:48:35,181 --> 01:48:36,671
Why'd he wanna kill you?

1259
01:48:36,883 --> 01:48:39,044
Because I took his picture.

1260
01:48:39,252 --> 01:48:42,312
He said, "If you take my picture again,

1261
01:48:42,922 --> 01:48:44,719
I'm gonna kill you. "

1262
01:48:45,358 --> 01:48:47,383
And he meant it.

1263
01:48:49,228 --> 01:48:53,597
So you just lay cool. Lay
cool, lay back, dig it.

1264
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,325
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1265
01:48:57,170 --> 01:49:00,469
But you don't judge the colonel.

1266
01:49:00,673 --> 01:49:03,540
You don't judge the colonel
like an ordinary man.

1267
01:49:09,449 --> 01:49:12,976
Okay, watch it, now. These
are Americans. Americans!

1268
01:49:13,186 --> 01:49:15,450
Feel the vibe of this place.

1269
01:49:15,655 --> 01:49:16,781
Let me take your picture.

1270
01:49:16,989 --> 01:49:18,854
Hey, could you hold...? Hey, hello? Hello?

1271
01:49:19,058 --> 01:49:20,958
Could you hold it for a minute?

1272
01:49:43,015 --> 01:49:44,744
Colby.

1273
01:50:00,566 --> 01:50:02,295
The heads.

1274
01:50:02,735 --> 01:50:04,635
You're looking at the heads.

1275
01:50:06,405 --> 01:50:08,669
Sometimes he goes too far, you know.

1276
01:50:08,875 --> 01:50:11,207
He's the first one to admit it.

1277
01:50:11,744 --> 01:50:14,645
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong.

1278
01:50:16,015 --> 01:50:18,745
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago.

1279
01:50:18,951 --> 01:50:21,511
If you could've heard him then. God.

1280
01:50:21,721 --> 01:50:25,054
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fucking A.

1281
01:50:26,993 --> 01:50:29,086
I just wanna talk to him.

1282
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:33,290
Well, man, he's gone away.

1283
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,796
He's gone away. He disappeared
in the jungle with his people.

1284
01:50:37,003 --> 01:50:40,029
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1285
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:42,935
He forgets himself with his people.

1286
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:45,775
He forgets himself.

1287
01:50:45,978 --> 01:50:47,138
Captain?

1288
01:50:47,346 --> 01:50:49,644
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.

1289
01:50:50,316 --> 01:50:52,045
- I think you...
- Okay, Chef.

1290
01:50:52,251 --> 01:50:54,116
We'll go back to the boat for a while.

1291
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,619
Yeah, stay with Lance.

1292
01:51:19,645 --> 01:51:22,671
This colonel guy, he's wacko, man.

1293
01:51:22,882 --> 01:51:25,407
He's worse than crazy. He's evil.

1294
01:51:25,618 --> 01:51:27,848
I mean, that's what the
man's got set up here, man.

1295
01:51:28,054 --> 01:51:29,783
It's fucking pagan idolatry. Look around you.

1296
01:51:31,994 --> 01:51:34,861
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1297
01:51:35,064 --> 01:51:38,329
Help? Fucking A, I'll help you. I'll
do anything to get out of this joint.

1298
01:51:38,534 --> 01:51:39,796
Good boy.

1299
01:51:40,002 --> 01:51:41,594
We could blow all them assholes away.

1300
01:51:41,804 --> 01:51:44,466
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1301
01:51:45,074 --> 01:51:50,671
Well, I ain't afraid of all them
fucking skulls and altars and shit.

1302
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:55,740
I used to think if I died in an evil place,

1303
01:51:55,951 --> 01:51:58,784
then my soul wouldn't be
able to make it to heaven.

1304
01:51:58,988 --> 01:52:03,084
But now, fuck.

1305
01:52:03,893 --> 01:52:06,987
I mean, I don't care where it
goes, as long as it ain't here.

1306
01:52:07,196 --> 01:52:09,687
So, what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck.

1307
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:11,560
- No, no.
- Get out of here.

1308
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:13,826
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1309
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:16,502
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,

1310
01:52:16,705 --> 01:52:18,172
check the place out

1311
01:52:18,374 --> 01:52:21,502
and see if I can find the colonel, okay?

1312
01:52:22,078 --> 01:52:23,841
Well, what do you want me to do?

1313
01:52:24,046 --> 01:52:28,415
- Damn it.
- Here. You take the radio.

1314
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:32,178
And if I don't get back by 2200 hours...

1315
01:52:34,356 --> 01:52:36,324
...you call in the air strike.

1316
01:52:38,327 --> 01:52:40,124
Air strike?

1317
01:52:41,597 --> 01:52:42,723
The code is "Almighty,"

1318
01:52:42,932 --> 01:52:46,663
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven- one-two.

1319
01:52:47,403 --> 01:52:49,166
It's all in there.

1320
01:52:50,005 --> 01:52:54,032
Zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1321
01:53:01,684 --> 01:53:05,711
<i>Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane,</i>

1322
01:53:09,258 --> 01:53:11,283
<i>The place was full of bodies,</i>

1323
01:53:11,494 --> 01:53:16,363
<i>North Vietnamese, Vietcong, Cambodians,</i>

1324
01:53:22,805 --> 01:53:26,764
<i>If I was still alive, it was
because he wanted me that way,</i>

1325
01:54:00,209 --> 01:54:03,610
<i>It smelled like slow death in there,</i>

1326
01:54:04,213 --> 01:54:08,309
<i>Malaria, nightmares,</i>

1327
01:54:10,286 --> 01:54:13,312
<i>This was the end of the river, all right,</i>

1328
01:54:26,569 --> 01:54:28,901
Where are you from, Willard?

1329
01:54:33,676 --> 01:54:36,144
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1330
01:54:41,217 --> 01:54:43,276
Were you born there?

1331
01:54:43,485 --> 01:54:45,350
Yes, sir.

1332
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:47,889
Whereabouts?

1333
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:50,024
Toledo, sir.

1334
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:58,623
How far are you from the river?

1335
01:55:04,773 --> 01:55:07,071
The Ohio River, sir?

1336
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:11,309
About 200 miles.

1337
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:22,154
I went down that river once when I was a kid.

1338
01:55:26,528 --> 01:55:29,497
There's a place in the
river... I can't remember.

1339
01:55:29,698 --> 01:55:34,795
Must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1340
01:55:35,004 --> 01:55:37,632
It's all wild and overgrown now.

1341
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,502
But for about five miles

1342
01:55:40,709 --> 01:55:44,839
you'd think that heaven
just fell on the earth

1343
01:55:45,581 --> 01:55:48,607
in the form of gardenias.

1344
01:56:03,932 --> 01:56:05,923
Have you ever considered...

1345
01:56:07,636 --> 01:56:09,831
...any real freedoms?

1346
01:56:14,777 --> 01:56:18,713
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1347
01:56:21,216 --> 01:56:24,049
Even the opinions of yourself?

1348
01:56:39,335 --> 01:56:43,772
Did they say why... Willard?

1349
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:50,803
Why they want to terminate my command?

1350
01:57:05,494 --> 01:57:09,055
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1351
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,127
It's no longer classified...

1352
01:57:14,937 --> 01:57:16,461
...is it?

1353
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:24,702
What did they tell you?

1354
01:57:27,216 --> 01:57:31,312
They told me that you had gone...

1355
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:34,518
...totally insane...

1356
01:57:36,592 --> 01:57:43,054
...and that your methods were unsound.

1357
01:57:46,702 --> 01:57:49,364
Are my methods unsound?

1358
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:58,942
I don't see any method...

1359
01:58:00,082 --> 01:58:02,050
...at all, sir.

1360
01:58:07,890 --> 01:58:12,657
I expected someone like you.

1361
01:58:14,863 --> 01:58:16,990
What did you expect?

1362
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,474
Are you an assassin?

1363
01:58:31,046 --> 01:58:32,980
I'm a soldier.

1364
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:37,884
You're neither.

1365
01:58:39,655 --> 01:58:45,560
You're an errand boy
sent by grocery clerks...

1366
01:58:48,897 --> 01:58:51,092
...to collect the bill.

1367
01:59:34,676 --> 01:59:36,667
Why, huh?

1368
01:59:36,879 --> 01:59:41,407
Why would a nice guy like
you wanna kill a genius?

1369
01:59:47,322 --> 01:59:49,051
Feeling pretty good, huh?

1370
01:59:49,758 --> 01:59:51,248
Why?

1371
01:59:52,728 --> 01:59:54,161
Do you know?

1372
01:59:55,063 --> 01:59:57,156
Do you know that the man...?

1373
02:00:00,435 --> 02:00:03,268
The man really likes you?

1374
02:00:05,841 --> 02:00:08,366
He likes you. He really likes you.

1375
02:00:10,345 --> 02:00:13,109
But he's got something in mind for you.

1376
02:00:13,315 --> 02:00:14,748
Aren't you curious about that?

1377
02:00:15,551 --> 02:00:17,542
I'm curious.

1378
02:00:17,753 --> 02:00:20,153
I'm very curious.

1379
02:00:20,355 --> 02:00:21,982
Are you curious?

1380
02:00:24,393 --> 02:00:27,089
There's something happening out here, man.

1381
02:00:30,666 --> 02:00:33,567
You know something, man. I know
something that you don't know.

1382
02:00:33,769 --> 02:00:35,202
That's right, jack.

1383
02:00:35,404 --> 02:00:38,862
The man is clear in his mind,

1384
02:00:39,074 --> 02:00:41,269
but his soul is mad.

1385
02:00:42,744 --> 02:00:44,211
Oh, yeah.

1386
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:46,943
He's dying, I think.

1387
02:00:47,149 --> 02:00:50,209
He hates all this. He hates it.

1388
02:00:50,419 --> 02:00:54,321
But the man's...

1389
02:00:57,626 --> 02:01:00,789
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

1390
02:01:01,997 --> 02:01:03,965
And a voice...

1391
02:01:05,033 --> 02:01:06,796
A voice.

1392
02:01:09,037 --> 02:01:11,835
He likes you because you're still alive.

1393
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,598
He's got plans for you.

1394
02:01:13,809 --> 02:01:19,247
No, no. I'm not gonna help
you. You're gonna help him, man.

1395
02:01:19,448 --> 02:01:20,881
You're gonna help him.

1396
02:01:21,083 --> 02:01:23,677
I mean, what are they gonna
say, man, when he's gone, huh?

1397
02:01:23,885 --> 02:01:28,254
Because he dies when it dies,
man. When it dies, he dies.

1398
02:01:28,457 --> 02:01:32,188
What are they gonna say about him?
They gonna say he was a kind man?

1399
02:01:32,394 --> 02:01:36,057
He was a wise man? He
had plans? He had wisdom?

1400
02:01:36,264 --> 02:01:37,925
Bullshit, man.

1401
02:01:38,133 --> 02:01:41,000
Am I gonna be the one that's
gonna set them straight?

1402
02:01:41,203 --> 02:01:43,228
Look at me. Wrong!

1403
02:01:46,108 --> 02:01:47,769
You.

1404
02:01:52,481 --> 02:01:55,109
<i>Almost eight hours,</i>

1405
02:01:59,488 --> 02:02:01,183
<i>I'm asleep,</i>

1406
02:02:02,457 --> 02:02:06,291
<i>I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat,</i>

1407
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,497
Fuck.

1408
02:02:22,611 --> 02:02:24,909
<i>Has it been eight hours?</i>

1409
02:02:27,315 --> 02:02:29,374
Hello. Almighty. Almighty.

1410
02:02:29,584 --> 02:02:34,487
This is PBR Street Gang. Radio check. Over.

1411
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:38,148
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by, Over,</i>

1412
02:03:58,757 --> 02:04:00,281
Oh, shit!

1413
02:04:10,001 --> 02:04:13,402
Oh, Christ.

1414
02:06:39,622 --> 02:06:42,386
<i>We are the hollow men</i>

1415
02:06:42,592 --> 02:06:44,423
<i>We are the stuffed men</i>

1416
02:06:44,627 --> 02:06:48,996
<i>Leaning together Headpiece filled with straw,</i>

1417
02:06:49,198 --> 02:06:51,325
<i>Alas!</i>

1418
02:06:51,634 --> 02:06:53,898
<i>Our dried voices, when We whisper together</i>

1419
02:06:54,103 --> 02:06:55,661
<i>Are quiet and meaningless</i>

1420
02:06:55,872 --> 02:06:58,602
<i>As wind in dry grass</i>

1421
02:06:58,808 --> 02:07:01,299
<i>- Or rats' feet over broken glass
- Oh, he's out there.</i>

1422
02:07:01,511 --> 02:07:02,978
<i>In our dry cellar</i>

1423
02:07:03,179 --> 02:07:04,441
He's really out there.

1424
02:07:04,647 --> 02:07:07,241
<i>Shape without form,</i>

1425
02:07:07,950 --> 02:07:09,577
<i>Shade without color,</i>

1426
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:12,750
<i>Paralyzed force,</i>

1427
02:07:13,589 --> 02:07:15,250
<i>Gesture without motion,</i>

1428
02:07:15,458 --> 02:07:17,858
Do you know what the man's saying?

1429
02:07:18,261 --> 02:07:19,751
<i>- Do you?
- Those who have crossed...</i>

1430
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:23,363
This is dialectics. It's
very simple dialectics.

1431
02:07:23,566 --> 02:07:27,093
One through nine. No maybes,
no supposes, no fractions.

1432
02:07:27,303 --> 02:07:29,863
You can't travel in space.
You can't go out into space,

1433
02:07:30,072 --> 02:07:32,597
you know, without, like,
you know, with fractions.

1434
02:07:32,808 --> 02:07:35,072
What you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three- eighths?

1435
02:07:35,278 --> 02:07:37,405
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1436
02:07:37,613 --> 02:07:39,376
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1437
02:07:39,582 --> 02:07:41,573
Dialectic logic is
there's only love and hate.

1438
02:07:41,784 --> 02:07:43,979
You either love somebody or you hate them.

1439
02:07:44,587 --> 02:07:46,418
Mutt!

1440
02:07:47,757 --> 02:07:49,349
You mutt.

1441
02:07:49,559 --> 02:07:52,722
This is the way the fucking world ends.

1442
02:07:52,929 --> 02:07:55,295
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man.

1443
02:07:55,498 --> 02:07:57,261
Not with a bang. A whimper.

1444
02:07:57,466 --> 02:08:01,163
And with a whimper, I'm
fucking splitting, jack.

1445
02:08:29,765 --> 02:08:32,393
<i>On the river, I thought that
the minute I looked at him</i>

1446
02:08:32,602 --> 02:08:34,467
<i>I'd know what to do,</i>

1447
02:08:35,338 --> 02:08:37,670
<i>But it didn't happen,</i>

1448
02:08:38,541 --> 02:08:40,975
<i>I was in there with him for days</i>

1449
02:08:41,177 --> 02:08:42,701
<i>not under guard,</i>

1450
02:08:42,912 --> 02:08:45,039
<i>I was free,</i>

1451
02:08:45,248 --> 02:08:48,308
<i>But he knew I wasn't going anywhere,</i>

1452
02:08:48,517 --> 02:08:52,214
<i>He knew more about what I
was going to do than I did,</i>

1453
02:08:59,095 --> 02:09:03,327
<i>If the generals back in Nha
Trang could see what I saw,</i>

1454
02:09:03,532 --> 02:09:06,365
<i>would they still want me to kill him?</i>

1455
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:10,004
<i>More than ever, probably,</i>

1456
02:09:10,573 --> 02:09:13,303
<i>And what would his people back
home want if they ever learned</i>

1457
02:09:13,509 --> 02:09:16,740
<i>just how far from them he'd really gone?</i>

1458
02:09:18,281 --> 02:09:19,509
<i>He broke from them</i>

1459
02:09:20,283 --> 02:09:23,047
<i>and then he broke from himself,</i>

1460
02:09:23,352 --> 02:09:26,412
<i>I'd never seen a man so broken up</i>

1461
02:09:26,622 --> 02:09:28,317
<i>and ripped apart,</i>

1462
02:09:28,524 --> 02:09:30,890
I've seen the horrors.

1463
02:09:31,394 --> 02:09:33,862
Horrors that you've seen.

1464
02:09:35,331 --> 02:09:37,424
But you have no right to call me a murderer.

1465
02:09:37,633 --> 02:09:40,158
You have a right to kill me.

1466
02:09:40,703 --> 02:09:44,195
You have a right to do that.

1467
02:09:44,807 --> 02:09:47,833
But you have no right to judge me.

1468
02:09:53,816 --> 02:09:56,250
It's impossible for words...

1469
02:09:57,720 --> 02:10:00,154
...to describe...

1470
02:10:01,257 --> 02:10:05,387
...what is necessary...

1471
02:10:06,595 --> 02:10:08,654
...to those...

1472
02:10:09,098 --> 02:10:11,589
...who do not know...

1473
02:10:11,801 --> 02:10:15,862
...what horror means.

1474
02:10:16,972 --> 02:10:18,872
Horror.

1475
02:10:21,277 --> 02:10:24,940
Horror has a face.

1476
02:10:26,282 --> 02:10:29,376
And you must make a friend of horror.

1477
02:10:29,885 --> 02:10:33,616
Horror and moral terror

1478
02:10:33,823 --> 02:10:35,188
are your friends.

1479
02:10:35,391 --> 02:10:37,621
If they are not,

1480
02:10:37,827 --> 02:10:41,388
then they are enemies to be feared.

1481
02:10:41,731 --> 02:10:44,097
They are truly enemies.

1482
02:10:48,671 --> 02:10:52,607
I remember when I was with Special Forces.

1483
02:10:56,045 --> 02:11:00,675
Seems a thousand centuries ago.

1484
02:11:03,419 --> 02:11:06,582
We went into a camp to inoculate...

1485
02:11:08,424 --> 02:11:10,449
...some children.

1486
02:11:13,963 --> 02:11:16,397
We'd left the camp

1487
02:11:16,766 --> 02:11:20,759
after we had inoculated
the children for polio.

1488
02:11:21,837 --> 02:11:24,362
And this old man came running
after us and he was crying.

1489
02:11:24,573 --> 02:11:26,598
He couldn't see.

1490
02:11:28,911 --> 02:11:31,004
We went back there

1491
02:11:31,213 --> 02:11:34,808
and they had come and hacked off

1492
02:11:35,017 --> 02:11:37,884
every inoculated arm.

1493
02:11:39,221 --> 02:11:41,416
There they were in a pile.

1494
02:11:41,624 --> 02:11:43,717
A pile of...

1495
02:11:45,027 --> 02:11:47,427
...little arms.

1496
02:11:48,264 --> 02:11:51,859
And I remember...

1497
02:11:52,535 --> 02:11:58,440
I... I... I cried. I wept like...

1498
02:11:59,208 --> 02:12:02,473
...some grandmother.

1499
02:12:04,146 --> 02:12:08,708
I wanted to tear my teeth out. I
didn't know what I wanted to do.

1500
02:12:09,218 --> 02:12:12,244
And I wanna remember it.
I never wanna forget it.

1501
02:12:12,455 --> 02:12:15,015
I never wanna forget.

1502
02:12:15,825 --> 02:12:18,453
And then I realized,

1503
02:12:18,994 --> 02:12:20,757
like I was shot...

1504
02:12:20,963 --> 02:12:24,160
Like I was shot with a diamond...

1505
02:12:24,433 --> 02:12:28,631
A diamond bullet right through my forehead.

1506
02:12:29,605 --> 02:12:33,405
And I thought, "My God, the genius of that.

1507
02:12:33,609 --> 02:12:36,009
The genius.

1508
02:12:36,212 --> 02:12:39,670
The will to do that.

1509
02:12:40,349 --> 02:12:46,185
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure. "

1510
02:12:47,389 --> 02:12:48,913
Then I realized,

1511
02:12:49,124 --> 02:12:52,924
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

1512
02:12:53,128 --> 02:12:55,596
These were not monsters. These were men,

1513
02:12:55,798 --> 02:12:57,629
trained cadres.

1514
02:12:58,434 --> 02:13:00,925
These men who fought with their hearts,

1515
02:13:01,136 --> 02:13:03,070
who have families, who have children,

1516
02:13:03,272 --> 02:13:05,172
who are filled with love.

1517
02:13:05,374 --> 02:13:08,400
That they had the strength...

1518
02:13:08,777 --> 02:13:11,371
The strength...

1519
02:13:14,316 --> 02:13:16,181
...to do that.

1520
02:13:16,385 --> 02:13:21,516
If I had ten divisions of those men,

1521
02:13:21,724 --> 02:13:25,785
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1522
02:13:26,529 --> 02:13:28,929
You have to have men...

1523
02:13:29,999 --> 02:13:32,194
...who are moral...

1524
02:13:33,202 --> 02:13:37,764
...and at the same time who are able to...

1525
02:13:38,807 --> 02:13:41,537
...utilize their...

1526
02:13:43,045 --> 02:13:46,344
...primordial instincts to kill...

1527
02:13:47,016 --> 02:13:50,349
...without feeling, without passion...

1528
02:13:51,186 --> 02:13:54,781
...without judgment. Without judgment.

1529
02:13:59,094 --> 02:14:02,791
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

1530
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:24,276
I worry that my son

1531
02:14:24,486 --> 02:14:29,423
might not understand what I've tried to be.

1532
02:14:30,793 --> 02:14:36,060
And if I were to be killed, Willard,

1533
02:14:37,066 --> 02:14:39,933
I would want someone to go to my home

1534
02:14:40,135 --> 02:14:43,832
and tell my son everything.

1535
02:14:45,741 --> 02:14:49,700
<i>Everything I did, Everything you saw,</i>

1536
02:14:50,346 --> 02:14:53,747
<i>Because there's nothing that I detest more</i>

1537
02:14:53,949 --> 02:14:57,316
<i>than the stench of lies,</i>

1538
02:14:59,088 --> 02:15:02,489
<i>And if you understand me, Willard, you...</i>

1539
02:15:04,093 --> 02:15:06,891
<i>You will do this for me,</i>

1540
02:16:12,561 --> 02:16:14,961
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty, Over,</i>

1541
02:16:16,532 --> 02:16:19,990
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by, Over,</i>

1542
02:16:21,904 --> 02:16:26,136
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty
standing by, How do you copy?</i>

1543
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:33,910
<i>They were gonna make me a major for this,</i>

1544
02:16:34,717 --> 02:16:38,016
<i>and I wasn't even in
their fucking Army anymore,</i>

1545
02:16:40,022 --> 02:16:42,957
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it,</i>

1546
02:16:43,592 --> 02:16:46,026
<i>Him most of all,</i>

1547
02:16:46,695 --> 02:16:48,890
<i>I felt like he was up there</i>

1548
02:16:49,098 --> 02:16:52,397
<i>waiting for me to take the pain away,</i>

1549
02:16:54,403 --> 02:16:56,963
<i>He just wanted to go out like a soldier,</i>

1550
02:16:57,606 --> 02:16:59,665
<i>standing up,</i>

1551
02:16:59,875 --> 02:17:04,574
<i>Not like some poor,
wasted, rag-assed renegade,</i>

1552
02:17:07,282 --> 02:17:10,410
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead,</i>

1553
02:17:10,619 --> 02:17:13,747
<i>And that's who he really
took his orders from anyway,</i>

1554
02:18:30,532 --> 02:18:33,365
"We train young men to drop fire on people,

1555
02:18:34,469 --> 02:18:36,437
but their commanders

1556
02:18:37,172 --> 02:18:40,539
<i>won't allow them to write 'fuck'</i>

1557
02:18:40,742 --> 02:18:41,766
<i>on their airplane,</i>

1558
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:43,705
because...

1559
02:18:43,912 --> 02:18:46,176
...it's obscene. "

1560
02:20:08,397 --> 02:20:10,763
The horror.

1561
02:20:14,136 --> 02:20:15,467
The horror.

1562
02:25:38,159 --> 02:25:40,218
<i>Calling PBR Street Gang,</i>

1563
02:25:41,162 --> 02:25:44,256
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty, Do you read me? Over,</i>

1564
02:25:45,967 --> 02:25:48,026
<i>PBR Street Gang?</i>

1565
02:25:48,236 --> 02:25:51,433
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty...</i>

1566
02:26:28,677 --> 02:26:31,009
<i>The horror,</i>

1567
02:26:34,382 --> 02:26:36,748
<i>The horror,</i>
