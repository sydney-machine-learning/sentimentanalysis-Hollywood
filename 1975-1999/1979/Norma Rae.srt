00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:30,949
<i>Ain't no miracle bein' born</i>

00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:37,960
<i>People doin' it every day</i>

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:44,216
<i>Ain't no miracle growin' up</i>

4
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:49,972
<i>People just grow that way</i>

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,974
<i>So it goes like it goes</i>

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,727
<i>Like the river flows</i>

7
00:00:55,806 --> 00:01:01,484
<i>And time, it rolls right on</i>

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,486
<i>And maybe what's good</i>

9
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,490
<i>Gets a little bit better</i>

10
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:15,498
<i>And maybe what's bad gets gone</i>

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,506
<i>Bless the child of a workin' man</i>

12
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:33,561
<i>She knows too soon who she is</i>

13
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:39,521
<i>And bless the hands of a workin' man</i>

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,198
<i>He knows his soul is his</i>

15
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,025

00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,112

17
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:56,291
<i>And time, it rolls right on</i>

18
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,290
<i>And maybe what's good</i>

19
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,466
<i>Gets a little bit better</i>

20
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,889
<i>And maybe what's bad gets gone</i>

21
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,937
<i>Yeah, it goes like it goes</i>

22
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,815
<i>Like the river flows</i>

23
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:30,197
<i>And time keeps rollin' on</i>

24
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,405
<i>And maybe what's good</i>

25
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:40,416
<i>Gets a little bit better</i>

26
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:46,342
<i>And maybe what's bad</i>

27
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:53,391
<i>Gets gone</i>

28
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,809
That's all you're eating
for lunch? An apple?

29
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,431
I'm dieting.

30
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,847
I got to keep my strength up.

31
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,025
I put these preserves up myself.

32
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,855
Sunday, Russell and I put up
over 60 quarts of peaches.

33
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,738
What did you do over
the weekend, Norma?

34
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,740
I soaked my feet.

35
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,911
I saw you in town Sunday.

36
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,120
Your friend drives
a mighty big car.

37
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:51,130
If you'd looked on the motel
register, you'd seen my name, too.

38
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,631
It's none of my business.

39
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,760
Mama, you haven't opened
up your sack yet.

40
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,563
Mama, aren't you hungry?

41
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,061
Mama?

42
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,317
Mama, you feeling all right?

43
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,570
Mama?

44
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,073
Mama, can you hear me?

45
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,278
Mama?

46
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,906
Mama!

47
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,957
Mama, come on. Come on.

48
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,849
She didn't hear one word I said!

49
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,552
You know that happens.

50
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,809
Well, it doesn't happen to my mama!

51
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,890
It'll pass off.
It's just temporary.

52
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,942
That makes it OK!

53
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,521
She's only deaf all day!

54
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,026
She can get another job.

55
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,030
What other job in this town?

56
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,578
I'll give her a note.

57
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,371
They'll send her home.

58
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,574
Come on, Mama.

59
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,955
They don't care anything about you.

60
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,394
You all right out there?

61
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,812
I'm fine.

62
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,100
You're going to get all bitten up.

63
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,061
I'll be in. Just a minute.

64
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,410
Well...

65
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,450
I'm going to let this pot soak.

66
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,411
There's one soaking from breakfast.

67
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,416
Now it's got company.

68
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,051
Hey, you kids.

69
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,924
10 more minutes of this junk,
then do your homework.

70
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,972
I did it.

71
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,809
Unsatisfactory in
lettering and reading,

72
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,603
and your numbers aren't too good.

73
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,056
You haven't done much homework.

74
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,813
- Shh!
- Shush! I'll shush you.

75
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,534
What are you getting fixed up for?

76
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,460
I'm going into town.

77
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,663
What do you need in town?

78
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,168
Things.

79
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,545
OK. I'll drive you in.

80
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,169
You got Bonanza on next.

81
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,223
I'll miss that. It's
the same every week.

82
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,968
I'm going to J.C. Penney's,

83
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,807
buy myself some panties and a white
cotton brassiere, size 32-B.

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,938
If you want to sit outside
the dressing room

85
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,190
and have the ladies look
at you, then come on.

86
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,771
No, ma'am.

87
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,404
You coming straight back?

88
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,826
No.

89
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,153
I'm going to the drugstore,

90
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,491
buy myself some Kotex pads
and a <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine.

91
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,577
Mm-hmm. Then you coming home?

92
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,790
Yeah. I'll be so tired
from all the excitement,

93
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,795
I'll be coming home.

94
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,474
Hi.

95
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
Mr. Witchard?

96
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,688
That's right. Vernon Witchard.

97
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,855
Who are you?

98
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,604
My name is Reuben Warshovsky.

99
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,436
Warshovsky. What kind
of name is that?

100
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,529
The kind you have to spell for
telephone operators and headwaiters.

101
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,575
What do you want?

102
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,279
I'd like a room with a mill family.

103
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,663
What for? We got a hotel,
a motel with 36 rooms.

104
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:58,005
I want to get to know
some mill hands.

105
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,706
Why is that?

106
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,756
I'll tell you.

107
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,086
I just got into town
about an hour ago.

108
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,763
Hi. How are you?

109
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:12,561
Right away, the police chief
was saying, "Who are you?"

110
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,933
So I told him I'm a
labor organizer.

111
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,399
I've come to put a union in
the OP. Henley Textile Mill.

112
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,321
He said, "The hell you are, boy!"

113
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,739
He was dead right.

114
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,820
You people are Communists,
agitators, crooks, or Jews,

115
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,496
or all four rolled together.

116
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,291
You make folks lose their jobs,

117
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,788
get their heads busted...

118
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,962
Excuse me, sir.

119
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,790
How much do you make an hour?

120
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,797
I make $1.33 a frame.

121
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,049
When was your last
cost-of-living raise?

122
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,505
I haven't had that.

123
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,262
With today's inflation,

124
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,935
that makes you a schlemiel.

125
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,438
You calling me some kind of name?

126
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,858
You're underpaid.
You're overworked.

127
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,609
They're shafting you right
up to your tonsils.

128
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,110
You need me, sir.

129
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,284
If you run real fast,

130
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,829
you'll get to your car
before my dog bites you.

131
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,327
We ain't even got a dog.

132
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,704
You don't need one.

133
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,021
Hey. How you doing?

134
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,314
Do you have any vacancies?

135
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,313
Yes.

136
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,861
Hi.

137
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,814
Hey.

138
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,484
Friendly little town you got here.

139
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,819
So far I've been told

140
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,451
to shove off, get off, and go away.

141
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,917
Oh, it's OK.

142
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,296
Make sure they spray
your room for roaches.

143
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,669
You got roaches down here?

144
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,001
I'm very familiar with roaches.

145
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,467
Do you have a room with a view?

146
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,344
You got the back alley
or the parking lot.

147
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,016
Which?

148
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,810
Back alley or parking lot?

149
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,765
Give him 31, Alston.

150
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,770
Can't hear the drunks
from in there.

151
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,034
I'll be back this way next
Wednesday after dinner.

152
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,208
I'm having dinner
with my wife's folks.

153
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,258
Tonight was the last time, George.

154
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,176
You don't say, Norma Rae.

155
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,721
Well, now, isn't that
a surprising turn?

156
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,391
No. Been coming on for some time.

157
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,969
You know something funny?

158
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,726
I didn't notice it.

159
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,648
Didn't you get your steak dinner

160
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,852
and your box of pralines?

161
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,652
Didn't you come three times in
a row in that bed over there?

162
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,823
I wasn't counting.

163
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,492
Ha ha ha!

164
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,444
Well, well, well.

165
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:22,041
Looks like I don't know what it
takes to satisfy you these days.

166
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,416
It just doesn't sit well
with me anymore, George.

167
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,466
You got your wife, your
two kids in high school.

168
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,384
There's a lot of gossip.

169
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,712
I got my two kids.

170
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,180
I don't know.

171
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,978
It just doesn't make me feel good.

172
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,395
You're here to make me feel good.

173
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,651
I'm not trotting down here anymore.

174
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,732
Why, you hick.

175
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,278
You got dirt under
your fingernails.

176
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,787
You pick your teeth
with a matchbook.

177
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,960
What the hell are you
good for, anyway?

178
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,122
You come outta that factory,
you wash under your armpits,

179
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,963
you come on down here and
spread your legs for a poke,

180
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,884
and you're dumping me?

181
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,477
I heard a hell of a thump.

182
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,976
That was me, getting
throwed across the room.

183
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,524
I have some ice for that.

184
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,529
Sit down. Please.

185
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,705
You look all shook up.

186
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,375
Here, put this on.

187
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:54,088
I thought everybody down
South was Ashley Wilkes.

188
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,296
You lie down with
dogs, you get fleas.

189
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,882
Does this look broken to you?

190
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,842
Go like this.

191
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,677
No, I don't think so.

192
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,229
Do you want aspirin?

193
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,772
No, thanks.

194
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,771
Band-Aid? Valium?

195
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,061
You're a whole drugstore.

196
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,566
I'm a mild hypochondriac.

197
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,613
Keep that on it.

198
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,782
Ohh.

199
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,748
Me and men.

200
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,536
I ought to learn to say
no right from the start.

201
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,508
But if it wasn't men, I don't
know what it would be.

202
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,097
You got a lot of books.

203
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,010
I'm terrified I'll wake up
in a motel room one morning

204
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,518
and have nothing to read
but the phone book.

205
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,520
She got big eyes.

206
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,187
Yeah, got a big brain, too.

207
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,359
What's her name?

208
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,277
Dorothy Finkelstein.

209
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,324
She's a hotshot labor
lawyer out of Harvard.

210
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,412
She must be your girlfriend if
you haul her picture around.

211
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,248
We sleep together
on Sunday mornings

212
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,049
and read <i>The New York Times.</i>

213
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,220
I guess that makes
her my girlfriend.

214
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,092
Hey.

215
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,518
- I'm Norma Rae Wilson.
- Reuben Warshovsky.

216
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,894
Nice meeting you.

217
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,227
My pleasure. Keep
that on your nose.

218
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:39,439
I'm sorry about my daddy.
He got a short fuse.

219
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,071
My credentials keep me
out of a lot of places.

220
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,369
But once in a while,

221
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,119
someone puts me in
their best bedroom

222
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,450
and treats me like a cousin.

223
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,745
- Ha ha ha!
- What?

224
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,707
That sure as heck
wouldn't be my daddy!

225
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,836
You a Jew?

226
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,796
I beg your pardon?

227
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,474
Are you a Jew?

228
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,017
Born and bred.

229
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,475
I never met a Jew before.

230
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,523
How you doing?

231
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,111
I heard you all had horns.

232
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,657
Circumcised, yes. Horns, no.

233
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,160
Well, as far as I can see,

234
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,495
you don't look any different
from the rest of us.

235
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,296
Well, we are.

236
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,009
Well, what makes you different?

237
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,427
History.

238
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,930
Oh.

239
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,308
You got it now?

240
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,311
Hey, it looks better.

241
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,309
I think it stopped.

242
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,853
Thanks for the ice.

243
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,108
Any time.

244
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,406
Christ, I hope not.

245
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,741
Good morning.

246
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,950
I'm from the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

247
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,042
Read this when you have a
chance, on your break.

248
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,870
Thank you. Good morning.

249
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,374
Read this when you
have a chance, please.

250
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,458
Thank you.

251
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,215
Here you go.

252
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,467
Good morning.

253
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,424
Read this when you have a chance.

254
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,602
I'm from the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

255
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,774
Read this when you have a chance.

256
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,021
Read this on your break.

257
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,064
Want to read this
when you can, please?

258
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,899
I'm from the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

259
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,328
You want to read this
when you have a chance?

260
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,581
Good morning.

261
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,787
You want to read this when
you get home, please?

262
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,624
I'm with the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

263
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,176
Read this on your break.

264
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,421
Good morning!

265
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,006
How's your nose?

266
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,091
Read that on your break.

267
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,683
There's too many big words.

268
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,190
If I don't understand it, they
ain't gonna understand it.

269
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,817
That fellow your friend, Norma?

270
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,439
He's getting to be.

271
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,274
- Better hurry. You'll be late.
- I don't care if I get there tomorrow.

272
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,613
If you have questions,

273
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,491
I'm at the Golden
Cherry Motel, room 31.

274
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,954
Don't be late for work, now, folks.

275
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,001
Good morning.

276
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,382
The lady wants to go to work.

277
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,381
I'll catch you later.

278
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,722
One of you guys shows up
about every four years,

279
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,395
about the same time
we get the locusts.

280
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,606
What's your name?

281
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,235
My name's Jimmy Jerome Davis.

282
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,611
We got six boss men
in civil contempt.

283
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,691
Would you care to make it seven?

284
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,496
Why, hell, we plaster the
toilets with them things.

285
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,787
Want to read this on your break?

286
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,498
Asshole.

287
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,346
I already told him I wouldn't go
out to dinner. What's he want now?

288
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,103
Maybe he wants to make
it breakfast, Norma Rae.

289
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,708
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

290
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,083
You got the biggest
mouth in this mill.

291
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,041
"Give us a longer break,
more smoking time.

292
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,798
"Give us a Kotex pad machine."

293
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,258
Do it, and I'll shut up.

294
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:20,390
The only way to close that
mouth is to promote you.

295
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,938
You're going up in
the world, honey.

296
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,812
Yeah? How far for how much?

297
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,939
Well, we're going to put
you on spot-checking.

298
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,152
Well, hell, it sure ain't
gonna make me any friends.

299
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,197
It'll make you another
$1.50 an hour.

300
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,558
How am I doing, little girl?

301
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,394
You doin' good, Daddy.

302
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,273
I think you better try to
speed it up, if you can.

303
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,199
I'm going as fast as I can.

304
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,860
Yeah.

305
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,322
Well, they're watching me.

306
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,532
They're watching you.

307
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,686
Well, what, you're sore at me?

308
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,360
You shouldn't push your own daddy.

309
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,688
I need the money for my kids.

310
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,490
Well, I don't need it from my kid.

311
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,965
Millie! Craig!

312
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,964
What are you doing in
Grandma's marigolds?

313
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,465
Get up!

314
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,671
I don't want to.

315
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,098
You do it anyway!

316
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,641
You're filthy!

317
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,269
I asked you to watch him.

318
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,438
Criminy! I cleaned you up once!

319
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,734
Come on! Right in here now.

320
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,066
That's it.

321
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,073
Come on, Steve! Come on, Steve!

322
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,620
Come on!

323
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,210
All right! They made it!

324
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,465
He's got an arm on him!

325
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,841
Woo!

326
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,719
Hey, you want something?

327
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,684
Get me a hot dog, lots of relish.

328
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,312
- Woo!
- All right!

329
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,770
Can I have a hot dog, please?

330
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,601
OK.

331
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,402
Thank you.

332
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,572
Hi, Wilma. Can I have two dogs?

333
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,821
OK. Just a minute.

334
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,868
Hi. How you doing?

335
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,661
You enjoying the game?

336
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,707
Oh, yeah. I love the shortstop.

337
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,540
Scouts are looking at him.

338
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,125
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

339
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,963
This isn't a hot dog.

340
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,718
What's in this thing?

341
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,767
Lots of things you don't
want to know about.

342
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,764
Excuse me a minute.

343
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,570
Hello, Norma.

344
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,152
Hey, Ellis.

345
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,984
You're looking fine.

346
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,536
I'm always fine. I'm a horse.

347
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,074
You changed your hair.

348
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,451
It grew.

349
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,038
How's Craig?

350
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,673
He lost a tooth.

351
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,339
It wouldn't hurt if you came by

352
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,638
to see him every now and then.

353
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,512
I don't believe
I can do that, Norma.

354
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,266
Well, suit yourself.
You always have.

355
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,114
Give me a Coke.

356
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,315
You want a Coke?

357
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,400
Yeah.

358
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,951
Two, please.

359
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,406
Here, this is for hers.

360
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,614
All right.

361
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,450
Keep the change.

362
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,623
Here you go.

363
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,006
I climbed into the
backseat of his Cadillac

364
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,049
one rainy night six years ago,

365
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,672
stuck my feet out the back window,

366
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:48,677
and got little Craig off
that Southern gentleman.

367
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,136
He ain't done nothin'
worthwhile since.

368
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,141
Did you get married?

369
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,850
He didn't bother. I didn't bother.

370
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,736
My first affair, as I recollect it,

371
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,906
was with my Hungarian
piano teacher.

372
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,233
I was playing Smetana.

373
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,569
She put her head in my lap.

374
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,949
I played the hell out of that.

375
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,497
Next thing I knew, we
were in her bedroom.

376
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,955
Her husband came home and found us.

377
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,166
The poor guy burst into tears.

378
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:28,596
I said, "Hey, man, I'm sorry,"

379
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,174
and we all went into the kitchen
and had a glass of tea.

380
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,940
I'm always hassling
with some other guy.

381
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,108
That's how it seems.

382
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,686
What do you think of me, I wonder.

383
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,866
I think you're too smart for
what's happening to you.

384
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,885
I'm over here now.

385
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,302
I got the jump on you!

386
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,310
Come on, lady. Come on,
come on, come on!

387
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,737
Mark me down. Mark me down.

388
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,818
I'm over here now, lady!

389
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,944
Come on!

390
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,821
I'm over here.

391
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,162
Hey. lady!

392
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,410
What you waiting for, girl?

393
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,912
I'm over here now.

394
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,496
Come on, lady.

395
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,548
I'm over here now.

396
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,340
Come on, lady. Come on.

397
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,511
You damn fool!

398
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,682
You'll get us both
to lose our jobs!

399
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,274
I'll get it.

400
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,282
Hey.

401
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,206
I won't trouble you.

402
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,330
I just came to apologize.

403
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,628
I know I could have lost
you your job today.

404
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,800
You sure went crazy on me.

405
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,343
I know.

406
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,180
I got handed divorce
papers this morning.

407
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,974
I guess I went off my head.

408
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,944
Well,

409
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,907
things can get to you.

410
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,578
Would you come and
have a drink with me?

411
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:05,082
Just to make up for the ruckus.

412
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,756
I'm Sonny Webster.

413
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,046
You used to come in
my mama's bakery.

414
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,263
Sonny Webster?

415
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,600
Sonny Webster! I remember you.

416
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,311
You stood behind the cash register
and gave everybody the wrong change.

417
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,940
I never was too good at math.

418
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,646
You're telling me!

419
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,278
Sonny Webster! Golly!

420
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,327
How about that drink?

421
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,914
OK.

422
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,867
Just wait one minute.

423
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,216
I heard a man's voice.

424
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,548
I'm going out with him.

425
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,300
Where did you meet him?

426
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,256
Just now, on the front porch.

427
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,177
You're not going out.

428
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,729
Daddy, I'm over 21.

429
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,148
Let me say some names to you.

430
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,944
Buddy Wilson, Ellis Harper,
George Benson, a U.S. sailor.

431
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:18,321
None of which is looking after
you, as far as I can see.

432
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,448
It's my roof, my food.

433
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,451
You're always trying
to keep men off me.

434
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:28,376
Be grateful for your daddy's love.

435
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,705
You're loving me to death.

436
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,756
<i>My needs are very much alive</i>

437
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,220
<i>Is it OK if I stop by</i>

438
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,646
<i>It's all wrong, but it's all right</i>

439
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,108
<i>It's all wrong, but it's all right</i>

440
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,606
God darn, that lady can sing.

441
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,571
And her words are so true.

442
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,819
I like Elvis myself.

443
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:03,200
I wish I could make lots
of money by just wailing.

444
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,655
That don't necessarily
make them happy.

445
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,617
What does? What does? What does?

446
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,794
A man and a woman is
about your best chance.

447
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,090
Didn't you tell me you got a gun,

448
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:19,636
and you was gonna shoot your wife?

449
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,590
I was gonna burn them both down,

450
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:26,267
her and her boyfriend,

451
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,311
but I couldn't.

452
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:35,228
She was a real good person
when we went to school.

453
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,780
But then a change
had come over her.

454
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,818
It still really amazes me.

455
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,620
Listen.

456
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,538
I'm a lot different
from what I was.

457
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,541
I mean, you go through things.

458
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,173
Hey!

459
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,296
Hey!

460
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,469
New York! Hey, man!

461
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,546
Hey, buddy!

462
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,430
Come on over here!

463
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,883
We need anybody else?

464
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,092
The more the merrier.

465
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,643
Reuben!

466
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,516
Here you are with your papers!

467
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,724
Come on over.

468
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,856
Come on, Reuben.

469
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,608
Reuben, meet Sonny.

470
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,564
Sonny, this is Reuben
Warbershovsky.

471
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,150
Close! How are you?

472
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,110
Sit down! Take a load off.

473
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,538
What are you doing here?

474
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,705
I'm working.

475
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,408
Working?

476
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,243
This is a drinking place.

477
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,920
Can I pour you out one?

478
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,590
I'll just have some plain seltzer.

479
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,010
You're just drinking club soda?

480
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,885
You'll feel a whole lot better
than I will tomorrow morning.

481
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,474
Reuben's trying to put
a union in the mill.

482
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,897
But there ain't never been one.

483
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,270
Then maybe its time has come.

484
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,897
There better be more than one of you,
'cause there's more than one of them.

485
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,233
There will be.

486
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,570
Those big companies get
everything they want.

487
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,246
You getting tired of it?

488
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,998
Oh, when I do, I just
wash it down with a beer.

489
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,331
<i>We never really got
right down to talkin'</i>

490
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,382
Hey, you know what?

491
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,843
This song on the jukebox

492
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,426
was on the radio the
night they called me up

493
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,029
and told me my husband
had been killed

494
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,312
in a fight in a beer joint.

495
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,857
I knew Buddy Wilson in high school.

496
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,901
You did?

497
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,032
Yeah. Goll!

498
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,528
He was drunk,
and he got in a fight,

499
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,080
and he broke a beer bottle.

500
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:56,080
And then this other guy,
he had a broken beer bottle, too.

501
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,497
I went down to the funeral parlor

502
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,207
because I wanted to see him.

503
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,672
This old guy says
I shouldn't see Buddy

504
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,177
because he wasn't "prepared" yet.

505
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,060
I don't know.

506
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,856
I really just wanted to see him,

507
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,525
and my daddy wouldn't let me.

508
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,404
Well, that were the end of Buddy.

509
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,540
Far as that goes.

510
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,974
I'm going to drive.

511
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,176
I'll drive.

512
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,513
No, I'll drive.

513
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,770
No, no, gang.

514
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,351
This way.

515
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,861
I'm coming home with two men.

516
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,447
That will surprise the
hell out of my daddy.

517
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,908
He sure keeps a close watch on you.

518
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,335
Yeah. We're close.

519
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,714
He used to drive 250 miles

520
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,838
to take me down to Crescent Beach.

521
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:33,098
He'd buy me a chicken dinner.

522
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,141
We'd sleep in the back of the car.

523
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,811
We'd wake up that morning
and walk out on the sand.

524
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,515
He bought me this ring.

525
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,484
Reuben, would you
pull the car over?

526
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,732
I think I'm going to be sick.

527
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,653
Hang on.

528
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,365
Easy, easy.

529
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,997
You OK?

530
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,370
Come on.

531
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,087
I'd help, Norma, but I
think I'd give it up, too.

532
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,351
That was real ladylike of me.

533
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,771
I did bedpans one summer
at Stuyvesant Hospital.

534
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,068
One of these days,
I'll get myself together.

535
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,360
Well, make it soon.

536
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,278
Because one of these days,
I'm going to start in on you.

537
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,536
Read this when you can.

538
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,209
Got it down to two syllables.

539
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,036
One's better.

540
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,542
Good morning. Good morning.

541
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,625
Read this when you
have a chance, please.

542
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,844
Good morning, Norma Rae.

543
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,184
Hey, Lucius.

544
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,493
Morning, Linette.

545
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,579
Linette?

546
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,219
Hey, Billy Jo.

547
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,684
What the hell is going
on around here?

548
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,771
I'm talking to you!

549
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,865
Fink.

550
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,780
Well, shit!

551
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,508
Nobody's talking to me.

552
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,802
Less talk, more work.

553
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,175
They're my friends.

554
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,552
I'm quitting.

555
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,760
You're speeding them up
so you can weed them out.

556
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,186
You knew all that.

557
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,935
Yeah. I was greedy, and I was dumb.

558
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,146
You can fire me.

559
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:39,076
We'll put you back
in the weaving room.

560
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,324
Your family's been with
this mill a long time.

561
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,407
Good morning!

562
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,984
Morning.

563
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,735
Hey.

564
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,945
Hey.

565
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,781
We're all ready.

566
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:27,957
All of you?

567
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,869
All three of us.

568
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,498
Well, then, everybody hop in.

569
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,586
Millie, you can climb in yourself.

570
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,887
Now, be careful. Don't fall down.

571
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,259
What's your name, big guy?

572
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,430
Craig.

573
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,302
Put your feet on the floor!

574
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,728
Bye!

575
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,397
Bye, Mama.

576
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,065
Bye, Grandma!

577
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,484
I want to sit up front.

578
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,069
Are we there yet?

579
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,868
No, you silly willy.

580
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,076
We just started off.

581
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,748
I thought we were
going to the lake.

582
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,201
I got to make a stop.

583
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,254
You should have done
that before we started.

584
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,215
This is Alice.

585
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,013
She's mine.

586
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,724
Like I always say,
the more the merrier.

587
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,434
OK, watch what you're doing now.

588
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,074
Next time, you get
up there yourself.

589
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,283
You're sure easy with your kids.

590
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,959
I yell at them.

591
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,581
I swat them.

592
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,878
You're a pretty woman.

593
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,511
I was good at 18, but things
have slipped and slid.

594
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,089
You look all right to me.

595
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,800
Keep the lights low, I'm all right.

596
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,103
I'll take you where it's dark.

597
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,184
I've been there.

598
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,658
I don't owe a nickel in this town.

599
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,459
I'll eat anything
put in front of me.

600
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,788
I can fix anything electrical.

601
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,873
I'm all right after my
first cup of coffee.

602
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,959
I want that bad, though.

603
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,013
I got me a new job
at the gas station.

604
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,809
I turn my paycheck
over every Friday,

605
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,181
and I come straight home from work,

606
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,185
and I stay there.

607
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,268
Me and Alice, we're alone.

608
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,149
You got your two kids.

609
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,605
You're alone.

610
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,694
If you could help me,

611
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,450
maybe I could help you.

612
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,664
It's been a long
time between offers.

613
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,382
Kiss me.

614
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,219
If that's all right,

615
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,471
then everything else will be.

616
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,247
By the authority vested in me,
by this sovereign state,

617
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,129
I pronounce you man and wife.

618
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,178
If you like, you may
kiss the bride.

619
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,894
Mother over here has a
little homemade wine for us.

620
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,476
I picked the berries myself.

621
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,527
Thank you.

622
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,116
To my wife Norma Rae.

623
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,865
And, uh...

624
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,876
I just hope I can keep up with her.

625
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:57,636
Roscoe doesn't like it,
but I'm going.

626
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,722
I'm not asking anybody. I'm going.

627
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:26,999
On October 8, 1970, my grandfather,

628
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,676
Isaac Abraham Warshovsky, age 87,

629
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,753
died in his sleep in New York City.

630
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,681
On the following Friday
morning, his funeral was held.

631
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,978
My mother and father attended,

632
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,977
my two uncles from
Brooklyn attended,

633
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,775
and my Aunt Minnie
came up from Florida.

634
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,688
Also present were 862 members

635
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,523
of the amalgamated Clothing Workers

636
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,578
and the Cloth, Hat, and Cap
Makers' Union of America.

637
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,871
Also members of his family.

638
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:04,498
In death, as in life,
they stood at his side.

639
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,956
They had fought battles with him,

640
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:12,545
had earned bread together,
and had broken it together.

641
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,006
When they spoke, they
spoke in one voice,

642
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,887
and they were heard.

643
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,968
And they were black,
and they were white.

644
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,725
They were Irish,
and they were Polish.

645
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,773
They were Catholic,
and they were Jews.

646
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,317
And they were one.

647
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,646
That's what a union is, one.

648
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
the textile industry,

649
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,872
in which you are
spending your lives,

650
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,042
and in which your children
and their children

651
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,619
will spend their lives,

652
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,957
is the only industry
in these United States

653
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,667
that is not unionized.

654
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,755
They are free to exploit you

655
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,091
and to take away what
is rightfully yours.

656
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:04,771
Your health, a decent wage,
a fit place to work.

657
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,066
I urge you to stop them

658
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,486
by coming over to room 31
at the Golden Cherry Motel

659
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,906
to pick up a union
card and sign it.

660
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,240
Yes, it comes from the Bible.

661
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,415
"According to the
tribes of your fathers,

662
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,414
"ye shall inherit."

663
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,588
But it comes from
Reuben Warshovsky,

664
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,462
"Not unless you make it happen."

665
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,049
Thank you.

666
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,853
Thank you, Reverend.

667
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,521
Appreciate it.

668
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,480
Everybody should have come.

669
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,560
Next time.

670
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,112
If I have to drag them.

671
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,110
Hey.

672
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,651
When are you going to join?

673
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,986
Who's got the time?

674
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,036
Make the time.

675
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,080
I need help.

676
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:14,541
I appreciate any help
you can give me.

677
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,503
Licking stamps, stuffing envelopes,
typing with two fingers, anything.

678
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,338
I'll show up.

679
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,358
I'm here.

680
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,782
I'm ready to inspect your plant.

681
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,452
The federal government,

682
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,781
in accordance with federal
court order 7778,

683
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,640
states the following, "The
union has the right to inspect

684
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,119
"every bulletin board in the
mills at least once a week

685
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,958
"to verify that its notices
are not being stripped off."

686
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,715
Do you have a trash can?

687
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:01,967
Inside.

688
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,393
Keep America beautiful.

689
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,266
Downstairs.

690
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,202
Thank you.

691
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,503
Morning.

692
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,721
Morning.

693
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,266
Am I moving too quick for you?

694
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,139
I did my running in the army.

695
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,970
I'm not in the army now, brother.

696
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:54,686
If you're out of shape,
I'll slow down.

697
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,645
Keep it to a basic saunter.

698
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,739
Good morning.

699
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:10,574
I'm Reuben Warshovsky of the
Textile Workers' Union.

700
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,124
What is your name, brother?

701
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,042
Buffum.

702
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,795
How long have you worked here?

703
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,544
Twelve years.

704
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,967
Do you like your job?

705
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,589
I'd like to keep it.

706
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:28,467
You're interfering with the work.

707
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,143
Court order says you can't do that.

708
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,141
Well, then, brother,
let us both keep

709
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,939
to the letter of the law.

710
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,518
I ain't got no kike brother.

711
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,983
You didn't mean that.

712
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,064
I meant it.

713
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,152
Shit, do we have to fight?

714
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,577
The bulletin board's over here.

715
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,780
"Bulletin board's over here"!

716
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,793
Good morning.

717
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:07,176
Somebody's looking to
get into a car pool.

718
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,383
Somebody wants to
sell a basset pup.

719
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,436
You can pick pecans
for 40 cents a bushel

720
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,230
at Zelma Landing.

721
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,808
The only thing missing
is my notice.

722
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,019
It's there.

723
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,399
It is? I don't see it.

724
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,027
Ah, yes.

725
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,702
Wilt Chamberlain on stilts
could read that thing maybe.

726
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:37,706
Bring it down to eye
level, brothers.

727
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,254
We'll make note of your request.

728
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,880
Why do you guys pull
this horseshit?

729
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,838
I'll have to call my lawyers.

730
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,843
That's childish.

731
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,225
Where's the pay phone?

732
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,722
Hey!

733
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,972
Rick, bring it down.

734
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,064
Eye. Eye level.

735
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,569
Eye.

736
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,541
You ain't supposed to read it.

737
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:27,923
No union organizer has
been here for 10 years.

738
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,379
I'm reading it.

739
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,508
Well, read fast, then.

740
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,262
You go read the court order

741
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,434
that says any agent of this company

742
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:40,766
can be held in contempt.

743
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:41,895
I ain't violatin' no laws!

744
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,897
You're violating the law now!

745
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,854
Can we finish this?

746
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,359
Certainly.

747
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,240
Where's the other bulletin board?

748
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,321
In the weaving room.

749
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,247
Show it to me.

750
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,700
Rick!

751
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,968
Good morning. How are you?

752
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,055
Good morning.

753
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,220
Good morning to you. Good morning.

754
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,682
I'm Warshovsky, Textile
Workers' Union of America.

755
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,975
Good morning. Morning to you.

756
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,311
Good morning, ma'am.

757
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,687
Good morning.

758
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,399
Warshovsky, Textile
Workers' Union of America.

759
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,452
Good morning to you, ma'am.

760
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,242
Good morning.

761
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,044
I'm in room 31 of the
Golden Cherry Motel

762
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,588
if you have any questions.

763
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,130
Good morning.

764
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,009
Good morning to you.

765
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,304
Good morning.

766
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,848
Nice.

767
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:12,361
Gentlemen, your average
working man is not stupid.

768
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,862
He just gets tired.

769
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:18,697
You want to move this
out of here, please?

770
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,714
Move it. Move the stuff.

771
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,881
Hey, Reuben?

772
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,549
Hey.

773
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,591
You busy?

774
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,840
Yeah, very busy.

775
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,629
Can I come in?

776
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,056
Please.

777
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,696
Jeez, don't they ever
clean up around here?

778
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,316
I don't want them
messing with my stuff.

779
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,697
I know where everything is.

780
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,868
If I joined up with you,
would I lose my job?

781
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,369
No way.

782
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:49,457
You can wear a union button
as big as a Frisbee,

783
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:54,042
talk union, as long as
it's during a break,

784
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,173
and pass along union pamphlets.

785
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,050
They can't touch you.

786
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,144
I was never a very good Girl Scout.

787
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,642
I'll go along with you.

788
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,769
You're the fish I wanted to hook.

789
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,727
Well,

790
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,356
you got me.

791
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,316
What the hell you gonna do with me?

792
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,072
Make a mensch out of you, kid.

793
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,788
What is that?

794
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,664
Somebody who visits the old
folks' home on Saturday

795
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,496
instead of playing golf

796
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,004
or gives a blind man a
dollar for a pencil.

797
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,255
I'd do that.

798
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,091
But would you take the pencil?

799
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,638
Of course. I paid for it.

800
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:45,308
Somewhere between logic and charity
maybe there falls a little shadow?

801
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:46,351
Reuben...

802
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,679
We could debate this all night.

803
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,435
Sign this.

804
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,414
"Norma Rae Webster."

805
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,125
Everybody down here
has three names.

806
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,507
Let me pin this on you.

807
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:21,053
It would cover up the gravy spot.

808
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:24,177
What do I get if I do?

809
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:27,055
You don't get nothin' if you don't.

810
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,512
Besides, ain't you
had enough of that?

811
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:33,600
We used to heat up that
NCO club, remember?

812
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,150
Bygone days.

813
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,608
Then pin it on for bygone days.

814
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,156
Wayne, I'm proud of you.

815
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:46,078
Think we'll see that
club again, honey?

816
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,202
Take your wife. She
doesn't get out much.

817
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:55,667
Looks like you've strayed
off the reservation, Norma.

818
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,498
Is that right?

819
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,136
You got a coffee
machine at your end.

820
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,134
But no water fountain.

821
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,387
I cool down my coffee
before drinking it.

822
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,390
You'll cool everything!

823
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,449
Hey, Reverend.

824
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,405
Norma. You caught me
in my shirtsleeves.

825
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,119
Can we have some of your
flowers for Sunday?

826
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,330
Spider mites eating up everything.

827
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,880
OK.

828
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,960
Somehow I can help you, Norma?

829
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,802
How long I been coming
to this church?

830
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,883
Since you were little.

831
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,389
That's right.

832
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,267
I accepted Christ when
I was 6 years old.

833
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:02,483
Would you call me a good Christian?

834
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,314
With a lapse or two, yes.

835
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,821
With a lapse or two.

836
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,369
Are you a good Christian?

837
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,196
That's for the Lord to say.

838
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,286
I want this church for a
union meeting next Saturday.

839
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:19,372
That's blacks and whites
sitting together.

840
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,047
This is a house of God.

841
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,876
I'm waiting to see whether it is.

842
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,303
You're coming close to blasphemy.

843
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:31,509
I've come here to ask
God's forgiveness.

844
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,844
I want to see what this
church stands for,

845
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:38,103
and if you'll say there
should be justice, a union.

846
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:42,652
And if you don't,

847
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,527
there ain't nothin' good
for me in that church.

848
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,107
I'll leave it flat.

849
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,875
We're going to miss your
voice in the choir.

850
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:05,008
You'll hear it raised
up someplace else.

851
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,396
I'll be in in a minute.

852
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:36,040
We're holding a meeting,
union business.

853
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:39,414
Afterward we're having
lemonade and ginger snaps.

854
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,996
The shades are up. You can see in.

855
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,581
Washed my windows on Saturday.

856
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,507
You shouldn't have any trouble.

857
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,425
You're going too far.

858
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,011
How?

859
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,767
There's a bunch of
black men in there.

860
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,223
You'll get us in trouble.

861
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:05,982
I've never had trouble with
black men, only white men.

862
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:18,074
I remember some of
you from the church.

863
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,205
I did all of the talking that day.

864
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,379
Now I'd like you to speak.

865
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,708
Please.

866
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:49,405
A man's work should be a man's
work, not a term in jail.

867
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,615
Blacks have been pushed,
pulled, and scorned.

868
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,364
For what?

869
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:58,948
If everybody believes in
the union, I'm all for it.

870
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,249
Excuse me for saying
this with menfolks here,

871
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,672
but when I get menstrual cramps,

872
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,670
which come pretty hard,

873
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,753
they don't let me
sit down on my job.

874
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,009
You got to keep to your feet

875
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,015
unless you bring a
note from the doctor.

876
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,517
We wouldn't pretend to be sick.

877
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:28,397
I look at a brick wall all day.

878
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,570
There used to be a window there.

879
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,615
They brick it up to make
us feel we shut in.

880
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:40,198
My husband died of brown
lung two months ago.

881
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:46,246
His children are going
to grow up not even

882
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,625
knowing him.

883
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:58,341
I got all his clothes, if
someone could use them.

884
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,647
I'm not getting the message across.

885
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,321
17 people out of 800.

886
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:23,165
Well, you're an outsider.

887
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,334
Things move slow around here.

888
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,252
This isn't New York, where you
grab a taxi and grab your hat.

889
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,296
Craig's wetting the bed.

890
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:36,302
I told him not to drink Coke
before he went to sleep.

891
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,806
Craig?

892
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,929
Come on, sugar, wake up.

893
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,225
Get up.

894
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,895
Put your arms around my neck.

895
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,118
You got any ideas?

896
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,616
Get some corn whiskey.

897
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:05,620
We'll hit the back
roads on Saturday.

898
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,168
Are you finished, honey?

899
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,712
OK.

900
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,882
No more Cokes before
you go to sleep.

901
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:29,355
Mr. Robinson, how you doing today?

902
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,483
I'm busy.

903
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,902
I'm Norma Rae. You know me.

904
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,647
Yeah. How do you do?

905
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,528
This is my friend Reuben.

906
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,825
Nice to see you.

907
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,200
Read this, if you will, sir,

908
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,826
and I'll fix your tire.

909
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,282
How about that?

910
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,288
You've got a deal.

911
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,294
Can you do this?

912
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,091
Are you kidding?

913
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,511
Let's look like we can.

914
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,511
Watch your hand.

915
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,185
I think he was taking it off.

916
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,950
Are you making a baseball bat?

917
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:28,407
Hey, Joe. Will you
read one of these?

918
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,333
Jay, how you doing?

919
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,081
Will you read one?

920
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,040
Meet Reuben. He's a friend of mine.

921
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,090
How you doing, gentlemen?

922
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:43,009
Would you like to read one?
Elwood? Bob?

923
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,214
I'm not interested.

924
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,299
You're not interested in a union?

925
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,430
No.

926
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:50,683
You think you'll get a better
shake from management?

927
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,480
I always have.

928
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,687
Ow!

929
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:57,144
Damn glad you cut it.

930
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,156
That's telling him.

931
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,074
Hey, Robert.

932
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,446
Hi, Norma.

933
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,696
- We come out...
- Ah!

934
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:13,706
It's only grass and water.

935
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,267
We swam here as kids.

936
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,767
We'd leave school,
chuck off our clothes,

937
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,268
and jump in.

938
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:38,777
The only water hole I ever saw

939
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:42,482
was when we opened the
fire hydrant on 110th

940
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,237
with a wrench.

941
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,694
This is the life!

942
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,530
It's just a mud hole.

943
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,741
It's cooling off my mosquito bites.

944
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,083
It's as clean as I can get it.

945
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,835
Thank you.

946
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,676
Whoo!

947
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,004
It is hot.

948
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:08,966
I'm coming in.

949
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,516
Come on.

950
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,488
You know what?

951
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:33,494
An old farmer used to live
around here with a BB gun.

952
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,499
Sure hope he's moved.

953
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,501
Yeah. Me, too.

954
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:44,084
What's that? Something's
flicking around my...

955
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,211
Those are minnows.

956
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:47,295
Those are what?

957
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,846
Minnows. They won't hurt you.

958
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,139
They better not.

959
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,640
You're a fish out
of water down here.

960
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,597
It's not exactly my native habitat.

961
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:03,153
What would you do on a
day like this at home?

962
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,492
Play handball at the Y,
go see Aida at the Met.

963
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:14,080
Eat Chinese, play
poker, hit the sack.

964
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,043
I've been two places in my life.

965
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:26,130
I've been to Henleyville,
been to Piston.

966
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,637
Oh, you'd love New York.

967
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,339
You would, wow.

968
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,049
Super town.

969
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,930
Most beautiful women in the world,

970
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:39,936
best food, opera, theater, ballet.

971
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,396
Reuben.

972
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,022
What?

973
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,319
You're homesick.

974
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,772
Right.

975
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,695
God.

976
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,117
Reuben.

977
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,080
You got a skinny build.

978
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,246
Yeah?

979
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,999
Sonny works out with weights.

980
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,465
I tried that.

981
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,009
I dropped them and broke my foot.

982
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,130
Well,

983
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,936
you don't got to worry, because
you got a head on you,

984
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,353
and you use it.

985
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,367
What?

986
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:44,337
We got a bad connection, because
the line is being tapped.

987
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:48,042
Hey, you? This is
Norma Rae Webster.

988
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,547
I'm talking union to Henry Willis.

989
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,675
I'm on every night.

990
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,381
Same old story, no commercials.

991
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,432
Union, union, unions.

992
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,727
Look, have your boss man tap me.

993
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,306
Then you can go home
to your wife and kids.

994
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,858
Henry?

995
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:08,145
Shoot!

996
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,820
You ain't gettin' any sleep.

997
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,321
Neither am I.

998
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,869
We're working tomorrow morning.

999
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:19,322
I got 100 calls to make tonight.

1000
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,668
Is that going on our phone bill?

1001
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,371
We'll take it out of my paycheck.

1002
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,081
That damn milk is sour!

1003
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,377
I didn't have a chance
to go shopping.

1004
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,181
And you didn't get to the washing,

1005
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,600
or the kids, or to me!

1006
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:40,973
Is that right?

1007
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,178
That's right!

1008
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,934
Damn TV dinners!

1009
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,857
Kids going around in dirty jeans!

1010
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,481
I'm going around, uh, without!

1011
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,187
Altogether!

1012
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,291
You want cooking?

1013
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,306
You got cooking.

1014
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,227
You want laundry?

1015
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,649
You got laundry.

1016
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,067
You want ironing?

1017
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,237
You got ironing.

1018
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,659
You want to make love?

1019
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,615
You get behind me and lift up
my nighty, and we'll make love.

1020
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,829
Norma.

1021
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,334
Norma!

1022
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,585
Hey.

1023
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:10,267
Come this time. Don't
just nod your head.

1024
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:14,445
Doris, come on. Bring
your peanut butter pie.

1025
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,400
I heard your little
one's got the measles.

1026
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:20,451
Keep him away from mine, will you?

1027
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,405
Brenda, how's your new baby?

1028
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,833
Get down to the Golden Cherry.

1029
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:29,912
Hey, get down to the Golden Cherry.

1030
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,375
Sue? Come on, read this, every
single word of it. It's important.

1031
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,755
Come on down.

1032
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,257
If I got the time, you do.

1033
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,354
I don't bump into you much anymore.

1034
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:56,354
You all right, Daddy?

1035
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,939
About the same.

1036
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,909
Your color's bad.
You been drinking?

1037
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,361
Thimbleful now and then.

1038
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,867
It's not good for you.

1039
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,369
What's the difference?

1040
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,702
I lie down and wonder
if I'll get up again.

1041
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,672
Don't talk old. I don't like it.

1042
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,547
Listen.

1043
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:25,391
I'm coming over there
one of these nights

1044
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,935
and take you out to a grand supper.

1045
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,642
OK.

1046
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,143
OK.

1047
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,588
Has James gone back?

1048
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,514
I guess so.

1049
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,764
Where'd he go, home?

1050
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:10,311
I don't know.

1051
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,431
Jesus.

1052
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,983
I ought to be going home, too.

1053
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,737
Hey, how's Dorothy?

1054
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,070
Terrific. Thanks.

1055
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,155
I see you got a new picture of her.

1056
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:34,794
You like it? My mother sent that.

1057
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:38,624
She and your mother must
get along real well.

1058
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,628
Are you kidding?
My mother loves her.

1059
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:46,681
She's a lawyer, she's
Jewish, and a great cook.

1060
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,474
What else is there?

1061
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,308
How come she's so smart?

1062
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,642
Dorothy?

1063
01:13:58,851 --> 01:13:59,943
Books.

1064
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,274
Oh, madame, your dinner.

1065
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,285
<i>Le grand</i> banana and a beer.

1066
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,487
No.

1067
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,450
Who's this?

1068
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,001
Dylan Thomas.

1069
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:22,171
He was a poet, genius, and a drunk.

1070
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,681
What's he write about?

1071
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:33,727
Love, sex, death, other
matters of consequence.

1072
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,647
Is he hard to read?

1073
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,939
Eh...

1074
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:38,937
Eh...

1075
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,936
So why should I bother?

1076
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:45,819
Because maybe he has
something to say to you.

1077
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,821
Open that, will you?

1078
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:54,658
"Rage, rage against the
dying of the light."

1079
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,832
Yeah?

1080
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah.

1081
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:01,585
Well, I'll try him.

1082
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:02,756
Good.

1083
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:09,514
Hell, there ain't nothin'
on TV but reruns anyway.

1084
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,431
Don't eat while you read.

1085
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,805
I hate banana in my books.

1086
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:16,057
Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch.

1087
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:55,893
Warren?

1088
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,726
Warren?

1089
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,402
Nobody showed up at the meeting.

1090
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:08,607
They got us on a stretch-out.

1091
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:11,192
Put us on a three-day week.

1092
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,324
Twice the work for half the pay.

1093
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,656
All on account of you.

1094
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,084
You stand there for a minute.

1095
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,754
Oh, man.

1096
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:36,559
There's six turnips and two
quarts of water in there.

1097
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:39,808
That's supper for seven people.

1098
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,981
Sell your union someplace else.

1099
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,399
Hey...

1100
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:12,466
My arm's numb. I better lie down.

1101
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,265
You got a break in 15 minutes.

1102
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,138
I better go now.

1103
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,640
Hang on. Your break's coming up.

1104
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,835
In a minute, Lucius.

1105
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,167
Mavis, Rhonda.

1106
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,765
Hey, Betty.

1107
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:44,846
You're supposed to be here at 3:15.

1108
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:48,559
It's 4:15. Working for
this union or not?

1109
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,064
I got my tooth filled.

1110
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,566
You were getting your
beer gut filled!

1111
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:57,657
Chew your old man out. Get off me.

1112
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:02,990
I'm giving 9, 10, 12
hours here every day.

1113
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:05,575
We're doing our share of work.

1114
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:07,752
Either do your share or don't
call yourself a union member!

1115
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:13,003
Norma! Shut your cake hole.
Out of the office.

1116
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,627
I only said what was true.

1117
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,257
Out.

1118
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:19,805
Come on.

1119
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,016
Peter.

1120
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,723
Get to work. Come on.

1121
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,400
Everybody back to work.

1122
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,710
Mouth.

1123
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:54,422
You can't come down
that hard on a man.

1124
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:56,921
Leave him his balls. Easy. Jesus.

1125
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,673
If you were in the state
department, we'd be at war.

1126
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,184
- All right. I got a big mouth.
- Um-hmm.

1127
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:14,151
Cotton mill workers are
known as trash to some.

1128
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:20,529
The union's the only way
we'll get our own voice

1129
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:23,076
and make ourselves any better.

1130
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,572
I guess that's why I push.

1131
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,749
Our own Mother Jones.

1132
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,826
Who's she?

1133
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,128
She was some considerable lady.

1134
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:37,174
She made it happen for the
coal miners in West Virginia.

1135
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:40,173
You ain't mad at me?

1136
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,681
If the situation ever called for

1137
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:49,513
a smart, loud, profane,
sloppy, hard-working woman,

1138
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:52,189
I'd pick you every time, kid.

1139
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,359
How come sloppy? Nobody
wears girdles anymore.

1140
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,442
I didn't order anything.

1141
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,444
Well, hey, you ate it!

1142
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,671
What do you want?

1143
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,176
Warshovsky around?

1144
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,347
Reuben's at the printer's.

1145
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,520
Pretty late for the printer's.

1146
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:35,896
Reuben keeps them working late.

1147
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,236
You're Norma Rae, aren't you?

1148
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,479
Huh?

1149
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:43,820
I'm Mrs. Webster.

1150
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,072
We're from the union
national headquarters.

1151
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,903
Al London, Sam Dankin.

1152
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,159
Is that right?

1153
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:54,085
I might as well give
you my shopping list.

1154
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,504
We need envelopes, stamps.

1155
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,001
We're almost out of typing paper.

1156
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:03,006
How about some typewriters
that don't stick?

1157
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:06,425
We're not in office
supplies, Mrs. Webster.

1158
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:09,600
You aren't around much, either.

1159
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,268
Hello, Reuben.

1160
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,597
Sam, you're getting fat.

1161
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,182
I've gained a couple pounds.

1162
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,687
Al, how are you?

1163
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,189
Lousy. I got a cold.

1164
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,276
What brings you guys?

1165
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,445
You're not getting up a
head of steam, Reuben.

1166
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:29,870
You know what I'm up against.

1167
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,367
We're worried.

1168
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:32,994
That makes three of us.

1169
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,997
It's a small,
Southern Baptist town.

1170
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,953
You got to keep your
nose very clean.

1171
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,960
Why? You see any snot in mine?

1172
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,962
Maybe Mrs. Webster
would like to leave?

1173
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,052
Why?

1174
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,303
This concerns her.

1175
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,259
I'm making it easy on her...

1176
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,936
It's late. What do you want?

1177
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:00,067
If the company wants
us to look bad,

1178
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:03,692
they'll use anything
to make us look bad.

1179
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:07,491
The mill hands go to
church every Sunday.

1180
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,409
She's talking union to them?

1181
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,411
They say she's made a porno movie

1182
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,161
with a local police
officer, very explicit.

1183
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,003
Run it for me.

1184
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,757
There doesn't have to be a movie,
if people talk like there's one.

1185
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,341
The lady has an illegitimate child.

1186
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,017
She's slept around.

1187
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,015
She naps on your bed.

1188
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:41,442
Are we in the union business or the
character assassination business?

1189
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:46,523
After an 18-hour day, I got
the Legion of Decency here!

1190
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:49,199
She's broken her ass
for this organization!

1191
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:52,027
She doesn't see her kids!
Doesn't have time for bath!

1192
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:55,034
Is this the Catholic Church?

1193
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,285
Are we canonizing her?

1194
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:57,708
It's your game.

1195
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,410
You're damn right!

1196
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:01,871
Make it stick or get out!

1197
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,581
Get out anyway!

1198
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,554
I'm sorry, Mrs. Webster.

1199
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,938
I don't want to hurt the
union. I'll quit if you want.

1200
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,986
Weren't you supposed
to be typing letters?

1201
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,652
Yeah.

1202
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,474
Hey. It's me, Norma.

1203
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:00,721
OK, it's I, Norma.
Forget the grammar.

1204
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:03,023
We got to talk.

1205
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:10,401
Maybe we could meet at my break.

1206
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,902
OK.

1207
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,659
I was making sure my kids
got home from school.

1208
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:21,368
Your kids are with my
kids buying candy.

1209
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:26,042
That's why dentist
bills is busting me!

1210
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,544
Uh!

1211
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:34,259
Come on! Come on, boy!

1212
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,965
Come here, boy!

1213
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:38,926
You thinking union?

1214
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:42,100
You want union? You'll get union.

1215
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:50,775
Break it up! Break it up!

1216
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,777
Break it up!

1217
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:02,999
You all right?

1218
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,122
Yeah.

1219
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,495
What started this?

1220
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:09,832
They put up a letter saying
blacks are taking over the union,

1221
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:14,261
that they're going to
push the whites around.

1222
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,089
We'll take legal action.

1223
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,765
Get me the letter.

1224
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,639
They're watching me.

1225
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,061
How's your memory?

1226
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,888
I don't know the
pledge of allegiance.

1227
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,224
Write down a line at a time.

1228
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:30,026
It's like the time
I pinched a lipstick.

1229
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,194
Did you get caught?

1230
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,317
I went back for curlers.

1231
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:08,349
"Dominate it

1232
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:12,403
"and control it

1233
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:16,402
"as you may

1234
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:19,826
"see fit.

1235
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,825
"If now...

1236
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,663
"if now..."

1237
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,037
Damn! Damn, damn, damn!

1238
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,091
"...you black employees,
by joining the union,

1239
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:37,716
"can dominate it and control it

1240
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,091
"as you may see fit.

1241
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,265
"If..."

1242
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,591
Where's the rest?

1243
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,267
That's all I could get.

1244
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,764
Mata Hari.

1245
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,687
They watched us every minute.

1246
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:51,108
Here's our chance to nail them.

1247
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,935
Don't tell me you can't remember.

1248
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:57,273
You copy it line for line.

1249
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:01,451
You get the date and signature.

1250
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,618
I'll get fired.

1251
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:03,661
I'll run you a benefit.

1252
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,614
Thanks a lot.

1253
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,870
Want a massage?
Go to a massage parlor.

1254
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:11,203
Either we get beat,
or we don't get beat.

1255
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:17,710
I got three kids, bills,
and an unhappy husband.

1256
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:21,969
I'll do it, but keep off my back.

1257
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,266
Reuben, I'll tell you something.

1258
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:25,809
What?

1259
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:29,934
You've been away from home
and you're getting crabby.

1260
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:33,233
Reuben, you need yourself a woman.

1261
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,019
Funny you should mention it.

1262
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:38,355
Tonight's the night.

1263
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:39,940
What would Dorothy say?

1264
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,650
"Wear a rubber."

1265
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,666
You can't copy this!

1266
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,995
It's on the board.
I'm going to copy it!

1267
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,126
You better not.

1268
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,378
I'm taking down every word!

1269
01:28:57,457 --> 01:29:01,337
It's my break!
I'm copying every word!

1270
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,887
Stay out of my way!

1271
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,886
I'm copying it!

1272
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:10,849
Hello, Norma.

1273
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:13,648
You know who I am.

1274
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:16,476
Put the pencil and paper away.

1275
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,938
Stop it right now.

1276
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,443
You're going to leave!

1277
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:25,369
The law's going to come after you!

1278
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:29,573
Mr. Mason, I started this,
and I'm going to finish it.

1279
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,244
"Serious violence."

1280
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,551
Let's go to my office.

1281
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:53,897
Why did you make personal
calls on company time?

1282
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,486
Spell out your names for me.

1283
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:07,573
Don't be foolish, Norma Rae.

1284
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,995
Nobody here is on my side,

1285
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:17,079
and I'm not leaving until I
set down all your names.

1286
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:20,712
I want you off the premises now!

1287
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,844
Phone your husband!
Have him fetch you!

1288
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,968
I want you out quick!

1289
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,292
Norma Rae.

1290
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:57,620
Forget it!

1291
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,796
I'm staying put!

1292
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,999
Right where I am!

1293
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,388
It's going to take you,
the police department,

1294
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,215
the fire department,

1295
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:13,393
and the National Guard
to get me out of here!

1296
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:18,640
I'll wait for the sheriff
to take me home!

1297
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,897
And I ain't gonna budge
till he gets here!

1298
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:02,520
Come on down now, Norma Rae.

1299
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,228
Come on down, now.

1300
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,070
You heard what I said. Come down.

1301
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:30,255
Lamar.

1302
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:37,965
I want you to put it in writing
that Sheriff Lamar Miller

1303
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:42,177
is going to take Norma Rae
Webster straight home.

1304
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,854
I want you to sign it,

1305
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:48,604
and I want you to hand it to me.

1306
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:50,769
Don't tell me what to do.

1307
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,856
You're getting nothing
from me in writing.

1308
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,900
You want her off the premises?

1309
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,530
Take her out.

1310
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,121
I'm not sure I should
get in the same car

1311
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:04,370
with you and nobody else.

1312
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:09,292
Lamar, I ain't gonna bite you.

1313
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:43,746
A police car?
You're taking me to jail!

1314
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:46,916
No! No! No!

1315
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,117
Quit that now!

1316
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:49,578
No! No!

1317
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:51,208
You're going to jail!

1318
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:52,630
No!

1319
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,048
Get her in there.

1320
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,921
No! No!

1321
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,674
No!

1322
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,255
Get in there now!

1323
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:01,430
No!

1324
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,758
Get her in.

1325
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,638
Get in there.

1326
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,185
No!

1327
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:08,813
Ahhh!

1328
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,853
No!

1329
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:27,286
Webster, Norma Rae.

1330
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:30,790
704 Priester Road, Henleyville.

1331
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,586
She's white.

1332
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:35,123
Female, 31.

1333
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:37,834
Occupation, textile.

1334
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:42,339
Fair complexion, brown
hair, brown eyes.

1335
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,472
Arrest number, 2238B.

1336
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:50,096
Charge, disorderly conduct.

1337
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:54,938
Norma Rae, you go with her now.

1338
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:15,788
Might as well sit down.

1339
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,590
You got one phone call.

1340
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,420
Better call Sonny.

1341
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:26,474
I'll be calling my union organizer.

1342
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:34,266
The first time you're in is bad.

1343
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,461
It comes with the job.

1344
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,094
I saw a pregnant woman
on a picket line

1345
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:05,888
get hit in the stomach with a club.

1346
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:09,388
I saw a boy of 16 get
shot in the back.

1347
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:13,555
I saw a guy blown to hell and back

1348
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:16,107
when he tried to start his car.

1349
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,156
You just got your
feet wet on this one.

1350
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,425
Norma, you all right?

1351
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,844
I put the kids to bed.

1352
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,813
Craig?

1353
01:38:58,891 --> 01:38:59,983
Honey, wake up.

1354
01:39:00,059 --> 01:39:01,561
It's Mama.

1355
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:04,488
I want to talk to you. Come on.

1356
01:39:04,564 --> 01:39:07,238
Put your arms around my neck.

1357
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:09,694
Alice, Millie, wake up.

1358
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,620
I want to talk to you, sweetheart.

1359
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:13,994
Come in the living room.

1360
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:17,702
Come on. Atta girl.

1361
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:42,860
I love you kids.

1362
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:46,697
That's the first thing.

1363
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:49,822
And Sonny loves you.

1364
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:54,326
You got the both of us.

1365
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:59,748
The second thing is

1366
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,835
I'm a jailbird.

1367
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,923
Now, you're going
to be hearing that

1368
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,471
and a lot of other things.

1369
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:13,516
But you're going to
hear it from me first.

1370
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:20,894
Millie.

1371
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:22,771
Your daddy.

1372
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,898
His name was Buddy Wilson.

1373
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:28,322
He died four months
after you was born.

1374
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:31,951
Craig.

1375
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:36,660
I wasn't never married
to your daddy.

1376
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:39,367
And he wasn't Buddy.

1377
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,748
And he's not Sonny.

1378
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,795
He's another man.

1379
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:49,427
And there have been
others in my life.

1380
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:52,972
You're going to be
hearing about them, too.

1381
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:56,175
I'm not perfect.

1382
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:59,387
I made mistakes.

1383
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:14,907
Millie, these are
pictures of your daddy.

1384
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:18,656
Craig, I got pictures
of your daddy.

1385
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:22,000
They belong to you.

1386
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:36,140
If you go in the mill,

1387
01:41:36,215 --> 01:41:40,140
I want life to be better
for you than it is for me.

1388
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:46,104
That's why I joined the union,

1389
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:48,686
and that's why I got fired for it.

1390
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:53,191
You understand me?

1391
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,948
Now, you kids,

1392
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,376
you know what I am.

1393
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:09,007
And you know that I believe

1394
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:12,051
in standing up for
what I think is right.

1395
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:25,894
Go to the bathroom
before you get into bed.

1396
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:29,568
Take your pictures.

1397
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,571
Go on.

1398
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:45,535
I'll take a bath.

1399
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:48,087
There's lice in that jail.

1400
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:03,015
She had one call,
and she called you.

1401
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:07,106
She knew I could make bail.

1402
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,353
You come in here,

1403
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:15,315
you mix her up, turn
her head all around.

1404
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:17,571
She's all changed.

1405
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:22,781
I didn't want her to
be a front-runner.

1406
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:30,880
What's going to happen to us now?

1407
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,298
She stood on the table.

1408
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:34,341
She's a free woman.

1409
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:37,546
Maybe you can live with it.
Maybe you can't.

1410
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:49,273
Busted my shoelace.

1411
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:53,436
There's another one in the drawer.

1412
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:56,068
I busted that one last week.

1413
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:06,995
Did you ever sleep with him?

1414
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:08,701
No.

1415
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:12,379
But he's in my head.

1416
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:21,506
I'm going to see you
through getting tired,

1417
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:23,387
getting sick,

1418
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:27,310
getting old.

1419
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:34,398
I'm going to see you through
anything that comes up.

1420
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:39,236
And there's nobody else in my head.

1421
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:42,860
Just you.

1422
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:20,481
<i>Folks, ballots tabulated for
the O.P. Henley Company,</i>

1423
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:24,689
<i>against the union, 373.</i>

1424
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:48,554
<i>Folks,</i>

1425
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:55,473
<i>the count for the union, 427.</i>

1426
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:12,403
We got it in!

1427
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:17,078
Union! Union! Union! Union!

1428
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:21,044
Union! Union! Union!

1429
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:26,007
Union! Union! Union!

1430
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:35,051
Union! Union! Union! Union!

1431
01:48:35,134 --> 01:48:38,684
Union! Union! Union!

1432
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:42,187
Union! Union! Union!
Union! Union! Union!

1433
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:53,327
Union! Union! Union!
Union! Union! Union!

1434
01:49:18,343 --> 01:49:20,186
You going to drive
straight through?

1435
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:22,606
Yes.

1436
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:25,059
You better stop for
coffee, stay awake.

1437
01:49:25,142 --> 01:49:27,440
I got a thermos in the car.

1438
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:31,527
Well...

1439
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:34,826
Well?

1440
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,237
Well.

1441
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,367
Well.

1442
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:40,116
Ah, so.

1443
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:42,167
What are you going to do now?

1444
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,336
Live. What else?

1445
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:48,503
Drop me a line once in a while.

1446
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:51,381
Anyone read your mail?

1447
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,462
My mother.

1448
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:59,973
I'll send you a copy
of Dylan Thomas.

1449
01:50:00,052 --> 01:50:02,976
I already bought one for myself.

1450
01:50:03,055 --> 01:50:04,932
You did?

1451
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:07,643
Nobody can do anything
for you, huh?

1452
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:15,200
You've done something
for me, a lot.

1453
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:21,119
Well, you did something for us.

1454
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:25,786
A mitzvah.

1455
01:50:26,829 --> 01:50:29,753
- What's that?
- What is that?

1456
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,380
That's a good work.

1457
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,890
I don't say good-bye.

1458
01:50:37,965 --> 01:50:40,764
I have been known to cry.

1459
01:50:40,843 --> 01:50:42,766
- Well, what do you say?
- Ahhh...

1460
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,268
Be happy.

1461
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:48,271
Be well.

1462
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:50,273
Same to you.

1463
01:50:56,233 --> 01:50:59,328
Best wishes don't
seem hardly enough.

1464
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:00,871
I...

1465
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:02,493
I'd like to thank you.

1466
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:07,077
I do.

1467
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:10,711
I thank you for your companionship,

1468
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:13,212
your stamina,

1469
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:16,594
your horse sense, and 101 laughs.

1470
01:51:18,964 --> 01:51:22,013
I also enjoyed very much

1471
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:24,811
looking at your shining hair

1472
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:26,605
and your shining face.

1473
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:30,859
Reuben, I think you like me.

1474
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:33,779
I do.

1475
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:39,409
I was going to buy you something,

1476
01:51:39,484 --> 01:51:42,454
but I didn't know what you'd like.

1477
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:48,627
Norma, what I've had from
you has been sumptuous.

1478
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:09,395
<i>Bless the child of a workin' man</i>

1479
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:15,071
<i>She knows too soon who she is</i>

1480
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:21,073
<i>And bless the hands of a workin' man</i>

1481
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:26,908
<i>He knows his soul is his</i>

1482
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:29,789
<i>So it goes like it goes</i>

1483
01:52:29,868 --> 01:52:31,586
<i>Like the river flows</i>

1484
01:52:32,454 --> 01:52:38,086
<i>And time, it rolls right on</i>

1485
01:52:38,168 --> 01:52:41,012
<i>And maybe what's good</i>

1486
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:46,015
<i>Gets a little bit better</i>

1487
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:52,851
<i>And maybe what's bad gets gone</i>

1488
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:02,030
<i>And it goes like it goes</i>

1489
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:04,988
<i>Like the river flows</i>

1490
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:11,544
<i>And time keeps rollin' on</i>

1491
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:14,963
<i>And maybe what's good</i>

1492
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:21,091
<i>Gets a little bit better</i>

1493
01:53:21,169 --> 01:53:26,479
<i>And maybe what's bad</i>

1494
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:33,399
<i>Gets gone</i>
