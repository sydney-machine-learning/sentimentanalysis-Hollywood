1
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,130
Let's keep those hammers working!

2
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,110
Rambo!

3
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:07,905
Let's go.

4
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,263
How are you, Johnny?

5
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:34,265
Good.

6
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,976
That's all.

7
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,443
I'm sorry they sent you to such
a hellhole. - I've seen worse.

8
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,778
Yeah, you have, haven't you...

9
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:53,451
I told you that I'd help you
when I could. Are you interested?

10
00:01:56,871 --> 00:02:01,250
You can't possibly want
to stay here for another five years.

11
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:12,553
In here at least I know where I stand.
- Just hear me out first.

12
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,682
A covert operation
is being geared up in the Far East.

13
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:21,812
A computer gave your name as one of
3 suitable candidates for the mission.

14
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:26,525
Mission?
- A hunt for POWs in Vietnam.

15
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,491
Why now? Why me?

16
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:38,204
The prison camp you escaped from in '71
is the target area.

17
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:43,125
No one knows that terrain better
than you. The risk factor's very high.

18
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:47,088
You'd be temporarily reinstated in the
forces, and if the mission's successful,

19
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:50,216
there may be a presidential pardon.

20
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,928
You interested?

21
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:01,852
Yeah.

22
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:06,357
Good. I'll get the necessary clearance.

23
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:11,529
The next time we meet will be in
Thailand with the special ops designate.

24
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,114
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,449
All clear?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,619
I want you to know I did
what I could to keep you out of here.

27
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:20,746
I know.

28
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:27,837
Do we get to win this time?

29
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:30,464
This time it's up to you.

30
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,017
That'll be all.

31
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:52,982
How're you doing, Rambo? I'm Ericson.
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

32
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,987
You're the chosen one, ha?

33
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:01,782
You made
a helluva rep for yourself in 'nam.

34
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:04,744
I'm glad to be working with you.

35
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:09,874
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint.

36
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:15,296
He's here.

37
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,301
Morning, John.

38
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:23,929
This is Marshal Murdock.
He's in charge of special operations.

39
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,098
Thank you, Colonel. Rambo,

40
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:29,477
been looking forward to meeting you.
How was your trip? No problems? - No.

41
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:33,022
Except for the damned heat, right?
I've never felt anything like it.

42
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:35,941
Come on in,
let's get down to business.

43
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:41,072
I was glancing over your files.

44
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:44,367
Makes pretty interesting reading.

45
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:54,794
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent.

46
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:58,839
That's a helluva combination.
Joined the army 6.8.64,

47
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:02,176
accepted special forces,
specialization: Light weapons.

48
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,179
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

49
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:10,226
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver stars,
4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

50
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:12,061
Medal of Honor.

51
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:18,943
You got around, didn't you?
Incredible. Rambo, you're probably aware

52
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:22,863
that there are almost 2,500 Americans
still missing in action in SE Asia.

53
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:27,785
Most are presumed dead, but for the
families, Congress and many Americans

54
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,538
it's still an emotional issue.

55
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:32,331
Give me something cold, please!

56
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:37,753
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

57
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:41,298
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.

58
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:45,261
I lost a lot of good men,
so I know what you and every vet feels.

59
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:50,099
Maybe the government and certain
segments of the population didn't care,

60
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:55,813
but my committee cares. - It needs
proof that Americans are there.

61
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:57,690
Then we'll get 'em back.

62
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:03,487
If there are any of our men at the POW
target camp, you're to take photos.

63
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:07,992
Photos?
- Only photos. Under no circumstances

64
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:12,788
are you to engage the enemy.
- I'm supposed to leave them there?

65
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,083
I repeat:
Do not engage the enemy!

66
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:20,421
The assault team led by Colonel Trautman
will handle the extraction.

67
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:31,640
With your participation,
this mission has a better than average

68
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,851
chance of succeeding.

69
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:39,315
I'll meet you both
in the operations center in one hour.

70
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,794
From Thailand across Laos
into the mountains of Vietnam.

71
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:03,297
You'll be flying a ceiling
of 250 feet when you bail out.

72
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:06,634
Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.

73
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:11,347
Since you're going in solo, you'll have
to take more equipment than ever before.

74
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:15,559
And use it!
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.

75
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,646
Let technology do most of the work.

76
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:24,026
Forget the war. Remember the mission.
The old Vietnam is dead.

77
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:28,614
Sir, I'm alive,
so it's still alive, isn't it?

78
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,211
You may find this hard
to believe, but all this is for you.

79
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,130
Impressed?

80
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,720
You'll get every modern piece of
equipment we have to ensure your safety.

81
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:55,015
You can feel totally safe because we
have the world's most advanced weapons.

82
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,689
I've always believed that the mind's
the best weapon. - Times change.

83
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:03,441
For some people.

84
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,277
Don't let me interrupt.

85
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:09,155
Upon insertion
call in to base camp on Transat.

86
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:15,202
Then proceed to rendezvous with your
ground contact, indigenous agent Co Bao.

87
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,705
Is he listening?

88
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,875
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

89
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:29,592
Colonel!

90
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,887
Are you sure he's not unbalanced?

91
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:38,267
What if he cracks under the pressure
in that hell? - Pressure?

92
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,687
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen.

93
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:46,359
A pure fighting machine with only
a desire to win a war someone else lost.

94
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:51,989
If winning means he has to die,
he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

95
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,284
And one more thing:

96
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:59,663
What you call "hell", he calls home.

97
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:05,628
Stand by! Start A.P.U.!

98
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:31,362
D minus 20.

99
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:04,979
D minus 5.

100
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:26,042
You've got 36 hours to get in and out.
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

101
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:32,965
If you run into trouble, try to get
to the hilltop extraction site.

102
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:40,431
Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

103
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,433
Ready to roll.

104
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:49,440
Murdock said he'd been
with the 2nd Battalion in Kon Tum '66.

105
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:53,194
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

106
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,989
You're the only one that I trust.

107
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:42,952
Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

108
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:47,998
But there are people to satisfy,
questions that have to be answered.

109
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,836
You don't sound too emotional about it.
- It wasn't my war, Colonel.

110
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:54,755
I'm here to clean up the mess.

111
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:39,967
K-Wok 2-5 is raft.

112
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:42,053
They're holding timeline.

113
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:44,889
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

114
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,342
We're back in the badlands, my man.

115
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:24,178
Stand by your position!

116
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,765
Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!

117
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:42,029
5 seconds.

118
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:03,134
What's happening?
- He's hung up!

119
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,513
He'll be torn apart!

120
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,893
He's hung up! - What do you mean he's
hung up? - He's being dragged!

121
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:17,898
Cut him loose!
- I can't free him!

122
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:42,673
Abort the mission!
- That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

123
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,054
He's cutting away his equipment.

124
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,317
He's out!

125
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:05,988
Here is Dragonfly 1. Do you read me?
- Dragonfly 1, I read you.

126
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:10,034
Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.

127
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:23,881
Maybe it's best to abort
the mission now. Who could survive that?

128
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,092
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

129
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,097
He's got 36 hours to complete the
mission and reach the extraction point.

130
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:34,475
We owe him that.
- Of course we do.

131
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:40,272
But understand something:
In 36 hours we pull out.

132
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,628
Rambo!

133
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,144
You did not expect a woman, no?

134
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:46,148
We'd better go.

135
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:53,406
We go to river.
How come you so late?

136
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:55,408
I was hung up.

137
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:05,376
I have arranged boat to take us
down river. Old ways not safe.

138
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:09,839
You come a long way, Rambo,
to see empty camp.

139
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:04,185
You're using pirates?

140
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:09,815
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

141
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,064
What about patrol boats?

142
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:54,628
Russian.

143
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:23,282
Rambo,

144
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,744
want to eat?

145
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,955
Maybe later.

146
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:40,424
How you get into this?

147
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,347
It's a long story.
- Long trip.

148
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:52,561
After I left the special forces,

149
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:57,316
I moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?

150
00:23:57,817 --> 00:23:58,984
I...

151
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:03,030
...came back to the States

152
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,783
and found another war going on.

153
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:09,245
What war?

154
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,997
Kind of like a quiet war.

155
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:19,964
A war against the soldiers returning.
The kind of war you don't win.

156
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:29,098
It's my problem.
How did you get into it?

157
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:34,770
My father
worked for intelligence agency.

158
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:39,525
He killed, and I take his place.

159
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:41,485
There's too much death here.

160
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:43,654
Death everywhere.

161
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:49,410
I just want to live.

162
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:57,209
Maybe go America. Live the quiet life.

163
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:02,840
What you want?

164
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:07,720
To win. To survive.

165
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:13,392
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

166
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:17,605
To survive a war,
you've got to become war.

167
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:21,525
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

168
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:28,491
I am expendable.

169
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:32,995
What mean "expendable"?

170
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:36,415
It's like

171
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:42,797
someone invites you to a party
and you don't show up,

172
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:45,257
and it doesn't really matter.

173
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:53,683
What's this?

174
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:57,103
It bring me good luck.

175
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:01,065
What bring you good luck?

176
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,658
I guess this.

177
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:21,043
No further reports. - I want to go up
with the extraction team at dawn.

178
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:23,045
Denied.
- Denied?

179
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:26,215
It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

180
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:29,093
We don't even know if he's alive.
- Unlikely.

181
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:31,887
You said we'd go through as planned.

182
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:37,351
Okay, if you
want to go through with it, we will.

183
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:40,104
The Colonel's
gonna be joining the extraction team.

184
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:45,109
You're a damned good man, Trautman.

185
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,960
See? Camp empty.

186
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,089
We move closer.

187
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:35,052
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

188
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:40,683
Come on!

189
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:59,785
What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

190
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:11,172
You not going in there.
You're supposed to only take pictures.

191
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:12,882
What about orders?

192
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:15,301
No more orders, Co.

193
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:00,484
I've come to get you out.

194
00:33:02,153 --> 00:33:03,779
Don't talk.

195
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:35,603
There are others.
- I'll be back.

196
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:16,370
Everything okay?

197
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:18,706
Let's go!

198
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:53,824
You have clearance.

199
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:56,369
Minus one hour to extraction.

200
00:35:56,827 --> 00:35:59,872
I hope for his sake
we're not just wasting fuel.

201
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:02,375
Let's get moving.

202
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,524
A good thing you came when you did.

203
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:28,317
Why is that?

204
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:32,738
They move us around a lot. Because
of the crops. Only been there a week.

205
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:38,661
When were you last in that camp?
- A year. What year is it, anyway?

206
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:41,038
1985.

207
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:47,378
Camp supposed to be empty.

208
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:49,672
Yes, supposed to be.

209
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:26,125
Landing zone a mile up river.

210
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:29,355
What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

211
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,233
You bastard!

212
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:11,272
Right, jump!
- I fight!

213
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:13,065
Jump! Go on!

214
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:10,289
The gunboat!

215
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:29,225
Jump!

216
00:40:41,737 --> 00:40:43,614
You made it, Rambo!

217
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:53,040
Come on.

218
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:20,317
Take this. We go on from here.

219
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:24,196
Better I stay on to end.
- This is the end.

220
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:26,699
Come on.

221
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,243
Rambo!

222
00:41:30,745 --> 00:41:32,747
You not expendable.

223
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:58,356
Colonel, 3 minutes.

224
00:43:10,886 --> 00:43:12,221
That's Rambo!

225
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:20,229
Christ, he's found one!

226
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:52,887
Rambo's found one of ours!

227
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:58,726
The ground crew has what appears to be
an American POW with him.

228
00:43:59,727 --> 00:44:03,022
What did you say?
- They've got one of ours.

229
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:06,692
Yellow alert!
Meyers, Harrison, Goddell!

230
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:10,237
Everybody out! Move!

231
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:12,990
Go to your COMINT frequency!
Give me the mike!

232
00:44:15,826 --> 00:44:20,039
Dragonfly, here is Coach 1.
This is a priority order.

233
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:23,209
Come on!

234
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:29,757
Abort the operation immediately!

235
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:33,719
This is a recall. Confirm. Over.
- Say it again, Coach 1.

236
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:35,763
Abort the operation!

237
00:44:37,098 --> 00:44:41,060
I've been ordered to abort.
- But we've got them in sight!

238
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,145
Murdock, do you read?

239
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:50,027
We're going down.
- You're not going anywhere.

240
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:57,410
You damned mercenaries!
Those are our men down there!

241
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:01,747
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

242
00:45:08,754 --> 00:45:09,880
Colonel!

243
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:11,841
Down!

244
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:56,052
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?

245
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,929
Don't act so innocent, Colonel.

246
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,099
You had your suspicions,
which makes you a sort of accessory.

247
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:05,227
Don't ever
count me with you and your scum!

248
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:09,899
It was a lie, wasn't it.
Like the whole damned war. It was a lie.

249
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:11,942
What are you talking about?

250
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:15,112
That camp was supposed to be empty.

251
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:20,701
Rambo goes in, finds no POWs,
Congress buys it, case closed.

252
00:46:21,202 --> 00:46:26,540
And if he happens to get caught,
nobody knows except you.

253
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:29,585
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

254
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:36,092
A stinking bureaucrat who's trying to
cover his ass. - A nation's!

255
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:41,013
Besides, it was your hero's fault. If
he had done what he was meant to do,

256
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:45,976
we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.

257
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:50,648
And if those pictures showed something,
they'd have been lost.

258
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:53,609
You still don't understand
what this is all about.

259
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,654
Same as always: Money.

260
00:46:57,154 --> 00:47:00,282
In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in war reparation.

261
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:03,369
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

262
00:47:03,828 --> 00:47:06,580
And you're doing the same thing
all over again.

263
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:08,541
What would you do?

264
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:13,629
Pay ransom for our men and finance
the war effort against our allies?

265
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:16,757
And if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

266
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:22,096
Do you want to start the war over again
and bomb Hanoi?

267
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:28,519
You think the Senate's going to pay
billions for a few forgotten ghosts?

268
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,732
For men! Men who fought
for their country! - That's enough!

269
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:38,904
Trautman, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place.

270
00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:43,242
You bastard!
- And if I were you,

271
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:48,497
I'd not make the mistake of bringing it
up again. - You're making the mistake.

272
00:47:48,956 --> 00:47:50,458
Yes? What mistake?

273
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:53,169
Rambo.

274
00:48:52,937 --> 00:48:55,648
Damned Russian bastards.

275
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:22,091
He's dead now.

276
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:33,853
Bring him up!

277
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:54,999
The knife!

278
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:58,294
These people
are so vulgar in their methods!

279
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:01,672
They lack compassion.

280
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:07,803
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

281
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,807
I do not know who you are yet,

282
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:14,101
but I will.

283
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,103
Take him and clean him up.

284
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,390
That's all.

285
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:56,686
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

286
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:04,652
I see you are no stranger to pain.

287
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:08,656
Perhaps you have been
among my Vietnamese comrades before?

288
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:12,868
No answer?

289
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:16,455
Do you wish to give your name?

290
00:51:16,956 --> 00:51:20,209
What possible harm can that cause?

291
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:26,007
Pride is a poor substitute
for intelligence.

292
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:30,261
What you must understand
is that we must interrogate you.

293
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:36,934
For Sergeant Yushin you're a piece
of meat, a laboratory experiment.

294
00:51:37,393 --> 00:51:40,896
But for me you are a comrade,
similar to myself,

295
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:44,734
just opposed by an act of fate.

296
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:48,404
I know you were trying

297
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:53,284
to facilitate the release
of war criminals. I can appreciate this.

298
00:51:54,368 --> 00:51:58,414
But this incident, your capture, is...

299
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:01,625
...embarrassing.

300
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:04,128
We must have an explanation.

301
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:10,634
Radio your HQ and say that
you have been captured and condemned

302
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:17,433
for espionage, and that attempts like
these should not be made in the future,

303
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:22,563
or they
will meet with the same fate as you.

304
00:52:31,906 --> 00:52:33,407
Fuck you!

305
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:39,538
You wish to test your strength... Good.

306
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:45,711
Yushin!

307
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,481
Comrade, here is something

308
00:53:47,982 --> 00:53:51,110
that might be of interest to you:

309
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,364
A transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

310
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:59,201
and his commander that we intercepted.

311
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:04,999
"Dragonfly" and "Wolf's Den"...
Colorful names.

312
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,001
Here we are:

313
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:14,508
"We have them in sight". And the reply:
"Abort the operation immediately. "

314
00:54:15,926 --> 00:54:20,306
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over. "

315
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:26,103
It seems you were abandoned
by direct command.

316
00:54:26,604 --> 00:54:29,857
And these are the people
you protect with your pain!

317
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:32,943
Increase the voltage.

318
00:54:34,278 --> 00:54:38,282
You may scream. There is no shame.

319
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,816
You are strong! Very strong!

320
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:14,110
The strongest so far.

321
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,280
But you're nearly dead. Poor waif.

322
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:22,159
Make the radio call.

323
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:49,854
To talk, to obey
would be so much easier.

324
00:56:04,785 --> 00:56:08,039
Yushin
has a memento for you of this day.

325
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:32,521
Put it in his eye.

326
00:56:38,986 --> 00:56:43,282
If your own life
means nothing to you, perhaps his does.

327
00:56:43,783 --> 00:56:47,453
Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.

328
00:56:57,463 --> 00:56:58,798
Yes?

329
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,793
Don't do it!

330
00:57:38,045 --> 00:57:39,463
Do it

331
00:57:39,964 --> 00:57:41,382
now!

332
00:58:10,202 --> 00:58:13,247
Two-two-zero-five-six...

333
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,375
Lone Wolf receive.

334
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:20,421
This is Lone Wolf...

335
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:25,468
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.
Transmit location and status.

336
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:28,971
What is it?
- It's Rambo, Sir.

337
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:33,142
We read you,
Lone Wolf. What is your position? Over.

338
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:37,605
I say again:
What is your position? Over.

339
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:42,902
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

340
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:46,864
This is Trautman. Where are you?

341
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:53,037
Come in!

342
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:03,047
Murdock...

343
00:59:04,548 --> 00:59:06,092
He's here.

344
00:59:10,471 --> 00:59:12,890
Rambo, we're glad you're alive.

345
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:18,020
Where are you? Give us your position,
and we'll come to pick you up.

346
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:27,947
Murdock...

347
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,285
I'm coming to get you!

348
01:01:55,636 --> 01:01:56,887
Duck!

349
01:03:02,203 --> 01:03:03,412
This way.

350
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:43,703
We safe for now.

351
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:52,586
You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.

352
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:55,798
Maybe need this.

353
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,387
You hurt bad.
- It's alright.

354
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:09,687
Listen...

355
01:04:10,604 --> 01:04:13,691
What you did back there...

356
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:16,485
...I won't forget it.

357
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,196
Thanks.

358
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:23,242
What you do now?

359
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:26,120
Try get across through Thailand?

360
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,331
Yeah.
- Then go America?

361
01:04:36,422 --> 01:04:38,507
You take me with you?

362
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:51,228
You take me?

363
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:54,565
Yeah.

364
01:04:57,735 --> 01:04:59,612
I think you make good choice.

365
01:05:02,615 --> 01:05:04,200
We go?
- Let's go.

366
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,322
You alright?

367
01:05:57,003 --> 01:05:59,755
You... not... forget... me.

368
01:06:00,214 --> 01:06:01,465
No.

369
01:06:20,192 --> 01:06:22,319
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

370
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:28,784
You're risking everything. Do you think
one man's worth all that? - Yes.

371
01:06:29,243 --> 01:06:33,497
I order you to withdraw.
- I'll go over your head.

372
01:06:33,998 --> 01:06:38,336
You don't seem to understand that I'm
in charge here. You're just a tool.

373
01:06:39,712 --> 01:06:42,173
We're the machine.

374
01:06:42,673 --> 01:06:45,009
He's not to leave the base.

375
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:54,435
He never had a chance, did he?
- Like you said: He went home.

376
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:10,249
Get back.

377
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:17,590
Come on! To the chopper!

378
01:21:18,049 --> 01:21:19,175
Move!

379
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:21,761
To the chopper!

380
01:21:38,486 --> 01:21:39,987
Move!

381
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,146
You guys made it!

382
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:54,145
Chopper on your tail!

383
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:57,231
Hang on!

384
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:27,405
Hold on!

385
01:24:34,745 --> 01:24:35,997
Fire in the tail!

386
01:26:40,329 --> 01:26:42,415
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

387
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:47,169
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

388
01:26:47,878 --> 01:26:51,549
Wolf's Den,
this is Lone wolf, do you read?

389
01:26:54,301 --> 01:26:55,594
We hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

390
01:26:56,053 --> 01:27:00,808
Prepare for emergency landing.
Arriving with American POWs.

391
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:17,199
You heard. Prepare for landing of POWs!

392
01:28:34,026 --> 01:28:36,153
Glad you made it.

393
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,144
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

394
01:29:50,644 --> 01:29:52,772
I take them, just like you.

395
01:29:57,026 --> 01:30:00,905
I swear to God I didn't know
it was supposed to happen like this.

396
01:30:01,364 --> 01:30:04,200
It was just supposed
to be another assignment.

397
01:30:11,415 --> 01:30:12,458
Mission...

398
01:30:14,043 --> 01:30:15,753
...accomplished!

399
01:30:23,094 --> 01:30:25,429
You know there are more men out there.

400
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,015
You know where they are.

401
01:30:30,309 --> 01:30:33,938
Find them, or I'll find you!

402
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:00,715
Where are you going?

403
01:31:01,215 --> 01:31:02,883
I don't know.

404
01:31:04,552 --> 01:31:07,596
You'll get
a second Medal of Honor for this.

405
01:31:15,521 --> 01:31:20,109
They should give it to them.
They deserve it more.

406
01:31:21,444 --> 01:31:24,947
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.

407
01:31:25,448 --> 01:31:27,575
Come back to us.

408
01:31:28,784 --> 01:31:30,536
Back to what?

409
01:31:31,662 --> 01:31:34,206
My friends died here,

410
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:37,501
and part of me died here.

411
01:31:38,586 --> 01:31:44,133
The war may have been wrong,
but don't hate your country for it.

412
01:31:45,259 --> 01:31:46,218
Hate it?

413
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:49,138
I'd die for it!

414
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:52,933
What is it you want?

415
01:31:58,147 --> 01:31:59,982
I want

416
01:32:02,151 --> 01:32:04,153
what they want,

417
01:32:04,612 --> 01:32:07,823
and every other guy who came out here

418
01:32:08,324 --> 01:32:12,578
and spilt his guts
and gave everything he had:

419
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,957
For our country to love us

420
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:19,543
as much as we love it.

421
01:32:22,254 --> 01:32:24,006
That's what I want.

422
01:32:30,638 --> 01:32:34,433
How will you live, John?
- Day by day.
