1
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,767
David, are you in bed yet?

2
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:55,396
Yeah, I am.

3
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:58,274
Okay. Good night.
I love you.

4
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,068
I love you, too.

5
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:00,354
We'll have
more news here at your

6
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,148
all memories,
all music station

7
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:05,234
for St. Petersburg and Tampa
at the top of the hour.

8
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,403
Right now I'd like
to send out congratulations

9
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,280
to Thelma Miller
of Orient Park.

10
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:11,115
She was our
eighth caller yesterday

11
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,703
and collected $225
on our big money
memories jackpot.

12
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,705
Today, it could be you.

13
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,499
Oh, my.

14
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,417
My goodness.
Look at this.

15
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,170
Here you go, Alma.
Your little cart.

16
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:26,631
What a mess.
That'll do it.

17
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,508
Saltines.

18
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,344
And saltines.

19
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:34,222
Ex-Lax. You got my Ex-Lax.

20
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,643
Here you go, Bernie.
Hope you feel better.

21
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:40,937
Don't use that stuff.
Use prunes.

22
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,230
I use both.

23
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,319
Rose, I think these
must belong to you.

24
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:50,822
Thank you. I'm Rose.
Rose Lefkowitz.

25
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,156
I don't believe we've met.

26
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,866
This is Ben, Rose.

27
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,159
How do you do?

28
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,373
She remembers who I am,
she remembers who she is,
so we're doing okay.

29
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,083
Come on, Rose.

30
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:04,293
That's it.

31
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:08,089
Poor Rose.
She's really slipping.

32
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,009
Here we go. And...

33
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:13,261
Swing them to the left

34
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:15,388
Then you swing them
to the right

35
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:18,683
Then you do the twist
with all of your might

36
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:22,019
Truck on down
Let's go to town

37
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:24,522
And that's what
we call dancing

38
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:25,648
Let me hear it.

39
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,150
And that's what
we call dancing

40
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,779
Hit it.
That's much better.

41
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:35,658
Come on, ladies.
Pick them up.
Very good.

42
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,034
I mean,
I have to share everything.

43
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,870
Girls, that's wonderful.

44
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:42,206
I saw this, but I fell asleep.
So I don't know how it ends.

45
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,834
Shake your little shoulders
and get on down

46
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,462
Do the Susy-Q
That's good for you

47
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:50,923
And that's what
we call dancing

48
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:52,049
Let me hear it.

49
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:53,634
And that's
what we call dancing

50
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:55,887
Hey, Art. Art.

51
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,599
Come on over here.

52
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,767
I could use
some real men here.

53
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:03,352
If we see any,
we'll send them over.

54
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,564
Hit it.
Yes, yes.

55
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,901
Here we go. And...

56
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:11,319
Swing them to the left

57
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,404
You ever going
to do anything
about that one?

58
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:15,114
Already have.

59
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,242
Put it to her?

60
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:19,744
You're disgusting.

61
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,664
So then you haven't, huh?

62
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:24,749
What?

63
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,876
I say, "So then you haven't. "

64
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,672
Here you go, Pops.

65
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:34,175
Ben. I said one.

66
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:36,594
Walk on the wild side.

67
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:39,180
You boys still
trespassing over there?

68
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,057
Yep.

69
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:46,354
Hey, they're not
even melted yet. Wow.

70
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,565
Okay,
let's get a board
under her.

71
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,608
Let's get a pulse,
let's get a blood pressure.

72
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,611
I'll get a line.
No pulse.

73
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:55,696
Eighty over 50.
Keep pumping.

74
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:56,781
Ready!

75
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:58,574
Clear.
Now.

76
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,117
Is there a pulse
or a blood pressure?

77
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:02,787
Once more.
Everyone off now.

78
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:03,871
Is there a pulse?
No pulse.

79
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,207
Blood pressure?
No blood pressure.

80
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,541
All right.
Let's call it.

81
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,722
Well, what's the word?

82
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:23,265
What's the word on what?

83
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:25,768
The doctor.
That's what.

84
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,478
You went to the doctor.
Now, what'd he say?

85
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,147
It's a breeze.
Everything's fine.

86
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:31,565
Hey, wait a minute.

87
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,276
Wait right there.

88
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:38,322
This is me
you're talking to.

89
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:42,118
Now, you went to
the goddamn doctor.
Now, what did he say?

90
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,081
Doctors don't
know everything.

91
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:58,843
Well, there is
the one school
of thought

92
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:00,761
that says they don't
know nothing.

93
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,644
Well, gentlemen,
mission accomplished.

94
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,067
Hope the water
isn't too cold.

95
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,902
You want it
heated, too?

96
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:59,570
What about a lifeguard?

97
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,577
Well, the marines
have landed.

98
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,499
The navy's in.

99
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,003
Boy, that's cold.

100
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,463
You're right.

101
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,759
Ah!

102
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,804
Fellows, this is the life.

103
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,190
That'll make your old
ball sac shrivel up.

104
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:50,788
Well, all in all,
that was a pretty damn
crappy day at sea,

105
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:51,997
wasn't it, boys?

106
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,749
You stink.

107
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,000
Me?

108
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:57,461
Come on, man.
It's the great
unknown out there.

109
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:59,630
Here.
Here's half your money.

110
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,966
"Half"? What do you...
What is this "half"?

111
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,635
Bonner, you got my
goddamn money now?

112
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,262
Got it right here.
I got it right here.

113
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,805
I'll be with you
in a second, okay?

114
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,350
'Cause if you ain't
got it now,
you're not tying up here.

115
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,811
Look, I don't want
to get rough with you,
you know,

116
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:15,312
but I'm not taking half.

117
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:16,438
Fine. Give it.

118
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,315
What are you...
Get your hands off.

119
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,401
Just get your ass
off my boat, man.

120
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:21,694
Just get your
ass off my boat.

121
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:22,945
You believe this?

122
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,782
And take your embarrassing
beach towel with you.

123
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,993
Guy brings a beach towel.
You believe these tourists?

124
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:33,330
Guy throws up on the deck,
he doesn't catch one fish,
gives me half my money.

125
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,416
I need a brew.
You want something cold?

126
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,584
Untie the boat line.

127
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:39,003
No, wait a minute.
Don't untie the boat line.

128
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,213
Here you go, you bloodsucker.
I have nothing to live on.

129
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:42,882
Nothing. Zip.

130
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:49,263
Kirk, come on.
You're not actually gonna
take all my money, are you?

131
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,433
You're gonna leave me
with five bucks,
aren't you, Kirk?

132
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:54,393
Not on your life.

133
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:55,769
Shit!

134
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,771
Come on, Kirk. That money
will bring you no pleasure!

135
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,815
I promise you.
Can I have a word...

136
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,483
You just try
and sleep tonight!

137
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,777
I'll sleep like a baby.

138
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,155
Shit!

139
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,083
We'd like to
rent your boat.

140
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:19,210
You what?

141
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:21,795
We'd like to
rent your boat.

142
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,175
We'd like to rent
your boat for 27 days,

143
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,219
if that wouldn't be
too long for you.

144
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,638
No. Yeah.

145
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,724
Yeah? Twenty-seven?

146
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:38,896
That's my lucky number.
Holy smokes!

147
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,690
Hi. I'm Jack Bonner.
How you doing?

148
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,942
Hi, Jack. I'm Walter.

149
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,944
Hi. Hi, Walter.
Well, come on.

150
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,991
Yeah, take a look around.
Boat sleeps eight,

151
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:52,910
so you should be
pretty comfortable.

152
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:56,205
And if you've got
a latitude and a longitude,
I can get you there.

153
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,165
And if you don't,
I can still get you there.

154
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,960
We know a great dive spot,
and we have a map.

155
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,296
Great, great.

156
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,675
I guess we can
talk price later.

157
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,929
That door basically
slides back and forth.

158
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:15,140
It may need some oil.
I haven't dusted in a while,

159
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:18,769
but I'm gonna do
a whole cleanup,
a whole sanitation thing.

160
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,312
You know, if you look
at anything closely enough,

161
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,231
you're bound
to find some flaws.

162
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,275
I'm an experienced
scuba diver

163
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,819
and tour guide,
deep-sea fisherman,

164
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:30,155
who'll actually
eat tonight. Yes!

165
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:40,749
In the kitchen.
You're in the kitchen.

166
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:46,046
And my mother came
out on the porch,
and she was screaming...

167
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:47,506
Give it a rest, Rose.

168
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,467
"You stop
teasing your sister!"

169
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,428
Hiya, Grandpa.

170
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,679
There's the little fellow.

171
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,431
You come
right to the courts,
do you?

172
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,016
It's Thursday.

173
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,059
Knows our schedule.

174
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,562
Hi!

175
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:04,315
Hello, David.

176
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,025
He's always here.

177
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,985
Does this kid have
a home or what?

178
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,738
Bernie,
his parents are divorced.
His mother works.

179
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:14,575
Hey, I'm an orphan.
Do I go around
asking for breaks?

180
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:20,122
We're going swimming later.
We have room left
for one little boy.

181
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,875
And we might even have
a swimming suit for you.

182
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,294
I got mine on.

183
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,672
The navy could
use men like you.

184
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:37,848
The property's been
tied up in an estate now
for over three years.

185
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,434
And, of course,
they really want to sell.

186
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,895
They're not interested
in a long-term lease.

187
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:45,689
Well, we'd just
like the place for 26 days.

188
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:48,484
And we'll take it
in "as is" condition.

189
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,612
We're cousins.

190
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:54,490
We like to vacation
together informally.

191
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:58,410
As long as
there's a swimming pool,
we have everything we need.

192
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:03,290
$7,500 a month,
plus the pool man
and utilities.

193
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,918
We won't be needing
the pool man.

194
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:09,213
I prefer to do that myself.
They use so much chlorine.

195
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:11,131
My eyes are very sensitive.

196
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,050
But they're lovely.

197
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:14,510
Thank you.

198
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:19,681
The clubhouse
is closed, boys.

199
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,727
Well, maybe they'd
give us permission
to use the pool.

200
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,104
We could offer
to pay something.

201
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:27,898
Wouldn't be fun
if we had permission.

202
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:54,883
Jack, this is the chart
I was telling you about.

203
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,595
I estimate our position
is right about here,
at this point.

204
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,597
I want to get
down right along
this fault line.

205
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:01,765
Just south, right here.

206
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,142
Is this land?
What is this?

207
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:06,228
This is actually
an underwater
configuration map.

208
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,313
It's a heat-sensitive map.
I've seen these.

209
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:09,815
Yeah,
it's a brand-new
development.

210
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,859
The Japanese have this.

211
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:14,486
Yeah, that's right, Jack.
The Japanese.
They developed it.

212
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,363
So the point is to
head directly south

213
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,115
right along this line...
Sure.

214
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:20,617
...until we get right here
on the edge of
this fault line.

215
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:22,035
Perfect.
Can you figure that out?

216
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,788
Yeah. Actually,
I've been around here.

217
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,832
Why don't you keep this?
Okay. All right.

218
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,500
Go get some
sodas and sandwiches
and stuff.

219
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:29,585
Thanks, Jack.

220
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,878
Okay.

221
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:44,183
All right.
Let's start with line three.

222
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:46,226
"T, O, Z."

223
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:47,728
And the next line.

224
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,731
"L, P, E, O."

225
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:55,068
Try the next line.

226
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:03,952
"K, O, C... "

227
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:11,960
"K, O, C, F, E."

228
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,841
Sir, do you have
another pair of glasses?

229
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,385
I don't need
any other glasses,
young man.

230
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,222
These are my glasses.
I can read that fine.

231
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,599
Now you just
run the pointer.
All right?

232
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,145
Next line.

233
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:38,529
Sir, is there
anything on that line
you can read?

234
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:39,947
No.

235
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:44,326
But, young man,
remember, road signs
aren't made that small.

236
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,495
I can read road signs.

237
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,457
Okay.

238
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:54,962
I don't think it's fair.

239
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:57,714
I've driven
everything on wheels
all my life.

240
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,466
Never had a mishap.

241
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:07,224
Shit. How's your girlfriend?

242
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:10,185
She's not
my girlfriend.

243
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,271
She just followed me
home that one day.

244
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:14,731
I don't like her
at all.

245
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:15,857
You don't, huh?

246
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,236
Hi, Dad.
Hi, honey.

247
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,405
Hi, Mom.

248
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,115
Want to go out to dinner?

249
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,199
Yeah.

250
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,202
No Italian food.
Makes me fart.

251
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,329
Okay. I'll go get Mom.

252
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:32,082
You know,
you're gonna have to
make a friend your own age

253
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,209
one of these days.

254
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,503
I don't like
the kids my age.

255
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:38,422
I like to hang
around you guys.

256
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:39,798
Sure you like it here.

257
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,676
There's no pressure,
and we baby you.

258
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,178
It's just that
a lot more things bother
me than other guys.

259
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:46,763
They do, do they?

260
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,599
The trouble with you
is you think too much,

261
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:51,184
and that's when
a guy gets scared.

262
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,645
You know, Grandpa,
you're right.

263
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:56,440
I do get scared a lot.

264
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:58,525
Nobody likes being scared.

265
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:29,866
Hey, watch out.
Those dolphins
look pretty horny.

266
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,511
This is pretty big.

267
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,638
Yeah, pretty big.

268
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:53,223
You need a hand?

269
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:55,392
No. No. Thanks, Jack.
We're doing fine.

270
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:56,810
Excuse me.

271
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,154
What the hell is that?

272
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:08,780
Who cares?

273
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:11,783
You know what I bet?
I bet they're dope peddlers.

274
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:14,870
I'll bet they made
a pickup out at sea.

275
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,538
It's possible.

276
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,998
Should we tell somebody?

277
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,000
No.

278
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:29,384
Well, by golly,
if our new neighbors
are gonna do that,

279
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,928
I don't feel a bit bad
about sneaking in
their swimming pool

280
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:33,764
while they're gone.

281
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,140
Do you think it's safe?

282
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:36,767
What are they gonna do?
Arrest us?

283
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:39,227
Look at us. We're
three harmless old men.

284
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,522
Yeah, but who knows
what kind of people
they are?

285
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:50,739
You know, I can't
remember the last time
I really took a risk.

286
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:55,702
Ben's right. I'm in.

287
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,165
What the hell.

288
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,550
Look at that.

289
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:15,639
The water's really warm.

290
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:18,683
What the hell are those?

291
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:26,691
Listen to that.

292
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,203
They make me nervous.

293
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:43,667
If your friend Ben Luckett
decides to jump off

294
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,001
the top of
the Empire State Building,

295
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:47,671
does that mean
that you have to
do it, too?

296
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:49,881
I have my pride.

297
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,095
Well.

298
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,484
I feel great!

299
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,610
Me, too.

300
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:13,780
You wouldn't bullshit me.

301
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,825
My God,
I'm telling the truth.

302
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:21,705
Why shouldn't he feel good?
I feel tremendous!

303
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,623
I'm ready to
take on the world!

304
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,273
I'm in the mood for love

305
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:34,110
Simply because you're near me

306
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,406
You get a load
of this guy?

307
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:42,077
He'll be chasing them dolls
till his dick rots off.

308
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,454
I'm too old for
that kind of thing.

309
00:22:44,538 --> 00:22:46,456
Age isn't everything.

310
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,666
No, no.

311
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,084
Anyway,
it's all up here.

312
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,210
Sure, sure.

313
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:52,003
Not all up there, pal.

314
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:53,755
Some of it's down here.

315
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,925
Which, by the way,
is hard as a rock.

316
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,219
You, too?
You got a boner, too?

317
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:02,514
Blue steel.
Cat couldn't scratch it.

318
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:04,641
I thought I was
the only one.

319
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:11,231
We're in the mood for love

320
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:14,067
Simply because we've got one

321
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:34,504
You tired?

322
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:35,714
Aren't you?

323
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:40,510
I'm wide awake.

324
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:41,761
What's wrong?

325
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,514
Not a thing.

326
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,475
Art. It's so late.

327
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:32,270
Are you all right?

328
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:34,731
Some enchanted evening

329
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:42,072
You may see a stranger

330
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:44,824
Across a crowded room

331
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,596
Want a piece of candy,
little girl?

332
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,515
Ben!

333
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,016
Ben.

334
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,947
Pong.

335
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,826
Three. Ghost dragon.

336
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:34,207
Why is everybody
so quiet today?

337
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:37,001
You're all off
in another world
or something.

338
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,462
I was just
thinking to myself.

339
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:43,216
Me, too.
I was just thinking.

340
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,931
I feel so nice today,
I can't tell you.

341
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:15,415
Joe.

342
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,959
Let's go!

343
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:22,589
Morning. Morning.

344
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:23,715
Hi.

345
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:29,762
Shit. Excuse me.

346
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:36,394
Do you think there's
cocaine in that pool?

347
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:38,479
There might be.

348
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,197
What if we OD?

349
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:49,574
Well, we'll
keep an eye
on each other.

350
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:52,452
I'll watch him.
You watch him.
You watch me.

351
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,120
Perfect.

352
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:41,709
Stop!

353
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,724
Hey.

354
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,851
Hi.

355
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:42,812
Looks like you
got these things
pretty well-covered.

356
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:44,772
Looks airtight.

357
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:48,484
Jack, I can't tell you
what's inside there.

358
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:54,949
You know,
I'm the captain.

359
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:59,078
Technically speaking,
I have to know
what's in there.

360
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:02,498
Yeah, but what we're doing
is supposed to be a secret.

361
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,917
Kitty,
I took a maritime oath,

362
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,461
a maritime oath
that forbids me

363
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:09,339
to even reveal
your names to anybody.

364
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:13,009
All right. I'll tell you,
but you can't
let the others know

365
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,762
that I told you anything.

366
00:29:15,846 --> 00:29:17,555
They'd have to
torture me.

367
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:21,017
Not a lot of torture.
You know, not... But some.

368
00:29:23,604 --> 00:29:26,230
Nerita peloronta.

369
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:27,398
What?

370
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:29,317
Nerita peloronta.

371
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:32,028
What is that?

372
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:34,280
They're giant snail shells.

373
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:36,949
Hmm.

374
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:40,286
They're extremely rare.

375
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:43,289
We're gonna take them
to the Museum of
Ichthyology in Orlando.

376
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:45,041
Really?

377
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,709
Yeah, I've been
planning to go there.

378
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:48,795
I hear it's a great place,
a lot of fish.

379
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:56,177
God! God,
I think it's broken.
God damn it!

380
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,303
Let me help you.

381
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:59,055
Ice. Get something
cold on it.

382
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:00,431
Let me just look.

383
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:01,557
No, no. Don't.
Do not touch it.

384
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:03,351
I can... I can help you.

385
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,727
No. No, no.

386
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:14,904
That feels nice.

387
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:20,993
It's amazing.

388
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:26,082
Kitty, are you married?

389
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,250
No.

390
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:28,584
Involved?

391
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:29,752
No.

392
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:32,004
Come on.

393
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:34,424
Those guys are
so good-looking.

394
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:36,175
Not Walter, maybe,
but...

395
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:40,096
You don't have anything going
with one of those young guys?

396
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,598
I'm not involved
with anyone.

397
00:30:42,683 --> 00:30:43,933
Okay.

398
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:49,021
You know, we could go out
and do something sometime.

399
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:51,774
I don't know
if that's such
a good idea.

400
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:53,526
Why?

401
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,029
I'm not
like the other women
you've known.

402
00:30:57,114 --> 00:30:58,823
That's good news.

403
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:06,622
You're making me
very curious about you.

404
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:11,461
Well, what if I trusted you
with something very private?

405
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:13,713
I can keep a secret.
I won't tell anybody.

406
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:15,089
Not even our kids.

407
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:23,431
Look, I don't know
what you're thinking,

408
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:28,811
but if you're thinking
that I'm just
out to nail you,

409
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,481
that's not it at all.

410
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:35,026
I'd just like to
get to know you
as a human being.

411
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,825
Okay. I'll see you
in the morning.
All right?

412
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,410
What...

413
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:52,251
Yeah, I got...
I got some things
to do, too.

414
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:59,717
And they didn't
give you any other
medication at all

415
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,010
over at the home, huh?

416
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:03,095
Not a thing, Doc.

417
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,431
Well, Joe,
I gotta tell you,

418
00:32:05,516 --> 00:32:08,684
I have never seen
anything like this
before in my life.

419
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:11,562
It's a...
Well, it's a miracle.

420
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:13,439
It's a complete remission.

421
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:21,489
I just love to see
you eat your words,
Doc.

422
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,032
Want to arm-wrestle?

423
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,953
How about that?

424
00:32:55,482 --> 00:32:56,524
Alma's not gonna believe it.

425
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,734
You got them, huh?

426
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:01,153
Come on.
Let's go, shall we?

427
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:23,843
I'm gonna go ahead
and assume goodwill.

428
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:26,470
I'm gonna assume
mental illness.

429
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:30,057
I didn't expect it.
It's such a surprise.

430
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:33,853
I don't know how to do it.
I didn't buy it.
It's just beautiful.

431
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,235
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

432
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,988
We start our second session
of dancing right now.

433
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:48,326
And our first tune is
a special arrangement
of Dancing in the Dark.

434
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:51,329
Let's waste no time.

435
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:28,574
Why don't we dance?

436
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:30,201
What? Sure.

437
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:50,429
Bernie, Bernie, Bernie.

438
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:52,473
What am I going
to do with you?

439
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,393
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

440
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,061
Well, you're not
going to dance with me.

441
00:34:57,145 --> 00:35:00,272
That's for sure.
That's for sure.

442
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:06,028
Happy birthday!
Many more!
Thank you.

443
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:11,409
You're a wonderful dancer.

444
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:13,661
I think so.

445
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,788
I'm very happy, Bess.

446
00:35:16,623 --> 00:35:19,041
Everything's
happening so fast.

447
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,502
Are you talking
about last night?

448
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,255
No, no.
Last night was fine.

449
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,340
Fine?

450
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:27,758
More than fine.

451
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,218
Terrific.

452
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,388
I was talking in general.

453
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:37,309
Well, in general,
I think we're
having a great time.

454
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:40,646
Yes, we are.

455
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:45,276
Will you still love me
when I can't
keep up with you?

456
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,904
Of course. I love you now,
and you can't keep up with me.

457
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,323
You are a pain in the ass.

458
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:10,009
"There's going to be a problem
in the fuel injection system
if you let... "

459
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:12,887
What does this do?

460
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:48,547
Reduced to a goddamn
Peeping Tom now, Bonner?

461
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:50,257
It's embarrassing.

462
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:56,615
Holy shit.

463
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:20,848
What's the problem, Jack?

464
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,474
She's not normal.

465
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:27,813
There's something
very abnormal about her.

466
00:38:33,737 --> 00:38:36,655
Come on. Come on. Come on.

467
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:40,910
Son of a bitch!

468
00:38:42,746 --> 00:38:44,330
All right.

469
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,422
Come on! Start! Go!

470
00:38:55,884 --> 00:38:57,927
I've put all kinds of
people on this boat.

471
00:38:58,011 --> 00:39:00,220
All kinds, all races.
Come on.

472
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,973
All nationalities,
all creeds!

473
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:06,268
I... Oh, my God!
I can't believe
it won't start!

474
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:15,235
Oh, my God.

475
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:34,296
It's... It's hard
to know who to trust,
isn't it, Jack?

476
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:40,594
Oh, my God! God.

477
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:57,403
I'm in the water,
far from shore.

478
00:39:58,321 --> 00:40:00,239
It's at night.

479
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:03,575
They've got my boat. Shit.

480
00:40:13,086 --> 00:40:14,962
Good to see you again, Jack.

481
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:17,131
Let me give you a hand.
I don't want your hand.

482
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,173
Come on, Jack.

483
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:19,383
Get back! Get back!

484
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,635
You get back!

485
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:30,686
No. Just put...
Put the towel down.

486
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:34,106
Just put it down
and back away, please.

487
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:40,571
Jack,
I'm sure you're bothered
by what you've seen,

488
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:41,697
but if you'll just relax...

489
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:43,198
Well, I don't
want to relax.

490
00:40:43,283 --> 00:40:44,283
Why don't you let us explain?

491
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,744
'Cause I don't want
to know anything.

492
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:50,039
And if you try
to eat my face off
or take over my body,

493
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:51,206
you're gonna be
very sorry, mister!

494
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,833
You're gonna be
very sorry!

495
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:56,545
Face-eating, Jack?

496
00:40:56,629 --> 00:41:00,549
I've never heard of that.
Is that some sort of delicacy?

497
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:03,552
No. Forget I ever
mentioned it.

498
00:41:03,636 --> 00:41:04,803
Are you sure
I shouldn't try it,
Jack?

499
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:06,388
I'm positive.

500
00:41:06,473 --> 00:41:08,932
Walter, Jack is our friend.
Right, Jack?

501
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,517
Friend. Friend!
That's right.

502
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,561
Friend, 100%.
I'm your friend.

503
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:15,147
That's all
I ever wanted to be.
I want to be your friend.

504
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:16,732
Well, we do owe
you an explanation.

505
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:18,567
No, you don't
owe me anything.

506
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:20,736
All right. You know,
not even for the boat.

507
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,863
Honestly, it's free.

508
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,575
Jack.
Of course we're gonna pay you
for the boat. We're honest.

509
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,243
Of course you're honest.

510
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:31,288
Did I ever accuse you
of being dishonest?

511
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:34,958
I accused you of
being from another planet,
but an honest planet.

512
00:41:35,043 --> 00:41:37,252
Jack. Jack, sit down.

513
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:38,337
I don't wanna sit down.

514
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:40,422
Jack, sit!

515
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,931
Now, Jack, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

516
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,975
We're Antareans.

517
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,936
We come from
a planet called Antarea.

518
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,313
Yeah, that's what I
pretty much figured.

519
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:59,024
About 100 centuries ago,
we had an outpost here
on Earth,

520
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:00,901
before the first upheaval.

521
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,402
I think I'm better off
not knowing.

522
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:08,283
Now, we were
able to evacuate everyone
except for my ground crew.

523
00:42:08,368 --> 00:42:10,119
Ground crew?

524
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:11,662
And now we've
come back for them.

525
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:19,002
Boy, you know,
I thought I'd been around.
I...

526
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:20,921
Nothing like this
has ever happened
to me before.

527
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:25,968
Jack, you could turn us in,
or perhaps you
could do something else

528
00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:28,220
that would make
things difficult for us,

529
00:42:28,304 --> 00:42:32,724
but, believe me, Jack,
we will still
get our friends back.

530
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:35,561
And the only thing
that would happen

531
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:38,605
is we'd end up renting
someone else's boat.

532
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:48,407
You know,
I got left behind once.

533
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:51,910
It was in Coney Island.
I was nine.

534
00:42:51,995 --> 00:42:54,037
It was pretty heavy
for a nine-year-old.

535
00:42:54,747 --> 00:42:56,039
My parents finally
came back for me.

536
00:42:56,124 --> 00:42:57,166
Of course.

537
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,250
Yeah.

538
00:42:58,334 --> 00:42:59,418
And now we've come back.

539
00:42:59,502 --> 00:43:01,962
So that's what you're doing?
You're coming back for your
friends?

540
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,797
Exactly.

541
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:08,051
Jack, this is
the most important thing
we've ever done.

542
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:16,143
You're not gonna hurt me,
are you, Walt?

543
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,521
All we need to do
is to get our friends
and leave.

544
00:43:20,106 --> 00:43:21,773
And go...

545
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:24,818
Yes.

546
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,111
Right.

547
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:30,532
None of this is bad
for America, I guess.

548
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:32,159
Of course not.

549
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,955
Well, damn it, I'm in!

550
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,210
This is...
This is incredible.

551
00:43:42,128 --> 00:43:45,172
Right. Now listen,
tell me, nothing's gonna
fall off right now, is it?

552
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,590
No.

553
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:50,219
Come on, Mr. Lefkowitz.

554
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,887
You'll be a new man,
Bernie. Believe me.

555
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:54,556
Remember, I said...
I said I'd look.
Grab there.

556
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,350
I'm not promising
I'll get wet.

557
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:57,976
Fine. Just look.

558
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:01,396
By the way, right here
is where a crime
is being committed.

559
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:03,774
Not by me,
because I'm being carried.

560
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:06,068
Don't you worry, Bernie.
We'll take the fall for you.

561
00:44:06,152 --> 00:44:07,569
Fall, fall.
That's another thing.

562
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:10,656
I fall, I break my hip,
I can't sue anybody.

563
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:17,788
It's nice and warm, Bernie.

564
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,498
They're rocks.

565
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,668
What are rocks
doing in a pool?

566
00:44:24,504 --> 00:44:28,173
In an ocean, fine.
There I expect to see
plenty of rocks,

567
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:29,883
but in a pool?

568
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,510
No.

569
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,646
Cowardly, cowardly custard,
can't cut the mustard!

570
00:44:44,524 --> 00:44:46,358
Come on, Bernie!

571
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:56,076
And it's Joe-Joe
taking the lead.

572
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:59,955
Come on! Come on!

573
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,957
Come on,
you worn-out old pusses.

574
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,625
Dig, dig, dig, dig!

575
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:05,836
I'll see you tomorrow.

576
00:45:11,217 --> 00:45:13,302
Hey, fellows!
Fellows! Fellows!

577
00:45:13,386 --> 00:45:15,595
Hey! Somebody's coming!

578
00:45:15,722 --> 00:45:17,055
Get out.
Let's get
the hell out of here.

579
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,266
Let's get out of here.
Come on!

580
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,642
Come on.
Get a move on.

581
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:21,935
Hurry.

582
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,186
Come on in here.

583
00:47:25,852 --> 00:47:27,936
Out of the way!
Let's move!

584
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:29,771
Jesus!

585
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:30,939
Let's move!
Come on! Quick!

586
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:33,400
Come on.
Open the fucking door!

587
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,903
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Let's go!

588
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,991
Come on! Quick!

589
00:47:50,376 --> 00:47:52,461
I begged you not to go.

590
00:47:52,545 --> 00:47:54,129
You've got
to do something.

591
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:56,590
There are things
from outer space
next door.

592
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,633
You gents just keep
sucking on that oxygen,

593
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:01,011
they'll probably go back
to their own planet.

594
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:02,971
Get the police, you idiots.

595
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:04,264
Hey, look.

596
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,641
I'm not calling no cops
because a couple of geezers

597
00:48:06,726 --> 00:48:09,436
saw some people
from outer space.

598
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,105
If my husband said
he saw people from
outer space,

599
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,732
they were from outer space!

600
00:48:13,816 --> 00:48:15,734
Get the goddamn police!

601
00:48:15,818 --> 00:48:17,194
Okay.

602
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:20,822
Call the police.

603
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:29,331
They... They must have
concocted this crazy story

604
00:48:29,415 --> 00:48:30,582
to cover themselves.

605
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,209
Spacemen, you say?
Yeah.

606
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,502
That's wonderful.

607
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:35,462
Well, we'll all be
that old someday.

608
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:36,546
If we're lucky.

609
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:37,839
Yeah.

610
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:39,341
We're gonna shoot on
over to the home there

611
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:40,675
and straighten
this whole thing out.

612
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,385
Well, I wouldn't
be too hard on them.

613
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:43,845
Just tell them that
as long as they're

614
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,640
willing to respect our
privacy in the future,

615
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,099
we won't press charges.

616
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:49,267
We'll keep them on
their side of the fence.

617
00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:50,352
I appreciate it.

618
00:48:50,436 --> 00:48:51,520
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

619
00:48:51,604 --> 00:48:53,605
My pleasure. Bye-bye.

620
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,949
Well, I guess
we shouldn't
be greedy about it.

621
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:07,744
We're better off
than before we found it.

622
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:10,705
Bess said
we should take it to
the National Enquirer.

623
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,333
They pay money for
this kind of story.

624
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,378
I wish I had
the guts to go in.

625
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:17,712
Yeah.

626
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:21,675
Well, I wish I never even
knew about this place.

627
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:42,195
What time is it?

628
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:44,155
Just after 4:00.

629
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:28,116
I'm gonna go talk to them.

630
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,702
God damn it.
It's ridiculous.

631
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,311
You're Walter.

632
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:01,066
Well, I'm not
surprised you're here.

633
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,818
There's something
in that pool out there

634
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:05,987
that a friend of ours
just has to have.

635
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:09,199
Matter of fact,
there's a few of us
could use a little of it.

636
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:10,992
Well,
we don't care who you are
or where you've been,

637
00:51:11,077 --> 00:51:14,245
what you're doing,
what you're up to.

638
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,623
We sure need that pool.

639
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,251
Look, Ben,

640
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:24,756
I know you're
just trying to
help your people.

641
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,717
Well, I'm trying
to help mine.

642
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,806
No. See, my friend,
Joe Finley, he's got cancer.

643
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:39,020
I'm trying to
save his life.

644
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:44,609
I'm trying to save 20 lives,
and I'm running out of time.

645
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:51,700
Ain't a son of
a bitch in the world

646
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:53,243
has to know
we're in that pool.

647
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:56,621
We'll just be a few old farts
puddling around in that pool.

648
00:51:56,706 --> 00:51:58,665
Who's gonna know?

649
00:52:11,804 --> 00:52:15,515
Every 10,000 or 11,000
years or so,
I make a terrible mistake.

650
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:21,938
The last one
was when I picked
what you call Atlantis

651
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:23,231
as our base here on Earth.

652
00:52:23,315 --> 00:52:27,527
Everyone else said,
"Use the North Pole. "
I said, "No. Too cold. "

653
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,197
Sinking never
occurred to me.

654
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,700
You're gonna
let us use the pool,
aren't you?

655
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:36,578
You won't touch
those cocoons?

656
00:52:36,662 --> 00:52:39,789
No. No. I swear.

657
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,877
Use the pool.

658
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:49,090
Thank you. Thank you.

659
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,267
I, for one,
don't believe this
alien crap at all.

660
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:00,435
You don't believe
your husband?

661
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:01,478
No.

662
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:02,771
Well, I believe Joe.

663
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:04,731
I believe him,
and I'm scared.

664
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:07,066
I don't believe it,
and I'm still scared.

665
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,068
I guess I'm just less
gullible than you guys.

666
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:11,029
Mary, you have your nerve
calling me gullible.

667
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:12,781
I have more horse sense
than you'll ever have.

668
00:53:12,865 --> 00:53:15,950
Ladies, ladies,
let's just go and
see for ourselves.

669
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:17,202
Come on.

670
00:53:17,286 --> 00:53:20,121
All right.
Let's meet the aliens.

671
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:23,082
I hate to go visiting
without a plate of cookies,

672
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,542
a box of candy or something.

673
00:53:24,627 --> 00:53:25,627
We're going home.

674
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:26,961
Will you
cut it out, Bernie?

675
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:28,671
Well,
we have permission,
don't we?

676
00:53:28,756 --> 00:53:30,131
Those people aren't people.

677
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:31,800
I'm not gonna have
anything to do with them.

678
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:33,343
Pipe down.

679
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:36,262
You're playing
with fire over there.

680
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:38,807
I'm a citizen.
I believe in this country,

681
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:41,684
and I'm thinking of
blowing the whistle
on the whole goddamn deal.

682
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:43,812
Come on, Rose.
Stop right there.

683
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:45,605
What? What?

684
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,441
Stop thinking about yourself.
We're doing this for Joe.

685
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:51,653
Joe? Is Joe above the law?
Yeah.

686
00:53:51,737 --> 00:53:53,613
Are any of us?

687
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:57,742
In 1948, Dutch Schultz
walked into my store,

688
00:53:57,827 --> 00:53:58,910
and he said to me...
Dutch Schultz!

689
00:53:58,994 --> 00:54:00,036
Bernie. Bernie, shut up.

690
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,287
Let me tell you
about what Dutch said...

691
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:03,873
Bernie. Bernie!

692
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:06,125
If you don't want
to do this for Rose,

693
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,169
if you don't want to
do it for yourself,
that's fine,

694
00:54:08,254 --> 00:54:09,587
that's your business.

695
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:10,839
But if you screw it up
for the rest of us...

696
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:12,006
Don't threaten me, Joe.

697
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:13,633
I don't want any
of your threats.

698
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,677
Bernie, please.

699
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:17,887
Let her come with us
just this once.

700
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:19,681
No, no. Never.

701
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:23,142
Rose and I will never
set foot over there again.

702
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:25,770
Nature dealt us
our hand of cards,
and we played them.

703
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:27,021
Now, at the end of the game,

704
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:30,567
suddenly you're looking to
reshuffle the deck, huh?

705
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,445
Come on, Rose.
Come on. Let's go.

706
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:46,624
Anybody have
second thoughts?

707
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:49,711
Not me.

708
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:51,296
I'm a citizen, too.

709
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:54,048
I was in the navy.

710
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:55,884
I don't see
anything wrong with it.

711
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,969
Then you drive.

712
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:01,139
I got no license.

713
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,178
Hey, are
your extraterrestrials

714
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:42,680
gonna make
a personal appearance?

715
00:55:43,182 --> 00:55:45,767
Hey, Pills.
Come on in.

716
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:50,813
Hi, Pillsbury.
How you doing, pal?

717
00:55:50,898 --> 00:55:53,900
You'll like Pillsbury.
He's a fine fellow.

718
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:09,666
All right.
Let's start here.

719
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,543
"P, E, Z, O, L, C, F, T, D."

720
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:17,966
Sir, what line
are you reading?

721
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,093
The bottom one.

722
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:23,012
We're in a little
bit of a hurry, okay?

723
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:43,449
Look, look, look.
We gotta go into the club!

724
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:48,955
I'm gonna take you higher
than you ever

725
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,167
I'm gonna bring you
closer to the river

726
00:56:53,252 --> 00:56:57,672
I'm gonna touch you
Feel you with a thunder

727
00:56:57,756 --> 00:57:00,550
I'm gonna bring you
closer to my life

728
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:05,346
You're like gravity
pulling me

729
00:57:05,431 --> 00:57:09,392
Gravity pulling me

730
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:11,769
There you go!

731
00:57:14,273 --> 00:57:18,026
Gravity pulling me

732
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,819
Pulling me

733
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,498
Mutual affection

734
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,667
Molecular reaction

735
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,669
For every action

736
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:39,047
There's an opposite reaction

737
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:43,176
Modification
Love and variation

738
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,721
First constellation
Needful simulation

739
00:57:47,056 --> 00:57:50,683
Gravity pulling me

740
00:57:51,393 --> 00:57:55,146
Gravity pulling me

741
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,400
You're like gravity
pulling me

742
00:58:00,152 --> 00:58:02,737
Gravity pulling me

743
00:58:04,073 --> 00:58:06,115
Pulling me

744
00:58:12,164 --> 00:58:13,664
Hey, grandpa!

745
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:20,588
Look at the old fogey!

746
00:58:23,342 --> 00:58:25,343
Off the floor, grandpa.

747
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,054
Pulling me

748
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:32,308
Gravity pulling me

749
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:36,729
You're like gravity
pulling me

750
00:58:37,356 --> 00:58:41,067
Gravity pulling me

751
00:58:41,193 --> 00:58:43,111
Pulling me

752
00:58:43,862 --> 00:58:47,615
I've been to
all of the stars in the sky

753
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:52,620
And I still can't believe it
Love conquers all

754
00:58:56,959 --> 00:59:00,878
Gravity pulling me

755
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,007
Gravity pulling me

756
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:09,887
You're like gravity
pulling me

757
00:59:09,972 --> 00:59:14,350
Gravity pulling me

758
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:25,778
Any residents requiring
weekend transportation

759
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:27,238
into St. Petersburg

760
00:59:27,322 --> 00:59:30,741
contact Miss Lerner
in her office by 1:00 today.

761
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:35,329
Hey! Hey!

762
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:38,666
I want to talk to you two!

763
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,588
The word on the corridor
is that you dudes

764
00:59:43,672 --> 00:59:47,133
are on to
some kind of
rejuvenation.

765
00:59:51,346 --> 00:59:52,930
What?

766
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,683
You know what
I'm talking about.

767
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:57,059
No, we don't.

768
00:59:58,228 --> 00:59:59,687
We wish we could help you.

769
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:02,356
Your wife been climbing trees
for a long time?

770
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:06,694
She climbs one
every once in a while.

771
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:08,654
Once in a great while.

772
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:09,989
That's right.

773
01:01:16,265 --> 01:01:20,184
You know,
whenever I'm around you,
I feel really good.

774
01:01:21,186 --> 01:01:24,272
Really good.
Do I do that to you?

775
01:01:24,356 --> 01:01:25,898
It happens.

776
01:01:28,568 --> 01:01:31,320
Do you ever want to
do anything about it?

777
01:01:31,405 --> 01:01:34,365
Well, not the way
you think about it.

778
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:39,328
I mean, I can't.

779
01:01:40,747 --> 01:01:42,373
Right.

780
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,375
Right.

781
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,753
Well, how does an Antarean

782
01:01:50,882 --> 01:01:52,800
express affection?

783
01:01:54,886 --> 01:01:56,178
We share ourselves.

784
01:01:56,263 --> 01:01:57,555
All right!

785
01:01:58,223 --> 01:02:00,224
Do you want to try it?

786
01:02:03,228 --> 01:02:05,438
It's very fulfilling.

787
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:03,788
Don't touch me.

788
01:03:04,456 --> 01:03:07,708
Don't touch you?
What's the big deal?

789
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:09,585
All right. I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

790
01:03:09,669 --> 01:03:11,837
You're not
my first Antarean.

791
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,297
I'm not naming names...
Jack...

792
01:03:13,382 --> 01:03:14,382
But...

793
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:16,592
Go to the other
side of the pool.

794
01:03:21,306 --> 01:03:23,140
I hope you're not
gonna take your skin off,

795
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:26,394
because I really like
skin on a woman.

796
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:38,549
If this is foreplay,
I'm a dead man.

797
01:04:44,973 --> 01:04:46,307
Three strikes!

798
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:49,560
Three strikes!
I knocked them down.

799
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:54,148
You have
marvelous form.

800
01:04:54,232 --> 01:04:55,483
I've bowled with
a lot of women.

801
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:56,984
You have a great potential.

802
01:04:57,068 --> 01:05:01,155
You know, you seem like
you're having a grand time.
I know I am.

803
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:03,199
Joe, you'll never
bowl another game
like that

804
01:05:03,283 --> 01:05:04,366
as long as you live.

805
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:06,368
Don't count on it.
I may turn professional.

806
01:05:06,453 --> 01:05:07,536
Yeah, sure.

807
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:09,163
What's next?
What's next?
What's next?

808
01:05:09,247 --> 01:05:10,748
Let's have a party!

809
01:05:10,832 --> 01:05:12,791
A party. I'm for that.

810
01:05:12,876 --> 01:05:16,128
You bring the hot dog
And I'll bring the bun

811
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:18,255
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

812
01:05:20,008 --> 01:05:21,133
What?

813
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:22,760
Look at you goddamn people.

814
01:05:22,844 --> 01:05:25,137
I mean, I think this
is a serious mistake.

815
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:27,473
What are you talking about?
A mistake about what?

816
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,016
Well, you know,
I promised Walter

817
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,393
we'd keep it a secret,
and look at this.

818
01:05:31,478 --> 01:05:35,105
Yeah. Let's not have
too much fun, everybody.

819
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:37,316
Remember, we're old.

820
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,569
Not for me.
I'm gonna enjoy
everything.

821
01:05:40,654 --> 01:05:41,695
You do that.

822
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,863
Where to next, Ben?

823
01:05:42,948 --> 01:05:44,073
Home.

824
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:45,741
Come on. Live a little.

825
01:05:45,825 --> 01:05:47,368
Joe, Joe, Joe.
Everybody.

826
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:48,827
Let's go home.
Get in, darling.

827
01:05:48,912 --> 01:05:50,371
But I'm not ready
to go home yet.

828
01:05:50,455 --> 01:05:52,289
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

829
01:05:52,374 --> 01:05:54,291
What's happening
suddenly?

830
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:57,086
Well, I'll go with you, Joe.

831
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,629
No, you go on home.

832
01:05:58,713 --> 01:06:00,339
I may have a drink or two.

833
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:04,134
Will you keep
that for me?

834
01:06:07,222 --> 01:06:10,391
So, good night,
you worriers.

835
01:06:10,475 --> 01:06:13,143
Boy! Talk about
wet blankets!

836
01:06:14,187 --> 01:06:16,105
Hey, I'll be fine.

837
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,406
I still can't
believe I did that.

838
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,074
I always liked chocolate.

839
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:11,869
I'll try not to dump
anything on you tonight.

840
01:07:11,953 --> 01:07:14,038
I mean, I can't promise,
but I'll try.

841
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:38,729
Alma...

842
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:43,025
It's the pool.
It's having an effect...

843
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:44,818
It's not the pool.
It's not the water.

844
01:07:44,903 --> 01:07:47,154
It's not the first time.

845
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:52,493
Alma, you're overreacting.

846
01:07:52,577 --> 01:07:54,161
I knew. I always knew.

847
01:07:54,245 --> 01:07:56,830
I just
pretended to be stupid,
and I guess I really was.

848
01:07:56,915 --> 01:07:58,749
No!
But you're the stupid one.

849
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,126
Because things have
been so good between us.

850
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:03,170
Nothing's changed, Alma.
Go home, Joe.

851
01:08:03,254 --> 01:08:07,675
Don't make yourself
look any more ridiculous
than you already are.

852
01:08:07,759 --> 01:08:12,137
I'm happy you're
going to live, Joe,
but I've got to live, too.

853
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:32,634
Joe. Joe. Try to relax.

854
01:09:33,219 --> 01:09:35,804
Hey. Are you up
for a swim, maybe?

855
01:09:36,848 --> 01:09:38,348
Well, sure.

856
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,226
The pool! The pool!

857
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:43,353
Can't you think
about anything else?

858
01:09:43,438 --> 01:09:45,856
If you and Rose
would just come with us,
you'd feel differently.

859
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,442
We don't want to
feel differently.
We like the way we feel.

860
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:50,527
She needs it, Bernie.

861
01:09:51,362 --> 01:09:53,530
We...
We should discuss
this later.

862
01:09:53,615 --> 01:09:55,616
There is nothing
to discuss!

863
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,367
Because you're
a hardhead, Bernie.

864
01:09:57,452 --> 01:09:59,203
You're the most
frightened man
I ever knew.

865
01:09:59,287 --> 01:10:00,954
Christ, I don't
have to listen
to you.

866
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:03,499
If you sit at this table,
you damn well do!

867
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:06,794
You think you're
in such great shape,
Finley?

868
01:10:06,878 --> 01:10:09,963
Your marriage is
what's terminally ill
now!

869
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:12,674
You really
are an old bastard.

870
01:10:12,759 --> 01:10:15,219
"Old" is right.
I don't want to
be young again.

871
01:10:15,303 --> 01:10:17,679
Your life is a mess
because of
the fountain of youth!

872
01:10:17,764 --> 01:10:19,473
I don't care how healthy
you think you are!

873
01:10:19,557 --> 01:10:20,516
Sit down!

874
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,810
We don't want any part
of that goddamn pool house!

875
01:10:22,894 --> 01:10:25,896
You can keep
the goddamn
fountain of youth!

876
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:29,107
No wonder your wife
has no use for you.

877
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:30,400
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

878
01:10:30,485 --> 01:10:32,152
Joe! Joe!

879
01:10:32,237 --> 01:10:33,570
Hey!

880
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,540
Joe! Don't! Joe! Joe!

881
01:10:44,624 --> 01:10:46,041
Joe!

882
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:52,339
It's next door, isn't it?

883
01:10:52,423 --> 01:10:54,299
It's in that pool
over there, right?

884
01:10:55,802 --> 01:10:58,929
Get to that pool!
Get out of the way!

885
01:11:49,063 --> 01:11:51,064
What is...

886
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:53,317
Oh, my God.
What do we do?

887
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:54,526
Ben?

888
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,571
Please, out of the pool.

889
01:11:57,655 --> 01:11:59,031
Come on, come on!
Everybody out!

890
01:12:04,203 --> 01:12:06,121
Come on!
Get out of there!

891
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:08,749
We have no
business being here!

892
01:12:11,044 --> 01:12:13,712
Come on!
Out of the water!
Get out!

893
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,381
You don't understand.
We're trespassing.

894
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:20,052
Stop! Everybody out!

895
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:24,681
You have no right to be here.
You are trespassing here.

896
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:31,772
Put down the cocoon.

897
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:34,399
I said put down that cocoon!

898
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:37,486
Put it down. Put it down.

899
01:12:38,196 --> 01:12:40,030
I'm calling the police.

900
01:12:40,114 --> 01:12:42,741
Get out!
All of you, get out!

901
01:14:22,717 --> 01:14:26,219
All this time to
energize the pool.

902
01:14:26,304 --> 01:14:29,890
Now the life force
is completely drained
from the water.

903
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:36,438
I'm not gonna be able
to bring them back.

904
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:50,660
When Max saw me
in that sweater

905
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:55,082
with the mouton collar
and the ivory buttons,

906
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:59,586
he said,
"Rose, where the hell
did you get that sweater?"

907
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:04,007
I stayed mum,

908
01:15:05,176 --> 01:15:07,677
because I knew you stole it.

909
01:15:10,056 --> 01:15:12,516
But you stole it for me.

910
01:15:14,227 --> 01:15:17,312
Max never stole
anything for me,

911
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:22,067
and never made anything
as beautiful as
that mouton collar.

912
01:15:26,614 --> 01:15:29,783
Max couldn't do
anything with his hands,

913
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:32,536
except when they
were all over me.

914
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:39,209
And you wouldn't even
kiss my cheek without asking.

915
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:47,759
Dumping Max was
the smartest move
I ever made.

916
01:15:55,059 --> 01:15:57,185
Bernie.

917
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:04,568
Time for your medicine.
I'll get it.

918
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:27,048
Here you are.

919
01:16:28,593 --> 01:16:30,010
Rose.

920
01:16:32,346 --> 01:16:35,432
Rose? Are you asleep?

921
01:16:37,602 --> 01:16:38,894
Rose.

922
01:16:44,442 --> 01:16:46,443
Rose?

923
01:16:47,987 --> 01:16:49,988
Rose.

924
01:16:58,414 --> 01:16:59,789
Rose.

925
01:17:04,712 --> 01:17:06,129
Rose.

926
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:10,634
I'm so sorry.

927
01:18:06,607 --> 01:18:08,483
Can you help me?

928
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:13,196
I have to do
something for her.
She... She...

929
01:18:14,782 --> 01:18:18,118
The pool doesn't
work anymore.

930
01:18:18,202 --> 01:18:19,619
It's too late.

931
01:18:19,704 --> 01:18:22,330
I'll give you
everything I've got.

932
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:27,919
I'm sorry, Bernie.

933
01:18:29,714 --> 01:18:32,757
I wish I could help you.
It's just too late.

934
01:18:38,889 --> 01:18:40,390
Rosie.

935
01:18:42,977 --> 01:18:44,686
Rosie.

936
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:47,832
Hello, Ben.
Walter.

937
01:19:48,626 --> 01:19:51,753
I thought maybe
you guys had got the hell
out of here already

938
01:19:51,837 --> 01:19:53,713
after what happened today.

939
01:19:53,798 --> 01:19:56,549
I came by to tell you
I'm sorry, Walter.

940
01:19:56,634 --> 01:20:00,512
I...
I know we let you down,
and I'm really sorry.

941
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:17,028
I had never
experienced the pain

942
01:20:19,365 --> 01:20:23,535
and the grief
associated with
death before.

943
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:28,164
I've never had anyone
close to me who died.

944
01:20:35,005 --> 01:20:37,632
Walter,
these things out here,

945
01:20:38,509 --> 01:20:41,886
can you take
them back with you
on that spaceship?

946
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:46,057
No. They would never
survive the flight.

947
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:50,145
Well, can you put them
back in the ocean?

948
01:20:52,356 --> 01:20:54,524
Two are gone now.

949
01:20:57,194 --> 01:20:59,529
Two of my friends are gone.

950
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:05,118
We don't have the time
to get them all
back into the ocean.

951
01:21:05,202 --> 01:21:08,121
We must
leave this place
tomorrow.

952
01:21:08,205 --> 01:21:11,416
What if we do it tonight?
We'll help you.

953
01:21:14,295 --> 01:21:16,045
Come on!
Bring that one
around here, okay?

954
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:17,964
Alma, let me give
you a hand with that.

955
01:21:18,048 --> 01:21:19,007
There are a lot more.

956
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:21,050
Lay this one down outside
and come right back.

957
01:21:21,135 --> 01:21:22,635
Okay. Got it?

958
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,637
I can't do this alone!

959
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:26,181
Hey, somebody
give me a hand.

960
01:21:26,265 --> 01:21:28,266
Set it over there.

961
01:21:29,935 --> 01:21:31,478
Okay.

962
01:21:31,562 --> 01:21:33,521
Come on! Let's go.
Let's get a hold of this!

963
01:21:33,606 --> 01:21:35,773
Our base was sinking.

964
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:40,069
Time to prepare a passage
for all of us was gone.

965
01:21:40,154 --> 01:21:45,366
These 20 chose to stay behind
so the rest of us
could leave safely.

966
01:21:47,912 --> 01:21:51,247
They survived
here in the ocean
for 10,000 years.

967
01:21:52,249 --> 01:21:54,501
They can survive again.

968
01:21:54,585 --> 01:21:56,419
Okay?
Yeah.

969
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,880
How you guys doing?

970
01:21:58,964 --> 01:22:00,924
Okay.

971
01:22:01,008 --> 01:22:02,008
You okay?

972
01:22:02,092 --> 01:22:03,384
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.

973
01:22:03,469 --> 01:22:04,677
I've been diving.
It's all right.

974
01:22:04,762 --> 01:22:06,137
You have?

975
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:27,403
I want you all
to consider very carefully

976
01:24:27,488 --> 01:24:30,531
what I'm about to
suggest to you.

977
01:24:32,076 --> 01:24:35,411
You and your friends seem
to want what we've got.

978
01:24:36,914 --> 01:24:40,833
Well, we have room for you.

979
01:24:42,753 --> 01:24:47,048
We have room for you
and about 30 more
of your friends.

980
01:24:47,132 --> 01:24:50,593
You would be students,
of course, but...

981
01:24:51,762 --> 01:24:53,930
But you'd also be teachers.

982
01:24:55,599 --> 01:24:58,685
And the new civilizations
that we'll be traveling to

983
01:24:58,769 --> 01:25:01,771
will be unlike anything
you've ever known.

984
01:25:04,066 --> 01:25:06,067
But I promise you

985
01:25:07,945 --> 01:25:10,905
you will all lead
productive lives.

986
01:25:10,989 --> 01:25:12,699
Forever?

987
01:25:12,783 --> 01:25:14,742
We don't know
what "forever" means.

988
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:39,142
I got a couple of things I...

989
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:43,813
I need to talk
about with you.

990
01:25:43,897 --> 01:25:44,981
Yeah?

991
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,482
Yeah.

992
01:25:49,987 --> 01:25:53,656
I guess me and your grandma
are going away, David.

993
01:25:54,742 --> 01:25:56,743
Where to?

994
01:25:56,827 --> 01:26:00,413
Well, that's not important.
What's important is that

995
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:09,088
when we get
where we're going,
we'll never be sick,

996
01:26:10,591 --> 01:26:13,760
we won't get any older
and we won't ever die.

997
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:21,100
You're joking me, right?

998
01:26:21,185 --> 01:26:22,351
No.

999
01:26:23,145 --> 01:26:24,562
No.

1000
01:26:26,023 --> 01:26:29,108
Would I be able to
visit you and Grandma?

1001
01:26:29,568 --> 01:26:32,153
No.

1002
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:35,198
And we wouldn't be able
to visit you, either.

1003
01:26:35,282 --> 01:26:38,075
And that kind of bothers me.

1004
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,369
I'd never see you again?

1005
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:45,666
No.

1006
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:50,296
When would you go,
if you did?

1007
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:53,049
Soon, my boy. Soon.

1008
01:26:54,301 --> 01:26:56,511
And do you know where?

1009
01:26:56,595 --> 01:26:57,720
Where?

1010
01:26:57,805 --> 01:26:59,138
Look up.

1011
01:27:01,975 --> 01:27:04,644
Outer space, my lad.

1012
01:27:04,728 --> 01:27:06,521
Outer space.

1013
01:27:06,605 --> 01:27:09,357
Who's gonna take
you to outer space?

1014
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:11,442
It don't matter.

1015
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:16,489
You wouldn't
believe me if I told you,
and I can't tell your mother,

1016
01:27:16,573 --> 01:27:20,660
because she'd then
know her old man
had snapped his cap.

1017
01:27:22,412 --> 01:27:25,832
I wonder if they'll
have fishing holes there.

1018
01:27:27,918 --> 01:27:31,045
There's some
things they won't have.
They won't have grandsons,

1019
01:27:31,129 --> 01:27:35,341
and they won't
have baseball games,

1020
01:27:35,425 --> 01:27:36,843
and they won't
have hot dogs,

1021
01:27:36,927 --> 01:27:40,346
and they won't have
that kind of stuff.
And...

1022
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:44,725
I'm gonna miss them.

1023
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:48,604
All right.
Cast it out there.

1024
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:02,451
I wish we'd get a bite.

1025
01:28:02,578 --> 01:28:05,788
If I could catch one
more great, big fish...

1026
01:28:11,044 --> 01:28:14,672
You know how much
we love you, don't you?

1027
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:17,091
Of course I do.

1028
01:28:17,175 --> 01:28:19,260
I just don't want you
to forget how much we care

1029
01:28:19,344 --> 01:28:22,305
no matter what we say or do.

1030
01:28:23,015 --> 01:28:24,807
Of course.

1031
01:28:45,662 --> 01:28:47,121
Bye, Grandpa.

1032
01:28:47,205 --> 01:28:49,081
Goodbye, little man.

1033
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,626
Smile.

1034
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,880
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

1035
01:28:55,964 --> 01:28:58,925
Stop by next
week sometime, okay?

1036
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,180
Be a good boy.
Mind your mom.

1037
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:34,418
You having second thoughts?

1038
01:29:36,463 --> 01:29:38,089
Yes.

1039
01:29:40,467 --> 01:29:43,177
So you think
it's like Bernie says,
we're cheating nature.

1040
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:44,387
Yes.

1041
01:29:47,557 --> 01:29:50,226
Well, I'll tell
you something.

1042
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:51,727
The way nature's
been treating us,

1043
01:29:51,812 --> 01:29:54,647
I don't mind
cheating her a little.

1044
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:11,080
You'll be
closing your account
then, Mr. Selwyn?

1045
01:30:11,164 --> 01:30:12,206
Yes, I will.

1046
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:13,791
All in $100 bills?

1047
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,001
Uh-huh.

1048
01:30:15,836 --> 01:30:17,837
Here you go.

1049
01:30:19,798 --> 01:30:21,549
This is for you.

1050
01:30:22,175 --> 01:30:23,592
Sir!

1051
01:30:26,596 --> 01:30:30,141
Here. Have fun,
have fun, my friends!
Have fun!

1052
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:32,601
Here. Divide it up, girls!
Divide it up! Divide it up!

1053
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:36,188
There you are.
There you are.

1054
01:30:36,273 --> 01:30:37,815
Racing with the moon

1055
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,443
Hey! Enjoy, enjoy!

1056
01:30:40,527 --> 01:30:42,987
Sailing through
the midnight sun

1057
01:31:02,632 --> 01:31:04,967
He can come in
for a minute.

1058
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:12,641
Hi.

1059
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:24,820
They say
if we go with them,
we'll live forever.

1060
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,744
And that's good.

1061
01:31:32,496 --> 01:31:36,123
It's probably gonna take you
an eternity to forgive me.

1062
01:31:43,256 --> 01:31:45,007
I'm sorry, Alma.

1063
01:31:47,177 --> 01:31:50,596
I guess
I've been ridiculous.
I am sorry.

1064
01:31:51,848 --> 01:31:53,766
I love you.

1065
01:31:55,018 --> 01:31:57,645
You're my whole life.

1066
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:02,858
I want to go.

1067
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:08,864
But if it's a choice
of only six more
months here with you,

1068
01:32:09,908 --> 01:32:11,617
or living forever
all by myself,

1069
01:32:11,701 --> 01:32:15,121
well, I'll take
the six more months
here with you.

1070
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:20,584
I don't want
to live forever

1071
01:32:22,212 --> 01:32:24,713
if you're not
gonna be with me.

1072
01:32:38,562 --> 01:32:40,896
So, you definitely
trust them?

1073
01:32:40,981 --> 01:32:42,273
We trust them.

1074
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:45,484
Men should be explorers,
no matter how old they are.

1075
01:32:45,569 --> 01:32:48,821
I don't know
about anybody else,
but I'm going.

1076
01:32:54,953 --> 01:32:57,997
Why the hell not?
We're in.

1077
01:32:58,915 --> 01:33:00,541
Are you nervous?

1078
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:02,251
Me? No.

1079
01:33:02,794 --> 01:33:05,588
You're sure you
want to do this?

1080
01:33:05,672 --> 01:33:10,217
Once I make a decision,
Arthur, I never turn back.

1081
01:33:10,302 --> 01:33:12,845
This is a big one.

1082
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:14,180
I know.

1083
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:35,492
Yeah, it's gonna be 72
and clear tonight,

1084
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:37,912
a great night to see
that total lunar eclipse.

1085
01:33:37,996 --> 01:33:39,246
Check it out.

1086
01:33:39,331 --> 01:33:41,332
But don't get
weird on me, people.

1087
01:33:52,219 --> 01:33:53,385
Let's go. Let's go.

1088
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:54,720
Sure.

1089
01:33:59,476 --> 01:34:02,311
Quick.
Get me a glass of water.

1090
01:34:03,563 --> 01:34:05,606
Look out.

1091
01:34:11,029 --> 01:34:13,239
Don't do that!

1092
01:34:13,823 --> 01:34:15,658
What is the meaning of this?

1093
01:34:24,542 --> 01:34:28,462
David? Staying up
for the eclipse?

1094
01:34:31,174 --> 01:34:33,801
You don't seem
too enthusiastic.

1095
01:34:36,513 --> 01:34:39,348
Did you and Grandpa
have a fight today?

1096
01:34:40,392 --> 01:34:41,934
No.

1097
01:34:42,018 --> 01:34:43,936
What did he say to you?

1098
01:34:46,856 --> 01:34:50,150
David, I'm very worried
about Grandpa and Grandma.

1099
01:34:50,735 --> 01:34:52,945
What did he say to you?

1100
01:34:53,738 --> 01:34:55,948
I can't tell you.

1101
01:34:56,032 --> 01:34:58,033
They're my parents, David.

1102
01:34:58,118 --> 01:35:00,869
You've got to tell me
what he said to you.

1103
01:35:08,253 --> 01:35:10,546
He made me promise.

1104
01:35:44,331 --> 01:35:46,206
Mom? Dad?

1105
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,084
Mom? Dad?

1106
01:35:54,341 --> 01:35:57,259
Hey, Bernie. Come on.

1107
01:35:58,928 --> 01:36:02,056
You're coming
with us, Bernie?

1108
01:36:04,934 --> 01:36:08,812
No. I came to say goodbye.

1109
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:13,067
I just wanted to tell you
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1110
01:36:14,277 --> 01:36:18,030
Rose is gone, Bernie.
Why stay?

1111
01:36:22,452 --> 01:36:24,495
This is my home.

1112
01:36:25,622 --> 01:36:27,956
This is where I belong.

1113
01:36:29,459 --> 01:36:31,585
Come on. Go with us.

1114
01:36:48,186 --> 01:36:49,937
Bye, Bernie.

1115
01:36:54,317 --> 01:36:56,068
Bye, Bernie.

1116
01:36:56,152 --> 01:36:57,194
Bye.

1117
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:58,654
I'm gonna miss you.

1118
01:37:13,628 --> 01:37:15,170
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1119
01:37:16,381 --> 01:37:18,757
Come on. God...

1120
01:37:21,761 --> 01:37:25,013
Only when I need it, right?
Only when I need it.

1121
01:37:26,975 --> 01:37:28,600
Jesus...

1122
01:37:30,186 --> 01:37:31,812
I know something is wrong.

1123
01:37:31,896 --> 01:37:33,439
They're probably out dancing.

1124
01:37:33,523 --> 01:37:35,983
Those folks love to dance.

1125
01:37:36,693 --> 01:37:39,445
Could we talk to
one of their friends?

1126
01:37:40,738 --> 01:37:42,823
We'll go see Pops.

1127
01:37:43,908 --> 01:37:45,868
Will that satisfy you?

1128
01:37:46,953 --> 01:37:48,370
Pops.

1129
01:37:49,289 --> 01:37:50,789
Pops.

1130
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:54,501
Got a little game of
20 questions for you.

1131
01:37:54,586 --> 01:37:56,295
Pops!

1132
01:37:58,923 --> 01:38:00,549
Shit!

1133
01:38:02,051 --> 01:38:03,594
Hello?

1134
01:38:15,273 --> 01:38:17,941
I don't know
what's going on here.

1135
01:38:20,278 --> 01:38:21,528
Jack, we'd better
take a look down below.

1136
01:38:21,613 --> 01:38:22,654
What?

1137
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:23,822
We'd better take
a look down below.

1138
01:38:23,907 --> 01:38:25,991
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1139
01:38:28,953 --> 01:38:31,163
Make sure you
get the feed line. Okay?
'Cause it's gotta be...

1140
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:33,207
You got it. Good.

1141
01:38:35,835 --> 01:38:38,837
The injector.
We've got to make
the injector... It's got...

1142
01:38:38,922 --> 01:38:41,632
You got that, too?
Good. Make sure...

1143
01:38:42,133 --> 01:38:43,592
You go house to house.

1144
01:38:43,676 --> 01:38:46,512
Check the bus stations
and the airports.

1145
01:38:46,596 --> 01:38:48,514
This is a serious
situation we got here.

1146
01:38:48,598 --> 01:38:50,641
The owner of the facility is
on his way from West Palm,

1147
01:38:50,725 --> 01:38:52,059
and he's not happy at all.

1148
01:38:52,143 --> 01:38:55,479
Why don't you start
by taking a good look
around the grounds first?

1149
01:38:55,563 --> 01:38:56,563
Okay, gentlemen?

1150
01:38:56,648 --> 01:38:58,148
Okay. Right this way.

1151
01:38:58,233 --> 01:39:00,609
Better advise
the commander.

1152
01:39:03,071 --> 01:39:04,363
Don't worry, miss.

1153
01:39:04,447 --> 01:39:07,074
We'll help you find
your father and mother.

1154
01:39:07,158 --> 01:39:08,575
It's right over here.

1155
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:11,328
We're in deep shit.
You know that?

1156
01:39:29,722 --> 01:39:32,766
David! David!

1157
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:34,935
Back this way.

1158
01:39:41,317 --> 01:39:42,734
Hey, hey. Whoa!

1159
01:39:51,369 --> 01:39:54,204
In case you're wondering...
Silly Putty.

1160
01:40:05,675 --> 01:40:07,968
Cast off those lines.

1161
01:40:15,727 --> 01:40:20,022
Grandpa, wait for me!
I want to go, too!

1162
01:40:25,028 --> 01:40:26,278
Grandpa!

1163
01:40:26,362 --> 01:40:27,946
What are you doing here?

1164
01:40:28,031 --> 01:40:29,781
Are you all right?
Yeah.

1165
01:40:29,866 --> 01:40:31,491
My gosh.

1166
01:40:36,205 --> 01:40:37,748
David!

1167
01:40:37,832 --> 01:40:39,666
A boat just left the dock.
David!

1168
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:42,628
A lot of old people aboard,
a kid, some in wheelchairs.

1169
01:40:42,712 --> 01:40:43,795
David!

1170
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:48,175
We better move
on this thing now.
I don't like the looks of it.

1171
01:40:48,259 --> 01:40:50,052
You can't go.

1172
01:40:51,387 --> 01:40:54,598
Only your grandmother
and me from this outfit.

1173
01:41:39,936 --> 01:41:41,269
This is Air 21.

1174
01:41:41,354 --> 01:41:43,063
I think I got them below me.

1175
01:41:43,147 --> 01:41:44,856
Want me to swoop them? Over.

1176
01:41:44,941 --> 01:41:47,609
Roger, Air 21.
You are clear.

1177
01:42:31,362 --> 01:42:34,573
Manta III,
this is not a request.
This is an order.

1178
01:42:34,657 --> 01:42:38,827
You are endangering
the lives of your passengers.
Cut your engines.

1179
01:42:38,911 --> 01:42:42,372
We are coming alongside
to board your vessel.

1180
01:42:42,457 --> 01:42:45,500
Jack. Don't let them
board us.

1181
01:42:46,169 --> 01:42:47,335
Nobody's gonna
board this boat.

1182
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:50,172
You just get
your friends here.

1183
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:18,533
Captain, cut your engines.

1184
01:43:19,202 --> 01:43:23,622
Captain,
this is Lieutenant Spark
of the St. Petersburg police.

1185
01:43:23,706 --> 01:43:25,332
You have senior
citizens aboard

1186
01:43:25,416 --> 01:43:28,126
who are in no condition
to be out here.

1187
01:43:28,211 --> 01:43:31,797
You have a minor aboard
without proper
authority from his mother.

1188
01:43:31,881 --> 01:43:33,590
We want to question you.

1189
01:43:33,674 --> 01:43:36,092
Please, cut your engines now.

1190
01:43:36,969 --> 01:43:40,138
We are coming alongside
to board your vessel.

1191
01:43:40,223 --> 01:43:42,891
Stand by to be boarded.

1192
01:43:43,893 --> 01:43:45,352
David's mother
wants him to

1193
01:43:45,436 --> 01:43:47,646
come into the police boat
with her.

1194
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:50,607
David! Come on. Please.

1195
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:53,193
Mom and Dad,
where are you going?

1196
01:43:58,991 --> 01:44:01,576
David! You come back here!

1197
01:44:05,248 --> 01:44:06,373
David!

1198
01:44:06,457 --> 01:44:08,208
Bring it around.

1199
01:44:08,292 --> 01:44:11,545
Cut your engines.
Cut your engines
and come about.

1200
01:44:11,629 --> 01:44:12,796
Man overboard.

1201
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,548
Man overboard, gentlemen.

1202
01:44:16,968 --> 01:44:18,009
You all right?

1203
01:44:18,094 --> 01:44:19,135
I'm okay!

1204
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:22,097
I'm not scared!
Get going!

1205
01:44:24,517 --> 01:44:25,809
Let's go!

1206
01:44:47,456 --> 01:44:49,291
David.

1207
01:45:03,264 --> 01:45:05,056
Maintain
a visual on the Manta.

1208
01:45:05,141 --> 01:45:06,892
These people must be nuts.

1209
01:45:06,976 --> 01:45:09,978
We're gonna have to
pursue and intercept.

1210
01:46:20,925 --> 01:46:22,133
We just went into fog, Chris.

1211
01:46:22,218 --> 01:46:24,177
Rolling out.
Re-check speed selectors.

1212
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:25,303
Full forward. Wheels up.

1213
01:46:25,388 --> 01:46:26,554
Speed selectors,
re-check, full forward.

1214
01:46:30,851 --> 01:46:33,478
Where the hell
did this come from?

1215
01:46:33,562 --> 01:46:36,398
I don't know.
I can't see a damn thing.

1216
01:46:37,274 --> 01:46:39,109
I've never seen it
roll in so fast.

1217
01:46:40,111 --> 01:46:42,070
My God!

1218
01:46:48,911 --> 01:46:50,912
We get no reading
on radar. Over.

1219
01:46:50,997 --> 01:46:53,915
14X3, we copy.
Have zero visibility.

1220
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,875
We're gonna run
into each other.
Go ahead.

1221
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:58,086
Roger.
Let's shut them down.
Over.

1222
01:47:54,226 --> 01:47:56,853
This should more than cover
the cost of the boat.

1223
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:58,063
I didn't...

1224
01:47:58,147 --> 01:48:02,859
I want to thank you
for being a fine guide
and a good friend.

1225
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:04,444
All right.

1226
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,698
Now, you drive careful,
Walter.

1227
01:48:11,035 --> 01:48:12,827
See you, Walter.

1228
01:48:25,341 --> 01:48:28,093
I guess your
ride's here, huh?

1229
01:48:28,177 --> 01:48:31,096
Look, Kitty,
next time you're in town,

1230
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,764
I want you to
look me up, okay?

1231
01:48:32,848 --> 01:48:36,059
Don't worry, Jack.
You'll know
when I'm around.

1232
01:48:36,685 --> 01:48:40,105
You don't know
how close I came
to buying a ticket.

1233
01:49:01,752 --> 01:49:02,752
You'd better go.

1234
01:49:02,837 --> 01:49:04,712
Okay. I'm gonna
miss you, Kitty.

1235
01:49:04,797 --> 01:49:06,756
I'm really gonna miss you.

1236
01:49:10,803 --> 01:49:13,054
May the force be with you!

1237
01:51:00,621 --> 01:51:04,332
There can never
be an accounting,
in human terms,

1238
01:51:04,416 --> 01:51:07,460
for the tragedy at sea
which has taken the lives

1239
01:51:07,544 --> 01:51:10,797
of these men and women
in what should have been

1240
01:51:10,881 --> 01:51:14,801
the beautiful
and peaceful sunset
of their lives.

1241
01:51:16,095 --> 01:51:18,096
Do not fear.

1242
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:21,140
Your loved ones
are in safekeeping.

1243
01:51:21,934 --> 01:51:25,937
They have moved on
to a higher
expression of life,

1244
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:31,025
not life as we know it,
but in the spirit everlasting.

1245
01:51:31,110 --> 01:51:37,031
Our loved ones
are in good hands,
for now and forevermore.

1246
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:42,537
Join with me now
in a moment
of silent prayer.
