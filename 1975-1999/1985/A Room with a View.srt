1
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,700
This is not at all
what we were led to expect.

2
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,900
I thought we were going to see the Arno.

3
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,380
The signora distinctly wrote...

4
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,940
south rooms with a view
and close together...

5
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,500
instead of which she has given us
north rooms without a view...

6
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,410
and a long way apart.

7
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,300
Tsk.

8
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,620
We must hurry and get dressed, dear...

9
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,406
or we'll miss our dinner,
on top of everything else.

10
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,060
She had no business to do it.

11
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,208
No business at all.

12
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,220
Any nook does for me, but it does seem
hard that you shouldn't have a view.

13
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,300
No, you must have a view too.

14
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,580
- Buonasera.
- Buonasera.

15
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,020
Miss Lavish, what a recommendation
for a place.

16
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,726
Indeed, Miss Alan,
it is a recommendation.

17
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,540
Between the squalor of London
and the squalor of Prato...

18
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,642
there is a great gulf fixed.

19
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,740
It is only by going off the track
that you get to know the country.

20
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,300
See the little towns...

21
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,084
Gubbio, Settignano...

22
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,740
Galluzzo...

23
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,580
San Gimignano, Monteriggioni.

24
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,220
They're a mixture of the almost primitive
with the anciently classical...

25
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,940
that I find irresistible.

26
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,580
- Miss Pole?
- Yes, Mr. Emerson.

27
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,260
What is that you're taking?
It's not lemonade, is it?

28
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,820
Yes, it is lemonade.

29
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,780
Put it away, Miss Pole. Right away.

30
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,100
Lemonade is nothing but acidity.
It's very bad for the stomach.

31
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,725
Oh!

32
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,980
I shall tell the signora...

33
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,460
that the next south room view available
is to be given to you, Lucy.

34
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,325
- Why not to you, surely?
- No, I insist.

35
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,772
This meat has surely been boiled...

36
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,540
for st... Ooh! For stock.

37
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,007
It's lost all its flavor.

38
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,060
Monteriggioni is not only quaint...

39
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,811
but there one meets
the Italians unspoiled...

40
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,980
in all their simplicity and charm.

41
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,460
Wasn't Monteriggioni
where we saw the cornflowers, Teresa?

42
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,660
An entire carpet of them.

43
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,580
Oh, it was delightful.

44
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,500
I find the cornflower
the most delightful of flowers.

45
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,329
Don't you, Miss Lavish?

46
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,540
I prefer something bolder...

47
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,660
the reckless rose...

48
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,660
the tempestuous tulip.

49
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,220
Your mother would never forgive me
if I took the view.

50
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,980
Mother would want you to have it.

51
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,050
On no account.
The view of the Arno is yours.

52
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,500
I don't know why we're arguing,
because we don't have it.

53
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,080
- We have no view.
- I have a view.

54
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,100
I have a view. And so does George.

55
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,900
My son George here.

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,020
You can have our rooms,
and we'll have yours.

57
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,860
We can change.

58
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,700
But why shouldn't you have them?

59
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,900
Thank you very much indeed.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,260
We could not impose on your kindness.

61
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,500
Why?

62
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,648
- You see, we wouldn't...
- Hush, Lucy.

63
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,500
Women like looking at a view.

64
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,740
Men don't. George, persuade them.

65
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,860
It's obvious they should have the rooms.
There's nothing else to say.

66
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,940
- Signora?
- No. No, thank you.

67
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,780
Why shouldn't you change? We could
clear out in half an hour, 15 minutes.

68
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,660
It's ridiculous, these niceties.

69
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,500
They go against common sense.
Every kind of sense.

70
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,220
I don't care what I see outside.
My vision is within.

71
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,166
Here is where the birds sing.
Here is where the sky is blue.

72
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,170
Come, Lucy.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,900
Oh, let them have their view
if they want it.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,820
Why shouldn't they, if they want it?

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,580
George, go after them.

76
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,740
What an impossible person.

77
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,740
- He meant to be kind.
- Oh, please, leave this to me.

78
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,860
I know how to deal with these people.

79
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,340
Charlotte, you dealed rudely.
You dealed wrongly.

80
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,140
This pensione is a failure.

81
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,208
Tomorrow we'll make a change.

82
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,327
- It's Mr. Beebe.
- Who?

83
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,527
Charlotte, we can't change now.

84
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,620
- Mr. Beebe.
- Don't you remember us?

85
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,940
Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch.

86
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,940
- We met at Tunbridge Wells.
- That very cold Easter.

87
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,300
How do you do? How do you do?

88
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,620
I've heard from Mother
you are to be our vicar.

89
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,883
Yes, I move into the rectory
at Summer Street in June.

90
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,060
We did feel so sorry for you
in the dining room.

91
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,980
Mr. Emerson is so tactless.

92
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,260
But he meant to be kind.

93
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,940
This old gentleman and his son offered us
their rooms with a view for ours...

94
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,460
which have no view.

95
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,380
It was most indelicate.

96
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,486
But things that are indelicate
can sometimes be beautiful.

97
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,020
Yes!

98
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,620
I am the chaperone
to my young cousin Lucy.

99
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,540
It would be a serious thing if I were
to put her under an obligation...

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,660
to people of whom I know nothing.

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,060
I don't think much harm
could have come of accepting.

102
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,889
There, Charlotte.

103
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,285
So you think I ought to have accepted?

104
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,100
You think I have been narrow-minded.

105
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,100
I never suggested that.

106
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,140
If you will allow me, I would be happy
to act as intermediary...

107
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,765
with Mr. Emerson.

108
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,260
I do not think he would take advantage
of your acceptance...

109
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,180
nor expect any gratitude.

110
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,180
He has rooms he does not value
and he thinks you would value them.

111
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,220
Charlotte, please.

112
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,220
My own wishes, dearest Lucy,
are unimportant in comparison with yours.

113
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,324
I am only here through your kindness.

114
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,128
If you want me to turn these gentlemen
out of their rooms, I will do it.

115
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,940
Would you then, Mr. Beebe...

116
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,380
kindly tell Mr....

117
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,180
Emerson.

118
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,808
Emerson... we accept his offer?

119
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,380
I would like to thank your father
personally for his kindness to us.

120
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,006
You can't. He's in his bath.

121
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,285
I would have given
the larger room to you...

122
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,483
but I happen to know
that it was the young man's.

123
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,740
In my small way,
I am a woman of the world...

124
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,366
and I know where things can lead to.

125
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,204
Whatever does it mean?

126
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,300
Oh, Lucy.

127
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,060
Get dressed, dear, or the better part
of the day will be gone.

128
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,860
Well, you said you liked cornflowers.

129
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,620
So we brought you cornflowers.

130
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,700
Oh, how kind!

131
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,940
They're your type of flowers.
They have your personality.

132
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,100
- I'd like to see them in your hair.
- Oh!

133
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,889
- Mr. Emerson!
- There are no jewels more becoming to a lady.

134
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,324
May I say something rather daring?

135
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,660
Oh, Mr. Beebe,
you sound like Miss Lavish.

136
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,900
Don't say you're writing a novel too.

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,207
If I were, you would be my heroine.

138
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,060
And I should write:

139
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,290
"If Miss Honeychurch
ever takes to live as she plays...

140
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,700
it will be very exciting,
both for us and for her."

141
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,540
Mother doesn't like me
playing Beethoven.

142
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,580
She says I'm always peevish afterwards.

143
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,241
Naturally, one would be... stirred up.

144
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,580
Won't you play some more?

145
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,620
No, I think I'll go out.

146
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,963
Alone? Is that wise, Miss Honeychurch?

147
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,848
To be wise, one might have stayed
at home at Summer Street.

148
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,446
I'll not go far. I promise.

149
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,805
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,020
Whatever's the matter
with dear Miss Lucy?

151
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,260
I put it down to too much Beethoven.

152
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,780
I heard her beautiful playing.

153
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,601
Miss Catharine,
you have flowers in your hair.

154
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,083
Buongiorno. Buongiorno, Ferdinando!

155
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,260
We salute thee.

156
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,980
The bronze came from Turkish cannons...

157
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,820
captured by the knights of San Stefano.

158
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,968
Come along.

159
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,220
- Stop a minute.
- Hmm?

160
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,060
Let that man go on,
or I shall have to speak to him.

161
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,260
Oh, the Britisher abroad.

162
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,540
It's very naughty of me, but I would set
an examination paper at Dover...

163
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,642
and turn back any tourists
that couldn't pass it.

164
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,820
Whenever you feel inclined,
dear people...

165
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,580
to speak in that way...

166
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,940
of a sculpted drapery...

167
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,260
be assured...

168
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,648
Miss, this sepolcro no very good.

169
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,460
You go see glia ffreschi di Giotto.

170
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,260
Cappella Peruzzi,
Cappella Bardi very good.

171
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,460
- No, thank you.
- Ah, Giotto scolaro di Cimabue.

172
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,360
Kept the sheep on the mountain.

173
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,020
- Make a picture of the sheep.
- No, thank you.

174
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,820
I very... good speak English.

175
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,740
Do go away, please.

176
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,002
Cappella Peruzzi,
glia ffreschi di Giotto.

177
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,124
- Come here.
- No.

178
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,620
If you can guide your eyes
around the window...

179
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,900
you will see here in the chapel...

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,571
these superb frescoes by Giotto...

181
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,569
depicting the life of St. Francis.

182
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,860
On the left at the top, there he is,
renouncing his worldly goods.

183
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,601
And on your right, the fourth pope.

184
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,442
And here he is preaching to the bishops.

185
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,860
And there he is undergoing
a... trial by fire...

186
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,620
before the sultan.

187
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,220
And here...

188
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,891
Ah, Mr. Eager. Good morning.

189
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,769
You see me. I'm leading
a little private tour of my own.

190
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,100
Here he is on his deathbed,
surrounded...

191
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,780
Mr. Eager is our English chaplain
here in Florence.

192
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,980
...now unhappily ruined
by restoration...

193
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,060
is untroubled by the snares of anatomy
and perspective.

194
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,180
Look at that fat man there.
He must weigh as much as I do...

195
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,700
but he's floating up into the sky
like an air balloon.

196
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,700
Remember the facts
about this church of Santa Croce...

197
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,460
how it was built by faith
in the full fervor of medievalism.

198
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,406
Built by faith, indeed. That simply means
the workers weren't paid properly.

199
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,340
Pardon me. The chapel
is somewhat small for two parties.

200
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,340
We will incommode you no longer.

201
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,660
Mr. Eager,
there's plenty of room for all of us.

202
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,444
You don't have to, uh...

203
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,130
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

204
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,140
Gather round, everybody.

205
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,060
You may observe here
in the Peruzzi Chapel...

206
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,460
as well as in the place
from which we have just been expelled...

207
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,740
the special character of Giotto...

208
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,780
among the great painters of Italy.

209
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,769
He was a practical fellow.

210
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,540
My poor boy has brains,
but he's very muddled.

211
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,100
But why should he be?

212
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,380
Well may you ask.

213
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,860
But think how he's been brought up...

214
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,531
free from all the superstition
that leads men...

215
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,722
to hate one another in the name of God.

216
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,260
I must go.
My cousin will be most anxious.

217
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,888
I don't require you to fall in love with
my boy, but please try to help him.

218
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,411
If only one could stop him
from brooding.

219
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,340
And on what?

220
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,408
The things of the universe.

221
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,300
I don't believe in this world sorrow.
Do you?

222
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,100
No. No, I don't.
Not at all, Mr. Emerson.

223
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,540
Well, there you are.

224
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,300
Then make my boy realize...

225
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,940
that at the side
of the everlasting "why"...

226
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,820
there is a "yes"...

227
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,060
and a "yes" and a "yes"!

228
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,140
Has your son no particular hobby?

229
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,980
I mean, I generally forget
my worries at the piano...

230
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,860
and collecting stamps did no end of good
for my brother Freddy.

231
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,900
You must excuse me, Mr. Emerson.

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,163
My cousin will be most anxious
if I don't get back this instant.

233
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,460
- Poor girl.
- "Poor girl?"

234
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,780
On the contrary, I think myself
a very fortunate girl.

235
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,620
I'm thoroughly happy
and having a splendid time.

236
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,087
Thank you very much. Good-bye.

237
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,860
Look at that adorable wine cart.

238
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,580
How he stares at us, dear, simple soul.

239
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,001
I love these little dark alleys.

240
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,286
They're all peasants,
you know. Come along.

241
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,761
I do declare we're lost.

242
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,321
No, Miss Bartlett,
you will not look into your Baedeker.

243
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,300
Two lone females in an unknown city...

244
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,180
Now, that's what I call an adventure.

245
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,282
We will simply drift.

246
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,420
One has always to be open, wide open.

247
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,300
- I think Miss Lucy is.
- Open to what, Miss Lavish?

248
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,620
To physical sensation.

249
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,940
I will let you into a secret,
Miss Bartlett.

250
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,580
I have my eye on your cousin,
Miss Lucy Honeychurch.

251
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,967
Oh, for a character in your novel,
Miss Lavish?

252
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,500
The young English girl
transfigured by Italy.

253
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,602
And why should she not be transfigured?

254
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,043
It happened to the Goths.

255
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,176
Signorina?

256
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,883
Signorina.

257
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,540
The smell.

258
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,137
A true Florentine smell.
Inhale, my dear.

259
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,650
Deeper.

260
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,444
Every city, let me tell you,
has its own smell.

261
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,810
Grazie.

262
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,682
How are you now?

263
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,740
Perfectly well.

264
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,100
A... Absolutely well.

265
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,460
Then let's go home.

266
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,449
There's no point in our stopping.

267
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,287
How very kind you've been.
I can go alone. Thank you.

268
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,367
- My photographs!
- What photographs?

269
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,410
I must have dropped them
out there in the square.

270
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,046
Would you be so very kind, uh...

271
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,374
Miss Honeychurch!

272
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,300
You're not fit enough to go home alone.

273
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,562
- Yes, I am. Thank you very much.
- No, you're not.

274
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,500
- But I had rather go...
- Then I don't get the photographs.

275
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,620
Besides, that way,
you'd have to fly over the wall.

276
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,248
Now, please, sit down
and don't move till I come back.

277
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,220
Isn't it extraordinary?

278
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,450
I mean, Italians are so kind,
so lovable...

279
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,801
and yet at the same time so violent.

280
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,484
Mr. Emerson?

281
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,660
I've never been so much
ashamed of myself in my life.

282
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,820
- I can't think what came over me.
- It's perfectly natural.

283
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,620
I nearly fainted myself.

284
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,564
Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.

285
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,940
And... I want to ask you,
as a great favor...

286
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,042
You know how silly people are.

287
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,885
Gossiping.

288
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,100
Ladies especially, I'm afraid.

289
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,885
- You understand what I mean?
- No.

290
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,282
I mean, would you
not mention it to anyone?

291
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,402
My foolish behavior.

292
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,180
What was that? I believe it was
my photographs you threw away.

293
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,140
I didn't know what to do with them.
They were covered with blood.

294
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,561
There. Now I've told you.

295
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,081
Something tremendous has happened.

296
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,482
Well, thank you... again.

297
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,500
How quickly these accidents do happen.

298
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,620
And then one returns to the old life.

299
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,940
I don't.

300
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,980
I mean, something's happened to me.

301
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,969
And to you.

302
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,962
- No!
- She is my sister.

303
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,369
I'm not sure we ought to allow this.

304
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,369
- They aren't doing any harm.
- Oh, Mr. Eager.

305
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,020
I cannot see that you should object
in such a landscape.

306
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,521
As long as she is his sister.

307
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,700
So, Miss Honeychurch, you're traveling.

308
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,620
As a student of art?

309
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,380
No, I'm afraid not.

310
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,404
Perhaps as a student
of human nature like myself?

311
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,220
- I'm here as a tourist.
- Are you indeed?

312
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,100
Do not think me rude.

313
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,780
We residents sometimes
pity you poor tourists not a little.

314
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,780
Handed about like a parcel of goods...

315
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,940
from Venice to Florence,
Florence to Rome...

316
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,220
quite unconscious
of anything outside Baedeker...

317
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,060
their one anxiety to get done or through
and go on somewhere else.

318
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,620
I abhor Baedeker.

319
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,140
If it were left to me, every copy
should be flung into the Arno.

320
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,280
Towns, rivers, palaces,
all mixed up in one inextricable whirl.

321
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,340
Over there, please observe,
Miss Honeychurch...

322
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,540
the villa of my dear friend
Lady Helen Laverstock...

323
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,326
at present busy
with a Fra Angelico definitive study.

324
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,420
And on your left...

325
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,500
No, just there...

326
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,887
Mr. Henry Burrage lives.

327
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,380
An American of the best type. So rare.

328
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,020
Doubtless you know his monographs
in the series of Medieval Byways.

329
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,740
Your father, I believe,
Mr. Emerson, is a journalist?

330
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,900
- He used to be.
- Uh, he's retired?

331
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,482
- And you, yourself?
- I'm on the railways.

332
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,340
You know the American girl in Punch
who says to her father...

333
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,300
"Say, Papa, what did we see in Rome?"

334
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,640
The father replies, "Guess Rome was
the place where we saw the yellow dog."

335
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,140
The yellow dog!
There's traveling for you.

336
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,925
What? Stop! Stop at once!

337
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,460
What did we...

338
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,324
I'm not having this.

339
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:42,500
Have we bolted?

340
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,250
Have we bolted?

341
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,841
What? Is Phaethon misbehaving
with his Persephone?

342
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,940
- Please, I know how to deal with these people.
- Leave them alone.

343
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,126
Do we find happiness so often we should turn
it off the box when it happens to sit there?

344
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,886
Beauty!

345
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,472
Is that your son?

346
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,900
Could that be the silent, dour George?

347
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,820
He's saying his creed.

348
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,060
Trust!

349
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,528
One more lump,
if I might trouble you, Mr. Beebe.

350
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,460
- Joy!
- Thank you.

351
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,881
Beauty!

352
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,580
Truth!

353
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,260
He's declaring the eternal "yes."

354
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,250
And a spoon, if there is one.

355
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,500
Love!

356
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,140
- What's that?
- Hmm?

357
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,780
Oh, the gentlemen
are doubtless having a game.

358
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,420
Why don't you join them, dear?

359
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,860
Because I want to stop here with you.

360
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,860
Observe my foresight.

361
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,940
I never venture forth
without my mackintosh squares.

362
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,045
At any time, one may have to sit
on damp ground or cold marble.

363
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,460
There, Lucy.
Lucy, you have the other one.

364
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,620
Come on. I insist.

365
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,380
The ground will do for me.

366
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,180
I have not had rheumatism for years...

367
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,284
and if I feel a twinge,
I shall stand up.

368
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,100
And she never went back to Weybridge?

369
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,500
Her friend had to return without her.

370
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,740
She remained at Monteriano.

371
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,889
And... And did she really?

372
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,460
No, no. Don't be alarmed.
This is not a cold.

373
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,420
It's just a slight cough.
I've had it for three days.

374
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,380
It has nothing to do
with sitting on the ground.

375
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,180
Very well.
I shall go and find Mr. Beebe.

376
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,580
Oh, do, do, dear. Yes.

377
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,001
He will be so pleased.

378
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,580
And did she really marry this Italian?

379
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,900
In the church at Monteriano.

380
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,260
A youth, 10 years younger than herself.

381
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:37,900
Tsk. Eleanor.

382
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,685
Excuse me.

383
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,723
Dov'è Mr. Beebe?

384
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,602
Buoni uomini?

385
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,580
I have a theory...

386
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,682
that there is something
in the Italian landscape...

387
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,300
which inclines even
the most stolid nature to romance.

388
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,820
It reminds me somewhat
of the country around Shropshire...

389
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,005
where I once spent a holiday
at the home of my friend, Miss Apesbury.

390
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,140
And I divine it, Charlotte...

391
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,420
you had an adventure there.

392
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,166
Feign to deny it.

393
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,329
Lucy!

394
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,100
Mr. Eager, do come and join us.

395
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,820
Miss Honeychurch is feeling unwell.

396
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,604
Yes. Of course.

397
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,128
Andiamo.

398
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,770
Andiamo.

399
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,331
George. George.

400
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,300
- George, aren't you going to come with us?
- I'll walk.

401
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,925
Walk?

402
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,689
Are you sure?

403
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,980
Courage, Miss Honeychurch.
Courage and faith.

404
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,860
Do you suppose that all this
immense electrical display...

405
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,100
is simply called into existence
to extinguish you or me?

406
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,980
Even from a scientific standpoint...

407
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,860
the chances against
our being struck are enormous.

408
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,420
The steel picnic knives...

409
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,420
the only articles
which might attract the current...

410
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,860
are in the other carriage.

411
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,100
What is to be done?

412
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,965
How do you propose to silence him?

413
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,660
- The driver?
- My dear girl, no.

414
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,728
Mr. George Emerson.

415
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,500
I don't wish
to judge him uncharitably...

416
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,380
but I know he will talk.

417
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,528
He will not. He never talks.

418
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,080
One's lucky to get as much
as a "yes" or "no" out of him.

419
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,125
Unfortunately,
I have met the type before.

420
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,020
They seldom keep their exploits
to themselves.

421
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,645
Exploits?

422
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,700
Very well.

423
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,484
I'll speak to him.

424
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,220
Oh, no, my dear Lucy.

425
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,846
No, I think it is for me to do that.

426
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,728
He should have been here
at least an hour ago...

427
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,420
even if he did walk all the way.

428
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,740
Don't stand there, dear.

429
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,650
You will be seen from the outside.

430
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,900
The moment he comes, I shall face him.

431
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,900
Oh, no, my dear,
you will do no such thing.

432
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,900
Oh, my poor dear girl, you are so young.

433
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,460
And you've always lived
among such nice people.

434
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,700
You cannot realize what men can be.

435
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,700
This afternoon, for example,
if I had not arrived...

436
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,260
what would have happened?

437
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,820
I can't think.

438
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,260
Answer me, Lucia.

439
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,966
What would have happened
if I had not appeared?

440
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,770
You did appear!

441
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,260
Oh, I have vexed you at every turn.

442
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,100
It's true.

443
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,620
I am too old for you.

444
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,260
And too dull.

445
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,729
It will be a push to catch
the morning train, but we must try.

446
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,980
Oh, I have failed
in my duty to your mother.

447
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,420
She will never forgive me
when you tell her.

448
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,171
Come away from the window!

449
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,900
She will certainly blame me
when she hears of it.

450
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,525
Certainly.

451
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,688
And deservedly.

452
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,780
Why need Mother hear of it?

453
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,060
Well, you tell her everything.

454
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,940
Don't you?

455
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,420
I suppose I do, generally.

456
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,660
There's such a beautiful
confidence between you.

457
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,300
One would hate to break it.

458
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,140
And as I have said before,
I am to blame.

459
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,740
I wouldn't want Mother to think so.

460
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,900
She will think so...

461
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,660
if you tell her.

462
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,980
I shall never speak of it...

463
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,048
either to Mother or to anyone.

464
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,484
We'll both be as silent as the grave.

465
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,807
You'd better get to bed, dear.
We have to make an early start.

466
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,685
But, of course,
we have not had a full week.

467
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,020
I reserved the rooms for a week
like you wrote you wanted.

468
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,620
Yes, but we've only had half a week...

469
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,780
so by my calculations,
we owe you half the price.

470
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,780
I'm the loser. I could have
let them rooms five times over.

471
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,687
I've been turning people
away right and left.

472
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,900
- Buonasera.
- Buonasera.

473
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,490
Grazie.

474
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,620
Lucy!

475
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,860
We must get packed immediately.
Immediately!

476
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,645
I wish one word with you, Mr. Emerson,
in the drawing room, please.

477
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,420
I don't see you ought
to go peeping like that.

478
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,780
You know Cecil actually
asked my permission...

479
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,406
but when he comes to the point,
he can't manage without me.

480
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,940
- Nor me.
- You?

481
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,820
- He asked my permission also.
- How very odd. Whatever did you say?

482
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,420
- I said no.
- What?

483
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,620
I can't help it. It's the way he put it.

484
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,140
He said, didn't I think it would be a
splendid thing for Lucy if he married her...

485
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,340
and wasn't I off my head with joy?

486
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,780
So I said no, I wasn't.

487
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,780
Ridiculous child.

488
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,980
You think you're so holy and truthful...

489
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,811
- when really it's only abominable conceit.
- Look out.

490
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,243
I promessi sposi.

491
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,820
She has accepted me.

492
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,300
I-I'm so glad.

493
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,140
Oh, dear Cecil, what joy.

494
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,180
Well, welcome as one of the family.

495
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,805
Thank you.

496
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,700
Mother?

497
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,660
Lucy.

498
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,100
Freddy!

499
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,860
- Mr. Beebe.
- Thank you, Mary.

500
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,380
Hello, Mr. Vyse. I've come for some tea.

501
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,140
Do you suppose I shall get it?

502
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,700
Food is the one thing one does get here.

503
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,140
Yes.

504
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,100
What an extraordinary thing.

505
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,100
One of Freddy's bones.

506
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,340
Oh, Freddy's terrible.

507
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,780
A most unpromising youth.

508
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,500
So unlike his sister.

509
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,220
You think his sister is promising?

510
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,700
I have a pet theory
about Miss Honeychurch.

511
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,940
Does it not strike you as odd
that she should play so wonderfully...

512
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,329
play Beethoven with such passion,
and live so quietly?

513
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,162
I suspect that one day...

514
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,291
music and life will mingle.

515
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,100
Then she will be wonderful in both.

516
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,300
I trust that day is at hand.

517
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,244
She has just promised to marry me.

518
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,688
I'm sorry if I've given you a shock.

519
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,380
I really am most awfully sorry.

520
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,380
I'd no idea you were
so intimate with her.

521
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,260
Really, Mr. Vyse,
you should have stopped me.

522
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,283
Shall we join the others?

523
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,740
Congratulations.

524
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,340
Blessings.

525
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,020
Your vicar's benediction.

526
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,100
I want you to be supremely happy.

527
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,260
And supremely good,
both as man and wife, mother and father.

528
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,420
And now I want my tea.

529
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,524
Just in time.
How dare you be so serious.

530
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,020
Summer Street will never be the same.

531
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,460
It's far too small for anyone,
the least like ourselves.

532
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,420
It might attract
the wrong type of tenant.

533
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,340
The train service has improved so.

534
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,180
Fatal improvement to my mind.

535
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,380
What are five miles from the station
in these days of bicycles?

536
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,882
Sir Harry, how would you
like spinsters as tenants in Cissie Villa?

537
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,460
Oh, most certainly.

538
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,420
That is, if they are gentlewomen.

539
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,620
Oh, indeed they are,
though at present homeless, so they write.

540
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,820
Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.

541
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,649
I met them in Italy.

542
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,820
Oh, Sir Harry, beware
of these gentlewomen.

543
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,526
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.

544
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,100
Provided, of course, he's clean.

545
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,260
Mother, you'd be the first
to love the Miss Alans.

546
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,940
I don't think I'd like anyone
at that pensione of yours.

547
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,580
Wasn't there a lady novelist
and a free-thinking father and son?

548
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,500
What is your profession, Mr. Vyse?

549
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,180
I have no profession.

550
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,980
My attitude...
quite an indefensible one...

551
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,180
is that so long as
I'm no trouble to anyone...

552
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,260
I have the right to do as I like.

553
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,100
It is, I daresay,
an example of my decadence.

554
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,300
You're very fortunate.

555
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,060
The possession of leisure
is a wonderful opportunity.

556
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,460
Don't slouch, Lucy.

557
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,211
Go and talk to Mrs. Pool.
Ask her about her leg.

558
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,700
Would Cecil and I be missed very much,
do you think, if we went for a walk?

559
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,620
I think it would be all right.

560
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,200
Don't get your frock muddied, hmm?

561
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,540
It's so disgusting...

562
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,700
the way an engagement
is regarded as public property.

563
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,060
All those old women smirking.

564
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,020
One has to go through it, I suppose.

565
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,420
They won't notice us
so very much next time.

566
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,620
But my point is,
their whole attitude is wrong.

567
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,660
An engagement...

568
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,500
horrid word in the first place...

569
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,280
is a private matter
and should be regarded as such.

570
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,251
There's your philosophizing parson.

571
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,420
- Don't you like Mr. Beebe either?
- I never said so.

572
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,171
I consider him far above the average.

573
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,580
Mr. Beebe,
I've had such a wonderful idea.

574
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,460
I'm going to write our Miss Alans...
Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine...

575
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,460
and ask them to take Sir Harry's villa.

576
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,020
Oh.

577
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,771
In my opinion, Sir Harry deserves
a tenant as vulgar as himself.

578
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,441
Oh, Mr. Vyse,
he's really very nice, you know.

579
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,740
Gentlewomen. Ugh!

580
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,740
Acting the little god down here...

581
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,900
with his gentility and his patronage
and his sham aesthetics...

582
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,780
and everyone is taken in.

583
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,020
Well, I'll write to them,
and if you would also send a word?

584
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,620
Certainly. Yes, indeed.

585
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,849
A highly suitable addition
to our little community.

586
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,648
Goodness. How cross you are!

587
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,300
It was that miserable tea party
and all those dreadful people.

588
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,300
And not being alone with you.

589
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,925
Hmm.

590
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,601
Italy and London are the places
where I feel I truly belong.

591
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,407
I am something
of an inglese italianato...

592
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,420
e un diavolo incarnato.

593
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,443
You know the proverb?

594
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,100
I somehow think that you feel
more at home with me in a room...

595
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,020
never in the real country like this.

596
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,020
Do you know, I think you're right.

597
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,090
When I do think of you,
it is always in a room.

598
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,700
This is the Sacred Lake.

599
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,180
Hmm. Very picturesque,
but hardly a lake.

600
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,282
More of a puddle.

601
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,780
Freddy loves to bathe here.

602
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,540
He's very fond of it.

603
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,130
And you?

604
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,380
I used to bathe here too...

605
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,642
until I was found out.

606
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,340
- Lucy.
- Hmm?

607
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,171
Yes, I suppose we ought to be going.

608
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,929
I want to ask you something
that I have never asked before.

609
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,420
What, Cecil?

610
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,045
Yes?

611
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,322
Up till now, I have never kissed you.

612
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,924
No. You haven't.

613
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,580
May I now?

614
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,820
Well, of course you may, Cecil.

615
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,129
You might before.
I can't run at you, you know.

616
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,724
Hmm. W...

617
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,162
- I'm sorry.
- No.

618
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,380
You know, Mother's right. Those people
Charlotte and I met at the pensione...

619
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,620
They were... all of them...
rather extraordinary.

620
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,460
Our neighbor and old friend,
Sir Harry Otway...

621
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,500
has a little villa in Summer Street
for which he's trying to find a tenant.

622
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,180
I immediately thought of you.

623
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,620
"Sir Harry's house
has an added attraction...

624
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,940
that it stands
exactly across the road...

625
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,500
from the Reverend Beebe's church.

626
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,924
And I've told him of my plan
to lure you hither...

627
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,980
and he is in complete agreement...

628
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,620
and says he is writing today
to urge you to consider...

629
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,768
our little corner of Surrey.

630
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,900
Yours sincerely, Lucy Honeychurch."

631
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,940
- Oh!
- There.

632
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,048
- Good night.
- Good night.

633
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,445
Oh, dear.

634
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,602
- Good night.
- Good night.

635
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,140
- Good night. See you Friday.
- Good night.

636
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,100
That will be all, Rose. Thank you.

637
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,850
Thank you, madam.

638
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,340
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, sir.

639
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,980
Make Lucy one of us.

640
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,500
Lucy's becoming wonderful. Wonderful.

641
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,620
Her music always was wonderful.

642
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,300
Yes, but she's purging off
that Honeychurch taint.

643
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,900
Most excellent Honeychurches,
but you know what I mean.

644
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,380
She isn't always quoting the servants
or asking how the pudding is made.

645
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,260
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.

646
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,740
Her music, the style of her...

647
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,940
How she kept to Schubert
when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.

648
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,202
Schubert was right for this evening.

649
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,780
Do you know, Mother, I shall have
our children educated just like Lucy.

650
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,780
Bring them up among honest
country folk for freshness...

651
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,980
send them to Italy for... subtlety.

652
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,368
And then... not till then
bring them to London.

653
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,562
Not a day beyond January.

654
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,770
Cecil.

655
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,205
Darling.

656
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,127
So, you do love me, little thing?

657
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,288
Hey!

658
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,300
Lucy!

659
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,100
Lu... I'm trying to get her attention to
show her this letter from the Miss Alans.

660
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,260
Oh, the tiresome Miss Alans.

661
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,100
How I hate their iffing and butting.

662
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,329
Oh, well, they've made their mind up now.
They're really coming.

663
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,286
I had a letter from Miss Teresa who wanted
to know how often the butcher called.

664
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,166
Apparently, my reply
impressed her favorably.

665
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,900
- Lucy?
- Go for her.

666
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,340
Get her round the shins
with the racquet.

667
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:17,900
Freddy, be careful!

668
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,048
You really are savages, you know.

669
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,300
Impossible to make oneself heard.

670
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,940
Don't you want to know what
the Miss Alans have to say?

671
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,500
Who are the Miss Alans?

672
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,300
Sir Harry's new tenants at the villa.

673
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,420
- That wasn't the name.
- Wasn't whose name?

674
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,140
Sir Harry's new tenants.

675
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,100
I met him this morning, and he said...

676
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,940
"Ahem. Honeychurch. Ahem.

677
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,540
I have at last procured
some really desirable tenants."

678
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,620
I said, "Hooray, old chap"
and slapped him on the back.

679
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,620
Exactly. The Miss Alans.

680
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,780
Rather not. It's more like Anderson.

681
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,740
Oh, good gracious.
I knew there'd be another muddle.

682
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,460
I'm always right.

683
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,050
Only another muddle of Freddy's...

684
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,300
who doesn't even know the name
of the other people.

685
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,926
Yes, I do. I've got it. It was Emerson.

686
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,460
What a weathercock Sir Harry is.

687
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,900
Emerson? Well, I hope they're
the right kind of people.

688
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,820
Yes, Freddy,
there is a right sort and a wrong sort.

689
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,561
These must be the right sort
because they're friends of Cecil's.

690
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,300
- Cecil?
- So you and the other county families...

691
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,820
will be able to call in perfect safety.

692
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,660
- Cecil?
- We did meet some Emersons in Florence.

693
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,220
Don't you remember?
The oddest people, Mrs. Honeychurch.

694
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,020
The queerest people.
But we rather liked them, didn't we?

695
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,122
Emerson's a common enough name.

696
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,740
- "So really desirable, Honeychurch.
- No!

697
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,220
- I've just telegraphed to them."
- Don't be silly, Freddy.

698
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,700
You always overdo it when you play.

699
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,900
Really, most remarkable people.
Father and son, you know.

700
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,700
The father's something of a radical.

701
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,300
Good at heart, I believe.

702
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,580
The son, full of possibilities.

703
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,682
Don't move.

704
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,300
Stay where you are.

705
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,380
Ginevra de' Benci.

706
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,700
Did you know you were a Leonardo...

707
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,180
smiling at things beyond our ken?

708
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,408
Cecil, what's this about
Sir Harry's new tenants?

709
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,620
Yes, I, even I have found him
tenants for his Cissie Villa.

710
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,900
I've won a great victory
for the comic muse.

711
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,004
Cecil, after all the trouble I took
over the Miss Alans.

712
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,051
Well, of course, I prefer
to have nice friends of yours.

713
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,060
Friends of mine?
Lucy, the whole joke is to come.

714
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,846
They're absolute strangers whom I happened
to meet in the National Gallery.

715
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,500
They had been to Italy,
a father and a son... the oddest couple.

716
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,580
In the course of conversazione...

717
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,620
they said they wanted
a country cottage...

718
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,220
and did I know of one?

719
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,420
A simple burrow
they could call their own...

720
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,420
where they could smell the earth.

721
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,940
Of course, London has its own character.

722
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,409
But we've a longing for green things
growing. Don't we, George?

723
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,020
The sweetness
of the English countryside...

724
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,940
of... of wet hedgerows...

725
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,540
with birds singing inside them.

726
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,540
Of course I freely admit
it's a weakness.

727
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,540
We should make our heaven on earth
wherever we are.

728
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,740
However, I fear I've faltered
and need some help from outside.

729
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,020
Yes, uh, well, uh...

730
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,851
in short, sir, what I seek
is a country cottage...

731
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,580
a little home for me
where George could come at weekends.

732
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,780
Well, I happen to know
of just the place for you.

733
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,260
Not exactly a cottage.

734
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,700
More... a villa.

735
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,041
Oh, dear sir, I implore you...

736
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,020
If you'd like to give me your card.

737
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,020
A card? Yes.
Well, I fear we have no card.

738
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,140
But George will write down the address.

739
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,740
Sir Harry Otway.

740
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,330
It is in Surrey.

741
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,460
A place called Summer Street.

742
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,167
Summer Street?
I've dreamed of Summer Street!

743
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,260
It will teach
that snob Sir Harry a lesson.

744
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,740
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix.

745
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,780
There ought to be intermarriage,
all sorts of things.

746
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,460
I believe in democracy.

747
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,803
No, you don't.
You don't know what the word means.

748
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,580
It isn't fair, Cecil.

749
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,580
I probably met them before.

750
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,060
Perfectly fair if it punishes a snob.

751
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,460
Cecil, I blame you.
I blame you very much indeed.

752
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,140
You had no business to undo my work about
the Miss Alans and make me look ridiculous.

753
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,040
You call it scoring off Sir Harry,
but do you realize it was at my expense?

754
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,848
I consider it most disloyal of you.

755
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,060
Temper, Lucy, temper.

756
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,764
Please.

757
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,740
- Hello?
- Hello.

758
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,844
- Hello. I've brought someone to see you.
- I'll be down in a minute.

759
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,440
Byron. Exactly.

760
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,930
"A Shropshire Lad."

761
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,940
Never heard of it.

762
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,283
"The Way of All Flesh."

763
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,660
Never heard of it.

764
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,969
Hello. George reads German.

765
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,220
I'm certain that's old Emerson.

766
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,380
What on earth are those people
doing up there?

767
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,131
- Hello!
- Wait on, Mr. Beebe.

768
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,220
- This is a neighbor, Mr. Honeychurch.
- How do you do?

769
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,731
How do you do?

770
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,300
Come in.

771
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,380
Uh, come and have a bathe.

772
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,685
Well, I... I'd like that.

773
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,300
That's the best conversational opening
I've ever heard.

774
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,060
"How do you do? Come and have a bathe."

775
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,740
Emerson, this is Honeychurch.

776
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,740
You'll remember
his sister from Florence.

777
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,420
Oh, yes. And how do you do?
Very glad to see you.

778
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,100
Uh, very glad to hear your sister is...
i-is marrying.

779
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,124
I'm sure she'll be, uh...
I'm sure she'll be happy.

780
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,129
Uh, we... we know Mr. Vyse too.

781
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,940
He's been very, um... uh, uh, very ki...

782
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,964
George, g-go and bathe.
The change'll do you good.

783
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,300
Then you can all come back
and have some tea.

784
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,404
- Do you really want this bathe?
- Yes. I've said so.

785
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,369
Good-bye, Emerson.

786
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,620
Uh... Oh, uh, bring some milk and honey.

787
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,564
And, uh, uh, cakes. Cakes!

788
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,882
Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch.

789
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,300
As a matter of fact, coincidence
is much rarer than we suppose.

790
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,900
For example...

791
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,140
it's not coincidental
that you're here now...

792
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,260
when one comes to reflect on it.

793
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,340
I have reflected. It's fate.

794
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,930
Everything is fate.

795
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,940
You have not reflected at all.

796
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,620
Let me cross-examine you.

797
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,820
Where did you meet Mr. Vyse,
who will marry Miss Honeychurch?

798
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,300
The National Gallery.

799
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,500
Looking at Italian art.

800
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,980
You see? And you talk
of coincidence and fate.

801
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,780
You're naturally drawn to things Italian,
as are we and all our friends.

802
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,460
Aren't we, Freddy?

803
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,140
That narrows the field immeasurably.

804
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,740
It is fate.

805
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,367
But call it Italy,
if it pleases you, Vicar.

806
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,727
Whoo!

807
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,890
Are you bathing, Mr. Beebe?

808
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,860
Don't be shy!

809
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,180
Why not?

810
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,487
Oh, it is wonderful!

811
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,090
Simply ripping.

812
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,891
Hurry up, Emerson!

813
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,209
Come along, Mr. Beebe!

814
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,448
I may as well wash too.

815
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,540
Well, here goes.

816
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,568
Race you round it!

817
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,980
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan...

818
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,911
a stately pleasure dome decree"...

819
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,860
Bravo!

820
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:34,241
You've gone too far! Really, I...

821
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,180
I have a boot!

822
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,284
- Oww!
- And some trousers!

823
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,660
- Aah!
- Come on then!

824
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,730
There are people!

825
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,009
- Graces alive!
- Oh!

826
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,260
Whoo!

827
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,340
Come this way immediately.
This way, Mrs. Honeychurch.

828
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,522
Whoever were those unfortunate people?

829
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,005
This way, Mrs. Honeychurch. Follow me.

830
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,860
Oh, dears. Look away!

831
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,140
Oh! Mr. Beebe too!

832
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,380
- Oh!
- You're treading on me!

833
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,380
So it is you.

834
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,020
Why not have a comfortable bath
at home, dear...

835
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,540
with hot and cold laid on?

836
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,220
- Mother!
- You are in no position to argue, Freddy.

837
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,900
Come, Lucy.

838
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,220
Oh, look...

839
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,649
Uh, no, don't look! Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!

840
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,940
Poor Charlotte.

841
01:07:57,498 --> 01:07:59,300
Poor, poor Charlotte!

842
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,563
This is the standard reaction to any letter
from our cousin Charlotte.

843
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,900
- Oh, poor Charlotte.
- Poor, poor Charlotte.

844
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,220
No, but this is serious.

845
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,220
Her boiler is to be had out...

846
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,780
and the bathroom cistern cleaned...

847
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,100
and all kinds of to-doing.

848
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,980
I think it would be very nice
if we asked her to stay.

849
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,260
Give her a holiday while the plumbers
at Tunbridge Wells finish.

850
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,940
No!

851
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,900
We're squeezed to death as it is with
Freddy's friend coming, and Minnie Beebe.

852
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,820
Freddy, must you?

853
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,260
The truth is, dear,
you don't like Charlotte.

854
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,420
Well, she gets on my nerves.

855
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,980
The one time she met Cecil in Rome,
she drove him quite frantic.

856
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,420
So, please,
don't worry us this last summer...

857
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,820
but spoil us by not asking her to come.

858
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,780
Hear! Hear! We vote no Miss Bartlett.

859
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,291
This isn't very kind of you two.

860
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,940
You have each other,
and poor Charlotte...

861
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,020
Again, "poor Charlotte."

862
01:09:01,977 --> 01:09:05,481
Has the water turned off, and plumbers.

Is anything the matter with Cecil?

876
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,329
Because otherwise,
I cannot account for him.

877
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,220
Whenever I speak, he winces.

878
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,940
I see him, Lucy.
It's useless to contradict me.

879
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,660
No doubt I am not artistic...

880
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,380
nor literary, nor intellectual.

881
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,900
Your father bought
the drawing room furniture...

882
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,820
and we must put up with it, Lucy,
so kindly remember.

883
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,651
Cecil doesn't mean to be uncivil.

884
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,900
He once explained...

885
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,420
it's ugly things that upset him.

886
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,060
He's not uncivil to people.

887
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,580
Is it a thing or a person
when Freddy sings?

888
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:02,060
You can't expect a really musical person
to appreciate comic songs as we do.

889
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,528
Must he sneer
and spoil everyone's pleasure?

890
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,380
Go and dress, dear.

891
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,528
All right, Mother.

892
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,020
Say, Lucy,
is there anything on Sunday week?

893
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,020
Because if not, I want to
ask George Emerson up for some tennis.

894
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,020
- Oh, no, Freddy. I really wouldn't...
- Oh, he's topping!

895
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,620
He's spiffing!

896
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,780
George Emerson is simply ripping!

897
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,100
What a noise you're making.

898
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,204
Freddy, let Lucy go.

899
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,489
You hook me behind, old lady?

900
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,300
Need we have Charlotte?

901
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,970
We needn't.

902
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,925
- And now Freddy wants to ask the Emersons.
- Well, he needn't.

903
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,121
And you're not pleased with Cecil.

904
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,603
Kiss me.

905
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,300
Well, of course,
if you want Charlotte to come...

906
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,049
with her boiler and everything...

907
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,040
She's been so kind to me.

908
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,246
Kiss me again.

909
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,281
- Would you like it closed?
- Oh, thank you.

910
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,562
- Thank you so very much.
- Pleasure, ma'am.

911
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,166
Oh, porter! Could you...

912
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,660
- This ticket says Dorking.
- Mmm? Well, isn't this Dorking?

913
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,620
- No, that was the last station.
- Oh, how very vexing!

914
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,485
Well, I shall have to get a cab.

915
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,420
Mr. Emerson. What on earth
are you doing here?

916
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,340
My father lives here.
I've come for the weekend.

917
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,647
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

918
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,380
Oh, Lucy, I met him at the station.

919
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,380
I had no idea. Oh, my poor Lucia.

920
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,260
My dear Marian.

921
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,980
Oh, what a stupid blunder.
You'll never forgive me.

922
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,660
- Oh!
- Freddy, pay the cab.

923
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,660
Oh, no, I must. I absolutely insist.

924
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,940
- Oh, how do you do, Mr. Vyse?
- Miss Bartlett.

925
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,900
- And this is Mr. Floyd, a friend of Freddy's.
- How do you do, Mr. Floyd?

926
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,900
No, I insist I pay for my cab.

927
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,820
- And this is Minnie. Minnie, get up, please.
- How do you do?

928
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,500
- Mr. Beebe's niece.
- Grant me that, at all events.

929
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,284
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much, sir. Walk on.

930
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,020
No, I insist, absolutely.

931
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,820
Well, if you'd really rather...

932
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,300
five shillings,
and I gave a bob to the driver.

933
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,700
We all have our foibles, and mine
is the prompt settling of accounts.

934
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,280
Oh. Does anyone have any change?

935
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,620
How much is...

936
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,740
Well, who do I give the sovereign to?

937
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,340
- Toss you for it, Honeychurch.
- All right.

938
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,940
- No, please.
- Tails.

939
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,700
I know I'm a sad spoilsport,
but it would make me wretched.

940
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,860
- I swear it was tails.
- It'd be practically robbing the one who lost.

941
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,380
Freddy owes me 15 shillings...

942
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,740
so it will work out all right
if you give the pound to me.

943
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,740
Fifteen shillings to you?

944
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,380
How so, Mr. Vyse?

945
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,300
Because 15 shillings
and five shillings make a pound.

946
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,220
Why is Mr. Vyse taking the quid?

947
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,220
Mmm, no, thank you. I'm done!

948
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,527
- Sit, Charlotte, and have a cup of tea.
- But what about Mr. Floyd's...

949
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,900
Oww!

950
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,140
And I shall never see
why Miss What's-her-name...

951
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,140
shouldn't pay the bob for the driver.

952
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,140
A shilling for the driver.

953
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,660
Of course. Yes.

954
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,660
How kind of you to remind me.

955
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,162
Oh, dear. Does anyone
have change for half a crown?

956
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,060
Cecil, give me that sovereign.

957
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,660
No, give it to me.

958
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,940
I'll get Mary to change it,
and we shall start from the beginning.

959
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,780
Oh, dear. I am sorry.

960
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,420
What a nuisance I am.

961
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,090
Wait...

962
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,524
Poor Charlotte!

963
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,411
Mary, have you got any change?

964
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,724
For a sovereign.

965
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,500
Have you told him about him?

966
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,940
No, I haven't told Cecil, or anyone.

967
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,660
I promised you I shouldn't.

968
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,820
Here's your money.
It's all shillings except two half crowns.

969
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,420
Would you count it?

970
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,091
You can settle your debt nicely now.

971
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,043
How dreadful.

972
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:30,740
How more than dreadful if Mr. Vyse should
hear about it from some other source.

973
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,340
There is no other source.

974
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,340
George would tell Mr. Emerson.

975
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,580
He would not.
He wouldn't have told anyone.

976
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,580
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

977
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,604
Shall we go out?
They'll strangle Minnie if we don't.

978
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,780
Dear, one moment. We may not have
this chance for a chat again.

979
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,700
Now, have you spoken to him yet?

980
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,916
I have seen him.

981
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,322
You simply must stop thinking that he
admires me or any nonsense of that sort.

982
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,660
He doesn't. Not one straw.

983
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,100
Freddy! Stop it!

984
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,500
No, poor Minnie.

985
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,763
No! Not me! Get off! No! No! Come on!

986
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,340
Lucy! Lucy! What's that book?

987
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,220
Who's been taking books
and leaving them out to spoil?

988
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,700
It's only a library book
Cecil's been reading.

989
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,610
Well, pick it up.
Don't stand there idling.

990
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,700
It's a special collection.
I forget what for.

991
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,700
But I do beg...

992
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,260
no vulgar clinking of ha'pennies
in the plate.

993
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,842
Make sure Minnie has a nice,
ripe sixpence. Where is the child?

994
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,100
Oh, dearest Marian, I'm so very sorry.

995
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,580
I don't seem to have any small change.
Could you...

996
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,603
Yes, easily. Just sit down.

997
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,803
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock.

998
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,700
Go on, Powell.

999
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,531
Good-bye. Be good.

1000
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,100
"No place on earth
as glorious as this...

1001
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,940
where love is spoken face to face.

1002
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,260
So he cried, 'Utter rapture!

1003
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,540
The silvered twilight,
the wheeling, wraith-like swallows...

1004
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,860
the perfume of the cooling earth...

1005
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:52,120
they all fill my heart with inutterable
and inestimable bliss."'

1006
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:57,165
"And so, locked in mortal combat
they brought to life the etern..."

1007
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,860
"They brought to life
the eternal battle...

1008
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:06,397
where men stand face to face
to slowly gird,

1009
01:20:06,497 --> 01:20:09,940
- to bravely fight, to stoutly dare"...
- 30-all.

1010
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,340
Listen, Lucy.

1011
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,780
Three split infinitives.

1012
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,220
- "And then the cry was heard...
- 40-30.

1013
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,460
'Once more into the breach,
my friends."'

1014
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,403
Victory, Mr. Floyd!

1015
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,340
"The scene is set in Florence.

1016
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,820
The sunset.

1017
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,649
The sunset of Italy."

1018
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,700
Did you mind losing?

1019
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,380
Of course I do.

1020
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,100
I don't think you're
such a splendid player though.

1021
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,580
The light was behind you
and it was in my eyes.

1022
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,900
Never said I was.

1023
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,660
"Under Orcagna's loggia...

1024
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,980
the Loggia de Lanzi,
as we sometimes call it now"...

1025
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,286
What's the title?

1026
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,820
Under a Loggia by Eleanor Lavish.

1027
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,820
Eleanor Lavish?

1028
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,300
My goodness!

1029
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,380
Do you remember Miss Lavish,
Mr. Emerson?

1030
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,020
- Yes, of course I do.
- No wonder the novel's so bad.

1031
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,020
Still, one ought to read it,
I suppose, if one's met her.

1032
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,300
There's an absurd account
of a view which I will spare you.

1033
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,420
Oh, no, do read it.

1034
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,820
What do you think of our view,
Mr. Emerson?

1035
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,900
My father says there's
only one perfect view...

1036
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,004
and that's the view
of the sky over our heads.

1037
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,573
I expect your father
has been reading Dante.

1038
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,020
Cecil, do read
the description of the view.

1039
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,700
- Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.
- No, no. Read away.

1040
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,860
Nothing's funnier than
having silly things read aloud.

1041
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,860
And if Mr. Emerson finds us frivolous,
he can go and look for tennis balls.

1042
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,780
Go and look for tennis balls,
Mr. Emerson.

1043
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,020
- Do I have to?
- No, of course not.

1044
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,205
It's in chapter two.
Just find me chapter two.

1045
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,780
Give it here.

1046
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,780
- No, really, honestly. It's the silliest thing.
- Come on.

1047
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,121
- C-Cecil!
- Thank you.

1048
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,020
Aha.

1049
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,060
"Afar off, the towers of Florence.

1050
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,460
And she wandered as though in a dream...

1051
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,260
through the wavering,
golden sea of barley...

1052
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,682
touched with crimson stains of poppies.

1053
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,900
All unobserved, he came to her."

1054
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,968
Isn't it immortal?

1055
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,803
"There came from his lips no wordy
protestations such as formal lovers use.

1056
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,100
No eloquence was his,
nor did he suffer from the lack of it.

1057
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,300
He simply enfolded her
in his manly arms."

1058
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,860
No, this isn't the bit.
There's another much funnier further on.

1059
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,726
- Should we go in to tea?
- By all means, tea rather than Eleanor Lavish.

1060
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,729
Excuse me.

1061
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,570
Charlotte, a minute.

1062
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,140
Cecil, ask Mary for sandwiches.

1063
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,925
I'll be with you in a moment.

1064
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,580
Do you know anything
about Miss Lavish's novel?

1065
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,860
There's a scene in it...
the hero and heroine make love.

1066
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,088
Do you know about that?

1067
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,420
Do you know about it?

1068
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,410
They're on a hillside,
and Florence is in the distance.

1069
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,260
There are poppies and a barley field.

1070
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,340
I can't believe it's a coincidence.
Charlotte, how could you have told her?

1071
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,300
Oh, Lucy.

1072
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,860
Oh, dearest girl.

1073
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,282
She hasn't put that in her novel.

1074
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,420
Then never...

1075
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,740
never, never more shall Eleanor Lavish
be a friend of mine.

1076
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:09,129
So you did tell. Why, when you
wouldn't even let me tell Mother?

1077
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,260
Cecil read it to me.

1078
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,260
And that man took the opportunity...

1079
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,900
to insult me again behind Cecil's back.

1080
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,420
Why did you tell her?

1081
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,522
What made you?

1082
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,780
Even if you forgive me,
I shall never forgive myself...

1083
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,450
till my dying day.

1084
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,484
Go and call him.

1085
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,060
Call Mr. Vyse?

1086
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,640
No. The other one.

1087
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,761
This time I'll deal with him myself.

1088
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,681
You missed a good match, Miss Bartlett.

1089
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,406
Charlotte, please stay.

1090
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,740
Mr. Emerson, go out of this house...

1091
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,340
and don't come back into it again
as long as I live here.

1092
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,046
- I can't.
- No discussion.

1093
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,008
Go, please.
I don't want to call in Mr. Vyse.

1094
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,940
You don't mean
you're going to marry that man?

1095
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,620
You're being ridiculous.

1096
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:42,940
Oh, I would have held back
if your Cecil had been a different person.

1097
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:48,001
But he's the sort who can't know anyone
intimately, least of all a woman.

1098
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:51,340
He doesn't know what a woman is.

1099
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,100
He wants you for a possession,
something to look at...

1100
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,460
like a painting or an ivory box.

1101
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,642
Something to own and to display.

1102
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,460
He doesn't want you to be real...

1103
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,140
to think and to live.

1104
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,460
He doesn't love you. But I love you.

1105
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,020
I want you to have your own thoughts
and ideas and feelings...

1106
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,820
even when I hold you in my arms.

1107
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,620
Miss Bartlett, you wouldn't stop us
this time, not if you understood.

1108
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,660
It's our last chance.

1109
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,180
Do you understand how lucky people are
when they find what's right for them?

1110
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,100
It's such a blessing. Don't you see?

1111
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,420
And the fact that I love Cecil
and shall be his wife shortly...

1112
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,300
I suppose that's
a detail of no importance.

1113
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,300
This tremendous thing
has happened between us...

1114
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,300
and what it means... let me explain...

1115
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,180
it means that nothing
must hinder us ever again.

1116
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,807
That's what it means.
You have to understand that.

1117
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,700
I've no idea what you're talking about.

1118
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,180
Everyone has to understand.

1119
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,580
And you must leave.

1120
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,460
It was wrong of me... very wrong...
to sit here listening to you.

1121
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,087
But you haven't been listening.
If you had, you would know.

1122
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,125
Leave at once. Now.

1123
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,140
- Lucy...
- No! No!

1124
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,380
I will not listen to one more word.

1125
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,860
- My dears, do stop.
- Haven't you done enough?

1126
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,008
Don't interfere again.

1127
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,805
It's useless.

1128
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,380
Let me go, Miss Bartlett.

1129
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,006
Let Mr. Emerson go, Charlotte.

1130
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,900
I shall never forgive myself.

1131
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,527
You always say that, Charlotte,
but you always do forgive yourself.

1132
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,700
What is it about Italy...

1133
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,740
that makes lady novelists
reach such summits of absurdity?

1134
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,900
Lucy, it's still light enough
for another set if you two'll hurry.

1135
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,460
- Mr. Emerson has had to go.
- Oh. What a nuisance.

1136
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,100
- I say, Cecil.
- Mm-hmm?

1137
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,980
Do play. There's a good chap.
Just this once.

1138
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,460
It's Floyd's last day.

1139
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,300
Freddy, as you well
remarked this morning...

1140
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,940
there are some chaps who are no good
for anything but books.

1141
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,203
I plead guilty to being such a chap.

1142
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,529
Because I wouldn't
play tennis with Freddy?

1143
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,460
I never do play tennis.

1144
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,060
I never could.

1145
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,020
Forget the tennis.
It was just the last straw.

1146
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,620
I'm sorry, Cecil. I can't marry you.

1147
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,690
One day you'll thank me for saying so.

1148
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,882
- We're too different.
- But I...

1149
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,323
I love you.

1150
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,700
And...

1151
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,500
I did think you loved me.

1152
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,250
I did not.

1153
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,282
I thought I did at first.

1154
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,842
I'm sorry.

1155
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:14,365
As for your loving me,
no, you don't, Cecil. Not really.

1156
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,220
You don't. It's only as something else.

1157
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,500
As something you own.

1158
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,460
A painting.

1159
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,020
A Leonardo.

1160
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,727
I don't want to be a Leonardo.
I want to be myself.

1161
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,780
Oh, let's not go on now.

1162
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,963
I'll only say things
that will make me unhappy afterwards.

1163
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,240
You don't love me, evidently.

1164
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:01,265
I daresay you're right
not to... but, uh...

1165
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,288
it would help a little,
hurt a little less, if I knew why.

1166
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,683
Because...

1167
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,689
you're the sort who can't know anyone
intimately, least of all a woman.

1168
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,380
Well, I don't mean exactly that...

1169
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,801
but you will go on asking questions.

1170
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,140
You wrap yourself up in art and books
and music, and you want to wrap me up.

1171
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,242
That's why I'm breaking off
my engagement.

1172
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,170
Well, it's true.

1173
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,644
True, on the whole.

1174
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,620
You're so different tonight...

1175
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,769
like a different person
speaking with a new voice.

1176
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,540
What do you mean by "a new voice"?

1177
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,540
If you think I'm in love with someone else,
you're very much mistaken.

1178
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,380
No, of course I don't.
I only meant that...

1179
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,580
there was a...

1180
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:57,729
a force in you
that I hadn't known of up to now.

1181
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,620
If a girl breaks off her engagement,
everyone thinks, "Oh, she has someone else.

1182
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,620
She hopes to get someone else."

1183
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,927
It's disgusting, brutal!

1184
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,210
You must forgive me
if I say stupid things.

1185
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,300
My brain has gone to pieces.

1186
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,404
I think I'd better go to bed,
if you don't mind.

1187
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,608
Let me do that for you.

1188
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:38,245
I must actually thank you
for what you've done...

1189
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,925
for showing me what I really am.

1190
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,081
I admire your courage.

1191
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,643
Will you shake hands?

1192
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,442
Of course I will, Cecil.

1193
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,660
Good night.

1194
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,444
I'm sorry about it.

1195
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,886
Thank you for taking it so well.

1196
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,700
Since the days
are getting chillier now...

1197
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,580
and we are not, alas,
settled in a home of our own...

1198
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:01,420
my sister feels we might benefit
by travel to a warmer clime.

1199
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,220
The doctor has ordered
her special digestive bread...

1200
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,100
but, after all,
we can take that with us.

1201
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,649
And it is only getting first
into a steamer and then into a train.

1202
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,900
Hello.

1203
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,340
- So you're off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?
- Yes.

1204
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,620
I've come over to show
Miss Honeychurch...

1205
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,100
the most delightful letter I got
from some friends of ours, the Miss Alans.

1206
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,420
Let me read you a little bit of it.

1207
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,420
"Since Florence did my sister
so much good...

1208
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,420
we do not see why we should not
try Athens this winter.

1209
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,940
Of course Athens is a plunge."

1210
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,460
Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it romantic?

1211
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,260
The Parthenon, no less.
The frieze of Phidias.

1212
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,340
- Have you ever met these Miss Alans?
- Never.

1213
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,620
Ah, well, then you're in no position to
appreciate the romance of this Greek visit.

1214
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,260
I've never been to Greece myself,
nor do I have any plans to do so.

1215
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:53,700
Altogether too big for our little lot.
Don't you agree?

1216
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,780
Got any matches?

1217
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,100
Thank you.

1218
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,660
You're quite right.

1219
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,340
Greece is not for our little lot.

1220
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,408
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1221
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,083
Mr. Beebe! Matches!

1222
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,844
Matches.

1223
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,860
Cecil's hard hit. Lucy won't marry him.

1224
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,980
- When?
- Late last night. I must go.

1225
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,220
- Will they want me to go down?
- Yes. Go on.

1226
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,448
Good-bye.

1227
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,550
All right, Powell.

1228
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,420
No, Charlotte. Not the scissors, thank you.
Not when both my hands are full.

1229
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,420
- Good afternoon.
- How do you do, Mr. Beebe?

1230
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,420
Good gracious! What a mess things are!

1231
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,965
Yes.

1232
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,180
Everyone's so horrid today,
Uncle Arthur.

1233
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,340
Let's go out to tea.

1234
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,900
Good idea.

1235
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,220
You get your hat and coat
and I'll take you.

1236
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,860
I think I'll take Minnie
to the Beehive Tavern.

1237
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,860
- Care to join us, Miss Bartlett?
- Oh, yes, Charlotte!

1238
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,020
- I don't want you to...
- Oh, no, thank you.

1239
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,980
- You have no one to help.
- Yes, do. Really, do.

1240
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,820
My poor services
are better than nothing.

1241
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,660
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1242
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,764
- Oh, dear Marian. I'm so sorry.
- Did you hurt yourself?

1243
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,803
Here's the most delightful letter
from the Miss Alans.

1244
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,140
They're planning
a thrilling trip to Greece.

1245
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,060
I must read you some of it.

1246
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,940
Now... "Dear Mr. Beebe...

1247
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:53,220
I do not expect we shall go
any further than Athens...

1248
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:57,580
but if you know of a really good
pensione in Constantinople...

1249
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,420
we should be so grateful."

1250
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,020
Constantinople. Isn't it delightful?

1251
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:06,060
I really believe they shall end
by going round the world.

1252
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,740
Delightful.

1253
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,920
Miss Honeychurch,
your brother has told me.

1254
01:36:17,067 --> 01:36:20,740
- Did he?
- I needn't say it will go no further.

1255
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:23,620
Mother. Charlotte.

1256
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,900
Cecil. Freddy.

1257
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,711
You.

1258
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:33,940
If you'll let me say so,
I'm certain you've done the right thing.

1259
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,100
But do tell me more
about the Miss Alans.

1260
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,460
How perfectly splendid
of them to go abroad.

1261
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,900
I-I-I want them to start from Venice...

1262
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,500
and then go by cargo steamer
down the Illyrian coast.

1263
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,380
Did Freddy say that he was
driving straight back?

1264
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,380
- No. No, he didn't.
- Oh.

1265
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,620
Because I hope he won't go gossiping.

1266
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,060
How perfectly splendid of them
to go abroad. I wish they'd take me.

1267
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:59,140
Would your mother
spare you again so soon?

1268
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:02,140
Well, she must spare me.
I simply must go away.

1269
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:05,140
I have to.
Don't you see I have to go away?

1270
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,140
Charlotte! Isn't it too romantic?

1271
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,140
The Miss Alans
are going to Constantinople.

1272
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,641
Uh, no, no. So far only to Athens.

1273
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,980
I've always longed to go
to Constantinople... Athens, I mean.

1274
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:20,260
In lieu of Constantinople, could not
Minnie and I lure you to tea at the Beehive?

1275
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,860
No, thank you.

1276
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:25,780
Oh, well, Minnie,
you and I must eat alone.

1277
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,451
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.

1278
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:38,380
- You must help me persuade Mother.
- What?

1279
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,970
Well, don't you see?

1280
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,540
I must go somewhere.

1281
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,540
Anywhere!

1282
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,060
I must get away, ever so far,
before it's known.

1283
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:50,060
- What?
- That I've broken off my engagement.

1284
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,060
He mustn't get any ideas.

1285
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,140
You mean Mr. Emerson
might think it's on his account?

1286
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,900
- Charlotte, how slow you are.
- Oh, of course.

1287
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,660
No, there must be no gossip at Summer
Street. But to go as far as Greece?

1288
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,660
Charlotte,
I thought you'd want to help me...

1289
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,540
that you'd be the first to go to Mother
and say, "Lucy must go to Greece at once."

1290
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,540
Oh, Lucy, are you absolutely sure?

1291
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,060
I only want to do what is right for you.
But go to Greece?

1292
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:16,084
I'm telling you what's right for me,
so please don't argue.

1293
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,362
- Do as I ask.
- Oh, all right.

1294
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,690
Thank you, Freddy.

1295
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,460
- Why does she look like that?
- Like what?

1296
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,340
Like Charlotte Bartlett.

1297
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:33,900
Because...

1298
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,606
she is Charlotte Bartlett.

1299
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:42,220

1300
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:47,540

Tune's right enough,
but the words are rotten.

1304
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:03,460
Marian?

1305
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,580
- Oh, Charlotte!
- Lucy has a plan.

1306
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,940
Isn't this a tragedy?

1307
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,420
No sooner do I get one thing tied up,
then another thing falls over.

1308
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,980
The Misses Alan are going abroad.
They're going to Greece.

1309
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,420
Well, good luck to them.

1310
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,490
Lucy would like to join them
as far as Athens.

1311
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,140
She'd what?

1312
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:26,484
And then on to Delphi,
if the roads are safe.

1313
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,820

1317
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,300
You can take all those.

1318
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:07,644
But leave me Thoreau till I go.
I need him by me now.

1319
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,020
It's an ugly house.

1320
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:12,929
We never liked it.

1321
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,780
Well, I mustn't miss the train.

1322
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,940
The removers can do the rest.

1323
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,660
- Oh, I...
- No.

1324
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,286
I don't want you straining your back.

1325
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,763
I won't be down at the weekend.
There's no point.

1326
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,962
I'll come to take you back to town
the week after.

1327
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,540
And paper soap is a great help...

1328
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:12,700
towards freshening up
one's face on a train.

1329
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,770
But you know all about these matters.

1330
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,690
And you have Mr. Vyse to help you.

1331
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,380
A gentleman is such a standby.

1332
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,820
We think it's so good
of Mr. Vyse to spare you.

1333
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,900
But perhaps he will come out
and join you later.

1334
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,460
Or does his work keep him in London?

1335
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,100
We shall meet him when he sees you off.

1336
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,180
No one will see Lucy off.
She doesn't like it.

1337
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:37,900
Really?

1338
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:42,791
- I should have thought in this case...
- Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren't going?

1339
01:41:42,891 --> 01:41:44,740
Yes, I'm afraid we must.
We have a train to catch.

1340
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,180
Oh. It's been such a pleasure
to have met you.

1341
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:53,100
We will write you often
a-and send pretty cards from every place.

1342
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,340
- We know how anxious you would be to hear.
- Thank you for taking her.

1343
01:41:59,341 --> 01:42:01,030
Bye-bye.

1344
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,603
Well, we just got through that time.

1345
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,724
Yes, and were seen through,
which is most unpleasant.

1346
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,684
I shall never understand
this hole and corner business.

1347
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,525
You got rid of Cecil. Well and good.

1348
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,940
I'm thankful. Why not announce it?

1349
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,420
I promised not to till I left England.
It's only for a few days.

1350
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,860
Victoria Station.

1351
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,660
I couldn't help thinking
that our dear Lucy did not...

1352
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,540
No.

1353
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,140
I wish you'd learn to finish
your sentences, Catharine.

1354
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,420
- You're getting worse and worse.
- Mmm.

1355
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,729
Did not look like a bride-to-be.

1356
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,650
Oh? Pray, how should a bride-to-be look?

1357
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:45,860
According to your great wisdom
and experience in these matters.

1358
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,860
Well, I can't say exactly how.

1359
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,820
Only that... she lacked something.

1360
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:55,180
And if you want to know,
Teresa, she lacked...

1361
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,009
radiance.

1362
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,740
- Miss Bartlett.
- Mr. Beebe.

1363
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,780
What is happening to your neighbors?

1364
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,900
Oh, alas, they're... they're moving out.

1365
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,900
Old Mr. Emerson's
rheumatism has come on...

1366
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,180
and George just thinks it's too far.

1367
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,740
In fact, Mr. Emerson is taking refuge
from the removers inside.

1368
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,860
Might I impose on your kindness
and wait here for Mrs. Honeychurch?

1369
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,180
By all means.
I'm afraid you must excuse me.

1370
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,442
As you can hear, they're getting on.

1371
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,404
Mr. Emerson, Miss Bartlett, excuse me.

1372
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,900
Oh, please.

1373
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,740
I am sorry, Mr. Emerson, to hear the house
has brought on your rheumatism.

1374
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,140
Oh, it's not the rheumatism.

1375
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,380
It's my boy.

1376
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,970
George is so sorry.

1377
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,060
Oh, I cannot blame him...

1378
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,300
but I wish he'd told me about it first.

1379
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:01,460
He never told you
what happened in Italy?

1380
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,164
Not one word.

1381
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,020
No.

1382
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,500
Lucy said he wouldn't.

1383
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,700
I was only told last Sunday.

1384
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,220
What were you told?

1385
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,084
That he loves her.

1386
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,140
Won't you... Won't you sit down?

1387
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:20,820
I-I... I think I hear the carriage.

1388
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:24,060
It would be most discourteous
to keep my cousin waiting.

1389
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:26,606
There isn't any carriage.

1390
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:29,209
Sit down, my dear.

1391
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,260
Everyone's been lying...

1392
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,340
except George.

1393
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:47,060
And now here's Miss Honeychurch
marrying Mr. Vyse in January.

1394
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,980
Miss Honeychurch
has broken off her engagement.

1395
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:54,820
It was all done with great tact
and discretion, naturally.

1396
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:59,180
And for the time being,
we would all like to keep it quiet.

1397
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,780
Oh, there's a time for
keeping quiet, Miss Bartlett...

1398
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,201
and there's a time for speaking out.

1399
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,540
Now, you don't hear any carriage.

1400
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:11,940
But why don't you sit back,
make yourself more comfortable?

1401
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,580
Here. Take this.

1402
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:17,524
There. Oh, you look much better.

1403
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,820
Oh, so, she, uh...

1404
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,220
she's not marrying Mr. Vyse.

1405
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:26,140
Why?

1406
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,730
Why Greece?

1407
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,049
Why go rushing off
to the ends of the earth?

1408
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,860
You're tired of your home.

1409
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,140
You're tired of Windy Corner.

1410
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,242
And you're tired of Freddy and me.

1411
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,980
Of course I'm not tired of Windy Corner.

1412
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,380
But as we're talking about it...

1413
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:50,540
I may as well say that in the future
I shall want to come up to London more.

1414
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:54,167
I might even share a flat
for a little with some other girl.

1415
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,326
You see, I come into my money next year.

1416
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,562
To mess about with typewriters
and latchkeys and call it work.

1417
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,180
Perhaps I spoke hastily.

1418
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:11,020
Oh, goodness, how you do remind me
of Charlotte Bartlett!

1419
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,340
- Charlotte?
- Charlotte.

1420
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,169
To a "T."

1421
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,020
I don't know what you mean.
Charlotte and I are not in the least alike.

1422
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:24,043
You never used to be.

1423
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,564
Can't we have the hood down?

1424
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,167
Can we have the hood down, Powell?

1425
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,620
Powell, is that house to be let again?

1426
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,166
Sir Harry's looking for new tenants,
I hear, miss.

1427
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,860
What a pity about the Emersons.

1428
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,900
Freddy'll be so sorry.

1429
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,020
And, indeed, so am I.

1430
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,140
All right, Powell, stop at the stores.

1431
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:06,004
Yes, ma'am. Walk on.

1432
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,620
They were such an agreeable family.

1433
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,449
What a pity.

1434
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,980
No Charlotte.

1435
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,980
Lucy, go and see
if she's at Mr. Beebe's.

1436
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,980
And do hurry, both of you...

1437
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,208
because Mary has her fish pie in.

1438
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,291
Did you hear what I said, Lucy?

1439
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,404
Lucy!

1440
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,940
Mr. Emerson says it's all his fault.

1441
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,900
Because I told him to trust to love.

1442
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,980
I told him, "George, love
and do what you will."

1443
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,140
It's what I taught him.

1444
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,720
So you see, it is all my fault.

1445
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,300
Where are you going?

1446
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:18,610
Your dear mother most kindly offered
to fetch me in her carriage...

1447
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:21,530
and I have not been brought up
to keep anyone waiting...

1448
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:24,007
least of all a kind hostess.

1449
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,980
And now where's Lucy?

1450
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,980
You get in, Charlotte.

1451
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:35,580
If Mary's fish pie spoils,
she'll mope from now till next Friday.

1452
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,340
- I will sit here.
- Nonsense.

1453
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,340
No, this will do me very well.
I mustn't inconvenience you.

1454
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:42,860
Oh, Charlotte!
You know you prefer facing.

1455
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,260
I've no wish to discuss your son
or even to hear his name mentioned.

1456
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,761
He has misbehaved from the first.

1457
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,340
Well, in fact, he's behaved abominably.

1458
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,500
Not abominably.

1459
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,967
He only tried
when he should not have tried.

1460
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,340
No, of course.

1461
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,205
"Abominable" is too strong a word.

1462
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:10,220
I'm sorry. It's no good
discussing this affair.

1463
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,290
George is coming
to take me up to London.

1464
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:16,927
He can't bear to be here,
and I must be where he is.

1465
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,380
He says the thought of...

1466
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,420
seeing you or hearing about you...

1467
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,460
Oh, Mr. Emerson, please don't go.
At least not on my account.

1468
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,210
I'm going to Greece.

1469
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:32,260
Don't leave your comfortable house.
You mustn't.

1470
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,601
Why are you going to Greece?

1471
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:40,300
Forgive me, my dear, but it seems to me
that you're in a muddle.

1472
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,740
Seems to me that the reason
you're going to Greece...

1473
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,740
the reason you've
broken off your engagement...

1474
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,340
Yes, Miss Bartlett told me...

1475
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:50,140
is that...

1476
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,980
you love George.

1477
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:58,420
All the light's
gone out of your pretty face.

1478
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:01,251
Just like it's gone out of George.

1479
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,500
I can't bear it,
and now I've made you cry.

1480
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,900
Dear girl, forgive me.

1481
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,620
But I've got to go to Greece now.

1482
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,020
The ticket's bought and everything.

1483
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,300
Oh, it's impossible.

1484
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,260
There's only one thing impossible.

1485
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,330
That's to love... and to part.

1486
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,284
Lucy!

1487
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,700
You love George.

1488
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,408
You love the boy body and soul,
as he loves you.

1489
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,100
But of course I do.

1490
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,020
What did you all think?

1491
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:40,540
- Then...
- No.

1492
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:43,820
Mother's calling. I've got to go.

1493
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,500
They trust me.

1494
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,204
Why should they...

1495
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,660
when you've deceived everyone...

1496
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,888
including yourself?

1497
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,980
Charlotte, come and sit here.

1498
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,082
- Go on, Powell.
- Walk on.

1499
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,740
One week Italy. The next week Greece.

1500
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,140
The plan for Greece may be canceled.

1501
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,140
- What?
- Oh, stop. Do stop!

1502
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,140
I think Lucy has something to tell us.

1503
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,163
- Stop the horse!
- Lucy?

1504
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,500
"Dear Cousin Charlotte...

1505
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:35,180
After an appalling journey during which our
luggage went missing not once, but twice...

1506
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,180
we reached Florence.

1507
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:41,660
You'll be glad to hear that the Pensione
Bertolini is entirely its own dear self.

1508
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,460
The Cockney signora still marches
up and down, terrorizing the staff.

1509
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:47,460
Even her guests appear
to be just another set...

1510
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,060
of Miss Alans, Miss Lavish, Mr. Beebe...

1511
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,700
and, indeed, Charlotte and Lucy."

1512
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:54,020
We were promised rooms with a view.

1513
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,620
Hush, dear. We mustn't.

1514
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:59,660
First thing tomorrow, I shall have
a bone to pick with the signora.

1515
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,540
But not now.

1516
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,860
It's so unfair.

1517
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,540
Don't you agree
that on one's first visit to Florence...

1518
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,860
one must have a room with a view?

1519
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,644
We have a view.

1520
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,890
Kiss me again.

1521
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:32,600
- And again.
- I'm reading.

1522
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:37,060
- What are you reading?
- It's from Freddy.

1523
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,844
What does he say?

1524
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,140
Silly boy.

1525
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,740
He thinks he's being dignified.

1526
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:47,740
I mean, everybody knew...

1527
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,525
we were going away in the spring.
