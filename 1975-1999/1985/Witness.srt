1
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:33,332
Jacob was a good farmer.

2
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:36,468
- None better.
- But not the man to buy a horse for you.

3
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:39,480
Hochleitner, wasn't it your father
sold him the horse...

4
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,550
with a ruptured testicle?

5
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:45,753
He told him it was a bee sting
that made him limp that way.

6
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:49,652
That horse had one good ball,
that's all it takes.

7
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,052
Rachel...

8
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:28,527
I'm sorry about Jacob.

9
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:31,796
I know he will walk with God.

10
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:34,363
Thank you, Daniel.

11
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,320
- She'll be here.
- I hope so.

12
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:43,187
Daniel.

13
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:48,970
So, first time to the big city?

14
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:52,664
You'll see so many things.

15
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:56,177
Close your eyes.

16
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:00,740
Open.

17
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,081
Samuel, careful!

18
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,389
You come back soon.

19
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:19,023
Samuel!

20
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,674
And you be careful out among the English.

21
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,106
Mama, look!

22
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:00,595
He's a cute little Amish boy.

23
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,670
Isn't he cute? I think so.

24
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:06,205
We have tickets to Baltimore.
Where is that train, please?

25
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:07,602
It's delayed three hours...

26
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,837
you'll hear it announced
when it's time to board.

27
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:11,572
- Take a seat right over there.
- But I...

28
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,773
Just take a seat.
I have to wait on these people.

29
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:15,213
- Yes, sir.
- Where?

30
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,683
Mama, look, what's that thing?

31
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,910
Don't go far, Samuel.

32
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:09,355
Mama?

33
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,727
It's over there.

34
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,930
Samuel.

35
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,443
Hey, man!

36
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:15,890
What the fuck you doing, man?

37
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,353
- Washing my hands, man.
- What?

38
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:23,162
- Let's get out of here.
- Hold tight.

39
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:42,711
I already did that.

40
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,479
Just checking again.

41
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:32,086
Move these people back,
they shouldn't be this close.

42
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:34,253
Get Schaeffer on the phone,
get him here, now.

43
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,625
Right.

44
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:38,495
- Precherd, who found the body?
- Right over there, sir.

45
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,431
How you doing, pop? You found the body?

46
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:42,799
Not me, daddy, I just reported it.
It was the kid.

47
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:44,769
- What kid?
- How the hell do I know what kid?

48
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:47,740
It was the kid
in the funny black threads. Over there.

49
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:49,908
Thanks, pop.

50
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:57,274
How's he doing?

51
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,417
I'm a police officer, ma'am.
I have to talk to the boy.

52
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,217
What's your name?

53
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:05,515
Samuel.

54
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:09,925
- Samuel Lapp.
- And he's your son?

55
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,031
We were on our way to Baltimore.

56
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,797
My sister is expecting us.
Soon our train is leaving.

57
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:19,305
We'll get you on another train.

58
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:22,241
Sam, the man who was killed tonight...

59
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:26,975
was a policeman, and it's my job
to find out what happened.

60
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,350
I want you to tell me everything you saw
when you went in the bathroom.

61
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,250
There were two.

62
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:40,520
- There were two men?
- I only saw one.

63
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,055
Does anybody know about this?

64
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,600
No, nobody's had a chance to talk to him.

65
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:49,602
What did he look like?
The man that you saw.

66
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,799
He was like him.

67
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,844
He was a black man? He had black skin?

68
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,644
But not <i>schtumpig. </i>

69
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,778
<i>Schtumpig?</i> What's <i>schtumpig?</i>

70
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:06,376
On a farm,
when a pig is born small like that...

71
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,251
he's <i>schtumpig. </i>

72
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:10,218
A runt.

73
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:15,958
So, he wasn't a runt.

74
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,931
He was a big guy, like me?

75
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:21,992
Big guy.

76
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:25,702
<i>Subject is armed. He's wanted</i>
<i>for the stabbing deaths of a narcotic... </i>

77
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:27,638
I should have been there, John.

78
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:29,710
I told you.

79
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:34,037
That's not the point. That's the risk.

80
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:37,084
Undercover, one mistake,
bang, they kill you...

81
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:39,119
Where are you taking us?

82
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,119
I'm sorry.

83
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:44,452
We're looking for a suspect.

84
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,392
We got reason to believe
he's still in the neighborhood.

85
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:49,396
I want the little boy to take a look at him.

86
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:51,898
You have no right to keep us here.

87
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:56,496
Yes, I do. Your son
is a material witness to a homicide.

88
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:59,934
You don't understand.
We want nothing to do with your laws.

89
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,639
Doesn't surprise me.

90
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:06,136
A lot of people I meet are like that.

91
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,378
What did he say?

92
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:18,053
He asked who you are. Your name.

93
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,027
I told him we didn't need
to know anything about you.

94
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,999
Book. John Book.

95
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:35,900
Hey, man, where're you hiding?

96
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,967
Have a seat.
Young blood, where're you going?

97
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,683
Looking good, T-Bone.

98
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:19,449
- Hey, man, how're you doing?
- What the fuck?

99
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:26,356
- I'll sue you, man!
- Gotta get his arm. Let's get his arm.

100
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:30,060
Is this the man, Sam? Is this him?

101
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,060
You sure?

102
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:36,267
- Back off.
- You listen to me.

103
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:38,498
I want no further part of this,
nor does my son.

104
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:41,940
Okay. Get back in the car.

105
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:49,077
Honest mistake, all right.

106
00:20:54,322 --> 00:20:56,790
- John, what are we gonna do with them?
- What?

107
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,858
A hotel or what?

108
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:00,223
Put them in a hotel,
they won't be there in the morning.

109
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:03,627
- I'll have to send to Baltimore for them.
- Well, what?

110
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,932
I got it.

111
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:12,764
This is my sister, Elaine.
This is Mrs. Lapp and Samuel.

112
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,604
Where do you want them, Elaine?
The back bedroom, blue room?

113
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,076
Yeah, sure. The blue room.

114
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:22,149
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

115
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,114
Right back there, Sam. It's in the back.

116
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,120
How could you do this to me tonight?

117
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,714
It's important.

118
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:34,491
Just keep going straight through,
there's a folding cot for your son.

119
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:36,791
He turned on the light, good.

120
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,393
I told you I had company.

121
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:44,335
- Where's Jason and Billy?
- Upstairs, asleep.

122
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,532
You got a man in the house
and the kids are upstairs?

123
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:49,974
That's none of your business.
So keep your holier-than-thou mouth shut.

124
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:52,739
- Anyway, they like Fred.
- Fred? Now we got a Fred.

125
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:56,040
- Who are these orphans, anyway?
- They're Amish.

126
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,820
- Everything okay?
- Yes. Thank you.

127
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,530
- John says you're Amish.
- Yes.

128
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:29,750
Do we have to stay here?

129
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:32,617
No, we don't. Just for the night.

130
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:37,249
Say your prayers.

131
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,191
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi, Bob.

132
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,296
When can we leave the city?

133
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:54,569
I'm trying to get this over with
as quick as I can, then you can go.

134
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:55,870
Good.

135
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:59,344
Samuel's probably going to have to
come back and testify. I'm sorry.

136
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:00,914
No, you're not, you're glad.

137
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:03,609
- Glad?
- Because now you have a witness.

138
00:23:03,785 --> 00:23:05,252
Yeah, now I got a witness.

139
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:09,983
I just don't like my son spending all
his time with a man who carries a gun...

140
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,992
- and goes around whacking people.
- Whacking?

141
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:18,955
Come here, kiddo.

142
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:21,863
Big guy.

143
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:27,433
Now, don't be frightened.
You can see them, but they can't see you.

144
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:31,069
I want the hats and the sunglasses off.
Straighten up.

145
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:36,183
I want you to tell me if any of these men...

146
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:40,152
are the man that you saw in the bathroom.
Take your time.

147
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,483
Look real carefully.

148
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:51,829
Make sure.

149
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:54,902
Are you sure?

150
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:58,163
Okay.

151
00:23:58,273 --> 00:23:59,968
Three dogs to stay.

152
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:04,208
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

153
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:14,388
- These, we call wurst.
- Sure.

154
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,720
Your sister said you don't have a family.

155
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,726
No, I don't.

156
00:24:56,865 --> 00:25:00,062
She thinks that you ought to get
married and have children of your own...

157
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:03,501
- instead of trying to be a father to hers.
- Oh, yeah?

158
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:07,341
Except she thinks
you're afraid of the responsibility.

159
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,544
That's interesting, anything else?

160
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:14,973
Yeah.

161
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:19,916
She said that
she thinks that you like policing...

162
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:22,148
because you think
you're right about everything...

163
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,884
and that you're the only one
who can do anything.

164
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:26,688
And that...

165
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:30,295
when you drink a lot of beer,
you say things like:

166
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:34,924
"None of the other police know a crook...

167
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,297
"from a bag of elbows. "

168
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:43,938
I believe that's what she said.

169
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,039
Good appetite.

170
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:03,991
Captain.

171
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:07,434
- Yeah?
- Sgt. Carter for you on Line 23.

172
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:09,697
Thanks.

173
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,139
How are you doing?

174
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:20,370
- I don't know.
- Little boy.

175
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:23,582
Look, he's shy.

176
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,283
Hey! Knock it off.

177
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:09,662
Knock it off!

178
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:05,810
I'll get it.

179
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:11,415
- Hi.
- Hi, Kathy.

180
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:13,353
Dad!

181
00:29:14,122 --> 00:29:16,386
- Hello, Marilyn.
- Hi, John.

182
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:23,093
It's McFee, Paul. He's one of them, anyway.

183
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:25,629
Positive ID from the Amish kid.

184
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:31,670
McFee? Lieutenant Narcotics?

185
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,766
Right.

186
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,799
I hope you don't have any doubt about that.

187
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,909
It all fits, Paul. Four years ago...

188
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:43,505
Narcotics runs a raid
in which, amongst other things...

189
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:46,912
550 gallons of this P-2-P stuff is confiscated.

190
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,185
They put it in Police Storage.

191
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:53,724
Philadelphia supplies all the major cities
in the country with speed.

192
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,659
They need this P-2-P stuff
to make the speed.

193
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:59,665
They pay up to $5,000 a pint for it.

194
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,935
I call Police Storage...

195
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,028
no record of 1055-gallon drums of P-2-P.

196
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,772
That's $22 million, Paul.

197
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:12,840
Guess who ran the raid four years ago?

198
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:15,144
- McFee.
- Right.

199
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:20,348
- Have you talked to him about it?
- No. On vacation, Florida.

200
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,147
All right, what do you need to clean this up?

201
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,089
People from outside the department.

202
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:29,828
Put some guys on this McFee,
watch him, wait him out.

203
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:33,389
Right. FBI or maybe somebody
from Treasury. I'll take care of that.

204
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:36,128
I want maximum security on this.
Where's the boy?

205
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:37,293
At my sister's house.

206
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:40,101
He's going to have to be moved.
Who else knows about this?

207
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,335
- Just you and I.
- Let's leave it that way.

208
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,331
Twila, get back!

209
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,198
Police! Back in the elevator!

210
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:47,366
That's our car!

211
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,306
- Get in the elevator!
- I don't give a shit.

212
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,377
You idiot!

213
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:51,911
Get down!

214
00:31:58,486 --> 00:32:00,215
I know you, asshole!

215
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:36,947
- It's John. He says you have to leave now.
- What?

216
00:32:37,058 --> 00:32:40,084
He says it's urgent. I don't know.
Get dressed quickly.

217
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:44,258
John!

218
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:48,667
Put my car in the garage
and close the door.

219
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:51,405
John, I don't understand any of this.

220
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:53,700
You don't know anything. Okay?

221
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:57,169
I borrowed your car. All right?
I didn't say why.

222
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:01,510
You never heard of that woman
and her boy.

223
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:04,774
John, please tell me why.

224
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,218
Just do it.

225
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:11,849
- You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
- Well, I was wrong.

226
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:23,093
Did you deliver the kid's interview
to Schaeffer?

227
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:25,229
No.

228
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:29,541
I want all the paperwork
on this job disappeared tonight...

229
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:30,803
you understand?

230
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:33,046
John, do you know
what you're telling me to do?

231
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:34,772
Just do it, man.

232
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,347
I'm going to disappear for a couple of days.

233
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,420
John, what's going on, man?
What is happening?

234
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,056
I'll call you when I can.

235
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,284
And, partner, watch your back.

236
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,159
Schaeffer's in this thing, too.

237
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,251
- Shit!
- What're you doing?

238
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:14,878
Working late, man.

239
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,655
What's going on?

240
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,096
That's it.

241
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:45,349
Hey, Fergie?

242
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:48,213
Told you I hit him.

243
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:52,050
He's in trouble. I want to help him.
I want you to help him.

244
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,559
- We need to know where he is.
- What kind of trouble?

245
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:56,857
It's a departmental matter,
don't worry about it.

246
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,023
If we can talk to him,
we can straighten it out.

247
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,828
- A departmental matter?
- Right.

248
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:04,200
- He's involved in something illegal?
- I'm afraid so.

249
00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:08,236
Anybody who knows John
knows that's a goddamn lie.

250
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:11,243
Of course it is, Elaine.
But as long as there's any doubt...

251
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:13,779
it's better that John
should come in and clear his name.

252
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,748
It's better you should get off my property.

253
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:20,417
I don't want to have to take you in
for questioning.

254
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,179
He left with the Amish woman, right?

255
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,856
- She say where he is?
- I don't think she knows.

256
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,090
- What about Carter?
- Tight.

257
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,567
But I'm working on him.

258
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:03,823
Samuel!

259
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:06,433
Poppa.

260
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:18,302
You should rest.

261
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,214
I'll make us some coffee.

262
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,940
No, I can't stay.

263
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:38,324
Will you be coming back
to take Samuel to trial?

264
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,694
There isn't going to be any trial.

265
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,262
Rachel?

266
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:49,738
What happened? Who was that man?

267
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:15,902
Mama.

268
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:22,667
John?

269
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,706
My God, why didn't you get to a hospital?

270
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:29,146
No doctor.

271
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,951
Gunshot wound,
they have to make a report...

272
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:35,781
and if they make a report, they find me...

273
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:38,220
and if they find me, they find the boy.

274
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:00,480
- Is the English dead?
- No.

275
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:02,045
Looks dead.

276
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,895
Come.

277
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:35,915
He's upstairs.

278
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,932
I feel burning.

279
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:05,470
The bullet entered there...

280
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:08,742
and came out there.

281
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:13,011
There's danger of infection.

282
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:16,550
He's lost a great deal of blood.
I'm not a doctor.

283
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:19,992
This man should be treated in a hospital.

284
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,762
- There's nothing I can do for him.
- No.

285
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:25,094
No. He must stay here.

286
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,926
What if he dies?

287
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,568
Then the Sheriff will come here.
They'll say we broke their laws.

288
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,766
But then we must pray that he doesn't die...

289
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,935
but if he does, then we must find a way,
so no one knows.

290
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:41,071
But, Rachel, this is a man's life.
We hold it in our hands.

291
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:42,148
I know that.

292
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:46,442
God help me, I know that, Eli.
But I'll tell you if he's found...

293
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:49,986
the people who did this to him
will come get Samuel.

294
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:56,425
Then make a poultice.

295
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,293
Three parts milk, two parts linseed oil,
for the infection.

296
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:04,560
I will send Mary by with some teas
I will brew myself.

297
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:07,770
Thank you.

298
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:25,748
Lapp, I'll have to speak with the elders
on this matter.

299
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:27,716
As you see fit.

300
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:55,712
You shouldn't.

301
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:57,882
Don't do it.

302
00:41:58,118 --> 00:41:59,983
I'll fucking kill you.

303
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,219
You asshole.

304
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,319
He's the murderer.

305
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,267
John?

306
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:17,126
Are you trying to tell me that
there's no way we can locate this woman?

307
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:20,730
We're talking about 20th century
law enforcement, Sergeant.

308
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,632
<i>Well, there's your problem, Chief. </i>
<i>Your Amish man doesn't live... </i>

309
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:26,205
<i>in the 20th century,</i>
<i>doesn't think in the 20th century. </i>

310
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:28,331
<i>Chief, if the Amish have taken your man in... </i>

311
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,172
<i>I wouldn't want to hang from a rope</i>
<i>until you find him. </i>

312
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:35,040
The problem is, about every third
Amish man around here is named Lapp.

313
00:43:35,582 --> 00:43:38,312
<i>And we've got upwards</i>
<i>of 14,000 Amish men around here. </i>

314
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:42,718
- <i>That's just Lancaster County. Over in</i>...
- Very interesting, Sergeant...

315
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:45,347
but this is a very important matter.

316
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,426
It involves the murder of a police officer.

317
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,196
Now, there must be a directory of some sort
of these people somewhere.

318
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,927
Sure. Tax rolls, voter registration...

319
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:59,499
but right now, I don't have the manpower
to send a deputy to every Lapp farm...

320
00:43:59,606 --> 00:44:02,200
<i>in Lancaster County</i>
<i>to see if they've got your Rachel. </i>

321
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,210
Maybe, Sergeant,
you could do a little telephoning?

322
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:07,007
Yeah, maybe I could.

323
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:10,908
But since the Amish don't have any phones,
I wouldn't know who to call.

324
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:16,980
Thank you, Sergeant. It's been an education.

325
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:39,578
Who are they?

326
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,978
The leadership of our district.

327
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:44,949
They decided to come see you
for themselves.

328
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:46,744
Except Stoltzfus.

329
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:48,684
He came the first day.

330
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:51,983
- I think he saved your life.
- No, that was not I.

331
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:57,421
- Who else knows I'm here?
- No one.

332
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,157
How long have I been here?

333
00:45:01,301 --> 00:45:02,529
Two days.

334
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,233
Rest, Mr. Book, that's the ticket.

335
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:11,070
And drink my tea, lots of my tea.

336
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:25,491
Tell him his tea stinks.

337
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:27,992
You can tell him when you're able.

338
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,700
We're all very happy
that you're going to live, John Book.

339
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:41,604
We didn't know what we were
going to do with you if you died.

340
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:54,719
It's not our place to ask how he came to us.

341
00:45:55,288 --> 00:45:57,654
He'll leave as soon as he's able.

342
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:38,529
Don't move!

343
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,462
What are you doing?

344
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,175
Come here.

345
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:52,036
Come here, Samuel. Sit down.

346
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:58,681
This is a loaded gun. This is very dangerous.

347
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,109
Never, ever...

348
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:03,984
touch a loaded gun.

349
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:09,452
Now I'm taking the bullets out,
now it's safe. Okay?

350
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:11,757
Okay, Mr. Book.

351
00:47:12,532 --> 00:47:14,261
Look, call me John.

352
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:17,435
I just don't want you to get hurt.

353
00:47:17,537 --> 00:47:20,404
I don't mean to yell at you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

354
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,943
Look, it's all right for you to look at it now,
it's unloaded. It's safe.

355
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:28,304
You want to handle it,
you can handle it while I'm here...

356
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:31,942
but that, that's not right.

357
00:47:43,396 --> 00:47:46,695
Samuel, wait for me downstairs.

358
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:55,430
John Book, while you're in this house,
I insist that you respect our ways.

359
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:56,668
Right.

360
00:47:57,477 --> 00:47:58,967
Here, take it.

361
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,140
Put it somewhere where it's safe.
Where he won't find it.

362
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:21,731
This gun of the hand
is for the taking of human life.

363
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:26,228
We believe it is wrong to take life.

364
00:48:27,607 --> 00:48:29,404
That is only for God.

365
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:34,109
Many times the wars have come...

366
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:38,177
and people have said to us...

367
00:48:38,385 --> 00:48:41,616
you must fight, you must kill.

368
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:44,951
It is the only way to preserve the good.

369
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:48,526
But, Samuel...

370
00:48:50,397 --> 00:48:53,389
there is never only one way. Remember that.

371
00:48:56,303 --> 00:48:58,362
Would you kill another man?

372
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,067
I would only kill a bad man.

373
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,345
Only the bad man, I see.

374
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:09,938
And you know these bad men by sight?

375
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:14,981
You are able to look into their hearts
and see this badness?

376
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:18,988
I can see what they do.

377
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:21,550
I have seen it.

378
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:26,822
And having seen, you've become
one of them. Don't you understand?

379
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,767
What you take into your hands...

380
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,741
you take into your heart.

381
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:41,174
"Wherefore come out from among them...

382
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:43,346
"and be ye separate...

383
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:45,942
"saith the Lord...

384
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:51,722
"and touch not the unclean thing. "

385
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:57,056
Go and finish your chores now.

386
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,857
Yes, Grandfather.

387
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:14,139
- Enjoying your reading?
- Oh, yeah.

388
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:17,274
Learning a lot about manure.

389
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:19,810
Very interesting.

390
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,091
What's that?

391
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:29,825
Your clothes are stained with blood.

392
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:32,659
I have them soaking. You can wear these.

393
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:36,993
- They your husband's?
- Yes.

394
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:41,572
It's good that someone
can have the use of them.

395
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:45,142
Besides, in your clothes,
you'd stand out to strangers.

396
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:54,985
I should tell you that this kind of coat
doesn't have buttons.

397
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:56,383
See?

398
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:59,549
- Hooks and eyes.
- Something wrong with buttons?

399
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:01,388
Buttons are <i>hochmut. </i>

400
00:51:01,928 --> 00:51:04,192
Proud, vain, it's not plain.

401
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:08,694
Got anything against zippers?

402
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:11,999
You making fun of me?

403
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:14,662
No.

404
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:19,438
Like the tourists.

405
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:23,511
Staring all the time.

406
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:29,616
Sometimes they come into the yard.
It's very rude.

407
00:51:31,624 --> 00:51:35,924
- They seem to think we're quaint.
- Can't imagine why they'd think that.

408
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,358
Look, is there a phone somewhere near?

409
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,933
The Gunter's across the valley.

410
00:51:45,071 --> 00:51:48,165
They're Mennonites.
They have cars and refrigerators.

411
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:51,334
No, I mean a pay phone, a public phone.

412
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,602
The store at Strasburg...

413
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:57,241
but you won't be going to Strasburg
for a while.

414
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:59,851
I'm going this morning.

415
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:03,914
- But Stoltzfus said that you had...
- Yeah, I know what he said.

416
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,157
You can go with Eli.

417
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:13,125
He's taking Samuel to school.

418
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,234
- But you'd better hurry.
- Rachel...

419
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:21,267
Nothing.

420
00:52:43,763 --> 00:52:44,821
What?

421
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:52,037
Hurry up, John Book.

422
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,204
You'd better get going.

423
00:52:57,076 --> 00:52:58,805
Hurry up, John Book.

424
00:53:00,947 --> 00:53:02,107
My gun.

425
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:04,383
I need my gun.

426
00:53:20,366 --> 00:53:21,526
Thanks.

427
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:25,101
The bullets?

428
00:53:25,805 --> 00:53:28,103
It's not much good without them.

429
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:29,905
Of course.

430
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:42,384
Thank you.

431
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:52,398
How do I look? I mean, do I look Amish?

432
00:53:55,168 --> 00:53:56,658
You look plain.

433
00:53:58,004 --> 00:53:59,062
Okay.

434
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:42,008
He's an Englishman.

435
00:54:53,926 --> 00:54:56,156
- Carter here.
- <i>Hey, partner, how you doing?</i>

436
00:54:56,262 --> 00:54:58,321
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Yeah.

437
00:54:58,631 --> 00:54:59,757
You?

438
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:03,233
I'm coming in to take care of business.
How hot am I?

439
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:04,530
Too hot.

440
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:06,897
Don't do it. Don't come in.

441
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,068
- They're looking for you.
- <i>And the kid. </i>

442
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:14,042
- <i>Man, I got to make a move. </i>
- Listen, John, don't do it.

443
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,647
You couldn't get
within a mile of Schaeffer right now.

444
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,115
You hear me?

445
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:23,520
- <i>Yeah. </i>
- What are we going to do?

446
00:55:23,723 --> 00:55:25,247
FBI? What?

447
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:26,784
Maybe.

448
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:31,130
<i>Well, what about one of those</i>
<i>investigative reporters?</i>

449
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:34,395
No, it's too risky.
They'd want to talk to the kid.

450
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,966
Listen, I'll make a couple of calls.

451
00:55:37,136 --> 00:55:38,933
Let you know when maybe you can come in.

452
00:55:39,038 --> 00:55:42,735
- I got to go, take care of yourself.
- Yeah. You, too.

453
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:17,201
Here.

454
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:22,443
Don't put them in the peaches.

455
00:56:25,685 --> 00:56:27,243
See this stream?

456
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:31,446
It goes to the wheel
and it makes the wheel turn around.

457
00:56:32,024 --> 00:56:34,549
And then it goes, it makes...

458
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:39,423
this wire pump the pump...

459
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,600
over there, into the well...

460
00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:46,200
and the well's water goes into the house.

461
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:48,565
Yeah?

462
00:56:51,644 --> 00:56:53,635
This place really echoes.

463
00:56:54,113 --> 00:56:55,239
Hello!

464
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:59,108
- What's up there?
- Corn.

465
00:57:01,454 --> 00:57:03,820
Would you like to hold my kitten?

466
00:57:04,357 --> 00:57:07,155
I'll show you how to do a back rub on him.

467
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,660
You hold them like that.

468
00:57:09,996 --> 00:57:13,659
You push their head back,
and you start rubbing the neck.

469
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:25,235
Is that you, Book?

470
00:57:26,412 --> 00:57:27,709
What you doing there?

471
00:57:36,756 --> 00:57:39,452
Just trying to get the car started,
the battery.

472
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:42,058
If you are well enough to do that...

473
00:57:42,628 --> 00:57:45,597
- you can do work for me.
- Yeah, what can I do?

474
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:49,635
- Milking, maybe.
- Milking?

475
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:52,160
Cows, you know.

476
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:55,174
Yeah, I've seen pictures.

477
00:57:55,908 --> 00:57:57,899
Good. You start tomorrow.

478
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:22,126
It's 4:30, time for milking.

479
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:49,617
Milking stool.

480
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:52,693
Milking hat. There's the milk.

481
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:05,668
Firm grip. Pinch the top off and squeeze.

482
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:10,647
Didn't you hear me? Squeeze.

483
00:59:11,284 --> 00:59:12,774
I am squeezing.

484
00:59:13,986 --> 00:59:16,750
You never had you hands on a teat before?

485
00:59:17,256 --> 00:59:18,883
Not one this big.

486
00:59:28,968 --> 00:59:31,402
I got it!

487
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,864
I think.

488
00:59:42,181 --> 00:59:44,649
- Come on.
- Gently, gently.

489
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:47,719
Don't frighten her, Book!

490
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:51,755
Samuel, help him.

491
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:11,901
- No, please.
- Eat, Book.

492
01:00:12,512 --> 01:00:14,707
What's the matter with your appetite?

493
01:00:14,814 --> 01:00:17,214
I'm not used to eating
in the middle of the night.

494
01:00:17,316 --> 01:00:20,843
Not used to hard work.
That's what makes appetite.

495
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,978
Rachel.

496
01:00:25,591 --> 01:00:27,024
Samuel.

497
01:00:30,363 --> 01:00:32,923
Honey, that's great coffee.

498
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:38,635
It's a joke.

499
01:00:39,138 --> 01:00:43,199
It's a commercial on television.

500
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,787
- Book, is it?
- Yeah.

501
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,691
You are the Yankee they talk about.

502
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:08,589
I thought I was the English.

503
01:01:08,701 --> 01:01:10,999
English, Yankee, it is the same.

504
01:01:11,337 --> 01:01:14,829
My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochleitner.

505
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:17,165
How do you do?

506
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,772
You look plain, Book. Very plain.

507
01:01:27,553 --> 01:01:29,316
I came to see Rachel.

508
01:02:49,368 --> 01:02:51,928
Eli said I could use his tools.

509
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,430
I'm trying to fix that birdhouse.

510
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:05,814
- I brought you some lemonade.
- Oh, great.

511
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:17,322
Thanks.

512
01:03:24,603 --> 01:03:27,595
- What happened to Hochleitner?
- He went home.

513
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,640
He's a friend of the family.
He's like a son to Eli.

514
01:03:36,215 --> 01:03:39,707
- You know carpentry.
- Yeah.

515
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:44,054
- A bit.
- Can you do anything else?

516
01:03:48,394 --> 01:03:51,022
Whacking. I'm hell at whacking.

517
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:55,133
Whacking is not much use on a farm.

518
01:04:00,973 --> 01:04:04,238
Tomorrow I'll let out those trousers for you.

519
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:07,471
Good.

520
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:19,390
I told Eli that you're a carpenter.

521
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:22,154
Hold this up closer, will you?

522
01:04:24,997 --> 01:04:27,966
He said you could come
to Zook's barn raising.

523
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:31,069
Well, if I'm still here.

524
01:04:36,142 --> 01:04:38,337
<i>Weenie roasts. I don't know anything</i>
<i>about weenie roasts. </i>

525
01:04:38,444 --> 01:04:41,845
<i>That's a West Coast thing. </i>
<i>Let's have some letters on weenie roasts. </i>

526
01:04:44,483 --> 01:04:45,780
<i>Presenting golden oldies. </i>

527
01:04:45,885 --> 01:04:48,649
<i>We've got some great ones</i>
<i>and some old ones coming right up. </i>

528
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:51,279
<i>Here's one, takes me back,</i>
<i>I'm afraid to say it dates me. </i>

529
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,085
<i>Maybe it dates you. </i>

530
01:04:56,295 --> 01:04:58,889
This is great. This is the best.

531
01:05:53,853 --> 01:05:56,549
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

532
01:06:51,143 --> 01:06:52,508
Rachel!

533
01:06:57,049 --> 01:06:58,209
Rachel?

534
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:31,579
What is it with you? Is this the Ordnung?

535
01:07:31,684 --> 01:07:33,982
I have done nothing against
the rule of the Ordnung.

536
01:07:34,086 --> 01:07:35,383
Nothing?

537
01:07:35,487 --> 01:07:39,253
You bring this man to our house
with his gun of the hand.

538
01:07:40,593 --> 01:07:42,493
You bring fear to this house.

539
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:45,826
Fear of English with guns coming after him...

540
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:48,229
I've committed no sin.

541
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:51,067
Maybe. Maybe not yet.

542
01:07:51,403 --> 01:07:53,701
But, Rachel, it does not look...

543
01:07:54,473 --> 01:07:56,634
You know there has been talk.

544
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:58,823
Talk about going to the Bishop
and having you shunned.

545
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:00,704
Talk about going to the Bishop
and having you shunned.

546
01:08:00,913 --> 01:08:02,505
That is idle talk.

547
01:08:02,615 --> 01:08:04,913
Do not take it lightly. Rachel!

548
01:08:06,285 --> 01:08:07,775
They can do it.

549
01:08:08,721 --> 01:08:10,951
They can do it just like that.

550
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:15,325
You know what it means, shunning?

551
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:20,028
I cannot sit at table with you.

552
01:08:20,532 --> 01:08:23,126
I cannot take a thing from your hand.

553
01:08:24,403 --> 01:08:26,769
I cannot go to worship with you.

554
01:08:27,973 --> 01:08:29,497
Child...

555
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:32,267
do not go so far.

556
01:08:33,846 --> 01:08:36,610
- I am not a child.
- But you are acting like one.

557
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:39,013
- I'll be the judge of that.
- No.

558
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:43,154
They will be the judge of that, and so will I.

559
01:08:44,757 --> 01:08:48,318
- Lf you shame me...
- You shame yourself.

560
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:01,704
Why don't you tell me where he is?

561
01:09:02,307 --> 01:09:04,070
You know, don't you?

562
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:10,740
I just want to talk to him.

563
01:09:12,317 --> 01:09:14,683
I wanna talk some sense into him.

564
01:09:16,155 --> 01:09:18,146
You know, we go way back.

565
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:21,618
John and I were a team once.

566
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:25,091
Like you two are now.

567
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,267
I trained him.

568
01:09:31,403 --> 01:09:33,268
He's a fine policeman.

569
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:41,303
I know he's with the Amish.

570
01:09:44,683 --> 01:09:47,277
God, I'd give anything to see him now.

571
01:09:50,723 --> 01:09:53,317
Can you see John at a prayer meeting?

572
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:05,733
We're like the Amish.

573
01:10:07,473 --> 01:10:09,100
We're a cult, too.

574
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:14,238
A club. With our own rules.

575
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,509
John has broken those rules.

576
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:23,814
As you're breaking them now.

577
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:02,283
I hear you're a carpenter.

578
01:11:04,163 --> 01:11:08,259
- Well, it's been a while.
- No matter, we can always use a good one.

579
01:11:09,334 --> 01:11:12,861
Hurry up now.
We have a barn to raise and a day to do it.

580
01:11:21,814 --> 01:11:23,111
Good luck.

581
01:11:24,483 --> 01:11:27,452
Your hole is better now?

582
01:11:28,387 --> 01:11:30,048
Yeah, it's pretty much healed.

583
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,950
Good, then you can go home.

584
01:16:54,713 --> 01:16:58,205
Everyone has an idea
about you and the Englishman Book.

585
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:01,484
All of them charitable, I'm sure.

586
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:04,216
Hardly any of them.

587
01:17:24,309 --> 01:17:25,276
Amos.

588
01:17:28,914 --> 01:17:30,973
This is Lidia and Amos.

589
01:17:31,316 --> 01:17:33,284
- John Book.
- Hello.

590
01:17:33,752 --> 01:17:36,312
It's their barn you built today.

591
01:17:36,788 --> 01:17:38,517
- We just got married.
- Yeah?

592
01:17:40,525 --> 01:17:41,188
That's great.

593
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:41,852
That's great.

594
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:29,318
Rachel?

595
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:52,550
Rachel.

596
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:01,659
If we'd made love last night,
I'd have to stay.

597
01:21:04,796 --> 01:21:06,661
Or you'd have to leave.

598
01:21:24,716 --> 01:21:26,707
Get off the bus, everybody!

599
01:21:26,985 --> 01:21:29,317
Welcome to Amish country.

600
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:33,690
This is the most famous Amish
grocery store in the area.

601
01:21:34,392 --> 01:21:38,954
Now, stay close together, because we're only
going to be here another 15 minutes.

602
01:21:39,063 --> 01:21:42,226
Now, be careful with photographing
the Amish, they don't like it...

603
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:44,824
but you can sneak one now and then.

604
01:21:45,036 --> 01:21:46,833
All right, stay together.

605
01:21:47,839 --> 01:21:49,101
Young man!

606
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:52,699
Hello, we're just here for the day,
would you mind if I took your picture?

607
01:21:52,811 --> 01:21:54,938
Now just stand still. Fix your hat a little...

608
01:21:55,046 --> 01:21:58,015
Lady, you take my picture,
I'm going to rip your brassiere off...

609
01:21:58,116 --> 01:22:00,414
and strangle you with it.

610
01:22:00,718 --> 01:22:01,810
You got that?

611
01:22:04,889 --> 01:22:07,858
Did you hear
what that Amish just said to me?

612
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:11,561
- <i>Homicide. </i>
- Elton Carter.

613
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,832
- <i>Who's calling?</i>
- A friend.

614
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:20,896
<i>Yeah, Salazar, Public Relations. </i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

615
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:24,772
Yeah, I'm trying to reach Sgt. Elton Carter.

616
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,478
<i>Are you a member of the family?</i>

617
01:22:27,645 --> 01:22:29,772
What? No, I'm a friend.

618
01:22:30,982 --> 01:22:34,247
<i>Then I regret to inform you</i>
<i>Sgt. Carter is dead. </i>

619
01:22:34,352 --> 01:22:37,788
- What?
- <i>He died last night, killed in the line of duty. </i>

620
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:40,282
<i>Should you require other</i>...

621
01:23:04,682 --> 01:23:07,378
Hello. Yes.

622
01:23:08,386 --> 01:23:09,717
Paul!

623
01:23:13,858 --> 01:23:15,382
It's John Book.

624
01:23:16,561 --> 01:23:18,552
I'll take it in the study.

625
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:23,658
How are you, John?

626
01:23:32,343 --> 01:23:33,708
Hello, John.

627
01:23:37,849 --> 01:23:42,218
Calling me at home, I can't trace the call.
That's smart, John, very smart.

628
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,988
- Lost the meaning, didn't you, Paul?
- What?

629
01:23:45,456 --> 01:23:48,687
<i>Isn't that what you used to say</i>
<i>about dirty cops?</i>

630
01:23:49,627 --> 01:23:52,118
<i>Somewhere along the way,</i>
<i>they lost the meaning. </i>

631
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:56,098
Don't make it difficult, John.
We know where you are.

632
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,725
- We're about to...
- No, you got it wrong, man.

633
01:23:58,903 --> 01:24:02,270
- I'm coming to get you.
- I like your style, John.

634
01:24:02,807 --> 01:24:04,672
I've always liked your style.

635
01:24:04,809 --> 01:24:07,300
I'm going to do to you
whatever you did to Zenovich...

636
01:24:07,412 --> 01:24:08,970
and whatever you did to Carter.

637
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,208
I'm going to fucking do that to you, too,
you asshole.

638
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:30,592
Come on, you wrecked the fucking road.

639
01:24:30,702 --> 01:24:33,034
- I can't take this up.
- Yeah.

640
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:35,036
- Just give it a shot.
- Look.

641
01:24:35,173 --> 01:24:38,074
- No look. You look.
- It takes half hour to take back.

642
01:24:45,316 --> 01:24:48,581
It happens sometimes. Do nothing.

643
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,649
I asked you to move this horse.

644
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:52,623
Come on!

645
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:54,356
Come on, Goldilocks.

646
01:24:56,027 --> 01:24:59,724
- Don't you speak English?
- You don't hear very good, do you?

647
01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:10,840
- And the chin.
- You look better, buddy.

648
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:16,473
- Come on down, Jack.
- They are not allowed to fight.

649
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:17,570
You a man or what?

650
01:25:17,682 --> 01:25:21,413
That's right, no fighting.
They won't fight for their country either.

651
01:25:21,519 --> 01:25:24,818
- It's not our way.
- But it's my way.

652
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:27,219
Book, no!

653
01:25:27,325 --> 01:25:30,488
- How does it look?
- It looks great, give it to me.

654
01:25:33,164 --> 01:25:36,861
Here comes another one, look at this.

655
01:25:38,302 --> 01:25:40,099
It's all right, Book.

656
01:25:40,505 --> 01:25:43,531
Watch it, Frankie,
he's gonna hit you with his Bible.

657
01:25:48,312 --> 01:25:50,280
You're making a mistake.

658
01:26:06,898 --> 01:26:07,865
Book.

659
01:26:11,335 --> 01:26:13,803
Somebody give me a handkerchief,
he's bleeding.

660
01:26:28,786 --> 01:26:31,550
I've never seen anything like it
in all my years.

661
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:33,748
He is from Ohio, my cousin.

662
01:26:34,258 --> 01:26:37,455
Well, then, them Ohio Amish
must be different.

663
01:26:37,895 --> 01:26:41,524
Round here, the brethren don't have
anything like that kind of fight in them.

664
01:26:42,433 --> 01:26:44,060
Good day to you, Mr. Lapp.

665
01:26:44,168 --> 01:26:46,602
This ain't good for the tourist trade,
you know.

666
01:26:46,704 --> 01:26:48,899
Tell that to your Ohio friend.

667
01:26:51,175 --> 01:26:52,870
Broke his nose.

668
01:26:52,977 --> 01:26:55,138
He was with old Eli Lapp.

669
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:10,157
Where did you get that?

670
01:27:10,495 --> 01:27:12,190
Book gave it to me.

671
01:27:14,632 --> 01:27:17,032
He said it was a special present.

672
01:27:36,587 --> 01:27:39,613
Samuel, time for bed.

673
01:27:45,029 --> 01:27:47,224
You can take the toy with you.

674
01:28:09,821 --> 01:28:11,686
He's leaving, isn't he?

675
01:28:12,957 --> 01:28:14,549
Tomorrow morning.

676
01:28:16,194 --> 01:28:19,220
- He'll need his city clothes.
- But why?

677
01:28:20,331 --> 01:28:22,595
What's he going back to? Nothing?

678
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,568
He's going back to his world,
where he belongs.

679
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:28,905
He knows it...

680
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:32,604
and you know it, too.

681
01:32:48,299 --> 01:32:50,893
It's all right, we're police officers.

682
01:32:51,469 --> 01:32:53,562
Check the rest of the house.

683
01:32:54,572 --> 01:32:57,006
It's all right, we're police officers.

684
01:32:58,075 --> 01:33:01,567
Philadelphia Police. It's all right, Mrs. Lapp.

685
01:33:03,314 --> 01:33:06,147
Why don't you sit down.
It's going to be all right.

686
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:09,945
We're not going to harm your boy.
It's Book we want.

687
01:33:11,856 --> 01:33:13,414
Now, where is he?

688
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,737
Book!

689
01:33:32,143 --> 01:33:33,940
Fergie! Come on!

690
01:33:34,945 --> 01:33:36,412
Come on, damn it.

691
01:33:49,059 --> 01:33:51,323
What is it? What are they doing?

692
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:09,177
Listen, Samuel,
I want you to go to Hochleitner's farm...

693
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,748
as fast as you can and stay there.
You understand me?

694
01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:13,976
- Are they going to kill you?
- I'll be all right.

695
01:34:14,084 --> 01:34:16,177
But you don't have your gun.

696
01:34:17,621 --> 01:34:19,782
Run, Samuel. Run!

697
01:34:41,512 --> 01:34:42,774
Shit!

698
01:35:03,067 --> 01:35:04,625
Come on!

699
01:35:35,599 --> 01:35:36,896
Samuel!

700
01:39:23,093 --> 01:39:24,060
Fergie?

701
01:39:32,035 --> 01:39:33,002
Fuck!

702
01:39:41,078 --> 01:39:42,204
McFee!

703
01:39:56,026 --> 01:39:57,152
Fergie!

704
01:40:15,178 --> 01:40:16,406
What's wrong?

705
01:40:16,547 --> 01:40:19,209
- I can't figure it out.
- Where's Fergie?

706
01:40:19,349 --> 01:40:21,943
I don't know, you'd better come on up.

707
01:40:46,243 --> 01:40:48,404
Come on, we're going outside.

708
01:41:56,847 --> 01:41:58,109
Schaeffer!

709
01:42:28,245 --> 01:42:30,509
Stop the boy ringing that bell.

710
01:42:31,448 --> 01:42:34,144
I want you to stop the boy ringing that bell.
Stop him now!

711
01:42:34,251 --> 01:42:35,946
Get out of here now!

712
01:42:45,062 --> 01:42:46,029
Let her go, Paul!

713
01:42:46,129 --> 01:42:48,620
- Put the gun down, Book!
- Let her go, Schaeffer!

714
01:42:48,732 --> 01:42:50,632
- I'll blow you away.
- Put that gun down.

715
01:42:51,201 --> 01:42:53,101
I'm gonna blow her head off!

716
01:42:53,203 --> 01:42:54,898
It's down, the fucking gun is down!

717
01:42:55,005 --> 01:42:58,338
- You really fucked up now, you idiot!
- Let her go.

718
01:42:58,442 --> 01:43:00,069
Let her go, Paul. The gun's down!

719
01:43:00,177 --> 01:43:03,408
- Book, put that gun down!
- The gun's down!

720
01:43:03,747 --> 01:43:06,648
It's down. Don't hurt her.

721
01:43:41,418 --> 01:43:44,581
It's all right, Rachel.

722
01:43:44,888 --> 01:43:46,913
Rachel, just go. Go.

723
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:59,927
It's all right! I'm a police officer!

724
01:44:00,103 --> 01:44:02,196
The man's wanted for murder.

725
01:44:02,405 --> 01:44:04,771
- Now stand back!
- What are you going to do, Paul?

726
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:06,866
You going to kill me?
You going to shoot me?

727
01:44:06,977 --> 01:44:09,172
- You going to shoot him?
- Stand back!

728
01:44:09,312 --> 01:44:12,179
You going to shoot him?
Is that what you're going to do, Paul?

729
01:44:12,282 --> 01:44:13,977
Him, the woman, me?

730
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,954
It's over! Enough!

731
01:46:19,376 --> 01:46:21,105
Goodbye, John Book.

732
01:46:25,448 --> 01:46:26,915
Goodbye, Samuel.

733
01:48:20,163 --> 01:48:22,358
You be careful out among them English.
