1
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,866
<i>It was a day like no other.</i>

2
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,248
<i>It was a day I had always dreamed of.</i>

3
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:44,333
<i>A day I would never forget.</i>

4
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:50,506
Will you marry this woman
and take her to your heart,

5
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,426
forever devoted and forever young?

6
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:55,177
I will.

7
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:59,849
And will you marry this man
and take him to your heart,

8
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:02,435
forever devoted and forever young?

9
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:04,478
I will.

10
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:07,690
Would you now place the ring on her finger?

11
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:12,570
I now declare...

12
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:18,868
<i>What a shame we had uninvited guests.</i>

13
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:24,832
I'll have what I came for this day!

14
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,212
<i>Jack politely asked him to leave.</i>

15
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,421
Kiss steel, bastard!

16
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,394
Jack!

17
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,539
Hold tight! I'm coming!

18
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:12,546
<i>His temper flared,
but he fought like a gentleman.</i>

19
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:40,407
<i>My one true love had fought bravely,
but it wasn't enough.</i>

20
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:54,378
<i>There was only room for one more.</i>

21
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:57,047
<i>It was either my love or myself.</i>

22
00:02:57,131 --> 00:03:01,510
- You take it, my love.
- Never! Those maggots will not have you.

23
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:04,305
They will not have me for long.

24
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:07,682
I have consumption
and will be dead before the year is out.

25
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:11,896
You were gonna marry me
with consumption? Why didn't you tell me?

26
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,148
I didn't want to spoil things.

27
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,524
- Go.
- No!

28
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,902
Live to fight another day.

29
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,866
Whatever makes you happy.

30
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:32,874
<i>With Jack, my happiness always came first.</i>

31
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,544
<i>I faced my fate alone.</i>

32
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:39,756
<i>The 10 turned to 20, the 20 to 40.</i>

33
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,051
<i>Could this be the end of
my freedom, my salvation, my...</i>

34
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:45,845
Hey, gorgeous!

35
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,932
Hiya, Joanie!

36
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:04,739
What happened?

37
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:40,023
"Was this the end of my freedom,
my salvation?"

38
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:44,570
My career?

39
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:59,768
Gorgeous day. Huh, gorgeous?

40
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:02,271
We got blue skies,

41
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:05,691
nice warm water and a cold beer.

42
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,696
Honey, did you get any more Buds?

43
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,742
No, I just didn't have time today
to ravage the Riviera for your beer.

44
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,038
- Tough day, huh?
- Yeah, you could say it was tough.

45
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,750
But then when the going gets tough,
the tough...

46
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:28,171
I don't know what the tough do.

47
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,341
I don't know what the pirates do,
or what anybody does.

48
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,928
- Jack...
- Oh, honey. I know, baby. I know.

49
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:40,975
Look out there. What do you see?

50
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,937
- Bloomingdale's?
- No.

51
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,480
Greece.

52
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:49,234
Yeah. Mykonos, Lesbos, ouzo, olive oil.
Honey, we're going.

53
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:53,405
Wait. I thought you said that
we were going back to New York for a while.

54
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:56,449
Absolutely.
When the summer's over we're going.

55
00:06:56,533 --> 00:07:00,828
Oh, Jack, we've been on this boat
half a year now. I need shore leave.

56
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:04,498
I promised Gloria I'd finish that book
three months ago, and I can't.

57
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,667
I don't know what happens next.

58
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,545
I thought you wanted
to sail around the world with me.

59
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:12,840
Well, I do, but not all of it this week.

60
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,051
I mean, Jack, this is just becoming a blur.

61
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,890
Exotic ports and great parties
and spectacular sunsets...

62
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,640
It's not enough.

63
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,976
It's not enough?!

64
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:29,398
You sound like someone who's got what they
wanted and now don't want what they got.

65
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:32,985
- I wanna do something serious.
- Serious? Come on!

66
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,487
How much romance can one woman take?

67
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,865
Joan Wilder?

68
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,995
From your most devoted friend.

69
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,788
Thank you.

70
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:56,341
"This afternoon we shall meet... awaiting
the moment." What's this afternoon?

71
00:07:56,424 --> 00:08:01,262
- Must be somebody coming to the reception.
- That's not till next Tuesday.

72
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:05,350
This is "next Tuesday", Jack.

73
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:26,621
- Jack, you said you were getting a car.
- If I knew it was Tuesday, I would've. Sorry.

74
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:28,790
That's all right.

75
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:32,210
Whaddaya say we spin that roulette wheel
while we're there?

76
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,378
Sounds great.

77
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:45,389
Jack.

78
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:47,349
- Yeah?
- She can't leave now.

79
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:50,227
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "Why not?"

80
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,815
- Oh, my God.
- I'm your biggest fan!

81
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,233
- I read all your books.
- Thank you.

82
00:08:56,316 --> 00:09:00,571
I'm so happy to see you.

83
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:03,907
- This is my publisher. Gloria Horne.
- Oh, your publisher.

84
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:07,411
- And this is...
- You are Mr Wilder?

85
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,831
No, I'm Mr Colton. Jack Colton.

86
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:13,250
What do you do, Mr Colton?

87
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,419
Casino work.

88
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:20,089
Yeah. I think I'll go downstairs and punch in.
Excuse me, excuse me.

89
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:22,675
- But...
- I'll be back!

90
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:26,429
God, I've got to have a drink!

91
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,973
Literary functions are not Jack's speed.

92
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:32,978
I mean, his favourite author
is the man who wrote "Pull Tab to Open".

93
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,982
- I am his favourite author.
- You saying it's none of my business?

94
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:40,110
Let me tell you, Jack is not the marrying kind.

95
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:44,238
I am worried. You're the girl who
never gets a book back late to the library.

96
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:49,493
<i>You are three months past your deadline.
What gives? Un scotch, double.</i>

97
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:54,498
My heart just isn't in it. Romance
just doesn't seem real to me any more.

98
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:59,128
Real? You don't write "real". You write
about people that sail off into the sunset.

99
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:03,925
- And the next day when the sun comes up?
- There is no next day in romance.

100
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:07,344
Stop confusing real life
with a romantic novel.

101
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:11,306
- Joanie, just finish it.
- I can't.

102
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,434
After 17 books,
I don't know how it ends any more.

103
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:17,563
Then permit me to tell you.

104
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:22,944
It doesn't end.

105
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:26,864
It only begins anew
when you journey down the Nile with me.

106
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,076
- Have you got the right woman?
- No.

107
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:37,415
My name is Omar Khalifa and I have travelled
1,000 miles to tell you I need you.

108
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:40,335
- You sent me the flowers.
- They pale by your beauty.

109
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:42,087
Oh, Mary!

110
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,383
<i>- I read about you.
- Yes, I know. Time magazine.</i>

111
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:51,054
Well, I'm afraid the Western press
cannot understand the spirit of my vision.

112
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:54,056
You are a writer. You can understand.

113
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:58,562
So, Joan Wilder,
you must come and write my story.

114
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:02,065
I only write romance novels.

115
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:06,152
Yes. And you haven't finished the one
you're working on right now.

116
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:11,324
You are a gifted storyteller.
You create heroes in a world of cynics.

117
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:15,453
Journey down the Nile with me
and I'll give you a chance to record history.

118
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:18,080
- Come. We must leave today.
- Joanie!

119
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:23,752
In just four nights I will become Emperor,
and you will have the exclusive story.

120
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:26,672
- They have emperors on the Nile?
- They do now.

121
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,633
Oh, shit.

122
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:51,530
So now what are we celebrating?

123
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:54,116
- The Nile!
- Oh, the Nile.

124
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:56,202
We've been invited to Africa.

125
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:59,205
Jack Colton, Omar Khalifa.

126
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:02,249
How do you do?

127
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:08,504
He's asked me - me - to write his story.
It's just what I've always wanted to do!

128
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:12,926
And now Joan's work will receive
the serious attention that it deserves.

129
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:16,054
And this will be her biggest accomplishment:

130
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,223
My biography.

131
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,394
What's so important there
that you have to write the book now?

132
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:24,980
- Mr Khalifa has...
- Omar, please.

133
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:29,817
Omar has been chosen
to unite the tribes of the Nile

134
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:32,987
and end the strife that has bloodied his land.

135
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:36,241
He will carry on the work of
the missing Great Redeemer.

136
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:40,203
- You have listened very well.
- You got all that in 20 minutes?

137
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:46,125
As a friend of Miss Wilder's,
you are welcome to be my guest also.

138
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,753
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

139
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,549
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

140
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,348
I thought you wanted to go to New York.

141
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,725
- That's all changed.
- That fast?

142
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:08,106
But to write a biography -
it's something important, something real.

143
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:12,360
- This is what I've been looking for.
- Isn't it a little bit over your head?

144
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,945
I think it's a great chance.

145
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,114
So you got your heart set on it?

146
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:24,454
Mine's set on Greece.

147
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,044
So when are you gonna leave?

148
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,965
Tonight. He has a private jet and...

149
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,341
Oh, he's got a private jet.

150
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:42,972
- Oh, what the hell. We had a good run.
- Oh, Jack, come on.

151
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,850
This is just five or four weeks of research.

152
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,729
Maybe you're right. Maybe we need a break.

153
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:51,231
It's been kind of tough lately.

154
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:54,860
Yeah. When the going gets tough,
the tough go to Greece.

155
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:02,116
- Well, I'll write you.
- Where?

156
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,661
Yeah.

157
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,622
Where?

158
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,387
I think I'll go down and
give that roulette wheel one more chance.

159
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:36,484
You take care of yourself.

160
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:41,072
And you stay out of trouble.

161
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:53,708
Look out for her, will ya?

162
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:58,004
I can offer you this comfort:
She leaves you for a higher purpose.

163
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,176
Yeah.

164
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:20,527
<i>Free Al-Jawhara!</i>

165
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,477
Don't be frightened. You know,
a man of vision has many enemies.

166
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:58,522
And my destiny is to outsmart them.
You see?

167
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:01,567
Like it?

168
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:04,361
It's OK.

169
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:49,906
Well, sweetheart, I guess it's just you and me.

170
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,784
Goddamn it, she was the best time I ever had.

171
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,995
Don't cry, scumbag! I'll keep you company.

172
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,877
Cartagena, Colombia!
Long time no... Oh, shit.

173
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:06,965
- Go ahead. Gimme a reason. Make my year!
- Hey, go easy with the gun.

174
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:11,718
Did you miss me? I missed you.
You're all I thought about for six months.

175
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:16,765
They threw me in a jail filled with rejects
from the communicable disease ward.

176
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:21,771
Every wacko, drippy,
open-sored lowlife was in that joint!

177
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:24,315
All wanting to be my proctologist.

178
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:27,819
And rats! I'm full of rat bites.

179
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:33,991
Ten weeks of rabies shots this long and
all I thought of was you, Colton. Just you!

180
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:38,662
Well, I'm flattered, pal.
And I'm sorry you had such a tough time.

181
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:41,999
How about 100 bucks?

182
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:46,003
I'll give you a one-way ticket to Harp Land!
What'd you do with it?

183
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:49,381
- What are you talking about?
- The stone, moron! I'm cocked!

184
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:54,260
- Let's talk about this like gentlemen.
- Gentlemen! Did I tell you I got malaria?

185
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:58,806
Every time I shake, I shake like this. Know
what happens if I shake my trigger finger?

186
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,936
And I feel an attack coming on!
Know what happens if that happens?

187
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,856
It's the end of Mr Lucky. That's the end of...

188
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,692
Holy shit!

189
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:13,030
Quiet! Next time you'll not be so lucky.

190
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:17,075
- I am Tarak. You must come with me now.
- What the hell are you?

191
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,953
<i>- Omar steal our jewel. Al-Jawhara.
- Jewel?</i>

192
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:25,583
You were invited with the woman. You can
get into Omar's palace. My people cannot.

193
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:30,463
- What people? What are you talking about?
- You must help me find the Jewel.

194
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,924
- What jewel?
- The Jewel of the Nile.

195
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:35,509
- Our most priceless jewel.
- Oh, that jewel.

196
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:39,347
Omar has stolen my people's jewel.
Omar is a very bad man.

197
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,515
Oh, that scum! I spit on him!

198
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:45,228
Jack, buddy, let's help this nice man
get his jewel back.

199
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:48,898
- Yes.
- Look, I don't know where you're from,

200
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:51,067
but I'm sailing my boat tonight.

201
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,613
No, you must come to help find the Jewel
now before Omar kill many people.

202
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:59,700
As long as Omar have the Jewel,
nothing can stop him.

203
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:03,829
Look, I'm going on the boat.
You guys can do what you want.

204
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:11,253
The boat blew up!

205
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,507
My boat blew up.

206
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,634
The boat blew up!

207
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,803
Everything's gone.

208
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:25,517
Who are you? The Prince of Darkness?
Don't you got any friends?

209
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:27,769
This is the work of Omar.

210
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:33,066
- Omar blew up my boat, huh?
- Your woman is in danger, too.

211
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:35,151
I will take you to him.

212
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:37,737
- I'm coming, too.
- The hell you are!

213
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:41,324
Look, you owe me, Colton.

214
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:44,119
So wherever you're going, I'm going.

215
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:47,706
Where we going?

216
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,332
Africa.

217
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:23,157
- Do you recognise my home?
- I wrote this!

218
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,495
<i>Yes! In The Return of the King.
I had the same uniforms designed.</i>

219
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,384
Hello. Hi!

220
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:49,849
- Is all this yours?
- It belongs to the country. To my people.

221
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,810
Oh.

222
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,984
Why point out the negative?

223
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:02,111
In three nights in Kadir
the moon will be full,

224
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:07,700
and all my people will unite behind me
in peace and none of this will be necessary.

225
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:12,247
- Now let me show you my humble house.
- Thank you.

226
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,838
I'm really blessed. My people love me.

227
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:24,591
Well, yes. They seem very... enthusiastic.

228
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,812
Oh, this is a good shot for you -
the little boy holding up my picture.

229
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,981
Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.

230
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,753
My humble house.

231
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,464
You must forgive us. We are a poor people.

232
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,019
Everything you need, they will bring you.

233
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,562
Oh, thank you.

234
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:22,649
Here only strangers say thank you.
Family and friends have no need.

235
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,612
What was that?

236
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,780
Cats. Come.

237
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,784
I have a cat.

238
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:42,460
I hope this is satisfactory.

239
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:47,298
Oh, yes, this is OK. Fine.

240
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:49,926
Here you'll write your masterpiece.

241
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,220
Ah, I have a few questions...

242
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:55,806
I see the writer is already at work. Good.

243
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:59,310
Explore your new world.

244
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:02,813
Feel free to go anywhere and see anything.

245
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:05,233
Talk to anyone.

246
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:09,570
I'm glad you're here, Joan.
Together we'll make history.

247
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:09,170
It's like a fishbowl!

248
00:24:09,253 --> 00:24:13,841
Why do these Third World cesspools
always gotta be so hot, will you tell me that?

249
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:18,179
Hey, where the hell you going?

250
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:25,729
Holy shit!

251
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:47,416
Well, Colton, looks like
we've hitched our wagon to a star.

252
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:18,447
Stop that! Stop it!

253
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:29,207
Excuse me?

254
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,752
What does this mean?

255
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,093
- Do you speak English?
- "Give back the Jewel."

256
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:44,179
<i>- Give back the jewel?
- Yeah. Eid lana Al-Jawhara.</i>

257
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,563
You can't do that! I'm a professional.

258
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,490
We'll see about that.

259
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:07,786
<i>If you don't tell me
what the hell is going on here,</i>

260
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,082
- I'll be on the first plane back to New York.
- It's impossible.

261
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:17,754
Tomorrow we journey to Kadir. You must be
there. It will be your most important chapter.

262
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:21,884
- I can't write if you keep secrets from me.
- What secrets?

263
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,805
What is the Jewel?

264
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:31,435
The Jewel is a legend.

265
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:33,604
I am real.

266
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:37,608
Do not be distracted
from your mission, Joan Wilder.

267
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,402
Make yourself comfortable.

268
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:43,906
You stay with me until our book is done.

269
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:46,074
You can't keep me here!

270
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:50,913
Go. You are free to leave.

271
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:58,252
Only the worst kind of fool
would attempt our desert alone.

272
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:12,851
I gotta get off this camel.
It's breaking my ass! Colton!

273
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,520
- You gotta hang on and take it.
- I can't.

274
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:19,065
- The camp's coming up.
- Shit!

275
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:36,457
You are welcome!

276
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:40,710
We have food! We have drink!

277
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:42,879
You got a toilet?

278
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,053
So how big is this jewel?

279
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:58,855
Very, very big. Very big. Very, very big.

280
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:00,106
Very big.

281
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,984
It's as big as this orange?

282
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:15,620
- It's as big as an orange.
- The Jewel is the heart of our people.

283
00:28:15,787 --> 00:28:18,206
Omar steals the heart of our people.

284
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,584
- Omar is thief.
- Omar is very bad man.

285
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,920
Before Omar steal Jewel, everything good.

286
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,921
Now everything is shit!

287
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:39,311
You help us find the Jewel,
and we give you great reward.

288
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:42,731
But if you lie to us, you die.

289
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,443
But now we dance!

290
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:23,521
Look at these guys, Colton.

291
00:29:23,604 --> 00:29:25,689
No sheep is safe tonight.

292
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:40,954
We split it right down the middle,
Colton. 50-50.

293
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:43,122
What are you talking about?

294
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:45,750
Don't play stupid with me, partner.

295
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:47,710
The Jewel.

296
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:50,588
And don't you even think of
messing with me.

297
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,180
Oh, what's that I hear?
A heart breaking? You sap!

298
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:02,141
Keep your mind on business.

299
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:06,813
You'll wind up getting yourself killed
over some broad who dumped you.

300
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,358
Jewels!

301
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,777
Oh, Omar!

302
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:44,017
I want you lot to be careful!

303
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:49,897
See that word "Fragile" on the side?
It means don't drop... Why don't you listen?

304
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,735
I might love your country, your culture,
and even your people! That means I love you!

305
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:58,614
But you drop one more of my boxes,
and I'll smash your bloody face in!

306
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:06,079
You tell Omar, right - Omar -
that his special-effects wizard has arrived!

307
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,248
Come on, then.

308
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:37,377
War plans? Oh, my God! What is he up to?

309
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:45,676
<i>Wait till Time magazine sees this.</i>

310
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,661
You bastard! You burnt my hand!

311
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:17,708
I didn't say it wouldn't burn.
I said it wouldn't hurt! There's no blistering.

312
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:22,296
- I've done it hundreds of times on stage.
- This is not a cheap theatrical stunt!

313
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:27,676
- It's a miracle! My people have to believe it!
- Omar, trust me. Trust what I've got to say.

314
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,722
Look, if I can make gods out of rock'n'roll
stars, imagine what I can do for you.

315
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:36,769
For your information,
I am not a rock'n'roll star!

316
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:40,147
The people must believe
I have the same powers as the Jewel.

317
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:42,566
Come! I want to see him now.

318
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,862
If it weren't for the Jewel,
I'd have led my people to power long ago.

319
00:33:56,246 --> 00:34:01,292
Westerners understand nothing. The Jewel
represents the spiritual world of my people.

320
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:05,964
Unless I convince them I am their spiritual
leader, they will never follow me into battle.

321
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:08,132
That is why you are here.

322
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:37,203
- Tell me how it's done, magician.
- It's not magic trick. It's miracle.

323
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,873
I am losing patience with you.

324
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:44,918
But you cannot kill me.
Even you are superstitious.

325
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,671
<i>Al-Jawhara lives.</i>

326
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,841
Two nights from now it will not matter.

327
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,442
Oh, no.

328
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,781
A woman?

329
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:18,076
- Most unexpected.
- I gotta get outta here.

330
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,245
I gotta stop Omar.

331
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:23,290
Did you bring an army?

332
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:27,585
<i>- No. I'm just Joan Wilder.
- Just-Joan Wilder, I'm Al-Jawhara.</i>

333
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,840
The Jewel of the Nile.

334
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,510
I don't understand.

335
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,971
- You are the Jewel?!
- Yes. For the moment.

336
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:43,977
In two nights at the holy city of Kadir
Omar will proclaim himself Emperor.

337
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:48,106
Without me to oppose him, he'll march
across North Africa like a madman.

338
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,568
But the world will see me
as the saviour of my people.

339
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:57,532
No, it won't. The world won't believe you.
I've been in your office and seen your vision.

340
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,992
- I'll write the truth about you.
- The truth?

341
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:03,371
<i>If I wanted the truth,
I would have hired 60 Minutes.</i>

342
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:06,499
What do you know about truth?
You fantasise everything.

343
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:12,004
<i>Why do you think I brought you here? You
stay here and write what I tell you to write!</i>

344
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:17,801
- You think no one knows I'm here?
- Oh, yes, Jack! I forgot to tell you.

345
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,595
Jack is dead.

346
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:25,393
Don't be ridiculous.
Jack would never die without telling me.

347
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,812
Nevertheless, he is dead.

348
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:39,406
You look pale, Miss Wilder.
I'll send you my personal physician.

349
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,206
It can't be true.

350
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,340
This Jack... He is friend for you?

351
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,593
Yes.

352
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,761
He is my best friend.

353
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,195
What? I don't see shit!

354
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,364
We must stop here.

355
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,492
It is dangerous for Sufis to enter Omar's city.

356
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,786
Now, wait. He's already tried to kill me once.

357
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:32,249
You are guest of Omar.

358
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,961
Find for us the Jewel. Accept your destiny.

359
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,299
Destiny, my ass! Excuse me.

360
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,220
When you hook up with jujubes,
see what happens.

361
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,265
Just take your lead from me, and we'll be fine.

362
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:53,187
- We gonna walk through the centre of town?
- I'm gonna put you up a camel's ass.

363
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,939
I might like it.

364
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,155
- What are you doing?
- In one of my books,

365
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,324
<i>Angelina's Savage Secret,</i>

366
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:10,079
she used her nailfile to cut
the mortar away from the window box.

367
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,747
How long did this take?

368
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:14,791
Two pages.

369
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:19,504
But... it's not the bars
that make the prison. It is the desert.

370
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:23,424
So I'll travel at night. I don't care.
I have to stop Omar.

371
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:26,261
I gotta get out to write the truth about him.

372
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:28,429
I have to get to Kadir.

373
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:32,434
Wait a minute.
You are the one that has to get to Kadir.

374
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,854
You are the only one that can stop Omar.
You have to go with me!

375
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:40,900
Maybe you are the one.

376
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:44,445
I accept.

377
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:46,906
We are sworn, Just-Joan.

378
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,245
- Right. But it's just Joan.
- Right. Just-Joan.

379
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:55,999
- Right. We just have to get out this window.
- Please.

380
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:04,173
- Magic!
- Dry rot.

381
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:12,265
I bet you could pick up a swell three-bedroom
town house here for about five or six dollars.

382
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:16,978
Hi. My name is Colton.

383
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:20,773
I've been invited by your Omar.
I'm here to see Joan Wilder.

384
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:26,111
Hey, Rachid! How are you?
Good to see you again.

385
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,405
Joan Wilder does not want to see you.

386
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:35,913
Well, now, Rachid,
I don't think you understand.

387
00:39:37,498 --> 00:39:42,002
We're here on official business.
This is Mr... Fatush from the US Embassy.

388
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:46,214
He's got something very important
to talk to all you guys about.

389
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:53,930
Look, we don't want to
create an international incident here.

390
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:57,142
I mean, after all, she is an American citizen.

391
00:39:57,226 --> 00:40:01,396
If you'll just let us see her, no paperwork.
Mum's the word. Everything...

392
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:07,444
Guys, no sweat, OK?
We'll catch you next time we're in town.

393
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:09,862
- Take it easy.
- Say hello to her for us.

394
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:13,699
You know what they say: Once
they've had a holy man, they never go back.

395
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:18,496
- Quickly, Just-Joan!
- Are you sure you know where you're going?

396
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:26,796
Those guys can go for hours
without coming up for air.

397
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:30,967
Ease up, will ya?
All right, there's gotta be another way in here.

398
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:36,889
I can't wait for another smooth move. How
about us at the back door in pussycat suits?

399
00:40:36,973 --> 00:40:40,852
- When they come with the milk...
- How about you takin' it in the ear!?

400
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:44,147
Look, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't be on to this.

401
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:47,275
Subsequently I should shoot you
the first chance I get!

402
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:48,901
Jack!

403
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:51,404
You're alive!

404
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:53,656
Kinda goin' outta your way to duck me!

405
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:56,116
You bastard!

406
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:07,586
Oh, Jack! I thought I'd never see you again.

407
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:11,631
They told me you were dead.
I never wanna feel that way again.

408
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,885
Does this mean you apologise?

409
00:41:14,968 --> 00:41:19,139
<i>I feel like I'm back in eighth grade.
Is this The Young and the Stupid?</i>

410
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:23,602
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Don't get cagey with me. I'm on to it.

411
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:25,770
I know how you two operate.

412
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,318
I'll get in there with or without you dinks!

413
00:41:40,118 --> 00:41:45,206
Hey, look, guys! Lighten up!
I'm only saying hello to an old girlfriend here!

414
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:49,043
- Just-Joan, we need to go!
- Wait a minute, who's this guy?

415
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:52,463
- He's a friend.
- You made friends in there?

416
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:11,732
- OK. Let's go, come on!
- Wait. He's coming with us.

417
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,695
Don't start with me! I've come
halfway across Africa to rescue you.

418
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:19,573
Rescue me? I was doing fine without you.

419
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:24,703
- I am guide. I can help.
- I don't need a guide. I need a miracle!

420
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:26,872
Jack, he's coming with us.

421
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:34,963
All right. But if we get out of this alive,
I'm gonna kill you.

422
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:36,506
Let's go.

423
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:13,877
- Who are you?
- Is this where Al Jolson's buried?

424
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,712
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't provoke me, pal!

425
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:21,383
<i>I had a tough day. You know
how hot it is here? It's 120º in the shade.</i>

426
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,890
I'm like this with Weinberger.
We'll be all over you!

427
00:43:34,856 --> 00:43:36,733
Let me in!

428
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,944
Holy shit and shove me in it.

429
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,395
Oh, no. Over the wall!

430
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:51,639
Excuse me. Excuse me.

431
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,395
Come on!

432
00:44:57,478 --> 00:44:59,147
No! No!

433
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:06,863
OK, flyboy,
your estimated time of departure is now!

434
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,550
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything!

435
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:33,181
- Well, do something!
- All right. I'm trying!

436
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:38,727
I mean, this isn't Space Invaders!

437
00:45:44,816 --> 00:45:47,736
- Jack, the wall!
- Oh, no!

438
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,321
- It is Space Invaders!
- That'll show 'em!

439
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:43,999
All right, yeah!

440
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,460
Oh, shit!

441
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:51,714
Let's get outta here!

442
00:47:07,398 --> 00:47:09,482
This is gonna be tight!

443
00:47:14,404 --> 00:47:16,656
This is my first time in airplane.

444
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:31,671
How do you stop this thing?

445
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,887
Sorry!

446
00:47:48,146 --> 00:47:50,982
- Do you know where you're going?
- Give me a break!

447
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:38,695
- Your friend steal the Jewel.
- What?

448
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:46,452
- You! You are liar to me!
- No!

449
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:49,205
I come back and you're dead!

450
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,380
You thieving bastard!
You ain't stiffin' me again!

451
00:48:57,463 --> 00:49:00,842
I promise ya.
I'll feed ya to the maggots! I'll get...

452
00:50:00,442 --> 00:50:02,319
Great! We're out of quarters.

453
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:04,529
Well, try that one there.

454
00:50:10,118 --> 00:50:12,204
Now what?

455
00:50:12,662 --> 00:50:14,748
Damn it!

456
00:50:24,507 --> 00:50:26,258
Yes!

457
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:29,763
Hey, that's not bad for your first time.

458
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:06,256
Come on, we'll get him. We'll get him.

459
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:08,883
Colton, you ain't gettin' away.

460
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:31,906
Where the hell's the horn?

461
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:35,910
Get outta here! Get out of the way!

462
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:55,555
Sandstorm.

463
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:08,109
Stop!

464
00:52:08,485 --> 00:52:10,862
What are you gonna do?

465
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:14,990
Either save us or kill us. Hang on!

466
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:19,179
- Now you are dead.
- No! Don't cut off my head!

467
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:23,307
- You stole our jewel.
- It was the mook! He's always screwin' me.

468
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:26,352
I swear to God on my eyes
I never seen that jewel!

469
00:53:27,979 --> 00:53:30,606
No, wait, wait!

470
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,234
You need me. I can help you find him.

471
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:38,239
- You are his friend.
- No! No friend. Stop saying that.

472
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:40,658
Friends don't stab each other in the back.

473
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:45,371
Come on. Look, we'll team up.
We'll find him, we'll get him good.

474
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:49,749
He knows that I will not be denied!
Colton's future is bleak!

475
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,502
<i>Very bleak!</i>

476
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:57,340
Any idea where we are?

477
00:53:57,424 --> 00:54:02,388
The best I can figure out is that we head
due east. We should make it to the border.

478
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:08,060
<i>- Well... is that the way to Kadir?
- La. Kadir is in the west, over that mountain.</i>

479
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:11,730
Well, the best of luck to you, pal.
Joan, let's get going.

480
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:13,982
Jack, we have to take him to Kadir.

481
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:18,737
What are you talkin' about?
We got him out, like you said. Come on.

482
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,948
We swore an oath, Just-Joan and I.
We go to Kadir.

483
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,952
What is it with you?!

484
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:30,749
Jesus! Everything's always gotta be
your way? It's just like the goddamn boat!

485
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:35,252
What do you mean "my way"? It wasn't
my idea to spend six months on your boat!

486
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:39,799
- Oh, debate good. I enjoy.
- OK, let me tell you what I put up with.

487
00:54:40,174 --> 00:54:44,429
We're moored off the Canary Islands.
Midnight, sound asleep.

488
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:47,140
Three crazed Joan Wilder fans

489
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:50,685
<i>decide they want the anchor
of the Angelina for a souvenir!</i>

490
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:56,191
- We were drifting for days! And the other...
- Stop. I'm sorry. It's time for Just-Joan.

491
00:54:56,274 --> 00:54:59,443
- Remember the Costa del Sol, Jack?
- Oh, come on!

492
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:02,363
He's gotta meet me
at the governor's for dinner.

493
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:07,409
And you show up with the entire
national basketball team!

494
00:55:07,493 --> 00:55:09,370
They were hungry.

495
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:13,082
This is what I'm talking about.
Sometimes you could think about me.

496
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:17,419
Oh, I suppose you were thinking all about me
when you took off with Omar?

497
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,588
- He blew up my boat!
- Our boat?

498
00:55:19,672 --> 00:55:23,550
- Oh, now it's our boat?
- Good debate. It's equal, no winners.

499
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:26,929
- Just-Joan, we must hurry.
- Wait. He blew up our boat?

500
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:30,266
Why are you risking your life for this guy?

501
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,437
I made a commitment. I can't break it.

502
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:41,986
OK. Fine.

503
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:45,864
But I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I didn't come here for you anyway. No!

504
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:49,033
I'm on to something big.

505
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:54,664
<i>- A jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.
- Come with us. I am Jawhara!</i>

506
00:55:55,665 --> 00:55:58,960
- That means Joe.
- Thanks, Joe, but no thanks.

507
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:02,422
I wouldn't want her
to break her commitment.

508
00:56:03,131 --> 00:56:05,216
Oh, Jack...

509
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:07,718
Come on.

510
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:48,091
<i>That's for the Angelina.</i>

511
00:56:49,218 --> 00:56:51,304
I still owe you for Joan.

512
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:59,561
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Please, let me get out of this alive.

513
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:03,690
I swear to God
I'll be a good boy from tomorrow on.

514
00:57:09,196 --> 00:57:11,281
But tonight I gotta kill Colton.

515
00:57:25,086 --> 00:57:27,505
<i>Heydi Joan Wilder!</i>

516
00:57:41,602 --> 00:57:45,356
- Why you didn't tell your friend about me?
- Oh, I know him.

517
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:50,403
He'd go halfway round the world for a party.
He wouldn't cross town for a noble cause.

518
00:57:50,486 --> 00:57:54,448
- People can surprise you.
- No, he's just Jack. He'll never change.

519
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:56,617
Like a...

520
00:57:57,201 --> 00:57:59,328
Like a stone.

521
00:57:59,412 --> 00:58:03,166
It's always a stone. Open your hand.

522
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:07,669
Change is not always visible.

523
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:11,006
- Let's show some hustle!
- What?

524
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:15,051
Your buddy Omar!
What is it? He can't live without you?

525
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,726
- Are we jogging?
- We are jogging.

526
00:58:34,488 --> 00:58:36,990
Greece is looking better and better.

527
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,126
Oh, shit!

528
00:58:49,586 --> 00:58:52,505
Just tell me why this guy wants you so bad.

529
00:58:53,422 --> 00:58:55,883
- Hey, Joe, where you going?
- This way.

530
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:59,304
- You gotta be kidding.
- He knows the mountains better than you.

531
00:58:59,387 --> 00:59:01,473
Joan, will you give me a break?

532
00:59:01,556 --> 00:59:03,975
America - democracy. We vote, huh?

533
00:59:58,487 --> 01:00:00,573
Stop!

534
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:14,669
Hurry up. Let's go!

535
01:00:15,587 --> 01:00:16,838
Get down!

536
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:23,179
It's a black day for democracy.

537
01:00:24,596 --> 01:00:28,641
- Do not worry. It's not my destiny to die here.
- What about us?

538
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:32,437
That's another ball game.

539
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:43,615
Rachid!

540
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:49,828
Joan Wilder!

541
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,289
I wish no harm to you!

542
01:00:52,706 --> 01:00:55,292
I'm your friend! Your fan!

543
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:58,045
Please surrender!

544
01:00:58,128 --> 01:01:02,299
What did you do for this guy Omar
you never did for me?

545
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:04,468
Bloody bitch!

546
01:01:14,186 --> 01:01:16,271
Oh, shit! Look out!

547
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,639
Hey, Omar! Eat rocks!

548
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:54,059
Let's go.

549
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:24,921
I got something.

550
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:31,179
Nubians.

551
01:02:31,262 --> 01:02:33,598
I was hoping to avoid them.

552
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:42,732
Sell any books here?

553
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:49,738
- Main man! Hey, my man!
- What are you so happy about?

554
01:02:49,821 --> 01:02:54,075
<i>Just keep smiling. Maybe they'll think
we're from National Geographic.</i>

555
01:03:00,248 --> 01:03:02,334
Hey! How ya doin'?

556
01:03:33,572 --> 01:03:36,700
He says it's many days'
long trip over high mountains.

557
01:03:36,784 --> 01:03:39,411
And he wishes us a very pleasant journey.

558
01:03:41,497 --> 01:03:43,833
Thank you.

559
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:48,045
All right. Thank you, guys.
Catch you next time. Goodbye.

560
01:03:48,129 --> 01:03:50,214
Come on, Jack.

561
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:59,140
Ah, Mr Jack! Just-Joan! The Chief's son, he
wishes to make a blessing for your marriage.

562
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:03,727
We're not married.

563
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:29,669
He says, because you are not married,
that his son wishes to court you.

564
01:04:30,086 --> 01:04:32,589
- Oh, I just...
- Oh, no, that's...

565
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:37,928
That's very nice, but the lady is...
She's with me.

566
01:04:44,142 --> 01:04:49,439
He says that because there is more than
one suitor, that you must wrestle his son.

567
01:04:49,773 --> 01:04:51,858
I gotta wrestle his son?

568
01:04:56,946 --> 01:04:59,032
How ya doin'?

569
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,746
OK. This one I think I can handle.

570
01:05:05,412 --> 01:05:07,289
OK!

571
01:05:12,127 --> 01:05:13,378
No?

572
01:05:13,962 --> 01:05:16,048
<i>Hussein!</i>

573
01:05:35,984 --> 01:05:39,738
Wait a minute, guys.
Let's talk this over like gentlemen!

574
01:05:42,324 --> 01:05:44,785
All right. You guys are with me, huh?

575
01:05:44,868 --> 01:05:46,829
Yeah, me. All right.

576
01:05:46,912 --> 01:05:50,916
Do me a favour. Tell him
we lived together for six months. Shit.

577
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:53,334
All right, what are the rules?

578
01:06:17,817 --> 01:06:19,986
Right.

579
01:06:31,581 --> 01:06:33,583
I'm sorry about that.

580
01:06:36,335 --> 01:06:38,588
No, not the left one! No!

581
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:45,553
No pain, no gain.

582
01:06:45,636 --> 01:06:47,722
Let me go!

583
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,355
- No!
- Can we talk about this?

584
01:06:57,315 --> 01:06:59,400
Stop it!

585
01:06:59,901 --> 01:07:01,986
We have to do something!

586
01:07:02,694 --> 01:07:04,780
I am doing something.

587
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:28,011
Joe, he's...

588
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:35,910
- That was great!
- Great, huh? I could've gotten killed!

589
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:37,013
This is the marriage dance. In this tribe,
the women, they choose the man.

590
01:09:37,388 --> 01:09:41,810
And then, according to the custom,
they will be together for life.

591
01:09:41,893 --> 01:09:44,270
They get all that from one dance?

592
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:46,022
It's beautiful!

593
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:56,281
Ralph, if you want to be one of us,
take off your shoes and socks.

594
01:09:57,116 --> 01:10:00,869
If you want to be one of us,
you must see with the eyes of your heart,

595
01:10:00,953 --> 01:10:03,747
- not with the eyes of your head.
- Gotcha, yeah.

596
01:10:03,831 --> 01:10:07,084
Your heart will never give you fear or pain -

597
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:09,253
if you know our way.

598
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,089
Ralph.

599
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:16,510
No, thanks, pal. Keep your friggin' jewel.

600
01:10:16,593 --> 01:10:18,679
- No!
- Are you afraid?

601
01:10:19,596 --> 01:10:21,473
I just had my feet resoled.

602
01:10:21,765 --> 01:10:25,936
- What is the worst that can happen to you?
- I could wind up a Chicken McNugget.

603
01:10:26,019 --> 01:10:31,900
- What is the best that could happen to you?
- I could get through this and find the Jewel.

604
01:10:31,984 --> 01:10:34,068
It's your choice.

605
01:10:34,152 --> 01:10:36,237
Look down.

606
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:41,826
Hot coals!

607
01:10:45,538 --> 01:10:47,665
I did it! I did it! I'm one of us!

608
01:11:15,193 --> 01:11:17,278
All right! Yeah!

609
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:45,430
Your fears - they make you foolish.

610
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:54,564
Go to her, Jack.

611
01:13:16,728 --> 01:13:20,690
- I'm sorry I got people shooting at you again.
- You kidding?

612
01:13:20,774 --> 01:13:24,110
We're the perfect couple
when we got people shooting at us.

613
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:28,907
- Just the slow times I'm not too good at.
- I guess I just expect too much.

614
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:31,075
Maybe we both expect too much.

615
01:13:34,287 --> 01:13:36,372
Oh, boy.

616
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:40,501
Thank you for coming to Kadir with me.

617
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:11,073
This valley is gift of the Nile.

618
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:21,875
I've been away from here too long.

619
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:29,883
You know, I'm getting to like this guy Joe.
He's growing on me.

620
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:33,303
What do you say we cut him in
on this jewel, if we ever find it?

621
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:35,472
Jack...

622
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:38,350
We have the Jewel.

623
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,520
What are you talking about? Where?

624
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:44,398
Well, there.

625
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:50,154
- What, Joe's got the Jewel?
- No.

626
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,698
Joe is the Jewel.

627
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,579
Joe is the Jewel of the Nile?

628
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:03,833
He's a holy man. That's his religious title.

629
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,254
Joe is the Jewel.

630
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:19,932
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
Why'd you keep it from me?

631
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:23,144
Because I thought if you knew,
you wouldn't come with us.

632
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,313
Maybe I would've surprised you.

633
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:30,193
I think I've come through once or twice,
if I remember right.

634
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,987
I'm sorry.

635
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,990
You're right. You come through all the time.

636
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,665
It's funny.

637
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,211
I really thought we had a chance.

638
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:06,269
Look! The train to Kadir!

639
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,564
<i>Come on, Jack.
Inshallah, we'll be there tonight.</i>

640
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:13,819
- What a lot of people!
- They are going to see the false redeemer.

641
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:17,239
- Omar again, huh?
- We'll see about that.

642
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,276
Shit!

643
01:18:05,178 --> 01:18:07,263
What are you doing?

644
01:18:07,722 --> 01:18:10,016
Come on!

645
01:18:10,266 --> 01:18:11,935
Jump!

646
01:18:15,605 --> 01:18:17,023
No!

647
01:18:47,886 --> 01:18:49,972
No! Hang on, Joan!

648
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:10,450
Jack, watch out!

649
01:19:10,533 --> 01:19:12,535
It's...

650
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,776
Guys, wait up! Come on, Humphrey.
Go, go, go!

651
01:19:54,202 --> 01:19:56,411
Do something!

652
01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:58,580
What do you want me to do?

653
01:21:31,337 --> 01:21:33,048
Colton!

654
01:21:34,633 --> 01:21:38,012
Your ass is grass,
and I'm a lawn mower, Colton!

655
01:21:38,095 --> 01:21:40,931
Colton, I'll get you! Colton, I'm on to ya!

656
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,049
Colton.

657
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,605
All right, yeah!

658
01:23:16,066 --> 01:23:19,319
All right! Let's go, come on.
Let's get out of here!

659
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,244
Just-Joan, you're gre...

660
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:31,956
Welcome.

661
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:37,170
I don't usually travel by train,
but I had a small accident with my helicopter.

662
01:23:50,475 --> 01:23:52,769
May we reach Kadir in time.

663
01:24:15,624 --> 01:24:19,669
Once we get inside,
we must find the entrance to the catacombs.

664
01:24:20,545 --> 01:24:22,632
T-shirts! Buy T-shirts!

665
01:24:22,715 --> 01:24:27,178
Gimme the T-shirt.
I'll buy it, I'll buy it. Get outta here, will ya?

666
01:24:47,447 --> 01:24:51,326
You know, I really admire
your loyalty to each other.

667
01:24:52,035 --> 01:24:55,956
And I'm going to give you a chance
to be together to the very end.

668
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:57,916
Well, not exactly.

669
01:24:57,999 --> 01:25:01,127
One will watch the other die.

670
01:25:06,258 --> 01:25:08,343
But which one?

671
01:25:10,011 --> 01:25:12,097
Rachid.

672
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:17,060
- Is that the goat's blood?
- Yes.

673
01:25:17,144 --> 01:25:21,231
Very popular
with the inhabitants of these catacombs.

674
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:25,943
- Rats.
- Yes. They eat until they get the last drop.

675
01:25:26,318 --> 01:25:29,363
But don't worry, Mr Colton.
You won't be alone.

676
01:25:30,156 --> 01:25:35,286
Rachid is now placing acid
that will eat through Miss Wilder's rope.

677
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:38,289
What kind of sick pervert
would go to this trouble?

678
01:25:38,748 --> 01:25:40,750
- Why don't you shoot us?!
- Jack!

679
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:44,754
What kind of demented psychopath
would even think of this?

680
01:25:44,962 --> 01:25:47,465
<i>- The Savage Secret.
- What?</i>

681
01:25:48,632 --> 01:25:50,509
Was my biggest seller.

682
01:25:54,764 --> 01:25:59,393
Think about this pit
as your last adventure, Joan Wilder.

683
01:26:00,853 --> 01:26:03,147
My people await me.

684
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:26,878
What you talkin' about?
I work with professional people.

685
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:30,966
You tell His Highness
the show starts with him or without him.

686
01:26:38,681 --> 01:26:42,852
Goddamn beanie convention.
Wind up goin' home with a rug.

687
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:45,021
The entrance!

688
01:26:56,156 --> 01:26:58,450
Give me a red to the yellow. And cue!

689
01:27:00,327 --> 01:27:02,871
I said give me a red gel down there!

690
01:27:08,752 --> 01:27:11,797
And cue! For Gawd's sake, cue!

691
01:27:36,405 --> 01:27:39,408
Build it, build it softly.
And give me some smoke.

692
01:28:09,771 --> 01:28:14,192
That's good, that's good, that's very good.
Now, bring it up slowly.

693
01:29:31,393 --> 01:29:33,854
There are many rooms and many ways.

694
01:29:33,937 --> 01:29:36,148
You! You go this way.

695
01:29:36,231 --> 01:29:38,525
And, you! You go this way.

696
01:29:38,608 --> 01:29:41,068
And we: We go this way.

697
01:30:02,132 --> 01:30:04,216
Boy, it stinks in this place.

698
01:30:08,554 --> 01:30:11,182
What looks good, amigo?

699
01:30:11,265 --> 01:30:15,144
You go from this way. And... I go this way.

700
01:30:15,227 --> 01:30:17,313
All right.

701
01:30:18,314 --> 01:30:20,191
What a fruit loop.

702
01:30:21,734 --> 01:30:23,819
- How'd they get out?
- What?

703
01:30:23,903 --> 01:30:26,863
<i>In The Savage Secret, how'd they get out?</i>

704
01:30:28,698 --> 01:30:31,576
Jesse had a knife hidden in his boot.

705
01:30:32,869 --> 01:30:35,872
You wouldn't happen to have a knife,
would ya?

706
01:30:35,955 --> 01:30:39,000
- I'm not even wearing underwear.
- Great!

707
01:30:40,126 --> 01:30:42,212
No!

708
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:04,150
We were good together,
weren't we, Joan Wilder?

709
01:31:04,234 --> 01:31:06,403
The best.

710
01:31:06,486 --> 01:31:09,406
- And we're gonna make it.
- Yeah.

711
01:31:12,742 --> 01:31:15,160
Oh, God. I love you, lady.

712
01:31:15,244 --> 01:31:17,162
I love you, Jack.

713
01:31:17,496 --> 01:31:19,581
Will you marry me?

714
01:31:20,874 --> 01:31:24,169
- Yes!
- Because I never want you leaving me again.

715
01:31:24,878 --> 01:31:28,883
You're not just saying that
because this is it, are you?

716
01:31:30,593 --> 01:31:34,639
I'm saying it
because I'm not afraid to say it any more.

717
01:31:48,902 --> 01:31:52,197
So where do you wanna go
on our honeymoon?

718
01:32:13,677 --> 01:32:17,848
Rats! Get out of here, you...
Goddamn rat farm! Go on!

719
01:32:18,223 --> 01:32:23,936
- Ralph! Get us out of here, will ya?
- Ah! And there's the biggest rat of all.

720
01:32:24,854 --> 01:32:26,939
Colton, look at you. You...

721
01:32:27,899 --> 01:32:30,526
You don't know how many nights
I dreamed of this.

722
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:36,032
- Except your flesh was torn off your body.
- Ralph, please, just help us down.

723
01:32:36,115 --> 01:32:38,201
Jack! Hold on!

724
01:32:39,494 --> 01:32:42,246
Well, well, well, Colton.

725
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:46,792
I think this calls for a renegotiation.
Don't you, Tarzan? Huh?

726
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:50,128
This looks a little bit more like 70-30.

727
01:32:50,212 --> 01:32:54,717
- Or maybe even 80-20.
- Ralph, will ya get the rats off that rope?!

728
01:32:55,343 --> 01:32:59,639
- I don't go near rats, buddy.
- Ralph, do not be afraid.

729
01:33:01,099 --> 01:33:03,810
Remember the Sufi way: See with your heart.

730
01:33:04,435 --> 01:33:08,231
My heart sees rats, Pop.
Don't let this garb fool you.

731
01:33:08,314 --> 01:33:10,565
Come on, Colton. Where's the Jewel?

732
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:14,986
Ralph, I am the Jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.

733
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:18,198
And I'm a kumquat from Queens.
Pipe down, towel-head!

734
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:21,451
- Come on, Ralph.
- Take the ladder and put it over the well.

735
01:33:21,535 --> 01:33:25,205
- Please, don't let us die!
- That's a good idea, Legs.

736
01:33:25,288 --> 01:33:30,710
I ain't gonna let you die, but I ain't movin' no
ladder until you come across with the rock!

737
01:33:44,474 --> 01:33:47,018
Lookin' more like 90-10! Huh, kumquat?

738
01:33:48,895 --> 01:33:52,733
- Did you get the ladder all right?
- Jack, help me unlock the Jewel.

739
01:33:52,816 --> 01:33:57,528
The Jewel? You mean you weren't
shittin' me? That guy really is the Jewel?

740
01:33:57,611 --> 01:34:00,740
Come on.
We still got time to stop Omar. Let's go.

741
01:34:01,866 --> 01:34:04,827
Ralph, that is not the Sufi way.

742
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:10,124
I don't know what got into me, Jewels. Every
time I'm around this guy he makes me crazy.

743
01:34:10,207 --> 01:34:14,420
Come on. Tell him to cut me down, Jewels.
Come on, huh?

744
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:03,302
Don't fuck around with the equipment!
Bloody woman!

745
01:35:27,409 --> 01:35:29,494
Here they come, Jack.

746
01:35:51,224 --> 01:35:56,395
Oh, my God. Look at this. Looks like
Our Lady of Mount Palmer schoolyard.

747
01:35:57,896 --> 01:35:59,815
Hold it!

748
01:36:04,111 --> 01:36:06,822
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

749
01:36:08,449 --> 01:36:10,117
Oh, Rachid.

750
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:14,246
How ya doin'? Let's talk this over
before you butcher me alive.

751
01:36:14,329 --> 01:36:16,832
What are you getting so steamed about?

752
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:22,170
Look at that. It worked!

753
01:38:02,519 --> 01:38:04,688
Get over the wall. Come on!

754
01:38:05,063 --> 01:38:07,149
Get goin'.

755
01:38:12,112 --> 01:38:14,197
Keep going.

756
01:38:39,972 --> 01:38:43,434
I knew we'd hook up again, Colton. Get it?

757
01:38:46,187 --> 01:38:48,314
I swear to God!

758
01:38:48,397 --> 01:38:50,483
My right hand to God!

759
01:38:50,566 --> 01:38:52,651
Come on!

760
01:39:33,566 --> 01:39:38,780
I am dead, Miss Wilder.
All that will be written for Omar is an epitaph.

761
01:39:39,155 --> 01:39:41,241
But I will not be alone.

762
01:39:50,916 --> 01:39:53,460
Who is going to save you now?

763
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:57,590
Who?

764
01:40:38,714 --> 01:40:40,799
Well, you got your story.

765
01:40:41,759 --> 01:40:43,844
I got a lot more than that.

766
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,744
You are married!

767
01:41:39,649 --> 01:41:42,360
Always a bridesmaid, never the bride.

768
01:41:42,443 --> 01:41:44,945
As usual, it's zilch for poor Ralphie.

769
01:41:47,864 --> 01:41:49,950
You are Sufi.

770
01:41:52,035 --> 01:41:54,121
Keep it always.

771
01:41:55,497 --> 01:41:57,582
Guys!

772
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,046
Sufis rule!
