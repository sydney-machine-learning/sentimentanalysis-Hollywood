1
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,412
The dream is always the same.

2
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,373
<i>Instead of going home,</i>
<i>I go to the neighbors'.</i>

3
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,221
<i>I ring, but nobody answers.</i>

4
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,683
<i>The door is open, so I go inside.</i>

5
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,689
<i>I look around,</i>
<i>but no one seems to be there.</i>

6
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:37,035
<i>Then I hear the shower running.</i>

7
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:40,413
<i>So, I go upstairs to see what's what.</i>

8
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:02,938
<i>Then I see her.</i>

9
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:05,941
<i>This... girl!</i>

10
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,860
<i>This incredible girl!</i>

11
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:13,407
<i>I don't know why she's there</i>
<i>because she doesn't live there...</i>

12
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,369
<i>... but it's a dream, so I go with it.</i>

13
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,956
<i>"Who's there?" she says.</i>

14
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,083
<i>"Joel," I say.</i>

15
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,711
<i>"What are you doing here?"</i>

16
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:26,129
<i>"I don't know.</i>

17
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:28,757
<i>"What are you doing here?"</i>

18
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,844
<i>"I'm taking a shower," she says.</i>

19
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:34,722
<i>Then I give her...</i>

20
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:37,057
<i>..."Do you want me to go?"</i>

21
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:39,685
<i>"No," she says.</i>

22
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,730
<i>"I want you to wash my back."</i>

23
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:47,235
<i>I'm getting enthusiastic about this dream.</i>

24
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,158
<i>So, I go to her, but she's hard</i>
<i>to find through all the steam.</i>

25
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,411
<i>I keep losing her.</i>

26
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:09,259
<i>Finally, I get to the door...</i>

27
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,851
<i>... and I find myself in a room full</i>
<i>of kids taking their College Boards.</i>

28
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,813
<i>I'm over three hours late!</i>

29
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:24,943
<i>I've got two minutes</i>
<i>to take the whole test.</i>

30
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:31,032
<i>I've just made a terrible mistake.</i>

31
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,410
<i>I'll never get to college.</i>

32
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:36,121
<i>My life is ruined.</i>

33
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:44,129
Here's the game: Five-card draw
with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.

34
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:48,634
Pass two to the right, one to the left...

35
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:54,349
What happened?

36
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,602
Last night?

37
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,771
That's right, with Kessler.

38
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:03,651
She was babysitting down the street.

39
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:04,986
We know that!

40
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,071
So, I went over there.

41
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:12,493
She was giving the kid a bath
and accidentally hit the shower thing.

42
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:15,079
All of her clothes were drying upstairs.

43
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,336
So, she plops down on the kitchen floor...

44
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,841
...she looks up at me and says...

45
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,510
..."I think I'm in the mood."

46
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,095
She said that?

47
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,308
What did you say?

48
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,686
I didn't have to say anything.

49
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,104
What did you do?

50
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,232
What do you think I did?

51
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,404
I think you got the hell out of there,
ran home and whacked off!

52
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,409
I disagree.

53
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,621
Did you have your bike there?

54
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,835
I think you jumped on your bike,
pedaled home and whacked off!

55
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,798
That's what you think, right?

56
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:07,761
With Kessler sitting on the floor like that,
wanting me?

57
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,686
No guts, Goodson.

58
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:18,898
The problem was I just wasn't attracted
to her.

59
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,358
That should never stop you.

60
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:21,859
She seemed too big.

61
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:23,653
It could've worked out.

62
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,989
I thought I'd get into trouble.

63
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:29,743
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck!" Make your move!

64
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,830
That's easy for you to say.

65
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:38,335
You're all set.
You're probably going to Harvard.

66
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:43,049
Me, I don't want to make a mistake,
jeopardize my future!

67
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,387
Joel, let me tell you something.

68
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:53,185
Every now and then, say, "What the fuck."

69
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,439
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.

70
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:00,609
Freedom brings opportunity.

71
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:03,988
Opportunity makes your future.

72
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,160
Be right there.

73
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,627
So, your folks are going out of town?

74
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:20,673
Tomorrow.

75
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,427
You've got the place all to yourself?

76
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:28,139
Yeah?

77
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,516
"What the fuck."

78
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,442
If you can't say it...

79
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,194
...you can't do it.

80
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,832
Joel, did you get your SAT scores?

81
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:57,337
How did you do?

82
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,964
597: Math, 560: Verbal.

83
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:05,095
If you wanted to,
you could take them again?

84
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,639
- I guess so.
- Great.

85
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:09,016
Joel, I want to show you something.

86
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,268
Honey, did you pack my Mace?

87
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:13,145
Yes, in your cosmetic case.

88
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:20,904
Joel, do you hear something odd?

89
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:22,656
Something unpleasant?

90
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:23,615
No.

91
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:26,868
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?

92
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,413
No.

93
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:32,208
Is this the way I left the equalizer?

94
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,501
No.

95
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,547
This is not a toy for you and your friends.

96
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:43,220
If you can't use it properly,
you're not to use it at all.

97
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,641
My house, my rules.

98
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:55,065
<i>Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.</i>

99
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,235
He interviews for Princeton.

100
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:58,903
I'll never get into Princeton!

101
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,905
I already arranged an interview.

102
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:03,324
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.

103
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:04,993
Jesus, Dad!

104
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,163
Tell him about your involvement
with Future Enterprisers.

105
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,749
They like that.

106
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,838
There's $50 for food,
which is more than enough...

107
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:19,174
...another $50 for emergencies
and an extra $25 just in case.

108
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,261
Don't forget to water the plants
on the patio.

109
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:24,848
I made a list, it's on the refrigerator door.

110
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,558
Dad, should I start your car?

111
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,851
The car will be fine, Joel.

112
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,102
For the battery, I mean.

113
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:32,063
Please, you're not to use my car.
You're not insured for it.

114
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,733
- Use the station wagon.
- Use my car, honey.

115
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,029
Do we understand each other?

116
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:39,113
Okay!

117
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,285
As far as the house is concerned,
just use your best judgment.

118
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:45,786
We trust you.

119
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,413
Have a great time.

120
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:49,165
Be good.

121
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,001
We will, honey. You too.

122
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,687
<i>"Just take those old records off the shelf</i>

123
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:51,232
<i>"I sit and listen to them by myself</i>

124
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:55,361
<i>"Today's music ain't got the same soul</i>

125
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:58,906
<i>"I like that old time rock and roll!</i>

126
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,703
<i>"Don't try to take me to a disco</i>

127
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>"You'll never even get me out on the floor</i>

128
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,794
<i>"In ten minutes I'll be late for the door</i>

129
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:14,173
<i>"I like that old time rock and roll!</i>

130
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,386
<i>"Still like that old time rock and roll!</i>

131
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,473
<i>"That kind of music just soothes the soul</i>

132
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,935
<i>"I reminisce about the days of old</i>

133
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,815
<i>"With that old time rock and roll!"</i>

134
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:54,467
Guess what?

135
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,260
Dalby got into Harvard.

136
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,347
He must have aced his Boards.

137
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,640
780: Verbal.

138
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:02,350
765: Math!

139
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:03,601
Shit!

140
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:06,354
Do you know what a Harvard MBA makes,
first year?

141
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:07,438
$40,000.

142
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:11,235
My cousin went into dermatology.
First year, over $60,000!

143
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,320
Just for squeezing zits?

144
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:17,199
Why don't you try it, Barry?
You have the experience.

145
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,369
Thank you, you're very kind.

146
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,038
Listen, you guys.

147
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:24,874
Doesn't anyone want
to accomplish anything?

148
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,126
Or do we just want to make money?

149
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,003
Make money.

150
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,838
Just make money.

151
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,840
Make a lot of money.

152
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,759
What about you, Joel?

153
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:39,014
Serve my fellow mankind.

154
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,855
Profit motive.

155
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,235
Competition.

156
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,071
Free enterprise.

157
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:57,409
Is there any company
that doesn't have a product in production?

158
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,077
We're falling far behind.

159
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,579
You haven't exactly been helping.

160
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:02,163
You wanted to be
the production executive.

161
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:05,793
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know
helps with production.

162
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:06,919
Yeah? Who?

163
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:08,921
Everyone! Just help me
with the production!

164
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,424
I can't! I'm too busy
with marketing and sales!

165
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,301
How can you be busy
with marketing and sales?

166
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:15,636
I haven't given you the product yet!

167
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,348
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing
over tonight.

168
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,977
I only did this because I thought
it'd look good on my record.

169
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,903
Hi, Glenn. What's up?

170
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:32,488
- I heard your parents were away.
- Yeah.

171
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:36,492
I thought maybe I could borrow a room?

172
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,538
Barry is here and we're working.

173
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:42,290
We won't bother you.

174
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,376
We don't have anywhere to go.

175
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,920
You know how it is.

176
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,423
Sure. Take my room.

177
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,134
Thanks, Joel.

178
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:58,892
Ready?

179
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:00,894
The "Memo-Minder"!

180
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:02,979
Here's how it works.

181
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:07,317
A call comes in for your mom,
it's fairly important. What do you do?

182
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:11,822
You write the message down here,
hit the switch... you've got the light.

183
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:16,786
Now, a call for your dad comes in
and it's really important!

184
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,997
You're gonna get your ass kicked in
if he misses it.

185
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:21,332
So, what do you do?

186
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:24,335
Write the message down there,
hit position two...

187
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:30,801
$1.86 in parts, sell it for $9.95
and make a fortune!

188
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:39,686
I can't concentrate with this.

189
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,437
This is really annoying.

190
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:44,566
It's ridiculous!

191
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,237
I'm out of here.

192
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:59,290
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.

193
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,878
If you read me, grunt twice!

194
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:10,302
Thank you!

195
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,594
I can't believe Glenn bringing
Statwiler over like that.

196
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:50,511
Why?

197
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:53,306
Because he boffed Hendricks last week!

198
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:54,599
He did?

199
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:57,727
Yes! And after the game on Saturday,
he fucked her.

200
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,230
- Barry?
- What?

201
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:02,900
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.

202
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,027
They are?

203
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,114
Yes. What did you think it was?

204
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:11,450
I thought it was something else.

205
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,202
You're sure on this?

206
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:15,789
I'm positive.

207
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:20,252
Shit!

208
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,431
Sublime breasts.

209
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:34,308
They're what kind of breasts?

210
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,977
Sublime breasts!

211
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:42,317
A couple of boys in daddy's car.

212
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:44,486
Do you want to race?

213
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:51,994
Hit it.

214
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,269
Okay. Good.

215
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,440
You've done the old man's car bit.
That's a good start.

216
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,945
Now, try this on for size.

217
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:27,949
"The Leather Castle.

218
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:31,953
"Chicago's finest dominants
and submissives.

219
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:35,916
"Fully equipped dungeons.
Beginners welcome."

220
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,670
It sounds great, Miles.

221
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,964
Here's one!

222
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:44,467
"My daddy used to spank my bare bottom.

223
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:49,096
"Now he's gone. Will you take his place?

224
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,141
"Call Misty."

225
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,478
Come on, Joel. You've got to
take advantage of this!

226
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:56,563
They come to your house!

227
00:17:56,647 --> 00:18:00,525
"Countess Angelique seeks
young submissive with large ankles!"

228
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:02,819
This is it!

229
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:06,824
"For a good time in the privacy
of your own home, call Jackie:

230
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,826
"555-4875."

231
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:14,123
Succinct, to the point,
down to business. What do you say?

232
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:20,589
If you want to call, call for yourself.

233
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:24,009
A good time, Joel!

234
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:27,179
In the privacy of your own home!

235
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:29,682
What else can you ask for?

236
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:33,186
I'll make my own calls, thank you.

237
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,188
Then...

238
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:36,940
...call!

239
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:38,358
Forget it!

240
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:42,946
Forget it!

241
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,865
All right!

242
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,534
I'm calling.

243
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:49,537
You're calling?

244
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:52,206
Someday you'll thank me for this.

245
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,208
You'd better not mention me.

246
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,878
It's her answering machine.

247
00:18:58,296 --> 00:19:01,425
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson,
345 Remson, Glencoe.

248
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:04,928
I'd like a good time in my home tonight.
Bye!

249
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,270
That was really cute.

250
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,398
Now, give me the number
so I can call her back.

251
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,567
Number? There's no number?

252
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,987
Give me the number, damn it!

253
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,743
There's no number.

254
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:28,871
You're an asshole!

255
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:31,498
Gotta go. Catch you later.

256
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:37,296
Shithead!

257
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,370
Oh, God!

258
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,933
Hello, Joel. I'm Jackie. How are you?

259
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,480
Nice to meet you, Jackie. I'm not Joel.

260
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:13,608
Joel stepped out for a moment.

261
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:16,528
I'll go call him.

262
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:25,412
Holy shit!

263
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:31,544
Dalby, get your ass over here!

264
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:33,671
<i>I'm playing cards, Joel!</i>

265
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,340
Just get over here!

266
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:36,674
<i>Is she there?</i>

267
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:39,427
Yes, she is here,
and she is waiting for you!

268
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:42,681
She's not waiting for me,
she's waiting for you.

269
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,642
Are you coming?

270
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,186
<i>No! I'm playing cards!</i>

271
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,481
You're not coming?

272
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,652
<i>Get over here, Dalby!</i>

273
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,254
Look, I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

274
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,716
Joel, be a courageous person.
Open the door!

275
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,135
That way, you see, I can call a cab.

276
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,888
Again, I'm really sorry.

277
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:25,227
As long as we come to an arrangement,
I'm in no mood for complaining.

278
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,980
I mean, when you put
your good money down...

279
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,316
...you gotta get what you wanted
in the first place. Know what I mean?

280
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,569
When you buy a TV,
you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.

281
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,658
I know we could get along
real well. But, hey!

282
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:41,119
It's your hard-earned money, right?

283
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:45,331
This way, we make an arrangement
and everyone is satisfied.

284
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,000
You had carfare.

285
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,044
A long ride. I don't ever come out this far.

286
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:52,339
And your time.

287
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:55,676
My time, my effort,
my infinite patience and understanding.

288
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,760
Thank you.

289
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:57,845
$75.

290
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:00,848
Fair enough.

291
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:03,434
Joel, I'm going to give you a number.

292
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:05,812
You ask for Lana.

293
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,732
- It's what you want.
- Thank you.

294
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,570
It's what every white boy
off the lake wants.

295
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:48,149
<i>All right, Goodson,</i>
<i>we know you're in there!</i>

296
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:49,901
What's that?

297
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:52,987
I think someone's out there.

298
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,747
<i>Joel, the house is surrounded.</i>

299
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:05,668
<i>Do exactly as we say,</i>
<i>and no one gets hurt.</i>

300
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:07,503
Oh, shit!

301
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:12,174
<i>Get off the babysitter! Put on your</i>
<i>pants, and come out with your hands up!</i>

302
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:21,351
<i>Please, Joel, do as they say!</i>

303
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,771
<i>Get off the babysitter!</i>

304
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:27,191
<i>Don't throw your life away like this.</i>

305
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:34,115
<i>Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never</i>
<i>have a future! Not if I can help it!</i>

306
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,201
<i>You got that? No future!</i>

307
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:39,370
Who is that?

308
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:40,872
My father!

309
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,393
Hello? Lana?

310
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,604
<i>Yes?</i>

311
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:44,023
Hi.

312
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,790
I'm a nice guy,
and I'd like to meet you tonight.

313
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:01,458
<i>Fine. Where are you?</i>

314
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:05,964
<i>Where do you live?</i>

315
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,052
Glencoe.

316
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,513
<i>What's your name?</i>

317
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,187
Ralph.

318
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,524
<i>Ralph, can I have the address?</i>

319
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,116
345...

320
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,327
...Remson.

321
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:36,621
<i>Ralph?</i>

322
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:41,126
<i>I'll see you tonight.</i>

323
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,736
Are you ready for me, Ralph?

324
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:26,034
This is a beautiful place, Ralph.
Is it all yours?

325
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,537
It's my folks', actually.

326
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,498
Do you know what it's worth?

327
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:34,960
A lot, probably.

328
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:36,713
Oh, yeah! Real estate?

329
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:38,339
It's fabulous!

330
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,884
Look, Lana... my name really isn't Ralph.

331
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,223
It's Joel.

332
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:50,310
I need $300... Joel.

333
00:30:53,522 --> 00:30:54,648
You're kidding?

334
00:30:54,732 --> 00:30:56,317
No, I don't believe I am.

335
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,068
Can I send it to you?

336
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:03,032
Can you send it to me, Joel?

337
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:06,578
I just don't have that much here
in the house.

338
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:09,247
How much do you have?

339
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:11,833
- I have $50.
- $50?

340
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:15,337
What are we going to do about this?

341
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:23,179
I have a bond at the bank I could cash...

342
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:25,431
I'm not good at waiting for people.

343
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,142
I'll be quick.

344
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:29,935
Give it a try.

345
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:10,896
I'm back!

346
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:25,578
I'm here for you.

347
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,478
How could she? It's so stupid!

348
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:50,230
Tell your mother it broke!

349
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:53,025
That egg is worth a lot more than $300!

350
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,695
What are you going to do?

351
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,614
I'm gonna get it back,
is what I'm gonna do.

352
00:32:58,698 --> 00:32:59,449
Are you going to help?

353
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:00,700
Sure. When?

354
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:03,578
Right now!

355
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:07,165
I can't do it right now!
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow!

356
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,126
Hey, "Mr. What-The-Fuck"...

357
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:11,629
...what about "exploring
the dark side" and all that?

358
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:13,505
Or was that just bullshit?

359
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:15,966
That was just bullshit, Joel.

360
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:20,012
I'm surprised you listened to me.

361
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,062
Are you coming?

362
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:38,366
How can you even tell if she'll be here?

363
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:42,328
I called Jackie and she said to try here.

364
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:47,583
Great idea. Where else could
we get a hot chocolate for $4?

365
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:51,004
She's here!

366
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,632
Where?

367
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:57,010
The blue dress... those legs...

368
00:33:58,762 --> 00:33:59,930
That's her.

369
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,640
She's fantastic!

370
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,361
She's looking right at us!

371
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,831
She knows we're here.

372
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:35,427
That's it?

373
00:34:36,386 --> 00:34:37,762
That's it, Joel?

374
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:43,853
I can't believe we came
all the way here for that!

375
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,065
At least she knows we're on to her, Miles.

376
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:50,026
Yeah, she must be terrified.

377
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:51,193
Joel!

378
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,365
Is this your car?

379
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:58,285
Maybe.

380
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:01,997
Could we talk a minute?

381
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:03,540
Okay.

382
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,542
Let's talk!

383
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,670
Okay. In the car, all right? It's freezing.

384
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,060
Will you do me a favor?

385
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,105
You want me to do you a favor?

386
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,482
I just need a lift.

387
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:28,317
Look, I want my egg back!

388
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,488
Get out of the car!

389
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:33,906
Joel, better get moving.

390
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:35,407
I want my egg back!

391
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:37,326
You got it, all right? Just start driving!

392
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:38,286
When?

393
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:40,330
- Now!
- Open the door!

394
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:42,248
When do I get it back?

395
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:43,541
Start driving!

396
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,252
Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?

397
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:47,504
Hey, buster!

398
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:48,797
Fuck! Will you just...

399
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,924
- Get off the car!
- Just start driving!

400
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,468
Start driving, now!

401
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:56,138
Why don't you start the car, Joel?

402
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,599
Fuck! Get out of here!

403
00:35:58,683 --> 00:36:00,685
Start the goddamn car, Joel!

404
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:02,520
Lana, open the door.

405
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:06,483
Where are you going? Lana!

406
00:36:06,692 --> 00:36:08,485
Get out, or I'll kill you!

407
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:21,290
Who was that guy?

408
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:22,875
My manager.

409
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,670
He gets a little crazy sometimes.

410
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,881
This is my friend, Miles.

411
00:36:31,217 --> 00:36:33,220
Do you like excitement, Miles?

412
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:34,555
Love it.

413
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:54,284
Okay, where do you want to go?

414
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:58,371
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

415
00:36:58,455 --> 00:36:59,706
Tell me this:

416
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,043
Am I going in the right direction?

417
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:05,796
Oh, shit! Here he comes!

418
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:07,465
Here who comes?

419
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,675
That manager guy?

420
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,890
Hey, Guido!

421
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:16,850
Big man, Guido!

422
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:19,394
Big man with a gun!

423
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:20,854
What are you going to do?

424
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:22,522
Shoot us all? Stupid!

425
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,738
This guy Guido...

426
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,449
...he's a "manager"?
- That's right.

427
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,409
Or a pimp?

428
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,286
Now, that's quick, Joel.

429
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:38,539
Have you always been this quick,
or is this something new?

430
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,208
I don't believe this!

431
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,919
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow...

432
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:44,922
...and I'm being chased by Guido,
The Killer Pimp!

433
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:11,283
Miles?

434
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:13,869
I think I can take him.

435
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:15,663
What are you talking...

436
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:47,822
I'm really not enjoying this.

437
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:10,055
I think I'm going to throw up.

438
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,068
I think I'm going to throw up on you, Joel!

439
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,426
Porsche...

440
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,387
...there is no substitute.

441
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:51,474
Fuck you.

442
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:57,939
Hi, dear. It's Mother.

443
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,358
How are you?

444
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,902
Just checking in to say hello,
see how you're doing...

445
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:04,363
...and give you our flight information.

446
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,867
Wait a minute. Let me write this down.

447
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,872
Saturday, United, Flight 162 at 3:30.

448
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,920
That's right. How's everything else?
Do you have enough money?

449
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:22,966
It never seems to go as far
as you think it will.

450
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:26,303
Yes, I know.

451
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:28,305
I'm learning, Mom.

452
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:31,726
How is Aunt Tudi?

453
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:37,606
I will.

454
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,318
See you then, bye.

455
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:44,156
Your folks?

456
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,992
So, how are they?

457
00:40:47,326 --> 00:40:49,036
Oh, they're just great.

458
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:50,662
How about Aunt Tudi?

459
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:53,458
Her hip is much better.
She sends her love.

460
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:01,090
You were telling me about Guido.

461
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:02,675
I quit Guido.

462
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:06,429
How come?

463
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:12,978
He thought he owned me.

464
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:15,814
Nobody owns me.

465
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:23,198
The problem is, I owe him for clothes
and hospital bills.

466
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,200
You were in the hospital?

467
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:28,161
I had this...

468
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,330
...pain in my chest.

469
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:32,624
I thought it was a heart condition.

470
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:35,753
What was it?

471
00:41:36,045 --> 00:41:37,755
The doctor said nerves.

472
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:39,674
Nice service.

473
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:41,884
Reed & Barton.

474
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:47,264
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.

475
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,311
I'm going to school now.

476
00:41:56,858 --> 00:41:58,819
I'll have to ask you to leave.

477
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:03,658
I'm sorry.

478
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:06,369
You won't let me stay?

479
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,622
No, I have to go to school.

480
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:15,754
I'm really sorry.

481
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:21,385
No, I'm sorry.

482
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:28,475
I'll be right back.

483
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,815
You guys go ahead without me.

484
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:35,817
She's still here?

485
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,277
She won't leave.

486
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,282
She won't leave.

487
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:49,248
Lana, look...

488
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:53,210
...I just want my egg back.
I want my house back.

489
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:56,131
I have a lot of work to do.

490
00:42:58,425 --> 00:43:00,635
Did you have a good time last night?

491
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,433
You mean when we got back here?

492
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:09,353
I think you know what I mean.

493
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,570
I had a great time.

494
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:23,452
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.

495
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,581
Did I say you owe me anything?

496
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:30,876
No, you didn't.

497
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,796
I don't remember saying
you owe me anything.

498
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,721
What about my mother's egg?

499
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:45,809
You're the one who's going to college,
you figure it out.

500
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,816
How much time do you need?

501
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:54,610
I need long enough
to make a few phone calls.

502
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:57,571
I have to figure out how
to get my stuff back.

503
00:43:57,655 --> 00:44:00,950
Guido has probably locked me
out of the apartment by now.

504
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:02,451
All right!

505
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:06,164
But will you do me a favor?

506
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:08,041
Anything, cookie.

507
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:11,837
Don't steal anything!

508
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:17,509
If I come back here,
and find anything missing...

509
00:44:18,678 --> 00:44:21,723
...I'm going straight to the police.
I'm not joking!

510
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:25,184
Joel, go to school. Go learn something.

511
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,119
May I see your pass, please!

512
00:44:43,954 --> 00:44:47,292
I'm sure you've all read
chapters six through eight...

513
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:50,211
...so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.

514
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:52,964
Will you put your books on the floor,
please?

515
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:17,115
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

516
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,575
No. Glenn knows.

517
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:20,327
What about Barry?

518
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,703
He knows, too.

519
00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:23,622
Don't tell anyone!

520
00:45:24,081 --> 00:45:25,499
I won't! I won't!

521
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:38,596
Lab reports should be on my desk
by tomorrow afternoon.

522
00:45:39,597 --> 00:45:41,892
I won't accept any that aren't typed.

523
00:45:57,283 --> 00:45:59,536
Term papers are due on Friday.

524
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:02,288
They count for 50%
of this semester's grades.

525
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:05,542
Damn it!

526
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:16,470
Hey, Miles, what's going on?

527
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,139
I'm waiting for Glenn.

528
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:19,682
Glenn? Where is he?

529
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:20,766
Inside.

530
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,811
In the house?

531
00:46:22,894 --> 00:46:24,479
He wanted to meet her!

532
00:46:26,773 --> 00:46:27,816
What are you doing?

533
00:46:27,899 --> 00:46:28,900
I was inside.

534
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:30,318
I can see that.

535
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:34,906
You're home now.

536
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:37,243
Yeah, I live here, remember?

537
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,039
Glenn?

538
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:46,836
Tell me you didn't do anything with her.

539
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:48,004
Who, Lana?

540
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:49,715
Yeah, Lana.

541
00:46:49,923 --> 00:46:50,966
Nothing.

542
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,384
I met her.

543
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:53,844
She's nice.

544
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:56,597
You're sure you didn't do anything?

545
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,349
Yeah, I swear.

546
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:01,185
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?

547
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,855
I did not do it with her, Joel!

548
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:12,405
Ask me about Vicki!

549
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,116
Who is Vicki?

550
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,535
Owe you one!

551
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:23,292
Are you Joel? Nice place you have here.

552
00:47:24,877 --> 00:47:26,045
Where's Lana?

553
00:47:26,128 --> 00:47:27,254
In the den.

554
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:28,798
I like your friend!

555
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:32,219
Get out! I'm not kidding!

556
00:47:32,636 --> 00:47:34,137
What's your problem?

557
00:47:36,348 --> 00:47:38,100
Just leave! Please!

558
00:47:38,892 --> 00:47:41,561
Look, we're not ripping you off or anything.

559
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,318
What is this for?

560
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:50,029
Fifty goes to the house! You're the house!

561
00:47:52,156 --> 00:47:53,908
I am not the house!

562
00:47:55,576 --> 00:47:57,413
Just leave! I mean it!

563
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:00,791
He's mad, Vicki.

564
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,918
Already? I just got here!

565
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:05,170
I think he wants us to go.

566
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:07,131
Do you want us to go?

567
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:11,970
Thank you.

568
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:39,875
<i>I don't want any problems.</i>

569
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,044
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>you did to me last night?</i>

570
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,378
<i>I don't care!</i>

571
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,633
<i>I don't want to see you</i>
<i>or do anything with you anymore.</i>

572
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,010
<i>Get in the car!</i>

573
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:14,661
Excuse me.

574
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:17,831
What can I do for you?

575
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:19,626
Who are you?

576
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:28,218
Are you the kid I chased last night?

577
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:32,472
Is there something I can help you with?

578
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:35,017
You shouldn't drive like that.

579
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:37,311
People get hurt all the time.

580
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:40,314
Are you a smart kid?

581
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:43,109
You look like a smart kid.

582
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,610
I'm okay.

583
00:49:44,694 --> 00:49:46,612
Where are the girls? Inside?

584
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,868
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.

585
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,500
The door is locked.

586
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,421
You're starting to give me a stomachache.

587
00:50:01,504 --> 00:50:03,214
Good! I hope it hurts!

588
00:50:04,382 --> 00:50:05,800
Are you going to open the door?

589
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:08,428
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!

590
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:09,929
Shut your mouth!

591
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:13,182
Listen, maybe we don't work
for you anymore!

592
00:50:15,018 --> 00:50:16,311
Then who do you work for?

593
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:18,564
Who? If you don't work for me?

594
00:50:19,064 --> 00:50:20,983
Maybe we work for Joel, now.

595
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:24,361
She's only kidding.

596
00:50:24,903 --> 00:50:26,030
I hope so.

597
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:30,577
Joel, you look like a smart kid.

598
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:35,707
I'm going to tell you something
I'm sure you'll understand.

599
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,668
You're having fun now, right?

600
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,922
Right, Joel? The time of your life.

601
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:48,137
In a sluggish economy, never, ever fuck
with another man's livelihood!

602
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:52,975
If you're smart, like I hope you are...

603
00:50:56,271 --> 00:50:58,982
...you aren't going to make me
come back here.

604
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:08,993
Thank you, Joel.

605
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:13,706
It's very decent of you.

606
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,334
Just as long as we understand each other.

607
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:19,629
One night, then you'll find another place
to stay.

608
00:51:19,962 --> 00:51:22,340
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy,
we'll have a place.

609
00:51:22,423 --> 00:51:24,927
- Did you try her again?
- She's still out.

610
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:26,887
And my mother's egg?

611
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:30,182
If I can get my stuff back, I can get the egg.

612
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:32,643
Then you'll leave?

613
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:34,103
Then we'll leave.

614
00:51:35,312 --> 00:51:38,274
I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends.

615
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,318
Clean, polite, quick.

616
00:51:41,486 --> 00:51:43,446
I think there's a future here.

617
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:04,010
What are you studying?

618
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:07,013
It's a workshop...

619
00:52:07,764 --> 00:52:09,349
...on free enterprise.

620
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:18,735
We make a product,
and then we try to market it.

621
00:52:21,779 --> 00:52:23,573
Do you make a lot of money?

622
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:25,908
No. Not really.

623
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:30,872
No, but we...

624
00:52:32,124 --> 00:52:34,626
...get to compete with other
student companies.

625
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:36,336
Actually, it's fucked!

626
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:39,006
I'm just kidding.

627
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:42,176
It's really quite competitive.

628
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:48,266
Do you ever get high, Joel?

629
00:52:50,226 --> 00:52:51,728
Yeah. All the time.

630
00:52:52,479 --> 00:52:55,565
You see, Vicki and I were thinking
about getting high.

631
00:52:56,733 --> 00:52:59,570
Maybe going out
and getting some ice cream?

632
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:03,616
You want to come?

633
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:11,665
I could go for some ice cream right now.

634
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:25,514
Are you stoned?

635
00:53:25,932 --> 00:53:27,934
No. I do not believe so.

636
00:53:30,228 --> 00:53:32,188
I think you're really wasted!

637
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:35,149
This is not wasted, Barry.

638
00:53:35,566 --> 00:53:37,527
This is definitely not wasted.

639
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,492
Barry?

640
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,498
- I'm a little wasted!
- I know.

641
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:55,588
- Don't let me do anything stupid.
- Don't worry.

642
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:01,052
Want to take a walk?

643
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,062
How do you like living at home?

644
00:54:12,398 --> 00:54:13,733
It's okay.

645
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:15,651
I'll be out next year.

646
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:18,112
I'll bet your folks are nice.

647
00:54:18,612 --> 00:54:20,614
They're gone till Sunday?

648
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:21,950
Yeah.

649
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:25,203
Because, I was thinking...

650
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,330
I mean, after your friend came over...

651
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:29,124
...I couldn't believe it!

652
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,460
A kid our age walks in with a $100!

653
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:33,712
Glenn.

654
00:54:34,464 --> 00:54:36,758
Where did he get that kind of change?

655
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:38,301
I don't know.

656
00:54:39,469 --> 00:54:41,471
He said he cashed a bond.

657
00:54:42,805 --> 00:54:44,807
You people have a lot of bonds.

658
00:54:48,479 --> 00:54:50,105
So, I was thinking...

659
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:55,569
...if we ever got our friends together,
we'd make a fortune!

660
00:54:56,612 --> 00:54:58,113
Yeah. You're right.

661
00:54:59,782 --> 00:55:01,492
Do you want to do that?

662
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:02,744
Do what?

663
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:05,497
Get our friends together
in the next few days.

664
00:55:07,624 --> 00:55:09,501
No. I don't think so.

665
00:55:11,795 --> 00:55:14,631
Make some money. Be a little enterpriser.

666
00:55:15,131 --> 00:55:16,592
Future enterpriser.

667
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:20,179
Be whatever you want to be.

668
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,856
What if I said I'd be your girlfriend
for the next few nights?

669
00:55:30,816 --> 00:55:31,900
No charge?

670
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:37,072
Hey, I'm not pushing you on the idea.

671
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:40,659
It's just that my mind keeps working
all the time.

672
00:55:40,742 --> 00:55:44,247
Nothing I can do about it.
It keeps working and working.

673
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:59,138
You warm enough?

674
00:55:59,346 --> 00:56:00,431
I'm okay.

675
00:56:06,895 --> 00:56:08,605
How come you left home?

676
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:11,526
Why?

677
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,446
I was just wondering.

678
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:21,077
Because my step-father
kept coming on to me.

679
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:26,041
What else do you want to know?

680
00:56:30,212 --> 00:56:32,548
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

681
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,676
I have a brother.

682
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,344
What else?

683
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:40,140
If you don't want to talk...

684
00:56:40,223 --> 00:56:41,475
No, no. Ask me anything.

685
00:56:41,558 --> 00:56:43,810
I don't think you want to talk and it's okay.

686
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:46,063
No, I really want to talk to you.

687
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:50,734
What does he do?

688
00:56:51,736 --> 00:56:53,112
He's in school.

689
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:57,784
How come you're not in school?

690
00:56:58,242 --> 00:56:59,702
I'm not my brother.

691
00:57:06,502 --> 00:57:09,004
I'm really trying to be friends with you.

692
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:12,341
But I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop trying to judge me...

693
00:57:12,424 --> 00:57:15,427
...while you're leaning on your
daddy's $40,000 car.

694
00:57:19,641 --> 00:57:21,142
I'll see you around.

695
00:57:28,108 --> 00:57:29,776
Was it something I said?

696
00:57:36,492 --> 00:57:39,662
You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!

697
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:42,623
Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

698
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:01,477
Please stop! Please stop!

699
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:35,346
Thank you.

700
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:36,681
Thank you.

701
00:59:19,894 --> 00:59:22,147
All right, everyone watch your feet!

702
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,209
Are you okay?

703
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:46,131
Do you want an aspirin?

704
00:59:50,261 --> 00:59:51,929
Does your dad own a gun?

705
00:59:56,434 --> 00:59:58,227
Who's the U-boat commander?

706
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:16,496
You're right. You are absolutely
right to respond this way.

707
01:00:17,623 --> 01:00:19,751
I did not have a doctor's appointment.

708
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:22,420
But I will tell you exactly what happened.

709
01:00:22,962 --> 01:00:24,547
"Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan...

710
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,633
...lf you write "unexcused,"
I fail two mid-terms.

711
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,303
It'll wreck my whole grade point average!

712
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:35,100
If you'd just stop and listen to me,
I'll explain everything.

713
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:44,486
The truth is, my parents are away,
and I met this girl.

714
01:00:46,488 --> 01:00:49,157
A call girl, actually.
She came to my house.

715
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:52,744
Look, you're writing again!

716
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:54,496
This is not "unexcused"!

717
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,627
If you will just listen to me,
then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.

718
01:01:01,337 --> 01:01:03,255
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

719
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:05,299
I had a doctor's appointment.

720
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:10,930
Excuse me.

721
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:14,726
It wasn't the girl, it was my father's car.

722
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,437
I put my father's car into Lake Michigan...

723
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:19,523
...and I had to get it fixed.

724
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:23,610
Just give me a break.

725
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:30,243
Let me put it this way.

726
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:35,206
I have spent the last four years
of my life busting my butt in this shithole!

727
01:01:38,709 --> 01:01:39,795
I'm sorry.

728
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:44,425
I don't think I can leave until I get
just a little compassion from you.

729
01:01:50,722 --> 01:01:52,015
What did he get?

730
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,977
Suspension, five days.

731
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:56,896
They kicked him out
of Future Enterprisers, too.

732
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,149
Shit! They trashed his whole record!

733
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:01,484
What's he going to do about the car?

734
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:06,907
Are you okay, Joel?

735
01:02:08,743 --> 01:02:09,994
I'm okay.

736
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,923
I need a bike.

737
01:02:22,507 --> 01:02:23,508
He needs a bike.

738
01:02:23,592 --> 01:02:26,178
- Glenn, can I borrow your bike?
- Jesus, Glenn!

739
01:02:26,261 --> 01:02:27,846
Sure. Here, use mine.

740
01:04:58,299 --> 01:05:00,635
<i>It was great the way her mind worked:</i>

741
01:05:00,802 --> 01:05:02,804
<i>No guilt, no doubts, no fear.</i>

742
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:05,390
<i>None of my specialties.</i>

743
01:05:09,228 --> 01:05:12,898
<i>Just this shameless pursuit of immediate</i>
<i>material gratification.</i>

744
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:15,651
<i>What a capitalist!</i>

745
01:05:19,072 --> 01:05:23,076
<i>She told me I could make more money</i>
<i>in one night than I'd make all year.</i>

746
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:25,286
<i>Enough to pay for my father's car.</i>

747
01:05:25,745 --> 01:05:27,914
<i>She told me she'd be my girlfriend.</i>

748
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:33,212
<i>She told me a lot of things.</i>

749
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:34,797
<i>I believed them all.</i>

750
01:05:35,756 --> 01:05:38,050
<i>So, she introduced me to her friends.</i>

751
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:45,600
<i>"Now when I was a young boy</i>

752
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,020
<i>"At the age of five</i>

753
01:05:50,856 --> 01:05:53,024
<i>"My mother said I was going to be</i>

01:05:54,192 --> 01:05:55,902
<i>"The greatest man alive</i>

755
01:05:57,529 --> 01:05:59,115
<i>"But now I'm a man</i>

756
01:06:01,117 --> 01:06:02,702
<i>"Way past twenty-one</i>

757
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,372
<i>"I want you to believe me, baby</i>

758
01:06:07,707 --> 01:06:09,292
<i>"I have lots of fun</i>

759
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:12,378
<i>"I'm a man"</i>

760
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:17,468
<i>I introduced her to my friends.</i>

761
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:27,228
<i>We made Barry our treasurer.</i>

762
01:06:30,398 --> 01:06:31,900
<i>Lana did production.</i>

763
01:06:33,067 --> 01:06:35,028
<i>I concentrated on sales.</i>

764
01:06:36,154 --> 01:06:38,448
So, you took her out to dinner twice.

765
01:06:38,823 --> 01:06:40,659
What did that cost you?

766
01:06:41,076 --> 01:06:42,161
About $30.

767
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:43,287
With tip?

768
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:44,830
Okay, maybe $35.

769
01:06:45,331 --> 01:06:46,707
Any movies?

770
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:48,417
Three movies.

771
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:49,668
$20.

772
01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:51,837
Parking?

773
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:53,464
I park on the street.

774
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:54,633
Gas?

775
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:57,511
Maybe $6.

776
01:06:59,846 --> 01:07:02,682
All right, Stan, you're in for roughly $60.

777
01:07:09,482 --> 01:07:10,733
What happened?

778
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:13,986
She slept with Jacobsen.

779
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:19,826
That's all I'm saying.

780
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,164
<i>"I can make love to you, woman</i>

781
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,042
<i>"In five minutes' time</i>

782
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,087
<i>"Ain't that a man?"</i>

783
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,055
Do you know what he said... afterwards?

784
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,059
He said the lady had knowledge.

785
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,812
He was glad to get that knowledge.

786
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:47,522
Do you know why?

787
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:48,774
Why?

788
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,403
Because college girls can smell ignorance...

789
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:54,780
...like dog shit.

790
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,824
I'll think about it.

791
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,160
Where are you going to school next year?

792
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:00,369
Wisconsin.

793
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,079
Wisconsin?

794
01:08:03,498 --> 01:08:04,624
Big school.

795
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,063
All I'm saying is...

796
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,941
...walk like a man.

797
01:08:57,139 --> 01:08:59,350
Joel! This is a great party!

798
01:09:01,227 --> 01:09:03,020
Are you having a good time?

799
01:09:11,404 --> 01:09:13,907
Excellent idea, Joel! Really excellent.

800
01:09:20,413 --> 01:09:23,083
Some of the girls are wearing
my mother's clothing.

801
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,418
What's wrong with that?

802
01:09:24,502 --> 01:09:26,629
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in analysis.

803
01:09:26,712 --> 01:09:28,923
- Just talk to them, okay?
- All right.

804
01:10:13,888 --> 01:10:15,431
Is Howie Rifkin here?

805
01:10:15,848 --> 01:10:17,266
You're on, honey.

806
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:42,877
Joel! Somebody is at the front door
for you.

807
01:10:43,211 --> 01:10:45,838
All right, thank you. I'll be right there.

808
01:10:46,924 --> 01:10:48,467
The thing is...

809
01:10:49,927 --> 01:10:51,887
...I don't have to pay for it.

810
01:10:54,556 --> 01:10:55,891
I get it anyway.

811
01:11:01,564 --> 01:11:04,275
I'm going to get going
or I'll miss the party.

812
01:11:09,572 --> 01:11:11,658
Whatever you want to do...

813
01:11:25,923 --> 01:11:27,801
Excuse me. Can I help you?

814
01:11:28,426 --> 01:11:29,636
Are you Joel?

815
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,138
Yes.

816
01:11:31,304 --> 01:11:33,181
Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.

817
01:11:33,265 --> 01:11:35,725
I believe we had an interview scheduled.

818
01:11:36,268 --> 01:11:38,228
If this is inconvenient for you...

819
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:39,813
No, sir. It's fine.

820
01:11:50,116 --> 01:11:52,118
Is it okay if I have the room?

821
01:11:55,456 --> 01:11:58,542
Also, could you catch the phone
if anyone calls, please?

822
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,712
I understand that you would like
to attend Princeton.

823
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:04,548
Yes, sir, very much.

824
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:06,300
Well, fine.

825
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:09,637
Let's take a look at what we have,
shall we?

826
01:12:23,694 --> 01:12:25,237
Does this couch open?

827
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,448
Lana, I'm in a meeting.

828
01:12:27,531 --> 01:12:28,908
We need the room.

829
01:12:29,658 --> 01:12:31,744
I need a few minutes, okay?

830
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:40,045
Now, you've taken your SAT's already.

831
01:12:40,378 --> 01:12:44,633
Math: 597, Verbal: 560. Correct me
if my information is inaccurate.

832
01:12:46,176 --> 01:12:49,387
Well, yes, but I was planning on taking
those again.

833
01:12:49,513 --> 01:12:52,475
Fine. Now, your grade point
average is 3.14.

834
01:12:53,684 --> 01:12:55,394
You class rank: 52...

835
01:12:55,728 --> 01:12:59,190
...which places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct?

836
01:13:00,024 --> 01:13:02,693
Joel, this is my cousin, Ruben,
from Skokie.

837
01:13:03,027 --> 01:13:04,279
Can you get him in tonight?

838
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:05,697
Not now, okay?

839
01:13:05,864 --> 01:13:08,909
- He has to be back by 12:00.
- All right, later guys.

840
01:13:14,665 --> 01:13:15,749
Excuse me.

841
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:19,879
And you wish to major in?

842
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:23,633
Business.

843
01:13:24,592 --> 01:13:26,136
Business. Yes.

844
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,810
I'll be out in a second.

845
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:40,276
Fine, well, let's see what else there is.

846
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:44,614
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team,
Recording Secretary, Spanish Club...

847
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:49,327
"...Varsity Track Team: One year...

"...Student Council: Two years."

851
01:14:02,258 --> 01:14:04,844
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.

852
01:14:06,429 --> 01:14:08,931
You've done some very solid work here...

853
01:14:09,974 --> 01:14:12,478
...but it isn't quite Ivy League, is it?

854
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:19,776
You know, Bill...

855
01:14:21,278 --> 01:14:24,323
...there's one thing I've learned
in all my years.

856
01:14:24,948 --> 01:14:27,785
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck."

857
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:30,121
Make your move.

858
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,750
I beg your pardon?

859
01:14:36,127 --> 01:14:37,712
So, how are we doing?

860
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,591
Looks like University of Illinois!

861
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,635
<i>"All right, all right!</i>

862
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:45,471

01:14:51,811 --> 01:14:53,939

<i>"Everybody clap your hands now!"</i>

866
01:15:23,554 --> 01:15:26,098
Some of your friends are looking for you.

867
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:31,019
What do you want me to tell them?

868
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,693
Has that guy from Princeton left yet?

869
01:15:36,901 --> 01:15:39,946
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.

870
01:15:40,029 --> 01:15:41,030
Talking?

871
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:43,491
They're very good talkers.

872
01:15:46,536 --> 01:15:49,748
I don't think I'm going to say,
"What the fuck" anymore.

873
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:53,294
This thing has gotten way out of control.

874
01:15:56,088 --> 01:15:57,798
I'm going to kill Miles.

875
01:15:58,549 --> 01:16:00,050
Oh, come on, Joel.

876
01:16:02,762 --> 01:16:05,891
Look at it this way.
You're making a lot of money.

877
01:16:06,558 --> 01:16:09,269
You're providing your friends
with an invaluable service.

878
01:16:09,352 --> 01:16:11,521
God knows, they needed the service!

879
01:16:12,606 --> 01:16:16,152
And, right now, you are one hot-shit
future enterpriser.

880
01:16:20,781 --> 01:16:23,493
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.

881
01:16:27,246 --> 01:16:29,750
And... you have a girlfriend to boot.

882
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:31,793
Do I?

883
01:16:31,877 --> 01:16:33,587
Phone call for Joel.

884
01:16:33,796 --> 01:16:35,214
Here, I'll get it.

885
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:37,257
Well, do I?

886
01:16:39,718 --> 01:16:41,136
What do you think?

887
01:16:41,637 --> 01:16:43,431
I don't know. You tell me.

888
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:45,141
Yes? No? Maybe?

889
01:16:47,393 --> 01:16:48,311
Yes.

890
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:51,898
No.

891
01:16:55,318 --> 01:16:56,278
Maybe.

Who answered the phone?

895
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,581
Just a friend, Dad.

896
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:08,833
<i>Do I know her?</i>

897
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,669
Have you ever made love on a real train?

898
01:17:10,752 --> 01:17:12,128
I don't think so.

899
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:13,964
He's got a girl.

900
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:16,633
Let's make love on a real train.

901
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:18,510
<i>Joel, are you there?</i>

902
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:22,264
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom?
Is everything all right?

903
01:17:23,265 --> 01:17:24,267
Let's go.

904
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,060
Did I hear others there?

905
01:17:27,436 --> 01:17:29,147
Just a few friends, Dad.

906
01:17:33,025 --> 01:17:34,527
<i>Sounds like a party.</i>

907
01:17:35,611 --> 01:17:36,612
A party?

908
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,199
Come on, let's be alone together.

909
01:17:39,283 --> 01:17:42,369
I don't remember giving
permission for a party, Joel.

910
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:46,623
Honey, can you hear me?

911
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:49,710
There's nothing wrong
with having friends over.

912
01:17:49,793 --> 01:17:52,463
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you.

913
01:17:53,214 --> 01:17:56,217
<i>We're coming in on United,</i>
<i>Flight 162 at 3:30.</i>

914
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:57,552
<i>"Trust."</i>

915
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:00,889
<i>Seems to me if there were any logic</i>
<i>to our language...</i>

916
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:03,349
<i>..."trust" would be a four-letter word.</i>

917
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,481
<i>The evening worked out well.</i>
<i>We had a good cash flow.</i>

918
01:18:09,648 --> 01:18:11,817
<i>Rutherford made a few new friends.</i>

919
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:15,029
<i>He said he'd do his best for me.</i>

920
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:24,831
<i>Finally, it was time to close shop.</i>

921
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,918
<i>The girls were exhausted.</i>

922
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:31,338
<i>Lana was hungry.</i>
<i>She wanted to go out for a bite.</i>

923
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:35,009
<i>She wanted to make love on a real train.</i>

924
01:18:36,093 --> 01:18:37,595
<i>Who was I to say no?</i>

925
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,433
<i>"I can feel it coming in the air tonight</i>

926
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:53,487
<i>"And I've been waiting for this moment</i>
<i>for all my life</i>

927
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:01,871
<i>"Can you feel it coming"</i>

928
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:04,541
I thought no one was going to be here.

929
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:07,877
Be patient.

930
01:19:19,056 --> 01:19:20,724
<i>"Well, I remember</i>

931
01:19:21,976 --> 01:19:23,978
<i>"I remember</i> - <i>don't worry</i>

932
01:19:26,147 --> 01:19:28,150
<i>"How could I ever forget?</i>

933
01:19:29,401 --> 01:19:30,902
<i>"It's the first time</i>

934
01:19:32,487 --> 01:19:34,531
<i>"The last time we ever met</i>

935
01:19:39,161 --> 01:19:41,038
<i>"But I know the reason</i>

936
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:44,208
<i>"Why you keep the silence up</i>

937
01:19:46,419 --> 01:19:48,296
<i>"No, you don't fool me</i>

938
01:19:49,755 --> 01:19:51,424
<i>"The hurt doesn't show</i>

939
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:54,177
<i>"But the pain still grows</i>

940
01:19:54,845 --> 01:19:57,097
<i>"It's no stranger to you or me</i>

941
01:20:00,601 --> 01:20:03,353
<i>"I can feel it coming in the air tonight</i>

942
01:20:10,862 --> 01:20:14,407
<i>"Well, I've been waiting</i>
<i>for this moment for all my life</i>

943
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:23,459
<i>"I can feel it in the air tonight"</i>

944
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:15,124
<i>Hi.</i>

945
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:17,210
They stole the goddamn house, Lana!

946
01:24:17,293 --> 01:24:18,961
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

947
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:21,088
<i>But if you'll leave your name and number...</i>

948
01:24:21,172 --> 01:24:23,758
<i>... I'll call you back as soon as possible.</i>

949
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,344
They took everything!

950
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:27,637
This is unbelievable!

951
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,308
My parents will be home in two hours,
Lana, and they took fucking everything!

952
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:33,644
<i>I don't know if you know</i>
<i>anything about this...</i>

953
01:24:33,727 --> 01:24:35,479
<i>... but you have to call me right away!</i>

954
01:24:35,562 --> 01:24:37,481
<i>I'm at the house: KL5-2121.</i>

955
01:24:37,731 --> 01:24:39,900
<i>Look, you've really got to help me!</i>

956
01:24:40,734 --> 01:24:42,654
Time of your life, huh, kid?

957
01:24:43,238 --> 01:24:44,489
Where's Lana?

958
01:24:44,572 --> 01:24:46,157
<i>Maybe she's on the choo-choo.</i>

959
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:48,868
I hear she's got this thing
about choo-choos.

960
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,162
I want to know who took my stuff.

961
01:24:51,246 --> 01:24:53,873
<i>I took your stuff, Joel, are you kidding?</i>

962
01:24:54,499 --> 01:24:56,585
Then you listen to me, buster!

963
01:24:56,669 --> 01:24:57,795
You a-hole!

964
01:24:58,087 --> 01:25:00,089
<i>If I don't get my stuff back...</i>

965
01:25:00,506 --> 01:25:01,382
Shit!

966
01:25:11,184 --> 01:25:12,269
"A-hole?"

967
01:25:13,103 --> 01:25:15,355
<i>I want my furniture back, right now!</i>

968
01:25:16,273 --> 01:25:17,524
Now, you listen to me.

969
01:25:17,607 --> 01:25:19,609
No, no! You listen to me!

970
01:25:21,027 --> 01:25:21,903
Shit!

971
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:30,329
<i>This is getting boring.</i>

972
01:25:30,454 --> 01:25:33,082
Can I have my furniture back? Please?

973
01:25:34,292 --> 01:25:36,419
You listen to me, you little fuck!

974
01:25:37,796 --> 01:25:40,174
You not only took my two best girls...

975
01:25:40,549 --> 01:25:42,885
...you call me names and insult me!

976
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:45,220
I'm sorry.

977
01:25:45,304 --> 01:25:47,222
<i>If I had any self-respect...</i>

978
01:25:47,306 --> 01:25:49,558
...it wouldn't just be the furniture...

979
01:25:49,641 --> 01:25:52,604
...it would be your legs! Your arms!
Your head!

980
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:56,900
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

981
01:25:56,983 --> 01:25:58,109
Yes, we do.

982
01:25:58,401 --> 01:26:00,778
No! Do we understand each other?

983
01:26:02,739 --> 01:26:04,742
<i>Yes, we understand each other.</i>

984
01:26:07,411 --> 01:26:09,538
Well, you're lucky in one respect.

985
01:26:10,831 --> 01:26:11,999
<i>What's that?</i>

986
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:14,877
I like you, Joel.

987
01:26:16,837 --> 01:26:18,340
Don't you know that?

988
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,392
What time is it?

989
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,144
It's 4:15.

990
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:33,606
I'll find a cab.

991
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,608
Something must have happened.

992
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:38,110
Taxi!

993
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:45,702
Joel, do you like music?

994
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:48,080
This is beautiful equipment.

995
01:26:49,248 --> 01:26:51,208
What do you say, $300...

996
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:53,752
...amps, speakers, the works?

997
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:54,920
It's a bargain, Joel.

998
01:26:55,003 --> 01:26:58,215
If you go downtown anywhere,
it'd cost you double that.

999
01:26:59,342 --> 01:27:01,469
All right! The kid likes music!

1000
01:27:15,442 --> 01:27:17,736
How about some women's outfits?

1001
01:27:18,028 --> 01:27:20,030
You know, something for your mom?

1002
01:27:20,114 --> 01:27:21,615
Should fit her okay.

1003
01:27:21,866 --> 01:27:22,741
Yes.

1004
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:23,951
What?

1005
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:25,452
Yes, I'll buy it!

1006
01:27:25,536 --> 01:27:27,455
I didn't give you a price yet.

1007
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,457
Can we get through this, please?

1008
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:30,542
$125.

1009
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,465
That's it, you have everything.

1010
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:38,842
Wait a minute.

1011
01:27:42,388 --> 01:27:43,764
What about this?

1012
01:27:44,891 --> 01:27:46,142
What's that?

1013
01:27:46,726 --> 01:27:48,728
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.

1014
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:51,939
What have you got left, Joel?

1015
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,065
$40.

1016
01:27:54,234 --> 01:27:57,404
I don't think I can go $40
on the artsy-fartsy thing.

1017
01:27:57,988 --> 01:28:00,324
- What do you think, Vic?
- He's only got $40.

1018
01:28:00,407 --> 01:28:01,992
I only have $40.

1019
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,037
We go $340?

1020
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:07,832
I'll spot you the $300.

1021
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:09,918
You're good for it, right?

1022
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:11,502
Certainly.

1023
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:12,754
I think he is too.

1024
01:28:12,837 --> 01:28:13,755
Here!

1025
01:28:13,838 --> 01:28:14,797
Catch!

1026
01:28:27,353 --> 01:28:28,354
To Joel!

1027
01:28:28,771 --> 01:28:32,441
Here's wishin' you good luck
on your future as a businessman!

1028
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:35,695
Because, God knows,
you're going to need it!

1029
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:18,241
Don't, you'll break it!

1030
01:29:18,324 --> 01:29:21,327
That's good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1031
01:29:22,495 --> 01:29:26,916
I'd put all the Chinese things together,
and the Greek on a separate shelf.

1032
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:29,879
I don't think you should mix centuries.

1033
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:48,023
Mom! Dad! You're home!

1034
01:29:50,692 --> 01:29:52,027
Where were you?

1035
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,528
I was here.

1036
01:29:53,695 --> 01:29:55,530
We called from the airport!

1037
01:29:56,198 --> 01:29:58,367
I must have been out back watering.

1038
01:29:58,534 --> 01:30:00,786
I thought you were coming
home tomorrow.

1039
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:02,705
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.

1040
01:30:03,289 --> 01:30:05,541
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.

1041
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,585
I'm sure I said the 5th.

1042
01:30:08,794 --> 01:30:10,379
Give me a hand with the luggage.

1043
01:30:10,464 --> 01:30:11,840
She said the 6th.

1044
01:30:15,802 --> 01:30:16,720
Joel?

1045
01:30:16,887 --> 01:30:17,930
Yes, Mom?

1046
01:30:19,389 --> 01:30:21,391
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1047
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:27,941
What happened to my egg?

1048
01:30:28,316 --> 01:30:29,692
What do you mean?

1049
01:30:30,485 --> 01:30:32,070
There's a crack in it!

1050
01:30:34,155 --> 01:30:35,448
You're kidding!

1051
01:30:35,823 --> 01:30:37,617
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.

1052
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:40,246
There's a small crack, inside the egg.

1053
01:30:40,579 --> 01:30:41,747
What's wrong?

1054
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:43,207
My egg is ruined.

1055
01:30:43,832 --> 01:30:45,084
What happened?

1056
01:30:46,585 --> 01:30:47,836
I don't know.

1057
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,213
You don't know.

1058
01:30:50,923 --> 01:30:53,051
Mom, maybe it was there before.

1059
01:30:53,343 --> 01:30:55,053
I don't think so, Joel.

1060
01:30:55,262 --> 01:30:57,222
How could you let this happen?

1061
01:31:00,267 --> 01:31:01,393
I'm sorry.

1062
01:31:01,518 --> 01:31:03,770
This is so damned irresponsible of you!

1063
01:31:03,854 --> 01:31:06,566
We'll get another one. Joel will pay for it.

1064
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:09,068
Sure, I'll pay for it.

1065
01:31:10,278 --> 01:31:13,948
Where will you get the money
to pay for something like that?

1066
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:17,159
I'm very disappointed in you.

1067
01:31:24,877 --> 01:31:26,211
She'll be all right.

1068
01:31:26,295 --> 01:31:28,547
Why don't you put in some yard work?

1069
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:31,156
Do you have something to tell me?

1070
01:32:34,618 --> 01:32:35,702
No...

1071
01:32:36,495 --> 01:32:37,996
...I don't think so.

1072
01:32:38,789 --> 01:32:42,001
I just got off the telephone
with Bill Rutherford.

1073
01:32:44,879 --> 01:32:47,632
Apparently, you two had quite a meeting.

1074
01:32:52,637 --> 01:32:54,974
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1075
01:32:57,059 --> 01:32:57,977
What?

1076
01:32:58,477 --> 01:33:00,980
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1077
01:33:02,481 --> 01:33:03,857
His exact words!

1078
01:33:06,068 --> 01:33:07,611
That's unbelievable!

1079
01:33:07,736 --> 01:33:09,531
You're as good as in!

1080
01:33:09,906 --> 01:33:11,616
I knew you could do it!

1081
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:14,494
Haven't I been telling you,
sometimes you have to say:

1082
01:33:14,578 --> 01:33:16,997
"What the heck!" Take some chances.

1083
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,498
You were so right.

1084
01:33:18,748 --> 01:33:20,500
You've made me very proud.

1085
01:33:26,591 --> 01:33:28,259
I was just thinking...

1086
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:32,013
...where we might be ten years from now.

1087
01:33:34,599 --> 01:33:36,476
You know what I think?

1088
01:33:36,643 --> 01:33:39,021
I think we're both going to make it big!

1089
01:33:39,104 --> 01:33:41,440
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!

1090
01:33:45,861 --> 01:33:47,571
Can I ask you something?

1091
01:33:52,452 --> 01:33:54,454
Was our night together...

1092
01:33:57,457 --> 01:33:59,250
...just to set up...

1093
01:34:00,293 --> 01:34:01,753
...Vicki and Guido?

1094
01:34:11,263 --> 01:34:12,264
No.

1095
01:34:13,974 --> 01:34:15,893
You don't believe me, do you?

1096
01:34:18,146 --> 01:34:21,149
<i>My name is Russell Bitterman.</i>
<i>I'm from Wheaton High School.</i>

1097
01:34:21,233 --> 01:34:24,819
<i>Our product is a paper-towel</i>
<i>holder that sells for $8.95.</i>

1098
01:34:25,987 --> 01:34:28,698
<i>We made a profit of $850 last semester.</i>

1099
01:34:35,581 --> 01:34:37,542
I don't want you to get hurt.

1100
01:34:39,835 --> 01:34:43,756
<i>My name is Evonne Williams.</i>
<i>We sell decorative planters for $7.</i>

1101
01:34:45,259 --> 01:34:47,970
<i>We made a profit of $500 last semester.</i>

1102
01:34:51,181 --> 01:34:53,976
Guess we won't see each other for awhile.

1103
01:34:54,518 --> 01:34:55,519
I know.

1104
01:34:57,521 --> 01:34:59,190
Are you going straight home now?

1105
01:34:59,274 --> 01:35:00,733
I don't know. Why?

1106
01:35:01,192 --> 01:35:04,404
It might be nice if we spent
the evening together.

1107
01:35:05,863 --> 01:35:07,490
I'd really like that.

1108
01:35:08,866 --> 01:35:10,827
How much have you got on you?

1109
01:35:12,538 --> 01:35:14,081
How much have I got on me?

1110
01:35:14,164 --> 01:35:15,374
I've got $20.

1111
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:17,209
$20, Lana?

1112
01:35:18,294 --> 01:35:20,462
What are we going to do about this?

1113
01:35:20,546 --> 01:35:23,382
- Can I send it to you?
- Can you send it to me?

1114
01:35:24,258 --> 01:35:26,177
'Cause I don't have that much here.

1115
01:35:26,261 --> 01:35:27,804
How about I write you a check?

1116
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:31,349
Do you think I'd accept a check from you?
What am I, stupid?

1117
01:35:32,559 --> 01:35:34,311
I have a bond at the bank.

1118
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:37,564
<i>My name is Joel Goodson.</i>

1119
01:35:38,565 --> 01:35:40,484
<i>I deal in human fulfillment.</i>

1120
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,071
<i>I grossed over $8,000 in one night.</i>

1121
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:47,992
<i>The time of your life, huh, kid?</i>
