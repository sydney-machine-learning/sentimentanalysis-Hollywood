Hey, Is this surprise visit a one time shot?

41
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,977
If I said, it wouldn't be a surprise.

42
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,188
l'll buy you a beer.

43
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,489

One pastrami on kaiser.
Mayo, no mustard.

86
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:49,803
- What's a pimple on a Polack's ass?
- I need that BLT on rye, Richie.

87
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,431
A brain tumour.

88
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,227
- Richie.
- What's this?

89
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,063
Come on, Richie.

90
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,357
A lesbian with a hard-on.

91
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,528
l'm terrific, right?
You can tell me. I can take it.

92
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,363
Mayo, no mustard.

93
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,574
Can't you see me opening up in L.A?

94
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,453
Direct from Pittsburgh, it's
Richie Blazik, ladies and gentlemen.

95
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,748
L.A?
What's all this talk about L.A?

96
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,834
You've been on the stage two times.

97
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:25,339
I give you two lousy shots and
you're talking about going to L.A.!

98
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:30,302
Come on. What are you, crazy?
Besides, you're too short anyway.

99
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,888
They don't let short people
into Hollywood.

100
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,267
And you're making
the hamburgers too big again.

101
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,520
Make 'em smaller.

102
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,440
l'll give you small.

103
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:48,028
This place is so small you have
to go outside to change your mind.

104
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,995
My turn.

105
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,917
Ring, damn you.
I can't believe he didn't call.

106
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,336
- He'll call.
- Do you think so?

107
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:08,215
- Of course. Why wouldn't he?
- Yeah, why wouldn't he!

108
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,843
Maybe he'll call, I don't know.

109
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,889
When I talked to him, he seemed
funny. Like, ''l'll call you later, babe.''

110
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,058
I don't think he'll call.

111
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,644
- Don't worry, he'll call.
- You really think so?

112
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,814
- Why wouldn't he?
- You're right. He'll call.

113
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,276
- But if he doesn't call, should I call him?
- He'll call.

114
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,988
I love how you always try
to straighten out other people's lives.

115
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,700
Any time you want me
to straighten out yours, let me know.

116
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,997
Personally, I never call.
Because I don't have to.

117
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,417
- But if you want my advice...
- Not really.

118
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,796
- Hi, girls!
- Hi, Richie.

119
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:52,009
- Can I help? A foot massage?
- Get out of here!

120
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,554
- lt's been long since he's had some.
- I bet.

121
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,683
Hi.

122
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,103
Hi.

123
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,524
Do you read lips?

124

What?

125
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,904
I saw you dance last night.

126
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,491
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Hi.

127
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,410
You're Alex.

128
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,079

Really?

131
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,129
l've seen your name
on my pay cheques.

132
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:34,092
What's a dancer doing
working as a welder?

133
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,887
A girl's got to make a living.

134
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,975
- You speak French?
- No. I just like the pictures.

135
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,227
Me too.

136
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,606
- Nick. They need you on ten.
- l'll be right there.

137
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,234
- You read Vogue?
- I used to.

138
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,361
My wife does.
I mean, my ex-wife.

139
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,947
l'm divorced.
We're divorced.

140
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,949
Sorry.

141
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,701
Listen, I got to get to work.

142
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,331
You never know when the boss
is going to be around.

143
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,012
You forgot your thermos.

144
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,210
Hi, Grunt.

145
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,221

When you fill out this application,

177
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:07,462
be sure to list all your years
of dance education.

178
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:12,134
And the number of years
you've spent at each institution.

179
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,748
- I got to go, you guys.
- See you, Alex. Don't get dirty.

180
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,314
- Hello, dancer.
- Hi.

181
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,526
- Want a hand?
- No, thanks.

182
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,085
You know, I have this close,
personal relationship

183
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,212
with the lady
who drives the lunch truck,

184
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,756
and I think I can get her
to make us anything we want.

185
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,342
- As long as it's on the menu.
- l'm not having lunch today.

186
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,427
- How about dinner?
- I can't.

187
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:41,181
I don't have dinner with the boss.
Thanks anyway.

188
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,643
No lunch, no dinner.

189
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,603
How about a snack?

190
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,106
Milk and cookies?

191
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:15,299
I love this dress. lt's exactly
like the picture I showed you.

192
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,636
Thanks so much for making it.

193
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:24,183
Now, more important,
did you go to the repertory?

194
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,853
I meant to. I was going to go
yesterday, but I didn't have time.

195
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,357
- You must make the time, child.
- I know.

196
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,861
Remember the first time
you took me to see them dance?

197
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,696
I have dreams about it.

198
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:42,492
Dreaming is wonderful, but it won't
get you closer to what you want.

199
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,913
But l've saved money, so if they take me,
I can support myself.

200
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,461
But, child, they won't take you
unless you apply and audition.

201
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:58,342
- I know, but sometimes...
- Alexandra, you are 18 years old.

202
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,470
Do it now! Do it!

203
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,805
OK.

204
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,683
You are a good girl.

205
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:36,380
May the Lord be in your heart
and mind that you confess your sins

206
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,299
in the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

207
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,385
Bless me father, for I have sinned.

208
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,346
lt's been two weeks
since my last confession.

209
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,015
l'm doing OK. Sort of.

210
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,645
l've been thinking about sex a lot.

211
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,898
But you can't help
thinking about sex, right?

212
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,776
You probably can...
Help it, I mean.

213
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,114
Also, I told a lie.

214
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,202
I had to...
Well, I didn't have to, but...

215
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,205
All I wanted to do
is to make her happy.

216
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,958
Hanna wanted me
to get the application.

217
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:17,087
I couldn't tell her that I didn't have
the courage to go through with it.

218
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,882
If you had seen all those dancers...
all those people...

219
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,009
There is no way I belong there.

220
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,803
I want to make
something out of my life.

221
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,639
I want to do so much
and sometimes...

222
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:31,560
Sometimes I think
that it's just not going to happen.

223
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,858
Six beautiful girls! All nude!

224
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:38,984
Hi, baby, how are you doing?

225
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:43,155
Five dollars, right this way!
Five dollars! All nude all the time!

226
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,907
All nude, all the time!

227
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,909
Cecil, look at you.

228
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,828
Buy some threads,
l'm running a class act here.

229
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,830
You look like a one-man-slum.

230
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:54,208
All nude, all the time!
Right here, live!

231
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,960
Six beautiful girls!
Right here! Live!

232
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,254
Five dollars!
Right this way!

233
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,841
Five dollars! Live!
Nude! All girls, all the time!

234
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,428
Live! Nude! Right this way!
Right through the door!

235
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,556
Straighten yourself up.
Attract some customers.

236
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,737
Well, well, well, what are these?

237
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,865
They are very cute.
Very, very cute.

238
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,409
Alex!
Come on, give them back.

239
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,203
They are Richie's.

240
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,541
My dad's breathing down my neck.
He says Richie is no good.

241
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,710
If he ain't asked me to marry him
by now, he ain't gonna.

242
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:39,878
No kidding!

243
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,512
Did it take you long to learn
how to dance that way?

244
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,514
About 25 years.

245
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:54,226
- Will you teach me how?
- Yes.

246
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:56,854
- If you teach me how to skate.
- Yes.

247
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,483
Good evening, ladies.

248
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:06,613
Look at that.
$21,321, all leather, push-buttons.

249
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,824
You wanna go for a ride?

250
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,201
Jeanie, are you still fuckin' that cook?

251
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:15,706
Listen. Come see my club.
I just put this new PA system in.

252
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,750
The floor's lit up
where you're going to dance.

253
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,753
I want you to see
what you're going to call home.

254
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,966
Did you know that the smallest penis
ever measured was 1.1 inches?

255
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,594
You are some pair of cunts,
you know that?

256
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,187
I can't believe l'm working out
with this hangover.

257
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,940
Wait. l've lost my keys.
I can't believe this.

258
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,319
- Whoo!
- Hank! You moron!

259
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,613
Come on, let's go work out.

260
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,712
# I love rock 'n' roll

261
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:06,757
# So put another dime
In the jukebox, baby

262
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,009
# I love rock 'n' roll

263
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,095
# So come and take your time
And dance with me... #

264
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,598
He didn't call.

265
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,808
He'll call.

266
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,770
I don't think so, Alex.

267
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:22,105
He'll call, Tina.

268
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:27,402
- I don't know.
- Just look. Just call the man.

269
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,029
Say, ''Hey, baby,
what's happening?''

270
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:33,992
Your life's going to be
over before you make up your mind.

271
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,912
Just get up and call the dude.

272
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,373
Yeah? You really think so?

273
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,376
God, l'm glad I ain't no honky.

274
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,379
# Singing I love rock 'n' roll

275
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,965
# Put another dime
In the jukebox, baby

276
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,342
# I love rock 'n' roll

277
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,470
# So come and take your time
And dance with me #

278
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,063
# Watch me now

279
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,065
# Feel the groove

280
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,402
# lnto something
Gonna make you move

281
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,871
# Here we come

282
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,664
# On the run

283
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,374
# Don't know what

284
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,418
# We're running from

285
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,386
# Day or night

286
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,388
# Black or white

287
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,600
# Dance or sing
You gotta do your thing

288
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,810
# You gotta do your thing #

289
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,982
You girls eat like pigs.

290
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,650
What happened to the diet?

291
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:16,321
- I didn't eat anything yesterday.
- We'll work it off at the rink.

292
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,743
Is Richie going to be there?
Now there's a real winner.

293
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,121
No, we're gonna work.

294
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,292
- She thinks she'll be on the ice show.
- What's wrong with that?

295
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,628
- l'd make a lot of money.
- You're costing me a lot of money.

296
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,882
l'd just like to try it again, Daddy.

297
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,342
She's really good.
You ought to see her.

298
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,637
- She'll fall on her ass.
- She's got a tough ass.

299
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,182
Yeah, l've got a tough ass.

300
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,559
lt's not her ass l'm worried about.

301
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,191
Where are you?

302
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,650
Come here.

303
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:00,741
Here we go.

304
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,869
No, don't.

305
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,918
- You look great.
- Don't stop.

306
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,296
Do it again!
Do it again!

307
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,340
Shit, I can't do this.

308
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,428
No, go do your turn.

309
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,765
Do you know the triple one?

310
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,233
Hi. l'm Richie Blazik.

311
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,445
Hi. l'm Richie Blazik. Did you hear
about the Polack bank robber?

312
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:40,489
He tied up the safe, blew the guard.

313
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,324
Tied up the safe,
blew the guard.

314
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,868
Tied up the safe
and blew the guard.

315
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,745
Hey, Kid! Come here.

316
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:48,789
Come here!

317
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,211
- What's the matter?
- l'm nervous, Jake.

318
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,635
Now you ain't nervous anymore.

319
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,053
Now you're pissed off.

320
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,182
Good luck, baby.

321
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,222
Hi. How are you doing?

322
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,224
l'm Richie Blazik.

323
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:58,817
Did you hear about
the Polack bank robber?

324
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,321
He tied up the safe
and blew the guard.

325
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:07,951
So, the lady says to the waiter,

326
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:11,038
''Excuse me, sir,
do you have frogs legs?''

327
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,583
And the waiter says,
''No, that's just the way I walk.''

328
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,801
You want to talk about boogers?
I know a lot about them.

329
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:28,222
How about boogers?
Sports for fifty?

330
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,017
What's a pimple
on a Polack's ass?

331
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,937
A brain tumour.

332
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:41,485
Take a walk.
Bring on the bimbos.

333
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:44,738
Come on, guys.
Could you give me a break?

334
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,866
Look, l'm just a cook.
l'm just a cook, all right?

335
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,787
This is my big chance,
so if you screw it up for me,

336
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,374
l'm going to put cockroaches
in your hamburgers, you got it?

337
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,712
Miracles do happen, I guess.

338
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,882
It took the Steelers 40 years
to win a championship, didn't it?

339
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,176
Steelers!

340
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:15,435
I feel like Franco Harris when he made
the lmmaculate Reception.

341
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,104
It was amazing!

342
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,692
Did you hear about the Polack,
who locked his keys in the car,

343
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,778
and he used a coat hanger
to get his family out?

344
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,700
Did you hear about the Polack
who died drinking milk?

345
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,743
The cow fell on him.

346
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,708
A Polish terrorist
tried to blow up a car

347
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,794
and he burned his lips
on the exhaust pipe.

348
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:51,722
You guys have been real nice.
l've gotta go and cook the hamburgers.

349
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:53,682
No roaches, I promise.

350
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,436
So let me bring out our next act.

351
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:02,566
Direct from Mawby's.
lt's Tina Tech, ladies and gentlemen!

352
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,453
One, two, three, four!

353
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:25,464
# l'm going on a manhunt

354
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,549
# Turn it around

355
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:31,428
# Women have been hunted
Now we're hunting around

356
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,055
# Manhunt

357
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,848
# We all got the need

358
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:42,523
# The one that's been waiting
Has taken the lead

359
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,198
# Ruby lips in the mirror

360
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,701
# Black heels on the floor

361
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,081
# Perfume to draw him nearer

362
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,125
# A dress he can't ignore

363
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:06,255
# I know he'll be at the party tonight

364
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:10,342
# He'll be looking so fine

365
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,554
# He'll be surprised
When I walk up and say

366
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,893
# Man, I want to make you
Glad you're alive

367
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:22,855
# l'm going on a manhunt

368
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,648
# Turn it around

369
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:28,402
# Women have been hunting
Now we're hunting around

370
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,362
# Manhunt

371
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,239
# We all got the need

372
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:37,077
# The one who's been waiting
Has taken the lead

373
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,580
# l'm going on a manhunt

374
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:46,336
# l'm out for the kill #

375
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,489
Alex, sit down here a minute.

376
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:17,117
Cecil, this is a nice ass.

377
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:18,785
Soft...

378
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,080
Round. Snug...

379
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,416
Hey, she likes it!

380
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,755
Bimbo! Whore!

381
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,677
Fuck off!

382
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,739
Night, kids.

383
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,116
- Night.
- Night, Jake.

384
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:03,288
Hey, Richie, no more
jokes about cockroaches, huh?

385
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,976
You know, one of these days
I want to be like...

386
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,270
Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy,
Steve Martin.

387
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:29,773
- Until that day comes...
- You'll just steal all their material.

388
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,735
- Hey, Alex.
- Let me go.

389
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:36,071
- What are you doing?
- Nothing to fight about.

390
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:38,574
- We're going to Cecil's.
- Let me go!

391
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:41,702
Drink a little wine.
Do a little weed. You and me.

392
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,247
How about Cecil?
You like Cecil?

393
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,875
- Get off of me!
- All three of us, real friendly.

394
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,877
Why don't you leave her
the fuck alone!

395
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,129
The comedian is
going to be a hero!

396
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,553
Cecil, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

397
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,598
Let her go, Johnny.

398
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,893
What are you doing here, Nick?
Slumming?

399
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,770
This ain't your
neighbourhood no more.

400
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:18,155
I didn't mean nothing.
I just got pissed off.

401
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,534
- Send me a bill, kid.
- Let me see.

402
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,828
- Is it bleeding? Oh, Jesus!
- Yeah.

403
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,580
Come on.

404
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,375
Here's your hat.

405
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:33,921
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

406
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,883
- Are you sure?
- l'm OK. lt'll look good on stage.

407
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:44,556
- lt's going to be fine.
- Are you sure?

408
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:50,062
- Sure you're going to be OK?
- Yeah, fine.

409
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:59,404
Listen, what can I say?
Thanks a lot.

410
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,115
l'll give you a lift home.

411
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:07,287
lt's OK. l've got a ride.
Thanks anyway.

412
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,618
- What's his name?
- Grunt.

413
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,245
- Grunt?
- Yeah.

414
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,625
I can see that I don't have to
worry about you.

415
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,919
What was he
before he became a dog?

416
00:38:56,003 --> 00:39:00,048
Well, he gets upset when people
he doesn't know follow me home.

417
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:02,259
Come on, Grant. This is the
man that feeds you.

418
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,178
Tell you what...

419
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:08,682
Tell him l'll bring him a doggy bag
if you'll have dinner with me.

420
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:12,853
Nick, I told you I don't think it's a
good idea to go out with the boss.

421
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:17,065
OK. Have it your way.

422
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,277
You're fired.
l'll pick you up tomorrow at eight.

423
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,176
How long does this thing last?

424
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:49,389
lt's cold in here.

425
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:54,728
- How's the nose?
- lt's broken.

426
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,689
Broke mine three times.

427
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:01,485
It was big in the '50s, wasn't it?
Busting noses?

428
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,446
'60s.

429
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:46,613
Think she can beat her?

430
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,117
'Miss Szabo.'

431
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,077
You're going to do great.

432
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:15,517
# Gloria

433
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,020
# You're always on the run now

434
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,481
# Running after somebody... #

435
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:24,776
Go Jeanie! Come on!

436
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,947
# I think you've got to slow down

437
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,159
# Before you start to blow it

438
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:35,537
# I think you're heading for a breakdown

439
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:39,208
# So be careful not to show it... #

440
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:43,128
Oh... look at that one.

441
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,513
There you were 20 years ago,
sweetheart.

442
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,312
There we go. Come on!

443
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,107
# If everybody wants you

444
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:08,111
# Why isn't anybody calling?

445
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:11,240
# You don't have to answer... #

446
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:14,785
Come on, Jeanie!

447
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:20,624
# Calling Gloria

448
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,792
# Gloria

449
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,462
# I think they got the number

450
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:29,341
# I think they got the alias

451
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:32,636
# That you've been living under

452
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,265
# But you really don't remember

453
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,685
# Was it something that they said?

454
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:43,355
# All the voices in your head

455
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:49,319
# Calling Gloria... #

456
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,538
Get up, Jeanie!

457
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:28,901
lt's going to be OK.

458
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:32,946
All that time and practice.
What a waste.

459
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,658
- Goddamn waste of time.
- Come on, It was not.

460
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,410
It wasn't.

461
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,914
You went out there, didn't you?

462
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,044
At least you had the guts to try.

463
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:49,087
How are you doing, sport?

464
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,181
l'm sorry, Daddy.

465
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:06,230
I love you more than l've ever
loved anything in my whole life.

466
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:12,110
What the hell.
You bounced pretty good.

467
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:27,251
She practised for two years.

468
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:31,463
- She'll do better next time.
- There won't be any next time.
