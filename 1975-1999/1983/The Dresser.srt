00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,796
This is the BBC Home Service.

2
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,794
Here is the news,
and this is Gordon Hill reading it.

3
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,794
The king and queen accompanied by
the prime minister, Winston Churchill...

4
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,715
...today visited the East End of London
to inspect the recent bomb damage.

5
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,509
Yesterday evening, enemy air raids
over several provincial cities...

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,070
...were reported to have caused
severe damage in places.

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,870
President Roosevelt has again spok en
of U.S. Cooperation with Britain.

8
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,715
He is to address both houses
of Congress tomorrow.

9
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,872
The meat ration is to be reduced.

10
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,912
I took by the throat
the circumcised dog.

11
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,471
And smote him, thus.

12
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,956
O bloody period!

13
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,830
All that's spoken is marr'd.

14
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,596
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee.

15
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,433
No way but this.

16
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,838
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

17
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,199
This did I fear,
but thought he had no weapon.

18
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,590
O Spartan dog.

19
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,232
More fell than anguish,
hunger or the sea!

20
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,231
For God's sake, Horace!

21
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,756
- Quicker and louder!
- And...

22
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,074
And to the state
this heavy act with heavy heart relate.

23
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,670
Stand by for curtain.

24
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,916
- Curtain down!
- Horace!

25
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,992
When Othello is dead,
the play is over.

26
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,392
Say what you have to say with speed
and put the audience out of its misery!

27
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,870
And Oxenby, if you don't
keep downstage of me...

28
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,554
...I'll have you nailed
to the orchestra pit!

29
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,349
Lago is a supporting part.
Watch it!

30
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,119
Curtain going up!

31
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,430
Mind you, he's not a bad lago.

32
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,673
But now I know how Mr. Churchill
will feel when he faces Joseph Stalin.

33
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,718
Stand by for your curtain call, Sir.

34
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,678
And Mr. Godstone, less makeup,
if you please!

35
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,391
You're playing the Duke of Venice,
not the Queen of the May!

36
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,315
Your call, Sir.

37
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,878
Frank, be more careful with your sword
during the Cyprus scene.

38
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,554
I have no wish
to be circumcised at my age.

39
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,119
Sorry, old boy.

40
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,398
Let them know you're coming.
Let them know you're coming!

41
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,556
- Excuse me.
- Watch that scene tonight.

42
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,952
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

43
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,271
...thank you for your
generosity of spirit.

44
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,955
Next week we shall be appearing...

45
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,473
At the Alhambra, Bradford.

46
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,632
...at the Alhambra Theatre, Bradford.

47
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,952
On behalf of my company...

48
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,513
...my lady wife and myself...

49
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,715
...I humbly thank you.

50
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,277
I had my dream again
last night, Norman.

51
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,908
Never mind, tomorrow's Sunday.

52
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,676
Unseen hands...

53
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,035
...driving wooden stakes...

54
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,156
...into my feet.

55
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,596
I can't move.

56
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,758
It'll be better next week.

57
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,718
Just wait till you get
on that train tomorrow.

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,309
- What time's the call?
- 9:00, Sir.

59
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,597
Oh, why so early?

60
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,671
Why 9:00?

61
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,276
Because this little piggy says so.

62
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,675
We've got three minutes!

63
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,669
Norman! Fancy seeing you, eh?
I've never seen York so cloudy.

64
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,876
I'm playing Scarborough next week...

65
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,033
...and I'm not fixed for Christmas,
so if you hear of anything...

66
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,555
Guard! Don't blow your whistle.
I beg you. The actors are coming.

67
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,438
One minute.

68
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,953
Please wait, driver,
they're very elderly actors.

69
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,112
They're playing Shakespeare
at the Alhambra Theatre.

70
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,989
So it's all in a good cause.
You won't go without us, will you?

71
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,149
Sod off!

72
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,831
Stop...

73
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,638
...that...

74
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,872
...train!

75
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,711
Hey! You just can't stop a train!
It's not allowed!

76
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,475
Don't you know there's a war on?
It's against regulations!

77
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,234
You just can't stop a train!

78
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,715
It's all right. It's all right.

79
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,031
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

80
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,157
Go back to sleep.

81
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,748
Thank you for watching over me,
but don't worry too much.

82
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,875
I have this feeling I may do
something violent.

83
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,638
- What's the play tomorrow night?
- King Lear.

84
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,432
Then I shall wake
with the storm clouds in my head.

85
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,511
These boom lights are for me.

86
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,875
- And me only.
- All right.

87
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,271
They follow me wherever I go.

88
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,996
Thank you.

89
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,112
It's all right, Sir, I'm here.
It's Norman.

90
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,714
Kill the followspot.

91
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,836
Look out, there!

92
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,072
Get back! Keep back there!

93
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,909
Keep away! Get out of the way!
Get back!

94
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,437
Come along. This is no place for you.
Come on.

95
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,871
If I may intrude?

96
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,712
For the theatre.

97
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,431
I trust you will find comfort there.

98
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,955
Excuse me, but do you have
any Brown & Polson's corn flour?

99
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,192
I'm at the Alhambra. They use it
instead of face powder.

100
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,432
I could arrange two complimentaries
for any performance...

101
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,160
...if you'll just let me
have one tiny packet.

102
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,639
Face powder?

103
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,791
You'll be lucky, miss.

104
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,913
God help the man
who tries to stop me!

105
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,470
How much further
do you want me to go?!

106
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,393
Shouldn't we be getting to the theatre?

107
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,673
Come on, love, you'll catch your death.
Put your clothes on like a good boy.

108
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,355
Thank you, my dear,
but Norman usually looks after me.

109
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,353
I'm Norman. I'm his dresser.

110
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,239
Take good care of him, love.

111
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,314
I were first took to see you
when I were but a lass.

112
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,516
I'm sorry you're poorly.

113
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,911
You were lovely
in The Corsican Brothers.

114
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,912
What are we going to do, Norman?
There'll be an audience in tonight...

115
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,958
...hoping to see him as King Lear.
What will we do?

116
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,475
Don't upset yourself, for a start.

117
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,350
I've never made this sort of decision
before. Any sort of decision before.

118
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,318
I'm glad I telephoned Madge.
She'll know what to do.

119
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,913
Madge will know what to do.

120
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,437
Madge will be ever so sensible.
Of course, stage managers have to be.

121
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,071
I should have made him rest.

122
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,755
The doctor said he'd come
to his rope's end and found it frayed.

123
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,754
Doctors! Just imagine trying to tell
a doctor what Sir's been through:

124
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,038
"You see, doctor, he's been recruiting
actors for his Shakespearean company.

125
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,589
But all the able-bodied ones
are in uniform...

126
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,638
...and the theatres are bombed
as soon as you book them.

127
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,395
Not to mention the trouble this week
with Mr. Davenport Scott."

128
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,872
Doctor'd have his hypodermic rampant
before you could say As You Lik e It.

129
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,349
What's the latest
with Mr. Davenport Scott?

130
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,798
If you don't mind, I'd rather not
discuss Davenport Scott with a lady.

131
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,396
I'll tell Madge all about it
when she comes in.

132
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,909
Now, this won't hurt.

133
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,277
It's just to make you sleep.
You want to sleep, don't you?

134
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,195
Sleep? Sleep?!
"Glamis hath murdered sleep!

135
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,911
And therefore Cawdor
shall sleep no more!

136
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,517
Macbeth shall sleep no more!"

137
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,230
Any further developments?

138
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,153
We'd better see the manager.
Come with me.

139
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,949
Please, Your Ladyship,
let's not rush things.

140
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,908
There's no alternative.
I'll be in my room.

141
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,479
- Your Ladyship...
- Madge is right. He's in hospital.

142
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,837
We can't play King Lear with no king!
We must make a decision.

143
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,675
Forgive me, it's not a decision we
must make. It's the right decision.

144
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,389
I had a friend, before one's face
was lined, as the saying goes...

145
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,155
...in a very low state he was.
Ever so fragile. A pain to be with.

146
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,756
Someone close to him, his mother
I believe, though never proved...

147
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,229
...understandably upset,
made a decision.

148
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,520
"A little rest," she said, "among those
similarly 'off-centre' in Colwyn Bay."

149
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,636
Never a good date,
not in February...

150
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,429
...wrapped in a grey rug, gazing
at a grey sea. Talk about bleak!

151
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,912
Mother made a decision, but it was
wrong. My friend never acted again.

152
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,310
We have to face the facts!

153
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,074
I've never done that,
and I shouldn't start now.

154
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,312
I just like things to be lovely.
No pain, that's my motto.

155
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,278
- Things aren't lovely.
- They aren't if you face facts.

156
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,319
It's facing the company I worry about.
What about them and the customers?

157
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,996
It's no good talking about struggle and
survival if you cancel the performance.

158
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,878
- It's a disease.
- What is?

159
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,109
Hopefulness.

160
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,078
I think we should discuss this
in private.

161
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,516
- Norman! Your Ladyship!
- Your Ladyship!

162
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,275
I asked him, joking like, if he
had been in a fight. He said not.

163
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,035
I thought he wanted his key
but he just sat down there.

164
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,392
- Telephone the hospital.
- Do not telephone the hospital!

165
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,838
Get me to my room. To my room.
I must don my robes!

166
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,309
- What are we to do?
- Charles, help her.

167
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,436
I shan't be a tick.

168
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,156
Well, I don't know exactly,
Mr. Mulberry.

169
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,676
It'll mean giving back
an awful lot of money.

170
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,870
We're full tonight
and Wednesday for Lear.

171
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,679
Richard III is looking healthy.

172
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,400
Merchant of Venice, cosy.

173
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,949
As You Lik e It is cool.

174
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,710
No, he hasn't got an understudy.

175
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,917
Mr. Bottomley!
Hold hard, Mr. Bottomley!

176
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,197
King Richard's himself again!

177
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,875
- Bonzo, why are you here?
- My name is on the door.

178
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,999
- Did the doctor say you could leave?
- I discharged myself.

179
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,958
- Cancel the performance.
- I can't.

180
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,111
Mustn't. Won't!

181
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,239
- Then take the consequences!
- When have I not?

182
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,028
How is he?

183
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,270
- Norman! I want you by me!
- Yes, Sir.

184
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,238
- Don't leave my side, now.
- Yes, Sir.

185
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,197
- I shall want help.
- Yes, Sir.

186
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,519
Madge, dear.

187
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,630
You speak to him.
He doesn't hear a word I say.

188
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,588
- You look exhausted.
- That's what I call tact!

189
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,318
- Are you able to go on tonight?
- He wouldn't be here if he wasn't.

190
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,359
- How long have you been with me?
- Longer than anyone else.

191
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,990
- How long?
- Twenty years. Nearly 20 years.

192
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,199
- Have I ever missed a performance?
- No, but then you've never been ill.

193
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,832
I want what's best for you.

194
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,630
What's best for Sir is
that he's allowed to get ready!

195
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,951
Ready. Yes, yes, I must get ready.

196
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,948
Ready for what?

197
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,398
- Shouldn't you be getting ready too?
- I can't bear to see him like that.

198
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,872
Then best leave us. I've had experience
with these things. I know what to do.

199
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,077
Imagine waking to that
night after night!

200
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,434
My dear, is he all right?

201
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,275
We heard dreadful rumours. Surely
the performance is not cancelled.

202
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,319
No, no, no, he's just a little tired,
that's all.

203
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,597
Aren't we all, dear? Aren't we all?

204
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,349
Right. Shall we begin
at the beginning?

205
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,079
Good evening, Sir.

206
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,077
Are we going to sulk all evening or
are we going to speak to our servants?

207
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,678
I do wish you'd stop crying, Sir.

208
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,354
Shall we play I Spy?

209
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,992
Now, I spy with my little eye
something beginning with A.

210
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,549
Now, I know you won't guess,
so I'll tell you.

211
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,190
A is for "actor."
And actors have to work.

212
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,318
Actors have to put on makeup
and change their frocks...

213
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,710
...and then, of course,
actors have to act!

214
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,599
"Zounds, madam, where dost thou
get this knowledge?"

215
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,275
"From a baboon that wandered wild
in Eden," or words to that effect.

216
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,557
I have never known a kettle
take so long to boil.

217
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,669
Tell you what, have a little brandy.
Break the rules. Have a nip.

218
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,353
"A little brandy won't harm."

219
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,592
As the surgeon said
to the undertaker's widow.

220
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,993
There's under an hour to go.
You usually want longer.

221
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,799
Shall we make a start?

222
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,833
Yes, it's me. Norman.
The one with the soulful eyes.

223
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,471
I've saved my rations for you.
I don't mind going without.

224
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,711
Now, come along, Sir, drink up!
It's tea, not rat poison.

225
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,749
There. Now, that's better, isn't it?
Isn't it?

226
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,115
Would you like a bikkie?

227
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,439
I saved one from
the mayor's reception in Bridlington.

228
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,789
"Why don't you have one, Norman?"
Thanks very much, I will.

229
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,392
If you don't mind my saying so...

230
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,632
...there seems little point
in leaving the hospital...

231
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,237
...and then coming to sit here like
Niobe prior to being turned into stone.

232
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,153
So shall we make an effort?

233
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,035
Oh, come here, let me.
That's what I'm here for.

234
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,712
There, there. There, there.
There, there, I know how it feels.

235
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,950
I had a friend, worse than you, he was.

236
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,634
All they wanted to do with him
was put him away.

237
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,872
And no one wants to go through that,
or so my friend said.

238
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,837
They'll send you to Colwyn Bay...

239
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,276
...and you know you never do
any business in Colwyn Bay.

240
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,639
Guess. Guess what got my friend well?

241
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,633
Now, sounds silly, this.

242
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,597
An offer of work.

243
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,115
A telegram. Yes, fancy, a telegram.

244
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,155
"Can you understudy Scrubby?
Outward Bound. Start Monday."

245
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,039
He discharged himself just like you,
my friend did...

246
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,749
...went to London, found digs in Brixton
and never looked back.

247
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,388
What do you make of that?
An offer of work.

248
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,348
It meant somebody thought of him,
and that's ever such a comfort.

249
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,512
So here's something to cheer you up.

250
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,593
Going to be a full house tonight.

251
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,912
All those people thinking of you
and wanting you to act.

252
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,999
Really?

253
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,151
A full house?

254
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,958
Shall we make a start?

255
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,909
What play is tonight?

256
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,877
- King Lear, Sir.
- Impossible!

257
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,031
Thank you. That's nice, isn't it?

258
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,591
People paying good money to see you
and you say impossible. Very nice!

259
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,479
I don't want to be seen.

260
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,234
That's difficult
when you're playing King Lear.

261
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,152
I don't want to see Her Ladyship.

262
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,278
That's even more difficult
since she's playing Cordelia.

263
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,352
You saw her a moment ago.
You were alone together.

264
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,238
Were we?

265
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,350
- What's the play tonight?
- King Lear, Sir.

266
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,355
I started my autobiography today.

267
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,877
But I can't find a good catchy title.

268
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,480
I think My Life a little plain,
don't you?

269
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,951
I thought I had written today.

270
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,351
Evidently not.

271
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,352
I can't be Lear again.

272
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,235
Shall we begin our makeup?

273
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,630
Where's my hat?!

274
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,159
I'm getting out of here! I'm not staying
in this place a moment longer!

275
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,311
I'm surrounded by vipers!

276
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,869
Betrayal on every side!

277
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,031
I'm being crushed!

278
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,953
The lifeblood is draining from me.

279
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,237
The load is too great!

280
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,354
Norman, if you have any regard
for me, don't listen to him!

281
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,509
Who?

282
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,989
More, more, more!

283
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,237
I can't give anymore!

284
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,676
I have nothing more to give!

285
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,516
I want a tranquil senility!
I'm a grown man!

286
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,037
I don't want to go on painting my face
night after night...

287
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,794
...wearing clothes
that are not my own.

288
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,555
This is my work, my life's work!
I'm an actor!

289
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,114
Who cares if I go out there tonight
or any other night and shorten my life?

290
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,277
I had a friend once said:

291
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,319
"Norman, I don't care if there are
only three people out front.

292
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,359
Or if the audience laughs when they
shouldn't or don't when they should.

293
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,718
Just one person is certain to know
and understand, and I act for him."

294
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,030
That's what my friend said.

295
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,637
I can't move that
which cannot be moved.

296
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,630
- I want to see him.
- I'd rather you didn't.

297
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,156
It's my responsibility to take
the curtain up. There isn't time.

298
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,676
Things have reached a delicate stage.
I don't want him disturbed.

299
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,559
- What's all that whispering?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

300
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,711
- Has he begun his makeup yet?
- Not yet.

301
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,077
Do you know how late it is?
They'll be calling the half soon.

302
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,435
I know how late it is!

303
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,273
Then on your head be it!

304
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,799
- Who was that?
- Oh, just a minion minioning.

305
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,396
Oh, look, a dressing gown!

306
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,076
Now, shall we put it on
and keep ourselves warm?

307
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,232
There, now, doesn't that feel better?

308
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,837
You're back here in the theatre,
safe and sound, where you belong.

309
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,471
- And a full house. Lovely.
- Really? A full house?

310
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,313
They'll be standing in the gods!

311
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,834
Do you know they've bombed
the Grand Theatre, Plymouth?

312
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,471
- And much else of the city besides.
- I made my debut at the Grand Theatre.

313
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,631
They weren't to know.

314
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,116
I shouldn't have come out this spring
but I had no choice.

315
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,349
- He made me.
- Who?

316
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,239
- I should've rested.
- I had a friend ordered to rest.

317
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,994
He obeyed. That was the end of him.
He was so ill.

318
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,156
Nearly became a Catholic.
Not unlike Mr. Davenport Scott.

319
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,471
- What news of Davenport?
- They're keeping him in the cells.

320
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,110
Advise his captors
he is to be released immediately!

321
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,669
The police have opposed bail.

322
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,709
- How then do we dispose our forces?
- Mr. Thornton stands by to play Fool.

323
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,589
- And who as Oswald?
- Mr. Brown, I'm afraid.

324
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,718
That leaves me a knight short for
"Reason not the need."

325
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,314
Well, 98 short if you take
the text as gospel.

326
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,119
So one more or less shouldn't
be too upsetting.

327
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,990
Thornton, toothless as Fool.

328
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,118
Brown, lisping as Oswald.

329
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,352
Oxenby, limping as Edmund.

330
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,397
What have I come to?

331
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,875
I've never had a company
like this one.

332
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,319
I have been reduced to old men,
cripples and nancy-boys!

333
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,950
Herr Hitler has made it difficult
for Shakespearean companies.

334
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,588
It'll be a chapter in the book, Sir.

335
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,558
I hate to mention this,
but we're short for the storm.

336
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,439
We have no one
to operate the wind machine.

337
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,116
- Not if Mr. Thornton is to play Fool.
- I must have the storm at full strength.

338
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,909
- What about Oxenby?
- Not the most amenable of gentlemen.

339
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,958
Send him to me just after the half.

340
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,953
I'll have a word with him.

341
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,556
- I'd better talk to Thornton too.
- You see?

342
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,954
You're where you belong, doing what
you know best. You're yourself again.

343
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,033
Start making up. I'll tell them to see
you. I've cleaned the wig and beard.

344
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,998
I shan't be a minute.

345
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,756
What now, you Scotch-arsed Zulu?

346
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,559
It's cancelled.
Please say it's cancelled.

347
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,554
He wants to see you in the makeup
and costume of Fool after the half.

348
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,632
Oh, my God. Are you sure
he's well enough to go on?

349
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,677
He seemed quite deranged.

350
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,839
Sir, deranged? Never.
See you at the half, Geoffrey.

351
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,429
I'm not exaggerating.

352
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,912
So I said to Davenport Scott,
"You really must behave.

353
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,789
You have a position to uphold."

354
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,236
Mr. Oxenby, Sir would like to see you
just after the half.

355
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,429
If he wants me any further
downstage...

356
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,433
...I shall end up
at the back of the stalls.

357
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,793
Mr. Brown, you're playing Oswald.
You know the lines?

358
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,838
Yes, I do, so long as
he doesn't hiss at me.

359
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,196
- I get very quivery when he hisses.
- And we don't want that, do we?

360
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,238
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.
So Davenport Scott said to me...

361
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,439
- Do you mind shutting up?!
- Really!

362
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,599
- Norman.
- 'Tis I.

363
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,034
- How is he?
- Who?

364
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,713
Everyone saw and heard him.

365
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,553
My Uncle Percy raved like that.
He's now in a home.

366
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,712
- I hope you visit him often.
- Norman.

367
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,997
- Is he fit enough to play King Lear?
- Just wait and see.

368
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,517
He's never been in such fine fettle.
He'll make history tonight as Lear.

369
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,717
Uncle Percy.

370
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,995
All's well. I've spoken to the actors.

371
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,915
Oh, no, Sir! No!

372
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,149
Not Othello!

373
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,031
The lines are fouled.

374
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,749
Instruct the puppeteer
to renew the strings.

375
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,909
I'd give anything to see the play.
You blacked-up, and Cordelia saying:

376
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,640
"You've begot me, bred me, loved me."

377
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,199
"Well, you see, ducky...

378
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,354
...this King Lear, he been about a bit."

379
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,919
We used to play a game called Risqué.

380
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,277
You had to turn the line
to get a double entendre.

381
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,796
The best I ever heard was from
a character man called Berriton.

382
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,476
You know the line, "What,
fifty of my followers at a clap?

383
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,792
- Within a fortnight?"
- Yes, I know the line and the story.

384
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,112
One day, on a train call
from Aberdeen to Liverpool...

385
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,317
...a journey I recommend
as punishment for deserters...

386
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,270
...Berriton came out with, "What,
fifty of my followers with the clap?

387
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,398
Within a fortnight?"

388
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,996
"With the clap,
within a fortnight."

389
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,710
"Within a fortnight."

390
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,470
Another blank page.

391
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,993
It's only for the storm scene, Arthur.
When Sir leans forward, you lean back.

392
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,915
When he leans back, you lean forward.
That way he's always balanced.

393
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,709
- Got it.
- Now do it.

394
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,471
When he's forward, I'm back.

395
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,428
When he's back, I'm forward.

396
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,790
Good.

397
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,752
Now, Beryl, you're not to forget
the triple crown.

398
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,514
Don't worry. I'll do it tonight.

399
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,032
- Who?
- Irene. I've come for the triple crown.

400
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,634
Enter!

401
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,151
- Good evening, my child.
- Good evening, Sir.

402
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,709
- All well?
- Thank you, Sir.

403
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,075
- You've come for the triple crown?
- Yes.

404
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,710
Polish it well. I like it gleaming.

405
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,598
Yes, Sir.

406
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,752
Here it is, my child.

407
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,759
Pretty young thing, aren't you?

408
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,559
Thank you, Sir.

409
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,115
Sir, it's time to age.

410
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,629
They're all the same colour.

411
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,593
Which stick do I use?

412
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,917
I can't see the colours.

413
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,636
You start with the eyebrows, Sir.

414
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,628
Eyebrows?

415
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,997
You soap the eyebrows.

416
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,953
Lovely. Now number five.

417
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,117
"Just the mask," you always say.

418
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,074
Yes, leave clean the upper lip
and chin for the moustache and beard.

419
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,790
Not too high on the forehead.

420
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,229
There. Easy as falling off
a tightrope.

421
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,077
Lake for the lines.

422
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,232
There was a time...

423
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,675
...when I painted in all the lines.

424
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,630
Now I merely deepen
what is already there.

425
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,917
- Half an hour, please, Sir.
- Thank you.

426
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,518
- I shall "trouser-Ioony" tonight.
- Trouser-Ioony, Mr. Carrington?

427
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,116
In the pub, dear boy, before
the audience are off their arses!

428
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,511
Shakespeare is not renowned
for his brevity.

429
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,993
The only hope of a drink
after the show is to trouser-Ioony.

430
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,750
I shall look like this in my coffin.

431
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,629
And a broad straight line of number 20
down the nose.

432
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,315
"Gives strength," you say.

433
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,278
- Did you find any Brown & Polson?
- No. I'm still looking.

434
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,591
We have enough for this tour.

435
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,912
Now we mix the white varnish...

436
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,914
...with a little surgical spirit.
- I know how to stick on a beard!

437
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,674
I've been a depicter
for over 40 years...

438
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,311
...and steered my own course
for over 30!

439
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,040
You overstep the mark, my boy!
Don't get above yourself!

440
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,434
I shall want a rest
after the storm scene.

441
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,115
There's no need to tell me. I know.

442
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,311
Towel! Towel, towel, towel!

443
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,594
Something's missing.
What's missing?

444
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,914
I don't want to get above myself, Sir,
but what about the wig?

445
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,676
It's hot, unbearably hot.
I'm going to faint.

446
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,638
Have a little nip, Sir.
It won't harm you.

447
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,839
Oh, Sir, we mustn't give up now.
Let's highlight our lines, Sir.

448
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,469
Imagine bombing
the Grand Theatre, Plymouth.

449
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,032
Barbarians.

450
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,396
I shall give them a good one tonight.

451
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,512
- What now?
- How is he?

452
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,513
- Back to normal.
- I wanna see him with my own eyes.

453
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,389
- He's not to be disturbed.
- And what about the understudies?

454
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,757
- Everything's in hand.
- Will he be ready on time?

455
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,353
- Will he be well enough?
- Yes!

456
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,636
Norman!

457
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,357
All this clitter-clatter,
chitter-chatter!

458
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,112
- How does the play begin?
- Which?

459
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,397
Tonight's, tonight's!
I can't remember the first line.

460
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,677
- "Attend the lords of France..."
- You take from my head!

461
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,673
You must keep silent
when I'm dressing!

462
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,558
I have work to do! Work!

463
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,871
Hard bloody labour!
I have to carry the world tonight!

464
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,874
The whole bloody universe!
I can't remember the first line!

465
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,477
- I'll take you through it.
- No one takes you through it!

466
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,519
You are put through it
night after night!

467
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,275
And I haven't the strength!

468
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,437
Well, you're a fine one, I must say.
You, of all people.

469
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,273
You disappoint me,
if you don't mind my saying so.

470
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,151
You always say, "Self-pity is the most
unattractive quality on-stage or off.

471
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,312
Struggle and survival is all that
matters," you say.

472
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,552
"Struggle and survival."
We all bloody struggle, don't we?

473
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,395
I struggle! Do you think it's easy
for me? I'll tell you something.

474
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,678
It is not easy. Not one little bit.
Neither the struggle nor the survival!

475
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,992
The whole world's struggling
for survival, so why shouldn't you?!

476
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,156
My dear Norman,
I seem to have upset you.

477
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,914
I apologize.

478
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,637
I understand.

479
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,156
We can't always be strong.
There's danger in covering the cracks.

480
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,075
Never mind about covering the cracks.
What about covering the wig-join?

481
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,550
I'm sorry if I disturbed
your concentration.

482
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,109
"We both understand
servitude, Alphonso."

483
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,319
We won't forget to finish
our eyebrows, will we, Sir?

484
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,756
- What performance is this?
- Tonight will be...

485
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,072
...your 227th performance
of the part, Sir.

486
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,793
Two hundred and twenty-seven Lears...

487
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,113
...and I can't remember
the first line.

488
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,429
One, two, three, four.

489
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,670
- There was no time to alter the costume.
- There never is.

490
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,192
- How are you feeling?
- A little more myself, Pussy.

491
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,115
You see? Once he's assumed
the disguise, he's a different man.

492
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,558
- Shall I tie the cloak on as usual?
- Yes, as usual.

493
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,792
Mr. Thornton and Mr. Oxenby
are waiting outside.

494
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,316
- Shall I tell them to come in?
- No, Oxenby frightens me.

495
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,393
Mind you, he's the best lago
I've ever had or seen.

496
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,793
And I include that 4' 6" ponce,
Sir Arthur Palgrove.

497
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,235
That's more like the Sir
we know and love.

498
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,916
Sir Arthur Palgrove.

499
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,029
He went on playing Hamlet
until he was 68.

500
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,752
There were more lines on his face
than steps to the gallery.

501
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,236
I saw his Lear.

502
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,394
I was pleasantly disappointed.
Sir Arthur Palgrove!

503
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,313
Who advises His Majesty,
answer me that?

504
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,675
You're a miracle worker, Norman.

505
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,798
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

506
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,076
I've got a piece of chocolate for you.

507
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,913
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

508
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,791
Don't suppose I didn't see that,
because I did.

509
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,788
There are thousands of children
all over this beloved land of ours...

510
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,191
...scavenging the larders
for something sweet.

511
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,512
If only they came to me, I could tell
them of the one person in England...

512
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,116
...who has an inexhaustible
supply of chocolate.

513
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,751
It is I who have to carry her on,
dead, as Cordelia.

514
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,595
It is I who have to lift her up
and carry her in my arms.

515
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,354
Thank Christ, I thought,
for rationing! But, no...

516
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,875
...she'd find sugar in a sand dune!

517
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,590
Shall I show the actors in, Sir?

518
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,033
Geoffrey.

519
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,634
Mr. Thornton to see you, Sir.

520
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,879
Well, Geoffrey, does the costume fit?

521
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,437
Mr. Davenport Scott
is such a small man.

522
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,878
Davenport Scott is a worm!
You look...

523
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,350
Do you know the lines?
Don't keep me waiting for them.

524
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,593
Pace, pace, pace, pace, pace.
And keep out of my focus.

525
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,512
The boom lights in the downstage
wings are for me only.

526
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,672
- Yes, old man, I know.
- You must find what light you can.

527
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,270
Right.

528
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,078
Let me hear you sing.

529
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,072
- What?
- "He that has and a little tiny wit."

530
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,675
He that has...

531
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,712
He that has...

532
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,719
All right, speak it, don't sing it.

533
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,873
And in the storm scene, if you're gonna
put your hands around my legs...

534
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,795
...as Davenport Scott did,
then around my calves, not my thighs.

535
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,112
- He nearly ruptured me twice.
- Lf you'd rather I didn't, old man...

536
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,111
Oh, feel it, my boy, feel it.

537
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,670
Whatever takes you,
that's the only way.

538
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,877
But do not let too much take you.

539
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,068
Remain within the bounds and
at all costs, remain still when I speak.

540
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,870
And no crying in the part.
I have the tears in this play.

541
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,110
- Yes, I know.
- Serve the playwright...

542
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,840
...and keep your teeth in.

543
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,437
- It's only when I'm nervous.
- You will be nervous, I guarantee it.

544
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,637
There will be no extra payment
for tonight's performance.

545
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,075
Your contract is, I believe,
"play as cast"?

546
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,432
- Yes.
- Good fortune attend your endeavours.

547
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,272
Thank you, Sir.

548
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,590
- God bless, Geoffrey.
- I'd rather face the Nazi hoards.

549
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,712
I hope Mr. Churchill
has better men in his Cabinet.

550
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,996
Mr. Oxenby's waiting to see you now.

551
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,631
Oxenby? Why, I can't.
What does Oxenby want?

552
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,634
It's what we want. Someone
to operate the wind machine.

553
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,308
I don't want to see Oxenby.

554
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,119
I can't bear the man.

555
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,679
Oh, it's stifling in here.

556
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,868
Sir, you will have no storm
without him.

557
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,830
Mr. Oxenby to see you, Sir.

558
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,916
- You wanted to see me?
- What?

559
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,438
Did I? Norman?

560
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,752
Sir was wondering whether he could
ask of you a favour.

561
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,670
He can ask.

562
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,952
You haven't been with us long,
but you know...

563
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,237
...that we're not so much a company
as one big happy family.

564
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,075
We all muck in as required.

565
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,076
As you will no doubt have heard,
Mr. Davenport Scott...

566
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,518
...will not be rejoining the company.
- Yes, I've heard.

567
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,195
You share a dressing room with them,
you hear nothing else.

568
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,874
It upsets the pansy fraternity...

569
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,715
...when one of their number is caught.

570
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,550
We have no one to operate
the wind machine.

571
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,555
We wondered if you
would turn the handle?

572
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,118
In short, no.

573
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,709
Anything else?

574
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,196
Has he read my play yet?

575
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,870
Oh, fancy not wanting to muck in.

576
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,992
He hates me.

577
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,628
I feel his hatred.

578
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,191
All I stand for, he despises.

579
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,678
I wouldn't read his play
if he were commissar of culture.

580
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,115
I've read it.

581
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,838
Is there a part for me?

582
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,675
Yes, but you wouldn't
credit the language.

583
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,356
He was ungenerous
about Davenport Scott.

584
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,310
I hold no brief for buggers...

585
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,075
...but where's the man's humanity?

586
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,952
A fellow artist brought low
and in the cells...

587
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,997
...cannot be cause...

588
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,278
...for rejoicing.

589
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,352
Oughtn't we to be quiet
for a minute, Sir?

590
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,796
A quarter of an hour, please.
A few minutes late, I'm sorry.

591
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,111
I can't. Tell them to go home.
Give them their money back.

592
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,078
- You want the performance cancelled?
- No, he does not.

593
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,153
- For your own good, please.
- Get out! He'll be ready!

594
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,833
- We're out of time.
- Leave me!

595
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,150
I can't remember the lines! Norman!

596
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,276
Norman, how does it begin?

597
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,113
He hath been out nine years,
and away he shall again.

598
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,589
The king is coming.

599
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,990
Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy...

600
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,869
Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester.

601
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,679
I shall, my liege.

602
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,435
- Meantime we shall express...
- Meantime we shall express...

603
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,875
...our darker purpose.
- Give me the map...

604
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,032
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. I know it!

605
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,158
I have played the part before,
you know.

606
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,311
Give me the map there.

607
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,835
Don't tell me. Don't tell me!

608
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,151
What do I fear? Myself?

609
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,993
Wrong! "Know that we have divided..."

610
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,870
There's none else by.
True, I talk of dreams...

611
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,554
...which are the children
of an idle brain.

612
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,713
- Wrong play. Wrong play!
- I will move storms.

613
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,190
I will condole in some measure.

614
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,952
That's another wrong play!

615
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,110
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France?

616
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,479
Men should be what they seem.
My name's Macbeth!

617
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,599
- I have lived long enough!
- Now look what you've gone and done!

618
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,435
Outside! Outside! You've quoted
from the Scottish tragedy!

619
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,990
What? Macb... Christ, did I?

620
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,549
Outside.

621
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,438
Turn around three times.

622
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,352
One.

623
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,511
Two.

624
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,910
Three.

625
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,709
Knock.

626
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,429
Come in.

627
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,432
Swear.

628
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,068
Piss-pots!

629
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,715
And my poor fool is hang'd.

630
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,630
No, no, no life.

631
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,157
Why should a dog,
a horse, a rat, have life...

632
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,995
...and thou no breath at all?

633
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,390
Thou'It come no more.

634
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,676
Never, never...

635
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,913
...never, never, never.

636
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,838
Welcome back, Sir.
You'll be all right.

637
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,997
- Struggle, Bonzo.
- Survival, Pussy.

638
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,630
- Five minutes, please, Sir.
- Thank you.

639
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,995
Let us descend...

640
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,676
...and survey the scene of battle.

641
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,997
- Five minutes.
- Good luck, Geoffrey.

642
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,515
Five minutes, please. Five minutes.

643
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,717
I'm working here.

644
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,633
The night I played my first Lear
there was a real storm. Now bombs.

645
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,995
How much more will I have to endure?

646
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,029
We are to speak Shakespeare, and
they'll go to any lengths to prevent me.

647
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,672
- I shouldn't take it so personally.
- Bomb, bomb, bomb us into oblivion...

648
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,912
...if you dare, but each word I speak...

649
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,709
...will be a shield against
your savagery. Each line I utter...

650
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,589
...protection from your terror.
- I don't think they can hear you, Sir.

651
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,797
Barbarians.

652
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,114
Oh, Sir, just as we were winning.

653
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,273
- Perhaps it's timely. Look at him.
- He can't go on.

654
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,795
Get the curtain up this instant!

655
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,474
No squadron of fascist Bolsheviks...

656
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,234
...will stop me now!

657
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,351
Do as I say!

658
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,837
- Who will make the announcement?
- Davenport Scott, of course.

659
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,039
Mr. Davenport Scott isn't here tonight.
Everyone else is in costume.

660
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,589
You then, Norman.

661
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,955
- No, Sir, I can't appear.
- You, Norman.

662
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,918
I'll forget what to say.
My memory's like a policeman.

663
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,198
- It's never there when you want it.
- I have given my orders. Do as I say!

664
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,591
- Sir, I am not equipped.
- Do it!

665
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,036
Why can't I stop shaking?

666
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,356
Ladies and gentlemen.

667
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,157
Ladies and gentlemen...

668
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,552
...the air raid warning has just gone.

669
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,150
An air raid is in progress.

670
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,632
We shall proceed
with the performance.

671
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,389
Will those who wish to live...

672
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,072
Will those who wish to leave...

673
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,199
...do so as quietly as possible?

674
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,874
Thank you.

675
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,599
Stand by.
Stand by on tabs.

676
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,152
Houselights to a half.

677
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,354
Stand by, timpani.

678
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,229
Houselights out.

679
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,238
Houselights out.

680
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,552
Cueing grands.

681
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,593
Cue drum roll.

682
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,114
Stand by.

683
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,994
Clerics.

684
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,277
Curtain going up!

685
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,389
I thought the king had more affected
the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.

686
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,956
It did always seem so to us,
but in the division of the kingdom...

687
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,510
...it appears not which of the dukes
he values most.

688
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,673
- Geoffrey, was I all right?
- What?

689
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,594
- The announcement. Was I effective?
- Oh, yes, old man, damn good.

690
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,352
Thank you. Good luck, Geoffrey.

691
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,956
I've so often blushed to acknowledge
him that now I am brazed to it.

692
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,594
Your Ladyship, was I all right?

693
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,957
- Better than Mr. Davenport Scott.
- Do you really think so?

694
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,076
I was ever so nervous.

695
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,516
Do you think anyone noticed the fluff?

696
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,070
"Will those who wish to live."
Oh, I could've kicked meself.

697
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,437
- You were fine.
- Thank you.

698
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,319
- Did he say anything?
- No.

699
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,760
Stand by, please, Your Ladyship.

700
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,593
Stand by, please, Sir.

701
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,914
He hath been out nine years,
and away he shall again.

702
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,308
The king is coming.

703
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,198
Stand by, Sir.
Cue in the king's fanfare.

704
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,033
Sir, it's your cue.

705
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,431
Sir, Her Ladyship's entered,
quite a nice round too.

706
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,319
Now it's your turn. Come along, Sir.

707
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,716
You see? What did I say?

708
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,269
Oh, please, Sir. I implore you.

709
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,150
The king is coming.

710
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,754
- Methought I saw the king.
- Methought so too.

711
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,990
You're on, Sir. You're on!

712
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,238
Methought I saw him.

713
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,597
His profession formed.

714
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,630
Sir, it's your entrance.
Mr. Oxenby's having to extemporize.

715
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,109
Sombre they look...

716
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,758
...their muted colours of a tone...

717
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:00,189
...with the bleak heathland that is...

718
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,874
...our kingdom.

719
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:07,113
The king, my father, was,
methought, behind me.

720
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,717
Sir, the natives are getting restless.
Sound the fanfare again.

721
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,473
Methinks I see the king.

722
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,915
No, I was mistook.

723
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,277
I will, with thy consent...

724
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,874
...to his majestic side...

725
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:38,751
...there to discover his royal progress.

726
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,714
- Is he coming or isn't he?
- Yes!

727
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,071
I am assured, my lord...

728
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,518
...the king is coming.

729
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,838
Struggle and survival, sir!

730
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,628
- Cue the 100 knights! Cue the knights!
- Get on, get on!

731
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,798
Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester.

732
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,313
Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy...

733
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,155
...GIoucester.
- I shall, my liege.

734
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,038
Meantime...

735
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,638
...we shall express
our darker purpose.

736
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,873
Give me the map there.

737
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:17,558
Know that we have divided
in three our kingdom.

738
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,556
And 'tis our fast intent
to shake all cares...

739
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,430
...and business from our age, conferring
them on younger strengths...

740
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:32,594
...while we unburthen'd
crawl toward death.

741
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,472
Yes.

742
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,428
Well, if he stays out again,
you must take him to the vet.

743
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,713
You think I'll weep.

744
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,679
No, I'll not weep.

745
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:51,311
I have full cause of weeping...

746
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,273
...but this heart shall break
into 100,000 flaws...

747
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,069
...or ere I'll weep.

748
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,834
O Fool...

749
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,316
...I shall go mad!

750
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,439
Stand by for the storm.

751
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,438
- All clear.
- Swines.

752
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,398
Just when you want them,
they run away!

753
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,028
O, sir, to willful men, the injuries
that they themselves procure...

754
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,112
...must be their schoolmasters.

755
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,032
Shut up your doors.

756
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:59,512
He is attended with a desperate train,
and what they may incense him to...

757
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:04,071
...being apt to have his ear abused,
wisdom bids fear.

758
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,310
Shut your doors, my lord,
'tis a wild night.

759
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,313
My Regan counsels well.
Come out o' the storm.

760
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,789
Go, storm.

761
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:29,274
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks.

762
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:35,754
Rage, blow!

763
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,279
You cataracts and hurricanoes,
spout...

764
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:46,675
...till you have drench'd our steeples,
drown'd the cocks.

765
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,269
You sulph'rous
and thought-executing fires...

766
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,560
...vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving
thunderbolts...

767
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,951
Louder! Louder!

768
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,918
Louder! He wants it louder!

769
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,311
He wants it louder!

770
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,631
I am a man...

771
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,032
...more sinn'd against...

772
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,590
...than sinning!

773
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,871
Where was the storm?

774
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,999
I ask for cataracts and hurricanes...

775
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,232
...and you give me trickles
and whistles!

776
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,628
I demand oak-cleaving thunderbolts...

777
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,711
...and you answer...

778
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,396
...with farting flies!

779
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,356
I am the storm!

780
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,318
I am the wind and the spit...

781
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:32,359
...the fire and the pother!

782
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:38,320
And I am fed nothing
but muffled funeral drums!

783
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,998
Christ Almighty! God, forgive them
for they know not what they do!

784
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,913
I am driven deaf by whispers!

785
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,150
Norman, Norman,
you have thwarted me!

786
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,710
Good evening, Sir.
I didn't have the chance to...

787
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,791
- Guard the door!
...welcome you here.

788
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,873
You should be happy, Sir.
It's a very good house tonight.

789
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,792
I was there!

790
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,076
Within sight!

791
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,755
The glory was mine for the plucking...

792
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,196
...and then naught!

793
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:16,391
Zero, silence, a breeze.

794
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,349
A shower.

795
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,716
A collision of cotton wool.

796
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,917
A flapping of butterfly wings!

797
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:31,232
I want a tempest, not a drizzle!

798
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,436
Something will have to be done!

799
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,431
I demand to know...

800
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,276
...what happened tonight
to the storm!

801
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,877
I'm pleased you're pleased.

802
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,396
I've never known you not to complain
when you've been at it.

803
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,157
And tonight one could say without fear
of contradiction, you were at it.

804
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,595
Rest now.

805
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,274
You've the interval
in all of Gloucester's blinding...

806
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,756
...before " No, they cannot touch me
for coining." Try to sleep.

807
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,957
"You need quiet," as the deaf-mute
said to the piano tuner.

808
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,634
Mighty, Her Ladyship
thought you were tonight.

809
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,950
That was the word she used, "mighty."

810
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:14,910
And wasn't Geoffrey agile as Fool?
For a man his age.

811
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,072
He kept well downstage,
never once got in your light.

812
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:22,791
Much less obtrusive than
Mr. Davenport Scott in every way.

813
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,317
And what about Mr. Oxenby?

814
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,754
Are we asleep, Sir?

815
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,479
To be driven thus!

816
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,633
- I hate the swines!
- Who?

817
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,110
Now, who is it you hate?

818
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,552
- The critics?
- The critics?

819
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,678
I hate the critics?

820
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,674
I have nothing but compassion
for them.

821
01:14:54,120 --> 01:15:00,195
How can I hate the crippled,
the mentally deficient and the dead?

822
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,316
- Who then?
- Who then what?

823
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,596
Who then, what is it you hate?

824
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,549
Let me rest, Norman. You must
stop questioning me. Let me rest.

825
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:14,271
Don't leave me until I'm asleep.
Don't leave me alone.

826
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,634
I'm a spent force.

827
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,431
My days are numbered.

828
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,354
Numbered.

829
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,196
- Thank you for helping with the storm.
- I don't know why I did.

830
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:16,433
We're a band of brothers, that's why.
You're one of us in spite of yourself.

831
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,149
- Get stuffed.
- That's not nice.

832
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,877
You're Norman, aren't you?

833
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,958
Remember me? This afternoon,
in the square.

834
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,475
Hello, ducky! You in tonight?

835
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:44,037
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Never known him full of the real thing.

836
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,112
- Oh, thank you. We do our best.
- Mind you...

837
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,995
...seeing him this afternoon,
I never thought he'd get on stage.

838
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:56,035
Well, you know what they say, love,
Dr. Greasepaint, nothing like it.

839
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,954
Hello, Norman, how are you?

840
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,119
Will you have one, pet?

841
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,911
Oh, no, I never drink on duty.

842
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,353
Fetch Madge!

843
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,995
Don't be late for the second act.

844
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,196
Excuse me.

845
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,751
There, there, Evelyn, it's only a play.

846
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,117
Only a play, dear.

847
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,440
- It's going well.
- Except for your first entrance.

848
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,830
- Your hands are like ice!
- Cold with fear.

849
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,592
- Frightened?
- Of what's to come.

850
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,593
I thought I caught
a sight of him tonight.

851
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,230
Or myself as he sees me.

852
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,916
Speaking, "O reason not the need,"
I became detached from myself.

853
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,594
My thoughts flew.
I was observing from a height.

854
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,399
"Go on, bastard," I seemed
to be saying or hearing.

855
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,199
"You've more to give,
don't hold back. More!"

856
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,511
And I was watching Lear.

857
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:06,070
Each word he spoke
was fresh invented.

858
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,357
I had no knowledge of what came next,
what fate awaited him.

859
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,513
The agony was in the moment
of acting created.

860
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:20,074
I saw an old man
and the old man was me.

861
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,835
Outside myself.

862
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,918
Do you understand?

863
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,039
Outside myself.

864
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,913
Please, I have a show to run.

865
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,033
Twenty years?

866
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,750
- Did you say 20 years?
- Yes.

867
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,635
Have you been happy?
Has it been worth it?

868
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,598
No, I've not been happy.

869
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,354
Yes, it's been worth it.

870
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,354
Madge, dear, in my will I've left you
my press-cutting books.

871
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:12,354
- I don't want to hear what you've left...
- I have something else for you.

872
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,433
If possessions can be dear, then
this ring is the dearest thing I own.

873
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,239
This ring was worn
by Edmund Kean in a play...

874
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,154
...whose title is an apt inscription
for how I feel:

875
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,551
A New Way to Pay Old Debts.

876
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,438
When you talk of it...

877
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,115
...say Edmund Kean and I wore it.

878
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:41,871
I once had it in mind
to give it to you years ago...

879
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,994
...but you were younger then.

880
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,799
I thought you would misunderstand.

881
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,356
Yes.

882
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,798
A ring from a man to a woman...

883
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,077
...is easily misunderstood.

884
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:03,637
I know I'm thought insensitive...

885
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:08,237
...but I'm not blind.
- No.

886
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,436
No, I've always known
you were aware...

887
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,717
...of what the spinster
in the corner felt.

888
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,314
You were right not to give me a ring
years ago.

889
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,318
I lived in hope then.

890
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,000
At least I've seen you every day.

891
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,072
Made myself useful to you.

892
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,638
I settled for what I could get.

893
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,870
I've always been aware
of my limitations.

894
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,272
Speak well of me.

895
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:51,430
You are the only one
who really, truly loves me.

896
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,235
Life would not yield to age.

897
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,756
O, my good lord,
I have been your tenant...

898
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,833
...and your father's tenant,
these fourscore years.

899
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,470
Away, get thee away, my friend,
be gone!

900
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,518
Thy comforts can do me
no good at all.

901
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,678
He said you were far better
than Mr. Davenport Scott in every way.

902
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,876
Did he? Did he really?

903
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,429
He said you were very fine
in the storm scene.

904
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,160
"Very agile," he said.

905
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,788
Fool's, by far,
the most important part...

906
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,679
...I've ever played in Shakespeare.

907
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,072
Trouble is, it gives one
a taste for more.

908
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,718
- Yes?
- It's Irene.

909
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,078
- I'm returning the triple crown, Sir.
- Yes.

910
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,639
Put it down.

911
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,474
Sir, will it disturb you
if I say something?

912
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,315
- It depends on what it is.
- I just wanted to thank you.

913
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,916
- For what?
- The performance this evening.

914
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:45,678
- It isn't over yet.
- I felt honoured to be on the stage.

915
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,153
In the drawer of the makeup table
you will find a photograph of me.

916
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,589
I love coming into your room.

917
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,753
I can feel the power...

918
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,794
...and the mystery.

919
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,318
In days gone by...

920
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:30,554
...this would have been the place
where the high priests robed.

921
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:36,156
I feel frightened.
As though I'm trespassing.

922
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,392
A kindred spirit?

923
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,590
Lock the door.

924
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,355
Come nearer...?

925
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,629
- Irene.
- Irene.

926
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,750
- And you want to act?
- Yes.

927
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,309
- Passionately?
- Yes.

928
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,234
- To the exclusion of all else?
- Yes.

929
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,518
You must be prepared to sacrifice
what most people call life.

930
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,439
I am.

931
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,036
Have you good legs?

932
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,835
Higher.

933
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,194
There's not much to you.

934
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,991
Such small bones.

935
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,358
- Are you getting enough to eat?
- Oh, yes.

936
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,913
So young.

937
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,039
So young.

938
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,234
That's more like it!

939
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,952
Too late. It's too late.

940
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,960
- Well, now, my dainty duck.
- He seems much better.

941
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,758
What was all that about?

942
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,388
Let go of me!

943
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,316
- But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?
- Ay, madam.

944
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,959
Himself in...

945
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,795
Think I don't know the game? Think
I've dressed him for 16 years...

946
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,669
...nursed him, spoiled him, washed
his sweat-sodden doublets and hose...

947
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,992
...and his underpants night after night
without knowing every twist and turn...

948
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:59,312
...of what's known as his mind?
He did something unseen and furtive.

949
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,950
Something that gave him pleasure.
That's more like it!

950
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:07,233
More like what, Irene?
I have to know all he does!

951
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,753
- He lifted me up.
- He lifted you up?

952
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:16,397
"So young," he said, and lifted me up.

953
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,079
Why do you laugh?

954
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,550
He was trembling and so was I.

955
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,154
It's youth and newness he needs.

956
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,990
With my eyes closed I imagined
what it would be like...

957
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,720
...to be carried on by him.

958
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,155
Cordelia...

959
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,670
...dead in his arms, young.

960
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,350
Never mind the young Cordelia, ducky.

961
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,599
He wants a light Cordelia.

962
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,438
Light, ducky, light.

963
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,992
- Look at yourself, at Her Ladyship.
- You don't understand.

964
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:53,709
- He needs youth.
- You're lighter than she is.

965
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,269
You're not the first one
placed on the scales.

966
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,635
How do you think Her Ladyship
got the job?

967
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,839
A slip of a girl went from map carrier
to youngest daughter overnight.

968
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,070
I remember it well.
That was the tour...

969
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,038
...the doge of Venice
gave Lancelot Gobbo clap.

970
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,829
It's not youth or talent or star quality
he's after, ducky...

971
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,679
...but a moderate eater.

972
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,114
Off you go, ducky.

973
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,550
She'll have to find another canoe
to paddle.

974
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,395
Ours, I'm afraid, hath holes.

975
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,151
Did I tell you, Sir? I mingled,
during the interval.

976
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:37,474
You should hear what they think.
Michelangelo, William Blake.

977
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:41,758
God knows who else
you reminded them of.

978
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,349
Michelangelo?

979
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,990
Do they?

980
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,994
And Blake.

981
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,398
I know what they mean.

982
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,235
Moral grandeur.

983
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,755
I talked to the girl.

984
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,276
She's not as light as she looks.

985
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:19,868
We are none of us strong enough
for a change of cast.

986
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,678
You can never be properly paid!

987
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,070
In pectoral, I name you friend.

988
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,629
The debt is all mine.

989
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,597
I shall find a way to repay you.

990
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,116
- I must settle all my debts.
- Stop it. You're making me tearful.

991
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,919
God, your breath smells
of stale tights!

992
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,640
- How much have you had?
- Not enough.

993
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,998
- Lago, lago!
- Wrong play.

994
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,598
I have to wake up in bliss.

995
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,796
I have to carry on Her Ladyship.

996
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,349
- I need you sober.
- I am sober!

997
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,830
Diction perfect, deportment steady,
temper serene.

998
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,070
It's no laughing matter.
The final push!

999
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,310
- I hope you're up to it!
- And you, dear.

1000
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,234
- What?
- And you, Lear.

1001
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,116
Be brief in it, to the castle...

1002
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,831
...for my writ is on the life of Lear
and on Cordelia.

1003
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,389
Nay, send in time.

1004
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:16,791
- Run, O, run!
- To who, my lord?

1005
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,713
Who has the office?
Send thy token of reprieve.

1006
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,518
Well thought on.

1007
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:25,912
Take my sword,
give it the captain.

1008
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,388
Haste thee, for thy life.

1009
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,199
He hath commission from thy wife
and me...

1010
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:38,316
...to hang Cordelia in the prison, and
to lay blame upon her own despair...

1011
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,040
...that she fordid herself.

1012
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:45,432
I do wish you wouldn't do that.
You remind me of a labourer.

1013
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:25,757
O, you are men of stones.

1014
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,993
Had I your tongues and eyes...

1015
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,355
...I'd use them so...

1016
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,475
...that heaven's vault should crack!

1017
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,269
She's gone forever.

1018
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,715
My poor fool is hang'd.

1019
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,190
No, no.

1020
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,592
No life?

1021
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:18,195
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat
have life...

1022
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:22,273
...and thou no breath at all?

1023
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,792
Thou'It come no more.

1024
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,389
Never.

1025
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,910
Never.

1026
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,560
Never.

1027
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,678
Never.

1028
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:46,436
Never.

1029
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,914
Pray you, undo this button.

1030
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,476
Thank you, sir.

1031
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,755
Do you see this?

1032
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,275
Look on her.

1033
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,432
Look, her lips.

1034
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,509
Look there.

1035
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,389
Look there.

1036
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,233
He faints.

1037
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,674
My lord, my lord!

1038
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:39,675
Break, heart, I prithee, break.

1039
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,991
O, and cease.

1040
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,552
The weight of this sad time
we must obey.

1041
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:56,635
Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.

1042
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,112
The oldest hath borne most.

1043
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,748
We that are young...

1044
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:08,597
...shall never see so much,
nor live so long.

1045
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,394
Curtain down!

1046
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:23,076
On stage, everybody, please.
Stand by for your curtain calls.

1047
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,869
- Curtain going up.
- We've done it, Will Shakespeare!

1048
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,077
We've done it!

1049
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:38,597
Stand by for your curtain call,
please, Sir.

1050
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,439
Let them know you're coming.

1051
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,592
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

1052
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,758
...thank you for the manner
in which you have received...

1053
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,070
...the greatest tragedy
in our language.

1054
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,790
We live in dangerous times.

1055
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:52,030
Our civilization is under threat
from the forces of darkness.

1056
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,916
And we humble actors
do all in our power...

1057
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:00,039
...to fight as soldiers on the side
of right in the great battle.

1058
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,474
We are animated by no other desire...

1059
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,677
...than to take the works
of the greatest poet-dramatist...

1060
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,193
...who has ever lived...

1061
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:13,480
...to every corner
of our beloved island!

1062
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,991
Tomorrow night we shall give...

1063
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,873
- Richard III.
...King Richard III.

1064
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,476
I myself will play the hunchback king.

1065
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:42,589
On Wednesday afternoon,
my lady wife will play...

1066
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,318
- Portia.
...Portia.

1067
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:48,075
And I myself, the badly wronged Jew
in The Merchant of Venice.

1068
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:53,633
A play, you might think,
of greater topicality than ever.

1069
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,870
- On Wednesday night...
- Lear.

1070
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,675
On Wednesday night...

1071
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:06,831
...we shall once more essay
the tragedy...

1072
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,117
...you have this evening witnessed.

1073
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:14,751
And I myself shall again undergo
the severest test...

1074
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,831
...known to an actor.

1075
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,995
On behalf of my lady wife...

1076
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,476
...my company and myself...

1077
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:29,713
...I remain your humble
and obedient servant.

1078
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,916
And can no other answer make...

1079
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,356
...but thanks...

1080
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,797
...and thanks...

1081
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,839
...and ever thanks.

1082
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,799
Right, all. Strike King Lear,
set for Richard III.

1083
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,396
Keep that backcloth in, George,
it does for Bosworth Field.

1084
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,551
Good night, Violet, love.

1085
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,837
Frank, will you give me a hand,
please?

1086
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:52,232
Fine performance tonight, old boy.
You gave them a bit of the old.

1087
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,038
Until tomorrow.

1088
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:57,476
Parting is such sweet...

1089
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,638
I'm getting weaker.

1090
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,438
Weaker...

1091
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,229
...weakened, weakening.
I'm at an end.

1092
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,879
Until tomorrow.

1093
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,998
I worry about you, my boy.
What will you do?

1094
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:15,310
As best I can.

1095
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,032
- What's the play tomorrow?
- Richard III.

1096
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,360
Oh, not the hunchback again.

1097
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,671
- Who planned this tour?
- You did.

1098
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,958
Slavery.

1099
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,237
Bloody slavery.

1100
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,392
Oughtn't we to remove
our makeup, sir?

1101
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,997
I shall leave nothing, nothing.

1102
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,431
I hope Will's pleased tonight.

1103
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,875
- I had a friend...
- Oh, for chrissake!

1104
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,996
I'm sick of your friends!

1105
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:32,439
A motley crew they are!
Pathetic, Ionely, despairing!

1106
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,156
- That's nice, isn't it?
- I beg your pardon. Uncalled for.

1107
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,118
- Count myself as your friend.
- Never despairing.

1108
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:40,799
I have apologized.

1109
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,558
Never, never despairing.

1110
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:46,713
Well, perhaps sometimes at night! Or
at Christmas when you can't get a job...

1111
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,112
...in a pantomime. But not once
inside the building! Never!

1112
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,353
Pathetic, maybe, but not ungrateful!

1113
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,954
"Too mindful of one's luck,"
as the saying goes.

1114
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,076
No duke is more privileged.

1115
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,471
Here's beauty.
Here's spring and summer.

1116
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,598
Here pain is bearable.

1117
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,318
And never Ionely. Not here.

1118
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:12,911
"For he today that sheds his blood
with me."

1119
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,719
Soft, no doubt.
Sensitive, that's my nature.

1120
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,235
Easily hurt, that's a virtue.

1121
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,755
I'm not here for reasons
of my own either.

1122
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:24,310
No one could accuse me
of base motives. I've got what I want.

1123
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,994
I don't need anyone to know it.
Inadequate, yes.

1124
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,515
But never, never despairing.

1125
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,353
Bonzo?

1126
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,068
Oh, you've not started
to change yet?

1127
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:39,994
I'm a little slow tonight, Pussy.

1128
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,749
I won't wait. I'll go to the digs
and see if I can get a fire lit.

1129
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,433
Shan't be long.

1130
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,352
Good night, Norman.

1131
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,670
I'm not sure
if I should thank you or not.

1132
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,479
Not. I can't bear being thanked.

1133
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,036
A good woman.

1134
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,917
Good night, old man.

1135
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,838
- Good night.
- Good night.

1136
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,479
Death to all tyrants!

1137
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,839
I heard that, Mr. Oxenby!

1138
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:25,391
Tell him from me that I look forward
to a new order.

1139
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,757
- I want a company...
- Excuse me.

1140
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,793
I want a company without tyrants.

1141
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,712
- Who would be in charge?
- I would.

1142
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,553
You'd be lovely with a little success,
Mr. Oxenby.

1143
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:41,518
Your nose is browner
than usual tonight, Norman.

1144
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,556
Good night, sir.

1145
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:48,110
- Good night, Norman.
- Lf you hurry, you'll catch Mr. Oxenby.

1146
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:58,510
I'm tired, so tired.

1147
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:03,037
The room's spinning. Must lie down.
Must...

1148
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,351
...lie down.

1149
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,998
See if you can get me a taxi...

1150
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:20,630
...in this godforsaken place.
- All in good time.

1151
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,791
- Oh, don't cry. Don't cry.
- There's nothing left.

1152
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,190
Now, stop that at once.

1153
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,477
Wish the storm would blow itself out.

1154
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,551
It has.

1155
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,996
You should hear the wind.

1156
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,477
Like a man in pain.

1157
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,030
It's quieter now...

1158
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,750
...except for the distant thunder.

1159
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:09,990
- I've begun My Life.
- What?

1160
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:13,511
Fetch it. On the desk, the book.

1161
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,037
I made a start.

1162
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,436
Find the place.

1163
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,918
You didn't get very far.

1164
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,638
What did I write?

1165
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,473
"My Life, dedication:

1166
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:31,431
This book is dedicated to my beloved
Pussy, who has been my splendid spur.

1167
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:37,072
To the spirit of all actors for their faith
and endurance which never fails them.

1168
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:43,554
To those who do the work of the theatre
yet have but small share in its glory...

1169
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:48,795
...carpenters, electricians,
scene-shifters, property men.

1170
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,997
To the audiences who have laughed
with us, wept with us...

1171
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:56,233
...and whose hearts have united with
ours in sympathy and understanding.

1172
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,789
And finally..."

1173
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,511
Oh, sir.

1174
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,830
"To the memory
of William Shakespeare...

1175
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,833
...in whose glorious service
we all labour."

1176
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,477
My Life...

1177
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,716
...will have to do.

1178
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:22,958
Carpenters, electricians,
property men.

1179
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,917
Sir.

1180
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,757
Sir?

1181
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,635
We're not dead, are we?

1182
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,352
Madge!

1183
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,954
Madge!

1184
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,351
Anybody!

1185
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,995
Wasn't much of a death scene.

1186
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,754
Ever so short for him.

1187
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,473
- Where's Her Ladyship?
- She left without him. Couldn't wait.

1188
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,676
I'll telephone her.

1189
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,759
And I'll get a doctor.

1190
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,674
Too late for a doctor, ducky.

1191
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,473
What will happen to me?

1192
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,509
- Wait outside.
- I don't want to wait outside.

1193
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:29,391
I never wait outside! I want to be here
with him. I know my place!

1194
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,390
Try and sober up.

1195
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:37,679
Carpenters! Electricians!
Property men!

1196
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,630
You cruel bastard!
You might have remembered!

1197
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,635
Her Ladyship's coming at once.

1198
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,995
She took it very calmly.

1199
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,479
She wants him covered
in his Lear cloak. Where is it?

1200
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,473
His Lear cloak?
Fetch the photographer, ducky!

1201
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:21,998
Covered in his Lear cloak? This
isn't the death of Nelson, you know.

1202
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,949
There's no mention
of stage managers either!

1203
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:32,193
You're nothing now, ducky.
He took away your stripes!

1204
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:34,271
And mine!

1205
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,512
- How could he be so bloody careless?
- Come away.

1206
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,955
And then where will I go? Where?

1207
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:42,918
I'm nowhere out of my element.

1208
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:48,108
I don't want to end up running
a boarding house in Westcliffe-on-Sea!

1209
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,875
Or Colwyn Bay!

1210
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,550
What am I going to do?

1211
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:57,917
- You can speak well of him.
- Speak well of that old sod?

1212
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:02,278
I wouldn't give him a good character
in a court of law! Ungrateful bastard!

1213
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:06,274
- Get out! I don't want you in here!
- What, holy, is it? Are we in a shrine?

1214
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,351
- No pissing on the altar!
- Stop it!

1215
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:13,640
He never once took me out for a meal,
not once! Always the back seat for me.

1216
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:18,078
I can't even remember him buying me a
drink and he just walks out, leaves me.

1217
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,198
No thought for anyone but himself!

1218
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,590
What have I been doing
all these years? Why?

1219
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,753
Yes, well, "Reason not the need."
Rotten bugger!

1220
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:32,391
Oh, beg your pardon. Turn around
three times and come back.

1221
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,756
Come back.

1222
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:38,678
Speak well of him?
Oh, I know what you'd say, ducky!

1223
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,116
I know all about you!
I've got eyes in me head.

1224
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:44,589
We all have our little sorrows.

1225
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,432
I know what you'd say:

1226
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:49,797
"Stiff upper, faithful, loyal."

1227
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,678
Well...

1228
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:55,308
...I've only one thing
to say about him.

1229
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,232
I wouldn't say it in front of you.

1230
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:01,234
I wouldn't give you the pleasure.
Or him, especially not him.

1231
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,755
No one will ever know.

1232
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,196
We all have our little sorrows, ducky.
You're not the only one.

1233
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,193
And the littler you are,
the larger the sorrow.

1234
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,750
You think you loved him?

1235
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,398
What about me?

1236
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,675
This isn't a place for death.

1237
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,674
I had a friend.

1238
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,631
Sir?

1239
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:33,909
