1
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,787
The dream is always the same.

2
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:07,419
Instead of going home,
I go to the neighbors'.

3
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,886
I ring, but nobody answers.

4
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:22,225
The door is open, so I go inside.

5
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:28,815
I look around,
but no one seems to be there.

6
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,240
Then I hear the shower running.

7
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:42,996
So, I go upstairs to see what's what.

8
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,933
Then I see her.

9
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,643
This... girl!

10
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,272
This incredible girl!

11
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,443
I don't know why she's there
because she doesn't live there...

12
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:17,655
...but it's a dream, so I go with it.

13
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,200
"Who's there?" she says.

14
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,369
"Joel," I say.

15
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,204
"What are you doing here?"

16
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,414
"I don't know.

17
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,209
"What are you doing here?"

18
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,462
"I'm taking a shower," she says.

19
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,673
Then I give her...

20
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,717
..."Do you want me to go?"

21
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,177
"No," she says.

22
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,057
"I want you to wash my back."

23
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,978
I'm getting enthusiastic about this dream.

24
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,149
So, I go to her, but she's hard
to find through all the steam.

25
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,986
I keep losing her.

26
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,626
Finally, I get to the door...

27
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:19,217
...and I find myself in a room full
of kids taking their College Boards.

28
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,428
I'm over three hours late!

29
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:27,851
I've got two minutes
to take the whole test.

30
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,771
I've just made a terrible mistake.

31
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,065
I'll never get to college.

32
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,902
My life is ruined.

33
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:45,452
Here's the game: Five-card draw
with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.

34
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:51,583
Pass two to the right, one to the left...

35
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,879
What happened?

36
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,380
Last night?

37
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,259
That's right, with Kessler.

38
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,136
She was babysitting down the street.

39
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,888
We know that!

40
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,558
So, I went over there.

41
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,978
She was giving the kid a bath
and accidentally hit the shower thing.

42
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,026
All of her clothes were drying upstairs.

43
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:23,073
So, she plops down on the kitchen floor...

44
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,950
...she looks up at me and says...

45
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,203
..."I think I'm in the mood."

46
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,331
She said that?

47
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,167
What did you say?

48
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,169
I didn't have to say anything.

49
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,922
What did you do?

50
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,174
What do you think I did?

51
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:48,431
I think you got the hell out of there,
ran home and whacked off!

52
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,017
I disagree.

53
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,688
Did you have your bike there?

54
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:01,194
I think you jumped on your bike,
pedaled home and whacked off!

55
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,613
That's what you think, right?

56
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:11,246
With Kessler sitting on the floor like that,
wanting me?

57
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,458
No guts, Goodson.

58
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,378
The problem was I just wasn't attracted
to her.

59
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,838
That should never stop you.

60
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,339
She seemed too big.

61
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,550
It could've worked out.

62
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,468
I thought I'd get into trouble.

63
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,391
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck!" Make your move!

64
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,853
That's easy for you to say.

65
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,857
You're all set.
You're probably going to Harvard.

66
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:44,738
Me, I don't want to make a mistake,
jeopardize my future!

67
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,743
Joel, let me tell you something.

68
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,664
Every now and then, say, "What the fuck."

69
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,001
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.

70
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,171
Freedom brings opportunity.

71
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:06,217
Opportunity makes your future.

72
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,597
Be right there.

73
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:19,022
So, your folks are going out of town?

74
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,524
Tomorrow.

75
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:26,613
You've got the place all to yourself?

76
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,531
Yeah?

77
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,160
"What the fuck."

78
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,083
If you can't say it...

79
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,045
...you can't do it.

80
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:55,225
Joel, did you get your SAT scores?

81
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,560
How did you do?

82
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,898
597: Math, 560: Verbal.

83
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,567
If you wanted to,
you could take them again?

84
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,236
- I guess so.
- Great.

85
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,155
Joel, I want to show you something.

86
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,740
Honey, did you pack my Mace?

87
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:15,495
Yes, in your cosmetic case.

88
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,500
Joel, do you hear something odd?

89
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,168
Something unpleasant?

90
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,962
No.

91
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,966
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?

92
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,259
No.

93
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,053
Is this the way I left the equalizer?

94
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,305
No.

95
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,269
This is not a toy for you and your friends.

96
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:45,358
If you can't use it properly,
you're not to use it at all.

97
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,320
My house, my rules.

98
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,784
Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.

99
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,703
He interviews for Princeton.

100
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,371
I'll never get into Princeton!

101
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,373
I already arranged an interview.

102
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,043
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.

103
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,295
Jesus, Dad!

104
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,631
Tell him about your involvement
with Future Enterprisers.

105
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,177
They like that.

106
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,305
There's $50 for food,
which is more than enough...

107
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,641
...another $50 for emergencies
and an extra $25 just in case.

108
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,020
Don't forget to water the plants
on the patio.

109
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,314
I made a list, it's on the refrigerator door.

110
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,024
Dad, should I start your car?

111
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,317
The car will be fine, Joel.

112
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,568
For the battery, I mean.

113
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,529
Please, you're not to use my car.
You're not insured for it.

114
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,492
- Use the station wagon.
- Use my car, honey.

115
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,577
Do we understand each other?

116
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,121
Okay!

117
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,750
As far as the house is concerned,
just use your best judgment.

118
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,335
We trust you.

119
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,545
Have a great time.

120
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,672
Be good.

121
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:53,093
We will, honey. You too.

122
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,106
"Just take those old records off the shelf

123
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,110
"I sit and listen to them by myself

124
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,739
"Today's music ain't got the same soul

125
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,743
"I like that old time rock and roll!

126
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,413
"Don't try to take me to a disco

127
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,417
"You'll never even get me out on the floor

128
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,004
"In ten minutes I'll be late for the door

129
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:15,008
"I like that old time rock and roll!

130
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,179
"Still like that old time rock and roll!

131
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,849
"That kind of music just soothes the soul

132
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,770
"I reminisce about the days of old

133
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:32,317
"With that old time rock and roll!"

134
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,922
Guess what?

135
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,050
Dalby got into Harvard.

136
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,802
He must have aced his Boards.

137
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,387
780: Verbal.

138
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,055
765: Math!

139
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,056
Shit!

140
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,809
Do you know what a Harvard MBA makes,
first year?

141
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,976
$40,000.

142
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,980
My cousin went into dermatology.
First year, over $60,000!

143
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,483
Just for squeezing zits?

144
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:18,071
Why don't you try it, Barry?
You have the experience.

145
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,823
Thank you, you're very kind.

146
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,825
Listen, you guys.

147
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,327
Doesn't anyone want
to accomplish anything?

148
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,247
Or do we just want to make money?

149
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,832
Make money.

150
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,709
Just make money.

151
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,585
Make a lot of money.

152
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,423
What about you, Joel?

153
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,844
Serve my fellow mankind.

154
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,268
Profit motive.

155
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,104
Competition.

156
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,523
Free enterprise.

157
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,860
Is there any company
that doesn't have a product in production?

158
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,528
We're falling far behind.

159
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,030
You haven't exactly been helping.

160
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,614
You wanted to be
the production executive.

161
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,285
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know
helps with production.

162
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,369
Yeah? Who?

163
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,371
Everyone! Just help me
with the production!

164
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,874
I can't! I'm too busy
with marketing and sales!

165
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,751
How can you be busy
with marketing and sales?

166
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,295
I haven't given you the product yet!

167
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,797
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing
over tonight.

168
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:26,056
I only did this because I thought
it'd look good on my record.

169
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,476
Hi, Glenn. What's up?

170
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,480
- I heard your parents were away.
- Yeah.

171
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,817
I thought maybe I could borrow a room?

172
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,986
Barry is here and we're working.

173
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,988
We won't bother you.

174
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,823
We don't have anywhere to go.

175
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,160
You know how it is.

176
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,288
Sure. Take my room.

177
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,625
Thanks, Joel.

178
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,838
Ready?

179
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,424
The "Memo-Minder"!

180
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,425
Here's how it works.

181
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,846
A call comes in for your mom,
it's fairly important. What do you do?

182
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:12,435
You write the message down here,
hit the switch... you've got the light.

183
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,773
Now, a call for your dad comes in
and it's really important!

184
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,442
You're gonna get your ass kicked in
if he misses it.

185
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,777
So, what do you do?

186
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:26,783
Write the message down there,
hit position two...

187
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:34,124
$1.86 in parts, sell it for $9.95
and make a fortune!

188
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,129
I can't concentrate with this.

189
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,465
This is really annoying.

190
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,094
It's ridiculous!

191
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,849
I'm out of here.

192
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:01,943
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.

193
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,157
If you read me, grunt twice!

194
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,703
Thank you!

195
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,032
I can't believe Glenn bringing
Statwiler over like that.

196
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,033
Why?

197
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,036
Because he boffed Hendricks last week!

198
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,037
He did?

199
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,124
Yes! And after the game on Saturday,
he fucked her.

200
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,876
- Barry?
- What?

201
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,296
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.

202
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,257
They are?

203
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,718
Yes. What did you think it was?

204
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,054
I thought it was something else.

205
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,890
You're sure on this?

206
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,227
I'm positive.

207
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,147
Shit!

208
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,409
Sublime breasts.

209
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,743
They're what kind of breasts?

210
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,372
Sublime breasts!

211
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,335
A couple of boys in daddy's car.

212
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:46,381
Do you want to race?

213
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,096
Hit it.

214
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,452
Okay. Good.

215
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:21,291
You've done the old man's car bit.
That's a good start.

216
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:25,795
Now, try this on for size.

217
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,381
"The Leather Castle.

218
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,302
"Chicago's finest dominants
and submissives.

219
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:37,307
"Fully equipped dungeons.
Beginners welcome."

220
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,976
It sounds great, Miles.

221
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,394
Here's one!

222
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:45,648
"My daddy used to spank my bare bottom.

223
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,235
"Now he's gone. Will you take his place?

224
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,737
"Call Misty."

225
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,324
Come on, Joel. You've got to
take advantage of this!

226
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,992
They come to your house!

227
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,997
"Countess Angelique seeks
young submissive with large ankles!"

228
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,332
This is it!

229
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:06,836
"For a good time in the privacy
of your own home, call Jackie:

230
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,964
"555-4875."

231
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:17,430
Succinct, to the point,
down to business. What do you say?

232
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:21,851
If you want to call, call for yourself.

233
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,270
A good time, Joel!

234
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,190
In the privacy of your own home!

235
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,360
What else can you ask for?

236
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,321
I'll make my own calls, thank you.

237
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,281
Then...

238
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,616
...call!

239
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,661
Forget it!

240
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,872
Forget it!

241
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,708
All right!

242
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,544
I'm calling.

243
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,879
You're calling?

244
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,631
Someday you'll thank me for this.

245
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,218
You'd better not mention me.

246
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,637
It's her answering machine.

247
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,307
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson,
345 Remson, Glencoe.

248
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:07,856
I'd like a good time in my home tonight.
Bye!

249
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,736
That was really cute.

250
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,821
Now, give me the number
so I can call her back.

251
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,408
Number? There's no number?

252
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,246
Give me the number, damn it!

253
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,750
There's no number.

254
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,752
You're an asshole!

255
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:33,381
Gotta go. Catch you later.

256
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,345
Shithead!

257
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,372
Oh, God!

258
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,393
Hello, Joel. I'm Jackie. How are you?

259
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,895
Nice to meet you, Jackie. I'm not Joel.

260
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,482
Joel stepped out for a moment.

261
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:18,236
I'll go call him.

262
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,703
Holy shit!

263
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,332
Dalby, get your ass over here!

264
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,251
I'm playing cards, Joel!

265
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,753
Just get over here!

266
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,087
Is she there?

267
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,174
Yes, she is here,
and she is waiting for you!

268
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,677
She's not waiting for me,
she's waiting for you.

269
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,846
Are you coming?

270
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:48,350
No! I'm playing cards!

271
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:52,187
You're not coming?

272
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:56,566
Get over here, Dalby!

273
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:12,457
Look, I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

274
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,126
Joel, be a courageous person.
Open the door!

275
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,546
That way, you see, I can call a cab.

276
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,715
Again, I'm really sorry.

277
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:24,636
As long as we come to an arrangement,
I'm in no mood for complaining.

278
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,389
I mean, when you put
your good money down...

279
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,725
...you gotta get what you wanted
in the first place. Know what I mean?

280
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:35,480
When you buy a TV,
you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.

281
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:38,066
I know we could get along
real well. But, hey!

282
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,236
It's your hard-earned money, right?

283
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,989
This way, we make an arrangement
and everyone is satisfied.

284
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,408
You had carfare.

285
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:50,578
A long ride. I don't ever come out this far.

286
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,746
And your time.

287
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,041
My time, my effort,
my infinite patience and understanding.

288
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,167
Thank you.

289
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,628
$75.

290
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,255
Fair enough.

291
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,466
Joel, I'm going to give you a number.

292
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,052
You ask for Lana.

293
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:10,223
- It's what you want.
- Thank you.

294
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:16,771
It's what every white boy
off the lake wants.

295
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,011
All right, Goodson,
we know you're in there!

296
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,347
What's that?

297
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:55,185
I think someone's out there.

298
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,275
Joel, the house is surrounded.

299
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:05,779
Do exactly as we say,
and no one gets hurt.

300
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,863
Oh, shit!

301
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:16,414
Get off the babysitter! Put on your
pants, and come out with your hands up!

302
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,337
Please, Joel, do as they say!

303
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,130
Get off the babysitter!

304
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:28,802
Don't throw your life away like this.

305
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:34,474
Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never
have a future! Not if I can help it!

306
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,310
You got that? No future!

307
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,062
Who is that?

308
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:42,107
My father!

309
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,040
Hello? Lana?

310
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,459
Yes?

311
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,794
Hi.

312
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,142
I'm a nice guy,
and I'd like to meet you tonight.

313
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:03,188
Fine. Where are you?

314
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:07,650
Where do you live?

315
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,404
Glencoe.

316
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:15,158
What's your name?

317
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,580
Ralph.

318
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:25,627
Ralph, can I have the address?

319
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,050
345...

320
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,928
...Remson.

321
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,555
Ralph?

322
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,977
I'll see you tonight.

323
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:25,830
Are you ready for me, Ralph?

324
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:26,076
This is a beautiful place, Ralph.
Is it all yours?

325
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,745
It's my folks', actually.

326
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:32,957
Do you know what it's worth?

327
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,292
A lot, probably.

328
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,294
Oh, yeah! Real estate?

329
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:38,421
It's fabulous!

330
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:44,552
Look, Lana... my name really isn't Ralph.

331
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,806
It's Joel.

332
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,851
I need $300... Joel.

333
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:53,978
You're kidding?

334
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,647
No, I don't believe I am.

335
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:59,776
Can I send it to you?

336
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,821
Can you send it to me, Joel?

337
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:06,658
I just don't have that much here
in the house.

338
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,452
How much do you have?

339
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:12,414
- I have $50.
- $50?

340
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:17,961
What are we going to do about this?

341
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,507
I have a bond at the bank I could cash...

342
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,136
I'm not good at waiting for people.

343
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,846
I'll be quick.

344
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:31,307
Give it a try.

345
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:12,015
I'm back!

346
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:27,197
I'm here for you.

347
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,051
How could she? It's so stupid!

348
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,552
Tell your mother it broke!

349
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:53,223
That egg is worth a lot more than $300!

350
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,558
What are you going to do?

351
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,936
I'm gonna get it back,
is what I'm gonna do.

352
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:58,770
Are you going to help?

353
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,731
Sure. When?

354
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,066
Right now!

355
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:06,945
I can't do it right now!
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow!

356
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,446
Hey, "Mr. What-The-Fuck"...

357
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,949
...what about "exploring
the dark side" and all that?

358
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,243
Or was that just bullshit?

359
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:16,955
That was just bullshit, Joel.

360
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:22,293
I'm surprised you listened to me.

361
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:28,508
Are you coming?

362
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,810
How can you even tell if she'll be here?

363
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:43,106
I called Jackie and she said to try here.

364
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:49,112
Great idea. Where else could
we get a hot chocolate for $4?

365
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:51,698
She's here!

366
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,950
Where?

367
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:57,996
The blue dress... those legs...

368
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,289
That's her.

369
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,917
She's fantastic!

370
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:15,472
She's looking right at us!

371
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,648
She knows we're here.

372
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:35,617
That's it?

373
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:39,245
That's it, Joel?

374
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:45,210
I can't believe we came
all the way here for that!

375
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,379
At least she knows we're on to her, Miles.

376
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,339
Yeah, she must be terrified.

377
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,883
Joel!

378
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,554
Is this your car?

379
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,182
Maybe.

380
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,685
Could we talk a minute?

381
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,645
Okay.

382
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,188
Let's talk!

383
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:11,528
Okay. In the car, all right? It's freezing.

384
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,414
Will you do me a favor?

385
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,416
You want me to do you a favor?

386
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,792
I just need a lift.

387
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:30,338
Look, I want my egg back!

388
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:31,798
Get out of the car!

389
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,216
Joel, better get moving.

390
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,718
I want my egg back!

391
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,636
You got it, all right? Just start driving!

392
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,054
When?

393
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,306
- Now!
- Open the door!

394
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,558
When do I get it back?

395
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,851
Start driving!

396
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,562
Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?

397
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:47,188
Hey, buster!

398
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,106
Fuck! Will you just...

399
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,233
- Get off the car!
- Just start driving!

400
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:53,236
Start driving, now!

401
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,406
Why don't you start the car, Joel?

402
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,907
Fuck! Get out of here!

403
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:00,243
Start the goddamn car, Joel!

404
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:03,913
Lana, open the door.

405
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:05,915
Where are you going? Lana!

406
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:10,545
Get out, or I'll kill you!

407
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,764
Who was that guy?

408
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,724
My manager.

409
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:26,353
He gets a little crazy sometimes.

410
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:30,440
This is my friend, Miles.

411
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,776
Do you like excitement, Miles?

412
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,612
Love it.

413
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:54,297
Okay, where do you want to go?

414
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,676
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

415
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,135
Tell me this:

416
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:03,306
Am I going in the right direction?

417
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,392
Oh, shit! Here he comes!

418
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,310
Here who comes?

419
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:11,064
That manager guy?

420
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,526
Hey, Guido!

421
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,153
Big man, Guido!

422
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:18,822
Big man with a gun!

423
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,156
What are you going to do?

424
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:24,285
Shoot us all? Stupid!

425
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,498
This guy Guido...

426
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,501
...he's a "manager"?
- That's right.

427
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:32,836
Or a pimp?

428
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,921
Now, that's quick, Joel.

429
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,841
Have you always been this quick,
or is this something new?

430
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,509
I don't believe this!

431
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,219
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow...

432
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:48,268
...and I'm being chased by Guido,
The Killer Pimp!

433
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:12,042
Miles?

434
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,168
I think I can take him.

435
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:17,505
What are you talking...

436
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:50,038
I'm really not enjoying this.

437
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:12,310
I think I'm going to throw up.

438
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:24,989
I think I'm going to throw up on you, Joel!

439
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,843
Porsche...

440
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:49,472
...there is no substitute.

441
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:52,517
Fuck you.

442
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,272
Hi, dear. It's Mother.

443
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,648
How are you?

444
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,192
Just checking in to say hello,
see how you're doing...

445
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:05,363
...and give you our flight information.

446
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:09,492
Wait a minute. Let me write this down.

447
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:14,205
Saturday, United, Flight 162 at 3:30.

448
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:19,169
That's right. How's everything else?
Do you have enough money?

449
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,090
It never seems to go as far
as you think it will.

450
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,051
Yes, I know.

451
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,554
I'm learning, Mom.

452
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:33,308
How is Aunt Tudi?

453
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:38,063
I will.

454
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:41,900
See you then, bye.

455
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,694
Your folks?

456
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,529
So, how are they?

457
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,365
Oh, they're just great.

458
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:50,033
How about Aunt Tudi?

459
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:56,373
Her hip is much better.
She sends her love.

460
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,627
You were telling me about Guido.

461
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:03,963
I quit Guido.

462
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:07,509
How come?

463
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,723
He thought he owned me.

464
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:17,268
Nobody owns me.

465
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,649
The problem is, I owe him for clothes
and hospital bills.

466
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,902
You were in the hospital?

467
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,279
I had this...

468
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,614
...pain in my chest.

469
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:33,785
I thought it was a heart condition.

470
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,245
What was it?

471
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,414
The doctor said nerves.

472
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:39,791
Nice service.

473
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,253
Reed & Barton.

474
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:48,800
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.

475
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:53,221
I'm going to school now.

476
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,104
I'll have to ask you to leave.

477
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,982
I'm sorry.

478
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,818
You won't let me stay?

479
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,573
No, I have to go to school.

480
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:17,078
I'm really sorry.

481
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:22,792
No, I'm sorry.

482
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:30,175
I'll be right back.

483
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,720
You guys go ahead without me.

484
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,096
She's still here?

485
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,725
She won't leave.

486
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,730
She won't leave.

487
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:49,527
Lana, look...

488
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:53,531
...I just want my egg back.
I want my house back.

489
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:57,619
I have a lot of work to do.

490
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:03,249
Did you have a good time last night?

491
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:06,628
You mean when we got back here?

492
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:11,549
I think you know what I mean.

493
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:19,015
I had a great time.

494
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:24,771
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.

495
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:29,401
Did I say you owe me anything?

496
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:30,151
No, you didn't.

497
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:36,574
I don't remember saying
you owe me anything.

498
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:41,663
What about my mother's egg?

499
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:49,295
You're the one who's going to college,
you figure it out.

500
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:51,089
How much time do you need?

501
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:54,092
I need long enough
to make a few phone calls.

502
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,845
I have to figure out how
to get my stuff back.

503
00:43:56,886 --> 00:44:00,515
Guido has probably locked me
out of the apartment by now.

504
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:03,518
All right!

505
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,854
But will you do me a favor?

506
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:09,315
Anything, cookie.

507
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:13,445
Don't steal anything!

508
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:17,866
If I come back here,
and find anything missing...

509
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:21,870
...l'm going straight to the police.
I'm not joking!

510
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:27,792
Joel, go to school. Go learn something.

511
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:43,141
May I see your pass, please!

512
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:46,895
I'm sure you've all read
chapters six through eight...

513
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:49,481
...so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.

514
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:56,029
Will you put your books on the floor,
please?

515
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:16,383
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

516
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:18,385
No. Glenn knows.

517
00:45:18,426 --> 00:45:19,594
What about Barry?

518
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,179
He knows, too.

519
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,264
Don't tell anyone!

520
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:27,018
I won't! I won't!

521
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:38,780
Lab reports should be on my desk
by tomorrow afternoon.

522
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:44,536
I won't accept any that aren't typed.

523
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:58,800
Term papers are due on Friday.

524
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:03,722
They count for 50%
of this semester's grades.

525
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:06,558
Damn it!

526
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:15,734
Hey, Miles, what's going on?

527
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:17,569
I'm waiting for Glenn.

528
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,945
Glenn? Where is he?

529
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:20,739
Inside.

530
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,073
In the house?

531
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:25,952
He wanted to meet her!

532
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,078
What are you doing?

533
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,163
I was inside.

534
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:31,708
I can see that.

535
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,502
You're home now.

536
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:39,257
Yeah, I live here, remember?

537
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,885
Glenn?

538
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:46,097
Tell me you didn't do anything with her.

539
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,766
Who, Lana?

540
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,100
Yeah, Lana.

541
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:50,226
Nothing.

542
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:51,895
I met her.

543
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:53,605
She's nice.

544
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,191
You're sure you didn't do anything?

545
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,984
Yeah, I swear.

546
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,695
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?

547
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:05,825
I did not do it with her, Joel!

548
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:13,166
Ask me about Vicki!

549
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,376
Who is Vicki?

550
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:17,629
Owe you one!

551
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:24,052
Are you Joel? Nice place you have here.

552
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:25,303
Where's Lana?

553
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,513
In the den.

554
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:29,641
I like your friend!

555
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:31,810
Get out! I'm not kidding!

556
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:35,522
What's your problem?

557
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:38,066
Just leave! Please!

558
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:44,489
Look, we're not ripping you off or anything.

559
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:46,574
What is this for?

560
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:51,329
Fifty goes to the house! You're the house!

561
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,749
I am not the house!

562
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:58,586
Just leave! I mean it!

563
00:47:58,628 --> 00:48:00,255
He's mad, Vicki.

564
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,590
Already? I just got here!

565
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:04,759
I think he wants us to go.

566
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:08,888
Do you want us to go?

567
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:13,101
Thank you.

568
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,294
I don't want any problems.

569
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:41,296
Do you know what
you did to me last night?

570
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:44,632
I don't care!

571
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:47,886
I don't want to see you
or do anything with you anymore.

572
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:51,431
Get in the car!

573
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,413
Excuse me.

574
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,624
What can I do for you?

575
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:20,877
Who are you?

576
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:29,260
Are you the kid I chased last night?

577
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:32,263
Is there something I can help you with?

578
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:34,265
You shouldn't drive like that.

579
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:37,686
People get hurt all the time.

580
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:40,480
Are you a smart kid?

581
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,482
You look like a smart kid.

582
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:43,858
I'm okay.

583
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,363
Where are the girls? Inside?

584
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:54,494
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.

585
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:58,665
The door is locked.

586
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:00,667
You're starting to give me a stomachache.

587
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:03,545
Good! I hope it hurts!

588
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,046
Are you going to open the door?

589
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,716
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!

590
00:50:07,757 --> 00:50:09,718
Shut your mouth!

591
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:14,180
Listen, maybe we don't work
for you anymore!

592
00:50:14,222 --> 00:50:15,557
Then who do you work for?

593
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,226
Who? If you don't work for me?

594
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:22,063
Maybe we work for Joel, now.

595
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,065
She's only kidding.

596
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:27,110
I hope so.

597
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:31,489
Joel, you look like a smart kid.

598
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:35,827
I'm going to tell you something
I'm sure you'll understand.

599
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,830
You're having fun now, right?

600
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:43,001
Right, Joel? The time of your life.

601
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:49,424
In a sluggish economy, never, ever fuck
with another man's livelihood!

602
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:55,347
If you're smart, like I hope you are...

603
00:50:55,472 --> 00:51:02,062
...you aren't going to make me
come back here.

604
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:10,403
Thank you, Joel.

605
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:12,947
It's very decent of you.

606
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:15,784
Just as long as we understand each other.

607
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:19,120
One night, then you'll find another place
to stay.

608
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,581
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy,
we'll have a place.

609
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,542
- Did you try her again?
- She's still out.

610
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,628
And my mother's egg?

611
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,465
If I can get my stuff back, I can get the egg.

612
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:31,883
Then you'll leave?

613
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,469
Then we'll leave.

614
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:37,806
I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends.

615
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:40,642
Clean, polite, quick.

616
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:45,689
I think there's a future here.

617
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:04,499
What are you studying?

618
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,918
It's a workshop...

619
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,172
...on free enterprise.

620
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:20,932
We make a product,
and then we try to market it.

621
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:23,685
Do you make a lot of money?

622
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:27,230
No. Not really.

623
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:31,276
No, but we...

624
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:33,862
...get to compete with other
student companies.

625
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:36,489
Actually, it's fucked!

626
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:39,325
I'm just kidding.

627
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:44,372
It's really quite competitive.

628
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:49,377
Do you ever get high, Joel?

629
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,629
Yeah. All the time.

630
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:55,884
You see, Vicki and I were thinking
about getting high.

631
00:52:55,925 --> 00:53:01,389
Maybe going out
and getting some ice cream?

632
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:05,143
You want to come?

633
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:14,361
I could go for some ice cream right now.

634
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:25,080
Are you stoned?

635
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:29,376
No. I do not believe so.

636
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:32,253
I think you're really wasted!

637
00:53:32,295 --> 00:53:34,714
This is not wasted, Barry.

638
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:39,761
This is definitely not wasted.

639
00:53:41,721 --> 00:53:44,307
Barry?

640
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:51,690
- I'm a little wasted!
- I know.

641
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:58,697
- Don't let me do anything stupid.
- Don't worry.

642
00:53:58,738 --> 00:54:02,742
Want to take a walk?

643
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:11,543
How do you like living at home?

644
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:13,211
It's okay.

645
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:15,046
I'll be out next year.

646
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,757
I'll bet your folks are nice.

647
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,218
They're gone till Sunday?

648
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,387
Yeah.

649
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,806
Because, I was thinking...

650
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:26,558
I mean, after your friend came over...

651
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,435
...I couldn't believe it!

652
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:31,896
A kid our age walks in with a $100!

653
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:33,606
Glenn.

654
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:36,234
Where did he get that kind of change?

655
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:38,611
I don't know.

656
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:41,948
He said he cashed a bond.

657
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:47,078
You people have a lot of bonds.

658
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:51,124
So, I was thinking...

659
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:55,754
...if we ever got our friends together,
we'd make a fortune!

660
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:58,923
Yeah. You're right.

661
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:00,967
Do you want to do that?

662
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:01,968
Do what?

663
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:06,765
Get our friends together
in the next few days.

664
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:10,894
No. I don't think so.

665
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:14,272
Make some money. Be a little enterpriser.

666
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,484
Future enterpriser.

667
00:55:17,525 --> 00:55:22,238
Be whatever you want to be.

668
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:29,954
What if I said I'd be your girlfriend
for the next few nights?

669
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:32,999
No charge?

670
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:37,128
Hey, I'm not pushing you on the idea.

671
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,881
It's just that my mind keeps working
all the time.

672
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:47,514
Nothing I can do about it.
It keeps working and working.

673
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,483
You warm enough?

674
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:01,444
I'm okay.

675
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:09,828
How come you left home?

676
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:12,038
Why?

677
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,167
I was just wondering.

678
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:23,174
Because my step-father
kept coming on to me.

679
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:28,221
What else do you want to know?

680
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:33,184
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

681
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,353
I have a brother.

682
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,689
What else?

683
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:39,357
If you don't want to talk...

684
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:40,692
No, no. Ask me anything.

685
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:43,028
I don't think you want to talk and it's okay.

686
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:48,366
No, I really want to talk to you.

687
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,869
What does he do?

688
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,414
He's in school.

689
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:57,375
How come you're not in school?

690
00:56:57,417 --> 00:57:01,338
I'm not my brother.

691
00:57:05,675 --> 00:57:08,219
I'm really trying to be friends with you.

692
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:11,556
But I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop trying to judge me...

693
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:18,772
...while you're leaning on your
daddy's $40,000 car.

694
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:22,817
I'll see you around.

695
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,659
Was it something I said?

696
00:57:35,663 --> 00:57:39,626
You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!

697
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:44,172
Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

698
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:03,149
Please stop! Please stop!

699
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:34,681
Thank you.

700
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:37,726
Thank you.

701
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:24,647
All right, everyone watch your feet!

702
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,415
Are you okay?

703
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:47,879
Do you want an aspirin?

704
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:53,802
Does your dad own a gun?

705
00:59:55,595 --> 01:00:00,308
Who's the U-boat commander?

706
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:16,741
You're right. You are absolutely
right to respond this way.

707
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:18,952
I did not have a doctor's appointment.

708
01:00:18,993 --> 01:00:22,080
But I will tell you exactly what happened.

709
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:23,748
"Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan...

710
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,918
...lf you write "unexcused,"
I fail two mid-terms.

711
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,422
It'll wreck my whole grade point average!

712
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:38,555
If you'd just stop and listen to me,
I'll explain everything.

713
01:00:40,181 --> 01:00:45,603
The truth is, my parents are away,
and I met this girl.

714
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:50,108
A call girl, actually.
She came to my house.

715
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,943
Look, you're writing again!

716
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,946
This is not "unexcused"!

717
01:00:54,988 --> 01:01:00,452
If you will just listen to me,
then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.

718
01:01:00,493 --> 01:01:02,454
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

719
01:01:02,495 --> 01:01:07,375
I had a doctor's appointment.

720
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,962
Excuse me.

721
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:14,632
It wasn't the girl, it was my father's car.

722
01:01:14,674 --> 01:01:16,634
I put my father's car into Lake Michigan...

723
01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:21,139
...and I had to get it fixed.

724
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:25,268
Just give me a break.

725
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:29,647
Let me put it this way.

726
01:01:29,689 --> 01:01:37,822
I have spent the last four years
of my life busting my butt in this shithole!

727
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:39,157
I'm sorry.

728
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:48,416
I don't think I can leave until I get
just a little compassion from you.

729
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,211
What did he get?

730
01:01:51,252 --> 01:01:54,214
Suspension, five days.

731
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:56,091
They kicked him out
of Future Enterprisers, too.

732
01:01:56,132 --> 01:01:58,343
Shit! They trashed his whole record!

733
01:01:58,385 --> 01:02:03,973
What's he going to do about the car?

734
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:07,852
Are you okay, Joel?

735
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:10,814
I'm okay.

736
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,616
I need a bike.

737
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:22,701
He needs a bike.

738
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:25,370
- Glenn, can I borrow your bike?
- Jesus, Glenn!

739
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:29,499
Sure. Here, use mine.

740
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,899
It was great the way her mind worked:

741
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:02,819
No guilt, no doubts, no fear.

742
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:07,157
None of my specialties.

743
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:13,329
Just this shameless pursuit of immediate
material gratification.

744
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:17,167
What a capitalist!

745
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:22,255
She told me I could make more money
in one night than I'd make all year.

746
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:24,841
Enough to pay for my father's car.

747
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:30,263
She told me she'd be my girlfriend.

748
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:32,390
She told me a lot of things.

749
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:34,851
I believed them all.

750
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:40,607
So, she introduced me to her friends.

751
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:46,613
"Now when I was a young boy

752
01:05:46,654 --> 01:05:49,949
"At the age of five

753
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:53,286
"My mother said I was going to be

754
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:56,623
"The greatest man alive

755
01:05:56,664 --> 01:06:00,210
"But now I'm a man

756
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:03,463
"Way past twenty-one

757
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:06,800
"I want you to believe me, baby

758
01:06:06,841 --> 01:06:10,303
"I have lots of fun

759
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:13,431
"I'm a man"

760
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:19,688
I introduced her to my friends.

761
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:29,155
We made Barry our treasurer.

762
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,158
Lana did production.

763
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,245
I concentrated on sales.

764
01:06:35,286 --> 01:06:37,914
So, you took her out to dinner twice.

765
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:40,166
What did that cost you?

766
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,334
About $30.

767
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:42,585
With tip?

768
01:06:42,627 --> 01:06:44,421
Okay, maybe $35.

769
01:06:44,462 --> 01:06:46,256
Any movies?

770
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:47,674
Three movies.

771
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:49,926
$20.

772
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:51,011
Parking?

773
01:06:51,052 --> 01:06:52,846
I park on the street.

774
01:06:52,887 --> 01:06:55,306
Gas?

775
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:58,309
Maybe $6.

776
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:05,275
All right, Stan, you're in for roughly $60.

777
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:11,364
What happened?

778
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:15,785
She slept with Jacobsen.

779
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:21,291
That's all I'm saying.

780
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:24,461
"I can make love to you, woman

781
01:07:24,502 --> 01:07:27,714
"In five minutes' time

782
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:31,676
"Ain't that a man?"

783
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:39,809
Do you know what he said... afterwards?

784
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:42,604
He said the lady had knowledge.

785
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:45,231
He was glad to get that knowledge.

786
01:07:45,273 --> 01:07:46,983
Do you know why?

787
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,485
Why?

788
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:52,489
Because college girls can smell ignorance...

789
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:54,407
...like dog shit.

790
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:56,826
I'll think about it.

791
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:58,328
Where are you going to school next year?

792
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,829
Wisconsin.

793
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,582
Wisconsin?

794
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:05,710
Big school.

795
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:26,523
All I'm saying is...

796
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:30,485
...walk like a man.

797
01:08:56,261 --> 01:09:00,306
Joel! This is a great party!

798
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:05,061
Are you having a good time?

799
01:09:10,525 --> 01:09:16,406
Excellent idea, Joel! Really excellent.

800
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:22,245
Some of the girls are wearing
my mother's clothing.

801
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,580
What's wrong with that?

802
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:25,790
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in analysis.

803
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:31,713
- Just talk to them, okay?
- All right.

804
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,881
Is Howie Rifkin here?

805
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:18,635
You're on, honey.

806
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,242
Joel! Somebody is at the front door
for you.

807
01:10:42,283 --> 01:10:45,954
All right, thank you. I'll be right there.

808
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:48,957
The thing is...

809
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:53,586
...I don't have to pay for it.

810
01:10:53,628 --> 01:10:57,215
I get it anyway.

811
01:11:00,635 --> 01:11:07,225
I'm going to get going
or I'll miss the party.

812
01:11:08,643 --> 01:11:13,231
Whatever you want to do...

813
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,454
Excuse me. Can I help you?

814
01:11:27,495 --> 01:11:29,330
Are you Joel?

815
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:30,331
Yes.

816
01:11:30,373 --> 01:11:32,292
Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.

817
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:35,295
I believe we had an interview scheduled.

818
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:37,339
If this is inconvenient for you...

819
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,301
No, sir. It's fine.

820
01:11:49,184 --> 01:11:54,189
Is it okay if I have the room?

821
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:57,650
Also, could you catch the phone
if anyone calls, please?

822
01:11:57,692 --> 01:12:01,821
I understand that you would like
to attend Princeton.

823
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:03,948
Yes, sir, very much.

824
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,034
Well, fine.

825
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:12,457
Let's take a look at what we have,
shall we?

826
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:25,053
Does this couch open?

827
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:26,554
Lana, I'm in a meeting.

828
01:12:26,596 --> 01:12:28,682
We need the room.

829
01:12:28,723 --> 01:12:33,436
I need a few minutes, okay?

830
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:39,401
Now, you've taken your SAT's already.

831
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:45,198
Math: 597, Verbal: 560. Correct me
if my information is inaccurate.

832
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,535
Well, yes, but I was planning on taking
those again.

833
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:52,706
Fine. Now, your grade point
average is 3.14.

834
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:54,749
You class rank: 52...

835
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:59,045
...which places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct?

836
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:02,048
Joel, this is my cousin, Ruben,
from Skokie.

837
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,383
Can you get him in tonight?

838
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:04,884
Not now, okay?

839
01:13:04,926 --> 01:13:12,308
- He has to be back by 12:00.
- All right, later guys.

840
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,730
Excuse me.

841
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:21,568
And you wish to major in?

842
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:23,611
Business.

843
01:13:23,653 --> 01:13:27,073
Business. Yes.

844
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,539
I'll be out in a second.

845
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:39,753
Fine, well, let's see what else there is.

846
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:46,134
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team,
Recording Secretary, Spanish Club...

847
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:48,428
"...Varsity Track Team: One year...

848
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:52,766
"...Honorable Mention:
Cook County Science Fair...

849
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:57,312
"...Future Enterprisers, Yearbook Staff...

850
01:13:57,354 --> 01:14:01,274
"...Student Council: Two years."

851
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:05,445
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.

852
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,990
You've done some very solid work here...

853
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:15,038
...but it isn't quite lvy League, is it?

854
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:20,293
You know, Bill...

855
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:23,963
...there's one thing I've learned
in all my years.

856
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:27,842
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck."

857
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:31,304
Make your move.

858
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:35,141
I beg your pardon?

859
01:14:35,183 --> 01:14:37,477
So, how are we doing?

860
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:39,813
Looks like University of Illinois!

861
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:42,357
"All right, all right!

862
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:45,318
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

863
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:50,573
"Everybody say, Oooh, all right!

864
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:55,662
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

865
01:14:57,205 --> 01:15:02,419
"Everybody clap your hands now!"

866
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:27,902
Some of your friends are looking for you.

867
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:33,241
What do you want me to tell them?

868
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,910
Has that guy from Princeton left yet?

869
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:39,039
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.

870
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,707
Talking?

871
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:45,337
They're very good talkers.

872
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:49,716
I don't think I'm going to say,
"What the fuck" anymore.

873
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:55,096
This thing has gotten way out of control.

874
01:15:55,138 --> 01:15:57,557
I'm going to kill Miles.

875
01:15:57,599 --> 01:16:01,394
Oh, come on, Joel.

876
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:05,565
Look at it this way.
You're making a lot of money.

877
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:08,360
You're providing your friends
with an invaluable service.

878
01:16:08,401 --> 01:16:11,613
God knows, they needed the service!

879
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:19,245
And, right now, you are one hot-shit
future enterpriser.

880
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:25,627
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.

881
01:16:26,294 --> 01:16:29,881
And... you have a girlfriend to boot.

882
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:30,882
Do I?

883
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:32,801
Phone call for Joel.

884
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:35,136
Here, I'll get it.

885
01:16:35,178 --> 01:16:38,264
Well, do I?

886
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:40,642
What do you think?

887
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:42,727
I don't know. You tell me.

888
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:46,272
Yes? No? Maybe?

889
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:48,858
Yes.

890
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,404
No.

891
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:56,950
Maybe.

892
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,247
Joel!

893
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:03,248
Dad?

894
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:05,083
Who answered the phone?

895
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,751
Just a friend, Dad.

896
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,919
Do I know her?

897
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,754
Have you ever made love on a real train?

898
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,589
I don't think so.

899
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:13,591
He's got a girl.

900
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:16,428
Let's make love on a real train.

901
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:17,595
Joel, are you there?

902
01:17:17,637 --> 01:17:22,267
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom?
Is everything all right?

903
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:23,351
Let's go.

904
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:26,438
Did I hear others there?

905
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,859
Just a few friends, Dad.

906
01:17:32,068 --> 01:17:34,612
Sounds like a party.

907
01:17:34,654 --> 01:17:36,281
A party?

908
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:38,283
Come on, let's be alone together.

909
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:43,705
I don't remember giving
permission for a party, Joel.

910
01:17:43,747 --> 01:17:46,374
Honey, can you hear me?

911
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,793
There's nothing wrong
with having friends over.

912
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:52,213
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you.

913
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:55,300
We're coming in on United,
Flight 162 at 3:30.

914
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:57,218
"Trust."

915
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,971
Seems to me if there were any logic
to our language...

916
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:04,309
..."trust" would be a four-letter word.

917
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:08,646
The evening worked out well.
We had a good cash flow.

918
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:11,983
Rutherford made a few new friends.

919
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:17,238
He said he'd do his best for me.

920
01:18:21,701 --> 01:18:25,163
Finally, it was time to close shop.

921
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:27,499
The girls were exhausted.

922
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:31,503
Lana was hungry.
She wanted to go out for a bite.

923
01:18:31,544 --> 01:18:35,090
She wanted to make love on a real train.

924
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:38,677
Who was I to say no?

925
01:18:38,718 --> 01:18:44,724
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight

926
01:18:49,062 --> 01:18:56,444
"And I've been waiting for this moment
for all my life

927
01:18:58,905 --> 01:19:01,199
"Can you feel it coming"

928
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:05,704
I thought no one was going to be here.

929
01:19:05,745 --> 01:19:08,832
Be patient.

930
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:20,969
"Well, I remember

931
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:25,140
"I remember - don't worry

932
01:19:25,181 --> 01:19:28,393
"How could I ever forget?

933
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:31,479
"It's the first time

934
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:36,109
"The last time we ever met

935
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:41,072
"But I know the reason

936
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:45,410
"Why you keep the silence up

937
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:48,747
"No, you don't fool me

938
01:19:48,788 --> 01:19:51,166
"The hurt doesn't show

939
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:53,835
"But the pain still grows

940
01:19:53,877 --> 01:19:58,882
"It's no stranger to you or me

941
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:05,638
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight

942
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:17,484
"Well, I've been waiting
for this moment for all my life

943
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:25,450
"I can feel it in the air tonight"

944
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:14,262
Hi.

945
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:16,264
They stole the goddamn house, Lana!

946
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:18,016
I'm not here right now.

947
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:20,143
But if you'll leave your name and number...

948
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:23,521
...I'll call you back as soon as possible.

949
01:24:23,563 --> 01:24:25,482
They took everything!

950
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:26,691
This is unbelievable!

951
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:30,362
My parents will be home in two hours,
Lana, and they took fucking everything!

952
01:24:30,403 --> 01:24:32,697
I don't know if you know
anything about this...

953
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:34,532
...but you have to call me right away!

954
01:24:34,574 --> 01:24:36,701
I'm at the house: KL5-2121.

955
01:24:36,743 --> 01:24:39,704
Look, you've really got to help me!

956
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:42,207
Time of your life, huh, kid?

957
01:24:42,248 --> 01:24:43,541
Where's Lana?

958
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:45,210
Maybe she's on the choo-choo.

959
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:48,129
I hear she's got this thing
about choo-choos.

960
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:50,215
I want to know who took my stuff.

961
01:24:50,256 --> 01:24:53,468
I took your stuff, Joel, are you kidding?

962
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,637
Then you listen to me, buster!

963
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,055
You a-hole!

964
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:59,474
If I don't get my stuff back...

965
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:02,018
Shit!

966
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:12,070
"A-hole?"

967
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:15,240
I want my furniture back, right now!

968
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:16,574
Now, you listen to me.

969
01:25:16,616 --> 01:25:19,994
No, no! You listen to me!

970
01:25:20,036 --> 01:25:22,539
Shit!

971
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:29,421
This is getting boring.

972
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:33,258
Can I have my furniture back? Please?

973
01:25:33,299 --> 01:25:36,761
You listen to me, you little fuck!

974
01:25:36,803 --> 01:25:39,514
You not only took my two best girls...

975
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:43,184
...you call me names and insult me!

976
01:25:43,226 --> 01:25:44,269
I'm sorry.

977
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,271
If I had any self-respect...

978
01:25:46,312 --> 01:25:48,606
...it wouldn't just be the furniture...

979
01:25:48,648 --> 01:25:54,279
...it would be your legs! Your arms!
Your head!

980
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,947
Do we understand each other?

981
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,365
Yes, we do.

982
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:01,703
No! Do we understand each other?

983
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:06,374
Yes, we understand each other.

984
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:09,794
Well, you're lucky in one respect.

985
01:26:09,836 --> 01:26:12,464
What's that?

986
01:26:12,505 --> 01:26:15,800
I like you, Joel.

987
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:19,846
Don't you know that?

988
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,980
What time is it?

989
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:31,316
It's 4:15.

990
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:32,650
I'll find a cab.

991
01:26:32,692 --> 01:26:36,154
Something must have happened.

992
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:38,698
Taxi!

993
01:26:42,994 --> 01:26:45,121
Joel, do you like music?

994
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:48,208
This is beautiful equipment.

995
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:51,002
What do you say, $300...

996
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:52,796
...amps, speakers, the works?

997
01:26:52,837 --> 01:26:53,963
It's a bargain, Joel.

998
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:58,301
If you go downtown anywhere,
it'd cost you double that.

999
01:26:58,343 --> 01:27:03,431
All right! The kid likes music!

1000
01:27:14,442 --> 01:27:16,986
How about some women's outfits?

1001
01:27:17,028 --> 01:27:19,072
You know, something for your mom?

1002
01:27:19,114 --> 01:27:20,824
Should fit her okay.

1003
01:27:20,865 --> 01:27:21,991
Yes.

1004
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:23,159
What?

1005
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:24,494
Yes, I'll buy it!

1006
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:26,496
I didn't give you a price yet.

1007
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:28,498
Can we get through this, please?

1008
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:31,042
$125.

1009
01:27:34,713 --> 01:27:36,506
That's it, you have everything.

1010
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:39,968
Wait a minute.

1011
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:43,847
What about this?

1012
01:27:43,888 --> 01:27:45,682
What's that?

1013
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:48,685
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.

1014
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:51,021
What have you got left, Joel?

1015
01:27:51,062 --> 01:27:53,189
$40.

1016
01:27:53,231 --> 01:27:56,943
I don't think I can go $40
on the artsy-fartsy thing.

1017
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:59,362
- What do you think, Vic?
- He's only got $40.

1018
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:02,615
I only have $40.

1019
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:04,868
We go $340?

1020
01:28:04,909 --> 01:28:07,120
I'll spot you the $300.

1021
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:09,372
You're good for it, right?

1022
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:10,540
Certainly.

1023
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:11,791
I think he is too.

1024
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:12,792
Here!

1025
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:15,420
Catch!

1026
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:27,724
To Joel!

1027
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:31,728
Here's wishin' you good luck
on your future as a businessman!

1028
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:38,151
Because, God knows,
you're going to need it!

1029
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,273
Don't, you'll break it!

1030
01:29:17,315 --> 01:29:21,444
That's good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1031
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:26,116
I'd put all the Chinese things together,
and the Greek on a separate shelf.

1032
01:29:26,157 --> 01:29:32,038
I don't think you should mix centuries.

1033
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:49,222
Mom! Dad! You're home!

1034
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:51,307
Where were you?

1035
01:29:51,349 --> 01:29:52,642
I was here.

1036
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:55,145
We called from the airport!

1037
01:29:55,186 --> 01:29:57,480
I must have been out back watering.

1038
01:29:57,522 --> 01:29:59,816
I thought you were coming
home tomorrow.

1039
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:02,235
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.

1040
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:04,571
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.

1041
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:07,741
I'm sure I said the 5th.

1042
01:30:07,782 --> 01:30:09,409
Give me a hand with the luggage.

1043
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:13,163
She said the 6th.

1044
01:30:14,789 --> 01:30:15,832
Joel?

1045
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:18,335
Yes, Mom?

1046
01:30:18,376 --> 01:30:23,465
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1047
01:30:25,216 --> 01:30:27,260
What happened to my egg?

1048
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:29,429
What do you mean?

1049
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:33,099
There's a crack in it!

1050
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:34,768
You're kidding!

1051
01:30:34,809 --> 01:30:36,853
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.

1052
01:30:36,895 --> 01:30:39,522
There's a small crack, inside the egg.

1053
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:40,774
What's wrong?

1054
01:30:40,815 --> 01:30:42,776
My egg is ruined.

1055
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:45,528
What happened?

1056
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:46,863
I don't know.

1057
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:49,866
You don't know.

1058
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:52,285
Mom, maybe it was there before.

1059
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:54,204
I don't think so, Joel.

1060
01:30:54,245 --> 01:30:59,209
How could you let this happen?

1061
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,460
I'm sorry.

1062
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:02,796
This is so damned irresponsible of you!

1063
01:31:02,837 --> 01:31:06,383
We'll get another one. Joel will pay for it.

1064
01:31:06,424 --> 01:31:09,219
Sure, I'll pay for it.

1065
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:13,890
Where will you get the money
to pay for something like that?

1066
01:31:13,932 --> 01:31:18,812
I'm very disappointed in you.

1067
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:25,235
She'll be all right.

1068
01:31:25,276 --> 01:31:30,865
Why don't you put in some yard work?

1069
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:33,053
Do you have something to tell me?

1070
01:32:33,595 --> 01:32:35,430
No...

1071
01:32:35,472 --> 01:32:37,724
...I don't think so.

1072
01:32:37,766 --> 01:32:43,813
I just got off the telephone
with Bill Rutherford.

1073
01:32:43,855 --> 01:32:49,861
Apparently, you two had quite a meeting.

1074
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:55,992
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1075
01:32:56,034 --> 01:32:57,410
What?

1076
01:32:57,452 --> 01:33:01,414
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1077
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:05,001
His exact words!

1078
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:06,670
That's unbelievable!

1079
01:33:06,711 --> 01:33:08,838
You're as good as in!

1080
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,674
I knew you could do it!

1081
01:33:10,715 --> 01:33:13,510
Haven't I been telling you,
sometimes you have to say:

1082
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:16,012
"What the heck!" Take some chances.

1083
01:33:16,054 --> 01:33:17,681
You were so right.

1084
01:33:17,722 --> 01:33:22,310
You've made me very proud.

1085
01:33:25,563 --> 01:33:28,441
I was just thinking...

1086
01:33:28,483 --> 01:33:33,530
...where we might be ten years from now.

1087
01:33:33,571 --> 01:33:35,573
You know what I think?

1088
01:33:35,615 --> 01:33:38,034
I think we're both going to make it big!

1089
01:33:38,076 --> 01:33:43,164
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!

1090
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:49,212
Can I ask you something?

1091
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:55,927
Was our night together...

1092
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:59,222
...just to set up...

1093
01:33:59,264 --> 01:34:03,184
...Vicki and Guido?

1094
01:34:10,233 --> 01:34:12,527
No.

1095
01:34:12,944 --> 01:34:17,073
You don't believe me, do you?

1096
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:20,160
My name is Russell Bitterman.
I'm from Wheaton High School.

1097
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:24,914
Our product is a paper-towel
holder that sells for $8.95.

1098
01:34:24,956 --> 01:34:30,837
We made a profit of $850 last semester.

1099
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:38,762
I don't want you to get hurt.

1100
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:44,184
My name is Evonne Williams.
We sell decorative planters for $7.

1101
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:50,106
We made a profit of $500 last semester.

1102
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:53,443
Guess we won't see each other for awhile.

1103
01:34:53,485 --> 01:34:56,196
I know.

1104
01:34:56,488 --> 01:34:58,198
Are you going straight home now?

1105
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,116
I don't know. Why?

1106
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:04,788
It might be nice if we spent
the evening together.

1107
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:07,791
I'd really like that.

1108
01:35:07,832 --> 01:35:11,461
How much have you got on you?

1109
01:35:11,503 --> 01:35:13,088
How much have I got on me?

1110
01:35:13,129 --> 01:35:14,964
I've got $20.

1111
01:35:15,006 --> 01:35:17,217
$20, Lana?

1112
01:35:17,258 --> 01:35:19,469
What are we going to do about this?

1113
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:23,181
- Can I send it to you?
- Can you send it to me?

1114
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:25,183
'Cause I don't have that much here.

1115
01:35:25,225 --> 01:35:26,810
How about I write you a check?

1116
01:35:26,851 --> 01:35:31,481
Do you think I'd accept a check from you?
What am I, stupid?

1117
01:35:31,523 --> 01:35:34,818
I have a bond at the bank.

1118
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:37,487
My name is Joel Goodson.

1119
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:40,490
I deal in human fulfillment.

1120
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:44,828
I grossed over $8,000 in one night.

1121
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:50,083
The time of your life, huh, kid?
