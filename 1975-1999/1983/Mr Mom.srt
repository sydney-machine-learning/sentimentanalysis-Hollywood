1
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,012
Honey.
Wake up.

2
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:53,980
You sleep okay?
Oh! Me?

3
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:57,018
Never better. Like a log.
Good, 'cause your shower's ready.

4
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,156
Oh, thanks.

5
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:15,674
Morning.

6
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:21,144
Morning, Alex.

7
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:23,680
Morning.
Hi, Mommy. Did you sleep good?

8
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:28,185
Mm-hmm. I'll wake Kenny.
Okay, but don't touch his woobie.

9
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:30,705
It's gonna be a beautiful
day in Detroit today.

10
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:33,156
Weather man says we're
going to have sunny skies.

11
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:36,695
There's a lot of traffic out there.
A lot of beautiful cars, though.

12
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:39,197
We want you to roll up the window,
lean back and enjoy all the good sounds...

13
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,165
We're gonna be playing
this morning.

14
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,702
Of course I always play your favorites.
Alex! Don't.

15
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,571
'Cause I'm such a nice guy.
No!

16
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:58,717
Ah, damn.

17
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:07,227
Morning, baby.

18
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,736
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

19
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:21,742
How did you sleep?
Hmm? Should we go get daddy?

20
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:24,361
Shall we? Oops!

21
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,714
There you are.

22
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:29,967
Morning. Good morning.
Morning, campers.

23
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,219
How's everybody?

24
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:37,106
Hiya, Megan.
Great. Trucks.

25
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:47,235
What are...

26
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:50,238
What are we watching here,
Kenny?

27
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,740
Robots. Thank you.

28
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:56,993
Thanks, babe.

29
00:03:56,994 --> 00:04:00,212
Okay.
Here's the joke of the day.

30
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,749
What's green and rides
through the west?

31
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:05,637
The lone pickle.

32
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:08,073
Okay.
They're onto me, hon.

33
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,258
We're all onto you, honey.

34
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,262
That's them. I gotta go.

35
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:17,731
Okay, baby. Bye.
Thanks.

36
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,019
Don't change a thing. Leave that
face exactly like that, all right?

37
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:24,272
I don't want it washed by the time
I come home, 'cause it looks great.

38
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:39,871
Call me later!

39
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,999
Oh, man. What's the record for
the least amount of sleep ever?

40
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,754
I think Lindbergh has it.
Well, I think I beat him last night.

41
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:56,757
You heard anything, Jinx?

42
00:04:57,257 --> 00:05:00,225
If I did, wouldn't I tell you guys?
Not necessarily.

43
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,762
that's right. you didn't tell lou until
after he chipped in for gas money.

44
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:06,767
Hey, fellas, I'm telling you.
It's as simple as this.

45
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:09,519
If you can't sell cars,
you can't pay people.

46
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:14,239
Now, come on, relax.

47
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:19,279
I like splitting gas money four ways.

48
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:52,278
Hey.
Hey, Butler.

49
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:55,282
How you doin', gents?
Havin' a good time?

50
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:58,319
I love it. I love comin' down here,
watchin' something go...

51
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:00,821
from the drawing board
to the assembly line.

52
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:03,791
It's a treat.
Yeah, it's thrilling for us too.

53
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:07,294
Yeah. Real thrilling. What's the
matter, boys? You look depressed.

54
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,333
You worried about the lions? They're
slow starters. Don't worry. It's pre-season.

55
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:16,839
Hey, we ain't worried about the lions!
What we're worried about is the lines.

56
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,806
Amen.
Lines?

57
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:23,344
Yeah. Unemployment lines, welfare lines,
food lines. You know, those lines?

58
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,849
Lines, lines.
Yeah.

59
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,855
Me and my wife went to the movies
the other night. We saw Rocky.

60
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:33,856
And I'm watching this movie
and I'm thinking...

61
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:37,109
There's something about this
movie that reminds me of work.

62
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,362
Which Rocky was it?

63
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:42,364
One or two? Or three?

64
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:44,366
Uh, one, I think.
I don't know.

65
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:45,868
Who was he fightin'?

66
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:48,871
- Hey, did he have a mohawk?
- Like Mr. T?

67
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,340
I don't know. I don't remember.
The point is,

68
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,877
here's a guy who's taking
a pretty bad beating, you know?

69
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,313
He's up against the ropes,
his eye's cut...

70
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,747
Was his manager
dead or alive? Yeah.

71
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:01,884
All right, forget Rocky. Forget I
brought it up. Get it outta your head.

72
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:07,390
The point is, when you're down,
you're not necessarily out.

73
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,892
You know... I mean...

74
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:14,898
You gotta hang tough.
I don't... I don't know.

75
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,402
Jack Butler,
report to the staff office.

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,904
I gotta go, guys.
See you later.

77
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,906
Well, hang tough, baby.
Yeah, be Rocky!

78
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,409
# Watch his left!

79
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,413
They're gonna
knock him out, baby.

80
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,416
Think so?
He didn't see Rocky.

81
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,292
Larry! Larry!

82
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,680
Are you crazy?
What'd you do that for?

83
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,433
Why didn't you tell me this
morning I was being canned?

84
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,438
I couldn't say anything until
it was official! Wait a minute!

85
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,941
Wait a minute, guys.
Wait.

86
00:07:55,942 --> 00:08:00,411
Oh, Jinx. You did it, didn't you?

87
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,449
You fired these guys after
all they've contributed. Jack.

88
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,952
Aw, don't "Jack" me.
After the support! Jack.

89
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,763
Aw, man, the devotion
they gave you.

90
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:12,574
You're fired too.
Now you fire me.

91
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,827
I... I'm fired?

92
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,464
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill ya! You...

93
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,967
You're not fired.

94
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,720
Technically furloughed.
Why don't you give me a break!

95
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:27,474
I'm telling you, there's blood
all over my slide rule!

96
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,978
None of it's yours, Jinx.
Aw, come on, come on.

97
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,983
Something's gonna turn up.
You guys are terrific engineers.

98
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:38,503
You're too damn good not
to catch on somewhere.

99
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,987
Where am I gonna catch on?
Where we gonna catch on?

100
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:43,455
Nagasaki?
The Ruhr Valley?

101
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,209
You're not exactly walking
out of here empty-handed.

102
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,367
You've got your full severance.
You got your profit sharing.

103
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:55,003
Here. Guess what.
A surprise.

104
00:08:57,005 --> 00:09:01,975
Full pro rata refund
for this month's gas.

105
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,012
Great. There's only one more
thing I want. What's that?

106
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:08,784
Disability!
Oh, no! No! Oh, no! No!

107
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,485
Larry! Larry!
Come on! No! No!

108
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,022
Keep that sense of humor,
buddy. It's critical. Hey! Jinx!

109
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,991
Oh, no!
Hold it!

110
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,493
Larry! hey!
Get the valium.

111
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:24,532
# Plop, plop, fizz, fizz oh,
what a relief it is #

112
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:32,040
See you guys.
Jack, keep in touch.

113
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,508
Uh, I will, Larry.
You all right?

114
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:37,797
Oh, yeah. Okay. 'Cause
remember what Jinx said.

115
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,050
Keep that sense of humor.
It's critical. Humor.

116
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,552
Love you, Jack!

117
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:57,532
Alex, Kenny, come on.
Hurry up!

118
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:02,071
That's good. Step to.
Hup, two, three, four. That's it.

119
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:04,824
Nice, boys.
You look real nice.

120
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:07,076
Does daddy know
he got fired yet?

121
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:09,578
Yes, but we're not gonna mention
it to him, are we, honey?

122
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:12,582
We want daddy to feel good,
don't we? You hear that?

123
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:15,333
He's coming now.
Everybody smile real big.

124
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,587
Hi, dad!

125
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:22,093
Hey. Hi.
Boy, you guys look nice.

126
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:27,096
What, do you all have dates
or something?

127
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,813
We heard you got fired.

128
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:31,600
Laid off.
Just laid off, remember?

129
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,103
Technically, furloughed, sport.

130
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:36,855
You're not a bum, are you, daddy?
No, but I'm workin' on it.

131
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:39,108
You want my woobie?

132
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:42,730
Actually, I kinda would like it.
But instead I'll take a kiss.

133
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:46,582
Okay, come on, everybody.
Let's eat dinner.

134
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:48,735
We're having special dinner.
What are we having?

135
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:51,121
Colonel chicken.
We can't afford that!

136
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:54,125
Yea! Let's enjoy it.
It may be our last.

137
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:17,149
You know, I know this sounds crazy,
but I actually feel great.

138
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,984
I don't know why. I don't
know why, but I feel great.

139
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:23,654
I do, you know. Because, I don't know,
now I'll have the time...

140
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:26,157
to do some work around the house
I've been wanting to get to.

141
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:30,162
And, you know, we're in pretty
good shape. Yep, we are, for a while.

142
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:34,667
Wait, what do you think? I'll never get
another job again? Don't worry about it.

143
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:38,670
I already put the word out.
What would you say if I did too?

144
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,690
Did too do what?

145
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,640
I put the word out.

146
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:45,643
I have a couple of years' experience
in advertising. I have a college degree.

147
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:49,180
There's no reason I shouldn't try to get a
job myself. Have I been missing something?

148
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:51,683
I mean, has your phone
been ringing off the hook?

149
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:54,653
Well, no, Jack. You think you're
gonna get a job before I do?

150
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,690
Oh, this isn't a contest. No, hon.
This'll be good. This is a good idea.

151
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,657
We'll make it a contest.
It'll be fun. What?

152
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:03,195
I'll bet you a hundred to one
you don't get a job before I do.

153
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:05,664
Jack... okay, come on, doll face.
Give me a dollar.

154
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:08,201
I don't even have a dollar. Oh, you
wanna bet, but you don't have a dollar?

155
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,704
Hey, I don't wanna bet. Hey, I thought
somebody said they wanted to bet.

156
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:13,706
Wait till I get the kids.
I don't bet. I don't believe in bets.

157
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,193
You're bettin' now.
Alex, Kenny! Come here.

158
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:19,696
I want you to know it's comin'
out of my severance pay too.

159
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:26,202
Come on, guys. Hurry. this is gonna be fun.
I'm makin' mommy a bet.

160
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,706
Daddy's betting mommy a hundred
dollars to just her one dollar...

161
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,208
Wow. That she doesn't
get a job before me.

162
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,213
Kenny, hold the money. I better
hold it, dad. Money makes him crazy.

163
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,597
Good point.
It isn't healthy.

164
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:40,851
Well, it may not be healthy,
but it's fun. Right, guys?

165
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,720
Oh, Jack. Can we bet too?
Absolutely!

166
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:45,472
Yea!
Yea!

167
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,692
Take the money, Caroline.

168
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,696
Jack, I don't want the money.

169
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:56,666
Look, you won. A bet's a bet!

170
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,668
Jack, I don't take bets,
and I don't want your money.

171
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:02,672
Aren't you being a little hard
on yourself? No! It's fine!

172
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:05,210
I mean, you have applied to everything
on wheels from Toyota to Schwinn.

173
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:08,104
You're gonna get a job
any day now. Really.

174
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,964
Uh-oh, I'm going to be late.
My first day.

175
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:14,285
I want to make a very good
impression. How do I look?

176
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,604
You look great. You're gonna
make a great impression.

177
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:22,191
Now, do you wanna go over
that list one more time?

178
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,731
No, I don't wanna go over the list!
Okay. Let's go over the list.

179
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:30,236
Remember, when Kenny starts talking to his
breakfast, that means he's finished, right?

180
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,739
Alex has school at 7:30.
His pickup is 1:00 sharp. 7:30. 1:00.

181
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,206
When Megan starts rubbing her
ears, it's time for her nap. Nap.

182
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:40,745
But don't let her sleep past 11:30, because
she won't go down for her afternoon nap.

183
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:44,249
Wait. Will she rub her ears again?
No. Just in the morning.

184
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,754
And please don't let her sit around
in a wet diaper. Obviously, hon.

185
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:51,222
Kenny, he'll pretty much take
care of himself, won't you?

186
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:53,510
Just keep him busy. Give him
his tinkertoys or his coloring book.

187
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:57,227
I think Alex will be a little
helper, won't you?

188
00:13:57,263 --> 00:14:00,766
Sweetie. All right, just relax.
There's nothing to this, you know.

189
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:04,020
We got it covered.
Right, guys? Okay.

190
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:07,238
Oh, boy, am I gonna miss you guys.

191
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:10,276
- Take it easy on daddy. Remember,
he's a rookie. - Bye, mom.

192
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,779
Bye, honey.
Mommy?

193
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,781
It's a jungle out there.

194
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:17,249
Very funny, Jack.

195
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:20,287
I don't know where he gets this.
On second thought, I will take this money.

196
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:24,173
I might need it for lunch
or something special. Okay.

197
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:28,295
Actually, a lot of men would love to have
this kind of time to spend with their kids.

198
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,262
Hon, you're looking at one.

199
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm a regular Phil Donahue here.
Yes, you are.

200
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:39,307
Okay, okay.
Come here. Okay.

201
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,811
Go get 'em.

202
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:47,816
Oh, thanks for the loan.

203
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:00,794
Dad, you passed it!

204
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,832
Passed what? We're right on time.
But you're doing it wrong.

205
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,800
Mommy doesn't do it
like this.

206
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:11,339
We're gonna do it the Jack Butler
method. What is this? This is nuts.

207
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,864
Why are they all honking?

208
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,867
Because you're doing it wrong.

209
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:26,155
Tell me I'm doing it wrong.
I know how to do this.

210
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:34,879
Hi, Jack. I'm Annette.

211
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:38,918
- Hi.
- You're doing it wrong.

212
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,885
See?

213
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,924
This is what i tell all my new mommies:
We enter from the south...

214
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,891
and we exit from the north.

215
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,893
And we do just the reverse
when we pick up.

216
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,995
This way our little ones
don't have to walk

217
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:52,903
between the cars to
get to the learning facility.

218
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:55,901
Okay, move it out,
and remember, south to drop off,

219
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:59,438
north to pick up. pick 'em up.
Okay! That's a good system.

220
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,447
South to drop off, moron!

221
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:42,984
Actually, I'm very excited to be going
back to work, especially here with Ron.

222
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,988
Ron?
And who would Ron be?

223
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:48,954
Oh, Ron Richardson.

224
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,492
Everyone here at the
Richardson-Frankel agency...

225
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:54,461
calls him Mr. Richardson.

226
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, he asked me to call him Ron.

227
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,468
And when was that?
In what context?

228
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:03,506
In the context of my
interview at lunch.

229
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,974
Lunch?
Mm-hmm.

230
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:10,012
Well, now, before we go in here,
let me give you some advice.

231
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:12,515
Keep your mouth shut
and your ears open,

232
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:14,517
and you just might
learn something.

233
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:26,529
You want to knock it off?

234
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,787
Ron, what is your position?

235
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,542
Thank you.

236
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:45,049
My father founded this agency
on schooner tuna.

237
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,553
It's the cornerstone
of all our accounts.

238
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:52,521
So my position is,

239
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:57,812
somebody better figure out a way to
sell some tuna fish pretty damn quick.

240
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:06,187
We have people to do that.

241
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,574
Sorry. Habit.

242
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:14,579
Everybody, uh, please
welcome Caroline Butler.

243
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:17,414
- Hello.
- Hi, Caroline.

244
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:22,586
Since you're probably the only one in
the room that got a decent night's sleep,

245
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:24,554
maybe you could have
a fresh opinion.

246
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:28,594
Do, uh, any of these layouts...
does anything make sense to you?

247
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,596
Uh...

248
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:34,849
I'm not qualified to judge anything,
really. It's my first day, and...

249
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,103
- You ever eat tuna fish?
- Yes.

250
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:40,606
You're qualified.

251
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:46,111
Okay, well, I uh... let's see here.

252
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:53,619
Well, uh, this is very good.
I like... it's mermaids?

253
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,586
Original.
Caroline.

254
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:59,125
"Yum, yum, tuna bits. "
That's very funny.

255
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,628
Cut the crap.

256
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:04,095
Right.

257
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,883
Look, you want me to be
really honest with you?

258
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:12,137
No. Lie to him.
He likes it.

259
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:18,646
Well, frankly, none of this stuff
would influence me. All right?

260
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,764
Ooh.
That's good.

261
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,654
Come on, Ron. She doesn't know
a tuna fish from a cheerio.

262
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:29,405
Damn good thing we don't have
the cheerio account.

263
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,661
When was the last time any of you
people were in a supermarket?

264
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:38,649
Harriet housewife.

265
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:43,755
Good morning, shoppers.
We have some specials this morning,

266
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,588
and we'd like to let you know
about them.

267
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:50,009
Over in the frozen food section...
Kenny, where are the eggs?

268
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,628
Over there, dad.

269
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:58,517
- Remember, we're a volume store...
- I have the right of way.

270
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,891
Right. Sorry. Here.
We'll settle out of court.

271
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:05,895
Oh, weirdo.

272
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:11,782
Irv! Clean up in aisle four.

273
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,651
Aisle four, check.

274
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:21,160
Irv!
Clean up in produce!

275
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:23,626
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,664
Kenny! Did I tell you not
to touch the grapefruit?

277
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:29,632
Next. May I have a half
a pound of ham?

278
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:34,172
Boiled, baked, smoked, salt-cured,
sugar-cured, prosciutto or westphalian?

279
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:37,175
Forget it. Just tell you
what, just give me, uh...

280
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:39,642
give me a half pound of salami.

281
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:43,181
Italian, kosher, hard, pork,
beef, cotto or what?

282
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:47,150
Uh... just get bologna, mister.

283
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:50,690
I'll tell you what. Just give me
a quarter pound of cheese.

284
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:53,943
American, bleu, cream, cottage,

285
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:57,161
gouda, edam, provolone,
romano, swiss.

286
00:20:57,196 --> 00:21:02,202
- Your entire cheddar family. - Can you
run the hams back one more time?

287
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:04,704
I just want...

288
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,846
Stay right here, okay?
Comin' back.

289
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:28,227
Half pound of salami, half pound of swiss,
half pound Virginia ham, two celery.

290
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:31,232
- I think these are on special.
- Doesn't matter. Go ahead.

291
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:35,235
Let me check. Irv, are these
kotex maxi pads on special?

292
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:39,740
- Never mind, Irv! Forget it.
- Kotex, 19 cents off.

293
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:41,992
Thanks, Irv.

294
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:44,210
All right, Ken.

295
00:21:44,246 --> 00:21:48,249
My baby!
Who are you?

296
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:52,253
Steven. Mom!
Kenny!

297
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:54,719
Ken!
Mom!

298
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:59,760
Here, eat this spaghetti.
Irv, spaghetti on aisle nine.

299
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:03,264
Spaghetti, aisle nine. Check.

300
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:06,233
Kenny!

301
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:09,521
Hey, I'll trade ya.
My kid for yours.

302
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:12,774
Thank you.
I don't have any kids!

303
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:20,030
- Did you see my little girl?
- Yeah. She's adorable.

304
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:23,284
- She's lost. - You left a
child in a shopping cart?

305
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:27,922
Irv, one lost child.
Lost child alert.

306
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,759
There she is!

307
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:34,796
There's your daddy.
She's yours and I'm Joan.

308
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:38,800
Hi. Thanks. Caroline told me you'd
be around. Can I give you a hand?

309
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,303
You can give me both of 'em.
I don't know what the hell I'm doin'.

310
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:44,271
Irv, clean up on aisle seven!

311
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:48,312
Irv, we were never
in aisle seven. Honest!

312
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:51,779
Not so easy, is it?
Boy, I'll say.

313
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:54,317
Might even be the toughest job
in the entire world.

314
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:59,322
Bends your back, drives you nuts,
and it makes your boobs droop.

315
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:02,825
So don't be ashamed
about asking for help.

316
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:06,295
Mommy training can be very,
very tricky, and I can help...

317
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,834
With sitters and shopping and menus,
and even if you just want to talk.

318
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:17,340
Here's my number. All right. Thank you.
What's this say underneath?

319
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:20,226
Any time.

320
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,347
Okay. Kenny!
What are you doing?

321
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:30,045
# He's married #

322
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,357
# So were we once #

323
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:47,837
# Oh, Susanna oh,
don't you cry for me #

324
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:52,877
# 'Cause I come from Alabama
with my banjo on my knee #

325
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:55,846
Where is everybody?
Up here.

326
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,886
# Susanna oh,
don't you cry for me #

327
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:04,889
# We're coming... #
Hi, everybody. Mommy's home.

328
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:07,391
Hi, mommy. How was your day?

329
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:11,897
Oh, it was, uh... it was terrible.

330
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:14,900
I wasn't there five minutes and
I was thrown into this meeting...

331
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,491
with people yelling and
screaming at each other,

332
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:19,744
and then they were
screaming at me,

333
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:21,371
and there's a secretary that
hates me for no reason.

334
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:24,293
- Want me to go and kick a little
ass, honey? - Yeah, dad!

335
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:28,879
All right. The only one that
was even civil to me was Ron.

336
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:33,679
Ron? You know, Mr. Richardson? He
actually asked for my opinion, and when

337
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:37,202
I told him honestly how I felt about
something, Ron liked what I had to say.

338
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:40,175
He did. Ron and his group
are flying to the plant tomorrow,

339
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,429
and they're gonna tour it,
and I was invited to go.

340
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,432
Is than an unbelievable
first day or what?

341
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,066
I can't believe it.
How 'bout you guys?

342
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,902
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

343
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:54,573
We can't believe it, hon.
None of us can. We're stunned.

344
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:58,944
Honey, I can't believe this.

345
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:02,447
Oh. Well, I didn't want
his feet to get wet.

346
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:14,962
Somebody must have died.

347
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,430
Why?
There's a limousine out front.

348
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:20,432
Oh. You didn't say anything
about a limousine last night.

349
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:23,971
Ron said he was sending a car,
but he didn't say anything about a limo!

350
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,973
Tell him I'll be right down.

351
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:30,727
Ron. Oh, Ron.

352
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,481
Hey, Ron.

353
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:39,988
Whoa. Damn it.

354
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:45,993
Well, hello down there.

355
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:50,998
Why don't you run and tell your
mommy that Mr. Richardson is here.

356
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:55,505
Stay right here. I'm not supposed
to let strangers in the house.

357
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:17,026
How you doin'?
You must be Ron Richardson.

358
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:19,028
I'm Jack Butler.
Nice to meet you.

359
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,782
- Pleased to meet you.
- Huh?

360
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,918
I said, I'm pleased...

361
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,536
to meet you.

362
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:29,538
I'm just waiting for Caroline.

363
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,041
Well, Ron, you know women.

364
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:36,046
Yeah, I like to think I do.

365
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,548
Want a beer?

366
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:40,934
It's 7:00 in the morning.

367
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:44,519
Scotch?

368
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:48,022
Not during working hours.
Oh, I'm sorry, pal.

369
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,559
No problem. come on over here.
Let me show you what I'm doin'.

370
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,065
Takin' advantage of some of the time
off to add a whole new wing on here.

371
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,067
I'm gonna rip these walls out,
and, uh, of course, rewire it.

372
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:01,036
You gonna make it all 220?

373
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:03,573
Yeah, 220, 221.
Whatever it takes.

374
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:06,960
You sound like a pretty handy guy.

375
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:11,082
Yeah. well, I like to do
a little bit of everything, Ron.

376
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:14,969
I write poetry, I paint,
sculpt and... oh.

377
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:20,056
Oh, Caroline.
Don't you look nice.

378
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,058
Thanks. I'm sorry
if I kept you waiting.

379
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:25,097
Oh, not at all. I was just having a
little chat here with your hubby, uh...

380
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:29,066
- Jack.
- Jack.

381
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,102
Yeah, he's quite a guy.

382
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:36,491
So, I guess we better get going.

383
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:38,609
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Jack, a real pleasure.

384
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,613
Ron.

385
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,122
Very nice outfit, honey.
Thank you.

386
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:59,631
Honey, if you call and I'm not here,
I'll be at the gym or at the gun club.

387
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:11,827
How'd you like a little trim
on that mustache, Ron?

388
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:15,866
Humphries is tough. He's probably
the toughest client we've got.

389
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,334
But, you know, I think you've
got two things going for you.

390
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:21,598
Number one, your experience
as a homemaker.

391
00:28:21,895 --> 00:28:23,891
You're fresh from the
trenches of consumerism.

392
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:26,842
And... oh, thank you very much.

393
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:31,131
Oh, boy. and, number two,
you've got a...

394
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:37,387
Let's just say you're an
extremely attractive woman.

395
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,894
Well, thank you.
And my husband thanks you too.

396
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:45,895
Yeah, I'm glad you brought up,
uh... what's his name?

397
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:48,265
- Uh...
- Jack.

398
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:50,365
Jack. Uh...

399
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,404
- What do you mean? - I mean we're
gonna be working long, hard hours,

400
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:58,374
and you might be coming home
pretty late at night.

401
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:02,914
And, well, if there's gonna be a problem,
I want you to tell me about it right now.

402
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,918
Well, there's not gonna be
any problem, see?

403
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:08,806
Jack supports everything I do.

404
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:13,079
As a woman, in my career,
as an executive, he supports me.

405
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:15,927
And if we can agree that you
are an executive, mm-hmm.

406
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,929
Then you can stop
cutting my steak.

407
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:22,934
Oh! Hmm.
Sorry.

408
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:00,973
I don't think we can fit any more.

409
00:30:00,974 --> 00:30:02,941
Sure, we can.

410
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:05,443
We can get some more in there.

411
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:09,483
You know, when your dad was in the
army, we had to run a tight ship.

412
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,984
There were no ships in the army.

413
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:16,489
Just put the laundry in.
Dad, can we fix lunch?

414
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:20,993
Sure. Anything but, uh, tuna.

415
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:23,997
"Add here. "

416
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,512
Wait a minute.

417
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:41,514
Save a couple of steps here.

418
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,046
Give it everything, I guess.

419
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:36,571
Butler? You got a problem with
your horizontal hold? I don't know.

420
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:38,539
Your wife says you do.

421
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:41,075
Well, she ought to know.
Come on in.

422
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:53,589
I'll be right back.
I get 45 bucks an hour.

423
00:31:57,594 --> 00:32:02,097
Oh, Megan. You're makin'
me crazy, baby.

424
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:05,102
You're makin' me nuts.
Da-da.

425
00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:08,104
Yeah, yeah, I love you.
But you're making me crazy.

426
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:10,107
Stay. Hey, Kenny.

427
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:13,110
Go keep an eye on your sister.
Play with her or something. All right?

428
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:15,077
Go watch TV.

429
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,945
You want some chili?

430
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,616
No, thanks. Hey, where's your
mom keep the vacuum cleaner?

431
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:22,619
You mean jaws?

432
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,121
Mom calls the vacuum
cleaner "Jaws"?

433
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:27,624
Yeah.
Where is it?

434
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:30,128
Over there.

435
00:32:39,636 --> 00:32:42,139
Jaws.

436
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:59,658
Exterminator.
I can't hear you.

437
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:02,161
Exterminator.

438
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:08,667
- What?
- Exterminator!

439
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:12,421
- Go to the front door.
- Okay.

440
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:21,680
Come in.

441
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:27,302
Hi. I'm here to adjust the pilot on
your water heater. Okay by me.

442
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,689
Hi. Anything wrong?

443
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,692
No, no.
Fine, fine.

444
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:25,363
Dad, help!

445
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:55,278
Dad! Dad!

446
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:00,282
Dad!

447
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:06,287
Dad, my woobie!

448
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:09,791
Okay, Kenny. Now look.
Run, Kenny, run!

449
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,297
Whoa!

450
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:47,330
You crazy?
You fed a baby chili?

451
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:17,361
Where's mommy keep
the extra diapers?

452
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:22,868
Hey! Cowards.

453
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:32,377
Holy mackerel!
Aw, man.

454
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:07,162
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:14,670
Well, I'm glad somebody
had a good day.

456
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:23,930
Have a seat. I'll call you when
he's ready. Thank you.

457
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,683
How about roasted
eggplant? I don't...

458
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:31,436
Well, does your wife like seafood?
Seafood smells up the kitchen,

459
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:33,406
and it can take hours
to get rid of the odor.

460
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,003
No, how about something simple?

461
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,792
I got a hamburger 'Wellington'
that's out of this world.

462
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:41,949
Great. Let me have it. Okay. Start with two
pounds of ground round, lean and mean.

463
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:44,047
Brown it in some butter.
Yeah.

464
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:46,452
Pardon me. Could you
use margarine in that?

465
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:50,458
Oh, no... well, butter's my personal choice.
But butter can scorch.

466
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:53,961
- Higgins, you're next.
- Why don't you go ahead?

467
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:57,465
And I'll go after you.
You were here first.

468
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,434
That's okay. I...
I have no place to go,

469
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:03,472
and besides that, there's not a job
available anywhere in this city.

470
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:08,475
Okay, Butler.
I guess you're next.

471
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:14,482
I'd sure like to have a copy of that
when I come back. Uh, sure. Yeah?

472
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:16,484
Drain all the excess fat.

473
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:26,244
Well, you're mad, aren't you?
I'm not mad.

474
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:28,997
I'm not mad. It's just not where
I want to be right now.

475
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:31,767
Mm-hmm. Well, Jack,
I can't not go.

476
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:34,501
Please do it for me, would you?

477
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:37,004
You know how many of these
things I went to for you?

478
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,972
A lot.

479
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:41,510
We'll stay ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

480
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:44,513
Ten minutes?
Fifteen, tops.

481
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:47,516
All right. Okay.
Fair enough.

482
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:50,386
But if we stay longer than that,
we pull the old aunt Emily.

483
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,521
Okay. The aunt Emily.
Right.

484
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:59,994
Wow.
What a house.

485
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:03,032
Yeah. Probably mortgaged
to the eyeballs.

486
00:39:03,283 --> 00:39:07,538
Not this one. His great-grandfather,
commander Richardson, built it.

487
00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:09,539
Yeah. Hand-me-down.

488
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,010
Oh, thank you.

489
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:18,048
You must be pretty darn proud
of our little Caroline, huh?

490
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:19,529
Oh, yeah.

491
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:23,554
We're, uh, very proud of her. The children
are, and we're all real proud at home.

492
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,557
She earned that promotion,
I can assure you, Jack.

493
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:29,559
It was a little promotion. I forgot to
tell you about it. It was no big deal.

494
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,027
Ladies and gentlemen.

495
00:39:32,063 --> 00:39:36,566
Welcome to the Richardson-Frankel
annual corporate olympics!

496
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,536
Butler, you're a sportsman.

497
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:45,576
I was kind of counting on you to
take part in this. Spouses are eligible.

498
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:48,411
Yeah. I don't know.
Uh... aw, come on.

499
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:51,264
Nobody takes it seriously.
It's just good clean fun.

500
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:54,084
I know, Ron. Normally,
I'd say yeah, but I'll tell you,

501
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:57,088
we've got to get over to see,
uh, Caroline's aunt Emily.

502
00:39:57,122 --> 00:39:58,589
She's... dying.
Sick.

503
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:00,557
Dead.

504
00:40:00,592 --> 00:40:03,093
Well, why don't you stick around
for a few minutes anyway,

505
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:05,596
and you can, uh, watch
with the rest of the wives.

506
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:07,715
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean families.

507
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:15,608
Boys, run down to the car and get dad's
sweatpants and shoes and stuff out.

508
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:19,478
Hey, all right.
I'll stick around for a while.

509
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,013
Looks like we got ourselves
a little competition this year.

510
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:31,438
- Butler is a real jock. - Oh, boy.
That's all we need. - Yeah.

511
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:40,599
Relax, Butler.
You're not gonna win anyway.

512
00:40:40,634 --> 00:40:42,566
Why not?
He that good?

513
00:40:42,602 --> 00:40:45,605
He's the boss.
It's his tournament. You get it?

514
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:48,608
Yeah, but I don't work for him.

515
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:51,111
No, but your wife does.

516
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:07,484
What's he doing?
Winning.

517
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:33,828
You threw it, didn't you?
You did good, dad.

518
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,831
Thanks.

519
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,832
I owe you one, Jack.

520
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,336
Come on. Let's go.
Sure you're okay?

521
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:43,839
Yeah.

522
00:43:50,846 --> 00:43:53,849
I did it!
I really did it!

523
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:29,849
Kevin, please.

524
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:32,854
Just kiss me once more.

525
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,893
You know what that's going
to lead to, don't you?

526
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:38,396
I... I want it to lead there.

527
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:41,899
I want to feel alive again.

528
00:44:45,903 --> 00:44:48,906
I can't believe people
actually watch this stuff.

529
00:44:54,411 --> 00:44:57,415
So I'm not the father of the child.

530
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:01,419
Well, that's some consolation.

531
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:05,423
Just who is the culprit?

532
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:08,391
You don't wanna know.
Let me guess.

533
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:11,428
Probably the deceased Mr. Cashman.
Ha. Wrong, Vic.

534
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:14,898
Wrong.
Nikki doesn't even love you.

535
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:18,237
Vic, open your eyes. buddy. She's been
makin' it with your friend Kevin.

536
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:20,939
- You mean Kevin bancroft?
- That's exactly who I mean.

537
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,906
Watch. She's gonna
blame it on you now.

538
00:45:22,942 --> 00:45:27,946
You threw me at him. You let him know it was
perfectly fine to take me to San Francisco.

539
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:29,949
Only he took me to bed first,
and it's your fault.

540
00:45:30,548 --> 00:45:33,951
Did I tell ya? I knew it.

541
00:45:33,952 --> 00:45:36,956
Wake up, Vic! She already
buried one husband.

542
00:45:37,456 --> 00:45:40,958
Do you think I'm gonna let that get
in the record for everybody to see?

543
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:44,213
Or for the child to find out later on?

544
00:45:44,248 --> 00:45:47,431
Then we'll just have
a no-fault divorce.

545
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:49,968
We don't get along.
It's certainly true enough.

546
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:52,971
Nikki, I won't do it.
I've been thinking about this.

547
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:54,438
Dad?
Yeah?

548
00:45:54,473 --> 00:45:57,977
This is cold, and the cheese
isn't hardly melted down.

549
00:45:58,577 --> 00:46:00,979
We'll try to make this work.
Okay. Kvetch.

550
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,950
I've got a stake in this kid.

551
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:07,452
And I'm gonna stick around
to make sure he's okay.

552
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:09,989
- There you go.
- All you're interested in is the baby.

553
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,492
The baby's more important to you
than Caroline?

554
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:14,993
Right. My own flesh and blood.

555
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:18,999
You're such a fool.
That's right! I'm a fool.

556
00:46:19,408 --> 00:46:20,903
Daddy, my woobie's ripped.

557
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:23,792
Ken, you know what?
Maybe it's time to get rid of the woobie.

558
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:27,005
- No, no, no!
- Okay, all right!

559
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:31,511
Gimme it. The dad'll help
if he wants that baby.

560
00:46:35,915 --> 00:46:38,018
It's more than just pride, Nikki.

561
00:46:38,419 --> 00:46:41,522
- There's too much easy marriage
and divorce. - Here you go. Good as new.

562
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:45,026
Okay. I'd appreciate it if you
guys kept it down, okay?

563
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:49,028
Because, uh, Nikki's gonna get the
results of her blood test back today.

564
00:46:49,029 --> 00:46:51,533
You'll have other children with
Caroline! That might happen...

565
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:54,535
Is it Kevin's baby?
Not sure.

566
00:46:55,037 --> 00:46:57,503
Kevin's a skunk.

567
00:46:57,538 --> 00:47:01,042
But Kevin gets all the girls.
He sure got Nikki.

568
00:47:01,043 --> 00:47:04,011
My mother doesn't love my father,

569
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:06,547
but we've managed
to make a life together.

570
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,051
So you can just forget
about this annulment...

571
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:13,554
because I'm not gonna do it.
Yeah? Hi, Joan. How you doin'?

572
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:16,825
Uh, it's gotta be Kevin's.

573
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,062
Victor?
How can it be Victor?

574
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,530
No, he had a vasectomy.

575
00:47:22,564 --> 00:47:26,367
It didn't take?
Are you kidding me?

576
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,522
Dad!
Hold on a minute!

577
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:32,974
Ken, give me that sword!

578
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:43,836
Okay, I've got 25-cent
wheaties. Rebate. Ooh.

579
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:48,591
I'm gonna raise you VanCamp's
pork and beans...

580
00:47:48,626 --> 00:47:50,558
and ovaltine.

581
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:54,096
Well, I'm gonna see your
25-cent wheaties rebate...

582
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:57,999
and raise you two tender vittles
dollar offs, okay?

583
00:47:58,035 --> 00:47:59,900
That's it for me.
I'll fold.

584
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:02,105
Jack, why are you dealing me
this garbage? I'm out.

585
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:05,109
This is so much more fun
than bridge, Jack.

586
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,077
Thanks so much for thinking
of it. Girls, girls.

587
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:10,614
Come on. Are you gonna play
cards or flap your gums?

588
00:48:10,813 --> 00:48:13,416
Flap my gums!
It's gettin' ugly in here.

589
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:15,117
Hey. Come on.
All right. All right.

590
00:48:15,418 --> 00:48:20,623
I will see you your tender vittles,
and I'll raise you a 50-cent yoplait...

591
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:25,129
and a two-dollar rebate
on a Domino's pizza...

592
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,633
and a two-for-one
sun pure frozen entree.

593
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:30,634
How about that?
Uh-oh. Ooh.

594
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,603
This is serious poker.

595
00:48:33,637 --> 00:48:36,641
Any of you ever tried those
sun pure frozen entrees?

596
00:48:36,675 --> 00:48:38,742
Ugh. My dog wouldn't eat 'em.

597
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:41,544
I love them.
I do.

598
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:49,654
I'm calling you with a 25-cent
new and improved ban roll-on...

599
00:48:49,655 --> 00:48:54,659
and two 50-cent triple-ply
hefty bag offers.

600
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,164
- What d'you got?
- She's bluffing.

601
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:02,166
Are these any good?

602
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:05,369
Uh, well...

603
00:49:07,672 --> 00:49:11,877
You got two pair.
You got plenty.

604
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:16,147
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, mom!

605
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:21,151
Caroline.
Oh, hi. Pizza, huh?

606
00:49:21,187 --> 00:49:24,190
Oh, don't get up! Don't get up.
Geez. That late already?

607
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:26,056
We're just finishing.

608
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:28,194
Don't be silly.
Don't get up. Well, pizza.

609
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:33,198
I got a ton of work to do.
I'll go upstairs.

610
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:35,202
Listen, uh, we better go here.
Come on.

611
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:37,202
- 7:30?
- 7:30!

612
00:49:37,504 --> 00:49:40,706
We'll play tomorrow.
Am I right?

613
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:44,675
Family starving? Take some
pizza home with you.

614
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:48,214
No. No, I don't need it.
Joan, don't forget your coupons.

615
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,718
Excuse me.
Joan, come on.

616
00:49:58,726 --> 00:50:00,928
I think I'm in trouble.

617
00:50:04,232 --> 00:50:06,699
Room service, madam.

618
00:50:06,734 --> 00:50:10,237
Oh, thanks, but, uh, Ron gave
me this tuna presentation to do,

619
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:12,205
and I'm really way behind.

620
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,208
Well, you gotta eat something, honey.
If I wanted something to eat,

621
00:50:16,244 --> 00:50:19,246
I would have come down and had something
to eat with you and your girlfriends.

622
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:22,250
Oh. All right.

623
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,717
Let's get into it.

624
00:50:24,752 --> 00:50:26,719
Get into what, Jack?
Get into this.

625
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:30,758
The house is a mess, Jack. The kids
are a mess, Jack. You're a mess, Jack.

626
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,312
Did I leave anything else out?
Wanna talk about the beard?

627
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:37,365
All right. The beard's in its
transitional stage right now.

628
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,267
When it comes in,
it's gonna look great.

629
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:43,271
It's gonna look like that movie star,
uh, what's his name?

630
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,273
Orson Welles?

631
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:47,777
No. I'm...

632
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:51,780
Oh! Orson Welles.

633
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:54,282
Oh, I get it.
Fat jokes, right?

634
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:56,285
That's real funny. Yeah, I've
put on a couple of pounds.

635
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,251
So what? Come on.
What else do you have?

636
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:01,289
You wanna talk about this shirt
for a second, Jack? All right.

637
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,792
You've been wearing this shirt for about
two weeks now. It could walk by itself.

638
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,760
Why don't you retire that thing to
the dry cleaning hall of fame, huh?

639
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:12,401
It's a comfortable shirt! Jack, take a look
at yourself. You've thrown in the towel.

640
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,268
My brain is like oatmeal.

641
00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:18,557
I yelled at Kenny today for
coloring outside the lines!

642
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:21,811
Megan and I are starting to
watch the same TV shows,

643
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,813
and I'm liking them.

644
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,779
I'm losin' it.

645
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:29,318
Honey, I know what you're talking about.
I've been there myself, all right?

646
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:32,822
If you were so unhappy why didn't you
say something? Because I wasn't unhappy!

647
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:35,525
Maybe I was a little confused.
Maybe I was a little frustrated.

648
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,326
But I knew what I was doing
was important,

649
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,295
because it means something
to raise decent human beings.

650
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,832
What saw me through was pride.
I had pride in this house, in my kids...

651
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,334
and in being Mrs. Jack Butler!

652
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,802
Where are you going?

653
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:52,641
I'm going downstairs and sleep on the
fat couch, if I can get through the door.

654
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:57,849
Well, take pride in some
of that fat, porky!

655
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,353
Yes?

656
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,856
Victor, it's Nikki.

657
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:09,224
Yes, hello, Nikki.

658
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,863
Honey, are you okay?

659
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:15,366
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

660
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,874
Hello.

661
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,376
Joan. Hi. How are you?

662
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,380
No, forget it. Come on.
That was days ago.

663
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:32,383
No. No, it was very
insensitive of us.

664
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:35,887
Caroline had every right
to be angry.

665
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:40,391
We're not talking...
or doin' anything else.

666
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,894
I'll be right there.

667
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:00,913
I came as fast as i could.

668
00:53:01,113 --> 00:53:02,413
You sure did.

669
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:07,419
You look great, Jack.

670
00:53:11,424 --> 00:53:13,927
I do?
Mm-hmm.

671
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:23,936
What do you think of this shirt?

672
00:53:25,438 --> 00:53:27,441
Let me tell you about flannel.

673
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:31,445
It gets me hot.

674
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,704
Joan, do I look fat or, uh,

675
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:44,923
overweight at all to you?

676
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:48,962
I like a man with a little meat
on his bones.

677
00:53:51,466 --> 00:53:53,468
That's two.

678
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:59,473
Okay, how about the beard?
I mean, uh, Caroline hates the beard.

679
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:01,976
I know.

680
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,682
Oh, my God.

681
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:14,488
Jack!

682
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:18,793
Jack?

683
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:25,000
How could you?

684
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,203
And Joan? Why, Joan,
you're supposed to be my friend.

685
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:33,507
He's too much man to be
left alone, Caroline.

686
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:35,009
Really.

687
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:39,014
Honey! Please!
Come on.

688
00:54:39,516 --> 00:54:41,518
It's just a... one kiss!

689
00:54:41,552 --> 00:54:43,018
I'll bet.

690
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,022
Honey, what about the kids?
The kids are just outside.

691
00:54:46,522 --> 00:54:50,025
I've thought of the kids.
The kids won't hear a thing.

692
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:53,994
Shoot me! Shoot me!

693
00:54:54,029 --> 00:54:57,533
You're right. God knows
I'm guilty. I deserve it.

694
00:54:57,534 --> 00:55:01,538
Tell me something, Jack.
What did it, huh? The boredom?

695
00:55:01,738 --> 00:55:06,542
The repetition? The days,
one flowing into the next?

696
00:55:06,543 --> 00:55:11,548
The loneliness? Well, I did it, Jack.
I did it for eight years.

697
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:15,051
Don't you think I know?
Say good-bye, darling.

698
00:55:24,562 --> 00:55:28,065
What?
Aw, shit!

699
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:36,573
I loved this shirt!

700
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:47,084
God.

701
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:06,605
Couldn't hold on, could ya, Jack?

702
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:13,010
I was comin' by to call you back.

703
00:56:19,116 --> 00:56:21,120
Holy cow.

704
00:56:23,521 --> 00:56:25,588
What'd you use, a. 38?

705
00:56:25,624 --> 00:56:30,028
Uh,.38,.39, whatever it took.

706
00:56:31,129 --> 00:56:33,232
Bye, darling.

707
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:37,236
- Tough luck, Jeff.
- Jack!

708
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,137
You bet.

709
00:56:39,138 --> 00:56:42,642
Jack, Jack.
My name's Jack.

710
00:56:42,643 --> 00:56:45,645
Jack. Jack.

711
00:57:18,077 --> 00:57:21,145
I can't, Joan. I can't.
You can't do this to me.

712
00:57:21,182 --> 00:57:25,586
Do what? It's time for our poker game.
The girls will be late.

713
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:29,188
Uh, there's no game today.
The game's called off.

714
00:57:29,189 --> 00:57:31,191
Why?
'Cause there's a death in the family.

715
00:57:31,227 --> 00:57:34,195
I'll explain it to you later.

716
00:58:08,849 --> 00:58:11,351
Stay!

717
00:58:12,854 --> 00:58:16,356
Get in there and clean
the kids' room.

718
00:58:17,858 --> 00:58:21,861
Three, four. Yeah!

719
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:34,375
Let me take a break!
Two! Three! Four!

720
00:58:34,776 --> 00:58:38,378
Hey!

721
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:41,348
Come on, pal.
Hey, south is drop off, north is pick up.

722
00:58:41,382 --> 00:58:45,387
Let's get it straight next time, all right?
Come on, move it. Move it.

723
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:49,356
Let's go!

724
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:51,858
Let's go, monkeys!
I want all of you up! Let's go!

725
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:55,897
I want this area policed. I want the animals
fed. I want you to report for chow, 0700.

726
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,899
Move it, monkeys!
Move it! Let's go!

727
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:01,402
Dad?

728
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:03,905
# Gonna fly now #

729
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:06,908
Where's my baby?
Come on.

730
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:10,412
Today show.
Gene Shalit.

731
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,880
# Gonna fly now #

732
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:14,881
Let's go. We're running late.
Oh! Yeah, okay.

733
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:18,421
Thanks, honey. I'm moving now.
I'll be there in a minute.

734
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,434
Good luck.

735
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:39,941
# Gonna fly now #

736
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:44,947
# Flying high now #

737
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:50,453
# Gonna fly #

738
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:53,556
# Fly so high #

739
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,939
Listen, ace.

740
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:12,476
You and I have to have
a man-to-man talk here...

741
01:00:12,477 --> 01:00:15,445
about your woobie.

742
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,483
Your woobie's looking bad, bud.
No.

743
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:20,484
Now, wait a minute.

744
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,486
Now, listen to me.
I understand...

745
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:25,954
that you little guys start
out with your woobies...

746
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,995
and you think they're great,
and they are... they are terrific.

747
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:33,964
But pretty soon,
a woobie isn't enough.

748
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:36,501
You're out on the street trying
to score an electric blanket...

749
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,968
or maybe a quilt,

750
01:00:39,004 --> 01:00:43,407
and the next thing you know,
you're strung out on bedspreads, Ken.

751
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,514
That's serious.

752
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:52,819
Now, give me the woobie.

753
01:00:52,854 --> 01:00:55,621
No.

754
01:00:57,524 --> 01:01:00,425
Kenny, come on, man.

755
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:05,029
- No.
- Okay.

756
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:07,532
Give it to me for a couple of days.

757
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:10,436
If it doesn't work,
you got the woobie back.

758
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:15,142
Please?

759
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,557
You got a lot of guts.

760
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:35,561
Can I have...

761
01:01:35,562 --> 01:01:39,066
a moment to myself, please?

762
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:43,070
Absolutely.
You got it.

763
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:08,595
You had to do it.

764
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:18,607
Okay.

765
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:29,707
Ohh.

766
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:31,994
Tired, huh?

767
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:34,211
Oh. Yeah.

768
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:37,213
A little.
Excuse me.

769
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:39,752
Hmm?
How about this food?

770
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:43,255
Mmm.
Very good.

771
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:46,760
Mm-hmm. You sent out
for chinese food, huh?

772
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:49,762
No! Kenny made this.

773
01:04:52,766 --> 01:04:57,269
Uh-uh. Listen, you're doing a really
great job with the kids, honey.

774
01:04:57,304 --> 01:04:59,772
I appreciate it. And with everything.
You really are.

775
01:04:59,773 --> 01:05:02,741
Yhanks. I'd love
to take this time...

776
01:05:02,776 --> 01:05:06,780
to carry you upstairs,
and let you tell me all about it,

777
01:05:06,814 --> 01:05:08,783
but I think that might
take too long.

778
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:11,285
Mmm.

779
01:05:14,788 --> 01:05:17,290
Mmm.

780
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:42,066
How's it going in there, huh?

781
01:05:42,102 --> 01:05:45,320
Like having your gums scraped.

782
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:49,823
You're on.
So soon?

783
01:05:49,824 --> 01:05:53,327
It didn't take Humphries very long
to shoot down every idea we had.

784
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:56,831
Looks like you're the
ace in the hole, kid.

785
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,834
Well, I'm ready.

786
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:04,604
Okay, you've got
my attention. Shoot.

787
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:08,342
Well, these are the last two
campaigns for schooner tuna.

788
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:10,845
First you gave away four glasses
with every can of tuna.

789
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:14,349
Now, as I recall, you were stuck
with 60,000 of these, right?

790
01:06:14,384 --> 01:06:18,153
What is this,
this is your life?

791
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,854
Now, bear with me.

792
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:22,825
Next came 100 free trips to Hawaii.

793
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:24,861
Now, who knew there was going
to be a hurricane that month?

794
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:28,164
You're stuck with 100,000
of these flower leis.

795
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:32,067
I hope to hell you're making a point.

796
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:34,335
Well, I am making a point,
Mr. Humphries. the point is,

797
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:37,337
schooner tuna is one of the three
most expensive tunas on the market.

798
01:06:37,373 --> 01:06:41,377
Now, if we want to beat our competitors,
the time for these gimmicks is over with.

799
01:06:41,677 --> 01:06:43,880
Now, I don't mean to be
disrespectful, Mr. Humphries,

800
01:06:43,881 --> 01:06:46,884
but housewives need your help,
not your gimmicks.

801
01:06:47,184 --> 01:06:51,388
show them that you really care about their
problems, and you'll win their loyalty.

802
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:53,890
Now, this is what I propose.

803
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:57,643
"Schooner tuna sympathizes with those
hit so hard by this trying economy.

804
01:06:57,678 --> 01:07:01,289
"To help you, we are reducing the
price of our tuna by 50 cents a can.

805
01:07:01,324 --> 01:07:04,902
"When this crisis is over,
we'll go back to our regular prices.

806
01:07:04,903 --> 01:07:07,370
"Until then, remember,
we're all in this together.

807
01:07:07,404 --> 01:07:12,410
Signed, Howard Humphries, president,
schooner tuna. The tuna with a heart. "

808
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:21,919
Well, you've got a plane to catch.

809
01:07:22,419 --> 01:07:25,922
- I'm really sorry, Howard...
- Damn well right, you're sorry.

810
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:31,428
- Yes, I am. - Where in the hell have
you been hiding this little girl?

811
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:35,632
She's not just selling tuna,
son, she's selling America!

812
01:07:35,633 --> 01:07:38,435
- Right! - The tuna with a heart!
I love this bleeding heart shit.

813
01:07:38,436 --> 01:07:41,939
- That's... that's American,
that's what that is. - That's what I think!

814
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,442
- Well, there's more.
- More?

815
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:47,646
- There is?
- Yes.

816
01:07:54,954 --> 01:07:58,957
Caroline, congratulations!

817
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:01,660
Thanks.
I am so impressed with you.

818
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:12,471
Hi. I'm here for Mrs. Butler.
8:00 flight.

819
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,975
Right. She'll be right out.
Okay.

820
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,982
Why do you have to
go to California?

821
01:08:23,382 --> 01:08:25,984
'Cause that's where we're gonna
make the tuna commercial, honey.

822
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,488
Can't you go tomorrow, mommy?

823
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:32,491
No, I can't, because everyone else
is going tonight, and I have to go.

824
01:08:32,492 --> 01:08:34,458
But you know what?
I'm gonna be back before you go...

825
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:38,798
to your first meeting of the knights
of the round table, I promise.

826
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:42,501
Bye, honey.

827
01:08:42,502 --> 01:08:45,104
Bye, sweetie.
Aww.

828
01:08:48,509 --> 01:08:52,012
Wait. guys, stay right here.
Alex, Kenny, watch her for a minute, okay?

829
01:08:52,013 --> 01:08:54,514
Let me talk to you.

830
01:08:55,015 --> 01:08:59,019
Two hours notice, and you're
off to Los Angeles like that.

831
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,522
Jack, there is nothing
I could do about it.

832
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:05,525
I convinced a man today to spend
$11 million on one of my ideas.

833
01:09:06,027 --> 01:09:09,030
I gotta go! Besides, honey, there's
gonna be other halloweens, you know.

834
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:13,033
I know there'll be other halloweens,
but I'm thinking about this halloween.

835
01:09:13,034 --> 01:09:15,536
Caroline, these kids, in a couple of years,
they're gonna outgrow this thing.

836
01:09:15,571 --> 01:09:19,439
Oh, really? You don't seem
to have outgrown it, Jack.

837
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:23,043
All right, I admit it.
I like halloween.

838
01:09:23,544 --> 01:09:27,347
Yeah, well, so do I, honey. Remember, I was
gonna dress up as a prison matron tonight?

839
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:34,255
The point is, Megan just cut two new teeth.
I'll bet you didn't know that.

840
01:09:34,256 --> 01:09:37,308
Alex is playing football.
Remember Kenny's security blanket?

841
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:40,360
He doesn't have it anymore.
He doesn't use it. It's gone.

842
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:42,563
You know, if you were here,
I was gonna suggest you go as a ghost,

843
01:09:42,598 --> 01:09:44,566
'cause even when you're here,
you're not here!

844
01:09:47,068 --> 01:09:50,573
- We really have to get going.
- Hey, 'Madison Avenue', lighten up.

845
01:09:52,075 --> 01:09:54,077
All right, Jack. What do you
want me to do? Not go?

846
01:09:54,576 --> 01:09:56,478
Not try?
Not succeed?

847
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:59,080
Of course not!
I want you to succeed.

848
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:02,049
Hon...

849
01:10:02,085 --> 01:10:05,338
you gave me some real
good advice once.

850
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:08,555
So now let me give you
some of mine.

851
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:13,496
It's real easy to forget
what's important. So don't.

852
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,605
Jack, I'm gonna be back in less than a week.
Can't we talk about this then?

853
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:25,106
Come on, everything's
gonna be all right.

854
01:10:52,137 --> 01:10:56,140
Little woman's off again, huh?
Shut up, Annette.

855
01:11:00,144 --> 01:11:03,113
Please, Megan. Please.
Daddy will buy you a T-bird.

856
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:06,151
Okay? You want a T-bird? please.
Put your bum down there, honey, okay?

857
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:08,617
I know, but j...

858
01:11:08,653 --> 01:11:12,622
Ken, she here?
I think she's here now, dad.

859
01:11:12,657 --> 01:11:16,160
Okay. Honey, please.
For daddy. Meg, please, okay?

860
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,066
Hi.

861
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:25,670
- Who are you?
- What?

862
01:11:26,271 --> 01:11:28,238
Who are you?

863
01:11:28,274 --> 01:11:30,975
I'm your baby-sitter.

864
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:33,679
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

865
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:47,658
Oh, Jack.
Hi.

866
01:11:47,693 --> 01:11:49,659
How are you?
Hi, kids. Okay.

867
01:11:49,695 --> 01:11:53,198
Huh? You remember uncle Jinx?
They're big now, huh?

868
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,667
Yeah. Listen.
What this is about, it's a...

869
01:11:56,703 --> 01:11:59,705
it's a review board.
Now, it's just a formality. Oh.

870
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:02,208
They're gonna ask you
a couple of questions...

871
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,176
Jack, if you could back me up,

872
01:12:05,211 --> 01:12:08,180
I think I can get you back on
at half salary.

873
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:10,817
What are you talking about? You didn't
say anything about half salary on the phone.

874
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:12,718
Yeah.

875
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,222
Mr. Latham, Mr. Butler,
you can go in now.

876
01:12:15,223 --> 01:12:18,725
According to our records,
since you and your associates left,

877
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,228
production in your division
is off by 23 percent...

878
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:24,731
and costs are up 19 percent.

879
01:12:25,232 --> 01:12:28,199
Do you have any explanation for that?

880
01:12:28,235 --> 01:12:32,239
I'm a little confused here.
I'm no longer with the company.

881
01:12:32,275 --> 01:12:34,741
I don't know.
You might ask Mr. Latham.

882
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:36,944
We have.

883
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:40,213
And?
I'm sorry, Jack.

884
01:12:40,248 --> 01:12:42,749
I covered for you guys
as long as I could.

885
01:12:46,253 --> 01:12:48,755
You covered for us?

886
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:51,725
Yeah.

887
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:57,232
That's a lie.
That's not true.

888
01:12:57,532 --> 01:12:59,734
Come on, Jack.

889
01:12:59,735 --> 01:13:03,238
Larry and Stan were in here. They already
admitted that I covered for them.

890
01:13:03,273 --> 01:13:07,241
Now, come on! It's time for
you to be a stand-up guy.

891
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:13,748
Larry and Stan would say anything
you wanted them to say.

892
01:13:13,783 --> 01:13:16,716
They need their jobs.

893
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:20,757
You want me to be a stand-up guy?
Okay, I'll be a stand-up guy.

894
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:25,561
I need my job too, but what's
going on here is wrong.

895
01:13:27,062 --> 01:13:29,229
If I did such a bad job,

896
01:13:29,264 --> 01:13:34,768
why did production go down and
costs go up after you fired me, huh?

897
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,522
Look, I don't know what
this guy told you.

898
01:13:37,556 --> 01:13:40,241
I don't know what he does
with his books.

899
01:13:40,275 --> 01:13:44,780
I'm a car maker. I make cars.
I'm not an accountant.

900
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:47,283
But i'll tell you something...
I take a lot of pride in my work.

901
01:13:48,785 --> 01:13:50,752
Dad?

902
01:13:50,787 --> 01:13:54,791
Uh, son, son... you're gonna have to
get out of here now. This is a meeting.

903
01:13:54,825 --> 01:13:56,757
Just a minute, Alex.
Daddy's talking.

904
01:13:56,792 --> 01:13:59,796
I know it's not real popular
right now, you know,

905
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:01,798
taking pride in your work, but I did.

906
01:14:02,298 --> 01:14:04,301
I cared.
You fired me for it.

907
01:14:04,802 --> 01:14:07,805
If you ever talk to my kid again like that,
I'm knocking you out.

908
01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:20,282
Yea! Forget the paper.

909
01:14:20,318 --> 01:14:24,321
Yip, yip, hooray! There we go.
There we go. That's it.

910
01:14:26,423 --> 01:14:28,324
Would you forget the pa...

911
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,843
Schooner tuna
commercial, take 24.

912
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:49,812
And action.

913
01:14:49,847 --> 01:14:53,351
I'm Howard Humphries,
president of schooner tuna.

914
01:14:53,852 --> 01:14:56,354
All of us here, uh...

915
01:14:56,389 --> 01:14:58,822
Cut, cut.
Cut it.

916
01:14:58,857 --> 01:15:00,824
Caroline? Caroline?
Telephone, Bill.

917
01:15:00,858 --> 01:15:03,361
There's an emotional
element missing. I...

918
01:15:03,863 --> 01:15:05,865
Oh, for God's sake, what does
he want now, Caroline?

919
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:08,867
Wait a second.
I'll take care of this.

920
01:15:08,903 --> 01:15:11,469
What is it?

921
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,873
Can't you control him?

922
01:15:14,874 --> 01:15:16,876
I want to say... I want to say,
"My fellow Americans. "

923
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:20,845
Gaffer tape, please?
Okay. Fine, fine.

924
01:15:20,879 --> 01:15:22,882
Okay, folks. One more time.
Quiet, please!

925
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:24,883
Clear it.

926
01:15:25,384 --> 01:15:26,351
Caroline?
Mm-hmm.

927
01:15:26,385 --> 01:15:29,388
How about a little dinner
after all this is over?

928
01:15:29,423 --> 01:15:32,356
No, I don't think so.
I'm too tired. Just...

929
01:15:32,391 --> 01:15:35,394
as soon as this is over, I want to go back
to the hotel and soak in a hot tub.

930
01:15:35,428 --> 01:15:37,396
That's all I want to do.
That... yeah.

931
01:15:37,431 --> 01:15:40,899
That sounds like a great idea.

932
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:45,405
- Quiet! - Schooner tuna
commercial, take 25.

933
01:15:46,406 --> 01:15:48,408
My fellow Americans...

934
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:51,911
I actually thought I had a job there
for about 30 seconds today.

935
01:15:51,912 --> 01:15:53,914
Hey, Jack, forget about it.

936
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:57,417
The most important thing is that
you didn't get fired.

937
01:15:57,451 --> 01:16:00,384
That's right. That's a good
way to look at it, I guess.

938
01:16:00,419 --> 01:16:04,925
Listen, you guys get in now and go,
and I'm gonna get a cab.

939
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:08,428
We sprang for dinner!
You can't walk out on us now!

940
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,930
Get in. 'Cause I don't...
Where are you taking me?

941
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:13,935
Come on.
Get in the car.

942
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:15,937
Got him!

943
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:52,439
Oh, my God!

944
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:56,478
These aren't the same guys from
the space shuttle, are they?

945
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,995
Hey, Flash!

946
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,464
Wow!

947
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:19,502
Don't look now, but I think
he's looking at you. No, he's...

948
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:24,005
Okay. Okay.

949
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,977
Remember, you don't know
where this has been.

950
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:34,016
Where's he putting it? No, don't tell me,
don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.

951
01:17:34,052 --> 01:17:36,484
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

952
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,022
Hey, wait, Flash!
Wait for me! Hey, Joan!

953
01:17:39,023 --> 01:17:42,925
Hey, seriously, this...
Ohh.

954
01:17:42,926 --> 01:17:45,028
We're going to jail.

955
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:47,029
Who cares?

956
01:17:55,539 --> 01:18:00,043
All right, girls.
Next time I'll call you, all right?

957
01:18:00,044 --> 01:18:03,047
Don't bother calling me.
Seriously, it was fun.

958
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:05,514
I'll see you.
Here, take this.

959
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:07,551
I don't think I'm gonna need it.
What is it?

960
01:18:07,585 --> 01:18:10,053
It's that dancer's telephone number.

961
01:18:10,054 --> 01:18:12,721
Good-bye!

962
01:18:12,757 --> 01:18:14,557
Will all the passengers be sure...

963
01:18:14,558 --> 01:18:17,561
to have their baggage checked
before boarding the buses.

964
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:20,363
Will Mrs. Turner...
Annette?

965
01:18:20,364 --> 01:18:22,717
Mrs. Turner, please
come to the desk.

966
01:18:22,751 --> 01:18:25,069
Will Mrs. Turner please
come to the desk.

967
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:27,072
So, that's why you offered
to sit with the kids.

968
01:18:27,471 --> 01:18:31,776
You knew where they were
taking me, didn't you?

969
01:18:31,811 --> 01:18:33,743
Daddy?

970
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:36,079
Hi. Come on, I'm taking
you guys to bed.

971
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:39,583
- Can we call mommy?
- No, we can't. She's in California.

972
01:18:40,185 --> 01:18:42,552
I want to talk to mommy too.

973
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:45,089
Come on, guys. Go to bed.
We'll call her in the morning.

974
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:48,593
Well, it's only 8:30 in California.

975
01:18:50,596 --> 01:18:53,398
Good point, Annette.
All right.

976
01:19:08,114 --> 01:19:11,118
Okay, be very, very quiet.

977
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:15,121
Okay. Okay. Okay.

978
01:19:16,622 --> 01:19:20,125
Right... right... right around
here would be fine.

979
01:19:20,126 --> 01:19:24,130
Incidentally, I really appreciate
this very, very much.

980
01:19:24,165 --> 01:19:26,632
Oh, I'm quite sure you do.

981
01:19:39,147 --> 01:19:42,148
# Strangers in the night #

982
01:19:42,183 --> 01:19:45,151
# Exchanging glances #

983
01:19:45,152 --> 01:19:47,954
# Wandering in the night #

984
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:50,722
# What were the chances #

985
01:19:50,756 --> 01:19:54,662
# We'd be sharing love #
Hello? Alex who?

986
01:19:54,663 --> 01:19:58,165
I don't know.
Some guy.

987
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:01,268
Let me see.
Is Caroline Butler there?

988
01:20:01,305 --> 01:20:04,171
She's in the tub.
Who is this?

989
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:06,674
This is her husband.
Who the hell is this?

990
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:25,193
- Who was that on my phone?
- Uh, wrong number.

991
01:20:25,393 --> 01:20:28,461
Ron, what are you doing?

992
01:20:28,497 --> 01:20:31,198
Well, somebody has got to
pour the champagne.

993
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,702
You've been drinking a lot,
haven't you, Ron?

994
01:20:33,737 --> 01:20:36,705
Moi?
Yep. A lot.

995
01:20:37,206 --> 01:20:39,208
I think i'm gonna have to
ask you to leave now, okay?

996
01:20:39,707 --> 01:20:42,210
Why? There are no kids
to go home to tonight.

997
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:46,680
Ron, get out. We could make
a great team, Caroline.

998
01:20:46,715 --> 01:20:49,217
Really? what the hell's that supposed
to mean? Well, basically,

999
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,185
you dump Jack, you marry me,

1000
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:54,689
and it's Richardson,
Frankel and Richardson.

1001
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:57,225
Come on. What are you trying to tell me,
that you're in love with me?

1002
01:20:57,226 --> 01:21:00,195
Hell, no. But the client is.

1003
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,732
All right, Ron. This is my official
warning to you. Get out!

1004
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:05,736
You are so adorable
when you're angry.

1005
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:09,239
Ron, get out. Ron! I'm not kidding.
Oh, don't be coy with...

1006
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,246
Oh, trying to play hard to get, huh?

1007
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:22,752
Aren't you gonna answer that? That's
the fourth time it's rung in the last hour.

1008
01:21:22,788 --> 01:21:24,754
- Oh, do you want me
to answer it? - Yeah!

1009
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:27,757
Oh, okay. Here we go. Hello?

1010
01:21:28,058 --> 01:21:30,260
Okay?
Nobody there, I guess.

1011
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:40,270
Oh. Well, you probably
want to be alone, huh?

1012
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:42,773
Okay, good.
All righty.

1013
01:21:43,073 --> 01:21:45,775
Well, you try to get some sleep
now, okay? And don't worry.

1014
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:49,779
My lips are sealed.
Bye.

1015
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:55,286
Won't be so bad when I
get your bangs rolled.

1016
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:59,055
Horrible.

1017
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:02,293
I don't think I'll be called upon
to defend my honor. I doubt it.

1018
01:22:06,398 --> 01:22:09,299
I promised Jack I wouldn't
say anything.

1019
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,803
Now, remember, this is
in strictest confidence.

1020
01:22:13,204 --> 01:22:15,307
Of course!

1021
01:22:51,344 --> 01:22:53,846
Oh, good.
Another grown-up.

1022
01:22:57,349 --> 01:23:00,820
What happened?

1023
01:23:00,854 --> 01:23:03,356
Dad's making some minor changes.

1024
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:08,862
Hi, Joan.

1025
01:23:09,362 --> 01:23:10,864
Just doing a little work
around the house. Kenny!

1026
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:13,665
Don't paint your sister!

1027
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,634
Hey, Butler!
Guess what?

1028
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:18,872
You had quite a burst of
nervous energy last night.

1029
01:23:18,906 --> 01:23:20,874
Yeah.
You should have called me.

1030
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:23,141
Hey, Butler! Yeah?

1031
01:23:23,176 --> 01:23:25,879
I think i found your problem.
What is it?

1032
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,382
This shoe.
Oh.

1033
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:30,350
Kids.
Huh.

1034
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:32,887
Doris, this is a friend
of mine, Joan. TV.

1035
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:35,389
Hi.
Kitchen's clean.

1036
01:23:35,589 --> 01:23:39,392
Hi, Joan. I'm gonna check
your basement for bugs.

1037
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:42,362
I sure hope I don't find any.

1038
01:23:42,397 --> 01:23:45,365
Eww, i'm all grimy
and sweaty here.

1039
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:47,868
Joan, I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower.

1040
01:23:47,902 --> 01:23:49,904
You can get a drink. You know
where we keep everything.

1041
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:52,406
Or watch television,
whatever you want.

1042
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:04,920
Oh, wow!

1043
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:12,428
Ooh.

1044
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:19,934
Hey, Jack! I love what you
did to the bedroom!

1045
01:24:21,938 --> 01:24:24,440
Damn.

1046
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,942
Thanks. It's amazing what you
can do with a sears card.

1047
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:30,445
That's from their safari collection.

1048
01:24:34,951 --> 01:24:37,953
You got a problem.

1049
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:40,455
Okay.

1050
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:43,426
All right.

1051
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:48,465
A: She's an attractive woman.

1052
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,469
B: She wants you, Jack.

1053
01:24:52,969 --> 01:24:55,470
She wants you bad.

1054
01:24:55,471 --> 01:25:00,977
C: I don't even want
to think about "C. "

1055
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:04,481
D:

1056
01:25:04,482 --> 01:25:09,486
Kenny'd talk.
Alex... Alex would be okay.

1057
01:25:09,522 --> 01:25:12,289
Kenny'd talk.
He'd crack.

1058
01:25:26,405 --> 01:25:28,972
M: I'm a free agent.

1059
01:25:29,007 --> 01:25:31,974
N: I could be in the middle of it,

1060
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:33,976
I could have a heart attack, I could die.

1061
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:38,415
Caroline walks in, sees me there.
I die and get caught.

1062
01:25:39,517 --> 01:25:41,984
- Joan?
- Caroline!

1063
01:25:42,019 --> 01:25:45,523
- What are you doing
in my bedroom? - Huh?

1064
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:49,994
This is my bedroom, isn't it?

1065
01:25:50,028 --> 01:25:53,032
- Yeah.
- Well, what are you doing here?

1066
01:25:55,534 --> 01:25:57,535
Is it too early for a drink?

1067
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:02,005
All right.
Y:

1068
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:05,043
Why did I get rid of that woobie?

1069
01:26:06,545 --> 01:26:09,549
Z: you're not gonna do anything,

1070
01:26:11,551 --> 01:26:14,053
'cause you, my friend,
are in love with your wife.

1071
01:26:17,056 --> 01:26:19,058
Joan? Caroline?
Jack.

1072
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:21,559
Well, now that we have the names straight,
would you mind explaining to me...

1073
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,564
why I come all the way home to talk to you,
and I find another woman in our room?

1074
01:26:25,964 --> 01:26:28,567
Oh, look who's talking.
I called your hotel,

1075
01:26:28,568 --> 01:26:33,073
Richardson answers the phone, and I hear
champagne chilling in the background?

1076
01:26:33,108 --> 01:26:35,040
You heard that?
Aha!

1077
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:37,577
Now, I'd appreciate it if you just
don't talk to me right now,

1078
01:26:37,578 --> 01:26:40,080
because I'm doing my best
to calm down, all right?

1079
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:43,583
Excuse me.
I have a household to run.

1080
01:26:43,618 --> 01:26:46,385
Oh, Jack!

1081
01:26:48,589 --> 01:26:50,555
Hello.
Oh, Jack.

1082
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:53,093
I... I'm in a lot of trouble.
Look, I'm not talking to you.

1083
01:26:53,127 --> 01:26:55,060
No, no. Please.
Listen to me.

1084
01:26:55,096 --> 01:26:58,098
Uh, I cut the department to the bone,
and they caught me.

1085
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:01,300
I've gotta have you back.
I'll do anything.

1086
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:03,102
Dad, is mommy home?

1087
01:27:03,103 --> 01:27:06,106
Not now, kid!
I'm talking here!

1088
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:08,708
I warned you, Jinx.

1089
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:12,513
- Ohh!
- Gee, one punch!

1090
01:27:12,514 --> 01:27:14,580
You want a company car?

1091
01:27:14,615 --> 01:27:17,619
One punch! One punch! Caroline?
Oh, I've caught you at a bad time.

1092
01:27:18,119 --> 01:27:20,121
Hey, don't hit me, Jack. I like
what you've done with the place.

1093
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:22,623
Gotta get a new tube.
Ron!

1094
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,591
Caroline, I am begging you.

1095
01:27:24,626 --> 01:27:27,127
Humphries is gonna pull the whole
account unless you come back to work.

1096
01:27:27,163 --> 01:27:29,630
I told this guy last night
ten times that I quit.

1097
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:34,637
What'd he do, make a pass? I just got
a little out of hand, and she belted me.

1098
01:27:35,136 --> 01:27:37,103
You quit your job?
I didn't like that job.

1099
01:27:37,138 --> 01:27:40,642
I'm gonna get another job, a better one!
Anyway, I miss my family.

1100
01:27:40,643 --> 01:27:42,644
I thought you loved that job.
Thanks.

1101
01:27:43,145 --> 01:27:45,611
How about three days at the
office and two days at home?

1102
01:27:45,647 --> 01:27:49,150
There's no way I can do that.
I need... Jack, will you listen to me?

1103
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:52,654
- Management wants you back!
- Jack!

1104
01:27:52,655 --> 01:27:56,123
Thanks. Basement's clean.
Oh, thanks.

1105
01:27:56,158 --> 01:27:59,161
Look, he's offering me full salary and
a company car. What do you think?

1106
01:27:59,196 --> 01:28:01,128
Are you kidding?
Take it. Okay, look, Bert,

1107
01:28:01,162 --> 01:28:03,130
tell him I don't make a move
without Larry and Stan.

1108
01:28:03,164 --> 01:28:06,067
- He doesn't make a move without
Larry and Stan. - Oh, you got a deal.

1109
01:28:06,068 --> 01:28:07,669
Who are Larry and Stan?
Thanks.

1110
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:11,674
You're a working woman. Can't you
understand? I'll tell you something else.

1111
01:28:11,675 --> 01:28:14,176
You really hit him?

1112
01:28:14,678 --> 01:28:16,680
Don't you think I know how
to take care of myself?

1113
01:28:16,715 --> 01:28:18,647
Well...

1114
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:21,685
Hurt your hand?
No.

1115
01:28:24,186 --> 01:28:27,189
Missed you.

1116
01:28:27,691 --> 01:28:30,193
I missed you too.

1117
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:41,704
My fellow Americans, I am Howard Humphries,
president of schooner tuna.

1118
01:28:41,705 --> 01:28:44,172
All of us here at schooner
tuna sympathize...

1119
01:28:44,207 --> 01:28:47,710
with those of you hit so hard
by these trying economic times.

1120
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:52,717
In order to help you, we are reducing
the price of schooner tuna...

1121
01:28:52,753 --> 01:28:54,685
by 50 cents a can.

1122
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,222
When this crisis is over,
we will go back to our regular prices.

1123
01:28:58,258 --> 01:29:02,226
Until then, remember,
we're all in this together.

1124
01:29:02,261 --> 01:29:07,231
Schooner tuna.
The tuna with a heart.
