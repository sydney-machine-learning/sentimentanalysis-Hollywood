1
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
- You didn't say there'd be such security.
- They moved the flight forward.

2
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll have to go ahead
as planned anyway.

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,100
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

4
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,500
James.

5
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,000
Be careful.

6
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,900
Well, small world. You're a Toro, too.

7
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,600
l'll see you in Miami.

8
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,200
Fill her up.

9
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,500
EAST BERLlN

10
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,100
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

11
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,400
We should go, my dear.

12
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,300
Well...

13
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,300
You become more beautiful every day.

14
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,300
- l'm over here.
- Of course you are.

15
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,800
This is Miss Penelope Smallbone,
my new assistant.

16
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,800
Miss Smallbone.

17
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,300
What can l say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...

18
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,000
- As l used to be?
- l didn't say that.

19
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,400
You're such a flatterer, James.

20
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,100
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.

21
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,100
So you've told me.

22
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,000
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.

23
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,900
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.

24
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,900
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.

25
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,800
ln nauseating detail.

26
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,900
Really?

27
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,500
l can see you're going
to fit in here very nicely.

28
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,400
- Good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.

29
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,400
- Minister.
- Commander.

30
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,400
l think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.

31
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.

32
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,400
- Do you know what this is?
- lt looks like a Fabergé egg, sir.

33
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Fabergé
as a gift for the Russian royal family.

34
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,000
They're priceless and very rare.

35
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,600
This one contains a model
of the imperial state coach.

36
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
- Top marks, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

37
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,900
Except it's a fake.

38
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,000
There's the real thing. lt's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

39
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,100
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.

40
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,000
lt's from none of the usual sources.
Anonymous seller, Swiss bank account.

41
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,800
l'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

42
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,600
And now this turns up.
A near-perfect forgery.

43
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,800
l think Commander Bond
should accompany you to the sale.

44
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,200
Splendid. l could use
an extra pair of eyes.

45
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
We could try and spot the seller.

46
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,000
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.

47
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,400
Thank you, Fanning.

48
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,600
Not at all.

49
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,200
lf it is the Russians,
it may be an effort to raise currency

50
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,200
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs.

51
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,000
Either way,
we'd better find out what they're up to.

52
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,000
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.

53
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Operation Trove.

54
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,800
You'll be replacing 009.

55
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,600
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.

56
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There's not much to go on.

57
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,500
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

58
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,200
''Property of a Lady.''

59
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Next on the agenda is the continuing
mutual disarmament talks with NATO.

60
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,700
l assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.

61
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,800
lt seems very thorough.

62
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

63
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,300
l believe l express the opinion
of everyone present

64
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,800
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.

65
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,400
- Comrade Chairman.
- General Orlov.

66
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,600
General Gogol is presumptuous.

67
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,600
He speaks for himself and others

68
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,500
who cling to timid, outdated
and unrealistic policies.

69
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,100
Must l remind you, the committee,

70
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,200
of our overwhelming superiority
over NATO forces

71
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,200
before we give it away?

72
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,300
ln East Germany
under my direct command,

73
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,100
l have 31 divisions,
including 1 1 tank divisions

74
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,100
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

75
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,100
ln support, on the Russian western
border are 60 divisions,

76
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,900
including 22 tank divisions.

77
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,700
ln all, a 10-1 advantage.

78
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,700
American and West German forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions.

79
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,500
The British maintain only a token force.

80
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,300
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

81
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,800
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north,

82
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,300
and by five more through Czechoslovakia,
lead to total victory in five days

83
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,700
against any possible defence scenario.

84
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,000
This is absolute madness.

85
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
We know where it will end.

86
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,900
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.

87
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,500
Never.

88
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,100
The West is decadent and divided.

89
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,900
lt has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals.

90
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,100
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

91
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,800
l see no reason to risk war

92
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,700
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.

93
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems.

94
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,200
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down.

95
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,400
- l wish to tell you...
- Both of you.

96
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,400
World socialism
will be achieved peaceably.

97
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Our military role is strictly defensive.

98
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,700
ls that understood, General Orlov?

99
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,600
General Gogol, would you continue?

100
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,900
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. l will
now turn to the specifics of my report...

101
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,900
Tell him l will be there
as quickly as possible.

102
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,300
Please. Please.

103
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,900
- l am trying to concentrate.
- Lenkin.

104
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,900
- What is it?
- lt's terrible news, Comrade General.

105
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,400
The reproduction
has been stolen in transit.

106
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,300
The thief was dealt with,
but the egg was lost in the river.

107
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,200
Your incompetence will destroy us all.

108
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,900
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General.

109
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,000
l have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days.

110
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,100
Control yourself.

111
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,700
l'll tell our London people
we must have the genuine egg back.

112
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,400
l hope we can reach them in time.

113
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,800
Sold to Busoni.

114
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,300
The next lot is number 48.

115
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,300
A superb green-gold
lmperial Easter egg by Carl Fabergé.

116
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,800
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

117
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,100
Set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

118
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,800
- How much should it fetch?
- £250-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.

119
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,400
..used by Tsar Nicholas
in 1897 in Moscow.

120
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
Property of a Lady.

121
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

122
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,800
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.

123
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,600
l'll start it at £1 50,000.

124
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,100
1 50, 60.

125
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,000
170. 170.

126
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,200
180, 190.

127
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,000
200. Against you, madam.

128
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,800
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.

129
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
£220,000.

130
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,800
240.

131
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,500
James, stick to the business in hand.

132
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
£260,000.

133
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
280.

134
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,300
£300,000.

135
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
And 20?

136
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,100
Are you bidding, sir?

137
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,500
£320,000. New bidder.

138
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,400
- That's interesting.
- You know him?

139
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,700
Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.

140
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

141
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,900
£380,000.

142
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,700
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.

143
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,400
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.

144
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,200
400,000. Any more?

145
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,700
425. New bidder.

146
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,000
Thank you, sir.

147
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,500
- 425.
- Have you gone mad?

148
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,700
Let's see how badly he wants it.

149
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,100
450?

150
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,900
450. 475?

151
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,200
The bid is 450. 475?

152
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,800
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

153
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,300
- Jim?
- The bid is £450,000.

154
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
l have 475.

155
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,500
£500,000.

156
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,800
l have half a million pounds. All done?

157
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,500
Any more?

158
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,300
Yours, sir, for £500,000.

159
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,300
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.

160
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,900
- l doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?

161
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,800
That's what l intend to find out.

162
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,900
You had no business bidding for that egg.

163
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,400
What would you have done if you'd got it?

164
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,300
l would have claimed it was a fake, sir,
and not paid.

165
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,300
Not paid?

166
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,900
Here's the original. l switched it
with the fake during the auction.

167
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Good God.

168
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,700
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?

169
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,700
Well, he complains. lf he's legitimate.

170
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,300
- Well?
- l don't think he will complain.

171
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,200
According to Fanning,
this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.

172
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,900
l believe that the fake will smoke him out.

173
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,400
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he caught a plane to Delhi.

174
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,600
You must go there, too.

175
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,100
l'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station l,
to keep him under surveillance.

176
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,700
- Book yourself on the next flight out.
- Well, l've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

177
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,300
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?

178
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,400
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
lt's government property now.

179
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,800
Of course, sir.

180
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,000
Charming tune.
You do take English money?

181
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
Only gold sovereigns.

182
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,500
Please.

183
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,500
l'm Vijay.
Special expediter, Universal Exports.

184
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,400
- Welcome to lndia, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.

185
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,700
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Waiting in the taxi.

186
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,900
This was the wrong cover. l hate snakes.

187
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,700
Taxi. Please be comfortable.

188
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,700
- l am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?

189
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,900
- l booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?

190
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,100
Gone ahead.

191
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,900
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

192
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,000
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.

193
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,100
- l play a bit myself.
- Really?

194
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,600
As a matter of fact, l've got
a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

195
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,200
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.

196
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,300
Kamal lives there on the hill.

197
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,000
The Monsoon Palace.
lt's heavily guarded.

198
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,200
- How do l get to him?
- He plays backgammon at the hotel.

199
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,100
As a guest,
you're automatically a member.

200
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,000
- Let's meet there later.
- l'll change into something less casual.

201
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,500
Here, you may need this
to play with your asp.

202
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,100
Good morning. Name's Bond.
l believe you have a reservation.

203
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.

204
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
l hope you have a pleasant stay.

205
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,300
l'm sure l will.

206
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,200
Thank you.

207
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,200
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

208
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,300
- Oh, thank you.
- lf l can be of further assistance...

209
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,400
- Anything at all?
- Maybe later.

210
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,900
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.

211
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,900
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating this.

212
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,200
l feel lucky. Shall we double?

213
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Of course.

214
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,300
20,000 rupees.

215
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,900
- Always a double six when you need it.
- Always.

216
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,800
- How do you do it.
- lt's all in the wrist.

217
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,300
- lt's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?

218
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,900
- Same stake?
- Yes, l'll have another go.

219
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,100
Your luck's got to run out some time.

220
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,000
May l join you?

221
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

222
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,500
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.

223
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,900
You have a good memory for faces.

224
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,300
And figures.

225
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,000
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.

226
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,600
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

227
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,300
Some other time, perhaps?

228
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
Thank you.

229
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,200
Six and one.

230
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,900
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.

231
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,400
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 100,000 rupees.

232
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,700
l can't accept. Not with your luck.

233
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,800
You win.

234
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,800
l would have taken that double, myself.

235
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,700
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?

236
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Bond.

237
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
James Bond. Thank you, l'd be delighted.

238
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,700
100,000 rupees, then.

239
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,400
Double six.

240
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,500
Not such a good double to accept,
after all, was it?

241
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,200
- Double.
- Of course.

242
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,000
You can only win with a double six.

243
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,200
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?

244
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,500
Well, l think that this
should be ample security.

245
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,300
Don't you?

246
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,100
Play, Mr Bond.

247
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,200
You'll need a great deal of luck
to get out of this.

248
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,300
Oh, luck?

249
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,200
Well, then l shall use player's privilege,

250
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
and use your lucky dice.

251
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,500
lt's all in the wrist.

252
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Double sixes.

253
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,900
Fancy that.

254
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
200,000 rupees.

255
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,500
l prefer cash.

256
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,500
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,800
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

258
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,900
l intend to, Kamal Khan.

259
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,900
My security.

260
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
And yours?

261
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,300
lt's not really in the wrist, you know.

262
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,000
- Should l be following them?
- Yes, but l think they'll be following this.

263
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,500
Thank you.

264
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,200
Vijay will take you from here.
l'll see if l can find out more about Kamal.

265
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

266
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,200
Keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?

267
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,900
Thank you.
lt's a wonderful racket, this.

268
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,500
- Vijay, we have company.
- No problem. This is a company car.

269
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,400
Step on it.

270
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,700
This should shake 'em off.

271
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,500
Thank God for hard currency.

272
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,200
Game, set and match. Hang on, James.

273
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,100
Keep your head down.

274
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,100
Thank you.

275
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,600
Get off my bed.

276
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,900
Here. Catch.

277
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Excuse me.

278
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,400
Thank you.
You'd better stick this back yourself.

279
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,100
James, over here. Come on.

280
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,400
Vijay. The money l gave you.

281
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,800
Here. Rupees!

282
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,300
Easy come, easy go.

283
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,500
lt pays to advertise.

284
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,700
This way, James.

285
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Ah, Q.

286
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,400
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

287
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,500
How can l be expected
to maintain the quality of my work?

288
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Sent out here at a moment's notice.

289
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Have you any smaller thread?
Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.

290
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,400
Pity they missed you.

291
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,100
Karen, see to that, will you?

292
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,500
l've also mislaid my PPK.

293
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,500
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

294
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,000
Blast.

295
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,900
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

296
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,000
Experimental model.

297
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,300
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.

298
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
- Smashing, Q.
- Come on. l have a few things for you.

299
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,200
Very nice, Smithers.

300
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
ls the homing device ready yet?

301
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,000
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone as well.

302
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,200
lt goes in there like that.

303
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,000
Now, take a fountain pen.

304
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,900
Twist the top,

305
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,200
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

306
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,800
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters.

307
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,500
Pay attention, 007.

308
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,700
Pull the top off the pen.

309
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,700
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.

310
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,200
The homing device is compatible with
the radio directional finder in your watch.

311
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,800
lf you haven't lost it.

312
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,900
That's amazing, Q. lt does work.

313
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,000
What's that?

314
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,600
That's the latest liquid-crystal TV.

315
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,800
Very handy.

316
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,100
Perfect image, Q.

317
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,200
Really, 007.

318
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,100
Look, l haven't time
for these adolescent antics.

319
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,800
- lt's the best we can do.
- lt's beautiful. Thank you.

320
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,500
Go on, get along. l've got my work to do.

321
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
- l'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.

322
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,700
Don't forget this.

323
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,500
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits.

324
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,800
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

325
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,500
- l didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.

326
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,600
This way, please.

327
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,200
Thank you.

328
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,100
You changed your mind.

329
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,700
- l'm glad.
- Are you?

330
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,200
Well, let's put it this way.

331
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,200
So far, you are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends.

332
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,300
Thank you.

333
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,000
So does he have
a proposition for me, or do you?

334
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,300
He suggests a trade.

335
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,600
The egg for your life.

336
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,900
l'd heard the price of eggs
was going up, but isn't that a little high?

337
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,300
Charge it to Room...?

338
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,300
Oh, 27.
Along with the champagne, l suppose?

339
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,700
l'll leave it at the desk.

340
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,600
You don't mind?

341
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,300
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what l look like already?

342
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,800
lt's for me.

343
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,000
So that if l depart this world suddenly,

344
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,100
you'll have something
to remember me by?

345
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,500
Something like that.

346
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,900
lt's for my scrapbook. l collect memories.

347
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,100
Well, let's get on with making a few.

348
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,800
l need refilling.

349
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,900
Of course you do.

350
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,000
l'll get some more.

351
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,700
Don't bother.
We'll make yours a loving cup.

352
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,400
What a good idea.

353
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,000
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

354
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,600
That's my little octopussy.

355
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,300
Good morning.

356
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,300
Morning.

357
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,900
l didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,

358
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,200
l can say a proper goodbye.

359
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,200
What is the time?

360
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,400
Beautiful view, isn't it?

361
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,200
- l don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.

362
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,900
So right.

363
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,900
ln. Out. ln. Out.

364
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,400
Come on, girls. ln. Out.

365
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Check oars.

366
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,700
The egg has been recovered.

367
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,300
You should be pleased.

368
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,900
l'm not pleased
it was stolen in the first place.

369
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,800
Nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here.

370
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,400
He's obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind.

371
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,500
Anyway, l have him as my guest
at the Monsoon Palace.

372
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,000
And he will tell us
all he knows very quickly.

373
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,900
- Who is he?
- Englishman.

374
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,600
Likes eggs. Preferably Fabergé.

375
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,600
And dice. Preferably loaded.

376
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,000
His name is James Bond.

377
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,700
Bring him here.

378
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,100
He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.

379
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,800
No.

380
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,700
A ''no'' from you
has little chance of becoming a ''yes''.

381
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,900
l assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over.

382
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,200
But you're making a serious mistake.

383
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,500
Well, so far l can't complain
about the valet service.

384
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,500
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

385
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,900
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.

386
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,800
Well rested?

387
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,200
l believe you and Miss Magda have met.

388
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,400
- lt was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.

389
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,400
You don't mind if we start?
The soufflé can't wait.

390
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,600
At the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation,

391
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,400
may l ask exactly why l am here?

392
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,500
l mean, after all, you do have the egg.

393
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,100
True. But we don't have all the answers.

394
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,700
Well, supposing, for argument's sake,
l don't feel like talking?

395
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,300
Don't worry, you will.

396
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,900
Let me guess.

397
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,400
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

398
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,000
Hardly. We're much more
sophisticated than that.

399
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,800
- Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.

400
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,100
We prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound.

401
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,500
Guaranteed results.

402
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,000
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.

403
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,900
One of our specialities.

404
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,900
Stuffed sheep's head.

405
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,300
lt's odd, but when l'm stared at
l seem to lose my appetite.

406
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,200
Oh, thank you for dinner.

407
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,400
Until tomorrow, then.

408
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,100
- Well, l'll say good night.
- l could come in for a nightcap.

409
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,800
Some other time, perhaps.

410
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,200
l don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap? No.

411
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,800
l trust you had a pleasant flight.

412
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,600
lf you step this way,
l think you will find everything is in order.

413
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Congratulations on the quality of
your workmanship, Kamal Khan.

414
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,900
Thank you, General Orlov.

415
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,100
As you can see, each piece
has been meticulously duplicated

416
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,600
according to Lenkin's specifications.

417
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,800
Good. Have it put aboard the helicopter.

418
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,900
- Can they be trusted?
- l assure you oftheir silence.

419
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,600
We are both playing for enormous stakes.

420
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,200
l get what l want,
then you get the genuine jewellery.

421
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,600
Exactly...

422
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,700
The precise timing will be essential.

423
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,000
Remember: nothing must be changed.

424
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,800
One week from today, in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

425
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,500
- Karl-Marx-Stadt.
- Correct.

426
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,900
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.

427
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,700
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice ofthe thief.

428
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,100
He must be eliminated at once.

429
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,800
There must be no further security breach.

430
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,200
This fake has caused enough trouble.

431
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,300
l must go.

432
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,300
Everything has been most satisfactory.

433
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Most kind, General Orlov.

434
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,400
Get Bond.

435
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,700
The Englishman has escaped.

436
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,700
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

437
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,500
Good.

438
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,000
Let the sport commence.

439
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,300
Head him off.

440
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,900
Sit!

441
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,100
We have him.

442
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,400
Go round. He's in there.

443
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,000
Hiss off.

444
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,100
Don't let him get away.

445
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,900
C'mom, buddy, c'mon.

446
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,500
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- l'm fine.

447
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,900
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. l'm with the economy tour.

448
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,900
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.

449
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,700
Soon to be made extinct.

450
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,600
Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venom
that's invariably fatal in seconds.

451
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,500
The barge had that sign.

452
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,400
lt belongs to a wealthy woman
who lives on the floating palace.

453
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,000
Who?

454
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,600
No one knows her real name,
but she's known as Octopussy.

455
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That's the name l heard at Kamal's.

456
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,400
l hear that island's full of
beautiful women. No men allowed.

457
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,700
Really? Sexual discrimination.

458
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,800
l'll definitely have to pay it a visit.

459
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,700
Good evening.

460
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,200
l wondered when you might arrive.

461
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,700
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.

462
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,200
And you are James Bond.

463
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,900
007, licensed to kill.

464
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Am l to be your target for tonight?

465
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,500
Not necessarily.

466
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,100
Depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling.

467
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,200
And why one of our agents
was killed in East Berlin.

468
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,400
l know nothing about that.

469
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,000
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?

470
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,200
You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?

471
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,000
You seem to have done your homework.

472
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,500
Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliant
military career, joined our secret service.

473
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:57,600
His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.

474
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,600
Both he and his native guide disappeared.

475
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,300
The gold was never found.

476
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,100
And 20 years later
you were sent after him.

477
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:14,600
The guide's body turned up with a bullet
still in his skull from Smythe's revolver.

478
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,300
l traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,

479
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,500
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before l took him back.

480
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,800
He committed suicide rather than
face the disgrace of a court martial.

481
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,300
What's the connection?

482
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,500
He was my father. l'd hoped
fate would bring us together one day.

483
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,900
To avenge him?

484
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,600
To thank you for giving him
an honourable alternative.

485
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,700
Come in.

486
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,900
Kamal Khan to see you.

487
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Bond has escaped.

488
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
- How careless of you.
- l apologise.

489
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,500
By the way, l'd like you
to meet my new house guest.

490
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,100
An old friend of the family, you might say.

491
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,200
How lovely.

492
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,000
You have a nasty habit of surviving.

493
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,500
You know what they say about the fittest.

494
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:24,600
Octopussy, l'd enjoy another opportunity
to take care of Mr Bond personally.

495
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,700
l will take care of Mr Bond myself.

496
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,900
Good night.

497
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,000
And enjoy yourselves.

498
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
Mr Bond.

499
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,200
My father became
a leading authority on octopi.

500
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,900
He loved them.
His pet name for me was Octopussy.

501
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:01,400
Mr Bond, smuggling is
no concern of the secret service.

502
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,400
l've violated no British law.

503
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,000
You are free to leave, but l'd much prefer
if you stayed as my guest for a few days.

504
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,200
l'd like that.

505
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,700
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.

506
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,100
Good night, Mr Bond.

507
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,400
Till the morning, then.

508
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,900
Midge.

509
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,100
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy,
but double the guard on his quarters.

510
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,100
He says the island is heavily guarded.

511
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,600
We don't want to
make enemies with the woman.

512
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,500
The woman must not be harmed.

513
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,300
When Father's gold ran out, the people in
Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him

514
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,800
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds.

515
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,100
l discovered l had a talent for it.

516
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,300
You went into business for yourself?

517
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,700
Yes, but l needed an organisation,
so l revived the old Octopus cult.

518
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,500
Well, then.
Where did you recruit all these lovelies?

519
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,400
There are many of them
all over Southeast Asia,

520
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:22,000
looking for a guru,
spiritual discipline, who knows what.

521
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:27,300
l train them. Give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of life.

522
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:30,200
- ln crime?
- ln business.

523
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:34,700
l have diversified into
shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.

524
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,900
- ls he still there?
- You must be joking.

525
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,800
007 on an island
populated exclusively by women?

526
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,500
We won't see him till dawn.

527
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,200
- l'll relieve you at midnight.
- No problem.

528
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,400
Are we going somewhere?

529
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,400
l have to go to Europe tomorrow
on a business trip.

530
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,800
Oh, that's a pity.
l was just beginning to enjoy myself.

531
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,700
l think you should stay.
l'll only be gone a week.

532
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,200
When l come back
we'll discuss the future.

533
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,100
Well, l can't guarantee
that l'll be here when you return.

534
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,700
Oh, James. We're two of a kind.

535
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:45,100
There are vast rewards for a man
of your talents willing to take risks.

536
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,200
- l'm not for hire.
- A man of principle.

537
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,300
With a price on his head.

538
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,400
Naturally, you would do it
for Queen and country.

539
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,400
l have no country,
l have no price on my head.

540
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,400
l don't have to apologise to you,
a paid assassin, for what l am.

541
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,400
No.

542
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,700
You're right.

543
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,200
We are two of a kind.

544
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,900
James.

545
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,500
Q?

546
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,600
ls something wrong?

547
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,800
Not really.

548
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,000
Just a feeling.

549
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,300
Why don't you come back to bed?

550
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,700
Move!

551
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,400
James.

552
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,200
Watch it!

553
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,000
Come on.

554
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,300
Careful.

555
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,800
The gun!

556
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,800
What happened to Vijay?

557
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,700
He was alive when l found him.

558
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
- Did he say anything?
- Only ''lt was Kamal's men.''

559
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,000
No more problems.

560
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,500
- Better signal M to meet me in Berlin.
- Why?

561
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,100
Well, l have to go to a circus
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

562
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,100
We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East Berlin when we lost 009.

563
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,100
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.

564
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:35,600
Why would General Orlov
participate in a jewellery caper?

565
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,700
Well, the jewellery, sir,
l think is, if you'll forgive the analogy,

566
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
only the tip of the tentacle.

567
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,500
Here's the lD you'll need.

568
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,700
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds

569
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,200
visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.

570
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,700
- Karl will take you in.
- No problem.

571
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,500
Remember, 007, you're on your own.

572
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,100
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.

573
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,800
Mischka.

574
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,200
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.

575
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,300
He just arrived from Leningrad.

576
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,600
The Romanov Star.

577
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,000
The Romanov Star.

578
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:10,200
Stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track.

579
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
You stay, also.

580
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,300
100 kiloton yield.

581
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:40,400
The effects are indistinguishable
from the American medium-yield bomb.

582
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:47,600
The detonator, now listen carefully.
lt is pre-set for a four-hour delay.

583
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Set time for the explosion here.

584
01:28:54,400 --> 01:29:01,800
To activate, insert and twist
the lever a quarter-turn clockwise.

585
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:07,100
Be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off, hm?

586
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,600
The jewellery should net us
300 million in Zürich.

587
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,800
We still have to cross the border.

588
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
l must go.

589
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,000
Au revoir, dear lady.

590
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,500
Good luck.

591
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,900
Bring the canister.

592
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,600
Put it in the car.

593
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,900
Leave that. Let's go.

594
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:37,900
Let's stay. Sit on that box.
Hands on your knees. Come on, move.

595
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,300
Why is that bomb on the train?

596
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,200
- Who are you?
- British secret service.

597
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,200
You should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive.

598
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:59,200
l am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.

599
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,700
You can't be inviting a nuclear war.
What happens when the US retaliates?

600
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,900
Against whom?

601
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,600
My God. Of course.

602
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:15,100
Our early-warning system will rule out
the bomb having come from Russia

603
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,400
or anywhere else.

604
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:22,300
Everyone will assume incorrectly that
it was a US bomb triggered accidentally.

605
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:26,900
That would be
the most plausible explanation.

606
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,800
Europe will insist on disarmament,

607
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,500
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will.

608
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,100
lt doesn't matter a damn to you

609
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,800
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident.

610
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,100
Better than letting
a handful of old men in Moscow

611
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:47,300
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks.

612
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,600
On your feet, General.
You're going to stop that train.

613
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:57,400
- Too late.
- You can stop it at the border.

614
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,100
Kill him!

615
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:33,500
Kill him!

616
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,000
Get to the station!

617
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,200
Stop that car!

618
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,600
Stop.

619
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,900
Follow that car.

620
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:23,300
Kamal Khan says we are to stay here
until we cross the border.

621
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,900
The licence plate is General Orlov's.

622
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,400
We have discovered this.

623
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:45,000
- Where is General Orlov now?
- Last reported heading for the border.

624
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,100
l must get to that train.

625
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Stop!

626
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,900
A common thief.

627
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,900
A disgrace to the uniform.

628
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,000
Yes. But tomorrow...

629
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:49,400
l shall be a hero...

630
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,800
of the Soviet Union.

631
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,300
lt is now 1 1 .45.

632
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,800
The performance begins at 3.

633
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,300
Allowing for delays,
set the bomb to detonate at 3.45.

634
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,600
We must leave the base by 3.1 5.

635
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,900
l take it none of you will be late.

636
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,400
The jewellery.

637
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,900
- Did you recognise him?
- No.

638
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:18,100
Stay here with her.

639
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,300
On the roof. Trouble.

640
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,500
Mischka.

641
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,500
And this...

642
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,400
for my brother.

643
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,300
And that's for 009.

644
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Gobinda will stay with the jewellery.

645
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:56,200
General, excuse me. l have some travel
arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.

646
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,400
- Thank you.
- l'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this.

647
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,900
l know he won't be disappointed.

648
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,800
- That was Bond.
- Good. Let him keep going.

649
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,200
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too.

650
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,500
Great, isn't it?

651
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:47,600
Fantastic.

652
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:55,100
- Marvellous.
- General...

653
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:58,100
How long would l get
in the brig if l stole your wallet?

654
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,400
- About two years.
- That long?

655
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:03,400
Well, in that case, l'd better return it.

656
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,300
Son of a gun.

657
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,500
- Where's the Base Commander?
- Let's see your circus pass.

658
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:21,600
Damn it, man, it's urgent.

659
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:23,700
Get out. Hands up!

660
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:37,900
Some nut in a red shirt went through in
a stolen car. Wants the Base Commander.

661
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,800
There he is.

662
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,900
Go after that guy in the red shirt.

663
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:50,200
Behind the trailers.

664
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:14,200
Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

665
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:20,400
Look under the trailer, you guys.

666
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:54,500
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Hey. ls anyone else in there?

667
01:52:54,700 --> 01:53:01,600
For the first time in this country,
the death-defying human cannonball.

668
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:08,200
l have the pleasure in presenting to you
Francisco the Fearless.

669
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,300
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.

670
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:27,000
That's him.

671
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,300
Hold it, buddy. You're coming with us.

672
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:53,900
- General, there's a bomb in that cannon.
- Sure. Where else would a bomb be?

673
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:58,200
- Great clown.
- l'm deadly serious. l'm a British agent.

674
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,200
- What?
- For God's sake, tell him who l am.

675
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:06,100
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you.
l saw them take the jewellery off the train.

676
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,700
Does that convince you?

677
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,100
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45.
That's 90 seconds from now.

678
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,000
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.

679
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,600
He'll destroy the entire operation.

680
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:48,100
You two, grab that man. Hold him.

681
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:51,000
Damn it. Let go.

682
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:54,900
Let me go, there's a bomb in there.

683
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,400
Let him go.

684
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,500
Quiet, everyone.

685
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:29,400
Now?

686
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,100
Thank you. Great job, sir.

687
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:35,400
Where was Kamal going?

688
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,800
Back to lndia.

689
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:46,900
Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.

690
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,500
You and your families are safe.

691
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,200
Now, please leave the tent
in an orderly manner. Thank you.

692
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,300
- The plane is refuelled.
- We'll take off at sunrise.

693
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:05,600
- Are the gold certificates on board?
- Yes, Excellence.

694
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:11,200
We'll take these also.
Dollars, pounds, francs, marks.

695
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,800
l can always print my own.

696
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,600
- What is that?
- Girls selling themselves.

697
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:24,000
Good. lt will keep the men occupied.

698
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:26,300
l don't want them to see me leave.

699
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:37,000
Now.

700
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,000
Give us a hand.

701
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,800
Come on.

702
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,500
Let's go. All set?

703
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,500
Lift.

704
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,900
That's it. Steady.

705
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,300
- Make sure the horses are saddled.
- Yes, Excellence.

706
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:30,100
l'll join you in a few minutes.

707
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:48,200
- Do you really think you can escape me?
- Orlov betrayed us.

708
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:51,200
l swear l knew nothing about the bomb.

709
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:57,600
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy,
l would never do anything to hurt you.

710
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:14,500
You left me to be killed
along with thousands of innocent people.

711
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,300
Octopussy.

712
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,400
Octopussy.

713
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:24,500
Look. l was bringing you this.
We can make millions.

714
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:32,300
Take her. She's our ticket out of here.

715
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:58,500
- l trust you can handle this contraption.
- lt goes by hot air.

716
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:00,800
Oh, then you can.

717
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:13,700
- They're doing fine.
- But l don't see Octopussy.

718
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,700
- There she is. She's in trouble.
- Get your hands off me.

719
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,700
- l'll take her down.
- No. Up!

720
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:42,000
Where are you going?
Look, don't be an idiot, 007. Come back.

721
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:52,600
Kill him.

722
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Come on.

723
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:27,200
What are you doing? Cut it out.
We haven't time for that. Later perhaps.

724
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,400
Come on. Giddap.

725
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,300
Come on.

726
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:42,300
He'll kill us all. Go out and get him.

727
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:44,600
- Out there?
- Go.

728
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:46,700
Yes, Excellence.

729
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,900
Jump!

730
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:38,800
My government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred.

731
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:44,700
However, we request Bond to return
one of our most historic treasures -

732
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,600
the Romanov Star.

733
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:51,400
ln the interests of our Anglo-Soviet
relationships, that can be arranged.

734
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,300
Where is Commander Bond?

735
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:59,700
Owing to the serious nature of his
injuries, he's still not fit enough to travel.

736
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:03,900
ln. Out. ln. Out.

737
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,500
- l wish...
- What?

738
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:26,200
l wish you weren't
in such a weakened condition.

739
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,700
James!
