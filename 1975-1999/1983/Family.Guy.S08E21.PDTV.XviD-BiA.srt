00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,049
(Salve Regina College
20 year reunion)

2
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:40,175
Oh, I can't wait to see all my old classmates.

3
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:42,625
This is gonna be so much fun, isn't it, Peter?

4
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:45,420
Oh, sure, it's a blast being in a room
full of people you don't know.

5
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,601
Rather stay home and watch grass grow.

6
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,221
Come on you, come on.

7
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,449
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Joe.

8
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:52,664
Dammit.

9
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,554
You are not uncomfortable, are you?

10
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:56,090
Look, I'm just not wild about the idea

11
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,412
of running into anybody
you used to date, that's all.

12
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:01,233
Oh boy, speaking of exes, here comes one now.

13
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:03,039
Oh man, this is what I was afraid of.

14
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,323
If he tries anything while
I'm standing here,

15
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:07,643
I'm gonna kick him right
in the ball...gina.

16
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:09,262
Peter, this is Naomi.

17
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,623
Wait, you mean, you two used to, you know,

18
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:14,350
bump japanese cartoon monkey logo mouth.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,817
Well, let's just say Naomi and I
experimented quite a bit in college.

20
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:22,097
No way, my wife messed around
with another chick.

21
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:23,602
Thank you, God.

22
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:24,938
Don't mention it, Peter.

23
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:28,514
God. He knows what turns you on!

24
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:29,392
Have fun.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,902
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.

26
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:34,008
I haven't see you in... what, twenty years.

27
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:37,221
Oh, it's great to see you too, Lois.
It really is.

28
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:40,435
You know, the fact is I came here
hoping to run into you.

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,635
Really? Well, that's nice.

30
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:45,578
You see, I'd like to propose
something to you and your husband.

31
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:46,847
Oh my god.

32
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,780
I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming right now.

33
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:51,372
Of course, Naomi, what
do you have in mind?

34
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,125
Well, this really isn't
a place to discuss it.

35
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:58,638
It's just something I was wondering if you
and your husband would participate in.

36
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:00,123
I'm totally dreaming right now.

37
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,782
Well, as long as I'm dreaming
I might as well pee my pants.

38
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:07,710
Well, Naomi, whatever it is,
I'm sure we'd be happy to help.

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,478
Oh my god, I don't believe it.

40
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:11,084
I'm gonna have a three-way!

41
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:16,920
We now return to "Nature"
with a guy named Terry in it.

42
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,537
The cheetahs will feed through the night.

43
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:25,308
While the strongest made the kill,
the oldest will eat first.

44
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,279
And there's Terry.

45
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,559
All right, come on, guys,
she's gonna be here any minute.

46
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,450
You got to get out of here.

47
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,975
Why do we have to leave, dad?

48
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:35,253
Cause you daddy is gonna have a three-way
with your mother and her friend.

49
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,724
Isn't that nice about daddy's three-way?

50
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:39,559
I had a one-way one time.

51
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:41,962
That was amazing.

52
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,316
Sorry I farted in the middle.

53
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,016
All right, go on,
beat it, all of you.

54
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,689
Peter, you are not gonna be having
a three-way with Lois and her friend.

55
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:49,944
Lois isn't even into women.

56
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,776
She just had that one experience
in college with that girl Naomi.

57
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:54,410
Naomi's the one who is coming.

58
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,595
Let me stay, let me stay!

59
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,106
Peter, why are you so antsy?

60
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,947
Because Naomi will be here shortly,
and I'm anxious to get started.

61
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:05,739
What do you mean?
We don't even know why she's coming.

62
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:08,952
We don't... We don't even know why she's coming.

63
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:11,395
You are so adorable,
I'm gonna do you second.

64
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:15,493
Hi, Naomi.

65
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:18,206
You picked up those tearaway
panties like I texted you?

66
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:20,156
I didn't get a text from you.

67
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,694
All right. Not sure why, but I'll bite.

68
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:24,450
Hi, Naomi.

69
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,516
Hello, Lois.

70
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,339
I want you to meet my husband, Dale.

71
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,824
Hi, nice to meet you, Dale.

72
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:32,036
Dale! All right, I guess,
but I'm doing you last.

73
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:33,914
Joke's on him. I only got two in me.

74
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,317
Lois, this is such a lovely home.

75
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,559
Oh, thank you.

76
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,705
Peter and I did it ourselves
on a shoe-string.

77
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,258
Well, you could have fooled me.

78
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,514
Well, let me show you around.

79
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,039
This here is our living room.

80
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,888
All right, you guys, I've got a few
porn scenarios for you to choose from

81
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,224
Hey everybody.

82
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:52,010
Got a pizza delivery for this sorority house.

83
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,547
Did somebody order sausage?

84
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,147
Peter, what the hell are you doing?
Knock it off.

85
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:04,022
We brought you some wine.
But it's best chilled before dinner.

86
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:06,134
Oh, that is so nice of you.

87
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:07,497
Yeah, let's put it on ice.

88
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,980
Oh, you have to excuse my kitchen,
I've been cooking all...

89
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,679
Girls, I've just finished grading
your midterms, and it's not good news.

90
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,929
Looks like you're gonnna
have to do some extra credit.

91
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,180
Peter, what the hell?

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,367
I am so sorry about this.

93
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:26,983
Look, dinner is just about ready.

94
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:30,250
Why don't I get you seated in the dining
room and then we'll pour the wine.

95
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:33,341
All right, new arrivals.

96
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:36,526
There's only one way
you're not getting on that train.

97
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:47,460
And so I went into corporate finance
and that's where I met Dale.

98
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,025
Six months later I was
asking her to marry me.

99
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,630
What took me so long, right?

100
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,266
All right, we're running out of time. Are
we going to get this orgy started or what?

101
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:57,117
What?

102
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,722
We're running out of time.

103
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:05,214
Are we going to get this
orgy started or what?

104
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,725
Oh my god. You thought
that's what we're here for?

105
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,534
You're not?

106
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,439
No!

107
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,613
Then what are you doing here?

108
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,782
Well, Dale and I found out
that we can't have children.

109
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:17,424
We've conceived many times, but
for some reason the eggs won't attach.

110
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:19,530
And it was suggested
that I find a healthy woman

111
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,609
who would considered
carrying our child to term.

112
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,769
And well, Lois, that's why we're here.

113
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:26,207
We were wondering if you
would be our surrogate.

114
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:29,851
Oh my god. You want me
to carry your child?

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,661
Yes.

116
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,471
What?

117
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,441
All right, Peter, I don't know
what this is about,

118
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:36,533
but you're my best friend and I'd like
to think that you do the same for me.

119
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,352
Wait a minute, so you
guys can't have a baby?

120
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:44,661
Unfortunately, no.

121
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:45,687
Well, who's fault is it?

122
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:48,627
I mean... I mean which one of you has the
thing that's horribly wrong with them.

123
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,067
Is that you, Naomi?
You got a bum cervix?

124
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:54,493
Peter, it's nobody's faults.
Conception is complicated.

125
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,691
Dale, it's you, isn't it?
You've got a bum dong.

126
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,221
Will you help us, Lois?

127
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:01,580
Well, I'm honoured that you
would ask me, Naomi.

128
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,114
Yeah, I'll have to think about it.

129
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,186
To me this is a life altering choice.

130
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:08,030
You know, like an italian
choosing to get glasses.

131
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:10,333
Okay, read the third row down, please.

132
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,302
Everyone, I have something to say.

133
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:22,252
I've given this long and careful thought

134
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:25,174
and I decided to carry
Naomi and Dale's child for them.

135
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,095
You what?!

136
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,492
That's right.
And I want your blessing, Peter.

137
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,808
You'll have my stool in your eye,
that's all you'll get.

138
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,986
You can't have their baby.

139
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,224
Yeah, mom, you get crazy when you're pregnant.

140
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:37,001
Mom, I can't find my jacket.

141
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,570
Peter, take off that belt!

142
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,682
That buckle smells like acid!

143
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:01,993
Look, I know it's an inconvenience,

144
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,621
but it's a wonderful gift
to be able to give someone,

145
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,470
so I am going through with it.

146
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,980
Well, I support you, Lois.
I think it's great what you're doing.

147
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,853
Yeah, it's great.

148
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:11,953
You're treating your vagina
like a Red Roof Inn.

149
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:12,946
That's not how it is, Stewie.

150
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:15,770
She's doing something wonderful for a couple
who can't have their own children

151
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,431
and are too egoitistical to adopt.

152
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,836
Lois, I don't want you walking around
all pregnant for nine months,

153
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,557
just to hand over that thing
when it comes out like a hen to a farmer.

154
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:23,790
I mean, why is it got to be you?

155
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,128
Because they need a healthy
female body to carry the baby.

156
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,001
I can do it!

157
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,048
Oh, come on, Meg.

158
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,601
It was hard enough on your body
when you gave birth to Stewie.

159
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,423
What?

160
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,264
I'm just joking.

161
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:37,147
Oh, not cool.

162
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:40,106
But really, Meg, you don't know
anything about this stuff.

163
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,620
You've never even had a boyfriend
more than a few weeks.

164
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,663
I have too.

165
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:45,371
Remember when I dated the Count?

166
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,361
One nipple.

167
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:50,286
Two nipples.

168
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:54,349
Three nip... Oh hell no, I'm outta here.

169
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,545
All right then, it's settled.
I'm gonna do this.

170
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:00,106
No, you are not, Lois.
I'm sorry, but I forbid it.

171
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,280
Oh, and I'm supposed to blindly go along with
everything you decide for the both of us?

172
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,425
Yes, Lois, that's how we co-exist.

173
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:09,935
Just like I co-exist with the tiny race
of people who live in our carpet.

174
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,641
Dad, what's that? I think I hear music.

175
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,507
Oh, that's the little people, Chris.

176
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,517
They're playing music so that
I will bless them with food.

177
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,953
Lois, Dale and I just want to thank you again.

178
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,550
You're making us so happy.

179
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,380
Well, I wish my husband felt
the same way you do, but...

180
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,119
He's just gonna have to accept it.

181
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,639
Now, Mrs. Griffin,
you should understand,

182
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,868
a procedure like this
is not without its risks.

183
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,425
For example, here's what happened,
when we fertilized an egg from Shelly Duvall

184
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:44,101
with a sperm from James Blunt.

185
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,326
Here's Hilary Swank and Gary Busey.

186
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,045
Florence Griffith-Joyner and Stephen Hawking.

187
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:51,531
Okay, I think that's enough.

188
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:54,140
I got more funny ones, I got
Tina Fey and Joaquin Phoenix.

189
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,122
Yeah, I think we're fine.

190
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:56,750
Lot of face stuff going on on that one.

191
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,920
Yeah, let's just get to it.

192
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,086
Okay. So, the eggs have
already been fertilized

193
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,632
by means of intracytoplasmic
sperm injection.

194
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,753
And now the embryos will be inserted.

195
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:08,307
The insertion procedure
will be performed

196
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,697
by these south-american
Hovitos blow gunners.

197
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:13,585
Wait a minute, I don't want them shooting
things into my vagina.

198
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,913
Well, perhaps you could tell them.

199
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,858
If only you spoke Hovitos.

200
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:23,118
(Pregnancy test)

201
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,099
Can't believe she went ahead and did it.

202
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,186
After I specifically told her how I felt.

203
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,873
Well, clearly she believed
that it was within her right...

204
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:34,305
Lois just peed on something.

205
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:35,934
- Hey, Brian, you're picking up on that?
- Yeah.

206
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:38,764
It worked, everybody, I'm pregnant!

207
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,282
Dammit, this is going too far.

208
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:43,049
And if I'm gonna do something
about it, it's gonna be now.

209
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:44,178
What do you mean, what are you gonna do?

210
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,506
I'm not gonna do anything, Brian.

211
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,514
But sometimes things happen.

212
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:50,613
The house is a dangerous place
for today's modern woman.

213
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:54,044
Rickety staircases, faulty wiring,
gay poltergeists.

214
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,174
Boo!

215
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:57,755
To that outfit.

216
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:05,551
Lois, I've hired some
1980s black breakdancers

217
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,021
to do their routine on your stomach.

218
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:10,049
Peter, come on! I'm having this baby
and that's the end of it.

219
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,944
But Lois, if they do it good enough,
they'll save the rec center

220
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:15,046
from being torn down
and replaced by some mall.

221
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,086
Ozone, Turbo, do your thing.

222
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,173
Oh no, Lois, those are 90s black guys.

223
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:22,190
Those aren't 80s black guys at all. Run!

224
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:24,688
We're here to dance for the kids.

225
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,990
Run, 80s black guys. You are no match
for the 90s black guys.

226
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,291
(Acme miscarriage kit)

227
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:41,299
(Free Grey's Anatomy DVDs)

228
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,705
Lois, I bet I can drink more "Bleach" than you.

229
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,702
Okay, you know what, Peter? Stop it.

230
00:11:57,742 --> 00:11:59,195
I know you are not happy about this,

231
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,668
but I am pregnant, and I am having this baby.

232
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,617
So knock it off, because I have had it.

233
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,916
No, I've had it!
I don't want you pregnant.

234
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,313
You'll be fat and cranky,
and your boobs will get bigger,

235
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,755
and you'll stop having your period.

236
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,230
Wait, how I feel about this?

237
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,862
No. No! I'm against that, I say.

238
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:14,464
Peter, this is important.

239
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:16,956
Naomi and Dale are placing
their trust in us.

240
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:20,909
And besides, it's just nine months,
then everything will be back to normal.

241
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,350
We interrupt this programs
for a breaking news story.

242
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,969
A devastating pile-up on I-95 has injured
eight people and killed two others.

243
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,877
Naomi and Dale Robinson were pronounced
dead on arrival at Quahog hospital.

244
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,668
Oh my god!

245
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,147
Another news: a local man has won the lottery.

246
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:39,635
Lucky Quahog resident Dale Robinson
has hit the jack... Oh boy.

247
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:46,085
I stil just... I can't
believe they're gone.

248
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,114
They had the whole lives ahead of them.

249
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:49,445
Well, I'll be the one to say it.

250
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,999
What are you gonna do about the baby?

251
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,938
Let's keep it for parts.

252
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:54,640
You know, Lois, you're not a young woman.

253
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,918
Odds are that baby is gonna be
chromosomally damaged.

254
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,348
Like those cats you see
in the special animal Olympics.

255
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:08,422
So, Whiskers, how does it feel to finally
win your event after years of training?

256
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,266
Why don't you put the baby up for adoption?

257
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:15,736
But what do we do until then?

258
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:18,173
I mean, we can't afford
nine months of medical bills.

259
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:20,616
Well, you could... have an abortion.

260
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:22,258
There you go, Lois, we abort it.

261
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,723
Send it on up to Dale and Naomi.

262
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,256
Yeah, they're probably waiting for it anyway.

263
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:26,815
If they left their mittens
you wouldn't keep'em.

264
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,267
You'd send them back.
Abort the thing.

265
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:30,018
Well, I don't know, Peter.

266
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:32,168
Well, there is no harm in visiting
the family planning center

267
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,542
just to see what your options are.

268
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:36,136
It's such a big decision.

269
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:37,217
Of course it's a big decision.

270
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:38,654
Life is full of big decisions.

271
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,803
Like deciding whether or not
to have indian food.

272
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:43,397
Lois, do I need to do anything tomorrow

273
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:47,301
that doesn't involve me being bent over
in excruciating pain three feet from a toilet?

274
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:48,100
No.

275
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:50,821
Time for some tikka masala.

276
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,160
Doctor, I won't lie to you,

277
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,076
I'm a little uncertain about this.

278
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,093
That's perfectly natural, Mrs. Griffin.

279
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:02,523
And you should ask as many questions
as you can before you decide.

280
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,316
How does it work, Doc?

281
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:06,068
You strap it down and then
go hacking that like Sweeney Todd?

282
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,229
No, no, good lord.
This is not 2005.

283
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,036
We've come a long way since then.

284
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:13,090
Okay, what, so you go
stab it in there with a laser

285
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,079
and you try to zap it out?

286
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,359
Like, um, burning an ant with a magnifying glass?

287
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:18,536
No, Mr. Griffin.

288
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:21,862
What? So what? You like hold her legs
open and like send a pitbull in there?

289
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:24,079
You know, one of them little rat hunting dogs.

290
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:27,377
And then he comes back out
with it in his mouth and he goes...

291
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:30,443
You know, you can't get it away
from him, cause, you know, it's his thing.

292
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,398
No. Mr. Griffin, it's a very
simple safe procedure,

293
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:37,190
in which we very precisely
and delicately remove the embryo.

294
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,803
We do it all the time and
I promise it's virtually risks-free.

295
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,773
Well, I have to say I feel
a little better about it.

296
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,086
I think this may be
the right thing to do.

297
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:48,892
Mrs. Griffin, we have a saying around here.

298
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:51,725
Let's keep abortion safe,
legal and rare.

299
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:52,852
Okay, then why don't you get started.

300
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,007
I'm gonna go sit in the car 
and pretend like I'm driving.

301
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,282
I'm gonna be in a race.

302
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:03,292
Hey, what are you, guys, bellyaching about?

303
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:08,050
Sir, we are doing all that we can to stop
the killing of millions of unborn babies.

304
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,198
If you have a few moments, I'd like you
to watch this video presentation.

305
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,184
Yeah, I got a few minutes,
my wife is getting an abortion.

306
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:18,232
(Abortion Madness!)

307
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:19,521
Hello, friend.

308
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:22,014
I hear you contemplating having an abortion.

309
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:23,804
But before you do, remember:

310
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:26,280
science has proven that
within hours of conception

311
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:28,285
a human fetus has started a college fund

312
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:31,951
and has already made your first Mother's Day
card out of macaroni and glitter.

313
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,346
(Mom, don't kill me!
I wuv you!)

314
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:36,987
But don't take my word for it.

315
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:39,162
Just ask my little friend Ziggy.

316
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,676
Hi, I'm Ziggy the zygote.

317
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:45,477
I'm looking forward to being
an active member of your community.

318
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,718
Can I hug you?

319
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:48,955
Of course, you can, Ziggy.

320
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:52,652
Because even though they are not visible
yet, you already have tiny arms.

321
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,126
Arms, that will one day work,
play and fold in prayer.

322
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,346
Yay!

323
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,764
But uh-oh.

324
00:15:58,765 --> 00:15:59,831
What's this?

325
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh my god!

326
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,314
Well, he's gone.

327
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:06,899
Just like so many other
promising human lives,

328
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,044
who were probably snuffed out by abortion.

329
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,208
Like the guy who would have killed Hitler.

330
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,051
Nice going, schweinhund.

331
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,412
The Fourth Stooge.

332
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:17,239
That's right, there were
supposed to be four stooges.

333
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,466
It was gonna be hilarious!

334
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:23,339
And Osama bin Laden's
America loving older brother.

335
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,348
I would have talked him out of it.

336
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:29,316
Thanks a lot for 9/11 abortion enthusiasts.

337
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:31,671
And remember.
Not only is abortion murder.

338
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:35,263
But it's also a larceny, jaywalking
and securities fraud.

339
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:37,189
And did you know the baby you aborting

340
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,033
may also have a baby inside
of it that you're also aborting?

341
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:42,476
Now that you know this
do you want an abortion?

342
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,502
No! No, I do not!

343
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,042
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

344
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,629
Have you lost your mind?

345
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,581
Don't you worry, unborn fetus chid!

346
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:55,589
I am here to save you
and protect you.

347
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,068
I have seen the light!

348
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:00,028
Bless you, sir.
You should be very proud of yourself.

349
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,593
Oh, I am!
Prouder than when I was a peacock.

350
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:04,682
Griffin, nice work
on the Anderson account.

351
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,237
So how did it go at the clinic?

352
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:26,173
Fine at first, but then
there was a complication.

353
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,999
We have decided against the procedure.

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,818
Really? Why?

355
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:30,824
Because it's killing babies, Brian!

356
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:33,878
If god wanted us to kill babies,
he'd make them all Chinese girls.

357
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,072
Peter, it's not a baby,
it's a fertilized egg.

358
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:37,612
It's the size of the tip of the pin.

359
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:38,722
It's alive, isn't it?

360
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,968
To kill any living thing is an abortion.

361
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,302
That's what the man I've just
met outside the clinic told me.

362
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,918
And he had a T-shirt on
that confirmed it.

363
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,884
Peter, I'm sorry if you disagree with me.

364
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:51,114
But according to the law, it is still
my right to choose what I do with my body.

365
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:52,855
Well, the law is wrong, Lois.

366
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:55,944
Okay, Peter, if you're so pro-life,
let me ask you this.

367
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:59,565
Would you go down to the orphanage and
claim an unwanted baby and take care of it?

368
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:01,628
No, Lois, I'm here to save the unborn.

369
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:03,906
Once they get out of vagina,
they can go *** themselves.

370
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:07,239
Peter, what's inside of Lois won't be
remotely human for six months.

371
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,886
There's no brain activity
until at least the 27th week.

372
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,103
It's still a person, Brian!

373
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,575
It's a woman's responsibility
to carry it to term.

374
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:14,959
Well, what if the woman is raped?

375
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,275
Maybe she should have thought of that
before she asked me for directions.

376
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,198
What about incest, Peter?

377
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:20,246
What's incest?

378
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:23,106
You know how cousin Lou
has that kid who's eyes touch.

379
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,514
So what, you're saying Toucheyes
doesn't deserve to exist?

380
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:27,285
Well, you don't mind him
when you want a needle threaded.

381
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:30,111
I'm just saying that they should
have at least have the option.

382
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:31,105
How can you say that.

383
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,864
Think of all the love he's given
to uncle mom and aunt dad.

384
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,013
Okay, this argument isn't working.

385
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,224
Peter, what if carrying the baby to term
would endanger the mother's life?

386
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:40,129
I don't know what seven
of those words were.

387
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,599
What if you look at the ultrasound

388
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,657
and see that the baby is gonna
be born with no arms and no legs?

389
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:45,721
You name it Matt.

390
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,700
Peter, I honestly don't care what you say.

391
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,269
I am going back to that clinic
and I am having that abortion.

392
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,486
Oh no, you are not.

393
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:54,643
Oh yes, I am.

394
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:55,909
Now you get out of my way.

395
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,815
Lois, you go down there,
and I'll blow that place up.

396
00:18:57,816 --> 00:18:58,659
You wouldn't.

397
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,393
You've seen Family Guy,
You know I would.

398
00:19:00,394 --> 00:19:04,401
Oh, so what? You-you kill a bunch of doctors
to show that the killing is wrong?

399
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:06,290
Does that make sense to you, Peter?

400
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,013
Well...

401
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:07,769
Does it?

402
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:08,760
I...

403
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:10,304
guess not.

404
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,848
So what the hell do we do, huh?

405
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:16,713
And we would not gonna solve anything
by standing here and screaming at each other.

406
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:19,059
You and I are in this together, Peter.

407
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,389
And whatever we decide, we both have to
agree that it's the right thing to do.

408
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:24,836
Well, so now what?

409
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,860
Now I say we go upstairs
and have a long talk.

410
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:32,067
And we don't come down until we've made
a decision that we both can live with.

411
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,573
All right, Lois.

412
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,174
Well, I think we
made the right decision.

413
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,982
I mean, sure, having a baby costs a fortune.

414
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,363
There's cutbacks on things we love.

415
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:50,608
There's diapers, and crying,
and late nights with no sleep.

416
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:54,451
Flu shots, and mumps,
and drivers ed, and college tuition...

417
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:55,902
But you know what?

418
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,386
It's a one more person
to share the world with.

419
00:19:58,387 --> 00:20:01,235
Another little voice
in a back seat of the car.

420
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:05,254
One more Griffin to love
and to love us in return.

421
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:07,654
We have the abortion.

422
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:12,954
