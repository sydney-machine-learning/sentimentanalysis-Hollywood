1
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,109
What's your
name again?

2
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,402
Chrissie.

3
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,321
Where are we going?

4
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,488
Swimming.

5
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,578
Slow up. Slow down.

6
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,290
I'm not drunk!
Slow down!

7
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,668
Wait. I'm coming.

8
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,463
I'm coming.

9
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,507
I'm definitely coming.

10
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,675
Whoa.

11
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,302
Hold on. Whoa!

12
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,271
I can swim.

13
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,816
I just can't walk
or undress myself.

14
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,880
Come on in the water!

15
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,799
Take it easy.

16
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,879
Oh, God, help!

17
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,055
Please help me!

18
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,182
I'm coming.

19
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,769
It hurts!

20
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,517
...local
fishing reported good.

21
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,686
Amity Boat Rental Yard's
opening early

22
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,855
to prepare for
the annual seasonal rush.

23
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,607
This is WISS...

24
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,906
How come the sun didn't use to shine in here?

25
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,287
We bought the house in the fall,
and this is summer.

26
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,668
Somebody feed the dogs.

27
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,961
Right.

28
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,343
Do you see the kids?

29
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,434
They must be
in the back yard.

30
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,520
In Amity you say "yard."

31
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,983
They're in the "yard,"
not too "far" from the "car."

32
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,029
How's that?

33
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,280
Like you're
from New York.

34
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,452
Mum, I got cut.
I got hit by a vampire.

35
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,703
You were playing on those swings,
weren't you?

36
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,039
Those swings
are dangerous.

37
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,707
Stay off there.
I haven't fixed them yet.

38
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,502
I think you're
going to live.

39
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,213
It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
Hello.

40
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,090
Yes.
Can I go swimming?

41
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,467
Yeah, but let me clean
this thing off first.

42
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,720
What do they usually do?
Wash up, or float up, or what?

43
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,182
Oh, no.

44
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,186
Keep them there.
I'll be out in about

45
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,565
15, 20 minutes.
All right?

46
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,149
Dry you off.
Okay.

47
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,901
Go on,
get a Band-Aid.

48
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,571
Got to go.
Missing person.

49
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,865
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

50
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,912
Listen, Chief...

51
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,706
be careful, will you?

52
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,832
In this town?

53
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,500
Hi, Dad.

54
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,377
Wait a minute.
Let me get on.

55
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,129
I want my cup back!

56
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,422
You'll get it.

57
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,925
Wave goodbye. Bye.

58
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,416
Nobody saw her
go into the water?

59
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,961
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

60
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,172
You mean,
she ran out on you?

61
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,381
No, sir.

62
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,552
She must've drowned.

63
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,722
Look, I reported it
to you, didn't I?

64
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,931
You live here?

65
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,099
No. Hartford.

66
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,019
I go to Trinity.
My folks live in Greenwich.

67
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,354
Your folks were
born here, right?

68
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,897
Yeah, I'm an Islander.

69
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,982
They moved off
when my dad retired.

70
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,067
You an Islander?

71
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,234
No. New York City.

72
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,862
You here for the summer?
Come on.

73
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,752
Hold it.

74
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,766
Oh, Jesus.

75
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,586
Well, you're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

76
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,924
Chief, what have
you got on?

77
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,926
If this new filing system
is to work,

78
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,928
you must keep outdated stuff off my desk.

79
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,013
Just the pending,
all right? Yes, Chief.

80
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,850
We got a bunch of calls
about that karate school.

81
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,811
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been

82
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,313
karate-ing
the picket fences.

83
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,026
Chief Brody's office.
The medical inspector.

84
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,875
The Fire Chief wants you to go over the Fourth of July...

85
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,169
Polly, I want a list
of the water activities

86
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,421
that the city fathers
are planning for today.

87
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,881
Right away.
Hendricks!

88
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,175
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

89
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,509
We never had any.
No?

90
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:56,013
There's a dead truck with New Hampshire plates in front of my store.

91
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,684
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

92
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,834
Look what the kids did to my fence.
8 and 9-year-olds...

93
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,628
Glasses?
Yeah, glasses.

94
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,590
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.

95
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,515
This stuff ain't going
to help me in August.

96
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,975
The summer ginks
come down here in June.

97
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,937
You haven't got one thing on here I ordered.

98
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:49,274
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger, no beach balls.

99
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,276
If I can't get service...

100
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,994
Chief, Polly sent me
to tell you

101
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,080
that there's a bunch of Boy Scouts out in Avril Bay

102
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,123
doing the mile swim
for their merit badges.

103
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,668
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

104
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,461
Okay. Come on,
get out of there.

105
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,088
Take this stuff
back to the office

106
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,714
and get to work
on those signs.

107
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,176
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

108
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,803
Let Polly
do the printing.

109
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,971
What's the matter
with my printing?

110
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,390
Let Polly
do the printing.

111
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,891
Chief Brody!

112
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,729
What have you got there?

113
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,314
Listen, we had
a shark attack

114
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,024
at South Beach
this morning, Mayor.

115
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,734
Fatal. I have to
batten down the beach.

116
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,446
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.

117
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,831
Charlie, take me out
to those kids, will you?

118
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,608
Martin, you're going to shut down the beaches on your own authority?

119
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,401
What other authority
do I need?

120
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,903
Technically, you need
a civic ordinance

121
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,487
or a resolution
by a board of...

122
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,989
That's just going
by the book.

123
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,407
We're really
a little anxious

124
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,243
that you're rushing into
something serious here.

125
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,370
This is your first
summer, you know.

126
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,164
What does that mean?

127
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,209
I'm only trying to say that Amity IS a summer town.

128
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,837
We need summer dollars.

129
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,464
If they can't
swim here

130
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,382
they'll be glad to
swim at the beaches

131
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,718
of Cape Cod,
the Hamptons, Long Island.

132
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,137
That doesn't mean we serve them a smorgasbord.

133
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,641
But we've never had that kind of trouble in these waters.

134
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,559
What else could've
done that to that girl?

135
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,727
A boat propeller?

136
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,064
I think possibly,
yes, a boating accident.

137
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,732
That's not what you told me on the phone.

138
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,275
I was wrong.

139
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,277
We'll have to
amend our reports.

140
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,362
And you'll
stand by that?

141
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,072
I'll stand by that.

142
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,868
Martin, a summer girl goes swimming,
swims out a little far.

143
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,496
She tires,
fishing boat comes along...

144
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,705
It's happened before.

145
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,249
I don't think you appreciate the gut reaction

146
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,501
people have
to these things.

147
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,545
Larry, I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.

148
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,173
Martin,
it's all psychological.

149
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:22,552
You yell, "Barracuda!"
and everybody says, "Huh? What?"

150
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,390
You yell, "Shark!"...

151
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,686
we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July.

152
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,898
Okay. You can
take us back now.

153
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,535
Here's mommy, here.

154
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,330
I'm going to get my raft
and go back out in the water.

155
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,416
Let me see
your fingers.

156
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,419
Alex Kintner,
they're beginning to prune.

157
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,421
Just let me go out
a little longer.

158
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,672
Just 10 more minutes.

159
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,881
Thanks.

160
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,593
There are no Islanders.

161
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,845
None of them are
from the island.

162
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,971
It's just a big bother.

163
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,014
They're bringing in...

164
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,348
All I want to know...

165
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,475
I just want to
know one simple thing.

166
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,102
When do I get to
become an Islander?

167
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,312
Ellen, never.

168
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,857
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander. That's it.

169
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,309
Nantucket Ferries...

170
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,895
...to Amity,
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket islands.

171
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,398
Monday to Thursday, 8:40, 1:15,
5:45 and 6:00 p.m.

172
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,151
Starting July 1,
8:30 p.m....

173
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,239
Come back here.

174
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,793
But don't bother him. Come right back.
- Okay. I won't.

175
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,756
Martin, I know you got
a lot of problems downtown

176
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,926
but I've got problems at the house I wish you'd take care of.

177
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,594
One, I've got
some cats parking

178
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,762
in front of the house,
I can't get...

179
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,475
And that garbage truck next to the office,
that's terrible.

180
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,187
What I need is a red zone.
It's a simple thing you can take care of.

181
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,315
You've done it before.
Come here a minute, please.

182
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,112
Are you okay?

183
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,280
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,367
Listen, if the kids going in the water iS worrying you

185
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,495
they can play out here
on the beach.

186
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,539
It's all right.
Let them go.

187
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,341
It's cold.

188
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,303
We know all
about you, Chief.

189
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,514
You don't go in the water
at all, do you?

190
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,058
That's some
bad hat, Harry.

191
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,858
Chief Brody,
you are uptight.

192
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,237
Come on. That's it.

193
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,331
Oh, do you know
the muffin man

194
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,666
The muffin man

195
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,169
Tippet!

196
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,034
Did you see that?

197
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,710
Blood!

198
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,050
Everybody out!

199
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,804
Get them out!

200
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,480
Michael,
get out of the water!

201
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,494
Alex?

202
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,266
We don't even know if there's a shark around here.

203
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,018
I can't argue with you.
I can't talk to you.

204
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,479
I have to talk
to Mrs. Kintner.

205
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,273
Because this is
turning into a contest.

206
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:30,151
It's not just the Gazette.
She's advertising in out-of-town papers.

207
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,364
I suggest we move back to council
chambers where we'll have more room.

208
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,449
I'm responsible for
public safety here.

209
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,536
Then go out tomorrow and see that no one gets hurt.

210
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,372
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.

211
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,208
The ad will run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

212
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,211
Right in here, please.

213
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,506
Move on in, please.

214
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,647
Why do you insist
on playing the heavy?

215
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:11,860
I have a point of view and I think it speaks for many of the people here.

216
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,491
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

217
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,368
Let's have
some order.

218
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,372
Let's have order,
please.

219
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,083
Any special questions?

220
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,671
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark in cash or check?

221
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,466
I don't think
that's funny.

222
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,760
I don't think
that's funny at all.

223
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,261
All right.

224
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,682
That's private business between you fishermen and Mrs.
Kintner.

225
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,228
Martin,
would you please...

226
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,356
Chief Brody.

227
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,527
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

228
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,363
What about
the beaches, Chief?

229
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:00,533
We're going to put on the extra summer deputies as soon as possible.

230
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,953
And then we're going to try and use shark spotters on the beach.

231
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,414
Are you going to
close the beaches?

232
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,294
Yes, we are.

233
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,049
We also plan to
bring in experts

234
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,635
from the Oceanographic
Institute on the mainland.

235
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,596
Only 24 hours.

236
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,764
I didn't agree to that.

237
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,393
Only 24 hours.

238
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,771
Twenty-four hours
is like three weeks!

239
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,965
You all know me.
Know how I earn a living.

240
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,926
I'll catch this bird
for you.

241
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,345
It ain't going to
be easy. Bad fish.

242
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,681
Not like going
down to the pond

243
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,183
and chasing bluegills
or tommy cods.

244
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,146
This shark,
swallow you whole.

245
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:16,693
Shaking, tenderizing.
Down you go.

246
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,112
And we got to
do it quick.

247
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,530
Got to bring back
the tourists

248
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,700
that'll put all your businesses on a paying basis.

249
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,786
But it's not
going to be pleasant.

250
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,039
I value my neck a lot more than $3,000, Chief.

251
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:35,378
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.

252
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,006
You got to
make up your minds.

253
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,550
Gonna stay alive
and ante up,

254
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,220
gonna play it cheap and be on welfare the whole winter.

255
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,057
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

256
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,060
There's too many captains
on this island.

257
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,897
$10,000 for me,
by myself.

258
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:59,402
For that, you get the head,
the tail, the whole damn thing.

259
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,742
Thank you very much,
Mr. Quint.

260
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,913
We'll take it
under advisement.

261
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,460
Mr. Mayor, Chief,

262
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,547
ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,500
Oh, God, you scared me.

264
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,627
Oh.
Oh.

265
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,049
You know, Ellen,
people don't even know how old sharks are.

266
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,302
I mean, if they live 2,000,
3,000 years... They don't know.

267
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,596
Enough.

268
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,473
You're not going to even be able to go to sleep tonight.

269
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,809
Here. Come on.

270
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,311
Thanks.

271
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,065
Oh.

272
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,986
Oh.

273
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,322
Want to get drunk
and fool around?

274
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,657
Oh, yeah.

275
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,289
Mikey really
loves his present.

276
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,125
Where is he?

277
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,334
Sitting in it.

278
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,839
Good God.

279
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,970
All right, Michael,
out of the boat!

280
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,182
Tied up to the jetties,
sitting in the boat.

281
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,726
I'm helping Michael.

282
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,436
Get out of that boat!

283
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,188
Hi, Dad. Just a little
longer. Please?

284
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,773
It's his birthday.

285
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,858
I don't want him
on the ocean!

286
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,735
He's not on the ocean,
he is in a boat.

287
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,194
He won't go
in the water.

288
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,699
I don't think he'll go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.

289
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,411
All right,
now don't say that.

290
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,748
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.

291
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,126
I want him to read
the boating regulations,

292
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,379
the rules, before he
goes out on his own.

293
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:27,842
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

294
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,218
Now!

295
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,062
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.

296
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:44,025
Don't worry.
The Chief lives on the other side of the island.

297
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,402
Am I coming in straight?

298
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,071
Don't worry about it.
Just keep rowing.

299
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,164
We better
catch something,

300
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,416
this is my wife's
holiday roast.

301
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,210
Don't worry about it.

302
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,295
$3,000 buys
an awful lot of roast.

303
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,431
Come and get it.

304
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,978
The tide's
taking it right out.

305
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,274
Can't we go home?

306
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,171
He's taking it.

307
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,923
Go!

308
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,331
Charlie, take my word for it,
don't look back!

309
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,041
Swim, Charlie!

310
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:11,172
Come on! To me, boy!
Come on, Charlie! Swim!

311
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,424
Come on, Charlie,
keep coming. Keep swimming.

312
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,718
Come on, a little more.
Atta boy.

313
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,013
I can't get up.

314
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,723
Give me your hand,
Charlie.

315
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,810
Help me!

316
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,978
Get your feet
out of the water!

317
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,077
Can we go home now?

318
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,840
So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath

319
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,175
and figure out how
to tell Charlie's wife

320
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,219
what happened to her
freezer full of meat.

321
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,972
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.

322
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,724
Mrs.
Kintner must've put her ad in Field & Stream.

323
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,102
Looks more like
The National Enquirer.

324
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,482
All right, hold it.
Hold everything. I said, hold it!

325
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,739
Hello.

326
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:21,284
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?

327
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,454
Say, I hope you're not going out with those nuts,
are you?

328
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,586
The Weetock boats
gotta move out first.

329
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,547
You have to move out or he can't get out at all.

330
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,925
Don't raise sail, you're going to luff it.
You got a paddle?

331
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,760
I got a paddle.
Scull it out of here.

332
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,388
Officer, wait a second.

333
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,893
How many guys are you going to put aboard that boat?

334
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,394
Whatever's safe,
right?

335
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,729
Yeah,
well that ain't safe.

336
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,814
Watch it,
that's dynamite.

337
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,357
What are you doing
with that?

338
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,483
Where are you going
with that?

339
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,319
I'm going on the boat.

340
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,155
Please, help me get those guys out of the boat,
will you?

341
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,531
Sure.
Come on.

342
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,243
Gentlemen, the officer
asked me to tell you

343
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:05,578
that you're
overloading that boat!

344
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,080
Go on, get out of here.

345
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,790
You ain't going.
What do you care?

346
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,753
Can you tell me if there's a good restaurant or hotel on the island?

347
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,087
Yeah, you walk
straight ahead.

348
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,925
They're all
going to die.

349
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,595
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.

350
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,847
You've got to get
somebody to help us.

351
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,808
Yeah, get those road block signs out on the highway.

352
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:31,187
Because we've got more people down here than we can handle.

353
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,440
What're you doing there?
These are your people. Go talk to them.

354
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,442
They aren't my people.
They're from all over.

355
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,402
You see all
the license plates?

356
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,906
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey.
I'm all by myself out there.

357
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,491
What happened to
the extra help...

358
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,992
It's not until
the Fourth of July.

359
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:46,577
Till then,
it's you and me.

360
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,955
You know those guys
in the fan-tail launch?

361
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,374
None of them are getting
out of the harbor alive.

362
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,959
That's what I'm saying.

363
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,127
You know their names.
Talk to those clowns.

364
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,671
Everyone's having
a good time today.

365
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:57,880
Tell me about it.

366
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,173
Polly, I'll get
back to you.

367
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,926
Could you tell me how I could find Chief Brody?

368
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,052
Who are you?

369
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,097
Matt Hooper. I'm from
the Oceanographic Institute.

370
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,725
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
You're the guy we called. I'm Brody.

371
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,852
Oh. I'm glad to meet you.
Me, too.

372
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,729
I know you got
a lot on your hands.

373
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:14,939
What can we do
for you?

374
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,817
The best thing to do
is to see the remains

375
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,443
of the first victim,
the girl on the beach.

376
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,153
Okay, fine.
Just bear with me, will you?

377
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,363
Sure.

378
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,867
Wait till we get them silly bastards down in that rock pile.

379
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,327
There'll be some fun.

380
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,746
They'll wish their fathers hadn't met their mothers

381
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,581
when they start
digging the bottoms out

382
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,834
and slamming into
them rocks, boy.

383
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,004
Get away from there,
you goddamn fool!

384
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,255
What's the matter
with you?

385
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,091
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

386
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,927
What are
these guys doing out here?

387
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,304
What are they
doing back there?

388
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:48,848
They're chumming
right now.

389
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,057
What the hell
is that?

390
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,642
They're tracking
the shark.

391
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,687
$3,000 divided
four ways is what?

392
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,357
Watch your starboard. Jesus!

393
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,198
Let's show Mr. Hooper
our accident.

394
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,455
"Victim identified as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian."

395
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,831
And here's the way
we have it.

396
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,500
"Probable
boating accident."

397
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,050
The height and weight
of the victim

398
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,178
can only be estimated
from the partial remains.

399
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,643
The torso has been
severed in mid-thorax.

400
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,228
There are no major
organs remaining.

401
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,897
May I have a glass
of water?

402
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,190
The right arm
has been severed

403
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,693
above the elbow
with massive tissue loss

404
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,820
in the upper musculature.

405
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,073
Thank you very much.

406
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,828
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

407
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,955
Did you notify
the Coast Guard about this?

408
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,833
No. It was only
local jurisdiction.

409
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:04,632
The left arm, head,
the shoulders, sternum

410
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,133
and portions of
the rib cage are intact.

411
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,844
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

412
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,264
This is what happens.

413
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,519
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding of a large squalus

414
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,523
possibly longimanus
or Isurus glaucus.

415
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:25,277
The enormous amount of tissue loss prevents any detailed analysis

416
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,864
however, the attacking squalus must be considerably larger

417
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,450
than any normal squalus
found in these waters.

418
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,828
Didn't you get out a boat
and check these waters?

419
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,954
No.

420
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,705
Well, this is
not a boat accident.

421
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,584
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

422
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,962
And it wasn't
Jack the Ripper.

423
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,383
It was a shark.

424
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,528
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I want to get on the state wire services.

425
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,655
See if Boston will pick it up and go national.

426
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,031
Call Dave Axelrod
in New York

427
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,867
and tell him
he owes me a favor.

428
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,828
This is the shot I want with everybody and the fish in it.

429
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,164
Guys, could we
please get organized?

430
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,499
I want to get
a picture for the paper.

431
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,709
Now, can we
just have the...

432
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,335
Ben Gardner get this?

433
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,087
No, we caught it.

434
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,175
That's swell.

435
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,593
It's a beauty.

436
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,054
Guys, please,
I need a picture for the paper.

437
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,556
Clear out of the way,
please.

438
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,559
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

439
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,061
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

440
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,856
Come on.
I need a picture for the paper.

441
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,149
Could we get the sign,
please?

442
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,530
Kneel down,
just like in high school.

443
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,574
One row kneeling,
one row standing.

444
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,409
Come on,
just get out of the way.

445
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,786
Young fellow,
could you step out of the picture?

446
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,622
Take your rake
with you.

447
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,791
We're ready.
Thank you.

448
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,002
Can you get that,
please.

449
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,295
How's that?

450
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,720
Larry, you won't
believe it.

451
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,222
What kind of
a shark is that?

452
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,473
I don't know.

453
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,141
I think it's a mako.

454
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,476
It's got a deep throat,
Frank.

455
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,603
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

456
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,812
Tiger shark.

457
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,857
A what?

458
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,442
We can start
breathing again.

459
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,735
Is Ben getting
plenty of pictures?

460
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,028
Oh, you bet he is.

461
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,738
What is this
bite radius crap?

462
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,198
That is a big mouth.

463
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,242
You stuff your frigging head in there, man,

464
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,328
and find out if
it's a man-eater.

465
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,834
All I'm saying is that it may not be the shark.

466
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,086
It's just a slight...

467
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,631
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.

468
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,591
Matt's from
the Oceanographic Institute.

469
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:53,634
Nice to meet you.

470
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,344
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

471
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,723
There are all kinds of
sharks in the waters.

472
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,017
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.

473
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,104
And the chances that these bozos got the exact shark...

474
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,106
There are no other
sharks like this here.

475
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,108
It's 100-to-1.

476
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:13,821
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

477
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,740
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

478
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,368
But the fact is,
the bite radius on this animal

479
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,912
is different than the wounds on the victim.

480
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:26,083
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

481
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,710
We all want to
be sure, okay?

482
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,420
What I want to do
is very simple.

483
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,298
The digestive system of this animal is very slow.

484
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,507
Let's cut it open.

485
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,509
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

486
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,052
is bound to
still be in there.

487
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,096
And then we'll be sure.

488
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,146
It may be the only way
to confirm it.

489
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,565
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable.

490
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,276
This is not
the time or the place

491
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,946
to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.

492
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,534
And I am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open

493
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:04,496
and see that little Kintner boy spill out all over the dock.

494
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,762
Chief Brody?

495
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,846
Yes?

496
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,647
I just found out

497
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,943
that a girl got
killed here last week.

498
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,988
And you knew it.

499
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,658
You knew there was
a shark out there.

500
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,621
You knew
it was dangerous.

501
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,624
But you let people
go swimming anyway.

502
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,297
You knew all those things,

503
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,053
but still my boy
is dead now.

504
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,310
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

505
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,567
My boy is dead.

506
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,325
I wanted you
to know that.

507
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,216
I'm sorry, Martin.
She's wrong.

508
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,428
No, she's not.

509
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,851
All right, fellows

510
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,894
let's cut this ugly
son of a bitch down

511
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,896
before it stinks up
the whole island.

512
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,733
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow and dump it in the drink.

513
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,098
Come here.

514
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,937
Give us a kiss.

515
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,146
Why?

516
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,484
Because I need it.

517
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,448
Get out of here.

518
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,700
Can I help you?

519
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,369
The door was open.
Mind if I come in?

520
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,995
I'm Matt Hooper.

521
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,539
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

522
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,123
Your husband's home?
Yes.

523
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,833
I'd really like
to talk to him.

524
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,502
Yes, so would I.

525
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,713
Come in.
Can I get you some coffee?

526
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,006
No. Nothing, thank you.

527
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,758
Oh, wine. How nice.

528
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,362
How was your day?

529
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,452
Swell.

530
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,500
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.

531
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,043
Oh, that's nice.

532
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,297
Is anyone eating this?

533
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,590
No.

534
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,517
My husband tells me
you're in sharks.

535
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:41,148
Excuse me. Yes.
I've never heard it quite put that way.

536
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,733
But yes, I am.

537
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,484
I love sharks.

538
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,611
You love sharks?

539
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,029
Yeah, I love them.

540
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,364
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

541
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,199
and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

542
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,452
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

543
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,371
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

544
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,081
who proceeded
to eat my boat.

545
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,211
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

546
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,671
He turned an inboard
into an outboard

547
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:08,091
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

548
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,636
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

549
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,679
and actually saw my boat being taken apart.

550
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,349
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks

551
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:19,186
and that's why I know that I'm going to go to the Institute tomorrow

552
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,855
and tell them that you still have a shark problem here.

553
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,899
Why do you have to tell them that?
Sorry.

554
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,609
I'm sorry,
I thought that...

555
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,985
You told me
the shark was caught.

556
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,655
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.

557
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:32,324
They caught a shark,
not the shark.

558
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,410
Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

559
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,288
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

560
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:41,166
Which I wanted to prove today by cutting the shark open...

561
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,336
You may want to let
that breathe... Nothing.

562
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:04,272
You know, you'll be
the only rational man

563
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,066
left on this island
after I leave tomorrow.

564
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,318
Where are you going?

565
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,363
I am going
on the Aurora.

566
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,864
The Aurora?
What is that?

567
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,867
It's a floating asylum
for shark addicts.

568
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,994
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.

569
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,957
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.

570
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:26,670
Martin sits in his car when we go on the ferry to the mainland.

571
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:28,964
I guess it's
a childhood thing.

572
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,716
There's a clinical name
for it, isn't there?

573
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,259
Drowning.

574
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,970
Is it true that most
people get attacked

575
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,305
by sharks in
three feet of water

576
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,015
about 10 feet
from the beach?

577
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,183
Yeah.

578
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,312
And that before people started to swim for recreation...

579
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:47,566
I mean, before sharks
knew what they were missing

580
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:50,944
that a lot of these attacks weren't reported?

581
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,279
That's right.

582
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,159
Now this shark
that swims alone

583
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,452
what's it called?
Rogue.

584
00:42:58,535 --> 00:42:59,953
Rogue, yeah.

585
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,498
This guy,
he keeps swimming around

586
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,375
in a place where
the feeding is good

587
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,335
until the food
supply is gone, right?

588
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,920
That's called
territoriality.

589
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:12,257
It's just a theory that
I happen to agree with.

590
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,428
Then why don't we
have one more drink

591
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,014
and go down
and cut that shark open?

592
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,225
Martin?
Can you do that?

593
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:29,065
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.

594
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:38,200
We start in
the alimentary canal

595
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,245
and open
the digestive tract.

596
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,151
Just like I thought.

597
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:14,236
What?

598
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,573
Came up in the Gulf Stream,
from southern waters.

599
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,163
He didn't eat a car,
did he?

600
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,373
No.

601
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,459
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

602
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:32,504
Somebody probably
threw that in the river.

603
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,178
That's it.

604
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,100
I've got to close the beach,
call the Mayor.

605
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,311
You got a bigger problem than that, Martin.

606
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:50,939
You still got a hell
of a fish out there

607
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,816
with a mouth
about this big.

608
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,489
How do we confirm that
by morning?

609
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:04,327
If he is a rogue,
and there's any truth to territoriality at all

610
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,204
we got a good chance
of spotting him

611
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,998
between Cape Scott
and South Beach.

612
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,207
Where are you going?

613
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,709
To find him.
He's a night feeder.

614
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:11,835
On the water?

615
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,420
We're not gonna
find him on the land.

616
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,880
I'm not drunk enough
to go on a boat.

617
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,006
Yes, you are.

618
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,382
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

619
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,925
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.

620
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,730
I'm telling you,
the crime rate in New York will kill you.

621
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:35,734
There's so many problems,
you never feel like you're accomplishing anything.

622
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,820
Violence,
rip-offs, muggings.

623
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,071
The kids can't
leave the house.

624
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,282
You've got to
walk them to school.

625
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,368
But in Amity,
one man can make a difference.

626
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:48,079
In 25 years,
there's never been

627
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,831
a shooting or a murder
in this town.

628
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,209
No kidding?
Want a pretzel?

629
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,170
Where are we?

630
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,256
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

631
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,594
Can you get The Late Show on this thing?

632
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,262
No, it's a closed
circuit TV system.

633
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:06,890
I have underwater
cameras fore-and-aft.

634
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,225
Who pays
for all this stuff?

635
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,727
The government?
The Institute?

636
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,854
This stuff costs
a lot of money.

637
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,775
I paid for this
mostly myself, actually.

638
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,652
You're kidding.
No.

639
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,987
You rich?
Yeah.

640
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,156
How much?

641
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,741
Personally,
or the whole family?

642
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:30,330
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

643
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:34,209
Well, it doesn't
make sense for a guy

644
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,835
who hates the water to
live on an island either.

645
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:39,714
It's only an island if you look at it from the water.

646
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,758
That makes
a lot of sense.

647
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,474
What is
that thing doing?

648
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,894
Well, it's a fish finder.

649
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,063
It's probably just a school of mackerel or something,

650
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,148
all clumped together.

651
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,194
Wait a minute.

652
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,409
There's something else
out there.

653
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,827
What is it?

654
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,871
About 100 yards,
south-southwest.

655
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:48,283
That's Ben Gardner's boat.

656
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,617
You know him?

657
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:53,288
It's all banged up.
Sure I know him. He's a fisherman.

658
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,416
What happened?

659
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,758
Martin, I gotta go down
and check their hull.

660
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,926
Wait. Why don't
we just tow it all in?

661
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,637
We will. I just got
to check something out.

662
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,556
Hit the lights for me.

663
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,207
Let's tow it in.

664
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,460
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's going to happen.

665
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,383
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

666
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,011
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

667
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,638
Don't touch any
of the equipment.

668
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:56,184
I'll be back
in two minutes.

669
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,732
This is a great white,
Larry. A big one.

670
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,693
Any shark expert will tell you it's a killer,
a man-eater.

671
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,529
The situation is that apparently a great white shark

672
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:33,907
has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island.

673
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:37,202
He'll continue to feed here as long as there's food in the water.

674
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,870
There's no limit
to what he'll do.

675
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,330
We've had
three incidents.

676
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,832
Two people killed within a week.
It'll happen again.

677
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,001
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.

678
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,045
Five people were killed...
In one week.

679
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:48,379
Tell him
about the swimmers.

680
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:51,716
A shark is attracted to the exact kind of splashing and activity

681
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:54,636
that occurs whenever human beings swim.
You can't avoid it.

682
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,389
Opening the beaches on the Fourth of July is like ringing the dinner bell.

683
00:50:58,473 --> 00:50:59,849
Look, Mr. Vaughn

684
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,644
I pulled a tooth
the size of a shot glass

685
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,270
out of the wrecked hull
of a boat out there.

686
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:05,855
It was the tooth
of a great white.

687
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:07,607
It was Gardner's boat,
all chewed up.

688
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,984
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!

689
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,820
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

690
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,822
I didn't see it.
He dropped it on the way in.

691
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,950
I had an accident.

692
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:20,286
And what did you say the name of this shark is?

693
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:24,540
It's a Carcharodon carcharias.
It's a great white.

694
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,709
You don't
have the tooth?

695
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:30,797
Look, we depend on the summer people for our very lives...

696
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,967
You won't have a summer unless you deal with this problem!

697
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,220
We have to close the beach and hire someone to kill the shark!

698
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,097
We have to tell
the Coast Guard.

699
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,141
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

700
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:44,519
You'll have to ring
this entire harbor!

701
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,312
I don't think
either one of you

702
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,106
are familiar
with our problems!

703
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,400
I think that I am familiar with the fact

704
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,652
that you'll ignore
this particular problem

705
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,071
until it swims up and
bites you in the ass!

706
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,157
Wait a second!
There are two ways to deal with this problem!

707
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:01,369
You either kill this animal
or cut off its food supply.

708
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,329
We have to
close the beaches.

709
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:04,539
Brody?

710
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,166
Sick vandalism.

711
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,337
That is a deliberate mutilation of a public service message.

712
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,549
I want those little paint-happy bastards caught

713
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,342
and hung up by
their Buster Browns.

714
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:19,470
That's it.
I won't waste my time arguing with a man

715
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:20,763
who's lining up
to be a hot lunch.

716
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,140
I'm gonna see
you later, Brody.

717
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,309
Don't do this.
He's not...

718
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,778
What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine,
an eating machine.

719
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,072
It's really
a miracle of evolution.

720
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:41,993
All this machine does
is swim and eat

721
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:44,746
and make little sharks.
And that's all.

722
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,749
Why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign?

723
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,001
Those proportions
are correct.

724
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,336
You'd love to prove that,
wouldn't you?

725
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:54,380
Get your name into
the National Geographic.

726
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,643
Larry, if we make
an effort today,

727
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,562
we might be able
to save August.

728
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,647
August?
For Christ's sake,

729
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,191
tomorrow's
the Fourth of July!

730
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,193
We will be open
for business.

731
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,195
It'll be one of the best
summers we've ever had.

732
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,238
If you are concerned
about the beaches,

733
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,532
do whatever you have to,
to make them safe.

734
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,827
But those beaches will be open for this weekend.

735
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,811
I want to know how many men you're going to send.

736
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,105
There is no need for me
to come to Brisbane

737
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,732
when I have a great
white shark right here!

738
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,068
We need men to
patrol the swimming area.

739
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,238
We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.

740
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:14,961
Monday!

741
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:18,423
Is Chief Federal
Officer Feldman there?

742
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,591
He's the little guy
with a crew cut.

743
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,236
Operator, isn't there
a phone on the island?

744
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,529
Could you connect me,
please?

745
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:51,205
Come on, get him!

746
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,834
Careful on the beach.

747
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:59,213
Brody to Gotcha,
do you read me?

748
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,217
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

749
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,678
All right.
I'll get to them later.

750
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,350
Brody to Scutbucket,
please come in.

751
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,067
Brody to Daisy,
do you read me?

752
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,736
Fascinating Rhythm,
do you read me?

753
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,488
Come in, Hooper.
What do you see?

754
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:26,365
Nothing here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

755
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:30,578
Amity Island has long been known for its clean air,
clear water

756
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,872
and beautiful
white-sand beaches.

757
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:34,499
But in recent days

758
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,250
a cloud has appeared
on the horizon

759
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,252
of this beautiful
resort community.

760
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,755
A cloud in the shape
of a killer shark.

761
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,599
That is very shocking
in the outfield.

762
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:55,520
Two balls, one strike,
runners at first and third...

763
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,440
Fly ball,
deep left field.

764
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:03,110
Jerry Christian goes back,
running back near the wall

765
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:05,112
and he takes it
for the out.

766
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:12,161
Oh, hi, Larry.

767
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:13,746
Why aren't you
in the water?

768
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,833
I just put some
suntan lotion on,

769
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,794
and I'm trying
to absorb some...

770
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,629
Nobody's going in.

771
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,799
Please,
get in the water.

772
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,106
Mike, come here.

773
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,945
Listen, Mike.
Do me a favor, will you?

774
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:29,238
You and the other guys
take the boat

775
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:31,866
and put it
in the pond instead?

776
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,201
The pond is
for old ladies.

777
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,411
I know it's for
the old ladies,

778
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,788
but just do it
for the old man.

779
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:38,873
Please?

780
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:39,957
All right.

781
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,043
Thanks.

782
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,223
I've got Sean.

783
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,813
Michael! Wait!

784
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,735
Michael, I don't
like you no more.

785
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,538
I can stand Harry,
you know...

786
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:36,347
Daisy, this is Hendricks.
Anything?

787
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,765
Thought I saw
a shadow. Over.

788
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,519
Hendricks, this is Daisy here.
I don't see anything.

789
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,272
False alarm.
Must be this glare.

790
00:58:56,534 --> 00:59:00,204
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have in fact

791
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,790
caught and killed
a large predator

792
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,792
that supposedly
injured some bathers.

793
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,627
As you see,
it's a beautiful day.

794
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:10,047
The beaches are open,
and people are having a wonderful time.

795
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:12,717
"Amity," as you know,
means "friendship."

796
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,107
My God!

797
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,327
Jesus Christ!
Fin! Shark! 350!

798
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:43,998
Get in there
as fast as you can!

799
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,291
Red one.

800
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,335
Martin, get them the hell out of the water.

801
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,092
No whistles!

802
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,136
Everybody, please,
get out of the water.

803
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,679
Everybody out of the water.

804
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:03,184
Don't push!
Everybody out of the water, please.

805
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,182
Come on!

806
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,496
I want them out
of there, guys.

807
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,499
Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?

808
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,214
He made me do it.
He talked me into it.

809
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:19,593
Please, move back.
Give these people some air.

810
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,929
Please, move back.

811
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,600
Martin, it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.

812
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:30,396
Is everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?

813
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:36,277
Folks, we had some practical joker down there with a fake fin...

814
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,071
Shark! A shark!

815
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,033
It's going into the pond!
Shark in estuary!

816
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,285
Now what?

817
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,454
Michael's in the pond.

818
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:52,418
It's going in the pond!
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!

819
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:05,848
Hurry up,
get that done.

820
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,141
I can't do
a damn thing.

821
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,060
Get that rope undone.
You gotta untangle that up there.

822
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,437
I'm doing it!

823
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:16,650
Hey, fellows,
haul in your sheet. Make it fast.

824
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,240
You guys okay
over there?

825
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:24,825
In the pond!

826
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,994
Somebody get
a gun and shoot it!

827
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,537
Doesn't anybody
have a gun?

828
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,478
Is he dead?

829
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,563
No, he's not.
He's in shock.

830
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,847
Doctor said he's okay.
Mild shock.

831
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,015
He can go home
in the morning.

832
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,433
Thank you.

833
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,102
How's my big kid?

834
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,186
I'm all right.

835
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,023
You going to miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

836
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:20,357
Want me to bring
anything from home?

837
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:21,692
My cars.

838
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:22,776
What about ice cream?

839
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,861
Coffee.

840
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,958
Want to take him home?

841
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:41,795
Back to New York?

842
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,089
No. Home, here.

843
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:04,860
I'm sorry,
I'm truly sorry.

844
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,780
You got a pen, Larry?

845
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,199
Yeah, a pen, you know.

846
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,829
‘Cause you're going
to do what you do best.

847
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,957
You're going to sign this voucher so I can hire a contractor.

848
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,918
I don't know if
I can do that without...

849
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,962
I'm going to hire Quint
to kill the shark.

850
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,756
August?
What?

851
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:28,467
What are you
talking about?

852
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,969
Summer's over.
You're the mayor of Shark City.

853
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,888
People think you
want the beaches open.

854
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:36,600
I was acting in
the town's best interest.

855
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,894
You were acting in
the town's best interest.

856
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,896
That's why you'll
do the right thing.

857
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,231
That's why you're
going to sign this,

858
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:45,359
and we'll pay that guy
what he wants.

859
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,907
My kids were on
that beach, too.

860
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,336
Sign it, Larry.

861
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:15,389
$170,000.

862
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:17,766
$200 a day,
whether I catch him or not.

863
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:18,892
You've got it.

864
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:22,396
Get the Mayor off my back so I don't have more of this zoning crap.

865
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,897
You've got that.

866
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:27,734
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

867
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:31,071
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.

868
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,407
Champagne,
pate de foie gras,

869
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,076
Iranian caviar,
and don't forget the color TV.

870
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,709
Chief, you try this.
Made it myself. Pretty good stuff.

871
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,252
Thanks.

872
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,714
Here's to swimming
with bow-legged women.

873
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:57,598
Excuse me, Chief.

874
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,948
Can't get a good man
these days, under 60.

875
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,451
All gone
at least 35 years.

876
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:18,952
Don't drink that.

877
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,287
Mr. Quint...

878
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,335
You're gonna
need an extra hand.

879
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,128
This is Matt Hooper.
I know him.

880
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:29,213
I've crewed
three Trans Pacs.

881
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:30,297
Transplants?

882
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,798
He's from
the Oceanographic Institute.

883
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,759
And an America's Cup trial.

884
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,385
Mr. Hooper,
I'm not talking

885
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:38,180
about pleasure boating
or day-sailing.

886
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:42,726
I'm talking about working for a living.
I'm talking about sharking.

887
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:46,104
I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark.

888
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:48,273
I'm talking about
finding a great white.

889
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:50,651
Porkers?
Talking about porkers?

890
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,824
Just tie me
a sheepshank.

891
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:03,664
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship in a long time.

892
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:07,501
You didn't say how
short you wanted it.

893
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,088
How's that?

894
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,009
Give me your hands.

895
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,137
Dogfish?

896
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:22,599
You got a $5,000 net and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.

897
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:25,727
Along comes Mr.
Whitey, and when he's finished with that net

898
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,396
it looks like
a kiddies' scissors class

899
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,773
has cut it up
for a paper doll.

900
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:33,443
You got city hands,
Mr. Hooper.

901
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:35,445
You been counting money all your life.

902
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:39,032
I don't need this.
I don't need this working-class-hero crap.

903
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:42,911
You're not going to do this aboard the ship are you,
Mr. Quint?

904
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,540
Maybe I should
go alone.

905
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:51,545
It's my party.
It's my charter.

906
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:55,048
Yeah, it's your charter,
it's your party. It's my vessel.

907
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:59,052
You're on board my vessel,
I'm mate, master, pilot

908
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,388
and I'm captain.

909
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:06,893
I'll take him
for ballast, Chief.

910
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:10,814
You got him.

911
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,609
"Straight-jet,
killing lance.

912
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:19,656
"Tail rope, eye splice, M-1,
handy billy, pliers, irons..."

913
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:23,618
Sample bottles,
dye marker, flares, safety float

914
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,455
temperature gauge,
spear guns, SMG...

915
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,750
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?

916
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:41,762
Take that stuff down below and you lash it secure,
all right?

917
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,518
Jesus H. Christ!

918
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,271
When I was a boy,
every squirt wanted

919
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:54,024
to be a harpooner
or a swordfisherman.

920
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:58,195
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?

921
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,696
An anti-shark cage.

922
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,323
Anti-shark cage?

923
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,284
You go inside the cage?

924
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:11,124
Cage goes in the water?
You go in the water? Shark's in the water.

925
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,627
Our shark.

926
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,175
Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies

927
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,846
Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain

928
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:30,811
For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston

929
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:36,400
And so nevermore
shall we see you again

930
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:44,366
Did you take
your Dramamine?

931
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:45,492
Yes.

932
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:49,746
I put an extra pair of glasses in your black socks

933
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:51,540
and there's
the stuff for your nose,

934
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:54,251
the zinc oxide and
Blistex is in the kit.

935
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:56,002
Son of a bitch!

936
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:59,381
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothing.

937
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:01,341
Young girls just
ain't quite smart

938
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:02,884
like their
grandmothers were.

939
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,845
That's got to be Quint.

940
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,471
Colorful, isn't he?

941
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:07,848
He scares me.

942
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:12,394
Don't use
the fireplace in the den...

943
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,688
What am I going
to tell the kids?

944
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,860
Tell them
I'm going fishing.

945
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:28,201
Break it up, will you, Chief?
Daylight's wasting!

946
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:32,706
Front, bow. Back, stern.

947
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:35,542
Better get it right, squirt,
or I throw your ass

948
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,544
out the little round
window on the side!

949
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,755
Come on, Chief.
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

950
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:43,550
See you got
your rubbers.

951
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:50,223
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee Died at the age of 103

952
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,310
"For 15 years
she kept her virginity

953
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,562
"Not a bad record
for this vicinity"

954
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,483
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt!

955
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,820
If you see a shark,
Hooper, swallow!

956
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:11,745
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
Stand by fire drill.

957
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:14,414
Damage control report.

958
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,584
Nor'easter coming,
bad news for Madison Avenue.

959
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,045
I'm tired of that.

960
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:21,838
How's the missus, Chief?

961
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:26,468
If they don't like you going out,
they'll love you coming in.

962
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:53,578
Keep that chum
line going, Chief.

963
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:56,456
We got five
good miles on it.

964
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:59,042
Who's driving
this boat?

965
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,627
Nobody. The tide.

966
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:04,548
One time, I caught
a 16-footer off Montauk.

967
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,049
Had to stick
two barrels in him.

968
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,969
Two to wear him down
and bring him up.

969
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,805
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

970
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:15,725
Radar, sonar,
electric toothbrushes.

971
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,146
Jesus H. Christ.

972
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,900
Chief, best drop
another chum marker.

973
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,466
Damn it, Martin!

974
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,885
This is compressed air.

975
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,512
What the hell kind
of a knot was that?

976
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:54,264
You pulled
the wrong one!

977
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,599
You screw around
with these tanks,

978
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,767
and they're going
to blow up.

979
01:13:57,851 --> 01:13:59,894
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear

980
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,480
you've brought
out here, Mr. Hooper.

981
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:05,442
I don't know what that bastard shark's going to do with it.

982
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:06,985
Might eat it,
I suppose.

983
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:09,613
Seen one eat
a rocking chair one time.

984
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:17,078
Next time,
you just ask me which line to pull, right?

985
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,337
Little brown eel
comes out of the cave

986
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:28,131
swims into the hole

987
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,802
comes out of the hole,
goes back into the cave again.

988
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:35,639
It's not too good,
is it?

989
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:39,225
Nothing's easy, is it?
One more time.

990
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:41,186
Little brown eel...

991
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,516
I got it!

992
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,228
What?
Get behind me.

993
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:10,400
Hooper, reverse her!

994
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,236
Taking a hell
of a lot of line!

995
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,781
Chief, get the scoop out of the bucket!
Wet the reel!

996
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:22,662
Hooper, reverse her!

997
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,753
Duck your head down.
We're swinging. Get behind me again.

998
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:33,006
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.

999
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:37,051
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watching it!

1000
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,515
Hooper, neutral.

1001
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:51,691
Where'd he go now?

1002
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,277
He ain't fooling me.

1003
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,405
What's he yanking on now?

1004
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,866
Go on, try it.

1005
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:15,548
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart or very dumb.

1006
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:23,723
Jesus...

1007
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,895
He's gone under.

1008
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:32,899
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.

1009
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,235
Yeah, it's too easy.

1010
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,613
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

1011
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:42,367
Keep her steady, now.
I got something very big!

1012
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:43,993
I don't think so.

1013
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,121
Chief, put your gloves on.

1014
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:50,291
You put your gloves on,
both of you!

1015
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:55,004
Getting ready
to run out again.

1016
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,382
Quint, let it go.

1017
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:00,176
Maybe you're a big yahoo
in the lab,

1018
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,553
but out here
you're just supercargo!

1019
01:18:01,636 --> 01:18:04,389
If you don't want to backstroke home,
you get down here!

1020
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:07,392
You don't want to listen to me,
don't listen to me.

1021
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:08,685
It's not a shark.

1022
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,812
The wire's showing.

1023
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,355
Unbuckle me.

1024
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,858
Get the other side.

1025
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,484
It's a tuna
or swordfish

1026
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:18,903
wasting our time.

1027
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,114
Take this rod.

1028
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,866
Hooper, give the Chief
a hand, will you?

1029
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:23,992
Right!

1030
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:25,118
Oh, shit!

1031
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:38,006
It may be a marlin
or a stingray

1032
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,842
but it's definitely
a game fish.

1033
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:53,980
Gaming fish?

1034
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,067
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

1035
01:18:58,151 --> 01:18:59,861
Don't you tell me
my business again.

1036
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:01,154
You get back
on the bridge.

1037
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:03,781
Quint, that doesn't
prove a damn thing.

1038
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,992
It proves one thing,
Mr. Hooper.

1039
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:09,245
You wealthy college boys don't have the education enough

1040
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,080
to admit
if you're wrong.

1041
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:23,217
What's the point?
Hooks and lines?

1042
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,139
You lose one,
you rig one.

1043
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:35,313
Twelve minutes, south-southeast, now!
Full throttle!

1044
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:36,898
Aye-aye, sir!

1045
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:42,320
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick them to the surface.

1046
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:44,447
And then
I jab at them.

1047
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:48,201
I'm not going to haul them up like a lot of catfish.

1048
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:50,119
Hooper, full throttle!

1049
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:52,872
I don't have to take
this abuse much longer.

1050
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,000
Your head's bleeding.
First aid there.

1051
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,407
Start that chum line
again, will you?

1052
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,703
Let Hooper take a turn.

1053
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:33,705
Hooper drives
the boat, Chief.

1054
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,514
Stop playing
with yourself, Hooper.

1055
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,266
Slow ahead,
if you please.

1056
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,185
You heard him.
Slow ahead.

1057
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,195
Slow ahead.

1058
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:10,533
I can go slow ahead.
Come on down and chum some of this shit.

1059
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:30,595
You're going to
need a bigger boat.

1060
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,320
Shut off that engine.

1061
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,474
That's a 20-footer.

1062
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:17,767
Twenty-five.

1063
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,436
Three tons of him.

1064
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:28,111
We're going to need
a bigger boat, right?

1065
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:29,612
Gotta get to work.

1066
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,448
How do we handle this?

1067
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:34,700
Come up front, Martin.
I need you.

1068
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,663
He's circling the boat.

1069
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:55,805
This is Amity Point
Light Station to Orca.

1070
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,056
Come in, Orca.

1071
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,058
Orca. Come in.

1072
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:01,060
I have
Mrs. Martin Brody here.

1073
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,353
Put her on.

1074
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:04,939
Come on,
Martin! Move!

1075
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,399
I'm not
going out there!

1076
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:07,942
Beyond the edge
of the barrels.

1077
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:11,070
Go to the end of the barrels,
further out.

1078
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:12,738
Further out!
Why?

1079
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,574
Go further out!
What for?

1080
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:16,409
Will you go to
the end of the pulpit?

1081
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,493
What?

1082
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:18,661
Will you go to
the end of the pulpit?

1083
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,664
I need something in the foreground to give it some scale!

1084
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:22,999
Foreground my ass!

1085
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:25,001
Your husband's okay.
He's fishing.

1086
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:26,252
He just caught
some stripers.

1087
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:30,089
We'll bring them for dinner.
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

1088
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:31,591
I'm not staying here!

1089
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:32,675
I'm begging you!

1090
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:36,053
God damn it!
Come here, darling.

1091
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,686
Chief, I want you up on the bridge,

1092
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,021
just take her forward,
steady.

1093
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:46,564
I've never steered
a boat in my life.

1094
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:49,400
Just watch my hand,
take her steady.

1095
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:53,362
Mr.
Hooper, attach the end of this line to the first keg.

1096
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:56,449
I've got to get a good shot at that porker's head.

1097
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:14,258
He's coming.

1098
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,094
Hooper? Get clear
of the bow.

1099
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,226
Hurry up, will you?

1100
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:24,477
Your turn, Quint.

1101
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,687
Hooper,
where are you?

1102
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,652
Hurry it up now,
tie it on.

1103
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:36,405
He's coming straight for us.
Don't screw it up now.

1104
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:37,990
Don't wait for me.

1105
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,496
Come on, Hooper,
hurry it up! Tie it on!

1106
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:45,665
Now.

1107
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,711
Kill it!

1108
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:52,964
Now!

1109
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,967
Shoot!

1110
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,388
Time.

1111
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:03,432
What were you doing?
You knew I had

1112
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:05,935
to get a clean shot
right in the head.

1113
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,647
All right,
let's see how long that barrel takes to bring him up.

1114
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:14,527
Bring another barrel!
I'm coming around again!

1115
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,374
What do we do now?
We're quitting, right?

1116
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:14,462
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.

1117
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:17,214
We could radio in and
get a bigger boat...

1118
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:44,367
Don't you worry
about it, Chief.

1119
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:48,621
It won't be permanent.
You want to see something permanent?

1120
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:58,798
You want to feel
something permanent?

1121
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:03,969
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

1122
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:07,223
Knocko Nolans,
St. Patty's Day, Boston.

1123
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,229
I got that beat.

1124
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:24,657
It's a moray eel.
It bit right through my wet suit.

1125
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:27,743
Well, Hoop,
now, listen

1126
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:31,080
I don't know about that,
but I entered an arm-wrestling contest

1127
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,916
in a bar in San Francisco.
See this?

1128
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,543
I can't extend that.
You know why?

1129
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,878
‘Cause in the semi-final

1130
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:40,881
celebrating my
third wife's demise,

1131
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:42,925
big Chinese fellow,
he pulled me right over.

1132
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:57,356
Look at that.

1133
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,568
That's a bull shark.

1134
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,529
He scraped me when
I was taking samples.

1135
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,365
I got something for you.

1136
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:10,536
There's a thresher.
You see that? A thresher's tail.

1137
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:12,746
Thresher?
It's a shark.

1138
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,793
You want a drink?
Drink to your leg?

1139
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:18,878
I'll drink to your leg.

1140
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,046
So we drink
to our legs.

1141
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:29,555
I got the creme de la creme.
Right here. Hold on.

1142
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:32,308
Here, you see that?

1143
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:34,435
You're wearing
a sweater.

1144
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,563
Right there.
Mary Ellen Moffit.

1145
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:40,483
She broke my heart.

1146
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:52,161
What's that one?

1147
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:53,662
What?

1148
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:55,206
That one, there.
On your arm.

1149
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:57,875
Oh.

1150
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,502
A tattoo.
I got that removed.

1151
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:01,295
Don't tell me.

1152
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:03,464
"Mother."

1153
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,471
What is it?

1154
01:29:15,476 --> 01:29:18,646
Mr. Hooper, that's
the U.S.S. Indianapolis.

1155
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:28,155
You were
on the Indianapolis?

1156
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:29,615
What happened?

1157
01:29:31,617 --> 01:29:35,663
Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief.

1158
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:40,876
I was coming back from the island of Tinian to Leyte

1159
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,088
just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

1160
01:29:47,258 --> 01:29:50,010
1,100 men went
into the water.

1161
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:51,929
Vessel went down
in 12 minutes.

1162
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:57,226
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

1163
01:29:57,476 --> 01:29:59,395
Tiger, 13-footer.

1164
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:02,356
You know how you know that when you're in the water, Chief?

1165
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:05,693
You tell by looking from the dorsal to the tail.

1166
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:09,154
Well, we didn't know.

1167
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,658
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret

1168
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:15,828
no distress signal
had been sent.

1169
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:25,546
They didn't even list us
overdue for a week.

1170
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:30,509
Very first light,
sharks come cruising

1171
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,929
so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

1172
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:37,641
You know, kind of
like old squares

1173
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,310
in a battle like
you see on a calendar

1174
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:42,187
like the Battle of Waterloo.
The idea was...

1175
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:43,897
the shark comes
to the nearest man

1176
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:46,775
and he starts pounding,
hollering and screaming.

1177
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:49,486
Sometimes the shark
would go away...

1178
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:52,448
but sometimes
he wouldn't go away.

1179
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:56,785
Sometimes that shark,
he looks right into you, right into your eyes.

1180
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,873
You know, a thing
about a shark, he's got...

1181
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:05,336
lifeless eyes. Black eyes,
like a doll's eyes.

1182
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:10,466
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be living

1183
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:15,721
until he bites you.
Those black eyes roll over white and then...

1184
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:20,726
Then you hear that terrible high-pitched screaming.

1185
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:23,062
The ocean turns red.

1186
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:27,316
In spite of the pounding and the hollering,
they all come in.

1187
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:30,736
They rip you
to pieces.

1188
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:38,577
You know,
by the end of that first dawn...

1189
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,372
we lost 100 men.

1190
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:45,417
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.

1191
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,587
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

1192
01:31:49,213 --> 01:31:52,174
On Thursday morning,
I bumped into a friend of mine...

1193
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:54,677
Herbie Robinson,
from Cleveland.

1194
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,514
Baseball player,
bosun's mate.

1195
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:04,645
I thought he was asleep.
Reached over to wake him up.

1196
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:10,109
He bobbed up and down in the water just like a kind of top.

1197
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,069
Upended.

1198
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:18,784
He'd been bitten in half,
below the waist.

1199
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:26,709
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.

1200
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:29,920
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

1201
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,213
Younger than Mr. Hooper.

1202
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,133
He saw us and he came in low,
and three hours later...

1203
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:37,720
a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

1204
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:40,639
That was the time
I was most frightened.

1205
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:43,142
Waiting for my turn.

1206
01:32:44,518 --> 01:32:47,271
I'll never put on
a life jacket again.

1207
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:51,442
So, 1,100 men went
into the water

1208
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:54,069
316 men come out.

1209
01:32:54,153 --> 01:32:58,115
The sharks took the rest,
June 29, 1945.

1210
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:04,830
Anyway,
we delivered the bomb.

1211
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,178
What's that?

1212
01:33:19,261 --> 01:33:20,512
It's a whale.

1213
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:27,478
Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies

1214
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:33,901
Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain

1215
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:42,242
Show me the way
to go home

1216
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:47,831
I'm tired
and I want to go to bed

1217
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:54,129
I had a little drink
about an hour ago

1218
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:58,342
And it's gone right
to my head

1219
01:33:59,593 --> 01:34:03,597
Wherever I may roam

1220
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:08,393
By land, or sea or foam

1221
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:13,941
You will always hear me
singing this song

1222
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:17,778
Show me the way
to go home

1223
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:23,033
Show me the way
to go home

1224
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:26,245
I'm tired
and I want to go to bed

1225
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:28,914
I had a little drink
about an hour ago

1226
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:31,333
And it's gone right
to my head

1227
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,836
Wherever I may roam

1228
01:34:34,253 --> 01:34:36,588
On land or sea or foam

1229
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:40,008
You can always
hear me singing...

1230
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:44,596
Start the engines.

1231
01:34:54,773 --> 01:34:57,150
Fire her up!
Right in the middle!

1232
01:34:57,276 --> 01:34:59,611
He's busting the shaft.

1233
01:35:04,658 --> 01:35:06,493
Put out the fire,
will you?

1234
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:17,796
Pump her out.
Done.

1235
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:27,723
Everybody on deck.

1236
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:28,932
He ate the light.

1237
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:30,601
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

1238
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:36,106
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

1239
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:37,566
Quint, come on.

1240
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:39,359
What's wrong with this?

1241
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:45,574
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.

1242
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,635
You okay?

1243
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,122
Chief,
more left rudder!

1244
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:36,708
Pull your left hand down.

1245
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:39,836
I can't. It'll only go
about three inches.

1246
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:41,797
All of our
injectors got scored

1247
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,799
from the salt water
in the fuel.

1248
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:47,260
Yeah, the housing's bent,
you can hear it.

1249
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:52,599
Try the left rudder again.
More left. Good. Once again now.

1250
01:36:55,811 --> 01:36:57,312
Quint, there it is.

1251
01:36:58,271 --> 01:36:59,982
What do you say, Chief?

1252
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:02,776
The barrel is up,
it's right in the stern.

1253
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:10,200
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

1254
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:24,006
Quint, if we can
get close enough...

1255
01:37:25,424 --> 01:37:27,175
I've got things on board
that'll kill it.

1256
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:30,137
Just want to goose him up.
Come on.

1257
01:37:41,982 --> 01:37:45,694
When he runs,
you drop that rope or you'll lose your hands.

1258
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:49,197
I've seen fingers
torn out at the knuckles.

1259
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:51,283
Whole sea's bones,
full of them.

1260
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:53,285
Give it to me a minute.

1261
01:38:08,759 --> 01:38:11,261
Haul in that line
or it'll foul us.

1262
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,430
Start the engine.

1263
01:38:15,766 --> 01:38:17,350
Where are you going?

1264
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:18,977
I'm going to
make a phone call.

1265
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,903
Hello, mayday, Orca.
Coast Guard?

1266
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,740
Coast Guard, this is the Orca.
Do you read me?

1267
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:34,326
Coast Guard,
this is the Orca. Do you...

1268
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:41,958
Excuse me, Chief.

1269
01:38:42,334 --> 01:38:45,754
That's great!
That's just great!

1270
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,506
Now, where the hell
are we, eh?

1271
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:52,677
You're certifiable, Quint,
you know that? You're certifiable!

1272
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:54,805
You're certifiable,
but I'll tell you this!

1273
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:56,181
Boys,

1274
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:00,519
I think he's come back
for his noon feeding.

1275
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:03,814
Hook me up
another barrel.

1276
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,263
Bring her around
after him.

1277
01:39:53,113 --> 01:39:55,574
Full throttle!
Get me right up alongside of him!

1278
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:58,952
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not going to take it!

1279
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:18,263
Five degrees port.

1280
01:40:25,145 --> 01:40:27,105
All right,
hold your course.

1281
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:35,363
Five degrees port now.

1282
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:40,285
Hold your course.

1283
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:43,205
Fast fish.

1284
01:40:43,288 --> 01:40:44,456
Watch my hand.

1285
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:49,211
Be sure you watch
my hand! Follow me.

1286
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:53,048
Lad, you watch him now!
Starboard!

1287
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:56,134
Run him down, Hooper.

1288
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:04,643
Hard aport.

1289
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,148
Watch him. Starboard.

1290
01:41:34,965 --> 01:41:38,301
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.

1291
01:41:43,932 --> 01:41:45,350
It's incredible.

1292
01:41:51,398 --> 01:41:53,316
They're up again!
Now what?

1293
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,953
Why don't we lead
the shark into shore

1294
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,830
instead of him
leading us out to sea?

1295
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:13,003
Grab a couple of poles.

1296
01:42:15,297 --> 01:42:17,424
Hang on now,
we're going around.

1297
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:20,719
Into starboard. Easy.

1298
01:42:21,678 --> 01:42:23,722
I'm going to
back her off now.

1299
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:25,598
Watch those barrels, boys.
Watch them.

1300
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:32,230
All right, gentlemen,
snag them.

1301
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,863
Now then, tie them
to the stern cleats.

1302
01:42:43,116 --> 01:42:45,744
Brody, bring your end
around the cleat.

1303
01:42:46,786 --> 01:42:50,332
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.

1304
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:54,127
Stay clear of the line!

1305
01:43:01,885 --> 01:43:03,595
Watch it. Stand clear.

1306
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:16,232
Stand away from
those stern cleats!

1307
01:43:29,371 --> 01:43:31,456
Back home we got
a taxidermy man.

1308
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:32,999
He's going to
have a heart attack

1309
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:35,752
when he sees
what I brought him.

1310
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,469
Throttle back.
You're losing a cleat.

1311
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:49,849
My God, this one, too.
They're both going.

1312
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,018
He's eating his way
through that line.

1313
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:53,978
He's working his way
right up to us.

1314
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:56,940
Quint!
Come on, Quint. Hurry!

1315
01:43:59,484 --> 01:44:00,777
Out of my way.

1316
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:06,991
Watch it.

1317
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:13,665
Untie this.
He'll pull out the transom.

1318
01:44:17,502 --> 01:44:19,462
Make it fast! We got
another line in him!

1319
01:44:19,546 --> 01:44:21,506
I can't,
it's trying to run!

1320
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:24,592
We better
get another line!

1321
01:44:24,676 --> 01:44:26,678
Pull,
you son of a bitch!

1322
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:29,180
I hope your back breaks!

1323
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:31,141
Go ahead. Pull your
bloody heart out.

1324
01:44:31,808 --> 01:44:33,184
Tie him off!

1325
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:40,692
It's impossible!

1326
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,570
Boys, it's too tight!

1327
01:44:44,028 --> 01:44:45,822
He's pulling us!

1328
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,659
We're breaking up
over here!

1329
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:58,543
We're breaking up!
Cut it!

1330
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:00,837
Watch your hands!

1331
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,257
Cut it quick.
I can't hold it!

1332
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,780
He can't stay down with three barrels on him.

1333
01:45:27,906 --> 01:45:30,074
Not with three barrels,
he can't.

1334
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:31,743
What about us?

1335
01:45:32,285 --> 01:45:35,955
Hooper, get the pump out of the locker in front of you,
will you?

1336
01:45:36,414 --> 01:45:38,166
We're going to sink,
aren't we?

1337
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:41,211
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.

1338
01:45:47,717 --> 01:45:49,260
Starting to go under.

1339
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:52,889
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

1340
01:46:27,757 --> 01:46:29,926
You ever have
one do this before?

1341
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:33,263
No.

1342
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:07,630
He's chasing us.
I don't believe it.

1343
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,263
I'm going to draw him
into the shallows.

1344
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:16,556
Draw him into
the shallow water.

1345
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,434
I'm going to draw him in
and drown him.

1346
01:47:19,684 --> 01:47:20,893
We're heading in, Brody.

1347
01:47:20,977 --> 01:47:22,145
Thank Christ!

1348
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,029
You ever had
a great white do that?

1349
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:32,447
No.

1350
01:47:38,536 --> 01:47:40,622
How far do we
have to go?

1351
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:45,793
Don't put that much
pressure on it.

1352
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:57,055
God damn it.

1353
01:47:57,138 --> 01:47:58,848
Shut up.
Get back there.

1354
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:05,730
Hold on.

1355
01:48:20,745 --> 01:48:26,000
Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies

1356
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:33,091
Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain

1357
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:39,847
For we received order
for to sail back to Boston

1358
01:48:40,223 --> 01:48:42,600
You idiot,
you burned out the bearings.

1359
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:47,730
All right,
stop the boat. Stop it.

1360
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:30,917
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

1361
01:50:34,754 --> 01:50:38,841
I think I can pump 20 cc of strychnine nitrate into him.

1362
01:50:39,217 --> 01:50:41,427
If I can get
close enough.

1363
01:50:43,888 --> 01:50:46,390
Get this little needle
through his skin?

1364
01:50:48,184 --> 01:50:49,769
No, I can't do that.

1365
01:50:51,729 --> 01:50:53,648
If I can get him
close to the cage,

1366
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:54,899
I can get him
in the mouth.

1367
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,526
That shark will rip
that cage to pieces.

1368
01:50:56,609 --> 01:50:59,028
You got any
better suggestions?

1369
01:51:24,262 --> 01:51:25,304
Easy.

1370
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,100
Up she goes.

1371
01:51:30,476 --> 01:51:32,228
Ease her up.

1372
01:52:24,113 --> 01:52:25,573
Ain't got no spit.

1373
01:52:40,922 --> 01:52:43,424
Try and keep him off me
until I'm lower.

1374
01:52:46,177 --> 01:52:47,637
Okay, I'm ready.

1375
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:48,025
Bring him up, God damn it.
Bring him up now!

1376
01:55:53,614 --> 01:55:55,366
Pull it up. Pull it.

1377
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:07,878
Pull him up. Come on, Quint,
bring him in.

1378
01:56:11,173 --> 01:56:12,550
It's giving way!

1379
01:56:24,562 --> 01:56:26,522
Rig something!

1380
01:56:29,525 --> 01:56:30,693
Got it?

1381
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:36,073
It's coming.

1382
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,367
Slow it down.

1383
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,035
Slower.

1384
01:59:51,977 --> 01:59:54,688
All right, come on.

1385
01:59:54,772 --> 01:59:56,315
Show me the tank.

1386
02:00:14,792 --> 02:00:16,126
Blow up!

1387
02:00:19,296 --> 02:00:21,090
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1388
02:01:50,262 --> 02:01:51,388
Quint?

1389
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:53,807
No.

1390
02:02:03,066 --> 02:02:04,735
Can we get in
on those?

1391
02:02:11,408 --> 02:02:12,826
What day is this?

1392
02:02:15,287 --> 02:02:17,664
It's Wednesday.
It's Tuesday, I think.

1393
02:02:19,291 --> 02:02:21,418
I think the tide's
with us.

1394
02:02:22,002 --> 02:02:23,587
Keep kicking.

1395
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:29,092
I used to
hate the water.

1396
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:33,138
I can't imagine why.
