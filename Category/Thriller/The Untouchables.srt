1
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:55,995
1930. Prohibition has transformed
Chicago into a City at War.

2
00:02:56,078 --> 00:03:03,502
Rival gangs complete for control
of the city's billion dollar empire

3
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:11,843
of illegal alcohol, enforcing their will
with the hand grenade and tommy gun.

4
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:16,013
It is the time of the Ganglords.
It is the time of Al Capone.

5
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:24,938
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

6
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:29,442
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

7
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:34,155
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

8
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,703
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

9
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:46,249
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

10
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,418
Some people say,
reformers here say:

11
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:52,588
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

12
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:56,258
What I hope I'm doing, and here's
where your paper's got a point,

13
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,761
is I'm responding to
the will of the people.

14
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:06,309
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

15
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:09,312
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

16
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,316
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

17
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:15,776
I'm a businessman.

18
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,989
Your reputation is that you control
your business through violence.

19
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:25,827
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

20
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,334
It's all right.

21
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:36,712
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

22
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:39,756
We used to say, "You can get further
with a kind word and a gun"

23
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:43,051
"than you can
with just a kind word."

24
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:46,638
And in that neighbourhood
it might've been true.

25
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:50,433
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

26
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:54,603
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me

27
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:59,108
and not by anybody I employ.
Because it's not good business.

28
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:34,598
Leave us alone down here,
we've got everything we need.

29
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:37,810
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

30
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:42,230
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

31
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:46,151
I'm not buyin' any.

32
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:52,198
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

33
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:58,245
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

34
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:02,499
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

35
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:04,918
Oh, she does?

36
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:09,297
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

37
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,887
- There you go.
- Thank you.

38
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:22,392
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

39
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,020
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that...

40
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:27,772
Hey, Mister! Wait!

41
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:31,359
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief...

42
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,089
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

43
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:43,675
I know.

44
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:47,137
Now it's time to go to work.

45
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:58,439
You'll make a good first impression.

46
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,282
I love you, Eliot.

47
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,996
Now, shoo.

48
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:23,420
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

49
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,131
- Mr Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

50
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,676
At the request
of the City of Chicago,

51
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,637
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme

52
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,391
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

53
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:41,395
Mr Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

54
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:44,481
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working

55
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,691
with the Chicago Police...

56
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:49,110
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

57
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,489
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr Ness?

58
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:57,576
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

59
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:00,996
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

60
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:02,622
It is the law of the land.

61
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:05,625
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

62
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,127
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

63
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,713
Do you have any political ambitions?

64
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,632
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

65
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:19,263
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

66
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,556
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

67
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:25,435
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

68
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:28,896
Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

69
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:32,066
Are you ready to meet the men?

70
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:35,486
Yes, I am.

71
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:48,289
I have one more thing to say.

72
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:55,421
I know that many of you take a drink.

73
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:59,508
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

74
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:03,261
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

75
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,058
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

76
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,852
But it's against the law.

77
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:15,314
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

78
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,696
Are there any questions?

79
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:27,450
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had

80
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,786
a man undercover here
for some time now.

81
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,038
We've received word
from this informant

82
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:35,749
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

83
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,669
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

84
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,389
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

85
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,850
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

86
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:59,605
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

87
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:04,234
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

88
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:14,618
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

89
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,460
- How are we doin'?
- Okay.

90
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:32,927
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

91
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,102
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

92
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:47,899
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

93
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,987
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:01,745
A message from my wife.

95
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,207
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

96
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,210
Nice to be married, huh?

97
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,228
Just follow me.

98
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:13,019
- Oh, God...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

99
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,563
Get 'em up. Drop it.

100
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:18,357
Damn it, I can't, it'll break.

101
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,943
Mr Ness. Look, I was just...

102
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:24,237
Geez, I'm sorry.

103
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,992
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

104
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,411
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

105
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,082
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

106
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,543
Okay. Just shut up.

107
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,945
All right now...
Let's do some good!

108
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,334
Hold it right there!

109
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,549
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

110
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:43,476
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

111
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,522
Preseuski.

112
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:51,692
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

113
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:54,862
- Mr Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

114
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:58,615
Let him through here.

115
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:02,911
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

116
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,414
- You ready?
- Ready.

117
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:34,607
Liquor, huh?

118
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,027
Get him out of here.

119
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,365
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

120
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:50,496
That means you, too.

121
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:57,252
Christ!

122
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:19,244
Now, what do you think you're doing?

123
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:24,374
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

124
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,794
Don't you have
more important things to do?

125
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:30,171
Yeah.

126
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,923
But I'm not doing them right now.

127
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,844
Do we understand each other?

128
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:42,974
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

129
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:48,229
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

130
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,317
All right.

131
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:57,237
Just remember
what we talked about now.

132
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:03,618
Hey... Wait a minute!

133
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:07,622
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn city?

134
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,708
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

135
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:14,670
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

136
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:18,006
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

137
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,973
What's your name and unit?

138
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:33,312
It's right here.

139
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,108
You got a beef?
What is it?

140
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:43,572
How did you know I had a gun?

141
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,534
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

142
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:51,287
No.

143
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:56,584
Are you okay, pal?

144
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:01,129
I had a rough day on the job.

145
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:05,842
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

146
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:12,807
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

147
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:20,814
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

148
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,192
Here endeth the lesson.

149
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:27,167
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

150
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,461
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

151
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,631
55 gallons to the barrel.

152
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,229
- It's Eddie.
- Come in, Eddie.

153
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:20,007
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good".

154
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:22,634
And then, we bust through...

155
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:15,224
- Mr Ness?
- Yes?

156
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:18,769
I came here to thank you.

157
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:20,395
It was...

158
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:24,399
...my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

159
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,735
I'm sorry. Please.

160
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:31,906
I'm... I'm so sorry.

161
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,911
You see, it's... because I know
that you have children, too.

162
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:44,251
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

163
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:48,171
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

164
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:51,048
And you do that, now.

165
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,354
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

166
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,733
Come in.

167
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:02,114
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

168
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:06,284
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

169
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:12,707
- Now, how can I help you?
- Just work with me.

170
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:16,502
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

171
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,589
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

172
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,800
If I'm such a good cop...

173
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:28,096
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

174
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:30,223
Do you want to tell me?

175
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:33,309
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

176
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:37,271
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

177
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,481
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

178
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,443
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

179
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:47,989
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

180
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:51,659
I'm askin' you for help.

181
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:59,625
Well... that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

182
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:08,633
Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and... twenty pounds ago.

183
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:14,555
But... I just think it got...
more important to me...

184
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,473
...to stay alive.

185
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,775
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

186
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:45,750
That's good, Andy. Let's start up
the thing and take a little ride.

187
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,503
I wanna hear
that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!

188
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:52,048
- Yeah, let me open the door here.
- Yeah, go ahead.

189
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:55,676
Whoopsy daisy,
pick up the door there, Andy.

190
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:59,805
Throw it in the back seat.
Now, let me get the thing started.

191
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:02,057
Yeah, start it up, Andy.

192
00:26:09,022 --> 00:26:12,108
Holy mackerel, Andy!
Listen to that Bearcat motor!

193
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:17,029
Yeah, it sounds like the bear
is chasin' that cat all round it!

194
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:20,741
Andy! She's boilin' over!

195
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,712
- Mr Ness?
- Yes.

196
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,339
Oscar Wallace.

197
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:42,260
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

198
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:44,721
- Really?
- Yes.

199
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,642
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me?

200
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:53,562
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have...

201
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,731
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

202
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,818
And the one I want to try first...
is this.

203
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:07,492
He has not filed a return since 1926.

204
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:12,705
- A return...?
- An income tax return.

205
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,708
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:20,337
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

207
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:25,550
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...

208
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,845
Would you excuse me?

209
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:34,600
Please.

210
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:02,626
Okay. Let's go.

211
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:06,754
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

212
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:13,677
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

213
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:20,392
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

214
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:25,188
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

215
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:28,358
And then what are you
prepared to do?

216
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,943
If you open the ball
on these people,

217
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,696
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

218
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:37,074
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

219
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,368
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

220
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:44,456
Here's how you get Capone:
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

221
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:47,417
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

222
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,254
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

223
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:56,759
Now, do you want to do that?

224
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,678
Are you ready to do that?

225
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:05,308
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

226
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,770
I have sworn to put this man away,

227
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:14,150
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

228
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,327
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

229
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,711
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr Ness?

230
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,881
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

231
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:44,135
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

232
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:47,972
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

233
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:51,642
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

234
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:56,355
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

235
00:29:56,563 --> 00:30:01,318
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

236
00:30:01,526 --> 00:30:04,529
Because I swore to uphold the law.

237
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:07,574
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

238
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:12,036
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

239
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:16,332
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

240
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,378
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

241
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,922
Get it off the tree.

242
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:26,508
Get it off the tree...

243
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:31,971
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

244
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:35,349
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

245
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:36,976
About face!

246
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:40,937
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr Eliot Ness.

247
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:44,941
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

248
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,779
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full...

249
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:53,240
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

250
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:58,370
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

251
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:00,998
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

252
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:03,792
- Good.
- Williamson!

253
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,504
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

254
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:13,217
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

255
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:17,846
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and...

256
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:20,766
To protect and serve...
To protect and...

257
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:25,145
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

258
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:28,356
- What I think? I...
- You...

259
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:31,692
...could help... the force.

260
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:35,696
- You can help...
- With the force.

261
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:40,534
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

262
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:48,625
At ease!

263
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:52,128
Stone! Out here.

264
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:56,423
This kid's a prodigy.

265
00:31:58,425 --> 00:32:02,679
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and...

266
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,849
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

267
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,103
Where are you from, Stone?

268
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:14,690
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

269
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,901
George Stone, that's your name?

270
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:23,740
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

271
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:26,284
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

272
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,999
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

273
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:36,126
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

274
00:32:37,294 --> 00:32:38,962
What's that you said?

275
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:42,966
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

276
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:49,013
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

277
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:53,017
Oh, I like him.

278
00:32:56,186 --> 00:32:58,230
Yeah, I like him, too.

279
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:01,733
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

280
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:05,236
Yeah, okay.

281
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:08,698
Eliot Ness.

282
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:12,827
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and...

283
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,788
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

284
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,130
What do you think?

285
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:28,591
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

286
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,637
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

287
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,391
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

288
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,393
We need another man.

289
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,812
Mr Ness? This is very interesting.

290
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,107
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu...

291
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,276
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

292
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,528
Carry a gun.

293
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:09,504
- Jimmy...?
- What?

294
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:14,341
What the hell are you dressed for?
Hallowe'en?

295
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,427
Shut up. I'm working.

296
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:18,178
Where? The circus?

297
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,492
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

298
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,786
Liquor raid.

299
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:47,956
Here?!

300
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:52,460
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

301
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:57,631
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

302
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:07,682
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

303
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:17,566
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

304
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:20,736
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

305
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,404
Yes, I do.

306
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:25,740
Good. Give me that axe.

307
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:37,418
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

308
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:39,920
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

309
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:43,131
- Everybody...
- What are you doin' here?

310
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,093
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

311
00:35:47,302 --> 00:35:51,097
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

312
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:54,934
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

313
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,605
How do you think he feels now?
Better... or worse?

314
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:10,781
- What is that?
- What is that?

315
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,160
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

316
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:19,373
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

317
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:24,044
Il Santo Jude.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

318
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:26,921
And policemen.

319
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,676
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

320
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,055
Lost causes, policemen...

321
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:39,850
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

322
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:41,893
- You do?
- Yes.

323
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:44,312
Why?

324
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:49,150
'To protect the property
and the citizenry... '

325
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:53,696
Whoa, it's all right.

326
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:56,407
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

327
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:00,410
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

328
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,496
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

329
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,332
Anything you say, Mr Ness.

330
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:10,586
Closer in... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

331
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,887
Life goes on.

332
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:29,103
A man becomes preeminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

333
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:31,355
Enthusiasms...

334
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:35,234
Enthusiasms...

335
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,570
What are mine?

336
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:43,575
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

337
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:47,036
- Dames!
- Boozin'!

338
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:51,999
Baseball!

339
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:00,549
A man...

340
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:04,094
A man stands alone at the plate.

341
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:08,723
This is the time for what?

342
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:12,435
For individual achievement.

343
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:16,146
There he stands alone.

344
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:19,525
But in the field, what?

345
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:22,986
Part of a team.

346
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:26,448
Teamwork...

347
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:34,872
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

348
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,294
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

349
00:38:43,046 --> 00:38:47,091
If his team don't field... what is he?

350
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,179
You follow me?

351
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:54,056
No one.

352
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:59,394
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

353
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:05,025
I'm goin' out there for myself.

354
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:11,739
But... I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

355
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:14,241
- Team!
- Team.

356
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:23,041
Jesus Christ!

357
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,107
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

358
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:52,693
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

359
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:55,696
'If I should die before I wake'

360
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:59,283
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

361
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:01,410
- Amen.
- God bless...

362
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:05,580
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

363
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:07,790
Amen.

364
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,592
Good night.

365
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:20,844
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

366
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:24,889
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

367
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:37,651
- Where are you going?
- What?

368
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:41,613
Where are you going?

369
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:44,658
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

370
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:49,120
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

371
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:51,455
And you've still got
some energy left?

372
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:53,374
Oh, a lot of work.

373
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:59,213
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'.

374
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:16,812
- How are we doin'?
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

375
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:21,441
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn

376
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,570
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings...

377
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:28,406
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

378
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:31,200
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

379
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:35,037
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs... the list is endless!

380
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:38,957
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

381
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:42,169
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show

382
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:46,506
that any of the 'organisation'
business money is going to him.

383
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:50,927
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

384
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:54,680
- Mr Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

385
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:57,975
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...

386
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,060
Yes, I know who you are.

387
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,690
Would you excuse us?

388
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,612
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

389
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:15,032
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

390
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,996
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

391
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,417
What's that?

392
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,383
- What is that?
- Mr Ness, you're an educated man.

393
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:38,053
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

394
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:44,059
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

395
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:49,897
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

396
00:42:50,106 --> 00:42:53,109
Would you come in here, please?

397
00:42:57,446 --> 00:43:02,284
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

398
00:43:02,492 --> 00:43:04,703
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag

399
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:08,539
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

400
00:43:08,748 --> 00:43:13,127
You tell your master
that we must agree to... disagree!

401
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:17,798
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

402
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:22,594
You fellows are 'untouchable',
is that it? No one can get to you?

403
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:26,181
You tell Capone...
that I'll see him in hell.

404
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:31,394
Hey! Nice house!

405
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:34,438
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

406
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:39,735
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

407
00:43:39,943 --> 00:43:41,903
Yes.

408
00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:44,364
Nice to have a family.

409
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:49,786
Yes, it is.

410
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:54,498
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

411
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,430
Catherine?!

412
00:44:12,932 --> 00:44:14,809
Catherine!

413
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:17,478
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

414
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:34,034
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

415
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:39,289
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

416
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,469
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

417
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:55,971
Okay, let's go.

418
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,975
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

419
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:05,271
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

420
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,858
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

421
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,864
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

422
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:17,324
Take off your hat.

423
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:20,869
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

424
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:23,288
Yes, Mr Ness.

425
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,251
Kiss.

426
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,587
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

427
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,176
Now, go!

428
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:00,906
Malone!

429
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,450
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:07,036
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

431
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:10,456
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

432
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:13,626
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

433
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:17,337
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

434
00:46:17,546 --> 00:46:20,007
A huge international
shipment's coming.

435
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:24,803
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

436
00:46:25,011 --> 00:46:28,097
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

437
00:46:29,182 --> 00:46:31,184
How do you come by this information?

438
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:33,519
That's the second rule
of police work:

439
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:36,480
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

440
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:45,030
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

441
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:47,824
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

442
00:46:48,032 --> 00:46:50,284
If we can establish
any payments to him,

443
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:53,537
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

444
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:55,080
What?

445
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:59,626
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

446
00:46:59,835 --> 00:47:03,171
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

447
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,424
Well, it's better than nothing.

448
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:10,636
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

449
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:13,764
I don't know.

450
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:17,893
Go to sleep, Oscar.

451
00:48:04,602 --> 00:48:07,814
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey

452
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:11,692
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organisation.

453
00:48:11,901 --> 00:48:15,487
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

454
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:21,576
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

455
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:24,996
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

456
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:29,125
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

457
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:32,461
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

458
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,465
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

459
00:48:36,674 --> 00:48:38,675
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

460
00:48:38,884 --> 00:48:43,555
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr Ness, is half the battle.

461
00:48:43,763 --> 00:48:46,975
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

462
00:48:47,183 --> 00:48:51,520
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

463
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:54,231
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

464
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,650
Thank you, Captain.

465
00:48:58,443 --> 00:49:01,530
All right! Move out!

466
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:21,673
Take it easy.

467
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:26,261
Take it easy!
It'll all happen in time.

468
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:29,972
This is the job.

469
00:49:30,181 --> 00:49:33,851
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

470
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:36,687
Just watch what does happen.

471
00:49:37,896 --> 00:49:39,940
Are you my 'tutor'?

472
00:49:41,149 --> 00:49:43,985
Yes, sir, that I am.

473
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:49,657
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

474
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:51,951
Then leave it alone.

475
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:55,204
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

476
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:59,041
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

477
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,547
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

478
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:08,841
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

479
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,136
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

480
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:16,682
Stitches and standing in the rain...

481
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,086
Listen, Mr Ness...

482
00:50:49,962 --> 00:50:51,589
I had an idea.

483
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:50,143
You all have your spare shells?

484
00:52:04,572 --> 00:52:09,160
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

485
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:12,288
And put your man down.

486
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,459
Because he'll do the same to you.

487
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,920
Shoot to kill.

488
00:52:20,128 --> 00:52:24,466
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

489
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,511
Let's go.

490
00:52:51,991 --> 00:52:53,367
Easy...

491
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:57,204
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

492
00:52:57,454 --> 00:53:00,999
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

493
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,918
George, the count's right.

494
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:06,421
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

495
00:53:06,629 --> 00:53:09,298
Malone, you and I will
take the men...

496
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:12,426
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

497
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:16,138
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

498
00:53:17,097 --> 00:53:18,432
Charge!

499
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:22,561
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'.

500
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:29,817
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

501
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,986
Move, move!

502
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:43,830
Let's go!

503
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:49,502
I can't believe it!

504
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,755
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

505
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,757
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

506
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:15,484
Stone, take the first car!

507
00:54:17,194 --> 00:54:19,655
Get this shit out of the way!

508
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:40,674
Tough guy!

509
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:45,637
Stone!

510
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:47,222
Go!

511
00:54:49,015 --> 00:54:50,892
Stone!

512
00:54:52,018 --> 00:54:53,310
I'm okay.

513
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:56,897
You thugs!

514
00:55:11,118 --> 00:55:13,329
You all right?

515
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:16,415
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

516
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:33,139
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

517
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:37,059
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

518
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:40,270
Hello.

519
00:57:02,429 --> 00:57:03,888
All right! Drop the gun!

520
00:57:04,097 --> 00:57:06,558
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

521
00:57:07,684 --> 00:57:09,685
I said, drop it!

522
00:57:11,604 --> 00:57:13,147
Stop!

523
00:57:18,152 --> 00:57:21,405
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

524
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:23,740
What are you, deaf?!

525
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:27,035
What is this, a game?!

526
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:55,060
Here. Sit down.

527
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,529
Stone's gonna be all right.

528
00:58:06,779 --> 00:58:09,699
I got the fellow with the satchel.

529
00:58:16,372 --> 00:58:18,707
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

530
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:21,793
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

531
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:26,756
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

532
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:31,552
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

533
00:58:31,802 --> 00:58:35,055
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

534
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:38,892
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

535
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:42,771
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

536
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:46,357
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

537
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:49,610
Why don't you kiss my ass?

538
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:51,988
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

539
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,281
- You've broken the law...
- Eliot!

540
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,533
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

541
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:59,786
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

542
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,789
- Eliot!
- What?!

543
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,333
Look at this!

544
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,419
- Look at this!
- What is this?

545
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,423
What is this?

546
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:16,969
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

547
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:21,431
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'?

548
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:26,478
And you got a heading here...
'Circuit Court'.

549
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:30,314
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court'. What is this?

550
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:33,484
Nothin'. There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

551
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:37,071
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

552
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:39,072
then we can put Capone away.

553
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:42,951
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

554
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:45,954
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

555
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:48,581
Translate this ledger for us!

556
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:50,374
- In hell.
- In hell?!

557
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:55,296
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

558
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:59,132
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

559
00:59:59,383 --> 01:00:01,093
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

560
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:07,765
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

561
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,892
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

562
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:12,895
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

563
01:00:13,145 --> 01:00:16,231
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

564
01:00:20,027 --> 01:00:22,320
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

565
01:00:22,529 --> 01:00:25,865
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

566
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:28,076
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

567
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:30,453
I'm gonna count to three.

568
01:00:32,371 --> 01:00:35,916
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

569
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,336
One.

570
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,467
Two!

571
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:48,928
Three.

572
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:51,472
I'm gonna talk!

573
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:56,268
Don't! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

574
01:00:59,396 --> 01:01:03,149
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

575
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:06,402
Now, ask him what you want to know.

576
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:10,781
All right... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

577
01:01:11,032 --> 01:01:15,160
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete...

578
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:17,830
Mister Ness!

579
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,254
I do not approve of your methods!

580
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:32,134
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

581
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:38,599
- What?
- They got the shipment.

582
01:01:38,807 --> 01:01:41,351
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

583
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,522
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate...

584
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:51,652
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

585
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:56,448
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

586
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:59,868
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

587
01:02:00,077 --> 01:02:02,370
I want to piss on his ashes!

588
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:07,834
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

589
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:11,295
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

590
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:13,464
- Yes.
- Like what?

591
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:16,675
Like what his name is.

592
01:02:16,884 --> 01:02:21,054
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

593
01:02:21,263 --> 01:02:23,765
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

594
01:02:24,516 --> 01:02:27,852
No... it'll be Edgar.

595
01:02:29,353 --> 01:02:32,940
- It'll be J. Edgar...
- I don't think so.

596
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:38,904
God, you're beautiful.

597
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:42,991
You should have seen us last night.

598
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:48,204
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

599
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:51,707
I know. I understand, I do.

600
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,128
Just tell me, are you being careful?

601
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:59,840
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

602
01:03:00,048 --> 01:03:02,175
- Progress?
- Yes?

603
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:06,596
Mrs Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

604
01:03:15,229 --> 01:03:19,733
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone

605
01:03:19,942 --> 01:03:24,863
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading

606
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:28,616
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

607
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:31,953
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

608
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:36,248
Mr Capone could have
up to 28 years.

609
01:03:36,457 --> 01:03:39,626
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

610
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:50,469
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

611
01:03:50,678 --> 01:03:52,805
- We'll call, let it ring...
- Twice.

612
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:54,932
- We'll call...
- From the corner.

613
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:58,727
- Anybody knocks on the door...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

614
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:01,938
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

615
01:04:02,147 --> 01:04:04,941
Much more diverting
than accounting.

616
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:07,318
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

617
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:10,988
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

618
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,413
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

619
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:21,873
Okay, we see yous tonight.

620
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:25,835
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

621
01:04:33,926 --> 01:04:37,596
...he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

622
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:43,560
For which I must commend
the excellent work

623
01:04:43,768 --> 01:04:47,438
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

624
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:52,401
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

625
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:55,571
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

626
01:04:55,779 --> 01:04:58,740
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

627
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:02,327
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

628
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:05,997
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

629
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:10,543
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

630
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:16,048
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

631
01:05:16,256 --> 01:05:17,841
Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace?

632
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:23,555
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

633
01:05:24,556 --> 01:05:28,601
- You keep an eye out at all times...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

634
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:31,270
They are going to...

635
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:42,656
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

636
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:52,164
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

637
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:34,537
Oh, no.

638
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:38,707
- No, no!
- Easy... Easy!

639
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:42,752
Oscar.

640
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,999
Oh, Jesus.

641
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,505
You gonna be all right?

642
01:07:50,648 --> 01:07:55,819
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

643
01:07:56,904 --> 01:08:00,032
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

644
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,868
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

645
01:08:04,077 --> 01:08:06,204
Jimmy!

646
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:10,082
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

647
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:12,335
You know what I mean?

648
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:31,352
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr Capone...

649
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,064
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr Capone...

650
01:08:35,522 --> 01:08:37,149
I said...

651
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:47,075
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

652
01:08:47,283 --> 01:08:50,036
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

653
01:08:52,955 --> 01:08:55,249
Now he does.

654
01:08:55,457 --> 01:08:59,795
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

655
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,338
That's it, come on!

656
01:09:01,546 --> 01:09:05,133
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

657
01:09:05,383 --> 01:09:09,345
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

658
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:11,430
- What?
- Easy.

659
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:15,184
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

660
01:09:17,978 --> 01:09:21,148
Easy. It's me. It's me!

661
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:23,108
Not this way.

662
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:25,985
You fuck, you got nothin'!
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

663
01:09:26,194 --> 01:09:31,907
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'!

664
01:09:32,116 --> 01:09:36,495
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin', you punk!

665
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,965
Well, no, I understand.

666
01:09:49,173 --> 01:09:52,051
Believe me, I understand.

667
01:09:59,474 --> 01:10:01,852
Well, what's happened?

668
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:07,940
He says he can't be unprotected.

669
01:10:09,692 --> 01:10:12,361
What is it that the guy says?

670
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:15,197
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

671
01:10:15,406 --> 01:10:18,742
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

672
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:23,204
So tomorrow morning the D.A. Will
announce that he's dropping the case.

673
01:10:23,413 --> 01:10:27,292
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

674
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,169
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

675
01:10:30,378 --> 01:10:34,048
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

676
01:10:35,132 --> 01:10:37,176
Hello?

677
01:10:39,219 --> 01:10:41,263
Hello.

678
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:44,891
Yes.

679
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:51,147
No, he didn't have a family.

680
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:56,318
How is everything there?

681
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:03,074
No, you do it however you want.

682
01:11:05,118 --> 01:11:07,370
I promise I will.

683
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:10,790
You give her my love.

684
01:11:10,998 --> 01:11:13,042
I love you, too.

685
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:20,340
Mr Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

686
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:24,511
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
- I think that's enough for today.

687
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,765
- If we don't stay on top...
- That'll do. Thank you.

688
01:11:28,973 --> 01:11:32,893
I'd like to request to stick around.

689
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:36,647
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

690
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,615
Is that it?

691
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,327
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

692
01:11:51,535 --> 01:11:53,996
My question is, are we done?

693
01:11:55,998 --> 01:11:58,375
Yes, I think we're done.

694
01:11:58,584 --> 01:12:01,461
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

695
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:04,047
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr Wallace.

696
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:06,549
He's dead! And the D.A.
Is gonna drop the case!

697
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:09,052
He will not go into court
without a witness

698
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,221
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

699
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:17,267
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

700
01:12:17,518 --> 01:12:20,270
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

701
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:38,370
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was...

702
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:42,249
- My wife?
- Yeah.

703
01:12:46,211 --> 01:12:49,088
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

704
01:12:51,424 --> 01:12:53,759
It's nice being married, eh?

705
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:56,345
Yes.

706
01:12:56,553 --> 01:12:59,848
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

707
01:13:00,057 --> 01:13:04,352
going over...
kitchen colour charts or something.

708
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:16,697
Some part of the world still cares
what colour the kitchen is.

709
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:25,538
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

710
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:31,502
Get back to the D.A. And stall him.

711
01:13:32,211 --> 01:13:36,382
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

712
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:42,220
I think I know how to find this guy.

713
01:13:44,305 --> 01:13:47,058
Walter?

714
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:52,271
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

715
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,441
We're leavin' tonight.

716
01:13:58,277 --> 01:14:00,779
Two ball, down.

717
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,869
Mike, you got a minute?

718
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,746
I do now, don't I?

719
01:14:11,872 --> 01:14:15,167
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

720
01:14:16,126 --> 01:14:18,670
This is a place for cops.

721
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:21,465
Can we step outside?

722
01:14:21,715 --> 01:14:26,052
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

723
01:14:30,348 --> 01:14:35,811
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

724
01:14:38,147 --> 01:14:40,899
What? What?!

725
01:14:41,108 --> 01:14:44,194
I just need one more
piece of information.

726
01:14:44,402 --> 01:14:46,362
One more? Jimmy!

727
01:14:46,571 --> 01:14:51,617
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

728
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:58,707
Are you crazy? You're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

729
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:02,919
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

730
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:07,715
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

731
01:15:07,924 --> 01:15:10,176
And I tried to save your life.

732
01:15:11,052 --> 01:15:15,639
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'.

733
01:15:15,848 --> 01:15:19,017
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

734
01:15:19,226 --> 01:15:24,230
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

735
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:28,651
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

736
01:15:28,901 --> 01:15:34,406
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

737
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:41,913
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

738
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:46,125
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

739
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:50,463
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

740
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:54,717
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

741
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,469
I'm gonna turn you over!

742
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:01,223
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

743
01:16:03,391 --> 01:16:05,226
You're dead.

744
01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:29,499
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

745
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:32,543
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'.

746
01:16:41,093 --> 01:16:44,179
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

747
01:16:44,387 --> 01:16:47,432
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

748
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,143
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

749
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:53,938
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool...

750
01:16:54,146 --> 01:16:56,774
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

751
01:16:56,982 --> 01:16:59,568
I have men out there
risking more than that.

752
01:16:59,776 --> 01:17:02,279
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead

753
01:17:02,529 --> 01:17:07,450
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

754
01:17:09,535 --> 01:17:11,579
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

755
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:13,372
He's at the D.A. 's.

756
01:17:13,622 --> 01:17:16,542
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

757
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,561
- Al! Al!
- Mr Capone!

758
01:17:37,769 --> 01:17:42,190
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'.

759
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:46,528
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

760
01:17:47,612 --> 01:17:50,781
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole',

761
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:54,243
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

762
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:55,869
You understand?

763
01:17:56,704 --> 01:18:01,208
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

764
01:18:01,416 --> 01:18:04,169
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

765
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:10,841
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

766
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:13,677
To speak to me like men? No.

767
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:16,805
To harass a peaceful man.

768
01:18:18,223 --> 01:18:20,267
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

769
01:18:20,475 --> 01:18:23,853
I would have
just a little more self respect.

770
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:30,401
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

771
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:33,571
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

772
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:23,518
Isn't that just like a wop?

773
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:27,438
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

774
01:21:31,734 --> 01:21:34,278
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

775
01:21:35,654 --> 01:21:37,781
Go on, get your ass out of here!

776
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,793
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

777
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:25,630
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

778
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,257
Round the back.

779
01:23:36,849 --> 01:23:39,059
Malone!

780
01:23:41,937 --> 01:23:43,980
Malone.

781
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:13,841
Goddamn! Stone!

782
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,554
Stone!

783
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,182
The phone!

784
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,853
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

785
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:33,317
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

786
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:36,445
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

787
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:40,240
This? You want this?

788
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:46,329
You want this?

789
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:55,004
What?

790
01:25:02,177 --> 01:25:04,179
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

791
01:25:05,472 --> 01:25:07,473
- Book...
- The bookkeeper?

792
01:25:07,724 --> 01:25:10,893
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

793
01:25:12,103 --> 01:25:14,396
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

794
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:16,690
He's on this train.

795
01:25:17,816 --> 01:25:21,319
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

796
01:25:23,863 --> 01:25:26,783
No. Malone. No.

797
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:29,744
Stay. Stay.

798
01:25:29,952 --> 01:25:32,371
Stay! Malone...

799
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,623
No. No, no!

800
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:39,920
Not this... Not this man...

801
01:26:05,652 --> 01:26:10,198
Train's leavin' for Miami
12.05, Mr Ness.

802
01:26:12,116 --> 01:26:13,951
We'll be there.

803
01:26:16,161 --> 01:26:19,539
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

804
01:26:19,748 --> 01:26:22,500
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

805
01:26:33,052 --> 01:26:35,179
Cover the south entrance.

806
01:27:23,265 --> 01:27:26,434
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

807
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:34,900

Flier departs at 12.05 from 33.

All aboard!

822
01:30:56,794 --> 01:31:02,257
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

823
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:05,885
Are you all right? Thank you.

824
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,556
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

825
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:14,768
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

826
01:31:18,438 --> 01:31:21,358
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

827
01:31:21,608 --> 01:31:25,653
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

828
01:31:30,074 --> 01:31:33,828
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

829
01:31:35,913 --> 01:31:39,333
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

830
01:31:41,293 --> 01:31:43,420
Thank you, sir.

831
01:31:52,053 --> 01:31:55,723
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

832
01:31:55,931 --> 01:31:59,017
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

833
01:32:01,186 --> 01:32:06,649
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

834
01:32:08,818 --> 01:32:12,446
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

835
01:32:13,656 --> 01:32:15,866
Is something wrong?

836
01:32:17,117 --> 01:32:18,452
Sir?

837
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:16,977
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

838
01:34:17,769 --> 01:34:21,314
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

839
01:34:24,818 --> 01:34:27,362
- What are you doin'?
- Shut the fuck up!

840
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:30,907
- Hold it!
- Please...

841
01:34:31,115 --> 01:34:33,742
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

842
01:34:36,495 --> 01:34:38,288
I said hold it!

843
01:34:39,665 --> 01:34:42,250
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

844
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,420
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

845
01:34:48,089 --> 01:34:50,299
See? Or else he dies.

846
01:34:50,508 --> 01:34:53,552
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'.

847
01:34:56,972 --> 01:35:00,183
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

848
01:35:00,934 --> 01:35:05,939
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'!

849
01:35:06,147 --> 01:35:10,568
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

850
01:35:10,776 --> 01:35:13,279
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

851
01:35:18,325 --> 01:35:20,369
- One!
- Will you stop it!

852
01:35:26,916 --> 01:35:28,918
Take him.

853
01:35:30,545 --> 01:35:33,047
Two.

854
01:35:59,196 --> 01:36:01,865
The two coded entries
in this ledger

855
01:36:02,073 --> 01:36:06,744
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

856
01:36:06,953 --> 01:36:12,625
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

857
01:36:14,627 --> 01:36:17,463
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

858
01:36:19,047 --> 01:36:21,299
I said that is correct.

859
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:26,346
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

860
01:36:28,556 --> 01:36:30,683
I will.

861
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:33,227
Sorry, Mr Payne, I can't hear you.

862
01:36:33,435 --> 01:36:36,230
I said, I will.

863
01:36:36,438 --> 01:36:41,151
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr Capone?

864
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:42,694
Yes, I was.

865
01:36:42,903 --> 01:36:45,947
And you personally
distributed monies...

866
01:36:46,155 --> 01:36:50,201
...vast, undeclared monies...

867
01:36:50,409 --> 01:36:53,746
...to Mr Capone?

868
01:36:53,954 --> 01:36:56,331
Yes, I did.

869
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:59,376
Would you tell us the amounts?

870
01:37:00,794 --> 01:37:06,925
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr Capone

871
01:37:07,175 --> 01:37:12,054
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

872
01:37:14,848 --> 01:37:17,726
Would you repeat that amount, please?

873
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:24,566
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

874
01:37:39,997 --> 01:37:43,208
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

875
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:47,587
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

876
01:38:10,691 --> 01:38:13,986
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

877
01:38:16,905 --> 01:38:19,616
Get me the bailiff.

878
01:38:21,243 --> 01:38:22,619
It'll be a fast trial.

879
01:38:26,414 --> 01:38:30,835
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

880
01:38:31,043 --> 01:38:35,964
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

881
01:38:42,846 --> 01:38:45,890
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

882
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:19,046
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

883
01:39:20,088 --> 01:39:23,842
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

884
01:39:24,092 --> 01:39:27,679
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

885
01:39:31,015 --> 01:39:35,644
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

886
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:40,482
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

887
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:42,943
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

888
01:39:43,151 --> 01:39:46,988
"Mr Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

889
01:39:47,238 --> 01:39:49,657
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

890
01:39:49,866 --> 01:39:53,327
I'm sorry, Mr Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

891
01:39:53,536 --> 01:39:57,498
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

892
01:39:57,706 --> 01:40:00,876
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

893
01:40:31,028 --> 01:40:36,325
1634 Racine... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

894
01:40:50,463 --> 01:40:53,090
Don't. Let him go.

895
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,930
- No!
- Here, take it.

896
01:45:10,326 --> 01:45:15,664
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

897
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:19,418
What are you waitin' for?

898
01:45:20,502 --> 01:45:23,505
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

899
01:45:27,508 --> 01:45:29,969
Don't push me.

900
01:45:32,638 --> 01:45:35,349
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

901
01:45:35,557 --> 01:45:38,685
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

902
01:45:38,894 --> 01:45:41,062
'Cause you killed my friend!

903
01:45:41,271 --> 01:45:44,899
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

904
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:48,736
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

905
01:45:48,986 --> 01:45:52,448
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

906
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,671
Did he sound anything like that?

907
01:46:39,074 --> 01:46:41,993
One picture, come on, one picture.

908
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:47,248
Mr Ness, take a look at this.

909
01:46:48,833 --> 01:46:50,626
Mr Ness?

910
01:46:52,253 --> 01:46:56,715
Mr Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

911
01:46:57,799 --> 01:47:00,677
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr Ness.

912
01:47:00,886 --> 01:47:02,679
They've been bribed.

913
01:47:02,887 --> 01:47:06,975
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

914
01:47:08,518 --> 01:47:10,645
He's in the car.

915
01:47:29,453 --> 01:47:33,582
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow...

916
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:39,463
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

917
01:47:39,713 --> 01:47:44,592
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

918
01:47:44,801 --> 01:47:48,888
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

919
01:47:49,096 --> 01:47:53,726
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must...

920
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:57,354
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr Ness.

921
01:48:07,363 --> 01:48:09,949
Would you excuse us?

922
01:49:12,214 --> 01:49:14,008
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

923
01:49:18,679 --> 01:49:21,473
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

924
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:24,809
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

925
01:49:25,018 --> 01:49:30,273
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

926
01:49:32,066 --> 01:49:35,736
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

927
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,363
What's he talking about?

928
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:44,702
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

929
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:47,246
Your Honour, I object!

930
01:49:47,455 --> 01:49:49,415
Overruled.

931
01:49:53,419 --> 01:49:55,212
What did you tell him?

932
01:49:57,005 --> 01:50:00,258
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

933
01:50:01,593 --> 01:50:04,387
His name wasn't in the ledger!

934
01:50:04,596 --> 01:50:07,640
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

935
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:09,350
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

936
01:50:09,559 --> 01:50:12,895
- I think...
- Do somethin' here.

937
01:50:13,104 --> 01:50:15,689
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'!

938
01:50:16,273 --> 01:50:18,275
Order!

939
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:23,613
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

940
01:50:23,822 --> 01:50:25,782
and enter a plea of Guilty.

941
01:50:29,368 --> 01:50:32,163
- Guilty?
- Order in the court!

942
01:50:32,413 --> 01:50:34,415
Order!

943
01:50:43,089 --> 01:50:46,259
Bailiff! Bailiff!

944
01:50:46,467 --> 01:50:48,928
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

945
01:50:50,429 --> 01:50:51,764
Eliot!

946
01:50:51,972 --> 01:50:55,142
Your Honour!
Is that justice?

947
01:50:55,351 --> 01:50:58,020
Please, why did he switch the jury?

948
01:50:58,228 --> 01:51:00,814
Are you gonna go
after the organisation?

949
01:51:01,022 --> 01:51:02,482
Excuse me.

950
01:51:03,775 --> 01:51:07,070
I'm askin' Your Honour,
is this justice?

951
01:51:11,907 --> 01:51:14,159
Is this justice?

952
01:51:17,037 --> 01:51:19,748
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

953
01:51:19,956 --> 01:51:21,458
What did you say?

954
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:24,794
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

955
01:51:25,003 --> 01:51:27,046
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

956
01:51:27,255 --> 01:51:29,799
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

957
01:51:30,007 --> 01:51:32,802
Here endeth the lesson.

958
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:37,264
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

959
01:51:37,473 --> 01:51:40,684
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

960
01:52:58,839 --> 01:53:01,007
So much violence.

961
01:54:07,235 --> 01:54:09,654
Cleaning up a little.

962
01:54:18,328 --> 01:54:21,331
I guess this is goodbye.

963
01:54:22,666 --> 01:54:24,250
Goodbye, George.

964
01:54:26,878 --> 01:54:29,964
I want to... thank you for this.

965
01:54:31,048 --> 01:54:32,842
No. Thank you.

966
01:54:48,731 --> 01:54:53,360
Mr Ness... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

967
01:54:53,569 --> 01:54:56,655
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

968
01:55:00,283 --> 01:55:02,869
I'm going home.

969
01:55:13,796 --> 01:55:16,423
Mr Ness!
Any comment for the record?

970
01:55:16,632 --> 01:55:19,343
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

971
01:55:19,509 --> 01:55:22,095
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

972
01:55:22,345 --> 01:55:25,348
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

973
01:55:25,557 --> 01:55:28,643
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
