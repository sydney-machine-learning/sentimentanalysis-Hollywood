1
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,400
See you at six o'clock
at the station.

2
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,400
To speak properly it is necessary
to enunciate every syllable.

3
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,700
Example: 20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

4
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,800
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,500
Example: 20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

6
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,100
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

7
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:59,400
- This is like a lavender.
- Yes, it goes well with white.

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Exquisite combination, Mr. Siegel.
Just as tasteful as always.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,400
- Mr. Siegel. Floor please, madam?
- Penthouse.

10
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,100
If we make love,
it'll be the only time.

11
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,500
- What if you like it?
- I know I'll like it.

12
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:54,200
- I got off on the wrong floor.
- You'd better get back on.

13
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,800
- Don't stop...
- Is that hurting?

14
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,100
Meyer, I've got half an hour.
I've got ten minutes of sunlamp...

15
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,600
All right,
I'll do the sunlamp on the train.

16
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,700
Of course I'm alone.
She was an hour ago.

17
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,300
I've got to do it.

18
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Call Charlie. He likes to take a nap
when there's going to be trouble.

19
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Ben, it really affects my opinion
of your ability to administrate -

20
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,300
- when you get yourself involved in
this type of detaiI. Right, Charlie?

21
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,100
- Of course.
- See what I'm talking about?

22
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,200
- You just shook his head.
- What else was I gonna to do?

23
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,700
Count to 53.

24
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,700
- Good evening, Mr. Siegel.
- Hi, give that a brush for me.

25
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,200
- Weren't you going to California?
- I came to give you a present.

26
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,000
- Present?
- Yeah, open it.

27
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,100
- I don't get it.
- We hired you to do a job.

28
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,700
We pay you a nice salary,
we throw in a piece of the action -

29
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,700
- and you pay us back
by stealing from us.

30
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,300
Do you want the shirt off my back?
I'd be happy to give it you.

31
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,800
Here, from Sulka's.
They're the ones I wear.

32
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,900
If I'd taken longer, I'd have
bought some pants and some suits.

33
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,400
But I can give you some tips.
Let me see your shoes.

34
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,500
I don't want to be rude to you,
but they don't go with anything.

35
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,000
$3,900 we paid three guys to take
care of this. Why are we here?

36
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,900
You know his thinking process.
Ben has only one problem.

37
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,700
The same problem he had when
we were kids together on the street.

38
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,200
He doesn't respect money.

39
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,100
But that's for summer... and you
don't have to worry about summer.

40
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,100
If it was just business, I'd sell
insurance or import dresses.

41
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,200
The key to taking over Jack Dragna's
Southern California rackets -

42
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,000
- is to come in smooth. Approach
him like we want to be a partner.

43
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,700
The guy's been running the rackets
for 20 years with no competition.

44
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,800
- Except for Mickey Cohen.
- So we move in amiably.

45
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,500
- What about the bars and clubs?
- Fifty-fifty.

46
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,100
We move in,
but we don't ruin anything.

47
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,500
- Joey A. Knows Jack Dragna.
- Jack's a cold-blooded killer.

48
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,100
You've got to be careful. Don't say
nothing he'd take offence at.

49
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,300
- What are you smiling at?
- Nothing.

50
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,100
- Why can't we go to California?
- Maybe next time.

51
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,000
When you get to Los Angeles,
don't call George.

52
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,900
He's a movie star now, and attracts
more attention than Roosevelt.

53
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,100
- This has to be quick and quiet.
- And amiable.

54
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,600
Very funny. 12 days.

55
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Four days out. Four days
of diplomacy. Four days back.

56
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:57,100
- Ben, could I talk to you a minute?
- After I say goodbye to the family.

57
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,500
I'll miss you.

58
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,500
When I get you on the phone,
tell me what presents you want.

59
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,800
- I already know what I want.
- Don't tell me now. Think about it.

60
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,500
- I need money, Ben. $50,000.
- For what?

61
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,300
The cops, the D.A., the FBI.
They're threatening to lock me up.

62
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,000
They're no good, these people,
except assistant D.A. Allen Stein.

63
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,300
Jewish kid.
His family's from Bedford Street.

64
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,100
What happened to the 50,000
for the armoured truck heist?

65
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,200
It's gone. You know me with money,
I blew it at the track.

66
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you saying that if you don't
get it you're going to rat on me?

67
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,800
You? Never. I love you, Ben.
I would never rat on you.

68
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,500
You ain't gonna kill me, are you?

69
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,400
I'm going to try very hard
to forget that this ever happened.

70
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,900
- I owe you my life, Ben.
- I'd say that's a fair assessment.

71
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,600
Bend your knees, Harry.

72
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,500
When you jump from the train, bend
your knees to soften the impact.

73
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay, Ben. Sure thing.

74
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,700
This has been four of the most
wonderful days I've ever spent.

75
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,800
A lot of it
was in the motion of the train.

76
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:26,100
He knows you. Are you somebody, too?
I love you, George.

77
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,600
- You look like a million bucks.
- You're looking good yourself.

78
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,500
Well, that's what they pay me for.
Okay, we're moving on here.

79
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,000
You're at the Beverly Hills Hotel,
bungalow five.

80
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,100
I know you said four days,
but I reserved six.

81
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,100
- Jack Dragna's the kingpin here.
- He runs a nice little operation.

82
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,700
<i>You've got a city with 3 million
people and his operation is little?</i>

83
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
Less to worry about. I'll drop you,
then run back to the studio.

84
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,000
- Why don't I go with you?
- If you like.

85
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,300
Hank's my friend. A dame like you
will give him a lot of headaches.

86
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,300
- I'm on to you.
- The blueprints are all drawn.

87
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,000
- New cigarette.
- She's eaten a whole cigarette.

88
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,100
Forget that you've ever seen him.
Here, get what I mean?

89
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,000
Take that money
and buy yourself some manners.

90
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,100
To waste on you?

91
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,600
Two bucks for one beer
and some phoney champagne?

92
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Here's half a buck.
Split it between you.

93
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,600
Two bucks for one beer
and some phoney champagne?

94
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,100
- Here's half a buck.
- You're so cheap you're wholesale.

95
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,900
Don't forget, mister,
I asked you nice.

96
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,400
Rolling, quiet please.

97
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,600
Benny, you want to hit somebody
with a chair?

98
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,800
With this
I can hit home runs all night.

99
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,500
- Take this in case I come back.
- Can't I have a line?

100
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,400
Honey, he's the star.

101
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:40,500
- That was impressive, Georgie boy.
- I'm a pro.

102
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,000
May I?

103
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
If you want an answer,
finish the question.

104
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,600
- Light your cigarette?
- Sure.

105
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,500
I thought you were going to ask me
something a little more exciting.

106
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,600
- Like what?
- Use your imagination.

107
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,300
- I'm using it.
- Let me know when you're finished.

108
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,400
Is she a bit player?

109
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,500
Flamingo? Not for Joey Adonis.
That's Virginia Hill.

110
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,800
Joey's crazy. No woman is worth
a bullet between the eyes.

111
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,800
It depends on whose eyes
and which woman.

112
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,100
Why is Ben Siegel so interested in
a gal who's going with his friend?

113
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,200
Joey A? He's just an associate.
Are you still going with him?

114
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,900
If it were New Year's Eve, he'd be
my date. Who would your date be?

115
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,300
Wife. Esta. E-S-T-A.

116
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,900
I'll bet Esta lives her life
faithful to her one and only Ben, -

117
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,100
- who plays around like a jackrabbit
and lies through his teeth.

118
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,900
- I don't lie to Esta.
- Do you confess your sins to her?

119
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,100
What exactly does Mr. Esta
want from Miss Virginia?

120
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,100
Mr. Esta can't imagine anything
he doesn't want from Miss Virginia.

121
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,100
- Are you ready for a divorce?
- Never.

122
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,600
You're pretty ferocious
where Mom is concerned.

123
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,700
The rest of the time you're just
a sweet-talking, fuck-happy fellow -

124
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
- with some good dialogue.
Dialogue's cheap in Hollywood.

125
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,300
Why don't you run outside
and jerk yourself a soda?

126
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,800
How would someone go about
getting a screen test done?

127
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,400
- Do you know someone who wants one?
- No, I'm just interested.

128
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,300
What about Virginia Hill?
Does she have a future in movies?

129
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm not sure of my own future.
Lana Turner lives there.

130
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,800
Cesar Romero lives there.

131
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,400
Gary Cooper is there on the right.
He paid 45 grand.

132
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,300
- Houses bring that kind of money?
- Sure, and more.

133
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,000
- Who's is that?
- Lawrence... The opera singer.

134
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,300
- Not Melchoir, the other guy.
- Lawrence Tibbett? Stop.

135
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,400
- What are you doing?
- Paying my respects.

136
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm looking for Lawrence Tibbett.
My name's Ben Siegel.

137
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,700
- Is he expecting you?
- Not unless he's psychic.

138
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,700
Would you excuse me a moment?

139
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:41,000
- How far is your house from here?
- Half a mile. What are you doing?

140
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,800
Mr. Siegel.

141
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,300
You have no idea
what an honour it is to meet you.

142
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,600
I took my family to hear you sing
"Rigoletto" at the Met last year.

143
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,900
- It was a great evening.
- You overwhelm me, Mr. Siegel.

144
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,600
- That's beautiful.
- Are you related to Bugsy Siegel?

145
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,100
- "Bugsy"? What do you mean?
- I beg your pardon.

146
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,800
A bug is nothing.
The word has no meaning.

147
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,400
A bug is a colloquialism.
It has no basis in reality.

148
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,000
Insects include a wide variety
of living creatures.

149
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,500
None of them can be called a bug!

150
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,000
I certainly didn't mean
any offence, Mr. Siegel.

151
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Mind if I look around, Larry?

152
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,500
- Do you mind if I call you Larry?
- All my friends call me Larry.

153
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,300
- What brings you to L.A., Ben?
- Curiosity.

154
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,500
A wonderful house. What do you
think of the Beverly Hills Hotel?

155
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,400
- It's the best hotel in town.
- A bungalow or a suite?

156
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,400
- A bungalow. Which do you have?
- I don't. You do. Bungalow 5.

157
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,100
- I don't understand...
- I'm buying this house.

158
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,400
- This house isn't for sale.
- Sure it is. Everything's for sale.

159
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,000
- How much do you want?
- Mr. Siegel...

160
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
- Ben.
- Ben...

161
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,500
Why are you looking at me like that?
Are you going to hurt me?

162
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,700
I would protect you
from anyone who tried to hurt you.

163
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,200
Your voice makes life justifiable.
I'm just trying to give you money.

164
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,800
- What did you buy it for?
- $35,000.

165
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,700
But that was a few years ago.
I could probably get $40,000.

166
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not really a financial issue,
Mr. Siegel. Ben...

167
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,300
One, two, three, four...

168
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
That's $50,000. Is that enough?

169
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:08,200
This should be a pleasurable day
for the both of us. Here's $60,000.

170
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,100
It makes me sick inside when I don't
bring pleasure to someone I admire.

171
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,400
Doesn't this bring you pleasure?
Why don't I see you smiling?

172
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,100
- You spend money like crazy.
- So? It's only dirty paper.

173
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,000
- You'll only be here for four days.
- Maybe I'll stay a little longer.

174
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,500
- I've got to get to Jack Dragna's.
- I'll drive you.

175
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,200
No, this is business.

176
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,600
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

177
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,700
- Louie.
- What the hell is this?

178
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm looking for Jack Dragna.
I'm Ben Siegel.

179
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm Lou, Jack's brother.
I'll tell Jack you're here.

180
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,700
He'll just be a few seconds.
Jack's finishing eating.

181
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,500
We run a smooth little operation.
With all due respect to Lansky, -

182
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,200
- Luciano, Joey A., and whoever
the fuck else you represent, -

183
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,500
- I suggest you spend your time here
looking for broads.

184
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,000
We've got the finest in the world.
I understand that's what you like.

185
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I can help you out
with phone numbers.

186
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,600
But if you want to do business,
I'm completely disinterested.

187
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,700
"Uninterested".
Disinterested means impartial.

188
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,600
You've got two alternatives:
You and your guys can work for us.

189
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,500
Your little operation
will then be a big operation.

190
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,300
20 betting parlours, not three.
Owning your own wire service.

191
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,000
It means taking risks.
Meyer, Charlie and I, we take 75%.

192
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,100
You keep 25%, but that's got to be
three times more than you make now.

193
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,300
- What's the second alternative?
- The second alternative...

194
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,600
The second alternative is here.

195
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,400
- Squeeze the trigger and kill me.
- Kill you, that's an alternative?

196
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,500
- You've an unusual sense of humour.
- What they say about you is true.

197
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,500
You're out of your fucking mind.

198
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,000
Take another five seconds
to make your selection.

199
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,200
I guess that means you're working
for us. May I have my gun back?

200
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's get started. Time is vicious
when taken for granted.

201
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,500
Bugsy, if we break off this thing
with Transcontinental...

202
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,100
I'll assume you didn't know
that no one calls me that.

203
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,900
- Very nice meeting you, Jack.
- The fucking guy's crazy.

204
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,900
- Should I shoot him in the back?
- Lansky and Luciano would flip.

205
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Play along.
Sooner or later he'll blow his lid.

206
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,500
When we get him,
nobody will give a fuck.

207
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,400
- Hello?
- Virginia, it's Ben...

208
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,400
Meyer, I know we said 12 days.
Things got a little complicated.

209
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,500
Was that good?
You're from "The Herald", right?

210
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,800
See that they run that, and not one
of those sinister mugshots.

211
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,400
- I'll try my best.
- I'd really appreciate it.

212
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,200
- May I have the next dance?
- Charmed. Have you met Mr. Siegel?

213
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,200
- I've been admiring his movements.
- My husband. Count Di Frasso.

214
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm surrounded by titles.
How can I pick one up?

215
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,600
Darling, get him a title.
Make him a duke.

216
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Why not?

217
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,800
- Are you ready to come to Italy?
- Italy! I'll get my parachute.

218
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,300
That's wonderful.

219
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,500
You know who one of the count's
best friends is?

220
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,500
Mussolini.

221
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,300
No... That clown knows Mussolini?

222
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:13,900
Do they play golf together?
Tell jokes about the gas chambers?

223
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,700
- I stay out of politics.
- Politics? This is war.

224
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,900
He's Hitler's partner, and this
effete count pals around with him?

225
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,000
Don't get worked up over something
you can't do anything about.

226
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,800
This is Hollywood.

227
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,900
Telephone call from Mr. Dragna.
I've placed a phone at your table.

228
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,100
Have you met our number-one
crime fighter James McWilde?

229
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,100
- He's up for re-election as D.A.
- I wish I could contribute.

230
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,300
You can contact Donald Mitchell.
He handles all the money.

231
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Have him call me in the morning.

232
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,500
If you'll excuse me, I see about
six women that need to talk to me.

233
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,400
Mr. McWilde, as a man of the world,
what do you make -

234
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
- of all these friends of Mussolini
flitting around America?

235
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,900
Are you talking about spies?

236
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,900
Come Jim, the senator
would like a word with you.

237
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,300
- Keep me posted on that.
- I will, we've got to do something.

238
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,000
See the redhead?

239
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,300
Put it in her hand.

240
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,900
What is it?

241
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:55,600
<i>This cocksucker Mickey Cohen
robbed our gambling joint of $56,000.</i>

242
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,600
<i>I tell you, this time
I'm going to get him.</i>

243
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,700
I'll see you.

244
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,900
- How do you know it was Cohen?
- He had a mask on, but the voice.

245
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,900
He robbed five guys of $56,000
and got away scot-free?

246
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,100
- He took us by surprise.
- It certainly seems like it.

247
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,700
- He'll be dead within 24 hours.
- No, I want to talk to him.

248
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,600
- You say 56,000?
- The exact figure was 56,143.

249
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,500
<i>Mussolini and Hitler
must be stopped.</i>

250
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,200
Hello...
Hi, honey.

251
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,700
Maybe you should stop thinking about
when I'm coming back to Scarsdale.

252
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,100
Start thinking about when you
and the girls will come out here.

253
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,800
As soon as possible.

254
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,600
But is this is the right time
to take the kids out of school?

255
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,700
Maybe we should play it by ear
and see what happens.

256
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,100
We don't have
to settle everything now.

257
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,200
All right, we'll see each other
before you know it.

258
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,700
Right? I love you too, Esta.
Goodnight.

259
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,400
Ronald, turn off the projector!

260
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,300
Ronald? Where are you?

261
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,100
- Am I coming at a bad time?
- Not at all. Come on in.

262
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't want to interrupt
your pantomime.

263
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,200
What are you watching?

264
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:01,900
A newsreel, but it's over.
Why don't you come on in?

265
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,400
- Too fast with the ring?
- Nothing's too fast that fits.

266
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Do you always carry around
a spare ring?

267
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,500
I figured I'd run into you.
Would you ever have called me?

268
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,700
I was planning to wait a while.

269
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,600
About ten years.

270
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,600
Why?

271
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,400
If all we're going to do is bring
each other misery and torment...

272
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,100
Why would we
bring each other misery and torment?

273
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:49,300
We both want what we want whenever
we want it, and we want everything.

274
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,900
- That doesn't sound too promising.
- That's what I'm saying.

275
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:03,100
- Then why did you come?
- Well, it wasn't caution.

276
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,300
- What about Joey A.?
- Does he bother you?

277
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Is it your conscience or are you
worried about your business?

278
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,300
I haven't thought it through
that clearly.

279
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,600
If he knew I were here, he'd only
be thinking about who to kill first.

280
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,000
Do you want to kiss me
as much as I want to kiss you?

281
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,800
How do you know
I want to kiss you at all?

282
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,700
I really don't think we should
go through with this, do you?

283
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,500
Is that yes or no?

284
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Both.

285
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,800
- You pack quite a punch.
- That was a slap.

286
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,100
If I'd punched you, you'd be
stretched out across the floor.

287
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,400
You're right about everything.
Right about the misery and torment.

288
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm sure you're right
about what you want.

289
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,100
Do you always talk this much
before you do it?

290
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,400
I only talk this much
before I'm gonna kill someone.

291
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,600
Hey, Georgie boy.
Did you find Mickey Cohen yet?

292
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,600
Biltmore Health Club at one o'clock.
We meet him there.

293
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,400
Pick me up at noon. Good.

294
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,500
You still think we'll only bring
each other misery and torment?

295
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,400
With a few distractions in between.

296
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,100
You call what we've been doing
distractions?

297
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:13,100
- Thank you, the feeling's mutual.
- Good, that's the way I like it.

298
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,200
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

299
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,500
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

300
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,100
- What time is it?
- One thirty.

301
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,600
The little schmuck
is half an hour late.

302
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,400
Who's a little schmuck?
Who are you referring to?

303
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,800
- You'd better show me some respect.
- You've got it backwards.

304
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,700
Unless your idea of showing
a man respect is to rob him.

305
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,500
Who said I robbed?
Everything I've got is mine.

306
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:58,600
- Yes, you stole it from me.
- What's mine is mine.

307
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:04,300
I understand from Jack Dragna
you stole 56,000 and change.

308
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,600
The lying fat fuck!
It was 42, not 56.

309
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,700
- I thought you didn't steal it.
- If I had, it would have been 42.

310
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,200
If I were you, I'd give that money
back by seven o'clock tonight.

311
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Fuck you!
Look at me, fuck you!

312
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,200
If I was you, I'd shut
my fucking mouth and watch my step.

313
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,000
- I could blow you away.
- Aren't we in a public place?

314
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,600
We'd both be better off
if you'd tone down your rhetoric.

315
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,700
We'd both be better off if
I never saw your fucking face again.

316
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,200
- Don't laugh, this guy's deranged.
- Go get him back. Hurry up.

317
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,300
Jack... it's Ben.

318
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,900
The Cohen thing is under control.
Be at my house at 7:30 tonight.

319
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,400
How do you remember
all the fucking lines from a movie?

320
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,900
Make it quick, will you?
I've got a hot date waiting for me.

321
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,500
<i>I bet you do have
a hot date waiting for you.</i>

322
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,700
- Are you making fun of me?
- You must have women lined up.

323
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,300
When I go out with a broad,
you can bet she'll be a star.

324
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,900
Betty Grable or Ava Gardner.
I don't go for them tarty broads.

325
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,900
- What tarty broads?
- That Shirley, Luciano's piece.

326
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:58,700
That nutty broad Joey A. Goes out
with, Victoria Hill. That blonde...

327
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,200
<i>Virginia Hill.
Why would you call her a tart?</i>

328
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,000
That's what she is. Joe Epstein,
the drummer Gene Krupa, -

329
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:14,900
- the bullfighter from Mexico...
This conversation is beneath me.

330
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm expanding,
and if I'm going to expand, -

331
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,300
- should I expand with guys who got
taken, or the one who took them?

332
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,700
- What's in it for me?
- Money. $5,000 a week.

333
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,500
- Does that include a blow job?
- Watch your mouth, he'll plug you.

334
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,200
He can't. He needs me.
Ain't you been listening?

335
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,000
You're too busy learning lines from
those fairy acting jobs you do. Ten.

336
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,000
Okay, but I want the $42,000 you
stole back by seven o'clock tonight.

337
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,500
I put up my life and my liberty
on that fucking score.

338
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,000
20. I wouldn't kick back
the whole 42 for my mother.

339
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,300
A penny less, we've got no deal.

340
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,700
- Krupa and a bullfighter?
- It ain't exactly confidential.

341
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,100
Krupa I know about...
and a couple of bullfighters.

342
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,800
- A couple of bullfighters?
- That's what I've heard.

343
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,800
She is who she is.
What man ever changed a woman?

344
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,800
I don't go by what other men have
done. I believe in fresh starts.

345
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,600
Without them you and me would have
been history before we were 19.

346
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,100
I hope you like scampi
served on a bed of soft brown rice.

347
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Rimmed by carrots and peas.

348
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,800
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

349
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,900
Come on, eat.
It'll make you big and strong.

350
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,500
What do you think of bullfighting?

351
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,600
- It's a while since I tried it.
- What are your memories?

352
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,800
- Dangerous... and fun.
- What about drums?

353
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:30,500
- What about drums? I'm a singer.
- You ever sing with a drummer?

354
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,700
I've sung with all kinds of
musicians. Your dinner's going cold.

355
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,700
Did you think I was a virgin?

356
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,000
I just thought maybe there
was somebody you hadn't fucked.

357
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,700
That's not pleasant.

358
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,300
Listen, we've both fucked around.
You want to trade stories, fine.

359
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,900
We can also put the past behind us,
but don't play sulky little games.

360
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,400
If what we share isn't good enough,
then we should call it quits now.

361
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,400
- What'll it be?
- How about iodine?

362
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,300
You need soap and water. And wash
out your mouth, too. I'm going home.

363
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,800
Wait. Come here.

364
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,100
Let go of me.
I'm not staying here.

365
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,000
Get your hands off me, damn it!

366
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,800
Get off me.
I'm never coming back.

367
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,300
Benny.

368
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,400
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

369
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,000
- 42,000 on the nose.
- Thank you very much.

370
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,500
This is Virginia Hill.
Mickey Cohen.

371
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,900
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
I've heard a lot about you.

372
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,000
- Can I come in?
- Could I take a rain check?

373
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,100
Not under the circumstances.
What happened to your head?

374
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,900
A vicious insect.
I'll see you in the morning.

375
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,700
Hey, gumba, kiss my tukus!

376
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,300
Fucking Jew prick.

377
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,100
- Did you ever meet Jack Dragna?
- No.

378
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:44,600
I've got to speak to him alone.
Wait for me, please.

379
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,200
In there.

380
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:06,100
- The cocksucker dished it back.
- Every cent.

381
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,800
I'll be a son of a bitch.
How did you get him to go along?

382
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,800
He brought me the money
and I gave him a job.

383
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
He'll be running my operation.

384
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,700
- That's my job.
- No, you work for him now.

385
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:30,200
- I'm missing something.
- Yeah, about $ 14,000 and change.

386
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,200
The 14,000 you stole from us,
after the 42 that Mickey took.

387
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,800
- Wait a minute...
- Do you want to fuck me?

388
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:48,800
- Of course not.
- You're sure? Do you wanna rape me?

389
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,100
- This is crazy.
- Answer me. Do not lie to me.

390
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,600
You stole from me.
Stealing is a form of rape.

391
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,200
Did you think you could get away
with stealing from me?

392
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,600
From Meyer Lansky,
Charlie Luciano and me?

393
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,900
That you could rape us
and humiliate us?

394
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,300
Did you think you could
get away with that? Don't lie!

395
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,200
Do not lie to me!

396
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,800
So you raped us even though
you thought we would catch you?

397
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,100
- It wasn't like that.
- What was it like? Answer me!

398
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,000
Did you think
you could get away with it or not?

399
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,400
- Did you?
- I won't ever do it again.

400
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,700
You won't do it again.
How do you know I won't kill you?

401
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,700
I'm begging you, Ben. Don't.

402
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,900
Do you want to kill me?
You want another chance?

403
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,600
I'll tell you something: You can't.
No one can. I can't kill me.

404
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,800
See. Now, try it.
Come on, give it to me.

405
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,900
What is it? Are you afraid to die?
Crawl.

406
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:16,400
Now, bark like the dog that you wish
you were decent enough to be.

407
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,400
Bark! Crawl and bark.

408
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,300
More, let me hear that bark.

409
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes, that's good. More!

410
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,300
Oink like the treacherous,
devious pig that you are.

411
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,000
Come on, get around there.

412
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Oink now!

413
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,500
Get up!

414
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,800
Now look me in the eye.

415
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,500
Go home, get the money you stole
and bring it to me.

416
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:17,000
- This goes back in the safe.
- Thanks, you can count on me.

417
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,200
We'll see. Everybody needs
a fresh start once in a while.

418
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,100
Get out.

419
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,800
Are we going to eat?

420
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,300
Who was the Countess Di Frasso?

421
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:03,000
Who is she? She's the wife
of Count Di Frasso.

422
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,000
- I danced with her at Ciro's.
- I know you danced with her.

423
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:15,800
The countess's husband, the count,
is a very good friend of Mussolini.

424
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:22,700
- He's Mussolini's friend.
- I got it. So what?

425
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:28,600
Hitler and Mussolini are destroying
the world. I can stop Mussolini.

426
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,700
What do you mean?
Kill Mussolini?

427
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,400
You are going to kill Mussolini
in the middle of a war?

428
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,200
That is the most ludicrous excuse
I've ever heard.

429
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,300
If you want to fuck some countess,
at least have the guts to say it.

430
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:55,300
- I'm hatching a secret plan.
- You're full of secrets.

431
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,700
- Nothing's out in the open.
- Like what?

432
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:03,500
Me.
You're afraid of being seen with me.

433
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,700
You told me you don't
keep any secrets from Esta.

434
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,100
- That's different.
- I don't want to be a secret.

435
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,400
- Give me a chance.
- You've had your chance.

436
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,800
- We never go anywhere.
- All right, we'll go everywhere.

437
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:29,100
Give me a chance. Everybody
deserves a fresh start once in a while.

438
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,100
- Come on, sugar.
- I can't. You don't understand.

439
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:50,000
I can't...
I'm really much too nervous.

440
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,500
- Come on.
- I thought I could, but I can't.

441
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,900
- You can't what?
- Now I've seen the plane, I can't.

442
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,700
I never have... been on a plane.

443
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,300
- You haven't? One second...
- I can't control what you do.

444
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,700
I can't be with you every second.
Go without me.

445
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:19,500
- We're gonna run out of gas.
- The rules of aerodynamics...

446
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,900
It makes no difference.
I'm not going on the plane.

447
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,200
Ben, let's go.

448
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,600
Time is money.

449
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,500
- This is boring. I have to pee.
- If we'd flown, we'd be there now.

450
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:04,400
- I don't even know why I came.
- Why did I come?

451
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,100
You can't run an operation
in Nevada and never go there.

452
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,600
We drove five and a half hours
for this canker sore?

453
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,300
There's a steady profit
coming out of this joint.

454
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,600
Customers have nowhere else to go.

455
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,100
This is a dump.
You should get rid of it.

456
00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:00,700
- The upkeep is almost zero.
- Who'd have thought it?

457
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:08,800
- Looks don't matter, money does.
- Looks matter. It should be burnt.

458
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,500
- I wouldn't go that far, Victoria.
- What? Call her Virginia.

459
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:20,100
- I called her Virginia.
- You called me Victoria.

460
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:26,300
- I called you Victoria?
- It's Virginia. Who do I talk to?

461
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,100
I have no need
to hear what you have to say.

462
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,300
- Who took whose advice?
- Don't embarrass me like that.

463
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,200
- I was right.
- The place should have stayed open.

464
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,800
- Why did you close it?
- Because it was a canker sore.

465
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,600
- But I'm not your fucking puppet.
- You need to be told what to do.

466
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,500
Or maybe you want to continue
dodging your way through two lives.

467
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:01,000
Checking at home in Scarsdale
whenever you get too lonely.

468
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,400
Or maybe you're getting old.

469
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:09,100
That's it. I've taken enough shit
from you, and it's gonna stop now.

470
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,300
- Hot air in a hot desert.
- It's gonna stop right now.

471
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,400
Don't talk to me about Scarsdale,
it's none of your business.

472
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:27,600
Talking to me about Scarsdale...
Who the fuck do you think you are?

473
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,600
- What is he doing?
- Looking for a place to pee.

474
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:17,500
I got it! I had this vision.
Like a religious epiphany.

475
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:23,200
- Are you talking about God?
- It's the best idea I ever had.

476
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,800
Yeah, well I just had
the greatest idea I ever had.

477
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,700
- Isn't she magnificent?
- Just what I've been looking for.

478
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,000
A broad to leave me in the desert,
to die and be eaten by vultures.

479
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,700
You'll remember this day.

480
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,800
Benjy, what would we do in Italy
with all the bullets flying around?

481
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,500
What we would do?
We would meet Mussolini.

482
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,200
You are outrageous.
That's what I love about you.

483
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:43,100
<i>- Why do you want to meet the Duce?
- My friends could use his help.</i>

484
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:50,000
Could your husband arrange that,
or is his reputation exaggerated?

485
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,500
My husband could get you this close
to Mussolini any time he wishes.

486
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,600
And he will wish to do
whatever I say.

487
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,600
You know what my intuition
tells me about you?

488
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,600
That you always get
whatever you want.

489
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,500
Don't deny it.
I find your confidence irresistible.

490
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm sucked in by it. Helpless,
if you must know the truth.

491
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:44,000
We have a few wrinkles to iron out,
but my secret plan is going through.

492
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,500
I'm going to New York tomorrow,
so this is hello and goodbye.

493
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,000
I've got some problems in New York.

494
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,300
Charlie's been arrested.
Harry Greenberg, my old friend...

495
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:04,200
- I think he testified against him.
- Am I supposed to be interested?

496
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,800
What does your friend do,
sticks knives into animals?

497
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:12,900
He's the guitarist.
Flamenco-Flamingo.

498
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,700
You're not actually going
to spend the night with this creep?

499
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,300
What I do with my time and my body
is my business.

500
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,400
I demand satisfaction.

501
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Go back to your countess.
I hope she gives you syphilis.

502
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,100
- I'm asking Esta for a divorce.
- You'd better get to a phone.

503
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,300
- Good luck.
- Virginia...

504
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,000
I was wearing a blue silk shirt?
I don't even own one.

505
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,200
"Brandishing a. 45 menacingly".

506
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,000
What an outrageous fabrication.
It wasn't a. 45, it was a. 38.

507
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:01,200
I was not brandishing it.
I was concealing it subtly.

508
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,400
What kind of people write this?

509
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,500
I agree with you 100%.
They've got no morals, those people.

510
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:19,200
What we heard is true. Charlie's in
jaiI because of this stool-pigeon.

511
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:27,100
You know this Harry Greenberg?
You don't?

512
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,600
I know him.

513
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:35,500
Mickey, I'm getting a divorce.
That's why I'm making this trip.

514
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,700
- Definitely?
- Definitely.

515
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,800
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Why?

516
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,300
To see a family break up like that.
What's got to be has got to be.

517
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,000
- I know what you're doing.
- Don't come one step closer.

518
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,700
You're writing "Happy Birthday,
Millicent" on my cake.

519
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,800
Get out of here...
Set the table.

520
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,300
- Where are the presents?
- With the potatoes.

521
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,700
Honey, move the thing in the middle.

522
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,300
- I hope we're not disturbing you?
- It's Millicent's birthday party.

523
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:55,200
- There's a matter we must discuss.
- Good, come on in.

524
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Make yourselves at home.
I'll be right with you.

525
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:09,300
Guess who that is. Meyer, Joey A.,
Frank, Gus, Vito and Moe.

526
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,800
- This night was for ourselves.
- I planned a meet tomorrow, but...

527
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:21,700
- It's Millicent's birthday.
- They've got a business problem.

528
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,200
Finish the cake, put the candles on,
I'll be right back.

529
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:34,400
I have to tell you I got rid of
that seedy canker sore in Vegas.

530
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,300
You had no right
to give that casino up.

531
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,200
- Casino? It was an outhouse.
- You should have consulted us.

532
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,300
- That's the arrangement we've got.
- I have no arrangement with you.

533
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,600
But don't worry, I'll tell you
what I'm to build in its place.

534
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:58,600
You'll understand for the first time
what the word transcendent means.

535
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,500
Meyer... I have found the answer
to the dreams of America.

536
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,200
You want to be
a little more specific?

537
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,800
The Flamingo.

538
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,900
- People dream about sex and money.
- Are you building a whorehouse?

539
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:24,300
A hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.
A place where gambling is allowed.

540
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:29,200
The whole territory is wide open.
A palace, an oasis, a city.

541
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:35,500
When the Hoover Dam is finished,
electrical power will be available.

542
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,900
The Hoover Dam and fucking
are connected how?

543
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Air-conditioning.
The wave of the future.

544
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,500
Every room will be 72 degrees
at all times.

545
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,300
We'll put Monte Carlo to shame.

546
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,600
Wall-to-wall carpeting,
Italian marble, stables.

547
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,600
A train from L.A. to Vegas.

548
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,800
Planes back and forth.
We'll have our own airport!

549
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,100
It's a good place to trap people in
to take their money.

550
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:11,000
- Is that what you're getting at?
- Much more.

551
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,200
I've got to get that.

552
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,200
I got it!

553
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,500
Mickey, have you got someone
across the street?

554
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,700
Call Warner Brothers, call Ciro's.
Call me if anybody's seen her.

555
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:30,400
No, not five minutes. One minute.

556
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,600
Sit tight, honey.
Let me just see how they're doing.

557
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:45,400
Oh, that looks great.
Your mother's a real artist.

558
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,700
I've got these guys going
on this thing.

559
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,200
The children don't have the patience
that some adults do.

560
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,800
You finish the candles in here
and I'll finish up out there.

561
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,900
Don't move, birthday girl.

562
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:09,200
I don't understand this desert idea.
Let's concentrate on Cuba.

563
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,700
There's legalized gambling next to
Florida. It's like another state.

564
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:19,200
It's not another state. A foreign
country can always throw you out.

565
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,700
<i>Nevada is another state
and it's open.</i>

566
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:29,800
If we follow the hotel with schools,
and churches and synagogues, -

567
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,900
- we'll be in charge before
you know it... of the whole state!

568
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,600
- We'll have a stake in the country.
- You planning to run for president?

569
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:47,000
We can help to choose the president
if we control a state.

570
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,200
Where do you think the money
for this is going to come from?

571
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,200
I'll be working for the partners,
so the money should come from them.

572
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,100
- Them meaning you.
- How much are we talking about?

573
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:05,500
- One million dollars.
- What about the publicity?

574
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,000
Ben's famous in California.

575
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:13,400
Famous is good for Clark Gable,
but for you it's not good.

576
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,500
Our gambling will be legitimate.

577
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,600
Meyer, we've known each other
since we were too young to fuck.

578
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,800
When did I ever ask you to leap
ahead with something on faith?

579
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,300
Never, but I'm asking you now.
Do this.

580
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:42,500
You've got 65 guys on the payroll
and nobody can find Virginia?

581
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:49,200
I cannot function effectively
when I'm in a state of ignorance.

582
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,500
Find her.

583
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:00,000
Hold the fort. I'm nearly finished.
What's the matter?

584
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,300
I thought you came home
for my birthday.

585
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:08,600
We'll celebrate your birthday.
I'll just finish this meeting...

586
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,900
I don't want to hear you!

587
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,100
We'll just be a minute...
Come on, honey.

588
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,300
Millicent, open the door.
I just want to say one thing.

589
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,900
Barbara, are you in there, too?

590
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,900
Come on down.
I'm lighting the candles.

591
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,200
Come on down,
I'm lighting the candles.

592
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,300
The party got a little
out of control, but I fixed it.

593
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:49,600
With Charlie in jaiI, I'll have to
confer with him on money decisions.

594
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:55,200
But pending his approval, I'm happy
to say you've got yourself a deal.

595
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,800
- Good. Great.
- When will you get started?

596
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,800
When I get back from Italy,
however long that takes.

597
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,800
- However long what takes?
- The assassination of Mussolini.

598
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,100
Who's gonna assassinate Mussolini?

599
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,700
Come here. Look, don't fuck this up
by trying to be funny.

600
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:26,200
Mussolini and Hitler are trying
to knock off every Jew on earth.

601
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:32,200
- I can stop Mussolini.
- Leave it to the Allied Forces.

602
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:38,300
The Allied Forces
don't have the access I have.

603
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:44,700
One of Mussolini's best friends.
His wife has the hots for me.

604
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,900
If she gets me close to Mussolini,
I'll blow him halfway to Siberia.

605
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,600
Listen to me very carefully.
Don't ever repeat what you've said.

606
01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:00,900
- Right, it's a secret.
- There's a different reason.

607
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:05,500
At best, any normal person
that you say it to -

608
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,800
- will never take anything you say
seriously again.

609
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,600
Sure, but Mussolini is a dead man.
I'll be with you in a minute.

610
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,500
I'm going to light the candles.
I'm lighting the candles.

611
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:25,800
- Let's see what Meyer wants.
- What do you want to eat?

612
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,200
Eat? We came here to do business.

613
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:42,000
Millicent? I lit the candles.

614
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,800
- Have we finished our business?
- Sure, we shouldn't have barged in.

615
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:53,500
Enjoy the party for Millicent.
It sounds good.

616
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:58,200
- Take care, Ben.
- Thanks for coming by.

617
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,600
Joey...
Listen, I'm sorry about Virginia.

618
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,400
If you want to take a punch at me,
take a punch at me.

619
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:20,100
We're even now. I'm sorry,
I know you were in love with her.

620
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:25,500
Are you kidding me? I'd never
let myself fall for a slut like her.

621
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,300
Your mouth is bleeding.

622
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,000
I tripped and hit the table.
It's nothing.

623
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,000
I don't think
we can go on like this, Ben.

624
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,600
- Like what?
- Should we get a divorce?

625
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,300
Some friends just dropped by at the
wrong time. Everything's fine now.

626
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,700
Sit down.

627
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:43,600
I'm going to say goodnight
to the girls.

628
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,300
- Miss me?
- Depends.

629
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,200
You're looking very smug.
Did you ask her for a divorce?

630
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:32,100
We've got to drink a toast.
I've got the whole thing worked out.

631
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:37,400
I've sold them on the idea.
We'll drink a toast to our destiny.

632
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,100
- Did you ask her for a divorce?
- Not in so many words.

633
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:50,600
Do me a favour, would you? Finish
your drink and get out of here.

634
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,100
You don't understand.
I'm laying the groundwork.

635
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:03,000
Are you having a good time?
Do you like that robe?

636
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:10,900
You fucking lunatic!
Look what you've done.

637
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,300
- Baby, are you hurt?
- You're lucky you're alive.

638
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:20,000
I'll give you three minutes
to get the hell out of here.

639
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:24,300
- He's my brother, you asshole!
- Do you expect me to fall for that?

640
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:30,500
I don't care. Just don't ever come
around here bothering us anymore!

641
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:35,800
- Us?
- Leave him alone! He's my brother.

642
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,100
Would you show me
some form of identification?

643
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:46,900
- Do you have any?
- In my pants, in the guests' room.

644
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,900
He does very unexpected things.

645
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,500
Are you hurt? Are you cut?
Any glass wedged anywhere?

646
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,300
You're right. You're Chick.
You're her brother.

647
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,700
Why didn't you tell me it was Chick?

648
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,500
- I'm gonna buy you a Cadillac.
- A Cadillac?

649
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,600
Yes, a red one.
How about a convertible?

650
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:22,600
- Don't sell out so cheap.
- I've always wanted a Cadillac.

651
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,100
We're gonna take a trip
in Chick's red Cadillac.

652
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:30,200
- You're gonna take a trip.
- To our destiny. Las Vegas!

653
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:34,800
You couldn't drag me to that
sand-hole, rat-trap with a fish net.

654
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,200
We're going to build
a Garden of Eden.

655
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,100
A hotel, but not a hotel.
An oasis with a casino.

656
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,300
It's legal. It's Nevada.

657
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,300
Palm trees and pools. Rose gardens
more beautiful than Versailles.

658
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:56,700
We're going to design them.
We'll have famous entertainers.

659
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:02,000
Jolson, Cantor, Durante,
Cooper, Cary, Victor Mature.

660
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:06,600
All of them, honey.
We'll have Dana Andrews.

661
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,600
It'll be the most spectacular place
they've ever been invited to.

662
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:16,800
You'll own five and three quarter
per cent of it all... gross.

663
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
We'll be the greatest hosts in the
West, and we'll name it after you.

664
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,700
We're gonna call it The Flamingo.

665
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,900
I've brought trouble to every man
who ever went on the line for me.

666
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:39,100
Good. That's what they get
for trying to steal my girl.

667
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,200
If you don't make it different
and new, then don't make it at all.

668
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,200
Look at this structure.

669
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:04,300
There's a curved effect within
traditional linear principles.

670
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,100
- Sensational, David.
- Thank you.

671
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:12,400
Where did you find this guy?
He's terrific.

672
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,800
It looks gorgeous to me.
Very European. Very French.

673
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,200
You could sell these objects
in a museum.

674
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,600
- This stuff is very hard to draw.
- The pool bothers me.

675
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:31,200
- What's wrong with it?
- There isn't enough sun.

676
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,600
Your assistant should pay attention.

677
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:41,400
If we slid the pool down here,
we'd get the sun all day.

678
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,600
- Am I right?
- David?

679
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,700
That would change the relation
of the pool to the casino.

680
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:54,400
If we move the pool,
will the sun hit the pool all day?

681
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,900
- Yes, it will.
- Move the pool.

682
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:03,300
Ben, we've inflated the budget
to two million now.

683
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:08,800
- No problem.
- I'll give Meyer a call.

684
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,600
Mussolini Murdered
Italians Butcher Brutal Dictator

685
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,500
- That's a lot of extra money.
- I cannot believe he's dead.

686
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:29,100
You keep saying that. He was dead
the first time you read the paper.

687
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,700
I was moments away
from carrying out my plan.

688
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:40,000
Look how they got him, you couldn't
have done a better job yourself.

689
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,400
I couldn't have?
Come here.

690
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,500
What do you really think
of this David, the architect?

691
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,500
There's something about him I don't
like. What's with this red tie?

692
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,700
Hey, he's an architect.

693
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:03,700
Keep an eye on him. What's
his history? How did we get him?

694
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:08,700
- Don't do this to yourself.
- I've got to know the truth.

695
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:13,500
Who ever knows what's going on
in the mind of any broad?

696
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:19,000
What are you looking at?
You're looking at Virginia.

697
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,100
- She was talking.
- What were you thinking?

698
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:29,000
Should you trust a dame
with your chequebook?

699
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,400
I've never known a broad
I could trust.

700
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:38,200
I'm not trusting a broad,
I'm trusting Virginia.

701
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,400
Meyer would like to talk to you.

702
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:57,900
Where are you, Miami? A deportation
party for Charlie, that's horrible.

703
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:03,600
First they lock him up, now they
kick him out of the country.

704
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,600
I tell you,
never trust the prosecutors.

705
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,600
Bugsy Siegel lives here.

706
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,500
- Don't ever call him that.
- Everyone calls him that.

707
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:20,300
Not to his face.
You can bet your life on that.

708
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:26,500
I do feel responsible for Harry.
I know I brought him in.

709
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,900
Harry's not a full deck.

710
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,800
But we both thought he was okay
for the jobs we gave him.

711
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,700
When you find him, you'll have to do
what you have to do.

712
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,100
What overages?

713
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:48,200
Did they put a price on
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, -

714
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,800
- or Shakespeare's "Macbeth"?
If it costs more, it costs more.

715
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:59,300
No problem.
I'll see you in New York.

716
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:03,600
- Bloodless bureaucrats!
- Harry Greenberg is here.

717
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,300
- Where?
- In the hallway.

718
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,500
- Hi, Harry.
- Ben, you're a sight for sore eyes.

719
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:29,000
I hope you don't mind,
I had no place else to go.

720
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,700
- You did the right thing. Tired?
- Yeah, I'm tired.

721
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:40,700
We have an extra bedroom.
Why don't you take a nap?

722
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:46,200
We'll talk when you wake up.
It's the first one on the left.

723
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,900
- I thought I was dreaming.
- I always think I'm dreaming.

724
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:25,400
Am I dreaming or am I really
out here in Hollywood with you?

725
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:32,400
- You're here, Harry.
- Anywhere else and I'd be dead.

726
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,900
I screwed up, Ben.
I'm so stupid.

727
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,500
I never wanted to hurt anyone,
except those you told me to hurt.

728
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,400
- You talked.
- I talked.

729
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:00,600
What do you want me to do for you?

730
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,300
I thought I could work for you
out here incognito.

731
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:12,100
It's tough
to be incognito in Hollywood.

732
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:16,700
That's true. It was an idea.
A bad idea.

733
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,600
What should I do?

734
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,000
- You'd better take a drive with me.
- I like driving at night.

735
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,100
Especially if someone else drives.

736
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,700
I always loved that,
ever since I was a little kid.

737
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:45,900
I wish you hadn't done
what you did, Harry.

738
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:55,000
Virginia, this is Harry Greenberg.
He's a very old friend of mine.

739
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,600
Joey A.'s girl. We met
a couple of years ago at the Copa.

740
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,300
- We're taking a drive together.
- I'll come with you.

741
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:08,100
- Stay here. I won't be long.
- I'd rather come along.

742
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:11,000
I'd rather you didn't.

743
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:16,100
I thought you said you wanted
to spend all your time with me.

744
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:21,400
- Let us take a drive alone.
- Take your whole life alone.

745
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,900
Fine, come along.

746
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,300
I've got to get my coat and bag.

747
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,300
You seen much of Joey recently?

748
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,400
Not for quite a while.

749
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,200
I haven't seen any of the guys
since I messed up.

750
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:50,900
Joey was a real sharp dresser.
Nice head of wavy hair.

751
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,500
- Virginia's going to be my wife.
- Congratulations.

752
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:02,200
- What happened to Esta?
- Nothing.

753
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,600
That's a relief.
I thought she died.

754
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:12,200
- What happened to her?
- We're getting a divorce.

755
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:18,300
- Esta doesn't know it yet.
- Always the same little digs.

756
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,400
Esta is a friend of mine.

757
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,500
She's a good person.
She's the mother of my daughters.

758
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:30,000
She's not a threat to you,
and I'm going to divorce her.

759
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,300
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

760
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:38,100
You two seem like a happy couple.
It's nice to see that.

761
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:05,500
I want you to wait here.
Don't argue with me about it.

762
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:03,700
What the hell's going on out there?
Ben!

763
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:29,100
What are you doing?
I told you to wait.

764
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,600
- Where's Harry?
- Back in the car.

765
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:37,900
What's the matter?
What happened?

766
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:09,800
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

767
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:14,200
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

768
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,100
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

769
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,700
20 dwarves, 20 dwarves...

770
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,800
This building's budget
was one million dollars.

771
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,400
It's climbing through the roof.
A hotel!

772
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:09,600
In the middle of the Mojave desert.
500 miles from the nearest toilet.

773
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:14,500
This movie star, Hollywood shit
of yours is no good.

774
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:19,900
We're a private group.
We don't want anybody looking at us.

775
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,800
It's bad enough already. This
Flamingo thing is out of control.

776
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,100
Are you finished?

777
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:32,100
The Flamingo is legitimate.
There won't be anything to hide.

778
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,800
The money that you and Meyer
put up was not a gift.

779
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,600
This was a favour
that I let you in on.

780
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:45,600
Fine. Then let us out now.
At cost, no profits.

781
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:49,500
Stop all this nonsense. This is
a farewell party for old friends.

782
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:55,100
You don't tell old friends a deal's
going to cost one million dollars -

783
01:29:55,300 --> 01:30:01,100
- and then come back and say
that it's two, or three, or four.

784
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,600
Not to Charlie Luciano.

785
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:09,000
We're talking different languages,
that's the problem.

786
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:14,000
Tell me one thing. What is the most
that this hotel could possibly cost?

787
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:20,900
- Three million.
- I only approved one, not three.

788
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:35,000
- I don't want in, but I am in.
- It doesn't matter. We're stuck.

789
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:39,100
We do what we have to do,
to make it work... within reason.

790
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,800
You call any of this reason?
It's disgusting.

791
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,900
If this costs over three million,
God won't be able to baiI you out.

792
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:53,200
- No problem.
- One more thing, Ben.

793
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:58,100
The broad... Why would you have
some broad handle our money?

794
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:06,500
Speak about Virginia with respect,
she's going to be my wife.

795
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,700
Congratulations. I'm sure
she'll make a terrific Mrs. Siegel.

796
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:16,200
I hope you know what you're doing.

797
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,400
Don't let Virginia
out of your sight.

798
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:32,000
If you have to take a nap, have
one of the other guys watch her.

799
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:37,400
One of the older guys.

800
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,100
Joey...

801
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:51,400
- Can I speak to you alone?
- What do you want? I'm busy.

802
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:55,600
It won't take a second.

803
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,600
Don't move, darling. I'll get rid
of this guy before you can blink.

804
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,700
Make it quick.

805
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:11,300
Considering the insulting word
you used to describe Virginia, -

806
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:16,200
- I think
that you owe both of us an apology.

807
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,600
Why don't you suck your apology
out of my dick?

808
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,800
Joey, what a thing to say!

809
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,500
Pull it out.

810
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:33,800
Are you embarrassed?
You want me to pull mine out first?

811
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,500
Take a look at this.

812
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:32,900
Can you hear me, Joey? You're
lucky I didn't drink a lot today.

813
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:36,700
Your apology's accepted.

814
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,500
- Are you chewing?
- I'm chewing.

815
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:02,500
Don't swallow anything
untiI you chew it well.

816
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:07,200
I was thinking that...
Could I have some more water?

817
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,600
I was thinking that...

818
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:16,400
- Anybody want anything else?
- You just said that.

819
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,800
Right... What was I saying?

820
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:25,300
You've been trying to say it
all night. Our plans for moving.

821
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,200
What I was thinking was that...

822
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,300
I was trying to figure out
what would be best for...

823
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,300
I'm going to be in Las Vegas.
It's nothing but a sand dune.

824
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:47,000
I'll be there with the workmen.
I don't know...

825
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:51,000
You could live
in the house in Los Angeles.

826
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,700
But I'm not going to be there.

827
01:34:54,800 --> 01:35:00,600
Maybe it would be best for you to
stay here where you feel at home.

828
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:06,300
And see you for a day or two
every couple of years?

829
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,800
Excuse me.

830
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:36,200
- I'm sorry.
- You've found someone, haven't you?

831
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,900
You want to be with her.
I want a divorce.

832
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,400
Is that what you want?

833
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:49,200
I want to take care
of you and the children.

834
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:53,700
You want a divorce, don't you?

835
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:04,000
Say it. Answer me.

836
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:12,200
You want a divorce, don't you?

837
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,200
You want a divorce. Say it.

838
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:21,400
I do.

839
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:33,400
Don't come out of this room
for a minute.

840
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:11,800
This is a spectacular sight.
It's breathtaking.

841
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:17,000
It's vast,
it's intimate, it's original.

842
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,000
- Where's the pool?
- Right through here.

843
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,400
Can't I see the pool
from the casino?

844
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:32,700
- You wanted the pool in the sun.
- I thought you'd be able to see it.

845
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:36,900
When you stand in the casino,
you must be able to see the pool.

846
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,500
The problem is
that this is a bearing wall.

847
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,600
- Get rid of it.
- It supports the whole structure.

848
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:48,100
- You understand?
- I've got the point.

849
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,500
I don't need you to parrot
everything this guy says.

850
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,000
Just get rid of the wall.

851
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:02,100
We can make it glass, but it'll
cost. I can put a header beam up.

852
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,700
A header beam! You saved the day.

853
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:11,000
The overages have pushed
the budget up. Virginia, what is it?

854
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,700
- 4 million.
- No problem.

855
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,400
- Do you understand our position?
- I'm going to do this right.

856
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,600
Who the hell are they?

857
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:46,300
- Bugsy Siegel, you're under arrest.
- I don't know anybody of that name.

858
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:50,000
Benjamin Siegel,
you're under arrest.

859
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:56,200
I have a court order directing me
to transport you across state lines.

860
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:59,000
- What's the charge?
- Homicide.

861
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,700
Is it true that Harry Greenberg
was your best friend?

862
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:09,900
- Are you guilty?
- Are you getting divorced?

863
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:15,700
Is it true Harry Greenberg was going
to testify against all your friends?

864
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,900
Bugsy, give us a statement.

865
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:24,400
Firstly, my name is Benjamin,
as in the Bible.

866
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,000
And second, I'll see you all when
the Flamingo opens on Christmas Day.

867
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:36,300
I'm Assistant D.A. Hartman.
I'm in charge of this case.

868
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,200
You can leave the prisoner with me.
This way, sir.

869
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,100
Don't let anybody else inside.

870
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:52,100
Tell me, was $30,000 towards
your campaign fund not enough?

871
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:57,300
- The walls are thin here.
- You've got no witnesses.

872
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:02,400
The taxi driver who dropped
Harry Greenberg off at your house.

873
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,000
You got a name?

874
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:10,800
I want it to accidentally
fall into the hands of Mickey Cohen.

875
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,500
- Fine, but nothing nasty.
- You don't have to warn me.

876
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:20,400
Considering the gravity
of the charges against you, -

877
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,600
- I order you held without bail.

878
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,600
Mickey, are you in Vegas?

879
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:40,300
Did you fix the cab driver problem?

880
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:47,700
My picture was in the "Examiner". It
makes me look like I've got no tan.

881
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:52,300
I look like a fucking marshmallow.

882
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,500
You're trying to make me feel good.
Tanned or not tanned?

883
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:01,100
- Tanned.
- Really?

884
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:07,700
Stay on top of Virginia.
I feel very isolated here.

885
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,700
All right, good.

886
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:38,700
- Things are starting to shape up.
- He wants to open at Christmas.

887
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:45,500
- He's absolutely determined.
- Ben is absolutely determined.

888
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:49,300
Meyer, it'll open on time.

889
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:54,100
You've changed a lot
since I first met you.

890
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,700
- You didn't say Meyer was there.
- I wanted to tell you in person.

891
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:26,300
- So he saw the Flamingo?
- He's worried about the cost.

892
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:30,400
- What else did he say?
- Nothing. He talked to Del Webb.

893
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:35,100
- Did he ask any specific questions?
- He saw the demolished wall.

894
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,100
- What about the header beam?
- He ducked under it.

895
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:47,000
It's low... too low,
unless you're under five foot six.

896
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,000
But it hasn't been fixed yet.

897
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,600
- What was his general attitude?
- Concern.

898
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,300
But he was very nice,
like he's always been.

899
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:05,000
- Always?
- As in the past.

900
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:09,700
- Did you know him in the past?
- Yes, through Joey.

901
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:13,000
- Did you fuck him?
- Sure.

902
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:17,800
- Did you fuck Meyer?
- Don't be disgusting. I meant Joey.

903
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,400
Is fucking Meyer any more
disgusting than fucking Joey?

904
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,500
Fucking Joey wasn't disgusting?
What is it with you and Joey?

905
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:37,700
You don't want to fuck Meyer,
you want to fuck Joey?

906
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:43,100
If they can't get it right, tell
them to start again from scratch.

907
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:48,500
I won't have a casino
that doesn't let me see the pool.

908
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:53,400
- Tear down the fucking casino.
- The cost is going haywire.

909
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,500
- Are you on their side now?
- Don't say that.

910
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:04,000
The hell with Meyer Lansky,
Las Vegas and the Flamingo!

911
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:12,700
I talked to Meyer
in the middle of a sand blizzard.

912
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:17,200
I tried to say things
that I thought you would say.

913
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:22,900
He even said I sounded like you.

914
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:30,800
I wish we were back at Coney Island
eating hot dogs at Nathan's.

915
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:48,000
You're gonna love Kansas.
I've got you a job as a cab driver.

916
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:54,600
That's where Dorothy's from,
in the "Wizard of Oz".

917
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,800
Don't send any postcards.

918
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,300
Extra!
Bugsy Siegel gets off scot-free.

919
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:09,100
Cary Grant, Gary Cooper
and Clark Gable.

920
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,900
This is the biggest
gala opening in history.

921
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,900
You are a prince of princes.

922
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:26,100
- See you back at the house.
- Any more bags, you carry yourself.

923
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:37,400
The Flamingo's gonna come in
at six million.

924
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:43,100
I'm on your side. Stop trying
to fool me and fool yourself.

925
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,300
You need three million.

926
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:54,600
If you can come up with two,
I can come up with one.

927
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,700
This is just between you and me.
Can you get it?

928
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:04,400
- No problem.
- Would you stop that and think?

929
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:08,600
The house in Scarsdale, the cars,
the stocks, the bonds...

930
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,000
That all belongs to Esta now,
correct?

931
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,600
- Absolutely.
- How can you get the money?

932
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:20,000
I'll sell my house
and everything in it.

933
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:27,400
Sounds like about $200,000.
Where's the other 1.8 million?

934
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:33,900
You always protected me
when we were kids.

935
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,700
But I can't protect you.

936
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:42,400
My shares. I own
a third of the hotel. I'll sell it.

937
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:46,900
But that's all you've got.
You'll end up with nothing.

938
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:52,300
The Flamingo will be there.
That's not nothing.

939
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,700
Add your two to this.

940
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:16,100
I miss you, Benny.

941
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
we begin with item number one.

942
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:40,000
- Sold to the lady in the white hat.
- $2,750. Yes or no?

943
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:43,800
This oriental rug.

944
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:04,600
I'll sell you both
10% of the Flamingo. $60,000 each.

945
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:09,700
- Aren't the shares already sold?
- Not if I'm still selling them.

946
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:07,900
- Look who's here.
- How you doing, Ben?

947
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:15,000
- So... did you miss the desert?
- That's not why I came.

948
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,700
Why did you come?

949
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:26,400
- What did she do?
- She fucked you.

950
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:31,700
There's a Swiss bank account
with almost $2 million in it.

951
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:36,000
- So?
- It's hers.

952
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:40,000
There's a lot of Swiss bank accounts
with $2 million in them.

953
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:44,300
Only one opened by Joe Epstein
for Virginia Hill.

954
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:49,600
I've seen copies
of the deposit records.

955
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:52,100
It's a lie.

956
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:57,200
Epstein has worked for me.
He has no reason to lie to me.

957
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:02,200
It's a lie. You repeat it,
I'll break your fucking jaw.

958
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:15,700
Can I get a glass of water?

959
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:58,800
Get those cases out of my sight.

960
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,800
I've told you, when we're here,
we don't want to see the boxes.

961
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,900
I haven't seen a single case
where I told you to put it.

962
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:14,200
- Excuse me... All right?
- I'm Natalie St. Clair.

963
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,300
Mr. Webb said I might be able
to work at the Flamingo.

964
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,600
- As what?
- Well, anything you might need.

965
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:29,500
- What kind of job would you like?
- Bartender or hatcheck girl.

966
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:35,900
Did you come in from Hollywood?
Did you fly in?

967
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:39,800
I love to fly,
but I couldn't afford to.

968
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Looking for a girl who likes to fly?

969
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:54,400
Virginia, I want to talk to you.

970
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,700
Virginia... Sugar.

971
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:03,100
We don't have time for this.

972
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:06,600
Shit! You almost got me
in the head again.

973
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:10,000
You were chasing some bimbo.

974
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:17,500
She's an employee.
She's going to be a hatcheck girl.

975
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,400
- You shattered Baccarat crystal.
- You just shattered us!

976
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,500
I'm not going to defend myself.
She wanted a job.

977
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,600
- What are you doing?
- Leaving. Don't try to stop me.

978
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,600
I should have gone
the day you killed Harry.

979
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:42,400
Where are you going?
To a numbered bank account?

980
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,800
What fantasy have you concocted
in your sick mind?

981
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,900
- Just ask what you want to ask.
- How much money is in the account?

982
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,800
Why?
You want to sell me a few shares?

983
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,600
<i>You gave me 53I 4%.
You want to sell me another 10%?</i>

984
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:04,600
That's about 400% sold by now.

985
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:09,300
Answer the question. How much
money have you stolen from the hotel?

986
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:12,400
With all the work I've done, -

987
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:16,700
- I'd be justified in taking
anything I can get my hands on.

988
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:20,900
I haven't. I could have taken a lot.
You'd never have known.

989
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,100
You irresponsible, unrealistic,
unreliable, philandering fuck!

990
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:33,600
I should have taken something,
but it isn't in me -

991
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:39,600
- to violate the trust of a person
I've been stupid enough to love.

992
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:44,900
How much money
do you have in the account?

993
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:50,200
- How much did you steal?
- Bye-bye, Ben. You're on your own.

994
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:11,700
Thanks for taking the time
to fly down here -

995
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:17,500
- to a lonely Italian exile
with a swollen prostate gland.

996
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,200
This tragic mess with the Flamingo -

997
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:26,600
- is being perpetrated by one
of my oldest friends. Benny Siegel.

998
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:33,200
Here's where we stand. The Flamingo
will open on Christmas Day.

999
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:41,600
My hotel friends tell me that's the
stupidest time to open a new joint.

1000
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:47,800
The total cost is now $6 million.
That's $5 million more than agreed.

1001
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
To get the last few million
he needed, -

1002
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:55,600
- Benny has had to sell
400% of the hotel.

1003
01:55:55,800 --> 01:56:03,300
He's sold to famous movie stars
and wealthy businessmen.

1004
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:07,500
They ain't just going to roll over
when it's time to collect.

1005
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:14,000
If there is a time to collect
in this whole fucking fiasco.

1006
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:19,100
Now all of this is nothing
compared to the most serious matter.

1007
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:23,000
The question of stealing.

1008
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:27,500
My banking friends in Switzerland
tell me that Virginia Hill...

1009
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:32,300
This broad that Joey A. Used to fuck
and Benny's in love with...

1010
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:38,400
She's pulled off a couple of million
from this here deal.

1011
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:44,400
There's a simple basic question
we have to ask:

1012
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:50,100
Did this broad steal this money
without Benny knowing about it, -

1013
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:55,400
- or is she just fronting for Benny?

1014
01:56:56,600 --> 01:57:00,500
Anybody who thinks Bugsy Siegel
didn't know is crazy.

1015
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:06,100
His name's Ben.
There's no need for disrespect.

1016
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:11,600
- What about his disrespect to us?
- Benny's got to take the rap.

1017
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:17,700
I agree with Joey and Frank.
What about the rest of you? Meyer?

1018
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:23,100
I don't believe he knew anything.
He was blinded by love.

1019
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:27,100
Benny always put women first.

1020
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:32,400
This time it's one woman that's got
him, and not the whole female race.

1021
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:38,200
Benny accepted what she told him.
There's no chance he stole from us.

1022
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,400
He didn't know.

1023
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:46,600
Benny's basic problem
is he doesn't respect money.

1024
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,800
He's not even interested in this
money. He's interested in the idea.

1025
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
- What idea?
- Building something.

1026
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:01,300
He's a dreamer. I'm not excusing it.
I'm a businessman.

1027
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,900
Anything that broad took,
Benny's got to make good on.

1028
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:10,300
What do you want to do about it...
as a businessman?

1029
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:16,300
Wait and see if the hotel works.
If it does, we'll all be happy.

1030
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:21,000
- Let him pay off her debt.
- What if the Flamingo goes bust?

1031
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,500
Then I'll handle it myself.

1032
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:56,100
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

1033
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:02,400
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

1034
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:09,600
- What about Gable and Cooper?
- Not a word.

1035
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:12,200
Worst luck I've ever seen.

1036
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:17,800
You can do all kinds of things,
but you can't control the weather.

1037
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,200
You can't lose heart.

1038
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:31,700
Go back and check the fuse box.

1039
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:37,600
- What the hell is going on?
- Can we get some flashlights?

1040
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming tonight, -

1041
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:06,300
- to try and make the opening
of the Flamingo a success.

1042
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:10,300
Due to the implementation
of further refinements, -

1043
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:16,200
- which will make the Flamingo
an even greater place, -

1044
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:22,900
- I am announcing a temporary
closure effective from Friday night.

1045
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:30,500
I hope to see you all
at the reopening of the hotel, -

1046
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:38,500
- the date of which will be
announced soon. Thank you...

1047
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:49,900
Meyer Lansky's on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

1048
02:01:52,700 --> 02:02:00,100
Meyer... No, we're shutting down
temporarily...

1049
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:08,600
Why would I fly to L.A. tonight
to see Gus and Moe?

1050
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:16,700
Meyer, I want you
to do something for me.

1051
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:21,500
Promise me, no matter what
happens, you'll protect Virginia.

1052
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:27,800
Give me your word on that,
and I'll go to L.A. tonight.

1053
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,800
Good.
Meyer, you want a tip?

1054
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:38,400
Keep your shares in the Flamingo.
You'll live to thank me.

1055
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:24,000
I'm sorry, Ben.
I should have been with you.

1056
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:27,800
You're here now.
You're the only one.

1057
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:36,600
- They told me you're going to L.A.
- I'm meeting Gus and Moe.

1058
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:43,900
If you're going to L.A. for money,
you may not need it.

1059
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:50,000
What do you mean?

1060
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:05,500
$2 million.

1061
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:15,900
I always said you were a better
businessman than I was.

1062
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:20,800
I don't get it.

1063
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:29,500
I don't know...

1064
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:36,400
Maybe I took it for us.
Maybe I took it for me.

1065
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:40,900
You get a little confused
and you get afraid...

1066
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:45,200
I don't know.

1067
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:51,700
Maybe I thought it'd buy us a couple
of hot dogs at Coney Island.

1068
02:04:56,500 --> 02:05:02,000
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just leave it in the bank?

1069
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:10,200
Save it for a rainy day.

1070
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:21,100
- I've got to go.
- You want me to go with you?

1071
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:25,500
Fly? In this weather?

1072
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,400
I see.

1073
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:37,600
Get out of here.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

1074
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:56,400
I love you, Ben.

1075
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:51,200
You've got Virginia all wrong.

1076
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:57,900
- She was willing to fly for me.
- Let's not talk about Virginia.

1077
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:04,600
All right, goodnight.

1078
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:49,300
<i>- I'm on to your racket.
- The blueprints are all drawn.</i>

1079
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:55,500
<i>You've got a line, sister, but it
don't make a wife for a right guy.</i>

1080
02:07:55,700 --> 02:08:00,100
<i>I'm telling you straight.
Forget that you've ever seen him.</i>

1081
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:05,400
<i>Yeah, you've got a line, but it
don't make a wife for a right guy.</i>

1082
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:09,800
<i>I'm telling you straight,
forget that you've ever seen him.</i>

1083
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,700
<i>If you don't get what I mean...
this might give you an idea.</i>

1084
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:21,000
Meyer Lansky sent us. We're
taking over control of the hotel.

1085
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:24,600
Ben Siegel controls The Flamingo.

1086
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,700
Bugsy Siegel is dead.
The Flamingo belongs to us.
