1
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:42,138
The year, 1462.

2
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,503
Constantinople had fallen.

3
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,580
Moslem Turks swept into Europe with a vast, superior force...

4
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,785
...striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

5
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:56,421
From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight...

6
00:00:56,521 --> 00:01:00,841
...of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.

7
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:19,135
On the eve of the battle...

8
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:22,005
...his bride Elisabeta...

9
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:25,416
...whom he prized above all things on Earth...

10
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:29,676
...knew that he must face an insurmountable force...

11
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:33,417
...from which he might never return.

12
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:35,050
God be praised.
I am victorious.

13
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,754
Elisabeta.

14
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:53,538
The vengeful Turks shot an arrow into the castle...

15
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,998
...carrying false news of Dracula's death.

16
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:59,670
Elisabeta, believing him dead...

17
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:02,744
...flung herself into the river.

18
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,919
My prince is dead.

19
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:46,146
All is lost without him.

20
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:49,087
May God unite us in heaven.

21
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,834
She has taken her own life.

22
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,644
Her soul cannot be saved.

23
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,847
She is damned.

24
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,016
It is God's law.

25
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:26,564
Is this my reward for defending God's church?

26
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:27,732
Sacrilege.

27
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:31,427
I renounce God.

28
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:35,898
I shall rise from my own death...

29
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:40,667
...to avenge hers with all the powers of darkness.

30
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:01,489
The blood is the life...

31
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,461
...and it shall be mine.

32
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:05,746
I've done everything that you asked, master.

33
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:10,595
All the preparations are in order.

34
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,503
Everything.

35
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:15,265
I await your command.

36
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:18,033
For I know...

37
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:21,370
...that when the rewards are given...

38
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:26,379
...I will be one of those who benefits from your generosity.

39
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:32,688
Thank you.

40
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,785
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

41
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,898
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

42
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,501
I want you to take over for his foreign client...

43
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,703
...this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

44
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:49,039
He's buying up property in London.
- Of course, sir.

45
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,976
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

46
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:55,179
This is a great opportunity for you, Harker.

47
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,449
But you'll have to leave for Transylvania immediately.

48
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:02,186
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.

49
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:04,550
Yes, of course, sir.

50
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,323
If I may inquire...

51
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:10,094
...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

52
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:12,321
Nothing. Nothing.

53
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,530
Personal problems.

54
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:16,467
Close these transactions...

55
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,770
...and your future with this firm is assured.

56
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,230
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

57
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:29,564
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

58
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:32,182
We can be married when I return.

59
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,219
Of course.

60
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,651
I'll write.

61
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,689
Jonathan.

62
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:47,095
Jonathan, I love you.

63
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:49,163
I love you, Mina.

64
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,830
25th May, Budapest.

65
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:24,401
Left Budapest early this morning.

66
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,304
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...

67
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:29,404
...and entering the east.

68
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:33,944
The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...

69
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:35,746
...just on the borders of three states...

70
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,516
...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...

71
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,784
...in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...

72
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:45,444
...one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.

73
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:49,456
'My friend...

74
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,823
...welcome to the Carpathians.

75
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,158
I am anxiously expecting you.

76
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,367
At the Borgo Pass...

77
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:02,206
...my carriage will await you and bring you to me.

78
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:07,073
I trust your journey from London has been a happy one...

79
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:10,114
...and that you will enjoy your stay...

80
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:13,274
...in my beautiful land.

81
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:17,318
Your friend, D. ”

82
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,393
Diary, 25th May.

83
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,830
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

84
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:35,940
And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure...

85
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,343
...I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.

86
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:42,207
I am longing to hear all the news.

87
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:46,247
It must be so nice to see strange countries.

88
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,620
I wonder if we...
I mean Jonathan and I...

89
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,280
...shall ever see them together.

90
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:09,400
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

91
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,704
For the dead travel fast.

92
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:31,014
I say, is the castle far?

93
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,566
Welcome to my home.

94
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:55,906
Enter freely of your own will...

95
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:58,976
...and leave some of the happiness you bring.

96
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:00,944
Count Dracula?

97
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,044
I am...

98
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:05,112
...Dracula.

99
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:08,946
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

100
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:14,222
Come in.

101
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:33,073
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

102
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:35,472
...do not join you.

103
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:41,011
But I have already dined.

104
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,815
And I never drink...

105
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,384
...wine.

106
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:57,664
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

107
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:02,663
The Order of the Dracul.

108
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:07,235
The Dragon.

109
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:09,776
An ancient society...

110
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,541
...pledging my forefathers...

111
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,230
...to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.

112
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:24,892
That relationship was not entirely...

113
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,363
...successful.

114
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:30,448
Oh, yes.

115
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:37,196
It is no laughing matter.

116
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:43,939
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

117
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:47,117
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...

118
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:50,516
...whose blood flows in these veins?

119
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:57,425
Blood...

120
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:05,896
...is too precious a thing in these times.

121
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:14,539
The warlike days are over.

122
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:19,743
The victories of my great race...

123
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,646
...are but a tale to be told.

124
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:29,715
I am the last of my kind.

125
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:35,829
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.

126
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,366
Forgive me.

127
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:53,784
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...

128
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:56,079
...of your mighty London...

129
00:15:56,286 --> 00:16:01,058
...to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...

130
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:03,422
...to share its life...

131
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,619
...its changes, its death.

132
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,197
There. You, Count, are...

133
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,372
Are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

134
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:17,633
Congratulations.

135
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:20,537
Your firm writes most highly...

136
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:22,145
...of your talents.

137
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:26,011
They say you are a man of good...

138
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,216
...taste.

139
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,222
And that you are a worthy substitute...

140
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:37,089
...to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

141
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:39,888
You may rely on me, Count.

142
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,866
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

143
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,702
...in such precise locations around London?

144
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,396
Is it to raise the market value?

145
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,668
Do you believe in destiny?

146
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,176
That even the powers of time...

147
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:04,581
...can be altered for a single purpose?

148
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:16,466
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth...

149
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,660
...is the one who finds...

150
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,100
...true love.

151
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,967
You found Mina.

152
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,473
I thought she was lost.

153
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:30,877
We're to be married as soon as I return.

154
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:33,039
Are you married, Count?

155
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,585
Sir...

156
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:37,685
...are you married?

157
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:41,788
I was married once.

158
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:44,187
Ages ago, it seems.

159
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:47,462
She died.

160
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:51,332
I'm very sorry.

161
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
She was fortunate.

162
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:59,373
My life, at its best, is misery.

163
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:07,221
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

164
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:10,886
And you a faithful husband.

165
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,059
Come.

166
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,754
Write now, my friend,
to your firm...

167
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:23,900
...and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you...

168
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
...to stay with me...

169
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,283
...until a month from now.

170
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,639
A month?

171
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:35,156
Do you wish me to stay so long?

172
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,280
I will take no refusal.

173
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:56,121
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

174
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:00,971
I know Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.

175
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:05,408
He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family...

176
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:09,379
...I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.

177
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:12,282
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...

178
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:17,182
...and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.

179
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,955
How disgustingly awful.

180
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,933
Mina.

181
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,007
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

182
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:43,413
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

183
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:47,250
...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?

184
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,619
When he could be forcing you to perform...

185
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:53,924
...unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

186
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:55,625
Lucy, really.

187
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:58,628
You shouldn't talk about my fiancé in such a way.

188
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:02,408
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.

189
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,193
Oh, Mina. So I see.

190
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:08,769
Much, much more.

191
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:13,207
That's...

192
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,709
What is it, Lucy?

193
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:20,348
Because I don't understand it.

194
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:23,811
Can a man and woman really do...

195
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:25,322
...that?

196
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:27,890
I did, only last night.

197
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,787
Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

198
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:35,030
Well, in my dreams.

199
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:38,029
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

200
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,234
You can tell Lucy.

201
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:43,671
We've kissed. That's all.

202
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:46,753
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

203
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,514
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

204
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,283
...my rich friend.

205
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,819
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

206
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,284
And here I am, almost 20...

207
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,753
...practically a hag.

208
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:10,430
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

209
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:15,498
Oh, look.
- What is that?

210
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:17,866
A Texan.

211
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:20,074
Quincey P. Morris.

212
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,006
He's so young and fresh...

213
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:25,482
...like a wild stallion between my legs.

214
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:27,617
You're positively indecent.

215
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:30,151
I just know what men desire.

216
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:32,055
Watch.

217
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:34,680
Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

218
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,794
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

219
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,894
Oh, thank you.

220
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,292
Please let me touch it.

221
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:50,329
It's so big.

222
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,978
Little girl.

223
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:58,206
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

224
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:00,474
I hold your hand...

225
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:03,163
...and you've kissed me.
- Jack.

226
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:07,745
Oceans of love...
Oh, Jack, my darling.

227
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:09,659
Poor little baby.

228
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,695
My kitten, come over here.

229
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:14,030
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

230
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,291
My poor little blossom.

231
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:19,619
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

232
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,769
Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

233
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,140
What a naughty bear.
Let me...

234
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:27,335
Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur.

235
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:30,443
Oh, my darling.

236
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:33,047
Oh, you look wonderful.

237
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:35,979
I'm so sorry about your hat.

238
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:38,088
Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

239
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:39,556
Is it really?

240
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:42,456
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...

241
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,596
...but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.

242
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:49,766
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...

243
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:52,168
...that they say what they please.

244
00:22:52,268 --> 00:22:57,440
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.

245
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,140
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.

246
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,688
What manner of man is this?

247
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,933
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

248
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,936
...in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins...

249
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:29,906
...respected member of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

250
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:34,340
...returns from business abroad in Transylvania...

251
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:37,580
...promptly suffers a complete mental breakdown.

252
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,911
He's now obsessed with some blood lust.

253
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,021
George.

254
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,958
Wait here.

255
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:01,237
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

256
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,965
...or a canapé?

257
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:08,653
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

258
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:11,514
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

259
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:13,516
Is my personal life of interest to you?

260
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:17,484
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

261
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:20,623
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

262
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:24,090
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

263
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:27,058
You see,
each life that I ingest...

264
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:29,424
...gives back life to me.

265
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:35,900
A fly gives you life?

266
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:37,907
Certainly.

267
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:42,078
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

268
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:44,981
...than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

269
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:49,652
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.

270
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:53,984
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

271
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:57,651
Yes, spiders eat them.

272
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,158
What about sparrows?

273
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:03,628
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

274
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:07,963
Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

275
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:11,431
A kitten.

276
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:13,276
I beg you.

277
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:16,277
A little, sleek... A playful kitten.

278
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:19,919
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

279
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:21,851
No one would refuse me a kitten.

280
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:24,215
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

281
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:28,124
Oh, yes.

282
00:25:28,224 --> 00:25:30,224
A big cat.

283
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:33,429
My salvation depends upon it.
- Your salvation?

284
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:35,529
Yes. I need lives.

285
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:39,058
I need lives for the master.
- What master?

286
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:44,005
The master will come...

287
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:48,311
...and he has promised to make me immortal.

288
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,411
How?

289
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:53,514
Get him off.

290
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:56,915
The blood is the life.

291
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,080
The blood is the life.

292
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:04,486
30th May, Castle Dracula.

293
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:09,065
I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul.

294
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:10,567
The count...

295
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:14,137
...the way he looked at Mina's picture fills me with dread...

296
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:19,517
...as if I have a part to play in a story that is not known to me.

297
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:44,111
I didn't hear you come in.

298
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:49,862
Take care how you cut yourself.

299
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:53,440
It is more dangerous than you think.

300
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:04,776
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

301
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:07,251
Perhaps you should...

302
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:09,584
...grow a beard.

303
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,931
The letters I requested.

304
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:22,331
Have you written them?

305
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:40,921
Good.

306
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:52,898
Should you leave these rooms...

307
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:56,606
...you will not, by any chance...

308
00:27:56,706 --> 00:28:00,466
...go to sleep in any other part of the castle.

309
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:03,872
It is old...

310
00:28:05,114 --> 00:28:08,015
...and has many bad memories.

311
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:13,681
Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

312
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:26,258
Do not put your faith in such trinkets of deceit.

313
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:30,734
We are in Transylvania.

314
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:35,768
Transylvania is not England.

315
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:39,106
Our ways are not your ways.

316
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:41,315
And to you...

317
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:44,681
...there shall be many strange things.

318
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:48,118
I've seen many strange things already.

319
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:52,404
Bloody wolves chasing me through some blue inferno.

320
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:59,730
Listen to them.

321
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,109
The children of the night.

322
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,411
What sweet music they make.

323
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:14,606
Music? Those animals?

324
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:52,985
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

325
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:56,692
To the firm, to my family and to my beloved Mina.

326
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:01,432
I said nothing of my fears as he will read them, no doubt.

327
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:07,661
I know now that I am a prisoner.

328
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:35,022
Jonathan.

329
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:38,255
Jonathan, come to me.

330
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:50,004
Come.

331
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:10,224
Lay down.

332
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:13,327
Lay back into my arms.

333
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:25,304
Lay back, Jonathan.

334
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:30,230
How dare you touch him.
He belongs to me.

335
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,833
You yourself never loved.

336
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:40,567
Yes. I too can love.

337
00:34:42,778 --> 00:34:46,771
And I shall love again.

338
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:57,986
Are we to have nothing tonight?

339
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:44,763
'Dearest Mina,
all is well here.

340
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:47,877
The count has insisted I remain for a month...

341
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:50,279
...to tutor him in English custom.

342
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:53,712
I can say no more,
except I love you.

343
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:56,612
Ever faithful, Jonathan. ”

344
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:04,742
The letters I have written have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

345
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:11,433
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors who are loyal to the death...

346
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,493
...to whatever nobleman they serve...

347
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:20,276
...day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth...

348
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:23,573
...from the bowels of the castle.

349
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,380
They are to be delivered to his newly acquired Carfax Abbey in London.

350
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,154
Why do they fill these boxes with earth?

351
00:36:40,362 --> 00:36:42,922
I love him. I love him.

352
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,968
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

353
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,605
I love him and I've said yes.

354
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:55,311
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

355
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:58,209
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

356
00:36:58,414 --> 00:37:02,316
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

357
00:37:02,518 --> 00:37:05,321
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

358
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:09,821
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

359
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:13,226
You don't seem to care.

360
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:16,565
It's just that I'm so terribly worried about Jonathan.

361
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:18,901
This letter I received is so...

362
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:23,372
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

363
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:25,472
Mina, don't worry.

364
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:54,169
Captain's log: The Demeter.

365
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:57,363
27th June, 1897.

366
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,544
We picked up 50 boxes of experimental earth...

367
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:04,964
...bound for London, England.

368
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,283
Set sail at noon into a storm...

369
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:09,952
...that seemed to come out of nowhere...

370
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:12,418
...carrying us out to sea.

371
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:51,117
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

372
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:55,729
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

373
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:59,498
Believe someone or something...

374
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:02,261
...is aboard the ship with us.

375
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:17,213
Master, I am here.

376
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,189
The master of all life is at hand.

377
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,390
Gather round.

378
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:25,961
I am here to do your bidding, master.

379
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:28,464
I have worshipped you long and far off.

380
00:39:28,564 --> 00:39:31,965
And now you are near, master.

381
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:34,727
I am your slave.

382
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:37,497
I await your command.

383
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:40,509
The case of Renfield grows more interesting.

384
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:44,480
Yet, there is method in his madness with his flies and spiders.

385
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,816
Had I the secret of even one such brilliant mind...

386
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:51,716
...the key to the fancy of one lunatic...

387
00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:00,126
Lucy.

388
00:40:57,653 --> 00:40:59,985
Lucy? Lucy.

389
00:42:39,988 --> 00:42:44,049
No. Do not see me.

390
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:02,634
Oh. I couldn't control myself.

391
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:06,715
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

392
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:10,774
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

393
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:15,724
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

394
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:17,292
I'm absolutely shaking.

395
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,328
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

396
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:22,731
I had to. It sort of pulled me and lured me.

397
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:25,891
I had no control.
- It's all right.

398
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:29,002
It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

399
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:33,044
I still have the taste of his blood in my mouth.

400
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:48,618
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

401
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,625
Master.

402
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:56,295
I am here to do your bidding.

403
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,330
Master. I am here.

404
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,100
I have worshipped you.

405
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:09,945
Contrary to some beliefs,
the vampire...

406
00:44:10,045 --> 00:44:14,082
...like any other night creature,
can move about by day...

407
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:19,062
...though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.

408
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:38,197
See the amazing cinematograph.

409
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:41,341
A wonder of modern civilization.

410
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:43,704
The latest sensation.

411
00:44:43,912 --> 00:44:47,032
The greatest attraction of the century.

412
00:44:47,124 --> 00:44:49,845
The new wonder of the world.

413
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:16,209
See me.

414
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:19,979
See me now.

415
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:29,151
Escaped wolf from zoo still at large.

416
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:31,357
Buy a paper, sir?

417
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,528
Thank you, sir.

418
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:41,058
Get your Gazette.
Penny a paper.

419
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:56,807
My humblest apologies.

420
00:45:58,053 --> 00:46:00,920
Forgive my ignorance.

421
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:04,091
I am recently arrived from abroad...

422
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:07,261
...and I do not know your city.

423
00:46:07,462 --> 00:46:12,342
Is a beautiful lady...
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

424
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:16,269
I have offended you.

425
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:20,075
I am only looking for the cinematograph.

426
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:23,712
I understand it is a wonder of the civilized world.

427
00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:27,475
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

428
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:30,642
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

429
00:46:39,928 --> 00:46:42,631
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

430
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:46,334
...should not be walking the streets of London without her gentleman.

431
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:48,629
Do I know you, sir?

432
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:52,738
Are you acquainted with my husband?

433
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:54,941
Shall I call the police?

434
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:58,772
Husband?

435
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,380
I shall bother you no more.

436
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:07,153
Sir.

437
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:10,483
It is I who have been rude.

438
00:47:10,692 --> 00:47:13,456
If you're looking...
- Please.

439
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:18,390
Permit me to introduce myself.

440
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:24,500
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

441
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:29,702
A prince, no less?
- I am...

442
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:33,146
...your servant.

443
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,910
Wilhelmina Murray.

444
00:47:40,922 --> 00:47:43,516
I am...

445
00:47:43,725 --> 00:47:45,725
...honored...

446
00:47:45,894 --> 00:47:47,894
...Madam Mina.

447
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:53,766
This way.

448
00:48:06,781 --> 00:48:08,781
Hello, sir.

449
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:12,153
Mr. Holmwood asked me to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

450
00:48:12,253 --> 00:48:13,755
Yes, sir.

451
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:16,575
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

452
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:18,326
Oh, Jack.

453
00:48:18,426 --> 00:48:21,623
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

454
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:25,500
Did Arthur put you up to this...

455
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,938
...or did you want me alone just once before I'm married?

456
00:48:30,038 --> 00:48:32,506
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

457
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:35,369
I'm here as your doctor.

458
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:37,812
Your fiancé is very worried about you...

459
00:48:37,912 --> 00:48:42,679
...and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

460
00:48:42,884 --> 00:48:45,444
I must have your complete trust.

461
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:51,657
Help me, Jack.

462
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:55,764
I don't know what's happening to me.

463
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:57,889
I'm changing.

464
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,099
I can feel it.

465
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:03,536
I can hear everything.

466
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:06,641
I hear the servants at the other end of the house, whispering.

467
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:10,661
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

468
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:14,459
But I'm having horrible nightmares, Jack.

469
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,552
The eyes.

470
00:49:17,652 --> 00:49:19,054
Oh, Jack.

471
00:49:19,154 --> 00:49:22,783
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

472
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:27,794
Let it work.

473
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,425
Thank you.
- Lucy.

474
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:33,999
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

475
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,077
And may I say, Miss Lucy is hotter than a June bride...

476
00:49:42,177 --> 00:49:44,579
...riding bareback buck naked in the Sahara.

477
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:48,316
I would watch my colonial tongue if I were you.

478
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:52,375
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

479
00:49:52,587 --> 00:49:56,250
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

480
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:59,160
Jack, are you still brooding over Miss Lucy?

481
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,831
I can only conclude it must be something mental.

482
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:06,298
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

483
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:11,373
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

484
00:50:11,473 --> 00:50:13,473
Let's have a look at her.

485
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:26,620
I'm at a loss, I admit.

486
00:50:26,821 --> 00:50:29,491
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

487
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:31,593
...the metaphysician, philosopher.

488
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:34,562
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

489
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:38,533
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

490
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:40,793
He's my teacher and mentor.

491
00:50:43,738 --> 00:50:47,174
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

492
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:49,375
Spare no expense.

493
00:51:24,145 --> 00:51:25,880
Astounding.

494
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,744
There are no limits to science.

495
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:33,419
How can you call this science?

496
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:37,692
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons?

497
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:39,792
Really.

498
00:51:43,364 --> 00:51:45,798
I shouldn't have come here.

499
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I must go.

500
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:55,174
Do not fear me.

501
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:11,960
Stop this.

502
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,060
Stop this.

503
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:26,532
My God. Who are you?

504
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:28,476
I know you.

505
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:33,070
I have crossed oceans of time...

506
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:35,281
...to find you.

507
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:16,335
There is no need to panic.

508
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:21,177
The animal handlers have everything under complete control.

509
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:42,181
Come here, Mina.

510
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:03,469
He likes you.

511
00:54:29,297 --> 00:54:32,528
There is much to be learned from beasts.

512
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,975
The tropical pampas vampire bat must...

513
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:52,814
...consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...

514
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:55,714
...or its own blood cells will die.

515
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,625
Cute little vermin, ja?

516
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:10,331
Blood and the diseases of the blood...

517
00:56:10,431 --> 00:56:13,711
...such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

518
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:16,637
The very name 'venereal diseases'...

519
00:56:16,737 --> 00:56:20,441
...the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

520
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:24,011
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

521
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:28,216
...the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

522
00:56:28,316 --> 00:56:33,356
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.

523
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:39,260
What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

524
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,360
Telegraph?

525
00:56:44,432 --> 00:56:48,352
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

526
00:56:58,513 --> 00:57:00,538
Dawn.

527
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:03,651
These may be the last words I write in this journal.

528
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:06,454
Dracula has left me with these women...

529
00:57:06,554 --> 00:57:08,714
...these devils of the pit.

530
00:57:08,785 --> 00:57:10,992
They drain my blood to keep me weak...

531
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:13,892
...barely alive so I cannot escape.

532
00:57:13,977 --> 00:57:17,365
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.

533
00:57:17,465 --> 00:57:20,368
There must be passageway to the river...

534
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:22,937
...and then away from this cursed land...

535
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:28,237
...where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.

536
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:38,653
For the record, I do attest...

537
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:42,023
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...

538
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:46,443
...became personally involved in these strange events.

539
00:58:40,014 --> 00:58:43,694
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

540
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:51,058
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.

541
00:58:51,158 --> 00:58:53,628
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.

542
00:58:53,728 --> 00:58:56,664
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.

543
00:58:56,764 --> 00:58:59,967
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

544
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:03,671
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

545
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:05,771
Blood loss? How?

546
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:17,049
My God, close the doors.

547
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:29,096
My God...

548
00:59:29,196 --> 00:59:31,255
...she's only a child.

549
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,933
Ja.

550
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:37,703
My God.

551
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:41,876
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

552
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:44,645
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

553
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:47,181
Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

554
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:49,750
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

555
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,850
Landsteiner's method.

556
00:59:53,587 --> 00:59:55,748
Animals, goats, sheeps.

557
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,393
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...

558
00:59:59,493 --> 01:00:01,228
...her red blood cells will explode.

559
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:03,626
She will die.
Take this tube.

560
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:09,804
What in God's name is going on up here?

561
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:11,806
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

562
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:14,375
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

563
01:00:14,475 --> 01:00:17,435
Good God.
- You're the fiancé? Please.

564
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:23,584
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

565
01:00:23,684 --> 01:00:25,753
She wants blood and blood she must have.

566
01:00:25,853 --> 01:00:27,254
Take off your coat.

567
01:00:27,354 --> 01:00:29,354
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

568
01:00:30,624 --> 01:00:32,888
Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

569
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:34,695
Roll it up.

570
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:37,035
This may hurt a little, Art.

571
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:51,879
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

572
01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:53,979
Your last drop?

573
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:55,716
Thank you.

574
01:00:55,816 --> 01:01:00,254
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

575
01:01:00,354 --> 01:01:02,354
Hold her hand.

576
01:01:14,335 --> 01:01:18,739
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

577
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:23,319
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.

578
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:29,833
What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

579
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:36,290
Those marks on her throat...

580
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:38,826
...no disease, no trituration...

581
01:01:38,926 --> 01:01:40,828
...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

582
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:43,088
Oh? Where did the blood go?

583
01:01:44,398 --> 01:01:46,734
You were once a careful student, Jack.

584
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:48,736
Use your brain.
Where did the blood go?

585
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:50,836
Tell me.

586
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:53,641
The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

587
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:56,210
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...

588
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,646
...that which you cannot account for.

589
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:03,866
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

590
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:06,120
Ja. Why not?

591
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:10,418
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

592
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:12,793
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are...

593
01:02:12,893 --> 01:02:16,130
...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

594
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,790
Jack, you are a scientist.

595
01:02:18,999 --> 01:02:22,403
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

596
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:25,039
...and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

597
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:27,274
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.

598
01:02:27,374 --> 01:02:29,854
Materialization, astral bodies.

599
01:02:38,586 --> 01:02:40,586
Professor?

600
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,089
Where did he go?

601
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,527
You see?

602
01:02:48,595 --> 01:02:50,998
I feel like a blundering novice.

603
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:54,702
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

604
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:56,871
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...

605
01:02:56,971 --> 01:02:59,173
...by something unspeakable out there.

606
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:00,508
Dead, but not dead.

607
01:03:00,608 --> 01:03:03,744
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.

608
01:03:03,844 --> 01:03:06,981
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

609
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,481
It is a beast, a monster.

610
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:31,227
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

611
01:03:31,438 --> 01:03:34,675
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

612
01:03:34,775 --> 01:03:37,095
I wish I were myself again...

613
01:03:37,244 --> 01:03:40,907
...the sensible Mina I always depended on.

614
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:49,421
Absinthe...

615
01:03:49,623 --> 01:03:52,343
...is the aphrodisiac of the self.

616
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:56,453
The green fairy...

617
01:03:56,664 --> 01:04:01,363
...who lives in the absinthe...

618
01:04:01,568 --> 01:04:03,568
...wants your soul.

619
01:04:06,373 --> 01:04:08,373
But...

620
01:04:09,009 --> 01:04:12,001
...you are safe with me.

621
01:04:26,794 --> 01:04:29,024
Tell me, Prince...

622
01:04:29,229 --> 01:04:31,254
...tell me of your home.

623
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:36,062
The most beautiful place...

624
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:38,270
...in all creation.

625
01:04:39,006 --> 01:04:42,840
Yes, it must be.

626
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:50,677
A land beyond a great, vast forest...

627
01:04:53,387 --> 01:04:56,427
...surrounded by majestic mountains...

628
01:04:57,891 --> 01:04:59,891
...lush vineyards...

629
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:06,323
...and flowers of such frailty and beauty...

630
01:05:06,533 --> 01:05:09,013
...as to be found nowhere else.

631
01:05:18,812 --> 01:05:20,748
You've described my home...

632
01:05:20,848 --> 01:05:23,648
...as if you had seen it firsthand.

633
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:30,147
It's your voice, perhaps.

634
01:05:30,357 --> 01:05:32,357
It's so familiar.

635
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:36,261
It's like...

636
01:05:37,598 --> 01:05:41,278
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...

637
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,830
...and it comforts me.

638
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,000
When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

639
01:06:10,397 --> 01:06:12,456
And what of the princess?

640
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:20,908
Princess?

641
01:06:21,008 --> 01:06:23,328
There is always a princess...

642
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:27,479
...with gowns flowing white.

643
01:06:31,718 --> 01:06:34,744
And her face.

644
01:06:34,955 --> 01:06:37,924
Oh, God...

645
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:40,125
...her face...

646
01:06:43,764 --> 01:06:45,764
...is a river.

647
01:06:50,804 --> 01:06:52,804
The princess...

648
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:57,647
...she's a river filled with tears of sadness...

649
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,679
...and heartbreak.

650
01:07:04,852 --> 01:07:06,852
There was a princess.

651
01:07:10,357 --> 01:07:12,357
Elisabeta.

652
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:16,897
She was the most radiant woman...

653
01:07:16,997 --> 01:07:19,797
...in all the empires of the world.

654
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:30,287
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.

655
01:07:32,379 --> 01:07:35,143
She leapt to her death...

656
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:38,229
...into the river that you spoke of.

657
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:41,720
In my mother's tongue...

658
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:45,223
...it is called...

659
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:48,451
...argesh.

660
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:52,764
River princess.

661
01:09:28,862 --> 01:09:30,297
Dear Madam.

662
01:09:30,397 --> 01:09:33,333
Your fiancé is safe and in the care...

663
01:09:33,433 --> 01:09:37,273
...of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

664
01:09:37,504 --> 01:09:41,804
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...

665
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:45,445
...and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...

666
01:09:45,545 --> 01:09:48,715
...so that you may immediately be married.

667
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:52,410
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

668
01:09:55,589 --> 01:09:57,716
My sweet prince.

669
01:09:57,924 --> 01:10:00,518
Jonathan must never know of us.

670
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:13,006
Dr. Van Helsing.

671
01:10:13,106 --> 01:10:16,310
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

672
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:19,646
How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

673
01:10:19,746 --> 01:10:22,049
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...

674
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:24,229
...and your worry for him.

675
01:10:24,418 --> 01:10:27,698
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.

676
01:10:31,124 --> 01:10:33,760
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

677
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,885
...and there are lights.

678
01:10:36,096 --> 01:10:38,932
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

679
01:10:39,032 --> 01:10:41,112
...the light of all light.

680
01:10:46,606 --> 01:10:48,606
Go now.
See your friend.

681
01:11:09,696 --> 01:11:12,062
You look different.

682
01:11:12,265 --> 01:11:15,325
You look positively radiant.

683
01:11:15,535 --> 01:11:17,037
You heard from Jonathan.

684
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:19,264
Didn't you?
- Yes.

685
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:22,941
He's safe.

686
01:11:23,143 --> 01:11:25,771
He's in a convent in Romania.

687
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:29,346
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

688
01:11:29,549 --> 01:11:31,285
The good sisters are caring for him.

689
01:11:31,385 --> 01:11:35,913
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

690
01:11:36,123 --> 01:11:39,115
...but I won't go.

691
01:11:39,326 --> 01:11:41,521
I'm not going to leave you.

692
01:11:43,897 --> 01:11:46,297
You've got to go to him...

693
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,060
...and you've got to love him...

694
01:11:49,169 --> 01:11:52,209
...and marry him right then and there.

695
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:56,405
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

696
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:58,850
It's my wedding gift to you.

697
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:03,654
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

698
01:12:05,385 --> 01:12:07,751
I'll be all right.

699
01:12:08,422 --> 01:12:10,913
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

700
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:27,906
Jack, how is she?

701
01:12:46,626 --> 01:12:49,459
This is why I cannot breathe.

702
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,663
Lucy, it's medicinal.

703
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:54,067
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

704
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:57,237
It's garlic.
It's nothing but common garlic.

705
01:12:57,337 --> 01:13:00,697
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

706
01:13:00,769 --> 01:13:04,369
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

707
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:07,378
Arthur sent me to take care of you.

708
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:09,049
He said if you don't get better quick...

709
01:13:09,149 --> 01:13:13,789
...I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.

710
01:13:15,155 --> 01:13:17,555
You're such a beast.

711
01:13:20,894 --> 01:13:22,894
Will you kiss me?

712
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:28,299
Kiss me.

713
01:13:35,842 --> 01:13:39,710
That old coot.
- Get off me.

714
01:13:39,913 --> 01:13:43,280
Listen to me.
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

715
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:48,419
You're at peace.

716
01:13:48,588 --> 01:13:52,354
Look. There. There.

717
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:58,029
Nosferatu.

718
01:14:11,278 --> 01:14:13,914
'Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...

719
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:17,882
...of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

720
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:20,387
How he impaled people and roasted them...

721
01:14:20,487 --> 01:14:22,122
...boiled their heads in a kettle...

722
01:14:22,222 --> 01:14:24,558
...how he skinned them alive...

723
01:14:24,658 --> 01:14:29,218
...and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood.'

724
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,896
Dracul.

725
01:14:35,101 --> 01:14:37,592
For blood is the life.

726
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:56,684
'My dearest Prince, forgive me.

727
01:14:56,890 --> 01:15:00,494
I have received word from my fiancé in Romania.

728
01:15:00,594 --> 01:15:04,354
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

729
01:15:04,798 --> 01:15:07,289
I will never see you again.

730
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,500
Mina. ”

731
01:15:18,945 --> 01:15:21,345
It is odd,
but I feel almost...

732
01:15:21,413 --> 01:15:24,050
...that my strange friend is with me.

733
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:26,948
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

734
01:15:27,153 --> 01:15:30,257
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.

735
01:15:30,357 --> 01:15:33,293
And now without him,
soon to be a bride...

736
01:15:33,393 --> 01:15:36,055
...I feel confused and lost.

737
01:15:36,262 --> 01:15:40,221
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.

738
01:15:40,433 --> 01:15:43,368
Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.

739
01:16:01,588 --> 01:16:03,818
Winds.

740
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:16,894
It is the cause.

741
01:16:17,103 --> 01:16:19,731
It is the cause of my soul.

742
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:21,374
It is Dracula...

743
01:16:21,474 --> 01:16:23,533
...the undead...

744
01:16:23,743 --> 01:16:26,783
...the foe I have pursued all my life.

745
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,750
Dracula.

746
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,335
Jack, hurry.
I have much to tell you.

747
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:42,362
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

748
01:16:42,462 --> 01:16:44,828
Do not fail here tonight.

749
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:48,034
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...

750
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:50,203
...an enormous power,
so guard her well.

751
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:53,974
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...

752
01:16:54,074 --> 01:16:56,074
...a whore of darkness.

753
01:16:57,944 --> 01:17:00,024
You're a sick old buzzard.

754
01:17:01,047 --> 01:17:03,047
Hear me out, young man.

755
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:05,585
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.

756
01:17:05,685 --> 01:17:07,320
Do you understand? No.

757
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:11,591
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

758
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:14,171
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

759
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,794
She is the devil's concubine.

760
01:17:18,598 --> 01:17:20,598
Do you understand me?

761
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:24,698
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

762
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:28,533
But not on an empty stomach.

763
01:17:28,742 --> 01:17:30,903
Jack.
- Here, sir.

764
01:17:31,111 --> 01:17:33,807
I starve. Feed me.

765
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:36,914
You old coot.

766
01:19:51,451 --> 01:19:54,721
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...

767
01:19:54,821 --> 01:19:58,882
...cannot protect you from my power.

768
01:20:11,337 --> 01:20:14,773
I condemn you to living death...

769
01:20:14,974 --> 01:20:18,068
...to eternal hunger...

770
01:20:18,278 --> 01:20:22,510
...for living blood.

771
01:21:56,075 --> 01:22:00,113
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

772
01:22:00,213 --> 01:22:02,306
Believe?
How can I believe?

773
01:22:02,515 --> 01:22:06,286
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

774
01:22:06,386 --> 01:22:08,386
An autopsy? Lucy?

775
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:14,314
No, not exactly. I just want to cut
off her head and take out her heart.

776
01:22:20,099 --> 01:22:22,932
Diary, 17th September.

777
01:22:23,136 --> 01:22:26,697
Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.

778
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:30,209
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.

779
01:22:30,309 --> 01:22:34,549
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

780
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:38,217
It is as if a part of me is dead too...

781
01:22:38,317 --> 01:22:41,154
...except for the tiny hope that lives in me...

782
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:43,790
...that I will again see my prince.

783
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:45,890
Is he here?

784
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:47,493
Now that I am married...

785
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:51,731
...I begin to understand the nature of
my feelings for my strange friend...

786
01:22:51,831 --> 01:22:54,391
...who is always in my thoughts.

787
01:23:05,278 --> 01:23:07,303
Jonathan, what is it?

788
01:23:07,513 --> 01:23:09,513
It is the man himself.

789
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:11,676
Look, he's grown young.

790
01:23:55,294 --> 01:23:59,731
Gentlemen, must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?

791
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:01,932
She died horribly enough.

792
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:07,640
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

793
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,231
But if she's not dead...

794
01:24:10,443 --> 01:24:12,912
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

795
01:24:13,012 --> 01:24:17,972
No. All I say is she is undead.

796
01:24:18,985 --> 01:24:20,386
Undead.

797
01:24:20,486 --> 01:24:22,486
This is insane.

798
01:24:41,507 --> 01:24:43,668
Gentlemen, shall we?

799
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:46,811
One, two, three.

800
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:05,696
Where is she?

801
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:12,937
What have you done with her?

802
01:25:13,139 --> 01:25:15,308
She lives beyond the grace of God...

803
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:17,643
...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

804
01:25:17,743 --> 01:25:21,611
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

805
01:25:21,814 --> 01:25:24,817
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...

806
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:27,320
...but instead grow strong and become immortal...

807
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,460
...once infected by another nosferatu.

808
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:37,997
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

809
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:41,534
...but legions that go on age after age after age...

810
01:25:41,634 --> 01:25:44,674
...feeding on the blood of the living.

811
01:25:49,475 --> 01:25:52,342
Quickly, hide. Now.

812
01:26:29,348 --> 01:26:32,442
Come to me, Arthur.

813
01:26:32,652 --> 01:26:35,678
Leave these others and come to me.

814
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,730
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

815
01:26:40,893 --> 01:26:44,385
Kiss me and caress me...

816
01:26:44,597 --> 01:26:46,997
...my darling husband, please.

817
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:49,802
We wave Christ and His holy blood.

818
01:26:49,878 --> 01:26:54,118
We are strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

819
01:26:57,076 --> 01:26:59,316
The power of God is upon us.

820
01:27:11,057 --> 01:27:13,857
I bring you from shadow into light.

821
01:27:13,908 --> 01:27:17,108
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

822
01:27:17,128 --> 01:27:19,128
...into hell.

823
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:23,769
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

824
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:26,669
Take the stake in your left hand...

825
01:27:27,973 --> 01:27:30,693
...place the point over the heart.

826
01:27:34,513 --> 01:27:37,473
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now.

827
01:27:52,598 --> 01:27:57,592
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.

828
01:28:00,773 --> 01:28:03,298
Doctor?
- Ja?

829
01:28:03,509 --> 01:28:05,509
How did Lucy die?

830
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,280
Well...

831
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,852
Was she in great pain?

832
01:28:12,952 --> 01:28:15,655
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...

833
01:28:15,755 --> 01:28:18,991
...drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

834
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:22,356
Doctor. Please.

835
01:28:25,898 --> 01:28:28,059
So, Mr. Harker...

836
01:28:28,267 --> 01:28:31,387
...I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

837
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:35,841
...a sensitive question.

838
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:38,511
During your infidelity with those creatures...

839
01:28:38,611 --> 01:28:40,179
...those demonic women...

840
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:44,199
...did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

841
01:28:55,428 --> 01:28:56,529
Good.

842
01:28:56,629 --> 01:28:59,198
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...

843
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:02,178
...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

844
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:12,802
Doctor, you must understand.

845
01:29:14,547 --> 01:29:16,913
I doubted everything...

846
01:29:17,116 --> 01:29:18,784
...even my mind.

847
01:29:18,884 --> 01:29:20,884
I was impotent with fear.

848
01:29:21,086 --> 01:29:23,816
I know.
- But, sir...

849
01:29:24,023 --> 01:29:27,754
...I know where the bastard sleeps.

850
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,589
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

851
01:29:34,366 --> 01:29:37,961
Vampires do exist.

852
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:41,307
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

853
01:29:41,407 --> 01:29:43,976
...has the strength of 20 or more people...

854
01:29:44,076 --> 01:29:46,145
...and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

855
01:29:46,245 --> 01:29:49,382
But he can also control the meaner things of life...

856
01:29:49,482 --> 01:29:51,584
...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

857
01:29:51,684 --> 01:29:56,324
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

858
01:29:56,455 --> 01:29:58,524
Now, all these things Dracula can do...

859
01:29:58,624 --> 01:30:00,326
...but he is not free.

860
01:30:00,426 --> 01:30:03,829
He must rest in the sacred earth of
his homeland to gain his evil power.

861
01:30:03,929 --> 01:30:07,833
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.

862
01:30:07,933 --> 01:30:10,970
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.

863
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:13,710
How can you pity such a creature?

864
01:30:15,074 --> 01:30:16,509
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

865
01:30:16,609 --> 01:30:19,009
Good. You'll be safer there.

866
01:30:21,747 --> 01:30:24,116
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.

867
01:30:24,216 --> 01:30:27,620
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

868
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:31,800
Well, I wasn't planning on getting that close, Doc.

869
01:30:31,879 --> 01:30:33,879
Master.

870
01:30:50,209 --> 01:30:52,370
Dr. Jack.

871
01:30:52,578 --> 01:30:55,445
I've been promised eternal life.

872
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:00,390
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

873
01:31:00,586 --> 01:31:03,155
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

874
01:31:03,255 --> 01:31:06,349
Renfield? I must see him.

875
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,961
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

876
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:15,399
This is Mrs. Harker.

877
01:31:17,069 --> 01:31:20,800
Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

878
01:31:21,006 --> 01:31:23,726
It seems I've been rather naughty.

879
01:31:26,178 --> 01:31:28,178
I know you.

880
01:31:28,246 --> 01:31:30,966
You're the bride my master covets.

881
01:31:32,685 --> 01:31:35,313
I have a husband.

882
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:37,521
I am Mrs. Harker.

883
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:41,188
My master tells me about you.

884
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:44,361
What does he tell you?

885
01:31:44,797 --> 01:31:46,797
That he is coming.

886
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,180
That he is coming for you.

887
01:31:51,236 --> 01:31:53,236
Oh, please.

888
01:31:59,378 --> 01:32:01,378
Don't stay here.

889
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:06,376
Get away from these men, please.

890
01:32:07,786 --> 01:32:12,266
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.

891
01:32:15,361 --> 01:32:18,241
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

892
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:32,871
Master. Master.

893
01:32:33,078 --> 01:32:35,672
You promised me eternal life...

894
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:39,301
...but you give it to the pretty woman.

895
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:41,418
Dr. Jack.

896
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:43,587
I'm no lunatic man.

897
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:46,649
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul.

898
01:32:46,759 --> 01:32:50,696
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.

899
01:32:50,796 --> 01:32:52,796
Dr. Jack.

900
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:55,887
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

901
01:32:57,903 --> 01:33:00,383
You'll be completely safe here.

902
01:34:02,468 --> 01:34:06,068
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

903
01:34:06,171 --> 01:34:08,171
Leave him no refuge.

904
01:34:08,407 --> 01:34:10,637
Let the exorcism begin.

905
01:34:40,072 --> 01:34:43,064
You have betrayed me.

906
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:49,079
No, master.

907
01:34:53,252 --> 01:34:55,482
I serve you.

908
01:34:55,687 --> 01:34:58,520
I serve only you.

909
01:35:55,981 --> 01:35:59,075
Oh, yes, my love.

910
01:35:59,284 --> 01:36:01,650
You've found me.

911
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:07,256
My most precious life.

912
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:10,485
I have wanted this to happen.

913
01:36:10,696 --> 01:36:12,696
I know that now.

914
01:36:14,433 --> 01:36:17,869
I want to be with you always.

915
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:22,564
You cannot know what you are saying.

916
01:36:22,774 --> 01:36:24,774
Yes...

917
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:26,969
...I do know.

918
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:43,885
I feared I would never feel your touch again.

919
01:36:44,096 --> 01:36:46,096
I thought you were dead.

920
01:36:53,171 --> 01:36:57,198
There is no life in this body.

921
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,380
But you live.

922
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:07,050
You live.

923
01:37:08,654 --> 01:37:10,654
What are you?

924
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:14,984
I must know.
You must tell me.

925
01:37:22,334 --> 01:37:24,334
I am...

926
01:37:25,671 --> 01:37:27,935
...nothing.

927
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:30,140
Lifeless.

928
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:33,645
Soulless.
- What do you mean?

929
01:37:33,745 --> 01:37:36,612
Hated and feared.

930
01:37:37,849 --> 01:37:40,784
I am dead to all the world.

931
01:37:40,986 --> 01:37:42,986
Hear me.

932
01:37:44,856 --> 01:37:46,881
I am the monster...

933
01:37:47,092 --> 01:37:49,732
...that breathing men would kill.

934
01:37:50,529 --> 01:37:53,089
I am Dracula.

935
01:38:08,914 --> 01:38:11,041
You murdered Lucy.

936
01:38:24,262 --> 01:38:26,262
I love you.

937
01:38:27,532 --> 01:38:31,901
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

938
01:38:50,522 --> 01:38:53,116
I want to be what you are...

939
01:38:53,325 --> 01:38:54,726
...see what you see...

940
01:38:54,826 --> 01:38:56,826
...love what you love.

941
01:39:00,365 --> 01:39:02,856
To walk with me...

942
01:39:03,068 --> 01:39:06,348
...you must die to your breathing life...

943
01:39:06,443 --> 01:39:09,532
...and be reborn to mine.

944
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:12,904
You are my love...

945
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:15,705
...and my life always.

946
01:39:23,722 --> 01:39:25,524
Then...

947
01:39:25,624 --> 01:39:27,990
...I give you life eternal...

948
01:39:29,795 --> 01:39:31,795
...everlasting love...

949
01:39:33,365 --> 01:39:37,131
...the power of the storm...

950
01:39:37,335 --> 01:39:40,930
...and the beasts of the earth.

951
01:39:41,139 --> 01:39:43,266
Walk with me...

952
01:39:43,475 --> 01:39:47,138
...to be my loving wife forever.

953
01:39:47,345 --> 01:39:50,075
I will. Yes. Yes.

954
01:40:21,179 --> 01:40:24,080
Drink and join me...

955
01:40:25,183 --> 01:40:27,617
...in eternal life.

956
01:40:42,901 --> 01:40:44,901
I cannot let this be.

957
01:40:46,004 --> 01:40:49,269
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

958
01:40:49,474 --> 01:40:53,578
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...

959
01:40:53,678 --> 01:40:55,480
...for all eternity.

960
01:40:55,580 --> 01:41:00,279
I love you too much...

961
01:41:00,485 --> 01:41:01,953
...to condemn you.

962
01:41:02,053 --> 01:41:07,150
Then take me away from all this death.

963
01:42:04,449 --> 01:42:07,714
You think you can destroy me...

964
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:10,217
...with your idols?

965
01:42:13,225 --> 01:42:15,819
Sacred blood of Christ.

966
01:42:16,027 --> 01:42:18,894
I, who served the cross.

967
01:42:19,097 --> 01:42:21,395
I, who commanded nations...

968
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,669
...hundreds of years before you were born.

969
01:42:24,769 --> 01:42:26,849
Your armies were defeated.

970
01:42:26,944 --> 01:42:30,806
You tortured and impaled thousands of people.

971
01:42:31,009 --> 01:42:34,103
I was betrayed.

972
01:42:34,312 --> 01:42:37,213
Look what your God...

973
01:42:37,415 --> 01:42:40,111
...has done to me.

974
01:42:40,318 --> 01:42:45,038
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

975
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,095
Christ compels you.

976
01:42:50,195 --> 01:42:53,653
She is now...

977
01:42:53,865 --> 01:42:57,096
...my bride.

978
01:43:01,806 --> 01:43:03,806
More light.

979
01:43:04,876 --> 01:43:08,175
Light. More light.

980
01:43:15,887 --> 01:43:17,887
Unclean.

981
01:43:20,258 --> 01:43:21,426
Get them.
- This way.

982
01:43:21,526 --> 01:43:23,094
Get them.
- They must be found.

983
01:43:23,194 --> 01:43:24,262
Unclean.

984
01:43:24,362 --> 01:43:26,842
We have learned something much.

985
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:30,595
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

986
01:43:30,802 --> 01:43:33,862
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

987
01:43:34,072 --> 01:43:36,768
He is gone.

988
01:43:36,975 --> 01:43:39,205
How do you know?

989
01:43:39,411 --> 01:43:42,141
He speaks to me.

990
01:43:43,281 --> 01:43:46,401
He has a strong mind connection to you.

991
01:43:47,819 --> 01:43:51,739
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

992
01:43:52,023 --> 01:43:55,083
You admire him.
- Ja.

993
01:43:55,293 --> 01:43:59,525
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

994
01:43:59,731 --> 01:44:02,500
...and his mind was great and powerful...

995
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:05,604
...but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...

996
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:07,864
...and destroy him utterly.

997
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:10,740
Doctor?
- Ja?

998
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:17,341
I know that I am becoming like him.

999
01:44:17,549 --> 01:44:20,916
Your salvation is his destruction.

1000
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:24,782
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

1001
01:44:24,989 --> 01:44:29,027
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.

1002
01:44:29,127 --> 01:44:32,585
Please, help me find him.
Please.

1003
01:44:32,797 --> 01:44:35,129
Look into this light...

1004
01:44:35,333 --> 01:44:38,693
...the light of all light,
into this flame.

1005
01:44:39,104 --> 01:44:41,104
Your eyes are heavy.

1006
01:44:42,707 --> 01:44:45,369
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

1007
01:44:48,413 --> 01:44:52,179
Sleep.
- I must go to him.

1008
01:44:52,384 --> 01:44:54,682
He calls.

1009
01:44:54,886 --> 01:44:56,886
What do you hear?

1010
01:44:58,623 --> 01:45:01,023
What do you hear, child?

1011
01:45:02,127 --> 01:45:04,721
What do you hear?

1012
01:45:04,929 --> 01:45:08,956
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1013
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:13,661
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.

1014
01:45:13,872 --> 01:45:16,932
There he will grow strong again.

1015
01:45:17,142 --> 01:45:20,822
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.

1016
01:45:26,284 --> 01:45:31,189
We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...

1017
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:34,392
...no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.

1018
01:45:34,492 --> 01:45:38,861
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

1019
01:45:39,063 --> 01:45:42,734
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.

1020
01:45:42,834 --> 01:45:46,194
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

1021
01:45:47,005 --> 01:45:50,108
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.

1022
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:52,844
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...

1023
01:45:52,944 --> 01:45:54,746
...where we have posted a lookout...

1024
01:45:54,846 --> 01:45:57,682
...and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...

1025
01:45:57,782 --> 01:46:02,262
...where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.

1026
01:46:07,158 --> 01:46:10,252
Home. Home.

1027
01:46:20,071 --> 01:46:22,841
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...

1028
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:25,076
...and her blood is dying,
my friend.

1029
01:46:25,176 --> 01:46:27,176
It is no use.

1030
01:46:39,491 --> 01:46:42,794
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.

1031
01:46:42,894 --> 01:46:47,092
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1032
01:46:47,298 --> 01:46:49,960
Oh, what have I done to you?

1033
01:46:51,703 --> 01:46:54,831
No, I have done this to both of us.

1034
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:57,308
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

1035
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:59,408
He's calling me to him.

1036
01:47:04,082 --> 01:47:06,448
Stay with me. Please.

1037
01:47:06,651 --> 01:47:08,651
I am so cold.

1038
01:47:20,865 --> 01:47:22,300
All aboard.

1039
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:26,137
Noon. Holmwood received a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.

1040
01:47:26,237 --> 01:47:29,307
The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...

1041
01:47:29,407 --> 01:47:31,309
...to the northern port of Galatz.

1042
01:47:31,409 --> 01:47:34,537
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

1043
01:47:34,746 --> 01:47:37,214
How can we catch him now?

1044
01:47:45,223 --> 01:47:47,623
Varna. Galatz.

1045
01:47:47,825 --> 01:47:49,527
It's about 200 miles.

1046
01:47:49,627 --> 01:47:51,863
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

1047
01:47:51,963 --> 01:47:53,898
...reach him before he reaches the castle.

1048
01:47:53,998 --> 01:47:57,035
I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.

1049
01:47:57,135 --> 01:47:58,703
If we fail in our task...

1050
01:47:58,803 --> 01:48:01,283
...you will have to finish him.

1051
01:48:05,577 --> 01:48:08,913
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...

1052
01:48:09,013 --> 01:48:11,783
...and we continued on the train towards Galatz...

1053
01:48:11,883 --> 01:48:15,753
...where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.

1054
01:48:15,853 --> 01:48:20,552
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

1055
01:48:33,037 --> 01:48:34,873
I know this place.

1056
01:48:34,973 --> 01:48:37,742
The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1057
01:48:37,842 --> 01:48:39,744
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

1058
01:48:39,844 --> 01:48:42,278
No, we must go.

1059
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,480
He needs me.
We must go.

1060
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:50,620
We have passed Bistritza.

1061
01:48:50,688 --> 01:48:53,283
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1062
01:48:53,491 --> 01:48:57,295
We learned that his gypsies took charge
of the vampire's box at Galatz...

1063
01:48:57,395 --> 01:49:00,922
...and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

1064
01:49:16,881 --> 01:49:20,317
Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

1065
01:50:12,537 --> 01:50:15,577
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

1066
01:50:25,116 --> 01:50:29,036
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.

1067
01:50:29,153 --> 01:50:31,485
She told me.

1068
01:50:31,689 --> 01:50:34,681
I, too, know what men desire.

1069
01:50:51,375 --> 01:50:53,311
Will you cut off my head...

1070
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:55,380
...and drive a stake through my heart...

1071
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:59,160
...as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1072
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:06,360
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

1073
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:25,621
You are safe within the circle.

1074
01:51:25,743 --> 01:51:29,201
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

1075
01:51:29,413 --> 01:51:31,413
You're whores of Satan.

1076
01:51:35,019 --> 01:51:37,019
This is holy ground.

1077
01:51:37,155 --> 01:51:39,155
Leave this place now.

1078
01:51:40,992 --> 01:51:42,992
Leave.

1079
01:51:43,694 --> 01:51:46,497
In the name of God,
leave this ground.

1080
01:51:46,597 --> 01:51:49,477
I command you in the name of Christ.

1081
01:52:00,545 --> 01:52:03,446
Christ. Damn you.

1082
01:52:40,618 --> 01:52:42,618
Dracul.

1083
01:53:21,325 --> 01:53:23,325
You are...

1084
01:53:23,527 --> 01:53:25,791
...near.

1085
01:53:25,997 --> 01:53:27,997
My love.

1086
01:53:40,011 --> 01:53:41,445
They're racing against the sunset.

1087
01:53:41,545 --> 01:53:44,025
It may be too late.
God help us.

1088
01:54:24,956 --> 01:54:26,956
Harker, shoot.

1089
01:54:35,099 --> 01:54:37,099
Charge.

1090
01:57:18,462 --> 01:57:22,142
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1091
01:57:24,268 --> 01:57:26,268
Will you?

1092
01:57:31,842 --> 01:57:33,344
Wait.
- Let them go.

1093
01:57:33,444 --> 01:57:37,244
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

1094
01:57:38,048 --> 01:57:40,048
Hers has just begun.

1095
01:58:03,874 --> 01:58:06,570
We've all become God's madmen.

1096
01:58:09,079 --> 01:58:11,079
All of us.

1097
01:58:20,291 --> 01:58:24,022
Where is my God?

1098
01:58:24,228 --> 01:58:27,391
He has forsaken me.

1099
01:58:33,671 --> 01:58:36,902
It is finished.

1100
01:58:38,976 --> 01:58:40,976
My love.

1101
01:58:45,249 --> 01:58:47,249
My love.

1102
01:58:54,925 --> 01:58:57,485
There, in the presence of God...

1103
01:58:57,557 --> 01:59:00,498
...I understood at last how my love could release us all...

1104
01:59:00,598 --> 01:59:03,078
...from the powers of darkness.

1105
01:59:08,806 --> 01:59:11,366
Our love is stronger than death.

1106
01:59:19,617 --> 01:59:22,484
Give me peace.
