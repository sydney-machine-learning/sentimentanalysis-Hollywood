1
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,264
What is it?

2
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,564
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

3
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,692
Just pass me.

4
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,277
Pass me.

5
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,744
- Is it a cop?
- I can't see.

6
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,649
What the fuck
are these jokers playing at?

7
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,916
Oh, they ain't playing.
You better believe.

8
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,014
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

9
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,937
Okay. Hold on, you guys.

10
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,950
There's a truck, too.

11
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,136
Shit, it is a cop.

12
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,140
You better stop.

13
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:37,437
Okay, sit tight, you guys.
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

14
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,399
All right. We'll be all right.

15
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,317
Just relax.

16
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,773
Y'all think you can drive
any speed you want around here?

17
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,010
You had us scared to death, man.

18
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,112
Don't call me "man," Jew-boy.

19
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,613
No, sir. What should I call you?

20
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,741
You don't call me nothing,
nigger-loving Jew-boy. You just listen.

21
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,121
Yes, sir.

22
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,876
Hell, you even starting to smell
like a nigger, Jew-boy.

23
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,004
Take it easy. We'll be all right.

24
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,881
Sure you will, nigger-lover.

25
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,302
He's seen your face. That ain't good.
You don't want him seeing your face.

26
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,581
Oh, it don't make no difference no more.

27
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,088
Oh, shit! We into it now, boys!

28
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,716
You only left me a nigger,

29
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,259
but at least I shot me a nigger.

30
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,613
Yes, indeed.

31
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,932
Now listen, you communists
and niggers and Jews

32
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,893
Tell all your buddies
To spread the news

33
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,271
Your day of judgment
Will soon be nigh

34
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,942
As the Lord in his wisdom
Looks down from on high

35
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,070
Will his battle be lost
By mixing the races?

36
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,199
We want beautiful babies
Not ones with brown faces

37
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,118
Never, never
Never I say

38
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,037
For the Ku Klux Klan
Is here to stay

39
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,373
Never, never
Never I say

40
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,501
'Cause the Ku Klux Klan
Is here to stay

41
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,504
These Ku Kluxers are better
with lynchings than they are with lyrics.

42
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:13,202
Just read the file, Mr. Anderson.
I can do without the cabaret.

43
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,745
You don't like me much, do you, boss?

44
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,263
Sure I like you.

45
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,348
I just don't share your sense of humor.

46
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,477
Sometimes that's all you got left.

47
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,838
How long you been in the bureau?

48
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,021
Three years.

49
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,467
Right out of college, huh?

50
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,901
No. From the Justice Department.

51
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,321
Kennedy boy. Now I see.

52
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,158
No, I don't think you do see.

53
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,828
Let's get this thing straight.

54
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,373
I haven't had a pimple in years.
I shave every morning.

55
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,234
I even go to the bathroom by myself.

56
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,003
So you can quit this "boss" stuff.

57
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,756
They put me in charge
because I've been through this before.

58
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,342
- Birmingham? Montgomery?
- Oxford.

59
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,679
I was with Meredith at Ole Miss.

60
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,810
Got hit in the head with a brick,
so they gave you a promotion, right?

61
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,318
No. Shot in the shoulder.

62
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,688
Well, at least you lived.
That's important.

63
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,525
No, Meredith lived.
That's what's important.

64
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,951
What's got four eyes and can't see?

65
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,414
- What?
- Mississippi.

66
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,945
Never, never
Never I say

67
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,355
'Cause the Ku Klux Klan
Is here to...

68
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,582
Big building for a small town.

69
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,296
Howdy.

70
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,455
Good morning.

71
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,210
My name's Alan Ward. I'm with the FBI.

72
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,381
Federal Bureau of Integration?

73
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,469
In that get-up, you ain't exactly
undercover, are you, now?

74
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,081
We're here to see Sheriff Stuckey.

75
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,474
Sheriff's right busy now.

76
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,396
You'll have to wait
or come back some other time.

77
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,483
We'll wait.

78
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,915
Listen to me,
you backwoods shit-ass, you.

79
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,752
You got about two seconds
to get the sheriff out here,

80
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,504
or I'm gonna kick
the goddamned door in, okay?

81
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,371
Well, hell, looks like
we got some company.

82
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,706
Some Hoover boys come down to visit.

83
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,724
- How you doing?
- Good.

84
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,543
I'm Sheriff Stuckey.

85
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,769
Rupert Anderson.

86
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,756
- Rupert? We been expecting you.
- Uh-huh.

87
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,232
I assume you met my deputy, Mr. Pell?

88
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,109
Sure did.

89
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,237
You down here to help us solve
our nigger problems?

90
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,016
No. It's just a missing-person case.

91
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,909
Hmm. Well, come on.

92
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,689
Say, you gonna want your boy in on this?

93
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,998
Sheriff, I'm Special Agent Ward.

94
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,542
I'm in charge of this case.

95
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,338
We think it might be a little more serious
than missing persons.

96
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,882
I don't think so, boy.

97
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,385
In fact, you know what I think it is,
it's a publicity stunt

98
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,680
cooked up by that
Martin Luther King fella.

99
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,766
Come on.

100
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,032
At around 3:00 p.m., Deputy Pell says
he arrested the three boys for speeding.

101
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,828
He held them in jail until 10:00 p.m.,
and then released them.

102
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,579
They drove off.

103
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,233
He says he followed them
as far as the county line

104
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,085
and never saw them again.

105
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,129
Why didn't they make a phone call?

106
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,074
Why should they?

107
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,801
Mr. Anderson, these boys
were trained activists.

108
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,996
They're taught to check in every hour,

109
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,222
and if they're arrested, the moment
they're released from custody.

110
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,476
The hotel's two minutes from the jail.
They could have phoned from the lobby.

111
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,103
It just doesn't follow.

112
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,672
Maybe they went for a beer.

113
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,064
Not these boys.

114
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,734
The civil rights office in Rossville started
making calls as soon as they didn't check in.

115
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,656
The sheriff's office here said
they had no idea where the boys were.

116
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,658
First lie.

117
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,747
By who? The sheriff's office
or the civil rights office?

118
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,041
Who would you believe?

119
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,236
Mr. Ward, I don't know
if you knew it or not,

120
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,504
but I was a sheriff in a little
Mississippi town just like this.

121
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,073
Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. Anderson.

122
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,034
Well, lying just don't come into it.

123
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,827
We were right on the border,
10 miles from Memphis,

124
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,996
and a million miles
from the rest of the world.

125
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,098
Now, if a sheriff in a little town like this
says that's what happened,

126
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,392
then that's what happened.

127
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,935
Let's go eat.

128
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,896
We're full up right now, honey.
Y'all wanna wait a while?

129
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,246
Is the wait worth it?

130
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,875
We're not full for nothing, sugar.
Y'all want to look at a menu while you wait?

131
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,668
- Sure.
- Thank you.

132
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,963
Well, what y'all gonna do,
wait or leave?

133
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,009
We're gonna wait because
we want to be near you.

134
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,511
There's some empty seats down there.

135
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,055
Uh, Mr. Ward.

136
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,017
That's the colored down there.
Don't even think about it.

137
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,337
There's some people over here
getting ready to leave right now.

138
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,688
Aren't you hungry, Mr. Anderson?

139
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,867
Good afternoon. Looks good.

140
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,547
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

141
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,925
I'm looking for some information.

142
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,747
I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir.

143
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,390
Just a few questions.

144
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,439
I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir.

145
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,819
Three civil rights boys came here

146
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,046
to propose setting up a voter
registration clinic.

147
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,633
Before the locals got a chance to say yes,
the Klan burned them down.

148
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,011
Give a man a vote,
but don't let him use it.

149
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,080
That's the way it works.

150
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,056
What'd their office in Rossville
have to say?

151
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,894
They confirmed that the boys came back
here to apologize to the congregation.

152
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,548
Sorry you folks didn't get to vote.

153
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,900
I suppose most of you never knew
you even had one.

154
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,903
Now you got no place to go on Sunday.

155
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,951
Apparently, after they came back here,
they talked to some locals down the road.

156
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,520
I think that's where we should start.

157
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,399
Well, you can talk to them,
but they won't talk to you.

158
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,778
These people have to live here
long after we're packed up and gone.

159
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,795
They'd rather bite
their tongue off than talk to us.

160
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,381
Bureau procedure, Mr. Anderson.

161
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:42,060
The church caught fire
and you ran home, is that correct?

162
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,020
Yes, sir.

163
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,966
Then the four white men stopped you?

164
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,399
Yes, sir.

165
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,152
These four white men
attacked your husband?

166
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,863
Yes, sir.

167
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,991
But you can't identify them?

168
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,453
No, sir.

169
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,857
Did you report this to the police?

170
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,917
No, sir.

171
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,988
But you told
the civil rights boys what happened?

172
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,671
Yes, sir.

173
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:16,135
Ma'am, did they tell you where they
were going after that?

174
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,556
No, sir.

175
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,584
Nothing?

176
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,685
No, sir.

177
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,940
All right. Thank you, ma'am.

178
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,025
You're welcome.

179
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,331
Come on, boy.

180
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,833
Open up.

181
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,945
Your brother Hollis here?

182
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,129
Yes, sir.

183
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,714
Well, wake his ass up.
We want to see him.

184
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,675
- Why?
- Just wake him up, boy.

185
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,952
Why? What's the matter?

186
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,386
There you are!

187
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,765
Come here, boy!

188
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,334
Hollis!

189
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,396
Get your ass back here,
you fucking nigger!

190
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,274
Hollis! Hollis!

191
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,115
Shit!

192
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,417
We better not catch you
talking to the FBI.

193
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,669
You'll be dead, boy.

194
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,356
You admire these kids, don't you?

195
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,775
Don't you?

196
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,529
I think they're being used.

197
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,783
I think they're sent down here in their
Volkswagens and their sneakers,

198
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,744
just to get their heads cracked open.

199
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,331
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
they believed in what they were doing?

200
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,609
Did it ever occur to them
they were gonna end up dead?

201
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,001
Maybe.

202
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,796
In Washington they sure as hell knew,
didn't they?

203
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,174
Some things are worth dying for.

204
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,305
Down here they see
things a little differently.

205
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,726
People down here
feel some things are worth killing for.

206
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,442
Where does it come from,
all this hatred?

207
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,822
You know, when I was a little boy,

208
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,284
an old Negro farmer lived
down the road, name of Monroe.

209
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,662
And he was, uh...

210
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,583
I guess he was luckier
than my daddy was.

211
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,673
He bought himself a mule.

212
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,177
That was a big deal around that town.

213
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,138
My daddy hated that mule.

214
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,458
His friends always kidded him about

215
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,686
Monroe plowing with his new mule.

216
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,941
And Monroe was gonna rent another
field now that he had a mule.

217
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,696
One morning that mule
just showed up dead.

218
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,158
They poisoned the water.

219
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,413
After that, the mule
wasn't mentioned to my daddy.

220
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,707
Just never came up.

221
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,548
Once, driving along, we passed
Monroe's place and it was empty.

222
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,051
He packed and left.
Gone up north or something.

223
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,391
I looked over at my daddy's face

224
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,103
and I knew he'd done it.

225
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,566
He saw that I knew. He was ashamed.

226
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,028
I guess he was ashamed.

227
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,906
He looked at me and he said,

228
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,577
"If you ain't better than a nigger,
who are you better than?"

229
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,816
You think that's an excuse?

230
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,669
No. It's just a story about my daddy.

231
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,911
Where's that leave you?

232
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,763
With an old man so full of hate

233
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:33,476
that he didn't know being poor
was what was killing him.

234
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,944
Get the light! Get the light!

235
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,448
You all right?

236
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,294
I guess they know we're here.

237
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,250
Now you know what you're getting into.

238
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,002
I'll call Washington.
I need more agents.

239
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,006
Make any difference if I say
it's the wrong thing to do?

240
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,675
No.

241
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,350
The whole place for $75 a month.

242
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,645
It's private. It's central.
It's perfect.

243
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,024
There's room for 100 more agents.
200, maybe.

244
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,234
More on the balcony.

245
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,138
We're trying to find
the boys, Mr. Anderson.

246
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,281
I'll take all the help I can get.

247
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,534
When's the show start?

248
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,451
Who's the big shot?

249
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,051
That's the Klan.

250
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,681
No pointy hats,
but plenty of pointy heads.

251
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,226
Let me run a check on the plates.

252
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,009
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

253
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,468
Anderson.

254
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,429
Say hello to our mayor, Mr. Tilman.

255
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,457
How do you do, Anderson?

256
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,349
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Barber.

257
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,978
This looks like the place to be.

258
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,272
Even for me.

259
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,943
Nothing like a barber shop
for jawing your socks off.

260
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,764
Where you from, Anderson?

261
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,406
Thornton, Mississippi, sir.

262
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,325
Just a spit from Tennessee.

263
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,037
Then you must know
how we all feel down here.

264
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,874
We don't take to outsiders
telling us how to live.

265
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,170
Our nigras were happy,
till those beatnik college kids

266
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,716
came here stirring things up.
Before that, nobody complained.

267
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,677
Nobody dared.

268
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,349
We got a peaceful community, Anderson.

269
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,395
They're like other folks, I reckon.
You push them too far...

270
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:33,317
The way I figure it, it's like
three sticks of old dynamite.

271
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:38,530
You shake it up, and we'll be
scraping bodies off the street.

272
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:43,619
I'm here to investigate the missing
three kids, ask questions.

273
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:48,957
If this all boiled down to gravy,
there's not enough for a chicken-fried steak.

274
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,629
Them kids you're looking for?
I'll bet you a shiny new dime

275
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,491
they're sitting in Chicago

276
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,160
drinking a cold beer
and having a big laugh

277
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,178
about all the commotion.

278
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,888
Sure hope so.

279
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,724
You tell your bosses

280
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,269
people got the wrong idea
about the South.

281
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,605
You know what I'm talking about.

282
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,317
Everybody running around
ragged, backwards, illiterate,

283
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,279
eating sow-belly and corn pone
three times a day.

284
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:23,450
Simple fact is, Anderson,
we got two cultures down here.

285
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,204
White culture, and the colored culture.

286
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,566
That's the way it always has been.

287
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,792
That's the way it always will be.

288
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,070
Rest of America don't see that.

289
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,463
America don't mean jack shit.

290
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,882
You in Mississippi now.

291
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,228
Oh, that's for sure.

292
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,707
What's the score?

293
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,641
St. Louis on top, five to nothing.

294
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,044
What inning is it?

295
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,394
Bottom of the seventh.

296
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,339
You like baseball, Anderson?

297
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,106
Yeah, I do. You know,

298
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:00,821
it's the only time a black man
can wave a stick at a white man

299
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,365
and not start a riot.

300
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,716
Sir?

301
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,012
We checked on the plate, sir.
Clayton Townley.

302
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,266
Grand Wizard of the White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

303
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,227
That's him.
And we have a lead on the car.

304
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,605
A Choctaw thinks he knows where it is.

305
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,049
I'm waiting for a call.

306
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,357
Good.

307
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,860
You have your appointment
for next Tuesday, right?

308
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,420
See you then. Bye-bye.

309
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,737
You gonna go to...

310
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,824
Afternoon, ladies.

311
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,409
Can I help you?

312
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:34,331
Well, yes, you can.
I tell you, I hate the way I look.

313
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:39,711
What do you think? A permanent wave,
maybe? Or a bleach job?

314
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,048
That looks good.
You have that done here?

315
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,492
Jackson.

316
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,801
A wig's your only hope.

317
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,538
You won't be able to do much
with that cue ball.

318
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,973
Thank you.

319
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,227
If you wanna ask questions,
here's where you'll hear it all.

320
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,230
Well, matter of fact, I do.

321
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,650
Who's that gentleman that just drove in?

322
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,636
I know that isn't President Johnson.

323
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,196
Clayton Townley.

324
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,266
Are you one of them FBI gentlemen?

325
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,158
Yes, ma'am, I am.

326
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,521
I think it's a shame
those two kids are dead,

327
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,581
but I hope you find them.

328
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,835
Actually, it's three kids missing.
A colored kid also.

329
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:24,798
You honestly think you'd be here
if it weren't for the white boys?

330
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,758
- Maybe not, Miss...
- Mrs.

331
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,262
Pell. Her old man's
Ray Stuckey's deputy.

332
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,460
But I'm single.

333
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,980
Look out! Here they come!

334
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,116
Hollis?

335
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,039
Get back. Move out of the way.

336
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,545
It's a local problem.

337
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,007
We'll handle it!
We don't need your damn help!

338
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:14,681
It ain't right having blood on Main Street.
How'd that look on TV?

339
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,266
- Okay, easy.
- Get up.

340
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,253
I got him.

341
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,103
Get out of the way, now.

342
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,008
He's from the diner.

343
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,861
Think before you talk
to colored kids with an audience.

344
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,073
They're sending a message from Tupelo.

345
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,743
I know it, yes.
Clayton Townley, chief pointy head.

346
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,496
That's right. How did you know?

347
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,816
Bureau procedure. Try it sometime.

348
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,541
We did!

349
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,586
We found the car the kids were driving.

350
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,836
Good morning.

351
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,346
Good morning.

352
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,057
Two beer cans, a Coca Cola bottle,
green plastic bottle,

353
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,560
badly burned wristwatch
stopped at 12:45, set of keys.

354
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,213
No bodies.

355
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,772
I want the entire area searched.

356
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,091
Every inch.

357
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,358
Yes, sir.

358
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,719
It's a big swamp.

359
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,694
Every inch, Mr. Bird.

360
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,951
I guess they never left Mississippi.

361
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:25,539
Yeah, they're dead. They're dead.

362
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,275
Mr. Bird?

363
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,959
Yes, sir?

364
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,670
There's a telephone at the truck stop.

365
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:36,883
Get to it, get on it and get me
100 more men here by morning.

366
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,927
- 100?
- 100.

367
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,705
Bureau people?

368
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,347
It could be the goddamn army!

369
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,500
I want this entire swamp searched.

370
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,809
Yes, sir.

371
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,399
Don't do it, Mr. Ward.
You'll just start a war.

372
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,153
It was a war long before we got here.

373
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,271
You too!

374
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,371
Wake up! Come on!

375
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,380
Get the fuck out of here, nigger! Go on!

376
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,171
Sir?

377
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,427
The sheriff's alibi is solid.
He was playing poker with relatives.

378
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,746
The whole time?

379
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,683
No, for three hours. He lost $11.38.

380
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,919
Another thing, sir.

381
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,896
We're having trouble with
the motel manager.

382
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,215
What trouble?

383
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,357
He wants us out.

384
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,427
He says we're bad for business.

385
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,319
Buy it.

386
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,196
Sorry, sir?

387
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,156
Buy it!

388
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,117
The motel.

389
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,853
How high can I go?

390
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,745
Whatever it takes.

391
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,963
Today in Jessup County,

392
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,815
amidst the violence
erupting here this week,

393
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,969
the nation's fixed on the search

394
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,070
for the missing civil rights workers.

395
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,806
I think it's a hoax.

396
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:49,409
But if they are in that swamp,
then they asked for it.

397
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:53,246
Naval reserves are in
to join scores of FBI agents

398
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,457
in their search for the men.

399
00:38:55,666 --> 00:39:00,211
They planned the whole thing.
They're in New York laughing at us.

400
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,489
You think it's a hoax?

401
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,425
Yeah. They ain't gonna find nothing.

402
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:10,096
Civil rights leaders are optimistic
as to the men's whereabouts,

403
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:14,601
but privately, there is concern
they will ever be found alive.

404
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,354
They looked for trouble and found it.

405
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:21,941
This is Marek Barlbobi, Network News.
Jessup County, Mississippi.

406
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,486
Sheriff Stuckey?

407
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,615
They ought to be looking up in Canada
for them boys

408
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,326
instead of our swamps here.

409
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:37,123
Also, I think it's a publicity stunt
dreamed up by these NAACP people.

410
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,526
NAACP?

411
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,918
Yeah, NAACP.

412
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:45,173
It stands for niggers, alligators, apes,
coons and possums.

413
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,218
Tell you what you got.
You got your NAACP,

414
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:51,846
you got your SNCC, your COFO...

415
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,015
You know what that mess is?

416
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,560
B-U-L-L-S-H-l-T. You got it?

417
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,522
Sheriff, will this be a federal case?

418
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,927
There'll be a time
when we don't gotta say,

419
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,529
"Good morning, sir, Mr. Sheriff."

420
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:12,325
There'll be a time when we won't
have to say, "Mr. Stuckey."

421
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,913
There'll be a time when we just say
"Stuckey" or "Sheriff."

422
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:21,418
There'll be a time when the sheriff
won't even be a white man.

423
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,347
Hello.

424
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,854
Could I ask you a few questions?

425
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,899
I don't suppose you know
what kind of flower these are?

426
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,903
I been seeing them all over the place.

427
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,407
I never saw such a darn pretty plant.

428
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,311
They're trumpet pitchers.

429
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,203
Trumpet pitchers.

430
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,373
They're beautiful. They really are.

431
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,960
They don't smell so good,
but they're pretty.

432
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,409
It's nice talking to you.

433
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,552
Sorry about interrupting your meeting,

434
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,122
but nobody will talk to us.

435
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,515
They "zip up," like my mama used to say.

436
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:22,103
People don't want to talk
for fear it'll get back to the law.

437
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,090
We are the law.

438
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,523
Not around here.

439
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,694
We were sent to find out
what happened to those three boys.

440
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,807
They were here to help you.

441
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,908
It ain't us you should talk to.

442
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,520
Who should we be talking to?

443
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,162
Come on, Aaron.

444
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,500
Start with the sheriff's office.

445
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,154
Why ain't you afraid?

446
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,614
How come you ain't?

447
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,923
Aaron.

448
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,635
Aaron? Come on, son.

449
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,610
Here's the pitch.
Swing and a line-drive base hit.

450
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,612
Another runner's home.

451
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,285
On to the next pitch
by the ruffled Bob Gibson.

452
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:24,541
Ron Hunt singled to center.
Hickman scored the Mets' second run.

453
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,961
Hunt holds on at first.
Mets now lead 2 to 1.

454
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:32,090
The next one up will be Joe Christopher
who struck out and popped out to Boyer.

455
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:37,804
He's 0 for 2, and hitting a mere.252...

456
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,836
Good evening, Mrs. Pell.
I'm Agent Ward. He's Agent Anderson.

457
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,814
We're with the FBI.
Is your husband home?

458
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,343
We'd like to have a word with him.

459
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,903
Y'all come in, then.

460
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,330
The FBI gentlemen
want to ask you some more questions.

461
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,166
Want me to put your dinner in the oven?

462
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,337
Leave us alone?

463
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,465
Mind if I take a seat?

464
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,014
Why you gotta bother me at home?

465
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,418
Well, I wanted to run through,
once again,

466
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,394
your movements on June 21 st.

467
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,645
June which?

468
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,258
June 21 st.

469
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,110
Now, deputy, we both know
what day we're talking about.

470
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,698
Let's be civilized and the sooner
you can get back to your game

471
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,575
and we can return to DC.

472
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,588
Please, don't let me interrupt you.

473
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,283
It's just when you've heard a question

474
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,677
asked a dozen times, it gets boring.

475
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,639
Yeah, I guess so.

476
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,798
You don't eat together?

477
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,482
He works funny hours.

478
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,319
You think that's odd?

479
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,904
No.

480
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,199
I work funny hours myself.

481
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,037
I eat when I'm hungry,
he eats when he can.

482
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,582
- Can I get you something?
- No, thanks.

483
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,002
Nice house.
How long have you lived here?

484
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,046
I was born here.

485
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,841
But my father lost the house
in a poker game a long time ago.

486
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,596
We've been paying rent ever since.

487
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,559
It's a wicked game.

488
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,481
Poker.

489
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,109
Wicked.

490
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,861
Mr. Anderson?

491
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,450
It was nice talking to you.
Guess I gotta go.

492
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,525
Pork chops still any good?
Bring me a beer?

493
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,959
Good night.

494
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,797
Get back to baseball.
You know what they say?

495
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,618
The only game a black man
can wave a stick...

496
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,969
I already heard that one.

497
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,602
Fifty minutes
of his alibi hinges on his wife.

498
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,464
What's she like?

499
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,939
She's a nice lady.

500
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,693
Tell me, how does
a woman like that end up...

501
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,653
With Shithead in there?

502
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:45,199
You know what small towns are like.
A girl spends high school

503
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,954
looking for a guy to marry,
then her whole life figuring out why.

504
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,790
Something's wrong. He's too confident.

505
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,585
Did you see the wedding photograph?

506
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:59,406
His three usher pals
hooked their thumbs in their belts

507
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,924
with three fingers pointing down.

508
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,845
So, what is that?
Some sort of Masonic thing?

509
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,015
KKK.

510
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,048
I know you ain't drunk. I won't argue.

511
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,524
I'm not drunk.

512
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,945
I'll take you
where you can sleep it off.

513
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,573
All right. Hold up.

514
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,411
- Who's driving?
- Watch your head.

515
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,842
Hi.

516
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,971
There was a couple things
I need to check with you.

517
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,166
My husband's not here.

518
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,976
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

519
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,144
Me?

520
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,357
Well, you better come in, then.

521
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,445
Just take a minute.

522
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,782
My boss, he's kind of a pain.
College kid.

523
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,619
He has to dot all the i's,
cross all the t's.

524
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,522
What do you want to ask me about?

525
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,456
It's a time thing.

526
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,526
A few things we're not clear about...

527
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,670
Should I put your flowers in water?

528
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,755
Actually, they're for you.

529
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,910
They're beautiful.

530
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,802
They are pretty, aren't they?

531
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,805
Don't smell nice, but they're pretty.

532
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,335
Would you like anything? Some tea?

533
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,935
Yeah, I would. Thanks.

534
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,579
Oh, don't look at that.
It's a terrible photo.

535
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,498
Oh, I don't know about that.

536
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,360
Is this recent?

537
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,336
No. I wish.

538
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,365
Well, this sure looks recent to me.

539
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,716
We were married 14 years ago.

540
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,995
Are you kidding me?
No, that... Come on!

541
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,540
You take sugar?

542
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,765
Sure do.

543
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,211
I grew up in a town like this.

544
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,520
You were smart enough to leave.

545
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,757
Why didn't you?

546
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,900
"For better or for worse."

547
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,406
How about you? Are you married?

548
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,741
Two.

549
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,286
Well, I was, as I remember.

550
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,414
It didn't last very long.
I was never home.

551
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,377
I guess she got fed up
with phone calls from Miami

552
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,213
and postcards from Des Moines.

553
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,840
There was always a guy around.

554
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:34,971
Any guy that could spare the time
for a movie or a beer

555
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,264
or a quarter for the jukebox.

556
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,560
She left.

557
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,134
How about you?

558
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,111
Oh, you know the South, Mr. Anderson.

559
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,824
You graduate and marry
the first boy that makes you laugh.

560
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,159
Your husband's quite a guy.

561
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,833
You know, my boss has
this thing about an hour,

562
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:08,421
50 minutes to be exact,
that your husband says he was with you.

563
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,135
And I guess he was.

564
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,012
Guess he was.

565
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,058
Well, that's a pity.

566
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:27,273
That means I don't have an excuse
for hanging around here anymore.

567
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,693
Well...

568
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,680
Thank you for the iced tea.

569
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,448
Thank you for the flowers.

570
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,824
Sure.

571
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,620
Do you know what kind they are?

572
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,025
They're called trumpet pitchers.

573
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,333
Oh, that's right.

574
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:50,463
My daddy called them ladies from hell
because they're car...

575
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,199
Carnivorous.

576
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,716
That's the word?

577
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,828
See, that pretty color's the bait.

578
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,831
Insects home in, and they're dead

579
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,558
even before they got their shoes off.

580
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,881
Should've picked something fitting.

581
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,648
Maybe.

582
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,210
May the peace and the joy
in the Holy Ghost

583
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,354
abide with you for now
and forever. Amen.

584
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,637
He sure did preach
a good sermon today.

585
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,910
You already been told once, nigger!

586
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,303
We don't want to tell you again!

587
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:48,557
You flap them bootlips off
to any of them federal men,

588
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,628
we'll put you in the ground, boy.

589
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,104
And that's without a pine box!

590
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,483
You understand me?

591
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,498
How are Negroes treated in Mississippi?

592
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:17,002
They're treated about fair.
About as good as they ought to be.

593
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:27,554
If you ask me, niggers here have been
treated bad for a long time.

594
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,277
I think Martin Luther King's
one of the leaders.

595
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,280
J. Edgar Hoover said he was a Communist.

596
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:48,617
They had proof to that effect,
but I don't know for sure.

597
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,370
But that's what they say.

598
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,303
You wanna find that nigger?

599
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:12,850
They say we've got to eat together
and use the same bathrooms as the niggers.

600
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,228
That's hard for some
Mississippi folks to do.

601
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:20,316
They're not like us.
They don't take baths. They stink.

602
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,234
They... They're nasty.

603
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,903
They just not like white folks.

604
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,812
What do you think happened to them?

605
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,705
Dead.

606
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,167
Just as dead as they can be.

607
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,961
Feels so good.

608
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,591
Is she asleep? Is she?

609
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,430
I'm sorry I woke you up.

610
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,501
Bye, hon. I'll be a couple hours.

611
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,684
All right.

612
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,271
Well, Mary, is that your Betsy's kid?

613
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,359
Yeah, she's growing up
real quick, isn't she?

614
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,656
Come on.

615
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,245
Tuesday will be just fine on those.

616
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,044
Funny.

617
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,840
Their kids are so cute.

618
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,557
- Here we go.
- That back on me again?

619
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:39,645
If the Secret Service
couldn't protect the president,

620
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,649
how the hell are we supposed
to protect a few nigras?

621
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:48,612
It ain't nothing but low-life white trash
drinking too much alcohol.

622
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:53,450
More like paint thinner,
because this state's as dry as a martini.

623
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,828
We got the drunks to prove it.

624
00:56:57,214 --> 00:57:01,401
Give me a little room here.
Excuse me. Excuse me, Bob.

625
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,946
- Is this okay?
- Your name, please?

626
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,714
Clayton Townley, local businessman.

627
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,969
Are you a spokesman for
the White Knights of the KKK?

628
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,305
I told you. I'm a businessman.

629
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,017
I'm also a Mississippian
and an American.

630
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:22,354
I'm sick and tired
of the way Mississippians

631
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,983
are having our views distorted
by you media people.

632
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,193
So let's get this straight.

633
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:32,030
We do not accept Jews
because they reject Christ.

634
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:37,369
Their control of international banking
cartels are at the root of Communism.

635
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:41,165
We do not accept papists
who bow to a Roman dictator.

636
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,169
We don't accept Turks,
Mongols, Tartars, Orientals or Negroes.

637
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:50,817
We're here to protect Anglo-Saxon
democracy and the American way.

638
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,751
Thank you, sir.

639
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:59,391
Lester, you are living proof
that cousins shouldn't fuck.

640
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,855
There's this colored boy.

641
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,233
He wants to play football
for Bear Bryant.

642
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,929
Bear says, "I'll give you a tryout."

643
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,196
What color was he?

644
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,199
What's he gonna run with? A watermelon?

645
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,327
And he'll keep on running too.

646
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,455
He says, "Get down there
on one goal line."

647
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,458
The other team's on the other goal line.

648
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,319
He throws the boy the ball...

649
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,910
Are you open?

650
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,761
You gotta be a member to drink here.

651
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,804
Member?

652
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,182
A member of what?

653
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,605
Member of the social club.

654
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,732
Thought you'd buy me a beer.

655
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,778
Give him a beer, Frank.

656
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,243
Nice to be back in a dry county again.

657
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,412
When I was sheriff,
half my take-home pay

658
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:07,543
was from collecting taxes on illegal jukes.
Works the same here.

659
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:12,005
You haul in a tidy penny here,
winking at the bootleggers.

660
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,033
I wouldn't know nothing about that.

661
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,968
Yeah.

662
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,719
A tidy penny.

663
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,625
Got anything stronger, deputy?

664
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,434
No, we ain't.

665
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:30,482
Oh. In Thornton, Mississippi,
there's a joy juice still in every yard.

666
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:36,488
All you need is corn, sugar,
and a pot to boil it in.

667
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,367
I tried to take this boy's fingerprints.

668
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,161
He had his hands in a mash barrel.

669
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,164
There was no skin. He had no prints.

670
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,918
We ain't interested in your
Mississippi stories.

671
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,113
You ain't from here no more.

672
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,716
Why'd you leave, anyway?

673
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,428
Well, I just wanted a change of scenery.

674
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,725
Grits started leaving
a bad taste in my mouth.

675
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:10,772
If that's how you feel, Mr. FBI Man,
why don't you get the hell out?

676
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,734
Go back to your Commie,
nigger-loving boss.

677
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,653
You must not know my boss, Mr. Hoover.

678
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,324
He's not too fond of Commies.
He'd be on your side.

679
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:24,369
I don't give two shits
whose side he's on.

680
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:29,541
We got 5,000 niggers in this county
who ain't registered to vote yet.

681
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,586
And they never will.

682
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:39,343
Tell your stiff suits in Washington, D.C,
that they ain't gonna change us

683
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:43,706
unless it's over my dead body.
Or a lot of dead niggers.

684
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,812
You'd kill? Is that what you're saying?

685
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:55,233
I wouldn't think twice about it.

686
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,862
No court in Mississippi
would convict me for it.

687
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,908
How about you, deputy?
How are you with wringing necks?

688
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,577
Keep pushing me, Hoover boy.

689
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,996
You get this straight, you fucker!

690
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:13,293
Tell your queer nigger bosses
they ain't gonna find civil righters here.

691
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,657
Pack your bags and head back
up north where you belong.

692
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:25,681
You get this straight, shitkicker,
don't you mistake me for somebody else.

693
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,334
You got brains in your dick.

694
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,019
We'll be here till it's finished.

695
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,440
How about you, Deputy?

696
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,111
Is that gun just for show?

697
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,781
Or do you get to shoot
people once in a while?

698
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,957
Thanks for the beer.

699
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,800
Ask them if they wanna
help save this country

700
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,886
from the onslaught of integration.

701
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:09,599
They want to throw white children
and colored children

702
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,602
into the melting pot of integration

703
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,313
out of which will come a conglomerated

704
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:18,316
mulato, mongrel class of people!

705
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,862
Both races will be destroyed.

706
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:27,200
I, for one, under God
will die before I'll yield one inch

707
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,728
to that kind of a movement in America.

708
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,291
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused.

709
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,296
They've been on the radio all day,
talking about FBI intimidation.

710
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:43,216
We're not thugs, Mr. Anderson.
We'll do this my way!

711
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,827
I know, bureau procedure.

712
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,429
What the hell were you doing
at the beauty parlor?

713
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:51,683
If that's Bureau business,
I want to know.

714
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,086
Do you understand me?

715
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,394
Get in here!

716
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,690
Know what your problem is?

717
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,360
You don't know when to speak
and when to shut up!

718
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,531
Mrs. Pell ain't gonna say anything!

719
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,700
I'm not gonna choke it out!

720
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,246
This can of worms only
opens from the inside.

721
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,045
I know that.

722
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,766
Freedom! Freedom!

723
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,736
White nigger!

724
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,034
Hurry up!

725
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,217
- Hi.
- Hey, now.

726
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,554
Just passing by and saying hello.

727
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,082
You're not out watching the parade?

728
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,975
How come you didn't ask me
any questions?

729
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,644
Everybody's been asked except me.

730
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,818
Why don't you send some cute
FBI boys to talk to me?

731
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,488
Sorry about the intrusion.

732
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,850
Pecan?

733
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,409
I'm sick of pecans.

734
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,370
Freedom! Freedom!

735
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,266
You willing to stand up and fight?

736
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:21,750
Yes! Yes!

737
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:39,559
Freedom! Freedom!

738
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:45,857
Equality! Equality!

739
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,702
How'd you find out about this?

740
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,607
Bureau procedure, Mr. Ward.

741
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,220
Sheriff Stuckey.

742
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,973
He got his phone call.

743
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,019
Wonder who else was called.

744
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,773
Where're you going, boy?

745
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,151
Go on. Go on, get out of here.

746
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,086
Here they come.

747
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,304
Come on. Let's go.

748
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,765
We'll wait until they go inside.

749
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,085
Get him!

750
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,733
Get him in the truck now!

751
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,152
Get inside, you sons of bitches.

752
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,681
Let's go!

753
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,449
Wait until they're inside!

754
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,123
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

755
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,694
- Turn left.
- How come?

756
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,238
Don't know, just turn left.

757
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,035
There's the truck.

758
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,621
Go up that little road.

759
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,544
Stop. Stop right here.

760
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,747
What's wrong with these people?

761
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:44,262
Mrs. Walker, I know this is difficult,
but I need your help.

762
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,183
If you could persuade your son
to press charges

763
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,769
then we could pick up
the deputy right away.

764
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,272
He won't talk to no one.

765
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,383
It won't do no good anyway.

766
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,318
I promise it will.

767
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,612
Leave him alone.

768
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:03,531
Maybe then, they'll let us alone.

769
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,629
If this is a pattern,

770
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:21,674
at least we know what happened
on June 21 st.

771
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,470
Pell stopped the boys
for speeding at 3:00.

772
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,806
He held them while the Klan
got organized.

773
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,059
He released them at 10:30.

774
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:33,603
By then, his buddies were ready.

775
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,549
I think he went with them.

776
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,149
You think he'll crack?

777
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,653
Down here, rattlesnakes
don't commit suicide.

778
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:55,667
Did you release the three
civil rights workers to the Klan

779
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,585
on the night of June 21 st?

780
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,405
No.

781
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,674
- Are you a member of the Klan?
- No.

782
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,077
Were you ever a member?

783
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,678
No.

784
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:09,999
Do you know the term Grand Cyclops?

785
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,625
I've heard of it.

786
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:15,838
Were you the Grand Cyclops
of the Mississippi Klavern

787
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:19,175
of the White Knights
for the past three years?

788
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:23,236
Objection. He said he's
not a member of the Klan.

789
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:28,408
Objection? This is just an interview.
No need to be so formal.

790
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,577
Then I don't have to stay here, do I?

791
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,705
I got work to do.

792
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,376
You do, too.

793
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,713
Yes, sir. And you can be sure
we'll do it.

794
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:43,715
Good luck.

795
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,428
You get enough to indict me,
you know where I am.

796
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,225
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

797
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,769
Don't you worry about a thing.

798
01:11:58,158 --> 01:11:59,772
Are you gonna be indicted?

799
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,483
Does the FBI have evidence?

800
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,887
Are you cooperating
in this investigation?

801
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,030
Yes, just like we've done all along.

802
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:13,578
Sir, could you not do that, please?
Do not do that, please!

803
01:12:16,063 --> 01:12:17,282
Get the fuck out of here!

804
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:24,255
We have to tell you again?
Go back where you belong!

805
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,257
Get out of my face!

806
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,218
Get out and leave us alone!

807
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,140
Go home! You're gonna get hurt now.

808
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,854
This is getting to be more
than we can take!

809
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,423
I can't take this.

810
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:42,716
Not now, sir.

811
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:43,816
Just a minute.

812
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,820
I resent your pursuit of my department!

813
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,532
You keep implicating them
in these disappearances

814
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:56,454
but there's no evidence that they
were involved with any crime!

815
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,415
We want the truth! It's frustrating!

816
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,960
Anyone can point a finger.
That ain't evidence!

817
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:07,131
Us old cotton-choppers still
believe in democracy!

818
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,676
And we know our rights!

819
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,763
You do.
I'll bet a cotton-chopping dollar on it.

820
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:19,685
Anderson, you're so far up my nose
I can feel your boots on my chin.

821
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:25,400
I'm telling you again, a couple
of crazies dressed in bed sheets

822
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:29,028
dancing around scaring Negroes
is not the fault

823
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,806
of the entire state!

824
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,825
There are three dead kids

825
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,687
because of your department.

826
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,538
So get used to having us around.

827
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:42,166
Get used to my boots on your chin too.

828
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,585
You people better back off!

829
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:48,798
Goddamn FBI! Who do they think they are?

830
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,534
Coming here...

831
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:51,843
Do you have a statement?

832
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:53,803
Goddamn right I do!

833
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,222
For a moment there, Mr. Anderson,

834
01:13:57,015 --> 01:14:00,461
it sounded like we were both
on the same side.

835
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,281
Are you all right?

836
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,548
I'm fine.

837
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,159
Let me know if you need anything.

838
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,135
I will.

839
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,304
Mama! Mama, come quick!

840
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,892
No sign of him, sir. He's long gone.

841
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:23,729
His mother lives across the street.
She won't talk.

842
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:27,290
I want the whole area covered.
Someone saw it.

843
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,734
They won't talk to us.

844
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:33,004
Get going, Mr. Bird. If they won't
talk to us, shake it out of them.

845
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,634
Let's go. Every house. Come on.

846
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,684
What?

847
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:51,397
Sending these white guys
around with their notebooks

848
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,383
is gonna get you nowhere.

849
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:56,277
Okay. What would you do?

850
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,867
It's okay to be afraid.

851
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,918
Go on, Willie,

852
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,546
tell them what you saw.

853
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,374
The defendants will rise.

854
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:58,589
In this country,
a man's home is his castle.

855
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:04,095
That is one of the principles
by which this community survives.

856
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:07,306
You men have done violence
to that principle,

857
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:12,728
but the court understands
that your crimes

858
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,730
have been, to some extent,

859
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,677
brought about by outside influences.

860
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:34,667
Outsiders have come into Jessup County
and they've been people of low morality

861
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,962
and unhygienic.

862
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:41,590
Their presence has provoked
a lot of people.

863
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:50,375
So the court understands,
without condoning them, mind you,

864
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:55,146
that the crimes
to which you men have pled guilty were

865
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:59,775
provoked by these outside influences.

866
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,989
So I'm gonna make your punishment light.

867
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:10,327
I'm gonna sentence you each
to five years.

868
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:18,403
But I'm gonna suspend these sentences.

869
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,038
You can't go in there, sir.

870
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:56,858
FBI. Let us through.

871
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,084
Sorry, sir. You can't go in there.

872
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:06,133
Sheriff?

873
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:12,431
You started something this time.

874
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,059
I want to talk to them.

875
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,795
No.

876
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,729
This ain't nothing we can't handle.

877
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,591
Just crazy coloreds tearing up shit.

878
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,442
Local problem.

879
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,418
Look at those flames, Mr. Ward.

880
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,839
That's why they sent you here?

881
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:47,633
It would've happened anyway.

882
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:53,013
If I was a Negro,
I'd think the same way they do.

883
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,708
If you were a Negro,

884
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:58,018
nobody would give a damn
what you thought.

885
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,702
Aaron, Aaron, get up!

886
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,288
Take everyone out the back door.

887
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:03,709
When you hit the road, keep going.
You understand?

888
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:08,213
Nathan! Come on! Get up, Nathan!

889
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:10,408
Get out the bed!

890
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:12,051
What's happening?

891
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:16,513
Come on, Mama! Let's go! Come on, Mama!

892
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,725
Come on, y'all!

893
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,294
Get up, child.

894
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:22,728
Come on, Grandma!

895
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,521
Let's go!

896
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:41,121
Who's there?

897
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:45,042
If you're in there, come on out.
You hear?

898
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,466
I ain't taking this shit no more!

899
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,112
You'll be okay, Papa.

900
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,573
Mama and the girls are fine.

901
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,491
They cracked your head.

902
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:03,370
Just keep on breathing.
Don't you go dying on me.

903
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:05,372
You hear me?

904
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,542
You're gonna be just fine.

905
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:38,155
Cows won't run away.

906
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:40,824
No one knows why. They're stupid.

907
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:46,205
They just stand there until their
bellies swell up and they pop.

908
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:48,957
They have relatives in Detroit.

909
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:51,569
Are they gonna go?

910
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,670
I didn't give them any choice.

911
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,216
We know who did this.

912
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,619
We did.

913
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,413
It's progress.

914
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:04,932
Twenty years ago, they'd be strung up
for stealing watermelons.

915
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:10,104
I don't understand you, Mr. Anderson.
Not at all.

916
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:13,023
Let's get something straight.

917
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:17,111
This was fucked up when we
turned it into a news show.

918
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,988
When the three kids vanished,
it was news.

919
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:24,451
When the three civil rights workers
vanished, it was news.

920
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,788
They're just kids.
They're still missing.

921
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:32,709
What's missing is the 50 minutes
Pell said he was with his wife.

922
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,965
Okay.

923
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,732
I love Mississippi.

924
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:11,582
They hate Mississippi.

925
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,169
They hate us because we present

926
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:20,090
a shining example of
successful segregation.

927
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:24,761
These northern students,
with their atheist, Communist bosses,

928
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:28,807
that have come into our community

929
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:33,187
this week, have taken a terrible blow.

930
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:37,191
This week, their cause
has been crippled.

931
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,945
These federal policemen you see
prying into our lives

932
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:47,117
have learned that they
are powerless against us

933
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:51,455
if every single Anglo-Saxon
Christian one of us

934
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:52,789
stands together!

935
01:26:58,171 --> 01:26:59,504
This week...

936
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,425
We have company, sir.

937
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,637
This is a political meeting.

938
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:08,456
Doesn't smell that way to me.

939
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,474
It's a political meeting!

940
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:16,563
Oh, it looks like a political meeting,
but smells more like Klan to me

941
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:19,983
with or without the Halloween costumes.

942
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,319
Gentlemen.

943
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:26,198
In the courts of Mississippi,
they've been reminded

944
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:32,120
that they cannot turn our communities
into their communities.

945
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:36,667
Communities in which Negroes
run riot, unrestrained

946
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:39,211
as they do in Harlem

947
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,088
or they do in Oakland

948
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:43,340
or they do in the streets of Chicago!

949
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,423
Can I come in?

950
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:17,142
It's not good for you to be here.

951
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:18,769
Why?

952
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:20,562
It's ugly.

953
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:23,732
This whole thing is so ugly.

954
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:27,778
Do you know what it's like
to live with all this?

955
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,867
People look at us and only see
bigots and racists.

956
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:38,372
Hatred isn't something you're born with.

957
01:29:38,831 --> 01:29:40,791
It gets taught.

958
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:46,880
At school, they said
segregation was in the Bible.

959
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:52,719
Genesis 9, verse 27.

960
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:57,182
At seven years of age,

961
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:00,977
you get told it enough, you believe it.

962
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:04,147
You believe the hatred.

963
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:09,486
You live it, you breathe it.

964
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,365
You marry it.

965
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,215
My husband drove one of the cars
that night.

966
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:50,527
That's what you wanted
to hear, isn't it?

967
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,865
The bodies are buried
on the Roberts' Farm

968
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:57,534
in an earthen dam.

969
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:16,761
Sir.

970
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,693
Take a break, Mr. Bird.

971
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:34,821
Put some handkerchiefs on your faces.

972
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:53,757
Make way, folks.

973
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:08,271
The missing civil rights
workers were found

974
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:10,106
at an undisclosed grave.

975
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:16,404
Neither the FBI nor Sheriff's
Department will comment.

976
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:19,533
The bodies are at Jessup County Hospital

977
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:21,743
where officials refuse to comment.

978
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:26,456
There is speculation
that an autopsy will be performed.

979
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,293
Keep it open.

980
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:33,547
Coming through. Open it up.

981
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,092
Hold it back.

982
01:32:57,196 --> 01:33:00,156
Clinton, you got some problems at home.

983
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:01,726
What do you mean?

984
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,869
Pull your head out your ass
and get home!

985
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:07,190
I, Vincent Thompson,

986
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:10,917
am the cheddar cheese champion
of the world.

987
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:14,671
In international competition,

988
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:18,174
my cheddar won first prize
based on flavor,

989
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:21,344
texture, appearance, and color.

990
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:25,473
I've been a cheesemaker since I was 17.

991
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:28,685
I didn't expect you home so early.

992
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:32,355
Hi, Frank.

993
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:46,661
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

994
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:00,675
Sir.

995
01:34:03,512 --> 01:34:05,263
Say again.

996
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,017
I'll be right there.

997
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:15,899
- Mr. Bird.
- Yes, sir?

998
01:34:16,108 --> 01:34:19,027
Get five men and meet me outside.

999
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:21,806
Where's Anderson?

1000
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,573
He's at the motel.

1001
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:29,829
Take the front door.

1002
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:32,540
If anyone comes in, break them down.

1003
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,250
Take the corridor.

1004
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,336
- Mr. Bird.
- Sir?

1005
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:41,257
Okay. Go get Anderson. Bring him here.

1006
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:45,095
Don't tell him anything. Get him here.

1007
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:19,879
Mr. Anderson, stop!

1008
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:21,548
- Mr. Anderson!
- Go to hell!

1009
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:23,717
I'm telling you to stop.

1010
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,135
We're not killers.

1011
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:27,455
The difference between them and us.

1012
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,972
Them and you.

1013
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:30,640
You're not like them.

1014
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:35,061
What do you care what I do to
someone hiding behind a badge?

1015
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:36,964
Aren't you changing the world?

1016
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:38,356
Yes.

1017
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,483
You're arrogant and stupid!

1018
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:42,219
You're changing it, too.

1019
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,945
I am right now.

1020
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:48,392
Don't mess this up because you're
fooling around with witnesses.

1021
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:49,576
You!

1022
01:35:58,502 --> 01:36:00,795
That don't mean shit.

1023
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,506
I'll kill you if you don't listen.

1024
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:04,950
Fuck you.

1025
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:06,301
Let me go.

1026
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:09,345
Let me go.

1027
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:11,890
We'll go after them together.

1028
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:13,584
You wouldn't know how.

1029
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:15,059
You'll teach me.

1030
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:17,004
You don't have the guts.

1031
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:19,856
I have the guts and the authority.

1032
01:36:20,065 --> 01:36:22,009
What does that mean?

1033
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:23,777
New rules.

1034
01:36:23,986 --> 01:36:27,322
We nail them any way. Even your way.

1035
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:29,975
Is this you or someone else?

1036
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,743
Both.

1037
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:35,413
We do it my way with my people!

1038
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,957
Whatever it takes.

1039
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,794
Okay.

1040
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:48,968
Give me a minute.

1041
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,629
Would he have shot me?

1042
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,271
Yes, sir.

1043
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:03,733
He's a ballsy bastard, isn't he?

1044
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:16,814
They want me to say
that two white boys also died

1045
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:19,541
helping Negroes help themselves.

1046
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:24,128
They want me to say

1047
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:28,591
we mourn with the mothers
of these two white boys.

1048
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,137
But the State of Mississippi

1049
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:39,394
won't allow these boys to be buried
in the same cemetery as this Negro boy.

1050
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:46,276
I say, I have no more love to give.

1051
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:53,032
I have only anger in my heart today,
and I want you to be angry with me!

1052
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:58,913
I am sick, and I am tired,
and I want you to be sick and tired!

1053
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:04,544
I am sick and tired
of going to funerals of black men

1054
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:07,130
who've been murdered by white men.

1055
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:11,301
I am sick and tired of
the people of this country

1056
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:15,388
who continue to allow
these things to happen.

1057
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:20,143
What is an "unalienable right"
if you are a Negro?

1058
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:23,730
What does "equal treatment
under the law" mean?

1059
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:29,193
What does it mean
"liberty and justice for all"?

1060
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:34,324
Now I say to these people,
look at this young man

1061
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:37,619
and you'll see the face of a black man,

1062
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:40,663
but if you look at the blood, it's red!

1063
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:45,376
It is like yours! It is just like yours!

1064
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:15,925
You.

1065
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:21,806
I'm going to tell you a story.

1066
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:27,729
A kid named Homer Wilkes,
lives about 30 miles north of here.

1067
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:33,234
He'd taken his girl home
and was walking back along the road

1068
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:35,778
when a car pulled up.

1069
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:40,116
Three white boys took him for a ride.

1070
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:44,954
Now,

1071
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,624
he hadn't done anything

1072
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:51,502
except

1073
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:55,631
be a Negro.

1074
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:00,386
They took him to a shack.

1075
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:04,807
A shack like this one.

1076
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:07,310
They took out a razor blade.

1077
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:11,606
Regular razor blade like this one.

1078
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:17,195
They pulled down his pants,

1079
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:22,325
they spread his legs

1080
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:26,996
and they sliced off his scrotum.

1081
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:32,502
Put it in a coffee cup.

1082
01:41:37,216 --> 01:41:42,678
Do you know how you bleed
when somebody cuts off your balls?

1083
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,894
Homer looked like

1084
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,564
he'd been dipped in blood
up to his waist.

1085
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:57,193
He was barely alive when
he got to the hospital.

1086
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,821
He can hardly walk now.

1087
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:12,917
Mayor, we know you know who was there

1088
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:16,045
when those civil rights boys was killed.

1089
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,257
You know who pulled the trigger.

1090
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:27,598
You want to say something to me?

1091
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:35,731
Okay.

1092
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:42,890
Is he with the Bureau?

1093
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:45,074
He's a specialist.

1094
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:46,769
The mayor won't talk?

1095
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:48,327
They'd kill him.

1096
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:50,773
What do you have?

1097
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:53,207
Three cars, seven men involved.

1098
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,651
Pell and Bailey killed them.

1099
01:42:54,751 --> 01:42:55,918
Stuckey?

1100
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:59,505
He's too smart to be there. Pell did it.

1101
01:42:59,798 --> 01:43:00,908
And Townley?

1102
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:02,091
It was his idea.

1103
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:04,594
Grand Dragons don't get dirty.

1104
01:43:04,803 --> 01:43:08,931
The whole thing? Bullet by bullet.

1105
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,309
Are you interested

1106
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:16,272
in words like coercion
or hearsay or duress?

1107
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:18,842
This is no good in court.

1108
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:20,735
We're not in court.

1109
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:24,822
We won't get them on murder.
That's a state charge.

1110
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:26,616
They won't prosecute.

1111
01:43:26,783 --> 01:43:29,952
We've got to get them in Federal Court.

1112
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,522
Violation of civil rights!

1113
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,123
You're violating rights!

1114
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:36,110
Don't put me on your perch!

1115
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,127
Don't drag me in your gutter!

1116
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:41,130
These people crawled out of the sewer!

1117
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:44,008
Maybe the gutter's where we should be!

1118
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,349
Thank you.

1119
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,416
This better be important.

1120
01:44:25,842 --> 01:44:27,718
Who called this meeting?

1121
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:32,515
We thought you did.

1122
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:34,767
Of this group? Are you stupid?

1123
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:36,811
You didn't call this?

1124
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,422
Who the fuck did?

1125
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:39,897
Shut up!

1126
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:41,466
Wait!

1127
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:43,484
Is this a bullshit setup?

1128
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:45,736
Ray, you didn't call this?

1129
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:49,532
I got a note from you and Clinton.

1130
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,325
Lester, shut up!

1131
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:58,207
Now, we're all gonna
walk straight out of here

1132
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:00,418
and say nothing.

1133
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:02,878
That means nothing, Lester.

1134
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:04,740
You speak, you're dead.

1135
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,424
Shut up.

1136
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:09,010
Hey, Clinton.

1137
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,390
Clinton?

1138
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:21,605
The rattlesnakes are starting
to commit suicide.

1139
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,093
Hi, Lester.

1140
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:58,517
We'll give you that ride home.

1141
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,672
What?

1142
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:03,105
I know you said 4:30.

1143
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,232
We're running late.

1144
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:07,761
I'll meet you in the car.

1145
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:09,653
You're cracked.

1146
01:46:10,947 --> 01:46:13,100
You have change for a $20?

1147
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,618
Sure.

1148
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,334
Get in the car, Lester.

1149
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:27,463
Or it'll be hard picking your
nose once I shut this drawer.

1150
01:46:31,259 --> 01:46:35,763
You could make it easier on yourself
by going on the record.

1151
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:38,265
I ain't got nothing to say.

1152
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:41,394
You're barking up
the wrong tree, mister.

1153
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:44,105
I've got to tell you something.

1154
01:46:44,314 --> 01:46:48,192
We've got you cold. Your buddies talked.

1155
01:46:49,611 --> 01:46:51,320
You're lying.

1156
01:46:56,493 --> 01:46:58,202
You're in a lot of trouble.

1157
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:02,581
You drove the second vehicle,
the green truck.

1158
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,917
Your buddy... Refresh my memory.

1159
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:08,170
"Lester dragged the Negro from the car

1160
01:47:08,338 --> 01:47:09,839
"and shot him."

1161
01:47:10,048 --> 01:47:11,575
That's a lie!

1162
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:13,509
It's true. What else, Mr. Bird?

1163
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:18,556
He said, "They only left me a nigger,
but at least I shot one."

1164
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:24,478
I didn't kill him.
I shot him in the ass.

1165
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:28,315
He was already dead when
you put a slug in him.

1166
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:32,820
Your buddy tells it
that you killed the kid.

1167
01:47:33,029 --> 01:47:35,239
Go on the record for us

1168
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:39,160
or it's your ass,
not just a black kid's!

1169
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,176
Think about it, Lester.

1170
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:57,052
Come on out of there.

1171
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:00,556
Come on out.

1172
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:46,602
This is tricky.

1173
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:50,940
They make it look so easy, don't they?

1174
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:54,276
I got a question for you, Clinton.

1175
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:58,447
You don't mind if I call you Clinton?

1176
01:48:58,657 --> 01:49:01,367
I feel like I know you so well.

1177
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:07,164
The way we have it,
on the night of the murders,

1178
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:11,293
you made a speech as you
buried the kids in the dam.

1179
01:49:11,461 --> 01:49:15,381
How does Lester tell it?
"Mississippi would be proud.

1180
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:18,384
"You've struck a blow
for the white man."

1181
01:49:18,593 --> 01:49:21,220
Is that what you said?

1182
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:26,517
Is that what you said?
It must have been you.

1183
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:31,981
Clayton Townley and Ray Stuckey
were too smart to be there.

1184
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:36,193
You didn't think anyone would remember.

1185
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:40,056
But old Lester, he got a good memory.

1186
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:48,163
I'm sorry. I haven't done this
for a long time.

1187
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:49,983
Did you make a speech

1188
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:53,603
the night you beat up your wife?

1189
01:49:53,703 --> 01:49:55,529
Did you?

1190
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:59,117
Did you strike a blow
for the white man that night?

1191
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:06,390
You got a stupid smile. You know that?

1192
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,434
Can you see it?

1193
01:50:10,645 --> 01:50:15,524
Did you smile when the bulldozer
ran over the body? Did you?

1194
01:50:19,237 --> 01:50:22,865
Did you smile when
the bodies were covered over?

1195
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:25,826
Get up here. Come on!

1196
01:50:26,036 --> 01:50:30,539
Did you smile that same stupid smile?
Did you?

1197
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:39,340
Did you smile, Pell? Did you smile?

1198
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:50,309
Make no mistake, Deputy.

1199
01:50:50,518 --> 01:50:52,629
I'll cut your head off

1200
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:55,773
and not give a shit how it
reads in the report.

1201
01:51:18,588 --> 01:51:21,757
One more bite. One more bite.

1202
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:24,718
One more bite, darling. One more bite.

1203
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:44,180
Shit, Lester! What is going on?

1204
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,741
Get in the bedroom and lock the door!

1205
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:50,035
Stay away from the windows!

1206
01:53:06,696 --> 01:53:10,115
Please! Please! I didn't say a thing!

1207
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:13,118
It's a setup! I didn't say nothing!

1208
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,623
Nothing! I didn't say nothing!

1209
01:53:17,832 --> 01:53:19,374
I didn't say nothing!

1210
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,634
I didn't say nothing!

1211
01:53:49,072 --> 01:53:52,267
You're lucky we been watching your ass.

1212
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:59,623
If you go on the record,
we'll give you protection.

1213
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:00,833
If not...

1214
01:54:01,042 --> 01:54:04,753
If not, they're gonna kill you anyway.

1215
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:08,799
Oh! You need a toilet, Lester.

1216
01:54:33,032 --> 01:54:35,409
Really had him going.

1217
01:55:19,537 --> 01:55:22,372
We'll take care of the check.

1218
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:49,608
Well, I suppose I'll be back for supper.

1219
01:57:16,946 --> 01:57:18,613
Why did he do it?

1220
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:22,034
He wasn't even in on it.

1221
01:57:22,243 --> 01:57:23,952
He wasn't even Klan.

1222
01:57:24,495 --> 01:57:27,456
Mr. Bird, he was guilty.

1223
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:31,877
Anyone's guilty who watches this
happen and pretends it isn't.

1224
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:36,423
No, he was guilty, all right.

1225
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:40,260
As guilty as the ones
who pulled the trigger.

1226
01:57:42,555 --> 01:57:44,014
Maybe we all are.

1227
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:39,361
Hello?

1228
01:58:41,405 --> 01:58:42,739
Yeah.

1229
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:54,042
I just missed you at the hospital.
They said you'd gone home.

1230
01:58:55,002 --> 01:58:57,087
What's left of it.

1231
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:00,048
I'm real sorry.

1232
01:59:00,508 --> 01:59:02,384
So am I.

1233
01:59:03,177 --> 01:59:04,662
What are you gonna do?

1234
01:59:04,762 --> 01:59:06,429
I don't know.

1235
01:59:08,891 --> 01:59:10,501
Where will you go?

1236
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:12,310
I'm not going anywhere.

1237
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,021
This is my home. Born here.

1238
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:18,567
Probably die here.

1239
01:59:22,071 --> 01:59:25,740
If I wanted to leave
I would've done it a long time ago.

1240
01:59:26,367 --> 01:59:28,201
Things will work out.

1241
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:32,330
There's enough people here
know what I did was right.

1242
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:36,084
Ladies like the way I fix their hair.

1243
01:59:52,059 --> 01:59:53,059
Hey.

1244
01:59:55,188 --> 02:00:00,108
If you're ever in Des Moines,
don't send me a postcard.

1245
02:00:10,786 --> 02:00:16,291
We cannot see

1246
02:00:16,792 --> 02:00:18,877
In the future

1247
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:24,090
No, no, no, no, no

1248
02:00:25,092 --> 02:00:28,011
And it's hard

1249
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:31,973
To smile

1250
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:35,936
Through trials

1251
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:40,190
No we

1252
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:44,236
cannot see

1253
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:48,949
Every pitfall

1254
02:00:51,827 --> 02:00:55,038
But we must walk on

1255
02:00:55,748 --> 02:00:58,625
By faith

1256
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:04,464
Each day oh, Lord!

1257
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:12,013
Woah, on Monday

1258
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:16,226
Walk on

1259
02:01:17,061 --> 02:01:19,729
And on Tuesday

1260
02:01:19,855 --> 02:01:22,633
Walk on

1261
02:01:22,733 --> 02:01:29,698
Woah, let Jesus be

1262
02:01:29,865 --> 02:01:31,267
Let me him be your

1263
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:35,370
Your guide

1264
02:01:35,746 --> 02:01:37,539
Whoo!

1265
02:01:37,707 --> 02:01:40,818
He's able to

1266
02:01:40,918 --> 02:01:43,878
He can carry your load

1267
02:01:44,046 --> 02:01:47,966
And he can see way down the road

1268
02:01:48,843 --> 02:01:49,843
Ooh!

1269
02:01:50,219 --> 02:01:55,374
Walk on by faith...

1270
02:01:55,474 --> 02:01:57,392
You want to drive, Rupert?

1271
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:01,354
Yeah.
