1
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,836
They were heard screaming at each
other for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:06,039
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,908
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:10,810
Yeah.

5
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:14,080
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:16,815
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,753
Did the kid see it?

8
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:23,887
What?

9
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:25,522
The kid?

10
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:28,357
What kind of question's that?

11
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:33,829
We'll be real glad when we get rid of
you, Somerset. Always these questions.

12
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:37,599
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

13
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,633
He's dead.
His wife killed him.

14
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,336
Anything else has nothing
to do with us.

15
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:52,644
Detective Somerset?

16
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,848
I'm Detective Mills.

17
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:01,719
Just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

18
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,787
Look...

19
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:04,688
Mills?

20
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:09,625
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.

21
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,361
Not much time for
this transition thing.

22
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:16,698
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

23
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:17,632
Yeah.

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,435
Why here?

25
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:22,803
I don't follow.

26
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:25,639
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

27
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:29,275
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

28
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:34,713
Same reason as you. Or the reason
you had before you decided to quit.

29
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,817
You just met me.

30
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:42,319
Maybe I don't understand the question.

31
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:45,156
It's very simple.

32
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:49,559
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

33
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:53,996
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

34
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:58,533
It'd be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

35
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,570
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

36
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:07,507
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?

37
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:11,744
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.

38
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:13,512
- Not here.
- I understand.

39
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:18,049
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,
do me the favor of remembering that.

40
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:38,684
SE7EN

41
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:18,367
MONDAY

42
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,237
MONDAY

43
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:04,238
Yeah.

44
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:05,773
Okay.

45
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,108
Say it again?

46
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:15,214
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

47
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:21,953
Serpico's got to go.

48
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:25,490
Well, you might want
to get rid of this little...

49
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:28,125
crusty, this eye, Serpico.

50
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:29,960
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

51
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,128
Good.

52
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:48,909
Coffee?

53
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:56,749
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

54
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,584
What time was death established?

55
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:00,085
Like I said...

56
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,754
I didn't touch anything...

57
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:05,923
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

58
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:08,759
Wait. No one bothers
with vital signs?

59
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:13,697
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing
unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

60
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:17,033
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.

61
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:21,936
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up

62
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,372
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.

63
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,374
Thank you.

64
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,250
I wonder.

65
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:43,889
What was the point of the conversation
you were about to get into?

66
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:48,793
Don't know. How many times Barney Five
found dead bodies that weren't dead.

67
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,128
Drop it.

68
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,991
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

69
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,673
Better Homes and Gardens.

70
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:53,480
Spaghetti Sauce

71
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,250
Who said this was murder?

72
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:58,951
No one.

73
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:02,688
Guy's heart must be the size...

74
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:04,123
of a canned ham.

75
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:09,360
If this isn't a coronary...

76
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,527
well...

77
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:12,629
I don't know.

78
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,045
Whoops.

79
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:40,053
How about that.

80
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:52,129
We had this case once...

81
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:55,065
guy dead on the ground...

82
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:56,967
knife in his back.
Murder...

83
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,335
right?

84
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,503
Fuck!

85
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:05,740
Anyway, big insurance policy involved,
yeah? So the guy...

86
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,308
took the tip of the blade...

87
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,777
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

88
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,879
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...

89
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,781
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,291
Wait a minute.

91
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:27,392
What?

92
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,729
Got a bucket here.

93
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,931
What's in it?

94
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:40,970
Oh God!

95
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,638
Fucking vomit.

96
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,275
Any blood in it?

97
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:49,277
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,516
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,252
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,987
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:05,157
You girls have got forensics
waiting outside.

102
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,758
We might not fit.

103
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:09,327
There's room. Light's the problem.

104
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:10,695
How are you?

105
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,997
Det. Mills, go help the officers...

106
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:15,599
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,502
What?

108
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,304
And send in forensics.

109
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:38,351
He's dead.

110
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:41,321
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,860
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,196
Nope.

113
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:58,468
I did door-to-doors and walked
the beat. I did that shit...

114
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,636
a long time.

115
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,538
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:05,507
"detective".
That's the same as yours.

117
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,876
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:12,313
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene...

119
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:15,983
not whether you were getting
enough time on the field.

120
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,150
Hey, man...

121
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:22,555
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.

122
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,328
He's been dead...

123
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:33,063
a long time, and not from poison.

124
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:34,565
Oh, man.

125
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,734
How can you let yourself go like that?

126
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:40,169
It took 4 orderlies just
to get him on the table.

127
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:48,076
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.

128
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:51,245
Look. See how big this stomach is?

129
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:54,181
And the strange thing is,
it stretches.

130
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:57,417
Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

131
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,253
I see that, but it means
nothing to me.

132
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:02,855
Okay, he's got lines of distention...

133
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,523
across the duodenum.

134
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:06,225
The interior wall's ripped open.

135
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,361
This man ate till he burst?

136
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:15,365
He didn't really burst. Not all the
way. He was hemorrhaging internally.

137
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:18,268
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

138
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:21,537
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?

139
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:22,772
Yes and no.

140
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,841
What about these bruises here?

141
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:30,612
I haven't figured that out yet.

142
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:32,613
Gun pressed against his head?

143
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,148
Pressed hard enough.

144
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:35,382
Fuck, yeah.

145
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:38,384
On the front, flush with the muzzle.

146
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,990
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

147
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:51,395
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving. Took his time too.

148
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:54,398
Coroner said it could have lasted
more than 12 hours.

149
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:57,801
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort...

150
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,737
and there was a point
when he passed out.

151
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:02,972
That's when the killer kicked him...

152
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:04,974
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

153
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:08,310
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

154
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,246
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this...

155
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:14,282
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.

156
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:19,152
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy
and tortured him. Simple as that.

157
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,454
In the grocery bags...

158
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:24,056
we found 2 receipts. So,
the killer stopped and went back...

159
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,658
to the supermarket.

160
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,559
So?

161
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,430
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

162
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,498
- This is beginning.
- We've got...

163
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:36,433
one dead guy, not three.

164
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:37,668
No motive.

165
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:41,271
Don't start that big brain of yours...

166
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:42,939
cooking on this, alright?

167
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,341
I'd like to be reassigned.

168
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:47,676
Whoa.

169
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:50,012
What are you talking about?

170
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:52,013
This can't be my last duty.

171
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:53,748
It'll go on and on.

172
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,851
You're retiring in 6 days.

173
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:59,953
You've left unfinished
business before.

174
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:04,023
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible.

175
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:07,326
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.

176
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:09,128
It's his first assignment.

177
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:13,197
I knew it. This is not
my first assignment, you dick.

178
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,465
It's too soon.

179
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,868
I'm here. You can say that
shit to my face. Captain?

180
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,136
It's too soon for you.

181
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:21,204
Captain...

182
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:23,372
Can we talk in private?

183
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:24,874
This is a personal thing--

184
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:26,742
Just shut up, Mills.

185
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:28,643
I don't have anyone else...

186
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:32,047
to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...

187
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:35,015
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

188
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,653
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

189
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:40,987
Give it to me.

190
00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:43,056
I'll put you on something else.

191
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:47,859
Go on, Mills, just go on.

192
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:57,168
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck...

193
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,002
cleaning up the fat man.

194
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:06,475
TUESDAY

195
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:09,612
TUESDAY

196
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,315
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!

197
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,217
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED

198
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,819
Quiet down.

199
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,155
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

200
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:24,223
Quiet down.

201
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,327
Here's how it'll work:

202
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:33,498
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

203
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:38,903
Ask those questions in a calm, sane,
orderly fashion or I will leave.

204
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:40,838
Detective? Detective?

205
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:42,872
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

206
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,748
I won't discuss the details of this
investigation, so don't bother asking.

207
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,598
What you got for me?

208
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:15,200
Nothing yet, boss.

209
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:21,672
Why don't you guys go get
a coffee, huh?

210
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:27,376
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...

211
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:30,045
Eli Gould was found murdered today.

212
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:34,583
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.

213
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,055
That's ridiculous and offensive.

214
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:45,959
There is no conflict, and any claim
there could be is irresponsible.

215
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,560
Now hold on.

216
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:53,966
I just met with law enforcement
officials and they...

217
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:58,269
assured me that they have their
very best men on this.

218
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:01,304
This will be the very definition...

219
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,107
of swift justice.

220
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,310
GREED

221
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,428
Pardon me, George.

222
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:34,933
Somerset.

223
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,167
Come in.

224
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:38,969
You heard the news?

225
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,437
Nope, haven't heard.

226
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:43,339
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

227
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:46,843
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

228
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,945
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

229
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:58,553
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

230
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,988
Mills is heading the investigation.

231
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,590
Excuse me. Excuse me.

232
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,026
Don't do that, please?

233
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,096
Good for him.

234
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:12,598
What will you do...

235
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:14,766
with yourself out there, Somerset?

236
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:18,102
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

237
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,636
Don't you feel it?

238
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,872
Don't you feel that feeling?

239
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:25,275
You're not going to be a cop anymore.

240
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,109
That's the whole idea.

241
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:30,279
I don't think you'll leave.

242
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,215
Hell, you can't leave all this.

243
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,619
Guy's out walking his dog.

244
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,220
Gets attacked.

245
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,223
His watch is taken, his wallet.

246
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:43,624
And while he's lying...

247
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:45,291
on the sidewalk helpless...

248
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:48,795
his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

249
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:53,165
This happened last night
about 4 blocks from here.

250
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,100
I read about it.

251
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,935
I don't understand anymore.

252
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,204
It's the way it's always been.

253
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:04,140
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.

254
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:06,309
I don't think you can deny that.

255
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:08,978
Maybe I'm wrong.

256
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,549
The coroner sent this down for you.

257
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,684
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach...

258
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:20,521
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...

259
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:22,322
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

260
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:28,160
They were...

261
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:29,462
fed to him.

262
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:09,980
Lord.

263
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,814
GLUTTONY

264
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:22,756
This was found behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene.

265
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:25,759
"Long is the way

266
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:29,095
And hard, that out of hell
leads up to light."

267
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:30,429
It's from Milton.

268
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,632
"Paradise Lost."

269
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,167
Alright...

270
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:35,433
I'm confused.

271
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:37,969
It means that this is beginning.

272
00:23:38,036 --> 00:23:39,271
GLUTTONY

273
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,438
This was behind
the same refrigerator...

274
00:23:41,872 --> 00:23:43,841
written in grease.

275
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:46,010
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

276
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,844
Gluttony...

277
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,514
greed...

278
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,118
sloth, wrath...

279
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,320
pride, lust...

280
00:23:58,953 --> 00:24:00,121
and envy.

281
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:01,689
Seven.

282
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:02,690
Hold on.

283
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,592
This is not even my desk.

284
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,762
You can expect five more of these.

285
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:11,597
Wait a minute.

286
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:15,034
I can't get involved in this.

287
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:18,469
Somerset.

288
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:20,305
He wanted it.

289
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,141
Damn!

290
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,708
I'm all over it.

291
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:00,204
Where to?

292
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:05,376
Far away from here.

293
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,921
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.

294
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:21,689
Sit where you'd like.

295
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:23,791
How's everybody?

296
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,360
Hiya, Smiley.

297
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:29,296
George, the cards are getting cold.

298
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,197
Duty calls.

299
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:48,778
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...

300
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,014
I'll never understand.

301
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:54,050
All these books...

302
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:56,552
a world of knowledge right here...

303
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:57,786
and what do you do?

304
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:00,122
You play poker all night.

305
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:02,557
Hey, we got culture.

306
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:05,226
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

307
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:10,464
How's this for culture?

308
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:41,289

Dante's Purgatory
The Canterbury Tales

313
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,767
was crimson with his blood:

314
00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:27,878
Even children slain!

315
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:49,797
You know, Smiley...

316
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:52,565
you'll really miss us.

317
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,802
I just might.

WEDNESDAY

322
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,285
Fucking Dante.

323
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:59,922
Goddamn poetry-writing fagot
piece of shit.

324
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:01,523
Fucker.

325
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,201
Good work, Officer.

326
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,974
Thank you, Lord.

327
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:32,483
Oh, oh, sorry.

328
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,885
I'll move in a second.

329
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:50,998
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.

330
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:51,899
Yeah?

331
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,565
Phone.

332
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,235
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

333
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:41,374
Mills.

334
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:43,275
Honey...

335
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:45,210
You okay? Something wrong?

336
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:50,081
You dingleberry, I told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

337
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:52,716
Yeah. Why?

338
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:56,786
Why?

339
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:02,791
Okay.

340
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:07,895
It's my wife.

341
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:09,430
Sorry?

342
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:12,365
She'd like to speak to you.

343
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,310
This is Detective Somerset.

344
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,080
Well, yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

345
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,083
I appreciate the offer, but...

346
00:32:35,686 --> 00:32:37,920
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.

347
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:40,823
Yes, thank you very much.

348
00:32:42,091 --> 00:32:43,158
Bye.

349
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:47,162
Honey, what...?

350
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:56,603
Well?

351
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:57,971
Sorry?

352
00:32:59,372 --> 00:33:03,675
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

353
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:05,577
At my... How's that?

354
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,179
Tonight.

355
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,219
Hello, men.

356
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,521
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:21,757
That's Tracy. Tracy...

358
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:24,627
Hello.

359
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:27,495
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:28,763 --> 00:33:30,765
Except your first name.

361
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:33,367
It's William.

362
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:36,370
Well, it's a good name...

363
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:37,471
William.

364
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:40,373
William, I'd like you to meet David.

365
00:33:40,473 --> 00:33:44,376
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

366
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:47,646
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.

367
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:51,215
Aw, good dogs.

368
00:33:51,282 --> 00:33:54,218
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

369
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,829
Smells good.

370
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:11,165
Yeah, I mean, thank you.

371
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,168
Please have a seat, if you like.

372
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:18,238
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.

373
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:22,174
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

374
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:23,909
We're still unpacking.

375
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:29,080
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

376
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:33,083
Pretty hokey, huh?

377
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:35,753
You know something?

378
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:38,855
On our first date I knew he was...

379
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:40,423
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

380
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:44,260
He was the funniest guy I ever met.

381
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,165
Really.

382
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,703
It's kind of rare nowadays.

383
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,038
I mean, that level of...

384
00:34:58,104 --> 00:34:59,205
commitment.

385
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:05,444
Oh, don't worry.

386
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:08,280
I won't wear it to the dinner table.

387
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:11,215
No matter...

388
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,951
how often I see guns,
I just can't...

389
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:15,452
get used to them.

390
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:17,754
Same here.

391
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:30,732
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.

392
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,067
What the hell?

393
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,834
I was close once.

394
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:36,170
It just didn't happen.

395
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:38,172
It surprises me.

396
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:40,339
It really does.

397
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:42,775
Well...

398
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:48,413
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

399
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,749
Just ask your husband.

400
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,916
Very true.

401
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,085
Very, very true.

402
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,921
How long have you lived here?

403
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:58,855
Too long.

404
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:04,159
How do you like it?

405
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:07,262
You know...

406
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:10,098
takes time. Settle in...

407
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:12,834
it'll be good.

408
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,036
Well, you get numb after awhile

409
00:36:16,536 --> 00:36:18,438
There are things to any city...

410
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,378
Subway.

411
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,880
It'll go away in a minute.

412
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:33,284
This real estate guy.

413
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,553
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.

414
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:40,723
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

415
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,459
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.

416
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,230
Then I start wondering why he'll only
bring us here 5 minutes at a time.

417
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,198
We found out the first night.

418
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:52,967
The soothing, relaxing...

419
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:55,302
vibrating home, huh?

420
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:05,144
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,252
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

422
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,389
I don't know why you're laughing.

423
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,927
Alright, already.

424
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:31,166
He had to get into the building...

425
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:35,269
before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?

426
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,572
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

427
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,008
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.

428
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:46,512
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.

429
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:49,648
Laid low till the cleaning crew left,
then had...

430
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:53,185
his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

431
00:37:53,684 --> 00:37:54,518
Look.

432
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,388
Gould was bound, right arm free.

433
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:59,623
He was handed a butcher's knife.

434
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,493
Check out the scale.

435
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:04,828
A pound of flesh.

436
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,034
"One pound of flesh"

437
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:15,603
"No more no less
No cartilage...

438
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:16,871
No bone....

439
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:19,306
only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."

440
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:20,707
Didn't see it.

441
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:23,844
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".

442
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,045
I tell you that chair was...

443
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:28,814
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.

444
00:38:29,482 --> 00:38:32,217
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time...

445
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,719
deciding which cut....

446
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:35,987
to make first.

447
00:38:36,587 --> 00:38:37,988
Imagine it.

448
00:38:38,055 --> 00:38:39,890
There's a gun in your face.

449
00:38:40,557 --> 00:38:42,859
Which part of your body
is expendable?

450
00:38:43,526 --> 00:38:45,228
The love handle.

451
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:48,331
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

452
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,035
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...

453
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:56,570
Look through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

454
00:38:56,671 --> 00:39:01,675
The trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

455
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:04,177
until it's an exhausted possibility.

456
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:06,212
I'll get another beer. Beer?

457
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:08,080
Wine, please.

458
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,356
He's preaching.

459
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:20,257
Punishing.

460
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:25,261
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

461
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:28,230
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...

462
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:31,566
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...

463
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:35,337
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?

464
00:39:35,437 --> 00:39:36,538
Yeah.

465
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:39,073
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...

466
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:43,643
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill
and check out all the sinners?

467
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:48,481
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.

468
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:51,917
But there pride comes first,
not gluttony.

469
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,485
For now let's consider...

470
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:56,554
the books as the killer's inspiration.

471
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:59,623
The sermons were about atonement
for sin.

472
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,092
These murders are like
forced attrition.

473
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,660
Forced what?

474
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:06,930
Attrition's when you regret your sins,
but not because...

475
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:10,899
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.

476
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:15,937
No fingerprints.

477
00:40:16,004 --> 00:40:17,438
Nope.

478
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:20,607
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.

479
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:23,443
And no witnesses of any kind.

480
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:25,178
Which I don't get...

481
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:28,180
because the fucker
had to get back out.

482
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:33,351
In any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

483
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:37,656
In rape prevention, the first thing
they teach you is never cry for help.

484
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,124
Always yell, "Fire!".

485
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,625
Nobody answers help.

486
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,727
Holler "fire," they'll come.

487
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:45,528
That's fucked up.

488
00:40:45,595 --> 00:40:48,364
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

489
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:54,703
You know what? Thank you for talking
this out, but I must sleep.

490
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:56,370
Walk the dogs.

491
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,973
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.

492
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:03,043
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

493
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:07,647
Gould's wife. She was out of town
at the time.

494
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:11,050
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

495
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:15,153
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

496
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,662
What if it isn't what she has seen...

497
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:29,965
but what she's supposed to see
but hasn't had the chance?

498
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:31,834
Yeah, okay. What?

499
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:33,401
I don't know.

500
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,172
But that's the one thing.

501
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:23,944
I'll sign us in.

502
00:42:24,444 --> 00:42:25,946
Must see Mrs. Gould.

503
00:42:32,685 --> 00:42:34,052
Mrs. Gould?

504
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,760
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

505
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,262
I don't understand.

506
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,331
I need you to look at each photo...

507
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:50,466
very carefully.

508
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:54,136
Look and see if there's anything
strange or...

509
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:56,805
out of place, anything at all.

510
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:59,073
I don't see anything.

511
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:02,643
Please, I can't do this right now.

512
00:43:02,743 --> 00:43:03,811
Okay.

513
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:06,479
It's got to be now.

514
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:08,481
There may be something we missed.

515
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:19,257
Wait.

516
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:20,291
What?

517
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:21,426
Here.

518
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:27,998
This painting, it's upside down.

519
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,839
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

520
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,275
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

521
00:43:43,744 --> 00:43:44,845
Nothing.

522
00:43:46,113 --> 00:43:48,114
There's got to be something.

523
00:43:59,057 --> 00:44:01,692
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

524
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,631
What the fuck is that?

525
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:10,533
Switchblade.

526
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:20,475
Goddamn it.

527
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,213
There must be something.

528
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,486
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

529
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:44,361
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

530
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,798
See this, this is us.

531
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:51,234
Just wait a minute.

532
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:57,339
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,779
You're kidding me.

534
00:45:04,879 --> 00:45:06,846
Call the print lab.

535
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,419
Oh, man.

536
00:45:16,956 --> 00:45:18,356
Honestly...

537
00:45:18,456 --> 00:45:21,025
have you ever seen anything like this?

538
00:45:25,228 --> 00:45:26,797
HELP ME

539
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:29,800
The swell pattern tells me
that they're not...

540
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,134
the victim's fingerprints.

541
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:44,378
I don't know, man.

542
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:46,580
I say he's whacked enough.

543
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:49,515
It doesn't fit.

544
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:51,985
He doesn't want to stop.

545
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:53,152
Who knows.

546
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:57,389
Freaks out there doing their
evil deeds they don't want to do.

547
00:45:57,456 --> 00:45:59,992
"The voices made me do it".

548
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:01,993
"Jodie Foster made me do it".

549
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,527
It can take...

550
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:07,697
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to cross...

551
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:09,499
your fingers somewhere else.

552
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:16,005
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

553
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:17,840
About catching this guy.

554
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:23,945
Wish I still thought
the way you did.

555
00:46:25,445 --> 00:46:28,782
Tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing?

556
00:46:29,716 --> 00:46:31,550
Picking up the pieces.

557
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:37,956
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples...

558
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:40,125
writing everything down...

559
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:42,527
noting the time things happened.

560
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:44,962
That's all?

561
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:47,131
That's all.

562
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:50,967
Putting everything into neat piles
and filing it away...

563
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:55,038
on the off chance it'll be needed
in the courtroom.

564
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:00,976
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island...

565
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:04,211
saving them in case we get rescued.

566
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:08,315
Bullshit.

567
00:47:11,084 --> 00:47:14,853
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

568
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:19,658
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

569
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,229
Don't try to tell me you didn't
get that rush tonight.

570
00:47:27,397 --> 00:47:28,832
I saw you.

571
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,735
We're getting somewhere.

572
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:41,910
THURSDAY

573
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,479
THURSDAY

574
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,916
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

575
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,850
We got a winner.

576
00:47:57,055 --> 00:48:00,826
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

577
00:48:00,892 --> 00:48:03,527
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

578
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:07,265
He's got a long history
of serious mental illnesses.

579
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:10,000
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

580
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:13,536
Somewhere along the line
they fell short.

581
00:48:13,603 --> 00:48:17,106
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery
and assault, spent time...

582
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:20,376
in prison for the attempted rape
of a minor.

583
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:24,279
His lawyer made sure that didn't
last long. By the way...

584
00:48:24,345 --> 00:48:27,115
the lawyer was Eli Gould,
the "greed" victim.

585
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:29,883
We'll stop this today,
ladies and germs.

586
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:34,453
Victor's been out of circulation for
awhile, but we've a residence for him.

587
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,056
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...

588
00:48:37,156 --> 00:48:38,724
Like our guy, does it?

589
00:48:38,824 --> 00:48:39,858
You tell me.

590
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:43,194
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

591
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,553
You ever take a bullet?

592
00:49:13,653 --> 00:49:16,755
Never in my thirty-four years,
knock on wood.

593
00:49:18,557 --> 00:49:20,159
I've only taken my gun out...

594
00:49:20,226 --> 00:49:22,760
3 times wanting to use it.

595
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,495
Never pulled the trigger.

596
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:25,763
Not once.

597
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,131
You?

598
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:31,501
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet,
but...

599
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,171
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

600
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,339
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

601
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:38,608
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:41,509
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

603
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:46,680
We bust open the door looking for this
junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.

604
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:49,850
One cop got hit in the arm.

605
00:49:51,952 --> 00:49:53,620
Christ, what was his name?

606
00:49:55,221 --> 00:49:59,691
It spun him like a top... no, Well,
more, you know, more like slow motion.

607
00:50:01,093 --> 00:50:02,694
I remember...

608
00:50:04,363 --> 00:50:05,963
riding in that ambulance...

609
00:50:06,063 --> 00:50:07,365
and, well...

610
00:50:07,431 --> 00:50:08,866
he died right there.

611
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:10,468
Right there.

612
00:50:11,368 --> 00:50:13,603
Christ, what was his fucking name?

613
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:34,037
SWAT goes before dicks.

614
00:51:37,773 --> 00:51:39,275
They love this.

615
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:41,244
Police!

616
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:47,449
Clear!

617
00:52:12,136 --> 00:52:13,570
Good morning, sweetheart.

618
00:52:14,871 --> 00:52:17,641
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!

619
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:28,650
Get up, you sack of shit.

620
00:52:35,556 --> 00:52:36,723
Oh, fuck me.

621
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,257
Dicks!

622
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,093
You'll want to come
take a look at this.

623
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,597
Dicks!

624
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,171
Jesus.

625
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,438
Victor?

626
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:57,941
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

627
00:52:58,007 --> 00:52:59,676
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?

628
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:01,110
Hearse, I'd say.

629
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,678
Call for forensics.

630
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:04,346
Get your people out.

631
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:06,181
No one touches anything.

632
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:08,583
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.

633
00:53:12,587 --> 00:53:13,854
Sloth.

634
00:53:23,596 --> 00:53:24,797
Aw, man.

635
00:53:24,864 --> 00:53:26,130
Goddamn.

636
00:53:26,598 --> 00:53:28,967
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.

637
00:53:37,274 --> 00:53:38,808
This must be the first.

638
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:39,742
Look.

639
00:53:40,543 --> 00:53:43,045
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

640
00:53:44,946 --> 00:53:46,815
I got a hair sample. I got a...

641
00:53:46,882 --> 00:53:49,150
stool sample. I got piss. I got...

642
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:50,551
fingernails.

643
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:54,288
He's laughing at us.

644
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:56,656
You got what you deserved.

645
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,995
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!

646
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,396
Guns down!

647
00:54:04,463 --> 00:54:06,732
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

648
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:26,482
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.

649
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,352
We must forget our emotion.

650
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:36,423
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?

651
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,925
Are you listening to me?

652
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:39,492
Yes, I can hear you.

653
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,260
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

654
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,096
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.

655
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:45,530
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.

656
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:48,567
I got a fucking right to be here.

657
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:50,468
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.

658
00:54:50,535 --> 00:54:52,469
I got your picture, man.

659
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:54,805
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.

660
00:54:54,872 --> 00:54:57,740
Detective Mills.
M-I-L-L-S. Fuck off.

661
00:54:57,807 --> 00:54:59,576
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!

662
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,812
How they get here so fucking quick?

663
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:06,481
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.

664
00:55:07,149 --> 00:55:09,151
Hey man, I'm sorry.

665
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:12,653
They piss me off.

666
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,988
It's okay.

667
00:55:14,055 --> 00:55:16,690
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

668
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:28,867
1 year of immobility's right, judging
by the muscle and spine deterioration.

669
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:32,604
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

670
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,541
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep
the bedsores from infecting.

671
00:55:38,175 --> 00:55:42,278
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

672
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:45,214
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

673
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:47,782
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

674
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:51,219
Doc.

675
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:55,456
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

676
00:55:56,290 --> 00:56:00,960
He'd die of shock right now if you
shone a flashlight in his eyes.

677
00:56:01,794 --> 00:56:06,632
He's had as much pain and suffering as
anyone I've encountered, give or take

678
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:10,301
and he still has hell
to look forward to.

679
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:11,969
Good night.

680
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,649
Hello, William.

681
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:28,317
It's Tracy.

682
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:29,951
Tracy?

683
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:31,653
Everything okay?

684
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:34,922
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

685
00:56:34,988 --> 00:56:36,123
Where's David?

686
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,493
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

687
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,595
I'm sorry to call you like this.

688
00:56:42,662 --> 00:56:44,163
Oh, it's all right.

689
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:46,632
What can I do for you?

690
00:56:52,237 --> 00:56:54,271
I need someone to talk...

691
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:57,274
to. Do you think you could meet me...

692
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,642
somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?

693
00:57:00,577 --> 00:57:02,178
I don't understand.

694
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:06,281
I feel stupid calling, but...

695
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,686
you're the only person
that I know here.

696
00:57:11,118 --> 00:57:12,653
There's no one else.

697
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,622
If you can...

698
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:17,191
just give me a call, okay?

699
00:57:17,257 --> 00:57:18,959
I have to go now.

700
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:20,861
Good night.

701
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:21,962
Good night.

702
00:57:26,732 --> 00:57:26,765
FRIDAY

703
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:29,368
FRIDAY

704
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:32,570
I mean...

705
00:57:33,471 --> 00:57:35,240
you know this city so well.

706
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:37,574
You've been here...

707
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:39,176
so long.

708
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:42,512
It can be a hard place.

709
00:57:43,146 --> 00:57:45,648
I don't know why I asked you to come.

710
00:57:47,283 --> 00:57:49,384
Why don't you talk to him about it?

711
00:57:49,784 --> 00:57:51,486
Tell him how you feel.

712
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:55,656
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.

713
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,491
Especially now.

714
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,561
I'll get used to things...

715
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:02,829
you know?

716
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,064
I wanted to talk to someone...

717
00:58:05,131 --> 00:58:07,833
who's lived here for a long time.

718
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:13,371
I mean, upstate, it's
a completely different environment.

719
00:58:17,108 --> 00:58:21,812
Did David tell you that I teach
fifth grade? Well, I did.

720
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,347
Yeah, he mentioned it.

721
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:31,586
I've been going around,
looking at schools...

722
00:58:33,822 --> 00:58:35,924
but the conditions here are...

723
00:58:36,324 --> 00:58:37,758
horrible.

724
00:58:39,593 --> 00:58:41,261
What about private schools?

725
00:58:43,663 --> 00:58:44,697
I don't know.

726
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:49,167
Tell me what's really bothering you.

727
00:58:51,937 --> 00:58:54,372
David and I are going to have a baby.

728
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:00,611
Oh, Tracy. I...

729
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:03,713
I don't think I'm the one...

730
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,715
to talk to...

731
00:59:05,782 --> 00:59:08,550
- about this.
- I hate this city.

732
00:59:12,855 --> 00:59:14,889
I had a relationship once...

733
00:59:15,523 --> 00:59:17,792
it was very much like a marriage.

734
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:22,295
We got pregnant.

735
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,698
This was a long time ago.

736
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:34,472
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

737
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:40,978
Just a day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew...

738
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:42,579
about the pregnancy.

739
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,916
And I felt this fear...

740
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,318
the first time ever.

741
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,255
I remember thinking...

742
00:59:54,022 --> 00:59:57,324
how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

743
00:59:57,391 --> 01:00:00,327
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

744
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,335
I told her I didn't want to have it.

745
01:00:12,504 --> 01:00:14,472
And over the next few weeks...

746
01:00:15,673 --> 01:00:17,341
I wore her down.

747
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:22,112
I want to have children.

748
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,784
I can tell you now that...

749
01:00:29,685 --> 01:00:32,021
I know... I mean...

750
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,857
I'm positive that...

751
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,625
I made the right decision.

752
01:00:38,692 --> 01:00:41,862
But not a day passes
that I don't wish...

753
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,630
that I had made a different choice.

754
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:49,702
If you don't...

755
01:00:49,769 --> 01:00:50,869
keep...

756
01:00:52,204 --> 01:00:55,373
the baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

757
01:00:57,441 --> 01:01:00,044
don't ever tell him you were pregnant.

758
01:01:01,612 --> 01:01:04,714
but if you choose to have the baby...

759
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:06,883
then spoil that kid...

760
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,718
every chance you get.

761
01:01:15,623 --> 01:01:16,691
That's...

762
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:17,892
about...

763
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:20,328
all the advice I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:28,400
I must go.

765
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:30,669
William.

766
01:01:37,742 --> 01:01:39,077
Thank you.

767
01:01:51,419 --> 01:01:53,755
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust

768
01:01:53,694 --> 01:01:57,964
Victor's landlord said there was cash
in the mail box...

769
01:01:58,031 --> 01:01:59,699
the first of every month.

770
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,471
Quote:

771
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:08,874
"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

772
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:12,577
in apartment 306, and nobody
ever complained about him.

773
01:02:12,644 --> 01:02:14,746
The best tenant I've ever had."

774
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:17,181
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.

775
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:19,249
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

776
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:20,984
Who pays the rent on time.

777
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:23,786
I'm sick of this waiting.

778
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:25,021
This is the job.

779
01:02:26,355 --> 01:02:27,956
Why aren't we out there?

780
01:02:28,023 --> 01:02:31,626
Why must we sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic...

781
01:02:31,726 --> 01:02:33,161
does it again?-

782
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:36,330
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

783
01:02:36,397 --> 01:02:39,100
Come on, he's insane. Look.

784
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:43,336
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

785
01:02:43,403 --> 01:02:45,772
Yeah, rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

786
01:02:46,738 --> 01:02:47,773
How's that?

787
01:02:47,873 --> 01:02:49,208
I don't think so.

788
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:52,643
His luck'll run out.

789
01:02:53,611 --> 01:02:55,646
He's not depending on luck.

790
01:02:58,715 --> 01:03:03,019
We walked in there exactly 1 year
after he tied Victor to the bed.

791
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:04,854
One year to the day.

792
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,189
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

793
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:08,691
Oh, yes, we do.

794
01:03:09,825 --> 01:03:11,526
This note he left...

795
01:03:11,926 --> 01:03:13,895
his first words to us.

796
01:03:13,862 --> 01:03:16,564
"Long is the way, and Hard,
that out of hell...

797
01:03:16,631 --> 01:03:17,965
Leads up to Light."

798
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,702
Fuck him. So what?

799
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,136
He's right, so far.

800
01:03:23,703 --> 01:03:28,207
Imagine the will it takes to keep
a man bound for a full year.

801
01:03:28,274 --> 01:03:30,709
To sever his hand and to use it...

802
01:03:30,776 --> 01:03:32,310
to plant fingerprints.

803
01:03:32,377 --> 01:03:35,279
To insert tubes into his genitals.

804
01:03:35,346 --> 01:03:38,315
This guy's methodical, exacting...

805
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:40,651
and worst of all, patient.

806
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:42,652
He's a nut bag.

807
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,656
Because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

808
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:52,327
You got money?

809
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,729
I got 50. Fifty bucks.

810
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:57,231
I propose a field trip. Come on.

811
01:04:01,067 --> 01:04:03,904
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...

812
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:07,907
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating
to the 7 deadly sins.

813
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,408
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

814
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:12,510
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

815
01:04:12,577 --> 01:04:14,245
What are his interests now?

816
01:04:15,146 --> 01:04:16,848
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

817
01:04:17,248 --> 01:04:18,916
- Where are we going?
- Library.

818
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:36,030
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--

819
01:04:36,097 --> 01:04:37,598
Discount coupons.

820
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:43,203
They must have had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

821
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:46,372
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking...

822
01:04:46,439 --> 01:04:47,574
we're dating.

823
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:49,708
Give me your money.

824
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:55,480
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.

825
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,052
Somerset. How you doing?

826
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:05,055
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.

827
01:05:05,122 --> 01:05:07,556
It's not a problem. Sit down.

828
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:16,064
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

829
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:19,366
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.

830
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:26,072
About an hour.

831
01:05:28,374 --> 01:05:30,076
Yep. Help yourself.

832
01:05:32,644 --> 01:05:34,413
That was money well spent.

833
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:36,748
Yeah.

834
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:46,089
Alright.

835
01:05:46,156 --> 01:05:49,925
Telling you this, I'm trusting you
more than I trust most people.

836
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:52,327
Good, 'cause I might punch you.

837
01:05:54,063 --> 01:05:57,999
It's probably nothing, but even so,
it's no skin off our teeth.

838
01:06:01,035 --> 01:06:04,071
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

839
01:06:05,906 --> 01:06:07,174
Who, stinky man?

840
01:06:07,907 --> 01:06:12,778
For years, the FBI's been hooked into
the library system, keeping records.

841
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:16,681
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.

842
01:06:16,748 --> 01:06:18,116
Look.

843
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,117
Certain books are flagged.

844
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,519
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...

845
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,621
"Mein Kampf".

846
01:06:25,089 --> 01:06:29,959
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
has his library records fed to the FBI.

847
01:06:30,026 --> 01:06:32,294
Wait. How is this legal?

848
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,163
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.

849
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:40,634
You can't use the information
directly. It's just a useful guide.

850
01:06:41,035 --> 01:06:45,705
It might sound silly, but you can't
get a library card without an ID...

851
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:47,974
and a current phone bill. See?

852
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,677
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.

853
01:06:52,444 --> 01:06:54,713
If you want to know who's reading...

854
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:58,316
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter"...

855
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:00,885
the FBI's computers will tell us.

856
01:07:00,952 --> 01:07:02,486
It could give us a name.

857
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:05,655
Of a college kid writing
a term paper...

858
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,324
on 20th-century crime.

859
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:10,326
At least you're out of the office.

860
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,827
Get a haircut.

861
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,163
How do you know this?

862
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,063
I don't.

863
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,999
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

864
01:07:26,073 --> 01:07:28,408
"Divine Comedy".

865
01:07:28,474 --> 01:07:32,677
"History of Catholicism" A book
called "Murderers and Madmen".

866
01:07:32,744 --> 01:07:36,248
"Modern Homicide Investigation".
"In Cold Blood".

867
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:38,916
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?

868
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:40,918
It's not what you think.

869
01:07:41,419 --> 01:07:43,421
The Marquis de Sade.

870
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:45,688
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

871
01:07:45,755 --> 01:07:48,358
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...

872
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:50,527
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.

873
01:07:50,593 --> 01:07:52,961
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

874
01:07:53,629 --> 01:07:55,030
Is that it?

875
01:07:55,097 --> 01:07:55,931
Yep.

876
01:07:56,931 --> 01:07:59,300
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

877
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,135
Whatever.

878
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,937
We're sure about that name, are we?

879
01:08:04,004 --> 01:08:06,373
You were, you saw it. John Doe.

880
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,875
You want to go back, I'll go back.

881
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:11,711
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

882
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:14,046
This is crazy.

883
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:16,214
We'll just talk to him.

884
01:08:17,015 --> 01:08:20,051
"Excuse me, sir. Do you
happen to be a serial killer?"

885
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,055
You do the talking.

886
01:08:26,156 --> 01:08:28,725
Put that silver tongue of yours
to work.

887
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,460
You've talked to my wife?

888
01:08:34,463 --> 01:08:35,731
Retarded.

889
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:38,133
Charlie's fucking Angels.

890
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,634
A name off a computer.

891
01:08:44,638 --> 01:08:45,739
Mills.

892
01:08:56,648 --> 01:08:58,416
- You hit?
- No.

893
01:09:01,552 --> 01:09:03,488
He's going down!

894
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:21,603
Fifth floor!

895
01:09:41,752 --> 01:09:44,188
Police. Is there a back way out?

896
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:46,023
Lock your door.

897
01:09:48,858 --> 01:09:51,127
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

898
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:17,982
Get down!

899
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:21,586
Get the fuck down.

900
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,802
Goddamn it.

901
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,522
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.

902
01:14:45,007 --> 01:14:46,374
Where are you going?

903
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,876
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.

904
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,445
What? He fucking shot at us.

905
01:14:52,512 --> 01:14:53,947
You can't go in.

906
01:14:54,014 --> 01:14:56,883
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.

907
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,785
Think about it. Think
how did we get here?

908
01:14:59,852 --> 01:15:03,389
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.

909
01:15:03,454 --> 01:15:07,225
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?

910
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:11,061
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.

911
01:15:11,128 --> 01:15:13,130
Just pay attention a minute?

912
01:15:13,697 --> 01:15:17,066
With a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

913
01:15:17,133 --> 01:15:19,969
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?

914
01:15:20,036 --> 01:15:23,071
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.

915
01:15:23,138 --> 01:15:26,741
We need a reason to knock on
this door.

916
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:29,310
Think about it.

917
01:15:30,878 --> 01:15:31,979
Okay?

918
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:35,915
Okay, okay.

919
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:39,419
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

920
01:15:39,485 --> 01:15:41,253
When you're right, you're right.

921
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:50,194
Well...

922
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:53,096
no point in arguing anymore.

923
01:15:54,497 --> 01:15:56,299
Unless you can fix that..

924
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:00,769
You stupid son of a ...

925
01:16:09,077 --> 01:16:11,178
How much money we got left?

926
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:13,647
So, yeah, I noticed...

927
01:16:13,714 --> 01:16:15,082
this guy going out a lot...

928
01:16:15,148 --> 01:16:18,818
when the murders were happening,
so I...

929
01:16:19,952 --> 01:16:22,321
So you called Det. Somerset?

930
01:16:22,388 --> 01:16:24,456
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy...

931
01:16:24,522 --> 01:16:27,459
was creepy and shit,
and one of the murders...

932
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:30,127
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.

933
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:32,463
Got everything?

934
01:16:32,529 --> 01:16:34,531
Have her sign. You must sign.

935
01:16:35,598 --> 01:16:36,599
Good.

936
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:39,035
You did good.

937
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:41,803
- I did what you said.
- Here.

938
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:43,872
You get something to eat.

939
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:49,377
Everybody stay outside.

940
01:17:51,095 --> 01:17:52,196
Victor.

941
01:18:03,672 --> 01:18:06,374
Wild Bill's Leather

942
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:45,958
Fuck.

943
01:19:55,566 --> 01:19:57,968
LUST

944
01:20:05,441 --> 01:20:06,508
Somerset!

945
01:20:15,782 --> 01:20:17,985
- What?
- We had him.

946
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,386
What are you saying?

947
01:20:20,453 --> 01:20:22,488
The fucking photographer in...

948
01:20:22,555 --> 01:20:23,656
the fucking stairs.

949
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,562
We had him and we let him go.

950
01:20:37,401 --> 01:20:39,168
You're sure this is him?

951
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:41,738
Yep. Good. Get it out.

952
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:46,842
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.

953
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:49,011
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.

954
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,013
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?

955
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:54,682
We got his money. I like it.

956
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,183
Wait. You won't believe this.

957
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:00,053
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.

958
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,988
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

959
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,360
We could use some more men.

960
01:21:09,427 --> 01:21:10,595
I'm doing my best.

961
01:21:11,429 --> 01:21:14,766
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here...

962
01:21:14,832 --> 01:21:18,101
and each notebook
contains about 250 pages.

963
01:21:18,168 --> 01:21:19,937
What about the killings?

964
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:25,541
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
what a gross stage we dance on.

965
01:21:25,608 --> 01:21:27,742
What fun, dancing and fucking.

966
01:21:27,809 --> 01:21:31,446
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.

967
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:33,881
We are not what was intended."

968
01:21:33,948 --> 01:21:35,883
Wait, there's a lot more.

969
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:40,853
"On the subway today, a man came up
to start a conversation.

970
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:45,391
He made small talk, a lonely man
talking about the weather and things.

971
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,626
I tried to be pleasant...

972
01:21:47,693 --> 01:21:50,629
but my head began to hurt
from his banality.

973
01:21:50,696 --> 01:21:52,863
I almost didn't notice...

974
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,299
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

975
01:21:55,866 --> 01:21:57,801
He was not pleased...

976
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:00,237
and I couldn't stop laughing".

977
01:22:01,638 --> 01:22:03,139
No dates.

978
01:22:03,206 --> 01:22:06,308
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

979
01:22:07,376 --> 01:22:09,378
Just his mind poured out on paper.

980
01:22:10,712 --> 01:22:12,413
Looks like a life's work.

981
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,917
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still...

982
01:22:15,983 --> 01:22:18,552
- take 2 months.
- I know.

983
01:22:26,325 --> 01:22:28,660
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?

984
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,832
People, quiet!

985
01:22:50,078 --> 01:22:51,513
I admire you.

986
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,950
I don't know how you found me,
but I was surprised!

987
01:22:57,018 --> 01:23:00,520
I respect you law enforcement
officers more every day.

988
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:03,189
Well, I appreciate that, John.

989
01:23:03,523 --> 01:23:05,291
- I tell you--
- No, listen:

990
01:23:05,357 --> 01:23:09,628
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's setback.

991
01:23:09,695 --> 01:23:14,699
I just had to call and express my
admiration. Sorry I had to hurt...

992
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:17,701
one of you, but I had
no choice, right?

993
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:22,973
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to
say more but that'd ruin the surprise.

994
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:31,212
Got it.

995
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:37,551
Everybody back to work.

996
01:23:39,887 --> 01:23:41,155
You were right.

997
01:23:41,955 --> 01:23:43,122
He's preaching.

998
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:47,960
These murders are his sermons to us.

999
01:23:48,026 --> 01:23:50,896
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.

1000
01:23:54,065 --> 01:23:55,499
Who's the blonde?

1001
01:24:00,103 --> 01:24:01,404
Looks like a pro.

1002
01:24:01,771 --> 01:24:02,739
Maybe.

1003
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,175
She caught John Doe's eye.

1004
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:10,079
Wild Bills' Leather

1005
01:24:10,813 --> 01:24:14,415
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?

1006
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,184
- Yeah.
- This man?

1007
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,253
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1008
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:23,223
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.

1009
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,391
One sweet piece, actually.

1010
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:28,194
I thought he was a performance artist.

1011
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:30,262
You know the sort of guy that...

1012
01:24:30,328 --> 01:24:33,164
pisses in a cup on stage and then...

1013
01:24:33,231 --> 01:24:34,666
drinks it.

1014
01:24:34,733 --> 01:24:35,800
Performance art.

1015
01:24:36,133 --> 01:24:37,334
Right.

1016
01:24:40,304 --> 01:24:42,605
I think I undercharged him.

1017
01:24:42,672 --> 01:24:44,874
- You made this for him?
- I've made...

1018
01:24:44,941 --> 01:24:46,843
weirder shit than that.

1019
01:24:52,581 --> 01:24:54,082
They found the blonde.

1020
01:24:57,318 --> 01:24:58,753
The picture!

1021
01:24:58,819 --> 01:25:00,221
The picture!

1022
01:25:01,588 --> 01:25:03,323
Fucking pigs.

1023
01:25:05,258 --> 01:25:08,193
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...

1024
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,596
Get the fuck out of the booth.

1025
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:12,864
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1026
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:15,600
Come on, this way.

1027
01:25:22,606 --> 01:25:26,709
-Can you do something about the music?
-We're looking for the guy.

1028
01:25:39,787 --> 01:25:42,957
You from homicide?
You better see this.

1029
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:54,967
Get this thing off me.

1030
01:25:55,033 --> 01:25:57,068
Oh God, get it off of me.

1031
01:25:59,303 --> 01:26:00,738
Get him out of here, now!

1032
01:26:02,272 --> 01:26:03,940
I want to hear it again.

1033
01:26:04,274 --> 01:26:05,609
Tell me again.

1034
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:11,247
You heard nothing strange,
saw nothing strange.

1035
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:17,552
He asked me if I was married.

1036
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:20,120
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1037
01:26:20,187 --> 01:26:22,456
The what? What?

1038
01:26:22,522 --> 01:26:25,125
The prostitute. Where was she?

1039
01:26:25,192 --> 01:26:27,693
Someone comes to your establishment...

1040
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,697
they want to go downstairs,
get some oo-la-la. Whatever.

1041
01:26:32,197 --> 01:26:34,366
They got to come to you. Yeah?

1042
01:26:35,033 --> 01:26:36,034
Yeah.

1043
01:26:36,101 --> 01:26:37,435
You didn't see anyone?

1044
01:26:38,269 --> 01:26:41,705
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1045
01:26:41,772 --> 01:26:46,209
Everybody that comes in there's got
to be a package under their arms.

1046
01:26:46,276 --> 01:26:49,812
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1047
01:26:49,879 --> 01:26:51,880
She was just sitting on the bed.

1048
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:01,489
Who tied her down? You or him?

1049
01:27:01,556 --> 01:27:03,990
Do you like what you do for a living?

1050
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:06,059
All these things you see?

1051
01:27:06,126 --> 01:27:09,828
No, I don't.

1052
01:27:11,297 --> 01:27:13,399
But that's life, isn't it?

1053
01:27:17,735 --> 01:27:19,837
He had a gun. And...

1054
01:27:20,438 --> 01:27:22,506
he made it happen.

1055
01:27:25,142 --> 01:27:27,343
He made me do it.

1056
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:30,079
He put that thing on me.

1057
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,582
And he made me wear it.

1058
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:35,350
Then he...

1059
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,252
told me to fuck her.

1060
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:41,388
And I did. I fucked her.

1061
01:27:42,089 --> 01:27:43,757
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1062
01:27:43,824 --> 01:27:46,192
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1063
01:27:46,926 --> 01:27:49,596
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1064
01:27:49,996 --> 01:27:51,263
Fuck.

1065
01:27:54,099 --> 01:27:56,268
Oh, God. God.

1066
01:27:56,335 --> 01:27:59,203
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.

1067
01:28:17,785 --> 01:28:19,554
This won't have a happy ending.

1068
01:28:20,688 --> 01:28:23,290
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1069
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,795
If we catch John Doe and he turns out
to be the devil...

1070
01:28:29,862 --> 01:28:31,864
if he's Satan himself...

1071
01:28:31,931 --> 01:28:34,232
that might meet our expectations.

1072
01:28:34,866 --> 01:28:36,368
But he's not the devil.

1073
01:28:37,802 --> 01:28:39,471
He's just a man.

1074
01:28:40,037 --> 01:28:41,138
You know...

1075
01:28:41,872 --> 01:28:45,643
You bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.

1076
01:28:46,476 --> 01:28:49,646
If you think you're preparing me
for hard time...

1077
01:28:49,712 --> 01:28:50,747
thanks, but...

1078
01:28:51,314 --> 01:28:53,582
But you got to be a hero.

1079
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:56,318
You want to be a champion.

1080
01:28:56,385 --> 01:28:59,487
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...

1081
01:28:59,554 --> 01:29:02,823
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?

1082
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:04,324
I want to know.

1083
01:29:08,995 --> 01:29:11,697
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.

1084
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:14,633
Go on.

1085
01:29:17,502 --> 01:29:20,839
I don't think I can continue to live
in a place...

1086
01:29:20,905 --> 01:29:24,675
that embraces and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1087
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:26,743
You aren't different or better.

1088
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:29,512
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1089
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:32,849
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1090
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:34,850
Apathy is a solution.

1091
01:29:35,383 --> 01:29:41,288
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1092
01:29:41,355 --> 01:29:45,292
It's easier to steal what you want
than to earn it. It's easier...

1093
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:49,963
to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.

1094
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:55,133
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.

1095
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,802
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1096
01:29:56,869 --> 01:30:00,371
No, we're talking about
everyday life here.

1097
01:30:00,438 --> 01:30:03,708
You can't afford to be this naive.

1098
01:30:03,774 --> 01:30:05,542
Fuck off.

1099
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,143
See, you...

1100
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:09,145
You should listen to yourself.

1101
01:30:09,212 --> 01:30:11,313
Yeah. You say that...

1102
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,883
the problem is people don't care.

1103
01:30:14,717 --> 01:30:16,819
So, I don't care about people.

1104
01:30:16,886 --> 01:30:18,720
Nonsense. You know why?

1105
01:30:18,786 --> 01:30:20,221
You care?

1106
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:22,157
Want to know-- Damn right.

1107
01:30:22,223 --> 01:30:23,824
You'll make a difference.

1108
01:30:23,891 --> 01:30:26,393
Whatever. The point is that...

1109
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,396
you're not quitting
because you believe...

1110
01:30:29,462 --> 01:30:31,397
these things you say.

1111
01:30:31,464 --> 01:30:33,166
You want to believe them...

1112
01:30:33,232 --> 01:30:34,667
because you're quitting.

1113
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:41,339
And you want me to agree with you and
say "You're right, it's all fucked up.

1114
01:30:41,406 --> 01:30:45,576
It's a fucking mess. We should all go
live in a fucking log cabin."

1115
01:30:46,477 --> 01:30:47,911
But I won't.

1116
01:30:48,678 --> 01:30:50,580
I won't say that.

1117
01:30:51,714 --> 01:30:54,183
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1118
01:30:58,086 --> 01:30:58,921
I can't.

1119
01:31:09,329 --> 01:31:10,864
I'm going home.

1120
01:31:19,003 --> 01:31:20,205
Thank you, though.

1121
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:52,632
I love you.

1122
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:54,734
So much.

1123
01:32:02,874 --> 01:32:04,142
I know.

1124
01:33:04,358 --> 01:33:04,392
SUNDAY

1125
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:06,627
SUNDAY

1126
01:33:06,694 --> 01:33:08,895
What's your emergency?

1127
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:11,565
Could you repeat that?

1128
01:33:12,799 --> 01:33:14,467
I've done it again.

1129
01:33:21,473 --> 01:33:24,075
PRIDE

1130
01:33:24,642 --> 01:33:26,077
What have we got?

1131
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:28,145
Sleeping pills.

1132
01:33:29,313 --> 01:33:31,081
Glued to one hand.

1133
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:32,648
Telephone glued to the other.

1134
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:35,618
You see what he did?

1135
01:33:36,552 --> 01:33:38,120
He sliced her up.

1136
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:40,422
Then he bandaged her.

1137
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:42,757
Call for help and you'll live.

1138
01:33:42,824 --> 01:33:44,658
But you'll be disfigured.

1139
01:33:46,627 --> 01:33:49,163
Or put yourself out
of your own misery.

1140
01:33:50,164 --> 01:33:51,431
Come on.

1141
01:33:51,498 --> 01:33:52,932
He cut off her nose.

1142
01:33:52,999 --> 01:33:54,767
To spite her face.

1143
01:33:54,834 --> 01:33:56,935
And he did it very recently.

1144
01:34:04,408 --> 01:34:05,510
Listen...

1145
01:34:06,511 --> 01:34:09,513
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1146
01:34:09,579 --> 01:34:13,450
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe...

1147
01:34:13,517 --> 01:34:16,619
or he'll kill 7 and this case
will never end.

1148
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:20,022
Don't do me any favors. Thank you,
but I got it.

1149
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:24,959
I'm asking to be your partner a few
more days. You'd be doing me a favor.

1150
01:34:35,935 --> 01:34:38,137
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.

1151
01:34:39,105 --> 01:34:42,307
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.

1152
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:46,310
Detective?

1153
01:34:47,945 --> 01:34:49,647
After this I'm gone.

1154
01:34:50,448 --> 01:34:53,183
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1155
01:34:56,052 --> 01:34:57,553
You're looking for me.

1156
01:35:00,355 --> 01:35:01,457
Don't fucking move.

1157
01:35:01,523 --> 01:35:02,858
On the floor.

1158
01:35:02,925 --> 01:35:05,059
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.

1159
01:35:05,126 --> 01:35:06,327
I know you.

1160
01:35:06,394 --> 01:35:07,728
Now. Get down.

1161
01:35:08,296 --> 01:35:09,930
Get down on your stomach.

1162
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:11,431
You piece of shit. Now!

1163
01:35:12,098 --> 01:35:13,867
All the way. All the way...

1164
01:35:13,934 --> 01:35:15,435
fucker. Down.

1165
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:16,869
Faster.

1166
01:35:16,936 --> 01:35:19,104
Faster, fucker. Now.

1167
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:20,940
Nose on the ground.

1168
01:35:24,175 --> 01:35:27,278
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1169
01:35:27,345 --> 01:35:30,514
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1170
01:35:32,216 --> 01:35:33,550
Goddamn it.

1171
01:35:35,785 --> 01:35:40,388
He cuts the skin off the tips of his
fingers. That's why we couldn't...

1172
01:35:40,455 --> 01:35:42,624
find 1 print in his apartment.

1173
01:35:42,691 --> 01:35:44,960
Seems he's done that for a while.

1174
01:35:45,026 --> 01:35:47,628
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?

1175
01:35:47,695 --> 01:35:49,797
So far everything is a dead end.

1176
01:35:49,864 --> 01:35:52,632
No credit history.
No employment records.

1177
01:35:52,699 --> 01:35:55,902
A 5-year old bank account
opened with cash.

1178
01:35:55,969 --> 01:35:58,304
We've tried tracing his furniture.

1179
01:35:58,371 --> 01:36:00,072
All we know about him...

1180
01:36:00,139 --> 01:36:02,641
is that he's independently wealthy...

1181
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:04,575
well-educated...

1182
01:36:04,642 --> 01:36:06,077
and totally insane.

1183
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,579
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1184
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:13,150
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.

1185
01:36:13,216 --> 01:36:17,419
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.

1186
01:36:17,486 --> 01:36:18,654
There he sits.

1187
01:36:18,721 --> 01:36:21,090
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1188
01:36:21,157 --> 01:36:22,424
He's not finished.

1189
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:25,593
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1190
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:28,263
You know what I'm saying.

1191
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:32,332
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1192
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:33,934
He wouldn't just stop.

1193
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:36,002
So what the fuck, man?

1194
01:36:36,068 --> 01:36:39,672
He's 2 murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1195
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:42,607
We'll wait for his plea.

1196
01:36:46,011 --> 01:36:46,144
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1197
01:36:46,144 --> 01:36:50,681
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1198
01:36:50,748 --> 01:36:55,785
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them...

1199
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:57,954
and only at 6 o'clock today.

1200
01:36:58,021 --> 01:36:59,155
Why us?

1201
01:36:59,755 --> 01:37:01,457
He says he admires you.

1202
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:04,626
It's part of the game.

1203
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:08,963
If they don't accept this offer,
these bodies will never be found.

1204
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:11,665
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1205
01:37:13,033 --> 01:37:14,468
We've got him.

1206
01:37:14,534 --> 01:37:17,471
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1207
01:37:17,537 --> 01:37:20,039
He'll get his free room and board,
cable TV.

1208
01:37:20,106 --> 01:37:24,142
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?

1209
01:37:24,209 --> 01:37:28,546
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit...

1210
01:37:28,613 --> 01:37:32,983
and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.

1211
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,284
I don't like it.

1212
01:37:34,351 --> 01:37:36,285
The law requires me to serve...

1213
01:37:36,352 --> 01:37:39,889
my clients and their interests
as best I can.

1214
01:37:39,956 --> 01:37:42,157
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1215
01:37:42,224 --> 01:37:43,725
My client informs you that...

1216
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:46,495
if you do not accept,
he'll plead insanity.

1217
01:37:47,395 --> 01:37:48,829
Let him try it.

1218
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:50,731
I'd like to see it.

1219
01:37:50,798 --> 01:37:54,734
We know with the extreme nature
of these crimes I'd get him off...

1220
01:37:54,801 --> 01:37:56,236
with such a plea.

1221
01:37:56,302 --> 01:37:58,872
I won't let this conviction slide.

1222
01:37:58,938 --> 01:38:02,908
If you do accept under
his specific conditions, he'll sign...

1223
01:38:02,975 --> 01:38:05,744
a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1224
01:38:06,145 --> 01:38:08,379
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1225
01:38:09,981 --> 01:38:11,582
Full confession.

1226
01:38:11,649 --> 01:38:12,849
I'm in.

1227
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:14,751
It must be both of you.

1228
01:38:16,086 --> 01:38:18,355
If he were to claim insanity...

1229
01:38:18,422 --> 01:38:21,257
this conversation is admissible.

1230
01:38:21,657 --> 01:38:23,759
That he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1231
01:38:23,826 --> 01:38:26,861
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.

1232
01:38:26,928 --> 01:38:30,432
The press'd love to find out
the police weren't concerned...

1233
01:38:30,498 --> 01:38:32,866
about finding and burying them.

1234
01:38:32,933 --> 01:38:35,102
If in fact there are 2 more dead.

1235
01:38:35,169 --> 01:38:36,837
The lab report came.

1236
01:38:36,903 --> 01:38:39,605
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.

1237
01:38:39,672 --> 01:38:43,208
They found blood from Doe's fingers,
blood from...

1238
01:38:43,275 --> 01:38:46,711
the woman who's face he cut off,
and blood from...

1239
01:38:46,778 --> 01:38:48,380
a third party...

1240
01:38:48,447 --> 01:38:50,281
as yet unidentified.

1241
01:38:53,684 --> 01:38:56,052
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1242
01:38:58,955 --> 01:39:00,590
Let's finish it.

1243
01:39:04,293 --> 01:39:07,328
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO flies out...

1244
01:39:07,395 --> 01:39:09,730
I want you to expect it.

1245
01:39:11,632 --> 01:39:12,900
I will.

1246
01:39:15,702 --> 01:39:20,573
If I accidentally shaved off a nipple,
would it be covered by workman's comp?

1247
01:39:25,144 --> 01:39:26,578
I suppose so.

1248
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:31,082
If you were man enough
to file a claim...

1249
01:39:31,149 --> 01:39:33,951
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1250
01:39:34,985 --> 01:39:38,187
I keep coming home late,
my wife'll think something's up.

1251
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:48,263
You know...

1252
01:39:49,731 --> 01:39:50,765
Yeah.

1253
01:39:56,836 --> 01:39:57,837
What?

1254
01:41:07,963 --> 01:41:09,731
Will this wind hurt us?

1255
01:41:59,005 --> 01:42:00,240
Who are you, John?

1256
01:42:01,174 --> 01:42:02,609
Who are you really?

1257
01:42:03,176 --> 01:42:04,610
What do you mean?

1258
01:42:04,676 --> 01:42:08,580
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us about yourself?

1259
01:42:08,647 --> 01:42:12,283
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1260
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,185
Stay on your left up here.

1261
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:19,389
Where are we heading?

1262
01:42:20,624 --> 01:42:21,858
You'll see.

1263
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:25,728
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?

1264
01:42:26,362 --> 01:42:28,630
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1265
01:42:28,696 --> 01:42:31,466
You've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1266
01:42:32,767 --> 01:42:35,135
Wanting people to listen...

1267
01:42:35,202 --> 01:42:36,470
you can't just...

1268
01:42:36,537 --> 01:42:38,972
tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1269
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:41,541
You have to use a sledgehammer.

1270
01:42:41,607 --> 01:42:44,544
Then you'll get
their strict attention.

1271
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:46,212
But the question is:

1272
01:42:46,678 --> 01:42:49,481
Why're you so special
that people should listen?

1273
01:42:49,548 --> 01:42:51,049
I'm not special.

1274
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:54,151
I've never been exceptional.

1275
01:42:54,785 --> 01:42:57,555
This is, though. What I'm doing.

1276
01:42:57,621 --> 01:42:58,789
My work.

1277
01:42:58,855 --> 01:43:00,523
Your work, John?

1278
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,791
Yes.

1279
01:43:02,292 --> 01:43:05,294
See, I don't see anything special
about it, John.

1280
01:43:06,462 --> 01:43:07,863
That's not true.

1281
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:11,733
No, it is true. And the funny
thing is, all this work...

1282
01:43:12,133 --> 01:43:16,637
in 2 months, no one'll care,
or give a shit, or even remember.

1283
01:43:17,237 --> 01:43:19,740
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1284
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:22,509
But when this is done...

1285
01:43:23,743 --> 01:43:25,211
when it's finished...

1286
01:43:26,812 --> 01:43:28,547
it's going to be...

1287
01:43:31,416 --> 01:43:34,352
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1288
01:43:34,819 --> 01:43:37,087
But they won't be able to deny.

1289
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:40,190
Could the freak be more vague?

1290
01:43:41,158 --> 01:43:42,825
As far as master plans go...

1291
01:43:43,493 --> 01:43:45,762
I really can't wait for you to see.

1292
01:43:45,828 --> 01:43:47,596
It's going to be something.

1293
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:51,433
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.

1294
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,769
So when this thing happens,
be sure and let me know.

1295
01:43:54,835 --> 01:43:56,303
Don't want to miss it.

1296
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:58,039
Oh, don't worry.

1297
01:43:58,439 --> 01:43:59,707
You won't.

1298
01:44:01,608 --> 01:44:03,543
You won't miss a thing.

1299
01:44:30,298 --> 01:44:31,800
What's so exciting?

1300
01:44:32,867 --> 01:44:35,003
It's not too far now.

1301
01:44:42,209 --> 01:44:46,746
I've tried to figure something in my
head. Maybe you can help me out.

1302
01:44:48,513 --> 01:44:52,451
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are, do you know...

1303
01:44:52,884 --> 01:44:54,419
that you're insane?

1304
01:44:55,152 --> 01:44:57,054
Maybe you're reading...

1305
01:44:57,121 --> 01:44:59,256
masturbating in your own feces...

1306
01:44:59,323 --> 01:45:01,324
Do you just stop and go:

1307
01:45:01,391 --> 01:45:04,994
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1308
01:45:05,061 --> 01:45:07,763
You know? Do you guys do that?

1309
01:45:08,163 --> 01:45:11,166
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1310
01:45:11,233 --> 01:45:12,501
It's very comfortable.

1311
01:45:13,167 --> 01:45:16,337
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1312
01:45:16,838 --> 01:45:19,940
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1313
01:45:20,007 --> 01:45:21,174
Whatever.

1314
01:45:21,241 --> 01:45:23,510
I don't doubt that you believe that.

1315
01:45:24,244 --> 01:45:26,278
but it seems that you're...

1316
01:45:26,345 --> 01:45:28,447
overlooking a contradiction.

1317
01:45:28,514 --> 01:45:29,915
Meaning what?

1318
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:32,517
Glad you asked.

1319
01:45:34,185 --> 01:45:35,954
If you were chosen...

1320
01:45:36,021 --> 01:45:38,455
that is, by a higher...

1321
01:45:38,522 --> 01:45:40,457
power...

1322
01:45:40,524 --> 01:45:42,626
and if your hand was forced...

1323
01:45:43,027 --> 01:45:46,362
it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment.

1324
01:45:46,763 --> 01:45:49,298
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1325
01:45:50,365 --> 01:45:53,535
That doesn't seem to fit
with martyrdom, does it?

1326
01:45:55,037 --> 01:45:56,203
John?

1327
01:46:01,108 --> 01:46:05,879
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me...

1328
01:46:05,945 --> 01:46:07,647
in a room without windows.

1329
01:46:08,514 --> 01:46:09,882
Isn't that true?

1330
01:46:10,449 --> 01:46:11,884
How'd you like to...

1331
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:14,986
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.

1332
01:46:15,053 --> 01:46:16,821
I would never.

1333
01:46:16,888 --> 01:46:19,657
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1334
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:23,827
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1335
01:46:23,894 --> 01:46:26,562
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1336
01:46:27,129 --> 01:46:29,999
I won't deny my own personal desire...

1337
01:46:30,066 --> 01:46:32,233
to turn each sin against
the sinner.

1338
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:36,504
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1339
01:46:38,472 --> 01:46:41,175
Innocent? Is that supposed
to be funny?

1340
01:46:41,909 --> 01:46:43,577
An obese man.

1341
01:46:43,644 --> 01:46:46,179
Disgusting man who could barely stand.

1342
01:46:46,245 --> 01:46:50,749
You'd point him out to your friends
so that they'd join you in mocking him.

1343
01:46:50,816 --> 01:46:55,253
If you saw him while you ate,
you couldn't finish your meal.

1344
01:46:55,987 --> 01:46:59,557
Then the lawyer. You had to
secretly thank me for that.

1345
01:46:59,924 --> 01:47:03,026
This is a man who dedicated
his life...

1346
01:47:03,093 --> 01:47:07,864
to making money by lying with every
breath he could muster to keep...

1347
01:47:07,931 --> 01:47:09,865
murderers and rapists...

1348
01:47:09,932 --> 01:47:11,600
- on the streets.
- Murderers?

1349
01:47:12,501 --> 01:47:14,736
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman...

1350
01:47:14,802 --> 01:47:17,705
so ugly inside that she
couldn't go on living...

1351
01:47:17,772 --> 01:47:20,108
if she couldn't be beautiful outside?

1352
01:47:20,174 --> 01:47:24,544
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget...

1353
01:47:24,611 --> 01:47:27,413
the disease-spreading whore.

1354
01:47:29,648 --> 01:47:32,118
Only in a world this shitty...

1355
01:47:32,184 --> 01:47:36,021
could you say they were innocent
and keep a straight face.

1356
01:47:39,024 --> 01:47:40,724
But that's the point.

1357
01:47:42,126 --> 01:47:45,294
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1358
01:47:45,361 --> 01:47:46,896
in every home and we...

1359
01:47:47,363 --> 01:47:48,297
tolerate it.

1360
01:47:48,865 --> 01:47:51,633
We tolerate it because it's common.

1361
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:53,135
It's trivial.

1362
01:47:53,702 --> 01:47:56,304
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1363
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:01,409
Well, not anymore.

1364
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:05,745
I'm setting the example.

1365
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:09,082
And what I've done will be...

1366
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:10,482
puzzled over...

1367
01:48:10,983 --> 01:48:12,484
and studied...

1368
01:48:13,652 --> 01:48:15,087
and followed...

1369
01:48:16,888 --> 01:48:18,089
forever.

1370
01:48:18,823 --> 01:48:20,091
Yeah.

1371
01:48:21,326 --> 01:48:22,559
Delusions of grandeur.

1372
01:48:24,661 --> 01:48:26,430
You should be thanking me.

1373
01:48:26,897 --> 01:48:28,264
Why's that, John?

1374
01:48:28,331 --> 01:48:31,500
Because you'll be remembered
after this.

1375
01:48:31,567 --> 01:48:35,503
Realize, Detective, the only reason
that I'm here now...

1376
01:48:35,570 --> 01:48:37,672
is that I wanted to be.

1377
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:40,441
No. We would have got you eventually.

1378
01:48:40,507 --> 01:48:41,942
Oh, really?

1379
01:48:42,009 --> 01:48:46,245
So what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

1380
01:48:46,746 --> 01:48:49,849
Allowing 5 "innocent" people
to die until...

1381
01:48:49,916 --> 01:48:52,351
you felt like springing your trap?

1382
01:48:52,417 --> 01:48:54,353
What was the indisputable...

1383
01:48:54,419 --> 01:48:57,456
evidence you were going to use on me,
right before...

1384
01:48:57,522 --> 01:49:01,192
I walked up to you and put my hands
in the air?

1385
01:49:01,258 --> 01:49:03,461
John. Calm down.

1386
01:49:03,527 --> 01:49:06,029
I remember us knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:08,298
That's right.

1388
01:49:08,365 --> 01:49:11,700
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:49:16,205 --> 01:49:18,773
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1390
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,541
Okay. Sit back.

1391
01:49:20,608 --> 01:49:22,644
- I spared you.
- Sit back.

1392
01:49:22,709 --> 01:49:25,212
Remember that when you
look in the mirror...

1393
01:49:25,278 --> 01:49:27,481
for the rest of your life...

1394
01:49:27,547 --> 01:49:31,050
or should I say for the rest
of what life I allow you...

1395
01:49:31,117 --> 01:49:32,485
to have.

1396
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:34,487
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1397
01:49:34,553 --> 01:49:36,121
Shut your fucking mouth!

1398
01:49:37,622 --> 01:49:42,059
You're no messiah. You're a movie
of the week. A fucking tee shirt...

1399
01:49:42,459 --> 01:49:43,994
at best.

1400
01:49:57,239 --> 01:49:59,573
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1401
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:04,011
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:04,078 --> 01:50:08,682
Is that to say, John, that what
you were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:11,917 --> 01:50:14,687
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1404
01:50:16,922 --> 01:50:19,357
Do you see those high-tension towers?

1405
01:50:19,424 --> 01:50:21,259
That's where we're headed.

1406
01:50:21,326 --> 01:50:23,927
I see it. 9 o'clock,
and follow that road.

1407
01:50:38,106 --> 01:50:40,942
There sure as shit is no ambush
out here.

1408
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:43,110
No fucking nothing out here.

1409
01:50:43,944 --> 01:50:47,114
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.

1410
01:50:47,181 --> 01:50:49,282
I want you to go way up.

1411
01:50:49,349 --> 01:50:52,719
In thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.

1412
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:55,604
I'll get him.

1413
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:03,678
Get out.

1414
01:52:04,578 --> 01:52:05,846
Slowly.

1415
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:07,781
Stop.

1416
01:52:08,581 --> 01:52:09,849
Stay.

1417
01:52:13,019 --> 01:52:14,286
What do you got?

1418
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,122
A dead dog.

1419
01:52:18,857 --> 01:52:20,591
I didn't do that.

1420
01:52:27,264 --> 01:52:28,465
What time is it?

1421
01:52:29,266 --> 01:52:30,133
Why?

1422
01:52:30,534 --> 01:52:31,934
I'd like to know.

1423
01:52:35,271 --> 01:52:36,372
7:01.

1424
01:52:39,608 --> 01:52:40,775
It's close.

1425
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:42,978
Let's go take a look.

1426
01:52:46,614 --> 01:52:47,815
It's this way.

1427
01:53:36,255 --> 01:53:38,524
Down. Down. Down.

1428
01:53:40,258 --> 01:53:41,426
Watch him.

1429
01:53:42,994 --> 01:53:44,062
There he goes.

1430
01:53:45,162 --> 01:53:47,331
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1431
01:53:53,469 --> 01:53:56,406
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.

1432
01:54:04,011 --> 01:54:05,546
A van's coming down the road.

1433
01:54:05,947 --> 01:54:07,048
From the north.

1434
01:54:16,422 --> 01:54:20,392
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.

1435
01:54:26,197 --> 01:54:27,231
Get out!

1436
01:54:29,866 --> 01:54:30,901
Out!

1437
01:54:30,968 --> 01:54:33,136
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.

1438
01:54:33,203 --> 01:54:34,470
Step away.

1439
01:54:35,204 --> 01:54:37,206
Turn around. Hands on your head.

1440
01:54:37,807 --> 01:54:39,041
What's going on?

1441
01:54:39,975 --> 01:54:41,142
Why are you here?

1442
01:54:41,209 --> 01:54:45,146
I'm delivering a package
for this guy, David.

1443
01:54:45,213 --> 01:54:46,580
Detective...

1444
01:54:46,647 --> 01:54:47,915
David Mills.

1445
01:54:55,054 --> 01:54:56,990
Get it. Slowly.

1446
01:55:09,634 --> 01:55:12,335
A guy paid me $500
to bring it out here.

1447
01:55:12,402 --> 01:55:14,604
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.

1448
01:55:15,171 --> 01:55:16,438
Put it down.

1449
01:55:17,573 --> 01:55:18,941
We got a box.

1450
01:55:19,008 --> 01:55:21,610
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.

1451
01:55:21,677 --> 01:55:23,311
Bomb squad. We got a box.

1452
01:55:23,378 --> 01:55:24,946
Face the van.

1453
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,848
Hands up.

1454
01:55:34,587 --> 01:55:35,454
Turn.

1455
01:55:37,123 --> 01:55:38,457
Okay. Go.

1456
01:55:38,524 --> 01:55:40,026
Off you go. Go.

1457
01:55:42,227 --> 01:55:44,329
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1458
01:55:47,965 --> 01:55:49,400
He's headed north, along the road.

1459
01:55:49,466 --> 01:55:50,734
Have him picked up.

1460
01:56:00,409 --> 01:56:02,010
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

1461
01:56:08,583 --> 01:56:10,084
I'm going to open it.

1462
01:56:10,151 --> 01:56:13,353
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1463
01:56:32,803 --> 01:56:33,870
It's blood.

1464
01:56:33,937 --> 01:56:36,539
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.

1465
01:56:36,606 --> 01:56:40,209
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1466
01:57:07,865 --> 01:57:09,400
California, stay away from here.

1467
01:57:09,467 --> 01:57:12,068
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.

1468
01:57:12,135 --> 01:57:14,204
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1469
01:57:15,138 --> 01:57:17,240
John Doe has the upper hand.

1470
01:57:18,807 --> 01:57:20,142
Here he comes.

1471
01:57:20,209 --> 01:57:22,144
- Throw your gun down!
- What?

1472
01:57:22,211 --> 01:57:24,412
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.

1473
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:25,680
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1474
01:57:27,215 --> 01:57:29,050
Do you hear me, Detective?

1475
01:57:29,117 --> 01:57:30,784
I'm trying to tell you how much...

1476
01:57:30,851 --> 01:57:33,353
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1477
01:57:34,288 --> 01:57:35,455
What?

1478
01:57:35,522 --> 01:57:36,722
Tracy.

1479
01:57:37,623 --> 01:57:40,226
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing...

1480
01:57:40,293 --> 01:57:43,228
how easily a member of the press
can purchase...

1481
01:57:43,295 --> 01:57:45,230
information from the men
in your precinct.

1482
01:57:45,297 --> 01:57:47,132
What the fuck?

1483
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:49,400
Throw your gun down!

1484
01:57:49,466 --> 01:57:51,468
I visited your home this morning...

1485
01:57:52,303 --> 01:57:53,971
after you left.

1486
01:57:54,804 --> 01:57:56,606
I tried to play husband.

1487
01:57:57,140 --> 01:58:00,742
I tried to taste the life
of a simple man.

1488
01:58:00,809 --> 01:58:02,077
Throw it away!

1489
01:58:02,144 --> 01:58:04,313
It didn't work out.

1490
01:58:04,379 --> 01:58:06,148
So...

1491
01:58:06,214 --> 01:58:08,149
I took a souvenir.

1492
01:58:09,817 --> 01:58:11,719
Her pretty head.

1493
01:58:16,556 --> 01:58:19,091
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.

1494
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:20,426
What's goin' on over there?

1495
01:58:20,492 --> 01:58:22,528
Would you... Put the gun down.

1496
01:58:22,595 --> 01:58:23,996
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?

1497
01:58:24,063 --> 01:58:25,930
Because I envy your normal life.

1498
01:58:25,997 --> 01:58:27,165
Put the gun down, David.

1499
01:58:27,232 --> 01:58:29,100
It seems that envy is my sin.

1500
01:58:29,167 --> 01:58:31,101
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.

1501
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,603
What's in the fucking box?

1502
01:58:33,003 --> 01:58:34,671
He just told you.

1503
01:58:34,738 --> 01:58:37,907
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!

1504
01:58:38,241 --> 01:58:41,410
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.

1505
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:46,915
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.

1506
01:58:46,982 --> 01:58:49,184
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.

1507
01:58:49,251 --> 01:58:50,517
She's all right. You tell me.

1508
01:58:50,584 --> 01:58:51,785
Become...

1509
01:58:51,852 --> 01:58:52,953
wrath.

1510
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:54,188
Tell me she's all right!

1511
01:58:54,755 --> 01:58:56,289
If you murder a suspect, David...

1512
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:59,692
you just throw it all away
and he knows it.

1513
01:59:00,326 --> 01:59:02,461
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!

1514
01:59:02,527 --> 01:59:04,796
She begged for her life...

1515
01:59:04,863 --> 01:59:06,865
and for the life of the baby
inside of her.

1516
01:59:25,381 --> 01:59:26,714
He didn't know.

1517
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,228
Give me the gun, David.

1518
01:59:50,234 --> 01:59:51,835
If you kill him...

1519
01:59:53,304 --> 01:59:54,672
he will win.

1520
01:59:58,975 --> 02:00:00,843
Oh God!

1521
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:02,345
Oh God!

1522
02:01:11,802 --> 02:01:13,404
Well, we'll take care of him.

1523
02:01:22,645 --> 02:01:24,413
Whatever he needs.

1524
02:01:25,548 --> 02:01:27,116
Where you gonna be?

1525
02:01:29,817 --> 02:01:31,085
Around.

1526
02:01:35,556 --> 02:01:36,990
I'll be around.

1527
02:01:41,327 --> 02:01:43,663
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1528
02:01:43,729 --> 02:01:47,432
The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

1529
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,102
I agree with the second part.
