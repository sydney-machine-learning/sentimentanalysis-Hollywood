1
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:46,404
Now here comes
the president's helicopter...

2
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:48,022
...Marine Helicopter Number 1...

3
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:52,368
...landing in the plaza on the east side
of the east front of the Capitol.

4
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:56,539
The helicopter hovering gently
just off the ground.

5
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,749
Amazing timing.

6
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,335
The president flying
all the way across the world...

7
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:03,838
...across the Atlantic Ocean,
arriving almost exactly...

8
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:08,051
Exactly as scheduled,
at 9:30 in the Capitol plaza...

9
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:11,137
...so he can go up the steps
of the House of Representatives...

10
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,472
...go into the chamber...

11
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:16,142
...and address the members of the House
and the Senate, Supreme Court...

12
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,227
...the diplomatic corps of Washington...

13
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:21,189
...all of whom are inside waiting for him
in the chamber.

14
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,990
Mr. Speaker,
the president of the United States.

15
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:37,054
And the president,
accompanied by the Escort Committee...

16
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,855
...comes down the central aisle,
approaching the podium.

17
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,836
He greets members of his cabinet...

18
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,714
...and those who are waiting
to be confirmed as members...

19
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:49,741
...as he reaches the rostrum.

20
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:55,348
Shakes hands with the Speaker,
Carl Albert.

21
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,016
A happy president, smiling.

22
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,979
Ladies and gentlemen,
President Nixon will, in a moment...

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,780
...address the Congress
and the people of the United States.

24
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:10,185
Thank you.

25
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,980
Car 727, Car 727.

26
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:12,781
Open door at the Watergate office building.
Possible burglary. See the security guard.

27
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:17,240
Are you sure you want us?
517 is closer, and they're in uniform.

28
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:20,215
They're getting gas. You take it.

29
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,720
Unit 1 to Unit 2.

30
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,895
Unit 1 to Unit 2.

31
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:51,538
- What?
- We're home.

32
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,509
Base 1 to Unit 1.

33
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,962
Base 1 to Unit 1.

34
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,590
We have some activity here.

35
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:17,258
Silence is advised.

36
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,534
Shut it off.

37
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,774
Base 1 to Unit 1.

38
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,493
Lights on the eighth floor.

39
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:39,534
Base 1 to Unit 1.

40
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,451
Is there anybody there?

41
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:51,748
There's people, people on the balcony.
Armed people.

42
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,022
Base 1 to Unit 1.

43
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:01,969
Base 1 to Unit 1.
We may have some problems.

44
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:09,042
Someone's here.

45
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,896
Hold it, you...

46
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:37,443
Police.

47
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,086
Put your hands up.

48
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,637
Drop that jacket.

49
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:58,776
Walkie-talkie, two 35-mm cameras.

50
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:03,406
Got it. That's good. All right, stay there.

51
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,616
I got something for you. Did you see this?

52
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:09,286
Couple sleeping in bed, car hits the house,
goes through their bedroom.

53
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:12,999
Good morning. Crash.
Louis is over at Democratic headquarters.

54
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,800
One of the burglars had $814,
one $230, one $215, and one $234.

55
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:24,176
Most of it was in $100 bills,
and in sequence.

56
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,553
- Woodward?
- Yup.

57
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:28,472
Break-in at Democratic headquarters.
There's been an arrest.

58
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,975
- Local Democratic headquarters.
- Bugging the place.

59
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:33,436
Check the time of arraignment
and get over there.

60
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:36,480
And, Woodward,
it was National Democratic Headquarters.

61
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,224
Right.

62
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,444
- Anything else?
- Anything else?

63
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:44,238
Break-in, car crash.
That's not bad for a Saturday.

64
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,556
Let me know what happens.

65
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:46,666
- Hello, Carl.
- Hi.

66
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,075
Got anything on that couple?

67
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,653
I know somebody on the staff at Watergate.
Want me...?

68
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:53,681
Why don't you finish one story
before trying to get on another?

69
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,374
I finished it.

70
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,752
- The Virginia Legislature story?
- I finished it.

71
00:07:57,753 --> 00:07:59,587
All right, give it to me.

72
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,338
I'm just polishing it.

73
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:06,007
- I'll work the phones.
- Polishing it. Yeah, you work the phones.

74
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,055
- Who cares?
- What about property damage?

75
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,223
Sorry, who are the lawy...?
Excuse me, sorry.

76
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,268
Who are the lawyers
for the five men arrested at Watergate?

77
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,854
- Do you know?
- Well, these two were assigned to it.

78
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:18,064
Sorry?

79
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,274
These two were appointed to the case.

80
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:23,244
Only now it turns out
the burglars have their own counsel.

81
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,654
- The burglars have their own counsel?
- Right.

82
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:29,658
- That's kind of unusual, wouldn't you say?
- For burglars it's unusual.

83
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,452
Do you know the name of the counsel?

84
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,621
I don't know. Some country-club type.

85
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:36,332
You are charged
with soliciting prostitution...

86
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,210
...at 14th and U Streets Northwest.

87
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:46,050
Your Honor,
Mr. Socket has in the past been reliable...

88
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:48,677
...for court appearances when ordered.

89
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:51,555
I think $300
would subsequently be suggested....

90
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:54,223
Excuse me, what is your name?

91
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:58,534
I'm Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.

92
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,648
- Markham.
- Markham?

93
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,162
Mr. Markham, are you here in connection
with the Watergate burglary?

94
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:07,544
I'm not here.

95
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,743
Okay.

96
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,955
Well, clearly, I am here...

97
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,375
...but only as an individual,
not as the attorney of record.

98
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:21,335
Who is?

99
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,899
Mr. Starkey.

100
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,465
- Do you have any kind of...?
- Whatever you want...

101
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,342
...you'll have to get from him.

102
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:30,958
I have nothing more to say.

103
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:41,957
Uh, Starkey. S-T....

104
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:47,903
Mr. Starkey was very helpful.

105
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:52,199
Four Cuban-Americans and another man,
James W. McCord.

106
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,369
Look, I told you inside,
I have nothing more to say.

107
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,729
I understand that.

108
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:01,208
What I don't understand
is how you got here.

109
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,753
I assure you
there's nothing very mysterious involved.

110
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:07,214
Well, I was talking
to a couple of the lawyers...

111
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,466
...assigned to represent the burglars.

112
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,676
So?

113
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,262
They never would've been assigned
to the burglars...

114
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:16,557
...had anyone known the burglars
had arranged for their own counsel.

115
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:18,976
The burglars couldn't have
arranged their counsel.

116
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:21,540
They never even made a phone call.

117
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:25,608
So if no one asked you to be here,
why are you here?

118
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:28,152
- Don't take this personally, Mr....
- Woodward.

119
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:32,114
Woodward.
It would be a mistake to do that.

120
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:33,750
I just don't have anything to say.

121
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:40,748
Your Honor, Mr. Betts
is a young man with no prior record.

122
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:45,549
The defense has suggested a release
on personal bond.

123
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:50,094
Did one of the other men
involved in the break-in call you?

124
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,053
What reason do you have to assume
there were other people involved?

125
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,847
One of your clients was arrested
with a walkie-talkie.

126
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:59,934
They're not my clients.

127
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:04,104
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
- You're a lawyer and you're here.

128
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:08,905
Well, uh, one of the defendants, Mr. Barker,
and I met at a social occasion once.

129
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,498
Where?

130
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,198
- I have nothing else to say.
- A Miami social occasion?

131
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,743
Mr. Starkey says the Cubans
were from Miami.

132
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,497
L-62, James McCord.
L-63, Bernard Barker.

133
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:24,333
L-64, Virgilio Gonzalez.

134
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,669
L-65, Eugenio Martinez.

135
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,588
L-66, Frank Sturgis.

136
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,389
Please step forward, Attorney Starkey.
All charged with burglary two.

137
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:39,556
- And, Mr. Starkey, you represent all five?
- Yes, Your Honor.

138
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:42,977
And are all five gentlemen charged
with burglary in the second degree?

139
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,186
Yes, Your Honor.

140
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:46,981
Your names, please,
and state your professions.

141
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:50,693
Bernard Barker, anti-Communist.

142
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:55,494
Anti-Communist?
That, sir, is not your average profession.

143
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,536
McCORD:
James McCord, security consultant.

144
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:01,829
Where?

145
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,124
McCORD:
Government. Uh, recently retired.

146
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,042
Where in the government?

147
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,378
McCORD:
Central Intelligence Agency.

148
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:10,713
Where?

149
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:12,611
McCORD: The CIA.

150
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:16,510
Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator.

151
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,971
Holy shit.

152
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,890
Eugenio Martinez,
known as Gene Valdez.

153
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,226
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.

154
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:28,105
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.
All five of the men had at least one alias.

155
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:30,983
Any proof they were trying
to bug the Democratic chairman?

156
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,693
It's obvious they were trying to.

157
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:35,237
They wouldn't go to that trouble
to bug secretaries.

158
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:37,906
- There's no proof.
- I called a lawyer in Miami I know.

159
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:40,868
He said four of the guys that were arrested
were from Miami.

160
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,661
Gonzalez, Martinez, Sturgis and, uh....

161
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,871
- Barker.
- Yeah, Barker.

162
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:46,707
And all four of them were involved
in CIA activities and...

163
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,334
- No, only one.
- Yeah, and they...

164
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:51,795
No, only one of them was admitted CIA,
and the CIA won't confirm that.

165
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,922
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.

166
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,759
But it's obvious
that with all that money and equipment...

167
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,012
...they weren't out to, you know,
work by themselves.

168
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,221
Somebody hired them.

169
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,766
I'm interested in what you know.

170
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,727
We don't know why they wanted
to bug Democratic headquarters.

171
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:10,397
Whether they were working for themselves,
other individuals, organizations.

172
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,316
Could be a story or just crazy Cubans.

173
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:14,485
Bachinski, when you get there,
take it easy.

174
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,536
The police are nervous.

175
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,790
- Yeah?
- Calling from police headquarters.

176
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,418
A friend just showed me what they found
in the hotel rooms of the burglars.

177
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,587
There's something
you might wanna look into.

178
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:35,130
Hang on.

179
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:36,298
Okay, go ahead.

180
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,343
There's a strange entry
in two of the burglars' address books.

181
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:43,263
- Yeah?
- One says "H.H. at W.H."

182
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:46,495
The other says
"Howard Hunt, W. House."

183
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:52,064
You can dial the White House direct,
can't you?

184
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,899
- Yeah.
- What's the number?

185
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,700
456-1414.

186
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,833
- White House.
- Howard Hunt, please.

187
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,085
Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.

188
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,839
He might be in Mr. Colson's office.
I'll connect you.

189
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,890
Thank you.

190
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,635
- Charles Colson's office.
- Howard Hunt, please.

191
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,679
Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.

192
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,974
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- No, I don't.

193
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,183
Okay, thank you.

194
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,727
- Have you tried the Mullen firm?
- I beg your pardon?

195
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:33,897
He also works as a writer
at Mullen and Company Public Relations.

196
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:37,818
- You have a phone on that or an address?
- No, I don't. I'm sorry.

197
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,510
All right, thank you.

198
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:42,948
Do you know
in a survey taken, 10.9 percent...?

199
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,744
Harry.

200
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,661
Who's Charles Colson?

201
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:50,372
Who's Charles Colson?

202
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,219
Sit down.

203
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,668
I'm glad you asked me that question.

204
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,005
The reason I'm glad is because
if you had asked Simons or Bradlee...

205
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,214
...they would've said:

206
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:03,385
"You know, we're gonna have to fire this
schmuck at once because he's so dumb."

207
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:05,077
Who is Charles Colson?

208
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,600
The most powerful man
in the United States is President Nixon.

209
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,292
You've heard of him?

210
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,981
Charles Colson is special counsel
to the president.

211
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,495
There's a cartoon on his wall.

212
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:22,154
Caption reads,
"When you've got them by the balls...

213
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,239
...their hearts and minds will follow."

214
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,907
Do you have a list of receipts?

215
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:30,662
Hello, Mr. Murray?
This is Ivy Mills of the Washington Post.

216
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,914
I'd like to know if....

217
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:33,081
Mullen and Company.

218
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:36,460
- Howard Hunt, please.
- One moment, please.

219
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:38,665
Howard Hunt here.

220
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:41,924
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.

221
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:44,176
Yes. Yes, what is it?

222
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,845
I was just wondering
why your name and phone number...

223
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:50,724
...were in the address books
of two of the men arrested at Watergate.

224
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,314
Good God.

225
00:15:52,894 --> 00:15:55,771
- Do you care to comment?
- The matter is under adjudication.

226
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,874
I have no comment.

227
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:01,109
- Hello?
- This is Bob Woodward...

228
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,486
...of the Washington Post.

229
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,864
I was told that you had worked
with a Mr. Howard Hunt.

230
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,454
Why would anyone say that?

231
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:09,785
You do know Mr. Hunt?

232
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:11,119
No, I don't believe so...

233
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,622
...and I can't imagine
why anyone would say that.

234
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:16,416
I'm really sorry, but I was on my way out.
Goodbye.

235
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:21,187
Could we just confirm a couple...? Bye.

236
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,967
Did you say the Washington Post?

237
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:26,510
Yes, that's right, the Post.

238
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,971
Your publishing firm
was listed in some papers...

239
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,806
...in connection with a Howard Hunt.

240
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:35,477
Yeah. Yeah, he's one of our authors.
He wrote spy novels, I think.

241
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:38,855
What type of spy novels were they?
Were they modern or period...?

242
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:41,525
You say "wrote"?
You mean he's no longer with you?

243
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,734
No, not at this time.

244
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,445
How long has it been
since you heard from him?

245
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:50,246
- Couple of years, I think.
- Tell me the names of novels he's written.

246
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:55,122
Hello? Is this Mr. Paul Herrera?

247
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,332
This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.

248
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:01,128
Bob Woodward of the Wash...
Do you speak English?

249
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:08,848
Hey, do any of you guys speak English...?
Or do any of you guys speak Spanish?

250
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:24,572
Never mind. Thank you.
Thank you. Never mind.

251
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,365
- What's the slug on the Mandel story?
- What?

252
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:31,950
- Hello?
- Mr. Bennett?

253
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,453
- Yes?
- Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.

254
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,787
I'm sorry to bother you.

255
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:40,208
I wonder if you could confirm information
on one of your employees, Howard Hunt?

256
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,543
What kind of information?

257
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,211
Just profile information mostly.

258
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:45,631
We know that he works
for Mullen and Company...

259
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,342
...or did work for Mullen and Company
as a writer.

260
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,551
He's also a novelist.

261
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:53,055
We know that he works in the office
of Charles Colson at the White House.

262
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:55,057
And the CIA.

263
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:57,059
And the CIA.

264
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,145
Well, if you're conducting
that kind of an investigation...

265
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:04,358
...certainly it comes as no surprise to you
that Howard was with the CIA.

266
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,871
No, no surprise at all.

267
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:11,239
Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.

268
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,575
From '49 to '70.
This is on deep background...

269
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:16,244
...but the FBI thinks he's involved
with the break-in.

270
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,412
What else you got?

271
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:21,166
According to White House personnel,
Hunt worked as a consultant for Colson.

272
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,836
That's Charles Colson,
the president's special counsel.

273
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,923
- Did you call the White House Press Office?
- I went over there.

274
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:30,550
They said Hunt hadn't worked there
for three months.

275
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:34,295
Then a PR guy
said this weird thing to me.

276
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:37,557
He said,
"I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson..."

277
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,436
...nor anyone else at the White House
had any knowledge of or participation in...

278
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:45,732
"...this deplorable incident
at the Democratic National Committee."

279
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,318
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?

280
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,601
Absolutely.

281
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,195
So?

282
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:54,114
I never asked about Watergate.

283
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,703
I simply asked what were Hunt's duties
at the White House.

284
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,909
They volunteered he was innocent
when nobody asked if he was guilty.

285
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:06,083
Be careful how you write it.

286
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:10,340
We got a White House consultant
linked to the bugging.

287
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,926
This isn't a police story anymore.
This is national.

288
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:16,471
- We need a top political writer on it.
- Well, they don't want it.

289
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:18,890
They're all over the map
covering the primaries.

290
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,936
- Besides, this guy has busted his ass.
- He's been on this paper for nine months.

291
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:25,105
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a humper.

292
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,774
What's he been writing about,
rat shit in restaurants?

293
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,026
- He's got no experience.
- He got a few closed.

294
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:32,154
Minor incidents.
Small government agencies.

295
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:35,532
Have Mr. Moffitt come in here, please.
And see if Mr. Bradlee's free.

296
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,825
I want Ben to hear this.

297
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:40,328
Sure, Moffitt will want the story
now that we've built it into something.

298
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,038
Even Bernstein's busting his ass.

299
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,167
I read that cockamamie memorandum
he wrote on the break-in.

300
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:49,212
- All right, so some of it was bullshit.
- What is the matter with you?

301
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:52,883
You told me yourself
you were gonna fire him last month.

302
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:57,684
Look, he wants on the story bad.
They both do.

303
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,429
He knows a lot of people.

304
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:04,519
Howard, they're hungry.
You remember when you were hungry?

305
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:11,242
Don't worry about it.

306
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,078
I'll be home late.

307
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,123
Did you get the artwork on that piece?

308
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,043
- Hold on.
- Hey, listen, where's the artwork?

309
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,045
I gotta have a cigarette.

310
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:42,808
Yeah, he'll be in in about
half an hour. Can I have him call you?

311
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,141
Okay.

312
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:49,731
Metro Desk.

313
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,151
No, I'm sorry, he's not.

314
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,736
Yes, I will. Can you tell me who's calling?

315
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,781
All right. Yes, hold on.

316
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:59,730
Thank you.

317
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,517
You want a laugh?

318
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,174
Hello.

319
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:11,174
Has anyone seen my scarf?

320
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:17,968
Hey, look, do we have a lead
for the metro page?

321
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:20,276
Yeah, yeah. Uh....

322
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:26,768
Lou. Hey, Lou.
Can you get me Mandel's office, please?

323
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,061
- Yeah.
- All right.

324
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:30,605
Listen, I want his comment
about that appointment.

325
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:31,773
- Okay.
- Right away.

326
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,149
- All right.
- Right away.

327
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,123
- How's it going?
- What are you doing?

328
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:50,000
- I'm polishing a little.
- You're what?

329
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:51,877
- Polishing it.
- What's wrong with it?

330
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:54,588
- Nothing, nothing. It's good.
- Then what are you doing?

331
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:57,511
I'm just helping. It's a little fuzzy.

332
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:58,842
May I have it?

333
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:02,345
- I don't think you're saying what you mean.
- I know exactly what I mean.

334
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:05,390
I can't tell whether Hunt works for Colson
or Colson for Hunt.

335
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,600
May I have it, please?

336
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:08,351
- Your conclusions...
- May I have it?

337
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:10,645
- I'm not looking for a fight.
- I'm not either.

338
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:14,698
I'm just aware of the fact
that you've only been here nine months.

339
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,610
What's that got to do with anything?

340
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:19,404
- Been in the business since I'm 16.
- What are you saying?

341
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,489
If you'd read mine and then read yours...

342
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,003
- May I read yours?
- Yeah.

343
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:27,954
I gave yours a glance, it didn't look right,
so I figured I'd refine it a little.

344
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:31,541
First paragraph has to have more clarity
if the reader's gonna understand.

345
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,794
You don't mention Colson's name
until the third paragraph.

346
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:38,965
I think mine's better, but if you think
yours is better, we'll give yours to the desk.

347
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,684
I've got Colson's name up front.

348
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:46,088
- He was a consultant and nobody knows it.
- You're right.

349
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,595
Yours is better.

350
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,823
Do it right. Here are my notes.
If you're gonna hype it, hype it with facts.

351
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:07,927
I don't mind what you did.
I mind the way you did it.

352
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:11,081
Woodward, Bernstein,
you're both on the story.

353
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:13,235
Now, don't fuck it up.

354
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:22,425
Steuben, what's the name
of that girl that you bombed out with...

355
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:26,068
- ...who works in Colson's office?
- Sharon Lyons.

356
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:29,057
Why are you looking at me like that?

357
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:31,935
- You're attractive.
- Jesus.

358
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,979
You are very attractive.

359
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,606
You know, my girlfriend told me
to watch out for you.

360
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:40,318
- Who?
- I'm not giving any names.

361
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,499
Steuben said you work for Colson.

362
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:48,076
Steuben's crazy.
I never worked for Colson.

363
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:51,037
- That's what he said.
- I worked for an assistant.

364
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,165
Colson was really big on secrets anyway.

365
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:58,966
Even if I had worked for him,
I wouldn't know anything.

366
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:02,257
Did you know Howard Hunt?

367
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:04,843
- Didn't he work in the office?
- Yeah, I knew Howard.

368
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,178
- Nice?
- He's a nice person.

369
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,640
He's secretive.
He's secretive but a decent man.

370
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:14,769
Do you have any idea what he did?

371
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,106
Well, the White House said
he was doing some investigative work.

372
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:19,315
What do you say?

373
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:24,055
- He was doing investigative work.
- On what?

374
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:29,731
- Different things.
- Like what?

375
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,828
- I'm not gonna...
- She warned me.

376
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:35,264
I'm not gonna take my book out.
I'm just asking you.

377
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,918
Well, the scuttlebutt for a while
was that he was investigating Kennedy.

378
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:40,462
Why?

379
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:44,565
The White House was real paranoid
about Teddy Kennedy.

380
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:48,511
I remember seeing a book
about Chappaquiddick on his desk.

381
00:24:48,512 --> 00:24:50,221
He was always getting material...

382
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,349
...out of the White House library
and the Library of Congress.

383
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,017
Anything he could find.

384
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,646
White House library.

385
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:01,149
Hi, this is Carl Bernstein,
of the Washington Post.

386
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,651
I was wondering
if you can remember any books...

387
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:07,322
...that a Howard Hunt checked out
on Senator Kennedy?

388
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:10,283
- Howard Hunt? Um....
- Yes, ma'am.

389
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:13,495
- Yes, I think I do remember.
- Uh-huh.

390
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:15,997
He took out a whole lot of material.

391
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:20,798
- Why don't you hold on and I'll see?
- I sure will. Thank you very much.

392
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,558
- Mr. Bernstein?
- Yes, ma'am?

393
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,560
- I was wrong.
- I beg your pardon?

394
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:42,361
The truth is, I don't have a card
that says Mr. Hunt took any material.

395
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,652
- Uh-huh.
- I don't remember getting material for...

396
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:48,947
I do remember getting material
for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt.

397
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,588
Right.

398
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:55,534
The truth is, I didn't have any requests
at all from Mr. Hunt.

399
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,243
- Oh.
- Uh...

400
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:01,769
The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt.

401
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,768
Uh....

402
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,465
Uh, I was just wondering if any...
If you have any...

403
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,685
Hello?

404
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,225
Yes, we're checking
into that information now.

405
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:20,145
We'd just like to find out
just what it was that Hunt did...

406
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:23,690
...when he worked as a White House
consultant on the Pentagon Papers.

407
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,651
Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could.
Yes, sir.

408
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:27,861
Thank you.

409
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:32,375
Just got off the phone with the librarian.
You wanna look at the notes on it?

410
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,245
Oh, this is some stuff
from the Eisenhower campaign in 1952...

411
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:40,015
...that Hunt was connected with.

412
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:44,085
Did you call the White House
Communications Office?

413
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:46,866
No, I just got off the phone
with the librarian.

414
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:50,987
- 524-743.
- I know the number.

415
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:54,846
Between the first and second quote,
there's a contradiction.

416
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,723
It's a space of about five seconds.

417
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:58,266
- My feeling is...
- Was this all...?

418
00:26:58,267 --> 00:26:59,475
Mr. Clawson's office.

419
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:02,520
This is Bob Woodward of the Post.
Could I talk to Mr. Clawson?

420
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,239
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.

421
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,775
- When she came back on the phone...
- Ken Clawson.

422
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,652
Mr. Clawson,
this is Bob Woodward.

423
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:12,614
Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post
had a conversation...

424
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:15,950
...with a White House librarian
on books Mr. Howard Hunt took out...

425
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,660
...on Senator Edward Kennedy.

426
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:21,164
She first said that Howard Hunt
had taken out books on Senator Kennedy.

427
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:23,333
Then she denied even knowing
who he was.

428
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,877
I was wondering if you'd like to comment
on this confusion.

429
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,755
Mm. Listen, let me call you back
on this matter.

430
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:32,050
- I'm gonna check on it for you.
- Fine, thank you. Bye.

431
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,301
- All there?
- This...? Yes.

432
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:36,554
- This was all one conversation?
- Yeah. She says first of all:

433
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,640
"I think I got a bunch of books on Hunt."

434
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:41,309
Five seconds later, she says,
"I don't know Mr. Hunt."

435
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,853
- It's obvious someone got to her.
- Not enough proof.

436
00:27:43,854 --> 00:27:47,148
If there was a piece of paper
that said Hunt was taking out books...

437
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:49,984
...on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick,
like a library slip...

438
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:52,487
Hunt took out books
from the Library of Congress...

439
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:55,198
...but what's more important
is somebody got to her in...

440
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:57,492
- How do you know?
- Because she said...

441
00:27:57,493 --> 00:27:59,465
There was a lot of books
Hunt checked out.

442
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,205
- Then doesn't even know him.
- Woodward.

443
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:05,333
Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back.

444
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:08,127
- I've just talked with the librarian.
- Yes, sir.

445
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:12,340
She denies that the conversation
with Mr. Bernstein ever took place.

446
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:15,218
- She said she referred him to the...
- Excuse me, sir, sorry.

447
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:18,763
You say she denies even knowing
about the conversation taking place?

448
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,181
- That's right.
- Seven.

449
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:23,851
She said someone did call her
asking about Mr. Hunt...

450
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:26,729
...but all she did was refer him
to the Press Office.

451
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,400
- She denies other conversation took place.
- Total bullshit.

452
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,777
Uh, I hope that's been
of some help to you.

453
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,778
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

454
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:42,042
- We've gotta get something on paper.
- Library of Congress.

455
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:45,164
Mona? Excuse me, Mona.

456
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:47,542
- Could you take any calls for me, please?
- Sure.

457
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:49,460
Here's my note.

458
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,463
If I get any calls....

459
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:56,156
- Will you be back?
- I don't know when.

460
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:13,067
You want all the material requested
by the White House?

461
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:17,030
All White House transactions
are confidential.

462
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:19,543
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

463
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:28,916
- We need a sympathetic face.
- We're not gonna find one here.

464
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,753
You want every request since when?

465
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:33,755
- Uh, when did he start?
- July of '71.

466
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:36,781
I imagine the whole last year.

467
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,062
I'm not sure you want them,
but I got them.

468
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:39,529
- Maybe they pulled the cards.
- Maybe they changed the names.

469
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,842
There might have been a card there
and we missed it.

470
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:45,701
Hey, wait a minute.

471
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:48,454
I met a White House aide once
at a social occasion.

472
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:52,507
- So?
- He might confirm.

473
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,002
Do we need "W.H."
and "White House"...?

474
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,838
Not in the second paragraph.

475
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,675
Just "White House" would be enough.
Just use "White House." Forget "W.H."

476
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,844
I wanna know about Colson.
What was his job?

477
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:07,204
- Special consultant to the president.
- I gotta say it.

478
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,404
These notes on the White House librarian,
are they accurate?

479
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,689
- The notes, are they accurate?
- Give me a second.

480
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,982
- Yes.
- I want a new page.

481
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:20,701
Okay, look, I'll have a reporter
out to talk to you this afternoon.

482
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:26,993
Let's take it in
and show it to Howie Simons.

483
00:31:26,994 --> 00:31:29,495
We've gotta start moving
on this now. Come on, now.

484
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:31,372
Hey, Mr. Bradlee.

485
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:35,886
Get the artwork
on that Grant Porter piece.

486
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:40,423
- Okay, let's have it. Mm-hm.
- Yeah, here you are, Ben.

487
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,050
It's a good, solid piece
of American journalism...

488
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:46,334
...that the New York Times doesn't have.

489
00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:13,539
You haven't got it. A librarian and
a secretary saying Hunt looked at a book.

490
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,749
Not good enough.

491
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,752
A White House aide told me
Hunt was investigating Kennedy.

492
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:19,795
Who was it?

493
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:22,215
Who was it?
You want the name, you mean?

494
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:26,831
- No, how senior, how high up?
- I don't know titles.

495
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:41,317
"Showed a special interest in...."

496
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,778
We said the White House
was investigating Kennedy.

497
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:46,948
- "Showed a special interest in."
- The story's stronger than that.

498
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:49,992
The White House librarian says
Hunt checked out a lot of books.

499
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:53,246
- A secretary in Colson's office said Hunt...
- All right, Carl. Carl.

500
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:56,529
Ben, that's a Page 1 story.

501
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,339
Stick it inside someplace.

502
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,888
This is a goddamn important story. It....

503
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:11,380
Get some harder information next time.

504
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:18,729
Asshole. Bradlee's just sticking up
for the Kennedys.

505
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,773
- We didn't have it.
- Bullshit. We had it.

506
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:22,817
- We didn't.
- Why didn't you say something?

507
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:26,781
You think bitching about it
is gonna get the story where we want it?

508
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:29,983
Throw it in the can.

509
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:03,577
- Yes?
- This is Woodward.

510
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:06,694
I wanna talk about Watergate.

511
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:11,157
- I know that the atmos...
- We're not going to talk about that subject.

512
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:15,703
- Well, we talked about Wallace.
- But this is different.

513
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:19,915
That was about the shooting
of a man running for president.

514
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:22,835
- This is different.
- How?

515
00:34:22,836 --> 00:34:26,477
Not about this story. Don't call me again.

516
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:33,638
The stewardess hostages were released.

517
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,556
The passengers, numbering 113...

518
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,516
...were released in Philadelphia.

519
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:41,562
Things are warming up in Reykjavik, where
Bobby Fischer forfeited the second game...

520
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:45,733
...of that $250,000
world-championship chess match...

521
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,860
...with the Russian champion
Boris Spassky.

522
00:34:47,861 --> 00:34:49,070
He didn't show up.

523
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:51,781
Fischer lost the opening match
to Spassky last night...

524
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:54,492
...after walking out during the match
for 30 minutes...

525
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:57,912
...to protest the directions and distractions
of television cameras...

526
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,538
...which were later withdrawn.

527
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:02,124
On Wall Street,
prices took a pounding yesterday...

528
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,753
...with the Dow Jones closing down
6-and-three-quarter points.

529
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:08,589
The dollar took a beating
on the European money market...

530
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,385
...dropping to its lower....

531
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:54,146
Taxi. Taxi.

532
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:09,443
Taxi. Taxi.

533
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:22,944
Taxi.

534
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:01,679
- Where are you?
- Stuck.

535
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,860
The story has stalled on us.

536
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,556
And you thought I'd help?

537
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:14,244
I'll never quote you.

538
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,987
I wouldn't quote you
even as an anonymous source.

539
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:21,577
I mean, you'd be on deep background.

540
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:25,845
You can trust me. You know that.

541
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,084
Go on.

542
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:38,095
- Can you tell me what you know?
- You tell me what you know.

543
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:45,175
Hunt worked for Colson
at the White House.

544
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:48,392
Hunt was investigating Kennedy
at Chappaquiddick.

545
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:53,193
That should tell you a lot. What else?

546
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:57,735
We're beginning to hear a lot about a lawyer
at CREEP named Gordon Liddy who's...

547
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,793
Gordon Liddy...

548
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:19,173
...was fired by Mitchell
because he wouldn't talk to the FBI.

549
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:22,866
- You'll hear more.
- Will he talk?

550
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:28,849
I was at a party once...

551
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:33,650
...and Liddy put his hand over a candle,
and he kept it there.

552
00:39:34,147 --> 00:39:38,947
He kept it right in the flame
until his flesh was burned.

553
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:44,494
Somebody said, "What's the trick?"
And Liddy said, "The trick is not minding."

554
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:50,920
The story is dry.

555
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:54,041
All we've got are pieces.

556
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:58,045
We can't seem to figure out
what the puzzle is supposed to look like.

557
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,714
John Mitchell resigns
as the head of CREEP...

558
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:03,425
...and says he wants
to spend more time with his family.

559
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:06,220
That sounds like bullshit.
We don't exactly believe that.

560
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:09,401
No, but it's touching.

561
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:16,109
Forget the myths that the media has created
about the White House.

562
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:18,983
The truth is,
these are not very bright guys...

563
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,547
...and things got out of hand.

564
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:25,447
Hunt's come in from the cold.

565
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:30,035
Supposedly, he's got a lawyer
with $25,000 in a brown paper bag.

566
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,343
Follow the money.

567
00:40:34,124 --> 00:40:36,123
What do you mean?

568
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:39,241
- Where?
- Oh, I can't tell you that.

569
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:41,587
But you could tell me, then.

570
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:44,883
No, I have to do this my way.

571
00:40:44,884 --> 00:40:48,554
You tell me what you know,
and I'll confirm.

572
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:53,355
I'll keep you in the right direction if I can,
but that's all.

573
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:59,504
Just follow the money.

574
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:12,835
- Goddamn New York Times.
- What is it?

575
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:18,088
Phone calls from the burglars
in Miami to the Committee to Reelect.

576
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,296
Fifteen phone calls.

577
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:25,174
At least 15 phone calls,
and those phone calls were made...

578
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:28,135
...as early as March 15th,
three months before the break-in.

579
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:31,972
"Eighty-nine thousand dollars issued in
the name of a prominent Mexican lawyer."

580
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:34,933
Eighty-nine thousand dollars
in Mexican checks?

581
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,345
Why didn't we get this?

582
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,021
Who are their sources?

583
00:41:39,022 --> 00:41:42,561
I even know someone
who works on the phone company.

584
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:45,486
Carl, if John Mitchell
wanted your phone records...

585
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:47,613
...you'd be yelling invasion of privacy.

586
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:49,656
Was the New York Times article accurate?

587
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:52,326
- Yeah, but I can't get you a fuller listing.
- Why?

588
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,787
They've subpoenaed
all of Barker's phone records.

589
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:59,588
I think they're trying to find out if the
Watergate burglars broke any Florida law.

590
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,586
- Who subpoenaed them?
- Miami DA.

591
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:04,755
- What's his name?
- I don't know his name.

592
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:07,674
But the guy who's heading the investigation
is named Dardis.

593
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:10,260
Dardis. What's his first name?

594
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,264
I don't know his first name.
I guess you'll have to find that out.

595
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:22,231
- Hi.
- Hello.

596
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:24,525
I have a 9:15 appointment
with Mr. Dardis.

597
00:42:24,526 --> 00:42:28,403
Mr. Bernstein, I'm afraid that Mr. Dardis
won't be able to see you this morning.

598
00:42:28,404 --> 00:42:31,073
- His calendar is quite full.
- There must be a mistake.

599
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:33,200
I made the appointment
with him personally.

600
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,536
The appointment should've been made
through me.

601
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:37,746
I'll see if I can squeeze you in later.

602
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:40,260
Oh, thanks very much.

603
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:45,170
I guess it's difficult
when he makes his own appointments.

604
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:48,710
Yes, well, we try to handle it.

605
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,560
It's 4:00. We'll be back
in 15 minutes. Do you want anything?

606
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:03,150
- Coffee, black.
- Coffee, black.

607
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,902
I'm still here.

608
00:43:08,903 --> 00:43:10,612
Ha, ha. I'm so glad.

609
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:13,490
If you could get me in for five minutes,
I'd appreciate it.

610
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:16,535
- Mr. Bernstein.
- I have to get back.

611
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:19,099
We're going to try.

612
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:24,159
Oh, hi. He's expecting you.

613
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,424
I do have a couple things to do.

614
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:33,177
I'll be at the Sheraton
if you wanna reach me.

615
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:36,430
If he has space tomorrow, I'd appreciate it.
Number's on the back.

616
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:38,432
- Fine.
- I thank you for your patience.

617
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:42,644
Mm-hm. Thank you, Mr. Bernstein.
Tomorrow it should be better.

618
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:45,106
I guess so.

619
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,818
Mr. Dardis' office.

620
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:53,572
Hi. Please tell Mr. Dardis
that Mr. Bernstein has just left.

621
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:55,908
He'll be available all day tomorrow.

622
00:43:55,909 --> 00:43:58,869
I think we can probably squeeze him in
around 4:30.

623
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,078
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

624
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,041
And please tell Mr. Dardis he doesn't want
to be late for his 6:30 appointment.

625
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,118
- Yes, I will.
- Mm-hm. Thank you.

626
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,929
- Mr. Dardis' office.
- Mr. Martinson at the county clerk's.

627
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,431
- Beg your pardon?
- Martinson at the county clerk's.

628
00:44:19,432 --> 00:44:23,477
There's some records that Dardis wanted.
Could you come get them? We're closing.

629
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:26,554
Uh, well, yes, I'll be right over.

630
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:33,527
Excuse me.

631
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,673
Would be easier too, wouldn't it?

632
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:55,801
All right. Hold it. What?

633
00:44:55,802 --> 00:44:57,803
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you in some way?

634
00:44:57,804 --> 00:44:59,972
I'm Carl Bernstein. I've been here since 9.

635
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:02,557
- Wait outside.
- I've been waiting since this morning.

636
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:05,060
- Finish your call.
- Wait outside, please, will you?

637
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:07,354
No, no, no.
I'm the reporter from the Post.

638
00:45:07,355 --> 00:45:09,064
We talked on the phone yesterday.

639
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:12,192
- You told me to come here, and I'm here.
- Okay, yeah, look...

640
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:14,987
I've got the press here.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

641
00:45:14,988 --> 00:45:18,073
If you didn't wanna see me,
I don't know why you didn't tell me.

642
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:21,118
I wasted a whole day here,
and my paper's waiting for a story.

643
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,829
You tell me to come,
you said I got a 9:30 appointment.

644
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,291
- I've been waiting the whole day.
- Caught me on the worst day possible.

645
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,876
The man I work for
has started a reelection campaign.

646
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:32,212
We're gonna have to
see each other tomorrow.

647
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:35,048
No, I'm facing a deadline.
My paper's saving space for me.

648
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:38,510
- I just don't have a minute now.
- Well, I'm sorry, but...

649
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:41,471
Uh, Mr. Dardis, I'm really
very sorry about this. Mr. Bernstein...

650
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,975
I beg your pardon, but this gentleman
made the appointment with me...

651
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:47,728
...and the Washington Post
deserves the same courtesy...

652
00:45:47,729 --> 00:45:49,479
...as any of the people waiting.

653
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,070
I'll buzz you in about five minutes.

654
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:56,786
The lady takes good care of me.

655
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:59,948
The fact is we just can't go into it
this evening.

656
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:02,034
It's gonna have to wait until tomorrow.

657
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:04,202
I wish you could've told me
before I left...

658
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:09,003
...because I gotta go back to my paper now
and write that story one way or another.

659
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:15,756
You wanna see Mr. Barker's phone records
and his money records?

660
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:18,425
You told me you'd show me
everything you got on Barker.

661
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:19,676
That's all I want.

662
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:23,055
- Well, that's what I've got.
- Well, that's fine.

663
00:46:23,056 --> 00:46:25,182
You and I have to have an agreement...

664
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:29,061
...that you're not gonna reveal the source
of your information.

665
00:46:29,062 --> 00:46:33,440
All these are cashier's checks
on a bank in Mexico City.

666
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:35,442
- All these checks from Mexico?
- You see?

667
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:37,569
How come?
Did the money originate there?

668
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,946
Well, I doubt it started off as pesos.

669
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:41,656
Uh....

670
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:45,035
- Well, wait a minute, what's this one?
- Uh, what's...? Okay, $25,000.

671
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:47,954
- Who's that? Who is that? Dahl...?
- Kenneth H. Dahlberg.

672
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:50,207
We haven't been able to ascertain
who that is.

673
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,626
Bob, I've got something.
I don't know what it is.

674
00:46:52,627 --> 00:46:54,795
Somewhere,
there is a Kenneth H. Dahlberg.

675
00:46:54,796 --> 00:46:57,339
We gotta get to him
before the New York Times does.

676
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,759
I think they have the same information.
Got a pencil? Write this down.

677
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,560
Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
D-A-H-L-B-E-R-G, Dahlberg.

678
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:09,226
McGovern, who at first
voiced complete support for Eagleton...

679
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:13,063
...has more recently expressed doubts
and said Eagleton must make a decision...

680
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,315
...whether to stay or leave the ticket.

681
00:47:15,316 --> 00:47:17,025
More with Jean Westwood....

682
00:47:17,026 --> 00:47:20,112
You're the one that wanted
the articles on Kenneth H. Dahlberg?

683
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:22,823
- Yeah.
- Couldn't find anything in the clip file at all.

684
00:47:22,824 --> 00:47:24,825
- Oh, wonderful.
- Um....

685
00:47:24,826 --> 00:47:29,391
I did find one picture though,
if it's any help.

686
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,260
- Thanks.
- Mm.

687
00:47:37,296 --> 00:47:39,131
Minnesota.

688
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:41,299
...supported Senator Eagleman.

689
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,845
He is an able United States senator....

690
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:46,179
Minneapolis, Minneapolis.

691
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,392
...will make him a prominent figure
in American politics...

692
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:53,213
...for many, many years.

693
00:48:02,196 --> 00:48:06,996
I base that conclusion
upon my conversations with his doctors...

694
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:11,580
...and my close personal
and political association with him.

695
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:13,874
- Outside line, please.
- Yes.

696
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,750
- Thank you.
- In the joint decision...

697
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:20,380
...that we have reached tonight,
health was not a factor.

698
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:25,181
But the public debate over
Senator Eagleman's past medical history...

699
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:30,599
...continues to divert attention
from the great national issues...

700
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,143
...that need to be discussed.

701
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:37,944
I have referred to the growing pressures
to ask for Senator Eagleton's withdrawal.

702
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:42,694
- We have also seen....
- Hello?

703
00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:44,696
- Could I please...? Mr. Dahlberg?
- Yes?

704
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:47,449
- Kenneth Dahlberg?
- Yes?

705
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,502
This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.

706
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:53,914
- Yes?
- About that $25,000 check...

707
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:57,250
...deposited in the bank account
of one of the Watergate burglars...

708
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:59,610
...Mr. Bernard Barker.

709
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:05,258
As you know, sir,
the check has your name on it.

710
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:06,885
We were doing a story on this...

711
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:10,055
...and I was wondering if you would care
to comment or explain.

712
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:13,767
Uh, I turn all my money over
to the committee.

713
00:49:13,768 --> 00:49:16,520
What committee is that, sir?
The Committee to Reelect?

714
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:19,731
- Yes, yes.
- And why would you do that?

715
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:22,067
- That's it, he's done.
- I raise a lot of money.

716
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:25,487
I'm Midwest Finance chairman.

717
00:49:25,488 --> 00:49:28,308
For the Committee to Reelect?

718
00:49:28,407 --> 00:49:31,076
- Hello?
- Yes, that's right.

719
00:49:31,077 --> 00:49:35,121
How do you think your check got into
the bank account of the Watergate burglar?

720
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:39,922
I'm a proper citizen. What I do is proper.

721
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:44,548
- Oh, I understand.
- I've just been through a terrible ordeal.

722
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:47,759
- My neighbor's wife has been kidnapped.
- Oh.

723
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,126
Well, how do you think your check
got into Barker's account, though...?

724
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:26,881
Committee to Reelect the President.

725
00:50:26,882 --> 00:50:28,466
Could I speak to Clark MacGregor?

726
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:31,661
- One moment, I'll connect you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

727
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,014
MacGREGOR: Yes?
- Mr. MacGregor?

728
00:50:34,015 --> 00:50:38,143
- Yes.
- Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.

729
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:39,352
- Hello?
- Yes?

730
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:41,646
Uh, this is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.

731
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:42,856
Mm-hm.

732
00:50:42,857 --> 00:50:46,443
I just spoke to a Kenneth Dahlberg,
who says he is Midwest Finance chairman.

733
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,737
Yeah, I know Ken Dahlberg.

734
00:50:48,738 --> 00:50:50,905
Well, I can't seem to get an explanation...

735
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:53,908
...on why a check for $25,000
made out to Mr. Dahlberg...

736
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:56,202
...that he sent
to the Committee to Reelect...

737
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:58,872
...would end up in the account
of a Watergate burglar.

738
00:50:58,873 --> 00:51:00,332
I don't know.

739
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:03,043
- But you're head of the committee.
- I just came aboard.

740
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:05,712
John Mitchell was head of the committee.
He might know.

741
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:08,381
- What would the explanation possibly...?
- I don't know.

742
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:10,216
You're implying that I should know.

743
00:51:10,217 --> 00:51:14,372
If you print that,
our relationship will be terminated.

744
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,181
We don't have a relationship.

745
00:51:16,182 --> 00:51:19,184
The issues of the campaign
are peace and prosperity...

746
00:51:19,185 --> 00:51:21,353
...not a campaign check.

747
00:51:21,354 --> 00:51:22,854
- Bob.
- Sir, no one is saying...

748
00:51:22,855 --> 00:51:24,898
- Bob.
- This happened before I came aboard.

749
00:51:24,899 --> 00:51:28,234
- Mr. Dahlberg is on Line 2.
- I'm running a campaign.

750
00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:32,447
We've raised $60 million,
and you're asking about a $25,000 check.

751
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:35,408
Mr. MacGregor, excuse me,
could you hold one second, please?

752
00:51:35,409 --> 00:51:36,910
- All right.
- Thank you. Yes?

753
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:38,662
- Hello?
- Mr. Dahlberg?

754
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,914
- Yes.
- Could you please hold one second, sir?

755
00:51:40,915 --> 00:51:42,582
- Yes.
- Thank you. Mr. MacGregor?

756
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:44,292
MacGREGOR: Yeah?
- Can I call you right back?

757
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:46,753
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you. Mr. Dahlberg.

758
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:50,131
Yes. Uh, I'm sorry I hung up before.

759
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:53,176
I wasn't sure you were
a Washington Post reporter.

760
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:56,846
I believe we were talking
about a $25,000 check.

761
00:51:56,847 --> 00:52:01,017
Um.... Obviously, this is difficult for me.

762
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:04,604
Uh, I'm caught
in the middle of something...

763
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:06,606
...and I don't know what.

764
00:52:06,607 --> 00:52:09,567
- I don't...
- What do you think it could be?

765
00:52:09,568 --> 00:52:13,780
- Well, I deal with a lot of important people.
- People who work for the committee?

766
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:15,448
- Hello?
- For the committee.

767
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:18,326
- The Committee to Reelect the President?
- Yes.

768
00:52:18,327 --> 00:52:20,829
You see, I raised that money in cash...

769
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,623
...and I have a winter home in Florida.

770
00:52:23,624 --> 00:52:26,793
- Is that in Miami?
- Boca Raton.

771
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:29,796
And I didn't want to carry
all that cash around.

772
00:52:29,797 --> 00:52:32,465
- Now, you can understand that.
- Oh, of course I can.

773
00:52:32,466 --> 00:52:35,301
So I had it exchanged
for the cashier's check.

774
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:38,722
And how do you think
it got into Barker's account?

775
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:40,466
Uh....

776
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:44,988
I know I shouldn't be telling you this.
Uh....

777
00:52:45,855 --> 00:52:50,214
I gave it to Mr. Stans.

778
00:52:51,986 --> 00:52:53,903
I beg your pardon?

779
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:57,657
- I gave it to Stans.
- Maurice Stans?

780
00:52:57,658 --> 00:53:01,119
- The head of Finance for Nixon?
- Yes, in Washington.

781
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,457
Now, what he did with it,
I really do not know.

782
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:09,294
I see. Were there any other checks
that you might be aware of, that could've...?

783
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:12,380
That's all I have to say.

784
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:17,181
Mr. MacGregor... Mr. Dahlberg, I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.

785
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:35,195
Metro Desk. Yeah, he's here, hold on.

786
00:53:35,196 --> 00:53:36,362
- Bob.
- Yeah?

787
00:53:36,363 --> 00:53:38,531
Carl Bernstein on Line 1.

788
00:53:38,532 --> 00:53:40,283
- One?
- Yeah.

789
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:43,161
- Yeah?
- Woodward? I got a lead on Dahlberg.

790
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:45,038
- I just... I got it.
- What?

791
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,333
I just talked to him. I just hung up.
It goes all the way to Stans.

792
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:50,210
- What?
- It goes all the way to Stans.

793
00:53:50,211 --> 00:53:52,921
He gave the check to Stans
for the Committee to Reelect.

794
00:53:52,922 --> 00:53:55,882
- Did he say that?
- He said it. I've got it in my notes.

795
00:53:55,883 --> 00:53:57,884
- Jesus.
- It's down on record, Bernstein.

796
00:53:57,885 --> 00:54:00,261
That money winds up
in the account of a burglar?

797
00:54:00,262 --> 00:54:02,764
- Yes. Ha-ha-ha.
- Fantastic. I'm coming home.

798
00:54:02,765 --> 00:54:04,560
Okay.

799
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,812
...catapulted the unknown senator
from Missouri into national prominence...

800
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:13,613
...by naming Eagleton as his running mate.
The move surprised the old pros...

801
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:17,570
...but it paid off in support
for the Democratic ticket.

802
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:20,615
What happened with that
Taiwan thing you were telling us about?

803
00:54:20,616 --> 00:54:24,744
Japan is going to break diplomatic ties
with Taiwan and recognize they're China.

804
00:54:24,745 --> 00:54:28,248
The irony, of course, that's a direct result
of Nixon's visit to China.

805
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:30,083
What did he say to him?

806
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:32,126
That's a great parallel story...

807
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:34,796
...if you're going to
do that piece on dГ©tente.

808
00:54:34,797 --> 00:54:39,342
Uh.... "Queen Elizabeth proclaims a state
of emergency to deal with the dock strike."

809
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:40,969
Bringing it off his boat.

810
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,597
That could be a human-interest.

811
00:54:44,598 --> 00:54:46,808
Thirty-one days of rain
in the Philippines...

812
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:49,269
...being blamed on the theft
of a statue of Jesus.

813
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:51,896
- We had one like that before.
- Front-page article.

814
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:54,357
- Absolutely not.
- I'll put my best writer on that.

815
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:55,775
What about
the one in India months ago?

816
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:56,943
Drop that.

817
00:54:56,944 --> 00:54:59,779
Laugh, gentlemen.
It'll be the only story everyone reads.

818
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,614
Okay. National?

819
00:55:01,615 --> 00:55:04,242
We have the Bremer diary,
wished to kill Nixon.

820
00:55:04,243 --> 00:55:07,495
He took a car trip to New York,
Ottawa and Washington to kill him.

821
00:55:07,496 --> 00:55:08,788
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

822
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:11,749
We have the Senate
approving the ABM Treaty.

823
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,126
- Yeah, that's mine.
- ABM.

824
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:17,927
And, of course, we have McGovern
offering the VP spot to everybody.

825
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,507
- Yeah, that's news.
- I have...

826
00:55:19,508 --> 00:55:22,427
Everybody's been offered it.
I'll tell you what'll be news.

827
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:24,400
When somebody accepts it.
That'll be news.

828
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:26,931
- Yeah.
- Here is some great art.

829
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:28,141
Yeah, big mistake.

830
00:55:28,142 --> 00:55:31,978
McGovern and Humphrey, breakfast,
smiling their asses off.

831
00:55:31,979 --> 00:55:34,147
- IsnвЂ™t that great?
- Oh, look at that.

832
00:55:34,148 --> 00:55:36,482
Humphrey said, "I am George's friend."

833
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:38,192
Why is that man smiling?

834
00:55:38,193 --> 00:55:40,278
- "I am his friend."
- Sounds friendly, huh?

835
00:55:40,279 --> 00:55:42,989
"I'll be helping him in ways
he never dreamed possible."

836
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,950
Breakfast followed by lunch.

837
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:48,494
- Got a good picture?
- Okay. Metro?

838
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:50,997
Well, we got the schoolteachers
on Capitol Hill.

839
00:55:50,998 --> 00:55:55,376
They want a 17% increase in pay,
or this fall they go on strike.

840
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:58,630
Harry, I think we could mention
that this might be the time...

841
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:01,591
...to go to the front page
on the District Home Rule.

842
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,051
- Oh, come on.
- Listen to him.

843
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:06,512
Ben, this time it could go all the way.

844
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:09,432
The House is gonna vote next week
on a Senate resolution.

845
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,476
When they pass it, we'll run with it.

846
00:56:11,477 --> 00:56:14,187
Okay, fellas, let's go around again now.
Foreign?

847
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:17,774
- Uh, Taiwan emergency, Philippines.
- Okay, fine. National?

848
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:21,194
The Eagleton follow-ups, McGovern
not being able to get a replacement.

849
00:56:21,195 --> 00:56:23,613
He's offered it to Humphrey,
Kennedy and Ribicoff.

850
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:25,782
All turned him down.
That's the Page 1 lead.

851
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:28,743
You're ignoring the importance
of the Dahlberg repercussions.

852
00:56:28,744 --> 00:56:31,037
Nobody cares
about the Dahlberg repercussions.

853
00:56:31,038 --> 00:56:35,708
Our story got the General Accounting Office
to start an audit with CREEP Finance.

854
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:39,504
Yeah, we printed that, didn't we?
When the audit's done, we'll print that too.

855
00:56:39,505 --> 00:56:41,381
Let me tell you what happened today.

856
00:56:41,382 --> 00:56:43,466
I was having lunch
at the Sans Souci and...

857
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,594
- Aww....
- How much this time?

858
00:56:46,595 --> 00:56:49,514
This White House guy, a good one, a pro,
came up and asked:

859
00:56:49,515 --> 00:56:51,933
"What is this Watergate compulsion
with you guys?"

860
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,142
Compulsion?

861
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,645
- I said...
- This is a story. This is not compulsion.

862
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:58,231
I said, "Well, we think it's important,"
and he said:

863
00:56:58,232 --> 00:56:59,941
"If it's so goddamn important...

864
00:56:59,942 --> 00:57:02,235
...who in the hell are Woodward
and Bernstein?"

865
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:05,780
What do you expect from the White House?
"You're doing a great job"?

866
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:08,282
Now, why don't you ask him
what he's really saying?

867
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:10,743
He wants to take the story away
from Woodstein...

868
00:57:10,744 --> 00:57:12,370
...and give it to National Desk.

869
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:14,414
I have experienced guys sitting around...

870
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:16,749
...who know the politicians,
have the contacts.

871
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,252
- We're aware of that.
- You said it. Sitting around.

872
00:57:19,253 --> 00:57:23,965
Ben. It's a dangerous story for this paper.

873
00:57:23,966 --> 00:57:27,510
- What if your boys get it wrong?
- Then it's our ass, isn't it?

874
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:30,722
We all have to go out and work for a living.

875
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:34,767
National gets eight columns.
Nine for Foreign.

876
00:57:34,768 --> 00:57:37,603
Metro, 15.

877
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:40,148
- That's it, fellas.
- Okay.

878
00:57:40,149 --> 00:57:42,353
Could've been worse.

879
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:46,931
Hey, Scott, I need to see you.

880
00:57:47,906 --> 00:57:49,115
How dangerous?

881
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,957
Well, it's not just that we're using
unnamed sources that bothers me...

882
00:57:57,958 --> 00:58:01,270
...or that everything we print,
the White House denies...

883
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:05,506
...or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff.

884
00:58:05,507 --> 00:58:07,133
What, then?

885
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:09,635
Look, there are over 2000 reporters
in this town...

886
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:12,513
...and there are five on Watergate?

887
00:58:12,514 --> 00:58:17,284
Where did the Washington Post
suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom?

888
00:58:17,352 --> 00:58:19,506
Why would the Republicans do it?

889
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:21,647
McGovern is self-destructing...

890
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:25,136
...just like Humphrey, Muskie,
the bunch of them.

891
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:29,256
I don't believe the story.

892
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:32,165
Doesn't make sense.

893
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:35,661
Yeah, Bernstein.

894
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:37,663
Now? All right.

895
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:41,084
Woodward, Bradlee will see us now.
Answer the phone for me.

896
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:44,504
Are you trying to find
the lowest possible common denominator?

897
00:58:44,505 --> 00:58:47,298
Is that your plan in the convention?

898
00:58:47,299 --> 00:58:49,342
Gonna give us something to do?

899
00:58:49,343 --> 00:58:54,143
- Bob, Frances is on the phone.
- Tell her I'll call her back.

900
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:57,278
All right, in this....

901
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:03,819
We have reports that Republican
Les Aspin has informed the secretary of....

902
00:59:04,024 --> 00:59:05,483
Ben, it's the hottest item.

903
00:59:05,484 --> 00:59:07,360
- It's in over 500 papers.
- What is it?

904
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:10,863
Yesterday's weather report for
people who were drunk and slept all day.

905
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:13,533
Send it to the San Francisco Chronicle.
They need it.

906
00:59:13,534 --> 00:59:15,368
- How about the crossword puzzle?
- No.

907
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:18,871
- Anagrams?
- No space. No space, Mickey.

908
00:59:18,872 --> 00:59:21,958
You guys, last thing you
bought from me was the obituaries.

909
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:25,586
- Make them buy something, will you?
- All right. Hey, what do you guys want?

910
00:59:25,587 --> 00:59:28,714
The GAO reports are due out
the morning of Nixon's renomination.

911
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:30,550
Hey, sit down, sit down.

912
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:33,386
Well, that's two weeks from now.

913
00:59:33,387 --> 00:59:35,638
Since they're only responsible
to Congress...

914
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,391
...no way the White House
can control the investigation.

915
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:40,518
A source at General Accounting tells us...

916
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:44,230
...there's a whole rat's nest
of illegal shit going on over at CREEP.

917
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:46,107
- Like what?
- Like a slush fund.

918
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:48,901
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
of unaccounted-for cash.

919
00:59:48,902 --> 00:59:50,611
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?

920
00:59:50,612 --> 00:59:53,364
- Any comment from CREEP?
- Yes, unavailable for comment.

921
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:54,574
They're not talking.

922
00:59:54,575 --> 00:59:58,780
What else besides the money?
Where's the goddamn story?

923
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:02,498
- The money's the key to whatever this is.
- Says who?

924
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:03,749
- Deep Throat.
- Who?

925
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,336
Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak,
his source in the executive.

926
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,546
Garage freak?

927
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:11,674
Jesus, what kind
of a crazy fucking story is this?

928
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:12,957
Who did you say?

929
01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:20,308
He's on deep background.
I call him Deep Throat.

930
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:24,103
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing,
Nixon's guaranteed the renomination...

931
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:26,439
...the Post is stuck
with a story no one wants.

932
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,525
It'll sink the goddamn paper.
Everyone says, "Get off it, Ben."

933
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:33,446
And I come on very sage and I say,
"You'll see. You wait till this bottoms out."

934
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:38,165
But the truth is,
I can't figure out what we've got.

935
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,120
What else are you working on?

936
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:43,289
Well, we're after a list
of CREEP employees.

937
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,666
- Where is it?
- It's classified.

938
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:49,295
- Well, how you gonna get it?
- We haven't had any luck yet.

939
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:51,141
Get some.

940
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:57,433
Anything else?

941
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:09,939
You made a mistake in there.

942
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:14,362
What?

943
01:01:14,363 --> 01:01:17,740
You said we haven't had any luck yet,
that's the thing he jumps on.

944
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:19,116
You can't talk about luck.

945
01:01:19,117 --> 01:01:22,656
If you can't talk in specifics,
you shouldn't say anything.

946
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:30,127
Is there any place you don't smoke?

947
01:01:32,881 --> 01:01:34,674
- What?
- Hold it. Hold it.

948
01:01:34,675 --> 01:01:36,968
- What are you doing?
- Kay Eddy.

949
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:40,263
Doesn't she go with a guy
that works for the Committee to Reelect?

950
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,847
- Meet me at 4.
- All right.

951
01:01:41,848 --> 01:01:43,474
- Eddy? Hey.
- Just a second.

952
01:01:43,475 --> 01:01:46,811
- Kay, can...?
- 757-6521.

953
01:01:46,812 --> 01:01:49,772
Okay, I'll get back to you on this.
Thanks.

954
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:54,184
Don't you go with a guy that works
for the Committee to Reelect?

955
01:01:54,236 --> 01:01:56,362
- Not anymore.
- You did go with him, though.

956
01:01:56,363 --> 01:01:59,156
- You were engaged to him, weren't you?
- Yeah.

957
01:01:59,157 --> 01:02:01,464
You got out of it?

958
01:02:01,702 --> 01:02:04,036
- So?
- You're looking better.

959
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,208
We need a list of the people
that work there.

960
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:10,876
Do you think that...?

961
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:13,963
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

962
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:15,214
That's personal.

963
01:02:15,215 --> 01:02:18,446
What do you mean? You said it was over.

964
01:02:20,554 --> 01:02:23,180
You're asking me
to use a guy I care about.

965
01:02:23,181 --> 01:02:26,017
No, no, we're not asking you
to use him, just to help us.

966
01:02:26,018 --> 01:02:28,561
- Well, sure you...
- I mean, we'd do the same for you.

967
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:30,896
My only chance of getting that
is if I see him.

968
01:02:30,897 --> 01:02:33,858
- I don't wanna see him again.
- Well, do you have to see him?

969
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:36,360
- Sure, I have to.
- Do you have to see him that way?

970
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:37,862
Can't you just call him up...

971
01:02:37,863 --> 01:02:40,906
...and say you wanna have a drink with him,
just feel him out?

972
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:45,342
You say the relationship is over.
I mean, what the hell do you have to lose?

973
01:02:45,454 --> 01:02:47,453
Forget it.

974
01:02:47,539 --> 01:02:49,749
Don't do anything
that would embarrass you...

975
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,724
...or that you don't feel right about.

976
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:55,002
Forget it.

977
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:57,434
Let's go.

978
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,265
Don't let her get off like that.
She was gonna say something.

979
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:07,600
You're overdramatizing.

980
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:10,144
- She was gonna give us what we wanted.
- It was over.

981
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:12,247
- What?
- It was over.

982
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:19,904
This looks like your story.
Why don't you take a look at it?

983
01:03:19,905 --> 01:03:22,417
I'm gonna check this out.

984
01:03:25,786 --> 01:03:29,478
You're gonna get fat
eating all those doughnuts.

985
01:03:56,483 --> 01:03:59,151
- Is this the whole list?
- Look what it says.

986
01:03:59,152 --> 01:04:03,255
"Personnel,
Committee to Reelect the President."

987
01:04:03,532 --> 01:04:04,740
This is alphabetical.

988
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:07,785
You can't tell who works for who.

989
01:04:07,786 --> 01:04:09,578
Mitchell, Magruder, Stans.

990
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,996
Here. John Mitchell.

991
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:12,331
- What's the number?
- 301.

992
01:04:12,332 --> 01:04:15,501
All right, find somebody
who has a number close to it.

993
01:04:15,502 --> 01:04:18,696
- They probably work for him. Okay.
- Here's a 303.

994
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:24,218
Okay, we have to find out how
the money got from Stans to the burglars.

995
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:27,012
Somebody who worked in Finance.

996
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:30,015
All right, here's the head of Finance.
Maurice Stans, 269.

997
01:04:30,016 --> 01:04:33,978
If we can just get somebody
who works under Stans.

998
01:04:33,979 --> 01:04:36,021
- Uh, Sloan? You need him?
- He's the treasurer.

999
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:38,107
- What's the number?
- It's Hugh Sloan, 287.

1000
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,158
Is there a secretary?

1001
01:04:41,153 --> 01:04:44,530
- Wait a minute. Manley, Manley, Manley.
- Here it is. Irene Manley?

1002
01:04:44,531 --> 01:04:48,242
- Yeah.
- 1406 Lee Jackson Memorial Highway.

1003
01:04:48,243 --> 01:04:50,369
- Hi, I'm Bob Woodward.
- I'm Carl Bernstein.

1004
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:53,497
We're from the Washington Post.
We'd like to speak to you.

1005
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:56,542
We understand your daughter works
for the Committee to Reelect.

1006
01:04:56,543 --> 01:04:59,670
- Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
- Would you object to just...?

1007
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:01,260
Forget it.

1008
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,174
Yes? Hi. CARL: Hi.

1009
01:05:03,175 --> 01:05:04,717
- Miss Milland? Betty Milland?
- Mm-hm.

1010
01:05:04,718 --> 01:05:06,677
- I'm Bob Woodward.
- Carl Bernstein.

1011
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:08,304
We're from the Washington Post.

1012
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:11,485
I know you're trying to do your job.
I mean....

1013
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,893
You don't understand
the pressure we're under.

1014
01:05:13,894 --> 01:05:17,062
- If we could come in for a couple seconds...
- No, I really don't...

1015
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:18,272
We don't wanna come in.

1016
01:05:18,273 --> 01:05:22,443
We understand there was some documents
that were shredded at the committee.

1017
01:05:22,444 --> 01:05:24,195
Well, there, uh....

1018
01:05:24,196 --> 01:05:26,655
There's often shredding.
I mean, we do that a lot.

1019
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,532
Were you there during the shredding?

1020
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:29,950
- Yes, I was.
- I see.

1021
01:05:29,951 --> 01:05:33,621
Were there any department heads
from the committee who were also present?

1022
01:05:33,622 --> 01:05:36,665
Uh, yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.

1023
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,875
- John Mitchell?
- Yes.

1024
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:39,251
- The attorney general?
- Uh-huh.

1025
01:05:39,252 --> 01:05:42,087
He was carrying a raincoat over his head.

1026
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:44,089
You know, because he was...
I thought he was gonna go:

1027
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:45,549
Woo-hoo. Woo-hoo.

1028
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:48,177
- But, uh, I...
- Did he supervise the shredding?

1029
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,429
Uh, I just...
Can I not answer any more questions?

1030
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,516
I'd just as soon not....
Okay? Maybe I could call you.

1031
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:56,901
- It's...
- Are you being told not to talk?

1032
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,689
- Will you call us?
- I don't know.

1033
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,024
I'll try.

1034
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:04,527
What about that shredding
right after the break-in?

1035
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:06,695
We need to know the papers
in the shredding.

1036
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:10,449
You have some idea what's in the papers
when the attorney general comes in...

1037
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:13,577
...it's at the committee,
and he's got a raincoat over his head.

1038
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:16,413
It could be raining.
Let me go through the story again.

1039
01:06:16,414 --> 01:06:18,832
You got a woman who's frightened.
Works for CREEP.

1040
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,961
She said there's shredding.
We don't know what's in the papers.

1041
01:06:21,962 --> 01:06:25,631
We know the former attorney general
comes in with an overcoat over his head.

1042
01:06:25,632 --> 01:06:29,385
Could be raining. There's a lawyer present.
We don't know what he asked them.

1043
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:31,387
Will you tell me where there's a story?

1044
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:34,557
In the fact that the interview
did not take place in her home...

1045
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:36,475
...but in the office of the committee.

1046
01:06:36,476 --> 01:06:40,312
- How is there a story in that?
- Because there's a lawyer in the office.

1047
01:06:40,313 --> 01:06:42,773
- You're more resistant than she is.
- That's right.

1048
01:06:42,774 --> 01:06:45,442
- Why?
- Because there's not enough fact.

1049
01:06:45,443 --> 01:06:49,819
Well, then let's just turn around
and go back and question her again.

1050
01:06:50,615 --> 01:06:53,659
- This won't take long at all. We just...
- Please go away, okay?

1051
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,579
Will you please leave
before they see you?

1052
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,707
- Who did you mean by...?
- What do you mean, "they"?

1053
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,458
Could you give us their names?

1054
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:05,879
We haven't revealed the sources
of the people that have talked to us.

1055
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,680
- I really can't talk about this because...
- Would they be members of the committee?

1056
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:15,180
Someone got to that woman.

1057
01:07:15,181 --> 01:07:16,974
It's the key to the whole cover-up.

1058
01:07:16,975 --> 01:07:20,185
How can you write there's a cover-up?
We don't know that there is.

1059
01:07:20,186 --> 01:07:24,986
Then I don't know what the hell you need.
So you tell me what you need.

1060
01:07:25,066 --> 01:07:28,360
I need more fact for a story,
and I think you should need the same.

1061
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:31,030
- If you get in a car and there's music...
- I'm in a car.

1062
01:07:31,031 --> 01:07:33,490
There's music playing in the car...
Hypothetically.

1063
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:36,535
There's music playing for 10 minutes
and there's no commercial.

1064
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:38,120
What can you deduce from that?

1065
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:39,455
- Is it AM or FM?
- Come on.

1066
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:40,706
Is it AM or FM?

1067
01:07:40,707 --> 01:07:44,918
A guy can come up to me on the street,
and he can ask me an address.

1068
01:07:44,919 --> 01:07:47,880
Now, is the man interrogating me,
or is he lost?

1069
01:07:47,881 --> 01:07:49,548
What kind of a story do I write?

1070
01:07:49,549 --> 01:07:51,759
What kind of a deduction
do I make from that?

1071
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,928
You don't have a gut feeling
that the woman is trying to help us?

1072
01:07:54,929 --> 01:07:58,160
I don't have enough gut feeling.
I wish I did.

1073
01:07:58,558 --> 01:08:01,635
We're from the Washington Post.

1074
01:08:02,312 --> 01:08:04,500
Ammons, Irene Ammons. Did we see her?

1075
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:10,031
Abbott, Addison, Augusto, Alberts.

1076
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:19,453
Is there something that strikes you
as odd about this?

1077
01:08:19,454 --> 01:08:21,372
- What?
- It's like there's a pattern...

1078
01:08:21,373 --> 01:08:24,667
...to the way they're not talking,
the way they say no all the time.

1079
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:26,154
I think it's odd.

1080
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:27,961
- Mrs. Hambling?
- Yes.

1081
01:08:27,962 --> 01:08:32,716
- Hi, we're from the Washington Post.
- I'm Carl Bernstein, this is Bob Woodward.

1082
01:08:32,717 --> 01:08:35,761
A friend of the committee
said that we could contact you.

1083
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:37,971
- Who was it?
- We can't reveal that.

1084
01:08:37,972 --> 01:08:40,432
You can talk to us.
We don't reveal our sources.

1085
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:42,935
You people.

1086
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:46,897
You think you can come into my home,
ask a few questions...

1087
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:51,698
...have me destroy the reputations
of men that I work for and respect?

1088
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:55,447
Do you understand loyalty?

1089
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:58,525
Have you ever heard of loyalty?

1090
01:08:58,576 --> 01:09:00,369
- Hi.
- Yes?

1091
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,121
- I'm Bob Woodward.
- Carl Bernstein.

1092
01:09:02,122 --> 01:09:04,707
- We're from the Washington Post.
- Yes.

1093
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:08,460
I've read what you've written.
I wanna thank you.

1094
01:09:08,461 --> 01:09:11,964
I've been a Republican all my life,
but this goes beyond party politics.

1095
01:09:11,965 --> 01:09:14,591
Would you mind
if we asked you a few questions?

1096
01:09:14,592 --> 01:09:17,259
No, no. Come in. Would you like coffee?

1097
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:19,680
Sure.

1098
01:09:19,681 --> 01:09:22,599
What they've done
is a threat to the Constitution.

1099
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,893
It goes against everything we stand for.

1100
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:28,063
Could you be a little bit more specific
than that?

1101
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:30,858
I'm afraid your articles
have just scratched the surface.

1102
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:33,652
You don't mind
if I just take a few notes, do you?

1103
01:09:33,653 --> 01:09:35,448
No.

1104
01:09:35,822 --> 01:09:38,532
How long have you worked
at the committee?

1105
01:09:38,533 --> 01:09:39,742
Committee?

1106
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:44,204
Yes, the Committee
to Reelect the President.

1107
01:09:44,205 --> 01:09:48,167
Oh. Oh, no, I don't work
at the Committee to Reelect the President.

1108
01:09:48,168 --> 01:09:52,968
I work at Garfinckel's,
in the Accounting Department.

1109
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,219
- Miss Abbott?
- Yes.

1110
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,425
Judith Abbott?

1111
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:06,073
Carolyn Abbott.

1112
01:10:07,645 --> 01:10:10,465
We're just doing something wrong.

1113
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:15,611
- It's never been there.
- No.

1114
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:18,227
We're doing something wrong.

1115
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:20,866
It's just not good enough.

1116
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:24,369
How can you keep going at something
past the point when you'd believe it?

1117
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,831
Just have to start all over again.

1118
01:10:32,212 --> 01:10:35,172
Nasemith, Narrow, Ness...

1119
01:10:35,173 --> 01:10:37,508
...Nickels, Nixon...

1120
01:10:37,509 --> 01:10:39,551
Ed Nixon.

1121
01:10:39,552 --> 01:10:42,638
Jolson, Jones...

1122
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:44,807
...Jordan, Jost.

1123
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:48,227
If we could only get somebody
that worked for Finance to talk.

1124
01:10:48,228 --> 01:10:50,145
- What about the bookkeeper?
- Which?

1125
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:52,439
The bookkeeper that worked
for both Slans and...

1126
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,441
- Oh, you're all right.
- Sloan and Stans.

1127
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:57,402
I've been there. I've called her twice.
There's no answer.

1128
01:10:57,403 --> 01:11:00,113
I say we should start again.

1129
01:11:00,114 --> 01:11:04,409
Abbott, Addison, Augusto, Alberts...

1130
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:07,329
...Aldus, Alessandro....

1131
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,916
Eulosky, Clan, Constell....

1132
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:15,212
Boyle, Brenner, Bromley, Jost....

1133
01:11:15,213 --> 01:11:19,508
Nasemith, Narrow, Ness, Nickels....

1134
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:23,098
Teeny, Sandstrom....

1135
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:27,057
Skroes, Skully...

1136
01:11:27,058 --> 01:11:30,135
Skully. We've been there twice.

1137
01:11:30,645 --> 01:11:34,940
All right, Wilcox, Winthrow,
Windsor, Worts....

1138
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:38,110
Two weeks work, half the names
crossed off and what have you got?

1139
01:11:38,111 --> 01:11:39,862
People aren't talking, Harry.

1140
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:42,698
And it's the way they're not talking
that's unnatural.

1141
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:46,118
We've been up all night.
We went over all the quotes of the people...

1142
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:48,620
It's like they're getting instructions.
It's pat.

1143
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:51,081
You wanna hear some real news?

1144
01:11:51,082 --> 01:11:53,500
That GAO report
in which you placed so much faith?

1145
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:56,169
It's been postponed
till after tonight's renomination.

1146
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,797
- What do you mean?
- Hughes got a call from Stans.

1147
01:11:58,798 --> 01:12:01,633
Says he has new information,
not to republish without it.

1148
01:12:01,634 --> 01:12:04,469
They're gonna bury the report
till after the renomination.

1149
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,138
The indictment will be out soon.

1150
01:12:06,139 --> 01:12:10,559
Every indication says the indictment will
stop at the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.

1151
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,586
And that's the end of your story.

1152
01:12:17,483 --> 01:12:22,283
The vote of all the delegates
has been recorded.

1153
01:12:23,114 --> 01:12:27,832
The vote for Richard Nixon...

1154
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:32,399
...is 1347.

1155
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:37,674
The vote for Paul McCloskey is 1.

1156
01:12:39,464 --> 01:12:44,264
And therefore I declare the nominee
of the Republican Party...

1157
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:48,472
...for president of the United States...

1158
01:12:48,473 --> 01:12:51,099
...President Richard Nixon.

1159
01:12:56,189 --> 01:13:00,989
Four more years!
Four more years! Four more years!

1160
01:13:17,877 --> 01:13:22,677
The president and the future
president of the United States of America.

1161
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,885
Wonderful young faces I see out here.

1162
01:13:26,886 --> 01:13:31,431
Your enthusiasm, your idealism,
your hard work.

1163
01:13:31,432 --> 01:13:34,059
This is your first vote...

1164
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:37,771
...and years from now,
I just hope you can all look back...

1165
01:13:37,772 --> 01:13:40,816
...and say it was one of your best votes.
Thank you.

1166
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:47,911
Four more years!
Four more years! Four more years!

1167
01:14:05,758 --> 01:14:08,093
Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post.

1168
01:14:08,094 --> 01:14:10,637
I just wanna ask you
a couple of questions.

1169
01:14:10,638 --> 01:14:13,223
Well, you don't want me,
you want my sister.

1170
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:15,600
It's for you. It's Carl Bernstein.

1171
01:14:15,601 --> 01:14:17,728
He's the guy from the Post. Get rid of him.

1172
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:20,147
Could I just borrow
one of your cigarettes there?

1173
01:14:20,148 --> 01:14:21,891
Sure.

1174
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:27,320
- You've really gotta go.
- Sure. Could I just get a match?

1175
01:14:27,321 --> 01:14:28,947
I understand your being afraid.

1176
01:14:28,948 --> 01:14:30,782
There's a lot of people like you...

1177
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:34,786
...who wanted to tell the truth,
but some people wouldn't listen.

1178
01:14:34,787 --> 01:14:38,290
Certain people have gone back
to the prosecutors and the FBI...

1179
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:41,367
...to give information
which they were never asked.

1180
01:14:42,754 --> 01:14:46,631
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when
he worked for Maurice Stans up at Finance.

1181
01:14:46,632 --> 01:14:50,427
We were just wondering
if you were promoted...

1182
01:14:50,428 --> 01:14:53,346
...to work for Mr. Stans
immediately after Mr. Sloan quit...

1183
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:57,450
...or whether there was some time lapse.

1184
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:04,140
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.

1185
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:08,236
Uh, can I get you some coffee
or something?

1186
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,596
Yeah, thanks very much.

1187
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:16,387
Door sticks.

1188
01:15:18,331 --> 01:15:23,131
Uh, could I just sit down for a second?

1189
01:15:24,879 --> 01:15:28,931
Sure, you can sit down,
but I'm not going to tell you anything.

1190
01:15:29,842 --> 01:15:31,585
Okay.

1191
01:15:52,532 --> 01:15:55,659
I was just curious why you lied just then.

1192
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,381
Have you been threatened
if you tell the truth?

1193
01:15:59,747 --> 01:16:01,593
No.

1194
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:03,630
Never in so many words.

1195
01:16:04,377 --> 01:16:06,378
- How do you like it?
- Just milk, thanks.

1196
01:16:06,379 --> 01:16:08,130
Okay, I'll just get the milk.

1197
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:12,134
Um, I saw in the wires
that Mrs. Stans was in the hospital.

1198
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:13,467
Is she feeling better?

1199
01:16:19,142 --> 01:16:21,893
The GAO,
the General Accounting report...

1200
01:16:21,894 --> 01:16:24,729
...said that there was $350,000...

1201
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:28,900
...in the safe
of the Committee to Reelect the President.

1202
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:33,004
Were you aware that it was that kind
of funds from the very beginning?

1203
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,787
A lot of people are watching me.
They know I know a lot.

1204
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:45,588
- Was it all in $100 bills?
- A lot of it was.

1205
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:48,587
I thought it was
an all-purpose political fund...

1206
01:16:48,588 --> 01:16:51,798
...you know, for taking fat cats to dinner,
things like that.

1207
01:16:51,799 --> 01:16:54,299
Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars
for dinners?

1208
01:16:56,429 --> 01:16:59,249
How was it paid out?

1209
01:17:02,727 --> 01:17:05,701
Not in one big chunk.

1210
01:17:06,272 --> 01:17:08,356
There was a list of 15 names...

1211
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:12,068
...and the amount of money
given to each person next to the name.

1212
01:17:12,069 --> 01:17:14,889
What happened to the list?

1213
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:17,741
It was destroyed.

1214
01:17:17,742 --> 01:17:20,049
It was the only record.

1215
01:17:20,494 --> 01:17:24,247
This... Don't pay any attention to this.
This is just for my memory.

1216
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:26,196
Hate the....

1217
01:17:26,459 --> 01:17:29,741
I have a very bad memory.

1218
01:17:29,962 --> 01:17:31,671
You won't be quoted by name.

1219
01:17:31,672 --> 01:17:35,050
In fact, we get confirmations
before we print anything.

1220
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:39,851
I can't be positive that that money
was used for the break-in, you understand?

1221
01:17:39,931 --> 01:17:41,640
Yes, I do.

1222
01:17:41,641 --> 01:17:46,410
- But people sure are worried.
- Which people?

1223
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,445
Think you could help me
with the disbursement of money...

1224
01:17:55,446 --> 01:17:58,240
...in terms of the number of people
that were involved?

1225
01:17:58,241 --> 01:18:00,138
How many?

1226
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:04,579
A group of them. About five.
I don't know their names.

1227
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:09,145
Would Mr. Sloan know?

1228
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:12,170
Here you are.

1229
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:16,971
- Would he have any...?
- I don't wanna say anymore, okay?

1230
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:27,732
Um, I won't be much longer.

1231
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:33,529
I wonder if you could just help me
a little bit about the money.

1232
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:37,161
We hear all kinds of figures.

1233
01:18:39,699 --> 01:18:43,410
- There was so much of it.
- How much is "so much"?

1234
01:18:43,411 --> 01:18:47,956
In one two-day period,
6 million dollars came in.

1235
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:50,625
- Six.
- Six million, cash.

1236
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,421
Mm-hm.

1237
01:18:52,753 --> 01:18:55,984
- We didn't know where to put it all.
- Heh.

1238
01:18:56,173 --> 01:18:57,590
I thought it was all legal.

1239
01:18:57,591 --> 01:19:00,552
I mean, I guess I did
until after the break-in...

1240
01:19:00,553 --> 01:19:02,846
...when I remembered
Gordon got so much of it.

1241
01:19:02,847 --> 01:19:07,206
- This is Mr. Liddy?
- It's all so rotten.

1242
01:19:07,226 --> 01:19:09,687
It's getting worse.

1243
01:19:09,895 --> 01:19:12,981
And the only one I care about
is Hugh Sloan.

1244
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:17,569
His wife was going to leave him
if he didn't stand up and do what was right.

1245
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:19,005
So he quit.

1246
01:19:20,448 --> 01:19:22,447
I was wondering...

1247
01:19:23,868 --> 01:19:28,668
...if Hugh Sloan was being set up now
as a fall guy for John Mitchell.

1248
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,742
What do you think?

1249
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:44,100
If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful.

1250
01:19:51,228 --> 01:19:52,613
Coffee's cold.

1251
01:19:54,648 --> 01:19:57,109
Is there any evidence...

1252
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:01,815
...that any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants...

1253
01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:03,643
...were part of this?

1254
01:20:04,075 --> 01:20:08,286
I had all the evidence. It was destroyed.
I don't know who destroyed it.

1255
01:20:08,287 --> 01:20:11,498
- I think Gordon did a lot of shredding.
- Hard evidence?

1256
01:20:11,499 --> 01:20:15,752
Well, I can't say that it would positively
prove that they planned the break-in...

1257
01:20:15,753 --> 01:20:17,962
...but it would come pretty close.

1258
01:20:17,963 --> 01:20:22,763
Can you tell me anything, anything,
about who got the money?

1259
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:27,852
We have had some help on this
from a couple sources...

1260
01:20:28,808 --> 01:20:32,090
...and this is a way of confirming it.

1261
01:20:34,939 --> 01:20:39,275
I don't want you to feel you're in a position
where you have to disclose names.

1262
01:20:39,276 --> 01:20:42,237
You know, I can just ask you initials...

1263
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:46,282
...and then that way
you're not divulging any information.

1264
01:20:46,283 --> 01:20:49,786
We have some idea.
Would that be all right?

1265
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:56,451
Was there an M?

1266
01:20:58,838 --> 01:21:00,888
Can you just nod either way?

1267
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:04,770
Did it go that high up?

1268
01:21:08,139 --> 01:21:09,984
L? Hm.

1269
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:13,143
I don't wanna say any more, okay?

1270
01:21:13,144 --> 01:21:16,312
I'm sorry, you said L or...?

1271
01:21:16,313 --> 01:21:20,775
I get confused.
Could we just go back for a second?

1272
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:23,069
In one six-day period,
over $6 million came in.

1273
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:25,530
Wouldn't believe what was going on
in that woman.

1274
01:21:25,531 --> 01:21:29,200
Stuff was ready to pour out of her.
I'm pouring down coffee to get it out...

1275
01:21:29,201 --> 01:21:30,660
...before she throws me out.

1276
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:32,912
- Give me your notes so...
- These are the notes.

1277
01:21:32,913 --> 01:21:35,081
- These?
- I got stuff on napkins, matchbooks.

1278
01:21:35,082 --> 01:21:37,792
I'm writing in the bathroom
while she's getting coffee.

1279
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:39,127
You're crazy. How am I...?

1280
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:42,297
You'd be crazy too if you were operating
on 20 cups of coffee.

1281
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:46,301
- Give me something I can get down.
- I got it. I got it all. Okay. Write.

1282
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:49,554
- Mitchell was in control.
- Wait a minute.

1283
01:21:49,555 --> 01:21:52,015
- There were men working under Mitchell.
- How many?

1284
01:21:52,016 --> 01:21:55,894
I don't know, but the men under Mitchell
received the money from the slush fund.

1285
01:21:55,895 --> 01:21:59,230
- Do we know how much money?
- Yeah, hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1286
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:02,150
And these men are the key
to what that money was used for.

1287
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,651
Boy, that woman was paranoid.

1288
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,738
At one point, I suddenly wondered
how high up this thing goes...

1289
01:22:06,739 --> 01:22:08,698
...and her paranoia finally got to me.

1290
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:12,327
I thought what we had was so hot
that CBS or NBC were gonna take the story.

1291
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:13,536
You're both paranoid.

1292
01:22:13,537 --> 01:22:16,414
She's afraid of Mitchell,
you're afraid of Walter Cronkite.

1293
01:22:16,415 --> 01:22:19,082
- Can we go back to what she said?
- Yeah.

1294
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:23,437
Here. L, P and M.

1295
01:22:23,714 --> 01:22:25,256
- What do you mean?
- L, P and M.

1296
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:27,258
- She'd only give me initials.
- Initials?

1297
01:22:27,259 --> 01:22:30,762
Yeah, the initials of the men
that worked under Mitchell: L, P and M.

1298
01:22:30,763 --> 01:22:32,931
You couldn't get the names?

1299
01:22:34,308 --> 01:22:37,435
If I could've, I would've.
I'm trying to get anything I can.

1300
01:22:37,436 --> 01:22:39,812
She said L, P and M...
That's all she'd give me.

1301
01:22:39,813 --> 01:22:41,940
...are the people
who worked under Mitchell.

1302
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:44,651
She said something about Mitchell.
She hates him.

1303
01:22:44,652 --> 01:22:46,361
- She said that?
- Here. She said:

1304
01:22:46,362 --> 01:22:49,447
"If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful."

1305
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:51,115
What are you writing about Sloan?

1306
01:22:51,116 --> 01:22:53,701
- "Sloan was the treasurer."
- His wife did what?

1307
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:57,622
"His wife is pregnant and made Sloan quit.
He no longer wanted to be part of it."

1308
01:22:57,623 --> 01:22:58,957
We've gotta go see Sloan.

1309
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:00,833
- Okay, make a note of it.
- All right.

1310
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:03,336
So, what have we got?
Where's that matchbook? Here.

1311
01:23:03,337 --> 01:23:05,588
- L, P and M.
- Okay, L, P and M.

1312
01:23:05,589 --> 01:23:08,466
- L could be LaRue. It could be Liddy.
- L is Liddy.

1313
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:10,635
- How do we know that?
- Because she said it.

1314
01:23:10,636 --> 01:23:13,221
Right here, she said,
"At the time of the break-in...

1315
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:16,266
...there was so much money
that I know Gordon got part of it."

1316
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:19,227
I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said yes. So L is Liddy.

1317
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:20,979
- Right.
- Okay, that leaves P and M.

1318
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,648
P could be Parkinson.

1319
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:26,317
It could be Porter. It could be...

1320
01:23:26,318 --> 01:23:29,779
Wait a minute. There was a guy.
There was a guy we talked to last week.

1321
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:33,283
Didn't he say there was a Bart Porter
who was a member of the committee?

1322
01:23:33,284 --> 01:23:37,036
- Porter was called before the grand jury.
- So P is definitely Porter.

1323
01:23:37,037 --> 01:23:38,496
P could be Porter.

1324
01:23:38,497 --> 01:23:42,000
P is Porter, L is Liddy. That leaves....
All that leaves is M.

1325
01:23:42,001 --> 01:23:44,794
M could be McCord. That's out.

1326
01:23:44,795 --> 01:23:47,755
It could be Mardian.

1327
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,757
It could be...

1328
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,634
- ...Magruder.
- I think it's Magruder.

1329
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:54,470
- I think it's Magruder too.
- Why do you think it is?

1330
01:23:54,471 --> 01:23:57,015
He was second in command under Mitchell.
Why do you?

1331
01:23:57,016 --> 01:24:01,144
Because at one time, he was the temporary
head of the committee, before Mitchell.

1332
01:24:01,145 --> 01:24:05,148
I don't want a cookie. We've gotta get
that bookkeeper to say it was Magruder.

1333
01:24:05,149 --> 01:24:09,152
- Never get her to say anything but "M."
- We gotta go back and get her to say it.

1334
01:24:09,153 --> 01:24:12,405
If we can make names of the initials...

1335
01:24:12,406 --> 01:24:14,991
...we'll know the people
who paid off the burglars.

1336
01:24:14,992 --> 01:24:17,914
We'll at least know who got the money.

1337
01:24:19,038 --> 01:24:22,165
The indictments that came down
from the grand jury today...

1338
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:26,878
...stop with the five burglars,
Hunt and Liddy.

1339
01:24:26,879 --> 01:24:30,965
Carl, we have got to go back there and get
that bookkeeper to say who the names are.

1340
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:32,592
She ain't gonna give it to you.

1341
01:24:32,593 --> 01:24:35,219
- I was with the woman for six hours.
- We gotta try.

1342
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,388
Then you have to trick her, threaten her.

1343
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:40,722
- Wait, you know what we could do?
- What?

1344
01:24:43,228 --> 01:24:46,105
- Listen, we go back there...
- Yeah.

1345
01:24:46,106 --> 01:24:47,899
...and you ask her who P is.

1346
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,150
- Yeah.
- And then I say:

1347
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:51,694
"No, no, no, we know P is Porter."
I just bury it.

1348
01:24:51,695 --> 01:24:54,280
- Wait a minute. I say to her, "Who is P?"
- Right.

1349
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:57,241
- Then you say to me...
- I say, "No, we know P is Porter."

1350
01:24:57,242 --> 01:24:59,077
- You try to fake her out?
- Right.

1351
01:24:59,078 --> 01:25:00,912
And what if she denies it?

1352
01:25:00,913 --> 01:25:02,246
- We're screwed.
- So?

1353
01:25:02,247 --> 01:25:07,047
- But if she doesn't, we know P is Porter.
- Try it.

1354
01:25:15,636 --> 01:25:19,097
- Hi.
- They'll see you.

1355
01:25:19,098 --> 01:25:21,599
Not if you let us in, they won't.

1356
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,435
- I'm Bob Woodward.
- They'll see your car.

1357
01:25:24,436 --> 01:25:27,438
We parked around the corner.

1358
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:30,316
You have answers for everything,
don't you?

1359
01:25:30,317 --> 01:25:33,445
If we did, we wouldn't be here.

1360
01:25:34,947 --> 01:25:36,322
You wrote what I told you.

1361
01:25:36,323 --> 01:25:38,449
No, not your name.
No one knows it was you.

1362
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:43,250
Could you tell us who got the money?
And how much?

1363
01:25:43,622 --> 01:25:47,208
You mean like,
"What did you do with the 25 grand, lady?"

1364
01:25:47,209 --> 01:25:48,952
What?

1365
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:53,297
Little jokes they're making
down at Finance these days.

1366
01:25:53,298 --> 01:25:56,509
If people are to be convinced
that Stans and Sloan are innocent...

1367
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:59,554
...then our reporting must be precise,
and you can help us.

1368
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:01,639
- Who is P?
- P, we know, is Porter.

1369
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:06,440
You said 25 grand.
Is that how much Porter got?

1370
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:11,533
Was it more?

1371
01:26:16,488 --> 01:26:19,616
Was it more than $50,000?

1372
01:26:22,244 --> 01:26:25,321
Was Magruder the only M
to receive money?

1373
01:26:32,463 --> 01:26:34,513
Who told you about Porter?

1374
01:26:36,717 --> 01:26:41,345
I'd like to move on to the
subject of the break-in at the Watergate...

1375
01:26:41,346 --> 01:26:43,723
...and the controversies
coming up out of that.

1376
01:26:43,724 --> 01:26:47,226
It has recently, very recently,
been reported now...

1377
01:26:47,227 --> 01:26:51,731
...that some documents were torn up
at the Committee to Reelect the President.

1378
01:26:51,732 --> 01:26:54,692
Uh, are you investigating the tearing up
of those documents...?

1379
01:26:54,693 --> 01:26:57,528
I think that came out
in the story in the Washington Post.

1380
01:26:57,529 --> 01:26:59,530
- Yes.
- I think the investigation...

1381
01:26:59,531 --> 01:27:03,701
...that has just concluded itself has
probably been one of the most intensive...

1382
01:27:03,702 --> 01:27:07,705
...that the Department of Justice
and the FBI has ever been involved in.

1383
01:27:07,706 --> 01:27:09,957
Some 1500 persons were interviewed...

1384
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:14,128
...1800 leads were followed,
333 agents were involved...

1385
01:27:14,129 --> 01:27:16,506
...14,000 man-hours.

1386
01:27:16,507 --> 01:27:21,307
Fifty-one of the 59 FBI field officers
were involved. Uh....

1387
01:27:21,553 --> 01:27:23,513
And that, I think...

1388
01:27:23,514 --> 01:27:27,558
...is a great credit
to justice in this country.

1389
01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:29,936
Did you know that documents
had been destroyed?

1390
01:27:29,937 --> 01:27:31,269
No, I did not.

1391
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:37,735
All these neat little houses
on all these nice little streets.

1392
01:27:37,736 --> 01:27:40,613
It's hard to believe
that something's wrong...

1393
01:27:40,614 --> 01:27:42,657
...in some of those little houses.

1394
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:44,708
No, it isn't.

1395
01:27:45,702 --> 01:27:48,287
- Hello. I'm Bob Woodward.
- Hello. I'm Carl Bernstein.

1396
01:27:48,288 --> 01:27:51,165
We'd just like to talk to Mr. Sloan
for a couple minutes.

1397
01:27:51,166 --> 01:27:54,478
- He's resting right now.
- Are you Mrs. Sloan?

1398
01:27:55,504 --> 01:27:59,093
- You're the two from the Post, aren't you?
- Yes.

1399
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:04,141
- This is an honest house.
- That's why we'd like to see your husband.

1400
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:08,766
In the face of charges that might be brought
against people that are innocent, we feel...

1401
01:28:08,767 --> 01:28:10,424
It's really for his benefit.

1402
01:28:10,644 --> 01:28:13,054
No, it's not.

1403
01:28:15,357 --> 01:28:17,100
No.

1404
01:28:17,276 --> 01:28:19,944
- It's not.
- Deborah?

1405
01:28:19,945 --> 01:28:22,446
- Tell them to come in.
- Thanks.

1406
01:28:22,447 --> 01:28:24,824
- Hi. Carl Bernstein.
- How do you do? Hugh Sloan.

1407
01:28:24,825 --> 01:28:26,033
Bob Woodward.

1408
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:30,115
- How you doing? Hugh Sloan.
- I appreciate you giving us the time.

1409
01:28:36,086 --> 01:28:40,381
You know, the reason we're here, basically,
is that we talked to certain people...

1410
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:42,508
...who indicated you left the committee...

1411
01:28:42,509 --> 01:28:44,969
...because you no longer wanted
to be part of it.

1412
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:47,013
Maybe there's a legitimate explanation...

1413
01:28:47,014 --> 01:28:51,066
...for why the money was handed
to Liddy and Mitchell's aides.

1414
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:56,125
Try and understand this.

1415
01:28:56,815 --> 01:28:59,609
- I'm a Republican.
- I am too.

1416
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,444
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.

1417
01:29:01,445 --> 01:29:04,614
I worked in the White House for four years,
and so did my wife.

1418
01:29:04,615 --> 01:29:06,824
What happened on June 17th...

1419
01:29:06,825 --> 01:29:09,327
...I don't think the president
knew anything about.

1420
01:29:09,328 --> 01:29:11,829
Is it possible some of his people
might have known?

1421
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:13,039
I'm not sure.

1422
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,916
Think the truth will come out at the trial?

1423
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:17,209
- That's another thing I'm not sure about.
- Why?

1424
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:19,921
Obviously because certain people
lie to the prosecutor.

1425
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:22,173
No, we were never told flat-out,
"Don't talk."

1426
01:29:22,174 --> 01:29:24,175
But the message was clear, though.

1427
01:29:24,176 --> 01:29:27,094
In other words, by their very silence,
there was a cover-up.

1428
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:29,847
They didn't urge us to come forward
and tell the truth.

1429
01:29:29,848 --> 01:29:32,183
"They" meaning the White House?

1430
01:29:32,184 --> 01:29:34,393
The committee's not
an independent operation.

1431
01:29:34,394 --> 01:29:36,479
Everything's cleared
with the White House.

1432
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,774
And I don't think that the FBI
or the prosecutors understand that.

1433
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:42,544
That report on the cash...

1434
01:29:42,736 --> 01:29:46,364
...in the CREEP safe, that...
What was it?... $350,000, is that a...?

1435
01:29:46,365 --> 01:29:49,283
- No, more.
- Was that a correct figure?

1436
01:29:49,284 --> 01:29:52,412
No, it was closer to 1 million.

1437
01:29:52,955 --> 01:29:55,665
And as treasurer,
you could release those funds?

1438
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,833
When so ordered.

1439
01:29:57,834 --> 01:30:00,044
We don't know who could order you.

1440
01:30:00,045 --> 01:30:02,380
- We just know there were four.
- There were five.

1441
01:30:02,381 --> 01:30:05,383
- Five?
- Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're obvious.

1442
01:30:05,384 --> 01:30:07,843
Well, there had to be
a White House overseer.

1443
01:30:07,844 --> 01:30:09,679
- Yeah, Colson.
- What?

1444
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:14,480
No, Colson's too smart to get involved
directly with anything like that.

1445
01:30:14,685 --> 01:30:16,632
It's Haldeman.

1446
01:30:18,689 --> 01:30:20,534
Right?

1447
01:30:21,233 --> 01:30:23,109
I won't talk about the other two.

1448
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,611
- They both worked at the White House?
- One did.

1449
01:30:25,612 --> 01:30:28,698
The other one's not in Washington,
but that's all I'll say.

1450
01:30:28,699 --> 01:30:30,491
- Kalmbach.
- Nixon's personal lawyer.

1451
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:31,742
- Yeah.
- Right?

1452
01:30:31,743 --> 01:30:35,469
- Nixon's personal lawyer?
- I can't say anything. I'm sorry.

1453
01:30:37,207 --> 01:30:39,668
- Well....
- When's the baby due?

1454
01:30:41,253 --> 01:30:44,296
Um, soon. Next month.

1455
01:30:44,297 --> 01:30:45,798
Are you gonna stay here?

1456
01:30:45,799 --> 01:30:49,093
- No, I don't think so.
- You decided where you're gonna go?

1457
01:30:49,094 --> 01:30:53,055
I've been looking for a job
in the private sector, but it's....

1458
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:56,389
It's very hard.
My name's been in the papers too much.

1459
01:30:57,561 --> 01:31:01,105
- You know one thing I'm not clear about?
- What?

1460
01:31:01,106 --> 01:31:02,690
I don't know how... How did...?

1461
01:31:02,691 --> 01:31:05,776
When you handed out the money,
how did that work exactly?

1462
01:31:05,777 --> 01:31:08,136
Badly.

1463
01:31:11,533 --> 01:31:15,119
I think what Bob means is,
ordinarily, what was the procedure?

1464
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,581
Routine. I'd call John Mitchell
over at the Justice Department.

1465
01:31:18,582 --> 01:31:23,076
- He'd say, "Go ahead, give out the money."
This was all done verbally?

1466
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:25,111
Yes.

1467
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:28,049
We know there were five men
who controlled the slush fund.

1468
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,718
- Mitchell, Stans and Magruder.
- Those three we've got.

1469
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,263
- All three have been named by two sources.
- What about the other two?

1470
01:31:34,264 --> 01:31:36,474
- Kalmbach.
- We're pretty sure of Kalmbach.

1471
01:31:36,475 --> 01:31:39,643
Maybe you'd better wait
till we get all five, huh?

1472
01:31:39,644 --> 01:31:40,853
Certain on Mitchell?

1473
01:31:40,854 --> 01:31:44,190
We know he approved payments to Liddy
while he was attorney general.

1474
01:31:44,191 --> 01:31:45,983
- You got more than one source?
- Yes.

1475
01:31:45,984 --> 01:31:47,193
- Who are they?
- Sloan.

1476
01:31:47,194 --> 01:31:48,402
Sloan and who else?

1477
01:31:48,403 --> 01:31:52,239
Another guy at Justice who won't confirm
the other two who controlled the fund.

1478
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,825
- What about Deep Throat?
- He's not a source on this.

1479
01:31:54,826 --> 01:31:56,494
- Do any of them have an ax?
- Nope.

1480
01:31:56,495 --> 01:31:59,413
Personal, political, sexual?
Anything at all on Mitchell?

1481
01:31:59,414 --> 01:32:00,873
- No.
- Can we use their names?

1482
01:32:00,874 --> 01:32:02,333
- No.
- Goddamn it.

1483
01:32:02,334 --> 01:32:05,469
When is somebody gonna go on the record
in this story?

1484
01:32:08,215 --> 01:32:11,675
You are about to write a story
that says the former attorney general...

1485
01:32:11,676 --> 01:32:16,446
...the highest-ranking law-enforcement
officer in this country, is a crook.

1486
01:32:18,517 --> 01:32:21,388
Just be sure you're right.

1487
01:32:23,688 --> 01:32:26,982
- Essex House, may I help you?
- John Mitchell.

1488
01:32:34,699 --> 01:32:36,408
Yes?

1489
01:32:36,409 --> 01:32:39,036
Sir, this is Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post...

1490
01:32:39,037 --> 01:32:41,664
...and I'm sorry to disturb you
at this hour.

1491
01:32:41,665 --> 01:32:45,251
Tomorrow we're running a story
in the paper...

1492
01:32:45,252 --> 01:32:50,052
...and we just think that you should
have a chance to comment on it.

1493
01:32:50,674 --> 01:32:52,550
What does it say?

1494
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:57,351
"John N. Mitchell, while serving
as United States attorney general..."

1495
01:32:58,181 --> 01:33:00,933
...personally controlled
a secret cash fund...

1496
01:33:00,934 --> 01:33:03,519
...used to gather information
about the Democrats...

1497
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,064
"...according to sources involved
in the Watergate investigation."

1498
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:09,942
- Jesus.
- "Beginning in the spring of 1971..."

1499
01:33:09,943 --> 01:33:12,403
...a year before
he left the Justice Department...

1500
01:33:12,404 --> 01:33:14,822
...to become President Nixon's
campaign manager.

1501
01:33:14,823 --> 01:33:19,201
"On March 1, Mitchell personally approved
withdrawals from the fund."

1502
01:33:19,202 --> 01:33:21,787
All that crap,
you're putting it in the paper?

1503
01:33:21,788 --> 01:33:24,665
- Well...
- Look, it's all been denied.

1504
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,750
Tell your publisher, tell Katie Graham...

1505
01:33:26,751 --> 01:33:30,129
...she's gonna get her tit caught
in a big ringer if that's published.

1506
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,756
Christ, that's the most sickening thing
I ever heard.

1507
01:33:32,757 --> 01:33:36,010
- I wonder if I could ask you some questions.
- What time is it?

1508
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:38,179
It's 11:30, sir.

1509
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,306
Eleven-thirty?

1510
01:33:40,307 --> 01:33:43,642
- Is it morning or night?
- It's 11:30 at night, sir.

1511
01:33:43,643 --> 01:33:46,645
- Oh.
- Sir, the Committee to Reelect...

1512
01:33:46,646 --> 01:33:50,608
...has issued a statement to our story,
but there are a couple questions...

1513
01:33:50,609 --> 01:33:53,819
Did the committee tell you
to go ahead and publish the story?

1514
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:56,572
You fellas have a great ball game going.

1515
01:33:56,573 --> 01:34:00,284
As soon as you're done,
we're gonna do a story on all of you.

1516
01:34:00,285 --> 01:34:05,085
- Sir, there's just a couple of questions...
- Call my law office in the morning.

1517
01:34:06,917 --> 01:34:09,627
There's no question
you properly identified yourself?

1518
01:34:09,628 --> 01:34:12,140
Said it right off the top.

1519
01:34:12,923 --> 01:34:17,676
- Mitchell know he was talking to a reporter?
- Yeah, but I think I woke him up.

1520
01:34:17,677 --> 01:34:21,267
- You have good notes?
- Verbatim.

1521
01:34:21,473 --> 01:34:25,165
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?

1522
01:34:25,769 --> 01:34:27,937
Well, cut the words "her tit" and print it.

1523
01:34:27,938 --> 01:34:31,271
- Why?
- This is a family newspaper.

1524
01:34:34,444 --> 01:34:35,903
Once when I was reporting...

1525
01:34:35,904 --> 01:34:38,989
...Lyndon Johnson's top guy
gave me the word...

1526
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:42,243
...they were looking for a successor
for J. Edgar Hoover.

1527
01:34:42,244 --> 01:34:46,121
I wrote it, and the day it appeared,
Johnson held a press conference...

1528
01:34:46,122 --> 01:34:49,625
...and appointed Hoover
head of the FBI for life.

1529
01:34:49,626 --> 01:34:52,336
When he was done,
he turned to his top guy...

1530
01:34:52,337 --> 01:34:55,703
...and the president said,
"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you."'

1531
01:34:56,716 --> 01:34:59,385
Then everybody said,
"You did it, Ben. You screwed up.

1532
01:34:59,386 --> 01:35:02,596
You stuck us with Hoover forever."

1533
01:35:02,597 --> 01:35:04,390
I screwed up...

1534
01:35:04,391 --> 01:35:07,571
...but I wasn't wrong. Hm.

1535
01:35:09,187 --> 01:35:12,674
How much can you tell me
about Deep Throat?

1536
01:35:13,149 --> 01:35:15,317
How much do you need to know?

1537
01:35:15,318 --> 01:35:17,523
Do you trust him?

1538
01:35:18,738 --> 01:35:20,533
Yeah.

1539
01:35:22,033 --> 01:35:26,833
I can't do the reporting for my reporters,
which means I have to trust them.

1540
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:31,725
And I hate trusting anybody.

1541
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,363
Run that baby.

1542
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:24,261
The Washington Post reported
that while still in office as attorney general...

1543
01:36:24,262 --> 01:36:28,599
...John Mitchell had personally controlled
a secret Republican fund.

1544
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:32,728
Mitchell denied any such involvement
and called the story "ludicrous."

1545
01:36:32,729 --> 01:36:36,231
The new charge also brought a response
from Vice President Agnew...

1546
01:36:36,232 --> 01:36:37,775
...at his stop in Tampa.

1547
01:36:37,776 --> 01:36:41,362
I have full confidence in Mr. Mitchell...

1548
01:36:41,363 --> 01:36:44,490
...and in the people
in the Republican organization...

1549
01:36:44,491 --> 01:36:48,452
...and I think that
that kind of unattributed report...

1550
01:36:48,453 --> 01:36:51,622
...at a time like this is counterproductive.

1551
01:36:51,623 --> 01:36:56,293
We must bear in mind
that those who published it...

1552
01:36:56,294 --> 01:36:59,588
...have already shown their sympathy
for the other ticket.

1553
01:36:59,589 --> 01:37:02,674
- A band and some young cheerleaders...
- All non-denial denials.

1554
01:37:02,675 --> 01:37:06,053
They doubt our ancestry,
but they don't say the story isn't accurate.

1555
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:08,180
Did you understand
one thing he was saying?

1556
01:37:08,181 --> 01:37:11,141
What I can't figure out is,
what is a real denial?

1557
01:37:11,142 --> 01:37:15,354
Well, if they start calling us goddamn liars,
we better start circling the wagons.

1558
01:37:15,355 --> 01:37:18,769
- When you think they'll start doing that?
- When they get out of Tampa.

1559
01:37:20,151 --> 01:37:22,820
Joe, come on,
what's going on with you guys at the FBI?

1560
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:26,156
I've been trying to get you for weeks.
Secretary says you're not in.

1561
01:37:26,157 --> 01:37:28,158
Last night, you said you couldn't talk.

1562
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:30,994
This morning,
soon as our Mitchell story hits the stands...

1563
01:37:30,995 --> 01:37:33,622
...you call and say you gotta see me
right away. Why?

1564
01:37:33,623 --> 01:37:36,208
You guys have been causing big trouble
at the bureau.

1565
01:37:36,209 --> 01:37:37,584
Why?

1566
01:37:37,585 --> 01:37:41,130
Our reports are showing up
in your paper almost verbatim.

1567
01:37:41,131 --> 01:37:44,967
I mean, you've really been on the mark,
except for Mitchell.

1568
01:37:44,968 --> 01:37:47,344
Now, we didn't have that...

1569
01:37:47,345 --> 01:37:49,012
...that he controlled the funds.

1570
01:37:49,013 --> 01:37:50,514
Right.

1571
01:37:50,515 --> 01:37:52,307
Our agents have been busting ass...

1572
01:37:52,308 --> 01:37:55,102
...but we're gonna go back
and see if we missed anything.

1573
01:37:55,103 --> 01:37:58,772
What I don't understand is all the people
who know details of the bugging...

1574
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:00,482
...the FBI hasn't even talked to.

1575
01:38:00,483 --> 01:38:04,194
Why have you conducted interviews of
CREEP personnel at CREEP headquarters...

1576
01:38:04,195 --> 01:38:07,448
...instead of at their homes,
where they might feel freer to talk?

1577
01:38:07,449 --> 01:38:08,699
Joe, wait a minute.

1578
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:11,535
Why have the interviews at CREEP
always been conducted...

1579
01:38:11,536 --> 01:38:14,371
...within the presence of the lawyer
who works for CREEP?

1580
01:38:14,372 --> 01:38:17,207
Look, you know,
I can't answer for the whole bureau.

1581
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:21,106
- Oh, come on, I'm just...
- I do what I'm told.

1582
01:38:21,546 --> 01:38:24,520
I followed my orders, period.

1583
01:38:29,929 --> 01:38:32,134
What orders?

1584
01:38:35,185 --> 01:38:39,339
Woodward! Woodward!

1585
01:38:40,064 --> 01:38:41,859
Wait!

1586
01:38:42,484 --> 01:38:44,277
Bob!

1587
01:38:46,488 --> 01:38:50,334
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.

1588
01:38:50,992 --> 01:38:54,369
This morning I get a tip
to call a guy by the name of Alex Shipley...

1589
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:57,206
...who is now the assistant attorney general
of Tennessee.

1590
01:38:57,207 --> 01:38:59,625
Now, the guy told me that called me...
That said...

1591
01:38:59,626 --> 01:39:02,336
He said that Shipley was asked
in the summer of 1971...

1592
01:39:02,337 --> 01:39:04,880
...by an old Army buddy,
a Donald Segretti...

1593
01:39:04,881 --> 01:39:06,840
...to join a group of other lawyers...

1594
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:09,885
...for Nixon's campaign
to sabotage the Democratic candidates.

1595
01:39:09,886 --> 01:39:13,180
- Make a left. We'll go to my place.
- Sabotage Democratic candidates?

1596
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:17,226
I was able to make a couple calls,
and I got Segretti's records for the year...

1597
01:39:17,227 --> 01:39:20,812
His travel records for the year 1971-'72.

1598
01:39:20,813 --> 01:39:22,022
Does the FBI know...?

1599
01:39:22,023 --> 01:39:24,191
- Did you say left or right?
- Left, my place.

1600
01:39:24,192 --> 01:39:27,486
- We gotta go through the records.
- Does the FBI know about Segretti?

1601
01:39:27,487 --> 01:39:30,781
FBI interrogated Segretti,
found he wasn't involved in the break-in.

1602
01:39:30,782 --> 01:39:32,783
They dropped it, didn't follow through.

1603
01:39:32,784 --> 01:39:34,952
- Where is he?
- He's in California.

1604
01:39:34,953 --> 01:39:36,620
- Jesus, look at this.
- What?

1605
01:39:36,621 --> 01:39:40,229
Segretti crisscrossed the country
at least a dozen times.

1606
01:39:42,126 --> 01:39:45,087
Only stayed in cities
where there were Democratic primaries.

1607
01:39:45,088 --> 01:39:47,130
If the break-in was just one incident...

1608
01:39:47,131 --> 01:39:49,925
...in a campaign of sabotage
that began a year before....

1609
01:39:49,926 --> 01:39:52,135
For the first time,
the break-in makes sense.

1610
01:39:52,136 --> 01:39:53,345
This isn't so crazy.

1611
01:39:53,346 --> 01:39:55,639
This whole thing didn't start
with the bugging.

1612
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,100
Segretti was doing this
a year before the bugging.

1613
01:39:58,101 --> 01:40:00,811
And a year before,
Nixon was running behind Muskie...

1614
01:40:00,812 --> 01:40:03,632
...before Muskie self-destructed.

1615
01:40:03,898 --> 01:40:06,257
If he self-destructed.

1616
01:40:06,693 --> 01:40:09,528
- Hi. Uh, Donald Segretti?
- That's right.

1617
01:40:09,529 --> 01:40:12,990
I'm Carl Bernstein
from the Washington Post.

1618
01:40:12,991 --> 01:40:14,939
Hi.

1619
01:40:15,326 --> 01:40:16,743
What can I do for you?

1620
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:21,544
Well, my paper just sent me out here
to try to persuade you to go on the record.

1621
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:22,833
Why me?

1622
01:40:22,834 --> 01:40:24,876
Because you were the head coordinator...

1623
01:40:24,877 --> 01:40:29,590
...of Nixon's sabotage campaign
against the Democrats.

1624
01:40:29,591 --> 01:40:34,001
- Carl, you want some coffee?
- You read my mind.

1625
01:40:38,516 --> 01:40:41,685
Carl, tell me something. What...?

1626
01:40:41,686 --> 01:40:44,187
What do you imagine
the head coordinator does?

1627
01:40:44,188 --> 01:40:48,150
I guess basically you were involved
in recruiting other people like yourself...

1628
01:40:48,151 --> 01:40:49,359
...other lawyers.

1629
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,904
- Lawyers?
- Like Alex Shipley.

1630
01:40:52,905 --> 01:40:57,701
I made it clear that I would not do anything
violent or illegal.

1631
01:40:57,702 --> 01:40:59,870
What do you mean by illegal?

1632
01:40:59,871 --> 01:41:03,957
Watergate. I mean, that's...
The whole bugging, that's horrendous.

1633
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:06,376
And what kind of stuff
do you guys do, then?

1634
01:41:06,377 --> 01:41:09,095
Nickel-and-dime stuff.

1635
01:41:09,339 --> 01:41:10,714
Stuff.

1636
01:41:10,715 --> 01:41:12,799
Stuff with a little wit attached to it.

1637
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,385
You mean when you sent out
on Muskie's stationery...

1638
01:41:15,386 --> 01:41:18,847
...that Senator Hubert Humphrey
was going out with call girls?

1639
01:41:18,848 --> 01:41:21,850
Listen, if anything,
it helped the man's image.

1640
01:41:21,851 --> 01:41:24,853
What was the one
on Muskie's stationery you sent out...

1641
01:41:24,854 --> 01:41:28,774
...that said that Scoop Jackson
was having a bastard child?

1642
01:41:28,775 --> 01:41:32,416
So sometimes it got up to a quarter,
off the record.

1643
01:41:32,737 --> 01:41:37,537
I think one of the most interesting ones
was the "Canuck" letter.

1644
01:41:37,742 --> 01:41:38,972
What about it?

1645
01:41:39,911 --> 01:41:43,413
Come on. Where you claimed
that Muskie slurred the Canadians.

1646
01:41:43,414 --> 01:41:45,916
No, I didn't write that.

1647
01:41:45,917 --> 01:41:47,084
Do you know who did?

1648
01:41:47,085 --> 01:41:50,379
Carl, when you guys print it in the papers,
then I'll know.

1649
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:53,048
Smart guy, Donald.

1650
01:41:53,049 --> 01:41:54,331
You're no dummy.

1651
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:57,761
I'm a lawyer, Carl.

1652
01:41:57,762 --> 01:41:59,221
I'm a lawyer.

1653
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:00,931
I'm a good lawyer...

1654
01:42:00,932 --> 01:42:05,445
...and I'll probably wind up going to jail
and being disbarred.

1655
01:42:06,813 --> 01:42:11,428
And I don't know what I did
that was so goddamn awful.

1656
01:42:15,446 --> 01:42:18,573
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.

1657
01:42:18,574 --> 01:42:23,374
- I didn't go looking for the job.
- Well, that's important.

1658
01:42:23,538 --> 01:42:26,050
Chapin came to you.

1659
01:42:32,004 --> 01:42:33,213
You know what?

1660
01:42:33,214 --> 01:42:37,467
It's funny, but I keep forgetting
that you guys knew each other in college.

1661
01:42:37,468 --> 01:42:41,805
You were friends at SC, you and Chapin.
Who else was there?

1662
01:42:41,806 --> 01:42:43,807
There was me...

1663
01:42:43,808 --> 01:42:45,600
...Dwight...

1664
01:42:45,601 --> 01:42:47,018
...Ziegler.

1665
01:42:47,019 --> 01:42:48,645
The whole USC mafia.

1666
01:42:48,646 --> 01:42:51,606
And that's when you got involved
in the student elections...

1667
01:42:51,607 --> 01:42:55,819
...and started to try to get your man in,
so you stuffed ballot boxes and....

1668
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:59,489
What was that term you guys used
for screwing up the opposition?

1669
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:02,367
- Rat-fucking.
- That's right.

1670
01:43:02,368 --> 01:43:03,994
You were doing the same stuff...

1671
01:43:03,995 --> 01:43:06,830
...when you were out campaigning
for President Nixon.

1672
01:43:06,831 --> 01:43:10,005
Let me tell you something,
we did a lot of worse things in college.

1673
01:43:11,544 --> 01:43:14,463
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.

1674
01:43:14,464 --> 01:43:17,382
What would you have done
if you were just out of the Army...

1675
01:43:17,383 --> 01:43:19,217
...been away for four years...

1676
01:43:19,218 --> 01:43:22,679
...didn't know what kind of law
you wanted to practice...

1677
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,348
...and one day you get a call
from an old friend...

1678
01:43:25,349 --> 01:43:29,060
...asking if you wanna go to work
for the president of the United States?

1679
01:43:29,061 --> 01:43:33,648
Jeez. Chapin was the appointment secretary
for Nixon when he called.

1680
01:43:33,649 --> 01:43:34,858
Yeah.

1681
01:43:34,859 --> 01:43:38,695
If those sinister things really happened,
I don't think Dwight knew about them.

1682
01:43:38,696 --> 01:43:43,005
- He just did what he was told.
- Told by who?

1683
01:43:53,044 --> 01:43:55,505
What's the topic for tonight?

1684
01:44:00,551 --> 01:44:02,397
Rat-fucking.

1685
01:44:04,013 --> 01:44:07,974
In my day, it was simply known
as a double-cross.

1686
01:44:07,975 --> 01:44:11,514
In our present context...

1687
01:44:11,813 --> 01:44:16,326
...it means infiltration of the Democrats.

1688
01:44:16,526 --> 01:44:19,110
Segretti won't go on the record...

1689
01:44:19,111 --> 01:44:22,246
...but if he would,
we know he would implicate Chapin.

1690
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:27,180
And that would put you
inside the White House.

1691
01:44:27,912 --> 01:44:29,655
Who?

1692
01:44:31,207 --> 01:44:33,668
Can you be specific?

1693
01:44:33,751 --> 01:44:35,597
How high up?

1694
01:44:38,422 --> 01:44:42,166
You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1695
01:44:42,677 --> 01:44:46,164
I don't like newspapers.

1696
01:44:46,722 --> 01:44:51,522
I don't care for inexactitude
and shallowness.

1697
01:44:53,604 --> 01:44:55,522
The CREEP slush fund...

1698
01:44:55,523 --> 01:44:59,067
...that financed the rat-fucking,
we've just about got that nailed down.

1699
01:44:59,068 --> 01:45:00,759
Did you change cabs?

1700
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:09,870
Yeah.

1701
01:45:09,871 --> 01:45:13,717
Does the FBI know what we know?

1702
01:45:16,294 --> 01:45:18,755
Does Justice?

1703
01:45:22,133 --> 01:45:25,209
Why haven't they done anything?

1704
01:45:25,219 --> 01:45:30,019
If it didn't deal directly with the break-in,
they didn't pursue.

1705
01:45:30,683 --> 01:45:32,733
Who told them not to?

1706
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:36,502
Don't you understand what you're on to?

1707
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:42,689
- Mitchell knew?
- Of course Mitchell knew.

1708
01:45:43,029 --> 01:45:45,947
Do you think something this size
just happens?

1709
01:45:45,948 --> 01:45:47,991
Haldeman had to know too.

1710
01:45:47,992 --> 01:45:51,838
You'll get nothing from me
about Haldeman.

1711
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:56,291
Segretti said that...

1712
01:45:56,292 --> 01:46:01,092
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.

1713
01:46:01,881 --> 01:46:05,592
The letter that destroyed
the Muskie candidacy...

1714
01:46:05,593 --> 01:46:07,844
...did that come
from inside the White House?

1715
01:46:07,845 --> 01:46:11,097
- You're missing the overall.
- But what overall?

1716
01:46:11,098 --> 01:46:14,643
They were frightened of Muskie,
and look who got destroyed.

1717
01:46:14,644 --> 01:46:18,521
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.

1718
01:46:18,522 --> 01:46:21,942
They bugged, they followed people.

1719
01:46:21,943 --> 01:46:25,153
False press leaks, fake letters.

1720
01:46:25,154 --> 01:46:27,530
They canceled
Democratic campaign rallies.

1721
01:46:27,531 --> 01:46:31,173
They investigated
Democratic private lives.

1722
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:34,245
They planted spies, stole documents,
and on and on.

1723
01:46:34,246 --> 01:46:37,165
Now, don't tell me
you think this is all the work...

1724
01:46:37,166 --> 01:46:40,294
...of little Don Segretti.

1725
01:46:41,128 --> 01:46:43,693
The FBI and Justice know this?

1726
01:49:07,108 --> 01:49:11,364
Send me the clips
on the Food and Drug story.

1727
01:49:12,029 --> 01:49:14,572
Yes, sir, and I want... My question is...

1728
01:49:14,573 --> 01:49:15,782
- Carl.
- Yeah?

1729
01:49:15,783 --> 01:49:17,659
Why don't you pick up your messages?

1730
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:19,786
- Right. You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

1731
01:49:19,787 --> 01:49:20,995
Who's Pete Teller?

1732
01:49:20,996 --> 01:49:24,332
Haven't the slightest idea.
I have this whole place to take care of.

1733
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:27,461
- Carl?
- Yeah, one second.

1734
01:49:28,045 --> 01:49:30,505
- Tell him to leave his number next time.
- Will do.

1735
01:49:30,506 --> 01:49:32,799
- Hi.
- You guys know about the "Canuck" letter?

1736
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,134
Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late.

1737
01:49:34,135 --> 01:49:37,672
I just wanna make sure
you know who wrote it, though.

1738
01:49:38,055 --> 01:49:39,798
What?

1739
01:49:39,807 --> 01:49:41,057
What?

1740
01:49:41,058 --> 01:49:44,853
You mean the letter that sabotaged
the Muskie candidacy? All right, come here.

1741
01:49:44,854 --> 01:49:48,495
- When did he tell you this?
- I already told you....

1742
01:49:49,859 --> 01:49:52,012
I gotta tell Bob.

1743
01:49:55,281 --> 01:49:57,824
- Woodward.
- What?

1744
01:49:57,825 --> 01:50:01,161
One second.
Come here, come here, come here.

1745
01:50:01,162 --> 01:50:04,831
Come here. Tell him what you told me.

1746
01:50:04,832 --> 01:50:07,036
Come here, sit down.

1747
01:50:08,169 --> 01:50:12,117
Just exactly the way you said it to me,
just say it to him.

1748
01:50:12,256 --> 01:50:14,674
Ken Clawson told me
he wrote the "Canuck" letter.

1749
01:50:14,675 --> 01:50:17,385
The letter that said Muskie
was slurring the Canadians.

1750
01:50:17,386 --> 01:50:20,763
The deputy director of Communications
wrote the "Canuck" letter.

1751
01:50:20,764 --> 01:50:23,016
- When did he tell you?
- We were having drinks.

1752
01:50:23,017 --> 01:50:25,059
- Where were you?
- My apartment.

1753
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:26,561
When did you say he told you?

1754
01:50:26,562 --> 01:50:28,605
- Two weeks ago.
- What else did he say?

1755
01:50:28,606 --> 01:50:30,940
He didn't say anything?
Come on, you're hedging.

1756
01:50:30,941 --> 01:50:33,776
Do you think he said it
to get you to go to bed with him?

1757
01:50:33,777 --> 01:50:35,653
- Jesus.
- No, I wanna hear her say it.

1758
01:50:35,654 --> 01:50:39,449
You think he said that to impress you
to try to get you to go to bed with him?

1759
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:43,039
Why did it take you two weeks
to tell us this, Sally?

1760
01:50:43,913 --> 01:50:48,426
I guess I don't have the taste for the jugular
you guys have.

1761
01:50:48,834 --> 01:50:51,127
There's no specific cause, no....

1762
01:50:51,128 --> 01:50:52,837
You're claiming it was a misunderstanding?

1763
01:50:52,838 --> 01:50:55,089
Absolutely. Sally's got it all wrong.

1764
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:57,133
I never told her I wrote that letter.

1765
01:50:57,134 --> 01:50:59,427
We were shooting the breeze
about the election.

1766
01:50:59,428 --> 01:51:01,054
She's an awfully good reporter.

1767
01:51:01,055 --> 01:51:03,765
I don't remember her
getting much wrong before, do you?

1768
01:51:03,766 --> 01:51:05,433
That's a real bullshit question.

1769
01:51:05,434 --> 01:51:08,311
That is a question
straight out of Wichita, Kansas.

1770
01:51:08,312 --> 01:51:09,854
Listen, one last thing.

1771
01:51:09,855 --> 01:51:12,982
Do you remember
where this shooting the breeze took place?

1772
01:51:12,983 --> 01:51:15,109
What do you mean, where?

1773
01:51:15,110 --> 01:51:18,029
Well, I mean, was it a restaurant
or her apartment or a bar?

1774
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:21,658
Look, I've forgotten the entire incident,
but it wasn't in her apartment.

1775
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:22,867
Do you remember when...?

1776
01:51:22,868 --> 01:51:26,287
I don't have time for this.
I'm a busy man.

1777
01:51:26,288 --> 01:51:28,998
- You get that?
- What did he say about meeting in a bar?

1778
01:51:28,999 --> 01:51:31,167
- He forgot the incident.
- He didn't deny it.

1779
01:51:31,168 --> 01:51:33,169
That's a non-denial denial.

1780
01:51:33,170 --> 01:51:36,631
- Wichita, Kansas?
- Yeah, he said, "That's a bullshit question."

1781
01:51:36,632 --> 01:51:39,217
I know what he said,
but I'm from Wheaton, Illinois.

1782
01:51:39,218 --> 01:51:41,010
Hey, Bob, Carl, he's on the phone.

1783
01:51:41,011 --> 01:51:43,063
- Who?
- Clawson.

1784
01:51:45,724 --> 01:51:48,601
- What line?
- Get on Line 4 and transcribe this, will you?

1785
01:51:48,602 --> 01:51:50,687
- Four.
- Wait.

1786
01:51:50,688 --> 01:51:53,868
- Four?
- Okay? Yeah.

1787
01:51:54,191 --> 01:51:55,400
Yes, Ken?

1788
01:51:55,401 --> 01:51:58,528
Sally, for chrissakes,
don't tell them I came to your place.

1789
01:51:58,529 --> 01:52:01,114
Why not?
What's wrong with coming over for a drink?

1790
01:52:01,115 --> 01:52:04,409
You and me, in your apartment?

1791
01:52:04,410 --> 01:52:06,255
Well?

1792
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:08,913
Jesus Christ, you just shot me down.

1793
01:52:08,914 --> 01:52:13,334
If that appears in the papers,
that I'm over at your house having a....

1794
01:52:13,335 --> 01:52:16,212
- Well, do you know what that does?
- Well, I don't see why.

1795
01:52:16,213 --> 01:52:19,465
You don't? You don't?

1796
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:23,094
- But there's nothing bad about it.
- Well, there sure is.

1797
01:52:23,095 --> 01:52:27,765
Jesus Christ. This is just incredible.

1798
01:52:27,766 --> 01:52:29,392
Well, I have a clear conscience.

1799
01:52:29,393 --> 01:52:34,163
Sally, I have a wife and a family
and a dog and a cat.

1800
01:52:34,189 --> 01:52:36,357
She said he was in her house
having a drink.

1801
01:52:36,358 --> 01:52:38,901
I don't care where it happened.
What happened is what counts.

1802
01:52:38,902 --> 01:52:40,297
When we asked him about it...

1803
01:52:41,405 --> 01:52:43,031
...he said he forgot the entire incident.

1804
01:52:43,032 --> 01:52:45,158
- Yeah?
- Ken Clawson on the line.

1805
01:52:45,159 --> 01:52:49,261
- Ken Clawson on the line.
- Jesus.

1806
01:52:50,706 --> 01:52:52,457
Ken. What's up, kid?

1807
01:52:52,458 --> 01:52:55,501
Ben, now, look, this whole thing
that's going on over there...

1808
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:59,005
...I want you to know I never
claimed authorship of the "Canuck" letter.

1809
01:52:59,006 --> 01:53:02,050
- Says he never wrote the letter.
- It's some misunderstanding...

1810
01:53:02,051 --> 01:53:05,178
Ken, Ken. Slow, slow, slow down, Ken.
You sound frazzled.

1811
01:53:05,179 --> 01:53:07,305
No, Ben, please listen.

1812
01:53:07,306 --> 01:53:10,308
Now, if you're going to refer
to that alleged conversation...

1813
01:53:10,309 --> 01:53:13,853
...with Sally Aiken, you can't print
that it took place in her apartment.

1814
01:53:13,854 --> 01:53:16,647
I have a wife and a family
and a dog and a cat.

1815
01:53:16,648 --> 01:53:21,402
A wife and a family and a dog and a cat.
Right, Ken, right. Yeah.

1816
01:53:21,403 --> 01:53:24,572
Ken, I don't wanna print
that you were in Sally's apartment.

1817
01:53:24,573 --> 01:53:25,782
Oh, thank God.

1818
01:53:25,783 --> 01:53:30,453
I just wanna know what you said
in Sally's apartment.

1819
01:53:42,049 --> 01:53:43,257
Hello?

1820
01:53:43,258 --> 01:53:47,136
I just got a tip from our FBI source.
The secret cash fund financed Segretti.

1821
01:53:47,137 --> 01:53:48,971
- Jesus.
- All right, now, listen.

1822
01:53:48,972 --> 01:53:52,517
Chapin hired Segretti, we know that.
And we know Haldeman hired Chapin.

1823
01:53:52,518 --> 01:53:55,800
Haldeman has to be the fifth name
to control the fund.

1824
01:53:56,105 --> 01:53:58,463
Sloan knows.

1825
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:02,652
We've only got four of the five
who controlled the fund.

1826
01:54:02,653 --> 01:54:06,448
- It has to be Haldeman.
- I don't think we've got it.

1827
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:08,866
We know the fifth
is a top White House official.

1828
01:54:08,867 --> 01:54:11,202
- No one has said it.
- No one's denied it.

1829
01:54:11,203 --> 01:54:14,998
That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman.

1830
01:54:16,708 --> 01:54:20,253
If you go to bed and there's no snow,
and you wake up and there's snow...

1831
01:54:20,254 --> 01:54:22,839
...you can say it snowed,
although you didn't see it.

1832
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,675
If we can't prove the fifth is Haldeman,
we're wiped out.

1833
01:54:25,676 --> 01:54:28,344
Everything in that campaign
is done with his approval.

1834
01:54:28,345 --> 01:54:31,681
Everybody who works under Haldeman
does so with his knowledge.

1835
01:54:31,682 --> 01:54:34,100
Everybody is under Haldeman
except the president.

1836
01:54:34,101 --> 01:54:36,459
Common sense says it's Haldeman.

1837
01:54:38,522 --> 01:54:42,024
If we go and see Sloan,
and we tell him that we know...

1838
01:54:42,025 --> 01:54:46,795
...that he named Haldeman
to the grand jury....

1839
01:54:46,822 --> 01:54:49,365
Then all we would need to do
is have him confirm it.

1840
01:54:49,366 --> 01:54:50,950
Right.

1841
01:54:50,951 --> 01:54:54,287
- Wanna do it that way?
- Yes.

1842
01:54:54,288 --> 01:54:57,057
Let's go back and see Sloan.

1843
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:02,473
We can't go now,
because he's not home yet.

1844
01:55:02,713 --> 01:55:06,405
He might not be answering,
but he might be there.

1845
01:55:20,397 --> 01:55:21,564
Hi. SLOAN: Please.

1846
01:55:21,565 --> 01:55:24,567
We've already written the story.
We just need you to define...

1847
01:55:24,568 --> 01:55:26,777
Debbie's in the hospital
and my in-laws are...

1848
01:55:26,778 --> 01:55:28,362
- Two questions?
- We understand.

1849
01:55:28,363 --> 01:55:30,363
Two questions?

1850
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:35,786
The cash that financed
the Watergate break-in.

1851
01:55:35,787 --> 01:55:37,580
Five men had control of the fund.

1852
01:55:37,581 --> 01:55:41,125
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach.
We have confirmations on those four.

1853
01:55:41,126 --> 01:55:43,920
- We found out Haldeman's the fifth.
- I'm not your source.

1854
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:47,590
- All we're asking you to do is confirm.
- I'm not your source on Haldeman.

1855
01:55:47,591 --> 01:55:49,926
When you were questioned
by the grand jury...

1856
01:55:49,927 --> 01:55:51,093
You had to name names.

1857
01:55:51,094 --> 01:55:54,018
- Of course, everything they asked.
- All right.

1858
01:55:54,389 --> 01:55:56,441
Well, uh....

1859
01:55:57,392 --> 01:55:58,601
What do you think?

1860
01:55:58,602 --> 01:56:02,230
Say we wrote a story that said Haldeman
was the fifth to control the fund.

1861
01:56:02,231 --> 01:56:05,409
- Would we be in any trouble?
- Would we be wrong?

1862
01:56:08,654 --> 01:56:10,780
Let me put it this way.

1863
01:56:10,781 --> 01:56:14,158
I would have no problems
if you wrote a story like that.

1864
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:17,390
- You wouldn't?
- No.

1865
01:56:17,538 --> 01:56:20,289
- That's okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

1866
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:22,708
- Oh, you had a baby.
- Yeah. My wife did.

1867
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:24,627
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- It's a girl.

1868
01:56:24,628 --> 01:56:26,087
- Congratulations.
- Oh, great.

1869
01:56:26,088 --> 01:56:27,296
Thank you.

1870
01:56:27,297 --> 01:56:29,048
- Sorry to have bothered you.
- Yeah.

1871
01:56:29,049 --> 01:56:31,818
- Will you give our best to her?
- I will.

1872
01:56:34,763 --> 01:56:36,722
Well, I think that Woodward's just...

1873
01:56:36,723 --> 01:56:40,268
And I am curious of the fact
that the FBI, in its entire inquiry...

1874
01:56:40,269 --> 01:56:44,480
...never talked to or did inquiries into the
second most powerful man to the president.

1875
01:56:44,481 --> 01:56:46,232
You don't seem to understand.

1876
01:56:46,233 --> 01:56:49,151
No, you get nothing
about Haldeman out of me.

1877
01:56:49,152 --> 01:56:51,153
But we don't need
to know anything, Joe.

1878
01:56:51,154 --> 01:56:53,406
Tomorrow we're going with a story
on the FBI.

1879
01:56:53,407 --> 01:56:56,492
- What does that mean?
- We're going to establish in that story...

1880
01:56:56,493 --> 01:56:59,328
...that you guys just about
blew the whole investigation.

1881
01:56:59,329 --> 01:57:00,955
Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.

1882
01:57:00,956 --> 01:57:03,374
You didn't know Haldeman
had control of the fund.

1883
01:57:03,375 --> 01:57:04,750
It's all in our files.

1884
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:07,336
- Not about Haldeman.
- Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.

1885
01:57:07,337 --> 01:57:10,895
Look. Now, look, I'm very busy. I gotta go.
I gotta go put the kids to bed.

1886
01:57:12,884 --> 01:57:16,470
That's the confirmation right there.

1887
01:57:16,471 --> 01:57:19,515
Wait a minute, wait a second.
Did he say John?

1888
01:57:19,516 --> 01:57:21,559
- He said Haldeman.
- He said John Haldeman.

1889
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:24,353
What difference does it make
if he said Isaiah or David?

1890
01:57:24,354 --> 01:57:25,771
There's only one Haldeman.

1891
01:57:25,772 --> 01:57:29,358
Well, Isaiah or David aren't assistant
to the president.

1892
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:31,152
I don't know, it still feels thin.

1893
01:57:31,153 --> 01:57:34,196
- Christ, I wish I knew if we could print this.
- Wait a minute.

1894
01:57:34,197 --> 01:57:37,617
We didn't make them do these things.
Once they did, they're fair game.

1895
01:57:37,618 --> 01:57:39,493
Let's go over your sources again.

1896
01:57:39,494 --> 01:57:42,872
Sloan told the grand jury.
He answered everything they asked him.

1897
01:57:42,873 --> 01:57:45,166
That means there's gotta be
a record somewhere.

1898
01:57:45,167 --> 01:57:48,294
He told the grand jury,
the FBI confirms. What more do you need?

1899
01:57:48,295 --> 01:57:49,879
I happen to love this country.

1900
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:53,633
- We're not zanies out to bring it down.
- Weren't you arguing the opposite?

1901
01:57:53,634 --> 01:57:55,593
- No, no, not at all.
- I can't believe it.

1902
01:57:55,594 --> 01:57:56,844
Now, hold it. Hold it.

1903
01:57:56,845 --> 01:57:58,721
One has nothing to do with the other.

1904
01:57:58,722 --> 01:58:00,431
We're about to accuse Haldeman...

1905
01:58:00,432 --> 01:58:02,933
...the second most important man
in this country...

1906
01:58:02,934 --> 01:58:05,811
...of conducting a conspiracy
from inside the White House.

1907
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:07,563
It would be nice if we were right.

1908
01:58:07,564 --> 01:58:09,940
- You double-checked your sources?
- Jesus.

1909
01:58:09,941 --> 01:58:12,693
- Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
- Absolutely.

1910
01:58:12,694 --> 01:58:14,987
- Woodward?
- I'm sure.

1911
01:58:14,988 --> 01:58:17,782
I'm not. Still seems thin.

1912
01:58:17,783 --> 01:58:19,033
Get another source.

1913
01:58:19,034 --> 01:58:22,675
How many fucking sources
do they think we've got?

1914
01:58:25,791 --> 01:58:29,293
- Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
- He won't confirm, I told you.

1915
01:58:29,294 --> 01:58:31,337
- The guy in Justice?
- Can't call him.

1916
01:58:31,338 --> 01:58:33,756
- He's next to the grand jury.
- We have no choice.

1917
01:58:33,757 --> 01:58:35,216
Twenty minutes to deadline.

1918
01:58:35,217 --> 01:58:38,191
I don't even know
if I can get him on the phone.

1919
01:58:53,402 --> 01:58:57,187
- Dr. Kissinger's office.
- Deputy general's office, please.

1920
01:59:00,492 --> 01:59:04,161
- Do you know when you expect him back?
- I believe he's left for the evening.

1921
01:59:04,162 --> 01:59:07,623
If you'd like to leave a message,
could you hold, please?

1922
01:59:07,624 --> 01:59:10,209
Hi, this is Carl.
I'm sorry to disturb you now.

1923
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:13,963
We're going with the story that Haldeman
was the fifth in control of the fund.

1924
01:59:13,964 --> 01:59:17,508
We got three confirmations.
If you could just help us, I'd appreciate it.

1925
01:59:17,509 --> 01:59:19,468
I won't say anything about Haldeman.

1926
01:59:19,469 --> 01:59:22,722
I understand. We know it's against the law
for you to say anything.

1927
01:59:22,723 --> 01:59:25,766
If you could warn us to hold on the story,
we'd appreciate it.

1928
01:59:25,767 --> 01:59:28,310
I'd really like to help you, but I can't.

1929
01:59:28,311 --> 01:59:31,188
Look, I'm gonna count to 10, all right?

1930
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:34,984
If there's any reason we should hold
on the story, hang up before I get to 10.

1931
01:59:34,985 --> 01:59:38,738
If the story's all right, you'll be on
the phone after I get to 10, all right?

1932
01:59:38,739 --> 01:59:40,489
- Hang up, right?
- That's right.

1933
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:41,699
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1934
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:44,994
We're straight? All right.
I'm gonna start counting. Okay?

1935
01:59:44,995 --> 01:59:46,245
- We all right?
- Yeah.

1936
01:59:46,246 --> 01:59:47,455
Okay, I'm counting.

1937
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:51,250
One, two, three...

1938
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:55,463
...four, five, six...

1939
01:59:55,464 --> 02:00:00,264
...seven, eight, nine...

1940
02:00:00,635 --> 02:00:02,533
...10.

1941
02:00:03,138 --> 02:00:04,889
You got it straight now?

1942
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:09,455
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

1943
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:14,082
Woodward!

1944
02:00:18,153 --> 02:00:20,255
We got it.

1945
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:23,240
- He confirmed.
- What happened?

1946
02:00:23,241 --> 02:00:26,118
I said, "If I get to 10
and you don't hang up, it's solid."

1947
02:00:26,119 --> 02:00:27,369
- He confirm?
- Absolutely.

1948
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:29,472
We gotta tell Bradlee.

1949
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:33,802
The New York Times
had three columns on it.

1950
02:00:37,923 --> 02:00:41,884
Bernstein got another source.
The guy at Justice confirmed.

1951
02:00:41,885 --> 02:00:45,721
- If there's doubt, we can run it tomorrow.
- The story's solid. We're sure of it.

1952
02:00:45,722 --> 02:00:48,696
I just got off the phone with him.
It's gold.

1953
02:00:49,976 --> 02:00:52,541
Okay, we go with it.

1954
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:07,452
Woodstein!

1955
02:01:21,675 --> 02:01:24,444
- You know what it's about?
- No.

1956
02:01:24,928 --> 02:01:27,096
Sloan, who resigned as campaign treasurer...

1957
02:01:27,097 --> 02:01:28,639
...after the Watergate break-in...

1958
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:33,440
...showed up for a deposition in the suit
on disclosure of campaign contributions...

1959
02:01:33,687 --> 02:01:35,646
...and denied naming Haldeman.

1960
02:01:35,647 --> 02:01:38,482
Would you comment
on your testimony before the grand jury?

1961
02:01:38,483 --> 02:01:42,319
- I'd like my attorney to answer that.
- The answer is an unequivocal no.

1962
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:45,614
Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman
in that testimony at all.

1963
02:01:45,615 --> 02:01:48,576
Did Mr. Sloan acknowledge
that it was an espionage fund?

1964
02:01:48,577 --> 02:01:49,785
No, not at all.

1965
02:01:49,786 --> 02:01:52,288
Did he mention use of funds
for espionage activity?

1966
02:01:52,289 --> 02:01:54,248
None whatsoever. Thank you, gentlemen.

1967
02:01:54,249 --> 02:01:57,459
Sloan expanded his denial
to include his statements to the FBI...

1968
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:59,211
...and to all federal authorities.

1969
02:01:59,212 --> 02:02:00,713
Later, at the White House...

1970
02:02:00,714 --> 02:02:03,674
...News Secretary Ronald Ziegler
delivered a strong attack...

1971
02:02:03,675 --> 02:02:05,259
...on the Washington Post.

1972
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:07,636
Why is the Post trying to do it?

1973
02:02:07,637 --> 02:02:09,471
You have a man...

1974
02:02:09,472 --> 02:02:13,309
...who's the editor of the Washington Post
by the name of Ben Bradlee.

1975
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:18,110
I think anyone who were to honestly assess
what his political persuasions are...

1976
02:02:18,523 --> 02:02:22,484
...would, I think,
come to the conclusion quite quickly...

1977
02:02:22,485 --> 02:02:25,487
...that he is not a supporter
of President Nixon.

1978
02:02:25,488 --> 02:02:27,281
I respect the free press.

1979
02:02:27,282 --> 02:02:30,701
I don't respect the type of journalism...

1980
02:02:30,702 --> 02:02:33,245
The shabby journalism
that is being practiced...

1981
02:02:33,246 --> 02:02:34,622
...by the Washington Post.

1982
02:02:34,623 --> 02:02:39,423
All I know is that the story
that ran this morning is incorrect...

1983
02:02:39,628 --> 02:02:44,428
...and has been so stated
as being incorrect...

1984
02:02:44,507 --> 02:02:48,594
...by not only me, but by the individual
whose grand-jury...

1985
02:02:48,595 --> 02:02:52,348
Secret grand-jury testimony
they based their story on.

1986
02:02:52,349 --> 02:02:56,727
And that individual has denied
that he ever so testified.

1987
02:02:56,728 --> 02:02:58,437
No sooner had Ziegler finished...

1988
02:02:58,438 --> 02:03:02,191
...than the president's campaign manager,
Clark MacGregor, met with reporters.

1989
02:03:02,192 --> 02:03:05,527
MacGREGOR:
Using innuendo, third-person hearsay...

1990
02:03:05,528 --> 02:03:09,156
...unsubstantiated charges,
anonymous sources...

1991
02:03:09,157 --> 02:03:11,325
...and huge scare headlines...

1992
02:03:11,326 --> 02:03:14,453
...the Post has maliciously sought
to give the appearance...

1993
02:03:14,454 --> 02:03:17,873
...of a direct connection between
the White House and the Watergate...

1994
02:03:17,874 --> 02:03:19,833
...a charge which the Post knows...

1995
02:03:19,834 --> 02:03:23,879
...and half a dozen investigations
have found, to be false.

1996
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:27,758
The hallmark of the Post's campaign
is hypocrisy...

1997
02:03:27,759 --> 02:03:32,388
...and its celebrated double standard
is today visible for all to see.

1998
02:03:32,389 --> 02:03:34,890
- What do you mean?
- I'm not talking about Haldeman.

1999
02:03:34,891 --> 02:03:36,266
- What went wrong?
- Nothing.

2000
02:03:36,267 --> 02:03:37,559
Tell us what went wrong.

2001
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:40,646
Didn't you say the FBI had information
on Haldeman in the files?

2002
02:03:40,647 --> 02:03:43,941
We have it in the notes from
the conversation with you on the phone.

2003
02:03:43,942 --> 02:03:46,568
We have to go talk to your boss
if you don't talk.

2004
02:03:46,569 --> 02:03:49,405
What the hell are you talking about?
I'll deny everything.

2005
02:03:49,406 --> 02:03:52,741
We're just trying to find out
if we made some errors.

2006
02:03:52,742 --> 02:03:55,035
If we made a mistake,
we'll come off the story.

2007
02:03:55,036 --> 02:03:56,537
Just tell us if we're wrong.

2008
02:03:56,538 --> 02:03:59,373
Tell us if we screwed up.
Tell us if it's wrong. Tell us...

2009
02:03:59,374 --> 02:04:00,916
I'm not talking about it.

2010
02:04:00,917 --> 02:04:04,211
I am not talking to you about Haldeman
or anybody else.

2011
02:04:04,212 --> 02:04:06,839
I can't even be seen talking
to either one of you bastards.

2012
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,757
What are you afraid of?
Who got to you?

2013
02:04:08,758 --> 02:04:10,912
Are we being set up?

2014
02:04:11,302 --> 02:04:13,345
- Are we? Tell us.
- Are we being set up?

2015
02:04:13,346 --> 02:04:18,146
- Just tell us, we won't say anything.
- Fuck you. And fuck you.

2016
02:04:24,149 --> 02:04:26,150
Honest to God, I just don't understand.

2017
02:04:26,151 --> 02:04:28,277
It's in the notes.

2018
02:04:28,278 --> 02:04:32,072
"Yeah, we had another call all along.
I've got another call. I've gotta go."

2019
02:04:32,073 --> 02:04:35,356
"Did you mean Bob Haldeman?"
"Yeah, Bob Haldeman."

2020
02:04:37,287 --> 02:04:39,337
Jesus, what was our mistake?

2021
02:04:39,956 --> 02:04:42,124
Maybe there was no mistake.

2022
02:04:42,125 --> 02:04:46,925
Then they're just setting us up.
Then the whole thing was a setup.

2023
02:04:47,839 --> 02:04:50,146
And they just hung us.

2024
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:53,469
More denunciations.
Gonna have to make a statement, Ben.

2025
02:04:53,470 --> 02:04:57,473
One senator just gave a speech
slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.

2026
02:04:57,474 --> 02:05:01,435
I knew we had enemies,
but I didn't know we were this popular.

2027
02:05:01,436 --> 02:05:04,256
Wow, look at this.

2028
02:05:05,482 --> 02:05:08,507
My non-denial denial.

2029
02:05:16,326 --> 02:05:18,582
Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.

2030
02:05:19,329 --> 02:05:22,289
Okay. Foreign?

2031
02:05:22,290 --> 02:05:24,374
All right, here's our headline.

2032
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:27,711
Radio Hanoi reports the
United States-North Vietnam agreement...

2033
02:05:27,712 --> 02:05:30,297
...for a settlement of the Vietnam War.

2034
02:05:31,308 --> 02:05:34,134
Artie was just saying,
in the few seconds we have left...

2035
02:05:34,135 --> 02:05:37,501
...just saying that vibrato sound
that she had then, she still has now.

2036
02:05:38,306 --> 02:05:40,891
Woodward, what did you find out?
What did he say?

2037
02:05:40,892 --> 02:05:43,102
- What time is it?
- You fell asleep?

2038
02:05:43,103 --> 02:05:45,666
Oh, goddamn it.

2039
02:07:08,938 --> 02:07:10,990
Over here.

2040
02:07:33,796 --> 02:07:36,798
- You let Haldeman slip away.
- Yes.

2041
02:07:36,799 --> 02:07:39,051
You've done worse
than let Haldeman slip away.

2042
02:07:39,052 --> 02:07:43,096
You got people feeling sorry for him.
I didn't think that was possible.

2043
02:07:43,097 --> 02:07:44,973
In a conspiracy like this...

2044
02:07:44,974 --> 02:07:48,602
...you build from the outer edges
and you go step by step.

2045
02:07:48,603 --> 02:07:52,449
If you shoot too high and miss,
everybody feels more secure.

2046
02:07:52,607 --> 02:07:56,693
- You put the investigation back months.
- Yes, we know that.

2047
02:07:56,694 --> 02:07:59,925
And if we're wrong, we're resigning.

2048
02:08:00,573 --> 02:08:02,316
Were we wrong?

2049
02:08:04,494 --> 02:08:09,294
- You'll have to find that out, won't you?
- I'm tired of your chicken-shit games.

2050
02:08:10,667 --> 02:08:12,834
I don't want hints.

2051
02:08:12,835 --> 02:08:15,092
I need to know what you know.

2052
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:34,507
It was a Haldeman operation.

2053
02:08:34,565 --> 02:08:38,777
The whole business was run by Haldeman,
the money, everything.

2054
02:08:38,778 --> 02:08:41,280
It won't be easy getting at him.
He was insulated.

2055
02:08:41,281 --> 02:08:43,434
You'll have to find out how.

2056
02:08:46,995 --> 02:08:50,205
Mitchell started doing covert stuff
before anyone else.

2057
02:08:50,206 --> 02:08:54,411
The list is longer
than anyone can imagine.

2058
02:08:55,461 --> 02:09:00,261
It involves the entire
U.S. intelligence community.

2059
02:09:00,925 --> 02:09:02,309
FBI...

2060
02:09:03,261 --> 02:09:05,554
...CIA, Justice.

2061
02:09:05,555 --> 02:09:07,605
It's incredible.

2062
02:09:09,475 --> 02:09:11,727
The cover-up had little to do
with Watergate.

2063
02:09:11,728 --> 02:09:16,528
It was mainly
to protect the covert operations.

2064
02:09:17,025 --> 02:09:19,331
It leads everywhere.

2065
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:25,825
Get out your notebook. There's more.

2066
02:09:30,705 --> 02:09:34,090
Your lives are in danger.

2067
02:09:34,292 --> 02:09:37,831
Hi. I finally got Sloan on the phone.

2068
02:10:56,958 --> 02:10:59,000
Why couldn't you tell me over the phone?

2069
02:10:59,001 --> 02:11:01,002
- Phones aren't safe.
- Can't trust them.

2070
02:11:01,003 --> 02:11:02,879
- Come on in.
- We can't come in, sir.

2071
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:05,896
Woodward says
there's electronic surveillance.

2072
02:11:22,525 --> 02:11:24,901
- Surveillance? Who's doing it?
- It's being done.

2073
02:11:24,902 --> 02:11:26,778
- People's lives are in danger.
- Wait.

2074
02:11:26,779 --> 02:11:29,531
- Maybe even ours.
- What happened to that Justice source?

2075
02:11:29,532 --> 02:11:31,575
I made the instructions too complicated.

2076
02:11:31,576 --> 02:11:33,869
He thought I said "hang up,"
I said "hang on."

2077
02:11:33,870 --> 02:11:35,871
- Jesus Christ.
- The story is right.

2078
02:11:35,872 --> 02:11:38,206
Haldeman was the fifth man
to control that fund.

2079
02:11:38,207 --> 02:11:40,876
- Sloan would've told the grand jury.
- Sloan wanted to.

2080
02:11:40,877 --> 02:11:43,362
- Why didn't he?
- Because nobody asked.

2081
02:11:43,796 --> 02:11:46,173
The cover-up had little to do
with the break-in.

2082
02:11:46,174 --> 02:11:48,300
It was to protect covert operations...

2083
02:11:48,301 --> 02:11:50,886
...involving the entire
U.S. intelligence community.

2084
02:11:50,887 --> 02:11:53,555
Did Deep Throat say
that people's lives are in danger?

2085
02:11:53,556 --> 02:11:57,017
- Yes.
- What else did he say?

2086
02:11:57,018 --> 02:11:59,992
He said everyone is involved.

2087
02:12:06,486 --> 02:12:09,237
You know the results
of the latest Gallup poll?

2088
02:12:09,238 --> 02:12:12,073
Half the country never even heard
of the word "Watergate."

2089
02:12:12,074 --> 02:12:14,535
Nobody gives a shit.

2090
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:19,088
You guys are probably pretty tired, right?

2091
02:12:19,373 --> 02:12:22,292
Well, you should be. Go on home.

2092
02:12:22,293 --> 02:12:25,587
Get a nice hot bath, rest up 15 minutes...

2093
02:12:25,588 --> 02:12:28,423
...then get your asses back in gear.

2094
02:12:28,424 --> 02:12:32,527
We're under a lot of pressure, you know,
and you put us there.

2095
02:12:33,596 --> 02:12:35,013
Nothing's riding on this...

2096
02:12:35,014 --> 02:12:38,183
...except the First Amendment
of the Constitution...

2097
02:12:38,184 --> 02:12:42,984
...freedom of the press,
and maybe the future of the country.

2098
02:12:43,940 --> 02:12:46,274
Not that any of that matters...

2099
02:12:46,275 --> 02:12:50,737
...but if you guys fuck up again,
I'm gonna get mad.

2100
02:12:51,697 --> 02:12:53,645
Good night.

2101
02:13:20,677 --> 02:13:22,710
Now, fellow Americans...

2102
02:13:22,711 --> 02:13:27,111
...the honorable chief justice
will administer the oath of office...

2103
02:13:27,942 --> 02:13:31,152
...to the president
of the United States of America.

2104
02:13:31,153 --> 02:13:33,488
Mr. Chief Justice.

2105
02:13:54,844 --> 02:13:59,097
Mr. President, are you ready
to take the constitutional oath?

2106
02:13:59,098 --> 02:14:03,518
If you will place your left hand
on the Bible and raise your right hand...

2107
02:14:03,519 --> 02:14:05,270
...and please repeat after me:

2108
02:14:05,271 --> 02:14:08,565
I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...

2109
02:14:08,566 --> 02:14:10,942
I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...

2110
02:14:10,943 --> 02:14:15,543
...that I will faithfully execute
the office of president of the United States...

2111
02:14:15,665 --> 02:14:19,801
