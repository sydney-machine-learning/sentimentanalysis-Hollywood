and listen to me.

see them over and over again.

MAN: Just six years ago,
the homicide rate in this country

192
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,610
had reached epidemic proportions.

193
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,738
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

194
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,326
But instead of one miracle,
we were given three, the Precognitives.

195
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,246
Within just one month
under the Precrime program,

196
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,041
the murder rate in the
District of Columbia was reduced 90%.

197
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,501
They were gonna be waiting for me
in the car.

198
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,586
He was gonna rape me.

199

- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.

200
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:27,217
Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation's capital.

In the six years we've been conducting
our little experiment,

202
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,015

on whether or not
what we've been doing down here

has been
some noble-minded enterprise,

278

- John.

Since each piece is unique,
the shape and grain is unique.

The shape and grain
is impossible to forge.

We are arresting individuals
who have broken no law.

- But they will.
- The commission of the crime itself

295
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,306
is absolute metaphysics.

296
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,517
The Precogs seethe future,
and they're never wrong.

297

Yes, it is.

299
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,818
You're talking about predetermination,

300
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,033

- You're certain?
- Yeah.

But it didn't fall. You caught it.

The fact that
you prevented it from happening

304
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,125
doesn't change the fact
that it was going to happen.

00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,595
- Wally.
- (SOFTLY) No, no, no, no.

338
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,013
It's okay. This is Danny Witwer.

339
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,265
He's from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

340
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,349
I can't touch you.

341
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,602
- Don't touch him or anything else.
- John, you can't be in here...

342
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,771
I understand. Just answer his questions
and we'll get the hell out of here.

343
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,856
Tell me how...

344
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,982
(SHUSHING)

345
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,944
- They're sleeping.
- Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

346
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,740
The photon milk acts as both
a nutrient supply and a liquid conductor.

347
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,451
It enhances the images
that each of them receive.

348
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,246
We call the female Agatha.
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.

349
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,374
We scan by way of optical tomography.

350
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,211
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the entire length of the headgear,

351
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,756
and they're reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

352
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,926
In other words, we see what they see.

353
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,511
They don't feel any pain.

354
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,264
We keep their heads pretty well stocked
with dopamine and endorphins.

355
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,185
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

356
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,979
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

357
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,940
They can't be kept too awake, either.

358
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,151
It's better if
you don't think of them as human.

359
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,987
No. They're much more than that.

360
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,785
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

361
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,041
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

362
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,045
I find it interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Precogs.

363
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,256
The Precogs are
pattern-recognition filters, that's all.

364
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,759
- Yet you call this room "the temple."
- Just a nickname.

365
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,053
The oracle isn't
where the power is, anyway.

366
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,763
The power's always been
with the priests,

367
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,516
even if they had to invent the oracle.

368
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,479
You guys are nodding like you actually
know what the hell he's talking about.

369
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,066
Well, come on, Chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all,

370
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,278
I mean,
we're more like clergy than cops.

371
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,113
- Jad?
- Yeah?

372
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,782
Go to work. All of you.

373
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,210
Sorry. Old habit.

374
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,714
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

375
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,549
My father was very proud.

376
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,426
What does he think
of your chosen line of work?

377
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,594
I don't know.
He was shot and killed when I was 15

378
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,264
on the steps of our church in Dublin.

379
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,058
I know what it's like
to lose someone close, John.

380
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,394
Of course,
nothing is like the loss of a child.

381
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,687
I don't have any children of my own,

382
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,107
so I can only imagine
what that must have been like.

383
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,652
To lose your son
in such a public place like that.

384
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,529
At least now you and I have
the chance to make sure

385
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,156
that kind of thing
doesn't happen to anyone.

386
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,907
Why don't you cut the cute act,
Danny Boy, and tell me

387
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,493
- exactly what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

388
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,661
There hasn't been a murder in six years.

389
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,330
There's nothing wrong with the system.
It is...

390
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,250
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

391
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,003
It always is.

392
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,464
John.

393
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,005
(SNAPPING FINGERS)

394
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,966
Wally.

395
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,934
Can you see?

396
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,885
John, what the hell just happened?

397
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,512
Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

398
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,764
- What did you do to her?
- She grabbed me.

399
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,183
Grabbed you? That's impossible.
The Precogs aren't even aware of us.

400
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,019
- In the milk, all they see is the future.
- She looked straight at me.

401
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,146
It could have been a nightmare.

402
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,106
Sometimes they dream
about the old murders.

403
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,191
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

404
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,529
- What'd she say?
- "Can you see?"

405
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,327
(ORGAN PLAYING)

406

00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,719
You the Sentry?

Yes, sir! I'm Gideon.

409
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,725
You're Chief Anderton.

410
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,603
The music relaxes the prisoners.

411
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,730
Say, I don't ever see
any of you Precops down here.

412
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,566
- I'm not in trouble, am I?
- Not yet.

413
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,154
- I'm interested in a murder.
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?

414
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,740
- Drowning.
- That narrows it down.

415
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,366
Not too many in here for that one.

416
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:31,120
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

417
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,956
I'm supposed to spruce up
for a tour they got planned for tomorrow.

418
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,791
Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?

419
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,959
Stop.

420
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,923
Roll back.

421
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,009
There.

422
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,764
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

423
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,309
This is the official composite
of the three Precogs?

424
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:58,773
That's right! A combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

425
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,983
Just show me Agatha's data stream.

426
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,318
For that,

427
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,780
we go for a ride.

I'd forgotten there were so many.

there killing people if it wasn't for you.

430
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,565
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they all seem.

431
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,943
But on the inside, busy, busy, busy.

432
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,990
Okey-pokey! Now that is one bad man.

433
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,785
He drowned a woman
named Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

434
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,122
The killer's a John Doe.
Never identified.

435
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,307
Why is he still a John Doe?

436
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,475
Why wasn't he ever ID'd
from the eye-scan?

437
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,603
On account of those are not his eyes.

438
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,564
He had them swapped out
to fool the scanners.

439
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,610
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

440
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,655
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

441
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,198
That's right.

We don't seem to have her data.

444

Try again.

445
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,547
This is odd.

446
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,301
See? We have the two previsions.

447
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,429
We got what Art saw,
we got what Dash saw,

448
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,473
but Agatha's isn't here.

449
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,394
Probably just a glitch.

450
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,773
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

451
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,153
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here,

452
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,573
but I show an address history
that includes the Beaton Clinic.

453
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,242
So she cleaned up.
So where's she now?

454
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,747
I guess glitches come in twos.

455
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:26,337
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

456

out of here, Chief.

It's against the rules.

459
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,270
Anything else going on in here
that's against the rules?

460
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:53,322
Careful, Chief.
You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.

461
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,872
And then you said the third prevision
was, what, kind of fuzzy or something?

462
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:06,127
No. No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

463
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,045
That's not all.
I spent a few hours down there,

464
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,048
and there are a dozen more cases
with missing previsions.

I hate herbal tea,
almost as much as I hate honey.

Just drink it before I pour it in your lap.

- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you, Celeste.

Tour of Containment tomorrow.

473
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,198
Yeah, give him a tour.

- Lara called me.
- What?

475
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:43,289
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

476
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,083
I'm fine.

477
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,837
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the sprawl.

478
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,341
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night?

479
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,719
What if Danny Witwer
came to you right now

480
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,264
- and insisted on a full chem run?
- Lamar, I'm fine.

481
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,475
You understand, John,

482
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,978
the minute Precrime goes national,
they're going to take it away from us.

483
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,313
We won't let them.

484
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,984
No? How's an old man and a cop
on the whiff ever going to stop them?

485
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,821
My father once said to me,

486
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,034
"You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you."

487
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,328
There's a reason you are here, John.

488
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,872
Had Precrime been in place
just six months earlier,

489
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,375
the loss you and Lara suffered
would have been prevented.

are on us right now.

But people trust you, John.

When you speak
of your absolute belief in Precrime,

496
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,646
they know it's a belief born of pain,
not politics. I always understood that.

497
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,316
And I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

498
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,030
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.

499
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,704

at the Woodhaven Clinic,

725
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,336
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

726
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,965
It was an impure form of the drug,
not the engineered cocktail

727
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,427
that became so popular
among the more educated.

728
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,264
All of these kids were born
with severe brain damage.

729
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,017
Most died before the age of 12.

730
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,103
Those few, those precious few
who survived, they had a gift.

731
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:47,690
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

732
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,443
They would wake up in the night,
curled up in the corner of their rooms,

733
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,361
screaming, clawing at the wallpaper.

734
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:56,866
Because when these little children,
you see, closed their eyes at night,

735
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,746
they dreamt only of murder,
over and over, one after the other.

736
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,082
And it didn't take long for us to
realize that the real nightmare

737
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:08,294
was tha tthese so-called dreams
were about to come true.

738
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,963
These murders
were actually happening.

739
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:17,094
You say some of the children died.

740
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,431
So many of them,
despite what we did for them.

741
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:24,894
Or maybe because of what we did
to them. But it doesn't matter.

742
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,521
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

743
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,400
I'm not going to commit murder.

744
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,694
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

745
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,696
And yet a chain of events has started,

746
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,241
a chain that will lead you inexorably
to his murder.

747
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,408
Not if I stay away from him.

748
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,910
How can you avoid a man
you've never met?

749
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,078
So you won't help me?

750
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:46,999
I can't help you. Nobody can.
The Precogs are never wrong.

752
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,173
they do disagree.

00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,051
What?

754
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:02,098
Most of the time, all three Precognitives
will see an event in the same way,

755
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:06,143
but once in a while, one of them will
seething differently than the other two.

Why didn't I know about this?

757
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,610
Because these minority reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

758
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:15,945
Why?

759
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,197
Obviously, for Precrime to function,

760
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,783
there can't be
any suggestion of fallibility.

761
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,245
After all, who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

762
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,206
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

763
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,460
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

764
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,339
I'm saying that every so often
those accused of a Precrime

765
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,342
might, just might,
have an alternate future.

766
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:42,888
Does Burgess know about this?
About this minority report?

767
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,267
I used to joke with Lamar that we were
the mother and father of Precrime.

768
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,061
Well, in my experience,
parents very often see their children

769
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,022
as they want them to be, not as they are.

770
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,606
Answer my question.

771
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,444
Does Lamar Burgess know
about the minority report?

772
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,612
Yes, of course, he knew.

773
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,656
But at the time, he felt, we both felt,

774
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,951
that their existence
was an insignificant variable.

775
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,786
Insignificant to you, maybe,

776
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,999
but what about those people
that I put away with alternate futures?

777
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,460
My God, if the country knew
there was a chance...

778
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,545
The system would collapse.

779
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,883
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

780
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,092
You want to bring it down.

781
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:24,180
You will bring it down,
if you manage to kill your victim.

782
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:27,516
Why, that will be
the most spectacular public display

783
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,894
of how Precrime didn't work.

784
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,147
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

785
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,523
Why should I trust you?

786
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,359
You shouldn't.
You shouldn't trust anyone.

787
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,570
Certainly not the Attorney General,
who just wants it all for himself.

788
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,698
And not the young federal agent
who wants your job.

789
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,618
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang onto what he created.

790
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,747
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the minority report.

791
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,627
You said
the minority report's destroyed.

792
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,172
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

793
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,050
I designed the system
so that whenever a report occurred,

794
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,011
it would be stored in a safe place,
but not declared.

795
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,055
What safe place is that?

796
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,225
The safest place there is.

797
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,019

get in the temple,

01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,425
somehow tap into these Precogs,
and then download this minority report.

803
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,219
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

804
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:50,141
Actually, I think you'll have to run out,
but, yes, that is what you have to do.

805
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,184
You're insane.

806
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,020
Or you think I am.

How do I even know which one has it?

819
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,454
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

820
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,208
Which one is that?

821
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,754
The female.

822
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,717

here's where we're at.

823

Three men in a room.
The victim is here.

824
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,807
John is here. And this unidentified male,
out the window.

825
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,935
Now, the adjacent building
suggests public housing,

826
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,811
but I can't make out the location,
which means...

827
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,313
There's thousands of units like this one.

828
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,689
Yeah, they're everywhere.

829
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,150
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

830
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,401
Excuse me,
this is Chief Anderton's space.

831
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,528
Casey, he's okay.

832
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,112
- You can't sit in his space.
- He's not here anymore.

833
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,531
- He'll be back.
- I doubt that.

834
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,782
- What happened to you?
- It's okay.

835
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,951
In the meantime, I'm betting
he's somewhere in the sprawl.

836

01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,983
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the Chief, is it?

1004
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,402
That you think I might futz with him
if I had the chance?

1005
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,113
No, I just want to watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

1006
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,824
That's all, Jeff. Evanna, go.

1007
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:46,953
I show 27 warm bodies.

1008
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:49,539
Roger that. Confirm 27 warm bodies.

1009
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,833
What do you think? Four spyders?
One per floor?

This is Officer Fletcher
of D.C. Precrime.

01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,860
Under authority P.C. Section 6409,

1014
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,363
we are deploying spyders
into your complex.

- Mom, I'm scared.

1016

Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

1017
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,704
Come on, it's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Just stay still.

1018
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,374
Stay still, baby. Open your eyes.
It's okay.

1019
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,834
GIRL: I don't like it.
WOMAN 1: Stay still, stay still.

1020
01:18:57,108 --> 01:19:00,443
Come on! You can't just come
barging in here like that! Come on!

1021
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,779
WOMAN 2: You have stepped out on me
for the last time.

1022
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,906
MAN: I told you where I was!
Now get off my back!

1023
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:08,660
WOMAN 2: You're a no good liar!
I know you was with that ho last night.

1024
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,667
- Leave me alone!
- Get out of here!

1025
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,037
We lost one.

1026
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:38,082
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping
through a window or something.

1027
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,169
- That's an awful big cat.
- Fletcher.

1028
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,464
I'll go check it out.

1029
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,629
They're crying their eyes out.

1030
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,756
You terrified them.
They're absolutely terrified right now!

1031
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,175
You don't want your kids to know terror,
keep them away from me.

(SPYDERS CHATTERING)

Wait a minute. The big cat's back.

1034
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:49,070
What do you guys think,
a drunk, maybe can't wake up?

1035
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,322
Yeah, some guy
who doesn't want to get read.

1036
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:54,242
Folks, please be quiet.
Close your doors. Go back inside.

1037
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,422
Be quiet and close the door!

(GLASS SHATTERING)

1044
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,201
Fletcher, take a look.

1045
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,290
There's four people in this room,
not three.

1046
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:46,461
Four? There's Anderton, there's Crow
and there's the man with sunglasses.

1047
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:49,380
Here's the man with sunglasses
outside the window.

1048
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:56,179
There's also someone here,
in the mirror.

1049
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,890
Yeah. Definitely female.

1050
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:04,395
MAN: The Precrime Program began
in the year 2046 with a federal grant.

1051
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,689
And now, nine years later,

1052
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,817
the District of Columbia is
the safest city in America.

1053
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,487
Why? Because Precrime works.

1054
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:16,074
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives,

1055
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,825
so most of what happens now

1056
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,870
is the verification and the protection
of the future victim.

1057
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:22,330
Can we see the Precogs?

1058
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,166
Well, the Precogs have
such a powerful gift

1059
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,001
that they have to be kept
in peaceful seclusion

1060
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,420
so as not to be distracted
from the outside world.

1061
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:33,925
But this display is to give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

1062
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,805
The Precogs get over
eight million pieces of mail every year,

1063
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:40,807
more mail than Santa Claus gets.

1064
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:44,352
Each Precog has their own bedroom,
television and weight room.

1065
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,896
It really is wonderful to be a Precog.

1066
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,132
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

1067
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:17,218
He's just not a very intelligent person.

1068
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,053
My mom wouldn't let me go upstairs
and eat in my room.

1069
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,722
She made me sit down there
the entire time,

1070
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:23,474
having to listen to him
go on and on and on.

1071
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:35,069
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

WALLY: I want to get a new dog.

1074
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,595
Which I told her I should be able to do

1075
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,221
because I'm so good
at taking care of you guys.

1076
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:06,058
But she thinks that I'll be irresponsible,
which is ridiculous.

1077
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:14,525
No, no, no, no! You can't be in here!
No, no! What are you doing here?

No, no, no, no!

1079
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,949
Easy there, old-timer. Who cleared you?
You are not supposed to be in here.

1080
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,285
- Listen, Wally.
- Do I know you? Who are you?

1081
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:28,247
I like you, Wally. So, I don't want to have
to kick you or hit you with anything hard,

1082
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,500
but only if you promise to help me.

1083
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:33,711
Hi, John.

1084
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,680
Who does that look like to you?

1085
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,767
I don't know.

1086
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,815
It's Agatha.

1087
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,067
He's coming here to get her.

1088
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:01,864
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

1089
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,828
I don't need to see all these.
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

1090
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,496
I'm looking.
They're not coming out in any order.

1091
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,414
I'm just getting them as she's giving.

1092
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,087
Can you see?

1093
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:32,353
- He's inside.
- He's got some kind of mask on.

1094
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,980
He sealed the door from the inside.

1095
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:36,190
Shit! Nobody fires a weapon
inside the temple.

1096
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,943
Use only bindfoam or your sick-sticks.
Is there another way out of there?

1097
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,153
We've got all the doors covered.
There's no way he's getting out.

No! No, no, no, no, no!

- What does he want with the Precog?
- What do you think?

1104
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:09,765
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing about it!

1105
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,475
But there's still the other two.

1106
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:15,062
Wally! Wally!
The other two can still function, right?

1107
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,064
You don't understand.
They're a hive mind.

1108

It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

Are you telling me
they can't see murders anymore?

1110
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,451
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males,
but Agatha, she's the key.

1111
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:31,579
She's the one they listen to,
the one with the most talent.

JAD: If he's ransoming her,
where's the damn note?

1142
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,939
It has nothing to do with ransom.

1143
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,192
It has to do with the information
that's inside of Agatha.

1144
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,738
He's trying to prove his innocence.

1145
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,282
But he can't download her
without a lot of technical support.

1146
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,076
Well, your average consumer
can't buy any of this stuff

1147
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:36,203
because it's been assembled
and scrounged

1148
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,414
from spare parts made to order.

1149

which encompasses
everything from bungee jumping

to soaring like an eagle
over the Grand Canyon.

01:47:42,248 --> 01:47:45,750
If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay?

1334
01:47:47,503 --> 01:47:49,712
If you killed my kid?

1335
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:53,550
CROW: Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1336
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:56,511
What about the pictures?

1337
01:47:57,221 --> 01:48:00,932
They're fake.
He gave them to me. Okay?

1338
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:04,144
Now, listen to me. You...

1339
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:07,689
You tell me, who was it that set this up?

1340
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:10,275
I don't know.

1341
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:13,069
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again.

1342
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:16,197
- Who was it that put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1343
01:48:16,282 --> 01:48:18,324
I tell you who it was,
and my family gets nothing.

1344
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,451
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1345
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:21,995
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1346
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,080
- Kill me. Kill me.
- Give me the gun.

1347
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,583
Leo, let go of the gun.

1348
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:29,252
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1349
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,757
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1350
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,636
You're not gonna kill me.

1351
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,472
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a...

1352
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:42,640
(SCREAMING)

1353
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:43,766
(GUN FIRING)

1354
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,646
No!

1355
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:58,072
WOMAN 1: Hey, did you see it?
MAN: Stay back!

1356
01:48:58,157 --> 01:49:00,325
WOMAN 2: What's
happening down there?

1357
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:03,036
WOMAN 3: Murder!

1358
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,871
Murder!

1359
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:08,666
WITWER: It doesn't make sense.

1360
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:10,919
If you were a child killer,
you took these pictures,

1361
01:49:11,003 --> 01:49:12,879
would you leave them on the bed
for anyone to find?

1362
01:49:12,963 --> 01:49:15,215
They may have been put away.
Anderton might have found them.

1363
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:18,051
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent. Eight years.

1364
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:19,510
This would be
your first actual murder scene?

1365
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,553
Yeah.

1366
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:22,222
I worked homicide before I went federal.

1367
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:24,766
This is what we call an orgy of evidence.

1368
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,143
Know how many orgies I had
as a homicide cop, Gordon?

1369
01:49:27,228 --> 01:49:29,854
- How many?
- None.

1370
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:37,487
This was all arranged.

1371
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:41,449
MAN: Today we saw the first murder in
the six years of the Precrime experiment.

1372
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:42,575
(PHONE RINGING)

1373
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:45,495
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1374
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:49,082
The protection team simply didn't
get there in time to stop the murder.

1375
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:54,295
But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Precogs predicted it would.

1376
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:58,132
I think that today's event put
a human face on the Precrime system.

1377
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:02,262
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1378
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:06,724
Lamar?

1379
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:15,108
- What?
- WITWER: Lamar, there's something

1380
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:17,443
terribly wrong.
We're chasing the wrong man.

1381
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:18,569
What?

1382
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:20,238
WITWER:
I don't wanna say over the phone.

1383
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:22,073
Meet me at Anderton's.

1384
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:25,535
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1385
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,877
LAMAR: I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1386
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:37,547
WITWER: Please, sir.

1387
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,427
Tell me what you have.

1388
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:50,101
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1389
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:55,982
Yeah, John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1390
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:58,985
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1391
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:01,070
Agatha's stream was missing.

1392
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,450
Now this one is from the cyber parlor.

1393
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:10,079
Anderton downloaded this directly from
Agatha, and Rufus Riley recorded it.

1394
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:16,836
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1395
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:23,092
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1396
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:26,429
Moving away from shore.

1397
01:51:27,973 --> 01:51:29,307
Now the second image.

1398
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:32,477
This is the one from Containment.
It's what Art and Dash saw.

1399
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:34,854
Watch the water.

1400
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:40,651
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1401
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:45,948
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1402
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,159
According to the Sentry,
Anderton was watching this

1403
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:49,869
at Containment
right before he was tagged.

1404
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:53,039
Well, I know. He came to me,
told me about the missing data stream.

1405
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,999
He was concerned that you might find it.

1406
01:51:55,084 --> 01:51:58,961
Well, he was right. I did find it.
It was inside of Agatha the whole time.

1407
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:03,633
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1408
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,970
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

1409
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,808
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1410
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:13,476
How?

1411
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,270
Well, Jad told me
that sometimes the Precogs see

1412
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:17,897
the same murder more than once.

1413
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:22,568
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it "Precog déjà vu."

1414
01:52:22,653 --> 01:52:26,614
Well, we teach the techs
to identify them and disregard.

1415
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:32,453
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1416
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:33,913
What if what he was really looking at

1417
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:36,749
was a completely
different murder altogether?

1418
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:39,168
I don't understand.

1419
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:41,671
All you'd have to do is
hire someone to kill Anne Lively,

1420
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,258
someone like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1421
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,969
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place,

1422
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:53,683
haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else,

1423
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:57,103
having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes,

1424
01:52:57,187 --> 01:53:00,690
commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1425
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:06,487
Technician takes a look,
thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.

1426
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,202
Of course, it would have to be someone

1427
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:16,122
with access to the previsions
in the first place.

1428
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:17,498
Someone fairly high up.

1429
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:18,708
(SHUSHING)

1430
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,837
Do you know what I hear?

1431
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:28,384
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1432
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:32,180
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1433
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:34,140
Do you know why I can't hear
any of those things, Danny?

1434
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,727
Because right now,
the Precogs can't see a thing.

1435
01:53:37,936 --> 01:54:01,667
(GUN FIRING)

1436
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:05,254
AGATHA: Can you see? It's beautiful.

1437
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,425
- Where are we going?
- JOHN: Some place safe.

1438
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:12,929
(BEEPING)

1439
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:19,101
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1440
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:21,646
- LAMAR: Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.

1441
01:54:23,148 --> 01:54:25,691
- Is he there?
- Yes.

1442
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:28,861
Has he got the Precog with him?

1443
01:54:31,073 --> 01:54:34,617
- Yes.
- Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1444
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:38,746
Please. Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1445
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,958
I won't say a word.

1446
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,129
You just don't let John leave, all right?

1447
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:50,174
He's no killer, Lamar.

1448
01:54:50,801 --> 01:54:52,385
I know.

1449
01:55:03,772 --> 01:55:05,273
AGATHA: It's cold.

1450
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:12,905
Lara, this is Agatha.

1451
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:23,332
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1452
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:31,340
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1453
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,220
I gotta sit down.

1454
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:42,518
I gotta figure this out.

1455
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:23,559
JOHN: They used Sean.

1456
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:28,230
They wanted me to
think Crow killed him.

1457
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:31,067
But he didn't.

1458
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:34,195
He didn't.

1459
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:38,407
Why would they set you up?

1460
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:48,626
Because I found out about her.

1461
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:51,837
About who?

1462
01:56:51,922 --> 01:56:55,633
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1463
01:56:56,927 --> 01:56:58,761
Anne Lively.

1464
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:02,932
Agatha.

1465
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:12,358
Dr. Hineman once said, "The dead
don't die. They look on and help."

1466
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:15,611
Remember that, John.

1467
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:19,281
- Agatha.
- Sean.

1468
01:57:24,204 --> 01:57:28,749
He's on the beach now, toe in the water.

1469
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,295
He's asking you to come in with him.

1470
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:37,717
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1471
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:42,012
There's so much love in this house.

1472
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:49,145
He's 10 years old.

1473
01:57:51,606 --> 01:57:53,816
He's surrounded by animals.

1474
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:57,528
He wants to be a vet.

1475
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:03,993
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1476
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:07,705
He's in high school.

1477
01:58:08,165 --> 01:58:11,000
He likes to run, like his father.

1478
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:14,670
He runs the two-mile and the long relay.

1479
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:18,007
He's 23.

1480
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:21,343
He's at a university.

1481
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:25,181
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1482
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:27,725
He asks her to be his wife.

1483
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:31,520
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.

1484
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:39,195
He still runs across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1485
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:44,200
Oh, God.
He's running so fast, just like his daddy.

1486
01:58:45,535 --> 01:58:49,038
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1487
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:55,169
But he's only six years old,
and he can't do it.

1488
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:58,380
And the other man is so fast.

1489
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:05,262
There was so much love in this house.

1490
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:08,557
I want him back so bad.

1491
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:13,020
So did she.

1492
01:59:13,855 --> 01:59:15,523
Can't you see?

1493
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:21,946
She just wanted her little girl back.

1494
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:26,700
But it was too late.

1495
01:59:28,662 --> 01:59:31,080
Her little girl was already gone.

1496
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:33,582
She's still alive.

1497
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:39,004
She didn't die, but she's not alive.

1498
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:42,633
Agatha?

1499
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:48,389
Just tell me, who killed your mother?

1500
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:51,976
Who killed Anne Lively?

1501
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:58,607
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1502
01:59:59,442 --> 02:00:00,484
What?

1503
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:03,612
(SCREAMING) Run!

1504
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:20,004
(WHISPERING) I love you.

- No, no.

- You'll be fine with them.
- No, no.

1510
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:52,703
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

1511
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:57,875
I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1512
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,588
That's it.

1513
02:01:03,173 --> 02:01:04,840
That's my girl.

1514
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:09,511
I was so worried about you.

1515
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,767
Did he hurt you?

1516
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:20,064
I missed you so much.

1517
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,984
It's okay. Wally's here. Wally's here.

1518
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:33,911
You're a part of my flock now, John.
Welcome.

1519
02:01:35,372 --> 02:01:39,959
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions,

1520
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:46,256
that your life flashes before your eyes,
that all your dreams come true.

1521
02:02:03,608 --> 02:02:05,609
This is all my fault.

1522
02:02:06,945 --> 02:02:09,446
There was nothing anyone could do.

1523
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:13,409
Lara...

1524
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:16,787
I thought you might want to have those.

1525
02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:27,464
I haven't worn this in years. I just wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1526
02:02:27,549 --> 02:02:29,216
You look great.

1527
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,470
I knew he was having trouble for some
time, and yet I did nothing about it.

1528

Excuse me.
The guy from USA today is here.

1529
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:37,307
Tell him not now.

1530
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:40,602
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1531
02:02:43,398 --> 02:02:47,067
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1532
02:02:47,152 --> 02:02:52,114
But this incident with John
made me realize the fragility of all this.

(CLEARING THROAT)

1534
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:56,785
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1535
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,956
Now I have an obligation to protect that.

1536
02:03:01,583 --> 02:03:05,335
Lara, I know how difficult this is for you.

1537
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:09,923
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact that

1538
02:03:10,008 --> 02:03:12,926
John finally found the man
who killed your son.

1539
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:18,057
Who's Anne Lively?

1540
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:22,770
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1541
02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:27,066
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1542
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:29,151
I don't know who that is.

1543
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,908
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1544
02:03:35,992 --> 02:03:41,080
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1545
02:03:41,164 --> 02:03:43,916
And Witwer?
He was killed with John's gun

1546
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,585
- inside John's apartment.
- Lamar, do you know the reason

1547
02:03:46,669 --> 02:03:50,047
why John came here to work for you?

1548
02:03:50,131 --> 02:03:51,590
- Sean.
- Yes.

1549
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:55,761
He came here to work for you
because he thought

1550
02:03:55,845 --> 02:04:00,516
if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

1551
02:04:01,226 --> 02:04:04,394
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1552
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:09,024
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1553
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:13,737
Lara, John was the best cop
I ever knew,

1554
02:04:13,822 --> 02:04:17,116
and, in some ways, also the best man.

1555
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,785
But the scars he carried around...

1556
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:25,415
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the
good things we remember about him.

1557
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:28,293
And I also know why he married you.

1558

Lara, do you know
how to tie one of these?

1561
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:39,721
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, you see.

1562

Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1563
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:55,487
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1564
02:04:55,572 --> 02:04:59,366
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files,

1565
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:02,494
see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1566
02:05:02,579 --> 02:05:04,872
What did you say her name was?

1567
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:09,168
Anne Lively.

1568
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:12,171
But I never said she drowned.

1569
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:36,612
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1570
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:43,952
We'll talk about this later.

1571

I'll come by the cottage.

with five gold-plated bullets

of the destruction and death

1666
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:40,637
No doubt the Precogs
have already seen this.

1667
02:13:41,138 --> 02:13:42,681
No doubt.

1668
02:13:44,183 --> 02:13:46,351
JOHN: You see the dilemma, don't you?

1669
02:13:47,103 --> 02:13:51,314
If you don't kill me, Precogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1670
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:56,319
If you do kill me, you go away,

1671
02:13:56,404 --> 02:14:00,323
but it proves the system works.
Precogs were right.

1672
02:14:07,206 --> 02:14:10,041
So, what are you gonna do now?

1673
02:14:11,836 --> 02:14:13,628
What's it worth?

1674
02:14:14,505 --> 02:14:16,339
Just one more murder.

1675
02:14:19,927 --> 02:14:24,556
You'll rot in hell with a halo,
but people will still believe in Precrime.

1676
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:28,309
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1677
02:14:32,481 --> 02:14:37,402
Except you know your own future,

1678
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:40,905
which means you can change it
if you want to.

1679
02:14:42,199 --> 02:14:46,619
You still have a choice, Lamar,
like I did.

1680
02:14:52,209 --> 02:14:54,794
Yes, I have a choice.

1681
02:14:56,297 --> 02:14:57,922
And I made it.

1682
02:14:59,216 --> 02:15:00,884
Forgive me, John.

1683
02:15:01,135 --> 02:15:02,761
(GUN FIRING)

1684
02:15:02,845 --> 02:15:04,304
Forgive me.

1685
02:15:09,935 --> 02:15:11,686
Forgive me, my boy.

1686
02:15:30,206 --> 02:15:31,539
CELESTE: Lamar!

1687
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:47,597
JOHN: In 2054, the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.

1688
02:15:55,564 --> 02:15:58,650
ALL prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released,

1689
02:15:58,734 --> 02:16:03,196
although police departments kept watch
on many of them for years to come.

1690
02:16:50,953 --> 02:16:56,040
Agatha and the twins were transferred
to an undisclosed location,

1691
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:01,546
a place where they could find relief
from their gifts.

1692
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:05,258
A place where they could
live out their lives in peace.
