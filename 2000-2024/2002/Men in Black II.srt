1
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,682
Mysteries in History,
with your host, Peter Graves. 

2
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:32,637
Although no one has ever been able
to prove their existence...

3
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:35,801
... a quasi-government agency, 
the Men in Black... 

4
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,166
... supposedly carries out operations
here on Earth... 

5
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,242
... in order to k eep us safe from aliens
throughout the galaxies. 

6
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,765
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"...

7
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,968
... from one of their files
that doesn't exist. 

8
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:55,522
1978. The leaders of Zartha
flee their planet... 

9
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:00,717
... in order to escape the clutches
of the evil Kylothian, Serleena. 

10
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:04,963
Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring
with them their greatest treasure... 

11
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:09,168
The Light of Zartha, 
a cosmic force so powerful... 

12
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,686
... that in the wrong hands it could
lead to the annihilation of Zartha. 

13
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:17,445
The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna, 
beseeched the Men in Black... 

14
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,839
... to hide the Light from Serleena. 

15
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,240
But they had no choice.

16
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,765
Intervention would have meant
the destruction of the Earth. 

17
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:31,964
However, in an act of galactic bravery, 
the Men in Black subdued Serleena... 

18
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,245
... allowing the Zarthans to escape...

19
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,924
... so they might hide the Light
on another planet. 

20
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:43,520
Serleena, released from her captors, 
v owed that the Light would be hers... 

21
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:48,365
... and that she would destroy
any planet that stood in her way. 

22
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,168
And so, never knowing what happened... 

23
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,323
... the people of Earth were saved
by a secret society of protectors... 

24
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:00,447
... known as the Men in Black. 

25
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,326
Harvey!

26
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,798
Harvey, get over here!

27
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,359
Harvey. Heel, heel!

28
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:45,679
You're barking at the moon, moron.

29
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,521
Harvey. Harvey!

30
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,607
Hey, pretty lady.

31
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,167
You taste good.

32
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,363
Hey, what the...?

33
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,558
Yeah, you too.

34
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:49,964
Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book.

35
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,528
Got it. Hey!

36
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:54,884
Hey, Jeff. What's happening, buddy?

37
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,837
- We were wondering why you're here.
- The man's talking to you.

38
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,082
You know our arrangements.
Stay in the E, F and R subway lines...

39
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,604
...and you get all the garbage
you want.

40
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,363
What the hell are you doing here,
worm boy?

41
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,518
Tee.

42
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,363
Jeff... 

43
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,645
Excuse my partner.
He's new and he's...

44
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:19,249
...kind of stupid.

45
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:19,809
...kind of stupid.

46
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:29,762
You getting big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eating?

47
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,521
You like jokes, huh?

48
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,521
Jeffrey!

49
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,483
All right.

50
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,641
Sweet dreams, big boy.

51
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:25,762
Sweet dreams...

52
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,688
...big boy.

53
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,522
Transit authority.
Move to the forward car.

54
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:37,157
We got a bug in the electrical system.

55
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:43,998
People! We got a bug
in the electrical system!

56
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,281
Now y'all running?

57
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,087
No, no, no! Sit down!

58
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:53,126
It's only a 600-foot worm.

59
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:00,168
- Everybody out.
- Put the hammer down on this thing.

60
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:03,685
I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater.
I decide what happens.

61
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:06,363
You decide?
Okay, come here. Come here.

62
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,485
Larry? That's my man, Jeff.

63
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:15,682
- Larry just made a decision.
- Larry need to take his ass in there.

64
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,278
Don't make me do this, Jeff!

65
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,807
Eighty-first Street.

66
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:56,804
Just a second.

67
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,808
May I have your attention, please?

68
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:04,042
We thank you
for participating in our drill.

69
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,167
Had this been an emergency,
you'd have been eaten.

70
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,763
Because you don't listen.
You're ignorant.

71
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,922
How a man gonna bash through...?
That's the problem with New Yorkers.

72
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,604
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm!
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

73
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,762
I ask you nice, " Move to the next car."
You just sit there like...

74
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,241
Thank you for participating.

75
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:29,118
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller,
energy-efficient subway cars.

76
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:32,567
Watch your step.
You will have a nice evening.

77
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,445
I need a cleanup crew
at 81 st and Central Park West.

78
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,998
Revoke Jeff's movement privileges.

79
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:44,888
Have him escorted
to the Chambers Street station.

80
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:49,804
And please check the expiration date
on the unipod worm tranquillizers.

81
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,721
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.

82
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:00,082
- Emergency drill. For your safety.
- Do you believe these putzes?

83
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,042
You're welcome.

84
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,319
I know, by the book.

85
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:22,767
Tee, when was the last time
we just looked at the stars?

86
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:25,807
This is a test. I can do this.

87
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,603
Ever feel like you're alone
in the universe?

88
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,202
Yes.

89
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,687
No.

90
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,801
- Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.
- Really?

91
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,683
Thanks.

92
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,082
Hey, you're not alone
in the universe.

93
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:48,319
- Remove the arm.
- Okay.

94
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,369
Please, shut up, Charlie.

95
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:53,329
Please, shut up, Charlie.

96
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,169
I'm tired of you constantly talking
behind my back.

97
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:56,842
I'm tired of you constantly talking
behind my back.

98
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:02,244
You meet a girl. She's into it.
The best line you come up with is:

99
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:06,402
"Wanna come back to my place for some
tonsil hockey and egg salad?"

100
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:10,085
- Who are you and how'd you get in here?
- You like egg salad?

101
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,562
Serleena!

102
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:17,801
Why didn't you say it was you?

103
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,037
- Where's the Light?
- Here's the deal.

104
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,484
You're looking for this Light.
We found it.

105
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:27,767
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill.
Here's how it'll work. First...

106
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:30,727
Where is the Light?

107
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:39,641
We couldn't find it, but we found
a guy who might know where it is.

108
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,721
He runs a pizza parlour
on Spring Street.

109
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,684
Let's go. And wipe your nose, idiot.

110
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,488
- Good pie.
- Yeah.

111
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,362
Crowded.

112
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,201
Well, they got good pie.

113
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:07,723
What's wrong with you?

114
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,005
- You're gonna neuralyze me.
- No, I'm not.

115
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,637
You took me here
so I wouldn't make a scene.

116
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,527
You making a scene.

117
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,406
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you join MiB?

118
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,925
Six years in the Marines.
I like the action. Protect the planet.

119
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,286
You like being a hero?
You joined the wrong organization.

120
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:29,285
- You ever heard of James Edwards?
- No.

121
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:33,284
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people
on the subway tonight.

122
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:35,360
No one knows he exists.

123
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:40,559
And if no one knows he exists,
how can anyone ever love him?

124
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:46,319
Hey, how long we been partners?

125
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:49,322
- Feb 1.
- Five months, three days.

126
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:52,083
- Started at noon.
- Nine hours.

127
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:01,204
Get married. Have a bunch of kids.

128
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,281
Okay.

129
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,208
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy,
but he thinks you are hot.

130
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,278
Here it is.

131
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,248
I don't know what to say.

132
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:23,207
Years from now,
you know what people'll say?

133
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:26,566
- " Employee" is misspelled?
- They charge by the letter.

134
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:30,722
They'll say, " lmagine that. Big shot
like her used to work here."

135
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:32,208
- Ben...
- You deserve it.

136
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:35,361
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew
from the basement.

137
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,767
Hey, Bruno.

138
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:45,086
Two slices of pepperoni and
information about the Light of Zartha.

139
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:48,480
- Whoever you are, don't hurt me.
- Where's the Light, Ben?

140
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,925
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me down, ma'am.

141
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,080
I want to report a robbery...

142
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,802
There.

143
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,563
Noise.

144
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,408
Kitchen!

145
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:13,285
You idiots see anything?

146
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:16,327
Wind blew the door open.

147
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,880
Nothing out of the ordinary.

148
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,246
For 25 years, I've travelled
the universe looking for it.

149
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:25,207
But it never left Earth, did it?
You kept it here.

150
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,041
What are you talking about?

151
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,598
I'm running out of time.
Where's the Light?

152
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,488
- I don't know what you mean.
- Listen, Zarthan.

153
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,083
You hid the Light on Earth.
I'll find it.

154
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:38,639
Once we have the Light,
Zartha will be ours.

155
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,277
You're too late.
Tomorrow at midnight...

156
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:44,805
...the Light will leave
the third planet and be back home.

157
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:48,120
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

158
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,477
Now we don't know
if it's on Earth or not.

159
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:01,924
He said third planet.
It's here, you idiot.

160
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,638
- Third Rock from the Sun. 
- I never got that till now.

161
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,838
It's on Earth, and I know
who's gonna tell me where it is.

162
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,209
- Don't you ever go home?
- Nope.

163
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:39,042
I see you neuralyzed another partner.

164
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:47,929
Bee, Dee, when you use
a fission carboniser...

165
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,684
...attach a de-atomizer
so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

166
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:55,967
Hey, get some booties on them things.
You're crapping up the floor.

167
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:00,562
Check his visa.

168
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:04,722
The Cephalopods have been making
counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

169
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:09,917
And why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph
going through passport control?

170
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,082
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry.
Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

171
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:17,639
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, sir.

172
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,522
Good work in the subway.

173
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,398
- I remember Jeff when he was yea high.
- What you got for me?

174
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,799
Look. See those guys in black suits?

175
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:31,881
- They work here. We got it covered.
- Zed, what you got?

176
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:36,122
Dedication's one thing, but this job
will eat you up and spit you out.

177
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,122
You want to look like me
when you hit 50...

178
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:41,358
...ish?

179
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,325
I'll be in the gym if you need me.

180
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:48,166
All right, there was a killing earlier.
177 Spring.

181
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:49,603
Alien-on-alien.

182
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,158
Take Tee with you
and make a report.

183
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:53,969
Tee. Right.

184
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:55,249
Tee. Right.

185
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:55,729
What happened,
what happened with Tee...

186
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:56,209
What happened,
what happened with Tee...

187
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,169
What happened,
what happened with Tee...

188
00:17:58,129 --> 00:17:58,969
Passports. No rush.
How they hanging, Jay?

189
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,561
Passports. No rush.
How they hanging, Jay?

190
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:03,641
You have got to stop neuralyzing
MiB personnel.

191
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:05,925
He was crying
in the middle of the diner.

192
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,568
I hate that.

193
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,239
And plus, you can't count Elle.

194
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,242
She wanted to go back to the morgue.
I helped her.

195
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,162
- You need a partner.
- I'm cool.

196
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,400
I'll be his partner.

197
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:22,087
Jay, wait up.
I appreciate the shot, man.

198
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:24,365
- Thought I'd never get out.
- Lose the suit.

199
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:26,645
Sure thing.
Just going for the look.

200
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,403
But if I say so myself,
I find it slimming.

201
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,083
Not that I've had problems
with the ladies.

202
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:33,762
When you get down to...

203
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,601
Nice sled, very swank.

204
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:37,805
Heated seats? Sometimes I get hives.

205
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,683
Frank!

206
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,005
Bring your head in this window
before I roll it up in there.

207
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,443
Got it.

208
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,608
Frank!

209
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,680
My money? It's missionary.

210
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:18,807
I was in the Bowery,
and I meet this Great Dane.

211
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:21,119
A little thick in the body,
but pretty.

212
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:24,281
That's just not appealing to me, man.
Seriously.

213
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:26,644
I say we do the good cop,
bad cop thing.

214
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:29,277
You interrogate the witness
and I growl.

215
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:33,488
How about we do the good cop,
dumb dog thing, and you just shut up?

216
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,924
You got it, partner.
Total silence.

217
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:39,286
Absolute quiet. Not a word out of me.

218
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,522
What do we got?

219
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,888
- What do we got?
- There's residue on the wall.

220
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,759
- We sent samples to Em for analysis.
- Hey, 0°% ° body fat.

221
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:56,001
- Funny.
- Witness?

222
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,402
Girl. Saw everything.

223
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:01,048
She's taking it well.

224
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:05,202
I won't answer any more questions.
I want to know what happened here.

225
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,565
- I'll handle this one.
- You got it.

226
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,960
Alone. A talking dog might be
a bit much for her now.

227
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,120
What do you want me to do?

228
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,365
Sniff around.

229
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:17,408
What?

230
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:18,958
Funny.

231
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:21,484
Take a deep breath.
Everything is all right.

232
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:24,641
What part is she supposed
to feel all right about?

233
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,248
I'm Agent Jay.

234
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:30,842
Tell me what you saw.

235
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,443
- A two-headed guy and a woman.
- Caucasian?

236
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,487
Gray, with tentacles
that she used to rip...

237
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:37,638
His skin off.

238
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:42,883
It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer
similar to the gum in baseball cards.

239
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,517
- What was the last thing you ate?
- Calzone.

240
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:46,758
- What time?
- Lunch.

241
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,204
- Spinach?
- Mushroom.

242
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,528
You need pie.

243
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:52,849
They kept asking Ben about a light.

244
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:53,329
They kept asking Ben about a light.

245
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:53,809
They kept asking Ben about a light.

246
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:54,289
They kept asking Ben about a light.

247
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:54,769
They kept asking Ben about a light.

248
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:55,729
Light of Zartha, something like that.

249
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:56,209
Light of Zartha, something like that.

250
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:56,649
Light of Zartha, something like that.

251
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,808
You okay?

252
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:02,120
An hour ago, a man I've known
my whole life vanished...

253
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,803
...because of a woman
with weird fingers...

254
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,529
...and a two-headed guy
with a cannoli's IQ.

255
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:10,249
So yeah, everything's okay.

256
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:15,364
When we're kids,
before we're taught how to think...

257
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,726
...our hearts tell us there is
something else out there.

258
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:23,565
I know what I saw.
Tell me what I'm supposed to believe.

259
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:33,918
I'm a member of a secret organization
that monitors alien activity on Earth.

260
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,159
Ben was an alien.
So were his killers.

261
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,163
I don't know why they did it,
but I promise I'm gonna find out.

262
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:43,286
Okay.

263
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:46,078
- Okay?
- Okay.

264
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:48,802
Okay.

265
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:56,568
- I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to...
- Kill me.

266
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:58,208
No!

267
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:02,123
Just a little flash and everything
goes back the way it was.

268
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:05,766
After you flash me...

269
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:08,238
...if I see you again,
will I know it's you?

270
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,365
I'll see you.

271
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:14,567
But you won't see me.

272
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:16,720
Must be hard.

273
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,720
Must be very lonely.

274
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:34,798
Excuse me.

275
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,967
- I gotta go.
- What about the flashing thing?

276
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:42,603
I'll flash you some other time.

277
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,247
What?

278
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:10,888
- Did you tell the girl you love her?
- She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

279
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,959
You're attracted. She's not my species,
and I'm attracted.

280
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:18,917
I should take advice on love
from a dude that chases his own ass?

281
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:22,968
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling,
and I resent it.

282
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:40,283
Hey, Jay, wait up.

283
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:43,361
Coming through. MiB brass.
Look sharp.

284
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:47,283
I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner.
Who are you eyeballing?

285
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:49,599
Frank, just cool out, dog.

286
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,808
- Got kids?
- No.

287
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:54,402
Want them?

288
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:59,360
Get him off me!

289
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:09,883
-Talk to me.
- It's Kylothian, class C.

290
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,038
Serleena. 

291
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:13,439
-Serleena. Old girlfriend? 
- She wishes.

292
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:16,203
The perps were looking
for the Light of... 

293
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:17,961
- Zartha.
- Yeah, what is it? 

294
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:20,484
This makes no sense.
It's not on Earth.

295
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:23,800
- We took care of this a long time ago.
- Obviously not.

296
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:25,925
That is very bad news. 

297
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,604
The Zarthans came to Earth
to hide the Light from Serleena.

298
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:33,125
-We don't do that. 
- Right. I ordered it off the planet.

299
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:34,881
Well, Zed... 

300
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:39,281
I got a Kylothian class C in my park.
Are you sure this Light isn't here?

301
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:42,885
Positive. I gave the order.
My best agent carried it out.

302
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,517
- It's as if I gave it to you.
-Ask the agent. 

303
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:46,724
- Can't.
-Dead? 

304
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,926
Sort of. He works at the post office.

305
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:52,164
No.

306
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,889
If Serleena gets to Kay before we do, 
he's dead. 

307
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,927
The Earth's very existence
may rest on what Kay knows.

308
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,478
Too bad you wiped out
his memory of it.

309
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,082
Bring him in.

310
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,358
Now.

311
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:07,442
How cool is this? Going to get Kay.
The legend, the go-to guy.

312
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,043
Your mentor,
who taught you everything.

313
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,646
- The greatest agent in MiB history!
- Frank! Stop talking.

314
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:19,517
Stay.

315
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:22,203
Listen, partner.
I may look like a dog...

316
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,724
...but I only play one here on Earth.

317
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,444
- Whatever. Wipe your mouth.
- Hey, babe.

318
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:36,720
People of Truro,
may I kindly have your attention?

319
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:39,198
To facilitate your shipping needs...

320
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:41,929
...all packages must be
properly wrapped.

321
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:45,798
This one is an example of
"go home and do it again."

322
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:48,642
I think you know what I mean,
Mrs. Vigushin.

323
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,485
Brown paper and triple-twist twine
are the preferred media.

324
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,321
Thank you for your time.

325
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:59,243
- Kay.
- C. Express mail, two-day air.

326
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,198
Kevin.

327
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,886
Kevin. That's funny.
You don't have a " Kevin" ... 

328
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,679
You don't remember.
We worked together.

329
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:15,762
I never worked in a funeral home.
Something I can do for you, slick?

330
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,487
Straight to the point.

331
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,248
You were an agent of an organization
that monitors aliens on Earth.

332
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,322
We're the Men in Black.
We have a situation. We need your help.

333
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:30,084
There is a free mental health clinic
on the corner of Lilac.

334
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:32,126
- Next.
- Excuse me.

335
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,560
- Twenty Rugrats stamps.
- Elizabeth.

336
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:38,881
The Postal Service hasn't kept up
with today's youth, but we have...

337
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,609
...Berlin airlift stamps.
Opera legends?

338
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,602
American Samoa?
Amish quilts.

339
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,363
I'm sorry, got a world to save here.

340
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:50,645
There was no coma.
It was a cover.

341
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,527
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

342
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:56,807
The postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts
and I'm ordering you to leave.

343
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,008
- Is that decaf?
- Sorry.

344
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:03,444
We have a breach.
Cordon off this area.

345
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:06,487
Full perimeter wipe-down,
right here, right now.

346
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:10,881
Get a mop and escort all civilian
personnel from this site immediately.

347
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:14,086
Listen to yourself, Kay.
Who talks like that?

348
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,522
Why do you think you're
so comfortable here?

349
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:15,684
Just about everybody who works
in a post office is an alien.

350
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,005
No smoking.

351
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:34,638
Kay.

352
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,399
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy
fly a tiger around a room.

353
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,002
You're nothing special.

354
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:42,967
When you look at the stars,
you get a feeling...

355
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:45,040
...like you don't know who you are.

356
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:48,679
Like you know more about out there
than you do down here.

357
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:53,286
That's why she left you, Kay.
That's why your wife left you.

358
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:56,961
Okay, I'll tell you what.

359
00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:00,838
You want to know who you really are,
take a ride with me.

360
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:04,718
If not, people are waiting
for their TV Guides. 

361
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,202
Think he'll bite?

362
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:18,438
I'm just going for a ride. If things
don't add up, it's hasta luego. 

363
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:20,122
Hey, Kay.

364
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:23,559
How's it hanging?

365
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,041
Good to see you, Kay.

366
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:42,167
Good to see you too,
whoever you are.

367
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:47,528
Well, let's see
what you got here, chief.

368
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,724
Welcome back, Agent Kay.

369
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,157
Agent Kay.

370
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:04,799
Greetings, Kay.

371
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,123
Wow, look who's back.

372
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,723
I don't mean to bother you...
You're Agent Kay!

373
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:13,926
- That's what they tell me.
- This is an honour. Agent Gee.

374
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:16,478
The most respected agent
in MiB history.

375
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,038
The most feared human in the universe.

376
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:22,042
Maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee?

377
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:24,769
- Black, two sugars, if you're going.
- An honor.

378
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:28,160
- Yeah, I'll take a... My man?
- Good to see you, Kay.

379
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:31,088
How'd it go?

380
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:33,604
The Drolacks are gone
and the treaty is signed. 

381
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:34,758
Good work.

382
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:38,080
What about that position you
promised me in Men in Black? 

383
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:41,559
Still working on the alien
affirmative action program.

384
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:43,879
That's not what you promised me.

385
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,085
- You're breaking up.
-Zed? Hello? 

386
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:49,685
- I'll call you back.
-I could be Agent Em. Zed, you... 

387
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:54,960
I think Earth might be in a bad way.
You're the only one that could save it.

388
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:58,087
- Well, neither rain, sleet, snow... 
- Good man.

389
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:02,003
Get him armed and up to speed
and over to deneuralyzation.

390
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,198
- Frank?
- Yeah?

391
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:07,207
I'm gonna need them together
on this one.

392
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:11,204
I need an assistant. It's not
field work, but you get dental.

393
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,802
Dental?

394
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,089
The most advanced technologies from
all over the universe are in this room.

395
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:18,249
The most advanced technologies from
all over the universe are in this room.

396
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:19,209
The most advanced technologies from
all over the universe are in this room.

397
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:20,169
What's this?

398
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,129
What's this?

399
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,842
All is lost! All is lost!

400
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:27,368
Don't touch that!

401
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,086
I didn't do anything.

402
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:33,286
Hands in your pockets.

403
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,399
Your favourite weapon.

404
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:49,244
- That?
- Yep.

405
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:51,720
- Let's go put it on.
- What?

406
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:54,119
The last suit you'll ever wear.

407
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,802
Again.

408
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:03,883
The deneuralyzer.

409
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:08,321
Magneto-energy will surge
through your brain...

410
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:12,926
...unlocking information that could
hold the key to Earth's very survival.

411
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:15,649
Okay. What's that thing?

412
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:18,880
The deneuralyzer.

413
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,928
Welcome to planet Earth.
There are some rules and regulations.

414
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:31,408
Go out only at night.

415
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:35,642
If you must go out during the daylight,
only the East Village.

416
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:41,607
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

417
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:48,202
Name and planet of origin?

418
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:51,964
Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn.
Kaluth system.

419
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,763
- Any fruits or vegetables?
- Yeah, two heads of cabbage.

420
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:57,918
Reason for visit?

421
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:01,445
Education. I want to learn
how to be an underwear model.

422
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:04,248
They told me I've got real potential.

423
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,407
Help! Heart attack!

424
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:10,962
Clear!

425
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:14,080
Wake up, champ!

426
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:22,445
- Oh, jeez.
-Lockdown. Code 101.

427
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,200
Lockdown. 

428
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,603
This is not good. This is not good.

429
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,887
- Breach! We're being flushed.
- Flushed?

430
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:41,446
- Ever been to a water park?
- I don't know.

431
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,163
Flushed.

432
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,528
Yeah, man, back when you was an agent,
you loved getting flushed.

433
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:25,126
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd
be like, " Flush me, Jay. Flush me."

434
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:26,927
I'd be like, " No."

435
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,922
You can't quit on me.

436
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:32,887
I save the world, you tell me
why I stare at the stars.

437
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:34,562
Cool.

438
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:37,449
- Hop in.
- Hop in what?

439
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,409
- Hop in.
- Hop in what?

440
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,768
Does that come standard?

441
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:49,888
It came with a black dude,
but he kept getting pulled over.

442
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:56,965
I could rule this place
with the right set of mammary glands.

443
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,842
Trapped like rats...

444
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:00,564
...in a Chia Pet.

445
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:03,197
Computer, surveillance MiB.

446
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,561
MiB's locked down.

447
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:15,039
Computer, magnify. Times 10.

448
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:17,926
Communicator. Frank.

449
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,439
- Jay, where are you?
-We got flushed. 

450
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:22,679
- MiB 's code 101.
- Yeah, who did it?

451
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:25,682
Some hot-looking biker chick.
Want me to tail her?

452
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:30,525
- Stay where you are. I'll be in touch.
- Stay where I am. Easy for you to say.

453
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:32,008
- Find Kay?
- Neuralyzed.

454
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:34,683
- Not active. Civilian.
- What?

455
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:35,838
- He was...
- Here.

456
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,283
- To get...
- Deneuralyzed.

457
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:41,806
- Memory's shot. But we'll find him.
- Don't put anything in our ears.

458
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:43,678
What?

459
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,205
What do you make of that?
Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?

460
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:49,963
- Yeah, a smile.
- Is that the only deneuralyzer?

461
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:52,962
Officially. The plans leaked out
on the Internet.

462
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:55,040
Computer, Internet.

463
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:56,961
Deneuralyzer.

464
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,726
Perfect. It's an old friend.

465
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,165
Jay, ain't seen you in a while.

466
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,923
Did you peep that drop-top thing
out front?

467
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,125
My business is banging, dog.

468
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,840
You gotta check out the website.
It's Jeebsie dot...

469
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:23,045
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?

470
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,121
We need the deneuralyzer.

471
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:28,486
- You're kidding.
- The metre's running, Jeebs.

472
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,959
Do you remember me?

473
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:35,485
Can't say I do.
I'm good with faces.

474
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:37,687
I think I'd remember that.

475
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:40,805
The great Kay's a neutral.

476
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:45,121
You're between me and my memories.
Do you have this deneuralyzer or not?

477
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,563
No.

478
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:49,082
Fresh out.

479
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,841
Can't help you.

480
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,328
Don't got it.

481
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:07,358
Even if I did, if it doesn't work,
he dies, you blow my head off.

482
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:11,408
If it does, I've brought back Kay,
who, for fun, blows my head off.

483
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:13,400
So, what's my incentive?

484
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:17,728
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs
next to the snow blowers.

485
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:24,161
Alien prisoners released, 
armed and ready for your orders. 

486
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,639
Prisoners of MiB,
the scum of the universe.

487
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,607
Now it's the scum's turn.

488
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:32,078
I'm in a jam,
so I'll make this simple.

489
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:35,799
I need the Light of Zartha,
and Kay knows where it is.

490
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:38,199
Whoever brings Kay to me gets Earth.

491
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:41,520
Find a deneuralyzer.
They want his memory back.

492
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,441
Check.

493
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,568
Now.

494
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,720
Jarra, good to see you.

495
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:56,326
Okay, that should do it.

496
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,687
If I could have your attention
while we go over the safety procedures.

497
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:03,283
Keep your hands inside the vehicle.

498
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,407
lf, during the ride,
you become disoriented...

499
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:09,129
...there's nothing we can do about it.

500
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:12,878
Have you removed all your jewellry?

501
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:16,718
- Are you allergic to shellfish?
- Jeebs!

502
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,562
Right, then!
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

503
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,202
Have you used this?

504
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:31,038
I used it to make some hot-air popcorn.
That's about it.

505
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:34,007
Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n!

506
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,328
Perfect.

507
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,405
- You're back.
- No.

508
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:46,641
- How'd you know his head grows back?
- It grows back?

509
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:52,803
Real nice. Okay, that's the last time
I help out a friend.

510
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:57,558
- Kay, you remember anything?
- Goodbye.

511
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,208
- Kay!
- Kay, wait!

512
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,399
I never got the updated software.
Still working off the 6.0.

513
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,446
Your brain needs to reboot.

514
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:07,883
Give it a minute.

515
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:09,402
Kay!

516
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:12,649
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

517
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:14,719
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

518
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:19,201
All those years of loyalty and trust,
respect for one another.

519
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:22,797
Right over there!

520
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,644
- Where's Kay?
- He's not here! He went...

521
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:30,046
Kay's retired. I'm his
trigger-happy replacement.

522
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:33,599
Right in the pie hole.
Now nothing's gonna taste right.

523
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:36,158
- Lower your weapon.
- No.

524
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,838
Jay, how are you, boo-boo?

525
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:46,569
- These guys really need Kay.
- He's a neutral.

526
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:50,244
- Tell me something we don't know.
- Yeah, tell me something...

527
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:51,967
I am so sorry.

528
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,040
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

529
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:59,128
If I don't bring Kay back to MiB,
Serleena's gonna kick my ass.

530
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:01,280
- Now, where is he?
- Where is who?

531
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:03,883
You don't look too good.

532
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,406
Yeah, and you look like crap.

533
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,842
I take that back. He look like crap.

534
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:16,160
- Bend him!
- Bend him.

535
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:18,081
Wait, don't bend him.

536
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:56,047
Damn decent of you.

537
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:57,837
Don't mention it.

538
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:20,522
- I'm gonna be sick.
- You don't wanna do that.

539
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:24,568
- Fellas, I think he's telling the truth.
- Then he's no good to us.

540
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:29,687
- Didn't I teach you anything, kid?
- Pineal eye!

541
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:33,761
Go for the mosh tendrils!

542
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:38,409
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.

543
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:38,889
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.

544
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,849
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.

545
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:46,238
- You were in a tight spot.
- I handled it.

546
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:49,128
- You need a partner.
- I had one. Job got too tough.

547
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:51,519
I'm back. You got some dust
on your coat.

548
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:53,441
So you got your memory back.

549
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:55,998
- What the hell is going on?
- Don't know.

550
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:58,524
- The Light of Zartha?
- Never heard of it.

551
00:42:58,689 --> 00:42:59,678
Cool.

552
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:05,119
You don't remember
the Light of Zartha?

553
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:07,849
Must've neuralyzed myself
to keep it from myself.

554
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:11,160
- Good plan. What you doing?
- I do the driving.

555
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:13,240
- Wait, no. Whoa.
- I remember that.

556
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:17,163
What you remember is you used
to drive that old, busted jawn.

557
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:20,287
I drive the new hotness.

558
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:23,919
Old and busted, new hotness.

559
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:34,525
Old busted hotness.

560
00:43:34,889 --> 00:43:37,449
- Serleena, please.
- Been a long time, Zed.

561
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:41,124
I'm just touched you remembered me.
Makes me fuzzy all over.

562
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:44,486
Never forget a pretty
whatever you are.

563
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:48,247
Zed?

564
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:50,201
Zed? Look at you.

565
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:53,247
Twenty-five years,
and you're still such a looker.

566
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:55,047
Cut out the meat and dairy.

567
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:58,884
And you, still a pile of squirmy
crap in a different wrapper.

568
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:02,724
So feisty.
Look, we both need the same thing.

569
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:06,968
Bring him in.

570
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:08,644
Don't think so.

571
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:12,643
What about the Light's secret?
If it's not off Earth by midnight...

572
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:16,085
...it self-destructs,
annihilating your little planet.

573
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:19,958
I lose, you lose.
I win, everything keeps spinning.

574
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:24,163
You don't want the Light on Earth
any more than I do.

575
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:28,287
All right, Serleena.

576
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:31,286
You win.

577
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:36,006
Zed? Is that you? 
I could be Agent Em. 

578
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:37,768
Zed. Hello? 

579
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:49,805
So feisty.

580
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:57,604
Fastest way back to MiB,
you take this right on 39th.

581
00:44:57,769 --> 00:44:59,282
Right here. Right.

582
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:03,041
Next right on 37th.

583
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:05,598
Right here. Right!

584
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:07,408
We're not going back.

585
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:12,438
Headquarters has been breached, man.
We need to peel caps and split wigs.

586
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,167
Not ready.

587
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:17,925
Look, you've been out for five years.
That's a long time.

588
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:21,047
I understand you're scared.
I'm a little scared too.

589
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:23,200
- I'm not scared.
- Me neither.

590
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:26,038
I just thought we was bonding.

591
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,762
You're acting like a rookie.
Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

592
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:34,888
- No wonder Zed brought me back.
- He did it because you messed up.

593
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:37,609
Your attitude makes for a
stressful environment.

594
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:41,682
Tell it to the hand.
Stressful is what we got back at MiB.

595
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:46,240
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB
in order to lure me back.

596
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:48,400
Into a trap.

597
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:51,037
Which is why we can't
bust in there, man.

598
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:54,087
We need a plan. Where we going?
Scene of the crime?

599
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:58,242
- You're the boss.
- Scene of the crime. That's a left.

600
00:46:00,649 --> 00:46:03,004
I'll contact the witness.
We'll talk to her.

601
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:06,286
Things have changed.
We used to neuralyze witnesses.

602
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:09,241
See, originally, I'd...

603
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:14,521
No, I was going to...
I interrogated her.

604
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,529
- And neuralyzed her.
- What?

605
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:16,279
- And neuralyzed her.
- What?

606
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:21,603
MiB code 773II- 1 clearly states
that all civilian personnel...

607
00:46:22,569 --> 00:46:24,002
- Drop that weapon!
- No!

608
00:46:24,169 --> 00:46:25,727
Jay, I'm... I'm sorry.

609
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:28,687
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.

610
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:31,364
Kay, my partner.
Laura, the witness.

611
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:32,644
Pleasure.

612
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:38,240
Thanks for sending those agents over
to keep an eye on me last night.

613
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:40,320
MiB procedural code 594-B...

614
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:43,526
...states that MiB personnel
shall never be used...

615
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:48,809
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here.
I assume the perp was over here.

616
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:50,482
Ben.

617
00:46:50,649 --> 00:46:53,368
- Was he 5'7", thinning hair?
- You knew him?

618
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,919
Nope. Never seen him before
in my life.

619
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:58,887
That is a hell of a fish.

620
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:02,721
Wait a minute.

621
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:08,968
You left yourself clues?

622
00:47:09,129 --> 00:47:13,042
In case I was deneuralyzed because
my replacement couldn't handle it.

623
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:17,680
If the joker that had got deneuralyzed
hadn't created the situation...

624
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:19,123
Boys.

625
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:23,722
All right. You pointing at something.

626
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:29,048
Excuse me.

627
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:32,042
The astronaut.

628
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:34,724
Jay?

629
00:47:35,169 --> 00:47:37,364
Okay, all right. He's pointing... 

630
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:39,406
He's like... 

631
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:43,807
Who would stack boxes like this?

632
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:47,644
A box stacker who's not stacking boxes.
He's leaving clues.

633
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:49,242
It's an arrow.

634
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,359
- Jay?
- You're slowing me down, slick.

635
00:47:55,529 --> 00:47:59,044
Whatever we're looking for
is in these cabinets, right here.

636
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:03,327
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

637
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:08,959
I hope I'm not slowing you down.

638
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:12,083
Good work, partner. Yeah.

639
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:15,047
- We gotta figure out where it goes.
- I know where.

640
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:19,328
- No. Not yet.
- MiB code 773 clearly says...

641
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:22,561
I know the code,
but she might be important to me.

642
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:25,518
To us. Well, for help.
To help us later.

643
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,763
Well, she can't stay here.
They'll be back.

644
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,998
- You can stay with friends of mine.
- People like you?

645
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:36,158
Kind of.

646
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:37,808
Jay!

647
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:40,358
- Low bridge!
- What's going on, man?

648
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:43,680
Hey, what's happening, fellas?
MiB is code 101.

649
00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:45,568
- Bad.
- Very bad.

650
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:49,608
- I need your help. This is Laura.
- Laura!

651
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:51,327
Easy, easy!

652
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:52,478
They're worms.

653
00:48:52,649 --> 00:48:55,846
Once you go worm,
that's what you'll yearn.

654
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:59,206
- That's what they say. They just:
- I've dated worse.

655
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:02,203
They're suspended
for stealing from duty-free.

656
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:05,042
- We were framed.
- Zed's wormophobic.

657
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,437
- Kay!
- You're back!

658
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,248
- They said you were dead.
- We're double-parked.

659
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:11,206
Laura's very important to me.

660
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:15,359
To us. To the stuff...
Me and you, the stuff we're doing.

661
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:19,282
- Keep an eye on her.
- I'll keep both on her.

662
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:20,438
No problem!

663
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:25,242
- Why don't you sit here?
- Like you got a shot.

664
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:26,524
Hey, shut up!

665
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:32,163
My communicator, in case you need it.

666
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:37,207
- Nice move.
- Okay.

667
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:43,358
- Just watch out for Neeble.
- Which one's Neeble?

668
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:47,845
- Which one of y'all is Neeble?
- Yo, mama!

669
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:52,048
Him, right there. It's fine.
Everything's straight. It's safe.

670
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:54,120
Don't fall asleep.

671
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:57,401
Twister!

672
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,800
Run over your plan one more time.
I'm struggling with it.

673
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:07,644
You neuralyzed memory of the Light
but left yourself clues.

674
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:08,798
Right.

675
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:13,838
Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria
which opens a locker at Grand Central.

676
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,922
- In the locker, we'll find another clue.
- That's the plan.

677
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:23,685
- I like to keep my enemies confused.
- We're all confused.

678
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:30,041
- Are you gonna slow me down?
- Your brain's working on old software.

679
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:32,325
Why don't you go grab us some coffee?

680
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:35,845
Sure. How do you take it?
Black? Couple cubes of kiss my ass?

681
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:39,285
I don't know what's in there,
so step back.

682
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:42,759
Kay, for real, man.
Open the damn locker.

683
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,444
Kay!
He's back! The light giver!

684
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:51,998
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!

685
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:56,078
Oh, Kay, can you see
By the dawn's early light

686
00:50:56,249 --> 00:50:58,968
You are the man who would be king
of the train locker.

687
00:50:59,129 --> 00:51:00,118
Praise Kay!

688
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:04,885
Oh, good and gentle townsfolk
of Locker C-18...

689
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:08,485
...did I leave anything here?
- Yes. The timekeeper.

690
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,209
Left to illuminate our streets
and hearts.

691
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:15,647
- I've been looking everywhere for this.
- Merciful one! The clock tower!

692
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:18,403
I got y'all, it's cool.
Check this out.

693
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:21,681
Titanium case.
Waterproof to over 300 metres.

694
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:24,877
- That's banging.
- Who are you, stranger?

695
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:26,847
Jay.

696
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:29,365
All hail Jay!
All hail Jay!

697
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:31,725
Oh, Jay, can you see

698
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,847
- Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of...
- Come on.

699
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:37,439
- Wait! The commandments!
- The tablet!

700
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:40,487
The tablet! The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!

701
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:44,528
We have lived by its word, and peace
has reigned throughout our world.

702
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:47,965
Pass it on to others! So that they too
may be enlightened!

703
00:51:48,129 --> 00:51:49,721
Be kind! Rewind!

704
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:51,641
Reconcile your past...

705
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:54,358
...in order to move into your future!

706
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,804
Two for one every Wednesday.

707
00:51:56,969 --> 00:52:00,166
Give twice as much as ye receive
on our most sacred of days.

708
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:01,438
Every Wednesday.

709
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:05,284
Large adult entertainment section
in the back.

710
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:10,042
That's just nasty.

711
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:12,999
- What's with the video card?
- Don't know.

712
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:14,602
- The watch?
- A reminder.

713
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,088
- Of what?
- Can't remember.

714
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:17,238
Guess.

715
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:21,004
I guess we have till midnight.
59 minutes to figure it out.

716
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:27,288
Look. Here's an idea. Let's stop
chasing butt-backwards clues...

717
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:31,442
...get a couple fission carbonisers
and get our headquarters back.

718
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:33,679
It's all about to make sense, kid.

719
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:35,521
Is this card valid?

720
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:40,804
- This card hasn't been used in years.
- I've been away on business.

721
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:43,199
- Billions of frequent flier miles.
- Try and use them.

722
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:47,203
I wanted to go to Cambodia. You can
get a lobster dinner for a dollar.

723
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:52,689
The airlines black out holidays.
It's a conspiracy, I'm sure, I mean...

724
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:55,443
Can you tell us anything
about the account?

725
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:57,680
You never checked out a tape.

726
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:01,046
You reserved one once,
but you never picked it up.

727
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:03,878
- Newton.
- There's a rat in the toilet.

728
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:08,167
It's all stopped up.
You're gonna have to pee in the sin...

729
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:14,087
- Still think I'm paranoid?
- Yeah.

730
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:20,042
Gentlemen, my name is Newton. I run
the place. Seen any aliens lately?

731
00:53:20,209 --> 00:53:24,282
- You need professional help.
- He's getting it. It's not working.

732
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:26,565
Okay, so, new case, huh?

733
00:53:26,729 --> 00:53:29,084
Episode 27, Light of Zartha.

734
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:31,797
Got it.

735
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:36,004
Jarra, it's a sin they've kept
a genius like you locked away.

736
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:40,003
Their agent Jay caught me siphoning
ozone to sell on the black market.

737
00:53:40,169 --> 00:53:42,000
They're touchy about global warming.

738
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:45,605
I need a spacecraft that can travel
300 times the speed of light.

739
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:47,646
I'll give you
whatever you want.

740
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,243
- Give me Jay. We'll call it even.
- Groovy.

741
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:53,324
You've got till midnight.

742
00:53:57,329 --> 00:54:00,799
Gatbot, I got a little
something special for you.

743
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:07,762
Newton? Newton, is that you?

744
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:10,318
Yes, Mom, I'm up here
with some friends.

745
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,002
I wanna have your baby.

746
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:14,205
Would you like some mini-pizza?

747
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:18,081
You guys want some mini-pizzas?
They're good.

748
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:21,286
They're like mini-bagels,
with pizza stuff on them.

749
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:24,168
She'll put a little fontina cheese on.

750
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:28,117
She has palsy, so she ends
up putting a lot of cheese on.

751
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,605
No, thanks, we're cool.

752
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:35,997
All right.

753
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,968
Over here.

754
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:44,723
This is it.

755
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:47,204
Finally some hard evidence.

756
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:50,998
Gentlemen, before I play the tape,
one question:

757
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:53,287
What's up with anal probing?

758
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:57,158
Aliens travel billions of light
years just to check out our...

759
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,524
Boy, move.

760
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:02,442
Okay. Just a question.

761
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:06,885
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"...

762
00:55:07,049 --> 00:55:10,724
... from one of their files
that doesn't exist. 

763
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:16,879
1978. Devastating war of Zartha
had raged on for 50 years. 

764
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:18,721
Looks like Spielberg's work.

765
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:22,643
But the Zarthans had a great treasure, 
the Light of Zartha. 

766
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:26,040
A source of power so awesome, 
it alone...

767
00:55:26,209 --> 00:55:29,645
... could mean victory and restoration
for the Zarthans... 

768
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:34,087
... or complete annihilation, if it
fell into the hands of the Kylothians. 

769
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:38,162
A group of Zarthans made the journey, 
led by the Keeper of the Light... 

770
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:39,728
Lauranna.

771
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:42,160
... Princess Lauranna. 

772
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:46,840
Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black
to help her hide the Light on Earth. 

773
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:49,284
But they could not intervene.

774
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,598
No.

775
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:52,358
It was night.

776
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:55,842
And it was raining.

777
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:57,842
You've been very wise.

778
00:55:58,009 --> 00:56:02,400
Kay, please. If Serleena tak es
the Light, it's the end of our world. 

779
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:06,206
If we extend protection for the Light
beyond Earth... 

780
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:09,566
... we put Earth in jeopardy. 
We must remain neutral. 

781
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:12,203
- Where is it?
- We're neutral, remember?

782
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:14,525
If you want it, go get it.

783
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:20,002
No!

784
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:50,164
And so never knowing it happened... 

785
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:53,127
... the people of Earth
were once again saved... 

786
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:56,326
... by a secret society of protectors... 

787
00:56:57,369 --> 00:56:58,961
I shouldn't have.

788
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:02,244
You never sent it off the planet.

789
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:04,642
You hid it here.

790
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:07,922
The worm guys.

791
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,602
Are you one of Newton's
friends from therapy?

792
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:19,081
- Yes, ma'am, I am. Look here, please.
- Would you like some mini-pizz...?

793
00:57:20,049 --> 00:57:21,607
A neuralyz...

794
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:26,045
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.

795
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,404
Joints look like they pick up cable.

796
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:32,960
Second, take her to Cambodia. Get
her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.

797
00:57:33,129 --> 00:57:36,326
Third, the second y'all get back
from Cambodia...

798
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:39,367
...move your bum ass
out of your mom's house.

799
00:57:39,529 --> 00:57:41,838
- Let's go.
- Boy, you like 40 years old.

800
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:44,204
- Agent Jay?
- All right, all right.

801
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:48,203
And there ain't no such thing
as aliens or Men in Black.

802
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:57,241
- You wanna go to Cambodia?
- Yeah.

803
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:00,642
Hey, Mom?

804
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:03,200
Communicator, Jay.

805
00:58:04,049 --> 00:58:06,722
- Laura, it's me.
- Jay, we're playing Twister.

806
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:08,641
What's up, Jay?

807
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:11,926
- Quit touching my butt!
- I thought it was your face.

808
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:15,001
They're good at this.
They don't have spines.

809
00:58:15,169 --> 00:58:18,002
They were telling me about Oprah,
from Chicago.

810
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:21,286
Maybe landed in Chicago.

811
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:24,323
- Are you wearing a bracelet?
-Yeah. 

812
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:25,478
Is it glowing?

813
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:33,287
- It's never done that before.
- We're on our way.

814
00:58:33,449 --> 00:58:34,882
Communicator, Frank.

815
00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:40,488
Deactivate the lockdown. We're headed
to the worm guys. We found the Light. 

816
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:43,288
Got it, Jay. Scrad?

817
00:58:43,449 --> 00:58:44,518
Bitch.

818
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:46,520
Why didn't you say I love you?

819
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:51,126
- He's a dog. I don't even like him.
- No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

820
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:54,326
That's why you didn't neuralyze her.
You got emotionally involved.

821
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,801
- Like you did with Lauranna?
- I put the entire planet in danger.

822
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:02,086
I don't want to see you
making my mistakes.

823
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:03,762
Whatever, man.

824
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:09,118
Laura?

825
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:16,798
Damn!

826
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:22,926
Never stood half a chance.

827
00:59:24,129 --> 00:59:25,164
Oh, boy.

828
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:28,205
That's gonna leave a scar.

829
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,281
- Where's Laura?
- MiB headquarters.

830
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:34,441
- Some dumb two-headed guy.
- They got the bracelet.

831
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:37,282
We got 39 minutes.
You guys...

832
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,519
...pull yourselves together.

833
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:41,244
Damn.

834
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:44,560
That's feeling better.

835
00:59:44,729 --> 00:59:47,368
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Let me grab my drink!

836
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:49,440
Serleena has the bracelet.
Why take Laura?

837
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:50,724
She also wants me.

838
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:54,086
- What's the book say?
- We're off book. I say split some wigs.

839
00:59:54,249 --> 00:59:56,365
- We need wig-splitting weapons.
- Got them.

840
01:00:01,689 --> 01:00:04,647
Paw Paw's coming to visit me.
Hello, Paw Paw. 

841
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,687
Paw Paw and ZuZu love
to see what's going on... 

842
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:11,249
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

843
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:11,689
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

844
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:12,169
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

845
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,249
Nice place.

846
01:00:16,249 --> 01:00:17,364
Nice place.

847
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:30,557
See you.

848
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,642
You did not see a room
full of weapons or four aliens.

849
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:45,448
You will cherish and love each other
for the rest of your lives.

850
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:49,397
Which could be the next 28 minutes,
so get to loving and cherishing.

851
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:52,129
And she can stay up
as late as she want...

852
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:54,803
...and have cookies
and candy and stuff.

853
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,365
Four minutes to launch. 

854
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:09,360
Four minutes to launch. 

855
01:01:10,049 --> 01:01:13,928
-Your ship is ready. 
- Good. Send it to Kyloth now.

856
01:01:17,129 --> 01:01:18,323
Ready, guys?

857
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:20,605
Lock and load, baby.

858
01:01:20,769 --> 01:01:22,361
- You ready, kid?
- Kid?

859
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:25,441
I saved the world
from a Kreelon invasion.

860
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:29,602
They're the Backstreet Boys of the
universe. They throw snowballs?

861
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:31,728
Know what you're doing?

862
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:34,767
I'm about to attack one
of the most feared aliens...

863
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:38,080
...with four worms and a mailman.
Let's make it hot.

864
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:39,443
No, no, wait!

865
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:47,199
A code 101 lockdown!

866
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:51,203
The building gets pressurized.
Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.

867
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:53,325
Yeah, you knew.
Front and centre, worms!

868
01:01:53,489 --> 01:01:54,717
You got it.

869
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:06,408
It's about time you guys got here.
That lady is causing all kinds of hell.

870
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:29,006
Yummy. Someone I need to eat.

871
01:02:29,209 --> 01:02:32,963
Get to the launch pad. The bracelet
shows the departure point.

872
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:35,040
- Do not come back for me.
- What?

873
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,803
Do not come back for me.

874
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:45,802
- Worm guys, give me some cover fire.
- Too scared, can't move.

875
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,238
Go!

876
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:09,327
- Limber.
- Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.

877
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:14,768
- Shut off power so they can't take off.
- Can't. Too scared.

878
01:03:15,689 --> 01:03:18,203
- That way.
- Away from the bullets.

879
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:19,927
No problem.

880
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:35,800
Nice to see you again, Kay.

881
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:41,845
-Three minutes to launch. 
- Jay!

882
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:44,125
Three minutes to launch. 

883
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:46,008
Hello, Jay. Long time.

884
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:48,558
Jarra! What's up, man?
You look great.

885
01:03:48,729 --> 01:03:51,243
- What's it been? Five years?
- And 42 days.

886
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:53,639
You count every one
when you're locked away.

887
01:03:53,689 --> 01:03:54,409
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

888
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:54,889
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

889
01:03:54,889 --> 01:03:55,849
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

890
01:03:55,849 --> 01:03:56,329
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

891
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:56,809
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

892
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:57,769
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

893
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:01,437
Over our dead titanium bodies!

894
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:03,042
Two minutes.

895
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,161
Let's play this one by ear.

896
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:17,922
- I should have vaporized you before.
- You really did love Lauranna.

897
01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:19,841
Didn't you, Kay?

898
01:04:20,169 --> 01:04:22,080
You silly little man.

899
01:04:49,169 --> 01:04:51,160
Two minutes to launch. 

900
01:04:53,009 --> 01:04:54,408
Just go, I'll be fine!

901
01:04:55,169 --> 01:04:57,558
What you talking about?
I'm winning.

902
01:04:57,729 --> 01:05:01,608
Jarra, you are under arrest
for being that ugly...

903
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:04,442
...and for making that many copies.
Surrender!

904
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:06,401
I want him in pieces.

905
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:11,199
Jarra Jr. Is going, going...

906
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:13,601
...gone!

907
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:28,197
- Rectum.
- Damn near killed him!

908
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:30,087
Never get tired of that one.

909
01:05:30,249 --> 01:05:32,763
- Where do we shut off the power?
- Don't know.

910
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:42,278
- I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute.
- No, he won't.

911
01:05:48,169 --> 01:05:50,285
Down to one now, Jarra!

912
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,564
Thirty seconds to launch. 

913
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,599
Fifteen seconds to launch. 

914
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:16,445
Ten seconds to launch. 

915
01:06:16,729 --> 01:06:17,923
Eight. 

916
01:06:18,089 --> 01:06:19,363
Seven. 

917
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:20,848
Six. 

918
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:22,283
Five.

919
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:23,518
Four. 

920
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:24,758
Three.

921
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:25,998
Two. 

922
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:29,280
Launch terminated. 

923
01:06:29,729 --> 01:06:33,039
- What did you mean, leave you?
- Well, he took your gun.

924
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:35,928
Cracked your head.
Slammed you across the room.

925
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:40,002
- Half the time you were on your back.
- Look, that's how I fight.

926
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:43,044
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

927
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:46,167
You've wasted 25 years
of my time, and for what?

928
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:50,248
The total annihilation of Zartha.
All because you went mushy.

929
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:54,482
I'll give you one last chance
to surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

930
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:58,039
- What are you gonna do to stop me?
- Not me. Him.

931
01:07:00,009 --> 01:07:02,204
Your flight's been cancelled.

932
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:12,881
Shut down power. Shut down power.
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing... 

933
01:07:13,049 --> 01:07:14,164
Yeah.

934
01:07:16,129 --> 01:07:18,324
- Worms!
- Sorry.

935
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:25,729
- Give me the bracelet.
- I'm going with you.

936
01:07:25,889 --> 01:07:28,483
Everybody in the car.
Everybody.

937
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:43,962
This bracelet is what
everybody's been after?

938
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:45,767
It's often something small.

939
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:49,444
It's not the Light.
It tells us the departure point.

940
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:51,725
If we don't get there in 11 minutes...

941
01:07:51,889 --> 01:07:54,847
...that bracelet will go nuclear
and destroy Earth.

942
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:56,408
What?!

943
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:57,958
Hello.

944
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:00,441
- Wait.
- I know what I'm doing.

945
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:16,244
Damn.

946
01:08:17,769 --> 01:08:20,841
- Modified to hyper-speed!
- Seat belts.

947
01:08:24,089 --> 01:08:25,078
What's that?

948
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:28,565
At hyper-speed, you have
to use the navigational stalk.

949
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:37,518
Toggle switches for the ailerons.
Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

950
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:43,481
I just want you to know...

951
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:45,719
Hold on to that for one second.

952
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,721
Computer, worms.

953
01:08:50,929 --> 01:08:55,719
I said, " Bitch, if you don't want me
to kick your skinny Zone Diet ass...

954
01:08:55,889 --> 01:08:59,598
...turn around and exit the planet."
-Frank, where are you? 

955
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:01,168
Main hall, egg display.

956
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:04,082
We're taking fire.
Kay pushed the red button.

957
01:09:04,249 --> 01:09:07,924
Computer at MiB can destroy
bogey. I'll walk you through it.

958
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:14,600
Jay? Frank. You were the best darn
partner a Remoolian could ever have.

959
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:16,597
Godspeed.

960
01:09:18,009 --> 01:09:18,998
Frank? Frank?

961
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:22,529
Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.

962
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:28,682
- It is not automatic piloting.
- He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.

963
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:32,125
- I could use a steering wheel!
- This is what we got.

964
01:09:33,849 --> 01:09:36,647
- Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?
- What's that?

965
01:09:36,809 --> 01:09:38,288
You know what? Move.

966
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:41,799
That is not the navigational stalk!

967
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,200
Okay, straight down.

968
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,082
Idiots.

969
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:13,448
Subway may not be the best place
to lose her.

970
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:17,122
- Where is he?
- He?

971
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:18,717
Jeff. Hang on!

972
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:21,918
Oops.

973
01:10:23,049 --> 01:10:24,164
Teeth.

974
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:59,567
Running out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?

975
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:02,162
Right here.

976
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,159
- What?
- What, I'm the Light?

977
01:11:06,009 --> 01:11:08,523
- No. No way.
- You have a planet to save.

978
01:11:08,809 --> 01:11:11,164
You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria.

979
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:15,117
Two days ago, I was running a post
office. You are who you are.

980
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:18,247
Laura, you are the Light.

981
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:22,004
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.

982
01:11:22,169 --> 01:11:24,763
The power is within you
to save a planet.

983
01:11:24,929 --> 01:11:29,639
I protected you until it was
your time. Your time is now.

984
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:36,958
You will save a world.
You know things before they happen.

985
01:11:37,129 --> 01:11:39,040
- I'm a Libra.
- You're Zarthan.

986
01:11:39,209 --> 01:11:43,282
- When you get sad, it rains.
- Lots of people get sad when it rains.

987
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:46,163
It rains because you're sad, baby.

988
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:38,722
It's not fair.

989
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:45,967
Never is.

990
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:49,207
We are who we are...

991
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:51,758
...even if we sometimes forget.

992
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,277
Jeff, I am so not in the mood for you!

993
01:13:03,449 --> 01:13:05,087
Get back in the subway!
Now!

994
01:13:11,369 --> 01:13:12,563
That's not good.

995
01:13:14,369 --> 01:13:15,848
Wait! No!

996
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:18,483
Jay!

997
01:13:19,209 --> 01:13:23,441
I cannot emphasize strongly enough how
much we need you on that transport.

998
01:13:24,809 --> 01:13:27,004
Laura! You have to go!

999
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:28,728
Oh, jeez.

1000
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:33,362
Go. He's fine.
He does this all the time.

1001
01:13:34,449 --> 01:13:35,598
Nope!

1002
01:13:37,769 --> 01:13:40,567
About to lay the smackdown
on your candy ass.

1003
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:43,159
Laura! It's your destiny!

1004
01:13:43,409 --> 01:13:45,240
I was talking, Kay!

1005
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,759
Hey! No biting.

1006
01:13:50,569 --> 01:13:52,844
If you don't go, we all die.

1007
01:13:55,929 --> 01:13:58,397
You're just as beautiful
as your mother.

1008
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:06,999
Kay? A little help?

1009
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:19,958
Kay?

1010
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:24,043
Might I suggest a bigger gun?

1011
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:51,002
- Kid?
- Yeah.

1012
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:54,646
- Thanks for bringing me back.
- No problem.

1013
01:14:55,249 --> 01:14:56,728
Why didn't you tell me?

1014
01:14:56,889 --> 01:14:58,880
Would you have let her go?

1015
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:23,158
So, what's it like on the outside?
Not doing this every day?

1016
01:15:23,329 --> 01:15:24,728
It's nice.

1017
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:28,518
Sleep late on the weekends.
Watch the Weather Channel.

1018
01:15:31,889 --> 01:15:33,925
I did miss this city.

1019
01:15:35,129 --> 01:15:38,485
So Laura is Princess Lauranna's
daughter.

1020
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:43,560
- Did y'all...?
- MiB's a mess. Let's go, kid.

1021
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:45,523
Let's go?

1022
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:49,762
Thousands of people in New York
and New Jersey saw our little event.

1023
01:15:49,929 --> 01:15:54,127
Plan needs to be thought out.
Plan needs to be cool. What you...?

1024
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:00,566
Kid, I'll get you trained yet.

1025
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:02,208
I want one of those.

1026
01:16:02,369 --> 01:16:03,563
Damn!

1027
01:16:08,209 --> 01:16:09,358
- Hey.
- Hey.

1028
01:16:09,529 --> 01:16:11,838
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1029
01:16:12,009 --> 01:16:16,366
We've all been there. The girl is gone
and it hurts. Wanna talk?

1030
01:16:16,529 --> 01:16:17,962
- No.
- I can help.

1031
01:16:18,129 --> 01:16:19,118
No.

1032
01:16:19,289 --> 01:16:20,278
Still sulking?

1033
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:21,438
- No.
- Yeah.

1034
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:25,682
You miss her. It happens to all of us.
I knew this hot young thing.

1035
01:16:25,849 --> 01:16:29,285
When our bodies were in the positions
of the Kamasutra...

1036
01:16:29,449 --> 01:16:30,723
Zed!

1037
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,926
Come on, man! Damn!

1038
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:34,927
I'll tell you about dames.

1039
01:16:35,089 --> 01:16:38,525
They say they want to be scratched,
but they really want:

1040
01:16:38,729 --> 01:16:40,287
Hey! Frank.

1041
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:43,049
What? Still sitting shiva?
Want my advice?

1042
01:16:43,209 --> 01:16:45,040
No. No advice.

1043
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:46,722
No talking.

1044
01:16:47,289 --> 01:16:48,517
Hell, no.

1045
01:16:48,689 --> 01:16:51,249
Fellas, I swear, I'm fine.

1046
01:16:52,169 --> 01:16:54,888
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!

1047
01:16:55,329 --> 01:16:58,799
- I brought them from Grand Central.
- Why put them in my locker?

1048
01:16:58,969 --> 01:17:01,199
I thought it would put things
in perspective.

1049
01:17:01,369 --> 01:17:03,963
It's kind of sad.
We need to let them out.

1050
01:17:04,129 --> 01:17:07,166
They need to know the world
is bigger than that.

1051
01:17:07,329 --> 01:17:08,762
Still a rookie.

1052
01:17:11,849 --> 01:17:12,964
Whoa.
