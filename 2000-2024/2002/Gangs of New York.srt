1
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,882
No, son... never.

2
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,285
The blood stays on the blade.

3
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,719
One day you'll understand.

4
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,464
Some of it
I half remember.

5
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,338
And the rest...

6
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,344
the rest, I took from dreams.

7
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,182
St. Michael, the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

8
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,516
Be our protector...

9
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,113
against the snares...

10
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,683
and the wickedness
of the devil.

11
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,854
Now, son... who's that?

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,862
St. Michael.

13
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,920
Who is it?

14
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,023
- St. Michael!
- And what did he do?

15
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,831
He cast Satan out of Paradise.

16
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,167
Good boy.

17
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,203
May God put the steel of
the Holy Spirit in your spine

18
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,373
and the love of the
Blessed Virgin in your heart.

19
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,606
Hey, boyo.

20
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,904
Johnny.

21
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,238
What's the battle?

22
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,008
Natives against
the Dead Rabbits.

23
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,173
Which are you?

24
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,774
What do you think?
Dead Rabbits.

25
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,525
Aaah!

26
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,431
Aaah! Aaah!

27
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,284
Well, well, Monk...

28
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,158
Are you with us or not?

29
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,959
For the last time, Vallon, I'm
with you if the money is right.

30
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,861
I'll give you ten per notch.

31
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,199
Ten?

32
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,740
You have my word.

33
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,178
Ten per notch?

34
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,737
<i>Per new notch.</i>

35
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,913
Then I'm your man.

36
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,029
Is this it, Priest?

37
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,724
The pope's new army?

38
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,428
A few crusty bitches
and a handful of ragtags?

39
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,166
Now, Bill, you swore this was
a battle between warriors,

40
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,401
not a bunch of Miss Nancys.

41
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,909
So warriors is what I brought.

42
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,110
The O'Connell Guards!

43
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,514
The Plug Uglies!

44
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,518
The Shirt Tails!

45
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,625
The Chichesters!

46
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,526
The Forty Thieves!

47
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,763
<i>Bene.</i>

48
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,313
On my challenge...

49
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,317
by the ancient laws
of combat...

50
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,582
we have met
at this chosen ground

51
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,146
to settle, for good and all,

52
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:42,320
who holds sway
over the Five Points...

53
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,831
us Natives, born rightwise

54
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,332
to this fine land...

55
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,370
or the foreign hordes
defiling it!

56
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,498
Yeah!

57
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,668
By the ancient laws of combat,

58
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,837
I accept the challenge
of the so-called Natives.

59
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,381
You plague our people
at every turn.

60
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,714
But from this day out,
you shall plague us no more.

61
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,378
For let it be known
that the hand

62
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,445
that tries to strike us
from this land

63
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,548
shall be swiftly cut down!

64
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,593
Yeah!

65
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,289
Then may the Christian Lord
guide my hand

66
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,628
against your Roman popery!

67
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,964
Prepare to receive
the true Lord!

68
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,094
Yeah!

69
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,067
Aaah!

70
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,276
Aaaaahhhh!

71
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,256
Priest!

72
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,396
Aaaaahhhh!

73
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,240
Look to me!

74
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,381
Who is this under my knife?!

75
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,917
Father, get up! Get up!

76
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,186
Where are you?

77
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,563
Oh, my son...

78
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,936
Don't never look away.

79
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,638
Soon be over, Priest.

80
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,882
Finish it.

81
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,954
Ugh!

82
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,900
You may need this
across the river.

83
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,644
Ears and noses will be
the trophies of the day.

84
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,588
But no hand shall touch him!

85
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,286
No hand shall touch him!

86
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,534
He'll cross over whole...

87
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,194
in honor.

88
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,103
Not before I get what's owed.

89
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,776
No!

90
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,009
It's fair...

91
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,484
a touch indelicate, but fair.

92
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,325
My sympathies.

93
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,860
What'll we do
with the boy?

94
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,524
Look at me.

95
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,672
Give him to the law.

96
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,765
See he gets a good education.

97
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,574
Okay, boy,
say goodbye to your father.

98
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,675
- Hey.
Hey!

99
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,611
Get him!

100
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,350
Don't let him get away!

101
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,517
Hurry! Come in here!

102
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,355
Aaah!

103
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,522
- Aaah!
- He's going downstairs.

104
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,208
Come here, boy!

105
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,806
You're going to
Hellgate, son!

106
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,317
There he is.
Let's get him.

107
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,320
Priest Vallon died
a noble death.

108
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:21,223
But his Dead Rabbits is done
and outlawed!

109
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,555
Let no one even speak their name
from this time on!

110
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,142
In this place,

111
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,480
you have grown
from a boy into a man...

112
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,985
put to death
the earthly things in you...

113
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,318
immorality, impurity...

114
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,325
passion, vengeance.

115
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,658
The Lord has forgiven you.

116
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,391
You also must forgive.

117
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,794
You go forth
to a country torn apart

118
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,838
by civil strife.

119
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,566
Thank you, Reverend.

120
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,012
Lend your hand to the work
that yet remains,

121
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,980
that this war may end,

122
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,176
and the plague of slavery

123
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,015
that brought this conflagration
down upon us

124
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,385
vanish forever...

125
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,515
from the Earth.

126
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,788
In the second year
of the great Civil War,

127
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,655
when the Irish Brigade
marched through the streets,

128
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,958
New York was a city
full of tribes...

129
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,657
war chiefs...

130
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,495
rich and poor.

131
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,159
Down with Lincoln!

132
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,533
Lincoln will make
all white men slaves!

133
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,663
It wasn't a city, really.

134
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,674
It was more a furnace

135
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:53,337
where a city, someday,
might be forged.

136
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,004
That's the spirit, boys.

137
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,844
Go off and die
for your blackie friends.

138
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,281
Down with
the abolitionists!

139
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,114
We should have run
a better man against Lincoln

140
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,448
when we had the chance.

141
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,614
New York should secede
from the Union!

142
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,454
He trying to say we're
no different than niggers?!

143
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,686
You ain't.

144
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,355
- Good evening, brother.
God save the Union!

145
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,193
There's the Union.

146
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,200
Go back to Africa, niggers!

147
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,496
Go back to Africa!

148
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,628
Leave him alone!
- We're free.

149
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,729
The angriest talk

150
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,296
was of the
new Conscription Act...

151
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,208
the first draft
in Union history.

152
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,711
No nig noggery here!

153
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,441
None!

154
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,044
Yeah!

155
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,714
"New York Tribune"!
Buy your "Tribune" here!

156
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,223
Join the Army, lads!

157
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,555
Three square meals a day
and good pay!

158
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,185
When the Irish came,

159
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,093
the city was in a fever.

160
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,132
Since the time
of the great famine,

161
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,895
they'd come streaming
off the boats.

162
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,061
And they got
a right warm welcome.

163
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,571
Go back to Ireland,
you dumb Micks!

164
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,232
You remember that,
you bog-Irish gyps!

165
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,570
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

166
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,611
I only came two hours

167
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,669
downriver from Hellgate.

168
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,342
But they all took me
for an immigrant. Why not?

169
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,681
There were a thousand different
accents in New York,

170
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,947
and to the Natives, you see...

171
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,682
It was all the same.

172
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,520
Seven curses of God on you,
you bastard!

173
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,355
Tammany's here to take
the chill off your soul

174
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,019
and the weight off your heart.

175
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,563
Welcome to America, son.

176
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,860
Your long,
arduous journey is over.

177
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,195
Go back
to your own country!

178
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,393
Vote Tammany!

179
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,528
America for Americans!

180
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,711
New York loved
William Tweed...

181
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,371
and hated him.

182
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,608
And those of us
trying to be thieves...

183
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,810
well, we couldn't help
but admire him.

184
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,718
Mr. Cutting, gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

185
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,881
- It's an honor.
Mr. Tweed.

186
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,686
Sir, please.

187
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,954
Excuse me!

188
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,723
I think
you're frightening them.

189
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,059
So?

190
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,225
Don't mind him.
He used to be an Irishman.

191
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,600
Ah, the Five Points...

192
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,502
Murderers' Alley...

193
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,165
Brickbat Mansion...

194
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,834
the Gates of Hell.

195
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,073
It was here
in this vile place.

196
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,980
Look upon the face
of this poor child.

197
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,711
She lives in squalor

198
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:18,313
in this godforsaken den
of vice and misery behind me.

199
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,188
Every year, the reformers came.

200
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,195
Every year,
the Points got worse...

201
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,787
as if it liked being dirty.

202
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,297
...degraded men and women.

203
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,527
Where am I going to go?!

204
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,535
Move! The Reverend
wants you out of here!

205
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,696
You can't do this!

206
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,069
Come on,
you filthy grubworm!

207
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,869
A glorious resurrection

208
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,137
will spring
from the filthy depths...

209
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,544
to which these miserable
creatures have fallen.

210
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,549
In God, they will find
their true home.

211
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,551
You may
or may not know, Bill,

212
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,553
that every day,
I go down to the waterfront

213
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,215
with hot soup for the Irish
as they come ashore.

214
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,623
It's part of building
a political base.

215
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,355
I've noticed you there.
You may have noticed me.

216
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,555
Indeed I have...

217
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,064
throwing torrents of pavers
and withering abuse

218
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,067
on every single person
who steps off those boats.

219
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,070
If only I had the guns,
I'd shoot every one of them

220
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,800
before they set foot
on American soil.

221
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,098
Mulberry Street...

222
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,933
and Worth...

223
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,099
Cross and Orange...

224
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,268
And Little Water.

225
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,279
Each of the Five Points
is a finger.

226
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,784
When I close my hand,
it becomes a fist.

227
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,285
And anytime that I wish,

228
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,151
I can turn it against you.

229
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,452
I understand, but we're talking
about different things.

230
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,389
I'm talking
about civic duty...

231
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,223
responsibilities
we owe to the people...

232
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,059
schools and hospitals,
sewers and utilities,

233
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,565
street construction,
repairs, and sweeping,

234
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,966
business licenses,
saloon licenses,

235
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,367
carting licenses...

236
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,584
St. Michael, the Archangel...

237
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,753
defend us in battle.

238
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,296
Be our protector against
the snares and the wickedness

239
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,422
of the devil.

240
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,491
Streetcars, ferries,
rubbish disposal...

241
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,230
There's a power of money
to be made in this city, Bill.

242
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,397
With your help...

243
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,930
the people must be made
to understand

244
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,170
that all these things
are best kept within,

245
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,270
what I like to call,
the Tammany family,

246
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,440
which is why I'm talking
about an alliance

247
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,450
between our two
great organizations.

248
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,679
You're talking
about muscle work.

249
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,742
That too.

250
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,550
Muscle to match our spirit!

251
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,420
You own the crushers.
Get them to do it.

252
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,891
The police? Oh, no.
Jesus, no.

253
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,396
The appearance of the law
must be upheld...

254
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,193
especially while
it's being broken.

255
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,508
Give me the strength
for what I must do.

256
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,914
Who are you?

257
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,088
- Ah!
Hey!

258
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,418
No.

259
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,949
I said, "Who are you?"
What are you doing here?

260
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,496
I just like it down here,
is all.

261
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,633
See what's
in his pockets, Jimmy.

262
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,074
Now, look, boys,
I really don't want a fight.

263
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,304
Don't want a fight?

264
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,438
Don't worry, son,
ain't gonna be much a fight.

265
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,246
Don't kill me.

266
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,890
Where'd you get that?

267
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,833
I told you
I didn't want to fight!

268
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,564
Why not?

269
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,265
Look how good you done.

270
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,581
You're the Priest's son,
aren't you?

271
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,413
You, get away from me,
understand?!

272
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,578
You don't remember me, do you?

273
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,645
I's the one tried to help you.

274
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,423
What?

275
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,085
I's the one
tried to help you...

276
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,823
when the Natives took you.

277
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,397
Oh, that was you?

278
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,595
Yeah.

279
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,228
I thought you was killed.

280
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,708
They just locked me up,
you know that?

281
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,540
This long?

282
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,240
But I kept trying to escape,
you know.

283
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,112
They add on time for that.

284
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,883
So what are
you doing back here?

285
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,389
I guess I missed the place.

286
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,959
Bowery Boys.

287
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,565
That's enough now.

288
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,737
Hey! Get back here!

289
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,246
The Five Points...

290
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,577
Paradise Square...

291
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,415
the streets here
are always lively of an evening.

292
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,250
Who are the gangs around now?

293
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,654
You got the Daybreak Boys
and the Swamp Angels.

294
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,521
They work the river,
looting ships.

295
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,584
The Frog Hollows
Shanghai Sailors

296
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,253
down around the Bloody Angle.

297
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,820
Shirt Tails was rough
for a while,

298
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,025
but they've become a bunch
of jackrolling dandies,

299
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,864
lolling around Murderers' Alley,
looking like Chinamen.

300
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,302
Hell-Cat Maggie... she tried
to open her own grog shop,

301
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,930
but she drunk up
all her own liquor

302
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,497
and got throwed out
on the street.

303
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,507
Beautiful.

304
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,804
Now she's on the lay
for anything.

305
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,277
There's the Plug Uglies.

306
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,007
They're from somewhere
deep in the old country.

307
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,070
Got their own language.

308
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,547
No one understands
what they're saying.

309
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,811
They love to fight the cops.

310
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,012
And the Night Walkers
of Ragpickers' Row...

311
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,487
they work on their backs
and kill with their hands.

312
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,389
They're so scurvy, only the
Plug Uglies will talk to them.

313
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,051
But who knows
what they're saying?

314
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,789
The Slaughter Housers
and the Broadway Twisters...

315
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,728
they're a fine bunch
of bingo-boys.

316
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,060
And the little
Forty Thieves...

317
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,566
I used to run with them
for a while

318
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,762
till they got took over
by Bendrick the Cockroach

319
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:39,895
and his Red-Eyed Buggers.

320
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,370
Bendrick carries a germ.

321
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,964
If you try to leave the gang,
he hacks up blood on you.

322
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,475
The lime-juicers

323
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,570
are nothing but a bunch
of rapacious grab-ups.

324
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,081
The True Blue Americans
call themselves a gang,

325
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,084
but all they do is stand around
on corners damning England.

326
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,552
If you believe one word
that the British say,

327
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,588
you're a fool.

328
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,591
Do any of them got the sand
of the Dead Rabbits?

329
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,693
You don't say that name.

330
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,199
That name died with your...

331
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,632
They've been outlawed.

332
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,033
When I was in the blockhouse,
the Chinks told me

333
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,199
that the Natives celebrate
their victory every year.

334
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,708
Is that true?

335
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,506
Aye, that they do.

336
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,046
It's quite the affair.

337
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,741
The Butcher himself's got to
invite you, or you don't go.

338
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,786
Oh! Aah!

339
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,386
Look where you're going,
Johnny.

340
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,127
You look stunned
and poorly, sir.

341
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,107
Quite a pair
of conversationists, aren't you?

342
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,911
Maybe not...

343
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,743
but we're deep thinkers.

344
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,513
Well...

345
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:05,682
Gentlemen, I leave you in the
grace and favor of the Lord.

346
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,693
Jenny... the finest
bludget in all the Points.

347
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,259
She is
a prim-looking stargazer.

348
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,066
Hmm.

349
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,074
But I'd check my pockets
if I was you...

350
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,043
'cause I do believe
she lifted your timepiece.

351
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,342
Whoo!

352
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,044
Well, I let her take it.

353
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,246
I let her take things
all the time.

354
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,222
Is that right?

355
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,120
We always liked
a good fire in the Points.

356
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,358
Fire!

357
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,025
You could generally
pick up a little swag,

358
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,763
and if the cops came along,
then you really got a show.

359
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,895
Vote Tammany!

360
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,098
The Municipal Police

361
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,266
fought the
Metropolitan Police.

362
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,505
The Metropolitan Police...
they fought the street gangs.

363
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,342
Hurry up, men, before
the Black Joke get there!

364
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,440
There were
37 amateur fire brigades,

365
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,950
and they all fought each other.

366
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,851
The Black Joke
are on their way, Tweed!

367
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,821
And they'll beat
the shite out of you.

368
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,024
Okay, boys!

369
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,690
Get the hose out!

370
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,202
It's the Black Joke!

371
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,674
Go get them, boys!

372
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,735
Give those Bowery Boys hell!

373
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,542
Quick, before
there's nothing left.

374
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,048
Go back to
the Bowery, you bums!

375
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,551
Stop them! For God's
sake, they're taking everything!

376
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,713
In your next time of trouble,
ma'am, call on Tammany first.

377
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,689
But it's not too late!
You can still save my house!

378
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,986
Whoo!

379
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,754
Let's go.

380
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,123
I thought you said
you was hungry!

381
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,666
Grab what you can!
Let's get out of here!

382
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,505
May I point out that this
building is burning to ashes?

383
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,476
And may I point out
that this area

384
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,035
is the province of my own
Americus Fire Brigade

385
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,480
and that you lot
belong only in the Bowery?

386
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,845
May I point out that you're
outmanned, outmaneuvered...

387
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,014
...and, in a moment, outfought.

388
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,352
Am I?

389
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,028
There's the Black Joke!
Let's take them on the cobbles!

390
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,865
Go spill some claret, boys!

391
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,734
Go on, Shorty,
have a nice muss!

392
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,831
Clear the way
for Bill the Butcher.

393
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,872
Okay, boys, to work!

394
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,878
What's the point?

395
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,744
The fire's near burned
anything of value inside.

396
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:48,217
Boys, forget that one!
Next building over!

397
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,446
Mustn't let it spread!

398
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,681
Take what you want
from that one!

399
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,723
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

400
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,782
There's nothing wrong with
this one. This is my house!

401
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,993
Aah!

402
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,087
Johnny!
- Help!

403
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,962
Johnny!

404
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:06,894
Help!

405
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,373
Aah.

406
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,468
Help!

407
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,446
Come on!
Come on, Johnny! Get up!

408
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,314
Leave that!

409
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,518
You two,
out of the way!

410
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,076
His name's Amsterdam.

411
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,445
How's the beak?

412
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,452
Ain't so bad.

413
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,784
You, you got anything,
you give it up,

414
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,881
or you get out.

415
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:11,894
Is that it?

416
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,268
That's it.

417
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,836
Right, here's the rake...
everything comes here.

418
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,877
We fence it.

419
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,639
Johnny takes our tribute
to the Natives,

420
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,112
and we chop up
the winnings...

421
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,083
each to his equal portion
amongst the gang.

422
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,915
Does that meet
with your approval, Hellgate?

423
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,417
My approval?

424
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,926
What's the matter, Jack Sprat...
can't you think for yourself?

425
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,323
I'll slit your fucking throat!

426
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,591
Hey, come on!

427
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,003
You boys will settle with me
before settling with each other.

428
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,646
I come for my due and proper.

429
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,893
Oh...

430
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,763
Well, this ain't a bad haul.

431
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,734
You know when folks
start in to saying

432
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,668
to where the country's
going to hell?

433
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,830
I always tell them...

434
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,533
"You just look
at all the hard work

435
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,702
our fine young lads is doing
down in the Five Points. "

436
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,302
Oh, yeah...

437
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,576
Now, this is just the thing
for Mrs. Mulraney.

438
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,446
All right, there, Happy Jack,

439
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,419
leave us with something to
quarter to Bill the Butcher, eh?

440
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,647
Would you?

441
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,259
Not my favorite tune.

442
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,209
Thank you, boys.

443
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,779
You keep out of trouble, now.

444
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,259
Every year,
the Natives celebrated

445
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,827
the killing of my father
all over again...

446
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,367
...at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
in Mott Street.

447
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,447
The Chinks hated the Natives
worse than we did.

448
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,579
The drum rolls, and the Butcher
drinks a glass of fire.

449
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,089
When you kill a king...

450
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,154
you don't stab him in the dark.

451
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:01,838
You kill him where the
whole court can watch him die.

452
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,374
Hey, got any timber?

453
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,052

Ah, give us a drink,

00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,269
Come closer.

540
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,135
Close, John,
I ain't gonna bite. Close.

541
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,765
<i># My dear Annie #</i>

542
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,174
<i># Oh, you New York girls #</i>

543
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,577
There's a "Portageezy" ship
lying low in the harbor...

544
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,115
quarantined three weeks.

545
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,241
Get there before
the Daybreak Boys strip her,

546
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,548
maybe you and me
will talk some more.

547
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,417
- Consider it done, sir.
- Good boy.

548
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,093
And, you, whatever your name
is... what is your name?

549
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,763
Amsterdam, sir.

550
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,460
Amsterdam.

551
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,765
I'm New York.

552
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,635
Don't you never come in here
empty-handed again.

553
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,175
You gotta pay for the pleasure
of my company.

554
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,609
Take him for a boat ride,
John.

555
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,876
Who knows, but he might
save your life again.

556
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,753
Daybreak Boys
catch us on this river,

557
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,288
they'll slit our throats.

558
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,790
I'll do it myself
if you don't keep quiet.

559
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,622
I never liked
the harbor after dark.

560
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,957
And now each night,

561
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,520
they brung ashore the bodies
of the soldiers.

562
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,566
So many mothers
have not even the solace

563
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,501
of knowing where
their sons have fallen.

564
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,902
I lost my own eldest
at Antietam,

565
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,600
and his mother and I were unable
to recover his remains.

566
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,108
It was
a mournful sight...

567
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,838
The war can't last forever.

568
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,142
But we had
business of our own.

569
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,007
Ooh!

570
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,391
The Daybreak Boys
have already been here.

571
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,552
And there's nothing left.
Let's go back, eh?

572
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,999
What in the hell...

573
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,841
Jimmy, get down!

574
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,547
Jesus! That'll bring
the harbor cops for sure!

575
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,741
Look out!

576
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,524
Let's take a look.

577
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,394
Jesus, they killed everybody.

578
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,331
There's nothing here but
a bunch of dead sea-crabs.

579
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,629
Come on, let's go.

580
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,628
Shove off!

581
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,536
No, wait for Amsterdam!

582
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,700
Where's Amsterdam?

583
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,471
- Aah!
- Aah!

584
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,109
No, you damn fool, take him!

585
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,511
What in the hell for?!

586
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,742
Look at my glims...
I said no less than $15.

587
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,011
Is this fresh?

588
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,143
Four hours, most.

589
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,288
Much obliged, gents.

590
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,027
What's that word?

591
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,999
Uh... it means body snatchers.

592
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,195
I didn't ask the meaning.
I asked the word.

593
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,296
Ghoul.

594
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,275
Ghoul?

595
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,276
That's a good word.

596
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,471
"Ghoul Gang Slaughters.

597
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,677
A fresh out... outrage
in the Five Points. "

598
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,844
That's a notice
you can be proud of.

599
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,852
Thank you.

600
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,413
Low thing... to do that
to a body. Low.

601
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,789
Why? They could have left
that ship with nothing.

602
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,657
Instead, they made
the "Police Gazette,"

603
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,060
a periodical of note.

604
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,292
A body's supposed to stay
beneath the Earth...

605
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:12,358
wearing a wooden coat
until the resurrection.

606
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,698
These two are just a pair

607
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,171
of bug-eating sons of
Irish bitches same as you are.

608
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,265
Don't seem
to bother them none.

609
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,607
But then maybe they don't share
your religious scruples.

610
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,443
Maybe they're just
a couple of Fidlam Bens.

611
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,454
I've been called
a lot of things, mister,

612
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,786
but I ain't never been
called a...

613
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,950
Fidlam Bens.

614
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,823
Fidlam Bens, right.

615
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:42,195
Well... if I knew
what in the hell that meant,

616
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,461
might be inclined
to take offense.

617
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:48,904
Fidlam Bens is a fellow steals
anything, dead or alive,

618
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,067
'cause he's too low to work up
a decent lay for himself.

619
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,201
Count that careful, Butcher.
Count that careful.

620
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,439
I'm telling you...
that's all they give us.

621
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,641
Now, chiseler...
if you had said chiseler...

622
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,877
now, there's a word
I understand, you know?

623
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,509
Now, is that what
you're calling us?

624
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:05,646
Oh, I could think of a number
of things to call you, boyo.

625
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:09,124
Right, but I asked if
you was calling us chiselers.

626
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,184
Supposing I am?

627
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,695
Well, then, we got business.

628
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,929
That we do.

629
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,712
Two bucks on McGloin!

630
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,838
Four bits on the kid!

631
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,348
Five bits on the kid!

632
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,008
I got five on Amsterdam!

633
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,456
Come on, McGloin,
he's just a kid!

634
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,425
Four bits to back Amsterdam!

635
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,870
One!

636
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:00,035
Watch his left, McGloin.
Watch his left.

637
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,837
Aaah!

638
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,437
Aah! Aah!

639
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,414
Aah! Aaaaah!

640
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,609
All right, that'll do.
That'll do.

641
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,777
Have you got anything
to say now?! Huh?!

642
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,787
That'll do, for Christ's sake.
Drag him off.

643
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,288
That's enough, kid.

644
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,790
You got him.

645
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,520
Come on, kid. You won.
Don't make a fool of yourself.

646
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,925
You can't do it anymore.

647
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,692
You're getting too old
for it, McGloin.

648
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,488
McGloin,
how would that head look

649
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,989
without the ears
and the nose on it?

650
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,217
You had better leave
that head alone, Bill.

651
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,786
I think I'm gonna trim
the ears and the beak

652
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,059
off of that head.

653
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,693
Make a nice pot of soup
of that head.

654
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,533
We could find a tastier head
than that, Bill.

655
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,870
I ain't got the stomach
for no Irish stew.

656
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:45,247
The mighty McGloin...
almost fishhooked by a sprat.

657
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,693
On the seventh day,
the Lord rested.

658
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,456
But before that he did,

659
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,464
he squatted over
the side of England,

660
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,296
and what came out of him...

661
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,596
was Ireland.

662
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:06,727
No offense, son.

663
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,398
None taken, sir.
I grew up here.

664
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,667
All I ever knew of Ireland

665
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:14,142
was in the talk of the others
at the orphan asylum.

666
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,180
And which part of that
excrementitious isle

667
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,408
were your forebears spawned?

668
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,711
I've been told Kerry,

669
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:25,187
but I lost proof of it
in my language at the asylum.

670
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,349
I was raised in a very similar
establishment myself.

671
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:32,054
Now everything you see belongs
to me, to one degree or another.

672
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:35,621
The beggars and newsboys and
quick thieves here in Paradise,

673
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,291
the sailor dives
and gin mills

674
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,164
and blind tigers
on the waterfront,

675
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,830
the anglers and amusers,
the she-hes and the Chinks...

676
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,499
everybody owes,
everybody pays,

677
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,442
because that's
how you stand up

678
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,036
against the rising
of the tide.

679
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,638
Is that right, boys?

680
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,512
Yeah, Bill, that's right.

681
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,111
Enlist! Join up!
Serve your country!

682
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,883
Come on in
out of the draft, boys!

683
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,687
Volunteer
and get your $50 bonus!

684
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,227
We need 30,000 volunteers,

685
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:08,321
and we're prepared to pay
$677 per volunteer.

686
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,491
Please read this.
Thank you.

687
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,593
Would you like to take one of
these, please, to fill out?

688
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,165
Three square meals a day.

689
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,903
Young man, enlist
and serve your country.

690
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,172
Three square meals a day,
gentlemen.

691
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,235
If you're interested,

692
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,905
I suggest you read this
and consider joining up.

693
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,540
Everywhere you went,

694
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,244
people talked about
the draft.

695
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,412
Now, you could buy
your way out for $300,

696
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,479
but who had $300?

697
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,390
For us, it might as well
have been $3 millions.

698
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,893
The recruiters...

699
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,021
they was too scared of
the gangs to come after us.

700
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:45,831
Besides, we never dreamt the war
would ever touch New York.

701
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,598
Good morning, sir.

702
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,104
You!

703
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,166
Don't you run into me.

704
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,278
Fair enough.

705
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,416
Oh! Oh!

706
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,214
I said, "Don't run into me. "

707
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,686
Well, sorry.

708
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,294
Everything in place?

709
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,762
It seems so.

710
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,630
Well, then, I leave you in the
grace and favor of the Lord.

711
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,066
- That's right.
- Thank you.

712
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,445
Oh, the dirty mab!

713
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,108
- Oh, no.
- Ah.

714
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,211
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, allow me.

715
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,458
Thank you kindly, sir.

716
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,721
Oh, it's my pleasure.

717
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,662
I hope you won't think me
rude if I speak.

718
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,165
I wouldn't want to
appear forward.

719
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,761
Well, sir, that depends
on what you say.

720
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,197
Ahh...

721
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,110
Would you call me reckless

722
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,275
if I said you were the
prettiest girl in New York?

723
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,818
Only New York?

724
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,389
This is my stop.

725
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,685
Ho!

726
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:18,421
Ah! May I walk with you
a little, then?

727
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,430
That, sir, would be too bold.

728
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,329
Ho!

729
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,954
For every lay,
we had a different name.

730
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,497
An angler put a hook
on the end of a stick

731
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,533
to drop behind store windows
and doors.

732
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,729
An autumn diver picked
your pocket in church.

733
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,399
A badger gets a fellow
into bed with a girl,

734
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,466
then robs his pockets
while they're on the go.

735
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:11,446
Jenny was a bludget...
a girl pickpocket...

736
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:15,076
and... a turtledove.

737
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,548
A turtledove goes uptown
dressed like a housemaid,

738
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,057
picks out a fine house,

739
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,616
and goes right through
the back door...

740
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,322
robs you blind.

741
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,592
It takes a lot of sand
to be a turtledove.

742
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,185
I'll have my medal back.

743
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,283
Oh, Jesus!

744
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,293
Unh!

745
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,167
Don't do that again.

746
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,671
Aah! Listen, I said
don't do that...

747
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,036
Go back to the Points
and leave me to my business,

748
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,169
or I will open your throat,
so help me God.

749
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,813
All right.

750
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,949
Go on, then.

751
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,018
I would.

752
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,054
Go on, then.

753
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,048
Now... give me back my medal.

754
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,814
Make it quick!

755
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,992
I don't know
which one's yours.

756
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,732
Suppose I help myself
to everything?

757
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,405
Huh?

758
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,342
Suppose you do.

759
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,785
May I walk with you
a little, then?

760
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,489
What do you suppose a fellow
could earn up here in a day?

761
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,089
Maybe we could pal in
together.

762
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:20,694
Oh, I think you're a bit rough
for this sort of game.

763
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,170
Besides, I work alone.

764
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,264
Alone?

765
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,775
Well, what do you quarter
to the Butcher?

766
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,401
Me... nothing.

767
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,570
Nothing?!

768
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,080
The Butcher and me
have a special arrangement.

769
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,422
I don't want to see you again.

770
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,650
Well, I don't blame you.

771
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,828
Pennies in their pockets
and hope in their eyes,

772
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,161
they peer to the west,

773
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:53,862
searching the horizon for a
glimpse of land and salvation...

774
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:57,100
Ah... a glimpse of America.

775
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,607
Seeing all this poverty

776
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,438
must be most unsettling,
Miss Schermerhorn.

777
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,772
Some days, of course,

778
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,541
the uptown gangs
come down to us.

779
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,276
The Schermerhorns was one
of the oldest families

780
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,544
in New York.

781
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,176
They didn't run the city,

782
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:13,222
but they was listened to quite
carefully by them that did.

783
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,087
Commissioner Brunt said
you wished to view the Points

784
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,683
in all its splendor
and squalor.

785
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,025
"Spare nothing concerning
the conditions," said he.

786
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,088
Yeah, nothing except
our safety, Constable.

787
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,861
I'm sure we can be
in no danger

788
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,994
while we're in the constable's
company, my dear.

789
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,595
Quite so, madam. Witness.

790
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,138
Shall we continue on?

791
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,979
What, you dare
to leave it there?

792
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,681
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greeley,
since all know it's mine.

793
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,552
Is that man drunk?

794
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,252
Oh, dead as Good Friday, miss.

795
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,462
Good day to you, Mulraney.

796
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,160
Boys.
- Jack.

797
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,327
Slum sociable?

798
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,336
Fact-finding, reforms-studying.

799
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,837
May I present Mr. And...

800
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,897
The Schermerhorns
of 5th Avenue

801
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,876
scarcely require
an introduction from you, Jack.

802
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,468
Schermerhorn, indeed,
and their daughter.

803
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,808
This gentleman,
of course, is...

804
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,404
Mr. Horace Greeley,
the famous publisher.

805
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,211
A pleasure and an honor,
sir.

806
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,717
...of the "Tribune. "

807
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,412
I'm William Cutting.

808
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,217
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

809
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,217
As of this moment,
extremely well, thank you.

810
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,228
How do you do?

811
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,856
Mmm, orange blossom...
delicious.

812
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,991
Mr. Cutting is, uh...

813
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,558
What a peach. She could have
a fine career on the stage.

814
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,264
...one of Five Points'
local...

815
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,635
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

816
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,139
...leaders.
- Mr. Greeley...

817
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,402
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Cutting.

818
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,841
Five Points welcomes you.

819
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,777
You are welcome to these streets
and will pass in safety.

820
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,839
Oh, I'll see to their safety.

821
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,406
Thank you, Bill.

822
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,713
Here we are.

823
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,912
Good day, lads.

824
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,887
Criminal's braggadocio,
you see.

825
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,049
- He knows who I am.
- Oh, indeed, sir.

826
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,685
You're well-known
in these parts.

827
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:01,253
I must say that I find that
strangely flattering.

828
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,128
I never did like crushers.

829
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,394
Well, draw it mild, son...
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs

830
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,265
without I tell him
he may do so.

831
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:11,364
<i># He'll spend at
The Odd Fellows' club #</i>

832
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,308
<i># At the office or store,
He was kept #</i>

833
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:18,780
<i># He'll pretend,
And so he was, too #</i>

834
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,645
<i># Drinking rum with a friend #</i>

835
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,413
You think my watch would be safe
up on that lamppost, Bill?

836
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,182
<i># At the office or store,
He was kept #</i>

837
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,123
Why don't you hang it
up there and see?

838
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,160
<i># He'll pretend,
And so he was, too #</i>

839
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:34,492
<i>- Someday.
- # Drinking rum with a friend #</i>

840
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,498
Someday is right.

841
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,124
<i># Fortune's a false
And a fickle young jade #</i>

842
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,327
This a new lad?

843
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,371
Just another
bastard son of Erin

844
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,966
I folded in the warmth
of my embrace.

845
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,977
<i># And the best
Of all blessings #</i>

846
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:49,670
Hey!

847
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,304
Just want to see
your face, son.

848
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:54,509
<i>- # Is a kind, loving husband #
- No harm intended.</i>

849
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:57,712
<i># And a good-tempered wife #</i>

850
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,982

<i># And a good-tempered wife #</i>

854
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,104
You get to know a lot
butchering meat.

855
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,111
We're made up
of the same things...

856
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,376
flesh and blood,
tissue, organs.

857
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,178
I love to work with pigs.

858
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:33,313
The nearest thing in nature
to the flesh of a man

859
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,017
is the flesh of a pig.

860
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,922
Pig, huh?

861
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,290
That's right.

862
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,226
This is for you, Mother.

863
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,865
Here you go.

864
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,129
- God bless you, Mr. Cutting.
- God bless you.

865
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,400
She ain't really my mother.

866
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,565
I knew that, Bill.

867
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,309
This is the liver...

868
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,407
the kidneys...

869
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,179
the heart.

870
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,618
This is a wound.

871
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,985
The stomach
will bleed and bleed.

872
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,519
This is a kill.

873
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,527
Main artery...

874
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,086
this is a kill.

875
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,224
You try.

876
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,565
Go ahead.

877
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,522
The lung. Good.

878
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,259
Don't foul the blade
on the rib.

879
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,995
Very good... main artery.

880
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,195
Bleed him slow.

881
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,137
Let him think about it
for a while... slow death.

882
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,266
Good.

883
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,640
You will each bill
the city $5,000 a month

884
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,180
for supplies and services,
of which you'll receive 10%.

885
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,943
Bill!

886
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,484
Mr. Killoran will work out the
details. Thank you, gentlemen!

887
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:12,214
That's how we do things
around Tammany, gentlemen.

888
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:13,687
Who's this, then?

889
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,059
Thank you, boys.

890
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,458
Good day, sir.

891
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,804
You got something
on your mind?

892
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,379
Bill's taken
quite a liking to you.

893
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,011
Now, if you're
up to something...

894
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,850
<i>bene.</i>

895
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,254
Only I don't want
no part in it.

896
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:55,427
I was in Hellgate
for 16 years.

897
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,928
I'm just trying
to make my way, is all...

898
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:00,162
just like you.

899
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,837
Unless, of course,
you got a better notion.

900
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,408
No.

901
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:11,072
Bill, I can't get
a day's work done

902
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,944
for all the good citizens
coming in here

903
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,416
to harass me
about crime in the Points.

904
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:19,751
Some even go so far as to
accuse Tammany of connivance

905
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,484
in this so-called
rampant criminality.

906
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,890
What am I to do?

907
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,019
I can't have this.
Something has to be done.

908
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:27,357
What do you have in mind?

909
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,954
I don't know.

910
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,966
I think maybe
we should hang someone.

911
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,626
Who?

912
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,796
No one important, necessarily.
Average men will do...

913
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,841
back-alley amusers
with no affiliations.

914
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,205
How many?

915
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,573
Three or four.

916
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:43,978
Which?

917
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:45,742
Four.

918
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:51,115
You stand here convicted
varyingly

919
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:56,215
of lewdness, jackrolling,
sneak-thievery,

920
00:59:56,292 --> 01:00:01,161
chloral-hydrating, sodomy,
strangulation,

921
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,257
and enthusiastic corruption
of the public good.

922
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,901
We all go someday.

923
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:09,904
Chin up.

924
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,270
Handsome bunch
of gallows fruit.

925
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,104
There's my old friend.
How are you feeling, Arthur?

926
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,666
I'm okay, I'm okay,
you know?

927
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:15,938
Oh, say hello to Amsterdam.

928
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,980
Nearly fishhooked McGloin
the other day.

929
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,344
- Nearly.
- How do you do?

930
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,349
I see you dressed
for the occasion, Arthur.

931
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,715
You know me, Bill...
always like to look me best.

932
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,946
That's the spirit.

933
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,084
That's a nice locket.
I'll give you a dollar for it.

934
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,921
It's me mother's.

935
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,428
Dollar and a half?

936
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,657
Done.

937
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,763
We'll miss you, Arthur.

938
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,361
See you in the hot country,
Seamus.

939
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,702
Hot corn!
Ears of early white corn!

940
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:46,366
Hot corn! Hot corn!

941
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,539
Is my son present here?

942
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,884
Where's my little fella?

943
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,319
Look at your da.

944
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,119
Farewell, dear boy.

945
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:08,353
I never struck a foul blow,
nor turned a card!

946
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,399
May God greet me as a friend!

947
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,758
<i># ... heart to fear #</i>

948
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:41,023
<i># And grace my fears relieved #</i>

949
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:44,932
<i># How precious
did that grace appear #</i>

950
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,164
That night,
the reformers held a dance.

951
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,762
That was the Five Points,
all right...

952
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,775
hangings of a morning,
dancings of an evening.

953
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:54,901
Ow!

954
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,138
...sure meself, but it's not
a matter of words.

955
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,078
I can tell by the way
she smiles at me.

956
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,013
Well, she smiles
at a lot of people, Johnny.

957
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,984
- Sir...
- You don't know her.

958
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,215
A penny of gratitude for
a fighting Irishman, young sir.

959
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,691
You're from Kerry?

960
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,728
I am, sir. I am.

961
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:14,954
Look, it ain't much.

962
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,521
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

963
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,191
Ladies and gentlemen,

964
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,633
we are delighted to see
so many young faces

965
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,933
in our first annual
Mission dance.

966
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,235
This'll be
a real ballum rancum, eh?

967
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:28,038
The Mission welcomes Christians
of every stamp,

968
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,908
and we are
particularly happy

969
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,038
to greet
our Roman-Catholic friends

970
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,379
who join us here tonight.

971
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,884
Ladies, come with me.
Come with me.

972
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,648
Sit with us.

973
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:42,555
We're going to start
the dancing in just a moment.

974
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,684
Good evening, Reverend.

975
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,229
Good evening, Your Holiness.

976
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,455
Good evening, Reverend.

977
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,991
Looks as though
you should have shaved closer.

978
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,130
Oh.

979
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,901
Good evening, Reverend.

980
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,840
I do beg your pardon.

981
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,742
Miss...?

982
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,486
Uh...

983
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:11,952
Everdeane.

984
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,114
Miss Everdeane.

985
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:29,330
Now, gentlemen, over here,
if you don't mind.

986
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:30,429
Thank you.

987
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,133
Open it.

988
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,267
Hold it up.

989
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,438
Into the mirror.

990
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:46,946
Hmm...

991
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,792
Mmm...

992
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,780
All right.

993
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,561
That one.

994
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,604
Our queen has chosen.

995
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,157
Sir...

996
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,318
your lady.

997
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,827
Right.

998
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,388
Regular services are held
at the church at 6:00 and 8:00.

999
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:04,626
Go to hell.

1000
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,139
What do you think
you're doing?

1001
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,200
I'm dancing.

1002
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,803
I said why'd you pick me?

1003
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,472
That's none of your business.

1004
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:20,810
Would you mind telling me?

1005
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:21,815
Ohh!

1006
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,249
I'm sorry.

1007
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,815
God damn it.

1008
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,081
- Ow!
- Sorry.

1009
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,016
I'm not much of a dancer.

1010
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,220
Just try to keep calm.

1011
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,287
I've never been
to a stepping-ken before.

1012
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,423
It's best not to look down.

1013
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,926
You can hold me tighter
if you like.

1014
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,744
All right.

1015
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,814
So, why didn't you dance
with Johnny?

1016
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,518
Because...

1017
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:03,850
...I didn't want him.

1018
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,442
I'm not wanting this.

1019
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,177
Mmm...

1020
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,492
Wait.

1021
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:13,493
What?

1022
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:14,756
Wait.

1023
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,229
How does this open?

1024
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,993
It takes too long
to lace back up.

1025
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,297
We'll be here all night.

1026
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,741
Sure, all right.
I'll take it off.

1027
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,307
There was a baby.
They cut it out.

1028
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,375
I'm sorry.

1029
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,842
No, it's fine.

1030
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,879
Have you got any scars?

1031
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,516
One or two.

1032
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:17,810
What's that, then?

1033
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:23,018
That... is a gift
from Mr. Cutting.

1034
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,991
A gift?

1035
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,727
A gift.

1036
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,296
Was it your birthday?

1037
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,296
No.

1038
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,204
<i>What'd you give him, then?</i>

1039
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:48,745
The answer to that
has nothing to do with you.

1040
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,054
Don't tell me
you're angry with me.

1041
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,058
No.

1042
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,856
I'm through with you.

1043
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:07,327
Well... you're quicker
than most fellows.

1044
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,564
Generally,
they wait till afterwards.

1045
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,038
Well, I ain't interested
in the Butcher's leavings.

1046
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,362
Hey! Bill says
keep clear of the pikers.

1047
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,695
15 to 1, Bug-Eye Moran.

1048
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,199
Amsterdam!

1049
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,634
Everyone was
working for the Butcher.

1050
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,604
We ran his errands,
made his money,

1051
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,799
took a piece
and said, "Thank you, sir. "

1052
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:46,806
Gentlemen, it's a raid.

1053
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,467
Even Tweed.

1054
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:49,806
The fight's over!

1055
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:50,970
Even me...

1056
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,048
...my father's son.

1057
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,607
- What the hell is this?
- Sorry, Bill.

1058
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,779
The city ordinance against
boxiana's a blight, I grant...

1059
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,914
I'm losing revenue
while you speechify.

1060
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,788
Get out there
and collect those bets!

1061
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,759
Sir, how do I collect
if no one won the fight?

1062
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,388
This counts as a no-decision.
You got that covered, right?

1063
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,092
Didn't anybody pay off
the goddamn police?

1064
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,930
We paid the Municipal Police.
This is the Metropolitan Police.

1065
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,368
You are gonna repay me
every cent.

1066
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,098
- Mister Tweed...
- Who asked for your opinion?!

1067
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:20,005
Let him speak!
He don't answer to you!

1068
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,566
The law says that there's
no boxing in the city.

1069
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,442
That's right...
in the city.

1070
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,310
Well, where's the city end?

1071
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:37,416
The winner
in the 75th round...

1072
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,825
Allow me
to acknowledge the man

1073
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:42,329
whose vision and enterprise
made possible

1074
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:45,629
the staging
of this noble combat

1075
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:49,535
in these awe-inspiring and
entirely legal surroundings,

1076
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,573
Mr. William Cutting!

1077
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:56,810
And...

1078
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:59,177
and his young associate!

1079
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,024
Good.
You done very good.

1080
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,993
Well, we done good.
We done all right.

1081
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,825
And while I have
your kind attention...

1082
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,159
It was a good show.

1083
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,165
...may I remind you
of the further wonders

1084
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:22,863
that await you at my museum,
located on Broadway...

1085
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:26,396
P.T. Barnum's
Gallery of Wonders!

1086
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,909
- Watch who you're shoving!
- Keep your hands to yourself!

1087
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,103
That's my money!

1088
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,409
Get your hands
out of me pocket!

1089
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,346
Stop it! Stop it!

1090
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,350
It's a funny feeling

1091
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,615
being took under the wing
of a dragon.

1092
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,282
It's warmer than you think.

1093
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,451
That's the building
of our country

1094
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:48,018
right there, Mr. Cutting...
Americans aborning.

1095
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:49,826
I don't see no Americans.

1096
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,992
I see trespassers...
Irish harps.

1097
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,628
Do a job for a nickel
what a nigger does for a dime

1098
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,899
and a white man
used to get a quarter for.

1099
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:00,373
What have they done? Name
one thing they've contributed.

1100
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:01,534
Votes.

1101
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,702
Votes, you say?

1102
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,575
They vote how the archbishop
tells them,

1103
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,045
and who tells the archbishop?

1104
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:09,551
Their king in the pointy hat
what sits on his throne in Rome.

1105
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:13,918
Bill's got mixed feelings
as regards the Irish.

1106
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,549
Bill... deliver
these good and fervent folk

1107
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,684
to the polls
on a regular basis,

1108
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,319
and there'll be
a handsome price

1109
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,296
for each vote
that goes Tammany's way.

1110
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,902
My father gave his life

1111
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,063
making this country
what it is...

1112
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,164
murdered by the British
with all of his men

1113
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,574
<i>on the 25th of July,
anno Domini 1814.</i>

1114
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:38,306
You think I'm gonna help you
befoul his legacy

1115
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,314
by giving this country
over to them

1116
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:42,407
what's had no hand
in the fighting for it?

1117
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:43,974
Why? Because they come off
a boat,

1118
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,883
crawling with lice
and begging you for soup?

1119
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,387
Tsk, tsk.

1120
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:50,152
You're a great one for
the fighting, Bill, I know.

1121
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,556
But you can't fight forever.

1122
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,595
- I can go down doing it.
- And you will.

1123
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,498
What did you say?

1124
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:03,766
I said you're turning
your back on the future.

1125
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:08,241
<i>Not our future.</i>

1126
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:14,945
That document makes you
a citizen.

1127
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,349
This one makes you a private
in the Union Army.

1128
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,319
Now go fight for your country.

1129
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:20,377
Next!

1130
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,980
<i># Well, meself
And a hundred more #</i>

1131
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,820
Sign here, son.
Or make your mark.

1132
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,326
<i># To America sailed o'er #</i>

1133
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:32,095
<i># Our fortunes to be made,
We were thinkin' #</i>

1134
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:35,193
<i># When we got to Yankee land #</i>

1135
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,467
<i># They shoved a gun
Into our hands #</i>

1136
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,408
<i># Saying, "Paddy, you must go
And fight for Lincoln" #</i>

1137
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,174
There's your musket. Make sure
you keep it dry on the boat.

1138
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,680
Same for the cartridge case.

1139
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,012
Where are we going?
I heard Tennessee.

1140
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,016
Where's that?

1141
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:52,918
<i># There is nothing here
But war #</i>

1142
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:56,287
<i># Where the murderin'
Cannons roar #</i>

1143
01:14:56,358 --> 01:15:03,127
<i># And I wish I was at home
In dear old Dublin #</i>

1144
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,666
Do they feed us now,
do you think?

1145
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,302
My children!

1146
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,314
My children...

1147
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:24,944
we must heal
the divisions between us.

1148
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,545
This war must cease.

1149
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:32,424
North and South
must stand united!

1150
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,259
You're a liar!

1151
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,322
Rubbish!

1152
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,371
What happens
at the finish, then?

1153
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:46,635
Then we have ourselves
a rowdy-dow.

1154
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,176
Ain't you never been
to the theater before?

1155
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:50,438
Nah.

1156
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:54,812
Mr. Legree,
lay down your whip.

1157
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,842
Miss Eliza,
join hands with Mr. Shelby.

1158
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:02,721
And, Topsy,
dear little Topsy,

1159
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,851
cradle Uncle Tom's head.

1160
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,953
Aw, leave the nigger dead!

1161
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,101
Get me down!

1162
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:28,309
Down with the Union!

1163
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,628
For the blood of the Irish!

1164
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:49,068
Bill, get down!

1165
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:01,079
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

1166
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,480
Get back!

1167
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:03,483
Uhh!

1168
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,452
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

1169
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,028
Stifle that rat bastard down!

1170
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:24,469
God, forgive me.

1171
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:39,452
Ohhh!

1172
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,012
Aaaaaaah!

1173
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,182
Whose man are you?

1174
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,623
Speak smart and speak up.

1175
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,525
What's he saying, boy?

1176
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,831
I think he's making
his peace with God.

1177
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,199
<i>The hell with that.
He makes his peace with me.</i>

1178
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,831
I'm hearing confession tonight,
you mother-whoring Irish nigger!

1179
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,306
Whose man are you?

1180
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,366
We speak English in this
country! Whose man are you?

1181
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:03,809
You see this knife?

1182
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:06,973
I'm gonna teach you to speak
English with this fucking knife!

1183
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,979
Whose man are you?!

1184
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,435
<i>Well, that didn't tell us
very much.</i>

1185
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,372
Fine waistcoat.

1186
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:37,170
Shame about it.
I don't think it can be mended.

1187
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,805
Will I keep it
as a souvenir?

1188
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,349
Yeah!

1189
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:18,184
Where's Legree?
Where's Mopsy?

1190
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,244
Tragedians, let's continue.

1191
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,119
Intermission is over!

1192
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,488
Yeah!

1193
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,505
Now, that was
bloody Shakespearean.

1194
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:44,567
What?

1195
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:47,137
Do you know
who Shakespeare was, sonny?

1196
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:50,275
He was the fellow who wrote
the King James Bible.

1197
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:52,752
Mister, I don't know what in
the hell you're talking about.

1198
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:55,790
That's because you're a thick,
ignorant, barbarous Irish whelp,

1199
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:57,791
just like your father.

1200
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,955
That's it! That's it!

1201
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,090
Tear my head off
and destruct the world,

1202
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,931
just like the rest of the stupid
Irish in this country.

1203
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:09,937
That's why I never ran
with your dad.

1204
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:13,338
Get off me,
you crazy bastard!

1205
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:18,141
It means,
"If you're not strong,

1206
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:19,976
you'd better be smart. "

1207
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,949
Now, I don't know if you're
being too clever or too dumb,

1208
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,350
but whichever it is,
just remember this much...

1209
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,785
for all his faults,

1210
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:29,915
your father was a man
who loved his people.

1211
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,659
Amsterdam! Amsterdam!

1212
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,532
New York is calling you!

1213
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,545
Look at that.

1214
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:58,450
What in Christ's name is that?

1215
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,647
Rhythms of the Dark Continent

1216
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:04,055
thrown into the kettle
with an Irish shindig.

1217
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,821
Stir it around a few times,
pull it out,

1218
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,386
it's a fine American mess.

1219
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,489
A jig doing a jig.

1220
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,098
Little keepsake.

1221
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:19,295
Good on you, sir.

1222
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,001
Come upstairs with me, Bill.

1223
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,945
Have I ever had you before?

1224
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,446
So you don't call me
by my Christian name.

1225
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,911
Bill! Thank God
you're all right!

1226
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:35,957
I heard the news and came over
as quick as I could.

1227
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,958
You're as timely
as the Angel of Death.

1228
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,926
Bill, you're not suggesting

1229
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:42,155
that I would stoop to...
what you're suggesting?

1230
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,458
Stop slabbering.

1231
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,556
If I thought it was you,
you'd be in a wooden coat.

1232
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:48,102
But I got a hole in
my shoulder, and it hurts,

1233
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:51,263
so have a drink and shut up,
or shut up and get out.

1234
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,407
I believe I'll have a drink.

1235
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:56,637
Careful, Tweedy.
The mort's frenchified.

1236
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:58,973
No! I'm clean.

1237
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,311
Come on.
Let's go to the bar.

1238
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:14,918
Jenny.

1239
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,088
Bill.

1240
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,181
I best wrap you up.

1241
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,945
Ohhhhh!

1242
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:41,652
It's got to be tight.

1243
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,520
She loves to make me cry.

1244
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,091
You can take it.

1245
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,271
There's my boy.

1246
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,610
Mmm...

1247
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,805
It's all right.
It's all right.

1248
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,252
To the Butcher.

1249
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:20,186
We're all much obliged.

1250
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,793
Forever.

1251
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:26,566
- To the Butcher.
- To the Butcher.

1252
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,339
Why don't you
get out of here, Johnny.

1253
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:41,738
Go on. Go.

1254
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,630
<i>Is there anyone in the
Five Points you haven't fucked?!</i>

1255
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,295
Yes! You!

1256
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,066
Why, you little...

1257
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:08,705
Aaaah!

1258
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,516
Calm down!

1259
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,278
Aaaah!

1260
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:29,627
Try it and I'll bite you!

1261
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,790
If you were gonna bite me...

1262
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:33,629
I don't think
you'd warn me, huh?

1263
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,134
Find out!
