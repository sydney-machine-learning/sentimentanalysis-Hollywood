1
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,719
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,876
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,232
We made it.

4
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,192
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,436
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,078
Cordé.

7
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,193
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,071
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,269
No.

10
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,709
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,037
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,830
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,631
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,718
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,199
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,038
If they do break away--

17
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,277
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

18
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,356
be split in two.

19
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,313
My negotiations will not fail.

20
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,870
If they do, you must realize...

21
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,991
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

22
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,474
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

23
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,518
Master Yoda...

24
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
do you think it will
really come to war?

25
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,558
The dark side clouds everything.

26
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,435
Impossible to see the future is.

27
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,272
<i>The Loyalist Committee</i>
<i>has arrived, Your Honour.</i>

28
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,355
Good.

29
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,836
Send them in.

30
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,679
We will discuss this matter later.

31
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,429
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform--

32
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,357
terrible.

33
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,070
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

34
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,794
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

35
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,311
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

36
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,156
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

37
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,989
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

38
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,953
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

39
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,390
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

40
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,954
But for certain, Senator...

41
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,755
in grave danger you are.

42
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,633
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

43
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,673
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

44
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,712
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,831
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--

46
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,190
The situation is that serious?

47
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,637
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,957
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,390
might be disruptive for you...

50
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,080
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

51
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,029
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,313
That's possible.

53
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,079
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,236
Do it for me, milady. Please?

55
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,635
The thought of losing you...

56
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,276
is unbearable.

57
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,157
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,430
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,795
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,390
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,997
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,429
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,831
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,959
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,030
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,714
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,355
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again,Jar Jar.

68
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,357
Senator Padmé.

69
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,916
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,634
Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,954
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

72
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,435
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

73
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,113
Ani?

74
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,391
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

75
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,795
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,752
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,590
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,029
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,116
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

81
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,276
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,039
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

84
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,956
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,709
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,115
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

87
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,992
I promise you.

88
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,714
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

89
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,638
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,149
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

91
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,111
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

92
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,231
- Why?
- What?

93
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,589
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

94
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,837
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

95
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,679
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

96
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,917
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

97
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,198
And you will learn
your place, young one.

98
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,471
Perhaps with merely your presence...

99
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,398
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

100
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,988
Now, if you'll excuse me...

101
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,878
I will retire.

102
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,156
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

103
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,316
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

104
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,510
and I'll be in the control centre
downstairs.

105
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,958
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

106
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,072
She hardly even
recognized me,Jar Jar.

107
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,438
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

108
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,637
she's forgotten me completely.

109
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,318
Shesa happy.

110
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,715
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

111
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,469
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,109
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,117
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,756
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,030
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,071
My client is getting impatient.

117
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,919
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,316
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,830
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

120
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,791
No assassin would try that way.

121
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,794
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

122
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,999
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

123
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,477
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

124
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,111
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

125
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,037
What is she thinking?

126
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,038
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

127
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,628
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

128
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,912
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,951
You're using her as bait.

130
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,036
It was her idea.

131
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,594
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,553
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

133
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,830
Trust me.

134
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,757
It's too risky.

135
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,312
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

136
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,631
And yours are?

137
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,557
Possibly.

138
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,197
You look tired.

139
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,797
I don't sleep well any more.

140
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,309
Because of your mother?

141
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,953
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,431
Dreams pass in time.

143
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,394
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

144
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,513
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

145
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,995
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

146
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,315
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

147
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,396
a commitment not easily broken.

148
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,159
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

149
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,748
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

150
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,916
It is my experience
that senators focus...

151
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,793
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

152
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,910
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

153
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,110
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

154
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,913
At least not
on the economics of politics.

155
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,874
And besides, you're generalizing.

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,956
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

157
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,638
Palpatine is a politician.

158
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,274
I have observed
that he is very clever...

159
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,188
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

160
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,117
I think he's a good man--

161
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,037
I sense it too.

162
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,440
Stay here!

163
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,591
Are you all right, milady?

164
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,789
What the--

165
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,672
<i>Jedi poo doo!</i>

166
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,150
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

167
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,033
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

168
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,391
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

169
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,193
If you spent as long practising your
sabre techniques as you do your wit...

170
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,958
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

171
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,672
I thought I already did.

172
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,394
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

173
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,029
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

174
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,916
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

175
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,112
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

176
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,913
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

177
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,913
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

178
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,116
stay away from power couplings!

179
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,994
That was good!

180
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,309
Where are you going?
He went that way.

181
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,351
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

182
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,391
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

183
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,593
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

184
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,280
This is a short cut... I think.

185
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,712
Well, you've lost him.

186
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,196
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

187
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,117
That was some short cut, Anakin.

188
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,549
He went completely the other way.

189
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,636
- Once again you've proved--
- If you'll excuse me.

190
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,548
I hate it when he does that.

191
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,152
Anakin!

192
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,953
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

193
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,436
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

194
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,199
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

195
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,993
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,874
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

197
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,560
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

198
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,272
Don't say that, Master.

199
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,356
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

200
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,232
Then why don't you listen to me?

201
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,873
I am trying.

202
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,351
Can you see him?

203
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,311
I think he is a she...

204
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
and I think she is a changeling.

205
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,114
In that case, be extra careful.

206
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,389
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

207
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,919
For a drink.

208
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,832
Thank you.

209
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,836
-You wanna buy some death sticks?
-You don't want to sell me death sticks.

210
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,791
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

211
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,911
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

212
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,270
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

213
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,708
Easy.

214
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,876
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

215
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,754
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

216
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,118
It was a senator from Naboo.

217
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,754
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

218
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,990
Who hired you? Tell us.

219
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,351
Tell us now!

220
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,032
It was a bounty hunter called--

221
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,398
<i>Wee shahnit... sleemo.</i>

222
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,352
Toxic dart.

223
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,239
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

224
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,636
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

225
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,469
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

226
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,398
Handle that your Padawan will.

227
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,550
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

228
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,229
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

229
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,237
Travel as refugees.

230
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,113
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

231
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,515
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

232
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,159
Until caught this killer is...

233
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,192
our judgement she must respect.

234
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,631
Anakin, go to the senate...

235
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,797
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

236
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,191
I will talk with her.

237
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,278
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

238
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,470
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

239
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,556
Thank you, Your Excellency.

240
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,877
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

241
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,877
Your patience has paid off.

242
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,195
Your guidance
more than my patience.

243
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,550
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

244
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,718
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

245
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,591
Then you will be invincible.

246
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,397
I have said it many times:

247
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,159
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

248
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,077
Thank you, Your Excellency.

249
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,715
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

250
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,274
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

251
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,151
I am concerned for my Padawan.

252
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,874
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

253
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,072
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

254
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,077
The boy has exceptional skills.

255
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,509
But he still has much to learn, Master.

256
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,916
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

257
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,917
Yes.

258
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,838
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

259
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,155
Too sure of themselves they are.

260
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,556
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

261
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,070
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

262
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,670
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

263
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,313
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

264
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,432
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

265
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,313
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

266
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,752
Mesa honoured to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

267
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,193
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and--

268
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,754
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

269
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,757
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

270
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,598
Of course.

271
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,393
Milady.

272
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,597
I do not like this idea of hiding.

273
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,669
Don't worry.

274
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,916
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

275
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,600
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

276
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,473
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

277
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,556
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

278
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,636
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

279
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,194
and do what is requested of us.

280
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,629
Anakin, you've grown up.

281
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,749
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

282
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,873
Don't get me wrong.

283
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,719
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

284
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,229
As wise as Master Yoda and...

285
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,396
as powerful as Master Windu.

286
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,989
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

287
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,992
In some ways--
a lot of ways--

288
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,837
I'm really ahead of him.

289
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,312
I'm ready for the trials...

290
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,671
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

291
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,631
He won't let me move on.

292
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,630
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

293
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,433
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

294
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,790
He doesn't understand.

295
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,911
It's not fair!

296
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,636
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

297
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,671
It's the only way we grow.

298
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,073
I know.

299
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,911
Anakin...

300
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,589
don't try to grow up too fast.

301
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,551
But I am grown up.

302
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,557
You said it yourself.

303
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,631
Please don't look at me like that.

304
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,999
Why not?

305
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,156
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

306
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,957
Sorry, milady.

307
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

308
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,312
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

309
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,317
He'll be safe with me.

310
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,118
You'll be fine.

311
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,277
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

312
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,630
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

313
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,911
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

314
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,837
Anakin...

315
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,918
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

316
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,871
Yes, Master.

317
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,389
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

318
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,351
You'll be back here in no time.

319
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,552
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

320
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,477
- It's time to go.
- I know.

321
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,989
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

322
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,076
May the Force be with you, Master.

323
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,877
Suddenly I'm afraid.

324
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,436
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

325
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,796
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

326
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,394
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

327
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,430
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

328
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,991
Someone to see ya, honey!

329
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,237
Jedi, by the looks of him.

330
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,793
Obi-Wan!

331
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,068
Hello, Dex.

332
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,668
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

333
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,833
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

334
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,390
Old buddy!

335
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,198
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

336
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,072
You can tell me what this is.

337
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,592
Well, whattaya know!

338
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,995
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

339
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,192
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

340
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,629
Can you tell me
where it came from?

341
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,593
This baby belongs to them cloners.

342
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,838
What you got here
is a Kamino sabredart.

343
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,793
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

344
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,037
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

345
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,914
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

346
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,190
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

347
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,550
for the difference
between knowledge and...

348
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,238
wisdom.

349
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,271
Well, if droids could think...

350
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,356
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

351
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,150
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

352
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,157
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

353
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,638
I'd say about 1 2 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

354
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,117
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

355
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,556
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

356
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,433
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

357
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,518
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

358
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,751
Depends on what, Dex?

359
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,599
On how good your manners are...

360
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,838
and how big your... pocketbook is.

361
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,708
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

362
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,876
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

363
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,117
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

364
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,390
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

365
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,638
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

366
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,990
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

367
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,953
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

368
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,071
just south of the Rishi Maze.

369
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,917
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

370
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,837
doesn't exist.

371
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,077
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

372
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,112
If an item does not appear
in our records...

373
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,231
it does not exist.

374
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,270
Hey, you! No droids!

375
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,437
Get outta here!

376
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,797
Thank you, R2.

377
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,313
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

378
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,149
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

379
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,316
Or be with the people that I love.

380
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,151
Are you allowed to love?

381
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,032
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

382
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,635
Attachment is forbidden.

383
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,157
Possession is forbidden.

384
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,716
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

385
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,149
is central to a Jedi's life.

386
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,712
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

387
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,671
You've changed so much.

388
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,234
You haven't changed a bit.

389
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,079
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

390
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,789
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

391
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,480
Use your feelings you must.

392
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,598
Younglings. Younglings!

393
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,029
A visitor we have.

394
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,913
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

395
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,393
Hello.

396
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,953
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

397
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,310
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

398
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,473
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

399
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,592
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

400
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,839
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

401
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,837
How embarrassing!

402
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,071
Liam, the shades.

403
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,709
Gather round the map reader.

404
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,910
Clear your minds...

405
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,350
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

406
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,512
It ought to be here...

407
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,437
but it isn't.

408
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,836
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

409
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,391
Gravity's silhouette remains...

410
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,318
but the star and all the planets...

411
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,351
disappeared they have.

412
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,516
How can this be?

413
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,238
A thought?

414
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,917
Anyone.

415
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,713
Master?

416
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,593
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

417
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,509
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

418
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,436
The Padawan is right.

419
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,472
Go to the centre of gravity's pull...

420
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,910
and find your planet you will.

421
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,998
The data must have been erased.

422
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,951
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

423
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,311
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

424
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,592
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

425
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,996
But who and why, harder to answer.

426
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,759
Meditate on this I will.

427
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,795
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

428
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,356
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

429
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,311
I'm not sure I was ready.

430
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,874
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

431
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,236
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

432
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,316
so you could stay in office.

433
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,795
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

434
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,435
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

435
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,471
I couldn't refuse her.

436
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,957
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

437
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,036
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

438
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,150
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

439
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,032
It's unthinkable!

440
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,391
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

441
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,875
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

442
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,991
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

443
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,190
Not if they feel threatened.

444
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,517
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

445
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,517
It's outrageous...

446
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,790
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

447
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,549
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

448
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,514
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

449
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,630
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

450
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,119
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

451
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
Let's pray that day never comes.

452
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,480
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

453
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,430
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

454
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,757
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

455
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,632
- But I was thinking--
- Hold on a minute.

456
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,954
Excuse me.

457
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,389
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

458
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,636
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

459
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,672
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

460
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,273
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

461
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,277
I think it would be wise...

462
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,675
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

463
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,831
Sorry, milady.

464
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,956
Perfect. It's settled, then.

465
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,954
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

466
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,832
Our missing planet Kamino.

467
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,237
Master Jedi.

468
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,550
The prime minister is expecting you.

469
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,035
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

470
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,070
He is anxious to meet you.

471
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,270
After all these years...

472
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,836
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

473
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,076
Now, please, this way.

474
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,715
May I present Lama Su...

475
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,796
prime minister of Kamino.

476
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,436
And this is Master Jedi--

477
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,477
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

478
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,751
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

479
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,037
Please.

480
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,710
And now to business.

481
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,594
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

482
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,477
200,000 units are ready...

483
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,830
with a million more
well on the way.

484
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,791
That's good news.

485
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,912
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

486
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,237
that his order will be met on time.

487
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,237
I'm sorry. Master--

488
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,794
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

489
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,912
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

490
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,669
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

491
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470
I'm so sorry to hear that.

492
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,673
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

493
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,030
The army?

494
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,630
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

495
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,876
one of the finest we've ever created.

496
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,877
Tell me, Prime Minister...

497
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,355
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

498
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,516
did he say who it was for?

499
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,551
Of course he did.

500
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,240
This army is for the Republic.

501
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,516
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

502
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,996
That's why I'm here.

503
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,036
We used to come here
for school retreat.

504
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,711
We would swim
to that island every day.

505
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,877
I love the water.

506
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,910
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

507
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,233
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

508
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,911
I don't like sand.

509
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,195
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

510
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,477
and it gets everywhere.

511
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,556
Not like here.

512
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,037
Here, everything is soft...

513
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,190
and smooth.

514
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,872
No.

515
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,476
I shouldn't have done that.

516
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,037
I'm sorry.

517
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,638
Very impressive.

518
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,796
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

519
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,189
Clones can think creatively.

520
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,029
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

521
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,829
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programmes.

522
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,157
This group was created
about five years ago.

523
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,236
You mentioned growth acceleration.

524
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,191
Oh, yes, it's essential.

525
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,198
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

526
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,788
Now we can do it in half the time.

527
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,434
I see.

528
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,357
They are totally obedient...

529
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,040
taking any order without question.

530
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,116
We modified their genetic structure...

531
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,312
to make them less independent
than the original host.

532
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,874
And who was the original host?

533
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,991
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

534
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,511
And where is this bounty hunter now?

535
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,676
Oh, we keep him here.

536
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,959
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

537
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,435
Fett demanded only one thing:

538
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,028
an unaltered clone for himself.

539
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,469
- Curious, isn't it?
-"Unaltered''?

540
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,989
Pure genetic replication.

541
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,112
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

542
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,674
and no growth acceleration.

543
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,917
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

544
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,157
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

545
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,713
Magnificent, aren't they?

546
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,352
I don't know.

547
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,590
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

548
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,950
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

549
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,071
They only work on the weak-minded.

550
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,998
All right.

551
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,190
I was 1 2.
His name was Palo.

552
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,675
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Programme.

553
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,712
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

554
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,070
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

555
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,111
All right, I get the picture.

556
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,277
Whatever happened to him?

557
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,994
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

558
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,076
Maybe he was the smart one.

559
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,350
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

560
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,516
I like two or three...

561
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,631
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

562
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,471
I don't think the system works.

563
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,155
How would you have it work?

564
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,309
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

565
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,149
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

566
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,032
and then do it.

567
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,832
That's exactly what we do.

568
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,871
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

569
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,797
Well, then they should be made to.

570
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,832
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

571
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,916
- You?
- Of course not me.

572
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,873
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

573
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,629
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

574
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,230
Well, if it works.

575
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,758
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

576
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,314
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

577
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,189
Ani, are you all right?

578
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,952
Boba, is your father here?

579
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,915
Yep.

580
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,996
May we see him?

581
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,791
Sure.

582
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,396
Dad, Taun We's here.

583
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,395
Jango, welcome back.

584
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,551
Was your trip productive?

585
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,511
Fairly.

586
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,269
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

587
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,073
He's come to check on our progress.

588
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,153
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

589
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,158
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

590
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,795
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

591
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,676
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

592
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,352
Possibly.

593
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,471
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

594
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,831
Boba, <i>rood eht so-heeck.</i>

595
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,353
Master who?

596
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,233
Sifo-Dyas.

597
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,874
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

598
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,517
Never heard of him.

599
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,069
Really?

600
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,433
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

601
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,913
Curious.

602
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,916
Do you like your army?

603
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,597
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

604
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,032
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

605
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,196
Thank you for your time,Jango.

606
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,911
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

607
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,670
What is it, Dad?

608
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,911
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

609
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,758
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

610
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,836
" Aggressive negotiations''?
What's that?

611
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,277
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.

612
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,752
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

613
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,036
From the moment I met you...

614
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,190
all those years ago...

615
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,478
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

616
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,395
And now that I'm with you again...

617
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,031
I'm in agony.

618
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,995
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

619
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,429
The thought of not being with you--

620
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,111
I can't breathe.

621
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,671
I'm haunted by the kiss...

622
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,633
that you should never have given me.

623
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,275
My heart is beating...

624
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,198
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

625
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,073
You are in my very soul...

626
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,156
tormenting me.

627
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,876
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

628
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,836
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

629
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,437
I can't.

630
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,432
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

631
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,393
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

632
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,476
No, you listen.

633
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,516
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

634
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,155
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

635
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,355
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

636
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,835
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

637
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,196
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

638
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,231
Then you do feel something.

639
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,238
I will not let you give up
your future for me.

640
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,430
You are asking me to be rational.

641
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,670
That is something
I know I cannot do.

642
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,237
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

643
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,271
but I can't.

644
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,794
I will not give in to this.

645
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,756
Well, you know...

646
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,553
it wouldn't have to be that way.

647
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,399
We could keep it a secret.

648
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,677
We'd be living a lie...

649
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,995
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

650
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,230
I couldn't do that.

651
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,113
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

652
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,878
No. You're right.

653
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,197
It would destroy us.

654
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,109
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

655
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,478
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

656
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,592
it will take more time to grow them.

657
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,392
I won't forget, and thank you.

658
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,272
Thank you.

659
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,911
R4!

660
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,191
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

661
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,671
<i>I have successfully made contact</i>
<i>with the prime minister of Kamino.</i>

662
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,509
<i>They are using a bounty hunter named</i>
<i>Jango Fett to create a clone army.</i>

663
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,995
<i>I have a strong feeling</i>
<i>that this bounty hunter...</i>

664
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,111
<i>is the assassin we are looking for.</i>

665
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,117
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

666
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,196
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

667
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,073
<i>No, Master.</i>
<i>There appears to be no motive.</i>

668
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,953
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

669
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,913
Clear your mind must be...

670
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,033
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

671
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,912
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

672
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,952
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed</i>
<i>an order for a clone army...</i>

673
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,516
<i>at the request of the senate</i>
<i>almost ten years ago.</i>

674
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,999
<i>I was under the impression</i>
<i>he was killed before that.</i>

675
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,476
<i>Did the council ever authorize</i>
<i>the creation of a clone army?</i>

676
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,397
No. Whoever placed that order...

677
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,670
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

678
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,270
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

679
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,313
<i>Yes, Master.</i>
<i>I will report back when I have him.</i>

680
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,350
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

681
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,516
we could not see.

682
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,830
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

683
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,916
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

684
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,912
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

685
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,190
If informed the senate is...

686
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,675
multiply our adversaries will.

687
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,798
No.

688
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,997
Mom, no.

689
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,556
Don't go.

690
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,397
I don't want to disturb you.

691
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,557
Your presence is soothing.

692
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,351
You had another nightmare last night.

693
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,795
Jedi don't have nightmares.

694
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,231
I heard you.

695
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,871
I saw my mother.

696
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,751
She is suffering, Padmé.

697
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,192
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

698
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,474
She is in pain.

699
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,751
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

700
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,791
but I have to go.

701
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,551
I have to help her.

702
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,031
I'll go with you.

703
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,310
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

704
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,757
Dad, look!

705
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,669
Boba, get on board!

706
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,478
Oh, not good.

707
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,113
Wait right there.

708
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,151
Okey-okey.

709
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,032
<i>Chut-chut,</i> Watto.

710
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,110
Let me help you with that.

711
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,391
What? What do you want?

712
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,875
Wait! You're a Jedi!

713
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,037
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

714
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,590
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

715
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,838
Ani?

716
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,352
Little Ani?

717
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,077
Nahhh.

718
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,394
You are Ani! It is you!

719
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,877
You sure sprouted, huh?

720
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,114
AJedi! Whattaya know!

721
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,949
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

722
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,479
My mother.

723
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,989
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

724
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,472
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

725
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,795
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

726
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,878
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

727
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,555
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

728
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,591
At least I think it was Lars.

729
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,076
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

730
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,395
Can ya beat that, eh?

731
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,756
Do you know where they are now?

732
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,631
Long way from here.

733
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,038
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

734
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,071
I'd like to know.

735
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,319
Sure. Absolutely!

736
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,316
Let's go look at my records, huh?

737
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,472
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

738
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,876
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

739
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,150
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

740
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,999
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

741
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,437
Seismic charges!

742
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,834
Stand by.

743
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,680
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

744
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,719
Watch out!

745
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,274
Get him, Dad! Fire!

746
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,554
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

747
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,233
We got him!

748
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,271
We'll just have to finish him.

749
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,550
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

750
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,039
Fire them now!

751
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,075
We won't be seeing him again.

752
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,120
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

753
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,629
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

754
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,151
Stay with the ship, R2.

755
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,909
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C--

756
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,837
3PO?

757
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,392
The maker!

758
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,078
Master Ani!

759
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,873
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

760
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,638
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

761
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,273
Hello, 3PO.

762
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,109
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

763
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,117
I've come to see my mother.

764
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,836
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

765
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,992
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

766
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,315
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

767
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,078
Owen Lars.

768
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,270
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

769
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,311
I'm Padmé.

770
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,955
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

771
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,833
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

772
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,238
Is my mother here?

773
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,998
No, she's not.

774
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,798
Cliegg Lars.

775
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,831
Shmi is my wife.

776
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,798
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

777
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,078
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

778
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,953
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

779
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,673
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

780
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,031
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

781
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,110
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

782
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,037
when they took her.

783
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,556
Those Tuskens walk like men...

784
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,071
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

785
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,752
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

786
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,639
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

787
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,153
I just couldn't ride any more
until I heal.

788
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,877
I don't want to give up on her...

789
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,719
but she's been gone a month.

790
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,718
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

791
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,197
Where are you going?

792
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,636
To find my mother.

793
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,519
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

794
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,633
You're gonna have to stay here.

795
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,320
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

796
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,317
I won't be long.

797
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,751
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

798
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,155
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

799
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,953
What about the senator
from Naboo?

800
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,516
Is she dead yet?

801
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,954
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

802
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,275
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

803
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,312
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

804
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,477
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

805
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,757
As I explained to you earlier...

806
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,952
I am quite convinced
that 1 0,000 more systems...

807
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,753
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

808
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,478
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

809
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,038
The Techno Union army...

810
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,799
is at your disposal, Count.

811
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,996
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

812
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,917
Good. Very good.

813
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,276
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

814
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,995
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

815
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,152
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

816
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,554
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

817
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,229
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

818
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,511
Mom?

819
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,717
Ani?

820
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,638
Ani?

821
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,398
Is it you?

822
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,956
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

823
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,913
You look so handsome.

824
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,191
My son.

825
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,959
My grown-up son.

826
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,590
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

827
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,551
I missed you.

828
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,191
Now I am complete.

829
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,878
I love y--

830
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,032
Stay with me, Mom. Everything--

831
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,116
I love--

832
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,955
I love--

833
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,676
<i>Anakin!</i>

834
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,599
<i>No!</i>

835
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,718
What is it?

836
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,070
Pain, suffering...

837
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,551
death I feel.

838
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,912
Something terrible has happened.

839
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,358
Young Skywalker is in pain...

840
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,277
terrible pain.

841
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,350
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

842
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,074
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

843
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,511
We'll have to try something else.

844
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,993
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

845
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,912
It's much closer.

846
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,870
Anakin, do you copy?

847
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,833
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

848
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,190
He's not on Naboo, R4.

849
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,750
I'm going to try and widen the range.

850
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,917
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

851
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,917
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

852
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,395
but it's coming from Tatooine.

853
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,388
What in the blazes is he doing there?

854
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,397
I told him to stay on Naboo.

855
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,349
We haven't got much time.

856
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,436
Anakin, do you copy?

857
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,516
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

858
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,951
<i>Retransmit this message--</i>

859
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,474
<i>Anakin, do you copy?</i>

860
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,830
<i>My long-range transmitter</i>
<i>has been knocked out.</i>

861
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,190
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

862
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,831
I brought you something.

863
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,996
Are you hungry?

864
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,557
The shifter broke.

865
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,033
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

866
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,756
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

867
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,877
But I couldn't--

868
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,551
Why'd she have to die?

869
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,911
Why couldn't I save her?

870
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,996
I know I could have!

871
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,154
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

872
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,320
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

873
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,871
Someday I will be.

874
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,714
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

875
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,316
I promise you.

876
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,270
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

877
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,708
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

878
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,796
He's holding me back!

879
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,956
What's wrong, Ani?

880
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,157
I killed them.

881
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,717
I killed them all.

882
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,277
They're dead.

883
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,391
Every single one of them.

884
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,357
And not just the men...

885
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,151
but the women...

886
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,111
and the children too.

887
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,996
They're like animals...

888
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,350
and I slaughtered them like animals!

889
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,831
I hate them!

890
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,837
To be angry is to be human.

891
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,757
I'm a Jedi.

892
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,637
I know I'm better than this.

893
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,392
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

894
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,430
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

895
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,236
Goodbye, my darling wife.

896
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,911
And thank you.

897
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,270
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

898
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,477
I wasn't strong enough.

899
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,077
But I promise I won't fail again.

900
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,556
I miss you...

901
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,711
so much.

902
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,960
R2? What are you doing here?

903
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,799
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

904
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,752
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

905
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,149
<i>Anakin, my long-range transmitter</i>
<i>has been knocked out.</i>

906
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,430
<i>Retransmit this message</i>
<i>to Coruscant.</i>

907
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,876
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,</i>
<i>Jango Fett...</i>

908
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,036
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis.</i>

909
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,630
<i>The Trade Federation is</i>
<i>to take delivery of a droid army here...</i>

910
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,671
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...</i>

911
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,110
<i>is behind the assassination attempts</i>
<i>on Senator Amidala.</i>

912
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,276
<i>The Commerce Guilds</i>
<i>and the Corporate Alliance...</i>

913
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,915
<i>have both pledged their armies</i>
<i>to Count Dooku and are forming--</i>

914
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,996
<i>Wait.</i>

915
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,837
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

916
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,632
I agree.

917
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,150
<i>We will deal with Count Dooku.</i>

918
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,670
<i>The most important thing for you</i>
<i>is to stay where you are.</i>

919
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,394
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

920
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,954
<i>That is your first priority.</i>

921
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,277
Understood, Master.

922
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,311
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

923
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,352
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

924
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,471
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

925
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,477
If he's still alive.

926
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,834
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

927
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,349
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

928
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,035
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

929
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,232
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

930
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,476
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

931
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,190
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

932
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,117
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

933
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,798
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

934
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,797
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

935
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,151
The debate is over.

936
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,113
Now we need that clone army.

937
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,038
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

938
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,469
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

939
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,272
before the separatists attack.

940
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,197
This is a crisis.

941
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,278
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

942
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,358
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

943
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,750
But what senator would have
the courage...

944
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,314
to propose such a radical amendment?

945
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,353
If only Senator Amidala were here.

946
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,632
Traitor.

947
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,157
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

948
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,236
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

949
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,828
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

950
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,428
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

951
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,836
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

952
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,430
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

953
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,189
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

954
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,629
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

955
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,513
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

956
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,437
Do you know him?

957
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,994
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

958
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,951
The Geonosians don't trust them.

959
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,833
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

960
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,913
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

961
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,915
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

962
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,556
I wish he were still alive.

963
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,554
I could use his help right now.

964
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,756
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

965
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,233
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

966
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,794
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

967
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,876
just as you were once his.

968
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,916
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

969
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,918
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

970
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,679
- The truth?
- The truth.

971
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,991
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

972
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,076
of the dark lord of the Sith?

973
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,919
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

974
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,113
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

975
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,634
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

976
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,151
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

977
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,753
I don't believe you.

978
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,110
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

979
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,312
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

980
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,835
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

981
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,918
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

982
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,836
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

983
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,788
and together we will destroy the Sith!

984
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,675
I will never join you, Dooku.

985
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,598
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

986
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,873
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

987
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,514
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

988
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,758
Senators, "dellow felagates'':

989
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,714
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

990
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,355
mesa propose that the senate...

991
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,950
give immediately emergency powers...

992
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,594
to the supreme chancellor.

993
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,556
Palpatine! Palpatine!

994
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,637
Order! We shall have order!

995
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,431
It is with great reluctance...

996
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,551
that I have agreed to this calling.

997
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,668
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

998
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,590
The power you give me...

999
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:48,032
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1000
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:56,956
And as my first act
with this new authority...

1001
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:01,278
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

1002
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,995
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1003
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,117
It is done, then.

1004
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,715
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1005
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,549
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1006
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,109
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1007
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,876
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

1008
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,956
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1009
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,677
That'll do.

1010
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,558
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1011
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,671
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1012
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,597
As a member of the senate...

1013
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,439
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1014
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,677
Don't worry.

1015
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,115
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

1016
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,752
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1017
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,677
they would have asked for it.

1018
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,792
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behaviour.

1019
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,677
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1020
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,148
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1021
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,397
"What does that mean?''

1022
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,114
That means I am in charge here!

1023
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,798
Where are you going now?

1024
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,276
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1025
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,232
Idiot!

1026
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,032
Please wait.

1027
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,631
Do you know where you're going?

1028
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,318
Wait.

1029
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,638
Oh, my goodness!

1030
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,239
Shut me down!

1031
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,197
Machines making machines.

1032
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,719
How perverse!

1033
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,993
Calm down, R2!

1034
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,475
I almost fell.

1035
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,477
You'll get your chance--

1036
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,152
I'm scrap.

1037
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,475
It's a nightmare!

1038
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,077
I want to go home!

1039
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,357
What did I do to deserve this?

1040
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,796
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1041
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,195
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

1042
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,033
Oh, no!

1043
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,638
Uh-oh.

1044
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,997
I'm so confused.

1045
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,912
Not again!

1046
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,117
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1047
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,233
Don't move,Jedi!

1048
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,793
Take him away.

1049
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,792
Don't be afraid.

1050
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,391
I'm not afraid to die.

1051
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,999
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1052
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,674
What are you talking about?

1053
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,076
I love you.

1054
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,597
You love me?

1055
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,997
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1056
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,558
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1057
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,278
and that it would destroy our lives.

1058
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,310
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1059
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,992
I truly...

1060
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,269
deeply love you...

1061
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,908
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1062
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,234
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1063
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:42,272
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1064
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,357
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1065
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,759
Good job.

1066
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,512
Settle down. Settle down.

1067
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,909
Let the executions begin.

1068
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,158
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1069
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:12,069
-Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1070
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,236
She seems to be on top of things.

1071
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,278
She can't do that!

1072
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,231
Shoot her... or something!

1073
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,193
Jump!

1074
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,710
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1075
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,398
Jango! Finish her off!

1076
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,592
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1077
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,599
Master Windu.

1078
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,915
How pleasant of you to join us.

1079
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,951
This party's over.

1080
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,150
Brave...

1081
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,510
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1082
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,392
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1083
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,750
I don't think so.

1084
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,233
We'll see.

1085
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,868
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1086
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,355
What's all this noise?
A battle!

1087
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,550
There's been some terrible mistake!

1088
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,274
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1089
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,992
Die,Jedi dogs!

1090
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,792
Oh! What did I say?

1091
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:09,671
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1092
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,918
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1093
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,156
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1094
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,957
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1095
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,550
R2, what are you doing here?

1096
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,914
What are you doing?

1097
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:08,554
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1098
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,352
My neck!

1099
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,472
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1100
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,236
I'm quite beside myself.

1101
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:33,672
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1102
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,469
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1103
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,878
Master Windu...

1104
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,116
you have fought gallantly...

1105
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:08,119
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1106
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,228
Now...

1107
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,475
it is finished.

1108
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,352
Surrender...

1109
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,194
and your lives will be spared.

1110
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,998
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1111
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,109
Then...

1112
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,511
I'm sorry, old friend.

1113
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,113
Look!

1114
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:54,428
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1115
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,558
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1116
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,637
If Dooku escapes...

1117
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,309
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1118
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,432
Hold on!

1119
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,677
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1120
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,910
Good call, my young Padawan.

1121
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,795
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1122
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,911
That doesn't seem possible.

1123
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,589
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1124
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,952
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1125
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,911
There are too many.

1126
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:57,479
Our communications have been jammed.

1127
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,158
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1128
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,508
Yes, sir.

1129
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,474
Sir...

1130
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:21,114
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1131
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,231
To the forward command centre
take me.

1132
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:50,239
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

1133
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,389
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1134
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,272
Very good.

1135
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,478
Very good.

1136
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,511
This is not looking good at all!

1137
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:41,877
We must get the starships
back into space.

1138
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,554
We have to order a retreat.

1139
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,910
My master will never allow
the Republic...

1140
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,235
to get away with this treachery.

1141
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,472
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1142
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:00,479
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1143
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,874
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1144
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,309
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1145
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,834
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1146
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:13,711
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1147
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,592
Yes, sir.

1148
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:19,030
Move all quadrants to sector 51 5.

1149
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,919
Look over there!

1150
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,555
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1151
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,477
We're out of rockets, sir.

1152
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,319
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1153
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:13,315
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1154
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,308
Put the ship down!

1155
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:40,237
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1156
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:42,032
Follow that speeder!

1157
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,110
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1158
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:53,550
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1159
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:56,558
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1160
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,830
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1161
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,032
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1162
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:04,674
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1163
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,071
She would do her duty.

1164
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,676
The droid army is in full retreat.

1165
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:24,758
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1166
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,632
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1167
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,352
We'll take him together.

1168
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:57,357
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1169
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:08,556
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1170
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,511
Now... back down.

1171
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:17,872
I don't think so.

1172
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,754
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1173
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,838
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1174
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,429
Surely you can do better.

1175
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,957
Are you all right?

1176
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,672
Uh-huh.

1177
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,430
We'd better get back
to the forward command centre.

1178
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:59,073
No.

1179
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,556
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1180
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:04,557
Get a transport. Hurry!

1181
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:05,669
Right away.

1182
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,552
Brave of you, boy.

1183
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,916
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1184
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,553
I am a slow learner.

1185
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,152
Master Yoda.

1186
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:41,192
Count Dooku.

1187
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:44,517
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1188
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,358
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1189
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,798
The dark side I sense in you.

1190
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,593
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1191
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,238
Even you.

1192
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,912
Much to learn you still have.

1193
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:47,077
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1194
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:49,350
by our knowledge of the Force...

1195
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,788
but by our skills with a lightsabre.

1196
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,952
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1197
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,752
This is just the beginning.

1198
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:08,035
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1199
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,994
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1200
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:15,030
You have done well.

1201
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:17,391
I have good news for you, my lord.

1202
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,752
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1203
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,914
Everything is going as planned.

1204
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:38,268
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1205
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,711
It doesn't feel right.

1206
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,873
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1207
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,798
Lies, deceit...

1208
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,515
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1209
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,993
Nevertheless..

1210
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,759
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1211
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:57,076
I agree.

1212
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,957
Where is your apprentice?

1213
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:03,789
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1214
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,751
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1215
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:11,076
Victory?

1216
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,195
Victory, you say?

1217
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,869
