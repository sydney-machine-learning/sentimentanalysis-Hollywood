00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:54,512
<i>My planet
Arrakis is so beautiful</i>

3
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:56,073
<i>when the sun is low.</i>

4
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,752
<i>Rolling over the sands...</i>

5
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,632
<i>you can see spice in the air.</i>

6
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:20,272
<i>At nightfall,
the spice harvesters land.</i>

7
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:23,752
<i>The outsiders
race against time</i>

8
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,072
<i>to avoid the heat of the day.</i>

9
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:38,312
<i>They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.</i>

10
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:42,152
<i>Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.</i>

11
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:48,992
<i>These outsiders,
the Harkonnens,</i>

12
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,992
<i>came long before I was born.</i>

13
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:52,912
<i>By controlling
spice production,</i>

14
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,752
<i>they became obscenely rich.</i>

15
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:57,432
<i>Richer than
the Emperor himself.</i>

16
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:40,752
<i>Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,</i>

17
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:41,992
<i>but one day,</i>

18
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:45,272
<i>by Imperial decree,
they were gone.</i>

19
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,152
<i>Why did the Emperor
choose this path?</i>

20
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,792
<i>And who will
our next oppressors be?</i>

21
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:48,632
It's good you're up early.

22
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:51,232
Your father wants you
in full dress

23
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:52,952
before the Emperor's Herald
arrives.

24
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,032
Full dress?

25
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:57,512
Military?

26
00:03:57,592 --> 00:04:00,032
Ceremonial.

27
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,312
Why do we have to go
through all this

28
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,832
when it's already
been decided?

29
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,192
Ceremony.

30
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:06,832
Mm.

31
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:08,672
Thank you.

32
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:12,352
If you want it,
make me give it to you.

33
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:14,552
Use the Voice.

34
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,392
Mom, I just woke up.

35
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:26,232
Give me the water.

36
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:28,512
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

37
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:56,752
Give me the water.

38
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:09,671
Almost.

39
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:11,072
Almost?

40
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:13,472
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

41
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:16,312
- Mm-hmm.
- You look tired.

42
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:18,432
More dreams?

43
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,832
No.

44
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,232
<i>Extreme temperatures</i>

45
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:30,912
<i>and treacherous weather events</i>

46
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:34,592
<i>make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,</i>

47
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:36,472
<i>with sandstorms
powerful enough</i>

48
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,112
<i>to cut through metal.</i>

49
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:40,792
<i>Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen</i>

50
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:44,312
<i>have adapted
well enough to survive.</i>

51
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:48,672
<i>Preferring to inhabit the
remotest regions of Arrakis,</i>

52
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,592
<i>the Fremen share
the deep desert</i>

53
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,191
<i>with the giant sandworms</i>

54
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:55,552
<i>known to the Fremen</i>
<i>as</i> Shai-Hulud.

55
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:58,112
<i>Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe</i>

56
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,752
<i>their characteristic
blue eyes,</i>

57
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,712
<i>the Eyes of Ibad.</i>

58
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,672
<i>Little else is known
of the Fremen,</i>

59
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:09,632
<i>except that they are
dangerous and unreliable.</i>

60
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:12,312
<i>Fremen attacks
make spice harvesting</i>

61
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:14,192
<i>extremely hazardous.</i>

62
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,792
<i>For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen</i>

63
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:19,152
<i>which preserves life</i>

64
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:21,912
<i>and brings
enormous health benefits.</i>

65
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:23,552
<i>For the Imperium,</i>

66
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,672
<i>spice is used
by the navigators</i>

67
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,392
<i>of the Spacing Guild</i>

68
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,232
<i>to find safe paths
between the stars.</i>

69
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:31,472
<i>Without spice,</i>

70
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,431
<i>interstellar travel
is impossible,</i>

71
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:35,912
<i>making it by far</i>

72
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:39,072
<i>the most valuable substance
in the universe.</i>

73
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,472
Smile, Gurney.

74
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,511
I am smiling.

75
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:32,991
How much will it cost them,

76
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:35,471
traveling all this way
for this formality?

77
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:36,831
Three Guild Navigators.

78
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:40,432
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

79
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:58,631
By the grace of
Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

80
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,592
ascendant to
the Golden Lion Throne

81
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,392
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

82
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:07,551
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

83
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:10,431
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

84
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,911
representatives
of the Spacing Guild

85
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,152
and a sister
of the Bene Gesserit.

86
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,751
The Emperor has spoken.

87
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:23,832
"House Atreides
shall immediately

88
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,592
take control of Arrakis

89
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,712
and serve as its steward."

90
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:32,192
Do you accept?

91
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:43,751
We are House Atreides.

92
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:45,671
There is no call
we do not answer,

93
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,992
there is no faith
that we betray.

94
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:52,872
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

95
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,271
House Atreides accepts.

96
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:59,551
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

97
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:03,911
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

98
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,192
Your seal.

99
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:47,712
So, it's done?

100
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:50,671
It's done.

101
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,591
How was it?

102
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,032
<i>Stabilizers are too loose.</i>

103
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,112
- We'll dial it in.
- <i>Thank you, my friend.</i>

104
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:22,231
Got it.

105
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,871
Duncan.

106
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:24,991
<i>My boy.</i>

107
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:26,432
Hey. Hey.

108
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:27,991
<i>Paul, my boy.</i>

109
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,991
So, you're going
to Arrakis tomorrow.

110
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,471
With the advance team.

111
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:34,952
Yes, I'm going
to Arrakis tomorrow

112
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:36,231
with the advance team.

113
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,072
I'd like you
to take me with you.

114
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:40,631
You would?

115
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,432
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause no.

116
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:45,831
Duncan.

117
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,072
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

118
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,152
What's going on?

119
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,591
Can I trust you
with something?

120
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:52,872
Always. You know that.

121
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:00,911
I've been having dreams.

122
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,792
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

123
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:15,392
Okay.

124
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:16,632
So?

125
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:19,151
I saw you.

126
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,351
<i>With the Fremen.</i>

127
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,112
Ah.

128
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,551
So, I do find them.

129
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:29,871
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

130
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:33,311
Lanville!

131
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,271
I saw you lying dead.

132
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,871
Fallen in battle.

133
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:47,352
<i>It felt like
if I had been there,</i>

134
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,152
<i>you'd be alive.</i>

135
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,351
First off, I'm not gonna die.

136
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,552
You're not
taking me seriously.

137
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,592
That's why
you want to come with me.

138
00:11:58,671 --> 00:11:59,952
Listen.

139
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,632
Dreams make good stories,

140
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:04,031
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

141
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:06,112
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

142
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,432
Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

143
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:09,672
I did?

144
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:10,952
No.

145
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:14,951
Hey.

146
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:17,112
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

147
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,991
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

148
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,711
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

149
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,631
I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

150
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:58,912
Out of the question.

151
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,231
You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

152
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,392
like the rest of us.

153
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:02,711
I've been training
my whole life.

154
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:03,992
What is the point

155
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,311
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

156
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:06,592
You know why, Paul.

157
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,672
You're the future
of House Atreides.

158
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,071
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

159
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,792
Yes.

160
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:14,432
And look where that got him.

161
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:20,831
I need you by my side.

162
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:23,831
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

163
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,392
What danger?

164
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,271
The Fremen? The desert?

165
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:29,232
Political danger.

166
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:34,151
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

167
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,191
and this threatens
the Emperor.

168
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,392
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

169
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:41,472
he sets the stage for a war

170
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,591
which would weaken
both houses.

171
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,751
But if we hold firm,

172
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:48,831
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

173
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,111
we could be stronger
than ever.

174
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,751
What does that mean?

175
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,912
Mining spice,

176
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,432
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

177
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,672
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

178
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,111
No.

179
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:01,192
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

180
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,871
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

181
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:06,351
Here on Caladan,

182
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,831
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

183
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:12,592
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

184
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,431
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

185
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:18,831
Learn what I do.

186
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:20,591
What if I'm not, Dad?

187
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,511
Not what?

188
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:27,392
The future of House Atreides.

189
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:41,591
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

190
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,152
I wanted to be a pilot.

191
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,671
You never told me that.

192
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,591
Your grandfather said,

193
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:57,312
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

194
00:14:57,391 --> 00:15:00,872
He's called to it,
and he answers."

195
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:04,312
And if your answer is no...

196
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:10,351
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

197
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,311
my son.

198
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:26,831
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

199
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,951
In their memory...

200
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,112
give it a try.

201
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,672
Don't stand
with your back to the door.

202
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,311
How many times
do we have to tell you?

203
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:50,751
I could tell it was you

204
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,511
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

205
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,231
Someone
might imitate my stride.

206
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:56,511
I know the difference.

207
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,111
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

208
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:01,791
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

209
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,191
Choose your blade.

210
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:05,951
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

211
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,991
Give us a song instead.

212
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:13,432
That's rude.

213
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:31,711
Come on.

214
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,752
Come on.

215
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:33,992
Old man.

216
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:47,631
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

217
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,191
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

218
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,431
- Mood?
- Yeah.

219
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:58,591
What's mood to do with it?

220
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,351
You fight
when the necessity arises,

221
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,391
no matter the mood.

222
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,512
Now fight!

223
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,751
Come on!

224
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,231
I have you.

225
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,951
Aye.

226
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,631
But look down, my lord.

227
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,191
You'd have joined me in death.

228
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:30,071
I see you found the mood.

229
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,311
Will it be that bad?

230
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:45,791
You don't get it, do you?

231
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:47,071
You don't really understand

232
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,712
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

233
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,471
For 80 years,

234
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,592
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

235
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,072
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

236
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:00,191
Can you imagine the wealth?

237
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,111
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

238
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,591
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

239
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,591
They're not human,
they're brutal!

240
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,511
You have to be ready.

241
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,872
Lord Baron.

242
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,911
Rabban.

243
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,551
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

244
00:18:58,391 --> 00:18:59,831
It's done.

245
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,351
Very good.

246
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:06,232
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

247
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,271
How can the Emperor

248
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:10,791
take everything we've built

249
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,071
and give it to that Duke?

250
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,391
How?

251
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:17,271
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

252
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,991
What does he mean?

253
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:29,071
When is a gift not a gift?

254
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,151
The Atreides' voice is rising,

255
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:37,391
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

256
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,431
A dangerous, jealous man.

257
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,151
Paul.

258
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,231
Paul, wake up.

259
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,791
What's wrong?

260
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,071
Get dressed and come with me.

261
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:24,991
What is this?

262
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:27,871
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

263
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,991
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

264
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,471
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

265
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,351
She would like to meet you.

266
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:37,471
Why?

267
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:39,791
She wants to know
about your dreams.

268
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,871
How does she know
about my dreams?

269
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,911
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

270
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:49,271
He only needs a moment.

271
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,271
Hello, young master.

272
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,951
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

273
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:00,951
What's happening?

274
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,591
The Bene Gesserit say
they serve the greater good...

275
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:11,104
But, meaning no disrespect
to your lady mother...

276
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,225
they also serve their own designs.

277
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,783
What are you saying?

278
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:20,868
Go carefully.

279
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,311
His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

280
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:28,227
Tell no one of this.

281
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:38,911
Paul...

282
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:46,175
Remember your training.

283
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:11,151
<i>Who are you?</i>

284
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,511
Defiance in the eyes.

285
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,191
Like his father.

286
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,790
Leave us.

287
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:21,831
You must do everything

288
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:23,231
the Reverend Mother tells you.

289
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:27,991
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

290
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,191
Come here.

291
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,790
Kneel.

292
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:36,591
How dare you use
the Voice on me?

293
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,871
Put
your right hand in the box.

294
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:49,271
Your mother bade you obey me.

295
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:59,391
I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

296
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:01,991
A poison needle.

297
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,310
Instant death.

298
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,791
The test is simple.

299
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,311
Remove your hand from the box

300
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,911
and you die.

301
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,511
What's in the box?

302
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,751
Pain.

303
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:19,350
No need to call the guards.

304
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:20,990
<i>Your mother stands
behind that door.</i>

305
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:22,711
<i>No one would get past her.</i>

306
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:30,831
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

307
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,791
An animal caught in a trap

308
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,551
will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

309
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:38,471
What will you do?

310
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:11,111
Silence.

311
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,350
I must not fear.

312
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:24,551
I must not fear.

313
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,511
Fear is the mind-killer.

314
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,711
<i>Fear</i>

315
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,070
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

316
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,431
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

317
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:43,591
to pass over me
and through me.

318
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,631
And when it has gone past...

319
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,710
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path.

320
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:16,231
And where the fear
has gone,

321
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,031
there will be nothing.

322
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,270
Only I will remain.

323
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,591
Enough.

324
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:48,030
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

325
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:50,591
we sift people.

326
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:53,431
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

327
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,030
like an animal,

328
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:57,230
we could not let you live.

329
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,871
You inherit too much power.

330
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,030
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

331
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,790
Because you are Jessica's son.

332
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:06,390
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

333
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:08,951
Jessica?

334
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,951
You've been training him
in the Way.

335
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,750
Tell me about these dreams.

336
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:26,871
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

337
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:30,991
A girl.

338
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,671
On Arrakis.

339
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,071
Have you dreamt of her before?

340
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,271
Many times.

341
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,830
Do you often dream
things that happen

342
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:45,031
just as you dreamed them?

343
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:49,551
Not exactly.

344
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,591
Goodbye, young human.

345
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,911
I hope you live.

346
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,431
Did you have to go that far?

347
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:08,191
You chose
to train him in the Way,

348
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,111
in defiance of our rule.

349
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,670
He wields our power.

350
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:14,430
He had to be
tested to the limits.

351
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:17,631
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

352
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,591
You were told
to bear only daughters.

353
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,990
But you, in your pride,

354
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:22,910
thought you could
produce the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

355
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:24,351
Was I wrong?

356
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,070
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

357
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,311
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

358
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,311
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

359
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,070
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

360
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:37,630
We have other prospects

361
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,991
if he fails his promise.

362
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,870
Do you see so little hope?

363
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:46,270
On Arrakis,
we have done

364
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,910
all we can for you.

365
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,751
A path has been laid.

366
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,990
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

367
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,591
Paul.

368
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,950
What does it mean?

369
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,870
That I could be The One?

370
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,230
You heard.

371
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:49,671
The Bene Gesserit serve

372
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,151
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

373
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,351
but there's more to it.

374
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,870
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

375
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,311
from the shadows.

376
00:29:58,991 --> 00:29:59,951
I know.

377
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,390
You don't know everything.

378
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,670
For thousands of years,

379
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,270
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

380
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,390
- to bring forth...
- The One?

381
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:11,911
A mind...

382
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,750
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

383
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,271
Past and future.

384
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:24,391
Who can help us
into a better future.

385
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,110
We think he's very close now.

386
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:32,071
Some believe he's here.

387
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,831
All part of a plan.

388
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:51,271
Shield.

389
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,791
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

390
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,790
Blown past falling sand..."

391
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:19,710
Thufir Hawat.

392
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,430
Young master!

393
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,710
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

394
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,630
Exciting, to say the least.

395
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,071
My lord.

396
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,710
How are you, old friend?

397
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,030
My advance team
has secured the city.

398
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,990
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

399
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,830
My lady.

400
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,991
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

401
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,990
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

402
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,950
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

403
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,190
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

404
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,110
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

405
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,990
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

406
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,950
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

407
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:23,270
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

408
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,151
They follow
their old masters' rules.

409
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,310
Mandatory attendance.

410
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,590
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

411
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,350
Atreides!

412
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,870
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

413
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,550
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

414
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,990
Atreides! Atreides!

415
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,670
Let's get you
out of the sun.

416
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,150
The heat can kill
in this place.

417
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,390
They were pointing at us.

418
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,630
What are they shouting?

419
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,470
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
"Voice from the Outer World."

420
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,150
It's their name for "messiah."

421
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,390
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

422
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,830
Planting superstitions.

423
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,590
Preparing the way, Paul.

424
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,910
These people
have waited for centuries

425
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,670
for the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

426
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,390
They see you,

427
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,030
they see the signs.

428
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,870
They see
what they've been told to see.

429
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,750
We're good to go.

430
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,750
Shield Wall.

431
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,630
Protects the city
from the weather

432
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,150
and the worms.

433
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,790
The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

434
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,990
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

435
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,550
on our comms system.

436
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,030
It's so quiet.

437
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,990
Yeah.

438
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,870
That's what worries me, too.

439
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,030
There's the spaceport

440
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,629
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

441
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,710
Our two
most vulnerable points.

442
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,030
I want you guarding them.

443
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,630
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

444
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,670
- we're dead here.
- My lord.

445
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,270
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

446
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,870
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

447
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,310
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

448
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,870
That's what they say.

449
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,510
That's what they say.

450
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,470
Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

451
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,030
What is your name?

452
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,189
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

453
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,870
The rest of you may go.

454
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,030
Thank you.

455
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,110
Shadout.

456
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,910
It's an old Chakobsa word.

457
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,030
"Well-dipper."

458
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,030
You know the ancient tongues?

459
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,510
I know many things.

460
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,630
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

461
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,230
Not now.
If you mean to harm me,

462
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,710
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

463
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,190
it won't be enough.

464
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:09,270
The weapon is meant as a gift

465
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:12,270
if you are truly The One.

466
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:28,990
Do you know this?

467
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,829
It's a crysknife.

468
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,830
Do you know its meaning?

469
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,501
Be ready for violence.

470
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:42,430
It's a maker...

471
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:49,670
A maker of the deep desert.

472
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:54,430
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

473
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,990
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

474
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:58,670
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

475
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,790
The mother and the son.

476
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,150
It is yours.

477
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:13,150
Tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

478
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:44,710
<i>Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

479
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:48,750
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

480
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,830
Hello.

481
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,710
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

482
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,950
They're out here.

483
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,549
Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

484
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,510
They don't care
about heatstroke.

485
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,269
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

486
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,350
Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

487
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,790
They can't survive without me.

488
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,030
Each one of these

489
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,589
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

490
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:31,230
Twenty palm trees.

491
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,910
A hundred lives.

492
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,950
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

493
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:38,390
No, no, no.

494
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,990
These are sacred.

495
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:45,590
Old dream.

496
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,230
<i>The largest and most dangerous</i>

497
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:58,149
<i>organism on Arrakis
is the sandworm,</i>

498
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,190
<i>capable of reaching
400 meters in length.</i>

499
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:04,550
<i>To avoid making
rhythmic noises,</i>

500
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:06,070
<i>which attract the sandworms,</i>

501
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,949
<i>the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,</i>

502
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,910
<i>a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm</i>

503
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:16,829
<i>which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.</i>

504
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,429
<i>What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis</i>

505
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,030
<i>is thanks to the Fremen,</i>

506
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,910
<i>who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants</i>

507
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,910
<i>such as saguaro, burrobush,</i>

508
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:30,910
<i>sand-verbena and incense bush.</i>

509
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,109
<i>The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,</i>

510
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,509
<i>stretching more than
450 feet deep.</i>

511
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,389
<i>These plants cling to life</i>

512
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,630
<i>in a parched,
nutrient-poor landscape.</i>

513
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:52,549
It's a hunter-seeker.

514
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,589
The operator must be nearby.

515
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:00,830
<i>The Harkonnen agent
was cemented</i>

516
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,709
<i>into that hole six weeks ago.</i>

517
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,430
<i>Ran the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe</i>

518
00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:05,549
<i>inside the walls.</i>

519
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:09,750
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

520
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:11,189
You have my resignation.

521
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,510
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

522
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:13,750
Sire, my honor demands...

523
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,469
They tried to take
the life of my son!

524
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,990
I don't give a damn
about your honor.

525
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:20,549
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

526
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,789
Your Grace.

527
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:30,949
The thing must leave.

528
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,429
You can speak
without fear.

529
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,710
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

530
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:37,190
Get out.

531
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:43,110
It understands.

532
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:44,669
Activate silence.

533
00:45:49,257 --> 00:45:51,946
What is the Emperor's message?

534
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:55,040
He will strengthen your hand.

535
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:59,345
With his Sardaukar army.

536
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,829
It must
never be known.

537
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,709
There's
no satellites over Arrakis.

538
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,269
The Atreides
will die in the dark.

539
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,950
On that matter,

540
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:13,069
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

541
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,030
But his wife
is under our protection

542
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:17,630
and by extension, her son.

543
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:20,110
Allow them
the dignity of exile.

544
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,949
House Harkonnen
would never dream

545
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,869
of violating
the sanctity of your order.

546
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,469
I give you my word.

547
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,150
We will not harm them.

548
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:54,029
If the Duke's son lives...

549
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:56,509
No Atreides will live.

550
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,909
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

551
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,030
She sees too much.

552
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,789
I said I would not harm them.

553
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:03,070
And I shall not.

554
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,349
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

555
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:08,989
And the desert takes the weak.

556
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,189
My desert.

557
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:16,790
My Arrakis.

558
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:20,229
My Dune.

559
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,550
Your first
strategy meeting.

560
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:26,790
Paul Atreides,

561
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:28,710
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

562
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:29,869
like a hero of old.

563
00:47:32,189 --> 00:47:34,269
Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

564
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:35,589
Gotta keep an eye on you.

565
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:37,669
Attention!

566
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:46,670
Let's get started.

567
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,749
Thufir. Operations.

568
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:53,390
I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

569
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:56,989
The Harkonnens were taking

570
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,390
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

571
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:03,029
"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

572
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,549
and the treasure
hid in the sand."

573
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,909
We won't see profits
like that for a while.

574
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:09,069
Not with the equipment
they left us.

575
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,549
How bad is it?

576
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:18,949
These are spice silos.

577
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,229
We're meant
to fill every crate.

578
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,149
All of them?

579
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:27,950
Every 25 standard days.

580
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:30,270
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

581
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,989
But who's
meant to arbitrate?

582
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,229
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

583
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,550
to oversee the transition?

584
00:48:34,629 --> 00:48:35,989
Who did the Emperor appoint?

585
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,749
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

586
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:40,269
Been here 20 years.

587
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:42,109
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

588
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:45,110
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

589
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:46,509
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

590
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,950
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

591
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:50,430
A meeting's long overdue.

592
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,630
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

593
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:54,150
A hostage.

594
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:55,469
I love it.

595
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:56,589
Hmm.

596
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:58,829
He's here, my lord.

597
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,669
Take care
of them. They are friends.

598
00:49:23,749 --> 00:49:24,669
Duncan!

599
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:26,069
Ah! My boy!

600
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:32,749
I swear you're getting taller.

601
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,429
Well,
you smell much worse.

602
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:39,869
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

603
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:40,989
Hidden in the desert,

604
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:42,710
in a community
called a <i>sietch.</i>

605
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:44,029
Stilgar, the leader
of that <i>sietch,</i>

606
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,829
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

607
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,149
This <i>sietch,</i> how is it hidden?

608
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:49,270
It's underground.

609
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:51,229
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

610
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:52,909
How big was the place?

611
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,349
I'd say 10,000 people.

612
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,909
And there are
hundreds of <i>sietches.</i>

613
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,430
Millions of Fremen.

614
00:50:00,189 --> 00:50:01,589
You were right.

615
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:04,869
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

616
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:07,069
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

617
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:08,549
I never saw them.

618
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,230
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

619
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:12,829
And I gotta tell you,

620
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,229
I have never come
so close to dying.

621
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:17,989
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

622
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:19,590
They fight like demons.

623
00:50:19,669 --> 00:50:21,469
Desert power.

624
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,469
Duncan.

625
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:26,949
- Well done.
- Thank you, my lord.

626
00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:28,349
Sire.

627
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:30,909
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

628
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,949
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

629
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:35,189
Let him pass.

630
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,469
Stop there.

631
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,150
Hey! Hey!

632
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,550
Mm.

633
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,470
Stilgar.

634
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:02,509
Welcome.

635
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:05,950
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

636
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,749
of any man that respects mine.

637
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:11,909
Hmm.

638
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:16,469
Hold.

639
00:51:17,669 --> 00:51:19,509
Thank you, Stilgar,

640
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:22,869
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

641
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,189
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

642
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:33,909
I'm glad you've come.

643
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,670
I believe your people and mine

644
00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:37,989
have much
to offer one another.

645
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,389
No, no, you are Outworlders.

646
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,069
You come here for the spice,

647
00:51:41,149 --> 00:51:43,509
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

648
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:46,189
That's true.

649
00:51:48,029 --> 00:51:50,829
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

650
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:53,349
Name what you want.

651
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:54,589
If it's in my power to grant,

652
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:56,069
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

653
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,909
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our <i>sietches.</i>

654
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,709
Do not trespass in our lands.

655
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:05,109
The desert was ours
long before you came.

656
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:06,909
So, come and dig your spice,

657
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:08,149
but when you have it,

658
00:52:08,229 --> 00:52:10,270
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

659
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:12,069
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

660
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:14,829
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

661
00:52:14,909 --> 00:52:17,389
Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

662
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:18,749
The Emperor

663
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:21,469
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

664
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,229
to rule and protect.

665
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:25,709
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

666
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:28,509
if duty compels me.

667
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,389
But your <i>sietches</i>
will be yours forever.

668
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:33,949
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

669
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:40,029
That's very honorable.

670
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:42,669
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

671
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:44,829
Won't you stay?

672
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:46,229
We would honor you.

673
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:49,269
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

674
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:53,407
I recognize you.

675
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,669
I don't like him.

676
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,909
Our plan bears fruit.

677
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,349
But it will take time?

678
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:06,629
Yes.

679
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:09,749
It will take time.

680
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,709
Here, this is for you.

681
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:19,549
It's a paracompass.

682
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,029
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

683
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:24,629
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

684
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:26,749
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

685
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,429
The Fremen make these?

686
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:30,269
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

687
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:31,709
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

688
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:33,669
What the hell
is a sand compactor?

689
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:36,829
That's a sand compactor.

690
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:40,669
My God, man,
you've gone native.

691
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:41,989
You admire them.

692
00:53:43,229 --> 00:53:44,669
I do.

693
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:47,309
They're fierce but loyal.

694
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:49,109
They're attuned to the desert.

695
00:53:49,189 --> 00:53:50,389
Part of it.

696
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:52,509
It's part of them.

697
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:53,709
You wait till you see it.

698
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:55,869
It's beautiful out there.

699
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:00,949
<i>Sunrise warning, all workers.</i>

700
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,869
<i>Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.</i>

701
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,629
<i>We are currently 90 degrees,</i>

702
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,949
<i>and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.</i>

703
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,229
<i>Last warning call.</i>

704
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,229
The Judge of the Change, sire.

705
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:47,189
Dr. Liet Kynes.

706
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,629
My lord Duke.

707
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,909
Welcome to Arrakis.

708
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:52,989
You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

709
00:54:53,068 --> 00:54:54,909
Thank you for the stillsuits.

710
00:54:54,988 --> 00:54:56,989
They are of Fremen make.

711
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,109
The best.

712
00:54:58,189 --> 00:54:59,429
With your permission, sire,

713
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:00,829
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

714
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:01,988
Whoa.

715
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:03,829
It's all right.

716
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,509
It's all right.

717
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:11,029
Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

718
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:16,509
A stillsuit

719
00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:20,389
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

720
00:55:20,469 --> 00:55:21,989
Even this early
in the morning,

721
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,748
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

722
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:27,789
It cools the body

723
00:55:27,869 --> 00:55:31,549
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

724
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:34,789
Your body's movements
provide the power.

725
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,509
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

726
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:38,589
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

727
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,869
Mm.

728
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:41,229
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

729
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:43,509
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

730
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:44,869
Most impressive.

731
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,788
Let's have a look at you, lad.

732
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:51,389
You've...

733
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:52,629
worn a stillsuit before?

734
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:54,269
No, this is my first time.

735
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:58,908
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

736
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,749
Who taught you to do that?

737
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:02,789
It seemed the right way.

738
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,483
He shall know your ways as
though born to them.

739
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:11,229
Are you Fremen?

740
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:16,669
I am accepted
in both <i>sietch</i> and village.

741
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:19,309
Now, come and see
the spice sands

742
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:22,309
on which
your livelihood depends.

743
00:56:58,708 --> 00:56:59,869
What would you do

744
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:01,429
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

745
00:57:01,509 --> 00:57:03,549
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

746
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,148
It's worm territory.

747
00:57:07,669 --> 00:57:08,708
Dust cloud.

748
00:57:09,749 --> 00:57:11,868
I see it.

749
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:13,989
That's one of your harvesters.

750
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:39,988
You can see the spice

751
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:41,869
scattered over the surface.

752
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:45,229
A rich spice bed

753
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:46,708
by the color.

754
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:49,188
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

755
00:58:03,308 --> 00:58:05,829
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

756
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:08,949
Wormsign?

757
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:11,229
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

758
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:13,429
Worms travel deep
but get closer

759
00:58:13,509 --> 00:58:14,828
to the surface
when they attack.

760
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:17,028
If you are patient,

761
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,869
we should see one.

762
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:21,349
A worm always comes?

763
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:24,109
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

764
00:58:24,189 --> 00:58:26,188
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

765
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,668
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

766
00:58:28,749 --> 00:58:29,949
It attracts the worms

767
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:32,589
and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

768
00:58:35,229 --> 00:58:36,228
Is that a worm?

769
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,668
Big one.

770
00:58:49,749 --> 00:58:51,988
You have good eyes.

771
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:54,229
Calling crawler
Delta Ajax niner.

772
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:56,709
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

773
00:58:56,788 --> 00:58:59,388
<i>Who calls Delta Ajax niner?</i>

774
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,469
<i>Over.</i>

775
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:01,909
They seem pretty calm
about it.

776
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:04,389
Unlisted flight.
Imperium business.

777
00:59:04,468 --> 00:59:06,548
Wormsign north
and east of you.

778
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:08,549
3.7 kilometers.

779
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,108
<i>Delta Ajax niner,</i>

780
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:11,909
<i>this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.</i>

781
00:59:13,228 --> 00:59:15,428
<i>Stand by for contact fix.</i>

782
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:21,309
<i>Worm is on intercept course
to your position.</i>

783
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:22,909
<i>Contact in five minutes.</i>

784
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:24,709
So, what happens now?

785
00:59:24,788 --> 00:59:27,228
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

786
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:29,349
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

787
00:59:29,428 --> 00:59:30,989
<i>Calling
carryall Alpha Zero.</i>

788
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,829
<i>Ready for docking sequence.</i>

789
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:35,269
<i>Contact five minutes. Over.</i>

790
00:59:39,468 --> 00:59:41,508
<i>Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?</i>

791
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:46,988
There it is.

792
00:59:47,069 --> 00:59:48,348
<i>This is carryall Alpha Zero</i>

793
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:50,668
<i>to Delta Ajax niner.</i>

794
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:52,709
<i>Approaching from your east.</i>

795
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,549
<i>Correcting altitude and
preparing docking equipment.</i>

796
00:59:55,628 --> 00:59:58,989
<i>Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.</i>

797
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:02,389
<i>T-5.</i>

798
01:00:02,468 --> 01:00:03,868
<i>Copy that.</i>

799
01:00:03,949 --> 01:00:05,628
<i>Prepare
to be airborne in 30 seconds.</i>

800
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:07,909
<i>Docking sequence
initiated. Brace yourselves.</i>

801
01:00:11,148 --> 01:00:13,109
<i>Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.</i>

802
01:00:13,188 --> 01:00:14,589
<i>What is going on?</i>

803
01:00:14,668 --> 01:00:16,588
<i>It's one of
the anchors. It's dead.</i>

804
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:18,869
Shit.

805
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,909
<i>Carryall
unable to receive.</i>

806
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:22,788
<i>Unable to lift
without that anchor.</i>

807
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,509
<i>All call! All call!</i>

808
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:27,428
<i>Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!</i>

809
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:29,388
<i>Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.</i>

810
01:00:29,469 --> 01:00:30,868
<i>Hydraulics are dead.</i>

811
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:32,469
<i>We won't make it.
You have to evacuate.</i>

812
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:33,589
<i>Contact in four minutes.</i>

813
01:00:33,669 --> 01:00:34,588
<i>Try it again!</i>

814
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:35,349
How many men on that crawler?

815
01:00:35,428 --> 01:00:36,469
Crew of 21.

816
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,509
Our ships
can take six each.

817
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:38,708
That's still three short.

818
01:00:39,388 --> 01:00:40,389
We'll find a way.

819
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:54,348
<i>This is Duke Leto Atreides.</i>

820
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:57,908
<i>We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.</i>

821
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:59,909
<i>We'll set down on the west.</i>

822
01:01:09,789 --> 01:01:11,709
Shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

823
01:01:12,428 --> 01:01:13,749
Yes, Gurney,

824
01:01:13,828 --> 01:01:15,068
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

825
01:01:15,148 --> 01:01:16,629
Yes, sire.

826
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:18,229
And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

827
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:19,349
Guide them in.

828
01:01:19,428 --> 01:01:20,589
Delta Ajax niner,

829
01:01:20,668 --> 01:01:23,069
put seven men each
in my ships now.

830
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:20,949
<i>Contact in two minutes.</i>

831
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:25,668
<i>Getting close, guys.
We better abandon ship now.</i>

832
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:29,189
Where are they?

833
01:02:29,268 --> 01:02:31,229
<i>Sir,
there's protocol for a reason.</i>

834
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:33,908
<i>If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.</i>

835
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:35,548
<i>Besides, we've got
a full load of spice.</i>

836
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:37,588
- <i>We can't just leave it.</i>
- Damn the spice!

837
01:02:37,669 --> 01:02:40,188
I want every man
off that crawler now!

838
01:02:53,589 --> 01:02:54,628
Hey!

839
01:02:54,709 --> 01:02:55,748
Hey!

840
01:02:55,828 --> 01:02:58,269
Seven over here,
seven over there.

841
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:02,428
Go! Go! Go!

842
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:19,588
Kwisatz Haderach.

843
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:35,549
Kwisatz Haderach <i>awakes.</i>

844
01:03:44,629 --> 01:03:45,948
Hurry! Get on!

845
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:55,309
It's here!

846
01:03:58,148 --> 01:03:59,149
Paul!

847
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:02,709
Paul!

848
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:09,668
I recognize
your footsteps, old man.

849
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:11,828
Get up!

850
01:04:11,909 --> 01:04:14,349
Let's go!

851
01:04:14,428 --> 01:04:16,948
What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

852
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:18,229
Run!

853
01:04:42,868 --> 01:04:43,869
Hey!

854
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:03,948
Bless the Maker and His Water.

855
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,148
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

856
01:05:06,229 --> 01:05:09,028
May His passage
cleanse the world

857
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:11,508
and keep the world
for His people.

858
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:35,709
Hey!

859
01:05:35,788 --> 01:05:37,749
- You cannot take such risks.
- Yes, sir.

860
01:05:37,828 --> 01:05:39,068
You have responsibilities.

861
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:40,229
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

862
01:05:40,308 --> 01:05:41,268
Go.

863
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:43,308
Dr. Kynes.

864
01:05:45,068 --> 01:05:46,829
You saw it.

865
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:48,828
With your own eyes.
It's plain to see.

866
01:05:48,908 --> 01:05:51,069
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

867
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:52,989
We've been set up to fail.

868
01:05:53,068 --> 01:05:55,668
That carryall was just old.

869
01:05:55,748 --> 01:05:57,708
The desert
isn't kind to equipment.

870
01:05:59,508 --> 01:06:00,988
You know what will happen

871
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:03,468
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

872
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:09,029
I'm not here
to take your part.

873
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:12,988
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

874
01:06:15,508 --> 01:06:18,988
Take good care of your family.

875
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:25,188
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

876
01:06:40,908 --> 01:06:43,869
Spice is a psychoactive
chemical.

877
01:06:44,988 --> 01:06:46,869
You seem to be sensitive.

878
01:06:51,068 --> 01:06:52,068
You'll be fine.

879
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:55,669
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

880
01:07:04,668 --> 01:07:07,068
That wasn't
an allergic reaction.

881
01:07:08,908 --> 01:07:10,508
I had a vision.

882
01:07:12,908 --> 01:07:14,589
My eyes were wide open.

883
01:07:16,468 --> 01:07:17,469
What did you see?

884
01:07:53,388 --> 01:07:56,988
Kwisatz Haderach.

885
01:07:57,068 --> 01:07:59,989
<i>You can see.</i>

886
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,308
<i>It's confusing.</i>

887
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:42,868
<i>I thought I saw my death,</i>

888
01:08:42,948 --> 01:08:45,028
<i>only it wasn't.</i>

889
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:48,828
<i>I know a knife is important,
somehow.</i>

890
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,948
<i>Someone will hand me a blade,</i>

891
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:56,588
<i>but I don't know who,
or when, or where.</i>

892
01:08:58,588 --> 01:09:01,468
<i>Some things, though,
are crystal clear.</i>

893
01:09:01,548 --> 01:09:02,828
<i>I can feel it.</i>

894
01:09:07,348 --> 01:09:08,828
<i>I know you're pregnant.</i>

895
01:09:14,668 --> 01:09:16,388
You can't know that.

896
01:09:17,868 --> 01:09:19,028
I barely know that.

897
01:09:19,108 --> 01:09:21,028
It's only been a few weeks.

898
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:05,341
Why does the Baron need us?

899
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:08,599
Harkonnens outnumber the Atreides.

900
01:10:10,068 --> 01:10:11,268
Atreides legions

901
01:10:11,348 --> 01:10:13,588
are the finest
in the Imperium.

902
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,948
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

903
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:18,577
We are the Sardaukar.

904
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:20,270
The Emperor's blades.

905
01:10:20,756 --> 01:10:22,961
Those who stand against us fall.

906
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:25,468
Just so.

907
01:10:26,308 --> 01:10:27,908
Three battalions.

908
01:10:27,988 --> 01:10:28,988
As agreed.

909
01:10:34,153 --> 01:10:36,915
The Emperor commands it. It is done.

910
01:11:07,788 --> 01:11:09,948
There is something
you need to know about Paul.

911
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:11,868
No.

912
01:11:11,948 --> 01:11:14,268
Don't think I want to know.

913
01:11:14,348 --> 01:11:16,268
Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

914
01:11:16,348 --> 01:11:18,108
he hasn't been the same.

915
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:20,948
He's distracted.

916
01:11:22,788 --> 01:11:25,788
Jessica, you gave me a son.

917
01:11:25,868 --> 01:11:27,188
And from the moment
he was born,

918
01:11:27,268 --> 01:11:29,068
I never questioned you.

919
01:11:29,148 --> 01:11:31,508
I trusted you completely.

920
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,667
Even when
you walked in shadows.

921
01:11:34,788 --> 01:11:36,668
Now I'm asking you
this one thing.

922
01:11:39,188 --> 01:11:41,268
If anything happens...

923
01:11:42,307 --> 01:11:43,628
will you protect our son?

924
01:11:45,308 --> 01:11:46,748
With my life.

925
01:11:46,828 --> 01:11:49,148
I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

926
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,148
Will you protect Paul?

927
01:12:00,508 --> 01:12:02,428
Why are you
having these thoughts?

928
01:12:08,628 --> 01:12:11,068
Leto, this is not you.

929
01:12:16,428 --> 01:12:18,748
I thought we'd have more time.

930
01:12:36,908 --> 01:12:39,428
Have a good night,
Master Paul.

931
01:12:39,508 --> 01:12:41,348
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

932
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:51,628
<i>You need to sleep.</i>

933
01:12:53,388 --> 01:12:54,708
No.

934
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:56,028
Not like that.

935
01:13:10,668 --> 01:13:12,827
I should have married you.

936
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:29,548
Hawat. Security.

937
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:33,148
Security.

938
01:15:33,468 --> 01:15:35,067
Sir. Sir.

939
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:37,628
The shield's come down.

940
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:48,028
God in heaven.

941
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:50,947
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

942
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:34,867
Go! Go! Go!

943
01:17:34,227 --> 01:17:36,147
With me! With me!

944
01:18:03,948 --> 01:18:04,987
Atreides!

945
01:18:05,067 --> 01:18:06,187
Atreides!

946
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:36,148
- Sardaukar!
- Sardaukar!

947
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:00,267
I'm sorry, my lord.

948
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:05,827
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

949
01:19:08,268 --> 01:19:09,228
Why?

950
01:19:10,068 --> 01:19:12,027
I had no choice.

951
01:19:12,108 --> 01:19:15,788
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

952
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:18,307
They take her apart
like a doll.

953
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:21,308
I will buy her freedom.

954
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:22,908
And you are the price.

955
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:29,027
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

956
01:19:29,707 --> 01:19:31,347
And you

957
01:19:31,428 --> 01:19:33,228
will kill a man for me.

958
01:19:37,427 --> 01:19:40,827
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

959
01:19:40,908 --> 01:19:45,627
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

960
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:49,788
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

961
01:19:49,867 --> 01:19:52,467
It will be your last breath.

962
01:19:52,548 --> 01:19:54,787
But if you choose
your moment well,

963
01:19:56,027 --> 01:19:58,227
it will also be the Baron's.

964
01:21:28,107 --> 01:21:29,147
Paul.

965
01:21:42,493 --> 01:21:44,497
We'll drop them in the desert.

966
01:21:45,488 --> 01:21:48,253
Let the worms have them.

967
01:21:49,745 --> 01:21:51,893
Why don't we just cut their throats?

968
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,185
We could face a Truthsayer.

969
01:21:57,218 --> 01:21:59,773
We can say we didn't kill them.

970
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:09,209
The scarred one is deaf.

971
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:50,267
To hell, dogs!

972
01:24:21,947 --> 01:24:24,627
I've never had a highborn.

973
01:24:26,907 --> 01:24:28,187
You?

974
01:24:28,267 --> 01:24:30,267
Bene Gesserit
ain't all highborn.

975
01:24:30,347 --> 01:24:33,988
She's highborn enough for me.

976
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:36,227
Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

977
01:24:36,307 --> 01:24:38,227
And give her a long goodbye.

978
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:40,028
Don't you dare
touch my mother.

979
01:24:41,427 --> 01:24:42,427
Don't talk.

980
01:24:48,306 --> 01:24:50,635
Don't! You are not ready.

981
01:24:53,307 --> 01:24:54,747
Remove her gag.

982
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:05,187
Shut up.

983
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:08,240
Find the right pitch.

984
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:16,461
We're far enough.

985
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:18,868
Let's throw the boy out.

986
01:25:32,947 --> 01:25:34,147
Remove her gag.

987
01:25:39,987 --> 01:25:41,147
Kill him.

988
01:25:49,747 --> 01:25:50,867
Set us free.

989
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:05,067
Stop!

990
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:06,627
Cut the rope.

991
01:26:09,227 --> 01:26:10,627
Give me the knife.

992
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:21,947
Your pitch was too forced.

993
01:26:29,507 --> 01:26:31,027
It's a fremkit.

994
01:26:43,467 --> 01:26:44,627
They've crippled the ship.

995
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:55,787
Mmm.

996
01:28:13,347 --> 01:28:14,707
Ah.

997
01:28:16,107 --> 01:28:19,067
You have a wonderful kitchen,
cousin.

998
01:28:36,507 --> 01:28:39,227
This is Dr. Yueh's
handwriting.

999
01:28:39,307 --> 01:28:41,787
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

1000
01:28:41,867 --> 01:28:43,907
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

1001
01:28:43,987 --> 01:28:46,626
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

1002
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:54,667
My lord Baron.

1003
01:28:56,027 --> 01:28:57,147
Dr. Yueh.

1004
01:28:57,227 --> 01:28:58,826
The traitor.

1005
01:28:59,987 --> 01:29:01,067
What do you want?

1006
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:04,347
I jammed their comms

1007
01:29:04,427 --> 01:29:06,347
and lowered their shields.

1008
01:29:06,427 --> 01:29:07,627
Hmm.

1009
01:29:07,707 --> 01:29:09,867
I delivered
the Duke and his family.

1010
01:29:09,946 --> 01:29:12,347
The bargain
to the letter.

1011
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:14,827
And what was I to do for you?

1012
01:29:14,907 --> 01:29:16,987
Deliver my wife
from her agony.

1013
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:19,867
Yes.

1014
01:29:51,947 --> 01:29:54,467
I said I'd set her free.

1015
01:29:54,547 --> 01:29:56,306
That you could join her.

1016
01:30:00,266 --> 01:30:02,107
So, join her.

1017
01:30:10,627 --> 01:30:12,787
What do you think is next?

1018
01:30:16,307 --> 01:30:18,506
It's a thumper.

1019
01:30:18,587 --> 01:30:20,107
No stillsuits.

1020
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:22,027
The one thing
we actually need.

1021
01:30:26,907 --> 01:30:30,347
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

1022
01:30:31,507 --> 01:30:33,107
But no more.

1023
01:30:34,507 --> 01:30:38,587
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

1024
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,426
Tonight
the House of Atreides falls.

1025
01:30:44,107 --> 01:30:47,067
And your bloodline
ends forever.

1026
01:30:59,707 --> 01:31:00,707
What did you say?

1027
01:31:10,346 --> 01:31:11,746
Here I am...

1028
01:31:12,987 --> 01:31:14,707
<i>here I remain.</i>

1029
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:54,866
Kynes!

1030
01:32:56,067 --> 01:32:57,787
It's not safe for you here.

1031
01:32:57,866 --> 01:32:59,067
Will you tell
the Great Houses

1032
01:32:59,146 --> 01:33:00,547
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1033
01:33:00,626 --> 01:33:03,106
How the best of them
were murdered?

1034
01:33:03,187 --> 01:33:05,747
I am commanded to say nothing.

1035
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,306
To see nothing.

1036
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:12,347
The Emperor
sent us here to die.

1037
01:33:58,587 --> 01:34:00,866
There's spice
in the tent.

1038
01:35:22,986 --> 01:35:25,827
That's the future.
It's coming.

1039
01:35:39,787 --> 01:35:41,906
Holy war
spreading across the universe

1040
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:43,227
like unquenchable fire.

1041
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:58,427
Paul, you're scared.
I can see it.

1042
01:35:58,506 --> 01:36:01,467
Tell me, please,
what do you fear?

1043
01:36:10,066 --> 01:36:12,467
Somebody help me, please.

1044
01:36:13,147 --> 01:36:14,266
Paul.

1045
01:36:16,466 --> 01:36:18,106
It's coming.

1046
01:36:18,187 --> 01:36:19,547
<i>I see a holy war spreading</i>

1047
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:21,467
<i>across the universe
like unquenchable fire.</i>

1048
01:36:21,546 --> 01:36:24,426
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1049
01:36:24,507 --> 01:36:25,627
in my father's name.

1050
01:36:25,706 --> 01:36:26,587
Paul.

1051
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:28,266
Fanatical legions worshipping

1052
01:36:28,347 --> 01:36:30,427
<i>at the shrine
of my father's skull.</i>

1053
01:36:31,227 --> 01:36:33,587
<i>A war in my name!</i>

1054
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:35,426
Everyone's shouting my name!

1055
01:36:35,507 --> 01:36:36,467
Paul.

1056
01:36:39,987 --> 01:36:41,986
Paul Atreides.

1057
01:36:42,067 --> 01:36:44,906
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1058
01:36:44,986 --> 01:36:48,347
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1059
01:36:48,426 --> 01:36:51,107
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1060
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:52,306
Get off me!

1061
01:36:54,147 --> 01:36:55,746
You did this to me!

1062
01:36:55,826 --> 01:36:58,426
You Bene Gesserit
made me a freak!

1063
01:37:22,507 --> 01:37:24,707
My father is dead.

1064
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:01,146
Someone's near.

1065
01:38:02,027 --> 01:38:03,466
You need to drink.

1066
01:38:04,986 --> 01:38:07,186
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1067
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:16,386
Sweat and tears.

1068
01:38:19,906 --> 01:38:21,546
All right,
let's get out of here.

1069
01:39:31,786 --> 01:39:33,466
That's Duncan.

1070
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,467
Duncan.

1071
01:39:43,026 --> 01:39:44,186
My lady.

1072
01:39:44,266 --> 01:39:45,626
Paul.

1073
01:39:45,707 --> 01:39:47,986
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1074
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:49,226
We know.

1075
01:39:51,067 --> 01:39:52,346
My lord Duke.

1076
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:06,506
Here.

1077
01:40:08,506 --> 01:40:09,946
Drink this.

1078
01:40:16,906 --> 01:40:19,187
Harkonnens hit
every population center

1079
01:40:19,266 --> 01:40:20,666
on the planet at once.

1080
01:40:20,746 --> 01:40:22,786
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1081
01:40:22,866 --> 01:40:24,826
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1082
01:40:24,906 --> 01:40:27,346
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1083
01:40:27,426 --> 01:40:29,986
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1084
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:31,387
you know it.

1085
01:40:31,466 --> 01:40:36,026
So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1086
01:40:36,106 --> 01:40:39,106
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1087
01:40:39,186 --> 01:40:41,146
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1088
01:40:41,226 --> 01:40:43,106
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1089
01:41:02,746 --> 01:41:04,386
Storm's coming.

1090
01:41:17,706 --> 01:41:19,866
The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1091
01:41:19,946 --> 01:41:21,027
We'll be safe here.

1092
01:41:22,506 --> 01:41:24,666
Do you know
what this place is?

1093
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:27,067
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1094
01:41:30,306 --> 01:41:32,066
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1095
01:41:32,147 --> 01:41:34,466
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1096
01:41:37,346 --> 01:41:39,866
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1097
01:41:39,946 --> 01:41:41,026
The work had begun,

1098
01:41:41,106 --> 01:41:42,707
but then the spice
was discovered.

1099
01:41:42,786 --> 01:41:45,666
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1100
01:41:45,746 --> 01:41:46,906
Tanat,

1101
01:41:46,986 --> 01:41:48,506
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1102
01:41:48,586 --> 01:41:49,786
Yes, Liet.

1103
01:41:49,866 --> 01:41:51,226
Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1104
01:41:51,306 --> 01:41:52,706
Of course, Liet.

1105
01:41:54,946 --> 01:41:56,786
Who are you to the Fremen?

1106
01:42:44,746 --> 01:42:46,426
You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1107
01:42:46,506 --> 01:42:48,026
Dr. Kynes?

1108
01:42:49,226 --> 01:42:51,386
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1109
01:42:52,346 --> 01:42:53,466
The Sardaukar coming

1110
01:42:53,546 --> 01:42:55,186
and picking them off
one by one.

1111
01:42:58,026 --> 01:42:59,586
Only together
can they stand a chance

1112
01:42:59,666 --> 01:43:01,106
against the Imperium.

1113
01:43:03,066 --> 01:43:05,146
Would you bear witness?

1114
01:43:05,226 --> 01:43:08,226
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1115
01:43:08,306 --> 01:43:11,106
If they believe me,

1116
01:43:11,186 --> 01:43:12,826
there would be general warfare

1117
01:43:12,906 --> 01:43:15,026
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1118
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:16,626
Chaos

1119
01:43:16,706 --> 01:43:18,106
across the Imperium.

1120
01:43:18,186 --> 01:43:19,546
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1121
01:43:19,626 --> 01:43:21,986
with an alternative to chaos.

1122
01:43:22,066 --> 01:43:23,906
The Emperor has no sons.

1123
01:43:23,986 --> 01:43:25,906
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1124
01:43:25,986 --> 01:43:28,666
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1125
01:43:28,746 --> 01:43:30,426
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1126
01:43:30,506 --> 01:43:32,106
He brought you here
to kill you.

1127
01:43:32,186 --> 01:43:34,586
What don't you understand?

1128
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:37,706
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1129
01:43:41,746 --> 01:43:44,386
The Fremen speak
of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1130
01:43:45,346 --> 01:43:47,106
Careful.

1131
01:43:47,186 --> 01:43:48,306
The Voice from the Outer World

1132
01:43:48,386 --> 01:43:50,466
who will lead them
to paradise.

1133
01:43:51,746 --> 01:43:52,906
Superstition.

1134
01:43:57,506 --> 01:43:59,186
I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1135
01:43:59,266 --> 01:44:00,506
and lost him in battle.

1136
01:44:03,586 --> 01:44:07,146
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1137
01:44:12,186 --> 01:44:13,986
I've seen your dream.

1138
01:44:17,946 --> 01:44:19,106
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1139
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:21,026
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1140
01:44:21,106 --> 01:44:22,586
with a wave of my hand.

1141
01:44:24,986 --> 01:44:27,728
Do you really think he is the Mahdi?

1142
01:44:28,736 --> 01:44:30,529
He looks young to me.

1143
01:46:13,626 --> 01:46:14,626
Sardaukar!

1144
01:46:17,626 --> 01:46:18,785
No! Duncan!

1145
01:46:18,866 --> 01:46:20,066
Paul, no!

1146
01:46:20,146 --> 01:46:21,385
- Duncan, no!
- No!

1147
01:46:22,506 --> 01:46:23,746
- No!
- Paul, no!

1148
01:46:24,906 --> 01:46:26,146
Duncan, no!

1149
01:46:26,226 --> 01:46:28,586
- He's locked the door.
- Duncan! No!

1150
01:47:15,946 --> 01:47:17,466
He's gone.

1151
01:47:17,546 --> 01:47:18,585
Duncan!

1152
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:20,186
We have to go.
We have no choice.

1153
01:47:27,466 --> 01:47:29,786
Paul, go! Paul!

1154
01:47:47,906 --> 01:47:49,506
Come on.
Come on, come on!

1155
01:48:19,586 --> 01:48:21,186
Follow the light.

1156
01:48:21,265 --> 01:48:23,386
You'll find a thopter
ready to fly.

1157
01:48:23,465 --> 01:48:25,266
That storm out there
is your best shot.

1158
01:48:25,346 --> 01:48:27,826
Above 5,000 meters,
it's mostly dust.

1159
01:48:27,906 --> 01:48:31,866
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1160
01:48:31,945 --> 01:48:33,146
Are you not coming with us?

1161
01:48:33,226 --> 01:48:34,386
It only seats two.

1162
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,106
I'll go to the next station

1163
01:48:36,186 --> 01:48:37,826
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1164
01:48:37,906 --> 01:48:39,146
How?

1165
01:48:39,866 --> 01:48:41,705
I'm Fremen.

1166
01:48:41,786 --> 01:48:43,905
The desert's my home.

1167
01:48:43,986 --> 01:48:45,026
Good luck.

1168
01:48:45,106 --> 01:48:46,266
Good luck.

1169
01:51:17,897 --> 01:51:20,679
Kynes. You have betrayed the Emperor.

1170
01:51:20,746 --> 01:51:23,066
I serve only one master.

1171
01:51:23,145 --> 01:51:26,346
His name is <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1172
01:52:09,546 --> 01:52:11,066
There are jet flares
behind us.

1173
01:52:43,505 --> 01:52:45,346
Paul. We're not high enough!

1174
01:53:16,746 --> 01:53:18,025
I must not fear.

1175
01:53:18,106 --> 01:53:19,705
Fear is the mind-killer.

1176
01:53:19,786 --> 01:53:23,385
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1177
01:53:28,745 --> 01:53:31,586
<i>See the friend.</i>

1178
01:53:35,225 --> 01:53:37,985
<i>See the friend.</i>

1179
01:53:40,585 --> 01:53:43,265
<i>The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...</i>

1180
01:53:46,345 --> 01:53:48,625
<i>but a reality to experience.</i>

1181
01:53:51,785 --> 01:53:53,946
A process
that cannot be understood

1182
01:53:54,025 --> 01:53:56,185
by stopping it.

1183
01:53:56,266 --> 01:53:58,586
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1184
01:53:59,505 --> 01:54:01,906
<i>We must join it.</i>

1185
01:54:01,985 --> 01:54:03,705
<i>We must flow with it.</i>

1186
01:54:03,786 --> 01:54:05,345
<i>Let go.</i>

1187
01:54:05,426 --> 01:54:07,346
<i>Let go.</i>

1188
01:54:39,736 --> 01:54:42,179
His healing isn't complete.

1189
01:54:52,265 --> 01:54:56,225
We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1190
01:54:57,665 --> 01:55:00,145
Winds at 800 kilometers
an hour.

1191
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:06,825
Nothing survives such a storm.

1192
01:55:06,906 --> 01:55:08,266
They're dead.

1193
01:55:09,626 --> 01:55:11,385
It's a certainty.

1194
01:55:18,105 --> 01:55:20,305
So, it's done. Finally.

1195
01:55:22,345 --> 01:55:24,105
Send word to Giedi Prime

1196
01:55:24,186 --> 01:55:26,906
to begin selling
our spice reserves.

1197
01:55:27,705 --> 01:55:29,705
But slowly.

1198
01:55:29,786 --> 01:55:32,345
We don't want
the price to fall.

1199
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:33,865
You have no idea
how much it cost me

1200
01:55:33,945 --> 01:55:36,345
to bring such a force
to bear here.

1201
01:55:36,425 --> 01:55:39,185
Now I only have
one requirement.

1202
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:40,346
Income.

1203
01:55:41,145 --> 01:55:42,865
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1204
01:55:43,585 --> 01:55:44,985
Squeeze hard.

1205
01:55:45,065 --> 01:55:46,386
Yes, Uncle.

1206
01:55:47,906 --> 01:55:48,986
And the Fremen?

1207
01:55:50,065 --> 01:55:51,425
Kill them all.

1208
01:56:13,546 --> 01:56:15,425
We're above
5,000 meters.

1209
01:57:49,185 --> 01:57:51,066
As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

1210
01:59:39,585 --> 01:59:41,345
And breathe through this.

1211
02:00:10,305 --> 02:00:12,505
<i>Now
we have to find the Fremen.</i>

1212
02:00:13,985 --> 02:00:15,265
<i>Are you good?</i>

1213
02:00:15,345 --> 02:00:16,665
<i>Yeah.</i>

1214
02:01:20,785 --> 02:01:22,465
<i>Paul...</i>

1215
02:01:28,745 --> 02:01:32,424
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1216
02:01:32,505 --> 02:01:35,584
<i>Even a little
desert mouse can survive.</i>

1217
02:01:36,585 --> 02:01:39,625
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1218
02:01:39,705 --> 02:01:41,465
<i>You'll need
to face your fears.</i>

1219
02:01:41,545 --> 02:01:43,065
<i>A friend...</i>

1220
02:01:43,145 --> 02:01:46,144
<i>A friend will help you.</i>

1221
02:01:47,465 --> 02:01:49,225
<i>Follow the friend.</i>

1222
02:01:51,945 --> 02:01:53,225
<i>You have much to learn.</i>

1223
02:01:55,345 --> 02:01:58,025
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1224
02:02:01,224 --> 02:02:02,745
Come with me.

1225
02:02:29,225 --> 02:02:32,825
<i>The</i> sietch
<i>where Duncan lived</i>

1226
02:02:32,904 --> 02:02:34,985
<i>is somewhere off that way.</i>

1227
02:02:37,065 --> 02:02:39,945
<i>I can see
greenery over there.</i>

1228
02:02:40,025 --> 02:02:41,144
<i>There.</i>

1229
02:02:41,225 --> 02:02:43,145
<i>That means
Fremen live there.</i>

1230
02:02:47,304 --> 02:02:49,345
<i>We'll cross after dark.</i>

1231
02:02:49,425 --> 02:02:51,345
<i>That's how the Fremen do it.</i>

1232
02:02:54,185 --> 02:02:56,585
<i>We're about to enter
worm territory.</i>

1233
02:02:56,665 --> 02:02:58,424
<i>We can't walk
like regular humans.</i>

1234
02:02:58,505 --> 02:02:59,865
<i>If we do, we're dead.</i>

1235
02:02:59,945 --> 02:03:01,865
<i>We'll have to walk
like the Fremen do.</i>

1236
02:03:01,945 --> 02:03:03,425
<i>It's called a sandwalk.</i>

1237
02:03:03,504 --> 02:03:06,065
<i>At least according
to the filmbooks back home.</i>

1238
02:03:06,145 --> 02:03:07,505
<i>Yeah. Yeah, okay.</i>

1239
02:03:07,585 --> 02:03:09,065
<i>Okay. Follow me.</i>

1240
02:03:09,145 --> 02:03:10,825
<i>Do the same moves.</i>

1241
02:03:23,465 --> 02:03:25,024
<i>I think this is
the right direction.</i>

1242
02:04:44,225 --> 02:04:45,264
<i>It's close by.</i>

1243
02:04:46,105 --> 02:04:47,945
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

1244
02:04:48,745 --> 02:04:51,505
<i>Wait.</i>

1245
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:53,385
<i>It's drum sand.</i>

1246
02:04:57,825 --> 02:04:59,705
<i>run.</i>

1247
02:05:05,385 --> 02:05:07,025
<i>Go! Go!</i>

1248
02:06:16,184 --> 02:06:17,265
<i>It's a thumper.</i>

1249
02:06:22,344 --> 02:06:24,264
<i>Someone set off a thumper.</i>

1250
02:06:38,225 --> 02:06:40,385
<i>Paul! Run!</i>

1251
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:55,745
How big are they?

1252
02:06:55,824 --> 02:06:56,985
That was insane.

1253
02:07:01,505 --> 02:07:02,984
Someone called it.

1254
02:07:12,532 --> 02:07:14,703
We are not alone.

1255
02:07:33,625 --> 02:07:36,065
<i>Do not run.</i>

1256
02:07:36,144 --> 02:07:38,665
<i>You will only waste
your body's water.</i>

1257
02:07:39,625 --> 02:07:40,625
<i>Hold.</i>

1258
02:07:47,985 --> 02:07:48,825
Stilgar.

1259
02:07:48,904 --> 02:07:50,424
Hey!

1260
02:07:50,505 --> 02:07:51,705
You know me. I was there

1261
02:07:51,784 --> 02:07:53,464
when you came
to my father's Council.

1262
02:07:53,544 --> 02:07:54,465
Oh.

1263
02:07:54,544 --> 02:07:56,505
This is the Duke's son.

1264
02:07:56,584 --> 02:07:58,145
Why are you waiting?

1265
02:07:58,224 --> 02:08:00,024
We need their water.

1266
02:08:00,105 --> 02:08:02,265
This is the boy
I told you about.

1267
02:08:02,344 --> 02:08:03,545
We can't touch him.

1268
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:06,460
How can he be the Lisan al-Gaib?

1269
02:08:06,706 --> 02:08:09,064
- He hasn't proven himself.
- They are weaklings.

1270
02:08:09,145 --> 02:08:10,824
Jamis.

1271
02:08:10,905 --> 02:08:12,705
That was a brave crossing
they made

1272
02:08:12,784 --> 02:08:15,544
in the path of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1273
02:08:15,624 --> 02:08:18,625
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1274
02:08:19,624 --> 02:08:21,264
Nor did his father.

1275
02:08:21,345 --> 02:08:23,864
My thumper
saved his life.

1276
02:08:23,945 --> 02:08:26,305
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1277
02:08:26,384 --> 02:08:28,024
He's not The One.

1278
02:08:30,665 --> 02:08:32,264
We have powerful friends.

1279
02:08:32,345 --> 02:08:35,384
You help us off-world,
to Caladan,

1280
02:08:35,465 --> 02:08:36,664
you will be well rewarded.

1281
02:08:36,744 --> 02:08:39,425
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1282
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:40,985
in your flesh?

1283
02:08:43,664 --> 02:08:45,625
Hmm...

1284
02:08:45,704 --> 02:08:47,265
The boy is young.

1285
02:08:47,344 --> 02:08:49,465
He can learn our ways.

1286
02:08:49,544 --> 02:08:52,065
He may have sanctuary.

1287
02:08:52,144 --> 02:08:54,385
But the woman is untrained...

1288
02:08:56,944 --> 02:08:58,385
and too old to learn.

1289
02:09:28,464 --> 02:09:30,504
back, you dogs.

1290
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:34,185
She'll cut my throat.

1291
02:09:38,944 --> 02:09:41,344
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1292
02:09:41,425 --> 02:09:43,024
And a fighter?

1293
02:09:43,105 --> 02:09:45,184
Conversation ran short.

1294
02:09:45,265 --> 02:09:47,384
Peace, woman.

1295
02:09:47,465 --> 02:09:48,744
Peace.

1296
02:09:49,504 --> 02:09:50,984
I judged hastily.

1297
02:09:59,618 --> 02:10:01,272
The sun is rising.

1298
02:10:02,085 --> 02:10:03,946
We must reach Sietch Tabr.

1299
02:10:05,686 --> 02:10:07,824
The fates of these strangers
will be decided there.

1300
02:10:13,341 --> 02:10:14,941
Until then...

1301
02:10:15,266 --> 02:10:17,377
they have my countenance.

1302
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:21,034
My word is on them.

1303
02:10:28,584 --> 02:10:30,904
<i>I would not
have let you hurt my friends.</i>

1304
02:10:55,144 --> 02:10:57,624
They say you're the <i>Mahdi.</i>

1305
02:10:57,705 --> 02:10:59,465
But you look
like a little boy.

1306
02:11:00,904 --> 02:11:02,304
You chose the hardest way up.

1307
02:11:02,385 --> 02:11:03,664
Follow me.

1308
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:08,732
We must go!

1309
02:11:10,824 --> 02:11:12,344
Give it to me.

1310
02:11:18,984 --> 02:11:20,625
You will have
your own maula pistol

1311
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:22,545
when you've earned it.

1312
02:11:22,624 --> 02:11:23,625
Give it to me.

1313
02:11:29,144 --> 02:11:31,185
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1314
02:11:31,264 --> 02:11:33,785
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1315
02:11:33,864 --> 02:11:35,224
I will not have them.

1316
02:11:41,865 --> 02:11:43,225
Jamis,

1317
02:11:43,304 --> 02:11:45,544
I have spoken. Be still.

1318
02:11:45,624 --> 02:11:47,144
You talk like a leader.

1319
02:11:48,104 --> 02:11:49,904
But the strongest leads.

1320
02:11:51,144 --> 02:11:52,864
She bested you.

1321
02:11:54,225 --> 02:11:56,424
I invoke the amtal.

1322
02:11:56,504 --> 02:11:58,824
You may not challenge
a <i>Sayyadina.</i>

1323
02:11:58,904 --> 02:12:00,344
Then who will fight
in her name?

1324
02:12:00,424 --> 02:12:03,064
Jamis, don't do this.

1325
02:12:03,144 --> 02:12:05,144
Don't. The night is fading.

1326
02:12:05,224 --> 02:12:08,024
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1327
02:12:08,104 --> 02:12:10,064
Where is her champion?

1328
02:12:20,464 --> 02:12:22,384
I accept her champion.

1329
02:12:53,224 --> 02:12:56,984
<i>Paul Atreides
must die...</i>

1330
02:12:58,665 --> 02:13:03,185
<i>for</i> Kwisatz Haderach <i>to rise.</i>

1331
02:13:05,744 --> 02:13:09,304
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1332
02:13:09,384 --> 02:13:10,904
<i>Don't resist.</i>

1333
02:13:16,704 --> 02:13:18,584
<i>When you take a life,</i>

1334
02:13:19,464 --> 02:13:21,504
<i>you take your own.</i>

1335
02:13:51,984 --> 02:13:54,345
I don't believe
you're the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1336
02:13:55,784 --> 02:13:57,744
But I want you
to die with honor.

1337
02:14:08,745 --> 02:14:11,464
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1338
02:14:14,584 --> 02:14:16,864
It's made
from a tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1339
02:14:16,944 --> 02:14:18,584
The great sandworm.

1340
02:14:20,145 --> 02:14:22,824
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1341
02:14:26,944 --> 02:14:29,224
Where is the Outworlder?

1342
02:14:33,384 --> 02:14:35,225
Jamis is a good fighter.

1343
02:14:36,144 --> 02:14:37,744
He won't let you suffer.

1344
02:14:39,144 --> 02:14:40,705
Chani...

1345
02:14:43,704 --> 02:14:44,704
Um...

1346
02:14:52,424 --> 02:14:53,584
Never mind.

1347
02:15:46,664 --> 02:15:48,744
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

1348
02:15:56,224 --> 02:15:58,104
You should welcome my blade.

1349
02:16:01,464 --> 02:16:03,144
This world will kill you.

1350
02:16:06,384 --> 02:16:07,864
Quicker this way.

1351
02:16:45,864 --> 02:16:47,424
Do you yield?

1352
02:16:49,584 --> 02:16:51,384
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1353
02:16:52,744 --> 02:16:54,264
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1354
02:16:54,344 --> 02:16:55,944
Only death is the test of it.

1355
02:17:04,024 --> 02:17:05,864
- Is he toying with him?
- No.

1356
02:17:07,144 --> 02:17:08,744
Paul has never killed a man.

1357
02:17:19,064 --> 02:17:23,304
Kwisatz Haderach.

1358
02:17:26,224 --> 02:17:29,144
Kwisatz Haderach.

1359
02:17:29,224 --> 02:17:32,944
<i>Climb up. Rise.</i>

1360
02:19:20,744 --> 02:19:22,584
You're one of us now.

1361
02:19:22,664 --> 02:19:24,424
A life for a life.

1362
02:19:24,504 --> 02:19:26,464
Come with us to <i>Sietch</i> Tabr.

1363
02:19:26,544 --> 02:19:27,544
No.

1364
02:19:27,623 --> 02:19:29,104
Paul needs to get off-world.

1365
02:19:29,184 --> 02:19:31,184
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

1366
02:19:31,264 --> 02:19:32,464
you have ships.

1367
02:19:32,544 --> 02:19:34,584
- No.
- You have...

1368
02:19:34,664 --> 02:19:36,664
The Emperor sent us
to this place.

1369
02:19:38,024 --> 02:19:39,703
And my father came,

1370
02:19:40,584 --> 02:19:42,784
not for spice,

1371
02:19:42,863 --> 02:19:45,064
not for the riches,

1372
02:19:45,144 --> 02:19:47,184
but for the strength
of your people.

1373
02:19:50,064 --> 02:19:52,064
My road leads into the desert.

1374
02:19:54,624 --> 02:19:55,944
I can see it.

1375
02:19:58,343 --> 02:19:59,904
If you'll have us,

1376
02:20:00,784 --> 02:20:02,304
we will come.

1377
02:20:48,944 --> 02:20:50,384
Desert power.

1378
02:20:51,624 --> 02:20:53,264
This is only the beginning.
