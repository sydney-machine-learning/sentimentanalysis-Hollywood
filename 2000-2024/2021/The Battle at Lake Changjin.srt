1
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:27,200
Huzhou, Zhejiang

2
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,742
Who's in your jar?

3
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:36,534
Bach Ly.

4
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:59,450
Wu Wanli, you bastard!

5
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:01,675
I will tell your father to give you a whip!

6
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:02,284
Liu Shaozi.

7
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:02,784
Liu Shaozi.

8
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,534
This is to hit me with my dad!

9
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:17,784
Ngo Van Ly,

10
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,409
come here.

11
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,034
Do you have a gun?

12
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:28,734
I'm scared.

13
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,609
I'm pretty strong.

14
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,159
Does it ring any bells?

15
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,242
Let go of me!

16
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,725
Puppy, who are you?

17
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:48,700
Natural justice.

18
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,784
No!

19
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:55,617
Mommy!

20
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:58,575
No!

21
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:01,325
Mommy!

22
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,117
No!

23
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,950
Mommy...

24
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:10,409
Natural justice...

25
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,709
Thien Ly is back!

26
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,034
No,

27
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,617
Mommy.

28
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:40,959
Bach Ly... passed away.

29
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:50,284
Bach Ly.

30
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:52,525
Eat it.

31
00:05:56,618 --> 00:06:00,150
Thien Ly, I also eat.

32
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:05,742
What are you doing?

33
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:06,575
Mommy.

34
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:08,575
In the army?

35
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,075
I am the Captain.

36
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:11,900
How many people do you command?

37
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:13,367
About 150.

38
00:06:14,118 --> 00:06:15,975
You are a big man!

39
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,850
Yes, big deal.

40
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:25,409
I heard Tran Thien in the river say

41
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:29,417
the government grants us 0.39 acres of land.

42
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:31,492
In 1947...

43
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:33,409
when we fought in Mong Ngan district,

44
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,992
I see a house with a front yard and a back yard there

45
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,500
with flat gable roof and purlin.

46
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:41,992
The porch can hold 5 swallows' nests.

47
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,909
Our family has been floating on the river for many generations.

48
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,034
When I built a house there,

49
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,742
the villagers will surely see me in a new light.

50
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:56,759
Mom, this is my allowance.

51
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:03,309
If we start building on February 2 next year, 
we can finish it by early winter.

52
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:08,742
When you come back next time, I can find

53
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:10,800
good wife for Wanli.

54
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:12,075
Are you going again?

55
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:15,242
Are you still going to war?

56
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,200
Mom, the war is over.

57
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:18,992
No more battles.

58
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:20,367
No more battles.

59
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,575
Show me your gun.

60
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:37,492
Let us see it.

61
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,550
Don't point the gun at anyone.

62
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:54,617
I told you not to point the gun at anyone!

63
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:57,075
Orders from Army Corps Command!

64
00:07:57,993 --> 00:07:59,992
Orders from Army Corps Command!

65
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,534
All attention!

66
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,159
Who is Ngo Thien Ly?

67
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:04,117
Right!

68
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:05,492
Urgent!

69
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,534
His leave is cancelled.

70
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,042
- To the mission tomorrow morning. 
- Hear!

71
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,742
Natural justice.

72
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:20,825
Natural justice.

73
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:29,325
I'll be back in early spring. 
- OK.

74
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,734
I will build a house when I come back.

75
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:46,534
I want to fight with you.

76
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,375
Baili said that he and I had fought enough for our family.

77
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,392
I don't need to join the army anymore.

78
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:05,850
Puppy, wait until I get home.

79
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,284
Go back now.

80
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,992
15/ 9/ 1950

81
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,450
Incheon, South Korea

82
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,034
As of July 7, this year,

83
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:57,750
General MacArthur, commander of the Marines, 
declared war on North Korea.

84
00:09:57,993 --> 00:10:00,200
With sweeping speed, the US Air Force...

85
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,700
carpet bombing the entire terrain of the enemy.

86
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:06,117
Victory is estimated in the span of several weeks.

87
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:07,825
This is AFNK.

88
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,800
Bringing the latest news from the front.

89
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,409
We are near the factory area southwest of Yalu River.

90
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,867
In position, target locked,

91
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:11,992
ready to drop.

92
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:15,950
Continue the mission.

93
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:17,450
Clear.

94
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,034
Base control, this is Team Sword.

95
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:30,117
We're on the bombardment zone,

96
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,659
cross the Chinese border.

97
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:35,034
Objectives are clear, require action confirmation.

98
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:35,659
Over.

99
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:37,659
Sword Team.

100
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,825
Article 8 pieces to second place.

101
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:41,742
My job is to block their supply lines

102
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,034
by all necessary means.

103
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:43,825
Over.

104
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,034
Team Sword, clear.

105
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,617
An Dong China Border

106
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:58,575
Enemy plane!

107
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,325
Enemy plane!

108
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,659
Wolmido Islands, Incheon

109
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,450
Choose good photos for the press.

110
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:04,325
Is this part 
of MacArthur's next presidential campaign?

111
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,642
Do you think he will become president after this war?

112
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:10,150
He tried twice.

113
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:14,822
Oliver P. Smith (Commander of the 1st Marines.)

114
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,034
Not an opportunity.

115
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:20,687
U.S. Army 7th Infantry Division. 
31st Infantry Regiment. (Polar bears).

116
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:25,075
Look, the bear vomited.

117
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:27,617
How did you get on the train home?

118
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,284
If you want to be honorable, be discreet.

119
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,200
Don't embarrass the regiment.

120
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,992
You remember what our regiment did in Siberia, World War I?

121
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:40,434
And when we stopped the Japanese in the Philippines during World War 2?

122
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:42,750
My legacy, friend!

123
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:44,284
Don't worry, guys,

124
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,650
this place is not Normandy.

125
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,242
This is just a walk.

126
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,659
Sheriff 1 Marines hovering around reporters

127
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:56,050
and I'll show them what the real battle is.

128
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:16,743
Douglas MacArthur (General)

129
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:15,367
I will take back Seoul

130
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,742
and set up Korea!

131
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,075
And I assure you,

132
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,367
This is going to be a quick fight.

133
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:28,075
God bless, it will end on Thanksgiving.

134
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,950
General, establish the whole of Korea

135
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:34,034
does that mean American troops will cross the 38th Parallel?

136
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,117
If this is for the best for Korea and the world,

137
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:41,159
God will guide us!

138
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,950
Are you confident about this operation, General?

139
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:46,492
Do you underestimate Kim Il Sung?

140
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:49,159
He had Stalin and Mao backing him.

141
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:52,117
I never underestimate my enemies.

142
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:55,550
I have my track record.

143
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:58,325
Master 1 of the Outstanding Marine

144
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:01,450
and the most damned generals and soldiers

145
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:04,409
on the green earth of God.

146
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:07,575
I believe we will succeed.

147
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:19,977
Peng Dehuai 
Deputy Commander of the People's Liberation Army of China. 
Commander of the Northwest Military Region.

148
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:24,575
I think we'll wrap this up well before Thanksgiving.

149
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:28,450
General, you can read my mind.

150
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:34,151
Edward M. Almond 
(Commander of X Corps)

151
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:43,784
Beijing October 4, 1950

152
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:46,200
September 15 to 19,

153
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:49,775
More than 70,000 well-equipped American troops landed in Incheon.

154
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:52,450
Until September 28, Korean People's Army

155
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,992
retreat north of the 38th parallel.

156
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,492
The more serious problem is,

157
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,200
MacArthur visited Taiwan on July 31.

158
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,367
According to our report, the US 13th Air Force

159
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,950
will come and station in Taiwan.

160
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,200
This is America's biggest move

161
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,242
since the 7th Fleet began to lock down Taiwan

162
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,284
on June 26 this year.

163
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:11,617
This is a complete violation

164
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:13,992
statement of the US government

165
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,909
January 5 of this year.

166
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:20,200
On the 3rd of October, that is, yesterday,

167
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:22,325
1st Cavalry and 24

168
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:25,742
of the US Ground Forces are fully equipped

169
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:28,450
and ready to cross the 38th parallel at any time.

170
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,259
This completely crosses our lines.

171
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,617
Did you all hear?

172
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,409
If they cross the 38th Parallel,

173
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:41,217
Will they also cross the Yalu River?

174
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,075
In fact, stationed in Taiwan,

175
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,867
American troops have invaded our territory.

176
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:56,700
They are now gathering forces on the Korean Peninsula

177
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,867
and threaten our national security.

178
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,284
5/ 10/ 1950

179
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,367
3 am

180
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,869
Mao An Anh 
Son of Mao Zedong

181
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,909
Uncle Peng.

182
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,126
An Anh,

183
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,913
... President sleep yet? 
- Not yet.

184
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:22,284
I guess you'll be here

185
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:23,742
told me to wait for you at the door.

186
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:27,117
Chrysanthemum Perfume Library

187
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,534
Come in.

188
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,700
Several warships will be deployed

189
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:36,200
Join the US 7th Fleet.

190
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:37,367
Chairperson.

191
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:43,950
Meanwhile, the US increased its military strength in Taiwan.

192
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,784
Peng, are you still awake?

193
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:53,784
What do you think about this situation?

194
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:56,909
I'd like to hear your thoughts first, Chairman.

195
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,242
This country was just established

196
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:05,359
and thousands of things waiting to be done.

197
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:08,125
If that's my current situation,

198
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:12,325
I really don't want this war.

199
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,042
But if for the future

200
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:18,450
and peaceful development

201
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:22,000
of our country in several decades or centuries,

202
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,584
We must fight this war.

203
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,700
Foreigners look down on us.

204
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,200
Proud

205
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,117
can only be obtained on the battlefield.

206
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:43,575
I agree.

207
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:47,075
I support your decision to support Trieu.

208
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,159
I'm relieved.

209
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,450
Chairman, I'm thinking,

210
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:02,092
We should also have troops on the eastern front.

211
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:04,992
It can be located at Changbin Lake

212
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,950
to fight the American army.

213
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:08,575
Uncle Peng.

214
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:11,825
Uncle Peng.

215
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:12,659
Let me guess.

216
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,409
You know what I want to say?

217
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:17,442
Let me be your soldier, Commander Peng.

218
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,159
I have two brothers.

219
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,034
One is missing and still not found

220
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:26,825
in Shanghai, right?

221
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,617
Yes, in Shanghai.

222
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,284
The other is sick.

223
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:36,034
I am the only child

224
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,659
... maybe with your father now. 
- Uncle Peng.

225
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,575
So you shouldn't go, son!

226
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,492
Hundreds of thousands of people's children

227
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:44,009
to the battlefield with a call.

228
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:45,867
Why shouldn't I go?

229
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:57,950
Peng, let it go with you.

230
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:18,700
Right now, the most important thing

231
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:20,450
that is my western flank,

232
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:23,867
I Corps with 1st Cavalry Division and 24

233
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,659
will cross 38 and take Pyongyang.

234
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:31,985
American troops bombarded the 38th parallel

235
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,242
Mom, this is the Captain of Team 7 Fortune, 359-er.

236
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:33,867
We have reached our position.

237
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,367
Start bombing Target "Cast Iron".

238
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,950
Target pass time, estimated 1'.

239
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:58,450
In the meantime, the current plan

240
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:01,075
show me to the port city of Hungnam

241
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:03,659
and headed northwest to the Yalu River.

242
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:08,767
Remember I was separate from my forces at Truong Tan Lake.

243
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:32,675
American troops advance north

244
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,200
and crossed the 38th Parallel.

245
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:36,784
The Yalu River was right in front of them.

246
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:39,534
If we ignore them,

247
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:45,575
enemies at home and abroad will think that we are weak and gullible.

248
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:47,492
We are in the same boat.

249
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,659
Korean comrades ask me for help.

250
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:51,992
So,

251
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:54,700
throw a punch now

252
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:56,617
to avoid a hundred punches in the future.

253
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:58,909
I declare

254
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:01,342
appointed Comrade Peng Duc Hoai

255
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,284
as Commander of the Chinese Volunteer Army

256
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,575
cum Political Commissar

257
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,317
command troops in this campaign abroad.

258
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:16,281
US Command - The tallest building in 
Tokyo, Japan.

259
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,367
The Eastern Front's makeshift base

260
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:47,384
Gentlemen, my tank has crossed the 38th parallel

261
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,259
and my enemies have been overwhelmed.

262
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,634
To me, it seemed like victory was destined.

263
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,184
It's time to plan our next move.

264
00:22:58,285 --> 00:23:02,159
General, the Air Force owns the airspace.

265
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,784
The 10th Army captured the port of Hungnam

266
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,784
and I am ready to proceed to the Yalu River.

267
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:11,865
Korea 
Eastern Front of Mount Nangnim

268
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,784
Boss, has the president ordered us to proceed to Yalu?

269
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:14,075
Mr. Truman did not sign the order,

270
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:16,059
suggestion only.

271
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,575
What about China?

272
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:21,235
North Korean Western Front Command 
, Pyongyang

273
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:20,284
They have deployed their soldiers

274
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:22,034
and they attacked our army.

275
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,909
How should we respond to this preemptive warning

276
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,693
Walton H.Walker 
(Commander of the 8th Army Corps)

277
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:26,284
and their actions?

278
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:30,825
General Walker, I command well-trained soldiers,

279
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,075
not farmers.

280
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,325
If we end this war,

281
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:37,384
We have to fight.

282
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:42,492
Taeyu-Dong Volunteer Command 
, North Korea

283
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:48,367
Commander, I received a call

284
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:52,417
American motorized forces continued to 
advance north at a rapid pace.

285
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:55,950
If it goes on like this,

286
00:23:56,243 --> 00:23:59,825
The enemy will soon come to my doorstep.

287
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:03,242
Commander Peng, 1st Division Marine, US Marines

288
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,325
landed at Wonsan.

289
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:05,853
Dang Hoa 
Deputy Commander of the Chinese Volunteer Army

290
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:08,200
Their chief, Major General Smith

291
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:11,492
are leading their 25,000 heavily armed soldiers

292
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:15,359
gathered from the eastern front toward Truong Tan Lake.

293
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,850
They want to form a pincer attack

294
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:19,925
with their forces on the western front

295
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:23,517
to completely occupy Korea.

296
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:26,825
Report to the President immediately.

297
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:30,659
I intend to concentrate our troops on the western front first.

298
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:32,817
against the American army.

299
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,034
At the same time, request the Central Military Commission

300
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:37,909
send strategic troops to Korea now

301
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:42,409
and intercepted the enemy at Truong Tan Lake on the eastern front.

302
00:24:43,118 --> 00:24:43,867
It's correct.

303
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:46,700
Send telegram to Commander Peng

304
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:49,784
explained as Kanggye and Changbin Lake

305
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:52,200
should be taken care of by

306
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,117
Song Shilun's 9th Army Corps.

307
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:59,943
3rd Field Army, 9th Army Corps of 
the Chinese Volunteer Army

308
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:57,700
Their mission is to lure the enemy

309
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:00,634
and take the opportunity to destroy them.

310
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,034
How many Model 38 rifles do we have?

311
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,117
16.

312
00:25:07,243 --> 00:25:08,034
What about Sten 99?

313
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:09,409
I have enough.

314
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:11,300
Take it all away.

315
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,284
Company captain, Vu Thung Dung fights with brothers.

316
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:16,659
- With whom? 
- Soldiers of the Artillery Battalion.

317
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,784
Sit still.

318
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:20,200
Speak loudly!

319
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:21,867
I can not hear anything.

320
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,534
He just couldn't.

321
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:24,409
Go down.

322
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:25,742
Vu Thung Dung!

323
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,950
Duong, what's going on?

324
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:32,467
- Battalion commander Duong said... 
- Quiet!

325
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:33,934
Comrade Battalion Captain.

326
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,909
Battalion commander Duong said the battle of Thanh Guan town

327
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,534
causing too many casualties for the 7th Company.

328
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:38,742
No big deal when we win.

329
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,159
If it weren't for the Artillery Battalion,

330
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:41,784
We can't even fight.

331
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:44,450
They should be credited for the victory.

332
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:47,200
Battalion Commander Duong, 7th Company we protect

333
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:49,325
8 out of 11 guns for your Artillery Battalion.

334
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:51,575
We backed you up, didn't we?

335
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:53,409
What is he really doing?

336
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,034
What a great honor to end a battle with so many casualties!

337
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:57,750
- What did you say? 
- Ngo Thien Ly!

338
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,575
What are you doing?

339
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:00,450
Strictly!

340
00:26:01,368 --> 00:26:04,992
Chief, we're planning 
to have a party with the Artillery Battalion.

341
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,950
No kidding, the Commander is here.

342
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:11,242
Strictly!

343
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:16,700
Commander, I'm Ngo Thien Ly,

344
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,534
Captain of the 7th Company.

345
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,992
I have heard about you.

346
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,450
Hero of my 9th Army.

347
00:26:23,076 --> 00:26:25,159
Your 7th Company is quite famous.

348
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,509
Everyone called him 7th Master Attack Company.

349
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:28,617
Party Committee of the Army Corps

350
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:30,742
should have given you the flag,

351
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:34,117
but now have to wait until the war is over.

352
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:35,200
Clear!

353
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:36,534
Strictly hello!

354
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,785
Song Shilun, Commander and Political Commissar of 
the 9th Army Corps of the Chinese Volunteers

355
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:42,950
Rest!

356
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:45,575
Comrades,

357
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,175
I met a boy

358
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:50,367
here today.

359
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:53,034
He insists that he is your Master

360
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,159
allow him to join the army.

361
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,867
The master asked him,

362
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,992
"Why do you want to join the army?"

363
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:02,242
he said,

364
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,159
My father said

365
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:07,192
Communist Party

366
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,367
and Chairman Mao

367
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:10,825
give land to our family.

368
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:13,367
But someone is here

369
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,200
to take their land.

370
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,700
Ta không thể để chuyện đó xảy ra.

371
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:20,617
That's left over.

372
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:24,284
I just liberated the whole country.

373
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:27,159
Before we have time to rest,

374
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,159
American empire

375
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:32,909
start a war with Korea

376
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:35,784
on our northern border.

377
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:37,950
They intend to breathe the breath of war

378
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:40,867
into our young China.

379
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,450
What should I do?

380
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:45,617
To hit!

381
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:48,034
Standard!

382
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,617
Chairman Mao Commander Chu

383
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:53,492
order my 9th Army

384
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,534
go north,

385
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:56,742
resistance against the US, North Korea's aid,

386
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:58,492
protect our country!

387
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:00,284
Anti-American Academy of Korea!

388
00:28:00,493 --> 00:28:01,992
Defend our Motherland!

389
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:03,325
Anti-American Academy of Korea!

390
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:04,742
Defend our Motherland!

391
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:07,825
Go Go go!

392
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,675
Our troops move towards the sun.

393
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:15,334
Standing on mother earth,

394
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:18,992
I am the hope everyone expects.

395
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:22,617
No one can shoot me down.

396
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,534
Ngo Thien Ly!

397
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,409
Yes!

398
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:30,009
- Bring the 7th company back. 
- Yes!

399
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,900
He's the boy the Commander just mentioned.

400
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:39,034
He said he was Ngo Thien Ly's younger brother.

401
00:28:39,993 --> 00:28:41,950
I will give it to you.

402
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:43,059
Clear!

403
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,742
Go there!

404
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:47,659
How did I find this place?

405
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,450
I follow you secretly.

406
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:51,950
How do I meet the Master?

407
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,784
He must be a big man if he's in a car.

408
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:56,450
Did you stop the Master's car?

409
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:57,950
I want to join the army.

410
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:59,075
Do parents know?

411
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:00,700
Is not.

412
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,825
Get out of here!

413
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:24,867
The companies are in position!

414
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,450
Get military equipment!

415
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:32,950
1, 2, 3, 4!

416
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:39,200
Stuck in place!

417
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:45,367
141 soldiers must report to Company 3.

418
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,825
130 soldiers were present to receive the mission.

419
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,367
The rest are on their way.

420
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,242
258 soldiers had to report to the Artillery Battalion.

421
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,867
221 soldiers were present to receive the mission.

422
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,117
157 soldiers must present

423
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:54,534
Commander Company 7.

424
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:55,575
Command!

425
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:58,950
My Thang Company 7 was present.

426
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:00,492
157 soldiers must present

427
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:01,950
Commander Company 7.

428
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:04,342
157 soldiers were present to receive the mission.

429
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,909
Lined up!

430
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:06,992
Clear!

431
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:12,034
company captain,

432
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:14,484
I pee.

433
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:16,925
Excuse me before you speak.

434
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:18,784
If you glean, pee here.

435
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,784
Natural justice.

436
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:28,867
company captain,

437
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,992
I'm here right now!

438
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,617
Do not touch me.

439
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:32,575
Go away.

440
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:35,700
He was discharged from the army. Why did you come back?

441
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,925
Some people feel insecure without me.

442
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:39,867
What do you mean me?

443
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,575
I read the newspaper as soon as I get home.

444
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:44,992
Fortunately,

445
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,167
I haven't finished the discharge procedure yet.

446
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:48,992
I cycled for 12 hours

447
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:50,409
to come back here.

448
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:52,367
You should give me a massage when we get on the train.

449
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,075
YES.

450
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:57,242
What are you doing?

451
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:00,242
Wait!

452
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:02,125
Someone hold him!

453
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:04,867
Command!

454
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:07,825
Units on board!

455
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,825
Units on board!

456
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:10,759
Clear!

457
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,284
Go on the boat!

458
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:27,867
Wu Wanli, come down here!

459
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:37,225
This way!

460
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:41,284
Fast!

461
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,075
Over there.

462
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:46,367
Squad leader.

463
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:47,284
Hurry up.

464
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:49,842
Over there.

465
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,617
Any.

466
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,434
- Is everyone enough? 
- Yes!

467
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:44,325
The 9th Army Corps will advance to the Sino-Korean Border

468
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:47,175
after training and receiving equipment in Shandong.

469
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,025
That new soldier will join the Artillery Platoon.

470
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:53,584
Make a list and sign him up later.

471
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:55,592
We have no shortage of soldiers.

472
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,234
His name is Ngo Van Ly.

473
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,159
Please accept him.

474
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:06,784
We're about to go to war.

475
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:07,909
What do I have to teach it?

476
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:11,084
Teach it excess you taught me.

477
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,575
Teach him to survive.

478
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:23,467
I stayed with Platoon Captain Lei.

479
00:33:35,076 --> 00:33:36,575
What do you look at?

480
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,325
Why?

481
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:40,575
Are you ashamed?

482
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,950
Why do you want to join the army?

483
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:44,950
So that my brother will respect me.

484
00:33:45,285 --> 00:33:46,450
What did you say?

485
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,617
You're just tough enough

486
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,950
when your enemies take you seriously.

487
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:54,825
When will I receive the gun?

488
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:56,950
You want a gun?

489
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,909
Get one for yourself outside the school.

490
00:33:58,951 --> 00:33:59,617
Isn't that so?

491
00:33:59,743 --> 00:34:00,950
YES.

492
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:04,575
Leisurely.

493
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:06,850
Binh Hoa, take this.

494
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:15,659
Your daughter?

495
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:16,909
Up 8.

496
00:34:19,118 --> 00:34:21,617
4 + 4 = 7 with her.

497
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,984
Why are you carrying your medals?

498
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:32,400
- Are you afraid of losing them? 
- If I leave these in Shanghai,

499
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,784
My family will miss me very much.

500
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,950
My wife cycled more than 100 miles to see me off.

501
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:41,242
She cried all the way.

502
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:42,659
She asked when I'll be back.

503
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:46,767
My parents didn't ask me to stay at all.

504
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,900
I promised them to come back in the spring

505
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:52,375
to build houses for them.

506
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:01,284
He's too serious. Stop teasing him.

507
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,909
Come on, little mouse.

508
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,492
Let me introduce everyone to you.

509
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:08,450
My name is Vu Thung Dung,

510
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:10,809
Platoon leader of 1st Platoon Company 7.

511
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:14,909
Enemies usually go before being attacked.

512
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,159
When I attack, the enemy is ahead,

513
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:19,284
behind, and around me.

514
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,534
What?

515
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:27,325
Don't take weapons.

516
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:31,109
He had to regain the respect he had lost by himself.

517
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:33,492
The person I will introduce next is

518
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:34,875
Artillery Platoon Commander.

519
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,867
I am Lei.

520
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,242
Baili and Thien Ly

521
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:38,742
were all taught by him.

522
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:42,159
Remember,

523
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:44,284
in 7th Company, he was the father.

524
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:45,284
He is Lei's father.

525
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:48,450
Call him Dad Loi.

526
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:54,700
I will fight again.

527
00:35:55,368 --> 00:35:56,659
what are you thinking?

528
00:35:58,451 --> 00:35:59,325
And you?

529
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,017
The fear of the battlefield is recurring

530
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,950
what is written in the book

531
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:11,017
the fear he felt as a rookie.

532
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,409
It just feels redundant.

533
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:28,309
- Stop fighting if you can't win. 
- Let me go!

534
00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:29,992
I will kill him!

535
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:32,325
The person behind you is our sniper, Binh Hoa.

536
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:35,617
Strictly!

537
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:40,284
Come back here!

538
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,909
Where are you?

539
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,200
Commander Company 7!

540
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:47,742
7th Company is not spared like this.

541
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:50,067
Did I take the wrong car?

542
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,909
I asked Vu Thung Dung to test his personality.

543
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:53,867
Natural justice.

544
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:55,659
They bullied me.

545
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:56,742
Bullying me?

546
00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:57,742
Then keep fighting!

547
00:36:57,785 --> 00:36:58,992
They outnumber me.

548
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,534
Every enemy the 7th Company encounters

549
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:03,559
several times more than me.

550
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:05,684
You can go tell the enemy

551
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:08,334
are they outnumbered me?

552
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:25,409
Now, we will have the admission ceremony for Comrade Ngo Van Ly.

553
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,717
Strictly hello!

554
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:36,367
Rest!

555
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:37,785
- Vu Thung Dung. 
- Yes!

556
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:39,325
He is a seasoned teammate.

557
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:40,367
Tell Ngo Van Ly

558
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,334
Captain Ngo Bach Ly has passed away.

559
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,225
Clear.

560
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:50,575
Company captain Ngo Bach Ly actively attacked the enemy

561
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:52,884
with a small group of soldiers in Hoai Hai.

562
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:56,492
After destroying the enemy bunkers, he died

563
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,242
while holding his comrades in his arms.

564
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:02,950
What did 7th Company do after his death?

565
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:04,575
7 Main Company

566
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,034
destroy and capture

567
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,492
The enemy army is 6 times larger.

568
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:10,242
The enemy bunkers were

569
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:11,950
holding back our troops for more than five years

570
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:14,117
was defeated by 7th Company in half a day.

571
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,284
Our front line is behind the enemy's front line.

572
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,034
I can make many sacrifices, but for those sacrifices,

573
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:22,242
Army casualties were minimized.

574
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:23,950
We shouldn't brag about this.

575
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,825
The most important thing is to hold on.

576
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:28,950
I cannot be careless.

577
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:31,034
The American troops we will face

578
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:34,367
has the most advanced equipment in the world.

579
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:39,617
This battle will be extremely difficult.

580
00:38:39,993 --> 00:38:41,659
But we must decide to win.

581
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:46,617
Do you understand, Wu Wanli?

582
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:47,992
Ngo Van Ly,

583
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,492
I'm the 677th soldier now

584
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,242
of the 7th Landlord Company.

585
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:56,617
You can say, "Where do you get so many extra people?

586
00:38:57,326 --> 00:39:00,242
There are just over 100 here."

587
00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:04,367
I count every soldier

588
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:06,242
since the founding of the 7th Company,

589
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:08,392
even the dead

590
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:11,900
or discharge after injury.

591
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:13,417
And now you're one of us.

592
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:14,700
I'm the 135th soldier

593
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:16,492
of the 7th Landlord Company,

594
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,784
My Thang.

595
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,325
Soldier 221,

596
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,592
Vu Thung Dung.

597
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,867
280th soldier,

598
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:22,992
Binh Hoa.

599
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:24,700
335th soldier,

600
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:25,825
Ha Truong Quy.

601
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:27,700
572th soldier,

602
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:28,867
Lee Chich Chinh.

603
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,159
657th soldier,

604
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,075
Liu Zhiyi.

605
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:32,034
533rd soldier,

606
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:32,742
Ba Long.

607
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:34,200
565th soldier,

608
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:35,075
Tuyen Cuong.

609
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,159
Soldier 162,

610
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:37,159
Ngo Thien Ly.

611
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:39,117
Soldier 161,

612
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:40,450
Ngo Bach Ly.

613
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:42,325
17th soldier,

614
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:44,117
Lei Tuyet Sinh.

615
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,034
What about you?

616
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:47,534
Let me tell you again.

617
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:48,492
Do not need.

618
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:50,867
She will remember when the time comes.

619
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,825
I just wish she would

620
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:53,900
I don't want anything from her.

621
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,117
Ngo Van Ly,

622
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,450
I'm afraid the seasoned veterans 
won't accept me.

623
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:58,575
Let me tell you.

624
00:39:58,993 --> 00:40:00,492
I'll just know if they accept me or not

625
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:02,992
when I'm away from school.

626
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:05,825
Cracked egg shell

627
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:07,492
easy to eat.

628
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:09,992
If I could break an egg from the inside,

629
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,242
I can be an eagle.

630
00:40:18,535 --> 00:40:19,492
I announce:

631
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:22,492
because Comrade Ngo Van Ly violated discipline

632
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:23,950
and the distrust he has caused,

633
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:26,992
The original plan for the enlistment ceremony was cancelled.

634
00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:28,409
Cancel!

635
00:40:28,783 --> 00:40:30,783
I quit!

636
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,284
I never wanted you to join the army.

637
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:34,200
Okay,

638
00:40:34,243 --> 00:40:36,017
I go here!

639
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:37,700
Ngo Van Ly

640
00:40:37,743 --> 00:40:38,242
Stand still!

641
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:39,175
Don't stop me!

642
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:40,117
Do you want to die?

643
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:42,059
Don't shake anymore!

644
00:41:19,993 --> 00:41:22,209
I'll stand here and be punished

645
00:41:23,285 --> 00:41:24,725
until morning.

646
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,167
Take this.

647
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:40,000
Your brother agreed.

648
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,117
Remember, don't point the gun at yourself.

649
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,042
You will lie on my bed.

650
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,159
Let's go.

651
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:58,117
The captain told me to stand until morning.

652
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,959
It's not time yet.

653
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,084
You and your two brothers are both stubborn!

654
00:42:26,993 --> 00:42:27,659
Puppies...

655
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:30,492
Puppies...

656
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:33,242
Very good.

657
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,117
Very good.

658
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:39,367
It's time to eat!

659
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,034
Hey, what are you doing?

660
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:50,534
Bullet.

661
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:51,867
Go away!

662
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:54,059
You haven't given me ammo.

663
00:43:16,785 --> 00:43:18,159
Where's the bullet?

664
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:21,909
I'll take you when we get to North Korea.

665
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:27,617
Do not forget.

666
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,200
East Jie An Railway Station China Border

667
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:36,284
Chief Ga, where did you lose your hand?

668
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:38,700
- Cam Chau! 
- Captain!

669
00:43:39,118 --> 00:43:40,200
Stop it. Stop.

670
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,742
What do you want? Just say it.

671
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:44,450
I heard it was very cold across the river.

672
00:43:45,076 --> 00:43:46,684
Are you wearing it all?

673
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,242
Why don't you change into cotton uniforms in Shenyang?

674
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:50,367
There is not enough.

675
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,509
Otherwise, we won't have to bother you.

676
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,575
Here are all the badges and insignia

677
00:43:55,618 --> 00:43:57,075
for all officers and soldiers

678
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:58,742
of the 7th Landlord Company.

679
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,267
We collect them on order.

680
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:04,134
If you can stay two more days,

681
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,984
50,000 cotton uniforms will arrive.

682
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:06,950
Let me, let me.

683
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:22,117
The 7th Mainstream Company was ordered to deliver 20 radios to Korea

684
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,409
and wait for the command there.

685
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:25,092
We guarantee to get the job done!

686
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,450
Wu Wanli, look at this.

687
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:46,700
American plane!

688
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,200
It's an American plane!

689
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,450
A reconnaissance plane.

690
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:02,117
Go on the boat!

691
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:03,159
Thank you!

692
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:04,700
Cotton uniforms!

693
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,742
Get the cotton uniform!

694
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:07,078
Seen!

695
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,059
- Get a cotton uniform! 
- Let's go!

696
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:09,784
Fast!

697
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:10,617
Cotton uniforms!

698
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:11,742
Let's go now!

699
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:12,784
Fast!

700
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:14,842
7th Company, get on board!

701
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:16,625
Get on board now!

702
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:17,825
Hurry hurry!

703
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:18,950
Where is Ngo Van Ly?

704
00:45:18,993 --> 00:45:19,617
Ngo Van Ly!

705
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,117
Where is Ngo Van Ly?

706
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:20,742
Fast!

707
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:21,950
All present?

708
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:22,575
2nd Platoon is here!

709
00:45:22,618 --> 00:45:24,159
3rd Platoon is here!

710
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:25,659
Captain, look!

711
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:27,284
Get the cotton uniform!

712
00:45:27,326 --> 00:45:28,367
Wait!

713
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,575
Cotton uniforms!

714
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:31,617
Back!

715
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:33,700
Don't come anymore!

716
00:45:33,743 --> 00:45:34,409
That's dangerous!

717
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:35,700
Catch them!

718
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:37,450
Watch your feet!

719
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,309
Enough! Don't throw anymore.

720
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:43,617
Attention!

721
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,950
Attention!

722
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:49,284
Cotton uniforms!

723
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:50,867
Catch them!

724
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:52,992
Thank you!

725
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:54,825
Take care.

726
00:45:54,868 --> 00:45:55,742
Back!

727
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:56,617
Thank you!

728
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:07,534
Thien Ly, I saw a dead bomb.

729
00:46:10,493 --> 00:46:11,867
If there is no radio transmitter,

730
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,659
I can't contact the central government

731
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:15,325
or frontline troops.

732
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:17,075
Like if we didn't have a map,

733
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:18,742
there is no way to wage war.

734
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,117
Commander Peng, additional military radio

735
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,734
was brought on board at Cat An.

736
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:26,992
The 9th Army Corps was supposed to escort 
them to the volunteers.

737
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,800
- What about weak soldiers? 
- They will arrive at the same time.

738
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:32,117
Yalu River Bridge on China-North Korea border

739
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:46,742
Why does the train stop?

740
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:01,659
See the road ahead.

741
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,034
Stay at the spot 30'!

742
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:08,034
30' rest. It's good now.

743
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:16,200
Comrades, time is precious!

744
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:16,992
Any!

745
00:47:19,326 --> 00:47:20,159
Hurry up.

746
00:47:37,493 --> 00:47:38,325
Who is that?

747
00:47:38,618 --> 00:47:39,950
Dam Tu Vy, Battalion Commander 3rd Battalion.

748
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:41,367
He's from my Company.

749
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:42,700
He is the 160th soldier.

750
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:44,242
He enlisted at the same time as Baili.

751
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:45,159
Bach Ly?

752
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,825
YES.

753
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:49,209
He was once the agile man of our Company.

754
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:50,992
An undefeated hero.

755
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,909
Battalion commander, Chief would like to see you.

756
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:59,242
Platoon leader, are we there?

757
00:47:59,368 --> 00:48:01,492
Yeah, I just crossed the Yalu River.

758
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:04,125
What?

759
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:05,592
Bullet head.

760
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:08,950
Well that one.

761
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:11,675
I'll give them to you when we go to war.

762
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:18,809
Come on, run back with me.

763
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:31,784
They are all snipers.

764
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:33,325
Who is better, Binh Hoa or him?

765
00:48:34,076 --> 00:48:35,784
Who is better, your brother or him?

766
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:38,450
Bullshit, I have two brothers.

767
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:39,742
Two against one.

768
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:42,367
What is this?

769
00:48:43,785 --> 00:48:45,300
Can't talk to you.

770
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:47,909
I just spotted the troop train.

771
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:51,617
Wheelhouse, this is Summer 19.

772
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:54,325
We spotted a train carrying North Korean troops

773
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:55,909
stop in the valley.

774
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,575
Get inside now!

775
00:49:57,743 --> 00:49:59,950
Units board and get equipment!

776
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:02,075
Companies get their gear and get off the ship!

777
00:50:02,076 --> 00:50:04,700
Spread out and spread out in battalions!

778
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,367
Hiding and cutting through Mount Nangnim

779
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:09,284
then gather at Truong Tan Lake!

780
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:11,692
Get the radio first, the squire get off the train now!

781
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:13,742
How's your ammunition?

782
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:16,442
I still have little GP left.

783
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:19,075
Drop them on the ship, kill that target.

784
00:50:19,243 --> 00:50:21,659
Two 26s can return to the K-2.

785
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:48,417
Wanli, go get food!

786
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,575
Withdraw!

787
00:50:59,035 --> 00:51:00,242
Withdraw from the train!

788
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:01,450
Withdraw from the train!

789
00:51:01,451 --> 00:51:03,075
Stop unloading! Withdraw!

790
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:12,117
Fast! Fast!

791
00:51:13,326 --> 00:51:15,367
Dan, get some more!

792
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:19,742
Wanli, stop taking things, go!

793
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,284
Wanli!

794
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:22,159
Natural justice!

795
00:51:23,368 --> 00:51:24,900
Carrying this much, how do you guys run?

796
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,409
Drop them!

797
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:27,784
Drop them now!

798
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:30,559
You want to be a target?

799
00:51:33,368 --> 00:51:37,367
Range 185, altitude 350.

800
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:39,250
Prepare to fire.

801
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:31,700
Checking devices.

802
00:52:46,618 --> 00:52:49,450
The commissar, our radio and our operatives are fine.

803
00:52:49,451 --> 00:52:50,367
Great.

804
00:52:55,285 --> 00:52:57,534
Enemy aircraft will crush this area.

805
00:52:57,743 --> 00:53:00,284
There are few trees and no shelter nearby.

806
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,950
The most important thing is to find a place to hide first.

807
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:02,825
then continued marching into the night.

808
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,725
After crossing the river, seek refuge.

809
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:08,442
Hurry up, this is the only way we can go.

810
00:53:13,201 --> 00:53:14,200
Guard, Team 1.

811
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:15,450
The rest of them rest.

812
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:20,717
Wanli, why do you keep so many spare cards?

813
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:23,659
The platoon leader said he'd give me the warhead 
when we got to the battlefield.

814
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,575
He's kidding you.

815
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,642
This sandbox is useless.

816
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,617
Really?

817
00:53:27,993 --> 00:53:29,325
Why should I lie to you?

818
00:53:49,868 --> 00:53:51,300
Thanks!

819
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,592
It's nothing yet. You haven't seen me throw stones.

820
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,992
Did the platoon leader bully you?

821
00:53:58,118 --> 00:54:00,659
When I first joined the Company, he bullied me a lot.

822
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,450
Let me tell you,

823
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:03,842
His right ear is deaf from the explosion.

824
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:04,950
I always curse him in that ear.

825
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:06,825
You try.

826
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,700
Liar,

827
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:19,075
I hope he gets burned to death by a cigarette.

828
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:23,825
Bastard!

829
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:24,575
Platoon captain.

830
00:54:24,743 --> 00:54:26,517
The captain is looking for you.

831
00:54:26,535 --> 00:54:27,925
Wait for me here.

832
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:32,784
Sorry.

833
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,325
My error.

834
00:54:34,868 --> 00:54:35,700
It's the left ear.

835
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:43,742
Do not be angry anymore.

836
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:49,784
What are you doing, thanks.

837
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,000
Of course.

838
00:55:25,118 --> 00:55:27,634
Each platoon will proceed in a 466th battle formation.

839
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:31,342
Protect radios and ciphers between 2nd and 3rd platoons.

840
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:09,909
Strike!

841
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:11,409
Which direction?

842
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:17,242
Right in front of us.

843
00:56:17,576 --> 00:56:19,118
I don't have time! Hide!

844
00:56:19,118 --> 00:56:20,142
Lay!

845
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,809
Don't move

846
00:56:51,243 --> 00:56:52,800
no I'm dead!

847
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:30,575
They come back.

848
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,367
Do they notice us?

849
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,492
500m.

850
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:38,659
350m.

851
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:42,151
200m.

852
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,859
I can't shoot!

853
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,492
With an altitude of 30m and the north wind,

854
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:50,000
I can hit it. 
- I believe you.

855
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,059
But the other will call for more fighters.

856
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:00,625
Damn Dutchman, call him.

857
00:58:00,826 --> 00:58:03,225
I don't see anything moving down there.

858
00:58:03,451 --> 00:58:06,534
I started worrying about my cannon freezing.

859
00:58:06,535 --> 00:58:06,992
This,

860
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,200
Did you see those bodies?

861
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,700
How about shooting?

862
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:14,200
10 dollars I feel better!

863
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:15,200
OK!

864
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:25,034
They fly sideways.

865
00:58:55,618 --> 00:58:57,034
You owe me 10, Holland!

866
00:58:57,035 --> 00:58:57,700
Damn it!

867
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,542
Half dyke, make it 50!

868
00:59:33,326 --> 00:59:34,617
How far have I gone?

869
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:36,200
I can't die here!

870
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:39,742
Come on, kill those bastards!

871
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:43,617
This man will kill you.

872
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:44,492
Any!

873
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:46,910
1st and 2nd Platoon, the one on the right. 
3rd and 4th platoon, the one on the left.

874
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,700
Follow my orders!

875
00:59:47,701 --> 00:59:49,409
Escort the radio and the mercenaries ahead!

876
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:50,034
Clear!

877
01:00:26,618 --> 01:00:29,492
Groundhog 2, Groundhog 4, this is the Groundhog commander.

878
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:30,659
Follow me.

879
01:00:30,868 --> 01:00:35,950
Reconnaissance of the 7th Marines reported 
troop density south of the 25th-north parallel.

880
01:00:36,451 --> 01:00:37,450
Clear.

881
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,325
This live beer!

882
01:00:40,576 --> 01:00:41,700
Meat them!

883
01:00:41,743 --> 01:00:42,575
I understand!

884
01:01:26,576 --> 01:01:28,434
How's the radio and the squire?

885
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,850
8 is broken and 12 is still usable.

886
01:01:30,868 --> 01:01:33,350
Fortunately, the weak soldiers were all unharmed.

887
01:01:53,993 --> 01:01:56,217
Soldiers never leave guns on the ground.

888
01:02:04,535 --> 01:02:05,934
What is this?

889
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:08,184
I can't talk to you.

890
01:02:12,326 --> 01:02:16,242
Thien Ly, Truong Tieu Son is dead.

891
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,050
I will experience these residuals

892
01:02:30,618 --> 01:02:32,417
very often in the future.

893
01:02:37,326 --> 01:02:38,625
Where is his hometown?

894
01:02:39,785 --> 01:02:41,475
Yimeng Mountain, Shandong Province,

895
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:44,575
Linyi City, Gu Town.

896
01:02:46,368 --> 01:02:48,259
He is two months younger than me.

897
01:03:05,493 --> 01:03:06,600
Let's go.

898
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:21,867
We may meet the enemy ahead.

899
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,017
Don't open it.

900
01:03:29,243 --> 01:03:32,659
Núi Nangnim

901
01:03:32,785 --> 01:03:36,159
Sir, I can't detect the radio working here.

902
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:37,534
No way!

903
01:03:37,535 --> 01:03:40,950
With many Chinese soldiers marching,

904
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,159
they must communicate with each other.

905
01:03:42,183 --> 01:03:43,761
I know they're down there.

906
01:03:43,785 --> 01:03:46,200
This is the last cell that we have not considered.

907
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,242
Direction 1g. Fly lower to see.

908
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,525
Wing 2, he flew to the east of the valley.

909
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,159
Open door.

910
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,242
- Boss, it's very windy outside. 
- Open door!

911
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:52,534
Lieutenant, I'm down!

912
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:54,284
No, boss!

913
01:04:54,285 --> 01:04:55,925
It's dangerous!

914
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,575
Lower!

915
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,409
Give me the camera.

916
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:29,742
Lieutenant, take me to the next section!

917
01:05:53,118 --> 01:05:53,617
Stop!

918
01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:03,284
company captain,

919
01:06:03,285 --> 01:06:04,909
There was gunfire on the other side of the mountain.

920
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:07,317
- Report to the Politician. 
- Yes!

921
01:06:26,285 --> 01:06:27,700
It seems that the surplus is our army.

922
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:35,167
That's right, our army.

923
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,859
They were attacked by American troops.

924
01:06:51,535 --> 01:06:53,534
The enemy is very strong.

925
01:06:53,535 --> 01:06:54,950
If I don't help,

926
01:06:55,201 --> 01:06:57,325
they won't last more than 20'.

927
01:06:57,993 --> 01:07:00,325
The two men continued with the radio to Taeyu-dong.

928
01:07:00,326 --> 01:07:01,909
Make sure you arrive on time.

929
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,492
Vu Thung Dung, Binh Hoa, and 1st Battalion stayed here with me.

930
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:06,425
Give me one of your artillery batteries.

931
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:08,384
I'll send the 3rd Artillery battery with you.

932
01:07:08,618 --> 01:07:10,325
Let me go to war.

933
01:07:11,618 --> 01:07:14,309
This is the first time we have fought directly with the American army.

934
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:16,184
I should be here.

935
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,250
In addition, I taught myself English for 2 years.

936
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,359
Agree.

937
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:51,134
Shoot!

938
01:09:59,743 --> 01:10:01,434
Back! Back!

939
01:10:20,618 --> 01:10:21,617
Attack!

940
01:10:24,118 --> 01:10:25,467
Support them!

941
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:41,484
- Where's my M20, damn it! 
- Shoot!

942
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:46,867
Back! Back!

943
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:47,950
Back!

944
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:51,134
Take the high score and take down the mortar!

945
01:10:58,576 --> 01:10:59,617
Attack!

946
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,750
Quy Xuan Canh 6th Company, Regiment 172!

947
01:11:08,993 --> 01:11:11,842
Ngo Thien Ly Company 7, 1st Storm Regiment.

948
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:14,867
Our mission is to blow up the American signal tower,

949
01:11:15,285 --> 01:11:19,167
cut off communication between the US front line 
and headquarters at Truong Tan Lake!

950
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:23,035
The enemy fire was too strong and we suffered heavy casualties!

951
01:11:23,035 --> 01:11:26,725
Our breakthrough was defeated on the barn in front of the tower.

952
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,742
Platoon leader, Wu Wanli disappeared!

953
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:38,075
Tell them to stop ahead.

954
01:11:38,076 --> 01:11:38,659
Clear.

955
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:40,117
Everyone stop!

956
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:41,950
Does it lag behind?

957
01:11:42,826 --> 01:11:45,225
- It lags behind! 
- That son of a bitch!

958
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:52,159
Lei, listen.

959
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,292
There are reinforcements.

960
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,450
- What should I do? 
- We can't let them pass.

961
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:19,517
Stop them right here.

962
01:12:21,243 --> 01:12:24,034
Put radio escorts and squishy soldiers first.

963
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:25,659
Tanks have limited visibility.

964
01:12:26,243 --> 01:12:27,367
I'll take the peaks.

965
01:12:27,368 --> 01:12:28,909
Tanks can't reach us.

966
01:12:29,326 --> 01:12:31,492
Mortars need concentrated fire

967
01:12:31,493 --> 01:12:34,125
and take down their troop transport first.

968
01:12:46,535 --> 01:12:47,409
Why do I come here?

969
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:48,484
Don't come up here!

970
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,492
- There's another guy, Take it down! 
- Where?

971
01:14:10,493 --> 01:14:13,409
At 2 o'clock, keep shooting!

972
01:14:50,493 --> 01:14:51,784
Who told you to come up here?

973
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:53,242
Get in, now!

974
01:14:59,076 --> 01:15:00,392
- Vu Thung Dung! 
- Yes, boss!

975
01:15:00,618 --> 01:15:02,534
- Go get the explosion! 
- Yes!

976
01:15:04,285 --> 01:15:07,067
Ask the rest to defend and save the wounded!

977
01:15:09,035 --> 01:15:10,634
Fast! Go there!

978
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:41,950
Diep, knife!

979
01:15:42,785 --> 01:15:43,892
Platoon captain.

980
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:54,384
Hide away!

981
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,051
Shoot!

982
01:16:15,535 --> 01:16:16,959
Ambush from the hill!

983
01:16:17,076 --> 01:16:18,017
Shoot!

984
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:21,284
Shoot!

985
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:44,700
Find cover, find me where those mortars are!

986
01:16:45,493 --> 01:16:47,075
Scat! Scat!

987
01:16:48,535 --> 01:16:50,434
Withdraw! Withdraw!

988
01:16:50,785 --> 01:16:52,717
Lure them up the hill!

989
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:02,909
Grenade! Fast!

990
01:17:07,368 --> 01:17:08,367
To go!

991
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,059
Vu Thung Dung!

992
01:17:12,451 --> 01:17:13,767
I'm fine!

993
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,859
Don't go over!

994
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:42,450
To go!

995
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:54,525
I will lure them!

996
01:17:54,535 --> 01:17:55,925
- Hear my gunfire! 
- Yes!

997
01:18:04,118 --> 01:18:05,892
Watch out behind!

998
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,200
Politician, problem solved.

999
01:19:33,618 --> 01:19:34,767
Stab him!

1000
01:19:40,201 --> 01:19:41,425
Smash away!

1001
01:19:43,285 --> 01:19:44,734
Stab him!

1002
01:20:12,118 --> 01:20:13,034
Vu Thung Dung!

1003
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,734
Cover me, I chase it.

1004
01:21:09,576 --> 01:21:10,409
Grenade!

1005
01:21:21,535 --> 01:21:22,700
Come here!

1006
01:21:35,951 --> 01:21:37,409
Bend over and sit still!

1007
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:42,175
Hurry up!

1008
01:21:43,035 --> 01:21:44,067
Here!

1009
01:21:45,493 --> 01:21:46,900
Bow low.

1010
01:21:51,285 --> 01:21:52,075
Stevens!

1011
01:21:52,076 --> 01:21:54,250
- Head to 9g, take them down! 
- It's clear!

1012
01:22:32,326 --> 01:22:32,992
Team Captain!

1013
01:22:38,201 --> 01:22:40,134
You stay here and don't go out there.

1014
01:22:40,701 --> 01:22:41,700
Remember!

1015
01:22:42,035 --> 01:22:43,242
Grenades here.

1016
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:46,300
Count to five and throw it away.

1017
01:22:51,493 --> 01:22:53,450
Just shoot!

1018
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:18,575
Prepare.

1019
01:23:19,868 --> 01:23:21,750
1, 2, 3!

1020
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:03,825
Overhead?

1021
01:24:04,618 --> 01:24:05,784
Again!

1022
01:24:39,201 --> 01:24:41,967
Vu, send your men to blow up the signal tower!

1023
01:25:07,076 --> 01:25:07,867
Vu Thung Dung!

1024
01:25:10,993 --> 01:25:14,075
Hey team 3, push to the embankment!

1025
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:16,159
Push up, push up the embankment!

1026
01:25:16,535 --> 01:25:17,325
Scat! Scat!

1027
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:22,367
Company chaos, ambush attack!

1028
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:24,284
Increase 1-1 and 1-2

1029
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:25,742
Go to the tower!

1030
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:13,825
Go to die!

1031
01:26:20,035 --> 01:26:21,409
Go to die!

1032
01:26:26,285 --> 01:26:27,367
Damn it!

1033
01:26:27,368 --> 01:26:28,700
My cannon is stuck!

1034
01:27:43,868 --> 01:27:44,909
Team Captain!

1035
01:28:20,368 --> 01:28:22,450
Captain Ngo, two American tanks

1036
01:28:22,451 --> 01:28:25,225
and dozens of infantrymen heading this way!

1037
01:28:26,576 --> 01:28:29,384
Vu Thung Dung, the American tank that we captured 
from the Battle of South Shandong,

1038
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:31,292
Do you remember how to use it? 
- Yes!

1039
01:28:44,368 --> 01:28:46,367
Damn, I can't see anything!

1040
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:48,625
Me too, okay?

1041
01:29:22,701 --> 01:29:23,700
Stop!

1042
01:29:46,493 --> 01:29:47,700
Hold tight!

1043
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:49,659
I cannot stop it.

1044
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:09,517
Are you okay?

1045
01:31:12,368 --> 01:31:13,459
I'm fine.

1046
01:31:13,785 --> 01:31:14,992
Come on out of here.

1047
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,325
36,

1048
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:50,367
37,

1049
01:31:52,618 --> 01:31:52,950
38,

1050
01:32:40,118 --> 01:32:40,534
39,

1051
01:32:40,993 --> 01:32:42,034
40...

1052
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:55,600
Attack!

1053
01:32:58,076 --> 01:32:59,200
Watch!

1054
01:33:05,118 --> 01:33:06,542
Run!

1055
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:22,325
Damn, we have to get out of here!

1056
01:33:22,326 --> 01:33:24,117
To go! To go! To go!

1057
01:35:12,785 --> 01:35:14,284
It's dad's fault.

1058
01:35:52,035 --> 01:35:53,809
I hope our next generation

1059
01:35:56,035 --> 01:35:58,384
no longer have to live in war.

1060
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:08,034
Why do you disobey orders?

1061
01:36:08,493 --> 01:36:10,634
How can I come here by myself?

1062
01:36:13,785 --> 01:36:15,625
I want to be with you.

1063
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:18,450
Is that my reason?

1064
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,150
Because you are my brother.

1065
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:35,892
Are you hungry?

1066
01:36:48,493 --> 01:36:51,517
In the army, you have to obey orders.

1067
01:36:51,785 --> 01:36:56,800
Your teammates can die for your mistake 
if you act on your own accord.

1068
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:59,109
Do you understand?

1069
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,325
Go write self-criticism.

1070
01:37:13,201 --> 01:37:15,042
What is self-examination?

1071
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:30,200
Hagaruri American Airfield, Eastern Front

1072
01:37:30,785 --> 01:37:33,284
Hagaruri Headquarters,

1073
01:37:33,326 --> 01:37:34,742
Whirlybird 1, hết.

1074
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,575
Move on, Whirlybird 1.

1075
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,159
Where do you want us to land? Over.

1076
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:41,367
Go to Pan 1, done.

1077
01:37:41,493 --> 01:37:42,800
Received, finished.

1078
01:37:51,076 --> 01:37:52,034
Strictly!

1079
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:52,992
Rest.

1080
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,867
Sir, here's the report.

1081
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:57,417
Sir, General Almond is here.

1082
01:38:10,826 --> 01:38:11,784
Strictly!

1083
01:38:12,285 --> 01:38:14,242
General Oliver Smith,

1084
01:38:15,243 --> 01:38:17,817
What the hell is that runway out there?

1085
01:38:18,201 --> 01:38:19,450
I'm building an airport.

1086
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,575
Because it's essential if I'm in charge

1087
01:38:21,576 --> 01:38:23,075
for every life here.

1088
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:23,742
A cup of coffee.

1089
01:38:23,785 --> 01:38:26,075
Fatal mistake in combat

1090
01:38:26,118 --> 01:38:28,600
without the will to win!

1091
01:38:29,368 --> 01:38:31,242
Look outside, General.

1092
01:38:31,951 --> 01:38:34,700
Our troops are trapped between the mountains of hell

1093
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:36,259
and sub-zero temperatures.

1094
01:38:36,326 --> 01:38:38,117
And now, I have a report

1095
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,200
about the Chinese army in Van Son.

1096
01:38:40,243 --> 01:38:42,825
Your command is to move forward!

1097
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:44,742
This won't be a flash war

1098
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:46,200
that MacArthur expected.

1099
01:38:46,243 --> 01:38:48,200
This fight follows the schedule!

1100
01:38:48,285 --> 01:38:51,300
And it's your job to keep it, Smith!

1101
01:38:51,326 --> 01:38:53,159
Regarding the mission,

1102
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:55,867
I'm the leader of this task force,

1103
01:38:55,868 --> 01:38:57,075
Edward.

1104
01:38:57,951 --> 01:38:59,159
Where's the coffee?

1105
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:03,159
When it's all over,

1106
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,684
You will have to face the consequences.

1107
01:39:08,826 --> 01:39:09,825
It's correct,

1108
01:39:09,868 --> 01:39:11,575
I will, Edward.

1109
01:39:12,535 --> 01:39:13,867
We will.

1110
01:39:15,743 --> 01:39:17,492
25/ 11

1111
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:20,559
My men will be on the west line.

1112
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:22,584
And if you don't come,

1113
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,442
I will peel your scalp!

1114
01:39:24,576 --> 01:39:27,434
I will skin your scalp with my own hands!

1115
01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:38,492
A sugar cube, boss?

1116
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:53,659
Binh Hoa, Truong Quy.

1117
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:55,492
Near by.

1118
01:39:56,035 --> 01:39:57,200
Near by.

1119
01:39:57,243 --> 01:39:58,200
Are you guys hungry?

1120
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:00,742
Yes.

1121
01:40:01,243 --> 01:40:02,725
Endure the dike.

1122
01:40:14,326 --> 01:40:15,409
Our army.

1123
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:16,784
I see that.

1124
01:40:21,576 --> 01:40:23,534
Commanding Officer, 7th Attack Company has arrived

1125
01:40:23,535 --> 01:40:24,825
bring 12 radios

1126
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,634
and 4 ciphers under orders, please check.

1127
01:40:28,535 --> 01:40:31,035
- Ly, put the weak muscles in first. 
- Yes!

1128
01:40:31,035 --> 01:40:33,076
- Comrades, bring in the radio. 
- Yes!

1129
01:40:33,076 --> 01:40:34,875
Guys, come with me.

1130
01:40:43,535 --> 01:40:46,067
- Save, take them on vacation. 
- Yes.

1131
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:48,175
Thank you, Commanding Officer.

1132
01:40:50,035 --> 01:40:51,584
- Ngo, please come with me. 
- Thank you.

1133
01:40:51,785 --> 01:40:52,825
Let's go.

1134
01:40:58,201 --> 01:40:59,534
You're not dead.

1135
01:41:07,201 --> 01:41:08,367
What did you write?

1136
01:41:09,285 --> 01:41:10,200
Seen, Seen!

1137
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:28,784
Comrades, let me read it to you.

1138
01:41:28,785 --> 01:41:30,950
Self-criticism of Comrade Ngo Van Ly.

1139
01:41:31,326 --> 01:41:34,867
No, no, it's an all-zero report.

1140
01:41:36,451 --> 01:41:40,367
I disobeyed Commander Lei.

1141
01:41:41,785 --> 01:41:43,392
I went to 0 my brother.

1142
01:41:44,326 --> 01:41:46,334
I'm 0. I won't do that again.

1143
01:41:49,493 --> 01:41:50,575
politician,

1144
01:41:50,618 --> 01:41:52,000
My little comrade is growing up.

1145
01:41:52,076 --> 01:41:55,100
Good attitude, but not signed does not count.

1146
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:57,034
Sign it.

1147
01:41:59,076 --> 01:42:02,125
If you break the egg from the inside,

1148
01:42:02,368 --> 01:42:04,584
you might have a chance to lay more eggs.

1149
01:42:05,201 --> 01:42:06,409
Get out of here!

1150
01:42:07,993 --> 01:42:09,267
And you.

1151
01:42:10,993 --> 01:42:12,325
You're a fucking kid,

1152
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:14,275
Do you make fun of others?

1153
01:42:14,368 --> 01:42:17,200
Comrades and comrades Vu Thung Dung

1154
01:42:17,243 --> 01:42:20,450
was so scared that he peed his pants, the first time he went to war.

1155
01:42:20,493 --> 01:42:22,117
I did the laundry for him myself.

1156
01:42:22,493 --> 01:42:24,517
I can testify to that.

1157
01:42:26,868 --> 01:42:28,950
Everyone, change your torn clothes

1158
01:42:28,951 --> 01:42:30,909
or dirty clothes here.

1159
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:32,475
Change into these clean clothes.

1160
01:42:32,993 --> 01:42:34,434
Thank you for your concern, comrade.

1161
01:42:34,493 --> 01:42:35,400
He's had a hard time.

1162
01:42:35,451 --> 01:42:36,700
Dachuan, choose three clean uniforms

1163
01:42:36,868 --> 01:42:38,284
and take out cotton to make a first aid bandage.

1164
01:42:38,326 --> 01:42:39,784
Share the rest with my comrades.

1165
01:42:39,826 --> 01:42:41,409
Prioritize wounded soldiers.

1166
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:43,867
Obviously, priority is given to wounded soldiers.

1167
01:42:46,868 --> 01:42:48,617
Draw your little house again?

1168
01:42:51,493 --> 01:42:53,075
If I don't come back,

1169
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:55,575
give this to my parents.

1170
01:42:56,451 --> 01:42:57,825
They cannot read.

1171
01:42:57,868 --> 01:43:01,450
Ask the teachers in the village to read to them.

1172
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:03,784
This is taboo.

1173
01:43:03,785 --> 01:43:05,917
Change it. Brick it away.

1174
01:43:07,785 --> 01:43:09,159
You don't have that little triangle

1175
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,200
on previous drawings.

1176
01:43:10,201 --> 01:43:11,259
What is it?

1177
01:43:15,576 --> 01:43:17,509
I buried Baili there.

1178
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:27,534
Let me see.

1179
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:32,117
This is beautiful. This is beautiful.

1180
01:43:35,285 --> 01:43:36,950
Đồng chí, ăn no chưa?

1181
01:43:39,243 --> 01:43:41,175
We have more here if you want.

1182
01:43:58,450 --> 01:43:59,850
Seen,

1183
01:44:00,326 --> 01:44:03,384
How many Americans must be killed to become a hero?

1184
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:05,950
Just two?

1185
01:44:06,326 --> 01:44:08,034
Add a zero after it.

1186
01:44:08,493 --> 01:44:11,075
I have to kill 20 to be a hero?

1187
01:44:11,868 --> 01:44:13,075
You were a hero

1188
01:44:13,076 --> 01:44:15,450
if you were in battle.

1189
01:44:15,618 --> 01:44:17,034
Who is he?

1190
01:44:24,785 --> 01:44:26,159
Are you at my house or not?

1191
01:44:26,355 --> 01:44:27,508
Is not.

1192
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:30,684
After all, he has no one in his home town of Yi Mong.

1193
01:44:30,743 --> 01:44:33,700
If you live with me, you can stay in Baili's room.

1194
01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:36,534
You can get married and have two kids

1195
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:39,367
with his future wife.

1196
01:44:41,035 --> 01:44:42,242
It looked over at the pigsty.

1197
01:44:42,243 --> 01:44:43,175
I did not come.

1198
01:44:43,201 --> 01:44:46,701
It's good if it's a pigsty. Lei, if you raise pigs,

1199
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:50,617
You can live well. Plus, there's food and shelter.

1200
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:52,284
He will live a happy life.

1201
01:44:53,243 --> 01:44:55,875
Okay, I can go.

1202
01:44:59,035 --> 01:45:02,234
Politician, who is Captain Ngo?

1203
01:45:03,701 --> 01:45:04,575
Any.

1204
01:45:06,035 --> 01:45:08,225
Commander Ngo, he's looking for you.

1205
01:45:09,993 --> 01:45:11,075
Hello, Commander Ngo.

1206
01:45:11,951 --> 01:45:13,700
- I'm Assistant Save from Command. 
- Hi.

1207
01:45:13,701 --> 01:45:14,967
- It's hard for you. 
- It's my duty.

1208
01:45:15,451 --> 01:45:17,609
But your Company must be on its way.

1209
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,450
We received a call from our superiors.

1210
01:45:21,451 --> 01:45:23,575
The eastern and western fronts will jointly launch an all-out offensive.

1211
01:45:23,618 --> 01:45:28,525
The superiors asked the 7th Company to arrive at the 
1100 point in Sinhung-ni of Truong Tan Lake.

1212
01:45:37,076 --> 01:45:38,959
When do we go?

1213
01:45:46,826 --> 01:45:47,975
Attention, brothers.

1214
01:45:48,035 --> 01:45:48,867
5 minutes, we're on our way.

1215
01:45:48,868 --> 01:45:51,109
- Ready to go. 
- Yes!

1216
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:03,159
Hundreds of thousands of children of commoners

1217
01:46:03,201 --> 01:46:04,617
go to war with a summons.

1218
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:07,050
Why can't I go?

1219
01:46:08,035 --> 01:46:11,409
Peng, let me have it

1220
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:14,742
go with him.

1221
01:46:24,243 --> 01:46:30,534
The 9th Army approaches Changbin Lake

1222
01:46:59,451 --> 01:47:03,992
Commander of the 9th Army's Front Department 
Chengfang-dong, Korea

1223
01:47:20,951 --> 01:47:24,284
Command from CHS, before we reach the specified point.

1224
01:47:24,368 --> 01:47:26,875
Strictly turn off the radio.

1225
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:34,142
I sent cotton uniforms to combat units?

1226
01:47:34,910 --> 01:47:35,909
Not yet.

1227
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:40,134
Without air supremacy, it is difficult to secure logistics.

1228
01:47:40,243 --> 01:47:42,817
In addition, our fleet was subjected to air raids.

1229
01:47:44,201 --> 01:47:46,325
We have to find every possible way

1230
01:47:46,368 --> 01:47:49,467
to send cotton uniforms to frontline units soon!

1231
01:47:52,368 --> 01:47:55,450
We cannot let our soldiers freeze to death on the battlefield.

1232
01:47:57,493 --> 01:47:59,909
How many days will my rations last?

1233
01:47:59,993 --> 01:48:03,325
If we eat one potato every day, it will last 
us to Sinhung-ni at most.

1234
01:48:03,368 --> 01:48:05,742
We should find a way to save some

1235
01:48:05,993 --> 01:48:07,725
for wounded soldiers.

1236
01:48:08,785 --> 01:48:10,159
Take these potatoes.

1237
01:48:10,785 --> 01:48:12,159
Take them.

1238
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:17,534
23/ 11/ 1950

1239
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,492
Don't push, wait your turn.

1240
01:48:38,743 --> 01:48:39,992
Get out of here.

1241
01:48:40,035 --> 01:48:42,084
Come on... I just want bacon.

1242
01:48:53,243 --> 01:48:54,625
Leave them out.

1243
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:19,317
This is soft.

1244
01:49:27,326 --> 01:49:30,492
Plenty for Donald Duck to come home for Thanksgiving.

1245
01:49:30,576 --> 01:49:32,742
Instead, he submitted his 
Christmas wish list.

1246
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:35,784
I'm not looking forward to the mom this Thanksgiving.

1247
01:49:35,785 --> 01:49:36,992
I'm not looking forward to the mom this Thanksgiving.

1248
01:49:38,785 --> 01:49:40,034
That's the list,

1249
01:49:40,493 --> 01:49:42,975
But what I want is to go home.

1250
01:50:02,910 --> 01:50:07,409
Thien Ly, can I ask why when I was a baby I always bullied you?

1251
01:50:09,326 --> 01:50:10,409
Brother?

1252
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,409
Yes.

1253
01:50:14,826 --> 01:50:16,375
Mom used to give me

1254
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:18,367
delicious food to eat.

1255
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:20,659
When I was born,

1256
01:50:21,701 --> 01:50:23,450
That's not for you anymore.

1257
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:45,167
Binh Hoa, do you still want to tell the truth about Baili?

1258
01:50:49,951 --> 01:50:51,950
Keep it in your heart.

1259
01:51:07,076 --> 01:51:08,784
See, old man.

1260
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:27,084
I, I have news from the Air Force.

1261
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:33,284
My family cooks broccoli with cheese for Thanksgiving,

1262
01:51:33,326 --> 01:51:35,284
Do you want to come to our house to celebrate next year?

1263
01:51:35,785 --> 01:51:37,292
I will, buddy.

1264
01:51:37,326 --> 01:51:38,909
If we go home.

1265
01:51:39,826 --> 01:51:40,534
Strictly!

1266
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:42,017
Rest.

1267
01:51:49,076 --> 01:51:53,026
No sign of enemy, pilots reported signal interference

1268
01:51:53,035 --> 01:51:55,617
every time they fly over this area.

1269
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:57,942
Here?

1270
01:51:57,993 --> 01:51:58,825
Yes Boss.

1271
01:52:14,993 --> 01:52:16,825
25/ 11/ 1950

1272
01:52:17,035 --> 01:52:17,992
I do not believe!

1273
01:52:17,993 --> 01:52:18,742
You must leave!

1274
01:52:19,035 --> 01:52:19,700
Dang Hoa!

1275
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:22,409
Turn off the radio!

1276
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:22,909
Clear!

1277
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:23,992
Turn off the radio!

1278
01:52:24,535 --> 01:52:25,784
Cao Thuy Tan!

1279
01:52:25,785 --> 01:52:26,242
Here.

1280
01:52:26,285 --> 01:52:27,117
Did you bring a map?

1281
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:27,742
Yes.

1282
01:52:27,826 --> 01:52:28,325
Let's go.

1283
01:52:28,451 --> 01:52:29,492
Enemy plane here!

1284
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,342
- Withdraw now! 
- Fast!

1285
01:52:34,285 --> 01:52:36,017
Enter the air defense bunker.

1286
01:52:36,035 --> 01:52:37,784
Hurry up!

1287
01:52:38,493 --> 01:52:39,617
- Boy. 
- Fast!

1288
01:52:39,618 --> 01:52:40,450
Those behind, keep up!

1289
01:52:40,451 --> 01:52:41,075
Are coming!

1290
01:52:42,785 --> 01:52:45,659
Hurry up, keep up!

1291
01:52:46,826 --> 01:52:47,409
What's wrong?

1292
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:48,367
Hurry hurry!

1293
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:49,992
There is still a map on the wall.

1294
01:52:49,993 --> 01:52:51,575
We don't have that many maps to spare.

1295
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:52,492
Take this!

1296
01:52:59,410 --> 01:53:02,634
Team 2, on duty.

1297
01:54:15,576 --> 01:54:19,167
Commander, I lost contact with Taeyu-dong.

1298
01:54:34,035 --> 01:54:37,367
Commander Peng, these things belong to the martyrs,

1299
01:54:37,743 --> 01:54:39,225
Assistant Save.

1300
01:55:21,493 --> 01:55:25,242
Deputy Commander Deng, we have no information on Assistant Liu.

1301
01:55:25,701 --> 01:55:26,950
Who is he?

1302
01:55:27,035 --> 01:55:28,284
What is his full name?

1303
01:55:33,285 --> 01:55:34,367
Dang Hoa.

1304
01:55:35,368 --> 01:55:40,034
The other day, November 27, 1950,

1305
01:55:40,035 --> 01:55:43,034
The 9th Army Corps will begin the general offensive at Truong Tan Lake.

1306
01:55:43,035 --> 01:55:44,284
They have...

1307
01:55:45,076 --> 01:55:46,825
Do they know what to do?

1308
01:55:48,326 --> 01:55:49,325
Yes.

1309
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:52,742
Clear me a new headquarters!

1310
01:55:53,368 --> 01:55:54,625
Clear!

1311
01:56:16,493 --> 01:56:20,492
Currently... 38th, 39th and 40th Army Corps

1312
01:56:20,826 --> 01:56:23,034
gathered at Thanh Thon river.

1313
01:56:23,993 --> 01:56:27,617
He had to quickly complete the deployment in 
the Ho Truong Tan war zone.

1314
01:56:27,618 --> 01:56:29,575
In two days, the east and west fronts will begin

1315
01:56:29,576 --> 01:56:31,367
total attack at the same time.

1316
01:56:31,368 --> 01:56:34,284
Song Shi Luan, remember.

1317
01:56:34,285 --> 01:56:35,325
Remember!

1318
01:56:35,326 --> 01:56:37,867
Smash their mother!

1319
01:56:41,618 --> 01:56:43,367
The 20th Army will split up and surround the enemy

1320
01:56:43,368 --> 01:56:45,617
ở Koto-ri, Yudam-ni và Hagaru-ri.

1321
01:56:45,785 --> 01:56:47,575
Make sure 27th Army concentrates its fire

1322
01:56:47,576 --> 01:56:49,367
destroy American troops in Sinhung-ni.

1323
01:56:49,368 --> 01:56:49,825
Clear!

1324
01:56:50,243 --> 01:56:52,525
After the 27th Army destroyed two large enemy strongholds,

1325
01:56:52,576 --> 01:56:54,284
destroy the airport in Hagaru-ri

1326
01:56:54,285 --> 01:56:55,909
and cut the enemy's air line.

1327
01:56:56,118 --> 01:56:58,617
Meanwhile, prevent the enemy from reinforcing the north.

1328
01:56:58,910 --> 01:56:59,284
Clear.

1329
01:56:59,285 --> 01:57:01,117
Where is the 27th Army now?

1330
01:57:01,368 --> 01:57:02,942
They have reached the designated point.

1331
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:06,200
The Commander of the 27th Corps to cover and stay strong

1332
01:57:06,618 --> 01:57:08,700
so that we can stop the enemy from running south

1333
01:57:08,701 --> 01:57:10,159
Where is the 26 o'clock corps?

1334
01:57:10,326 --> 01:57:11,459
According to the original plan,

1335
01:57:11,535 --> 01:57:13,409
they are 100km from Koto-ri.

1336
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:14,284
Commander of the 26th Army Corps

1337
01:57:14,535 --> 01:57:16,492
immediately marched 50km towards Truong Tan Lake.

1338
01:57:16,493 --> 01:57:17,200
Clear.

1339
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:21,117
20th and 27th corps ready for battle

1340
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:22,867
and act at the same time as the Western front.

1341
01:57:22,868 --> 01:57:25,534
Start of total attack

1342
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,167
4:30 pm on the 27th!

1343
01:57:27,285 --> 01:57:27,992
Clear!

1344
01:57:42,368 --> 01:57:44,492
What is the lowest temperature tonight?

1345
01:57:44,993 --> 01:57:46,450
- 40°C.

1346
01:57:52,326 --> 01:57:54,867
We're not just fighting the Americans.

1347
01:57:56,785 --> 01:57:59,409
We are also fighting against God.

1348
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:06,450
General, we have reports of division-sized Chinese attacking troops

1349
01:58:06,451 --> 01:58:07,867
in both Tokchon and Nyongwon.

1350
01:58:09,326 --> 01:58:12,034
That's more than G2 had estimated.

1351
01:58:12,285 --> 01:58:14,909
Four other aspects are also evident.

1352
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:17,450
The whole front is under heavy attack, boss.

1353
01:58:19,243 --> 01:58:20,659
Where do they come from?

1354
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:23,367
Did they fall from the goddamn sky?

1355
01:58:23,535 --> 01:58:26,767
I don't know the boss, but the reports are pouring in.

1356
01:58:30,743 --> 01:58:34,992
Ho Truong Tan, Eastern Front

1357
01:58:58,993 --> 01:59:00,575
Go Go go!

1358
01:59:02,785 --> 01:59:04,867
Hey, way more lights in there!

1359
01:59:09,535 --> 01:59:13,659
9th Company of Volunteers

1360
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:18,834
Did I get the order?

1361
01:59:27,576 --> 01:59:28,242
That guy

1362
01:59:28,243 --> 01:59:28,867
Raised his foot.

1363
01:59:28,868 --> 01:59:29,700
Hurry up!

1364
01:59:30,826 --> 01:59:32,867
Get the crates here!

1365
01:59:32,868 --> 01:59:33,492
Hurry up!

1366
01:59:33,493 --> 01:59:34,450
Get some more!

1367
01:59:34,910 --> 01:59:35,575
Right there!

1368
01:59:35,576 --> 01:59:36,909
Stack on you guys!

1369
01:59:37,618 --> 01:59:39,034
Come on, pick it up!

1370
01:59:39,035 --> 01:59:40,034
Hurry up!

1371
01:59:40,243 --> 01:59:42,992
No, I don't see any sign of the enemy.

1372
01:59:43,243 --> 01:59:45,617
Soldiers leave their mothers, this is not North Korea.

1373
01:59:45,618 --> 01:59:47,117
This is the North Pole.

1374
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:59,825
7th Volunteer Army Company

1375
02:00:11,951 --> 02:00:13,584
Take me to hold it for a while.

1376
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:19,867
What are they singing?

1377
02:00:24,535 --> 02:00:25,492
Don't fall asleep.

1378
02:00:25,493 --> 02:00:26,450
Wake up.

1379
02:00:35,993 --> 02:00:39,950
Merry Christmas.

1380
02:00:40,326 --> 02:00:41,159
What does it mean?

1381
02:00:41,493 --> 02:00:43,700
The American holiday takes place before the New Year.

1382
02:00:43,701 --> 02:00:44,775
Call it Christmas.

1383
02:00:46,076 --> 02:00:47,242
What is it?

1384
02:00:47,576 --> 02:00:49,200
To be truly happy.

1385
02:00:49,493 --> 02:00:51,575
After all, their life is not so much fun.

1386
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:54,534
MacArthur also said they would

1387
02:00:54,701 --> 02:00:56,409
cross the Yalu River before the new year

1388
02:00:56,868 --> 02:00:58,617
so their soldiers can go home to rest.

1389
02:00:58,618 --> 02:00:59,950
Nonsense,

1390
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,867
Do they want to go home on vacation?

1391
02:01:02,243 --> 02:01:04,125
I'll give them a reason to go home.

1392
02:01:13,868 --> 02:01:15,200
Do you miss mom?

1393
02:01:20,368 --> 02:01:24,742
Thien Ly, when Baili died,

1394
02:01:25,535 --> 02:01:27,367
were you with him?

1395
02:01:36,243 --> 02:01:38,367
He lost the lower half of his body

1396
02:01:40,451 --> 02:01:41,784
due to the explosion.

1397
02:01:42,993 --> 02:01:45,825
I can't put his intestines back inside,

1398
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:49,034
no matter how hard you try.

1399
02:01:53,035 --> 02:01:55,950
He said he was very cold.

1400
02:01:57,368 --> 02:01:58,784
He hugged him in his arms.

1401
02:02:02,493 --> 02:02:04,242
His lips

1402
02:02:07,868 --> 02:02:10,075
cyanosis.

1403
02:02:11,951 --> 02:02:13,534
I can't hold

1404
02:02:14,368 --> 02:02:16,325
blood for him.

1405
02:02:17,535 --> 02:02:19,034
He asked me

1406
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:22,192
Help him die early.

1407
02:02:38,618 --> 02:02:40,075
Natural justice,

1408
02:02:41,493 --> 02:02:43,975
Let me be with you.

1409
02:02:48,785 --> 02:02:55,109
If you have excess Baili, I can help you too.

1410
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:29,242
26/ 11/ 1950

1411
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,042
How's it going?

1412
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:35,742
Tanks, Crawler Trucks,

1413
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:40,367
and CHS.

1414
02:04:44,076 --> 02:04:46,867
From the direction of fast forward

1415
02:04:46,910 --> 02:04:49,325
of the US 31st Army Corps

1416
02:04:49,493 --> 02:04:52,034
We can predict the enemy's CHS

1417
02:04:52,035 --> 02:04:57,200
will be established around the high point of 1100.

1418
02:04:57,868 --> 02:05:00,784
They are known as Polar Bears.

1419
02:05:01,035 --> 02:05:02,992
They fought in Siberia during World War 1

1420
02:05:03,243 --> 02:05:05,575
and in the Pacific during World War 2.

1421
02:05:06,243 --> 02:05:07,825
This is their trump card.

1422
02:05:08,076 --> 02:05:09,825
I will show them

1423
02:05:09,826 --> 02:05:12,034
My fists are solid.

1424
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:39,367
Why haven't I seen anything yet?

1425
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:43,492
Do you think something happened?

1426
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:56,492
Monks 59, 79 and 89 arrived at Yudam-ni on time.

1427
02:05:56,951 --> 02:05:59,450
Monks 80 and 81 took up positions at Sinhung-ni.

1428
02:05:59,743 --> 02:06:01,742
What is the speed of Smith corps?

1429
02:06:02,535 --> 02:06:03,492
3km per day.

1430
02:06:03,826 --> 02:06:05,117
They move at snail speed.

1431
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:10,950
According to their marching routes and topography,

1432
02:06:11,076 --> 02:06:13,284
Smith's legion will probably be stretched.

1433
02:06:13,993 --> 02:06:16,367
Then we can divide their formation into several segments.

1434
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:20,325
We must destroy Smith at Changbin Lake.

1435
02:06:23,701 --> 02:06:25,250
Let's wait.

1436
02:06:39,618 --> 02:06:41,450
Peak 1100 is right in front of me.

1437
02:06:41,451 --> 02:06:43,309
If we get there before dawn,

1438
02:06:43,326 --> 02:06:45,450
We can block the way of the American army.

1439
02:06:47,785 --> 02:06:49,492
Don't waste my time here.

1440
02:06:50,493 --> 02:06:52,409
- Report the units. Be ready. 
- Yes.

1441
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:54,034
Bring your gear and get ready to go.

1442
02:06:54,035 --> 02:06:56,059
All attention! Ready to hit the road.

1443
02:06:59,035 --> 02:06:59,659
Lei.

1444
02:07:00,701 --> 02:07:03,200
I kept this just for you.

1445
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:06,992
What do you want?

1446
02:07:07,701 --> 02:07:10,075
Why do you seem so upset?

1447
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:14,900
Fighting the Polar Bear is an extremely difficult battle.

1448
02:07:15,368 --> 02:07:17,009
Can you leave Wanli to me?

1449
02:07:17,535 --> 02:07:19,742
You gave him to me.

1450
02:07:20,201 --> 02:07:21,159
Now I want to take him back.

1451
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:22,459
What are you going to do?

1452
02:07:26,951 --> 02:07:28,825
He charged at the enemy tirelessly. Very helpful for me.

1453
02:07:29,993 --> 02:07:31,700
Take good care of him.

1454
02:07:32,410 --> 02:07:35,659
When the war ends, he will be my adopted son.

1455
02:07:35,785 --> 02:07:37,325
I hope it will take care of me in my old age.

1456
02:07:37,951 --> 02:07:41,284
This bastard, if he's your adopted son,

1457
02:07:41,493 --> 02:07:43,100
What should I call you?

1458
02:07:45,910 --> 02:07:47,125
Call me dad.

1459
02:07:49,076 --> 02:07:51,059
I'll break your old tooth.

1460
02:07:57,910 --> 02:08:00,867
Remember, as soon as the battle begins,

1461
02:08:01,076 --> 02:08:03,934
he followed his brother.

1462
02:08:04,035 --> 02:08:06,117
He's more sensitive and alert than a rabbit.

1463
02:08:06,326 --> 02:08:08,534
The bullets didn't hit him.

1464
02:08:09,826 --> 02:08:11,200
Don't be ostentatious.

1465
02:08:12,535 --> 02:08:15,117
I try to fight well in this war.

1466
02:08:26,243 --> 02:08:27,575
Those behind, speed up!

1467
02:08:43,285 --> 02:08:49,492
27/ 11/ 1950

1468
02:08:55,535 --> 02:08:58,075
Commander, Smith's legion hasn't arrived yet.

1469
02:09:02,326 --> 02:09:03,559
Don't wait any longer.

1470
02:09:06,118 --> 02:09:08,342
5' more to start the total attack.

1471
02:09:10,535 --> 02:09:13,492
Sinhung-ni, Ho Truong Tan

1472
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:26,242
What?

1473
02:09:30,326 --> 02:09:31,534
Have I been discovered?

1474
02:09:31,826 --> 02:09:32,200
Is not.

1475
02:09:32,785 --> 02:09:34,350
We're about to start our attack.

1476
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:41,850
Attack!

1477
02:09:49,785 --> 02:09:53,034
Attack!

1478
02:09:55,826 --> 02:09:57,359
Boarding!

1479
02:10:29,076 --> 02:10:31,034
Enemy Attack, Code Red!

1480
02:10:31,535 --> 02:10:33,367
Block the enemy's attack position.

1481
02:10:35,535 --> 02:10:38,034
Boss, they come from everywhere!

1482
02:10:40,785 --> 02:10:43,784
Dinner is served!

1483
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:45,825
Load cannon!

1484
02:10:45,910 --> 02:10:47,159
Ready,

1485
02:10:47,183 --> 02:10:49,183
shoot!

1486
02:10:57,951 --> 02:11:01,242
Attack!

1487
02:11:48,868 --> 02:11:52,159
Attack!

1488
02:12:24,493 --> 02:12:25,742
Reload bullets!

1489
02:12:26,118 --> 02:12:27,075
Go Go go!

1490
02:12:28,201 --> 02:12:29,325
Need more ammo!

1491
02:12:29,410 --> 02:12:31,867
Never ran out of spare ammo before!

1492
02:12:34,951 --> 02:12:36,200
Reload bullets!

1493
02:12:43,035 --> 02:12:44,784
Would you choose it, Glover?

1494
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:46,492
Yeah, I got it, I got it!

1495
02:12:47,993 --> 02:12:49,242
Okay, we have to go!

1496
02:12:49,493 --> 02:12:50,950
Prepare the second series!

1497
02:12:51,285 --> 02:12:52,284
They come!

1498
02:12:58,451 --> 02:13:00,884
You think we'll make it in time for dinner?

1499
02:13:00,951 --> 02:13:01,992
Shut up, Costello!

1500
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:05,225
I'll be lucky if they don't roast my turkey for dinner.

1501
02:13:13,701 --> 02:13:14,534
Fast!

1502
02:13:16,368 --> 02:13:17,825
Fast! Right here!

1503
02:13:17,826 --> 02:13:19,809
2 up front and 3 behind. Fast!

1504
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:36,867
Hide! Hide now!

1505
02:13:37,743 --> 02:13:39,700
Aim for the central watchtower!

1506
02:13:39,868 --> 02:13:40,575
Clear!

1507
02:13:41,025 --> 02:13:43,025
Ready, shoot!

1508
02:13:55,576 --> 02:13:58,117
The way, where's your mortar?

1509
02:14:10,493 --> 02:14:12,867
Adjust up. Adjust up.

1510
02:14:15,701 --> 02:14:16,784
Adjust up.

1511
02:14:27,743 --> 02:14:30,743
Lei, great job!

1512
02:14:33,076 --> 02:14:34,192
Who called me?

1513
02:14:34,285 --> 02:14:35,759
I'm not.

1514
02:14:36,701 --> 02:14:37,742
Fast!

1515
02:14:47,701 --> 02:14:50,367
Article tank guard CHS!

1516
02:15:04,285 --> 02:15:05,617
God, Sunny.

1517
02:15:12,868 --> 02:15:14,450
To go! Find the American flag!

1518
02:15:14,451 --> 02:15:15,534
Destroy their headquarters.

1519
02:15:15,535 --> 02:15:16,284
Clear.

1520
02:15:17,410 --> 02:15:19,242
Sir, the Air Force is coming!

1521
02:15:19,243 --> 02:15:20,534
The enemy is approaching!

1522
02:15:20,535 --> 02:15:22,534
Urgent orders are required, boss!

1523
02:15:23,868 --> 02:15:25,367
Aim at them now!

1524
02:15:35,826 --> 02:15:36,409
Fast!

1525
02:15:37,285 --> 02:15:38,284
Transfer bullets to them!

1526
02:15:38,451 --> 02:15:39,200
Hurry up!

1527
02:15:39,326 --> 02:15:39,867
Clear.

1528
02:16:00,660 --> 02:16:01,367
Tanks come!

1529
02:16:01,368 --> 02:16:02,075
Go that way!

1530
02:16:03,201 --> 02:16:04,159
Find shelter!

1531
02:16:04,951 --> 02:16:06,659
Hurry up, hide!

1532
02:16:12,451 --> 02:16:12,950
To go!

1533
02:16:20,785 --> 02:16:21,967
Bazooka!

1534
02:16:22,035 --> 02:16:23,142
Here!

1535
02:16:56,368 --> 02:16:57,475
Run!

1536
02:17:08,743 --> 02:17:09,617
Leave me alone!

1537
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:10,867
What a try!

1538
02:17:11,410 --> 02:17:12,200
To go!

1539
02:17:18,076 --> 02:17:19,325
To go!

1540
02:17:37,576 --> 02:17:40,567
Don't fall asleep, my friend. Wait for me.

1541
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:09,909
Dai Chuan! Dai Chuan!

1542
02:18:10,368 --> 02:18:11,284
Attack!

1543
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:12,742
Attack!

1544
02:18:18,368 --> 02:18:19,342
Watch!

1545
02:18:19,410 --> 02:18:20,659
Up there!

1546
02:18:24,451 --> 02:18:25,492
Spread out!

1547
02:18:29,243 --> 02:18:31,075
Spread out!

1548
02:20:50,243 --> 02:20:51,242
Grenade!

1549
02:21:07,826 --> 02:21:08,909
Rush forward!

1550
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:10,125
To hit!

1551
02:22:00,451 --> 02:22:01,242
Honey!

1552
02:22:13,701 --> 02:22:15,784
Spread out!

1553
02:22:15,951 --> 02:22:17,784
Lay!

1554
02:22:18,076 --> 02:22:19,034
Fast!

1555
02:22:26,118 --> 02:22:26,825
Grenade!

1556
02:22:38,743 --> 02:22:39,450
Back!

1557
02:22:39,535 --> 02:22:39,992
Hide!

1558
02:22:40,410 --> 02:22:41,242
Climb up! Fast!

1559
02:22:41,285 --> 02:22:43,242
Boarding! Block them!

1560
02:22:44,951 --> 02:22:48,192
Daring fools are never heroes!

1561
02:22:48,201 --> 02:22:49,825
Calm!

1562
02:22:49,826 --> 02:22:51,784
You must stay calm on the battlefield!

1563
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:27,325
I order a full withdrawal!

1564
02:23:27,785 --> 02:23:28,867
Obey!

1565
02:23:29,118 --> 02:23:30,325
Units retreat!

1566
02:23:30,326 --> 02:23:31,534
Burn it all!

1567
02:23:36,410 --> 02:23:37,784
Out of here!

1568
02:23:38,243 --> 02:23:39,034
To go!

1569
02:23:39,076 --> 02:23:39,784
They retreat!

1570
02:23:39,826 --> 02:23:40,700
Block them!

1571
02:23:40,724 --> 02:23:43,224
Withdraw!

1572
02:24:21,951 --> 02:24:23,559
Boss, the car is ready!

1573
02:24:27,826 --> 02:24:28,742
To go!

1574
02:24:34,826 --> 02:24:35,909
Back!

1575
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:37,742
Back!

1576
02:25:15,743 --> 02:25:16,742
What are you doing?

1577
02:25:17,701 --> 02:25:20,142
Only 8 more left! I'm almost 20!

1578
02:25:26,326 --> 02:25:28,075
Several shots had to be fired.

1579
02:25:28,118 --> 02:25:30,159
Some shots may stop.

1580
02:26:12,076 --> 02:26:13,950
Units, move to position.

1581
02:26:13,993 --> 02:26:15,325
Wait for orders.

1582
02:26:15,368 --> 02:26:16,284
I repeat.

1583
02:26:16,326 --> 02:26:17,992
Wait for orders.

1584
02:26:18,035 --> 02:26:19,692
To go! To go! To go!

1585
02:26:21,118 --> 02:26:22,909
Units, into position.

1586
02:26:22,951 --> 02:26:24,284
Wait for orders.

1587
02:26:24,326 --> 02:26:25,242
I repeat.

1588
02:26:25,285 --> 02:26:26,992
Wait for orders.

1589
02:26:30,201 --> 02:26:32,117
Boss, Sinhung-ni called

1590
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,825
Request reinforcement immediately.

1591
02:26:33,868 --> 02:26:35,992
They are withdrawing urgently.

1592
02:26:36,076 --> 02:26:39,559
Landman, give Sinhung-ni reinforcements. Scat!

1593
02:26:47,576 --> 02:26:50,575
Hagaru-ri

1594
02:26:50,993 --> 02:26:53,525
Units assemble immediately and count the remaining numbers.

1595
02:26:53,535 --> 02:26:55,117
Company 2, Battalion 3 stayed to guard.

1596
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:56,650
Watch out in all directions!

1597
02:26:56,743 --> 02:26:59,717
3rd Platoon and 6th Platoon, defend southwest.

1598
02:27:09,368 --> 02:27:10,825
Call him the Former Captain.

1599
02:27:12,618 --> 02:27:13,984
Former Captain.

1600
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:15,617
Not him.

1601
02:27:19,701 --> 02:27:21,242
I didn't tell you?

1602
02:27:21,826 --> 02:27:25,717
I see, the undefeated hero.

1603
02:27:31,743 --> 02:27:32,950
Wanli.

1604
02:27:37,535 --> 02:27:38,867
How old are you?

1605
02:27:41,285 --> 02:27:42,492
19.

1606
02:28:03,785 --> 02:28:06,825
Kid, did you see the enemy plane?

1607
02:28:08,243 --> 02:28:09,950
Open belly plane

1608
02:28:09,993 --> 02:28:12,034
and dropped bombs.

1609
02:28:12,285 --> 02:28:14,950
Then our troops wore yellow uniforms

1610
02:28:14,993 --> 02:28:16,700
fall from one person to another.

1611
02:28:16,826 --> 02:28:18,892
What do we call those brothers?

1612
02:28:19,118 --> 02:28:20,942
who was killed in the quest?

1613
02:28:22,243 --> 02:28:24,159
What do we call frozen people?

1614
02:28:24,201 --> 02:28:26,292
After marching for 6 days and nights

1615
02:28:26,368 --> 02:28:28,692
No food or sleep?

1616
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:33,075
And those who rush 10m to the enemy

1617
02:28:33,118 --> 02:28:34,934
just to throw their grenades?

1618
02:28:34,951 --> 02:28:36,450
They were killed.

1619
02:28:36,618 --> 02:28:37,867
What should we call them?

1620
02:28:43,743 --> 02:28:45,492
There is no hero who never freezes,

1621
02:28:45,535 --> 02:28:47,117
leaving those who were never killed.

1622
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:49,159
Soldiers live only for honor and glory.

1623
02:28:52,785 --> 02:28:54,592
Which one should I call you?

1624
02:28:59,035 --> 02:29:00,742
677th Soldier,

1625
02:29:01,451 --> 02:29:02,575
Ngo Van Ly.

1626
02:29:05,785 --> 02:29:07,809
"Ten thousand" means ten thousand.

1627
02:29:18,451 --> 02:29:19,575
Watch.

1628
02:29:29,701 --> 02:29:31,125
Delicate.

1629
02:29:40,826 --> 02:29:42,275
American plane here!

1630
02:29:42,285 --> 02:29:43,409
Bazooka!

1631
02:29:45,285 --> 02:29:47,825
American plane!

1632
02:29:48,285 --> 02:29:50,017
Find shelter!

1633
02:30:23,451 --> 02:30:24,450
God save me!

1634
02:30:41,243 --> 02:30:41,992
Spread out!

1635
02:30:42,785 --> 02:30:44,492
American Bomb!

1636
02:30:49,243 --> 02:30:49,992
Are you okay?

1637
02:31:03,368 --> 02:31:04,675
What is your name?

1638
02:31:05,118 --> 02:31:09,009
Boss, I'm the 280th soldier of 7th company, Binh Hoa.

1639
02:31:12,576 --> 02:31:13,534
Good FX!

1640
02:31:13,701 --> 02:31:15,867
Spread out!

1641
02:31:15,910 --> 02:31:16,784
Good FX!

1642
02:31:16,826 --> 02:31:18,500
They will bomb us!

1643
02:31:21,118 --> 02:31:22,200
Good FX!

1644
02:31:22,201 --> 02:31:24,325
Spread out!

1645
02:31:25,035 --> 02:31:26,825
Clear vision, clear vision.

1646
02:31:26,868 --> 02:31:28,450
Ready to drop. Over.

1647
02:31:48,243 --> 02:31:51,325
Enemy plane! Spread out!

1648
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:26,184
This guy will send you FX bombs back!

1649
02:33:00,326 --> 02:33:02,034
Bastard.

1650
02:33:54,535 --> 02:34:00,325
People say...

1651
02:34:06,076 --> 02:34:13,325
People say

1652
02:34:13,326 --> 02:34:20,200
Nghi Mong mountain is the best.

1653
02:34:20,660 --> 02:34:26,659
Scenic

1654
02:34:26,868 --> 02:34:33,117
on Nghi Mong mountain.

1655
02:34:35,826 --> 02:34:37,659
Lift the car up.

1656
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:16,825
That's hurt.

1657
02:35:18,201 --> 02:35:19,992
That's hurt.

1658
02:35:44,118 --> 02:35:45,284
Do not...

1659
02:35:50,910 --> 02:35:53,034
Do not...

1660
02:35:55,535 --> 02:35:58,242
Don't leave me alone here.

1661
02:36:37,326 --> 02:36:38,659
Why do you want to join the army?

1662
02:36:39,326 --> 02:36:41,200
Then Thien Ly will take me seriously.

1663
02:36:42,701 --> 02:36:43,992
What are you talking about?

1664
02:36:45,243 --> 02:36:46,909
You're just tough enough

1665
02:36:46,951 --> 02:36:48,159
when your enemies take you seriously.

1666
02:37:41,451 --> 02:37:44,075
Lei Sui Sheng.

1667
02:38:36,285 --> 02:38:38,200
It won't hurt anymore.

1668
02:38:42,868 --> 02:38:45,159
It won't hurt anymore.

1669
02:38:54,743 --> 02:38:56,575
You did well, Lei.

1670
02:39:06,785 --> 02:39:07,575
Give me.

1671
02:39:14,701 --> 02:39:16,284
When I went home last time,

1672
02:39:16,451 --> 02:39:21,909
Every time I go out, people nod and smile at me.

1673
02:39:26,535 --> 02:39:27,992
I don't know them,

1674
02:39:32,118 --> 02:39:34,825
but they recognized my uniform.

1675
02:39:38,118 --> 02:39:41,159
Before I left the house, my daughter asked me,

1676
02:39:42,743 --> 02:39:45,450
"Dad, why fight this war?"

1677
02:39:46,035 --> 02:39:48,284
If we don't fight this war,

1678
02:39:48,826 --> 02:39:51,492
My next generation will have to fight it.

1679
02:39:54,118 --> 02:39:56,125
I risk my life

1680
02:39:59,326 --> 02:40:01,784
to give them a peaceful life.

1681
02:40:03,951 --> 02:40:05,784
My mom keeps staring at me

1682
02:40:06,868 --> 02:40:08,825
Don't say a word

1683
02:40:10,035 --> 02:40:12,034
when I leave the house.

1684
02:40:13,951 --> 02:40:15,284
I know

1685
02:40:17,076 --> 02:40:18,825
She doesn't want me to go.

1686
02:40:20,368 --> 02:40:21,992
My wife said

1687
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:23,867
when i come home next time,

1688
02:40:25,035 --> 02:40:28,792
I have to teach my daughter to do math.

1689
02:40:43,076 --> 02:40:44,759
I must win the war

1690
02:40:44,951 --> 02:40:47,042
and bring them home.

1691
02:41:04,201 --> 02:41:07,325
Hagaruri Airport The Great American Evacuation.

1692
02:41:08,243 --> 02:41:11,000
Sir, your helicopter is here. The boss can go at any time.

1693
02:41:12,576 --> 02:41:14,367
The 5th and 7th regiments have not arrived yet

1694
02:41:14,410 --> 02:41:16,992
and this will be an important evacuation route.

1695
02:41:20,076 --> 02:41:23,084
- All equipment is loaded on board now. 
- OK, get ready.

1696
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:33,284
He sent that helicopter to evacuate the wounded.

1697
02:41:33,285 --> 02:41:35,659
Those people are not out of danger yet!

1698
02:41:38,618 --> 02:41:40,075
Hey, get out! Cheers!

1699
02:41:47,118 --> 02:41:48,625
Out of here!

1700
02:41:59,243 --> 02:42:01,117
US Marines withdraw from Hagaruri towards Sumun Bridge,

1701
02:42:01,160 --> 02:42:05,650
on the way past the high point 1071.

1702
02:42:05,660 --> 02:42:07,450
3rd Division 58th Volunteer Army

1703
02:42:07,493 --> 02:42:10,700
Avoid many attacks from US Marines.

1704
02:42:22,201 --> 02:42:25,034
Go now! Go away! Go away!

1705
02:42:33,035 --> 02:42:34,450
American plane here!

1706
02:42:34,951 --> 02:42:36,200
American plane here!

1707
02:42:36,201 --> 02:42:37,075
Hide!

1708
02:42:42,493 --> 02:42:43,450
Lay!

1709
02:43:00,811 --> 02:43:03,811
Yang Gan Tu, 3rd Platoon Commander

1710
02:43:00,410 --> 02:43:01,825
Comrades,

1711
02:43:01,993 --> 02:43:03,534
forward!

1712
02:43:06,451 --> 02:43:10,200
Battalion commander, we have repelled 
the enemy attack once again.

1713
02:43:11,826 --> 02:43:12,992
Our captain said,

1714
02:43:12,993 --> 02:43:14,509
We must fight!

1715
02:43:20,285 --> 02:43:21,242
Grenade!

1716
02:43:21,701 --> 02:43:23,059
Who else?

1717
02:43:46,535 --> 02:43:50,292
Comrades, I have held the battlefield 24g

1718
02:43:50,368 --> 02:43:52,117
and repel 7 waves of enemy attacks.

1719
02:43:52,368 --> 02:43:54,200
Even if I reach the last one,

1720
02:43:54,701 --> 02:43:57,750
I never let the enemy pass under my feet!

1721
02:43:58,035 --> 02:44:00,250
Fight to the death to defend my front!

1722
02:44:00,285 --> 02:44:02,659
Fight to the death to defend my front!

1723
02:44:35,743 --> 02:44:37,742
I don't believe the quest can't be completed.

1724
02:44:37,785 --> 02:44:39,284
I do not believe in insurmountable difficulties.

1725
02:44:39,326 --> 02:44:40,784
I don't believe the enemy can't be defeated.

1726
02:44:40,993 --> 02:44:42,534
Duong Can Tu

1727
02:44:42,660 --> 02:44:44,284
Master 1 of the US Marines

1728
02:44:44,285 --> 02:44:47,075
Retreat towards the port of Hungnam

1729
02:44:47,076 --> 02:44:50,159
Boss must see this.

1730
02:44:51,868 --> 02:44:53,075
Let me see.

1731
02:45:41,493 --> 02:45:45,584
Fight against these super strong-willed people

1732
02:45:45,951 --> 02:45:48,575
I don't want to win.

1733
02:46:09,076 --> 02:46:15,259
105,000 US 10th Army troops have been evacuated from the 
port of Hungnam. The 9th Army captured the port of Hungnam.

1734
02:46:22,237 --> 02:46:25,827
The Battle of Changbin Lake is a perfect example

1735
02:46:25,851 --> 02:46:29,551
annihilated an American reinforcement regiment

1736
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:32,920
in the war against the American Academy of Korea,

1737
02:46:32,944 --> 02:46:36,544
make American troops on the eastern front

1738
02:46:36,568 --> 02:46:39,668
"The largest retreat in the history of the Marines."

1739
02:46:58,442 --> 02:46:59,642
Second battle of the war

1740
02:46:59,666 --> 02:47:01,766
to resist the Korean American aid,

1741
02:47:01,817 --> 02:47:05,317
The 9th Army achieved great results on the battlefield

1742
02:47:05,341 --> 02:47:08,341
on the eastern front in the Battle of Truong Tan Lake.

1743
02:47:08,403 --> 02:47:13,003
While coordinating with our troops on the western front,

1744
02:47:16,868 --> 02:47:21,892
brave soldiers foiled the pretentious MacArthur's plan 
to "end the war before Christmas" and

1745
02:47:21,951 --> 02:47:27,159
pushed the US-led "UN Command" from 
the Yalu River to the other side of the 38th Parallel.

1746
02:47:27,525 --> 02:47:28,848
The battle that completely tilted the scale of the Korean War

1747
02:47:28,910 --> 02:47:33,075
and set the stage for the final victory of the Korean War of Resistance.

1748
02:47:50,073 --> 02:47:54,073
More than 197,000 Chinese heroically died in the war.

1749
02:47:54,076 --> 02:47:58,692
More than 300,000 heroes including Duong Can Tu, Hoang Ke Quang, 
Khau Thieu Van, etc., and nearly 6,000 people were honored.

1750
02:47:58,782 --> 02:48:00,582
The great spirit from the war endures through time!

1751
02:48:00,606 --> 02:48:05,106
The brave martyrs of the Volunteer Army 
will never be forgotten!

1752
02:48:55,618 --> 02:48:58,792
Which unit can quickly reach 
the Treadway bridge and cut off the enemy's retreat?

1753
02:48:58,826 --> 02:49:00,200
Company 7 of Jinan 1st Regiment.

1754
02:49:00,201 --> 02:49:04,000
Send them to the Treadway Bridge immediately and kill the US Marine.

1755
02:49:18,743 --> 02:49:19,992
Save them first.

1756
02:49:21,243 --> 02:49:21,867
Don't go through.

1757
02:49:22,035 --> 02:49:23,184
There are mines.

1758
02:49:26,201 --> 02:49:27,450
Shoot in the hole!

1759
02:49:30,201 --> 02:49:32,575
Grenade! Fall!

1760
02:49:37,743 --> 02:49:38,742
Bach Ly is my brother.

1761
02:49:38,993 --> 02:49:40,200
You are also my brother.

1762
02:49:40,243 --> 02:49:41,784
All soldiers of Company 7

1763
02:49:42,993 --> 02:49:44,467
are my brothers.

1764
02:49:57,826 --> 02:49:59,892
Destroy their command tower.

1765
02:50:14,035 --> 02:50:16,575
Shoot!

1766
