1
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,700
Xiao Feng,

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,330
let's do what we always do:

3
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,500
help me count

4
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,370
how many people are walking through the gate?

5
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,160
Sure.

6
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,080
Mom,

7
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,910
it was all my fault.

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,790
I shouldn't have lied to Dad.

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,120
I shouldn't have fooled around.

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,290
I will never lie again,

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,410
ever!

12
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,120
Mom!

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
I'm your uncle.

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,620
Not your mom.

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,539
Why did you apply for the police academy?

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,200
I want...

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,200
I want to commit...

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,370
a perfect crime.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,289
Qin, you gonna eat or not?

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,700
Since birth,

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,039
people are destined to play different roles.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
Some roles are good,

23
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,539
while others are evil.

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,370
What's your role?

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,200
Qin, I'm gonna eat yours too.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,200
When you gaze into the abyss,

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,160
the abyss is also gazing into you.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,450
It's ok to gaze,

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,539
but don't linger.

30
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,539
Qin, I left the soup for you.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,250
Qin Feng.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,250
There is ice cream too.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,700
Qin Feng.

34
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,950
What's your role?

35
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,080
Are you a man or a monster?

36
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,200
There's low-calorie yogurt.

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,080
Qin Feng.

38
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,330
And free booze too.

39
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,539
Qin Feng, are you a man or a monster?

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,250
Daddy, I'm sorry!

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,830
Are you a man or a monster?

42
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,539
Have some.

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:46,910
Qin Feng.

44
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,620
Qin.

45
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:47,830
Qin Feng.

46
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,250
Qin.

47
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,750
Qin Feng.

48
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,500
Qin.

49
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,870
You hit me?

50
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,330
No, I didn't.

51
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,450
You didn't hit me?

52
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
Were... were you sleepwalking?

53
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,040
You were the sleeping one.

54
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,699
We'll soon be landing at TokyoNarita International Airport.

55
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,910
Did you eat all of these?

56
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,540
It's just one meal.

57
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,410
One meal?

58
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,830
You were eating from New York to Tokyo.

59
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,540
All of those are free.

60
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,290
Your stomach is going to hurt.

61
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,040
I, Tang Ren, might be a headache for others,

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but my stomach never hurts!

63
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
You're such a jinx.

64
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,040
I need to hit the loo.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,829
Something's not right.

66
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,910
Yeah, my stomach doesn't feel right.

67
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,040
Something's wrong with Noda Hiroshi.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
Yeah, why is he alone?

69
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,829
Don't we deserve a welcoming team

70
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,160
of hundreds of people?

71
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,579
Hi.

72
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,040
Let's go!

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,450
I need to use the restroom.

74
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,540
No time for that.

75
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,450
Where are you rushing into? Your afterlife?

76
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong?

77
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,620
The man at 9 o'clock. His newspaper

78
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,410
is from 3 days ago.

79
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,329
The cleaner at 10 o'clock,

80
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,620
that uniform doesn't fit him.

81
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,660
Those two men at 2 o'clock

82
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,290
who seem to be waiting for someone,

83
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,579
but their eyes are on us all the time.

84
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,500
Vietnamese,

85
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,160
35.

86
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,410
Southeast Asia United Army,

87
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,200
37.

88
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,660
What do they want?

89
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,500
Go.

90
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,540
Kid... kidnap?

91
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,910
Wait... I thought Japan was a lawful society?

92
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,830
What do we do now?

93
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,080
Is Tokyo this dangerous?

94
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,450
Welcome to Tokyo!

95
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,579
Please.

96
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,500
Such a grand opening!

97
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,410
So it is for Watanabe Masaru's case?

98
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,540
Otherwise we wouldn't have you here.

99
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,830
Leave the case alone,

100
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,750
answer my three questions first!

101
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,080
Why do they want to kidnap us?

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,950
Where is your limousine?

103
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,330
And is it equipped with a toilet?

104
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,500
My limousine

105
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,409
is here.

106
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,700
Wait.

107
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,620
What?

108
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,700
I sensed hostility around us.

109
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,950
Where?

110
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,250
Over...

111
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,580
over there.

112
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,700
He's leering.

113
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,410
Does he fancy us?

114
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,910
He's the No.1 detective in Thailand.

115
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,250
Am I not the No.1 detective in Thailand?

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
He's a retired policeman.

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,290
Three years' Muay Thai champion.

118
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:22,910
He's known for his relentless

119
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,700
and invincible "Rabid Dog" style.

120
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,620
Jack Jaa,

121
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,540
the Mad Detective.

122
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,250
Thai Boxing Champion?

123
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,410
If it weren't for my stomach's sake,

124
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,000
that dude,

125
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,450
I'd beat him up every time I meet him.

126
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,290
He's coming this way.

127
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,120
Why do you know him so well?

128
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,500
You haven't been on Crimaster, have you?

129
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,330
This guy is surging in the chart.

130
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,830
He's already made it into the top 10.

131
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,250
Don't be scared.

132
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,370
Backup team!

133
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,700
It looks so painful.

134
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,700
Tang,

135
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,250
we're counting on you.

136
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,410
So what is this case about?

137
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,870
You had such a big scene here.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,950
These people will tell you.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,290
That is the suspect, Watanabe Masaru.

140
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,660
He's also our client.

141
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,410
He's the sixth-generation leader of Black Dragon,

142
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,540
the most powerful mafia in Japan.

143
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,120
The victim, Su Chaiwit.

144
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,290
President of the Southeast Asia Chamber of Commerce.

145
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,250
The sponsor behind gangs like

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,830
the Vietnam Gang and the Greater Malay Gang.

147
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,830
They had been fighting over

148
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,500
the development rights of the new Chinatown in downtown Tokyo.

149
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,540
After several rounds of fights,

150
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,330
it eventually developed into violent confrontations.

151
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,159
The night of the incident,

152
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Watanabe Masaru and Su Chaiwit

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,620
were having the last round of negotiations.

154
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,909
Su Chaiwit was then attacked

155
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,580
and he died on the way to the hospital.

156
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,830
How do you know all of this already?

157
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,620
Q.

158
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,620
Q

159
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,540
The Queen?

160
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,620
Three hours after we got the invitation from Noda Hiroshi,

161
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,540
Q released the information of this 'Ironclad' case on Crimaster.

162
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,580
Ironclad case?

163
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,830
A case that is almost concluded, with no disputes.

164
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,909
All the evidence points to

165
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,080
Watanabe Masaru as the murderer.

166
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,200
Then why are we here? To find a crack in the iron?

167
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,830
You guys are the only variate.

168
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,500
And that's why

169
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,950
they tried to stop us from seeing Watanabe Masaru.

170
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,500
Who will be the judge?

171
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,700
Everyone.

172
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,000
He's persistent.

173
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,450
Get in the car.

174
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,330
They are stealing our cars.

175
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,700
Give it back!

176
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,370
Give it back!

177
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,250
Get rid of him!

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
He is chasing so tight! Is he your ex-boyfriend?

179
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's see for how long he can last!

180
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,160
Tokyo,

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,910
here we come!

182
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
This won't work.

183
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,660
I can't stand this rabid dog any more.

184
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,750
You guys go first!

185
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,000
How "ironclad" is this case?

186
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,370
The only person found at the crime scene was the victim.

187
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,120
There is no entrance or exit for the suspect to assess the room.

188
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,410
It is a perfect locked-room.

189
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,330
So it has to be a homicide, right?

190
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,660
Qin,

191
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,660
we all know it's an ironclad case

192
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,200
and it's risky to work with the gangsters.

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,620
Let's switch to a different case.

194
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,750
A different case?

195
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,120
The rapist-murderer.

196
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,290
I hate them the most.

197
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,370
No... no... way

198
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,450
I'm going to meet Watanabe Masaru

199
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,830
and I'm going to see that locked-room.

200
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,700
Locked-room? What is it with you and locked rooms?

201
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,790
Locked rooms

202
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,410
are the ultimate challenge of detective reasoning.

203
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,330
The Three Coffins.

204
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,080
The Judas Window.

205
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,540
Your window.

206
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,450
Here... here we are.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,830
No can do.

208
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,500
I don't have room for more soup.

209
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,500
Soup in Japan

210
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,870
means bathhouse.

211
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,950
Bathhouse?

212
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,580
The legal ones?

213
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,910
You've been to the illegal ones?

214
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,410
Are we really going in there?

215
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,160
Are you scared?

216
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,330
You're scared!

217
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,620
Then why are you sweating so much?

218
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,870
Because of Tokyo Hot.

219
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,120
Mr.Qin and Mr.Tang?

220
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
Yes, we are.

221
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,040
Welcome.

222
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,450
Beautiful tattoos drawn on their bodies,

223
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,000
a round of applause to the gangsta buddies!

224
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,790
Stop!

225
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,250
They don't speak Chinese.

226
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,910
A group of old farts,

227
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,080
is this a nursing home for tattooed seniors?

228
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,830
The aging of gangsters is a serious issue in Japan.

229
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,040
Younger generations no longer want to join the gang.

230
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,160
Watanabe Masaru.

231
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,330
Oh no!

232
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,250
He has needle wrinkles between his eyes and dented brows on the sides.

233
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,830
His hostile eyes surrounded with a turbid vibe.

234
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,040
And he has a thin lip and small ears on his darkened face.

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,580
He's definitely murderer material!

236
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,660
Moron.

237
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,290
This is a face mask.

238
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,330
You speak Chinese?

239
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,750
I only know one sentence.

240
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,040
That's two already.

241
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
Take it off.

242
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,500
Stuff it in.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,250
Where?

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,830
This is a simultaneous interpreting device.

245
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,250
You two may come down now.

246
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,450
You guys can back off now.

247
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,790
You think these two wimps are capable of doing me harm?

248
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,910
Noda Hiroshi said

249
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,200
you two are genius detectives.

250
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,620
We're just a tad more awesome than he is.

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,830
There's only one week before the trial,

252
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,290
we don't have much time.

253
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,750
Now you can ask me three questions.

254
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,790
How much you gonna pay us?

255
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
One billion yen.

256
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,950
How much is that in RMB?

257
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,080
70 million yuan.

258
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,250
One last question.

259
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,410
When can you pay?

260
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,580
What... what happened that night?

261
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,120
We were about to seal the deal

262
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,160
on the new Chinatown area estate.

263
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,790
But Su Chaiwit

264
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,910
asked me to have one final talk with him.

265
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,290
The meeting took place in

266
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,750
the Watery Hall.

267
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,330
The Watery Hall is surrounded by water.

268
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,450
There's only one corridor that leads to the hall

269
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,040
which makes it hard to ambush, so it's very safe.

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,790
It's been the favorite meeting location of

271
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,750
the gangs in the east.

272
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Due to previous conflicts between us,

273
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,120
that day,

274
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Su Chaiwit came with a large entourage

275
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,750
including his secretary, Kobayashi Anna.

276
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,700
Please have some tea.

277
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Please have some tea.

278
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,830
We started the negotiation after some tea.

279
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,040
The tea was the problem.

280
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,040
It tasted awful?

281
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,660
I started to feel dizzy

282
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,040
after I drank it.

283
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,660
And then?

284
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,330
That's all.

285
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,750
When I woke up,

286
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,750
they were rushing into the room.

287
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,500
I saw my hand bleeding,

288
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,700
and Su Chaiwit had been stabbed.

289
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,910
All of you were there that night?

290
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,040
Tell me what you saw.

291
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,200
Just as what the President said,

292
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,790
after we arrived at the Watery Hall,

293
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,200
President and Su Chaiwit went into the room

294
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,250
and we waited outside.

295
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,750
15 minutes later,

296
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,580
we heard...

297
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,330
we heard a crackling sound.

298
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,250
That means

299
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,290
you didn't go into the room immediately

300
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,830
after the noise?

301
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,870
No.

302
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,040
If we had gone inside sooner,

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,540
things would have turned out differently.

304
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,700
It's all my fault!

305
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,410
I'll cut a finger for it!!

306
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,750
That can wait!

307
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,120
Answer my questions first.

308
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,040
How long did you wait before going into the room?

309
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,790
Around one or two minutes.

310
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,040
And why did you decide to go in?

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,160
Because...

312
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,080
because...

313
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,950
because they heard Su Chaiwit's call for help.

314
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
He's right.

315
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,620
What are you doing!

316
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,410
President!

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,370
President!

318
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,000
President!

319
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,200
So there's only two of them

320
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,330
in the room.

321
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,370
Yes.

322
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,410
The first person who went in

323
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,870
was Su Chaiwit's secretary.

324
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,079
Yes,

325
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,079
it was all my fault

326
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,950
for letting her get ahead of me.

327
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,700
I'm cutting a finger for my fault!

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,410
Answer my questions before you do it!

329
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,000
Not a single one of you

330
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,369
went to the hospital with Su Chaiwit?

331
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,410
All of our attention was on our President.

332
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,250
I'm cutting my finger!

333
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,700
I captured two clips from the CCTV.

334
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,869
One is of them

335
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,910
taking Su Chaiwit out of the Watery Hall.

336
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,540
The other one shows the arrival at the hospital.

337
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,160
He died before they wheeled him into the emergency room.

338
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,700
Enough.

339
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,540
Now that you're clear on what happened that night.

340
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,000
The question is,

341
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,750
will you take this case or not?

342
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,580
Of course yes!

343
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,330
One billon yen,

344
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,250
not one cent less!

345
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Good.

346
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,200
I'm entrusting you with the honor and future of our gang

347
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,080
and of myself.

348
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,660
Within one week,

349
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,080
you have to solve the case.

350
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,200
Otherwise,

351
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,950
I won't let you off.

352
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,080
Neither will they.

353
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
So,

354
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
yes or no?

355
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,870
Yes!

356
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,830
Or not?

357
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,290
This is a locked-room case.

358
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,660
There's Judas Window.

359
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,580
Exactly.

360
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,700
Japan,

361
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,700
locked-room,

362
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,790
the lattice reasoning

363
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,830
and mafia.

364
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
Such a variety of elements,

365
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,290
even a detective novel can't cover all of these.

366
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,750
Yes.

367
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,450
Yes!

368
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,330
My assistant said yes,

369
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,410
so we'll take it!

370
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,790
Deal.

371
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,250
Last question.

372
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
You used up all three questions.

373
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,450
Let's go.

374
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,790
Wait.

375
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,160
You get one free.

376
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,950
Did you

377
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,200
kill him?

378
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
What the hell are you telling about?

379
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,160
I wouldn't have you here

380
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,950
if I killed him.

381
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,370
I would just ask for him.

382
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,500
What do you mean?

383
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,080
Are you insulting me?

384
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,500
I beg your pardon?

385
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,290
I'm telling you

386
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,540
if it weren't for your safety,

387
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,700
I would have given him a taste of my Mo Boxing routine.

388
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,290
This is the last CCTV camera.

389
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,080
Such a natural enclosed space.

390
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,540
And that's what makes it suspicious.

391
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,540
Come on!

392
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,580
Let's go and have a look.

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,450
If the case can't be solved by two of us working as a team.

394
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,870
Then it can't be the work of a human being.

395
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,120
Get a room.

396
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,250
You guys are so close to kissing each other.

397
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,120
Let's go.

398
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,120
Words are but wind,

399
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
but seeing is believing.

400
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,500
What the?

401
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,410
What?

402
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,410
Where is the crime scene?

403
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,450
This is the crime scene.

404
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,790
Where is the shattered screen, the blood trail and the finger prints?

405
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,660
Right! Where is the shattered screen, the blood trail and the finger prints?

406
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,040
They cleaned it up after the police collected the evidence.

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You Japanese people are crazy about cleaning.

408
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,910
There is nothing left.

409
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,120
What are we doing here?

410
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,330
Seeing the photos at the crime scene will give us more inspiration, right?

411
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,040
Any other information that I didn't see?

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,830
I need to keep up with you.

413
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,450
Time for another contest?

414
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,830
Tell me what you found.

415
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,000
The blood splatter

416
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,950
indicates a severed abdominal artery.

417
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,120
The amount of bleeding exceeds 300cc according to my visual inspection.

418
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,000
The nearest hospital

419
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,660
is 25 minutes' drive away.

420
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,450
So death from hemorrhagic shock is plausible.

421
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,290
A completely locked room.

422
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,160
excludes the possibility of a third person entering and leaving the room.

423
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,410
Now let's discuss

424
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,750
these two cups of tea that I can't see.

425
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,040
Both of them contain a high quantity of GHB.

426
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
The only suspect

427
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,370
is the waitress of the night, Yoshimoto Yuki.

428
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,500
She was found dead the next morning having hung herself in her apartment.

429
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,120
Silenced.

430
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,450
How about Su Chaiwit's body?

431
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,500
Residue of GHB found.

432
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,870
How about Watanabe Masaru?

433
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,290
This drug won't stay in the human body for longer than 6 hours.

434
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,580
It was already too late when they considered checking him.

435
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,330
So

436
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,290
he might have lied.

437
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,000
He might have never taken the tea.

438
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,160
The dead tell a more honest story than the living.

439
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,910
According to the theory of Ockham's Razor,

440
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,290
simple reasoning

441
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,830
shouldn't be complicated unnecessarily.

442
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,660
You want to believe the dead

443
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,540
or the living?

444
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,950
Of course the dead

445
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,500
unless he killed himself.

446
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,000
There's only one doubt.

447
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,950
What?

448
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,410
There's splintered glass beneath him

449
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,910
where Su Chaiwit fell down,

450
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,410
which indicates he passed out after the glass screen was shattered.

451
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,830
But there was no broken glass beneath Watanabe Masaru,

452
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,660
that means

453
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,790
he crashed before the glass screen got smashed.

454
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,410
He didn't push the screen down?

455
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,290
How did that happen?

456
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,950
Was there really a third person?

457
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,330
That would be the most reasonable explanation.

458
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,410
But in this particular space,

459
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,290
the presence of a third person is impossible.

460
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,500
Are we having a supernatural talk?

461
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,660
So

462
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,660
that's why you believe Watanabe Masaru?

463
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,000
And his motive for murder.

464
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,540
The development rights for that area were already in his pocket.

465
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,870
What would be his reason to kill?

466
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,580
Stop wringing your brain.

467
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,410
What the mortals can't figure out should be handed to the gods.

468
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,200
The Dowsing Rod gives worldly affairs clarity.

469
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,950
The deity will be the judge when it merges with me.

470
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,830
Go!

471
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,790
I got it!

472
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,870
The killer had been hiding under the table.

473
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,750
How could a man hide in there?

474
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,290
They were not blind.

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,450
Don't you forget

476
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,040
they have a very special profession in Japan called

477
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,450
Ninja.

478
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
The killer must be a ninja.

479
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,370
He slipped the poison in then hid under the table.

480
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,450
After those two passed out,

481
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,080
he smashed the glass screen

482
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,580
and stabbed Su Chaiwit.

483
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,120
Then he planted it on Watanabe Masaru.

484
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,410
Before everyone else entered the room,

485
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,120
he hid himself.

486
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,040
My inference is flawless,

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,540
you should call me a genius!

488
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,790
Maybe the Dowsing Rod wasn't pointing to the table,

489
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,750
but this.

490
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,200
One detail in the photo struck me as rather curious.

491
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,540
This brass ornament fell right next to

492
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,870
Watanabe Masaru's hand.

493
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,000
Before he fainted,

494
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,450
he must have touched it.

495
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,080
Watanabe Masaru.

496
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,040
There are metallic scratches on the oxide layer of the brass piece.

497
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,700
The handling and scratches

498
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,500
point to one possibility only.

499
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,500
It's a hitting weapon.

500
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,330
If I'm correct with my inference,

501
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,080
there should be a blow wound on the left side of Su Chaiwit's head.

502
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,830
That means

503
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,290
Watanabe Masaru lied.

504
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,660
He did try to kill him.

505
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,870
If we give this evidence to the police,

506
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,250
he will be convicted.

507
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,080
It took a lot of effort

508
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,580
to get his medical parole,

509
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,830
this new evidence will send him back under arrest.

510
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,080
Give me that!

511
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,870
Don't you dare forget

512
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,700
who is our boss?

513
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,290
The truth is my boss!

514
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,370
Truth, truth!

515
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,000
One billion yen, man!

516
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,000
You're not the richest man,

517
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,080
one billion doesn't just happen like that.

518
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,910
No matter how much money he offers us,

519
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,910
a murderer stays a murderer.

520
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,120
A, a, a...

521
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,500
Amazing boobs.

522
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,330
Send you off from our little town,

523
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,540
there's a few things that I want to remind you.

524
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,500
You hit me?

525
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,750
Your sympathetic nerves get excited

526
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
resulting in a sudden rush of adrenaline and catecholamine.

527
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,370
Causing the capillaries of certain organs to grow rapidly.

528
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,540
Grow rapidly...certain organs...

529
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,040
Your skin!

530
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
You're blushing!

531
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,580
Did you guys hear the music just now?

532
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,120
It's an old song.

533
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,250
Moron!

534
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,910
This is Kobayashi Anna,

535
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,250
senior assistant to Mr. Su.

536
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,410
You already speak Chinese,

537
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,660
you don't need this.

538
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,370
Miss Kobayashi,

539
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,250
please put this on, it's very handy.

540
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,120
Now our communication has no boundaries.

541
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,790
I'm...

542
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,700
I know who you are.

543
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,450
Really?

544
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,580
Am I that famous? Even in Japan?

545
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,700
Today,

546
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,080
I have the monks pray for the soul

547
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,580
of my master Su Chaiwit.

548
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,830
Over the years I regarded him as my father.

549
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,580
My condolences, Miss Kobayashi.

550
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,330
But if you wanna cry,

551
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,790
cry on my shoulders.

552
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,580
They are yours now.

553
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,200
Allow me to do something for our father.

554
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,620
To help us lock on the culprit as soon as possible,

555
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,120
To help us lock on the culprit as soon as possible,

556
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,160
do you mind if I ask about

557
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,700
what happened that night?

558
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,370
Is that even necessary?

559
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,080
It's Watanabe Masaru who did it!

560
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,370
You look very certain.

561
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,790
There was nobody else in the room that night.

562
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,790
I was the first to run inside after I heard the noise.

563
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,370
President!

564
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,080
Shut up!

565
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,540
Save him first!

566
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,870
Mr. Su Chaiwit.

567
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,580
Mr. Su Chaiwit.

568
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,830
Take him to the hospital,

569
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,830
right now!

570
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,620
And Mr. President told me before he died,

571
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,330
it was Watanabe Masaru who stabbed him.

572
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,330
Hang in there,

573
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,120
Mr. Su Chaiwit.

574
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,950
Masaru Watanabe

575
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,160
Avenge me.

576
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,750
Mr. Su Chaiwit

577
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
Mr. Su Chaiwit

578
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,500
Mr. Tang,

579
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,000
you're the No.1 detective from Chinatown.

580
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,450
Are you going to help this scum walk free from this felony?

581
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,450
Do you know

582
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,620
what he did to me that night?

583
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,540
He did an abomination other than killing a man?

584
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,000
That night...

585
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,410
Such a beautiful secretary.

586
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,080
How much does Mr. Su pay you?

587
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,330
Come work for me, I'll double the paycheck.

588
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,660
Kobayashi,

589
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,290
it seems like Mr. Watanabe really likes you.

590
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,870
Leave us for now.

591
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,250
Bastard.

592
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,830
He's worse then a beast!

593
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,330
Yet you're helping him.

594
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,330
You don't see anything but money, do you?

595
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,040
Who told you I do it for the money?

596
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,700
I was only pretending to accept his bribe,

597
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,950
so that I could infiltrate the enemy.

598
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,910
And

599
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,950
after all the humiliation I went through,

600
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,330
I just found

601
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,620
evidence overlooked by the police.

602
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,870
What is this?

603
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,160
We've checked that

604
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,410
Watanabe Masaru

605
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,660
must have attacked Su Chaiwit with this.

606
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,330
If we can find the wound on Su Chaiwit's head,

607
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,660
then Watanabe's intention to kill will be confirmed.

608
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,790
Jack Jaa!

609
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,580
Thank you.

610
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,830
Thank you.

611
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Thank you.

612
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,870
Such important evidence should be handled by the police.

613
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,330
Tanaka Naoki,

614
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,370
the youngest Senior Superintendent in Japan's history.

615
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,410
He has maintained a 100% case clear-up rate.

616
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,660
People call him the police prodigy.

617
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,620
Sorry.

618
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,410
Thank you for getting this new evidence for me.

619
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,870
Watanabe will not get away this time.

620
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,700
Thai detective.

621
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,330
Japanese detective.

622
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,830
Chinese detective.

623
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,120
Impressive.

624
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,750
Yet Crimaster is only for kids

625
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,410
who fancy detective novels and movies.

626
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm the law here.

627
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,250
And let me remind you,

628
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,410
don't ever show up

629
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,000
where you shouldn't be,

630
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,500
or I will arrest you.

631
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Is that clear?

632
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,160
Let's go.

633
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,950
You're absolutely about to fail,

634
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,580
but you still stand by the Japanese?

635
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,750
What do you mean?

636
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,200
Watanabe would not be easy on you guys

637
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,120
if he know the new evidence was handed to the police.

638
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,660
But if you guys work with us,

639
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,500
I will make sure you can go back to China alive.

640
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,580
Are you going to betray us?

641
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,160
It's not like we are going to lose.

642
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,290
So pick one side!

643
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,290
It's me who bought your flights.

644
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,830
Can I choose both?

645
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,950
No need!

646
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,700
If we lose, so be it.

647
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,910
Fine! I'll see...

648
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,870
...how Watanabe is going to kill you guys.

649
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,410
Remember my heart, remember my love for you.

650
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,250
Remember I'll be waiting for you every single day.

651
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,330
The old song is on again?

652
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,410
So you heard that too?

653
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,660
Moron.

654
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,410
What do we do now?

655
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,790
Will Watanabe flip on us?

656
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,250
From what I know,

657
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,950
he will.

658
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,250
You got two options:

659
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,500
either hit the road now

660
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,620
or solve the case soon.

661
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,330
What the living doesn't tell us,

662
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,500
let's consult the dead.

663
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,540
This time,

664
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,080
please don't put me in the nurse costume again.

665
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Dressing up like a woman really messed with my hormones.

666
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,120
You play the corpse this time.

667
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,200
Why aren't you playing the corpse?

668
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,040
Do you know how to conduct an autopsy?

669
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,700
Reiko, you scared me.

670
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,950
How do you work here with such timidity?

671
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,250
Movies are all fiction, zombies don't exist at all.

672
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,250
Some of them might come pay you a visit tonight.

673
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,620
Great.

674
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,450
Life is so boring now.

675
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,620
We're here.

676
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,000
You are?

677
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,370
Delivery.

678
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,000
So ugly.

679
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,700
Have you ever seen any attractive dead body?

680
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,290
The elevator's acting weird recently,

681
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,000
just be careful.

682
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,200
Okay.

683
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,620
I almost died from suffocation.

684
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,620
Is the new autopsy report out?

685
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,040
Here, Officer Tanaka.

686
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,910
Exactly as I predicted.

687
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,040
There is a wound on the left back side of Su Chaiwit's head.

688
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,950
Now we can request the arrest warrant again.

689
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,040
Yes, sir.

690
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,870
Anything unusual?

691
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,330
No, sir.

692
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,040
Show me the morgue.

693
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,750
Yes, sir.

694
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,500
This way please.

695
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,660
What do I do now?

696
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,790
Are you trying to kill me?

697
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,700
But I'm your uncle, by blood!

698
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,830
You gonna kill me?

699
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,450
I'm your biological uncle!

700
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,080
Let's find Su Chaiwit's body.

701
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,450
I want to check by myself.

702
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,290
Got it!

703
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,199
Let's check somewhere else.

704
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,080
Got it!

705
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,250
Why is the President lighter?

706
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,370
Of couse corpse becomes lighter.

707
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,409
You idiot!

708
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,700
What are you doing?

709
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,200
What is that!

710
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,250
Find the body and burn it,

711
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,660
so there's no evidence for the Southeast Chamber.

712
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,500
Mr. President would be very touched by us.

713
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,700
Mr. President would be very touched by us.

714
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,410
Be brave when we get into the morgue,

715
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,200
there is nothing to be scared of.

716
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,790
Roger.

717
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,750
Please.

718
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,200
After you.

719
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,330
You go first.

720
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,410
No, you go first.

721
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,410
Please.

722
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,700
Not this one.

723
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,290
Here it is.

724
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,370
This one.

725
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,120
Great.

726
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,160
Why is Su Chaiwit so light?

727
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,500
Dead bodies are always lighter. Dumbass.

728
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,200
Please.

729
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,410
Please.

730
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,540
Please.

731
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,790
Come in please.

732
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,950
Where is Tang Ren?

733
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,750
Don't mind him,

734
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,830
Su Chaiwit is our priority.

735
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,500
Why is it going up?

736
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,620
Two cowards.

737
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,500
What again?

738
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,790
Be careful.

739
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,620
You!

740
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,120
You!

741
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,700
You!

742
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,120
You guys!

743
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,950
What's that?

744
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,040
Get them!

745
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,000
Quickly! Get them!

746
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,080
The mild edema on the left back side of the skull was caused by a blow to the head.

747
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,540
Vital reaction not obvious

748
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,450
which means the wound was created not long before his death.

749
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,330
Radius of the wound is 3.5cm,

750
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,830
which matches the size of the brass ornament.

751
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,410
The lethal injury was done with a cone-shaped object.

752
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,250
The uneven surface matches the glass

753
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,870
object left by Watanabe

754
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,080
at the crime scene.

755
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,950
Autopsy report shows that

756
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,000
the glass pieces left inside the victim's body

757
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,750
are identical to the shattered screen.

758
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,000
It looks like Watanabe is the murderer.

759
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,950
Only one thing left.

760
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,160
There are two ways of handling the weapon when stabbing someone:

761
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,500
holding it with the palm, or the hypothenar muscles of the hand.

762
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,500
Watanabe Masaru is 1.75 meters,

763
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,950
whereas Su Chaiwit is 1.8 meters.

764
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,500
If he struck from the front using the palm,

765
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,370
then the wound should be on the left side of the underbelly.

766
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:35,250
But the injury is on his right side,

767
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,000
so he must have been holding the blade against the hypothenar muscles

768
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,200
and stabbed from the back.

769
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,290
The way Watanabe handled the weapon

770
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,290
is the key now.

771
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,580
Kobayashi, who ran into the room first

772
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,830
must have witnessed it.

773
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,080
Have you noticed

774
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,540
the pinhole in his vein?

775
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:56,620
Yes. His medical report doesn't mention recent injections though.

776
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,200
Well, there's only one person who can answer all these questions.

777
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,450
Kobayashi Anna.

778
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,120
Last night,

779
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,250
Watanabe Masaru, the head of the biggest mafia in the East, Black Dragon,

780
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,580
was arrested again.

781
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,250
Okay, I see.

782
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,160
The Black Dragon has issued an order to hunt you guys down.

783
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,910
This is getting messy.

784
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,290
Are you aware of the trouble you get us in?

785
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,700
Say one more word and I will kill myself.

786
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,540
And you will lose your uncle forever!

787
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,910
Aren't you from the extended family?

788
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,830
If we want to leave Japan safely,

789
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,330
we need to crack the case.

790
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,450
Miss Kobayashi lives in such a cute apartment.

791
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,040
Would you like her to be your aunt?

792
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,540
If she's willing to take Chinese citizenship,

793
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,580
I might consider marrying her.

794
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,370
Miss Kobayashi, I'm coming.

795
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,540
Why is the door unlocked?

796
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,790
Miss Kobayashi, are you taking a shower?

797
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,910
I'm coming in.

798
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Miss Kobayashi.

799
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,080
Don't bother.

800
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,080
Kobayashi

801
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,370
has been kidnapped.

802
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,500
What?

803
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,330
That's right.

804
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:08,120
She's been gassed unconscious then dragged out.

805
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
What's going to happen to my Kobayashi?

806
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,370
You again?

807
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,330
Are you trying to sabotage our investigation

808
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,750
by hiding Miss Kobayashi?

809
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,040
It must be this Japanese.

810
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,330
He kidnapped Kobayashi for Watanabe!

811
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,160
We will never do this despicable shits.

812
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,250
So it's you.

813
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,910
Are you insane?

814
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,000
It must be Watanabe!

815
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,540
He wants to silence the witness.

816
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,040
It's definitely not him,

817
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,120
the police arrested him last night.

818
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,830
Cut the crap. Give my Kobayashi back!

819
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,000
Get your dirty paws off me,

820
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,080
you haven't showered for days.

821
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
How do you know that?

822
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,910
You call yourself a man looking like this?

823
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,500
What's wrong with being handsome?

824
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,700
You should take care of your skin.

825
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,660
Sissy,

826
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,910
you never understand a man should look like this.

827
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,330
Not you! You crazy!

828
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,620
How dare you two brag about masculinity in front of me?

829
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,910
Alright,

830
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,120
stop fighting!

831
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,500
The pinhole on Su Chaiwit

832
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,750
and the way Watanabe held the weapon,

833
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,500
only Kobayashi owns the key to the truth.

834
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,580
And the key to my heart.

835
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,700
To know the truth,

836
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,250
we must find Kobayashi Anna first.

837
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,620
Now,

838
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,250
we share the same goal.

839
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,500
That gives us zero information.

840
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,330
Car plate.

841
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,830
Call the police.

842
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,370
Tanaka will have us arrested.

843
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,330
I'll beat you up if you snatch the phone!

844
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,000
And I don't practice Mo Boxing for nothing.

845
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,290
Stop it.

846
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,160
I found the car owner.

847
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,500
A man wanted by the police,

848
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,700
Murata Akira.

849
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,040
Murata Akira.

850
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,620
Rapist-murderer.

851
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,250
That serial rapist-murderer.

852
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,160
What?

853
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,410
Rapist-murderer?

854
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,000
My Kobayashi...

855
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:01,450
No...

856
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,790
I've located his den.

857
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,870
It can't be that simple.

858
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,700
Let's save the hostage first.

859
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,500
Go!

860
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,910
This indeed looks like the den of a pervert.

861
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,120
Kobayashi's safety is our top priority.

862
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,500
Keep the twaddle to yourself.

863
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,410
Watch out, folks.

864
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,080
Better hide behind my back, you guys.

865
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,200
Easy, easy.

866
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,080
Qin, help me!

867
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,750
3 poor people, 2 loaves of bread, show fairness and justice with 1 cut.

868
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:36,370
3 poor people, 2 loaves of bread, show fairness and justice with 1 cut.

869
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:37,870
3 poor people, 2 loaves of bread, show fairness and justice with 1 cut.

870
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,160
Easy!

871
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,330
Wrong answer. 2 chance left.

872
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,580
The world doesn't suffer from scarcity but from inequality.

873
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,330
Wrong answer. 1 chance left.

874
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,000
Let me do it.

875
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,870
Qin, you killed the man.

876
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,000
Correct.

877
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,450
Justice and equality

878
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,660
demand sacrifices.

879
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,370
Game starts.

880
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,000
See Kobayashi after 3 passes.

881
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,620
You understand it?

882
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,370
I only curse because I don't understand it.

883
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,450
What does it mean?

884
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,950
The game has just begun.

885
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,910
Games?

886
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:31,830
This is turning into a game now?

887
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,080
Aren't we here on a rescue mission?

888
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,160
Shut up.

889
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,910
Tomorrow, 10 am,

890
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,120
if you want to save Kobayashi, each of you must

891
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,450
bring 100 million yen to the Cosplay Carnival at Akihabara.

892
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:52,750
She will be killed

893
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,370
if you call the police.

894
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,620
Three detectives?

895
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,540
He didn't count you in?

896
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,950
Or you?

897
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,580
His motive is money?

898
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,290
His motive can't be this simple.

899
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,000
Now that we don't have other clues,

900
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,250
we can only follow his order.

901
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,870
How about the money?

902
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:11,290
Who can get three hundred million yen within one night?

903
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,290
This late? Banks are closed now.

904
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,620
Don't you own Tokyo?

905
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,330
Total bullshit!

906
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,870
I can say Japan belongs to me.

907
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,040
Sawatdee krab.

908
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,790
You will know!

909
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,250
There's a spot.

910
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,000
This group.

911
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:28,750
Faster!

912
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,330
Faster! Faster!

913
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,830
You go that way!

914
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,950
Master,

915
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:57,160
we have summoned thousands of our employees to withdraw cash.

916
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,330
But it's still not enough.

917
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,450
Then get more people on it.

918
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,080
It's already 12 o'clock,

919
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,700
ask all of them to withdraw again.

920
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,830
Roger.

921
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,750
I didn't find you too handsome until today.

922
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,200
Shameless!

923
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,660
Need a bodyguard?

924
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,620
You guys are all wet.

925
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,830
Let me take you to get changed.

926
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,200
So handsome!

927
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,950
I can't take it anymore.

928
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,750
Sorry.

929
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,450
You can go in.

930
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,370
Back up!

931
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,160
Shit!

932
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,660
We can't get in the carnival without costumes.

933
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,580
This way.

934
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,330
Which one should I pick?

935
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,540
It's so hard to choose with so many options.

936
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,330
You've been waiting for this day, haven't you?

937
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,040
It all looks so sissy.

938
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,370
How would I wear it?

939
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,750
You will look good in this.

940
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,290
I swear on my grandfather's name.

941
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,580
These are all Japanese characters.

942
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,830
These are quintessential to our culture,

943
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,370
do you have any?

944
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,660
Qin,

945
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,500
we have to strive for the honor of our country.

946
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,580
What exactly are we looking for?

947
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,870
We're looking for Kobayashi.

948
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,620
And how do we do that without a single hint?

949
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,750
No hint?

950
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,120
The hint is in front of you.

951
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:07,910
What is it?

952
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,370
A puzzle.

953
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,450
Think about the people you pass by...

954
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,830
One chance only.

955
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,620
Can we get out of these costumes first?

956
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,040
This is too...

957
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,750
Who is calling?

958
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,660
The phone is from inside.

959
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,620
He's asked us to fill in three numbers

960
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,790
before he hangs up.

961
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,620
The numbers we've seen.

962
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,200
Who's had number on them before?

963
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,330
3

964
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,290
6

965
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,660
The last one?

966
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,040
Stop that!

967
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,120
I don't know!

968
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,040
I do!

969
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,910
D

970
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:06,870
36D

971
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,790
Isn't it obvious?

972
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:19,950
He's asked us to get to the temple

973
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,120
in Harajuku.

974
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,910
My instruction is to go to Ebisu.

975
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,330
I'm heading to Budokan.

976
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,370
How can we make it?

977
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,500
We have to make it.

978
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:26,910
Qin, wait for me.

979
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,410
How do we get there?

980
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,160
We might have a chance if we go underground.

981
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,410
Underground?

982
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,160
I can't breath.

983
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,910
Can't breath.

984
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,000
You want to save Miss Kobayashi or not?

985
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,120
Miss Kobayashi!

986
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:13,870
Here!

987
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,500
Help!

988
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,700
Stop, you bastard!

989
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,830
Stop there!

990
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,200
Give my girl back!

991
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,620
What is Noda Hiroshi doing there? He's not moving at all.

992
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,910
He's moving!

993
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,700
And he's moving so fast. Is he flying?

994
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,950
I'm the king of Tokyo!

995
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,620
Cheating.

996
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,660
You lose!

997
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,870
What?

998
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,290
Look!

999
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,500
Noda's red dot disappeared.

1000
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,450
Did he crash?

1001
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,790
Leave him alone! Just run!

1002
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,080
Stop there!

1003
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,250
Stop!

1004
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:44,870
Come back!

1005
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,580
This one is it!

1006
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,330
This is your choice.

1007
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,200
You take care of it.

1008
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,040
But I chose the thin white leg.

1009
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,040
It is pretty white,

1010
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,290
just a bit thick.

1011
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,620
You don't want to save Miss Kobayashi?

1012
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,000
I do.

1013
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,700
But I don't want to die either.

1014
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,160
Death befalls all men alike.

1015
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,370
It may be weightier than Mount Tai,

1016
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,950
or lighter than a feather.

1017
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,910
He is Mount Tai no doubt.

1018
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,790
And I am a feather for sure.

1019
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,250
Tang!

1020
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,000
Remember that old song?

1021
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,870
Wild flowers on the road...

1022
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:44,950
Not this one.

1023
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,370
You're right.

1024
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,000
The Great Wall

1025
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,750
will never fall.

1026
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,910
I will beat you at any cost!

1027
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,120
Call the ambulance, please!

1028
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,580
Tang!

1029
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,370
Tang!

1030
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,700
Any last words?

1031
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,870
Tell me.

1032
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
Qin,

1033
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,160
please take good care of Miss Kobayashi,

1034
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,830
Ah Xiang in Thailand,

1035
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,950
and Ying Ying in America.

1036
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,000
How can I take care of

1037
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,580
so many aunts?

1038
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,500
I'm your uncle!

1039
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,950
By blood!

1040
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:37,750
Extended.

1041
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,580
The blood is real!

1042
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,750
Enough.

1043
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,540
Drop the act.

1044
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:44,620
I found his weakness.

1045
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,580
You wanna beat him?

1046
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:46,950
You're not kidding?

1047
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,120
When you guys were fighting,

1048
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,450
I noticed that

1049
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:50,910
the callous on his right foot is thicker than the left.

1050
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,250
It's resulted from years of putting his weight on the right leg,

1051
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,250
so his left foot must suffer from a prolonged injury.

1052
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,290
Besides, the skin tone of his left ankle

1053
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,580
is much lighter than the rest of his body

1054
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,200
due to bandaging.

1055
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,330
So his weakness

1056
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:59,830
is his left ankle.

1057
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,290
To topple a mansion,

1058
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,700
aim at the frailest beam.

1059
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,750
Got it!

1060
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,160
Nezha explores the sea.

1061
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,040
Dividing the wild horse's mane.

1062
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,000
Immortal points direction.

1063
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,580
Monkey steals peach.

1064
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,660
White python screws.

1065
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,160
Mountain Tai

1066
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:30,790
on top.

1067
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,830
Stop it!

1068
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,540
Qin,

1069
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,410
did you learn all these tricks

1070
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,160
from action films?

1071
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,120
Jack Jaa is out.

1072
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,700
Congratulations on passing this test.

1073
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,080
How much longer do you want to play?

1074
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,790
The ultimate test

1075
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,000
is in 10 minutes,

1076
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,160
Shibuya,

1077
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,540
Hachi Ko.

1078
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,750
What is the ultimate test?

1079
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,370
What do you see?

1080
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:08,750
People.

1081
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,620
A lot of people.

1082
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,330
That's right.

1083
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,250
This is the busiest crossroad in the world.

1084
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,540
I would like to know

1085
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,120
how many people pass the crossway

1086
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,910
when the traffic lights' up.

1087
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:19,660
So?

1088
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,540
So

1089
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,700
Xiao Feng,

1090
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,910
let's do what we always do:

1091
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:25,370
help daddy count how many people are there.

1092
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,000
Who are you?

1093
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,000
Who on earth are you?

1094
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,830
Do you want to know who I am

1095
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,790
or where Kobayashi is?

1096
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,160
This is your ultimate challenge.

1097
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,910
3

1098
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:45,910
2

1099
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,080
1

1100
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,120
Start.

1101
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,700
What did he ask us to do?

1102
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,700
Count people!

1103
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,000
Quickly,

1104
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,120
lend me your shoulders.

1105
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,120
Count people?

1106
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,200
Such a sick request.

1107
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,040
Steady.

1108
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,200
We need to stay still like this?

1109
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:19,910
Yes.

1110
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,500
Lucky that I've been training since I was little.

1111
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,250
First attempt failed.

1112
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,750
You get two more chances.

1113
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,370
Keep going.

1114
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,370
It's about to start again.

1115
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,410
3,789

1116
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,410
Wrong!

1117
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,450
This is human nature.

1118
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:24,450
Regulations can never control human nature.

1119
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:27,500
Qin Feng, you have one last chance.

1120
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,040
Get ready to collect the corpse.

1121
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,330
This sick bastard is not coming for money,

1122
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,950
he just wants to torture us.

1123
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,040
Let's go!

1124
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,000
Qin! What are you doing?

1125
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:01,830
There is all real money!

1126
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,000
Trust me if you want to save Kobayashi.

1127
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,080
Join me!

1128
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,370
The answer is

1129
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,200
zero.

1130
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,620
Are we wrong again?

1131
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,080
No,

1132
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,330
we got it right this time.

1133
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:59,660
Who am I?

1134
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,200
Who am I? Where am I?

1135
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,410
What journey did I put you through?

1136
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,250
Another puzzle.

1137
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,040
Miss Kobayashi, where are you?

1138
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,700
Zero or O?

1139
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,750
Did you count the distance we've traveled

1140
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,540
since we left from Noda's house?

1141
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,910
Q.

1142
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,910
Q

1143
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:42,910
The Queen?

1144
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,790
All of this is related to the Queen?

1145
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,370
Qin, let's go, hurry up.

1146
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,290
Noda,

1147
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,160
help me find Tokyo locations

1148
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,540
with Q in their names.

1149
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,910
Kobayashi is in that place.

1150
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:54,950
Wait a second.

1151
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,620
In Tokyo,

1152
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,950
there is only one place that has Q in its name.

1153
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,700
The Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel.

1154
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:04,790
Dragon Q Palace.

1155
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:34,000
Why are you holding my hand?

1156
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:34,870
Qin,

1157
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,580
don't be scared.

1158
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:37,830
I'm not scared.

1159
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,910
I'm afraid that you might be scared.

1160
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,000
I'm not scared, you are.

1161
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:44,120
I'm afraid that you get scared. That's what I'm afraid of.

1162
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,120
Enough with the afraid stuff and let go of me.

1163
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,120
You're grossing me out with your sweaty hand.

1164
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,700
Help!

1165
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,700
Help!

1166
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,790
Help!

1167
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,040
Help!

1168
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:40,910
Miss Kobayashi.

1169
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,410
Tang Ren!

1170
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,200
Save me!

1171
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,500
I'm coming!

1172
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:51,080
Tang Ren!

1173
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,750
Save me!

1174
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,750
Who are you?

1175
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,120
And why do you know me?

1176
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,370
What exactly do you want?

1177
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:39,160
Easy with your questions.

1178
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,200
First of all,

1179
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,910
there's one last choice to make.

1180
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,290
What choice?

1181
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,200
Tang Ren! Save me!

1182
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,330
I'm here!

1183
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,160
Miss Kobayashi.

1184
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,120
Help!

1185
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,290
Qin!

1186
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,660
Tang!

1187
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:59,790
Tang!

1188
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,000
Qin!

1189
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,200
Qin!

1190
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,410
Miss Kobayashi.

1191
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,370
This is your choice to make.

1192
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:59,250
The valve of the well is wired to my heart pacemaker.

1193
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,580
The water won't stop until I die.

1194
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,700
To save Kobayashi, you will have to kill me.

1195
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,000
Maniac!

1196
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,830
Why would I kill you?

1197
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,750
I'm a death-row convict.

1198
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:21,080
It's time for you to execute justice.

1199
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,200
I don't have the right to perform justice!

1200
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,290
No?

1201
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,950
You are qualified to do so.

1202
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:30,410
It's much easier than committing a perfect crime, isn't it?

1203
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,330
Stop hesitating, Qin Feng.

1204
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,410
Just a gentle push,

1205
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:53,870
you can save the innocent woman down there.

1206
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:57,370
And I am a condemned sinner who's supposed to die anyway.

1207
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:06,040
Now you have two lives in your hand.

1208
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,910
Qin Feng, don't you feel like God?

1209
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:20,700
Qin!

1210
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,450
Qin!

1211
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:30,000
Don't hesitate, Qin Feng!

1212
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,660
Make your choice!

1213
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,040
Qin!

1214
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,700
Feeling so quiet

1215
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,040
This time

1216
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,250
Drift Into the darkness

1217
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,540
Let me be endless

1218
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:21,040
Goodbye

1219
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,580
End of my old life

1220
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:28,250
No one is luckless

1221
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,040
When comes the fairness

1222
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,290
Through the dark a world is waiting

1223
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:39,620
Through where no one's ever looking

1224
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:44,830
A place that will be called my own

1225
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:50,120
So trade that typical for something

1226
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,830
New and colorful like you say

1227
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:58,620
Everything will not be the same

1228
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,620
Qin Feng,

1229
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,660
you are under arrest and charged with murder.

1230
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:24,870
Qin,

1231
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:25,870
Qin.

1232
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,700
He said he didn't kill anyone.

1233
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,120
Why are you arresting him?

1234
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,950
You wouldn't have saved Kobayashi without him.

1235
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:36,700
Everyone saw him pushing the victim down!

1236
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:39,120
Killing is not saving.

1237
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:41,660
Social butterfly!

1238
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,790
Do something!

1239
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,540
Think of something!

1240
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,000
Sorry, there's nothing I can do.

1241
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,580
How come there's nothing you can do?

1242
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,120
Aren't you the king of Tokyo?

1243
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,200
Don't forget that he's here for you.

1244
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,660
He came here for the case.

1245
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,410
Whereas you came for the money.

1246
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:58,000
I already told you.

1247
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,540
Never help the Japanese.

1248
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,250
Please help him then.

1249
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:01,910
Help Qin!

1250
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,660
But you never listen to me.

1251
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:11,290
You double-crossing bastards.

1252
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,200
You think I can't get things done without you?

1253
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,040
Without you,

1254
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I'll save Qin by myself!

1255
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,950
What's with the pinhole on Su Chaiwit's arm?

1256
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,330
I don't know.

1257
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,790
Your mind is still on cracking the case?

1258
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,700
You must remember how Watanabe Masaru was holding the weapon

1259
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,700
when you saw him.

1260
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,250
Was it like this,

1261
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,870
or this?

1262
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,200
Like this, I think.

1263
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,200
Okay.

1264
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:57,450
I see.

1265
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,200
Let's go.

1266
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,000
By the way,

1267
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,200
your Chinese is good.

1268
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,120
Qin, I'm gonna get you out.

1269
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,580
How did it go?

1270
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,540
Parole denied due to the gravity of the case.

1271
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,620
Aren't you rich?

1272
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,160
Just buy out the procuratorate.

1273
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,540
It's not up to me.

1274
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,160
Kawamura Yoshiko is the prosecutor.

1275
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,330
If she thinks Qin Feng is fine, then he will be fine.

1276
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:38,450
Excellent!

1277
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:41,000
Everyone knows that I'm popular among middle-aged women.

1278
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:43,410
Time for me to sacrifice my body in exchange for Qin.

1279
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,660
Come on! Introduce me!

1280
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:47,830
Why are you stopping me?

1281
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:48,950
Calm down.

1282
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:50,250
How can I calm down?

1283
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,950
You should go back to Bangkok and lie low.

1284
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:52,950
The Black Dragon is after you now.

1285
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,000
You're not safe here in Japan.

1286
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:56,000
I can't just leave Qin here.

1287
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:58,660
But you can't help much here.

1288
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,200
What's this?

1289
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:03,410
A boat ticket.

1290
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:06,250
You will get caught if you take the plane.

1291
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:06,910
Boat?

1292
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,160
What about your private jets?

1293
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,410
There aren't that many of them.

1294
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:12,450
And they're preoccupied with other tasks.

1295
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:14,540
A car has been arranged for you to leave now.

1296
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,700
Where is the car?

1297
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:18,870
Here!

1298
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,080
Where's the boat?

1299
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,330
There are so many of them.

1300
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:46,040
I mean the boat that is supposed to take me back to Thailand.

1301
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,450
The luxury liner!

1302
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,620
That one.

1303
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:52,040
Noda Hiroshi you piece of shit!

1304
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,040
This shitty boat doesn't even require a ticket.

1305
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,160
Welcome.

1306
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,580
This way.

1307
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:08,250
Follow me.

1308
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,580
Follow me.

1309
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,620
No more hesitation, Qin Feng!

1310
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,870
Make you choice!

1311
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,160
Qin!

1312
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,000
Q says hi.

1313
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:25,290
Are we admitting defeat?

1314
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:28,580
Even so,

1315
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,500
we still have to find out the truth, don't we?

1316
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:32,410
Locked rooms,

1317
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,700
the ultimate subject that every detective authors wants to explore.

1318
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,370
As one of the Three Tycoons of the Golden Era,

1319
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,330
John Dickson Carr,

1320
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,450
in his work The Lecture of Locked Rooms.

1321
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:41,330
divides the locked-room cases into 13 categories.

1322
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,700
This means

1323
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,790
our case must fall into one of them.

1324
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,160
Category one,

1325
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,000
it's not really a murder

1326
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:51,000
but the unfortunate outcome of a series of uncanny coincidences.

1327
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:51,910
Category two,

1328
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:54,500
the room is equipped with a secret device that kills.

1329
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,250
Category three,

1330
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,500
the murderer uses animals or plants to kill.

1331
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:58,120
Category four and Category five,

1332
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,910
people enter the locked-room while

1333
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:59,750
the murderer hides behind the door.

1334
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,410
Category eight and Category nine,

1335
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,910
the murderer stabs the victim somewhere outside the room.

1336
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:02,830
In order to hide from the murderer's chase,

1337
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,040
Our case

1338
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,580
is narrowed down to three possibilities.

1339
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:06,000
One,

1340
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:07,580
the Sham Cham.

1341
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:09,200
The murderer operates in a seemingly enclosed chamber

1342
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,500
which actually has a secret passage for an escape.

1343
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,250
The locked-room doesn't have any air vent,

1344
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,040
secret tunnel

1345
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,120
or trapdoor.

1346
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,330
Besides, the place was surrounded by gangs

1347
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,950
so nobody could enter or exit the room.

1348
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:21,870
Two,

1349
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,160
Room With a Device.

1350
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:23,950
The murderer stays in the room and

1351
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:26,200
launches an attack with a remote-controlled device.

1352
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,660
There was no trace of any device at the crime scene,

1353
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,450
and within a sealed space

1354
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:31,450
it would be impossible to operation one.

1355
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,040
Device nonexistent.

1356
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,160
Category two ruled out.

1357
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,870
Three,

1358
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,370
the Hidden Killer.

1359
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:40,080
Like Tang Ren's case in Thailand,

1360
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,040
the murderer didn't leave the scene after the crime

1361
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,040
but stashed himself in the room

1362
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,040
and waited till the alert was lifted.

1363
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,580
In our scene there, was no furniture for hiding.

1364
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,370
No place to hide.

1365
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:50,870
Category three ruled out.

1366
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:51,660
With all the possibilities excluded,

1367
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,040
Watanabe has to be the culprit.

1368
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,540
But there is still no explanation

1369
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,450
for the lack of broken glass beneath his body.

1370
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,660
If the screen was smashed after Watanabe was down,

1371
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,160
then it's the real murderer who did this.

1372
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,040
Only Watanabe Masaru and Su Chaiwit were in the room.

1373
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,750
Su Chaiwit couldn't have stabbed himself.

1374
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,950
Is there a 14th category?

1375
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:04,870
Wait.

1376
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:07,500
What did you say?

1377
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:09,660
That Su Chaiwit couldn't have stabbed himself.

1378
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,290
You.

1379
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,040
Such a time of mistrust.

1380
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:58,790
The detective who decodes locked-rooms is now trapped in one.

1381
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,540
Isn't that ironic, Qin Feng?

1382
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,750
Murata Akira was just a puppet.

1383
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,580
You're the one pulling the strings.

1384
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:08,410
We finally meet,

1385
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:09,580
Q.

1386
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:09,580
Q

1387
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,330
Why do you say so?

1388
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,330
Before we came to Japan,

1389
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,580
everything seemed to be manipulated

1390
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,540
by a pair of invisible hands.

1391
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,410
Three hours after we received Noda's invitation,

1392
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,450
Q posted the case on Crimaster.

1393
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:24,000
It can't be a coincidence.

1394
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:26,080
It was Q's plan all along.

1395
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,330
Including

1396
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:28,660
putting me in jail.

1397
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,040
But this is not the purpose,

1398
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,120
I knew he would come to see me.

1399
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:34,620
Hence,

1400
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,450
whoever shows up first

1401
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:39,330
should be

1402
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,160
Q.

1403
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,160
Q

1404
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:52,870
We were right about you.

1405
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:53,910
You guys?

1406
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:57,700
Of course, Q is not one individual.

1407
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:01,040
He is the best of the best, the elite selected from millions of people.

1408
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,330
Congratulations

1409
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,000
on passing the test,

1410
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,450
on becoming one of us.

1411
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:10,540
Test?

1412
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:18,160
First round, recognition.

1413
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,750
Second round, capability.

1414
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,910
Third round, methods.

1415
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,700
Last round, epiphany.

1416
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,250
The answer is

1417
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:30,660
zero.

1418
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:32,000
If these are all tests,

1419
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:33,910
what about the case of Watanabe?

1420
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:36,290
A coincidence

1421
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:40,330
that we borrowed to conduct our test on you.

1422
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,120
Including framing me?

1423
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,000
This is not framing you,

1424
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:48,620
but showing you the human chaos.

1425
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,950
And the vacuity of law.

1426
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,870
To enlighten me on your philosophy,

1427
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,200
you

1428
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,160
killed a guy.

1429
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,450
Murata Akira?

1430
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:08,870
His life was worthless.

1431
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:13,580
A Wanted Order was the only evidence of his existence.

1432
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,250
In his last moment,

1433
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,410
I granted a shred of meaning to his life.

1434
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:25,040
He would be grateful.

1435
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,250
So,

1436
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:30,660
Q,

1437
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:30,660
Q

1438
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:33,040
what exactly do you want?

1439
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:40,040
Human history

1440
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,580
is never written by the witless crowd.

1441
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:47,750
It's always been the elites who control the progress of civilizations.

1442
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,120
In the ancient past, they were deemed as gods.

1443
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:01,700
The world was a land of bliss governed by the deities.

1444
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:05,410
In order to let the world get back on track,

1445
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:08,830
humans need new gods.

1446
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,700
Do you understand?

1447
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:21,450
That's when Q emerged.

1448
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,370
Qin Feng,

1449
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:30,040
you've been pursuing the perfect crime

1450
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,290
without knowing that perfect crimes are taking place every moment.

1451
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,330
Those old aristocrats and modern plutocrats,

1452
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:40,160
all bear the orginal sin.

1453
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:44,410
Yet they all end up being worshipped and revered.

1454
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,750
Do you understand?

1455
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,660
That, is the perfect crime.

1456
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:55,040
Qin Feng, join Q.

1457
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,950
In putting the world on trial.

1458
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,500
Compared to Q's power,

1459
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,700
you will never beat us.

1460
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,290
You have your people,

1461
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,540
I have mine too.

1462
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,580
You?

1463
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:21,200
Us.

1464
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,870
My baby apprentice.

1465
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,700
No time for weeping.

1466
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,500
Kiko wants you to meet someone.

1467
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:40,160
Who?

1468
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,120
Like you?

1469
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,200
I didn't know you could drive.

1470
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,330
Buckle up.

1471
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:45,410
We're in a hurry.

1472
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,500
I have seen it all,

1473
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,000
your shabby little car doesn't faze me.

1474
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,000
Go inside.

1475
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,250
The one is inside waiting for you.

1476
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Uncle.

1477
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,910
You guys? Who?

1478
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,750
Tang Ren who fled back to Thailand?

1479
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,450
Noda Hiroshi who can't be trusted?

1480
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,870
Or the puffed-chest and brainless Jack Jaa?

1481
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,200
Qin Feng,

1482
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:58,000
all you have is us, not you.

1483
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:02,160
Don't hesitate and don't waste your gift.

1484
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:08,080
A murderer can be sentenced to death in Japan.

1485
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:14,250
So Qin Feng didn't kill the guy.

1486
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,700
Of course not.

1487
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,540
Such a pity.

1488
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,830
What pity?

1489
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:23,750
I always believed he had the talent to kill.

1490
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:26,250
Does killing require talent?

1491
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,120
Anything in the world we call art

1492
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,290
demands talent.

1493
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,580
So genius,

1494
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:36,040
help Qin.

1495
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:39,950
Lord,

1496
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,370
please pardon his sins,

1497
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:44,160
save his soul,

1498
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,830
let him walk away from the dark

1499
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:47,160
and into the light.

1500
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,540
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

1501
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,200
Amen.

1502
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:50,870
Sister,

1503
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:52,250
it's a good thing you're saving his soul.

1504
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,450
But I want you to save his ass.

1505
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,500
What are you doing? You want to kill me?

1506
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,450
Look at you.

1507
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,790
Stop pretending to be Qin.

1508
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:40,750
What if

1509
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,620
I decide to join you guys?

1510
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:46,910
I got a convict to offer his life to me,

1511
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:49,250
surely I can get another convict to walk away as a free man.

1512
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,450
Join us, you will get out of here in a second.

1513
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:55,120
Otherwise, you will never crack

1514
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,790
the locked-room that you put yourself in.

1515
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,040
The room that we can never leave.

1516
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:03,330
The room you made on our own...

1517
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,330
So

1518
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:31,870
make a choice.

1519
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:46,330
I

1520
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:49,830
refuse.

1521
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:06,120
I'm sorry you said that, Qin Feng

1522
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:12,330
The chosen one who is not a friend,

1523
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:14,540
will be an enemy.

1524
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,290
I feel sorry too.

1525
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,330
I didn't know

1526
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,000
that Q was not a person.

1527
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:42,000
The sixth test.

1528
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,040
Ready.

1529
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,250
Go.

1530
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,250
The sixth test.

1531
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,250
An extra kilo on the thrust.

1532
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,540
Acceleration of gravity is 9.978.

1533
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,040
Landing time 2.54 seconds.

1534
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,120
The dummy is 1.77 meters tall

1535
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,410
and weighs 66 kilos

1536
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,450
which is identical to the victim, Murata Akira.

1537
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:02,910
Okay. Now get ready for the seventh test.

1538
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,450
Okay, no need to continue.

1539
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:10,120
I would like to know what on earth you are trying to show me.

1540
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,660
The Siege Experiment.

1541
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,200
You didn't know it?

1542
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,370
We do this experiment

1543
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:16,040
to show you that

1544
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,250
there is a difference

1545
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,450
between choosing to jump,

1546
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,200
and being pushed off the edge.

1547
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,160
You see

1548
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,700
this is where he landed.

1549
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:25,250
If he had been pushed,

1550
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,200
it would be a totally different landing spot.

1551
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:28,660
However,

1552
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:32,580
this experiment hardly proves Qin Feng's innocence.

1553
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:35,080
What's the reason behind Murata's suicide?

1554
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,120
The reason is here.

1555
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,450
Although Murata Akira was a lost soul living in utter isolation,

1556
01:33:40,410 --> 01:33:42,290
I discovered his tenuous connection to the world.

1557
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,160
His only family

1558
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,830
is a daughter out of wedlock in Vietnam.

1559
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:47,250
Three days before Murata Akira escaped from jail,

1560
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,330
his daughter's bank account

1561
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,700
received over one million dollars.

1562
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,700
And one day before his death,

1563
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,040
another million dollars came in.

1564
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,950
Evidence enough to prove

1565
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:55,910
that Murata Akira had made a deal with someone

1566
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,500
to frame Qin Feng for his own death.

1567
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:03,870
Do you have other evidence that shows a direct correlation?

1568
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,080
Looks like you need my help here.

1569
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,120
You ungrateful bastard.

1570
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,910
Hold that for now.

1571
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:14,830
Aunt Kawamura.

1572
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:16,120
What?

1573
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:18,160
I made an exception to come here

1574
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,620
because your mother and I are friends.

1575
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:24,290
Now what else? Speak up.

1576
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,580
Thank you so much for coming.

1577
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,290
In order to track down the suspect,

1578
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:31,120
I had the 300 million yen sprinkled with tracking powder

1579
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,790
which can only be detected

1580
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,410
by ultraviolet radiators and fluorescent lamps.

1581
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:38,790
If Qin Feng touched Murata that day,

1582
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,830
he would have gotten tracking powder all over himself.

1583
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,620
But he was completely clean.

1584
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,750
So Qin Feng didn't even touch him.

1585
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,660
You had it all planned out?

1586
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:53,040
You scheming shrewd bastard.

1587
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,290
I believe Qin Feng and I tick in sync.

1588
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,790
We both know that

1589
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:00,120
the abduction of Kobayashi Anna couldn't be that simple.

1590
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,370
The mastermind behind it can only be

1591
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,790
Q.

1592
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:05,080
The Queen?

1593
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,540
We had to keep you in the dark

1594
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,910
to get him on the hook.

1595
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,830
It's called the ruse of self-injury.

1596
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:11,790
Exactly.

1597
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:13,000
Noda contacted us the night

1598
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,410
Qin Feng was arrested.

1599
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,660
He might be kind of a dandy,

1600
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,040
but he's trustworthy.

1601
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,410
So what do you think,

1602
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:24,080
aunt Kawamura?

1603
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:36,620
Don't try to dazzle me with your charm.

1604
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:38,080
I'm in my fifties

1605
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,750
and I have had my share of men.

1606
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:45,290
Release him.

1607
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:48,370
So Qin is all good now?

1608
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:53,120
The special thing between Qin Feng and I is that

1609
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,910
we often draw a similar analysis out of the a situation

1610
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:56,700
at the same time.

1611
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:59,040
So we both know our mission this time.

1612
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,660
I track down Q

1613
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,290
and you save Qin Feng.

1614
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,750
And Qin Feng will focus on solving the locked-room case.

1615
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,830
Now he should have reached the bottom of it.

1616
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:08,370
You have such confidence in him?

1617
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:10,450
Just like believing in myself.

1618
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:18,000
Qin!

1619
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:19,620
Hos before bros, ha?

1620
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,040
Where is Tanaka Naoki?

1621
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,410
He's a step ahead of us.

1622
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:38,500
The trial will start at 1 pm.

1623
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,370
How is your preparation going?

1624
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:40,620
Missing the last part.

1625
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,750
Where is the car that drove Su Chaiwit to the hospital?

1626
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:44,830
Because of the severity of the case,

1627
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:46,750
the car has been confiscated in the evidence department

1628
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,120
since the night Su Chaiwit died.

1629
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,200
We will go there now.

1630
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,080
Time is pressing,

1631
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,790
I'm afraid that it might delay the trial.

1632
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,040
Let's split then.

1633
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,160
Tang and I will go retrieve the evidence

1634
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,950
while you and Kiko go to the court to prepare for the defense.

1635
01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:58,700
Sure, I'll leave my car with you.

1636
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,540
There's only two hours left, don't be late.

1637
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,370
Su Chaiwit's murder case

1638
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:12,830
will have its court hearing at 1 pm today.

1639
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:15,160
The court is swarmed with

1640
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,410
Japanese Southeast Asian

1641
01:37:17,370 --> 01:37:19,580
vehemently demanding the punishment be inflicted on the perpetrator.

1642
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:21,910
According to the analysis of experts in law enforcement,

1643
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:25,200
it's highly likely that Watanabe Masaru

1644
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,790
will be found guilty of murder.

1645
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,660
Are you sure it's in the car?

1646
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:30,830
I don't know but we have to bet on it.

1647
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:31,910
What if it's not there?

1648
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:32,950
Then we lose.

1649
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:33,790
Tang!

1650
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:41,950
Are you alright?

1651
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:43,040
I'm still breathing.

1652
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:46,910
Qin!

1653
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:47,910
Don't move! My leg!

1654
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:01,620
I can't make it.

1655
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:03,330
You have to take the evidence to the court!

1656
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:04,080
How is that gonna work?

1657
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,120
Stop stalling!

1658
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:05,910
Just go!

1659
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,000
Run!

1660
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:23,120
Five of us as PUBG Ling Tong are here.

1661
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:26,120
We will end your swagger!

1662
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,080
Nice to see you again, Qin Feng.

1663
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,450
How can you start a fight without us?

1664
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:32,950
Winner Winner Peace Keeper!

1665
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:34,580
And don't forget about our

1666
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,660
Lu Jingjing!

1667
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,790
Don't flinch! March!

1668
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,370
Koji, you guys didn't come for a fight!

1669
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,660
Take me to court now!

1670
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:53,120
We can't wait any longer.

1671
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,660
Alright.

1672
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:57,700
Are you ready to start?

1673
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,290
The documents are here.

1674
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:17,910
Okay.

1675
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:39,000
July 24th, 2019

1676
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:41,290
Leaders of the Black Dragon Joint-Stock Company

1677
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,450
and the Southeast Chamber of Commerce,

1678
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:45,750
defendant Watanabe Masaru and victim Su Chaiwit,

1679
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:48,620
held a private negotiation in the Watery Hall.

1680
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:51,450
Su Chaiwit was stabbed in the upper stomach, on the right,

1681
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:52,950
with a broken piece of screen.

1682
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:54,500
He died from severe blood loss

1683
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:57,330
after being hospitalized.

1684
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,330
Jam it in.

1685
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,250
Do... don't...

1686
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,200
don't be mad.

1687
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:34,830
Calm down.

1688
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,450
I'm trying to save your boss.

1689
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,160
I'm working on that.

1690
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,830
Revenge for the boss!

1691
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:42,160
Revenge!

1692
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,040
In conclusion,

1693
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,080
the prosecutor believes that

1694
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,080
Watanabe Masaru can be confirmed

1695
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:21,660
to be the murderer of Su Chaiwit.

1696
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:26,750
And death penalty is applicable due to the vicious manner

1697
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:29,200
with which the crime is committed.

1698
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:36,540
Defense attorney, would you like to add anything?

1699
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,580
Then,

1700
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:46,250
defendant Watanabe Masaru,

1701
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:49,080
do you have an argument to make?

1702
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:53,160
Alright.

1703
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,450
Then,

1704
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,160
I'd like to announce...

1705
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,500
Objection!

1706
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,500
Sorry, you can't come in.

1707
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:08,660
Objection overruled.

1708
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:11,370
Bailiff, take them out.

1709
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:15,580
Your honor,

1710
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:19,040
Mr. Qin Feng is the assistant to the defense attorney.

1711
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,200
He just gathered some new evidence for the case.

1712
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,450
Please let him present the closing argument.

1713
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:32,000
Yes... Now I'd like to hand the court to my assistant...

1714
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,160
Qin Feng!

1715
01:42:33,410 --> 01:42:35,330
Yes, Qin Feng.

1716
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:46,000
Mr. Noda Hiroshi.

1717
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:48,410
Please stop blatantly

1718
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,250
sending unwholesome signals to me in the court.

1719
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:52,790
I think you got the wrong person.

1720
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:04,290
Mr. Qin Feng, you have ten minutes.

1721
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,910
I've placed the best translator for you.

1722
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:08,450
Now the stage is yours.

1723
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:10,910
The crime happened in the Watery Hall,

1724
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:12,790
a natural locked-room surrounded by water on all sides.

1725
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,500
There were only two people in the room when the crime took place,

1726
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:16,290
the victim and the defendant.

1727
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:17,580
Now one of them is dead

1728
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,200
while the other is sitting in the courtroom.

1729
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,830
The answer appears rather obvious.

1730
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,160
Watanabe Masaru

1731
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:23,790
is the murderer.

1732
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,620
But is that the truth?

1733
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,500
Do you really have to drink water at this point?

1734
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:51,540
The most questionable point in the case,

1735
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,580
which is also the inherently contradictory,

1736
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,000
is that everyone near the crime scene

1737
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:57,160
heard the sound of glass shattering

1738
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,330
as well as

1739
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:00,450
the yelling from Su Chaiwit.

1740
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:05,370
But photos of the crime scene show

1741
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,910
no glass debris in the spot where Watanabe Masaru passed out.

1742
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:10,290
This indicates that

1743
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,910
he fainted before the glass screen broke.

1744
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:14,660
So,

1745
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:17,750
how to explain the cry heard from outside?

1746
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,290
All of this

1747
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:24,040
was a show directed by and starring, Su Chaiwit.

1748
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:24,830
What?

1749
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,160
Bullshit!

1750
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:38,790
Stop!

1751
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,750
You want justice, yes?

1752
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:42,200
Yes!

1753
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:43,080
Yes?

1754
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,330
Yes!

1755
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,580
Bastard!

1756
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:54,540
Sorry!

1757
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:56,160
Get them!

1758
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:05,580
That night,

1759
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,790
Yoshimoto Yuki slipped Y-hydroxybutyrate

1760
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:08,370
in both cups,

1761
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:09,700
often called GHB.

1762
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:12,790
Su Chaiwit didn't drink the tea at first.

1763
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,290
We don't know the content of their conversation.

1764
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:24,950
But our defendant was so enraged by something Su Chaiwit said

1765
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,500
that he hit Su with a brass ornament

1766
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:28,660
from the table.

1767
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:31,080
Su pretended to be smacked down by the blow and dropped to the floor.

1768
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,790
But it wasn't until Watanabe Masaru passed out from the drug,

1769
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:34,830
that this case

1770
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:36,830
turned into a mind-blowing spectacle.

1771
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:41,080
Watanabe Masaru walked into the meeting room

1772
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,700
without wearing the dagger that he always had with him.

1773
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,410
Leaving Su Chaiwit no choice

1774
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:47,200
but to abandon his original plan.

1775
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:56,410
After Watanabe Masaru fell unconscious,

1776
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:58,620
Su Chaiwit smashed the glass screen.

1777
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,000
He stabbed himself

1778
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:01,870
before cutting Watanabe's hand.

1779
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:04,790
He took out a blood pouch he prepared beforehand,

1780
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:06,620
and created the scene of having been attacked.

1781
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:08,790
That's how he got the pinhole on his arm.

1782
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:13,870
What are you doing?

1783
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:17,830
It's a carefully thought out plan to plant the crime on Watanabe Masaru.

1784
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:19,620
What an amusing story.

1785
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:23,540
I could hardly stop myself from laughing.

1786
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,200
If that's the case,

1787
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,370
according to your hypothesis,

1788
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:30,410
what would be Su Chaiwit's motive?

1789
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:31,700
Once Watanabe is behind bars,

1790
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:32,830
the community of Southeast Asia

1791
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:35,160
will regain the development rights of the new Chinatown.

1792
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,160
Plus they can eradicate

1793
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,120
their arch-rival, the Black Dragon.

1794
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,950
One endeavor that yields multiple benefits.

1795
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:41,500
So he would risk losing his life

1796
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:44,410
just to frame Watanabe?

1797
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:46,040
Isn't it a bit too far-fetched?

1798
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,500
The Lecture of Locked Rooms

1799
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:54,370
divides all the locked-room cases

1800
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:56,080
into 13 categories.

1801
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,950
None of the 13 categories

1802
01:47:58,910 --> 01:48:01,660
fit this specific case.

1803
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,910
And that's because the culprit

1804
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:05,500
created a new type of room,

1805
01:48:05,450 --> 01:48:06,750
the 14th room:

1806
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,080
the victim is also the designer of the room.

1807
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:12,750
He left the scene with minimal injuries.

1808
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:16,000
It's at the second crime scene that he got stabbed.

1809
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:18,000
And the real murderer

1810
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:19,910
is you who were outside the room,

1811
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,120
Miss Kobayashi Anna.

1812
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:26,080
Are you out of your mind?

1813
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:30,120
The coroner's report shows that

1814
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,160
Su died from severe blood loss

1815
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:34,120
caused by a sharp glass object penetrating his liver.

1816
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:35,910
However, the lethal weapon

1817
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:37,620
wasn't the piece in Watanabe's hand,

1818
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:39,410
but a different one.

1819
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:43,250
I re-assembled the broken glasses

1820
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,660
and there's one piece missing.

1821
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:45,580
Because someone

1822
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,080
took this inconspicuous piece

1823
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,540
out of the room.

1824
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,790
And used it to

1825
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:51,830
stab Su Chaiwit in the car.

1826
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:56,200
This is a 3D simulation based on the glass fragments at the crime scene.

1827
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,290
Obviously one piece is missing.

1828
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:04,120
What about the evidence?

1829
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:05,950
Don't show us animation,

1830
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:07,580
show us the evidence.

1831
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,620
Don't give me a hypothesis,

1832
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:14,700
present the evidence.

1833
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:23,750
Everyone look closer.

1834
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:25,330
What's the difference

1835
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:27,250
between those two CCTV videos?

1836
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,250
It's obvious that

1837
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,450
Miss Kobayashi looks sexier in the hospital!

1838
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:32,580
But why?

1839
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:33,750
Because she's wearing less.

1840
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:34,750
What less?

1841
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:36,250
Forgive me, Miss Kobayashi.

1842
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,160
I know that you like me,

1843
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,290
but my integrity as a detective

1844
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:41,330
is telling me to place righteousness over private affection.

1845
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:45,660
Reasoning

1846
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:47,580
is about magnifying all the details.

1847
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:48,790
After I saw the differences of you,

1848
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,540
I couldn't help wondering:

1849
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:53,080
Miss Kobayashi,

1850
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:55,000
where did your handkerchief go

1851
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:57,450
between the crime scene and the hospital?

1852
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:10,910
Because you used the handkerchief

1853
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,700
to keep your hands from getting injured

1854
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:14,290
while you committed the murder.

1855
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:16,830
Objection!

1856
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,080
Objection!

1857
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:21,580
Objection to the groundless hypothesis of the defendant's attorney.

1858
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:24,950
He has a confused idea about the standing of Miss Kobayashi and himself.

1859
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,620
Miss Kobayashi is here today as a witness.

1860
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,500
This is the handkerchief, dagger and blood pouch

1861
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:32,790
that we just retrieved from Su Chaiwit's car.

1862
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:33,700
Watanabe's weaponless

1863
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:35,660
screwed up Su Chaiwit's plan

1864
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:36,910
and yours.

1865
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:40,330
As there were no pockets on your suit,

1866
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:41,580
you had to stash the weapon

1867
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,120
in Su Chaiwit's pocket to leave the crime scene.

1868
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,660
And because of that,

1869
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:46,830
after you committed the murder,

1870
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:48,290
you had to hide the real weapon

1871
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,870
temporarily in the car.

1872
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:51,290
The unexpected happened

1873
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,500
when the car got seized by the police the same night,

1874
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:54,580
which left you no time

1875
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:56,200
to get the key evidence back.

1876
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:00,790
Enough!

1877
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,500
Your honor,

1878
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:09,910
I plead guilty.

1879
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:15,370
Are you nuts?

1880
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:16,870
You didn't kill him. Why would you plead guilty?

1881
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:17,500
I did!

1882
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:18,160
You didn't!

1883
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:18,700
I did!

1884
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,250
You did not!

1885
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,080
I did! You did not!

1886
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:20,700
I did!

1887
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:22,250
No!

1888
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:24,370
Silence!

1889
01:51:24,330 --> 01:51:27,450
Where do you two think you are, an open-air market?

1890
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:28,290
Defendant

1891
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:30,330
Watanabe Masaru,

1892
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:34,750
are you sure you're pleading guilty?

1893
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:39,950
Yes.

1894
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,040
I'm guilty.

1895
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,500
Such being the case.

1896
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:50,910
I announce...

1897
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:53,950
What's the motive?

1898
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,040
What?

1899
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,410
You said I killed Su Chaiwit.

1900
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:03,250
What's my motivation?

1901
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,250
What are you taking the courtroom for?

1902
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:08,870
Silence!

1903
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:14,500
Now the verdict.

1904
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:15,580
Objection!

1905
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:21,830
So now anyone can just interrupt me?

1906
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:23,620
I haven't announce anything yet.

1907
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,700
Objection again?

1908
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:26,950
Get him out now!

1909
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:29,410
Your honor,

1910
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:33,040
this is the detective from our side.

1911
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,830
He might have found new evidence.

1912
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:37,330
Please give him time to make an argument.

1913
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,410
One last time.

1914
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,950
There is limit to my patience.

1915
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:43,080
Thank you very much.

1916
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:47,040
Is there a translator for me?

1917
01:52:47,290 --> 01:52:48,620
English works.

1918
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,290
You are such a jerk!

1919
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,500
But

1920
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:54,040
you're not the murderer.

1921
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:56,250
What?

1922
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:59,580
The motive of murder

1923
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:01,120
is right here.

1924
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:04,700
I continued to find evidence against Watanabe.

1925
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:08,000
All his files before his 38 are all blank.

1926
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:11,450
And I traced all the way back to the northeast of China.

1927
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:12,910
Do you want to get things done?

1928
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:13,910
Finish it!

1929
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:14,790
Han Jiang,

1930
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:15,950
China good.

1931
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:22,040
I found your birth certificate there.

1932
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Also,

1933
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:25,500
I happened to find another person's info.

1934
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:28,200
Your father, Yan Sheng

1935
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,910
who was born in February 1946,

1936
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:32,790
in Suihua, China.

1937
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:33,540
Yan Sheng,

1938
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,700
was another Japanese War orphan

1939
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:38,500
and his parents were Japanese immigrants.

1940
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:41,700
Yan Sheng, got this place as the World War's over,

1941
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,000
and he was brought up by a local farmer.

1942
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:46,200
He later got married with a war orphan,

1943
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:48,410
and you were born afterward.

1944
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,080
All you did is to take revenge on him.

1945
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,700
Your biological father, Watanabe, right?

1946
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:57,750
What are you talking about? Where're you from?

1947
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,410
Shut up.

1948
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,040
Detective choose to follow the truth

1949
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,330
instead of side.

1950
01:54:02,950 --> 01:54:04,620
You bring shame to your country,

1951
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:05,540
you hear me?

1952
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:07,330
Get out of here!

1953
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:13,870
How can you be so sure that I'm the girl based on a birth certificate?

1954
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:18,910
The mark on your arm.

1955
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:22,290
The BCG vaccine in Japan was conducted with nine-holed needles.

1956
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:25,620
The uneven mark on your arm just reads China.

1957
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:28,500
And the birthmark on you shoulder.

1958
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:30,200
Like this, maybe.

1959
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:33,660
Since I saw your birthmark I've been thinking.

1960
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:35,450
Watanabe wasn't taking advantage of you that night,

1961
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:37,540
but trying to make sure of something.

1962
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:42,660
Based on this clue,

1963
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:45,410
I tracked back to 1983,

1964
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:48,700
when your grandfather found your family

1965
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:52,410
and brought you three back to Japan.

1966
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:56,040
The first time you were in this country,

1967
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:59,200
you were not even three years old.

1968
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:06,700
You finish the rest,

1969
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,790
the story is much too...

1970
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,790
Yan Sheng,

1971
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:21,120
returned to Japan in 1983.

1972
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:23,160
Within two years,

1973
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,620
he married the only daughter of the Black Dragon's Oda Kazuo,

1974
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:27,080
Oda Kotoko.

1975
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,660
Then assumed his Japanese name, Watanabe Masaru.

1976
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,450
His first wife Lin Nai

1977
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,040
died in 1988 due to...

1978
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,160
Enough. Please stop.

1979
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,450
Why?

1980
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:42,700
Cause you don't want people to know

1981
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:44,410
what you did?

1982
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:51,910
We were so poor.

1983
01:55:54,370 --> 01:55:56,410
We were looking forward

1984
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:01,540
to a new life in the beginning,

1985
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:05,540
but everything

1986
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:10,500
turned out to be unbearable.

1987
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:14,830
Language barriers,

1988
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:18,580
nobody cared about us,

1989
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:23,700
and no food.

1990
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:29,950
Even when my daughter got sick,

1991
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:33,540
I couldn't do anything.

1992
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:40,620
We could have perished like roadside garbage,

1993
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:46,410
and no one would even know.

1994
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:54,750
So you just disposed of us like garbage?

1995
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:56,910
It was

1996
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:00,410
a deal.

1997
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:01,830
I beg you!

1998
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:05,750
Father! Please lend me some money!

1999
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:09,330
Naeko's life depends on it.

2000
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:12,580
Your Japanese hasn't improved much.

2001
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,660
I will study harder.

2002
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:17,910
And I thought

2003
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:20,620
you could get things done all by yourself.

2004
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:23,830
By the way,

2005
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:26,750
what are your thoughts on that offer?

2006
01:57:28,290 --> 01:57:29,450
Father,

2007
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:32,250
about that...

2008
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:34,660
I can't do it!

2009
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:40,870
I can't just leave Naeko and her mother!

2010
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:42,250
You

2011
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,200
loser!

2012
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:52,000
An inferior woman and her kid

2013
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:54,000
just stopped you!

2014
01:57:53,950 --> 01:57:57,450
Do you know what this marriage

2015
01:57:57,410 --> 01:57:59,040
will bring to the two families?

2016
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:07,870
If you want the money,

2017
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:11,700
you have to disconnect yourself from those two women

2018
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,910
and marry Kotoko.

2019
01:58:14,830 --> 01:58:18,870
To save the kid's life or not,

2020
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,950
it's your call.

2021
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:38,450
Ridiculous.

2022
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:41,450
You're telling me

2023
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:44,290
you did everything for me?

2024
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:46,370
I'm not excusing myself.

2025
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:50,500
At that time,

2026
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:53,910
I was desperate.

2027
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:59,200
Do you know the life we lived afterwards?

2028
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,750
We didn't speak the language,

2029
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:04,160
with no identity,

2030
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:08,750
and we lost our only support when you left us.

2031
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:12,250
Mother had to steal and mug

2032
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,910
to make sure I'd survive.

2033
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:20,370
And I'll never forget that

2034
01:59:23,330 --> 01:59:25,790
she gave herself to a tramp

2035
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:31,370
for a bowl of soba noodles.

2036
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:45,370
And for a slice of strawberry cake,

2037
01:59:54,950 --> 01:59:58,910
she was caught and put in jail.

2038
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:02,000
And she died there.

2039
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,830
You think you saved my life?

2040
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:14,080
How many times I've wished

2041
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:17,620
I died from that disease at five.

2042
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:23,700
Do you know

2043
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,120
how I grew up?

2044
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:32,080
And what have I been through?

2045
02:00:33,580 --> 02:00:36,200
Why did you bring me into the world

2046
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:39,290
if you can't take the responsibility?

2047
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,660
Ever since mama left me,

2048
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:47,750
I died with her.

2049
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:52,370
And it was from that day,

2050
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,540
I started telling myself

2051
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,620
that I need to seek revenge!

2052
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:06,910
That I will make you suffer from the loss of everything

2053
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:10,700
and the death in prison!

2054
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:16,500
Su Chaiwit was a jerk too!

2055
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:18,580
No one would regret

2056
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:22,000
both of your deaths!

2057
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:36,500
Due to the complexity of the case,

2058
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:38,660
I declare

2059
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:41,120
a re-hearing of the Watanabe homicide case

2060
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:43,790
be held after the evidence is re-organized.

2061
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:51,750
Court in recess.

2062
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:56,950
Please take suspect Miss Kobayashi.

2063
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:23,870
Naeko!

2064
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,040
So what exactly did Su Chaiwit

2065
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,540
tell Watanabe that night?

2066
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:32,580
Kobayashi grew up without a father,

2067
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:35,870
so she yearns for older men.

2068
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:38,660
All you have to do is curl your finger,

2069
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:40,700
and she will fling herself at you

2070
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:43,750
no matter what you do with her.

2071
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:53,040
It's the guilt that's been weighing on him over these years.

2072
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,790
Nobody can touch that,

2073
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:57,620
including himself.

2074
02:03:58,410 --> 02:04:01,250
So he recognized Kobayashi as his daughter that night?

2075
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,450
I think so.

2076
02:04:02,410 --> 02:04:03,620
But he didn't know

2077
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:05,200
that Kobayashi indeed came for him.

2078
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:09,620
You should be happy, man!

2079
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:12,080
Because the case is finally cracked.

2080
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:13,700
Let's find a Thai restaurant.

2081
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:14,750
What do you want?

2082
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:15,790
Thai food?

2083
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:17,000
Tom Yum Kung! Pad Thai!

2084
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:17,950
Let's go to a Chinese restaurant

2085
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:19,290
and drink some Chinese liquor.

2086
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:20,540
And some dumplings and hotpot.

2087
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:22,250
Now we are in Japan,

2088
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:24,500
shouldn't I invite you all for sushi and sake?

2089
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:25,870
Tom Yum Kung is spicy.

2090
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:27,330
We should have Japanese cuisine since we are in Japan.

2091
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:29,660
Chinese food have everything! You can have whatever you want.

2092
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,250
So beautiful.

2093
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:41,500
What date is today?

2094
02:04:41,450 --> 02:04:43,750
Obon Festival.

2095
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:45,580
People in this way

2096
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:47,370
honor the spirits of their ancestors.

2097
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:51,620
May the deceased rest in peace hopefully.

2098
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:54,790
May people be free from suffering.

2099
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:57,790
World peace, harmony brings wealth!

2100
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:01,870
Why are you staring at me?

2101
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:02,870
Tang,

2102
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:05,540
I've known you for so long,

2103
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:07,040
and this is the most insightful thing you've ever said.

2104
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,080
Of course!

2105
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,040
Do you know where you're much better than these two?

2106
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:10,950
Where?

2107
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,250
You have me!

2108
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,910
There's a place in your heart

2109
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:39,160
And I know that it is love

2110
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:44,250
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow

2111
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:47,790
And if you really try

2112
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:50,700
You'll find there's no need to cry

2113
02:05:50,950 --> 02:05:52,290
In this place

2114
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:55,950
You'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

2115
02:05:57,080 --> 02:06:00,080
There are ways to get there

2116
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:03,040
If you care enough for the living

2117
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,580
Make a little space

2118
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,580
Make a better place

2119
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:11,540
Heal the world

2120
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,870
Make it a better place

2121
02:06:14,830 --> 02:06:20,040
For you and for me and the entire human race

2122
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:23,870
There are people dying

2123
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:26,870
If you care enough for the living

2124
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:30,950
Make a better place for you and for me

2125
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:34,830
Heal the world

2126
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:38,750
Make it a better place

2127
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:44,290
For you and for me and the entire human race

2128
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:47,700
There are people dying

2129
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:50,620
If you care enough for the living

2130
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:55,750
Make a better place for you and for me

2131
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:58,450
Heal the world

2132
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:02,120
Make it a better place

2133
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:03,540
By the way,

2134
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:07,250
Si Nuo asked me to give this to you.

2135
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:09,500
Not paper-folding this time?

2136
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:11,330
Ring is the token of affection.

2137
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:12,870
Why a bracelet?

2138
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:15,040
Mobius Strip!

2139
02:07:15,410 --> 02:07:16,500
What does it mean?

2140
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:17,540
She wants to tell me

2141
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,660
that the good and the evil are not exactly antithetical,

2142
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:21,120
but intertwined.

2143
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,450
Sometimes,

2144
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:24,160
it's hard to distinguish between the good and the evil.

2145
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:27,910
Don't you think that the band resembles a character?

2146
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,910
Q!

2147
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,910
Q

2148
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:51,080
Qin Feng refused us.

2149
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,290
No one has ever refused us.

2150
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,950
He is either with or

2151
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,910
against us.

2152
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:07,700
It's his loss.

2153
02:08:08,450 --> 02:08:10,120
Not ours.

2154
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:16,870
If not him,

2155
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:20,660
there will be others.

2156
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:28,330
To future.

2157
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:30,500
To future.

2158
02:08:49,790 --> 02:08:51,200
Someone has said that

2159
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:52,750
despite the difference between individuals,

2160
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:55,660
the amount of good and evil remains constant.

2161
02:08:55,620 --> 02:08:57,370
While some take shelter in the darkness,

2162
02:08:57,330 --> 02:09:00,040
we choose the light.

2163
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,660
As we believe that

2164
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:03,450
the world exists

2165
02:09:03,410 --> 02:09:05,830
because justice always prevails

2166
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:08,500
and light overcomes darkness.

2167
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:10,000
As long as vices exist,

2168
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:11,870
we won't hold back on

2169
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:13,200
declaring war on them!
