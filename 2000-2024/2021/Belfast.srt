- Hello, there.
- How are you, Frankie?

24
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,117
Very well.

25
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,154
- Buddy!
- You all right, Paddy?

26
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:16,889
- Buddy!
- You can't catch me!

27
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:18,491
Yeah, I'm gonna
catch you! Just wait.

28
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,826
All right?

29
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:25,097
- Buddy!
- Buddy!

30
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,335
Buddy!

31
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:32,272
- I'm speedy. You're not.
- I'm gonna get you.

32
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:33,972
Hiya, Moira. How are you?

33
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,442
Very good, thank you.
How are you?

34
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:37,477
- I'm good.
- Ah, and he's dribbling, he's dribbling.

35
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,479
- Score now!
- Buddy!

36
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:42,248
- Cheat!
- No, no cheating. I did it fair and square.

37
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:43,550
I'm telling you.

38
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,884
You nearly got me.

39
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:47,354
Yes! I did, too!

40
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:48,621
Hey, Buddy!

41
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,390

- Yes!
- I'll get you next time, Buddy.

You dirty bastard!

48
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,941
- Hiya, Buddy.
- Hello, Mrs. Ford.

49
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,510
Have you been fighting
any dragons?

50
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:13,045
- Only a couple.
- I've got a couple in my house.

51
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,047
- Is that right, Mr. West?
- Aye.

52
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,982
And can you lend us
a shield, Buddy?

53
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,385
I'll see what I can do.

54
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,052
- Say hello to your daddy for me, will you?
- Will do.

55
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,054
Buddy, your ma's calling you
for your tea.

56
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,523
Thanks, Mrs. Kavanagh.

57
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:24,923
She says it's tripe and onions.

58
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:27,327
- She did not.
- In a sandwich.

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,928
She did not.
She says you're a terrible man.

60
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,664
She's right.

61
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:37,903
What's going on down there?

62
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:01,161
Please, please,
we've done nothing.

63
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,596
Get the kids inside!

64
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,267
Get away from here! Go!

65
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,235
We don't want any trouble!

66
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,070
Come on! Get inside!

67
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,151
Mum!

68
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,200
Buddy!

69
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,601
Ma!

70
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,069
Buddy!

71
00:05:55,415 --> 00:06:00,186
Mum! Mum! Mum!

72
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,356
Keep your head down
and don't move!

73
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,757
Will!

74
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,560
- Mum!
- Will!

75
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,371
Danny, where are you?!

76
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:21,674
Say nothing to nobody.

77
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,476
- Catholics out!
- Easy, lads.

78
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:28,581
Get them upstairs!

79
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:29,516
Catholics out!

80
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:33,286
Get in the house! Mummy!

81
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:37,790
Mummy! What's happening?!

82
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:40,159
Keep him there and stay still.

83
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,097
Mum, what are you doing?

84
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:46,766
Will, stay where you are.

85
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,435
Mum!

86
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,404
You've been warned!

87
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:54,674
Get these fuckers
out of your street!

88
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,543
And if you talk to the police,

89
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:58,545
we'll be back for you, too!

90
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:00,780
Get the Catholics out!

91
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:15,595
Get down!
Get yourselves down!

92
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,200
Stand back!

93
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:49,696
<i>Holy God.</i>

94
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:55,134
<i>Belfast was in shock
this morning as the impact</i>

95
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,737
<i>of last night's rioting
was all too clear.</i>

96
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,872
<i>Small numbers of Catholics
still peacefully living</i>

97
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,342
<i>in Protestant areas
were targeted.</i>

98
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,177
<i>Their houses were attacked
and marked,</i>

99
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,478
<i>and intimidation may force them</i>

100
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,380
<i>to leave their homes
completely.</i>

101
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,515
<i>Can these tightly-knit
neighborhoods ever return</i>

102
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:12,619
<i>to the peace they shared
together only 24 hours ago?</i>

103
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,454
<i>Further reports suggest...</i>

104
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,889
Up front, Frank.
I'll show you where I put them.

105
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,691
Look, we need to get
this barricade up

106
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:20,460
before those kids
come back, okay?

107
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:22,228
Are we taking all these
paving stones to the barricade?

108
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:23,863
- We taking them all down?
- We need them all.

109
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:27,767
Is poor Jane okay?
Is she all right?

110
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,202
Don't you worry, Paddy.

111
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,570
We're not gonna let them
back here again.

112
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,205
You're as welcome
on this street as any of us.

113
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:33,706
All right, Buddy?

114
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,241
We're gonna have to go
down the yard and get more.

115
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:36,442
We've got
four more houses to do,

116
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,244
and that's
the last pane of glass.

117
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:39,412
Apparently, Fergus
didn't come home last night.

118
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:41,180
I'm gonna go see
Mrs. McGuinness now.

119
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,448
It's all right.
I saw Fergus down the road.

120
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:43,783
- He's coming now.
- We have to do this.

121
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:44,884
The police aren't
going to protect us,

122
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,252
so we have to do it ourselves.

123
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:47,387
Is that all
you can take in a barrow?

124
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,788
Kids, please, go inside.

125
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,423
I don't want you out here
until it's all safe again.

126
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,291
- Come on.
- Come on, load them up here.

127
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,526
Would you look at the
poor children with that load.

128
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,261
Can you wheel that
up to the front?

129
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:56,696
Frankie will show you
where we're putting it.

130
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:58,498
Tell Paddy I'll be there
in a minute to fix that.

131
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,266
I've just got to nip into
the house and get my tools.

132
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:00,933
Watch yourself
getting up there, love.

133
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:04,570
Put that pallet
over here. Over here.

134
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,340
Get them kids to stay away
from them sharp edges.

135
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,676
Pull them rocks up.

136
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,644
Everything.
Put that washing machine in.

137
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:15,815
Come on,
let's get this all done.

138
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,526
<i>The likeliest move is
to bring troops into Belfast</i>

139
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,461
<i>in the hope of avoiding
further clashes</i>

140
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:31,597
<i>between rioters and police,
particularly the B-Specials.</i>

141
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:33,299
- Stand to the side!
- <i>Another 600 troops will be</i>

142
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:34,734
<i>available this afternoon.</i>

143
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,536
Off these streets now!

144
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:42,508
Get off the road! Stand back!

145
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,852
We're not stupid!

146
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,587
You can't keep us
in our houses!

147
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,589
<i>The men of the 3rd
Battalion of the Light Infantry</i>

148
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:58,758
<i>fly in from Plymouth
to plug the gap</i>

149
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,259
<i>left by the use of troops.</i>

150
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:01,594
<i>A curfew is another possibility</i>

151
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:03,629
<i>which is being
widely mentioned.</i>

152
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:04,997
I've just come from
the airport now.

153
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:06,566
I've literally just come
from the airport.

154
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,934
I live in that street.
That's my kids there.

155
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,502
I live in number 96.

156
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,738
Get up there quick. Quick.

157
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:13,339
Christ.

158
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,878
- Stop!
- Just let him through...

159
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,413
Where do you think
you're going, love?

160
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,614
To bring my husband home.

161
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:22,882
That's him
on the other side there.

162
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,050
Where's he been, then?

163
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,518
None of your bloody business.

164
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:27,353
Not with you
in your hour of need?

165
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,621
- That's a bit off, isn't it?
- He works away in England.

166
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,490
Does he?
What kind of work is that?

167
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:32,058
- He's a joiner.
- I see.

168
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,893
And has he joined
any of these groups

169
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,495
making all this mess
in your street?

170
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:36,896
He knew nothing about
the whole bloody thing.

171
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,498
That's why he's here now.

172
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,333
He's come home from
his work to see his family.

173
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,401
Glad to hear it, madam.

174
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,604
- Hi.
- Hi.

175
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,443
They nearly had you there,
Steve McQueen.

176
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,011
I'll have you
in a second, Frankie.

177
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:53,613
- Come on, you two.
- Hi, boys.

178
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,385
Stay in your homes tonight.

179
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,653
- Thank you very much.
- Okay?

180
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,321
Aye.

181
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:07,827
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

182
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:10,563
These are the voyages of

183
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,565
- the Starship Enterprise...
- Did they attack you?

184
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:15,434
No. It was only
the Catholic houses.

185
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,770
Them boyos want them out.

186
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:20,006
Them peoples don't give you
any bother in that street,

187
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,641
- do they?
- Not at all.

188
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:24,443
Sure, they're friends,
they're family, same as us.

189
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,045
They just kick
with the left foot.

190
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,680
Exactly.

191
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,016
Sure, my best friend in
the street is Mrs. Ganjawala.

192
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,484
She's Indian.

193
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,419
She even comes to
the wee mission with me.

194
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:35,822
Well, them curries,
I tried one once.

195
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,424
I had to wear
a nappy for a week.

196
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:43,629
- Will.
- Oh, Mum. Sorry, Granny.

197
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,631
Ah, she's well able
to handle herself.

198
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,533
It's being so cheerful
keeps you going, isn't it?

199
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,368
Sure, I'm not gonna be
running up the Cave Hill

200
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:51,571
any time soon, am I?

201
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:53,372
- It's just not knowing.
- That's not easy.

202
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,041
How it's gonna
affect their schooling.

203
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,976
Will, would you
turn that telly off

204
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,011
- and talk to your granny?
- Hi, Pop.

205
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:00,813
Hiya, Buddy.

206
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:05,117
Does the doctor
want to see you again?

207
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,553
He's given me a letter
for the hospital.

208
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,889
- And did you go?
- There's no point.

209
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:16,762
I think you've a few
big decisions to make, son.

210
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:21,467
Did you clear up
that wee bit of trouble

211
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,536
- we were talking about?
- Hey, wee fellas.

212
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,672
We're not deaf back here.

213
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:39,018
Oh, yes, we've friends
on the Protestant side.

214
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,586
They weren't friends last night.

215
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,021
They weren't
friends last night, though.

216
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,757
Paddy Kavanagh told me
as long as Catholics

217
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,760
keep confessing everything bad
that they do to a priest,

218
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,495
then they can do
whatever they want

219
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,030
and God will forgive them
all the time.

220
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,899
Well, Paddy Kavanagh's
family's not gonna be living

221
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:54,667
in this street for much longer,
so you'd better check

222
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,602
he's not taking
the hand out of you.

223
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:58,171
Ugh, I don't know how it works.

224
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,506
They get a lot of water thrown
on them and then they're okay.

225
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:01,774
I think that's it.

226
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:03,509
Why aren't you going, too?

227
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,145
'Cause me and your father
have business to discuss.

228
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:06,779
God understands.

229
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,648
Come on.

230
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,816
- What are those?
- My little secret.

231
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,685
Now, come on.

232
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:16,522
I've had too much God
for one day.

233
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:19,458
Well, your granny says you can
never have too much God.

234
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,693
You might need him
before too long.

235
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,528
Look, mind your nonsense
for now,

236
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,030
and I'll take youse all
to the pictures tomorrow.

237
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:25,798
Brilliant!

238
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:27,466
<i>Robin and the 7 Hoods</i> is on

239
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,834
in the afternoon
at the Capitol.

240
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,836
- Paddy saw it.
- Wait, is that gangsters?

241
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,539
- It's a blinking musical.
- No, it's not.

242
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:35,875
There's Little John
and swords and everything.

243
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,543
Well, you can't go
tomorrow afternoon.

244
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:38,844
Your cousins will be here.

245
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,213
Your aunties and uncles
want to say goodbye

246
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:41,614
to your father
before he goes back.

247
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:43,082
But, Daddy,
are you not gonna be

248
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,750
a vigilante on our barricade?

249
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:46,919
No more talk
about bloody barricades.

250
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,821
That whole nonsense
will stop soon enough.

251
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:51,057
I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

252
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,627
Hey, less of
the long face, son.

253
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,696
These two can go
and pray for it to stop now,

254
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,764
and we'll all go to the big
picture house in town tomorrow,

255
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,967
Daddy will pick the film,
and we'll forget about

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,269
this whole bunch of eejits

257
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:03,769
before I have to go
back to work.

258
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,571
Was that our side
that done all that

259
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:08,708
to them Catholic houses
in our street, Daddy?

260
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,844
There is no our side
and their side in our street.

261
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:14,714
Or there didn't
used to be, anyway.

262
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,916
It's all bloody religion.
That's the problem.

263
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:18,985
Then why are you
sending us to church?

264
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:20,886
Because your granny'd
kill me if I didn't.

265
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,723
But, Daddy,
if we were Catholics,

266
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,591
we could not go to church,

267
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,093
and then every once
in a wee while,

268
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,828
we could go in and confess,

269
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,863
and then they'd have to tell us
we were forgiven

270
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,266
and we wouldn't have to go
in again for ages.

271
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,003
<i>I've nothing against Catholics.</i>

272
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,071
<i>But it's a religion of fear.</i>

273
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:43,509
Protestants, you will die!

274
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,544
Agonizingly!

275
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:48,814
And where will you go

276
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,851
when you shuffle off
this pestilential mortal coil?

277
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:53,552
Where?!

278
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,790
Well, I will tell you where.

279
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:00,059
Picture the scene.

280
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:03,029
A fork in the road.

281
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:08,768
In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.

282
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:13,206
In the other,
a long and winding road

283
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,744
which stretches down and away
into an unknowable distance.

284
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,115
One will take you to the bosom
of the Lord's grace,

285
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,653
forever and a day
caress you with beatific love.

286
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:33,360
And the other will spew you
into an eternal pit

287
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:36,695
of sulfurous suffering,
pustulating pain,

288
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,831
from which you will never, ever,

289
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:41,667
through the seven circles
of hell escape!

290
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,271
And I ask you here and now...

291
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:49,008
...which road will you take?!

292
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,912
Now, money.

293
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,980
Thanks very much.

294
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:56,715
Really good.

295
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:48,834
Remember, one slice
per sandwich.

296
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:50,270
I don't want to be
giving too much away.

297
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,172
With regard to the explosive...

298
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,408
I think that's a fair word...
situation in Northern Ireland,

299
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,877
are we getting near
to the point where you,

300
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,745
as prime minister of
the United Kingdom government,

301
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,314
will feel it necessary
to intervene

302
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:04,683
and use the supreme authority
which is yours in law

303
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:07,154
either to remedy grievances
or to ensure order?

304
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:08,954
Is it almost ready?

305
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,890
If that became necessary,

306
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:14,793
of course, I shouldn't shrink
from doing whatever was needed.

307
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:17,430
Uh, we have been deeply
concerned about the problem

308
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:19,765
of civil rights
in Northern Ireland.

309
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:21,700
I've paid tribute...

310
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,035
Make an orderly queue

311
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:24,770
to be allowed entrance
to the street, please.

312
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:29,476
All right,
what have we got left now?

313
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,311
Not doing a strip search
this time, eh, Frankie?

314
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:32,845
Whose do you belong to?

315
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,447
You know full bloody well
who we belong to.

316
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:35,948
I'm taking my wife
down to her sister's,

317
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:37,317
like I've been doing
all my bloody life.

318
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,951
- House number?
- There's no number.

319
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:40,453
Just a name.

320
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,422
- What's the name?
- Arsehole.

321
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,057
Very funny, Mack.
Always the joker, eh?

322
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,459
On you go.

323
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:48,228
We won't worry about
their name and number now.

324
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,130
We know where they live.

325
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:54,033
Whoo. You like that?

326
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:03,042
How's that, then,
Ginger Rogers, huh?

327
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:12,084
Whoo. Come on you,
Fred Astaire.

328
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,403
- You can tell them by their names.
- How?

329
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:34,039
Well, if he's a Patrick
or a Sean, he's a Catholic,

330
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:36,108
and if he's a Billy or a
William, he's a protestant.

331
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:38,110
There's more names
than that, though.

332
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:39,379
I know that.

333
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:41,314
I'm just saying,
them's the obvious ones.

334
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:44,417
What about Morris?

335
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:46,519
Uh, don't know.

336
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:49,155
We've a wee fella down
our street called Thomas.

337
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:51,558
- What's he?
- Protestant definitely.

338
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:53,993
He's not. He's a Catholic.

339
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,794
- No, he's not.
- He is.

340
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:57,830
Sure, they burnt his house out
the other night

341
00:18:57,863 --> 00:19:00,433
'cause his family is Catholic.

342
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,402
Sure, we've a cousin
called Thomas.

343
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:04,304
I know. That's what I'm saying.

344
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:07,006
Well, how the hell are you
supposed to know, then?

345
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,874
You have to get taught it.

346
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,210
Who teaches you?

347
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:11,877
So the doctor says,
"Listen, John,

348
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,280
I've got some bad news
and worse."

349
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,282
And John says, "Oh, no.
Wh-What's the bad news?"

350
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:18,551
And he goes, "Well, you've only
got 24 hours to live."

351
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:20,320
John says,
"That's-that's awful.

352
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:21,554
What could be worse than that?"

353
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,189
Doctor says,
"Well, I've been trying

354
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:25,425
to get ahold of you since yesterday."

355
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,894
- Why do you even have to know?
- In case they attack you.

356
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:30,530
- When?
- When you're out and about.

357
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:32,031
Well, if they're attacking you,

358
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:33,433
they're not gonna stop
and tell you their name.

359
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,168
It wouldn't get to that stage.

360
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:38,471
- Why?
- 'Cause you use your secret knowledge to bluff them.

361
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,173
What are you talking about?

362
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:42,142
They can just come up to you
when you're not expecting it

363
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:45,445
and ask you, "Are you
Protestant or Catholic?"

364
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,046
But it's a trick question,
you see,

365
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,448
'cause they don't
tell you what they are.

366
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:51,850
And what do you say then
to not get a dig in the gob?

367
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:53,320
- "I'm a Catholic"?
- Wrong.

368
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:55,255
That's exactly
what they think you will say.

369
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:57,022
They think you're trying
to bluff them.

370
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:58,891
But you have to
double-bluff them.

371
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:01,628
- How?
- You say, "I'm a Protestant."

372
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:04,597
- But I am a Protestant.
- That's the point!

373
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:06,533
Blanchflower's now
at the halfway line.

374
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,201
He looks up.

375
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:12,339
Is there nothing this
Spurs right-half cannot do?

376
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,107
Perfect through ball!

377
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,279
Nice pass, son.

378
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:21,980
Would you go on away in and
tell your pa I'd like to have

379
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,250
a wee chat with him, please?

380
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:27,420
Tell him it's Billy Clanton.

381
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:28,854
And McLaury.

382
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:32,958
What do you want?

383
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,494
We're looking to cleanse
the community a wee bit.

384
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:38,131
You wouldn't want to be
the odd man out in this street.

385
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:41,100
You saw what happened to your
neighbors from the other side.

386
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:43,403
You touch my family
and I'll kill you.

387
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:44,604
Calm down, fella.

388
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:46,373
I'm a Protestant, like yourself.

389
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:48,907
- All all right?
- Aye, it's okay, Mackie.

390
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,909
Look, things get out of hand

391
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,146
pretty quick round these parts.

392
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,349
Cash or commitment.

393
00:20:58,184 --> 00:20:59,652
The boys who cleaned up
your street

394
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:01,621
have made me their new
local chief.

395
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:04,923
So, you can report to me
with either.

396
00:21:04,957 --> 00:21:06,359
All right?

397
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:08,361
Have a wee think.

398
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:09,962
I'll be in touch.

399
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:17,170
Buddy, come on.

400
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:18,538
Come and show me
how to play this game.

401
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:20,673
Come on.
Let's have a look. Huh?

402
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:36,423
See you, now.

403
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,161
All the big boys have left.

404
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:42,562
Buddy, give your brother
a hand there, will you?

405
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,996
Pick this sofa up, right?

406
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:45,632
Here, can you give us a hand?

407
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,700
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,202
You want to set your gun down?

409
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,204
No, it's all right, thank you.

410
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,340
Now, don't you be
scratching my walls with that.

411
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,041
You got it? Right now, hold on.

412
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:58,043
This worked earlier.

413
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,146
I'll go in first.

414
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,216
- All right?
- Stewart.

415
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,318
- Frankie.
- All right?

416
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,286
All right, Frankie?

417
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,254
Is that you all this time
at the barricades?

418
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:09,589
Somebody has to.

419
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,224
Better me than Billy Clanton.

420
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:12,659
Aye.

421
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,761
Not many people chose this.

422
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,563
There's a few men hiding
behind them barricades.

423
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,030
And they'll keep hiding

424
00:22:18,063 --> 00:22:19,064
where they're afraid
for their families.

425
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,066
It's a waiting game now.

426
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:22,435
When it's time
for that wall to come down,

427
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:25,138
I'll be the first
to swing a hammer, but now?

428
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:28,208
"They also serve
who stand and wait."

429
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,946
We can't all be acting
the Lone Ranger.

430
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:48,060
This is
a story of long, long ago,

431
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:50,663
when the world
was just beginning.

432
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:52,298
A young world.

433
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:54,801
A world early
in the morning of time.

434
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:11,551
No wonder
you brought us to this.

435
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:14,187
It's educational for the boys.

436
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,421
Aye.

437
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:20,393
Raquel Welch is
a hell of an education.

438
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:31,604
If people ask you to join
anything, deliver anything,

439
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:34,574
do messages for anybody,
you do nothing, okay?

440
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:37,143
You tell your ma, she'll
tell me, and I'll sort it.

441
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:38,711
- You understand me?
- Yes, Daddy.

442
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:41,214
Very good.
I'm proud of you, son.

443
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:42,549
Now get off to bed,
the pair of you.

444
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,417
I'm up too early
in the morning to see you,

445
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,653
so make sure you get to school
all right, all right?

446
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,821
Don't mess your mother about,
and I'll see you in two weeks.

447
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,623
- Okay?
- Yes, Daddy.

448
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:52,057
Good boys.

449
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:55,562
<i>A fork in the road.</i>

450
00:23:55,595 --> 00:24:00,633
<i>In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.</i>

451
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:05,103
<i>Which road will you take?!</i>

452
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:10,310
You're running round here

453
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:11,811
like the man
in the big picture,

454
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:13,246
not paying your taxes

455
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,581
and spending all our money
on horses.

456
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:16,149
It's the building trade.

457
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:17,784
I told you it doesn't work
the normal way.

458
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:19,185
I told you I had it covered.

459
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:20,520
I was the one
who had it covered.

460
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:22,188
No, you had us paying
three years of back tax.

461
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,723
To keep you out of bloody jail.

462
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:25,892
We're drowning in debt.

463
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,894
We're near done
with the back tax.

464
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:30,196
Ten pound a month
for three bloody years.

465
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:32,432
This is the time to think
about making a new start.

466
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:35,401
I know nothing else
but Belfast.

467
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:36,736
Exactly.

468
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,705
There's a whole world out there.

469
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:41,207
We can give these boys a
better chance than we ever had.

470
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,310
There's Commonwealth countries
needing tradesmen.

471
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:46,546
The government will give you
assisted passage.

472
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,848
We can get the whole family
to the other side of the world

473
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:50,717
for ten pound.

474
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,485
We're living in a civil war,

475
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:56,121
and I'm not here
to protect my family.

476
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,660
What are those supposed to be?

477
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:03,129
An escape route.

478
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,838
Get this street locked down.

479
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:14,440
Come on, get a move on.
We're gonna be late again.

480
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:15,908
Come on!

481
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:17,510
<i>Throughout the night,</i>

482
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,779
<i>sniping became
the tactic of the rioters.</i>

483
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:21,414
<i>As we drove past a side street,</i>

484
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:23,816
<i>three men on the corner
dived for cover.</i>

485
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,652
- It's not bad, though, is it?
- <i>A young man with a revolver</i>

486
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:27,253
<i>asked us for a lift.</i>

487
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:29,389
<i>At 4:00 this morning,
RUC turned us back</i>

488
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:31,391
- <i>from the Falls area.</i>
- Yeah.

489
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,459
<i>Snipers, they said,
were still at work,</i>

490
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:35,762
<i>and in the distance,
one heard the ominous burst</i>

491
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,330
<i>of machine-gun fire.</i>

492
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:39,332
<i>The scene terrified me,</i>

493
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:41,668
<i>but it reminded an
American colleague of Harlem,</i>

494
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,803
<i>but, he added, it seems easier
to get guns here.</i>

495
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,605
One more left.

496
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:48,207
<i>Dawn over Belfast
today showed a grim scene,</i>

497
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:49,976
<i>buildings scarred by fire,</i>

498
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:52,278
<i>thousands of pounds' worth
of damage caused,</i>

499
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:53,946
<i>and, of course,
the tragic loss of life.</i>

500
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,450
<i>It's been a night of shame for
Belfast, one that will live on</i>

501
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:58,851
<i>in the memories
of its people...</i>

502
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:00,586
Come on, you two. School.

503
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:07,593
Walking, please. No running.

504
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:10,229
Morning, miss.

505
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:13,266
<i>Twelve elevens are 132.</i>

506
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:16,836
Twelve twelves are 144.

507
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,938
Well, I'm pleased
to say your times tables

508
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,473
were a lot more impressive
to hear

509
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:21,974
than your test scores
were to read.

510
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,342
The whole point
of these weekly tests

511
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,911
is to monitor your progress.

512
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:28,614
The best will sit directly by
my desk, the seat of learning,

513
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:30,783
and the rest of you will view
your Sisyphean struggles

514
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:33,286
from the distance
you have imposed upon yourself

515
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,353
by a lack of application.

516
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:36,923
Billy Clanton Junior, 17%.

517
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:38,858
Bottom row, seat 12.

518
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,827
Rachel, seat 11.

519
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,295
Martin to seat ten.

520
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,596
Freddie, seat eight.

521
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:45,398
Karen to seat four.

522
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:49,869
And in the medal positions
this week, with 72%, in bronze,

523
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,305
is Buddy, seat three.

524
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,541
And, of course, in silver
again, we have Ron,

525
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:58,444
and Catherine with
the gold yet again this week.

526
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:00,847
Congratulations, Catherine.
Very well done.

527
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:10,356
The wee girl still showing
some interest, yeah?

528
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:13,326
She looks at me sometimes,
but we're not allowed to talk

529
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,795
in the class,
so I can't say anything.

530
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:17,597
And then when we go out
to the playground,

531
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,366
she always goes off
with the other girls.

532
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:23,302
Anyways, I think
she loves that other fella.

533
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:25,772
Ah, you don't know that
for sure.

534
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:27,840
Women are very mysterious.

535
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,510
And women can smash
your face in, too, mister.

536
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:33,713
Your granny's become
less mysterious over the years.

537
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,381
So, you really like her?

538
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:38,351
When I grow up,
I want to marry her.

539
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:40,620
Yeah, sounds like
you really like her.

540
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:43,456
You know,
she's not only at school.

541
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:46,492
You could see
where she lives maybe.

542
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:48,795
It's Reynolds Drive,
four houses in from the right,

543
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:50,062
the one with the wonky eight.

544
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:52,064
Oh, you've done your research.

545
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,667
I pass it every day
on my way home.

546
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,703
I try to look in,
but she never sees me.

547
00:27:57,737 --> 00:28:00,039
She's always doing
her bloody homework.

548
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:02,408
If she were a wee bit
more stupid like me,

549
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:04,010
we'd be sitting together
by now.

550
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:08,414
Ah, "a pity beyond all telling
is hid in the heart of love."

551
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:10,416
Oh, he's full of
pretty answers, that one.

552
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:11,717
Come on, it's time to go.

553
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:13,386
I don't want your mommy
shouting at me

554
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:14,520
because you're late.

555
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:16,722
- Cheerio, son.
- Cheerio.

556
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:22,562
Here, take this threepenny bit.

557
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:24,497
Get yourself a wee sweetie.

558
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,098
I'm not allowed, Granny.

559
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,367
My da says you can't afford it.

560
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:29,735
I'm always saying
to your man there

561
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:31,938
what's yours is mine
and what's mine's me own.

562
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,706
Thanks, Granny.

563
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,976
Try and find out
how that wee girl thinks.

564
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:38,744

He just said he couldn't give
any more money to the streets.

Right, Billy,
we've no call for fists here.

Aye?
Well, what is it the man says?

A fist is only as good or bad

00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,949
so I can't do anything about it.

627
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,588

- Hello, Mr. West.

628

629

Will you ask your da
to drop down to see us

00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:46,999

- He's not back at the weekend.

00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:48,634
That's a pity.

632
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,669
- Tell your ma I was asking after him, will you?
- Aye.

633
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:51,871

634
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,306

All right?

637
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:00,579
Why is your da not coming home?

638
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:03,049
He can't come home
every weekend.

639
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:04,784
It's too dear.

640
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:08,087
You won't get your wee
Matchbox car, then, will you?

641
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:15,128
Come on.

642
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:16,962
Coming.

643
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,865
- Do you want to join a gang?
- I'm not allowed.

644
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,202
- Why not?
- My mother said she'd kill me.

645
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:24,804
Sure she doesn't have to know.
That's the whole point.

646
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:26,273
- Are you in one?
- Aye.

647
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:27,873
- What's it called?
- Doesn't have a name.

648
00:32:27,907 --> 00:32:29,809
- Why not?
- Has to be secret.

649
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:31,244
That's what they tell you
when you join.

650
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:32,678
What do you do?

651
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,148
I can't tell you
till you're in the gang.

652
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:38,218
- How many of you are there?
- Not allowed to say.

653
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,187
What do you have to do
to join, then?

654
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,688

y-your numbers

aren't very clear to read.

683
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,177
She might give you
the benefit of the doubt

684
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:15,182
if your seven looks like a one
with a fancy tail, right?

685
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:18,117
The same with a two and a six.

686
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:19,818
Right? Keep her guessing.

687
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,455
That means you'll have two
or three horses in every race.

688
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,191
Isn't that cheating?

689
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:27,059
No, well, I'd call it
spread betting.

690
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:30,829
And if it gets you moved up by
one seat to bask in the light

691
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,098

then you're off to the races.

692
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,768
But sure there's only one
right answer.

693
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:37,237
If that were true, son,
people wouldn't be

694
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,005
blowing themselves up
all over this town.

695
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:47,112
I think my da wants us
to leave Belfast.

696
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:53,886
What do you want?

697
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,491
Every night, before I go to
sleep, when I say my prayers,

698
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,194
I ask God if he'd fix it
so that when I wake up

699
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:04,497
in the morning, I'm the best
footballer in the world.

700
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:07,032
And then I also ask him as well

701
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:09,935
that when I grow up,
can I marry Catherine.

702
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:11,837
Even if she loves Ronnie Boyd.

703
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,441
But she could still see him,
but she'd marry me.

704
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,309
That's what I want.

705
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:26,018
<i>You looking
for trouble, Doniphon?</i>

706
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,754
<i>You aim to help me find some?</i>

707
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:31,123
What's the matter?

708
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:33,193
Everybody in this country
kill crazy?!

709
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:34,261
Here!

710
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:37,297
Show's over for now.

711
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,066
Try it, Liberty.

712
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,203
Just try it.

713
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:45,004
What right
do you have to interfere?

714
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:46,273
It was me he tripped.

715
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:48,208
I have to keep those boys
where I can see 'em.

716
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,009
Well, I can't come home
every weekend, for God's sake.

717
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,910
Well, if you can't be bothered,
well, then don't blame me

718
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,313
- for what them boys get up to.
- That's not what I'm saying.

719
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:56,015
You can't just throw that one...

720
00:35:58,451 --> 00:35:59,586
Right, that's 6:00 a.m., fellas.

721
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,554
That's youse done.

722
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:04,524
Housewives, it's thanks to

723
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:06,559
Sparkle biological
washing powder

724
00:36:06,593 --> 00:36:08,161
that their whites
are whiter than ever.

725
00:36:08,194 --> 00:36:09,962
They've discovered
for themselves...

726
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:11,431
What have I done?

727
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:17,370
All right, Mummy?

728
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:20,340
Why do you always get sad
when a letter comes?

729
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:24,311
Remember, our
washing powder is biological.

730
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:28,281
Come on, Mr. Slowpoke.

731
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:30,183
Get inside now.

732
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:32,918
And finally a switch in
the medal positions this week.

733
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:34,387
Well, Mr. Buddy,
you may not have improved

734
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:37,056
your handwriting in maths,
for which this once,

735
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:39,192
in lieu of your intensified
efforts, we will be willing

736
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:40,859
to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

737
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:43,463
but you have
improved your score.

738
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:47,300
So, in second position
is Buddy.

753
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:51,197
When is your next chance?

754
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:54,234
We have to do a project
about the moon landing.

755
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,369
What, did those boys
not come back from that?

756
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:59,539
They did, and now we have to
cut things out of the papers

757
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:01,374
and explain how they got there.

758
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:03,510
If they did get there,
if they did get to the moon.

759
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:05,077
It's not what it says here.

760
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,247
God doesn't like it.

761
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,082
And I watched every night, too,
that they were up there,

762
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:11,984
and how did I never see
Mike Collins

763
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:14,354
in the mother ship
doing his orbit?

764
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:16,222
Sure you would have seen
the shape of Columbus

765
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:17,690
against the light of the moon.

766
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:19,426
No, that's 'cause mostly
he was on the dark side.

767
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,128
Exactly. It's the side that
Lucifer hangs his shillelagh.

768
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:24,497
What? No, look, he was
on the dark side of the moon

769
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:26,566
most of the time where
we couldn't see him, you know,

770
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,135
while he was doing his orbit,
and then maybe, you know,

771
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:31,171
just before he was due
to come round the corner,

772
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,005
you had to go in for your tea.

773
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:35,308
If I could come up with
something smart about that,

774
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:37,310
maybe I could
stay up at the top desk

775
00:38:37,343 --> 00:38:39,179
and wait till
she gets back there.

776
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:41,147
Or you could say the moon's
made of green cheese

777
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:42,715
and drop down a place,
if you wanted.

778
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,184
Or you could do
the project together,

779
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:45,984
you and the young lady.

780
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:47,253
You'd get the same marks

781
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:49,489
and maybe end up
on the same seat together.

782
00:38:49,522 --> 00:38:51,257
But how do I even talk to her?

783
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,160
- ♪ How do you handle a woman? ♪

No running, thank you.

801
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:01,026
Thanks.

802
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:03,563
Well done on your maths.

803
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:05,265
Thanks.

804
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:07,500
Have you gone to the moon yet?

805
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:10,537
Do you want to, with me?

806
00:40:11,504 --> 00:40:15,040
It'll save you getting cold
waiting outside our house.

807
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:20,547
Hey, Romeo, come on!

808
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,715
We have work to do.

809
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:24,817
Operation Steal The Chocolate.

810
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,586
It's simple.
We go into the shop

811
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,454
and keep Mr. Singh talking
down by the fridge.

812
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,557
He has to move the boxes
round at the bottom

813
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,858
to get me a Lemon Mivvi.

814
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:33,793
His head'll be down
part of the time.

815
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:35,595
You stay at the front
of the shop,

816
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:39,165
and when you see he's not
looking, you make a sweep.

817
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:41,434
- What's a sweep?
- A big grab for all the chocolate bars

818
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,303
on that low shelf
near the till.

819
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:45,438
Sure he'll know they've been
nicked if there's a big gap.

820
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:47,574
I thought you said
we'd just do a couple,

821
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:49,175
so he'd never even notice.

822
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,710
I don't want lifted
by the police.

823
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:51,844
All right, all right.

824
00:40:51,878 --> 00:40:53,479
- All clear.
- No sweep.

825
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:54,881
Just a small grab, okay?

826
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,749
I might be able to swipe you
a chocolate mousse

827
00:40:56,783 --> 00:40:58,518
- at the same time.
- Okay.

828
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:04,624
- Hello, Mr. Singh.
- Hello, Moira. Hello, Buddy.

829
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:06,292
- Hello, Mr. Singh.
- Good to see youse.

830
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:07,760
Please may I have
a Lemon Mivvi?

831
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:09,228
Lemon Mivvi coming right up.

832
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:11,464
Just need to move
a few wee boxes.

833
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:12,432
Hey!

834
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:14,400
- He's seen us!
- Come here, you wee buggers!

835
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,569
- I know who you are!
- No, he doesn't!

836
00:41:16,603 --> 00:41:19,872
Well, your woman
will tell him anyway!

837
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,507
- You proud of yourself?
- It was Moira.

838
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,675
Get in there.

839
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,911
Get off that blinking road
or you'll kill somebody!

840
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:26,746
She's gonna tell on us!

841
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:28,881
She says anything,
she's done for!

842
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:30,583
I know who youse are!

843
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:38,157
What have you got?

844
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,727
You're joking me.

845
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,228
It's all I could see.

846
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,763
Turkish Delight?

847
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:45,531
Who the hell
eats Turkish Delight?

848
00:41:45,565 --> 00:41:47,867
- Do you eat Turkish Delight?
- No.

849
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,435
I don't like it.

850
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:51,938
Nobody likes it.

851
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:54,273
- It's all they had.
- Are you blind?

852
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:55,742
I had to think quickly.

853
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:57,276
Not quickly enough.

854
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,912
There was Flakes and Crunchies.

855
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:02,448
All you need is an in and out
with a fast hand,

856
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:04,784
and then the Milky Bars
are on me.

857
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,486
I'm not sure
you're cut out for this.

858
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,255
Hey, Buddy, your da's home.

859
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:12,392
- Sure it's only Wednesday.
- He came in a taxi.

860
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,294
- And you, too!
- What?

861
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:17,530
Keep your mouth shut.

862
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:24,737
When did you write to them?

863
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,272
None of your business.

864
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:27,607
Just tell me.
When did you write to them?

865
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,975
- It's a simple question.
- None of your business.

866
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:30,710
Just give me a simple answer.

867
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:33,346
- I'm not getting interrogated.
- When did you write to them?

868
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:34,814
When the last receipt
came through.

869
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,883
I knew it was the last one
'cause for three bloody years

870
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,384
I've been counting
them envelopes

871
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:39,819
coming through that door,
and there wasn't

872
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,287
so much as a thank-you
with this one.

873
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,922
It's the taxman,
for God's sake.

874
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:44,424
Who do you expect,
Father Christmas?

875
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,292
We've been
scrimping and saving,

876
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:48,561
and they hadn't the good grace
as to say, "That's it.

877
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:50,263
You're done.
You're in the clear."

878
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:52,265
So what'd you say to them
in your letter?

879
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:55,234
I said I wanted
a full official declaration

880
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:57,437
that my husband was
in the clear a hundred percent

881
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,273
on all back taxes,
and that they acknowledged

882
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:02,842
that everything was shipshape
and above board,

883
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,310
and that my family's good name

884
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:06,279
wasn't on
some credit risk list.

885
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:08,781
- Christ. Christ the night.
- What?

886
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:14,353
No.

887
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:16,422
- No.
- Yes, yes, oh, yes.

888
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:18,658
They've decided... thanks
to acting on your request...

889
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:21,427
they've decided to go back
further into my accounts

890
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:23,596
and say that I owe
another 572 pound,

891
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:25,331
which based on
current earnings,

892
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:27,033
should take another
five years to pay off.

893
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:29,001
So it's a handy wee letter
you sent, wasn't it?

894
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:30,536
You bugger!

895
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,505
Oh, you're a lying bugger!

896
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:34,974
Aye, that's right, believe the
taxman before you believe me!

897
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,510
'Cause I know you!

898
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:40,913
Your work won't be too pleased

899
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:43,683
with you skipping off
in the week.

900
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:44,917
I'll work the weekend.

901
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:46,953
Ah, when's that job finish?

902
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:48,588
This one's nearly done.

903
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,357
What, there's another one
over there, is there?

904
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,959
Aye. Big one.

905
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:54,694
A long one.

906
00:43:54,727 --> 00:43:56,763
They're asking some of the boys
to move over permanent.

907
00:43:56,796 --> 00:43:59,565
Offering accommodation
because of the time involved.

908
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,867
Couple of years.

909
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,668
Building a hospital.

910
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:04,904
Your father has to go
to the hospital.

911
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,405
You talk to him about it.

912
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:08,307
Won't talk to me about doctors.

913
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:09,442
Is that right?

914
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:11,444
Ah, it's just a couple of days.

915
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,613
A wee test for the lungs.

916
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:15,915
It's all that bloody time
over in Leicester.

917
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:18,050
- Where's that?
- In England.

918
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:19,719
Is that near where Daddy works?

919
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:22,421
Nah, your daddy works near,
uh, London, the Big Smoke.

920
00:44:22,455 --> 00:44:24,791
This was in the countryside.

921
00:44:24,824 --> 00:44:26,325
What were you doing?

922
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:27,693
I was a coal miner.

923
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:29,729
You've done a lot
of different jobs, Pop.

924
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:30,997
You can say that again.

925
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,800
Yeah, none of them lasted
more than a week.

926
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,036
My mother's worried about you.

927
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,405
Your mother's worried about you.

928
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:43,609
Well, Granny's always worried
about something, isn't she?

929
00:44:43,643 --> 00:44:46,546
Ah, well, your granny's
a very caring person.

930
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:48,815
Sometimes it affects her nerves.

931
00:44:48,848 --> 00:44:50,049
Like your mommy.

932
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:52,852
Mommy's worried, too, isn't she?

933
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:59,692
Daddy, are we gonna
have to leave Belfast?

934
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:04,697
All right, Buddy,
that's me away, then.

935
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,365
I'll see you
when I get back next week.

936
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:07,900
In you come, girls.
Catherine. Quinn.

937
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:09,936
Come on in, girls. You can help
put the pencils out.

938
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,838
Be good, son.

939
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:13,105
If you can't be good?

940
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,541
Be careful.

941
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,044
Seems like only yesterday

942
00:45:18,077 --> 00:45:20,613
you and me were
in school together.

943
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:23,583
You're gonna need to stay
away from my family.

944
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:25,785
That's big talk
for a fella who's never here.

945
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:28,155
You can rely on me
to be here when it matters.

946
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:29,856
I hope your timing's good.

947
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:32,859
Things get out of hand
pretty quick round these parts.

948
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,830
Do you know the problem
with men like you?

949
00:45:37,864 --> 00:45:40,032
You think you're better
than the rest of us.

950
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:43,703
And the problem with men like
you is you know you're not.

951
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:47,807
We'll keep it simple.

952
00:45:49,075 --> 00:45:51,477
You're with us
or you're against us.

953
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:52,745
Clock's ticking.

954
00:45:52,778 --> 00:45:53,613
You're a soft touch!

955
00:45:53,646 --> 00:45:56,048
Time for real Protestants
to step up!

956
00:45:56,082 --> 00:45:57,650
Ach, you're no real Protestant.

957
00:45:57,683 --> 00:46:00,653
You're a jumped-up gangster
and always were.

958
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:19,438
There's peelers about.
Hey, watch it, youse two.

959
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:20,940
Quick.

960
00:46:28,948 --> 00:46:31,918
Ah, look.
There you are now, son.

961
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:33,953
There he is now.

962
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:38,858
Hello, son.

963
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:41,194
The police officer here
just wants a wee word with you.

964
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:42,929
There seems to be
a-a wee bit of confusion

965
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:45,464
about something that happened
at Mr. Singh's.

966
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:47,700
Go on, sit down there, now.

967
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:55,741
Do you know why I'm here, son?

968
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:57,944
Don't lie to me.

969
00:46:57,977 --> 00:46:59,979
A very serious crime
has been committed

970
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:01,547
down in Mr. Singh's shop.

971
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,849
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

972
00:47:06,886 --> 00:47:09,555
All the best, now,
and give my regards to Josie.

973
00:47:09,588 --> 00:47:11,824
- I will do.
- I do like a man in a uniform.

974
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:14,227
Was he in there long?

975
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:17,164
Apples'll grow again, should
they grow on a gooseberry tree!

976
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:18,998
I didn't even
eat the chocolate!

977
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:22,568
No, I won't
be here when it's over.

978
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:24,271
You're asking me
to wait an hour to find out

979
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:26,273
if I'm going to be
a wife or a widow.

980
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:28,107
I say it's too long to wait.

981
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:29,742
- I won't do it.
- Amy...

982
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:31,978
I mean it.
If you won't go with me now,

983
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:34,747
I'll be on that train
when it leaves here.

984
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:37,550
I've got to stay.

985
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,585
No, you're not listening to me.

986
00:47:39,618 --> 00:47:41,687
I am listening. I am listening.

987
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:43,190
Would you, would you listen
to me for a change?

988
00:47:43,223 --> 00:47:44,957
I'm trying to be practical
about this.

989
00:47:44,991 --> 00:47:46,859
Look, the police were here
today but their father wasn't,

990
00:47:46,892 --> 00:47:48,561
so, no, I'll not be
having any lectures

991
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:49,996
- from you, mister.
- Don't be like that.

992
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:51,864

Mrs. Ford, how you doing?

1012
00:48:57,164 --> 00:48:58,931
All the better
for seeing you, stranger.

1013
00:48:58,964 --> 00:49:00,966
- Welcome home.
- Ah, you're a silver-tongued charmer.

1014
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,669
- It takes one to know one.
- All right?

1015
00:49:03,702 --> 00:49:05,037
Ah, just the fella.

1016
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:06,772
Have you got a horse
for the 2:30 race?

1017
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:08,341
I have, but if I tell you,
the odds'll come down.

1018
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,810
Christ, I'm not gonna
bet the house.

1019
00:49:10,843 --> 00:49:12,812
Fancy Man, each way.
She'll get you a pint.

1020
00:49:12,845 --> 00:49:15,748
- Is that Paddy moving out?
- Poor Catholics have no choice.

1021
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,317
- It's a mad world.
- Well, get used to it.

1022
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,118
We all live there now.

1023
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:21,354
<i>Prize capture was a tanker</i>

1024
00:49:21,388 --> 00:49:24,191
<i>laden with
2,500 gallons of petrol.</i>

1025
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:26,792
<i>They'd also taken dozens
of crates of milk bottles</i>

1026
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:29,229
<i>from a passing truck and
dubbed the whole enterprise</i>

1027
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:30,729
<i>the Petrol Bomb Factory.</i>

1028
00:49:30,763 --> 00:49:33,166
Sure all the kids in
the street are going mad.

1029
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
What do you want me to do?

1030
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:37,237
You need to talk to them boys.

1031
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:45,278
How many was there?

1032
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:47,646
About ten of them.

1033
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,015
And what did your mate do?

1034
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:53,786
He said he wasn't joining
anything they belonged to.

1035
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:57,157
Then he gave the big one a dig
in the gob and ran like hell.

1036
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,125
So did I.

1037
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:00,960
Did they chase you?

1038
00:50:00,993 --> 00:50:02,995
Aye, but we got
a street ahead of them.

1039
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:05,365
Then we ran into me Uncle
Tony's and turned the corner

1040
00:50:05,398 --> 00:50:07,334
before they could see us.

1041
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:09,436
We put the heart across
me Uncle Tony.

1042
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:11,670
He was on the toilet,
doing his horses,

1043
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,207
and then he dropped his pencil
down the loo.

1044
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:18,077
You've delivered
for these boys before, aye?

1045
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,912
Mm-hmm.

1046
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:21,814
And you know it's not milk
they're putting

1047
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:24,284
back in them empty bottles?

1048
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:26,085
I do now, Daddy.

1049
00:50:28,188 --> 00:50:30,257
You were right to tell me.

1050
00:50:32,925 --> 00:50:35,094
Come here and hold this, son.

1051
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:37,930
Hold that there.

1052
00:50:42,135 --> 00:50:44,003
- You got that?
- Mm-hmm.

1053
00:50:44,036 --> 00:50:47,006
And amid more
citywide violence overnight,

1054
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,476
government figures issued today
reveal that Northern Ireland

1055
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:52,711
now has the highest rate
of unemployment in the UK.

1056
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:54,813
Here it is. Planet Earth.

1057
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,416
And do you know where that is?

1058
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:58,385
- Sydney.
- Australia?

1059
00:50:58,418 --> 00:50:59,985
Aye, that's right.

1060
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:01,787
- Do you know about it?
- Aye.

1061
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,490
They've got surfing
and weird football.

1062
00:51:03,523 --> 00:51:05,325
And they have kangaroos
on the barbecue.

1063
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:06,825
And the weather's good.

1064
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:08,461
Young Joe Turner's
down there, too.

1065
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:10,095
That's right.

1066
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,031
How do you fancy that?

1067
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:13,266
What?

1068
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,268
Moving over there
for a wee while.

1069
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:16,802
You're joking.

1070
00:51:16,835 --> 00:51:18,471
No. It's just down the side
a wee bit.

1071
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:20,207
It's ten and a half
thousand miles.

1072
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,509
Right, school, you two... now.

1073
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:29,949
We might as well be going to
the moon if we went down there.

1074
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:31,484
Sure, you've already
family there.

1075
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:32,851
One second cousin.

1076
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:34,086
And you've the phone.

1077
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:37,157
And a millionaire
to pay the bills?

1078
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,791
We could take trips back.

1079
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:40,893
And pay for it with what,
Scotch mist?

1080
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:42,995
Family could come over
for holidays.

1081
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:44,830
I didn't come up the loch
in a bubble.

1082
00:51:44,863 --> 00:51:46,098
There's no one from round here

1083
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:47,833
can afford the fare
to go down there.

1084
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:50,002
Or the time off work,
if they had any work.

1085
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:51,770
You just heard the bloody news.

1086
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:53,406
We have to do something.

1087
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,808

Aye, he can't neglect his work.

1105
00:52:49,061 --> 00:52:50,863
Sure, there's work here.

1106
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:53,098
Have you read the papers?

1107
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,034
You'd break my heart
to leave, but...

1108
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,835
- Come on!
- Here!

1109
00:52:56,869 --> 00:52:59,606
...you have to think of them.

1110
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:01,608
We can't all leave.

1111
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:03,376
There'd be nobody left
but the nutters.

1112
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,179
Aye, and nobody
to cook their tea,

1113
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:08,947
run messages
and wipe their arses.

1114
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:12,117
That'd make the violence stop
in about ten minutes.

1115
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:17,923
How could I leave Belfast?

1116
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:19,858
I wouldn't worry about it.

1117
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:22,061
The Irish were born for leaving.

1118
00:53:22,094 --> 00:53:25,097
Otherwise, the rest of
the world would have no pubs.

1119
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,568
It just needs half of us to stay

1120
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:30,537
so that the other half
can get sentimental

1121
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,072
about the ones that went.

1122
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:36,176
All the Irish need to survive
is a phone, a Guinness

1123
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:39,212
and the sheet music
to "Danny Boy."

1124
00:53:39,245 --> 00:53:41,614

you know that?

gave you for singing lessons.

All passengers
departing on the Heysham ferry

00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,504
should proceed
to the boarding area now.

1143
00:54:37,537 --> 00:54:39,972
Everybody's leaving home.

1144
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:42,175

00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:49,081
"Too long a sacrifice can make

Oh, is that what does it?

1147
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:53,051
Yeah, well, you don't usually
buy your wisdom

1148
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:54,654
with a walk in the park.

1149
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:57,157
Your heart has to explode.

1150
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,192
Mr. Philosopher.

1151
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:02,429
And when did your heart
ever explode?

1152
00:55:02,462 --> 00:55:05,698
That time I saw you
in those brown stockings.

1153
00:55:05,732 --> 00:55:09,135
Holy God.

1154
00:55:09,169 --> 00:55:11,371
- Aye.
- I remember that.

1155
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:15,040
It took me half the day

1156
00:55:15,073 --> 00:55:17,310
just staining my legs brown
with the tobacco water.

1157
00:55:17,343 --> 00:55:19,479
Then our Annie took
half the night

1158
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:22,582
to draw the seam up the back
of my legs with a pencil.

1159
00:55:22,615 --> 00:55:24,150
You couldn't understand why

1160
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:25,718
you couldn't get your hands
round them.

1161
00:55:25,752 --> 00:55:28,721
You thought it was magic.

1162
00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:31,491
It was magic.

1163
00:55:31,524 --> 00:55:36,061
When you've gray hair, people
think your heart never skipped.

1164
00:55:36,094 --> 00:55:37,697
Did yours ever skip?

1165
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,265
Aye, it danced a bloody jig

1166
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:41,066
every time you walked
in the room.

1167
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:42,469
Nah.

1168
00:55:42,502 --> 00:55:45,037
You were full of it then,
and you're full of it now.

1169
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,072
Come on. We may get on.

1170
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:50,610
Uh, Jimmy said he'd drive me

1171
00:55:50,643 --> 00:55:52,212
to the hospital in the morning.

1172
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:54,414
No, and I told him he would not.

1173
00:55:55,748 --> 00:55:58,218
I'm taking you in on the bus.

1174
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:00,553
I'm walking you in,
and when they're done,

1175
00:56:00,587 --> 00:56:04,056
you can be bloody sure
I'm walking you back out again.

1176
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:06,626
Do you hear me?

1177
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:08,461
I'm walking you home.

1178
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:09,729
Do you hear me?

1179
00:56:09,762 --> 00:56:12,365
Yeah, I hear you, missus.

1180
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:16,402
Sure, when did I not?

1181
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:33,553
Aldergrove bus going
in three minutes.

1182
00:56:33,586 --> 00:56:34,754
Last tickets now.

1183
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:36,523
The boss has been in touch.

1184
00:56:36,556 --> 00:56:38,258
They want me to stay on.

1185
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:40,660
A permanent job in England.

1186
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:43,396
Wanting me to move
into management.

1187
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,764
It's more money.

1188
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:46,232
Just let us through there.

1189
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:47,767
There's a house
that goes with it.

1190
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,335
We get it rent-free,

1191
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:52,104
with a chance to own it
if things go well.

1192
00:56:52,138 --> 00:56:54,072
A wee bit bigger
than what we have here.

1193
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:55,642
A room for each of the boys.

1194
00:56:55,675 --> 00:56:57,310
There's a wee garden, too.

1195
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,679
Are you allowed to play
football in that garden, Daddy?

1196
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,347
Aye, son.

1197
00:57:01,381 --> 00:57:03,650
If I say yes, there's
more money straightaway.

1198
00:57:03,683 --> 00:57:06,352
We could start getting on top
of that back tax now.

1199
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,087
This family's not gonna get
another chance like that

1200
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,356
in this town, not now.

1201
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,327
Hey, watch out
for that traffic there.

1202
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,297
I'm watching it now, Mammy.
It's okay.

1203
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,432
Come on, now. Two minutes.

1204
00:57:19,465 --> 00:57:22,468
Get on board if you're coming.
Last tickets now.

1205
00:57:26,873 --> 00:57:29,442
Sounds like
they really want you.

1206
00:57:33,746 --> 00:57:36,114
What do you want?

1207
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,686
I want my family with me.

1208
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:43,556
I want you.

1209
00:57:47,427 --> 00:57:49,596
You and me,

1210
00:57:49,629 --> 00:57:52,632
we've known each other
since we were toddlers.

1211
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:55,868
We've known this street

1212
00:57:55,902 --> 00:57:58,705
and every street round it
all our lives.

1213
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:01,541
And every man,
woman and child that lives

1214
00:58:01,574 --> 00:58:04,644
in every bloody house,
whether we like it or not.

1215
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:08,314
I like it.

1216
00:58:09,582 --> 00:58:12,652
And you say you've
a wee garden for them boys?

1217
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,392
But here, they can play
wherever the hell they like,

1218
00:58:19,425 --> 00:58:21,394
'cause everybody knows them,

1219
00:58:21,427 --> 00:58:25,231
everybody likes them
and everybody looks after them.

1220
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:29,168
If we go over the water,

1221
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:32,605
them people's not gonna
understand a word we say.

1222
00:58:33,473 --> 00:58:36,743
And half of them,
they'll take the hand out of us

1223
00:58:36,776 --> 00:58:39,345
for sounding different.

1224
00:58:39,379 --> 00:58:43,282
And the other half,
they'll hate us

1225
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:46,386
'cause men here are killing
their young sons on our streets.

1226
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:49,389
They'll think
we don't give a shite.

1227
00:58:49,422 --> 00:58:52,191
And you think they're gonna
welcome us with open arms?

1228
00:58:52,225 --> 00:58:55,194
What, and say, "Come on in.

1229
00:58:55,228 --> 00:58:58,231
Well done for stealing
the house off of us"?

1230
00:58:59,298 --> 00:59:01,467
Things change.

1231
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:06,606
Aye. They do.

1232
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:12,412
We need to decide by Christmas.

1233
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:16,416
You need to decide by Christmas.

1234
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,621
You're coming back,
aren't you, Daddy?

1235
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:25,692
You look after your mummy.

1236
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:27,960
Be good. If you can't be good...

1237
00:59:27,994 --> 00:59:31,464
"And if you can't be good,
be careful."

1238
00:59:32,065 --> 00:59:33,499
Right, off we go.

1239
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:36,436
Aldergrove Airport,
ladies and gents.

1240
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,252
We'll talk on the phone, okay?

1241
00:59:54,754 --> 00:59:56,522
Give me a ring.

1242
00:59:56,556 --> 00:59:58,758
Tell me when you've got there.

1243
01:00:10,303 --> 01:00:12,638
♪ I'm stranded ♪

1244
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:20,646
♪ At the edge of the world ♪

1245
01:00:24,016 --> 01:00:28,354
♪ It's a world I don't know ♪

1246
01:00:28,988 --> 01:00:32,325
♪ Got nowhere to go ♪

1247
01:00:34,026 --> 01:00:37,363
♪ Feels like I'm stranded ♪

1248
01:00:44,403 --> 01:00:46,672
I caught you looking
at Dr. Kildare.

1249
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:49,842
Right. You can talk.

1250
01:00:49,876 --> 01:00:51,644
Have you wrote to Santa?

1251
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:53,446
Oh, he has,
but Santa's explained

1252
01:00:53,479 --> 01:00:55,047
that money's
a bit tight this year,

1253
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:56,983
so he's not to expect too much.

1254
01:00:57,016 --> 01:00:58,785
Sure, Santa has plenty
of surplus

1255
01:00:58,818 --> 01:01:01,053
if you talk to
the people in the know.

1256
01:01:01,087 --> 01:01:02,955
Your health is all you need

1257
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:05,525
- for a Christmas present.
- Ah. Well, you've the right one

1258
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:07,360
to keep you cheerful here,
haven't you, Pop?

1259
01:01:07,393 --> 01:01:09,428
You tell your mammy
to stop her cheek,

1260
01:01:09,462 --> 01:01:11,063
or I'm not taking you
to the show.

1261
01:01:11,097 --> 01:01:12,431
What show's that?

1262
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:13,833
I don't know. I think there's

1263
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:15,368
Christmas carols in it, though.

1264
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:16,936
Oh, that's
me waterworks.

1265
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,805
And you, behave yourself.

1266
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:20,339
Don't be annoying your pop.

1267
01:01:20,373 --> 01:01:21,841
Don't be asking
for any Christmas presents.

1268
01:01:21,874 --> 01:01:23,009
He's no money, either.

1269
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:25,945
Taxman's got it, like ours.

1270
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:27,647
Ach, don't worry.

1271
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,750
Your mammy will persuade Santa
to bring some presents.

1272
01:01:30,783 --> 01:01:32,985
Ach. Don't think so, Pop.

1273
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:34,554
I always know
when there's no money.

1274
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:35,888
<i>Hello?</i>

1275
01:01:35,922 --> 01:01:38,057
- It's the rent man.
- I'll get it, Mam.

1276
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,826
Shut your mouth.

1277
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:42,628
Is your mum in there, wee man?

1278
01:01:42,662 --> 01:01:43,696
Nobody's here.

1279
01:01:45,464 --> 01:01:47,834
Oh, that puts me in mind
of a great wee system

1280
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:50,536
we had in the old days
for paying the rent.

1281
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,606
The rent man would come round
and collect the money

1282
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,875
for every house
in the whole street,

1283
01:01:55,908 --> 01:01:57,810
and once he had done

1284
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:01,113
and all the rent books
were marked up to date,

1285
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:03,683
one of the boys would
hold him up at gunpoint

1286
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:05,384
in the back entry

1287
01:02:05,418 --> 01:02:07,453
and take all the money
back off him,

1288
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:09,989
and then he'd hand it
straight back

1289
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:12,024
to all the residents
in the street,

1290
01:02:12,058 --> 01:02:14,594
with a little commission
for the service.

1291
01:02:14,627 --> 01:02:18,397
Yeah, it was
a very effective system.

1292
01:02:18,431 --> 01:02:20,766
And the rent man was
so good about it in the end

1293
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,502
that eventually they cut him in
for a wee bit, too,

1294
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:26,005
and everybody was happy.

1295
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:28,708
Except for the council,
I suppose.

1296
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:31,677
His work's giving my da a house
in England now if he wants one.

1297
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:33,880
It's got a garden
and everything,

1298
01:02:33,913 --> 01:02:36,816
and two toilets, and they're
both inside the house.

1299
01:02:36,849 --> 01:02:39,186
There's nothing wrong
with an outside toilet,

1300
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:41,053
except on an aeroplane.

1301
01:02:42,788 --> 01:02:45,658
My ma says,
if we went across the water,

1302
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:48,027
they wouldn't understand
the way we talk.

1303
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,562
That shouldn't be
a problem, son.

1304
01:02:49,595 --> 01:02:51,564
I've been married
to your granny for 50 years.

1305
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:54,634
I've never understood
a word she's said.

1306
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:56,903
And if they can't
understand you,

1307
01:02:56,936 --> 01:03:00,606
then they're not listening,
and that's their problem.

1308
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,175
You know, when I was
in Leicester,

1309
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:03,910
they said the same thing
about me.

1310
01:03:03,943 --> 01:03:07,580
You know, so I put on
a different bloody accent

1311
01:03:07,613 --> 01:03:09,448
every day just to annoy them.

1312
01:03:09,482 --> 01:03:11,151
They never knew who I was.

1313
01:03:11,184 --> 01:03:12,718
But I did,

1314
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:16,522
and that's the only one
who needs to know.

1315
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,192
You know who you are, don't you?

1316
01:03:19,226 --> 01:03:20,960
Yes, Pop.

1317
01:03:20,993 --> 01:03:25,498
You're Buddy from Belfast 15,

1318
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:27,466
where everybody knows you

1319
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,069
and your pop looks out for you

1320
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:31,871
and your mummy looks out
for you,

1321
01:03:31,904 --> 01:03:34,607
your daddy looks out for you,
your granny looks out for you,

1322
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,942
your brother looks out for you,

1323
01:03:35,975 --> 01:03:39,612
and the whole family
looks out for you.

1324
01:03:39,645 --> 01:03:44,550
And wherever you go
and whatever you become,

1325
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:47,187
that'll always be the truth.

1326
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,089
And that thought
will keep you safe.

1327
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,692
It'll keep you happy.

1328
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:54,261
Will you remember that for me?

1329
01:03:54,294 --> 01:03:56,929
- Yes, Pop.
- Aye.

1330
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:59,232
Fine man you are.

1331
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:01,734
Now, forget about

1332
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:04,870
what your father
and your mother want.

1333
01:04:04,904 --> 01:04:06,772
What do you want?

1334
01:04:07,473 --> 01:04:10,743
I want you
and my granny to come, too.

1335
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:31,630
<i>Hear me.</i>

1336
01:04:32,265 --> 01:04:35,135
Hear me.

1337
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:37,870
I am here tonight to warn you

1338
01:04:37,903 --> 01:04:41,874
that you have yet
a chance and hope

1339
01:04:41,907 --> 01:04:43,743
of escaping my fate.

1340
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:46,078
Who wears chains that size?

1341
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:48,748
Granny, you're not
allowed to talk in the theater.

1342
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:50,583
It makes one heck of a necklace.

1343
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:53,220
You were always
a good friend to me.

1344
01:04:53,253 --> 01:04:55,222
Thank you.

1345
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:58,924
You will be haunted.

1346
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,332
Is this the chance and hope
you mentioned, Jacob?

1347
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:07,234
It is.

1348
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:09,602
I think I'd rather not.

1349
01:05:09,635 --> 01:05:11,804
Oh, I'm bloody well sure
you wouldn't.

1350
01:05:26,852 --> 01:05:29,722
When will Pop get out
of the hospital?

1351
01:05:29,755 --> 01:05:33,059
When the doctors say
his lungs are fine.

1352
01:05:33,092 --> 01:05:35,661
When Pop went to England
to be a coal miner,

1353
01:05:35,694 --> 01:05:37,663
did you go with him?

1354
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:41,834
Did you want to?

1355
01:05:45,205 --> 01:05:47,573
Neither do I.

1356
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:52,111
Has your father said
what he's doing?

1357
01:05:53,779 --> 01:05:57,184
He says it has to get decided
by Christmas.

1358
01:05:57,217 --> 01:05:58,684
When's he coming back?

1359
01:05:58,717 --> 01:05:59,819
At the weekend.

1360
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:01,354
We're going to the pictures.

1361
01:06:01,388 --> 01:06:03,856
He's taking us to
<i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</i>

1362
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:05,724
What in the name of God is that?

1363
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:06,692
It's a flying car.

1364
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:08,261
Oh, God, I've heard it all.

1365
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:11,198
It goes over a cliff, and you
nearly fall out of your seat.

1366
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:12,698
Do you want to come?

1367
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:14,934
It'll be company for you
till my pop's home.

1368
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:16,969
If God had wanted me
to see flying cars,

1369
01:06:17,002 --> 01:06:19,172
I'd have been born
with blinking wings.

1370
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:22,942
You love your films, don't you?

1371
01:06:23,776 --> 01:06:28,714
I was a great one for the
pictures when I was your age.

1372
01:06:28,747 --> 01:06:31,117
I used to think you could
climb right inside the screen

1373
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:34,120
and visit all those
strange places you saw.

1374
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:36,423
Like that one in that film.

1375
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,225
What was that, uh...?

1376
01:06:38,258 --> 01:06:39,658
Uh, <i>Lost Horizons.</i>

1377
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:41,294
- Did you ever see that?
- No.

1378
01:06:41,328 --> 01:06:43,196
What was the name
of the place, Granny?

1379
01:06:45,165 --> 01:06:46,732
Shangri-La.

1380
01:06:46,765 --> 01:06:48,667
That's what they called it.

1381
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:50,903
Did you ever go there?

1382
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:57,877
There were no roads
to Shangri-La

1383
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,646
from our part of Belfast.

1384
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:04,417
So, will you go one day?

1385
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,068
What? Where do they think
they're going?

1386
01:07:23,102 --> 01:07:24,803
Look out!

1387
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:35,482
What's happening?

1388
01:07:35,515 --> 01:07:37,384
Look!

1389
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:38,918
- Oh!
- Look at that!

1390
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:41,787
It's fantastic.

1391
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,822

1392
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:47,793

Sit down for
a few minutes here.

1426
01:08:54,361 --> 01:08:56,895
We've a wee word
to have with you.

1427
01:08:59,132 --> 01:09:03,068
Buddy, uh, Mum and I want
to talk to you about something,

1428
01:09:03,102 --> 01:09:06,139
something that we might
have to do as a family.

1429
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:09,875
You know the way your dad's
over in England

1430
01:09:09,908 --> 01:09:12,545
and he's been working
over there for quite a while?

1431
01:09:12,579 --> 01:09:15,814
Well, we were thinking that,
uh, you know,

1432
01:09:15,848 --> 01:09:18,518
maybe we'd all go as a family
and go live there.

1433
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:24,023
And, um, your dad's seen
a really nice wee house,

1434
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:26,925
and it's got
a lovely garden and...

1435
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:28,461
Play football, Buddy.

1436
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:30,297
- Aye.
- There's loads of room there.

1437
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,232
More room than we have here.

1438
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:34,434
- I don't want to go to England!
- Could you switch that off?

1439
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:35,934
I don't want to go to England!

1440
01:09:35,968 --> 01:09:37,069
It's all right, darling.

1441
01:09:37,102 --> 01:09:38,438
- Hey, it's okay.
- It's all right.

1442
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:40,373
I'll have no friends
and no cousins,

1443
01:09:40,407 --> 01:09:42,975
and I won't be able
to see Catherine at school!

1444
01:09:43,008 --> 01:09:44,843
Hey, listen, you'll make new
friends, and you're gonna have

1445
01:09:44,877 --> 01:09:46,313
a big garden
to play football in.

1446
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:47,880
I don't care about the garden!

1447
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:49,316
I want my granny and my pop,

1448
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:51,618
and I want to do my project
on going to the moon

1449
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:53,620
and get on the first desk,
and I don't want to

1450
01:09:53,653 --> 01:09:55,221
- have to talk funny.
- Hey, hey, Buddy.

1451
01:09:55,255 --> 01:09:57,022
And I don't want to forget
what road I have to

1452
01:09:57,056 --> 01:09:58,224
- go down when I'm dead.
- That's enough now, darling.

1453
01:09:58,258 --> 01:10:00,059
No one's asking you
to talk funny.

1454
01:10:00,092 --> 01:10:01,594
- No decision's been made yet.
- It's all right. Exactly.

1455
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:03,229
No, we were just trying to see
what everyone thought first.

1456
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,030
- You're just overtired.
- Exactly. Yeah.

1457
01:10:05,064 --> 01:10:07,900
I don't want to leave Belfast!

1458
01:10:33,259 --> 01:10:35,928
Let's just leave it
till Easter.

1459
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:38,665
- See where we are then.
- Aye.

1460
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:41,066
These boys are suffering.

1461
01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:45,138
I don't think we've got
till Easter.

1462
01:10:48,107 --> 01:10:51,043
I don't think you and me
have got till Easter, either.

1463
01:10:56,316 --> 01:10:58,984
Well, come home.

1464
01:10:59,017 --> 01:11:01,187
We'll fight this together.

1465
01:11:02,087 --> 01:11:04,056
Kids the same age as ours

1466
01:11:04,089 --> 01:11:06,292
are getting killed
around the corner.

1467
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:10,896
Well, we'll be careful.

1468
01:11:12,265 --> 01:11:15,235
You can't be with them
24 hours a day.

1469
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:18,904
You can't take away
their childhood, either.

1470
01:11:28,181 --> 01:11:32,218
You know, whatever happens...

1471
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:37,590
...what you've done
with these two,

1472
01:11:37,624 --> 01:11:39,925
it's phenomenal.

1473
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,997
What are you talking about?

1474
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:48,535
You raised them.

1475
01:11:50,303 --> 01:11:52,037
Not me.

1476
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:54,707
Not us.

01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:56,543
You.

1478
01:11:58,745 --> 01:12:00,979
Thank you.

1479
01:12:04,184 --> 01:12:06,419

by Easter.

01:15:20,913 --> 01:15:22,615
Take it easy, man!

1546
01:15:22,649 --> 01:15:23,916
We don't want any trouble!

1547
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,652
Oh, for God's sake, leave it!

1548
01:15:25,685 --> 01:15:27,186
Come on, let's go!

1549
01:15:28,554 --> 01:15:30,256
This city belongs
to the Protestants!

1550
01:15:30,289 --> 01:15:31,891
Get yourself something.

1551
01:15:31,924 --> 01:15:33,793
- What?
- Whatever you need.

1552
01:15:37,363 --> 01:15:39,332
Washing powder!

1553
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:41,534
Lock the doors! Lock the doors!

1554
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,477
Mammy! Mammy!

1555
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:52,979
Here, what the hell's going on?

1556
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:54,447
Oh, Mammy!

1557
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,982
We're looting the supermarket.

1558
01:15:56,015 --> 01:15:57,417
Where did you get that?

1559
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,552
I told you, we're looting
the supermarket.

1560
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:00,920
You're what?

1561
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:03,189
You wait right there, young man.

1562
01:16:06,959 --> 01:16:09,595
Why did you take
that washing powder?

1563
01:16:09,629 --> 01:16:11,597
It's biological.

1564
01:16:22,608 --> 01:16:23,976
Come on.

1565
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,412
Move! Move it!

1566
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:30,383
You watch yourselves.

1567
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:33,786
Now, you put that back.

1568
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:34,987
Do you hear me?

1569
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:36,956
And if you ever,
ever do anything

1570
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:38,491
like that again,
I will kill you.

1571
01:16:38,524 --> 01:16:40,359
Do you hear me?
And you, young madam,

1572
01:16:40,393 --> 01:16:42,562
if you ever drag my son
into something like this again,

1573
01:16:42,595 --> 01:16:45,898
I will beat you black and blue
until you never get home again.

1574
01:16:45,932 --> 01:16:47,533
Do you hear me?

1575
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:49,736
All right? Put it back I said.

1576
01:16:49,769 --> 01:16:51,304
Hey, woman!

1577
01:16:51,337 --> 01:16:52,739
We don't put things back.

1578
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:54,874
That's not the statement
we're trying to make.

1579
01:16:54,907 --> 01:16:57,343
Billy, come on.
The army are coming. Come on!

1580
01:16:57,376 --> 01:16:59,512
Out! Go on, get out!

1581
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,914
- Out!
- All right, all right.

1582
01:17:01,948 --> 01:17:04,283
Come on!

1583
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:08,287
Clear the street!

1584
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:09,622
Clear the street now!

1585
01:17:09,655 --> 01:17:12,625
Tear gas and rubber bullets
will be used!

1586
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:14,861
We're clearing this area!
Move out the way now!

1587
01:17:14,894 --> 01:17:16,763
- Time to get out of here.
- Don't try anything.

1588
01:17:16,796 --> 01:17:18,731
So you two are going
to guarantee safe passage

1589
01:17:18,765 --> 01:17:20,032
for me and my men.

1590
01:17:20,066 --> 01:17:21,467
If you try to run,

1591
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:23,302
I'll put a bullet
in your son's head.

1592
01:17:29,976 --> 01:17:32,044
Ah, here he comes,
the Lone Ranger.

1593
01:17:32,078 --> 01:17:34,714
Clear this area right now!

1594
01:17:34,747 --> 01:17:37,784
I can see your kind needs
a little discipline.

1595
01:17:37,817 --> 01:17:39,786
You let them go now.

1596
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,088
No, I think if I do,

1597
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:44,757
one of them soldiers
is gonna take my head off.

1598
01:17:45,725 --> 01:17:47,894
If they don't, I will.

1599
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:51,597
Over their dead bodies.

1600
01:17:58,771 --> 01:18:01,407
Folks always have
a problem with change.

1601
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,943
But you'd better get
used to it, mister.

1602
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:07,613
People like me
run this town now.

1603
01:18:07,647 --> 01:18:11,317
And it's people like you
that bring us all down.

It's gonna be all right.

1631
01:20:28,054 --> 01:20:32,692
I'll talk to the committee,
get this fixed.

1632
01:20:32,725 --> 01:20:35,461
There'll be no more bother.

1633
01:20:38,898 --> 01:20:43,203
I caught sight of my face
in that shop window

1634
01:20:43,236 --> 01:20:45,238
when I was running
down the street

1635
01:20:45,272 --> 01:20:47,773
and dragging them poor kids
behind me.

1636
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:54,046
And I was looking
in the mirror just now...

1637
01:20:55,915 --> 01:20:57,950
...at that same face.

1638
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,656
And I asked myself...

1639
01:21:05,658 --> 01:21:08,027
"What the hell am I doing?"

1640
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:19,505
And then I was sick.

1641
01:21:21,341 --> 01:21:24,577
Like I am every morning now.

1642
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:35,521
And I realized...

1643
01:21:39,959 --> 01:21:42,329
...I don't think

1644
01:21:42,362 --> 01:21:44,930
it really matters anymore.

1645
01:21:48,368 --> 01:21:50,803
So, tomorrow...

1646
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:56,876
...when Uncle Mack
and Auntie Violet come round...

1647
01:22:01,314 --> 01:22:03,883
...we're going to start
packing.

1648
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:22,068
You have no choice.

1649
01:22:22,101 --> 01:22:25,938
You know they're gonna come
for you, don't you?

1650
01:22:25,971 --> 01:22:30,076
And this time,
they'll send somebody serious.

1651
01:22:31,911 --> 01:22:34,713
Get yourselves to the moon.

1652
01:22:37,716 --> 01:22:43,022
London's only
one small step for a man.

1653
01:22:43,055 --> 01:22:46,859
Belfast will still be here
when you get back.

1654
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,962
Will you?

1655
01:22:52,665 --> 01:22:55,734
I'm going nowhere
you won't find me.

1656
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:12,751
And now to announce the winners

1657
01:23:12,785 --> 01:23:14,954
of our school moon project.

1658
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,759
Well, how'd it go with this?

1659
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:22,262
We got a gold star.

1660
01:23:22,295 --> 01:23:23,929
Ah, good on youse.

1661
01:23:23,963 --> 01:23:27,434
Now, tell me this,
seeing as you two will know...

1662
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:30,403
how do I get to the moon
with only ten pound,

1663
01:23:30,437 --> 01:23:33,240
three leaky umbrellas
and my bus pass?

1664
01:23:43,883 --> 01:23:47,052
See, there's an art
to an Ulster fry, son.

1665
01:23:47,086 --> 01:23:49,289
Mind you, I'm glad
your Aunt Violet's away

1666
01:23:49,322 --> 01:23:51,056
up the stairs there
with your ma.

1667
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,792
She keeps banging on now
about how Northern Ireland's

1668
01:23:53,826 --> 01:23:56,429
got the highest rates of
"chlomestremol" in the world.

1669
01:23:56,463 --> 01:23:58,331
Sure, I think it's great that

1670
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:00,267
we're world champions
at something.

1671
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:02,935
Do you mind answering that
for me, son,

1672
01:24:02,968 --> 01:24:04,837
while I've got this hot pan on?

1673
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:09,074
Is your mother in, son?

1674
01:24:14,947 --> 01:24:16,316
Watch yourself, missus!

1675
01:24:16,349 --> 01:24:17,750
Where's your white stick?

1676
01:24:17,783 --> 01:24:19,186
Are you all right, son?

1677
01:24:19,219 --> 01:24:21,120
Will you ask in there
for my daddy, please?

1678
01:24:21,154 --> 01:24:23,390
- Point out who he is.
- The farmer says, "No,"

1679
01:24:23,423 --> 01:24:25,258
and he goes,
"Do you have any bread?"

1680
01:24:27,294 --> 01:24:28,794
Excuse me.

1681
01:24:28,827 --> 01:24:30,297
Your little lad's here.

1682
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,097
What's that?

1683
01:25:05,265 --> 01:25:07,467
It was good to see him
one last time.

1684
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,768
There.

1685
01:25:18,545 --> 01:25:20,513
Oh, I'm done.

1686
01:25:20,547 --> 01:25:22,382
- Here. You're all right.
- Oh, dear.

1687
01:25:22,415 --> 01:25:24,049
Will!

1688
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,884
- You're all right.
- Yeah.

1689
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:27,254
Take that note up
to Mrs. Hewitt

1690
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:29,189
and get the wee message
for your granny.

1691
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:30,290
For her nerves.

1692
01:25:30,323 --> 01:25:32,825
Come on.

1693
01:25:45,171 --> 01:25:48,208
That was a lot of people
that came to see him today.

1694
01:25:48,241 --> 01:25:50,310
Aye.

1695
01:25:50,343 --> 01:25:52,412
He was very popular.

1696
01:25:52,445 --> 01:25:54,180
And he owed half of them money.

1697
01:25:58,485 --> 01:26:01,354
He used to help me
with my maths.

1698
01:26:09,529 --> 01:26:11,930
He was a very deep thinker.

1699
01:26:13,633 --> 01:26:16,303
A very deep thinker.

1700
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:18,338
Did he help you?

1701
01:26:22,509 --> 01:26:24,344
Yeah.

1702
01:26:25,578 --> 01:26:27,946
Yeah, he did help me.

1703
01:26:29,249 --> 01:26:31,817
He helped me a lot.

1704
01:26:35,087 --> 01:26:38,123
<i>"For now we see
through a glass, darkly;</i>

1705
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:40,193
"face-to-face:

1706
01:26:40,226 --> 01:26:44,331
"for now I-I know in part;
but then I shall know

1707
01:26:44,364 --> 01:26:47,233
"as also I am known.

1708
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:49,202
"For when I was a child,

1709
01:26:49,235 --> 01:26:52,572
"I spake as a child,
I understood as a child,

1710
01:26:52,605 --> 01:26:55,941
"I thought as a child:

1711
01:26:55,974 --> 01:26:59,945
but then I became a man and
I put away childish things."

1712
01:27:00,814 --> 01:27:06,486
So do not say in grief
that you are sorry he is gone,

1713
01:27:06,519 --> 01:27:10,623
but rather, say in thankfulness

1714
01:27:10,657 --> 01:27:14,126
you are grateful he was here.

1715
01:27:20,999 --> 01:27:22,602
God love him.

1716
01:27:22,635 --> 01:27:24,237
That wee dote.

1717
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,071
Ah, I'll miss him, now.

1718
