On the dot. Can't be late.

8
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,051

Can I help you, sir?

14
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:42,064
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,567

16
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,236

17
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,904
Nobody. Just me.

18
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:51,574
Boy, I can't take responsibility ...

19
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,493

traveling 3,500 miles alone.

20
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,745
I ... I ... I paid for this here
ticket, and it says ...

21
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,873
that you have to take me
to Seattle.

22
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,584
Don't you be smarting off
to me, boy.

23
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,712
With all due respect, sir,
I believe I earned the right.

24
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,672
I may have left my eyes
on Omaha Beach,

25
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,841
but I ain't asking no charity
from Uncle Sam.

26
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:11,176
I got a job waiting
for me in Seattle.

27
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:13,846

at the O.C. At Clarkfield,

45
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,083
and well, he plays
a mean jazz piano.

Dixie out his ass.

Sir.

49
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,882
Boy, are you blind?

50
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,592
Yes, sir. Since I was seven.

51
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,054
Well, let me help you out then.

52
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,265
This is a country band.

53
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,642

I love country music.

I ... I love the stories.

58
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,403
Uh, you know,
about fallin' in love ...

59
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,154

knock you around ...

60
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:56,198
and then the pressures
of the world on you so tough.

61
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:57,533
It ... It makes you
feel small.

62
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,034
You want to give your soul to God.

63
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,078
You might as well.
Your ass belongs to Him.

64
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,630

65
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:13,090
Last time I checked.

66
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,646
Okay. Come on in.

I'll show him inside ...

Don't mess with me, Q.
He can come in, but not you.

but mama ain't finished yet.

178
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:19,748
For the first time anywhere,

179
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,793
let's hear it for "The McSon Trio!"

♪ The monkey thought that
everything was on the square ♪

182
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,175
Ray, when you coming out?

183
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,510
In a minute.

184
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,472
Mama's got some more blackberry
cobbler for you, baby.

185
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,224

188
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,075
Marlene, if you're gonna
send us out on tour,

189
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,744
we're gonna need
more than $5 a day.

190
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:58,871
How come we can't get paid
after each gig?

191
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:01,123
Because you boys will spend
everything you make.

192
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:04,084
The club sends the checks
to me, so as I can bank them.

193
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:06,545
I just want to see
my own checks, that's all.

194
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,506
You don't see, Ray.
You're blind, baby.

195
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:11,258
Or did you forget?

196
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:15,346
Now, you want to go out on your
own and see how well you do?

197
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:26,148
Ray! Hey, Marlene, where's Ray?

198
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,151
He's in the back bedroom.
And wipe your feet.

199
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:38,827
Ray, uh, six-nine, where you at?
Six-nine. Six-nine.

200
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,498
Lionel Hampton just asked me
to go on the road with him, man!

201
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,124
Lionel Hampton, man!

202
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,001
- Sure he did.
- Then why you still here?

203
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:50,047
And dig this: His wife, she
kicked me off the tour bus.

204
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,967
Told me to come back when I
started shaving. You believe that?

205
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,178
Uh ... uh, Seven-oh, could you do me a
favor, man, and close that bag for me?

206
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,556
What's wrong? You got two hands.
You can close it yourself.

207
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,391
I got two feet, too.
Could you close it?

208
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:02,059
I got it.

209
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:05,688
Excuse me, sir!

210
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,275
Man, we're gonna be late.

211
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,027
I got to get my own place, Gossie.

212
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:16,031
Why? I mean,
you got free rent right now.

213
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,200
Like hell it's free rent.

214
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,539
Oh, come on, Ray.

215
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:25,541
Why you gonna mess
with a good thing?

216
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,877
All I'm saying is you keep
layin' that pipe with Marlene,

217
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,920
and I bet you she's gonna
make us all rich.

218
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:31,797

The McSon Trio!

226
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,081
They'll be back right here,

227
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:08,417
same time, same place, next week.

00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:16,258
Hey, baby, you sound more like
Nat than the King himself.

229
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:19,220
What's your name?

230
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:20,304
Ray Robinson.

231
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:21,680
Ray Robinson?

232
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:24,266
I'm Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

233
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,311
Oh, hey ... hey, hey, Jack!
How you doing, man?

234
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:28,562
Good. Oh, good.

235
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:30,272
How about us makin'
a record together?

236
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:32,399
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hell, yeah! Let's do that.

237
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:33,651
Can I help you?

238
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:34,777
I don't think so.

239
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:37,112
We're just talking
a little business.

240
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:40,366
Then you need to talk to me,
'cause I'm his manager.

241
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:42,159
Whichever way the wind blows.

242
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,369
It's blowing.

243
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:44,995
Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

244
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,956
- Marlene Andres.
- Marlene?

245
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,499
- Gossie McGee.
- Gossie McGee.

246
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:49,792
Great set, baby.

247
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,835
We're going to talk
with Mr. Lauderdale here.

248
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:53,212
Come on, Jack. I'm buying.

249
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:54,713
I'm coming in, uh, to talk to him.

250
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:56,840
You are doing a fabulous job!

251
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:57,967
Yes, man.

252
00:14:58,008 --> 00:15:00,010
Eh, look, let's talk to him
about this record.

253
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,179
Hey, no, no, we're gonna
let Marlene handle that.

254
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:04,181
You get Oberon
to call you a cab, all right.

255
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:05,808
Great set, Ray.

256
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,143
Goss!

257
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:10,312
Hey, daddy-o, want a smoke?

258
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:12,856
I got some gage, fresh off the boat.

259
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:14,358
It's clean and seedless.

260
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:16,193
So that's how it is, huh?

261
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:19,196
You keep me high
while they talk the business?

262
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,073
I ain't the one playing you, man.

263
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,494
Oberon, listen ...

264
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:29,164
You know, Marlene and Gossie are the
ones running the game on you, Ray.

265
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,291
What?

266
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,877
They sliced up the pie
the first night you played.

267

35 percent off the top.

268
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:36,797
Plus Gossie's
double scale as leader.

269
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:38,507
Leader?
If anybody's leading the band,

270
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:40,759
I'm the one that's the leader.

271
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:42,595
Forget the bo' humps.
You know what?

272
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:44,013
I ... I'm ... I'm gonna go
my own way.

273
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:45,973
Who's gonna book your gigs?

274
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:48,017
Marlene's got you locked up.

275
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:50,853

Jack's card.

282
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,870
I got his number at the hotel.

283
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,669
Come on, Q.
It's not that complicated.

284
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,046
Now let's just play it again.

Yeah, nigger! Yeah, that's it.

288
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:30,059
Ray, what did I tell you
about cookin' in the dark?

289
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,769
Are you tryin'
to burn the house down?

290
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:34,396
Think about it, Marlene. Uh ... uh,
what do I need the light for?

291
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:36,232
Well, you don't need
to be cookin' anyway.

292
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:37,858
We brought you
takeout from Oscar's.

293
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:38,984
Well, get your money back.

294
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,402
I got fried chicken right here.

295
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,779
Come on, Seven-oh, try this.

296
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:43,364
Yeah! About time.

297
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,034
Hey, that's home-cooked,
right there.

298
00:16:47,117 --> 00:16:48,244
Mmm, no, thank you.

299
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:49,745
This chicken is the mostest, huh.

300
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:52,081
Just needs a little hot sauce
and it'll be perfect.

301
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:54,166
Yeah. So, what did
Jack Lauderdale have to say?

302
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,834
Oh, I clocked him
comin' out the gate.

303
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,169
He's a two-bit hustler.

304
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:58,420
Oh, I see.

305
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:01,006
Yeah, turns out the only hit
that Swing Time ever had ...

306
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,259
was Open the Door, Richard,
which was a joke record.

307
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,219
Uh ... uh ... uh, what about him
recordin' me?

308
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:07,638
Oh, he'll record you,
if we pay the freight.

309
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:09,431
Scratch a liar, find a thief.

310
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:12,059
What's that supposed to mean?

311
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:13,352
This.

312
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,980
You see I saw
Jack Lauderdale tonight,

313
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:18,107
and he gave me a $500
advance on my record.

314
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,442
He also said he'll put me
on the road with Lowell Fulson ...

315
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:22,027
and pay me three times
what you pay.

316
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,237
Now, that's a lie!

317
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,740
Hey, no way he's not gonna put some
blind man on the road. Think about it.

318
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,742
I mean, you ... you need
watchin' out for.

319
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:31,036
And he ain't got the time to
look after you the way I do.

320
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,539
Is that what you've been doing,
Gossie? Watchin' out for me?

321
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,457
Is that why you get
paid double what I do?

322
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,168
Who told you that?

323
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,295
It's true, ain't it?

324
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:41,380
You two have been
gaming me since I got here.

325
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,424
Ray, baby, listen ...
I ain't listening to you!

326
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:45,885
Ray, I've ... I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

327
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,012
Then why aren't you talkin'?

328
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,641
Um, look, Ray, Ray,
let's not do nothin' stupid.

329
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:54,476
I might be blind,
but I ain't stupid!

330
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:56,228
Q., get my bag from upstairs.

331
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:57,438
- What?
- Get it!

332
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:58,981
- Wha ... right now?
- Now.

333
00:17:59,064 --> 00:18:01,317
Ray, man, we done been
through a whole lot.

334
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:04,111
Ray, now wait a minute.
I can explain everything.

335
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:06,113
Think about what you're doing.

336
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:08,032
Ray, Ray, now you're makin'
a big mistake.

337
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,117
That clown is spoutin'
promises that he can't keep.

338
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,952
You'd be a fool to follow him.

339
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:13,329
Ray, Ray, we'll make a new deal!

340
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:14,538
Whatever makes you happy!

341
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,540
The deal is
you can lay the pipe now.

342
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:20,044
You'll break your neck going down
these stairs by yourself. Hang on.

343
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:21,545
Oh, man.

344
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:25,382
Ray, I ain't never seen you do
nothing like that, man. Never.

345
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:27,176
That ain't nothing, Seven-oh.

346
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:41,982
Stop cheating, Ray.

347
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,444
George, you can't catch me.
Come on.

348
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:46,862
Aretha!

349
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:48,864
Come on, George.

350
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:51,450
Aretha Robinson,
have you lost your mind?

351
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,828
Eula, you promised to split every
wash basket with me, fair and square!

352
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:55,996
And I did!

353
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,164
Hell, you did!

354
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:59,333
You charge white folks
one thing and pay me another.

355
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,834
Now who's gonna wash these?

356
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,378
You can. Now pay me my money!

357
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:07,967
Okay, I'm a-giving you
your two little dollars.

358
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,177
But don't you be expectin'
no more work out of me!

359
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,679
I got all I need out of you.

360
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,264
Ray and George, come on!

361
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:14,932
That's right.
Get out of my yard ...

362
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,767
and don't y'all never come back!

363
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,439
Y'all got to learn
to read and write real good,

364
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:25,276
so you never have to work
for people like that.

365
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,069
Scratch a liar, find a thief.

366
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,112
Understand?

367
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,321
Yes, Mama.

368
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,920
Smell that, Ray.
Smell the success.

369
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:46,630
We're in LA, man,

370
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,966
the place where the Negro
comes to spread his wings.

371
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,468
You ... you know, man, I know
my ears ain't deceivin' me.

372
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,553
Is that Art Tatum?

373
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:54,263
It sure is, baby.
You want to meet him?

374
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:57,016
I ... I can't meet him.
A-Art Tatum is the most.

375
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:06,734
So, Ray, we got to talk about
your name, man: Robinson.

376
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:09,695
Sugar Ray got the Robinson
franchise all sewed up.

377
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:13,449
So I'm thinkin' we go with
your middle name, Charles.

378
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:15,367
As in, Ray Charles.

379
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,161
I don't care
what you call me, man,

380
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:19,038
just as long as my name's
on the record.

381
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,497
But we're gonna toast to that.

382
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:21,874
Hey, what's the haps, Jack?

383
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,584
Oh, my goodness.
Give me some skin.

384
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,711
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

385
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:29,381
Lowell Fulson, meet your new
piano player: Ray Charles.

386
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:32,009
Ray Charles, the blind sensation.

387
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:35,888
Ow! Damn! I'm gonna use that
on the album cover.

388
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,389
He's really the sensation.

389
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,308
I ... I love your music,
Mr. Fulson.

390
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,768
Uh, the man's got taste.

391
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,145
Hey, and the man ain't
been on the road ...

392
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:45,439
with a band before,
so now you take care of him.

393
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:46,857
Like my own brother.

394
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:51,695
Ray.

395
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:53,697
I'm gonna be right back.

396
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:54,823
All right.

397
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:57,993
Yeah, you got the one
on the left.

398
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,828
Look here,
let me do the talking.

399
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,150
Don't go inside that place.

400
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:31,694
You know what Mama said.

401
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,238
Go home
and don't tell Mama nothin'.

402
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,115
Go, George.

403
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:42,413
George, get out of here!

404
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:11,025
Hey, boy, who let you in?

405
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:13,402
You must be Aretha's son, huh?

406
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:15,696
Yes, sir. Ray Charles Robinson.

407
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:18,908
I've been seeing you
sneakin' around here.

408
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,910
You like the piano, huh?

409
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,537
Come on, you want
to learn how to play?

410
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:24,914
Come on over here.

411
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:26,707
Let me show you how to play.
Come on.

412
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,001
I'm gonna teach you how to play.

413
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:32,004
What we'll do, I'm gonna teach
you three notes, right?

414
00:22:32,087 --> 00:22:34,173
This is the first note,
right here.

415
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:36,842
Play that.

416
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,346
And here's the second note,
right here.

417
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:42,765
Play that.

418
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,101
Here's the third note.

419
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,439
Now, here's the way it goes.

420
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,107
Listen. Listen closely, now.

421
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,196
Play that.

422
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,115
Good!

423
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:03,035
Try the other notes.

424
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:13,337
Every club we hit,

425
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,881
it's your responsibility
to rehearse the band.

426
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:18,008
These are some lazy-ass bastards,

427
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,386
so you gotta make sure
that they don't slough off.

428
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:22,930
You gotta be ready
and dressed to open the show.

429
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:25,349
Now, Lowell likes to take
a nap before he goes on.

430
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:28,477
You just do your thing
until he feels like comin' out.

431
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:31,480
And when Lowell's playin',
you keep the band sharp.

432
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:32,523
Uh ... uh, just one thing.

433
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:33,524
What?

434
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,734
Did Jack tell you that
I have to be paid in singles?

435
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:39,247

Why do they call me Fathead?

442
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:05,472
Nah, you don't want to hear.

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,964

00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,705
Say, Ray, we'll be in here
for a little while.

477
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:19,542
Use the women's can,
down there on your right.

478
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,168
I don't want to use

00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:49,113
Yeah, I must have slipped
on the wet.

483
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,281
There's a pipe broke.

484
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,907
There's water everywhere.
You see it?

485
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:53,909
Let's go, man. Close the door.

486
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:55,369
All right, quit playing, Ray.

487
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:57,913
We'll be in here a while.
Now go on now!

488
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:06,672
Where you from, Ray?

489
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:07,965
North Florida.

490
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,884
Oh, North Florida boy.

491
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:11,594
Your people still down there?

492
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,887
No.

493
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,222
All right.

494
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:17,224
Hey, uh, pardon me for askin',

495
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:19,226
but how do you
get around so good ...

496
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,186
without a cane or a dog?

497
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:24,857
How do you get around so good
without a cane or dog?

498
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:27,067
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

499
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,238
My ears got to be my eyes, man.
Its ...

500
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:33,282
Everything sounds different.

501
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:35,451
You know that's why
I wear hard-soled shoes,

502
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:37,494
so I can hear my footsteps
echo off the wall.

503
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:40,789
So when I pass by an open
doorway, the sound changes.

504
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:42,333
Wow. That's cool.

505
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:46,378
You know you got to learn pretty quick
if you want to get around on your own.

506
00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:47,588
Yeah.

507
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,466
You know, during the war,
there was a whole lot ...

508
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,760
I had to learn fast,
or I wouldn't be here.

509
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,723
Seein' that much death
ain't natural.

510
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,936
Yeah, seein' death ain't natural.

511
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:08,400
Boys, get from 'round that still.

512
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:09,860
Y'all know better than that.

513
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:11,362
Come on, catch me.

514
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,911
Stay from 'round this fire
and get clean.

515
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:20,579
Dinner will be ready soon.

516
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:22,122
Hear me, Ray?

517
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,167
I got you. I got you.

518
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:26,627
No, you didn't. You missed me.

519
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,003
Stop cheatin', Ray.

520
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,673
Okay, you got me.

521
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:32,508
But I got you back.

522
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,301
I'm not playin' no more.

523
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:35,719
Sissy!

524
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:39,807
Come on, Ray.
Let's go swimmin'.

525
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:44,478
Let's go swim in Mama's washtub.

526
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:47,648
Ray, come on, Ray, play with me.

527
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:50,025
You better get down
before Mama sees you.

528
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,569
I'm a giant!

529
00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:57,157
Some giant.

530
00:29:58,242 --> 00:30:01,036
Come on, George.
I ain't playin' this game.

531
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,581
That ain't funny.

532
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:08,210
Boys, I got some field peas
and rice cooking.

533
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:10,880
And there's that smothered
corn left from yesterday.

534
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:14,925
And if you're real good, I might
have two pieces of peach cobbler.

535
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:18,387
Ray, didn't I tell you
to get in this house?

536
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,392
Dear God, no!

537
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,315
That's Aretha's boy!

538
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,774
Breathe, baby, breathe.

539
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:34,236
Just breathe, baby, breathe.
Let it out!

540
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,113
Let it out, please!

541
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,615
Breathe for your mama, now.

542
00:30:37,698 --> 00:30:39,033
Come on, George.

543
00:30:39,283 --> 00:30:41,410
Why didn't you do somethin'?

544
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:43,329
Why didn't you call me?

545
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:46,582
Help us, Lord!

546
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:48,250
The Lord done took him home.

547
00:30:57,885 --> 00:30:59,094
All right.

548
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,931
Food and piss stop. Open it up.

549
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:07,937
The food is hot.
You've got 45 minutes.

550
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:10,397
- I could eat a horse.
- Where's it?

551
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:12,566
Follow your nose. Right over there.

552
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:14,443
Wilbur.

553
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:15,569
What?

554
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,947
45 minutes ain't enough time.

555
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:19,490
We need more than that, Jack.

556
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,158
Not to eat, you don't.

557
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:23,327
Now if you got other business,
you better choose,

558
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,912
because this bus
is rollin' on time.

559
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:28,249
Come on, Mercedes got
a washroom in the back.

560
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:31,126
And you, you can smell it.

561
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:33,837
Jeff.

562
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:34,922
Yes, sir?

563
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:36,257
Uh, could you help me in there?

564
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,716
Sure thing, Ray.

565
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,801
Hey, Mercedes.

566
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:41,679
Hey, baby. I hope you wiped
your feet before you came in here.

567
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:43,180
- There you go. Come on.
- Take that.

568
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:45,140
The bathroom's right there
in front of you.

569
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:46,183
Okay.

570
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,476
You want me to fix you a plate?

571
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,852
Uh, no, I'm ... I'm fine.

572
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:50,312
All right.

573
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:52,273
Sweet potato pie it is.

574
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:54,817
Whoo, let's go, man.

575
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,652
That was a long bus ride,
wasn't it?

576
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:57,820
Oh, come on, man.

577
00:31:57,903 --> 00:32:00,990
Hey, man!
The can's down the hall.

578
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:02,950
I know where the can is.
What y'all doing?

579
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:04,660
Do yourself a favor and leave.

580
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:06,579
I'll leave when
I'm gettin' ready to leave.

581
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:08,163
Come on, Fathead, I want in.

582
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:09,957
This ain't no weed, Ray.

583
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:12,042
And we ain't snorting no bitch.

584
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:13,335
This is boy.

585
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:15,880
Boy'll make your ass
null and void.

586
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:17,506
So get on out of here, man.

587
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,425
Null and void, just like my life.

588
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:21,135
I'll be right at home.

589
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:22,887
Look, I ain't gonna
wait all night.

590
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:24,680
Hell, it's his funeral, man.

591
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:28,767
Ray, let's go get
something to eat.

592
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:30,436
I'll leave when I get a taste.

593
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,687
Ray, what you gonna do, man?

594
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,189
This train's pullin' out, brother.

595
00:32:33,272 --> 00:32:35,107
I ain't having nothin'
to do with this.

596
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,859
- I warned you, Ray.
- Come on, man.

597
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:38,152
I been warned.

598
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:39,486
Sit down, Ray. Right there.

599
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,071
I'm gonna take you
on a little ride.

600
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,824
It'll cost you, though.
You got some cash?

601
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,326
Will this do?

602
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:47,077
That'll do.

603
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,207
Where you been?
Where them other fools?

604
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:52,750
Come on, get it while it's hot!

605
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:56,420
You're going to feel
a little pinch.

606
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:00,716
I ain't givin' up on you, boy.

607
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:03,677
Feel it, baby?

608
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:06,639
Just take the ride.

609
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,600
It's better than sex.

610
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:12,311

00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,183
No, I don't like it. It stings.

634
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:15,726
Boy, get up here.

635
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,230
I paid a whole dollar for it.
It better work.

636
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:21,774
Now hold up your head,
like the doctor says.

637
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:23,817
This is gonna make you feel better.

638
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,407
Ray, come on in for dinner.

639
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:32,785
And stop rubbin' those eyes.

640
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:46,757
Ray, I won't beat around
the bush with you.

641
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,092
You're goin' blind.

642
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:51,554
The doctor's sayin' there's nothing they
can do, so we got to do it ourselves.

643
00:35:51,595 --> 00:35:52,680
Yes, ma'am, I know, but ...

644
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:53,722
Stop it.

645
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:55,349
Stop it right now.

646
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:57,351
We ain't got no time
for no tears.

647
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:59,061
Ain't nobody gonna
have no pity on you ...

648
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,437
just 'cause you're goin' blind.

649
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:01,689
Now wipe them eyes.

650
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:03,148
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,444
Okay, I'll show you
how to do something once.

652
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:09,154
I'll help you if you mess up twice.

653
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:10,906
But the third time,
you're on your own,

654
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,367
'cause that's the way
it is in the world.

655
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,910
All right, now get up.

00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:19,999
Remember, you goin' blind,
but you ain't stupid.

657
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:23,669
Remember how many stairs
there were?

658
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:25,087
Four.

659
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:28,632
Good. You're gonna have to learn
how to use your memory.

660
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:29,884
Now turn around.

661
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,886
I want you
to hold out your hands,

662
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,889

00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:39,101

00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,764
You see that?

681
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:00,516

00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:52,151
♪ Oh, no, no, no ♪

696
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:55,613
All right, who's next?

697
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,032
It's a shame, Jimmy.

698
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:00,075
You're just gonna
piss this right up your arm.

699
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,703
You don't tell me
what to do with my money.

700
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,749
All right, come on. Step up.
The $1 sensation.

701
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,756
You wanna keep counting?

702
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,591
What's the matter with you, boy?

703
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:17,051
$50 ain't good enough for you?

704
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:19,220
That ain't $50. Keep counting.

705
00:39:19,803 --> 00:39:23,098
I guess you want charity, since
that record of yours ain't selling.

706
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:27,645
Get him off my back!

707
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,109
Break it up!

708
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:35,945
What the hell's going on in here?

709
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,323
The blind sensation don't like
the money I'm trying to pay him!

710
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:40,449
He's cheating me! I quit!

711
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,201
Oh, you lying son of a bitch!

712
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:44,620
Don't be fighting nobody
that can see!

713
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:47,414
Listen, I ain't runnnin' around
lookin' for singles for this chump!

714
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:48,582
There's $50 here, Ray.

715
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:49,625
You see that, fool?

716
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,545
Shut up, Wilbur! Ray, from now on,
I'll handle your pay myself.

717
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:53,587
I'm tired of this!

718
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,422
I'll tell Jack to
find you somebody else!

719
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:56,715
You sure? It's cold out there.

720
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,801
Don't worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

721
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:01,053
- Ray!
- Damn it, Wilbur!

722
00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:02,137
Let him go!

723
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:03,722
What we gonna do now?

724
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:15,234
"After the death of Moses, the
Lord spake unto Joshua saying:

725
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:17,695
Moses my servant is dead.

726
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:20,239
Now therefore arise.
Go over to Jordan.

727
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:21,448
Be not afraid,

728
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,617
For the Lord thy God is with thee."

729
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,160
Mr. Charles.

730
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:26,996
Who is it?

731
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,789
Mr. Charles,
my name is Ahmet Ertegun.

732
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:30,457
May I have a moment of your time?

733
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:36,088
What do you want, man?
I'm at church.

734
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,465
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

735
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:40,634
You're here now. What do you want?

736
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:44,054
My company, Atlantic Records,
has acquired ...

737
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:46,307
your contract from Swing Time.

738
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,517
I'd like to discuss your future.

739
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:51,437
Hold on. Don't jive me now.
I ain't for sale.

740
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:53,147
May I sit down?

741
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:57,776
You see, Mr. Charles,

742
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:00,613
Jack Lauderdale has found himself,

743
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:02,865
shall we say, a little overextended,

744
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:06,118
and has had to
unload some of his talent.

745
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:08,162
When your name
came up, I jumped at ...

746
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:10,164
the chance to work with you.
I'm a big fan.

747
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,124
What if I want to go
to another company?

748
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,627
There's a guy out there right now
that is willing to pay me ...

749
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,046
seven cents a record.
Can you do that?

750
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:20,216
Man, I could promise you
15 cents a record,

751
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:24,511
but you won't get it any more
than he'll pay you seven.

752
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:29,391
What I will do is promise you
five cents a record ...

753
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,894
and pay you five cents
a record.

754
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:35,898
If you think pennies,
Mr. Charles, you get pennies.

755
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,526
You think dollars,

756
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:41,111
you get dollars.

757
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:45,866
I like how you put
things together, man.

758
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,868
Ahem, you know what?

759
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:50,871
Omelet, you're all right with me.

760
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:52,498
- Ahmet.
- Ahmet.

761
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:53,749
What kind of name is that?

762
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,042
I'm Turkish.

763
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,335
Well, you know what?

764
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:59,296
I guess Jack Lauderdale's bad
luck is my good fortune.

765
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:02,508
I knew that Atlantic Records
was bigger than Swing Time.

766
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:05,135
You guys do good music.
I dig Atlantic.

767
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,679
You could have fooled me.

768
00:42:06,762 --> 00:42:09,431
Well, you know, I gotta keep
my eye on you city boys.

769
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:11,851
Down home,
we call it "country dumb."

770
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,813

Okay, I'll talk to him.

784
00:43:05,154 --> 00:43:07,990
All right, fellas, that's a cut.
That's a cut, fellas.

He just don't get it.

788
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,831
You either sound original,
or you got nothin'.

789
00:43:15,956 --> 00:43:18,167
Ahmet, what'd you think of that?

790
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:21,462
Ray, I want to tell you something,
and I don't want you to take it wrong.

791
00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:22,838
Then give it to me right.

792
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:26,342
I signed you because I sensed
something special in you ...

793
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:29,595
not because you sound like
Nat Cole or Charles Brown.

794
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:31,513
I thought you like what I do.

795
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:33,516
We ... we love the timbre
of your voice,

796
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:35,809
we like your virtuosity,
your energy ...

797
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:37,144
But not my music.

798
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:38,646
Come on, man, I didn't say that.

799
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:41,148
Ahmet, this is what I do, man.

800
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,359
I gotta make a living.
This is what the people want.

801
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:45,027
I don't know no other way.

802
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,862
We got to help you find one.

803
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:49,240
Look, let's try a little
change of pace, okay?

804
00:43:49,323 --> 00:43:50,699
You're familiar with stride piano?

805
00:43:50,783 --> 00:43:54,078
You kidding me, man? The man who I
learned the piano from is a stride player.

806
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:57,164
Okay, I got a song.
It's called "The Mess Around".

807
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,083
"The Mess Around."
Cute title. Who wrote it?

808
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,543
I did.

809
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:02,211
Ah, you wrote it.

810
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:03,295
Yeah.

811
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:05,047
Well, sing it to me, man.

812
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:06,507
- Sing it?
- Yeah.

813
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,217
It ain't like
I can read the lyrics.

814
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,886
Okay.
Well, it's the key of G.

815
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,388
Okay. Key of G.

816
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:14,515
Uh-huh.

817
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:16,350
Yeah.

818
00:44:16,517 --> 00:44:19,353
Yeah, but it's a kind of
Pete Johnson thing.

819
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:20,813
Pete Johnson.

820
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:24,275

844
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,053
Great, Ray!

845
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:35,262
Unbelievable!

846
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:36,430
Who's that?

847
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:39,642
Ray, I want you to meet
my new partner, Jerry.

848
00:45:39,725 --> 00:45:41,268
Mr. Ray Charles, Jerry Wexler.

849
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:42,353
Hey.

850
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:45,481
Don't worry, Ray. I'm going to
step back, I'm gonna watch,

851
00:45:45,564 --> 00:45:47,983
I'm gonna learn how to produce
a record. I'm in awe.

852
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:49,276
That was out of sight.

853
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,153
That's some running
and riffing, man!

854
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:53,155
Well, this'll make you shout, man.

855
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:03,999
We're listening to that
new recording, Mess Around ...

856
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,377
by Atlantic recording artist,
Ray Charles.

857
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,964
And we have the gentleman
live here in the KCOH studios.

858
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:13,092
So, Ray, when you're not making your
own music, what do you listen to?

859
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:16,845
You know what, the fact is, King Bee,
I really and truly love gospel.

860
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:19,807
One of my favorite groups
is from right here in Houston:

861
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,725
The Cecil Shaw Singers.

862
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:25,479
You heard it: Ray Charles endorses
Houston's own Cecil Shaw.

863
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:27,481
We'll be playing
gospel all day Sunday ...

864
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:29,233
but right now,
let's hear some more ...

865
00:46:29,316 --> 00:46:30,943
of that Mess Around
by Ray Charles.

866
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:32,361
K.B., line 1.

867
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:36,073
King Bee.

868
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:38,784
Mmm-hmm.

869
00:46:39,785 --> 00:46:41,453
Yeah, he's right here.

870
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,665
Miss Della Antwine
of the Cecil Shaw Singers.

871
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:49,962
Hello, Miss Antwine.

872
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:53,132
You sung tenor in
Jesus Is My Shepherd, right?

873
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:54,425
Yes.

874
00:46:55,259 --> 00:46:57,011
How did you pick me out?

875
00:46:57,094 --> 00:47:00,055
Actually,
I ... I hear like you see.

876
00:47:00,806 --> 00:47:03,851
Like that hummingbird outside
the window, for instance.

877
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:11,317
I can't hear her.

878
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,651
You have to listen.

879
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:31,754
Yes.

880
00:47:31,837 --> 00:47:32,838
Yeah.

881
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,256
Yes, you can.

882
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,382
OH-OH.

883
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:36,425
You hear that?

884
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:37,551
What?

885
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:40,429
Her heart just skipped a beat.

886
00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:44,558
Oh, did you like my record?

887
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,228
The one that King Bee was playin'?

888
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,272
It was very nice.

889
00:47:50,523 --> 00:47:52,733
Different than the others.

890
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:55,236
I've heard a lot of your music.

891
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,862
Was it very nice, too?

892
00:47:56,946 --> 00:47:59,198
Look, Miss Antwine, if you
don't really like the record,

893
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:02,660
you ain't got to beat around the bush
with me. I mean, my mama never did.

894
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:05,037
It's not that I don't
enjoy your music.

895
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,456
It's just that I feel
I've heard it before.

896
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:10,042
I keep wondering what the
real Ray Charles sound like.

897
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,585
Ray Charles? Who's he?

898
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,587
Nobody, if you don't know.

899
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:14,630
Huh?

900
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:17,925
Sorry. I should have
kept my mouth shut.

901
00:48:18,008 --> 00:48:20,177
Oh, no, no.
Then you wouldn't be you.

902
00:48:21,387 --> 00:48:23,806
You know, it's not like
I haven't heard that before.

903
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:27,184
I guess I just, uh, never
really listened, that's all.

904
00:48:29,395 --> 00:48:32,356
Ain't nobody ever put
it that sweet, I guess.

905
00:48:49,582 --> 00:48:51,500
You know what,
Miss Della Bea Antwine?

906
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,669
You really are a country girl.
You know that?

907
00:48:53,752 --> 00:48:55,713
Yes.
How'd you know?

908
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:57,840
I could tell by
the way you ordered.

909
00:48:57,923 --> 00:49:00,092
"Let me get molasses
with my cornbread."

910
00:49:01,343 --> 00:49:03,012
Were you raised on a farm?

911
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:05,931
My mother did a little
sharecropping in Florida.

912
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:07,474
Is she still there?

913
00:49:07,558 --> 00:49:10,394
God bless her heart, she passed
away when I went to school.

914
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:11,979
Ray, I'm sorry.

915
00:49:12,438 --> 00:49:14,148
She never was real healthy.

916
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:16,775
She just worked herself
to death, poor thing.

917
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,653
That's why she didn't want me
carrying around no tin cup.

918
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,447
The kids I went to school with,

919
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,200
they were doing basket-weavin'
and wickerwork.

920
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:27,369
But not you. Because of your gift.

921
00:49:27,494 --> 00:49:29,121
Because of my ears.

922
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,332
See, I can mimic
damn near anybody,

923
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:34,084
and I ... I ... I ... I make
a pretty decent living at it.

924
00:49:34,168 --> 00:49:36,212
It's just, if I
change my style up ...

925
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:37,838
and people really don't dig it,

926
00:49:37,922 --> 00:49:40,174
I mean, what am I
left with, you know?

927
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:42,760
I mean, when you're blind,
Miss Antwine,

928
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:45,012
you ain't got that many choices.

929
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:48,724
Seem to me like you got all
the choices in the world.

930
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:51,727
God gave you the gift to sound ...

931
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:54,063
like anybody you please,
even yourself.

932
00:49:55,814 --> 00:49:58,025
We're here. This is where I live.

933
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:00,986
Well, you think
the preacher'd let me in?

934
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,405
I mean, uh, I'm a sinner,
but I need a little prayer.

935
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,950
His wife don't like
me having male company.

936
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:09,203
Well, tell him there's
a soul out here that needs savin'.

937
00:50:09,954 --> 00:50:13,374
You know what, Miss Antwine,
you really got me thinkin'.

938
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:16,669
About what?

939
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:20,089
About my life. About my music.

940
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:23,717
About everything.

941
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,431
Ray, don't ... don't you think
we're movin' a little fast?

942
00:50:31,392 --> 00:50:33,143
Listen, I'm ... I'm gonna
go to New York ...

943
00:50:33,227 --> 00:50:35,729
for a couple of weeks,
and when I get back,

944
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:38,607
you can take it as
slow as you want.

945
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:43,112
All right, Mr. Charles.

946
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:46,240
All right, Miss Antwine.

947
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:48,284
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

948
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:50,369
Well, hold on, now.
Let me call you a cab.

949
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:52,121
I got it. Three blocks up,

950
00:50:52,204 --> 00:50:54,915
left for two, right for one.

951
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:56,709
Fifteen giant steps,

952
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:58,711
and I'm at the
Crystal White Hotel. Hello.

953
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:08,554
"Mess Around" was
a positive step for us, Ray.

954
00:51:08,637 --> 00:51:09,763
We're making progress.

955
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,974
Oh, come on, Ahmet.
Now, you've been nice to me.

956
00:51:12,057 --> 00:51:13,809
But I haven't given
you guys any hits.

957
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,436
Atlantic Records
has been good to me,

958
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,229
but if you want me to do
something special,

959
00:51:17,313 --> 00:51:18,647
I'm gonna need my own band.

960
00:51:19,148 --> 00:51:22,359
Oh, man. Taking a band out on
the road costs a mint, Ray.

961
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:25,487
I mean, even Joe Morris is struggling.
His band's had a hit record.

962
00:51:25,571 --> 00:51:27,406
But, Ahmet, listen,
I'm not Joe Morris.

963
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:29,742
Man, you told me if I think
pennies, I get pennies.

964
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:31,702
I'm thinking dollars, man.

965
00:51:33,037 --> 00:51:35,873
Ruth Brown's got
a tour booked in Georgia.

966
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:38,209
She needs a band.

967
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:39,293
I ... I'll take it.

968
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:42,129
I could write the charts
for her, I ... I could do backup,

969
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:44,256
and also be an openin' act.

970
00:51:47,218 --> 00:51:48,552
Okay.

971
00:51:48,677 --> 00:51:50,930
But you're going to be
financially responsible.

972
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:52,932
You're gonna have
to make it work, Ray.

973
00:51:53,015 --> 00:51:55,518
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna make it
do what it do, baby.

974
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:56,977
Yeah.

975
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:10,115
Ray!

976
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:12,785
Miss Antwine, it's been two weeks.

977
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:14,578
It's been three.

978
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:22,711
Now, where's the preacher at?
And the wife?

979
00:52:22,836 --> 00:52:24,922
They in Dallas till Monday.

980
00:52:25,005 --> 00:52:26,757
Well, hallelujah!

981
00:52:36,976 --> 00:52:38,394
Della Bea.

982
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,063
Kind of like a honey bee, right?

983
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:46,652
Can I call you Bea?

984
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:49,947
Yeah, I'd like that.

985
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:56,662
There's only been two cats that
I ever really trusted in my life.

986
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:01,417
There's Jeff Brown, he's going
to be my tour manager,

987
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:04,587
Fathead Newman, my tenor man ...

988
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:08,257
and now you.

989
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:17,349
But you gotta do me a favor.

990
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:19,518
Bea, you gotta
always tell me the truth.

991
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:21,729
Oh, yeah.
Just like you did before.

992
00:53:22,605 --> 00:53:25,566
Don't feel sorry for me
just 'cause I'm blind.

993
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:29,195
How could I pity
someone I admire?

994
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,701
Can I play something for you?

995
00:53:35,784 --> 00:53:37,369
- Now?
- Yeah.

996
00:53:37,453 --> 00:53:38,579
No, Ray.

997
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:40,581
Yeah, right now.
Right now. I'm gonna ...

998
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,790
Ray!

999
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,546
It's right there.
You got it.

1000
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:48,839
Okay.

1001
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:50,132
Yeah, yeah, this will work.

1002
00:53:51,342 --> 00:53:53,636
Now you go ahead and play.
I'm gonna close these drapes.

1003
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:54,720
All right.

1004
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:56,305

I wrote it.

But what the hell
are we gonna tell Ray?

1043
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:33,027
We just have
to tell him the truth:

1044
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,904
Ruth Brown's pregnant,
so there's no tour.

1045
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:36,739
What about LaVern Baker?

1046
00:55:36,864 --> 00:55:38,866
Get LaVern Baker to take the tour.

1047
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:41,118
She doesn't have a record.
There's nothing to promote.

let's get her in the studio.

1050
00:55:44,914 --> 00:55:46,582
It's gonna take
a month to do that ...

1051
00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:48,626
What are we gonna do?
We got to do somethin'.

1052

Ray's got a whole
new band up there.

together a band so fast?

Boss! Boss, they're here.

1055
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:58,135
Come on. Let's get together
so we can show 'em this.

1089
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:12,501
Ray, It was
Milt's dad, Billy,

1090
00:57:12,543 --> 00:57:15,170
who first drew my attention
to a certain blind pianist ...

1091
00:57:15,212 --> 00:57:17,214
when he was
booking Lowell Fulson.

1092

Ray Charles.
We believe in your talent.

We've already got you
booked on a 10-city tour ...

1095
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:26,473
with Roy Milton's Solid Senders ...

1096
00:57:26,515 --> 00:57:27,725

1097
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:30,686

Ray, I gotta tell you,

1100
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,443
we think you're onto
something very big here.

1101
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:40,613
Nobody's ever combined
R&B and gospel before.

1102
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:42,072
"I've Got A Woman" is a smash.

1103
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:44,992
You better start thinking about a
follow-up, my friend. Right now.

1104
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:47,203
You know, this sounds good.
I gotta run to Texas ...

1105
00:57:47,286 --> 00:57:49,872
and take care of some business,
and, I'll be right back.

1106
00:57:49,955 --> 00:57:52,541
Well, make it fast.
I'm ready to sell, sell, sell.

1116

1130

You know the place is small.

1131
00:59:05,281 --> 00:59:06,657

1132
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,159

a little more room.

1133
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:12,496

space while we start a family.

01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:35,616
I'm gonna get your shaving kit.

1210
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:38,452
Uh, Bea,
I ... I got it.

1211
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:40,704
Bea, hold ... hold on.

1212
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,669
Bea, let me get it.

1213
01:02:47,711 --> 01:02:50,297
How long you been
hiding this from me?

1214
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:52,716
Ray!

1215
01:02:54,176 --> 01:02:55,511
I'm your wife!

1216
01:02:55,594 --> 01:02:57,471
Bea, I ... I was just so
excited to see you.

1217
01:02:57,555 --> 01:02:59,849
I forgot to leave it back there
with the band, that's all.

1218
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,225
Let me ... Let me get it.

1219
01:03:01,308 --> 01:03:03,519
Oh, it's just a little medicine,
that's all, baby.

1220
01:03:03,602 --> 01:03:05,020
That ain't medicine to nobody, Ray.

1221
01:03:05,104 --> 01:03:06,480
Don't be lyin' to yourself.

1222
01:03:06,564 --> 01:03:08,148
It ain't like I'm
dealing it, baby.

1223
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,692
I just use it
to get a little taste.

1224
01:03:09,775 --> 01:03:11,527
You don't taste poison, Ray.
It kills you.

1225
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,653
Now, you got to stop.

1226
01:03:12,736 --> 01:03:14,864
I ain't got to do
a goddamn thing!

1227
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:19,076
What about me?
What about your baby?

1228
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:20,744
Bea.

1229
01:03:21,036 --> 01:03:23,205
It ain't like I'm new to this.

1230
01:03:23,747 --> 01:03:26,417
If I felt like this was
jeopardizing my music, or you,

1231
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,877
or providing for that baby,

1232
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,087
I would stop in a minute.
But I know it won't.

1233
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,673
How do you know that, Ray?
How do ... How do you know that?

1234
01:03:32,756 --> 01:03:35,217
You know what? You can talk till
you're blue in the face,

1235
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:36,969
it don't matter.
I'm not gonna stop.

1236
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,012
Then I'm comin' with you.

1237
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:39,013
No, no.

1238
01:03:39,054 --> 01:03:40,139
Well, Ray, you just said ...

1239
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:41,849
No. No.
You know what it is, Bea.

1240
01:03:41,891 --> 01:03:43,809
I ... I think
it's like you said.

1241
01:03:44,226 --> 01:03:47,563
I don't think that the road
is a place for you and the baby.

1242
01:03:50,149 --> 01:03:51,984
What are you saying to me, Ray?

1243
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:54,236
What I'm sayin' is
that when I get home,

1244
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,655
I hope that you're
here at my house.

1245
01:03:58,407 --> 01:03:59,742
Your house?

1246
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,123
Jeff, come get this bag.

1247
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:07,708
All right, Ray.

1248
01:04:09,835 --> 01:04:11,337
Hey, Della Bea.

1249
01:04:17,343 --> 01:04:18,677

Uh, Mary Ann, how would you feel ...

1264
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,652
if I asked you to sing a torch
song with a gospel feel to it?

1265
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:20,322
Well, Gospel's all about
love anyway, isn't it?

Oh, yeah.

1267
01:05:21,448 --> 01:05:24,451
Would it make you
feel like a sinner?

1268
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:28,289
Well, Mr. Charles,
I love the Lord, the Lord loves me.

1269
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,832
But I ain't no hypocrite.

1270
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:34,295

It's hard to fool me,

but it's impossible to fool
the Almighty, ain't it?

1272
01:05:37,882 --> 01:05:40,176
Why don't we rehearse
the song a little bit?

1273
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:41,302
Okay.

1274
01:05:41,343 --> 01:05:43,888

So, what do you think?

1290
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:14,687
Ray, telephone.

1291
01:07:15,062 --> 01:07:16,438
Take a message.

1292
01:07:18,232 --> 01:07:19,775
It's Della Bea.

1293
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:21,735
Damn it.

1294
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:24,071
Uh, tell her I'm busy.

1295
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:26,991
Come on, man,
I ain't lying to Bea.

1296
01:07:27,783 --> 01:07:29,118
Uh-oh.

1297
01:07:29,285 --> 01:07:30,452
Is that the wife?

1298
01:07:30,536 --> 01:07:31,912
Shut up.

1299
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,584
I-I'll be there in a second.

1300
01:07:39,336 --> 01:07:41,255
Don't mess with
this junk, all right?

1301
01:07:41,297 --> 01:07:43,299
All it'll do is make you sick.

1302
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:49,972
Does he have all
his fingers and toes?

1303
01:07:50,472 --> 01:07:51,974
Yes, he does.

1304
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:57,730
Can he, uh ...

1305
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:02,985
Can he see?

1306
01:08:04,653 --> 01:08:05,738
Yes.

1307
01:08:08,782 --> 01:08:10,284
You want to hold him?

1308
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:11,660
No, I can't.

1309
01:08:11,702 --> 01:08:12,703
Come on, Ray.

1310
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:14,288
I wouldn't know
what to do it right.

1311
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:15,998
That's what you came here for.

1312
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:18,334
Use this hand to hold his head.

1313
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:21,253
Okay. Right there.

1314
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:33,057
That's your daddy.

1315
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:34,350
Yeah.

1316
01:08:36,185 --> 01:08:39,063
He ain't no bigger
than a loaf of bread.

1317
01:08:39,772 --> 01:08:41,065
Thank you.

1318
01:08:41,857 --> 01:08:44,026
He's not my gift to you, Ray.

1319
01:08:44,318 --> 01:08:45,736
He's your son.

1320
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:49,657
You know I'm gonna take care of
both of you. You know that, right?

1321
01:08:52,201 --> 01:08:53,702
I love you.

1322
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:56,872
I love you, too, Ray.

1323
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:59,083
But there's
something I got to say.

1324
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:02,336
I know you're a musician,
a working musician,

1325
01:09:02,378 --> 01:09:05,005
but don't bring the road
into our home again.

1326
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:07,842
The home I'm making
for you and our children.

1327
01:09:07,883 --> 01:09:10,135
Bea, I ... I promise
I won't do that.

1328
01:09:10,386 --> 01:09:11,887
It ... It's just there's
some things ...

1329
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:14,014
No. Now, don't say no more.

1330
01:09:14,306 --> 01:09:16,058
I ain't no fool.

1331
01:09:16,684 --> 01:09:19,061
You know, you're
the only woman I'll ever love.

1332
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:34,869
Mama! Mama, help!

1333
01:09:35,244 --> 01:09:39,790
Mama, help!
Mama, help, please!

1334
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:42,084
I need you!

1335
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,550
Mama, help!

1336
01:09:51,177 --> 01:09:52,469
Mama!

1337
01:11:44,373 --> 01:11:48,377
I hear you, too, Mama.
You're right there.

1338
01:11:55,885 --> 01:11:57,887
Yeah, yes, I am.

1339
01:12:01,223 --> 01:12:02,892
Why are you crying, Mama?

1340
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:04,393
'Cause I'm happy.

1341
01:12:08,564 --> 01:12:10,399
Hey, it's Uncle Jeff!

1342
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:12,568

1343
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:14,737

1344
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,572

right there behind them.

1379
01:14:10,269 --> 01:14:12,605
Look, I'm going up to New York
to do some publicity.

1380
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:14,857
You take a week off and stay here,
find some material,

1381
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,026
and when I get back,
we can talk about it.

1382
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:19,320
Okay. Okay.

1383
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:22,615
Okay.

1384
01:14:39,089 --> 01:14:41,050
Ah, you know what,
I dig New York, man.

1385
01:14:41,091 --> 01:14:43,260
It's like everybody here's
making their own sound.

1386
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:45,095
They loved it.
Ray, they loved you.

1387
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:46,889
We're gonna
get the cover of Billboard.

1388
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:50,017
You know what, I want to do a session
while I'm here. How about tomorrow?

1389
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,227
What, you got the band here?

1390
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,229
Yeah. I've got the band here
Step down.

1391
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:56,023
Everybody except Mary Ann, because
I need a different background.

1392
01:14:56,065 --> 01:14:58,776
You know what I'm sayin', I've been
hearing this thing in my head,

1393
01:14:58,859 --> 01:15:00,945
kind of like a dance
between a man and three women.

1394
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:02,863
Sounds fun. Can I watch?

1395
01:15:02,905 --> 01:15:04,532
It's a dance of voices, Ahmet.

1396
01:15:04,615 --> 01:15:06,909
W — What do you have in mind?
Like three Mary Anns?

1397
01:15:06,951 --> 01:15:09,411
Oh, no, no, no.
That's too smooth.

1398
01:15:09,495 --> 01:15:12,081
I need somethin' that ...
that's more raw.

When it's happening, baby,
I mean, it just feels right.

1445
01:16:50,888 --> 01:16:53,766
I know what you mean. I got the
shivers in this studio tonight.

1446
01:16:53,849 --> 01:16:56,143
That's 'cause they ain't
paid the heating bill.

1447
01:16:56,185 --> 01:16:58,312
I have a question for
all of you:

1448
01:16:58,354 --> 01:17:00,898
How would you like to
go on the road with me?

1449
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,653
Wait ... wait. How, um,
how much you gonna pay us?

01:17:05,694 --> 01:17:07,488
You know, Ahmet takes care
of all of that.

1451
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,406
Oh, what, you mean
he don't listen to you?

1452
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,991
Yeah, you better know he does.

1453
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:14,203
Look, don't worry about it. Brother
Ray'll take care of all of you.

1454
01:17:14,245 --> 01:17:17,373
Well, my mama taught me to
take care of myself, honey.

1455
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,250
Is your mother here?

1456
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:21,043
No, she's not,
but I speak for us.

1457
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,169
No, you don't.

1458
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:26,340
Okay, Speak for Us, how about,
uh, ahem, $20 a week?

1459
01:17:26,382 --> 01:17:28,884
$20 a week is good.

01:17:31,178 --> 01:17:33,556
No, no, no.
Uh, how about $25?

1463
01:17:34,014 --> 01:17:35,474
We'll take $30.

1470
01:17:47,736 --> 01:17:49,488
are going to be called:
"The Raelettes".

1471
01:17:49,572 --> 01:17:50,948
Raelettes?

1472
01:17:51,031 --> 01:17:52,992
Does that mean
we have to "Let Ray"?

1473
01:17:53,075 --> 01:17:54,869
Oh, Lord! What am I going
to do with you?

1474
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,579
I'm sure you'll think
of somethin'.

1475
01:17:58,831 --> 01:18:00,082
$30 a week!

1476
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:02,668
We're going to be The Raelettes!

Fathead, come on,

All right, hold on, Jeff.
Listen up.

1480
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:34,950
From now on, we're gonna sing,
uh, four-part harmony.

1481
01:18:34,992 --> 01:18:37,453
Ethel, I want you to sing,
uh, uh, alto.

1482
01:18:37,953 --> 01:18:41,415
Margie, you sing tenor.
Pat, soprano, and Mary Ann, bass.

1483
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:43,959
I ain't no bass. I'm a soprano.

1484
01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:45,794
I'll sing bass.

1485
01:18:45,878 --> 01:18:47,963
I mean, where we come from,
we can sing anything.

1486
01:18:48,047 --> 01:18:49,256
Mmm-hmm.

01:22:23,109 --> 01:22:24,486
Don't start with me, Ray.

1552
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:25,612
The weight is off.

1553
01:22:25,695 --> 01:22:26,738
It ain't off.

1554
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:28,948
When you get high, man,
and you try to cop,

1555
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:30,575
those dealers spank your ass.

1556
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:32,160
You gotta have more discipline.

1557
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:36,247
You know what, man? I ain't
messing up my high tonight,

1558
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:39,167
sitting here with you,
arguing about nothin'.

1559
01:22:41,085 --> 01:22:44,130
Look, Fathead, just tie me off.

1560
01:22:45,089 --> 01:22:46,466
Come on, Fathead. Fat.

1561
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:51,095
Take care of your bad self,
you know so damn much.

1562
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:53,598
Later, Margie.

1563
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:55,767
Bye, Fathead.

1564
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,813
Damn.

1565
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,487
Ain't nothing free
in this world but Jesus.

1566
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:14,786
Hey, Margie.

1567
01:23:14,869 --> 01:23:17,038
Yeah? What do you want?

1568
01:23:17,455 --> 01:23:20,125
Do me a favor, sweetheart,
and ... and pick that up for me.

1569
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:22,919
You're going to have to get me off.

1570
01:23:25,421 --> 01:23:27,257
I'll do it,
if you let me try some.

1571
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,424
Shit. No, honey.

1572
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:30,176
This ain't for no little girls.

1573
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,220
I ain't no little girl!

1574
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,514
I understand.
It's just that this stuff ...

1575
01:23:34,597 --> 01:23:37,642
will take you places
that you don't want to go.

1576
01:23:38,017 --> 01:23:39,561
See, I want to share
that with you.

1577
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:41,020
Listen to me!

1578
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:43,022
If I ever hear about you
doing some drugs ...

1579
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:44,941
you're through, you hear me?

1580
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:47,360
You believe that more than you
believe in Jesus!

1581
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:50,363
Don't say that, Ray.

1582
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:53,867
Ray!

1583
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:56,995
Ray, I watch your show
every single night.

1584
01:23:57,912 --> 01:24:00,081
And every night is new to me.

1585
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:02,417
Maybe because it's new to you.

1586
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:06,379
It's like you live
every single word ...

1587
01:24:06,754 --> 01:24:09,716
and then you
bend some crazy note,

1588
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:13,511
And damn if you
don't break my heart.

1589

I'll cut you in half.

1726
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:53,059
All right, all right, Ray. Ahem.

1727
01:29:53,226 --> 01:29:55,812
We could, uh, split it up.

1728
01:29:55,895 --> 01:29:58,356
Do a Side A, Side B type of thing.

1729
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,358
It's been done before.
What the hell, right?

1730
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:01,401
Yeah.

1731
01:30:02,944 --> 01:30:04,529
It's s-sexual.

1732
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:06,531
It's just too damn sexual for kids.

1733
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:07,866
Let's do it.

1734
01:30:07,949 --> 01:30:09,951
Yeah, baby!
That's why I love y'all, man.

1735
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:12,370
All right. What the hell?
It's Atlantic, right?

1736
01:30:12,454 --> 01:30:13,413
Atlantic!

1737
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:14,664
We'll release it in the summer.

1738
01:30:14,747 --> 01:30:16,374
There's less censorship,
school's out.

1739
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,126
The kids are ready to kick loose.

1740
01:30:18,209 --> 01:30:19,961
Ha, okay!

1741
01:30:22,046 --> 01:30:25,383
Tom, let's see if we can cut
this pumpkin in two.

1742
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:27,343
Show me what your
genius is all about.

1743
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:28,678
You got it, boss.

1744
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:32,515
Yeah, that is it. You put one
on Side A, put another on Side B.

1745
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:33,933
Man, that sounds out of sight.

1746
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:35,059
How you feeling, Ray?

1747
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:36,644
I feel groovy, baby.

1748
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:39,439
- I'm talking about the junk.
- What?

1749
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:41,483
It's starting to show.

1750
01:30:42,275 --> 01:30:43,777
You're scratching all the time.

1751
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,111
You can't sit still.

1752
01:30:45,945 --> 01:30:48,198
Hey, man, have I ever
missed a date?

1753
01:30:48,281 --> 01:30:49,991
No, you never have.

1754
01:30:50,074 --> 01:30:52,368
Who's the one who delivers
a record in one take, hmm?

1755
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:54,662
Ray, you deliver better
than anybody I know ...

1756
01:30:54,746 --> 01:30:57,165
but I'm not talking to you
as a businessman.

1757
01:30:57,248 --> 01:30:59,250
Now come on, listen to me.

1758
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:01,961
I'm worried about you.

1759
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:05,882
As a friend, I'm telling you,
man, your slip is hanging.

1760
01:31:07,008 --> 01:31:08,426
"Your slip is hanging."

1761
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,930
You been hanging out with us
country boys too much, man.

1762
01:31:12,013 --> 01:31:15,475
Uh, don't worry about this, man.

You just turn that eight-track on,
and I'll do the girls' parts myself.

1894
01:36:47,557 --> 01:36:50,477
And go out here somewhere and
find me an "Oh, Johnny" girl.

1895
01:36:50,852 --> 01:36:52,479
Uh, one minute.

1896
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,064
What the hell's an "Oh, Johnny" girl?

1897
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:56,775
I think I've got an idea.

1898
01:36:57,317 --> 01:37:01,070
♪ Last night you were dreaming ♪

1899
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:03,948
♪ and I heard you say ♪

1900
01:37:05,867 --> 01:37:07,660

1901
01:37:07,827 --> 01:37:11,122

♪ Yes I believe ♪

1908
01:37:25,887 --> 01:37:27,889
The sky's the limit, Ray.

1909
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:30,058
I got you a $5,000-a-night raise.

1910
01:37:30,308 --> 01:37:32,185
They're gonna up you to 15 per.

1911
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:33,728
Rehearsal in 10 minutes, guys.

1912
01:37:33,812 --> 01:37:35,563
Jeff, could you get
me some cigarettes?

1913
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:37,524
Okay, boss.

1914
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:41,402
15 per, huh?

1915
01:37:41,486 --> 01:37:45,657
You know, Ray, your contract with
ATLANTIC is expiring in four months.

1916
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,991
Yeah.

1917
01:37:47,075 --> 01:37:49,035
Yeah, I've got the contract with me.

1918
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,079
They're going to double my royalties.

1919
01:37:51,162 --> 01:37:53,081
Before we jump back in that pond,

1920
01:37:53,248 --> 01:37:55,416
I thought I'd find out
what else was out there.

1921
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:59,129
I had a very productive chat
with ABC-Paramount yesterday.

1922
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:01,172
ABC? Who told you to do that, huh?

1923
01:38:01,256 --> 01:38:04,217
And you know, Atlantic is family,
just like the Shaw Agency.

1924
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,719
Ray, my job is to get you
the best deal possible.

1925
01:38:07,429 --> 01:38:09,389
ABC is very interested.

1926
01:38:09,431 --> 01:38:10,473
No.

1927
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:14,436
How interested?

1928
01:38:15,311 --> 01:38:20,233
How about a $50,000 advance
each year for three years?

1929
01:38:20,275 --> 01:38:22,360
You produce your own records.

1930
01:38:22,777 --> 01:38:25,280
They'll deduct recording costs
and give you ...

1931
01:38:25,655 --> 01:38:27,323
75 percent.

1932
01:38:30,994 --> 01:38:32,787
Ahmet and Jerry are
flying in tonight,

1933
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:37,748
so will you put them off until
I can talk things out with ABC?

1934
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:42,297
Well, my mama said, ain't
nothing wrong with talking.

1935
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:44,424
Hey, enough of the formalities.

1936
01:38:44,507 --> 01:38:46,426
Come on, let's go back
into the office, Ray.

1937
01:38:46,509 --> 01:38:47,552
I hope I can call you Ray.

1938
01:38:47,635 --> 01:38:49,095
I want you to be comfortable here.

1939
01:38:49,179 --> 01:38:52,223
Because I'll tell you something,
everything is gonna be better at ABC.

1940
01:38:52,307 --> 01:38:54,225
Moving from an indie label
to a major ...

1941
01:38:54,309 --> 01:38:55,935
means you can sell
a lot more records,

1942
01:38:55,977 --> 01:38:59,272
as well as attract much larger
crowds, both white and Negro.

1943
01:38:59,355 --> 01:39:02,942
Yeah, but Mr. Clark, you know,
I've been at Atlantic for so long,

1944
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:07,781
I just want to give those guys a chance,
you know, to at least match the offer.

1945
01:39:07,822 --> 01:39:10,116
Mm-hmm. Oh, certainly, certainly.

1946
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,701
But, uh, I doubt they'll be able to.

1947
01:39:11,785 --> 01:39:13,745
We're giving you
a state-of-the-art deal here.

1948
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:17,207
Well, you know, since I'm producing my own
records, I was wondering if I could ...

1949
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:19,125
uh, own my masters, too.

1950
01:39:26,674 --> 01:39:27,675
Well,

1951
01:39:27,759 --> 01:39:29,969
Ray, we've ... we've never
done that before.

1952
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:32,097
No record company has.

1953
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:36,935
Well, I think I'm going to have to have it
that way for me to leave Atlantic Records.

1954
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:48,113
Ahmet believes
we're family here at Atlantic.

1955
01:39:48,196 --> 01:39:50,240
I believe we're family
here at Atlantic.

1956
01:39:50,323 --> 01:39:52,158
Obviously, you don't!

1957
01:39:52,617 --> 01:39:54,160
Ahmet wouldn't believe it.

1958
01:39:54,244 --> 01:39:55,787
You know what he said, Ray?

1959
01:39:55,870 --> 01:39:57,831
He said you would never
turn your back on us.

1960
01:39:57,914 --> 01:40:00,041
Never for a Schlockmeister
like Sam Clark!

1961
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:03,294
That's rich.
Sam Clark's a corporate slug,

1962
01:40:03,378 --> 01:40:06,548
who wouldn't know the difference
between Earl Hines and Art Tatum!

1963
01:40:12,887 --> 01:40:14,931
We let you grow here, Ray.

1964
01:40:15,223 --> 01:40:18,893
And nobody's taking credit for
your talent, but we nourished it.

1965
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:21,354
We let you do your thing.

1966
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:25,150
God damn it!
We deserve better than this.

1967
01:40:25,233 --> 01:40:27,277
You know what, don't think that
I don't appreciate ...

1968
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,154
everything you guys
have done here, Jerry.

1969
01:40:29,237 --> 01:40:31,865
Ahmet, I'm very proud of the work
that we've done here together.

1970
01:40:31,906 --> 01:40:35,160
But, Atlantic has done pretty good
money-wise on my records, haven't they?

1971
01:40:35,243 --> 01:40:36,661
Yes, we've done very well, Ray.

1972
01:40:36,744 --> 01:40:39,956
You ... you were the ones that taught
me that making a record is business,

1973
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:42,375
and find the best
business deal you can.

1974
01:40:42,459 --> 01:40:45,712
Now, 75 cents of every dollar,
and owning my own masters ...

1975
01:40:45,795 --> 01:40:47,922
is a pretty damn good deal.

1976
01:40:48,465 --> 01:40:50,091
Can you match it?

1977
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:55,180
Ray, we would love to
match it, but we just can't.

1978
01:40:56,514 --> 01:40:59,350
That's a better deal
than Sinatra gets.

1979
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:03,730
I'm very proud of you.

1980
01:41:06,232 --> 01:41:09,819
Looks like those boys are going
to get a taste of country dumb.

1981
01:41:09,903 --> 01:41:11,070
Yeah.

1982
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:15,325
He'll be all right, man.

1983
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,411

Thought you said that ABC wasn't
going to force nothing on him.

1995
01:42:18,471 --> 01:42:19,931
They didn't.

1996
01:42:20,598 --> 01:42:22,308
It was Ray's idea.

1997
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:25,437
Something new.

1998
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,106
What are we then, Jeff?
Something old?

1999
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:31,818

What the hell is wrong with that?

2006
01:43:11,649 --> 01:43:14,194
Critics say you've gone
middle-of-the-road.

2007
01:43:14,277 --> 01:43:17,363
The orchestra, the choir,
The Perry Como Show, man?

2008
01:43:17,447 --> 01:43:20,992
If I feel the music,
that means it's real.

2009
01:43:21,075 --> 01:43:23,703
No, it ain't.
Ray Charles is a sellout.

2010
01:43:23,787 --> 01:43:26,790
The blind Liberace, leaving those
Rocking Chair roots behind.

2011
01:43:26,873 --> 01:43:27,832
Quincy Jones.

2012
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:29,793
Can we get a picture
of these two guys?

2013
01:43:29,876 --> 01:43:31,711
- Six-nine!
- Hey, boy.

2014
01:43:31,795 --> 01:43:34,214
Look, here, uh,
this interview is over.

2015
01:43:34,297 --> 01:43:36,174
I'd love to
get you two together, man.

2016
01:43:36,216 --> 01:43:37,634
S-some other time.

2017
01:43:37,967 --> 01:43:40,595
Look at you. How's it going, man?
You look good.

2018
01:43:40,678 --> 01:43:42,722
Let me look at you.
You look good, too.

2019
01:43:42,806 --> 01:43:44,474
You hear what they're
saying about me?

2020
01:43:44,557 --> 01:43:47,644
I just said that I ... I can't do it
no more. I've gone middle-of-the-road.

2021
01:43:47,727 --> 01:43:49,145
So crank out another hit.

2022
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:50,355
Let me tell you something,

2023
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:52,857
it ain't easy
to keep on being greezy, kid.

2024
01:43:53,316 --> 01:43:54,734
Where you blow in from?

2025
01:43:55,944 --> 01:43:57,028
Paris.

2026
01:43:57,112 --> 01:43:58,238
Bonjour.

2027
01:43:58,279 --> 01:44:00,490
Yeah, man.
France is where it's at.

2028
01:44:00,657 --> 01:44:02,742
Yeah, man. And all that stuff
you've been playing,

2029
01:44:02,826 --> 01:44:05,245
man, it's just ...
it really feels out of sight.

2030
01:44:05,286 --> 01:44:07,789
You know, we gotta
record something together.

2031
01:44:07,872 --> 01:44:09,624
I mean, people will really dig it.

2032
01:44:09,707 --> 01:44:11,584
So, where you going
after the Festival?

2033
01:44:11,626 --> 01:44:15,421
Oh, I ... I go to D.C., Richmond,
uh, Virginia, Georgia.

2034
01:44:15,505 --> 01:44:18,383
You know what, once you get the
record out there, you gotta sell it.

2035
01:44:18,425 --> 01:44:19,884
The South, man?

2036
01:44:21,094 --> 01:44:22,387
I'm not doing that no more.

2037
01:44:22,429 --> 01:44:25,265
Hey, come on, kid, that's where
the money is, baby.

2038
01:44:25,348 --> 01:44:27,892
You know, When I left Seattle
with Hamp,

2039
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:29,185
we went down there, man.

2040
01:44:29,269 --> 01:44:31,855
And it felt like
I walked into a prison cell.

2041
01:44:31,938 --> 01:44:35,567
You know, a black man
is a "boy" in Mississippi, Ray.

2042
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:37,569
Even if he's 80 years old.

2043
01:44:40,822 --> 01:44:43,241
I'm never playing
to Jim Crow again. Ever.

2044
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:45,118
If that's what you feel, baby.

2045
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:48,872
I'm serious, Ray.
Man, we gotta do something.

2046
01:44:50,582 --> 01:44:52,459
Well, you know,
what ... what the hell, man.

2047
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:55,920
You're just going to leave a lot
more money on the table for me.

2048
01:44:56,463 --> 01:44:58,131
You're welcome to it, man.

2049
01:45:13,229 --> 01:45:14,773
You ready to work?

2050
01:45:14,856 --> 01:45:16,149
Work on what?

2051
01:45:17,358 --> 01:45:19,235
Get over here, you gotta
help me with this.

2052
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:20,737
Percy just sent me some new music.

2053
01:45:34,793 --> 01:45:37,045
You know what
they're saying about me?

2054
01:45:37,128 --> 01:45:39,547
Said I've lost something, said
I've gone middle-of-the-road.

2055
01:45:39,631 --> 01:45:41,883
They may as well say
the same thing about you.

2056
01:45:41,966 --> 01:45:43,301
You were the soul of this band.

2057
01:45:43,343 --> 01:45:45,804
Now every time you're around,
you're just drunk.

2058
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:49,307
Drunk soul of a blind junkie.

2059
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:51,142
What a lovely couple.

2060
01:45:51,226 --> 01:45:53,603
Why don't you
just get out of here?

2061
01:45:55,438 --> 01:45:57,440
I ain't drunk, Ray.

2062
01:45:58,358 --> 01:45:59,692
I'm pregnant.

2063
01:46:00,902 --> 01:46:03,655
Yeah, that's right.
I'm having your baby.

2064
01:46:03,696 --> 01:46:06,533
You ain't really ...
You ... you can't do that.

2065
01:46:06,991 --> 01:46:08,660
I'm gonna have to
talk to the doctor.

2066
01:46:08,701 --> 01:46:09,869
You gotta get rid of it.

2067
01:46:11,287 --> 01:46:13,123
My God!

2068
01:46:13,248 --> 01:46:15,416
What, because
I'm not your precious Bea?

2069
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,211
I'm not good enough
to have this baby?

2070
01:46:19,379 --> 01:46:21,965
You lay up
in my bed every night.

2071
01:46:22,048 --> 01:46:23,258
My bed!

2072
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,052
I'm gonna have this baby, Ray.

2073
01:46:29,264 --> 01:46:31,641
- No, Ray! No!
- Come on, come on. Come on, just listen.

2074
01:46:31,724 --> 01:46:32,684
Just listen to me.

2075
01:46:32,767 --> 01:46:34,102
You know
I care about you, baby.

2076
01:46:34,185 --> 01:46:36,521
I won't let nothing happen to you.
I'll pay for everything.

2077
01:46:36,563 --> 01:46:37,647
No!

2078
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,899
It's gonna cost you
more than money.

2079
01:46:39,941 --> 01:46:42,944
I want you to leave her, Ray.
Come and be with our baby.

2080
01:46:43,027 --> 01:46:46,531
You out of your damn mind. You knew
the rules when you got into this.

2081
01:46:46,573 --> 01:46:48,950
You know goddamn well I ain't
gonna leave my family.

2082
01:46:50,368 --> 01:46:52,036
Leave your family?

2083
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:54,873
You are a damn fool,
you know that?

2084
01:46:55,623 --> 01:46:58,960
Between the dope
and the music and me,

2085
01:46:59,043 --> 01:47:01,713
you already done left
your damn family!

2086
01:47:02,213 --> 01:47:06,092
You know what the sad part about
it is, Ray, you don't even know it.

2087
01:47:11,014 --> 01:47:12,515
You know what?

2088
01:47:12,599 --> 01:47:16,102
From now on, it's strictly
business between you and me.

2089
01:47:19,147 --> 01:47:21,900
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Keep that anger.

Hey, Ray, it's Sam.

Can you hear me? It's Sam!

2122
01:48:27,173 --> 01:48:29,801
Yeah, hey, Hit the Road
is our second number one.

2123
01:48:29,843 --> 01:48:33,012
Yeah. ABC is taking out ads
in all the trades.

2124
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:35,932
Yeah, oh, and congrats
on your Grammy nomination.

2125
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:39,060
No, no, no I know
you're going to win.

2126
01:48:39,811 --> 01:48:41,479
Hey, you feeling all right?

2127
01:48:41,938 --> 01:48:44,524
Well, come on, baby, be happy.
You're doing good.

2128
01:48:44,774 --> 01:48:45,859
Thank you, Sam.

2129
01:48:47,068 --> 01:48:48,862
I really am happy about that.

2130
01:48:49,404 --> 01:48:50,947
Yeah.

2131
01:48:54,534 --> 01:48:57,912
I'll stop by Jeff's room
and get my money on my way out.

2132
01:49:04,919 --> 01:49:05,920
Ray.

2133
01:49:07,672 --> 01:49:09,549
Margie, you ain't gotta leave, baby.

2134
01:49:09,716 --> 01:49:11,676
I'm on your hit record.

2135
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:14,679
If I'm ever going to go solo,
then now's the time.

2136
01:49:14,721 --> 01:49:16,556
Yeah, I ... I don't want you ...

2137
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:18,475
I don't want you to go solo.

2138
01:49:18,558 --> 01:49:21,019
Ray, for once,
I'm doing something for me.

2139
01:49:22,061 --> 01:49:24,522
You remember the hummingbird,
right?

2140
01:49:25,315 --> 01:49:26,316
What?

2141
01:49:26,983 --> 01:49:28,735
The hummingbird, Bea.

2142
01:49:41,664 --> 01:49:43,833
And I don't want you to go.

2143
01:49:57,138 --> 01:49:58,598
Somebody will fetch you ...

2144
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,183
when your bus gets to St. Augustine.

2145
01:50:00,266 --> 01:50:02,393
And when you get there,
show them this sign,

2146
01:50:02,477 --> 01:50:04,813
and tell them you're name is
Ray Charles Robinson.

2147
01:50:05,772 --> 01:50:08,691
And them sandwiches I made, don't
eat 'em all at once. You hear?

2148
01:50:08,775 --> 01:50:10,985
Oh, please, don't make me go away.

2149
01:50:11,069 --> 01:50:12,695
I'll keep up with the normal kids.

2150
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:14,739
I'll be good, just like George.

2151
01:50:14,823 --> 01:50:16,783
This ain't got nothing
to do with George.

2152
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:19,327
I've taken you
as far as I can, baby.

2153
01:50:19,494 --> 01:50:22,747
Them teachers at that blind school,
they can teach you things I can't.

2154
01:50:22,789 --> 01:50:24,541
And you need an education
in this world.

2155
01:50:24,624 --> 01:50:25,792
I don't want no education!

2156
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:26,876
Don't say that!

2157
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,878
I don't! I want to stay with you!

2158
01:50:28,962 --> 01:50:29,963
Stop it, Ray!

2159
01:50:30,046 --> 01:50:32,715
I won't have you living
hand-to-mouth like me, you hear?

2160
01:50:33,591 --> 01:50:37,011
Now listen, if you want to do
something to make your mama proud,

2161
01:50:37,303 --> 01:50:41,099
promise me, promise me you'll never
let nobody turn you into no cripple.

2162
01:50:41,182 --> 01:50:42,892
You won't become no charity case.

2163
01:50:42,976 --> 01:50:44,894
You'll stand on your own two feet.

2164
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:46,312
I promise.

2165
01:50:46,646 --> 01:50:48,106
I love you, baby.

2166
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:50,608
I'm so proud of you.

2167
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:06,749
No more segregation!

2168
01:51:06,833 --> 01:51:09,836
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2169
01:51:09,919 --> 01:51:13,006
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2170
01:51:16,968 --> 01:51:19,763
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2171
01:51:19,846 --> 01:51:22,849
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2172
01:51:22,932 --> 01:51:25,977
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2173
01:51:26,019 --> 01:51:27,812
Welcome back to Augusta, Ray!

2174
01:51:27,854 --> 01:51:29,606
Hey, good to see you.

2175
01:51:29,898 --> 01:51:32,859
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2176
01:51:32,901 --> 01:51:34,694
Do you believe
in the protest, Ray?

2177
01:51:35,028 --> 01:51:36,404
Get out of here!

2178
01:51:36,488 --> 01:51:39,032
Ray, I'm sorry about this.
Hurry on up inside.

2179
01:51:39,115 --> 01:51:40,867
We got refreshments waiting.

2180
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:42,577
Mr. Charles!
Mr. Charles!

2181
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,370
You know tonight's show
is segregated?

2182
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:46,080
The dance floor is whites only.

2183
01:51:46,164 --> 01:51:47,582
Negroes can't leave the balcony.

2184
01:51:47,665 --> 01:51:49,751
That's how it is, man.
You know, this is Georgia.

2185
01:51:49,834 --> 01:51:51,127
You think we don't know that?

2186
01:51:51,211 --> 01:51:53,546
Negroes are persecuted
in this state every day!

2187
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:55,548
Ain't nothing I can do about that.

2188
01:51:55,632 --> 01:51:58,718
I'm an entertainer. And ... and we
all gotta play Jim Crow down here.

2189
01:51:58,802 --> 01:52:00,553
I'm sorry, man.
Now get out of here, boy.

2190
01:52:00,637 --> 01:52:01,971
It doesn't have to be that way.

2191
01:52:02,055 --> 01:52:04,307
You could change things,
right here and now!

2192
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:06,017
I'm sorry, son.
Ain't nothing I can do.

2193
01:52:06,059 --> 01:52:08,103
You hear that, boy?
That's the way things are.

2194
01:52:08,186 --> 01:52:09,813
Ain't nothing
or nobody can change it.

2195
01:52:09,896 --> 01:52:12,732
Now get your black ass out of here,
and take that trash with you!

2196
01:52:12,774 --> 01:52:16,069
Hold on ... hold on. He ...
he's right. He's right, Jeff.

2197
01:52:16,152 --> 01:52:17,195
Get them on the bus.

2198
01:52:17,278 --> 01:52:18,279
You sure?

2199
01:52:18,363 --> 01:52:19,572
Get them back on the bus!

2200
01:52:19,656 --> 01:52:21,282
Y'all heard him! Y'all heard Ray!

2201
01:52:21,366 --> 01:52:23,118
Back on the bus!

2202
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:24,994
Are you serious?

2203
01:52:26,246 --> 01:52:27,372
Get them on the bus.

2204
01:52:27,413 --> 01:52:28,915
I can't do nothing here.

2205
01:52:28,957 --> 01:52:30,250
Ray, you know me.

2206
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:33,711
I'm not gonna lose money just
because you suddenly got religion.

2207
01:52:33,753 --> 01:52:34,921
Ain't nothing I can do, man.

2208
01:52:35,004 --> 01:52:37,424
We have a contract with me.
You break it, I'll sue your ass!

2209
01:52:37,507 --> 01:52:39,592
- I'll win, Ray!
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

2210
01:52:39,676 --> 01:52:40,635
Look, I'll win big!

2211
01:52:40,718 --> 01:52:41,803
Do what you gotta do.

2212
01:52:41,886 --> 01:52:43,638
I told you, I'll own your ass, Ray!

2213
01:52:45,432 --> 01:52:46,599
Thank you, Mr. Charles.

2214
01:52:46,683 --> 01:52:48,059
You could be the first.

2215
01:52:48,101 --> 01:52:49,727
No, thank you, son.
You were right.

2216
01:52:49,811 --> 01:52:51,354
You're right.

2217
01:52:52,981 --> 01:52:55,066
You'll never work Georgia again!

2218
01:52:56,693 --> 01:53:00,113
He filed a lawsuit and
it's more than a fine, Ray.

2219
01:53:00,738 --> 01:53:04,075
This guy's got juice. He can get you
barred from ever playing Georgia again.

2220
01:53:04,909 --> 01:53:08,204
But he's willing to drop the
suit if you'll make up the gig.

2221
01:53:08,705 --> 01:53:10,665
Not if it's segregated.

2222
01:53:10,957 --> 01:53:11,916
Ray,

2223
01:53:13,626 --> 01:53:16,588
I admire what you're doing, man,
but you can't afford this.

2224
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:18,298
Georgia is
our highest-grossing state.

2225
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:22,135
I'm not playing any more to Jim Crow

Yeah. I got it.

Yeah. What's going on?

2246
01:54:15,647 --> 01:54:16,981
Just kids onstage dancing.

We have a telegram for you.

2271
01:55:12,745 --> 01:55:14,122
You have to sign for it, sir.

2272
01:55:14,205 --> 01:55:15,206
I'm coming.

2273
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:23,006
Indianapolis police. Got a report
of loud music coming from here.

2274
01:55:23,089 --> 01:55:25,216
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

2275
01:55:26,468 --> 01:55:28,052
I'm just going to the bathroom.

2276
01:55:28,094 --> 01:55:29,846
Handcuff this son of a bitch.

2277
01:55:30,555 --> 01:55:33,516
Recognize this, Ray?
Heroin's a felony.

2278
01:55:34,058 --> 01:55:36,019
It ain't like I'm dealing it, man.

2279
01:55:36,102 --> 01:55:37,562
I'm not hurting nobody.

2280
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:39,522
Oh, no, you're hurting everybody.

2281
01:55:39,731 --> 01:55:42,650
Your jungle music is
poisoning our kids' minds.

2282
01:55:42,734 --> 01:55:44,903
Hey, I'm gonna put
your black ass away forever.

2283
01:55:44,944 --> 01:55:48,364
You have to understand.
I got ... I got a wife, I got kids.

2284
01:55:48,448 --> 01:55:49,616
I got responsibilities.

2285
01:55:49,657 --> 01:55:51,701
Why don't you tell that story
to these people.

2286
01:55:51,785 --> 01:55:53,161
Bring them in!

2287
01:55:56,122 --> 01:55:57,916
Ray! Was it a setup, Ray?

2288
01:55:57,957 --> 01:55:59,834
How long you been on heroin?

2289
01:55:59,918 --> 01:56:01,294
Come on, Ray.

2290
01:56:01,336 --> 01:56:03,379

2299
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:46,339
David.

2300
01:56:46,381 --> 01:56:47,841
Uh, uh, Bea, he can stay.

2301
01:56:47,924 --> 01:56:49,509
No. Baby, come on.

2302
01:56:49,968 --> 01:56:51,261
- Bea?
- What?

2303
01:56:52,929 --> 01:56:54,180
You know, since I got back ...

2304
01:56:54,264 --> 01:56:55,890
Since you got out.

2305
01:56:56,099 --> 01:56:57,350
Yeah.

2306
01:56:57,725 --> 01:57:01,312
Well, since I got here, you haven't
said more than two words to me.

2307
01:57:01,521 --> 01:57:03,481
Ray, what am I supposed to say?

2308
01:57:03,857 --> 01:57:06,401
My words don't seem to
mean much to you anymore.

2309
01:57:06,484 --> 01:57:07,902
Maybe they never did.

2310
01:57:07,986 --> 01:57:10,196
Come on, Bea,
you ... you know I love you.

2311
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:11,990
Are you gonna stop then?

2312
01:57:14,033 --> 01:57:16,119
You know what, Bea, what you
don't understand is ...

2313
01:57:16,202 --> 01:57:18,496
there's a lot of mean-spirited
people out there.

2314
01:57:19,706 --> 01:57:20,665
Yeah.

2315
01:57:25,712 --> 01:57:26,838
Ray?

2316
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:33,261
You know, I had to bring Junior
home from school today ...

2317
01:57:33,344 --> 01:57:35,180
'cause of what
the other kids were sayin'.

2318
01:57:35,221 --> 01:57:36,723
They got mean-ass kids
around here.

2319
01:57:36,765 --> 01:57:38,725
I think we should move
to Beverly Hills.

2320
01:57:38,767 --> 01:57:40,310
No, no, Ray,
we're not gonna move.

2321
01:57:40,393 --> 01:57:42,353
'Cause it ... it's not
about where we live, Ray.

2322
01:57:42,395 --> 01:57:44,773
It's about what you're doing
to yourself.

2323
01:57:45,064 --> 01:57:46,691
And those boys worship you.

2324
01:57:46,733 --> 01:57:49,152
You want them to end up
using that poison, too?

2325
01:57:49,235 --> 01:57:50,904
Bea, that's not fair.

2326
01:57:50,945 --> 01:57:53,615
What's not fair?
What's not fair, Ray?

2327
01:57:53,698 --> 01:57:55,867
That ... that's a low blow.

2328
01:57:58,244 --> 01:57:59,245
Hello?

2329
01:58:00,747 --> 01:58:04,000
Don't jive me, Milt.
Don't jive me, man!

2330
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:05,210
Really?

2331
01:58:05,543 --> 01:58:09,130
Ah, good, good, good. Tell ...
tell Sam I said thank you.

2332
01:58:09,214 --> 01:58:11,216
All right. All right, then.

2333
01:58:12,759 --> 01:58:13,802
Oh, yeah!

2334
01:58:13,885 --> 01:58:16,596
What, Ray?
What? Come on, now.

2335
01:58:16,638 --> 01:58:18,473
Ray, tell me what happened.

2336
01:58:18,556 --> 01:58:20,767
ABC got the case dropped.

2337
01:58:20,809 --> 01:58:22,602
The police didn't have a warrant.

2338
01:58:22,685 --> 01:58:23,853
They bought them off.

2339
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:25,897
Damn it, Bea, do you
want me to go to prison?

2340
01:58:25,939 --> 01:58:28,441
No. Ray, I want you
to stop lying to yourself,

2341
01:58:28,483 --> 01:58:30,568
and they are making that
completely impossible.

2342
01:58:30,652 --> 01:58:32,195
You know what,
you don't understand.

2343
01:58:32,278 --> 01:58:33,947
Then make me understand, Ray!

2344
01:58:34,030 --> 01:58:37,408
Baby, when I walk out that door,
I walk out alone in the dark!

2345
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,868
I'm trying to do something ...

2346
01:58:38,952 --> 01:58:41,621
that ain't nobody ever done
in music and business.

2347
01:58:41,704 --> 01:58:44,374
But I can't do it if I'm alone
everywhere I go.

2348
01:58:44,958 --> 01:58:47,293
I don't want to be alone here, Bea.

2349
01:58:47,377 --> 01:58:49,129
Not in my own home.

2350
01:58:52,799 --> 01:58:55,427
Look, Bea,
if you don't understand me,

2351
01:58:56,302 --> 01:58:57,846
then who will?

2352
01:59:04,394 --> 01:59:05,979
I don't know, Ray.

2353
01:59:09,607 --> 01:59:11,943
David? I'm coming!

2354
01:59:13,027 --> 01:59:14,487
Mama's coming!

2355
01:59:18,324 --> 01:59:22,245
Ray, we pull you out of the fire,
and you want country music?

2356
01:59:22,328 --> 01:59:25,415
Look here, I've been singing
country music all my life.

2357
01:59:25,498 --> 01:59:27,959
As a matter of fact, I used to
play with the Florida Playboys.

2358
01:59:28,042 --> 01:59:29,544
We made a big investment in you ...

2359
01:59:29,627 --> 01:59:31,087
and it's paying off handsomely.

2360
01:59:31,171 --> 01:59:32,839
For both of us, I might add.

2361
01:59:32,922 --> 01:59:34,466
We don't want to lose your fan base.

2362
01:59:34,549 --> 01:59:36,634
Yeah, you know,
you got a point there,

2363
01:59:36,676 --> 01:59:40,138
but I actually think that we have
more to gain than we do to lose.

2364
01:59:41,097 --> 01:59:43,767
Ray, it's a bad idea.

2365
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:48,229
When I came to ABC, you guys
put in the contract ...

2366
01:59:48,313 --> 01:59:50,356
that I can choose my own music.

2367
01:59:51,232 --> 01:59:52,984
You want to read that paragraph?

2368
01:59:57,197 --> 01:59:58,907
It's on page three.

2369
02:00:00,241 --> 02:00:01,826
I don't need to see it.

2370
02:00:11,211 --> 02:00:13,421
Good evening, Saint Louis.

2371
02:00:13,505 --> 02:00:15,882
It's time
for the main attraction.

2372
02:00:15,924 --> 02:00:19,511
The innovator of soul.
The genius himself.

2373
02:00:19,844 --> 02:00:21,638
Ray Charles!

2374
02:00:41,074 --> 02:00:42,242
Go on, go on, Ray!

2375
02:00:47,413 --> 02:00:48,665
Thank you so much.

2376
02:00:48,748 --> 02:00:51,918

lot of y'all don't know that ...

02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:55,130
I ... I was brought up in the South.

2378
02:00:55,213 --> 02:00:58,341
You know, every time you turn
on the radio there in the South,

2379
02:00:58,425 --> 02:00:59,759
you hear the Grand Ole Opry.

2380
02:00:59,843 --> 02:01:02,971
That's what I grew up singing,
so I hope you don't mind,

2381
02:01:03,596 --> 02:01:07,100

The two, right there, I got it
sewn in thick, so I can feel it.

2407

So, it means two is brown.

2408
02:02:35,355 --> 02:02:37,690
One is black. Three is blue.

Change back at the hotel.

2420
02:03:23,903 --> 02:03:25,989
They bought that country
jive hook, line and sinker.

2421
02:03:26,072 --> 02:03:27,240
Ray, man, you're amazing.

2422
02:03:27,323 --> 02:03:30,452
I'm gonna tell you something. Country
music. You know why they like it?

2423
02:03:30,535 --> 02:03:32,662
The stories, man.
They got great stories.

2424
02:03:32,745 --> 02:03:33,788
Hey, Joe.

2425
02:03:33,872 --> 02:03:37,250
Ray, I want to introduce you to
Joe Adams. Hal Ziegler hired Joe ...

2426
02:03:37,292 --> 02:03:39,669
as the announcer
for the rest of the tour.

2427
02:03:39,753 --> 02:03:42,255
I know you, Mayor of Melody.

2428
02:03:42,338 --> 02:03:44,799
I used to listen to your
radio show in L.A. In the '50s.

2429
02:03:44,883 --> 02:03:47,427
We've both come a ways since then.

2430
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:50,138
What was that counting
you were doing back there?

2431
02:03:50,263 --> 02:03:52,807
I was cueing down the lights.
That shuts up the audience ...

2432
02:03:52,891 --> 02:03:55,518
so you can sing your ballad
instead of having to scream it.

2433
02:03:55,602 --> 02:03:57,896
Hey, well, I'll be damned.
Who told you to do that?

2434
02:03:57,937 --> 02:03:59,689
No one. It just needed to be done.

2435
02:03:59,773 --> 02:04:01,608
See, that's what I'm talking about.

2436
02:04:01,691 --> 02:04:04,611
I like to hear a person say
"It needed to be done" ...

2437
02:04:04,652 --> 02:04:06,154
as opposed to a person saying,
"It ain't my job."

2438
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:07,914
Well, You know ...

2439
02:04:08,114 --> 02:04:10,116
You know,
tell me about Central Avenue.

2440
02:04:10,283 --> 02:04:11,618

Ray, I got some good news for you.

2448
02:04:27,759 --> 02:04:29,344
We got the cover of Cash Box.

2449
02:04:29,427 --> 02:04:32,639
The nation's hottest album:
"Modern Sounds of Country & Western."

2450
02:04:32,722 --> 02:04:33,765
Man, you are hotter than hell.

2451
02:04:33,848 --> 02:04:34,849
That's what they say.

2452
02:04:34,933 --> 02:04:37,310
I've been watchin', your albums
are going through the roof,

2453
02:04:37,393 --> 02:04:39,145
your concerts are
always selling out.

2454
02:04:39,187 --> 02:04:40,772
You'll need shelters
for your money.

2455
02:04:40,814 --> 02:04:42,357
You're in a new tax bracket.

2456
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:45,276
Keep your drawers on, Fathead!
I got the instruments!

2457
02:04:45,318 --> 02:04:47,821
Jeff, Joe was in
the film Carmen Jones.

2458
02:04:47,862 --> 02:04:49,405
Who was the director again?

2459
02:04:49,489 --> 02:04:50,532
Otto Preminger.

2460
02:04:50,615 --> 02:04:53,701
He was also on Broadway
with Lena Horne.

2461
02:04:53,827 --> 02:04:56,287
She was the star.
I was supporting.

2462
02:04:56,454 --> 02:04:57,997
Is that a fact?

2463
02:04:58,164 --> 02:05:01,418

Bea, there's a park right
at the end of the street.

2482
02:05:53,845 --> 02:05:56,097
You can see the whole L.A.
Basin from there.

2483
02:05:56,181 --> 02:05:58,349
Not even Beverly Hills
has views like that.

2484
02:05:58,391 --> 02:06:01,102
How does it look, Bea, huh?
You like it, don't you?

2485
02:06:01,186 --> 02:06:02,687
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

2486
02:06:02,771 --> 02:06:04,230
You got to like it.

2487
02:06:04,272 --> 02:06:05,273
Voilà.

2488
02:06:05,356 --> 02:06:08,693
This foyer is designed to impress
anybody who walks through the door.

2489
02:06:08,735 --> 02:06:11,780
It has a big winding staircase,
just like "Gone With the Wind".

2490
02:06:11,863 --> 02:06:15,033
We should get our portraits
painted, like Rhett and Scarlett.

2491
02:06:15,241 --> 02:06:16,743
Bea, bring him on in here.

2492
02:06:16,826 --> 02:06:19,245
Ray, wait till you hear
what's waiting in the living room.

2493
02:06:19,287 --> 02:06:20,288
What is it?

2494
02:06:20,413 --> 02:06:24,250
I had them build you a solid
marble fireplace, two stories high.

2495
02:06:24,334 --> 02:06:26,503
Hot damn! How do you like it, Bea?

2496
02:06:26,586 --> 02:06:27,670
It's awful big.

2497
02:06:27,754 --> 02:06:29,339
It sure is: 8,500 square feet.

2498
02:06:29,422 --> 02:06:31,216
Biggest house in the neighborhood.

2499
02:06:31,257 --> 02:06:33,051
So, does this meet
with your approval?

2500
02:06:33,093 --> 02:06:34,594
Man, this is a palace.

2501
02:06:34,677 --> 02:06:37,180
You think this is big? Wait
until tomorrow when you see ...

2502
02:06:37,263 --> 02:06:39,557
30,000 square feet
of RPM Incorporated.

2503
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,392
Yeah, headquarters!

2504
02:06:41,434 --> 02:06:43,812
This is it, Ray.
Your brand-new recording studio.

2505

2506
02:06:45,605 --> 02:06:46,856
Totally state-of-the-art.

2507
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:50,902
Tom Dowd built an eight-track mixing
console, two recorders, the works.

2508
02:06:50,944 --> 02:06:53,363
Now, this room is bigger
than most people's houses.

2509
02:06:53,446 --> 02:06:55,865
- Got your own private bathroom
to your left. - Good.

Right behind you
is my adjoining office.

2511
02:06:58,284 --> 02:07:00,620
And step over to your
private bar to your left.

2512
02:07:00,703 --> 02:07:02,622
Got a bottle of Bols
right in the center.

2513
02:07:02,664 --> 02:07:04,082
You know me pretty good.

2514
02:07:04,124 --> 02:07:06,543

Ray.

2530
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:50,336
Yes, I'll get on a plane and
I'll be there as soon as I can.

2531
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:51,755
What happened?

2532
02:07:53,882 --> 02:07:55,216
Margie's dead.

Oh, God! H-How?

2534
02:07:59,012 --> 02:08:00,513
She overdosed.

2535
02:08:03,892 --> 02:08:05,685
I didn't start her, Bea.

2536
02:08:06,853 --> 02:08:08,313
I didn't let her do dope around me.

2537
02:08:08,396 --> 02:08:10,356
I ... I just wouldn't
let that happen.

2538
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,693
Yes, I'm sure, Ray.
I'm sure you set a fine example.

2539
02:08:17,864 --> 02:08:19,616
What about her baby?

2540
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:25,371
You knew?

2541
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:28,124
His name is Charles Wayne.

2542
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:32,337
He was born October 1, in
New York City. He's 3 years old.

2543
02:08:33,296 --> 02:08:34,798
The baby's fine.

2544
02:08:35,715 --> 02:08:37,509
He's at her sister's.

2545
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:41,221
All right. I'll start sending
them some money.

2546
02:08:41,304 --> 02:08:44,390
You don't have to.
I send them money every month.

2547
02:09:09,249 --> 02:09:10,875
In five minutes,
Mr. Charles will be here,

2548
02:09:10,917 --> 02:09:12,419
and he'll be ready to go.

2549
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:14,045
Now the charts
Jeff is handing out ...

2550
02:09:14,087 --> 02:09:16,923
should be turned in
at the conclusion of ...

2551
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:19,592
You're late, that's a $50 fine.

2552
02:09:20,135 --> 02:09:21,594
I ain't late.

2553
02:09:21,636 --> 02:09:23,721
I give them
a 10-minute grace period, Joe.

2554
02:09:23,805 --> 02:09:27,100
Five minutes after two.
He's late. He'll be charged $50.

2555
02:09:27,183 --> 02:09:29,686
What? You know what?
Where's Ray?

2556
02:09:29,769 --> 02:09:32,105
You don't have to talk to Ray,
you're talking to me.

2557
02:09:32,188 --> 02:09:36,401
I'll talk to whoever I damn well
please, and it sure as hell ain't you.

2558
02:09:36,443 --> 02:09:37,777

Hey, Ray,

2560
02:09:43,783 --> 02:09:47,912

02:09:48,204 --> 02:09:49,664
What time did you get here?

2562
02:09:49,748 --> 02:09:53,752
What? Just now.
The band's still setting up.

2563
02:09:54,335 --> 02:09:55,962
- Jeff don't ...
- Look, I'm not Jeff.

2564
02:09:56,045 --> 02:09:57,797
That's a fact, Jack!

2565
02:09:58,965 --> 02:10:01,634
Ray, you said the band was my thing.

2566
02:10:01,718 --> 02:10:03,178
It is.

2567
02:10:03,261 --> 02:10:05,930
Then, Fathead,
you go on back to rehearsal.

2568
02:10:06,973 --> 02:10:08,308
Ray.

2569
02:10:08,767 --> 02:10:11,186
Ray, you know how it is,
you've been there.

2570
02:10:11,728 --> 02:10:14,063
Fathead, go on now.
Let me handle this.

2571
02:10:14,147 --> 02:10:15,857
Fathead, go on now.

2572
02:10:19,319 --> 02:10:21,404
You want to tell me what the hell
is going on, Ray?

2573
02:10:21,488 --> 02:10:23,490
I'm not doing anything
I haven't been asked to.

2574
02:10:23,573 --> 02:10:25,116
Ray's running a business.

2575
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:28,244
He shouldn't have to waste time
hearing why people were late.

2576
02:10:28,328 --> 02:10:30,121
I'm not talking to you, Joe.

2577
02:10:30,163 --> 02:10:31,915
I'm talking to Ray.

2578
02:10:36,878 --> 02:10:39,839
Ray, now I know you think
I'm soft on the band,

2579
02:10:39,881 --> 02:10:42,258
but those cats would do
whatever I ask.

2580
02:10:42,342 --> 02:10:45,011
But If you come in here with this,
uh, "running a business" crap,

2581
02:10:45,053 --> 02:10:47,305
you're gonna lose some good people.
I'm telling you, Ray.

2582
02:10:47,347 --> 02:10:49,766
There are musicians waiting in
line to play with Ray Charles.

2583
02:10:49,849 --> 02:10:52,685
Not for long,
once they get a taste of you.

2584
02:10:53,353 --> 02:10:55,563
Ray, you're the leader, man.
Be one! Come on, now.

2585
02:10:55,647 --> 02:10:57,649
You now what Jeff, I mean
things have changed.

2586
02:10:57,690 --> 02:11:00,777
It ain't like the days when it was
seven of us on the Chitlin' Circuit.

2587
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:04,322
I mean, if you weren't busy building
a bowling alley, you'd seen that.

2588
02:11:04,697 --> 02:11:06,533
So you know about that, huh?

2589
02:11:06,991 --> 02:11:08,910
I know about everything.

2590
02:11:09,536 --> 02:11:11,496
I'm just trying to figure out
how you did it.

2591
02:11:11,579 --> 02:11:13,206
You think
I'm stealing from you, Ray?

2592
02:11:13,289 --> 02:11:16,543
If the Shaw Agency is gonna give you
a cut of the 10% I'm given them.

2593
02:11:16,626 --> 02:11:19,587
I might as well keep the
goddamn money in my pocket.

2594
02:11:19,879 --> 02:11:22,173
Leave us alone. We need to talk.

2595
02:11:23,258 --> 02:11:24,342
Ray.

2596
02:11:24,759 --> 02:11:26,803
You can step outside, Joe.

2597
02:11:28,638 --> 02:11:30,432
I'll be in my office.

2598
02:11:35,895 --> 02:11:39,774
Ray, now I know that jealous bastard
planted that lie in your head.

2599
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:43,403
But I have never stolen
from you, Ray, and I never will.

2600
02:11:43,445 --> 02:11:47,282
I got a small business loan, and, yeah,
Milt Shaw was giving me a little extra,

2601
02:11:47,365 --> 02:11:48,992
but I'm not a thief, Ray.

2602
02:11:49,075 --> 02:11:50,410
Then what about that, Jeff, huh?

2603
02:11:50,452 --> 02:11:54,539
A promoter swearing you did side deals
with him so you could split my overages!

2604
02:11:54,622 --> 02:11:56,499
How could you do that to me?

2605
02:11:56,583 --> 02:11:58,668
We've been through so much,
we be so like brothers.

2606
02:11:58,752 --> 02:12:00,462
You know what, Ray?

2607
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:04,549
If we were like brothers,

2608
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:07,302
why are you paying Joe
more than you're paying me?

2609
02:12:07,385 --> 02:12:09,763
Damn all that!
You broke my heart, man.

2610
02:12:09,804 --> 02:12:14,142
Well, you know what, Ray? You broke
mine a long goddamn time ago!

2611
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:16,936
Well, then there it is.

2612
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,195
You know something, Ray?

2613
02:12:25,278 --> 02:12:27,071
You're going to get yours one day.

2614
02:12:27,113 --> 02:12:30,950
And I pray to God that he has mercy
on your soul, you son of a bitch!

2615
02:12:38,708 --> 02:12:40,752
Everything all right, Ray?

2616
02:12:41,961 --> 02:12:44,297
How the hell do you think it is?

2617
02:12:54,974 --> 02:12:58,311
Go tell him. Go tell him!
Go, go tell him.

2618
02:12:59,896 --> 02:13:01,272
Hey, Dad. Hi, there.

2619
02:13:01,314 --> 02:13:03,358
I made the all-star team!
The game's on Thursday.

2620
02:13:03,441 --> 02:13:04,484
Oh, that's great.

2621
02:13:04,567 --> 02:13:07,320
Oh, damn! I'm not gonna be in town.
I'm gotta go on tour.

2622
02:13:07,362 --> 02:13:09,948
How about I buy you guys
new uniforms, huh?

2623
02:13:10,031 --> 02:13:12,075
Tell the coach I don't care
how much they cost.

2624
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:13,076
Okay.

2625
02:13:13,159 --> 02:13:15,703
All right, son, you want to take
your dad's briefcase inside.

2626
02:13:15,787 --> 02:13:18,415
The plane to Montreal leaves at 11:00.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

2627
02:13:18,498 --> 02:13:19,457
All right.

2628
02:13:19,999 --> 02:13:21,960
Did you hear what
Ray Junior said to you?

2629
02:13:22,001 --> 02:13:22,961
Yeah.

2630
02:13:23,002 --> 02:13:25,338
Do you know how much making the
all-star team means to him?

2631
02:13:25,422 --> 02:13:27,882
I know. I got things on my mind.
We had to fire Jeff.

2632
02:13:27,966 --> 02:13:28,967
What?

2633
02:13:29,008 --> 02:13:30,051
He was stealing.

2634
02:13:30,135 --> 02:13:31,219
- Jeff?
- Hmm.

2635
02:13:31,302 --> 02:13:32,595
I don't believe it.

2636
02:13:32,679 --> 02:13:34,639
Yeah, well,
we're better without him.

U.S. Customs!

2647
02:14:39,287 --> 02:14:41,581
We're goanna need to see some
identification, please.

2648
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,416
You just arrived from Montreal?

2649
02:14:43,458 --> 02:14:44,876
Yes. Is there a problem?

2650
02:14:44,918 --> 02:14:47,253
We were alerted there might
be drugs on this plane.

2651
02:14:47,337 --> 02:14:49,714
What? That's outrageous!
I'm going to call our lawyer.

2652
02:14:49,756 --> 02:14:52,008
No lawyers
at international checkpoints.

2653
02:14:52,092 --> 02:14:54,594
Now, we're going to have to
search everyone on this plane.

2654
02:14:54,677 --> 02:14:57,430
Mr. Charles, if you don't mind
we'd like to start with you.

2655
02:14:57,472 --> 02:14:59,349
I'd like to see your overcoat.

2656
02:14:59,432 --> 02:15:00,642
I don't mind.

2657
02:15:00,725 --> 02:15:02,102
Don't say anything, Ray.

2658
02:15:02,769 --> 02:15:03,812
What's this?

2659
02:15:05,772 --> 02:15:08,149
Ray, this isn't some judge
in Indiana.

2660
02:15:08,233 --> 02:15:10,276
It's federal.
They can charge you with smuggling ...

2661
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:12,070
which can mean real prison time.

2662
02:15:13,363 --> 02:15:16,366
Our lawyers will do
what they can, but ...

2663
02:15:36,136 --> 02:15:37,470
Hello.

2664
02:15:39,597 --> 02:15:41,474
You can't hide out
in here forever, Ray.

2665
02:15:41,516 --> 02:15:43,351
Look, it's my house.
I'm not in prison yet.

2666
02:15:43,435 --> 02:15:44,477
No, it's my house.

2667
02:15:44,561 --> 02:15:47,439
You ain't been here more than
six days since we moved in.

2668
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:49,566
No, Ray, no!
A needle ain't gonna solve this!

2669
02:15:49,649 --> 02:15:50,608
Get out of the way. Move!

2670
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:52,485
Only thing
that can help you is God, Ray.

2671
02:15:52,569 --> 02:15:55,280
Don't think of God? Do you have any
idea how it feels to go blind ...

2672
02:15:55,321 --> 02:15:56,781
and still be afraid of the dark?

2673
02:15:56,823 --> 02:15:59,993
And every day, you stand pray for just
a little light, and you get nothing.

2674
02:16:00,076 --> 02:16:01,911
'Cause God don't listen
to people like me.

2675
02:16:01,995 --> 02:16:03,037
Stop talking like that.

2676
02:16:03,121 --> 02:16:05,999
As far as I'm concerned, me and
God is even and I do what I please.

2677
02:16:06,082 --> 02:16:08,126
If goddamn it, if I want
to shoot up, I shoot up.

2678
02:16:08,209 --> 02:16:10,920
Then go ahead!
But you walk out that door ...

2679
02:16:11,004 --> 02:16:13,339
and I'm doing something I should
have done a long time ago.

2680
02:16:13,423 --> 02:16:15,175
I'm taking my boys and I'll leave.

2681
02:16:15,216 --> 02:16:17,260
You're not going away.
You ... you have no place to go.

2682
02:16:17,343 --> 02:16:18,845
- No place?
- No.

2683
02:16:18,928 --> 02:16:21,014
You think I'm scared of losing this?

2684
02:16:21,097 --> 02:16:24,017
Ray, the only thing I was
ever scared of losing was you.

2685
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:27,228
Because where was I ever gonna
find another Ray Robinson?

2686
02:16:28,730 --> 02:16:31,316
So I put up with
some terrible stuff.

2687
02:16:31,524 --> 02:16:33,359
Maybe that makes me part to blame.

2688
02:16:33,443 --> 02:16:34,778
But I ain't scared no more.

2689
02:16:34,861 --> 02:16:37,530
You know I love you and those
boys more than anything.

2690
02:16:37,614 --> 02:16:40,033
That is a damn lie
and you know it!

2691
02:16:41,576 --> 02:16:43,244
You ever look at this?

2692
02:16:43,495 --> 02:16:45,747
Really look at it, Ray!

2693
02:16:46,081 --> 02:16:49,167
Ray Charles Junior's
"Most Valuable Player."

2694
02:16:50,585 --> 02:16:52,754
He was so proud this day,

2695
02:16:53,838 --> 02:16:57,717
until you came home too loaded
to go to his banquet.

2696
02:16:57,759 --> 02:17:01,054
No! No! There is something you
love more than me and them boys,

2697
02:17:01,096 --> 02:17:03,765
more than all the women you
ever slept with on the road,

2698
02:17:03,848 --> 02:17:05,475
more than all
the dope you ever took.

2699
02:17:05,558 --> 02:17:07,894
- What are you talking about?
- Your music.

2700
02:17:09,771 --> 02:17:12,107
And if you don't stop
using that needle,

2701
02:17:12,232 --> 02:17:15,360
they're gonna take away your
music and put you in jail.

2702
02:17:19,239 --> 02:17:21,574
Is that poison
worth losing everything?

2703
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:05,368
Mr. Charles?

2704
02:18:17,756 --> 02:18:19,257
Mr. Charles.

2705
02:18:19,924 --> 02:18:21,718
You don't have to go through this.

2706
02:18:22,594 --> 02:18:26,431
We have a substitute that can
help wean you off heroin.

2707
02:18:26,765 --> 02:18:30,977
I have to do it on my own.
I can do it. I can do it.

2708
02:18:31,686 --> 02:18:33,146
Ah. Don't touch me.

2709
02:18:36,483 --> 02:18:37,817
All right.

2710
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:40,028
We'll do it your way.

2711
02:18:51,122 --> 02:18:52,457
Doctor?

2712
02:18:52,707 --> 02:18:55,752
Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles,
I'm coming.

2713
02:18:56,503 --> 02:18:58,213
He's got no fluids left.

2714
02:18:58,338 --> 02:19:00,090
Get an I.V. in him right away.

2715
02:19:00,507 --> 02:19:02,342
- I'll insert the needle.
- No needles.

2716
02:19:02,425 --> 02:19:04,344
Yes. It's very important.
You need this.

2717
02:19:04,427 --> 02:19:06,346
Runner, I've got a runner!

2718
02:19:07,013 --> 02:19:08,014
Whoa.

2719
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:12,018
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Get him on the bed.

2720
02:19:12,602 --> 02:19:15,105
Put those restraints on him.

2721
02:19:15,563 --> 02:19:17,148
No needles.

2722
02:19:35,417 --> 02:19:36,876
No, no.

2723
02:19:37,877 --> 02:19:39,254
Oh.

2724
02:19:43,258 --> 02:19:45,593
George, I miss you.
I miss you, George.

2725
02:19:45,718 --> 02:19:48,054
I miss you.

2726
02:19:52,725 --> 02:19:54,060
Oh.

2727
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:08,825
- Okay.
- Uh-oh.

2728
02:20:08,908 --> 02:20:11,202
You might be in trouble
right there, Doc.

2729
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:22,505
Hot damn,
you whupped my ass again!

2730
02:20:22,589 --> 02:20:25,341
I — I'll tell you what, I won't
lose again the same way twice.

2731
02:20:25,425 --> 02:20:28,887
I spoke with the judge in Boston,
and he'll agree to probation.

2732
02:20:29,179 --> 02:20:31,431
He was impressed with
your attorney's arguments,

2733
02:20:31,514 --> 02:20:33,558
and he believes
you deserve one more chance.

2734
02:20:33,641 --> 02:20:35,059
Oh, that's great.

2735
02:20:35,101 --> 02:20:37,103
But you must complete
our program ...

2736
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:39,230
and agree to take
periodic drug tests.

2737
02:20:39,314 --> 02:20:41,566
You know what. I'll do it.
I know people don't believe ...

2738
02:20:41,608 --> 02:20:43,818
I'm done with this dope,
but I'm finished.

2739
02:20:44,778 --> 02:20:46,112
Who's George?

2740
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:51,993
Ray,

2741
02:20:52,619 --> 02:20:55,413
you've come through the worst of
the physical reactions.

2742
02:20:55,997 --> 02:20:58,833
We should begin
psychotherapy sessions.

2743
02:20:58,917 --> 02:21:01,503
Uh, look, forget
the head shrinking, Doc.

2744
02:21:01,586 --> 02:21:03,213
I can handle this.

2745
02:21:07,592 --> 02:21:09,010
Mr. Charles,

2746
02:21:09,094 --> 02:21:11,763
you're not the first
celebrity junkie I've treated.

2747
02:21:11,805 --> 02:21:12,931
Junkie? What ...

2748
02:21:13,014 --> 02:21:15,058
Nobody cons me at any price.

2749
02:21:15,141 --> 02:21:16,142
I'm not trying to do that.

2750
02:21:16,226 --> 02:21:19,437
If you want me to give that judge
a positive report,

2751
02:21:19,479 --> 02:21:21,481
you will have to earn it.

2752
02:21:24,943 --> 02:21:25,985
Doc?

2753
02:21:26,945 --> 02:21:28,404
Dr. Hacker?

2754
02:21:28,905 --> 02:21:29,948
Doc?

2755
02:22:02,397 --> 02:22:05,233
Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me!

2756
02:22:09,279 --> 02:22:10,947
He ain't there.

2757
02:22:19,330 --> 02:22:21,166
Talk to me, son.

2758
02:22:22,125 --> 02:22:25,670
I ain't no bad dream.
I'm a part of you.

2759
02:22:26,004 --> 02:22:28,506
Even all that dope
couldn't keep me away.

2760
02:22:31,468 --> 02:22:33,428
Mama, I kept my promise.

2761
02:22:33,553 --> 02:22:35,430
You got strong all right.

2762
02:22:35,513 --> 02:22:37,348
Went places I never dreamed of.

2763
02:22:38,057 --> 02:22:40,310
But you still became a cripple.

2764
02:22:46,065 --> 02:22:48,151
Come here, baby. Come here.

2765
02:22:55,742 --> 02:22:56,910
Ray?

2766
02:23:03,416 --> 02:23:05,168
It wasn't your fault.

2767
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:12,050
Now promise us ...

2768
02:23:12,342 --> 02:23:14,052
you'll never let
nobody or nothing ...

2769
02:23:14,135 --> 02:23:16,554
turn you into
no cripple ever again.

2770
02:23:16,721 --> 02:23:19,724
That you'll always stand
on your own two feet.

2771
02:23:20,683 --> 02:23:21,851
Promise.

2772
02:23:42,789 --> 02:23:44,833
Today we're here
to right a wrong ...

2773
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:48,336
that was done to one of our
native sons nearly 20 years ago.

2774
02:23:48,878 --> 02:23:50,338
In 1961,

2775
02:23:50,922 --> 02:23:54,092
Ray Charles was banned from
performing in the state of Georgia ...

2776
02:23:54,175 --> 02:23:57,303
because he refused to play
before a segregated audience.

2777
02:23:57,595 --> 02:24:00,557
Thankfully, we've come
a long way since then.

2778
02:24:00,974 --> 02:24:04,310
Some of us have fought for equality
through the political process,

2779
02:24:04,602 --> 02:24:08,940
but Ray Charles changed American
culture by touching people's hearts.

2780
02:24:09,274 --> 02:24:13,027
So on this day, March 7, 1979,

2781
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:16,740
we, the duly elected representatives
of the State of Georgia ...

2782
02:24:17,073 --> 02:24:21,077
not only proclaim "Georgia on My Mind"
our official state song,

2783
02:24:21,411 --> 02:24:24,622
we also offer Mr. Ray Charles
a public apology ...

2784
02:24:24,664 --> 02:24:26,624
and welcome him back home.
