1
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,959
I used to think

2
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,679
this was the beginning of your story.

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,795
Memory is a strange thing.

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,272
It doesn't work like I thought it did.

5
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,150
We are so bound by time, by its order.

6
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,554
Okay.

7
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,317
Okay. Come back to me.

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,118
Come back to me.

9
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,071
Come back to me.

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,713
Stick 'em up!

11
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,396
Are you the sheriff
in this here town?

12
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,711
These are my tickle guns,
and I'm gonna getcha!

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,358
No!

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,035
You want me to chase you?
You better run!

15
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,514
- Ah!
- Oh!

16
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,669
I remember
moments in the middle.

17
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,717
I love you.

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,953
I hate you!

19
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,951
And this was the end.

20
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,514
Shhh...

21
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,789
Come back to me.

22
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,632
You come back to me.

23
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,479
But now I'm not so sure

24
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,755
I believe in beginnings and endings.

25
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,918
There are days that define
your story beyond your life.

26
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,589
Like the day they arrived.

27
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Good morning.

28
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Morning.

29
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,831
Where is everyone?

30
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,510
Okay. Well, let's get started.

31
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,438
Today we are talking about Portuguese

32
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,511
and why it sounds so different

33
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,949
from the other Romance languages.

34
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,352
The story of Portuguese begins
in the kingdom of Galicia...

35
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,715
- Sorry.
- ...in the Middle Ages,

36
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,349
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

37
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,709
Any news you want to share?

38
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,110
Dr. Banks, can you turn
the TV to a news channel?

39
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,472
...but police have
already set up a blockade

40
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,834
here around the area.

41
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,230
As you can see,
we've got just about as close as we can,

42
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,588
but unfortunately,

43
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,995
Montana right now
is on complete lockdown.

44
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,152
The object apparently
touched down 40 minutes ago,

45
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,071
just north of I-94.

46
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,594
We 're waiting to hear if this is perhaps

47
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,353
an experimental vessel or...

48
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,510
Hold on, it...

49
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,275
I'm learning that more objects
like this have landed in

50
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,595
as many as eight other locations

51
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,671
around the world.

52
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,512
Yes, can we?

53
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,876
This is from a site in Hokkaido.

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,509
This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.

55
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,397
Okay. Um...

56
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,352
I'm sorry. Class is dismissed.

57
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,513
You are an idiot!
You drove right into me!

58
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,072
You just ruined my car!

59
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,913
For now, we're simply
asking for cooperation

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,070
while authorities assess the object.

61
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,355
So, you're saying it's not ours?

62
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,192
Do you even know if it's from Earth?

63
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,656
We 're still collecting information.

64
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,976
We're coordinating with other countries.

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,831
We're not the only ones to

66
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,115
have one of these in our backyard.

67
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,192
If this is
some sort of peaceful first contact,

68
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,833
why send 12?

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,638
Why not just one?

70
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,355
Yeah, I know. I saw that, too.

71
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,316
Uh-huh.

72
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,198
Uh-huh. I don't know, Mom.

73
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,959
I'm watching
the same news coverage you are.

74
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,078
Well, Mom,
please don't bother with that channel.

75
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,034
How many times do I have to tell you?
Those people are idiots.

76
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,550
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

77
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,391
Okay. Exactly. So...

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,149
Um, me? Yeah, um, you know me.

79
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,071
I'm about the same.

80
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
Mom, I'm fine.

81
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,913
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

82
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,513
And around eight
hours after landing,

83
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,480
there are still no signs
of what might be called

84
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,919
"first contact."

85
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,828
Now, the objects measure
at least 1,500 feet tall...

86
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,520
Two are reported
to have penetrated Russian airspace.

87
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,036
One in Siberia, and the other
off the coast of the Black...

88
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,792
...above the ocean.

89
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,275
So far, there are 12 unidentified objects

90
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,713
spread across the globe.

91
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,360
There is no obvious logic
to their locations

92
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,113
and no evidence that
the ships are even occu...

93
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,715
...entertain the idea that
if it is a kind of vessel,

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,189
it may be unmanned.

95
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,317
Regardless, we have
a protocol for scenarios like this.

96
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,029
After Tuesday's
extraordinary events,

97
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,112
the President this morning has
declared a state of emergency,

98
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,997
with as many as 5,000 National Guard

99
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,275
being deployed to
the state of Montana alone.

100
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,874
Borders are closed
and flights have been grounded,

101
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,757
stranding millions of travelers.

102
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,189
Panic buying of gas, water and food

103
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,038
continues to escalate,

104
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,936
and federal authorities
have temporarily lifted

105
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,918
all caps on overtime
for law enforcement.

106
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,873
The ATF has put a temporary ban
on new gun licenses,

107
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,030
forcing many independent suppliers of

108
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,111
hunting equipment and firearms

109
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,117
to close their doors to the public.

110
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,515
Forty-eight hours later
and no further development...

111
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,828
Two days...

112
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,638
...from the site of the 12 UFOs.

113
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,352
...and al ready, the public expects us

114
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,271
to know the answers.

115
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,311
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

116
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,229
We never formally met,

117
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,096
but two years ago,
you did some Farsi translations

118
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,553
for Army Intelligence.

119
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,755
Oh.

120
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,479
You made quick work
of those insurgent videos.

121
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,750
You made quick work
of those insurgents.

122
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,992
You are on the top of everyone's list

123
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,435
when it comes to translations.

124
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,229
And you have another
two years in your SSBI,

125
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,390
so you still have top-secret clearance.

126
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,756
That's why I'm in your office
and not at Berkeley.

127
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,352
Okay.

128
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,108
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

129
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,277
Why are you here?

130
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,960
Can you... Can you understand us?

131
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,839
Where did you come from?

132
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,359
Now you heard it.
What do you make of it?

133
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,272
Is that...

134
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,992
Yes.

135
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,957
How many?

136
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,875
- How many what?
- Um, how many, um, speaking?

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,513
Two.

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,356
Assume they were not speaking
at the same time.

139
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,557
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

140
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,070
How would you approach
translating this?

141
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,071
Do you hear any words? Phrases?

142
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,197
I don't... I don't know.

143
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,998
So what can you tell me?

144
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,275
I can tell you that it's impossible

145
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,316
to translate from an audio file.

146
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,517
I would need to be there,
to interact with them.

147
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,558
You didn't need that
with the Farsi translations.

148
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,438
I didn't need it because
I already knew the language,

149
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,630
but this... This is... Ah...

150
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,869
I know what you're doing.

151
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,878
- Tell me what I'm doing.
- I'm not taking you to Montana.

152
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,056
It's all I can do
to keep it from turning into a tourist site

153
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,376
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

154
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,391
I'm just telling you what it would take

155
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,879
to do this job.

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,399
This is not a negotiation.

157
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,189
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

158
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,917
Good day.

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,797
Colonel?

160
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,953
You mentioned Berkeley.

161
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,355
Are you going to ask Danvers next?

162
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,754
Maybe.

163
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,229
Before you commit to him,

164
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,955
ask him the Sanskrit word
for war and its translation.

165
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,315
An agreement on sharing
scientific discoveries

166
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,032
looks closer tonight,

167
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,714
as Russia and China join talks
at the United Nations.

168
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,270
Meanwhile, financial markets
across the world are in crisis

169
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,510
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell

170
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,192
over 2,000 points...

171
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Morning.

172
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Colonel?

173
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,313
Gavisti.

174
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,311
He says it means "an argument."

175
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,879
What do you say it means?

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,513
A desire for more cows.

177
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,153
Pack your bags.

178
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,717
- All right. Give me 20 minutes?
- Takeoff in ten.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,680
Dr. Banks.
Right this way, please.

180
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,432
Contact and ready to approach...

181
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me make
sure you're properly secured.

182
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,508
You okay?

183
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,553
Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.

184
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,552
"Language is the foundation
of civilization.

185
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,029
"It is the glue
that holds a people together.

186
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,953
"It is the first weapon drawn
in a conflict."

187
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,676
Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

188
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,279
That's quite a greeting.

189
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,277
Yeah, well, you wrote it.

190
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,958
Yeah.

191
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,469
It's the kind of thing
you write as a preface.

192
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,636
Dazzle them with the basics.

193
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,797
Yeah, it's great. Even if it's wrong.

194
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,150
It's wrong?

195
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,549
Well, the cornerstone of civilization
isn't language,

196
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,073
it's science.

197
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,751
Ian is a theoretical physicist
from Los Alamos.

198
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,936
You'll be reporting to me,
but you'll be working with him

199
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,439
when you're in the shell.

200
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,591
That's what they're calling the UFO.

201
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,150
Priority one: what do they want
and where are they from?

202
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,715
And beyond that, how did they get here?

203
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,360
Are they capable of
faster-than-light travel?

204
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,955
I've prepared
a list of questions to go over,

205
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,191
starting with a series of
"handshake" binary sequences...

206
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,838
How about we just talk to them

207
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,269
before we start throwing
math problems at them?

208
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,676
This is why you're both here.

209
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,272
I'll bring the coffee.

210
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,391
Coffee with some aliens.

211
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,953
I want you to take
these two to Dr. Kettler.

212
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,838
Yes, sir.

213
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,478
Follow the captain to medical.

214
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,272
It should take just a few minutes,

215
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,430
and then we'll get started.

216
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,795
We'll take care of your bag.
I'll take your cell phones.

217
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,757
Cell phones!

218
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,791
Follow me.

219
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,633
Put these on. You're gonna
wear them at all times.

220
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,913
Sir, they're here.

221
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,472
Louise Banks?
Ian Donnelly?

222
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,456
When was the last time
either of you have eaten?

223
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,799
- Last night.
- Same.

224
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,736
Last time
you did something stressful?

225
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,478
Does now count?

226
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,319
Just saying...

227
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,153
Uh, who was being carted off
in the medevac?

228
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,750
Not everyone is able to
process experiences like this.

229
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,751
I'm gonna get some blood from you

230
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,398
and give you an immunization dose

231
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,670
that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

232
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,837
Could you sign these, please?
And roll up your sleeves.

233
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,359
Either of you claustrophobic?

234
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,839
- No.
- No.

235
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,434
Currently taking any medications?
Allergies?

236
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,999
Pregnant?

237
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,513
No.

238
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,676
The booster is a kick to your system,

239
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,916
so you may experience
some side effects,

240
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,598
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

241
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,353
a ringing in your ears,
like you have tinnitus.

242
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,431
They wouldn't go, either way.

243
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,711
You see what's happening to him?

244
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
How does this even work?

245
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,416
The readings do not change,

246
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,634
but I don't know,

247
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,950
it's like we're insects
on a piece of paper,

248
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,110
and they're easing us out of the house.

249
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,953
At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,

250
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,316
gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.

251
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,472
Have you found
a scientific explanation for it?

252
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,959
Like, is it for them?

253
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,951
Uh, no. We think it's for us.

254
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,713
Air doesn't seem to circulate
inside the chamber,

255
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,479
so after about two hours,
we run out of oxygen.

256
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,155
It doesn't take 18 hours
to pump fresh air into a room.

257
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,719
Atmosphere...

258
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,913
Excuse me?

259
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,070
If their atmosphere is
different from Earth,

260
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,553
it would certainly take hours

261
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,910
to rebalance their O2 content
and pressure for us

262
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,911
every time they open their door.

263
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,389
So, they could suffocate us
if they wanted.

264
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,312
This is Agent Halpern
with the CIA.

265
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,755
Let me get you two to your stations.

266
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,068
Yes, sir.

267
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,919
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

268
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,752
What do they want?
Where are they from?

269
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,159
Why are they here?

270
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,508
This is the priority.

271
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,511
Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly.

272
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,272
He'll be running this team here.

273
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,430
Have they responded to anything?

274
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,120
Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?

275
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,496
We can't tell what they're saying

276
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,431
when they respond to "hello," so...

277
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,191
Don't get ahead of yourself.

278
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,032
What have you figured out?

279
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,157
We're just getting started.
Good morning!

280
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,152
This is Dr. Louise Banks.
She'll be heading your team.

281
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,673
It's a pleasure meeting you.

282
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
Dr. Banks is
taking over the mission from Dr. Walker.

283
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,349
That's a 15-minute warning.

284
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,391
You scuba-dive before?

285
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,828
What kind of radiation exposure
are we walking into?

286
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,229
Nominal. These are just for safety.

287
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,959
So, is there any physical
contact with the, um...

288
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,759
Am I the only one having
trouble saying "aliens"?

289
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,717
There's a wall. Like, a glass wall.

290
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,472
You can't get to them.

291
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,519
So, what do they look like?

292
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,716
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

293
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,313
The suits are clumsy at first,

294
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,436
but you get used to them.

295
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,791
I'll open a second vehicle.

296
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,237
We'll be there in a few minutes.

297
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,390
Make sure you hold on to something.

298
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,195
Copy, Condor.
We will observe, but not initiate. Over.

299
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,437
Watch your step.

300
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,436
We'll keep
Alpha channel open. Over.

301
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,034
Alpha, be advised.
Humidity increased since yesterday.

302
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,111
Every 18 hours,

303
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,435
the door opens up at the bottom.

304
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,672
That's where we go in.

305
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,152
Zero movement.
Alpha detail, clear to proceed. Over.

306
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,536
Copy, Condor.

307
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,437
Beginning our ascent now. Over.

308
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,870
Ten feet.

309
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,397
Five feet.

310
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,035
Two, one...

311
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,228
Alpha clear to enter antechamber.

312
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,837
Moving into position.

313
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,472
Thirty feet from target.

314
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,357
Suit telemetry now full strength,

315
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,032
despite unknown interference.

316
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,834
Three, two, one.

317
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,959
Oxygen level: 20.3%.

318
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,634
No known contaminates. Over.

319
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,516
Radio signals are decreasing.

320
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,592
90%, 85%...

321
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,190
Yeah, that just happened.

322
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,754
All right, let's move!

323
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,995
Time is wasting.

324
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,189
You ready? You ready?

325
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,719
Let's do it!

326
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,156
Condor, I'm proceeding first
with Captain Marks, over.

327
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,997
Gravity nominal
in the antechamber. Over!

328
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,196
It's all good, sir.

329
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,719
You can proceed.

330
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,553
Stand by! Okay, bring it up.

331
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,438
Vitals are low.

332
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,353
Radio signal strength
stable at 75%. Over.

333
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,877
You okay?

334
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,839
Yeah.

335
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,552
Dr. Banks?

336
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,477
You can do this. Come on.

337
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,318
I don't know. I... I think...

338
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,718
Grab her.

339
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,151
Donnelly, are you all right?

340
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,471
Dr. Donnelly, you good?

341
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,390
Dr. Donnelly,
are you all right?

342
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,436
Please respond. Over.

343
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,158
Yeah.

344
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,151
Holy fuck!

345
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,274
We're gonna go down there,

346
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,119
and you're gonna start your job.

347
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,918
- Okay.
- Okay?

348
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,069
Okay.

349
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,355
Everybody, move out!

350
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,176
Alpha detail is in position.

351
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,758
Team is in position.

352
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,353
We're on the move.

353
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,230
Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.

354
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,995
Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.

355
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,592
So, what happens now?

356
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,038
They arrive.

357
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,358
Dr. Banks?

358
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,470
Dr. Banks?

359
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,312
You can start.

360
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,951
...in airlock.

361
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,679
Do not stop until you have
passed the airlock door.

362
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,751
Do not attempt to remove hazmat suits

363
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,758
without assistance
from authorized personnel.

364
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,319
Repeat: hazmat suits

365
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,312
without assistance
from authorized personnel.

366
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,231
Wait. Just a minute. Just a minute.

367
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Clear.

368
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,720
- All right.
- Step on out, please.

369
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Now hold that.

370
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,598
Am I fired?

371
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,389
You're better than the last guy.

372
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,040
That doesn't
make me feel any better.

373
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,717
You both have till 02:00 hours
to figure something out.

374
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,229
Okay. What happens then?

375
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,992
You go back in.

376
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,030
Violence continues to spread

377
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,953
across the US today in
the wake of the 12 landings.

378
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,314
The president has declared

379
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,072
a mandatory dusk-to-dawn curfew

380
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,515
after the crackdown
by the National Guard failed

381
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,353
to prevent a third night of
looting across the country.

382
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,398
In North Dakota, 144 members of

383
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,198
the Saint Lawrence Pentecostal Cult

384
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,192
are feared dead after they set
their compound ablaze.

385
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,714
Their website claims
the arrival of the aliens

386
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,472
set in motion a prophesy that...

387
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,392
Uh, we're up in 15.
You got any new intel?

388
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,473
Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds.

389
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,198
Where does that get you?

390
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,952
Well, they play audio back at us,

391
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,156
from an unseen source.

392
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,753
Audio of what?

393
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,035
Uh, it's bits of conversation
from the room.

394
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,997
Random clips of dialogue.

395
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,348
Really, we have nothing.

396
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,195
T-minus 14 minutes
to shell access.

397
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,236
T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.

398
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,233
T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.

399
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,312
T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.

400
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,913
What's that for?

401
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,911
A visual aid.

402
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,673
Look, I'm never
gonna be able to speak their words,

403
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,352
if they are talking,

404
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,273
but they might
have some sort of written language

405
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,271
or basis for visual communication.

406
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,749
Okay. Let's get started.

407
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,234
Human.

408
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,593
"Human."

409
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,793
I'm human. What are you?

410
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,752
Human.

411
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,189
Oh my God!

412
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,469
Are you getting this?

413
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,949
Yes, sir!
It's uploading back to base camp.

414
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,711
Louise, that's incredible.

415
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,071
Human.

416
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,199
Human.

417
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,596
Okay, slow down now.

418
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,919
Slow down.

419
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,430
I don't wanna take away
from your success in there,

420
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,988
but Dr. Banks,
is this really the right approach?

421
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,311
Trying to teach them
how to speak and read?

422
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,197
That's gotta take longer.

423
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,590
You're wrong. It's faster.

424
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,599
Everything you do in there,
I have to explain to a room full of men

425
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,511
whose first and last question is...

426
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,636
"How can this be used against us?"

427
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,439
So you're gonna have to
give me more than that.

428
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,478
Kangaroo.

429
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,794
What is that?

430
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,393
In 1770,

431
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,277
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

432
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,634
off the coast of Australia,

433
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,472
and he led a party into the country,

434
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,198
and they met the Aboriginal people.

435
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,759
One of the sailors pointed at

436
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,598
the animals that hop around

437
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,398
and put their babies in their pouch,

438
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,152
and he asked what they were,

439
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,356
and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."

440
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,434
And the point is?

441
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,296
It wasn't till later
that they learned that

442
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,073
"kangaroo" means
"I don't understand." So,

443
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,232
I need this so that we don't
misinterpret things in there.

444
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,880
Otherwise, this is gonna
take 10 times as long.

445
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,034
I can sell that for now.

446
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,480
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary words

447
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,913
before the next session.

448
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,513
Fair.

449
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,989
And remember what happened
to the Aborigines.

450
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,068
A more advanced race
nearly wiped them out.

451
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,873
It's a good story.

452
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,353
Thanks.

453
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,952
It's not true.

454
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,156
But it proves my point.

455
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
We think
we were able to reproduce

456
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,119
some prime number sequences
back at them.

457
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,468
So that's something.

458
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,154
Well, congratulations.
You're a parrot.

459
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,856
It's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard,

460
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,995
don't you see?

461
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,071
They can't seem to follow our algebra,

462
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,036
but complex behaviors, that clicks.

463
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,909
Well that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

464
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,016
Problem is,
not everyone shares our policy

465
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,996
of being open with the aliens.

466
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,071
Have you met General Shang?

467
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,355
The call sign for him is Big Domino.

468
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,668
Whatever Shang does,

469
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,512
at least four other nations will follow.

470
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,750
Louise? We have to gain ground today.

471
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,279
Okay.

472
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,756
- You have a vocabulary list for me?
- I do.

473
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,276
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

474
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,873
Yes, so that we can learn

475
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,598
their names if they have names,

476
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,517
and then introduce pronouns later.

477
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,192
These are all grade-school words:

478
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,589
eat, walk.

479
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,672
Help me understand.

480
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,358
Okay. Um...

481
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,551
Oh, no, no, no! Not the top!

482
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,195
Okay, this is where
you wanna get to, right?

483
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,760
- That is the question.
- Okay.

484
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,035
So, first, we need to make sure that

485
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,230
they understand what a question is.

486
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,108
Okay, the nature of
a request for information

487
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,758
along with a response.

488
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,072
Then, we need to clarify
the difference between

489
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,277
a specific "you" and a collective "you,"

490
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,512
because we don't wanna know
why Joe Alien is here,

491
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,473
we want to know why they all landed.

492
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,990
And purpose requires
an understanding of intent.

493
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,354
We need to find out:

494
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,391
do they make conscious choices?

495
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,596
Or is their motivation so instinctive

496
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,717
that they don't understand
a "why" question at all?

497
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,313
And... And biggest of all,

498
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,595
we need to have enough
vocabulary with them

499
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,438
that we understand their answer.

500
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,598
I get it.

501
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,035
Stick to your list.

502
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,599
Just

503
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,391
don't add anything to it.

504
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,916
...are at 2.97.

505
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,076
Oxygen level: 21.4%. Over.

506
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,760
Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.

507
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,678
Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.

508
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,273
Let's get started.

509
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,272
Louise. Louise. I am Louise.

510
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,756
What is that?

511
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,432
Is that a new symbol? I can't tell.

512
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,233
I don't know.
I think it's the symbol for human again.

513
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,629
It just has a little curl on the end,

514
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,637
maybe to indicate a question.

515
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,432
I don't know.

516
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,709
I don't know, Louise.

517
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,109
I think they're getting confused.

518
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,673
Dr. Banks,

519
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,955
perhaps we should
move on to the next word.

520
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,793
Dr. Banks!

521
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
It's okay.

522
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
What's going on?

523
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,879
Hey! What are you doing?

524
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,228
Yeah, I'm fine.

525
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,958
Are you insane?

526
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,718
They need to see me.

527
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,631
She's taking off her hazmat suit.

528
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Is it okay?

529
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,616
You're risking contamination.

530
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,073
They need to see me.

531
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,633
Dr. Banks...

532
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,875
Dr. Banks.

533
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,269
She's walking
towards the screen.

534
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,718
Should we abort?

535
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,234
Recourse noted.
Stand by for further orders.

536
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,959
Go back to your stations.

537
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,910
Now that's a proper introduction. Hey.

538
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,031
Louise.

539
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,158
I am Louise.

540
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,471
Ian, do you want to introduce yourself?

541
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,433
Uh, yeah.

542
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,436
Louise.

543
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,798
Screw it!

544
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,636
Everybody dies, right?

545
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,836
Sir, Donnelly is
taking off his hazmat suit.

546
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,190
Permission to abort?

547
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,952
Continue the session.

548
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,718
Ian.

549
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,313
Louise.

550
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,432
You...

551
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,358
Who are you?

552
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,358
I think those are their names.

553
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,757
They have names.

554
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,149
So, what are we gonna call them?

555
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,838
I don't know.

556
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,355
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

557
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,752
Yeah.

558
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,592
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like it.

559
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,912
I like it.

560
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,632
Wow!

561
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,269
Team 1, exit your vehicle

562
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,035
and proceed directly ahead
to the decontamination tent.

563
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,716
Leave your respirator on until
you reach the equipment room.

564
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,599
I know. Shhh!

565
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,072
Team 2, exit your vehicles

566
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,630
and continue to
the decontamination tent.

567
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,278
Leave your respirators on

568
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,952
and do not hesitate

569
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,871
until you have reached
the equipment room.

570
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,473
How do you feel?

571
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,317
Overworked.

572
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,391
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you

573
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,959
you're putting yourself at risk.

574
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,516
There's no signs of
radiation poisoning yet.

575
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,319
We'll see how your blood tests look.

576
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,960
For now, I'm gonna
give you another boost.

577
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,439
Okay.

578
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,317
No radiation.

579
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,072
Nothing else we can detect either,

580
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,549
but I'd give them a strong
cocktail, regardless.

581
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,438
It's the first time
we've made significant progress.

582
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,994
All right. We'll take the risk.

583
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,433
Okay, honey...

584
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,896
What is going on there?

585
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,069
Honey...

586
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,355
Just tell me!

587
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,351
You don't need to worry, okay?

588
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,113
- How can I not worry?
- Just calm down.

589
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,713
Just calm down.

590
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,588
Becky asked me
if the monsters are going to kill Daddy!

591
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,274
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

592
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,159
Just stay safe.

593
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,639
You don't need to worry.

594
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,751
Please! I'm so scared!

595
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,791
All junior xenolinguistics

596
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,030
and science personnel must observe

597
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,759
general curfew
unless expressly authorized

598
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,479
for extended work hours by unit COs.

599
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,155
Curfew in effect as of 2200 hours.

600
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,838
Notice to all late workers,
fire watchers and night staff.

601
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,357
Effective immediately,
midnight rations will be served all night.

602
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,590
Here are some of the many things

603
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,711
we don't know about heptapods.

604
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,111
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."

605
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,800
Seven feet. Heptapod.

606
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,832
Who are they?

607
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,753
Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way

608
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,598
is hampered by the fact that,

609
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,598
outside being able to see them
and hear them,

610
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,757
the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.

611
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,029
The chemical composition of
their spaceship is unknown.

612
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,351
The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.

613
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,671
Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,

614
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,354
they do so without detection.

615
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,954
The air between the shells is untroubled

616
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,991
by sonic emission or light wave.

617
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,034
Are they scientists? Or tourists?

618
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,519
If they're scientists,

619
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,909
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

620
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,269
Why did they park where they did?

621
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,870
The world's most decorated
experts can't crack that one.

622
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,552
The most plausible theory is

623
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,119
that they chose places on Earth

624
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,708
with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.

625
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,791
But there are exceptions.

626
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,871
The next most plausible theory is that

627
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,552
Sheena Easton had a hit song

628
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,153
at each of these sites in 1980.

629
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,878
So, we just don't know.

630
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,869
How do they communicate?

631
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,072
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.

632
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,832
The first breakthrough was

633
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
to discover that there's no correlation

634
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,309
between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.

635
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,595
Unlike all written human languages,

636
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,194
their writing is semasiographic.

637
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,750
It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.

638
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,390
Perhaps they view our form of writing

639
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,789
as a wasted opportunity,

640
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,480
passing up a second
communications channel.

641
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,438
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank

642
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,512
for their study of how heptapods write,

643
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,553
because unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.

644
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,471
Like their ship or their bodies,

645
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,915
their written language has no forward

646
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,353
or backward direction.

647
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,319
Linguists call this
non-linear orthography,

648
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,790
which raises the question,
"Is this how they think?"

649
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,751
Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using two hands,

650
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,398
starting from either side.

651
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,631
You would have to know
each word you wanted to use,

652
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,518
as well as how much space
they would occupy.

653
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,796
A heptapod can write
a complex sentence

654
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,996
in two seconds, effortlessly.

655
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,958
It's taken us a month
to make the simplest reply.

656
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,032
Next, expanding vocabulary.

657
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,896
Louise thinks it could
easily take another month

658
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,433
to be ready for that.

659
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,432
Hey...

660
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,112
Oh, hey.

661
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,390
Weber's looki ng for you.

662
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,199
Yeah, well, why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

663
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,273
Come on up!

664
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,793
Thanks.

665
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,755
Nice out here, huh?

666
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,195
Yeah, it's a nice view.

667
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,475
Away from the noise.

668
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,755
You know, I was just thinking about you.

669
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,710
You approach language
like a mathematician.

670
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,951
You know that, right?

671
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,315
I will take that as a compliment.

672
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,873
Yeah, well, it is.

673
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,908
As I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

674
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,070
that I didn't even know existed,

675
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,912
it's like, "What?"

676
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,997
I guess that's why I'm single.

677
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,157
Trust me, you can
understand communication

678
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,918
and still end up single.

679
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,436
I feel like everything
that happens in there

680
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,636
comes down to the two of us.

681
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,671
Yeah, that's a good thing though, right?

682
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,233
You and I?

683
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,036
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

684
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,673
Thank God I've got you!

685
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,188
Tonight,

686
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,198
the first photograph
of the aliens goes viral.

687
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,033
Biological contamination
is a major risk factor

688
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,394
at the Montana site.

689
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,550
So say environmental pressure groups.

690
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,477
800,000 march on Washington

691
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,154
to protest the government's
handling of the crisis.

692
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,038
All this, and more special coverage.

693
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,976
First contact with
whoever it is that is inside that thing,

694
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,319
and who's running the show?

695
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,628
The government.

696
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,711
That's right, folks, the same government

697
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,394
who ruined our healthcare
and bankrupted our military.

698
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,549
Look at these people!

699
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,392
Most of them don't even have guns!

700
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,471
We could be facing a full-scale invasion.

701
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,312
Our president's willing to sit back

702
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,595
and let them waltz in
and take our country.

703
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,910
We are falling asleep
at the wheel, people!

704
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,235
You know what I'm talking
about. I know you do.

705
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,675
What if the smartest thing
we could do right now

706
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,591
would be to give them a show of force?

707
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,671
I'm talking about a shot across the bow.

708
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,760
What do you think?

709
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,319
Caller No.1, you're on the air.

710
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,628
What do you think?

711
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,632
What's this word?

712
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,153
Planet.

713
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,717
That's, like, um...
The Earth is a planet.

714
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,793
Want to see my project
for Miss Garriott's class?

715
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,592
Yeah, little nose.

716
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,313
We had to make up our own TV show.

717
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,391
If we had one.

718
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,000
And who are those two people?

719
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,399
That's you and Dad.

720
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,913
The show is called

721
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,150
"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."

722
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,077
Oh!

723
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,151
Well, it's lovely.

724
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,633
Okay...

725
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,198
Um...

726
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,909
You know it's okay to be sad
that your dad and I...

727
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,513
I know. I'm not.

728
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,750
'Cause we both love you very much.

729
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,434
I know. It's just a cartoon. It's not real.

730
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,112
Louise?

731
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,633
You all right?

732
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,831
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

733
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,032
I'm not sure it's something
I can... I can explain.

734
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,873
When was
your last checkup with Dr. Kettler?

735
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,718
I'm okay.

736
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,115
I'm gonna get some air.

737
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,236
- I'm okay.
- All right.

738
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,998
I'm fine. Yep.

739
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,429
How you feeling?

740
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,192
Um...

741
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,917
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.

742
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,353
Yeah.

743
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,910
You know, I was doing
some reading, um,

744
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,433
about this idea

745
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,876
that if you immerse yourself
into a foreign language,

746
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,554
then you can actually rewire your brain.

747
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,551
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

748
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,591
Mm-hmm.

749
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,318
The theory that, uh...

750
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,391
It... It's the theory that, uh,

751
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,198
the language you speak determines

752
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,679
how you think and...

753
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,228
Yeah. It affects
how you see everything.

754
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,594
It was, uh...

755
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,716
I'm curious...

756
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,308
Are you dreaming in their language?

757
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,157
I may have had a few dreams,
but I don't...

758
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,349
I don't think that that
makes me unfit to do this job.

759
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,829
Did you sleep?

760
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,109
A little.

761
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,473
Do you know Mandarin?

762
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,193
It is shifting.

763
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,390
The voice you're about to hear

764
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,789
belongs to a Chinese military chief...

765
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,196
General Shang.

766
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,799
Pull it up!

767
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,399
We got a satellite feed here
of who he's talking to,

768
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,391
if you want to look.

769
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,993
Wait, go back.

770
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,998
Stop.

771
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,916
He's saying that each of the 12

772
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,956
is offering advanced technology.

773
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,435
Go back again. And play.

774
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,680
Um...

775
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,159
"Our science team
is attempting to decode the sets."

776
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,160
"Sets." I don't know what that means.

777
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,832
Something about advantage,

778
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,753
suits, honor and, uh, flowers.

779
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,398
I don't...

780
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,356
I don't know. That's all.

781
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,829
I don't know what it means either.

782
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,309
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.

783
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,834
And now, Russia's following suit.

784
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,275
Shang's about to start something.

785
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,351
Following suit. Suits.

786
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,033
Suits, honor, flowers...

787
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,873
Colonel, those are
all tile sets in mah-jongg.

788
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,477
God, are they...

789
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,757
Are they using a game
to converse with their heptapods?

790
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,390
Maybe. Why?

791
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,910
Well, let's say that
I taught them chess instead of English.

792
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,036
Every conversation would be a game.

793
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,192
Every idea expressed through
opposition, victory, defeat.

794
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,594
You see the problem?

795
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,398
Hmm...

796
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,710
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

797
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,677
Everything's a nail.

798
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,475
We need to ask the big question.

799
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,318
Ready or not.

800
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,390
Yeah, I know,
but between there and there.

801
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,310
Well, it's time to go.

802
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,677
Okay...

803
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,155
Heptapods' purpose.

804
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,315
Heptapod purpose Earth.
What is your purpose?

805
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,430
Do we only have Costello?

806
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,829
Okay. There you are.

807
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,793
What does it say?

808
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,072
Offer weapon.

809
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,155
You saw what they wrote!

810
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,576
Using a word they don't fully understand.

811
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,192
- Could be a request.
- A warning.

812
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,192
Enough! Louise?

813
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,316
We don't know if they understand

814
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,034
the difference between
a weapon and a tool.

815
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,997
Our language, like our culture, is messy,

816
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,872
and sometimes, one can be both.

817
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,313
And it's quite possible

818
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,670
that they're asking us
to offer them something,

819
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,153
not the other way around.

820
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,350
It's like the first part of a trade.

821
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,317
So, how do we clarify their intentions

822
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,759
beyond those two words?

823
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,840
Well, I go back in.

824
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,837
Right away, we go back in
and we clear this up.

825
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,558
It's more complicated than that.

826
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,029
How is it more complicated than that?

827
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,509
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense

828
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,153
is on the line for you.

829
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,791
We need to sit on this information

830
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,319
till we know what it means,

831
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,271
so we aren't sharing it with our enemies.

832
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,759
We must consider the idea

833
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,936
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves

834
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,394
until only one faction prevails.

835
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,391
- There's no evidence of that.
- Sure there is.

836
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,869
Just grab a history book.

837
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,595
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

838
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,114
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

839
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,595
Yeah. We're a world
with no single leader.

840
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,376
It's impossible to
deal with just one of us.

841
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,755
And with the word "weapon" now...

842
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,515
Halpern. Yes, sir!

843
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,790
No confirmation yet. Standing by.

844
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,839
Anything? What did they say?

845
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,496
China and Russia are off the grid.

846
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,794
They aren't speaking to anyone.

847
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,509
Whatever they learned
in their last session has them spooked.

848
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,599
Yes, sir!

849
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,472
We have orders to do the same.

850
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,709
These are our allies!

851
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,955
You can't shut us down!

852
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,712
- Put us on radio silence.
- Do it.

853
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,389
We received a message
from the hept... Damn it!

854
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,952
We need to be talking to each other!

855
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,753
You want to talk to them?
Find out what this means.

856
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,956
Base-camp talk is now offline.

857
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,355
All interpreters and
international liaisons,

858
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,035
stand down and
report to unit coordinators.

859
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,559
We've never
re-entered a session before.

860
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,234
Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.

861
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,516
We've just gotta step on it, all right?

862
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,556
"Use weapon."

863
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,959
This is the alien message

864
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,310
said to have provoked
the Chinese government

865
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,078
to withdraw their scientists from

866
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,753
the international mission today.

867
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,075
In a statement, General Shang said,

868
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,276
"China no longer trusts the aliens

869
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,719
"who want to divide us.

870
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,473
"Humanity must be protected."

871
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,273
China has asked for immediate
talks at the UN.

872
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,071
Alpha-one-niner,

873
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,673
this is Condor, over.

874
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,796
Alpha-one-niner,
this is Condor, come in. Over.

875
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,312
Captain Marks, Condor
not receiving transmission.

876
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,596
Squelch twice if you hear line.

877
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,352
Captain Marks, all escort units

878
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,277
are ordered to cease all activity.

879
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,149
No, no, no.
Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

880
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,157
I just need to ask one question.

881
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,276
Dr. Banks!
The session is finished.

882
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,590
You can't... You can't go
back in. It's dangerous.

883
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,576
Look, we just need
five minutes. Don't sweat it.

884
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,352
Marks, let them go.

885
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,037
Hey, Abbott!

886
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,112
So, what are we calling this?
Session 37?

887
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,668
Uh, no, 36, part 2.

888
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,632
Why are they on their own?

889
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,029
We've been attempting
to hail Captain Marks.

890
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,872
The escort units are not responding, sir.

891
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,032
Why not? Send security.

892
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,109
"Offer weapon, question mark."

893
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,629
Are you offering us something?

894
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,232
Technology, apparatus, method?

895
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,470
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

896
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,313
This... This segment, it's a lot busier.

897
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,195
Give technology

898
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,192
now.

899
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,676
What's he doing?

900
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,597
Captain, on your ten.

901
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,716
Security detail inbound, sir.

902
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,439
T-minus 4 minutes remaining.
We need to see this through.

903
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,551
Okay, this is it.
Lock and load.

904
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,870
We just need to
hold them off until it's done.

905
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,474
Copy that.
Warning shots and suppressive fire only.

906
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,896
Load up and get to cover.

907
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,070
Stay frosty and we can avoid casualties.

908
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,148
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

909
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,951
Can you even do that?

910
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,957
I don't know.

911
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,671
I can't do it with both hands.

912
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,832
Louise...

913
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,348
What is that?

914
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,479
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

915
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,313
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

916
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,390
How do you feel?

917
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,999
How is Ian?

918
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,275
Same as you. He's okay.

919
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,359
Who, um... Who did this?

920
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,192
Ah, some soldiers.

921
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,510
They've been watching too much TV.

922
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,112
What is that?

923
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,599
Take it easy. Take it easy.

924
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,272
The site's no longer secure.
We're standing by to evacuate.

925
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,271
Where's Ian?

926
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,272
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

927
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,113
He wouldn't leave until
he knew you were okay.

928
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,873
Your whole tent is on the clock

929
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,713
to figure out whatever it is
you were given up there.

930
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,959
This is all of it?

931
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,554
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

932
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,036
Not as far as I can see.

933
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,879
You see something?

934
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,473
Oh, I don't know yet.

935
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,393
I'm gonna need my team to get
together with Louise's team.

936
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,078
I need everybody working on this.

937
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,559
We cannot leave.

938
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,079
Glad to see you're awake.

939
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,913
We need to go back in
and explain this wasn't our fault.

940
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,996
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to.

941
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,389
What happened in there was an attack.

942
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,480
We can hope for the best,

943
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,056
but I have orders to
prepare for retaliation.

944
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,513
We may have to evacuate.

945
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,640
No, that's the wrong move.

946
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,915
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

947
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,111
Well, they're not leaving.

948
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,952
Why does this feel worse?

949
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,636
China is on the offensive.

950
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,392
They're positioning the military

951
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,216
to blow the alien vessel
right out of the sky.

952
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,719
And if this happens,

953
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,456
we can't sit around
waiting for retaliation.

954
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,072
So, get prepared.

955
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,314
The Air Force and infantry
are standing by.

956
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,440
Yes, sir.

957
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,629
Tonight, China becomes
the first world power

958
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,393
to declare war against the aliens.

959
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,074
Following the failure of diplomatic efforts

960
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,673
at the United Nations,

961
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,752
China has confirmed that its
language experts have tonight

962
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,513
delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.

963
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,999
In a televised statement,

964
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,078
General Shang, chairman of
the People's Liberation Army,

965
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,835
said the aliens have 24 hours
to leave Chinese territory

966
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,279
or face destruction.

967
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,510
And he urged all other world leaders

968
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,677
to unite with China
and take a similar stance.

969
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,195
With a huge buildup of forces
at their landing sites,

970
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,039
Pakistan, Russia and Sudan
are thought to be

971
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,678
following China's lead.

972
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,351
It can't be random.

973
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,994
It's going to take us years.

974
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,996
What's this term here?

975
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,991
Mom...

976
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,119
Mom...

977
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,753
Hmm? Sweetie...

978
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,990
Uh, what's this term for that thing,

979
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,991
like a... Like a technical term,

980
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,593
where we make a deal,

981
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,671
and we both get something out of it.

982
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,512
A compromise.

983
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,919
No...

984
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,195
Like, it's a competition.

985
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,872
Mm-hmm...

986
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,558
But both sides end up happy.

987
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,233
Like a win-win.

988
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,470
More science-y than that.

989
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,597
If you want science, call your father.

990
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,279
Thank you.

991
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,752
Sorry.

992
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,114
It's okay.

993
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,077
I'm up.

994
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,553
What time is it?

995
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,878
It's time you opened that
bottle you've been hiding.

996
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,234
You cracked something, didn't you?

997
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,548
Yeah. Come here.

998
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,038
Take a look at this section.

999
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,839
It seems to be talking about time.

1000
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,480
Their symbol for time is everywhere.

1001
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,073
So what is this?

1002
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,677
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

1003
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,830
Who can tell?

1004
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,478
There are too many gaps.

1005
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,073
Nothing's complete.

1006
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,673
Then it dawned on me.

1007
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,239
Come here.

1008
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,038
Right here.

1009
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,954
Stop focusing on the ones.
Look at the zeroes.

1010
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,951
How much of this is data?

1011
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,679
How much of it is negative space?

1012
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,637
So, I measured it.

1013
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,714
0.0833 recurring.

1014
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,114
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.

1015
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,991
One of twelve.

1016
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,230
What they're saying right here
is that this is one of 12.

1017
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,151
"We are part of a larger whole."

1018
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,435
Or we're one of 12 contestants
for the prize.

1019
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,873
Why do I have to talk to him?

1020
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,399
We're all working together.

1021
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,755
We need to talk to the other sites,

1022
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,354
help them with what they've
gotten from the heptapods.

1023
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,634
We're blacked out.

1024
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,915
China just threatened
to destroy their shell.

1025
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,069
We're on our own.

1026
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,976
But this says that all of
the pieces fit together.

1027
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,831
And I'm telling you
that no one else cares.

1028
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,475
Two hours ago,

1029
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,630
we pulled this audio off
a secure channel in Russia.

1030
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,393
Someone on the science team
there was broadcasting wide.

1031
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,508
In their final session, the aliens said,

1032
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,672
"There is no time. Many become one."

1033
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,274
I fear we have all been given weapons.

1034
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,035
If anyone is receiving this, please...

1035
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,599
Well, I mean,

1036
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,119
there are a lot of ways

1037
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,593
you can interpret what he said.

1038
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,720
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

1039
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,870
Russia just executed
one of their own experts

1040
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,154
to keep their secret.

1041
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,754
"Many become one"
could just be their way of saying

1042
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,558
"some assembly required."

1043
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,392
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

1044
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,198
Why not just give it all over?

1045
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,510
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

1046
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,908
Even if I did believe you,

1047
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,719
how in the world are you gonna
get anybody else to play along

1048
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,711
and give up their data?

1049
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,075
We offer ours in return.

1050
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,639
Yeah?

1051
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,119
A trade?

1052
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,713
It's a non-zero-sum game.

1053
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,034
Non-zero-sum game.

1054
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,990
That's it. Yeah.

1055
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,911
Thanks.

1056
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,119
Nine of the landing sites
have gone

1057
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,428
total comms blackout.

1058
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,520
Only way to reach them
is to physically drive there

1059
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,989
and yell at the border guards,
which we're doing,

1060
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,354
but it won't be fast enough.

1061
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,829
There must be a way
to get the message to them.

1062
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,832
To our allies, maybe,
but it's too little too late.

1063
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,434
What we need is to get
all the other nations online

1064
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,431
before one starts global war.

1065
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,476
And there's no way for us to reach them.

1066
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,592
Okay, hold on a second. There is!

1067
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,159
It's right above us.

1068
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,640
That's problematic
for us right now.

1069
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,752
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

1070
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,957
My guess is they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

1071
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,792
Look, they're not our enemy.

1072
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,996
They've made no act of
aggression towards us.

1073
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,200
Maybe this is
their way of being aggressive.

1074
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,719
That's not the question.

1075
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,392
What is the question?

1076
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,710
How do we get you
back in that room

1077
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,438
when it's half a mile straight up?

1078
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,272
I think our work here is done.

1079
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,278
It's in the hands of our superiors now.

1080
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,990
What the hell is she doing?

1081
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,758
Oh, my God! Oh, God, no!

1082
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,272
Costello...

1083
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,717
Where's Abbott?

1084
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,872
I'm sorry.

1085
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,076
We're sorry.

1086
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,029
I need you to...

1087
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,432
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

1088
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,993
I don't...

1089
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,071
I don't understand.

1090
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:18,199
What is your purpose here?

1091
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,160
How can you know the future?

1092
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,195
I don't...

1093
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,753
I don't understand. Who is this child?

1094
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,598
The show is called

1095
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,188
"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."

1096
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:57,030
Wait! No! Wait!

1097
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,712
- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

1098
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,472
Are you all right?

1099
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,436
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1100
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,953
What happened?

1101
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,349
I'm trying to figure it out.
This is too big.

1102
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,908
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

1103
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,194
Why?

1104
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,316
Russia and Sudan are following China.

1105
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,349
I don't understand.

1106
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,669
Help me, Mama.

1107
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,188
Louise? Whoa!

1108
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,475
Mom!

1109
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,799
Mama!

1110
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,196
Sorry, honey.

1111
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,355
What day is it? Do you know, baby?

1112
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,198
Sunday.

1113
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,671
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

1114
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,355
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

1115
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,516
You're gonna see him this weekend.

1116
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,713
He doesn't look at me
the same way anymore.

1117
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,871
It's my fault.

1118
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,031
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

1119
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,552
What?

1120
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,317
Well...

1121
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,709
Believe it or not,

1122
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,473
I know something that's going to happen.

1123
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,233
I can't explain how I know. I just do.

1124
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,077
And when I told your daddy,
he got really mad.

1125
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,400
And he said I made the wrong choice.

1126
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,037
What? What's going to happen?

1127
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,878
It has to do with a really rare disease.

1128
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,995
And it's unstoppable.

1129
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,120
Kind of like you are,

1130
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:55,789
with your swimming and your poetry

1131
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,518
and all the other amazing things

1132
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,352
that you share with the world.

1133
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,998
I'm unstoppable?

1134
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,752
Yeah.

1135
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,631
I got you.

1136
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,477
Louise? Louise?

1137
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,034
I just realized why my husband left me.

1138
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,639
My husband left me.

1139
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,279
You were married?

1140
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,874
Come on! Let's get out of here.

1141
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,673
Mama?

1142
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,199
Yeah?

1143
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,788
Why's my name Hannah?

1144
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,633
Get those people back, please.

1145
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,473
Well, your name is very special,

1146
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,710
because it is a palindrome.

1147
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,509
It reads the same forward and backward.

1148
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,149
All right, guys,
give me a hand here.

1149
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,196
- Yes, sir.
- That goes in the bag.

1150
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,198
Ready to go!

1151
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:03,752
Evacuation underway.

1152
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,194
Hey...

1153
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:12,319
We're done here!
We're taking this with us.

1154
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,917
I can read it.

1155
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,637
- I know what it is.
- What?

1156
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,274
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.

1157
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,271
The weapon is their language.

1158
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,590
They gave it to us.
Do you know what that means?

1159
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,752
So we can learn Heptapod. If we survive.

1160
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,479
If you learn it, when you really learn it,

1161
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,949
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do,

1162
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,077
so you can see what's to come.

1163
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,151
But time, it isn't the same for them.

1164
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,510
It's non-linear.

1165
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,154
Look, we did our best,
but it wasn't enough.

1166
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,833
The captain will load you up.

1167
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,552
You're lifting off in 5 minutes.

1168
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:18,758
Ian, Louise, it was
an honor to work with you.

1169
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,876
Good luck.

1170
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,311
Hey, Colonel...

1171
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,195
I'm gonna find out where we're going.

1172
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,836
Wake up, Mommy!

1173
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,078
Dr. Banks...

1174
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,952
A pleasure.

1175
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,715
General Shang,
the pleasure is mine, really.

1176
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,836
Your president said

1177
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,117
he was honored to host me
at the celebration...

1178
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,872
Yeah.

1179
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,992
...but I confess,
the only reason why I'm here

1180
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:42,709
is to meet you in person.

1181
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,192
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.

1182
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:50,075
18 months ago,

1183
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,714
you did something remarkable,

1184
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,873
something not even
my superior has done.

1185
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,878
And what's that?

1186
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,638
You changed my mind.

1187
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,952
You're the reason for this unification,

1188
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:12,439
all because you reached out to me
at my private number.

1189
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,635
Your private number?

1190
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,069
General, I... I don't know
your private number.

1191
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,072
Now you know.

1192
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,757
I do not claim to know
how your mind works,

1193
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,596
but I believe it was important
for you to see that.

1194
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,118
I called you, didn't I?

1195
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,635
Yes, you did.

1196
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,072
Louise!

1197
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,039
All right,
let's shut down the system.

1198
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,835
Sir? There's a sat line
here dialing China.

1199
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,676
Here? What do you mean "here"?

1200
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:27,070
Come on, come on!

1201
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,151
Whose phone is it?

1202
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:34,798
It's your phone, sir.

1203
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,553
Search base camp now.

1204
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,875
Find out who's using that phone.

1205
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,672
And hold on to those coordinates.

1206
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:48,869
Yes, sir.

1207
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,235
Come on... What do I say?

1208
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,832
What do I say?

1209
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,233
Come on.

1210
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:09,957
I will never forget what you said.

1211
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:24,309
You told me my wife's dying words.

1212
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,896
We found the source
of the phone call.

1213
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,080
It's in the clean room.
We're waiting for instructions.

1214
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,917
What are you doing?

1215
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,076
- What are you doing?
- Changing someone's mind.

1216
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,176
- Can you buy me 20 seconds?
- We don't have time for this.

1217
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,599
No, trust me. Buy me 20 seconds.

1218
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,711
- Do you trust me?
- Okay. Yeah.

1219
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,589
Dr. Banks, drop the phone
now or we shoot!

1220
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,114
Drop it!

1221
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,309
I'm sorry!

1222
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:14,793
You are committing
an act of treason!

1223
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,996
- Yes.
- Drop it!

1224
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,672
It's done. I'm done.

1225
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,868
...blackout from all 12 landing sites

1226
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,439
continues this evening.

1227
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,317
Hold on, we are just hearing...

1228
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,834
I'm being told
we're going to cut this report

1229
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,399
to tell you breaking news...

1230
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,358
...China has called
an emergency press conference...

1231
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,759
General Shang,

1232
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,195
commander in chief of
the People's Liberation Army,

1233
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,430
has announced in
an emergency press conference

1234
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,919
that China is standing down.

1235
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,797
...all intelligence they've received

1236
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,514
will be shared immediately
with the other landing sites.

1237
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:07,637
Scientists from around the world
are sifting through information

1238
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,159
received from the UK, Japan,

1239
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,559
Sierra Leone and Venezuela.

1240
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,591
...the information they have acquired

1241
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,352
from both of their landing sites...

1242
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,635
Also confirming it to be
one of the 12 pieces

1243
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,029
of this puzzle that is
being slowly put together.

1244
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,629
So, Hannah,

1245
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,913
this is where your story begins.

1246
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:19,036
The day they departed.

1247
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,592
You al I rig ht?

1248
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,356
Despite knowing the journey
and where it leads,

1249
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,236
I embrace it.

1250
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:42,516
And I welcome every moment of it.

1251
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,637
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!

1252
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:01,916
H-A-N-N-A-H.

1253
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,394
Now backward. H...

1254
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:21,114
...A-N-N-A-H!

1255
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,599
Hannah!

1256
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,671
You ready, baby?

1257
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,953
Hi!

1258
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,590
Don't worry. See you.

1259
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,713
Daddy!

1260
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,359
You okay?

1261
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,677
Are you ready?

1262
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:58,878
Oh, guess what? Star stuff!

1263
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,869
- Ian?
- Yeah?

1264
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,629
If you could see your whole life
from start to finish,

1265
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,910
would you change things?

1266
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,993
Maybe I'd say
what I feel more often.

1267
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,718
I... I don't know.

1268
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,840
You know, I've had my head
tilted up to the stars

1269
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,512
for as long as I can remember.

1270
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,554
You know what surprised me the most?

1271
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:52,430
It wasn't meeting them.

1272
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:59,435
It was meeting you.

1273
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:43,274
I forgot how good it
felt to be held by you.

1274
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,311
You wanna make a baby?

1275
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,194
Yes. Yeah.
