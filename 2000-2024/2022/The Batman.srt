00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:30,719
Hey!

3
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,415
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

4
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:07,422
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

5
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:09,049
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

6
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,468
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

7
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,388
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

8
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:16,973
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

9
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:20,519
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

10
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:24,648
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

11
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,483
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

12
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:29,319
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

13
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:30,862
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

14
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:35,117
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

15
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,994
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

16
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,454
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

17
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,455
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

18
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,791
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

19
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:43,917
<i>Under my administration,</i>

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,796
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

21
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,383
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

22
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,760
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

23
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:54,803
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

24
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,179
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

25
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:57,222
<i>But listen...</i>

26
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,723
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

27
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,267
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

28
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,772
Hey.

29
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,943
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

30
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,825
Why is she still tied?

31
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:24,416
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

32
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:33,925
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

33
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,886
Just call me in the morning, okay?

34
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:41,516
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,144
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

36
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,897
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

37
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:08,687
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

38
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:24,286
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

39
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:29,124
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

40
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:36,089
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

41
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,092
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

42
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,095
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

43
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:44,848
<i>Watching.</i>

44
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,854
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

45
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:59,029
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

46
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,503
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

47
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,297
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

48
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,882
<i>It's a big city.</i>

49
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:25,222
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

50
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:37,734
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

51
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,658
Look at this guy, man.

52
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:50,831
Boom!

53
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:52,165
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

54
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,754
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

55
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,256
Yo, let's see your hits.

56
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,466
That's you.

57
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:25,866
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

58
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,828
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

59
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:32,706
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

60
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,834
<i>It's a warning.</i>

61
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:38,628
<i>To them.</i>

62
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,556
<i>Fear...</i>

63
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:54,686
<i>is a tool.</i>

64
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,950
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

65
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:23,340
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

66
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,302
Come on!

67
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:37,646
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

68
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:57,999
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

69
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,460
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

70
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:02,003
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

71
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:04,214
Help!

72
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:05,507
Somebody help me!

73
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,301
Help, help!

74
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:16,393
Where you goin', huh?

75
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:22,149
Come on.

76
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,900
Come on, man. Break it.

77
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,487
You can't move, huh?

78
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,573
Now knock his ass out.

79
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:31,366
Showtime. Showtime, man.

80
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:32,993
Come on, man.

81
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:34,327
Come on. Do it, man.

82
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:11,281
You see this guy?

83
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:20,123
The hell are you supposed to be?

84
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,433
I'm vengeance.

85
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,478
Holy shit. It's him.

86
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,296
Hey, man. No, no, no!

87
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,423
Please don't hurt me.

88
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,838
Police action.

90
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:34,091
He's with me, Officer.

91
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:37,928
Are you kidding me, sir?

92
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,597
You're gonna let him in here?

93
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:44,059
Martinez, let him through.

94
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,449
Goddamn freak.

95
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,425
What do we know?

96
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:28,645
Detective?

97
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:30,355
Sorry, Lieutenant.

98
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:35,736
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

99
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:39,656
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

100
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,453
All this blood is from his head?

101
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:45,912
No.

102
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,460
Excuse me.

103
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,630
Most of it's from his hand.

104
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:02,137
Thumb was severed.

105
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:05,974
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

106
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:08,268
He was alive when it was cut off.

107
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:10,979
Ecchymosis...

108
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,774
around the wound.

109
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:30,707
Security detail downstairs

110
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,001
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

111
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:36,713
The mayor was up here alone.

112
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:41,843
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

113
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:50,018
You said there was a card.

114
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:51,686
Yeah.

115
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:04,866
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

116
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,869
Haven't a clue?

117
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:10,330
Let's play a game, just me and you.

118
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,917
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

119
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,337
There's a cipher too.

120
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,971
Any of this mean anything to you?

121
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,724
What's going on here?

122
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,229
I asked him to come, Pete.

123
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:35,981
This is a crime scene.

124
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:38,400
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

125
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,485
I got the press downstairs.

126
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,321
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

127
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,240
But this is way over the line.

128
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,995
Wait.

129
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:51,788
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

130
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:52,998
How do you know?

131
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:56,084
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

132
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:57,919
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

133
00:15:58,003 --> 00:15:59,629
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

134
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,256
He lies still.

135
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:03,759
Excuse me?

136
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:06,386
The riddle.

137
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,390
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

138
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,026
Oh, Jesus.

139
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,074
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

140
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:29,910
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

141
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,329
Excuse me, Commissioner.

142
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,082
They're ready for your statement.

143
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:40,837
I want him outta here.

144
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:42,547
Now!

145
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,347
Come on.

146
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:04,361
Yeah.

147
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:07,030
The kid found him.

148
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,038
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

149
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,640
We really gotta go, man.

150
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:42,941
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

151
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,235
A wife lost a husband.

152
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:47,988
And I lost a friend.

153
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:51,616
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

154
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,786
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

155
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:57,414
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

156
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:01,585
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

157
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:05,756
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

158
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,090
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

159
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:10,010
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

160
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,678
<i>but I don't know.</i>

161
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:20,479
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

162
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:22,647
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

163
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:24,733
<i>And now this.</i>

164
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,487
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

165
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:32,449
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

166
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,828
<i>But I have to try.</i>

167
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,872
<i>Push myself.</i>

168
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,462
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

169
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,340
<i>behind the mask.</i>

170
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,139
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

171
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:41,101
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

172
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,063
<i>everything that happened.</i>

173
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,204
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

174
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:05,167
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

175
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,086
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

176
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,921
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

177
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,673
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

178
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:13,258
<i>still have not been released,</i>

179
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:16,219
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

180
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,556
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

181
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:21,475
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

182
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,102
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

183
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:28,440
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

184
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:30,275
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

185
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:32,319
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

186
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,238
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

187
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:39,159
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

188
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:41,036
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

189
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,789
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

190
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:47,125
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

191
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:51,171
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

192
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:55,425
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

193
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:56,927
I assume you heard about this.

194
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,055
Yeah.

195
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:08,396
Oh, I see.

196
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,149
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

197
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:12,901
Dear God.

198
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,703
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

199
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:34,005
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

200
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:38,969
The killer left this for the Batman?

201
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:42,055
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

202
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:43,140
Apparently.

203
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:45,308
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

204
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:48,687
Why is he writing to you?

205
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,188
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

206
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:51,314
I don't know yet.

207
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:52,941
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

208
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,236
Have a shower.

209
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,364
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

210
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:00,365
are coming for breakfast.

211
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,451
Here? Why?

212
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:03,618
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

213
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:04,786
I haven't got time for this.

214
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,538
It's getting serious, Bruce.

215
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:09,708
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

216
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,376
I don't care about that.

217
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:13,170
Any of that.

218
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:14,755
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

219
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:20,260
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

220
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,512
If I can't change things here,

221
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:24,973
if I can't have an effect,

222
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,684
then I don't care what happens to me.

223
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:28,894
That's what I'm afraid of.

224
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:30,604
Alfred, stop.

225
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,440
You're not my father.

226
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,652
I'm well aware.

227
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:14,231
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

228
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:41,466
Some fresh berries there.

229
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,766
What are you doing?

230
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:53,812
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

231
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:58,108
This is actually quite elusive.

232
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:02,779
Where'd you get those O's?

233
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:07,117
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

234
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,619
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

235
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:13,749
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

236
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:15,208
see where it leads.

237
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:18,128
That's interesting.

238
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:20,505
Mr. Pennyworth?

239
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:21,882
Yes, Dory?

240
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,675
The accountants are here.

241
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,594
See them in, please, Dory.

242
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,724
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

243
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:32,392
What do you mean?

244
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:34,311
What if this is the whole key?

245
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:37,773
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

246
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,900
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

247
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:41,151
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

248
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,361
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

249
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,280
I don't see how that's gonna...

250
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:48,825
Oh.

251
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,299
Damn.

252
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:06,718
Yeah, he's got a car.

253
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:10,013
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

254
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,765
Where to even start?

255
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,684
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

256
00:25:14,768 --> 00:25:15,769
You don't trust me?

257
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,396
You mean like you trust me?

258
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,358
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

259
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,486
There.

260
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:48,885
What are we looking for?

261
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:51,054
A USB port.

262
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:52,264
USB?

263
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:00,522
What?

264
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:08,155
"Thumb" drive.

265
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:10,574
Jesus.

266
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:15,704
It's encrypted.

267
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,417
Try this.

268
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:29,801
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

269
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:41,271
Oh, well, well, well.

270
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:43,940
So much for family values.

271
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:45,275
Who is she?

272
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:46,943
No idea.

273
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:50,697
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

274
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,532
I know who he is.

275
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:53,992
What was that?

276
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:58,580
Shit, shit! The drive.

277
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:01,666
It sent out the photos from my account.

278
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,294
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

279
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:06,463
Jesus.

280
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,924
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

281
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,467
"He lies still."

282
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:11,718
About her?

283
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:14,554
Maybe.

284
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:16,598
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

285
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:20,102
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

286
00:27:20,185 --> 00:27:22,312
Never get in there without a warrant.

287
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:25,732
Yeah.

288
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:40,038
Know who I am?

289
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,625
Yeah. I got an idea.

290
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:45,502
I want to see the Penguin.

291
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:48,463
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

292
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:54,845
What's the problem?

293
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,346
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

294
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,598
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

295
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:00,308
That's what I tried to tell him.

296
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:02,686
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

297
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,646
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

298
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:07,107
Mine or yours?

299
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:16,408
Get him!

300
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,659
I saw that whole thing.

301
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:18,952
He's over there!

302
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:20,370
What is your problem?

303
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,207
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

304
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,219
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:19,471
Take it easy, sweetheart.

306
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,348
You looking for me?

307
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,975
I see you met the twins.

308
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:28,230
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

309
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:30,607
I guess we both are.

310
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:34,069
How you doing?

311
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:36,113
I'm Oz.

312
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,911
Who is she?

313
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:47,874
I really don't know, chief.

314
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,794
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

315
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:52,254
but I wasn't rolling with them.

316
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:06,685
It's okay, baby.

317
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:11,022
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

318
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:37,966
Thank you, honey.

319
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:46,308
Here you go, champ.

320
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:49,936
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

321
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,813
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

322
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:53,690
Is that the mayor?

323
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:55,567
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

324
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:58,070
Don't make me hurt you.

325
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:02,324
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

326
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:05,368
Yeah, I do. Do you?

327
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,622
Look...

328
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:12,667
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

329
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:17,798
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

330
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:27,724
Tell you one thing.

331
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:33,480
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

332
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,483
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

333
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,571
What? Too soon?

334
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:53,792
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

335
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:04,094
Taxi!

336
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:07,597
Taxi!

337
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,659
Hey, it's me.

338
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:30,287
Baby, what's wrong?

339
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:32,956
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

340
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,835
On the news?

341
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:40,797
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

342
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,591
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

343
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,387
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

344
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,724
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

345
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:52,809
Uh...

346
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,354
God damn it.

347
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,335
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

348
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:20,295
<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

349
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:23,215
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

350
00:33:56,665 --> 00:33:59,584
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

351
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:15,429
You're pretty good at that.

352
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,171
Hey! Give me that.

353
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:55,343
"Kosolov, Annika."

354
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:58,930
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

355
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:01,767
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

356
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:42,474
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

357
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:45,018
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

358
00:37:45,102 --> 00:37:46,478
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

359
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:48,313
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

360
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,773
What does she know?

361
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:51,983
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

362
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,652
She did seem upset.

363
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:56,947
Back at your place.

364
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,492
Let's go talk to her.

365
00:38:26,685 --> 00:38:27,769
Anni!

366
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:30,147
Baby!

367
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:32,816
Anni!

368
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:38,113
Anni!

369
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:41,950
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

370
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,244
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

371
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:46,204
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

372
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:51,668
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

373
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:54,045
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

374
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:56,965
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

375
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,594
Shit, they took my phone.

376
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:02,053
<i>His victim, longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,</i>

377
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,555
<i>Commissioner Pete Savage,</i>

378
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,766
<i>was found dead earlier tonight</i>

379
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:09,060
<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>

380
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:12,481
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

381
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:15,442
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

382
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,241
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

383
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:25,285
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

384
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:28,413
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

385
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:33,293
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

386
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,420
<i>But I am not done.</i>

387
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,759
<i>Here is another...</i>

388
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:48,058
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

389
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:53,605
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

390
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:55,524
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

391
00:39:55,607 --> 00:40:00,612
<i>when the truth about our city
will finally...</i>

392
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:03,407
<i>be unmasked.</i>

393
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:06,743
<i>Goodbye!</i>

394
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:12,624
<i>Commissioner Savage
served a distinguished</i>

395
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:14,835
<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

396
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:17,129
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

397
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:19,506
At the club.

398
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:22,592
The Iceberg Lounge?

399
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:24,803
44 Below.

400
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:27,722
What is that?

401
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,519
The club within the club.

402
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:35,522
The real club.

403
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:39,568
It's a mob hangout.

404
00:40:40,026 --> 00:40:41,445
Is that where you work?

405
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:44,197
Selina?

406
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:51,955
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

407
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,960
But I see 'em come in.

408
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:58,253
Who?

409
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:01,256
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

410
00:41:02,841 --> 00:41:05,510
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

411
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:09,306
You're gonna help me on this.

412
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,433
For your friend.

413
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:23,361
You got a lot of cats.

414
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:26,782
I have a thing about strays.

415
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,245
You're not safe here.

416
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:34,539
I can take care of myself.

417
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:37,417
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

418
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,044
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

419
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:42,380
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

420
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,300
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

421
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,488
He waited for him at the gym.

422
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:09,658
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

423
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,868
when no one else was around.

424
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:14,413
There's a needle mark on his neck.

425
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:16,456
Injected him with arsenic.

426
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:19,793
Rat poison.

427
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:22,170
Yeah.

428
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:24,798
That seems to be his theme here.

429
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,716
Look at this thing.

430
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,601
It's a maze.

431
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:42,482
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

432
00:42:45,235 --> 00:42:46,319
More symbols.

433
00:42:48,822 --> 00:42:50,407
It's another cipher.

434
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,243
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

435
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,496
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

436
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,708
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

437
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:02,627
I don't get it.

438
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:05,088
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

439
00:43:06,006 --> 00:43:08,008
Looks like he got greedy.

440
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:09,134
You kidding me?

441
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:11,928
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

442
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:15,265
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

443
00:43:15,348 --> 00:43:17,559
Maybe he's not who you thought.

444
00:43:19,102 --> 00:43:21,146
You make it sound like he had it coming.

445
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:24,858
He was a cop.

446
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:27,486
Crossed a line.

447
00:43:58,725 --> 00:44:00,393
"I'm mad about you.

448
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:04,147
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

449
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:14,366
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

450
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:18,120
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

451
00:44:18,203 --> 00:44:19,913
The hell is that?

452
00:44:20,664 --> 00:44:23,834
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

453
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,461
I don't know.

454
00:44:27,337 --> 00:44:28,505
Lieutenant.

455
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:30,006
They're coming back.

456
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,341
We got to get out of here.

457
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:36,638
Come on.

458
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:42,769
Ow!

459
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:45,564
I don't know about these things.

460
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:49,109
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

461
00:44:53,113 --> 00:44:55,699
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

462
00:44:57,576 --> 00:44:59,035
I'm just looking for Annika.

463
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:04,958
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

464
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:08,712
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

465
00:45:18,263 --> 00:45:19,473
Look at me.

466
00:45:29,107 --> 00:45:31,276
Looks good. Here.

467
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:16,446
I got you. Can you hear me?

468
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:18,407
Yeah.

469
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:28,083
Hey, where you goin'?

470
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,835
Hospitality.

471
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:33,422
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

472
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:36,716
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

473
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,475
"Kenzie, William."

474
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,018
He's an off-duty cop.

475
00:46:48,895 --> 00:46:50,564
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

476
00:46:50,897 --> 00:46:52,941
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

477
00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:12,627
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

478
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:13,837
Great.

479
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:23,388
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

480
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:25,056
Feels good, doesn't it?

481
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,350
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

482
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:35,025
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

483
00:47:35,108 --> 00:47:36,151
Really?

484
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:37,194
'Cause when I first saw you,

485
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:38,487
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

486
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,822
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

487
00:47:41,448 --> 00:47:43,200
Can we not do this right now?

488
00:47:45,118 --> 00:47:46,661
Wait. Who was that?

489
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:47,913
Oh, I saw him.

490
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:49,081
<i>Look back.</i>

491
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:50,957
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

492
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,375
I need to see his face.

493
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:55,504
Jesus.

494
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:04,679
That's the DA.

495
00:48:04,763 --> 00:48:05,806
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

496
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:07,557
And he's coming over. You happy?

497
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:08,850
<i>Talk to him.</i>

498
00:48:11,978 --> 00:48:13,063
Hey. How you doing?

499
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:14,231
Hi.

500
00:48:14,314 --> 00:48:15,148
I'm Gil.

501
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:17,984
Hey, aren't you the DA?

502
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:19,027
Yeah.

503
00:48:19,236 --> 00:48:21,405
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

504
00:48:21,488 --> 00:48:22,864
Is that right?

505
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:25,492
I haven't seen you around here before.

506
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:28,537
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

507
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,164
'cause people are all a little on edge.

508
00:48:31,248 --> 00:48:32,749
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

509
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:33,834
<i>Is that right?</i>

510
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:35,335
<i>I like that.</i>

511
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,753
Do you want to come over?

512
00:48:36,837 --> 00:48:37,963
Sure.

513
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:42,300
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

514
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:43,802
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

515
00:48:44,094 --> 00:48:45,971
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

516
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:48,932
That's half the DA's office.

517
00:48:49,015 --> 00:48:50,183
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

518
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:51,226
Hi.

519
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:53,353
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

520
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:55,313
Drowning our sorrows.

521
00:48:55,647 --> 00:48:56,940
<i>You want a drop?</i>

522
00:48:57,023 --> 00:48:59,067
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

523
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:02,696
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

524
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:04,823
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

525
00:49:05,282 --> 00:49:06,241
He's wasted.

526
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:07,367
No shit.

527
00:49:09,035 --> 00:49:10,036
<i>I like this girl.</i>

528
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:12,080
Oh, hey, I like you too!

529
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:18,962
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

530
00:49:19,045 --> 00:49:20,130
<i>He knows so much.</i>

531
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,506
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

532
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,842
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

533
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:24,843
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

534
00:49:24,926 --> 00:49:26,845
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

535
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:28,889
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

536
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:32,726
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

537
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,279
<i>I mean...</i>

538
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:48,700
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

539
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,703
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

540
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:53,497
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

541
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,165
He's talking about the Maroni case.

542
00:49:55,248 --> 00:49:58,543
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

543
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:01,421
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

544
00:50:01,505 --> 00:50:03,423
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

545
00:50:03,507 --> 00:50:06,134
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

546
00:50:06,218 --> 00:50:07,469
What do you know about that?

547
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:10,263
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

548
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:11,306
<i>I want a drink.</i>

549
00:50:11,473 --> 00:50:12,724
Keep him talking.

550
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:16,895
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

551
00:50:16,978 --> 00:50:18,021
She knows Annika.

552
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:19,523
No, stay on the DA.

553
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:21,525
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

554
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:25,779
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

555
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:26,905
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

556
00:50:26,988 --> 00:50:29,533
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

557
00:50:29,616 --> 00:50:30,867
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

558
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:33,412
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

559
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:36,415
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

560
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:37,999
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

561
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:39,167
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

562
00:50:43,922 --> 00:50:44,965
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:46,633
Hey.

564
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,971
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

565
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:53,473
How you been?

566
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:57,519
Yeah, I've been okay.

567
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:00,230
<i>I was just...</i>

568
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:04,109
I was just headed back upstairs.

569
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,861
Well...

570
00:51:06,945 --> 00:51:08,613
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

571
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:25,088
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

572
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:26,757
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

573
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,633
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

574
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:30,552
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

575
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:31,720
Wait, what are you doing?

576
00:51:31,803 --> 00:51:34,222
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

577
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:39,811
Taxi!

578
00:51:43,774 --> 00:51:44,775
Hey!

579
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:47,569
I lost you in there.

580
00:51:47,652 --> 00:51:48,737
Yeah, I gotta go.

581
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:51,031
Oh, you need a ride?

582
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,033
That's me right there.

583
00:51:59,122 --> 00:52:00,207
Taxi!

584
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,416
I'm good.

585
00:52:03,126 --> 00:52:04,544
I hope, uh...

586
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:10,550
I'll see you around.

587
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,016
Just hold still.

588
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:40,283
What do you know about

589
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:42,661
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

590
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:47,457
Yeah, sure, there was.

591
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:50,001
That's the rat we're looking for.

592
00:54:50,919 --> 00:54:52,796
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

593
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,383
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

594
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:57,926
Where are you getting this?

595
00:54:58,009 --> 00:55:00,887
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

596
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,140
Gil's very nervous.

597
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,643
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

598
00:55:06,726 --> 00:55:08,603
I worked that case.

599
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:10,647
Riddler's not after you.

600
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,648
How do you know?

601
00:55:12,023 --> 00:55:13,442
You're not corrupt.

602
00:55:14,484 --> 00:55:16,027
Colson's dirty?

603
00:55:21,908 --> 00:55:23,410
Maybe I, uh...

604
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:27,414
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

605
00:55:27,497 --> 00:55:30,792
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

606
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,336
Who knows how many people it touches.

607
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,631
Politicians. Police. The courts.

608
00:55:37,924 --> 00:55:39,634
It could tear the whole city apart.

609
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,095
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

610
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:45,474
And Riddler's the match.

611
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:47,517
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

612
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:48,894
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

613
00:55:48,977 --> 00:55:50,395
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

614
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:51,980
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

615
00:55:53,023 --> 00:55:54,608
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

616
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:56,359
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

617
00:55:57,486 --> 00:55:58,945
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

618
00:55:59,029 --> 00:56:00,072
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

619
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:01,782
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

620
00:56:01,865 --> 00:56:03,700
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

621
00:56:03,784 --> 00:56:05,035
Pretty.

622
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:08,413
She a new friend of yours?

623
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:14,211
I'm not so sure.

624
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:16,546
Looks like you upset her.

625
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:19,841
Shall I take this as a good sign?

626
00:56:19,925 --> 00:56:20,926
What?

627
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:21,927
Your attire.

628
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,137
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

629
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:26,223
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

630
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:28,975
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

631
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:31,603
Riddler might not be able to resist.

632
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,146
Oh, that reminds me.

633
00:56:34,314 --> 00:56:38,276
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

634
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,320
The one from the rat maze.

635
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:43,824
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

636
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:46,034
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

637
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:49,371
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

638
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:51,415
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

639
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:52,707
"Rat with wings"?

640
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:55,293
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

641
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:56,628
Yeah.

642
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:59,214
A stool pigeon.

643
00:56:59,464 --> 00:57:01,091
Where are your cufflinks?

644
00:57:01,174 --> 00:57:02,134
I couldn't find them.

645
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:05,554
Well, you can't go out like that.

646
00:57:05,637 --> 00:57:07,431
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

647
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:14,396
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

648
00:57:16,106 --> 00:57:18,316
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

649
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:21,111
Your father gave them to me.

650
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:29,995
No more lies! No more lies!

651
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,141
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

652
00:58:03,695 --> 00:58:05,447
Is that Bruce Wayne?

653
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,158
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

654
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,251
Hold it.

655
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:20,837
You good, fellas?

656
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:22,422
Good.

657
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:25,634
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

658
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:44,444
Sir?

659
00:59:04,131 --> 00:59:05,090
Hey!

660
00:59:05,173 --> 00:59:07,175
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

661
00:59:08,135 --> 00:59:09,970
Hey, watch it, fellas.

662
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,722
You got the prince of the city there.

663
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:17,394
Some event, huh?

664
00:59:17,477 --> 00:59:20,439
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

665
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:22,983
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

666
00:59:23,066 --> 00:59:24,693
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

667
00:59:24,776 --> 00:59:26,778
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

668
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:29,072
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

669
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:31,158
Wow. Is that right?

670
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:33,285
His father saved my life.

671
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:37,456
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

672
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:42,169
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

673
00:59:42,461 --> 00:59:45,672
Operated right on the dining room table.

674
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:51,011
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

675
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:54,431
I remember your face.

676
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:58,393
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

677
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,896
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

678
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,815
"Hippocratic oath."

679
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:07,569
That's good.

680
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:09,279
Excuse me.

681
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:13,700
Yes.

682
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:28,965
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

683
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:30,634
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

684
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:33,095
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

685
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:34,971
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

686
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:36,473
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

687
01:00:36,556 --> 01:00:37,974
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

688
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:39,476
<i>consider a donation to</i>

689
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:41,603
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

690
01:00:41,686 --> 01:00:43,939
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

691
01:00:44,022 --> 01:00:45,232
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

692
01:00:45,607 --> 01:00:48,151
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

693
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:52,989
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

694
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:56,284
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

695
01:00:57,285 --> 01:00:59,162
He got what he deserved.

696
01:01:01,081 --> 01:01:02,082
Know what I mean?

697
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,502
Hey, don't I know you?

698
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:06,670
Bruce Wayne.

699
01:01:07,587 --> 01:01:09,548
Why haven't you called me back?

700
01:01:09,631 --> 01:01:10,632
I'm sorry?

701
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:13,260
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

702
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,553
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

703
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:17,305
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

704
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:18,723
Will you walk with me?

705
01:01:23,895 --> 01:01:25,230
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:26,523
Mr. Wayne.

707
01:01:27,232 --> 01:01:30,318
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

708
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:32,738
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

709
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:35,240
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

710
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:37,784
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

711
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:39,661
Thank you.

712
01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:41,538
My God.

713
01:01:43,373 --> 01:01:45,876
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

714
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:47,586
I want to continue this.

715
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:52,674
Excuse me.

716
01:01:54,718 --> 01:01:56,595
I'm so sorry for your loss.

717
01:01:58,805 --> 01:01:59,723
Thank you.

718
01:01:59,806 --> 01:02:01,558
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

719
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:04,770
Gil Colson is missing.

720
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:06,146
What?

721
01:02:06,229 --> 01:02:08,523
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

722
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:09,649
Christ, not again.

723
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:11,818
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

724
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:16,156
You got people looking for him, Jim?

725
01:02:16,823 --> 01:02:19,117
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

726
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:20,118
What'd his wife say?

727
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:21,411
She hadn't heard from him.

728
01:03:16,174 --> 01:03:17,092
Get out of the car!

729
01:03:17,843 --> 01:03:20,053
Get out of the car and show your hands!

730
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:22,681
Get out!

731
01:03:33,191 --> 01:03:34,484
Get 'em up!

732
01:03:34,568 --> 01:03:36,319
Get out! Show 'em!

733
01:03:40,782 --> 01:03:42,367
Christ, it's Colson.

734
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,161
There's a bomb around his neck!

735
01:03:59,217 --> 01:04:00,761
Let's clear this place out now!

736
01:04:00,844 --> 01:04:02,471
We've got to get this place cleared out!

737
01:04:36,713 --> 01:04:39,466
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

738
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:43,887
We don't know if he's in on it.

739
01:04:47,015 --> 01:04:48,350
What's he looking at?

740
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,453
Holy shit.

741
01:05:09,496 --> 01:05:11,164
Are you kidding me?

742
01:05:11,248 --> 01:05:14,000
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

743
01:05:14,835 --> 01:05:17,295
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

744
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:34,271
Please.

745
01:05:34,438 --> 01:05:37,190
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

746
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:39,818
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

747
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:40,902
I'm so sorry.

748
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:43,071
Looks like a combination lock.

749
01:05:43,155 --> 01:05:44,614
Can't we just cut it off?

750
01:05:45,365 --> 01:05:47,033
Not if you want to keep your head.

751
01:06:23,737 --> 01:06:24,988
<i>You came.</i>

752
01:06:26,823 --> 01:06:27,908
Who are you?

753
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,451
<i>Me?</i>

754
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,455
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

755
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:37,334
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

756
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:41,713
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

757
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:43,340
"Unmask"?

758
01:06:43,423 --> 01:06:44,591
<i>Yes.</i>

759
01:06:45,425 --> 01:06:48,261
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

760
01:06:48,345 --> 01:06:50,764
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

761
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:53,767
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

762
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,644
How am I a part of this?

763
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:57,646
<i>You'll see.</i>

764
01:06:57,729 --> 01:06:59,481
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

765
01:06:59,564 --> 01:07:01,650
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

766
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:02,984
<i>We're live.</i>

767
01:07:03,068 --> 01:07:06,071
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

768
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,448
<i>At the moment,</i>

769
01:07:08,532 --> 01:07:11,910
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

770
01:07:11,993 --> 01:07:13,036
<i>is dead.</i>

771
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,122
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

772
01:07:15,205 --> 01:07:16,164
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

773
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:19,376
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

774
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:22,462
<i>You hear me?</i>

775
01:07:22,546 --> 01:07:23,547
Okay.

776
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:34,391
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

777
01:07:36,143 --> 01:07:38,311
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

778
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:41,398
<i>Now,</i>

779
01:07:42,399 --> 01:07:45,193
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

780
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:48,864
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

781
01:07:49,448 --> 01:07:51,867
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

782
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,287
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

783
01:07:55,370 --> 01:08:00,584
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

784
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:02,919
You want me to do puzzles?

785
01:08:03,003 --> 01:08:05,756
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

786
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,926
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

787
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,345
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

788
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:14,598
Okay, okay. So I just...

789
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:15,766
You want me to...

790
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,226
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

791
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:21,938
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

792
01:08:22,022 --> 01:08:26,693
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

793
01:08:26,777 --> 01:08:29,196
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

794
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,363
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

795
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:31,865
- "Justice."
- Huh?

796
01:08:31,948 --> 01:08:32,991
The answer's "justice."

797
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,284
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

798
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:35,952
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

799
01:08:36,036 --> 01:08:40,373
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

800
01:08:40,457 --> 01:08:42,834
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

801
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,295
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

802
01:08:45,378 --> 01:08:46,588
Of course, of course. Of course.

803
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:49,049
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

804
01:08:49,132 --> 01:08:53,261
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

805
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:57,516
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

806
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:59,392
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

807
01:08:59,476 --> 01:09:00,727
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

808
01:09:00,811 --> 01:09:02,979
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

809
01:09:04,397 --> 01:09:05,524
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

810
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:06,858
- How much?
- Nothing!

811
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,152
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

812
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:11,530
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

813
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:12,447
What cases?

814
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:13,657
He didn't ask me that!

815
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:14,741
Come on! Ten grand.

816
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,161
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

817
01:09:18,245 --> 01:09:20,872
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

818
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:24,793
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

819
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:27,295
<i>Last riddle.</i>

820
01:09:27,379 --> 01:09:31,716
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

821
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,096
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

822
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:38,265
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

823
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:40,892
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

824
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,769
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

825
01:09:42,853 --> 01:09:44,062
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

826
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,814
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

827
01:09:45,897 --> 01:09:47,858
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

828
01:09:47,941 --> 01:09:49,484
If I go out this way, it's just me.

829
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:52,696
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

830
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:54,239
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

831
01:09:54,322 --> 01:09:55,657
- People are watching.
- What people?

832
01:09:55,741 --> 01:09:57,868
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

833
01:09:57,951 --> 01:10:00,120
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

834
01:10:00,203 --> 01:10:01,079
<i>Four!</i>

835
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:02,539
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

836
01:10:02,622 --> 01:10:04,499
<i>Goodbye!</i>

837
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:36,073
Who do you think he is under there?

838
01:10:36,156 --> 01:10:36,990
Take it easy.

839
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:38,075
I want to see.

840
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:40,619
What is that thing? Leather?

841
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:45,832
What's he got on his eyes?

842
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,375
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

843
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:48,668
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

844
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:49,920
Hey!

845
01:10:50,504 --> 01:10:53,632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

846
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:55,383
Relax, God damn it!

847
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:56,968
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

848
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,931
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

849
01:11:01,014 --> 01:11:03,433
Colson's blood is on his hands.

850
01:11:03,517 --> 01:11:04,935
Maybe it's on yours.

851
01:11:06,394 --> 01:11:07,437
What'd you say?

852
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:09,106
He would rather die than talk.

853
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:11,191
What was he afraid of?

854
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:13,026
You?

855
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:21,576
You son of a bitch.

856
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,163
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

857
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,957
You could be an accessory to murder.

858
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,041
Why are we playing games...

859
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:31,044
Get him! Come on!

860
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:33,130
Back off! Back off!

861
01:11:33,213 --> 01:11:35,507
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

862
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,676
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

863
01:11:37,759 --> 01:11:40,554
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

864
01:11:43,223 --> 01:11:44,766
You too now?

865
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,394
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

866
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:50,063
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

867
01:11:50,147 --> 01:11:52,399
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

868
01:11:55,193 --> 01:11:56,695
Okay, give him the room.

869
01:12:12,335 --> 01:12:13,628
Two minutes.

870
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:26,975
You listen to me.

871
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,562
We gotta get you out of here.

872
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,191
That would put a lot of heat on you.

873
01:12:34,274 --> 01:12:35,942
Well, you punched me in the face.

874
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:39,488
Take this key.

875
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:44,159
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

876
01:12:45,202 --> 01:12:46,912
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

877
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:50,207
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

878
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:55,962
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

879
01:12:59,382 --> 01:13:02,094
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

880
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:05,097
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

881
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,642
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

882
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,313
Or he moonlights as a cop.

883
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:19,403
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

884
01:13:19,486 --> 01:13:20,987
Somebody stop him!

885
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:00,736
- There he is!
- Freeze!

886
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,034
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

887
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:50,786
I did.

888
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:54,247
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

889
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:56,374
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

890
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,584
I only trust you.

891
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,003
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

892
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:03,465
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

893
01:15:04,216 --> 01:15:05,342
You think Penguin's the rat?

894
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:08,470
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

895
01:15:08,553 --> 01:15:10,514
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

896
01:15:10,597 --> 01:15:11,932
DA was a regular too.

897
01:15:12,015 --> 01:15:15,519
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

898
01:15:16,603 --> 01:15:17,813
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

899
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:18,855
The what?

900
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,398
Riddler's latest.

901
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,192
The cipher in the maze.

902
01:15:22,275 --> 01:15:24,778
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

903
01:15:26,363 --> 01:15:27,989
A penguin's got wings too.

904
01:15:29,991 --> 01:15:31,952
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

905
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:33,703
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

906
01:15:33,787 --> 01:15:36,998
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

907
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:40,252
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

908
01:15:42,879 --> 01:15:44,714
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

909
01:15:45,882 --> 01:15:46,967
There's Penguin.

910
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,927
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

911
01:15:50,554 --> 01:15:51,805
<i>You want to move in?</i>

912
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:55,142
<i>Let's follow.</i>

913
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:17,205
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

914
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:18,582
<i>I'm here.</i>

915
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,668
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

916
01:16:21,752 --> 01:16:24,254
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

917
01:16:43,482 --> 01:16:46,026
It's a drug lab. Drops.

918
01:16:46,109 --> 01:16:47,319
This is a buy.

919
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,572
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

920
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:51,823
Or they never shut it down at all.

921
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:52,783
<i>What are you saying?</i>

922
01:16:52,866 --> 01:16:55,994
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

923
01:17:20,352 --> 01:17:21,770
This just got complicated.

924
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:23,688
What do you mean?

925
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,071
Hey! What happened?

926
01:17:31,154 --> 01:17:32,489
You all right?

927
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:45,001
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

928
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,753
Jesus.

929
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:49,339
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

930
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,174
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

931
01:17:51,258 --> 01:17:52,968
Is that why you work in the club?

932
01:17:53,718 --> 01:17:54,761
It was all just a score?

933
01:17:54,845 --> 01:17:58,640
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

934
01:18:00,016 --> 01:18:01,935
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

935
01:18:13,238 --> 01:18:14,197
Jesus!

936
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:43,935
Hey, Vengeance!

937
01:18:46,104 --> 01:18:48,815
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

938
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,316
Kenzie! Get the money!

939
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:37,989
Hey! What the...

940
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:29,958
Whoa!

941
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:34,755
Come on! Come on!

942
01:20:37,924 --> 01:20:39,259
This guy's crazy!

943
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:42,721
Come on! Hey!

944
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:33,188
Move!

945
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:39,880
Get out of the way!

946
01:22:51,016 --> 01:22:52,100
Come on!

947
01:23:00,817 --> 01:23:01,943
Get out of the way!

948
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:41,233
I got you!

949
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:43,819
I got you!

950
01:23:43,902 --> 01:23:46,238
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

951
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:47,781
I got you!

952
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:07,069
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

953
01:25:07,152 --> 01:25:09,780
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

954
01:25:09,863 --> 01:25:11,156
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

955
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,657
Cops caught you doing something.

956
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:14,367
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

957
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:16,328
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

958
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,538
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

959
01:25:18,622 --> 01:25:19,831
His drops operation.

960
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:22,375
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

961
01:25:22,459 --> 01:25:26,088
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

962
01:25:26,171 --> 01:25:27,923
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

963
01:25:28,006 --> 01:25:30,342
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

964
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:33,637
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

965
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,888
What are you, crazy?

966
01:25:34,971 --> 01:25:36,056
That why you killed the girl?

967
01:25:36,139 --> 01:25:37,099
I didn't kill no girl!

968
01:25:37,182 --> 01:25:38,975
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

969
01:25:39,059 --> 01:25:40,352
But she got too close, right?

970
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,646
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

971
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:44,689
But somehow Riddler found out too.

972
01:25:44,773 --> 01:25:46,691
He knows so much about you.

973
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:48,819
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

974
01:25:49,403 --> 01:25:51,613
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

975
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:53,198
Why don't you start harmonizing?

976
01:25:53,532 --> 01:25:56,201
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

977
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:57,619
I ain't no rat!

978
01:25:57,702 --> 01:25:59,538
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

979
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:00,705
if he heard this kind of talk?

980
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:02,958
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

981
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:05,585
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

982
01:26:05,669 --> 01:26:07,212
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

983
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,922
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

984
01:26:09,005 --> 01:26:10,924
Open your eyes!

985
01:26:14,845 --> 01:26:16,430
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

986
01:26:16,513 --> 01:26:18,014
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

987
01:26:18,098 --> 01:26:19,933
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

988
01:26:20,016 --> 01:26:22,352
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

989
01:26:22,436 --> 01:26:25,021
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

990
01:26:25,105 --> 01:26:26,481
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

991
01:26:26,565 --> 01:26:27,774
Why, you got something to tell us?

992
01:26:27,858 --> 01:26:28,734
Yeah!

993
01:26:29,401 --> 01:26:30,444
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

994
01:26:30,527 --> 01:26:31,361
What?

995
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:33,113
It's <i>"La."</i>

996
01:26:33,196 --> 01:26:34,489
<i>"La" rata.</i>

997
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,992
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

998
01:26:37,075 --> 01:26:38,952
Jesus! Look at you two.

999
01:26:39,369 --> 01:26:41,621
World's greatest detectives!

1000
01:26:42,038 --> 01:26:44,332
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

1001
01:26:44,416 --> 01:26:45,500
Jesus!

1002
01:26:45,584 --> 01:26:47,085
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

1003
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:49,171
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1004
01:26:50,589 --> 01:26:51,673
You think he made a mistake?

1005
01:26:51,757 --> 01:26:52,966
He doesn't make mistakes.

1006
01:26:53,049 --> 01:26:54,092
A rat with wings?

1007
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:55,761
You know what that sounds like to me?

1008
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:59,014
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1009
01:26:59,097 --> 01:27:01,099
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1010
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:10,609
"You are <i>el."</i>

1011
01:27:19,284 --> 01:27:20,786
Maybe it was a mistake.

1012
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:22,037
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1013
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:22,954
Wait.

1014
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,709
Is that him?

1015
01:27:28,585 --> 01:27:30,420
Holy shit.

1016
01:27:50,315 --> 01:27:51,900
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1017
01:28:21,304 --> 01:28:24,933
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1018
01:28:25,016 --> 01:28:27,853
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1019
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:29,855
I'll never know where I come from.

1020
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:32,065
Do you know what I am?"

1021
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:33,150
Any idea?

1022
01:28:33,692 --> 01:28:34,693
Yeah.

1023
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:37,362
It's an orphan.

1024
01:28:46,246 --> 01:28:47,998
A mansion in a slum.

1025
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:52,127
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1026
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,920
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1027
01:28:54,546 --> 01:28:56,131
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1028
01:28:56,214 --> 01:28:57,048
Let's go.

1029
01:29:00,302 --> 01:29:02,763
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1030
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:05,182
You gonna untie me?

1031
01:29:05,265 --> 01:29:06,725
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1032
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:11,646
Hey!

1033
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:15,525
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1034
01:29:29,623 --> 01:29:31,792
No guns.

1035
01:29:33,251 --> 01:29:35,295
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1036
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,609
What's that?

1037
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,038
Hey! Hey!

1038
01:30:16,503 --> 01:30:17,712
Dropheads.

1039
01:30:25,137 --> 01:30:26,763
What the hell is that?

1040
01:30:38,525 --> 01:30:40,902
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1041
01:30:40,986 --> 01:30:42,279
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1042
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:47,075
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1043
01:30:47,492 --> 01:30:49,077
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1044
01:30:50,829 --> 01:30:52,414
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1045
01:30:53,707 --> 01:30:55,500
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1046
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:00,172
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1047
01:31:00,714 --> 01:31:02,507
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1048
01:31:02,591 --> 01:31:05,427
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1049
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:08,847
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1050
01:31:09,389 --> 01:31:11,266
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1051
01:31:11,349 --> 01:31:14,144
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1052
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:17,439
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1053
01:31:18,023 --> 01:31:22,069
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1054
01:31:22,152 --> 01:31:24,071
<i>who need it now,</i>

1055
01:31:24,154 --> 01:31:25,614
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1056
01:31:25,697 --> 01:31:27,115
"Sins of the father."

1057
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,659
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1058
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,206
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1059
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:40,295
Shall be visited upon the son.

1060
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:45,425
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1061
01:31:50,013 --> 01:31:51,431
Hey!

1062
01:32:51,116 --> 01:32:53,660
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1063
01:32:53,744 --> 01:32:55,579
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1064
01:32:55,662 --> 01:32:57,289
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1065
01:32:57,956 --> 01:33:00,041
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1066
01:33:11,845 --> 01:33:13,597
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1067
01:33:14,765 --> 01:33:16,433
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:19,644
I've been trying to reach you.

1069
01:33:22,397 --> 01:33:24,065
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1070
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:28,361
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1071
01:33:51,093 --> 01:33:52,719
We've sedated him.

1072
01:33:52,803 --> 01:33:54,429
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1073
01:33:55,305 --> 01:33:58,016
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1074
01:33:58,558 --> 01:34:00,310
Is there anyone else to notify?

1075
01:34:01,645 --> 01:34:03,063
Next of kin?

1076
01:34:08,193 --> 01:34:09,277
No.

1077
01:34:10,404 --> 01:34:12,030
It's just me.

1078
01:35:55,133 --> 01:35:56,384
Selina?

1079
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:04,017
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1080
01:36:07,145 --> 01:36:09,564
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1081
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:11,525
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1082
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:32,129
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1083
01:36:33,213 --> 01:36:35,674
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1084
01:36:35,757 --> 01:36:38,218
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1085
01:36:38,885 --> 01:36:40,637
How could they do that to her?

1086
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,681
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1087
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:44,683
Her body was in his car.

1088
01:36:44,766 --> 01:36:47,644
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1089
01:36:47,727 --> 01:36:50,730
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1090
01:36:50,814 --> 01:36:52,357
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1091
01:36:52,441 --> 01:36:54,067
She didn't know any better.

1092
01:36:54,151 --> 01:36:55,485
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1093
01:36:55,569 --> 01:36:57,112
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1094
01:36:57,195 --> 01:36:58,697
It means your choices have consequences.

1095
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:01,158
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1096
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:03,952
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1097
01:37:04,035 --> 01:37:05,871
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1098
01:37:06,204 --> 01:37:08,373
Compromising yourself for money?

1099
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:12,002
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1100
01:37:13,628 --> 01:37:17,299
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1101
01:37:17,382 --> 01:37:18,717
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1102
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,135
Falcone owes me that money.

1103
01:37:20,218 --> 01:37:21,970
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1104
01:37:22,053 --> 01:37:22,888
Oh, really? Why's that?

1105
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:23,889
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1106
01:37:23,972 --> 01:37:25,724
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1107
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:26,808
would owe you anything.

1108
01:37:26,892 --> 01:37:29,227
Because he's my father!

1109
01:37:38,361 --> 01:37:41,156
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1110
01:37:42,657 --> 01:37:43,950
Just like Anni.

1111
01:37:46,119 --> 01:37:48,663
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1112
01:37:50,749 --> 01:37:52,084
To the club?

1113
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:54,002
Yeah.

1114
01:37:56,713 --> 01:37:59,591
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1115
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:01,802
Used to see him there.

1116
01:38:02,552 --> 01:38:04,554
He scared the shit out of me.

1117
01:38:06,515 --> 01:38:09,976
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1118
01:38:10,519 --> 01:38:14,356
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1119
01:38:17,734 --> 01:38:20,070
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1120
01:38:20,737 --> 01:38:22,239
Strangled.

1121
01:38:22,656 --> 01:38:26,118
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1122
01:38:27,994 --> 01:38:30,080
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1123
01:38:30,163 --> 01:38:32,332
and he didn't say a thing.

1124
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:35,961
Couldn't even look at me.

1125
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:41,466
He owes me that money.

1126
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,678
I'm sorry.

1127
01:38:45,804 --> 01:38:46,972
For what I said.

1128
01:38:48,348 --> 01:38:49,766
Oh, it's all right.

1129
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:55,397
You assume the worst in people.

1130
01:38:56,314 --> 01:38:57,691
Which, well...

1131
01:38:59,985 --> 01:39:01,903
maybe we're not so different after all.

1132
01:39:07,367 --> 01:39:09,119
Who are you under there?

1133
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:17,085
What are you hiding?

1134
01:39:19,463 --> 01:39:21,298
Are you just...

1135
01:39:22,883 --> 01:39:24,593
hideously scarred?

1136
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,721
Yeah.

1137
01:39:34,978 --> 01:39:36,396
Listen to me.

1138
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:40,817
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1139
01:39:41,985 --> 01:39:46,656
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1140
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:50,368
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1141
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:51,703
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1142
01:39:51,787 --> 01:39:53,038
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1143
01:39:53,121 --> 01:39:55,165
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1144
01:39:55,248 --> 01:39:56,500
I think you'd be on his side.

1145
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:58,210
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1146
01:39:58,293 --> 01:40:00,253
What, do you live in a cave?

1147
01:40:00,337 --> 01:40:02,422
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1148
01:40:03,507 --> 01:40:07,385
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1149
01:40:07,469 --> 01:40:08,678
will you help me?

1150
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:11,223
Please.

1151
01:40:14,017 --> 01:40:15,936
Come on, Vengeance.

1152
01:40:18,396 --> 01:40:20,649
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1153
01:40:20,732 --> 01:40:22,359
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1154
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:33,453
I told you, baby.

1155
01:40:35,372 --> 01:40:37,958
I can take care of myself.

1156
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:52,055
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1157
01:40:59,896 --> 01:41:03,483
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1158
01:41:03,608 --> 01:41:05,444
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1159
01:41:05,652 --> 01:41:08,071
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1160
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:09,698
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1161
01:41:10,407 --> 01:41:12,743
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1162
01:41:13,952 --> 01:41:16,288
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1163
01:41:16,371 --> 01:41:18,832
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1164
01:41:18,915 --> 01:41:22,085
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1165
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:28,091
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1166
01:41:28,175 --> 01:41:31,845
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1167
01:41:32,554 --> 01:41:34,097
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1168
01:41:34,181 --> 01:41:36,683
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1169
01:41:36,767 --> 01:41:38,393
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1170
01:41:38,477 --> 01:41:44,065
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1171
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:48,820
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1172
01:41:48,904 --> 01:41:51,281
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1173
01:41:52,115 --> 01:41:54,618
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1174
01:41:54,701 --> 01:41:58,622
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1175
01:41:58,747 --> 01:42:00,791
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1176
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:05,587
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1177
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:08,256
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1178
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:11,426
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1179
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:17,265
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1180
01:42:17,766 --> 01:42:20,143
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1181
01:42:20,227 --> 01:42:22,604
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1182
01:42:22,687 --> 01:42:26,149
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1183
01:42:26,233 --> 01:42:29,027
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1184
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:32,406
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1185
01:42:38,161 --> 01:42:39,246
Do you know who I am?

1186
01:42:40,872 --> 01:42:41,998
You're Bruce Wayne.

1187
01:42:42,082 --> 01:42:43,959
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1188
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:55,720
See?

1189
01:43:07,023 --> 01:43:09,651
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1190
01:43:10,402 --> 01:43:12,529
Must have made a fortune.

1191
01:43:12,988 --> 01:43:14,740
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1192
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:18,702
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1193
01:43:18,785 --> 01:43:19,786
No, boss.

1194
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:22,205
$1,183.

1195
01:43:22,789 --> 01:43:24,750
You know why communism failed, right?

1196
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:25,834
No, boss.

1197
01:43:27,753 --> 01:43:29,004
Austerity.

1198
01:43:31,256 --> 01:43:32,883
All right. All right.

1199
01:43:33,175 --> 01:43:35,552
Look at that. Perfect.

1200
01:43:35,635 --> 01:43:37,387
It's never gonna be that good again.

1201
01:43:39,598 --> 01:43:42,100
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1202
01:43:42,184 --> 01:43:43,351
What are you doing here?

1203
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:47,105
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1204
01:43:48,023 --> 01:43:49,065
Come on.

1205
01:43:50,984 --> 01:43:52,194
See ya, champ.

1206
01:43:53,195 --> 01:43:54,446
Come on, sweetheart.

1207
01:43:56,406 --> 01:43:57,407
Have a seat.

1208
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:01,244
I thought I might hear from you.

1209
01:44:02,412 --> 01:44:05,540
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1210
01:44:07,084 --> 01:44:08,877
stirring things up, huh?

1211
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,670
- Is it true?
- What?

1212
01:44:11,963 --> 01:44:13,590
That reporter business?

1213
01:44:14,925 --> 01:44:16,134
What do you want to know here, kid?

1214
01:44:16,218 --> 01:44:19,012
Did you kill him? For my father?

1215
01:44:19,096 --> 01:44:21,848
Look, your father was in trouble.

1216
01:44:22,724 --> 01:44:24,518
This reporter had some dirt.

1217
01:44:24,601 --> 01:44:26,228
Some very...

1218
01:44:27,395 --> 01:44:31,149
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1219
01:44:31,233 --> 01:44:33,944
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1220
01:44:34,027 --> 01:44:35,487
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1221
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:37,489
not right before the election.

1222
01:44:37,948 --> 01:44:40,242
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1223
01:44:40,325 --> 01:44:41,952
but he wasn't going for it.

1224
01:44:42,035 --> 01:44:45,205
So, he came to me.

1225
01:44:45,288 --> 01:44:47,666
Well, I never seen him like that.

1226
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,335
He said, "Carmine,

1227
01:44:51,128 --> 01:44:55,841
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1228
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:01,179
And when fear isn't enough...

1229
01:45:01,847 --> 01:45:03,682
Oof. Hmm.

1230
01:45:05,016 --> 01:45:08,353
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1231
01:45:09,354 --> 01:45:11,189
I handled it.

1232
01:45:12,899 --> 01:45:14,317
I know.

1233
01:45:14,401 --> 01:45:16,653
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1234
01:45:17,904 --> 01:45:19,740
But you'd be surprised

1235
01:45:19,823 --> 01:45:22,200
what even a good man like him

1236
01:45:22,284 --> 01:45:24,870
is capable of in the right situation.

1237
01:45:27,122 --> 01:45:28,582
Do me a favor.

1238
01:45:28,915 --> 01:45:30,959
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1239
01:45:31,668 --> 01:45:33,253
This reporter

1240
01:45:34,087 --> 01:45:35,672
was a lowlife.

1241
01:45:35,756 --> 01:45:37,215
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1242
01:45:38,842 --> 01:45:40,469
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1243
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:44,473
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1244
01:45:45,891 --> 01:45:49,394
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1245
01:45:49,478 --> 01:45:51,813
that your father would be in my pocket,

1246
01:45:52,564 --> 01:45:53,565
forever.

1247
01:45:54,232 --> 01:45:56,276
He would have done anything

1248
01:45:56,359 --> 01:45:58,528
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1249
01:45:58,612 --> 01:45:59,946
You understand?

1250
01:46:01,156 --> 01:46:05,702
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1251
01:46:05,786 --> 01:46:07,829
Do I know it for a fact?

1252
01:46:10,248 --> 01:46:12,334
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1253
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:16,004
This is what you wanted, huh?

1254
01:46:16,088 --> 01:46:18,507
This little conversation here?

1255
01:46:20,926 --> 01:46:23,095
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1256
01:46:25,722 --> 01:46:27,849
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1257
01:47:37,252 --> 01:47:38,545
You lied to me...

1258
01:47:41,381 --> 01:47:43,008
my whole life.

1259
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:50,223
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1260
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:56,605
He told me what he did for my father.

1261
01:48:00,609 --> 01:48:02,110
About Salvatore Maroni.

1262
01:48:04,112 --> 01:48:06,823
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1263
01:48:06,907 --> 01:48:08,658
Had my father killed.

1264
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,330
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1265
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:20,629
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1266
01:48:20,712 --> 01:48:23,048
believing that he was a good man.

1267
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:24,716
He was a good man.

1268
01:48:25,884 --> 01:48:27,594
You listen to me.

1269
01:48:27,677 --> 01:48:31,098
Your father was a good man.

1270
01:48:34,726 --> 01:48:36,645
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1271
01:48:36,728 --> 01:48:38,647
He had a man killed.

1272
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:39,815
Why?

1273
01:48:40,982 --> 01:48:44,236
To protect his family image?

1274
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,571
His political aspirations?

1275
01:48:46,655 --> 01:48:50,200
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1276
01:48:52,786 --> 01:48:54,329
He was protecting your mother.

1277
01:48:55,288 --> 01:48:58,834
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1278
01:48:58,917 --> 01:49:01,044
He cared about her,

1279
01:49:01,128 --> 01:49:02,421
and you,

1280
01:49:02,504 --> 01:49:05,424
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1281
01:49:05,507 --> 01:49:08,969
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1282
01:49:09,845 --> 01:49:13,181
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1283
01:49:13,265 --> 01:49:16,393
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1284
01:49:16,476 --> 01:49:18,311
That's who Falcone is.

1285
01:49:20,564 --> 01:49:22,774
And that was your father's mistake.

1286
01:49:22,858 --> 01:49:24,901
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1287
01:49:24,985 --> 01:49:27,738
your father was distraught.

1288
01:49:28,613 --> 01:49:31,825
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1289
01:49:31,908 --> 01:49:34,077
that he would confess everything.

1290
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:37,581
And that night,

1291
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:41,585
your father and your mother were killed.

1292
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:48,842
It was Falcone?

1293
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:57,017
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1294
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:05,275
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1295
01:50:05,358 --> 01:50:08,111
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1296
01:50:08,195 --> 01:50:13,408
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1297
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:19,039
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1298
01:50:19,706 --> 01:50:21,500
I know you always blamed yourself.

1299
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:24,127
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1300
01:50:26,296 --> 01:50:28,590
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1301
01:50:30,008 --> 01:50:32,385
but I didn't know how to help.

1302
01:50:32,469 --> 01:50:34,971
I could teach you how to fight,

1303
01:50:36,348 --> 01:50:39,017
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1304
01:50:39,101 --> 01:50:40,936
You needed a father.

1305
01:50:42,896 --> 01:50:45,315
And all you had was me.

1306
01:50:47,692 --> 01:50:48,902
I'm sorry.

1307
01:50:50,654 --> 01:50:52,572
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1308
01:50:59,371 --> 01:51:00,455
God.

1309
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:07,921
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1310
01:51:10,632 --> 01:51:12,759
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1311
01:51:19,182 --> 01:51:20,434
I mean,

1312
01:51:21,643 --> 01:51:23,770
I'm not afraid to die.

1313
01:51:25,522 --> 01:51:27,899
I realize now there's something

1314
01:51:29,025 --> 01:51:30,902
I haven't got past.

1315
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:33,572
This fear...

1316
01:51:36,032 --> 01:51:38,994
of ever going through any of that again.

1317
01:51:43,248 --> 01:51:45,459
Of losing somebody I care about.

1318
01:52:36,051 --> 01:52:37,010
Hey.

1319
01:52:37,094 --> 01:52:39,846
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1320
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:41,848
I thought it was you.

1321
01:52:54,778 --> 01:52:56,321
- I found him!
- I see that.

1322
01:52:56,405 --> 01:52:57,906
He had my shit and my phone.

1323
01:52:57,989 --> 01:52:59,199
She left a message
the night they took her.

1324
01:52:59,282 --> 01:53:00,200
She called me...

1325
01:53:00,283 --> 01:53:01,993
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1326
01:53:02,077 --> 01:53:03,370
She got my gun!

1327
01:53:04,704 --> 01:53:06,415
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1328
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:10,502
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1329
01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:17,175
Here. Listen.

1330
01:53:19,136 --> 01:53:20,804
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1331
01:53:20,929 --> 01:53:23,098
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1332
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:25,267
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1333
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:26,685
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1334
01:53:26,768 --> 01:53:28,478
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1335
01:53:28,562 --> 01:53:29,604
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1336
01:53:29,688 --> 01:53:30,981
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1337
01:53:31,064 --> 01:53:33,734
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1338
01:53:35,610 --> 01:53:37,654
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1339
01:53:38,363 --> 01:53:40,907
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1340
01:53:40,991 --> 01:53:43,910
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1341
01:53:43,994 --> 01:53:46,705
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1342
01:53:47,247 --> 01:53:49,249
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1343
01:53:49,958 --> 01:53:52,836
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1344
01:53:52,919 --> 01:53:55,630
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1345
01:53:55,714 --> 01:53:57,841
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1346
01:53:57,924 --> 01:54:01,052
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1347
01:54:01,887 --> 01:54:04,431
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1348
01:54:05,515 --> 01:54:06,850
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1349
01:54:07,642 --> 01:54:11,188
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1350
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:12,898
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1351
01:54:12,981 --> 01:54:14,941
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1352
01:54:15,025 --> 01:54:16,318
<i>The deal.</i>

1353
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:21,323
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1354
01:54:21,406 --> 01:54:24,117
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1355
01:54:24,201 --> 01:54:26,578
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1356
01:54:26,661 --> 01:54:27,788
<i>Right.</i>

1357
01:54:28,538 --> 01:54:29,915
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1358
01:54:30,874 --> 01:54:33,043
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1359
01:54:40,717 --> 01:54:42,052
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1360
01:54:42,135 --> 01:54:43,678
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1361
01:54:43,762 --> 01:54:46,807
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1362
01:54:56,024 --> 01:54:57,317
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1363
01:55:02,072 --> 01:55:03,865
A falcon has wings too.

1364
01:55:04,199 --> 01:55:06,034
Falcone is the rat?

1365
01:55:17,003 --> 01:55:20,173
Falcone works for you guys?

1366
01:55:20,841 --> 01:55:23,385
The mayor? The DA?

1367
01:55:26,388 --> 01:55:27,472
No.

1368
01:55:30,559 --> 01:55:31,852
We work for him.

1369
01:55:32,853 --> 01:55:34,104
Everybody does.

1370
01:55:34,187 --> 01:55:35,188
How?

1371
01:55:35,272 --> 01:55:36,857
Through Renewal.

1372
01:55:37,649 --> 01:55:39,025
Renewal is everything.

1373
01:55:39,109 --> 01:55:40,444
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1374
01:55:41,027 --> 01:55:44,740
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1375
01:55:44,823 --> 01:55:48,410
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1376
01:55:48,493 --> 01:55:51,872
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1377
01:55:51,955 --> 01:55:54,040
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1378
01:55:54,124 --> 01:55:55,834
Everybody got a piece.

1379
01:55:55,917 --> 01:55:57,753
But Falcone wanted more.

1380
01:55:59,546 --> 01:56:02,758
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1381
01:56:04,176 --> 01:56:06,511
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1382
01:56:06,887 --> 01:56:09,598
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1383
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:12,142
then install them all as his puppets.

1384
01:56:12,225 --> 01:56:14,770
You think this goddamn election matters?

1385
01:56:16,396 --> 01:56:18,315
Falcone's the mayor.

1386
01:56:19,274 --> 01:56:21,777
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1387
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:23,236
Come on, Vengeance.

1388
01:56:23,945 --> 01:56:25,781
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1389
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:28,116
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1390
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:29,034
No!

1391
01:56:30,494 --> 01:56:31,703
We'll get him.

1392
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:34,247
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1393
01:56:34,331 --> 01:56:35,457
He owns the city!

1394
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:36,792
Cross that line...

1395
01:56:37,584 --> 01:56:38,877
you'll become just like him.

1396
01:56:39,586 --> 01:56:41,129
Listen to me.

1397
01:56:41,213 --> 01:56:43,090
Don't throw your life away.

1398
01:56:49,638 --> 01:56:51,014
Don't worry, honey.

1399
01:56:54,101 --> 01:56:55,560
I got nine of 'em.

1400
01:56:55,685 --> 01:56:57,646
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1401
01:56:58,939 --> 01:57:00,232
Oh, God!

1402
01:57:09,533 --> 01:57:10,659
She won't get out of there alive.

1403
01:57:10,826 --> 01:57:13,412
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1404
01:57:13,495 --> 01:57:14,496
I have to stop her.

1405
01:57:14,663 --> 01:57:15,622
Don't you mean "we"?

1406
01:57:16,957 --> 01:57:18,500
I gotta do this my way.

1407
01:57:18,834 --> 01:57:19,835
And then what?

1408
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:22,087
We do what Riddler said.

1409
01:57:22,921 --> 01:57:24,548
Bring the rat into the light.

1410
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,544
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1411
01:58:02,627 --> 01:58:04,087
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1412
01:58:04,713 --> 01:58:06,047
Tell him it's about Annika.

1413
01:58:09,301 --> 01:58:10,635
Hey!

1414
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:12,888
Look who it is, huh?

1415
01:58:12,971 --> 01:58:15,390
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1416
01:58:15,474 --> 01:58:17,476
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1417
01:58:17,642 --> 01:58:19,102
Absolutely.

1418
01:58:20,854 --> 01:58:21,855
Alone?

1419
01:58:38,413 --> 01:58:39,498
Hey!

1420
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:51,259
I'm just so worried.

1421
01:58:51,343 --> 01:58:52,969
I don't know where she is.

1422
01:58:54,721 --> 01:58:58,100
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1423
01:58:58,183 --> 01:59:01,603
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1424
01:59:03,105 --> 01:59:05,482
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1425
01:59:06,942 --> 01:59:08,068
I'm sorry.

1426
01:59:08,276 --> 01:59:09,361
It's okay.

1427
01:59:09,444 --> 01:59:11,571
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1428
01:59:11,738 --> 01:59:14,616
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1429
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:19,788
Mr. Falcone?

1430
01:59:19,871 --> 01:59:21,331
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1431
01:59:21,415 --> 01:59:24,334
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1432
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:28,213
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1433
01:59:28,296 --> 01:59:29,714
I'll be right back.

1434
01:59:45,021 --> 01:59:46,106
Holy shit.

1435
01:59:46,189 --> 01:59:47,858
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

1451
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:32,861
Hey, Dad.

1452
02:00:33,904 --> 02:00:34,905
What?

1453
02:00:35,363 --> 02:00:37,407
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1454
02:00:39,034 --> 02:00:40,494
You remember her?

1455
02:00:42,537 --> 02:00:43,580
Yeah.

1456
02:00:47,876 --> 02:00:48,960
Just put down the gun, honey.

1457
02:00:49,044 --> 02:00:50,128
This is for my mother.

1458
02:01:47,394 --> 02:01:48,562
I see him!

1459
02:02:32,606 --> 02:02:34,357
You don't think this hurts me?

1460
02:02:38,945 --> 02:02:41,239
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1461
02:02:57,631 --> 02:02:59,466
You made me do this.

1462
02:03:00,884 --> 02:03:02,677
Just like your mother.

1463
02:03:08,683 --> 02:03:10,018
He has to pay!

1464
02:03:13,939 --> 02:03:15,065
You don't have to pay with him.

1465
02:03:18,693 --> 02:03:20,195
You paid enough.

1466
02:03:54,771 --> 02:03:55,897
Jesus.

1467
02:03:55,981 --> 02:03:58,692
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1468
02:03:58,775 --> 02:04:01,862
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1469
02:04:01,945 --> 02:04:03,196
I'm gonna start crying,

1470
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,782
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1471
02:04:05,866 --> 02:04:07,492
Let me tell you something.

1472
02:04:07,576 --> 02:04:09,286
Whatever I know,

1473
02:04:09,369 --> 02:04:11,246
whatever I've done,

1474
02:04:11,329 --> 02:04:15,667
it's all going with me to my grave.

1475
02:04:26,219 --> 02:04:28,180
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1476
02:04:29,806 --> 02:04:32,100
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1477
02:04:40,025 --> 02:04:42,360
I guess we don't all work for you.

1478
02:04:51,369 --> 02:04:52,913
You have the right to remain silent.

1479
02:04:53,747 --> 02:04:57,250
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1480
02:04:57,334 --> 02:04:58,668
You have the right to an attorney.

1481
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,920
If you cannot afford one,

1482
02:05:00,003 --> 02:05:01,797
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1483
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:03,590
Do you understand these rights?

1484
02:05:05,092 --> 02:05:06,676
Do you understand?

1485
02:05:08,637 --> 02:05:09,721
Yeah.

1486
02:05:09,805 --> 02:05:11,890
I'll see you when I walk out.

1487
02:05:11,973 --> 02:05:12,974
With these rights in mind,

1488
02:05:13,058 --> 02:05:14,351
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1489
02:05:14,434 --> 02:05:15,685
Goddamn rat.

1490
02:05:17,646 --> 02:05:18,980
What'd you say?

1491
02:05:19,064 --> 02:05:20,816
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1492
02:05:21,942 --> 02:05:23,193
Probably be your last.

1493
02:05:23,443 --> 02:05:26,488
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1494
02:05:26,571 --> 02:05:27,656
Maybe I am.

1495
02:05:27,739 --> 02:05:28,949
Really, Oz?

1496
02:05:29,032 --> 02:05:33,745
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1497
02:05:33,829 --> 02:05:34,913
I'll spray paint your ass!

1498
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,085
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1499
02:05:40,544 --> 02:05:42,546
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1500
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:45,340
Get your hands off of me!

1501
02:06:04,901 --> 02:06:06,903
"Bring him into the light.

1502
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:12,451
And you'll find where I'm at."

1503
02:06:12,534 --> 02:06:13,618
There!

1504
02:06:13,702 --> 02:06:15,537
The shots came from up there!

1505
02:06:17,122 --> 02:06:18,123
It's Riddler.

1506
02:06:20,208 --> 02:06:21,376
Gage, on me.

1507
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:24,171
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1508
02:07:38,370 --> 02:07:39,579
He's gone.

1509
02:07:49,381 --> 02:07:51,341
He's been here this whole time.

1510
02:07:51,425 --> 02:07:53,760
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1511
02:07:53,844 --> 02:07:54,970
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1512
02:07:55,053 --> 02:07:57,722
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1513
02:07:57,806 --> 02:08:00,267
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1514
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:03,270
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1515
02:08:18,785 --> 02:08:20,871
Police! Hands up!

1516
02:08:23,915 --> 02:08:27,419
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1517
02:08:46,563 --> 02:08:48,482
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1518
02:08:51,443 --> 02:08:52,736
Stay still!

1519
02:08:52,819 --> 02:08:53,820
Now!

1520
02:09:22,474 --> 02:09:24,267
Which one is you?

1521
02:09:24,351 --> 02:09:25,852
You tell me.

1522
02:09:26,686 --> 02:09:28,146
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1523
02:09:31,233 --> 02:09:32,984
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1524
02:09:47,499 --> 02:09:50,419
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1525
02:09:50,502 --> 02:09:53,088
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1526
02:09:53,171 --> 02:09:55,757
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...</i>

1527
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:56,883
Hey.

1528
02:10:21,324 --> 02:10:23,034
What are all these diaries?

1529
02:10:23,118 --> 02:10:25,537
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1530
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:29,166
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1531
02:10:29,249 --> 02:10:30,792
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1532
02:10:30,876 --> 02:10:33,170
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1533
02:10:33,253 --> 02:10:35,088
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1534
02:10:35,172 --> 02:10:37,591
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1535
02:10:37,674 --> 02:10:39,426
What about chain of evidence?

1536
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:41,470
You should see this.

1537
02:10:47,434 --> 02:10:48,935
He's wearing gloves.

1538
02:10:50,395 --> 02:10:52,647
"Friday, July 16th.

1539
02:10:52,731 --> 02:10:56,443
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1540
02:10:56,777 --> 02:10:59,821
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1541
02:10:59,905 --> 02:11:01,323
But then, today, I saw it.

1542
02:11:01,406 --> 02:11:05,535
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1543
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:08,663
'Renewal.'

1544
02:11:08,747 --> 02:11:13,168
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1545
02:11:13,251 --> 02:11:16,379
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1546
02:11:16,463 --> 02:11:19,800
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1547
02:11:19,883 --> 02:11:22,344
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1548
02:11:22,427 --> 02:11:25,430
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1549
02:11:26,556 --> 02:11:28,391
"If you want people to understand,

1550
02:11:28,475 --> 02:11:30,310
really understand,

1551
02:11:30,393 --> 02:11:32,687
you can't just give them the answers.

1552
02:11:32,771 --> 02:11:34,231
You have to confront them,

1553
02:11:34,314 --> 02:11:36,733
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1554
02:11:36,817 --> 02:11:38,985
just like they tortured me.

1555
02:11:39,069 --> 02:11:41,863
I know now what I must become."

1556
02:11:44,825 --> 02:11:46,159
Jesus.

1557
02:11:52,249 --> 02:11:54,209
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1558
02:11:54,751 --> 02:11:56,253
This one's not a rat.

1559
02:12:12,894 --> 02:12:14,020
What is that?

1560
02:12:45,635 --> 02:12:46,845
Some kind of pry tool?

1561
02:12:46,928 --> 02:12:48,305
Is it a chisel?

1562
02:12:48,388 --> 02:12:49,848
It's a murder weapon.

1563
02:12:49,931 --> 02:12:51,308
He killed Mitchell with it.

1564
02:12:51,975 --> 02:12:54,853
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1565
02:13:03,445 --> 02:13:05,447
"My confession"?

1566
02:13:05,530 --> 02:13:08,408
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1567
02:13:08,492 --> 02:13:09,868
This isn't over.

1568
02:13:09,951 --> 02:13:12,370
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1569
02:13:12,788 --> 02:13:14,998
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1570
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:25,300
His final post was last night.

1571
02:13:25,383 --> 02:13:28,595
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1572
02:13:28,678 --> 02:13:31,681
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1573
02:13:31,807 --> 02:13:35,227
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1574
02:13:46,571 --> 02:13:49,116
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1575
02:13:50,742 --> 02:13:52,452
"The Truth Unmasked."

1576
02:13:53,286 --> 02:13:54,913
I think I'm his last target.

1577
02:13:57,499 --> 02:13:58,583
You?

1578
02:13:58,959 --> 02:14:01,002
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1579
02:14:01,545 --> 02:14:02,921
What is?

1580
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:04,798
The Batman.

1581
02:14:10,178 --> 02:14:11,346
Yeah?

1582
02:14:22,649 --> 02:14:23,859
Right.

1583
02:14:26,737 --> 02:14:30,699
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1584
02:14:38,165 --> 02:14:39,666
You're a good cop.

1585
02:15:04,274 --> 02:15:06,651
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1586
02:15:07,402 --> 02:15:09,237
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1587
02:15:09,321 --> 02:15:10,864
"Want"?

1588
02:15:11,448 --> 02:15:15,077
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1589
02:15:16,286 --> 02:15:17,621
<i>For this moment.</i>

1590
02:15:18,663 --> 02:15:21,666
I've been invisible my whole life.

1591
02:15:22,751 --> 02:15:25,378
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1592
02:15:26,922 --> 02:15:29,341
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1593
02:15:29,424 --> 02:15:31,259
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1594
02:15:41,645 --> 02:15:43,605
<i>Bruce...</i>

1595
02:15:46,483 --> 02:15:48,318
<i>Wayne.</i>

1596
02:15:50,695 --> 02:15:54,449
Bruce...

1597
02:15:55,867 --> 02:15:58,745
<i>Wayne.</i>

1598
02:16:10,006 --> 02:16:12,426
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1599
02:16:15,011 --> 02:16:18,390
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1600
02:16:18,473 --> 02:16:20,851
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1601
02:16:23,311 --> 02:16:27,566
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1602
02:16:28,108 --> 02:16:31,653
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1603
02:16:31,737 --> 02:16:35,407
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1604
02:16:35,991 --> 02:16:37,534
<i>Orphan.</i>

1605
02:16:43,206 --> 02:16:48,336
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1606
02:16:49,629 --> 02:16:54,259
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1607
02:16:54,926 --> 02:16:56,470
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1608
02:16:59,097 --> 02:17:01,767
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1609
02:17:02,142 --> 02:17:04,728
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1610
02:17:06,021 --> 02:17:10,067
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

1611
02:17:11,777 --> 02:17:16,448
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1612
02:17:17,616 --> 02:17:20,786
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1613
02:17:20,869 --> 02:17:23,163
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1614
02:17:24,456 --> 02:17:27,042
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1615
02:17:29,961 --> 02:17:33,131
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1616
02:17:33,215 --> 02:17:36,134
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1617
02:17:36,218 --> 02:17:37,219
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1618
02:17:38,678 --> 02:17:40,722
<i>Bruce...</i>

1619
02:17:41,765 --> 02:17:43,683
<i>Wayne.</i>

1620
02:17:47,354 --> 02:17:50,440
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1621
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:56,988
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1622
02:17:58,448 --> 02:18:02,327
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1623
02:18:05,497 --> 02:18:06,665
<i>God.</i>

1624
02:18:07,666 --> 02:18:08,959
<i>Look at you.</i>

1625
02:18:10,627 --> 02:18:13,088
Your mask is amazing.

1626
02:18:13,171 --> 02:18:16,091
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1627
02:18:16,174 --> 02:18:17,259
Ain't it funny?

1628
02:18:17,342 --> 02:18:21,763
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1629
02:18:23,223 --> 02:18:25,267
<i>You and I both know</i>

1630
02:18:26,226 --> 02:18:28,728
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1631
02:18:28,812 --> 02:18:32,441
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1632
02:18:32,524 --> 02:18:34,067
<i>No shame,</i>

1633
02:18:34,985 --> 02:18:35,986
<i>no limits.</i>

1634
02:18:36,069 --> 02:18:37,738
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1635
02:18:38,613 --> 02:18:39,614
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1636
02:18:39,698 --> 02:18:41,408
<i>All those cards.</i>

1637
02:18:41,491 --> 02:18:42,701
<i>I told you,</i>

1638
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:45,328
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1639
02:18:45,412 --> 02:18:47,622
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1640
02:18:47,706 --> 02:18:49,166
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1641
02:18:49,249 --> 02:18:51,251
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1642
02:18:51,334 --> 02:18:52,502
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1643
02:18:52,586 --> 02:18:53,587
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1644
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:56,173
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1645
02:18:56,256 --> 02:18:58,675
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1646
02:18:58,759 --> 02:19:01,928
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1647
02:19:02,012 --> 02:19:03,638
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1648
02:19:03,722 --> 02:19:04,931
You gave me that.

1649
02:19:05,015 --> 02:19:06,141
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1650
02:19:06,224 --> 02:19:08,810
You showed me what was possible.

1651
02:19:08,894 --> 02:19:13,774
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1652
02:19:13,857 --> 02:19:15,400
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1653
02:19:15,484 --> 02:19:16,985
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1654
02:19:18,111 --> 02:19:19,196
<i>What?</i>

1655
02:19:19,279 --> 02:19:21,448
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1656
02:19:21,531 --> 02:19:22,908
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1657
02:19:22,991 --> 02:19:24,493
You think you'll be remembered?

1658
02:19:24,576 --> 02:19:26,244
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1659
02:19:26,745 --> 02:19:28,497
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1660
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:30,248
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1661
02:19:30,332 --> 02:19:31,374
<i>No, no!</i>

1662
02:19:31,458 --> 02:19:32,375
<i>A nobody!</i>

1663
02:19:34,169 --> 02:19:35,962
<i>No!</i>

1664
02:19:37,881 --> 02:19:40,258
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1665
02:19:40,509 --> 02:19:43,095
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1666
02:19:44,054 --> 02:19:47,682
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1667
02:19:47,766 --> 02:19:50,393
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1668
02:19:51,394 --> 02:19:53,396
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1669
02:19:53,772 --> 02:19:57,067
We could watch the whole thing together.

1670
02:19:57,150 --> 02:19:58,151
<i>Watch what?</i>

1671
02:19:58,235 --> 02:19:59,986
<i>Everything!</i>

1672
02:20:08,328 --> 02:20:09,996
<i>It was all there.</i>

1673
02:20:12,165 --> 02:20:14,501
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1674
02:20:18,797 --> 02:20:22,717
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1675
02:20:24,761 --> 02:20:26,847
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1676
02:20:27,305 --> 02:20:28,557
<i>What have you done?</i>

1677
02:20:29,266 --> 02:20:34,146
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1678
02:20:36,982 --> 02:20:38,817
<i>You.</i>

1679
02:20:40,485 --> 02:20:42,612
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

1680
02:20:43,947 --> 02:20:45,490
<i>What have you done?</i>

1681
02:20:47,033 --> 02:20:52,873
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1682
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:55,167
<i>What have you done?</i>

1683
02:20:57,627 --> 02:20:59,004
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1684
02:20:59,171 --> 02:21:00,589
<i>What have you done?</i>

1685
02:21:04,593 --> 02:21:07,971
<i>Maria</i>

1686
02:21:08,138 --> 02:21:13,685
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1687
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:46,927
Hey!

1688
02:21:47,928 --> 02:21:49,221
What are you doing in here?

1689
02:22:07,155 --> 02:22:09,741
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1690
02:22:16,331 --> 02:22:18,792
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1691
02:22:19,668 --> 02:22:22,421
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1692
02:22:27,092 --> 02:22:30,137
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1693
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:32,389
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1694
02:22:32,472 --> 02:22:34,724
It's a tucker.

1695
02:22:52,534 --> 02:22:53,535
Huh.

1696
02:23:08,717 --> 02:23:11,511
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1697
02:23:11,595 --> 02:23:13,096
What are you doing?

1698
02:23:43,627 --> 02:23:45,045
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1699
02:23:45,378 --> 02:23:47,589
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

1713

<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

1714
02:24:35,512 --> 02:24:38,473
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1715
02:24:38,557 --> 02:24:42,394
<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1716
02:24:42,477 --> 02:24:46,314

<i>for retribution.</i>

1720
02:24:58,535 --> 02:25:01,329
<i>I've parked seven vans</i>

02:25:49,878 --> 02:25:52,005
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

02:27:10,417 --> 02:27:12,461
I can't get through! The lines are down.

1751
02:27:18,091 --> 02:27:20,260
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1752
02:27:20,844 --> 02:27:22,471
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1753
02:27:22,554 --> 02:27:25,432
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1754
02:27:25,515 --> 02:27:27,476
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

1755
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:38,779
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1756
02:27:38,862 --> 02:27:40,363
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1757
02:27:40,447 --> 02:27:42,282
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1758
02:27:42,365 --> 02:27:43,617
We got an active situation.

1759
02:27:43,742 --> 02:27:45,035
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1760
02:27:45,118 --> 02:27:46,328
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1761
02:27:46,411 --> 02:27:47,329
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1762
02:27:47,412 --> 02:27:48,246
Come!

1763
02:28:24,282 --> 02:28:25,700
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1764
02:28:25,784 --> 02:28:26,660
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1765
02:28:26,743 --> 02:28:28,120
The water's already started to breach.

1766
02:28:28,203 --> 02:28:29,746
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1767
02:28:29,830 --> 02:28:32,040
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1768
02:28:32,124 --> 02:28:33,959
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1769
02:28:34,042 --> 02:28:36,378
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1770
02:28:36,461 --> 02:28:38,713
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1771
02:28:38,797 --> 02:28:41,049
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1772
02:28:41,133 --> 02:28:42,968
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1773
02:28:43,051 --> 02:28:46,054
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1774
02:28:46,138 --> 02:28:47,639
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1775
02:28:52,811 --> 02:28:56,273
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1776
02:28:56,356 --> 02:28:58,650
Please! I just need your attention!

1777
02:29:14,541 --> 02:29:15,667
You're okay!

1778
02:30:46,591 --> 02:30:49,219
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1779
02:30:49,302 --> 02:30:50,512
Follow me, sir.

1780
02:33:00,517 --> 02:33:02,018
No, no. It's okay.

1781
02:33:02,102 --> 02:33:03,145
It's okay.

1782
02:33:04,312 --> 02:33:05,355
It's okay.

1783
02:33:06,982 --> 02:33:09,109
It's done now. It's done.

1784
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:13,155
It's over.

1785
02:34:09,002 --> 02:34:12,464
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1786
02:34:13,173 --> 02:34:15,509
Take it easy. Easy.

1787
02:34:44,079 --> 02:34:45,205
Jesus.

1788
02:34:55,048 --> 02:34:56,716
Who the hell are you?

1789
02:35:00,929 --> 02:35:01,930
Me?

1790
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:06,518
I'm Vengeance.

1791
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:41,274
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1792
02:38:44,486 --> 02:38:46,363
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1793
02:38:48,698 --> 02:38:50,450
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1794
02:38:52,744 --> 02:38:54,746
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1795
02:38:55,664 --> 02:38:57,290
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1796
02:39:00,502 --> 02:39:04,214
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1797
02:39:04,297 --> 02:39:06,842
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1798
02:39:08,009 --> 02:39:11,721
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1799
02:39:14,683 --> 02:39:17,811
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1800
02:39:19,187 --> 02:39:20,564
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1801
02:39:21,189 --> 02:39:22,649
But not just our city.

1802
02:39:23,358 --> 02:39:27,571
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1803
02:39:27,654 --> 02:39:29,740
in our elected officials,

1804
02:39:29,823 --> 02:39:31,116
in each other.

1805
02:39:31,908 --> 02:39:35,245
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1806
02:39:39,583 --> 02:39:41,251
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1807
02:39:42,711 --> 02:39:44,880
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1808
02:39:46,965 --> 02:39:48,884
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1809
02:39:51,261 --> 02:39:54,306
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1810
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:58,018
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1811
02:40:00,437 --> 02:40:02,481
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1812
02:40:05,567 --> 02:40:07,194
<i>People need hope.</i>

1813
02:40:08,403 --> 02:40:10,614
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1814
02:40:14,409 --> 02:40:16,078
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1815
02:40:16,995 --> 02:40:18,371
<i>scarred,</i>

1816
02:40:19,289 --> 02:40:20,540
<i>like me.</i>

1817
02:40:22,667 --> 02:40:24,753
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1818
02:40:26,129 --> 02:40:28,840
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1819
02:40:30,467 --> 02:40:32,219
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1820
02:40:33,720 --> 02:40:35,597
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1821
02:40:37,474 --> 02:40:39,392
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1822
02:40:40,352 --> 02:40:41,853
<i>to endure...</i>

1823
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:45,357
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1824
02:40:48,276 --> 02:40:50,445
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1825
02:40:50,529 --> 02:40:53,323
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1826
02:40:53,407 --> 02:40:54,991
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1827
02:40:55,075 --> 02:40:56,701
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1828
02:40:56,785 --> 02:40:59,788
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1829
02:40:59,871 --> 02:41:02,416
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1830
02:41:02,499 --> 02:41:04,835
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1831
02:41:04,918 --> 02:41:07,379
Isn't that just terrible?

1832
02:41:08,755 --> 02:41:10,674
Him...

1833
02:41:10,757 --> 02:41:13,635
raining on your parade like that?

1834
02:41:19,349 --> 02:41:21,351
What is it they say?

1835
02:41:22,519 --> 02:41:24,688
"One day you're on top,

1836
02:41:26,231 --> 02:41:27,899
the next...

1837
02:41:29,276 --> 02:41:31,194
you're a clown."

1838
02:41:33,572 --> 02:41:34,740
Well,

1839
02:41:36,533 --> 02:41:39,369
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1840
02:41:41,663 --> 02:41:44,332
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1841
02:41:45,625 --> 02:41:47,461
You did so well.

1842
02:41:51,965 --> 02:41:52,966
And you know,

1843
02:41:54,634 --> 02:41:57,846
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1844
02:42:07,898 --> 02:42:09,274
Who are you?

1845
02:42:09,816 --> 02:42:12,235
Well, that's the question,

1846
02:42:13,487 --> 02:42:14,654
isn't it?

1847
02:42:17,574 --> 02:42:19,951
Riddle me this...

1848
02:42:22,412 --> 02:42:24,539
"The less of them you have,

1849
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:29,127
the more one is worth."

1850
02:42:34,549 --> 02:42:36,301
A friend.

1851
02:43:02,536 --> 02:43:03,537
You're leaving.

1852
02:43:04,454 --> 02:43:05,539
Jesus.

1853
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:08,875
Don't you ever just say hello?

1854
02:43:13,964 --> 02:43:15,382
Where will you go?

1855
02:43:16,883 --> 02:43:19,302
I don't know. Upstate.

1856
02:43:19,719 --> 02:43:21,430
Bludhaven, maybe.

1857
02:43:22,305 --> 02:43:23,306
Why?

1858
02:43:24,516 --> 02:43:25,725
You asking me to stay?

1859
02:43:32,774 --> 02:43:34,901
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1860
02:43:35,318 --> 02:43:37,654
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1861
02:43:37,738 --> 02:43:39,656
There's gonna be a power grab.

1862
02:43:41,283 --> 02:43:42,409
It'll be bloody.

1863
02:43:43,034 --> 02:43:44,244
I know.

1864
02:43:45,787 --> 02:43:46,872
But the city can change.

1865
02:43:46,955 --> 02:43:48,206
It won't.

1866
02:43:49,332 --> 02:43:50,333
I have to try.

1867
02:43:50,417 --> 02:43:52,210
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1868
02:43:54,504 --> 02:43:55,630
Listen.

1869
02:43:58,049 --> 02:43:59,301
Why don't you come with me?

1870
02:44:00,260 --> 02:44:01,762
Get into some trouble.

1871
02:44:02,512 --> 02:44:06,016
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1872
02:44:06,683 --> 02:44:08,310
The bat and the cat.

1873
02:44:09,811 --> 02:44:11,480
It's got a nice ring.

1874
02:44:24,826 --> 02:44:26,244
Who am I kidding?

1875
02:44:27,704 --> 02:44:29,831
You're already spoken for.

1876
02:44:41,718 --> 02:44:43,136
You should go.

1877
02:44:51,478 --> 02:44:52,479
Selina...

1878
02:44:56,566 --> 02:44:58,235
Take care of yourself.
