00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,376
<i>The forests of Pandora...</i>

2
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,628
<i>hold many dangers.</i>

3
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>But the most dangerous thing...</i>

4
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,928
<i>about Pandora...</i>

5
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>is that you may grow
to love her too much.</i>

6
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,784
<i>We sing the song cords to remember.</i>

7
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,828
<i>Each bead...</i>

8
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,537
<i>a story in our life.</i>

9
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>A bead for the birth of our son.</i>

10
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,798
Neteyam!

11
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,759
Neteyam!

12
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,725
<i>A bead...</i>

13
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,061
<i>when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.</i>

14
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,189
<i>Born of Grace's avatar.</i>

15
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,651
<i>A daughter whose
conception was a total mystery.</i>

16
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,166
<i>A bead...</i>

17
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,626
<i>for the first
communion with Eywa.</i>

18
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>The People say...</i>

19
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,257
<i>we live in Eywa...</i>

20
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,886
<i>and Eywa lives in us.</i>

21
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,266
<i>The Great Mother...</i>

22
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,684
<i>holds all her children...</i>

23
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>in her heart.</i>

24
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,945
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

25
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,801
<i>But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code?</i>

26
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,545
<i>Before I knew it, we had four.</i>

27
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>When we sent the Sky
People back to Earth...</i>

28
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,595
<i>a few of 'em stayed.</i>

29
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,139
<i>Science guys,
loyal to the</i> Na'vi.

30
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,225
<i>And then there was Spider.</i>

31
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>He was just stuck here.</i>

32
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>Too young for a cryo-capsule.</i>

33
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,814
You little wild man.

34
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,565
See you, Norm!

35
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,441
<i>Orphaned by the war...</i>

36
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,067
<i>he was raised by the lab guys.</i>

37
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:54,860
Spider, take your spare!

38
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,403
I'm just going to the village!

39
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,531
<i>He wasn't part of our family.</i>

40
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,949
<i>He was like a stray cat.</i>

41
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,117
<i>Just always around.</i>

42
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,621
<i>Inseparable from our kids.</i>

43
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,751
<i>To Neytiri...</i>

44
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,211
<i>he would always be alien.</i>

45
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,087
<i>One of them.</i>

46
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,268
{\an8}<i>Took a few years to get the
language through my thick skull.</i>

47
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,437
{\an8}<i>But now when I hear it...</i>

48
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,682
{\an8}<i>it might as well be English.</i>

49
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,023
{\an8}I hate you!

50
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,401
Well, I hate you
times infinity, Lo'ak!

51
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,653
Penis face!

52
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,655
Hey! Hey!
That's enough.

53
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,823
Don't make me come over there.

54
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,368
He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

55
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,786
There he is.

56
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,790
There you go.
Go get it!

57
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:50,915
Yeah!

58
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,919
Hey, Neteyam,
the mighty fisherman.

59
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,420
<i>There you go. Good boy.</i>

60
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,009
Wow, that's a big one.

61
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,177
By the rocks.

62
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,513
Right where you said.

63
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,348
How tall is he?

64
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,350
- He's... that tall.
- He's tall!

65
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,726
<i>Goes by too fast.</i>

66
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,395
<i>Like a dream.</i>

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,398
- Kiri.
- Bro, come on.

68
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,566
Come on.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,651
Smile, <i>skxawng.</i>

70
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,070
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

71
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,533
<i>Like date night.</i>

72
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,410
<i>Time away from the kids.</i>

73
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,985
<i>But the thing about happiness...</i>

74
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,780
<i>it can vanish in a heartbeat.</i>

75
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,164
<i>A new star in the night.</i>

76
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,375
<i>It could only mean one thing.</i>

77
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,135
<i>Ships. Decelerating.</i>

78
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,771
<i>And Sky People returning.</i>

79
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,714
<i>Pulse 168.</i>

80
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,924
<i>Yeah, here it comes.</i>

81
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,092
<i>You're just fine.</i>

82
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,718
<i>Just lie still.</i>

83
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,220
<i>Stay calm.</i>

84
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,432
<i>Yep. Pupillary
reflex is good.</i>

85
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,725
<i>Get that out of his face.</i>

86
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,309
<i>Colonel...</i>

87
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,853
<i>can you hear me?</i>

88
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:22,979
Colonel?

89
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,192
You need to lie back down, sir.

90
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,782
<i>Sedate him!
Sedate him!</i>

91
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:34,991
Get outta here.

92
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,159
Go, go, go!

93
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,119
Get security!

94
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,287
- Grab him!
- Grab him!

95
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
Hold him!

96
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,248
Calm down!

97
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,416
Colonel, stand down!

98
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,375
Colonel...

99
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,126
it's me!

100
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,502
Corporal Wainfleet!

101
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,465
Lyle?

102
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,051
That you?

103
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,971
Yes, sir.
And Z Dog.

104
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,307
And Fike.

105
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,978
I'm all right.
Let me go.

106
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,771
I'm all right.

107
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,169
Well...

108
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,297
ain't this a bitch.

109
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,769
<i>Stand by. Two minutes to
Pandora insertion. Secure for Delta V.</i>

110
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,189
All right. Umbilical's clear.

111
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,608
Pulse ox 89.

112
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:54,821
<i>In case you haven't figured it
out yet, you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.</i>

113
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,616
<i>Only younger, taller, bluer...</i>

114
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,326
<i>and not nearly as good-lookin'.</i>

115
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,079
<i>In two hours, I fly a mission...</i>

116
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,956
<i>against the</i> Na'vi's <i>stronghold.</i>

117
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,877
<i>The powers that be thought it prudent
that I do this backup just in case.</i>

118
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,213
<i>And if you are
watchin' it, well...</i>

119
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,465
<i>it means that I did
get my ticket punched.</i>

120
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:16,677
<i>Hey, Parker...</i>

121
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,846
<i>just what the hell am I
supposed to say now?</i>

122
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,848
<i>Just remind him how this works.</i>

123
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,808
<i>Here.</i>

124
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,894
<i>So see this? This is all your
memories and your personality.</i>

125
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,497
<i>We're gonna send
this back to Earth...</i>

126
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,857
<i>where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.</i>

127
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,709
<i>We're gonna imprint
you with it, and then...</i>

128
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,359
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

129
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,111
<i>Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?</i>

130
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,236
<i>Hurry it up.
Hurry it up.</i>

131
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,197
<i>Anyway, the idea...</i>

132
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,118
<i>is to get the minds of the
saltiest on-world operators.</i>

133
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,496
<i>Yeah, like Corporal
Wainfleet over there...</i>

134
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,332
<i>and your humble narrator into...</i>

135
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,042
<i>recombinant bodies.</i>

136
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,336
<i>You're a recom now, Colonel...</i>

137
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,881
<i>loaded with my
memories and my charm.</i>

138
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,800
<i>What you won't
remember is my death...</i>

139
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,302
<i>because it
hasn't happened yet...</i>

140
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,012
<i>and it ain't gonna.</i>

141
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,597
<i>- Damn right.
- Hell yeah.</i>

142
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,307
<i>Well, whatever happened...</i>

143
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,561
<i>if you're any clone of mine, you'll
be lookin' for some payback.</i>

144
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,022
<i>And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.</i>

145
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:14,860
<i>Remember, kid...</i>

146
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,070
<i>a Marine can't be defeated.</i>

147
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:18,989
<i>Oh, you can kill us...</i>

148
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,533
<i>but we'll just regroup in hell.</i>

149
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:23,994
<i>Semper fi.</i>

150
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,982
Ground team, go!

151
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,204
Take this! Go!

152
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,627
Let's go. Two
minutes, people. Let's go.

153
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,884
Bro, we have got
to get down there.

154
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,094
No way!
Dad will skin us!

155
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,013
Come on.
Don't be a wuss.

156
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,555
Lo'ak!

157
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,016
Get back here, you...

158
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,312
Taking the whole case!

159
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,118
We're taking mags,
the RPGs, the stingers.

160
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,652
Bro, let's go. Come on!

161
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,028
Okay, let's go!

162
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:24,948
Move! Take that!

163
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,575
Take these weapons.

164
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Here, boy. Go!

165
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,121
You don't even
know how to use it.

166
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,916
Dad taught me.

167
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:42,882
Gunship's inbound!

168
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,725
Bro, come on!

169
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,237
Lo'ak, where are you?

170
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,362
Neteyam!

171
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,740
Easy, easy, you okay?

172
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,492
- Yeah.
- Where's your brother?

173
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,470
- That way.
- Where is he? Where?

174
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,245
Get outta here!

175
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,370
Go on!

176
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,206
Neteyam!

177
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,751
Oh, no.

178
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,463
Oh, no, no, no.

179
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,215
Oh, God.

180
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,471
Dad?

181
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,872
What are you doin' here, boy?
What the hell were you thinkin'?

182
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,562
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,439
I'm sorry, sir.

184
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,863
<i>We are not in Kansas anymore.</i>

185
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,699
We are going to Pandora.

186
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,993
Now...

187
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,955
I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

188
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,084
Why so blue?

189
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,007
For our sins in our past life...

190
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,049
we have been brought back...

191
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,468
<i>in the form of our enemy.</i>

192
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,556
<i>That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.</i>

193
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,975
<i>And with our training...</i>

194
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,894
that's a pretty potent mix.

195
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,980
Do we have a mission yet?

196
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,356
Indeed we do.

197
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,818
Our mission is to
hunt down and kill...

198
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,904
the leader of the
<i>Na'vi</i> insurgency.

199
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,908
The one they call <i>Toruk Makto.</i>

200
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,826
Jake Sully.

201
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:33,993
Yeah!

202
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,212
Attack, attack!

203
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,380
Got ya!

204
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,298
Tuk!

205
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,423
Come on!

206
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,051
I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

207
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,219
<i>Skxawng.</i>

208
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,386
No, seriously.

209
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,739
And the animals respect me more.

210
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,264
They don't think of me as human.

211
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,141
Wait.
You're human?

212
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,319
They're coming!

213
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:13,616
They're coming!

214
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,701
Kiri, Spider!

215
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,744
The war party's coming back!

216
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,163
Come on, come on.

217
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,705
Let's go, come on.

218
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,389
<i>- Mom!</i>
- Tuk...

219
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,099
- Mom.
- Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

220
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,434
Fall in.

221
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,481
You're supposed to be spotters.

222
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,316
You spot bogeys,
and you call 'em in.

223
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,526
From a distance!

224
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,778
Does any of this
sound familiar? Get here!

225
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,364
Jesus. I let you two
geniuses fly a mission...

226
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,199
and you disobey direct orders.

227
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,595
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded? Please?

228
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:58,704
My brother is wounded.

229
00:17:59,121 --> 00:17:59,872
It's fine.

230
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,707
<i>- Tuk, go with her. Go.</i>
- Dad.

231
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,792
Sir. I take
full responsibility.

232
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:04,626
Yeah, you do.

233
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,751
<i>That's right.</i>

234
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,338
'Cause you're the older
brother. You gotta act like it.

235
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,549
<i>MaJake.</i>

236
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,843
Your son is actually bleeding.

237
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,428
Mother,
it's fine. I...

238
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,515
Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

239
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,149
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

240
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,734
Yes, sir.

241
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,613
You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

242
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,157
<i>Now, see to the</i> ikran.
<i>All of 'em.</i>

243
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,200
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:37,910
And get that crap off your face.

245
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,837
Aw, want a kiss on the boo-boo?

246
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,005
- Give him this.
- Okay.

247
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,691
I would use <i>yalna</i> bark.

248
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,484
Here, drink.

249
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,508
Oh, you would?

250
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,135
And who is <i>Tsahik</i>?

251
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,845
You are, Grand... Move!

252
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,681
You are, Grandmother.
But <i>yalna</i> bark is better.

253
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,310
It stings less.

254
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,229
<i>Mighty Warrior.</i>

255
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,196
What?

256
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,867
Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

257
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,912
It is very hard on them.

258
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,831
I know.

259
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,169
You are very hard on them.

260
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,757
I'm their father.
It's my job.

261
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,386
This is not a squad.

262
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,054
It is a family.

263
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,817
I thought we'd lost them.

264
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,785
Hey, man.
How's it going?

265
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,910
Hey, Spider.

266
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,705
Your ass is mine.

267
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:05,872
I'm right here.

268
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,708
Avatars only...

269
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,833
go around!

270
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,126
Sorry.

271
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,838
Yeah. Those blue stripes
don't make you any bigger, bro.

272
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,132
Yeah, well, I can
still kick your ass.

273
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,636
Hell of a day.

274
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,804
Long run.

275
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,350
Real hysterical, guys.

276
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,935
You know what
really sucks though?

277
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,371
Is you can breathe
Earth air for hours...

278
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,981
and I can only breathe
your air for, like, 10 seconds.

279
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,525
Yeah, Monkey Boy,
that really sucks.

280
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,693
For you.

281
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,243
- Hi, Max.
- Hey, kids.

282
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,410
Hey. What's up, Max?

283
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,786
What's up, Norm?

284
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,502
Hi, Ma.

285
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,682
<i>Maybe I'm just losing it out here...</i>

286
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,601
<i>but I'm seeing real evidence...</i>

287
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:11,480
<i>of a systemic response on a global level.</i>

288
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,315
<i>I can't...</i>

289
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,528
<i>I won't use the term
"intelligence." It's...</i>

290
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,697
<i>maybe "awareness"
is a better word.</i>

291
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:25,536
<i>It's like the entire
biosphere of Pandora...</i>

292
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,037
<i>is aware...</i>

293
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,290
<i>and capable of this
cognitive response.</i>

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,377
<i>Oh, crap, I can't say that.</i>

295
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,379
<i>They'll crucify me.</i>

296
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,046
<i>I mean, I need to say...</i>

297
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,883
So who do you think
knocked her up?

298
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:41,885
Pretty sure it was Norm.

299
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,053
Totally.

300
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,515
You do not deserve to live.

301
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,043
No, no, no.
Think about it, right?

302
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,476
I mean, he's the teacher's pet.

303
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,283
He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

304
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,188
I would kill myself.

305
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,690
I would drink acid.

306
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,817
Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

307
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,236
Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

308
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:00,404
Hey.

309
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,614
See, I'm thinkin'...

310
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,492
their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

311
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:06,910
Gross!

312
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:07,828
Guys.

313
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,706
I mean, sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

314
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,420
Whatever.

315
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,338
Don't even remember him.

316
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:19,756
No, Spider.

317
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,717
- Dude.
- Spider...

318
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,554
You are not him.

319
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,764
<i>Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.</i>

320
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:09,973
<i>Do not stop.</i>

321
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,604
Masks off.

322
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,443
Sir...

323
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,945
this is the General.

324
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,206
General Ardmore.

325
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,583
Good to meet you, Colonel.

326
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,585
I've heard good things...

327
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,380
but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

328
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,588
Walk with me.

329
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,594
The new ops center is over here.

330
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,929
That just came online.

331
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,724
These Swarm Assemblers,
they can put up a building in six days.

332
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:57,521
We have done more here in a year
than in the previous 30 years.

333
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,108
We're not here to
run a mine, Colonel.

334
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,776
As On-World Commander...

335
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,695
I have been charged
with a greater mission.

336
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,285
Earth is dying.

337
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,789
Our task here is to
tame this frontier.

338
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,667
Nothing less than
to make Pandora...

339
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,043
the new home for humanity.

340
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,672
But before we can do that...

341
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,091
we need to pacify the hostiles.

342
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:32,014
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

343
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,558
His strikes are well-planned.

344
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,394
He's got tight coordination
between his ground and air assets.

345
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:42,274
His forces are hitting our
outlying sites. The mines, pipelines...

346
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,067
cutting off our supply chain.

347
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,820
And they hit a Maglev two days ago.

348
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,368
Any intel on Sully's...

349
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,620
base of operations?

350
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,038
Yeah.
Give me the mountains.

351
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,959
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

352
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,131
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

353
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,302
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

354
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,347
We only get 10 minutes
in enemy airspace...

355
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,890
they are all over us.

356
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:18,977
Colonel...

357
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:22,105
we believe your Blue Team will
be perceived as indigenous...

358
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,941
and will not trigger...

359
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:24,858
the immune response.

360
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,861
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

361
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:29,988
The hard way.

362
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:32,991
Outstanding.

363
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,382
<i>We're entering hostile airspace.</i>

364
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,175
Copy that.

365
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,187
- Bro!
- Go, Monkey Boy!

366
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,523
Guys, wait up!

367
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,895
Tuk!
Keep up!

368
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,897
Okay, okay.

369
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,398
Bro, why'd you bring her anyway?

370
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,108
She's such a cry baby.

371
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,736
She's all, "I'm telling."

372
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:51,653
"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield."

373
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,655
"I'll tell Mom if you
don't let me come."

374
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,990
Don't pick on her.

375
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:57,993
Come on.

376
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,621
Oh, sick!

377
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,290
Are there any
dead bodies up there?

378
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,209
<i>Bro, check it out.
Come on.</i>

379
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:50,629
No shit.

380
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,516
Kiri.

381
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:03,934
Kiri.

382
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:07,938
Kiri...

383
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,439
Kiri, hey.

384
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,607
Hey.

385
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,697
Are you okay?

386
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,033
I was doing that
thing again, wasn't I?

387
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,244
Yeah, you were.

388
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,079
Kiri!

389
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:26,290
- Kiri!
- Kiri, we have to get back.

390
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,457
All right, come on.

391
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:33,881
What is it?

392
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,884
We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

393
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,471
It's way too big for a human.

394
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,015
- Avatars?
- Maybe...

395
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,934
but they're for sure not ours.

396
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:48,687
What are you doing?

397
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,147
I'm tracking.

398
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,417
Watch your six.

399
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:14,546
Clear.

400
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Perimeter up.

401
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:33,982
Damn.

402
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,215
<i>We are never supposed to come here.</i>

403
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,134
Dad is going to ground you.

404
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:02,593
Can you stop?

405
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:03,636
For life.

406
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:05,873
Bro, we have got to
check this out.

407
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,181
Let's go.

408
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,576
Bro...

409
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,619
that's where your dad and my dad...

410
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,496
fought.

411
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,707
That's your dad's actual suit.

412
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,917
Holy shit.

413
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,587
Lyle, see if you can...

414
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,672
pull some data
off that dash cam.

415
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:41,633
That thing's deader
than shit, Colonel.

416
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,593
So were we.

417
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:43,718
All right.

418
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:45,387
I gotta call this in.

419
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:46,972
No, bro, we're gonna
get in trouble.

420
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:48,140
Let's go.

421
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:55,272
<i>Devil Dog, Devil Dog,
this is Eagle Eye, over.</i>

422
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,524
Eagle Eye.
Send your traffic.

423
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,984
I got eyes on some guys.

424
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:02,821
They look like avatars...

425
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,115
<i>but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.</i>

426
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,160
<i>There's six of them. Over.</i>

427
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,578
What's your pos?
Over.

428
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:13,165
We're at the old shack.

429
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,336
Who's "we"?

430
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,297
Me, Spider, Kiri...

431
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,091
and Tuk.

432
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,516
Son, you listen to
me very carefully.

433
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:31,683
You pull back right now.

434
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:32,808
Do not make a sound.

435
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,144
<i>You get the hell out of there.</i>

436
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,269
<i>Move! You copy?</i>

437
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,480
Yes, sir, moving out.

438
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,207
See, I told you!

439
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,231
Go, go.

440
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:39,816
Dad...

441
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,360
I know a quick way!

442
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,575
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

443
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,035
Kiri, stop.

444
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,328
Guys, come on.

445
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,655
It's almost eclipse, come on.

446
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:56,500
Put it down!
Down!

447
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,478
Put it down or I'll shoot you!

448
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:59,502
With me.

449
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:00,188
<i>Drop it!</i>

450
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,212
<i>Right now!</i>

451
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:04,383
{\an8}Do not move!
Put your hands up!

452
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:05,843
Spider.

453
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,053
Get 'em!
Get 'em!

454
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,596
Get over here! Come on!

455
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,306
Get down!

456
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,016
Stop fighting.

457
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:14,726
Don't move!

458
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:15,894
<i>Check 'em for weapons!</i>

459
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,521
Kiri!

460
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:21,251
Shut up.

461
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,275
Don't move.

462
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,069
What have we here?

463
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:34,997
Hey, Colonel...

464
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,122
check it out.

465
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:37,457
Four fingers.

466
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,126
We got a half-breed.

467
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,502
Shit...

468
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,343
Show me your fingers.

469
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,435
You're his, aren't you?

470
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,897
You're his, all right.

471
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:07,779
Where is he?

472
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:19,958
No!

473
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:22,730
Really?

474
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,296
You wanna play it this way?

475
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,215
Shut up!

476
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,470
Kiri!

477
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:32,595
No!
Stop!

478
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,223
Hey! Hey,
don't touch her!

479
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,224
Hey!

480
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,809
Don't hurt her, please.

481
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,271
Don't move.

482
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,273
What's your name, kid?

483
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,401
Spider...

484
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,152
Socorro.

485
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,205
Miles?

486
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,418
Nobody calls me that.

487
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,673
Well, I'll be damned...

488
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,760
Well, I figured they
sent you back to Earth.

489
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,054
They can't put
babies in cryo, dipshit.

490
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,063
What are we doin', boss?

491
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,277
Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

492
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,594
Blue One, Iron Sky,
send your traffic.

493
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,159
<i>We are standing by
for extract, over.</i>

494
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,036
Take us in.

495
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,038
Dragonfly comin' left...

496
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,581
<i>we are go for extract.</i>

497
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,083
<i>Be advised...</i>

498
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,769
we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

499
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:45,769
Let us go!

500
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:46,480
Shut up.

501
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:47,713
Sit tight, Blue One...

502
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:48,878
we're inbound to your pos.

503
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,632
That's bingo in ten.

504
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,842
<i>We're on the clock.</i>

505
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:55,971
- Sit!
- Come on, in the dirt!

506
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:57,323
- Feet up!
- Get down on the ground!

507
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:57,950
Lyle...

508
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:59,224
get me some audio on this.

509
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,452
Shut your mouth.

510
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,476
Don't look up!

511
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,353
That's Sully's woman.

512
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:06,899
She's an animal.

513
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,067
<i>Give it up, Quaritch.</i>

514
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,320
Sully.

515
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,905
<i>- It's all over.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

516
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,949
<i>Nothin's over
while I'm breathin'.</i>

517
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:18,827
<i>I kinda hoped you'd say that.</i>

518
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:37,416
No, no, you stay with the <i>ikran.</i>

519
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:38,597
But, Dad...

520
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:39,431
I'm a warrior like you.

521
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,182
I'm supposed to fight.

522
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:41,099
Neteyam.

523
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:43,018
I'm not gonna say it again.

524
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:45,729
Yes, sir.

525
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:09,962
Yeah, there's
nothin' after that.

526
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,748
<i>You want us to recover these remains?</i>

527
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,839
<i>Blue One, stand by ready.</i>

528
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,006
<i>We are three minutes out.</i>

529
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,884
Heads up, three minutes.

530
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:13,483
Watch our six.

531
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:03,783
Shut up!

532
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:19,715
Shut up!

533
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:22,511
Contact rear!

534
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:23,845
Contact rear!

535
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,183
Lo'ak!

536
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:30,393
Shit.

537
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:33,998
You little shit.

538
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:34,708
Lo'ak!

539
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:36,376
- Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
- Get back here!

540
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,401
Run!

541
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:38,985
Grab 'em!

542
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:46,785
Come on!

543
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:48,829
Cover!

544
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,667
Come on!

545
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,475
That you,
Mrs. Sully?

546
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,145
<i>I recognize your calling card.</i>

547
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,741
Why don't you come
on out, Mrs. Sully?

548
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,660
You and I, we got some...

549
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,829
<i>unfinished business.</i>

550
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,376
Demon!

551
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,505
I will kill you as many
times as I have to!

552
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,342
<i>I guess you and the Corporal
have been pretty...</i>

553
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,093
<i>busy, haven't you?</i>

554
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,179
<i>Dropped yourself a whole litter of...</i>

555
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,056
<i>half-breeds.</i>

556
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:58,981
<i>Na'vi!</i>

557
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:02,986
Go, go, go!

558
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:06,299
You okay?
You okay, boy?

559
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:07,323
Yeah.

560
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,117
Okay. With me.
Ready? Ready?

561
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:10,243
Yes, sir!

562
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:13,247
Move!

563
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:18,877
Come on!

564
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:28,595
Go, go, go!

565
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:30,722
Flank out. Get after 'em!

566
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,981
Spider?

567
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,402
Spider!

568
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:44,319
Kiri!

569
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:45,444
Spider.

570
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,281
Come! Come on.

571
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,616
Spider. He's
down there.

572
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,741
No.

573
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:56,748
Ma'am, we're at bingo.

574
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,375
Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

575
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,141
Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

576
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,261
<i>Blue One...</i>

577
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:10,012
<i>fall back.</i>

578
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:11,388
Fall back!

579
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:12,764
Fall back, fall back!

580
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,057
Move out! Move!

581
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:15,933
Move, move, move!

582
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:17,769
- Kiri!
- Spider!

583
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,062
Come, come.

584
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:19,789
No.

585
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:20,499
Come!

586
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:21,690
Go, go, go.
Come on. Let's go.

587
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:25,986
Hey. Hey, it's
okay. You hurt?

588
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,255
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm okay.

589
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,447
- Tuk, you hurt?
- Daddy!

590
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:49,718
Okay, we're clear.

591
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:50,904
We're clear.
Everyone okay?

592
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,387
- Mom!
- Tuk.

593
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:57,809
It's okay. It's
okay. We're okay.

594
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,978
Oh, thank you, Great
Mother. Thank you.

595
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:01,896
Thank you.

596
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,482
Where's Spider?

597
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:05,817
They took him.

598
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:07,903
They took him.

599
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,447
Okay. It's all
right, baby girl.

600
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:11,652
All right? He's
a tough kid.

601
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:13,534
All right.

602
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:16,578
He's gonna be okay.

603
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,706
We're all gonna be okay.

604
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:30,716
Goddamn!

605
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:31,759
Come on!

606
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,474
Let me out of here!

607
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:47,025
He's completely feral.

608
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:48,986
Thinks he's one of them.

609
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,575
<i>This thing.
This Quaritch.</i>

610
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:55,784
<i>Whatever he is...</i>

611
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:57,136
- What's going on?
<i>- He can walk right in here.</i>

612
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,704
<i>He can walk right
under Eywa's nose.</i>

613
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:01,015
<i>- This is our family. This is our home.
- This is about our family.</i>

614
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,374
<i>This is about our little ones.</i>

615
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,752
<i>I cannot. You cannot ask this.</i>

616
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,673
I cannot leave my People.

617
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:11,924
I will not.

618
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:13,302
He's hunting us.

619
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,305
He's targeting our family.

620
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,723
You cannot ask this!

621
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:21,018
The children. Everything they've
ever known. The forest.

622
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:22,603
This is our home!

623
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:23,937
He had our children.

624
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:25,731
He had 'em under his knife!

625
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,740
My father gave me...

626
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:37,075
this bow as he lay dying.

627
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:39,328
And he said protect the People.

628
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,247
You're <i>Toruk Makto!</i>

629
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,083
<i>This will protect the People!</i>

630
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:46,793
Quaritch has Spider.

631
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,128
And that kid knows everything.

632
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:49,588
<i>He knows our whole operation...</i>

633
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,073
<i>and he can lead
them right in here.</i>

634
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:54,259
If the People harbor
us, they will die.

635
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,012
Do you understand?

636
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:02,809
Look, I got nothing.

637
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:04,895
I got no plan...

638
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,857
But I can protect this family.

639
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:10,692
That I can do.

640
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,666
I know one thing.

641
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:29,837
Wherever we go...

642
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,755
this family is our fortress.

643
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,104
<i>Where is Jake Sully?</i>

644
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:48,397
I don't know!

645
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:51,441
We know that you know.

646
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:53,610
<i>I don't know!</i>

647
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:54,653
<i>Just form a picture...</i>

648
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:55,778
in your mind.

649
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,322
Is it one of the
floating mountains?

650
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,408
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

651
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,034
He's fighting us.
Give us a minute.

652
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,201
<i>I don't know!</i>

653
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,538
Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

654
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:06,999
<i>I don't know!</i>

655
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,835
<i>Look, I don't like this
any more than you do.</i>

656
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:12,397
Which clans would be harboring him?

657
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:13,107
<i>I don't know!</i>

658
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:14,464
You're gonna have to kill me!

659
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,134
Watch this.

660
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:18,844
You're peaking all
over the prefrontal.

661
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:20,053
It's not gonna stop...

662
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,299
until you give us something.

663
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,723
<i>Where is he?</i>

664
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:25,309
I don't know,
you butt holes! Okay?

665
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:26,727
I don't know!

666
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:42,492
General, let me try
the personal angle.

667
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,332
He's not your son.

668
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,031
Easy, tiger.

669
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:22,198
Easy.

670
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:31,959
We good?

671
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,716
Kid, you got heart.

672
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,178
<i>Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.</i>

673
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:45,889
But you gave them nothin'.

674
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:49,142
I respect that.

675
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:56,692
I thought you might want this.

676
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:06,660
That's Colonel Miles Quaritch.

677
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:08,453
Deceased.

678
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:10,289
Killed in action.

679
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,379
I'm not that man.

680
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:22,509
But I do have his memories...

681
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:27,055
<i>enough to know that...</i>

682
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,202
well, he wasn't
always the best father.

683
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,520
But that's not an apology.

684
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,065
I'm not your father. Technically...

685
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:39,776
you and I, we're
nothin' to each other.

686
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,236
But...

687
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:43,530
I can help you.

688
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,033
I can get you outta here.

689
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:52,289
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

690
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:54,499
I know you'd never
do that. You're loyal...

691
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:57,419
and I admire loyalty.

692
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,215
Just ride along.

693
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:06,720
Otherwise, I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

694
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,731
<i>This is like stones in my heart.</i>

695
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:22,277
<i>Tarsem is wise for his years.</i>

696
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,196
<i>He will be a strong</i> Olo'eyktan.

697
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,033
<i>The leader must die.</i>

698
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:34,164
<i>So the leader can be born.</i>

699
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,378
Toruk Makto <i>will disappear.</i>

700
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,423
<i>The People will be safe.</i>

701
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:11,952
<i>A father protects.</i>

702
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:14,913
<i>It's what gives him meaning.</i>

703
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:20,669
<i>One life ends.</i>

704
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,172
<i>Another begins.</i>

705
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,270
Tuk.

706
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,193
<i>The sea clans are a
world unto themselves.</i>

707
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:46,945
<i>Thousands of islands.</i>

708
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:51,700
<i>An unknown territory into which
we could just vanish without a trace.</i>

709
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:54,161
Are we there yet?

710
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,018
Hey...

711
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,061
leave it.

712
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:04,565
On me.

713
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:07,734
Tuk.

714
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:10,237
Be nice.

715
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,239
Be nice.

716
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:14,783
Hey.

717
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:34,678
Easy.
Just be cool.

718
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,555
Look.
What is that?

719
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,640
Is that supposed to be a tail?

720
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,284
It's too small.

721
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:58,595
How are they supposed to swim?

722
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,996
Do not.
Rotxo, Aonung.

723
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:04,708
Hey.

724
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:32,194
<i>Tonowari was the chief
of the</i> Metkayina...

725
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:33,737
<i>the Reef People.</i>

726
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:35,948
I See you, Tonowari.

727
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:38,200
Jakesully.

728
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,701
<i>I knew him as a tough leader.</i>

729
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,375
<i>But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.</i>

730
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:52,339
I See you, Ronal.

731
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:53,799
<i>Tsahik</i> of the <i>Metkayina.</i>

732
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:55,133
<i>I See you, Ronal.</i>

733
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:59,388
Why do you come
to us, Jakesully?

734
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:01,765
We seek <i>uturu.</i>

735
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,561
Yes, sanctuary for my family.

736
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,399
We are Reef People.

737
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:11,566
You are Forest People.

738
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,277
Your skills will
mean nothing here.

739
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:16,321
Well, we will learn
your ways. Am I right?

740
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,489
Yes.

741
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:22,202
Their arms are thin.

742
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,037
Mom.

743
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,162
Their tails...

744
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:26,623
are weak.

745
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:28,375
You will be slow in the water.

746
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:32,921
These children...

747
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,923
- are not even true <i>Na'vi.</i>
- Dad.

748
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,093
Yes, we are!

749
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:43,056
They have demon blood!

750
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:49,354
Look. Look.

751
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,516
Look, I was born of the Sky
People, and now I am <i>Na'vi.</i>

752
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:54,860
All right?
You can adapt.

753
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:56,695
We will adapt.

754
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:57,945
Okay?

755
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:01,033
My husband was <i>Toruk Makto.</i>

756
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,910
He led the clans to...

757
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,997
victory against the Sky People.

758
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:11,960
This you call victory?

759
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,796
Hiding among strangers?

760
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,887
It seems Eywa has
turned her back on you...

761
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,012
Chosen One.

762
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,729
I apologize for
my mate. She's...

763
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:32,314
Do not apologize for me.

764
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:33,666
...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

765
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,690
Jake.

766
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,366
<i>Toruk Makto</i> is a
great war leader.

767
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,869
All <i>Na'vi</i> people know his story.

768
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,412
But we <i>Metkayina...</i>

769
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:48,997
- Dad.
- ...are not at war.

770
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:54,628
We cannot let you
bring your war here.

771
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,672
I'm done with war.

772
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:57,840
Okay?

773
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:00,342
I just want to keep
my family safe.

774
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:06,849
<i>Uturu</i> has been asked.

775
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:12,896
<i>Do we have to go?</i>

776
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:14,690
We'll be okay.

777
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,913
<i>Toruk Makto</i> and his
family will stay with us.

778
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:33,458
Treat them as our
brothers and sisters.

779
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:36,753
Now, they do not know the sea.

780
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:39,381
So they will be like babies...

781
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:41,049
taking their...

782
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:42,176
<i>first breath.</i>

783
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:47,055
Teach them our ways, so they
do not suffer the shame of being...

784
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,515
useless.

785
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:51,435
Okay, what do we say?

786
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,644
Thank you.

787
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:53,769
<i>Thank you.</i>

788
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,022
Thank you.

789
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:59,234
My son, Aonung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

790
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,236
- Father, why do...
- It is decided.

791
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:04,781
Come. I will show
you our village.

792
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:16,335
This way.

793
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:21,215
Tuk, let's go.

794
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:22,758
Just up here.

795
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,643
This is for you.

796
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:34,394
Your new home.

797
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:36,772
Yeah, this will work.

798
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:38,857
This is great.

799
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:40,025
It's nice, right?

800
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,706
Okay, Sullys, fall in.

801
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:55,666
Remember?

802
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:56,625
Family meeting.

803
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:57,936
<i>Come on. Take
a knee. Let's go.</i>

804
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,960
Kiri.

805
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,254
What?

806
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,005
<i>Okay.</i>

807
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:03,841
I need you kids

808
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:05,634
on your best behavior.

809
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,302
I mean it.

810
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:08,929
Learn fast.
Pull your weight.

811
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:12,266
Don't cause trouble.
You got it?

812
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:13,684
Yes, sir.

813
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:17,896
I want to go home.

814
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:21,483
Oh, Tuk.

815
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,487
Tuk, this is our home now.

816
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:30,284
Now we're gonna
get through this.

817
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:31,511
We're gonna get through this

818
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,370
if we have each
other's backs. All right?

819
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:35,539
What does your
father always say?

820
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,584
Sullys stick together.

821
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,961
<i>That's right.
Sullys stick together.</i>

822
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:42,754
Now this time with some feeling.

823
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:44,256
Yeah.

824
00:57:44,423 --> 00:57:45,215
Sullys stick together.

825
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:46,675
Sullys stick together.

826
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:48,594
Sullys stick together.

827
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:00,189
Come on.

828
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:33,675
Are you all right?

829
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:34,510
You're too fast!

830
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:36,178
Wait for us.

831
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:38,180
Just breathe.

832
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:39,305
Breathe.

833
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:40,557
You are not good divers.

834
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:43,519
Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

835
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:45,103
Come on, bro.

836
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:47,272
We don't speak this
finger talk, guys.

837
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:48,677
We don't know
what you're saying.

838
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:49,858
I will teach you.

839
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,360
<i>- Where is Kiri?
- Kiri?</i>

840
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:52,528
- Who?
- Kiri.

841
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:53,695
Where is Kiri?

842
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,113
<i>Did you see her?</i>

843
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,209
Get on the ship...

844
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:08,877
find a seat, and
keep out of the way.

845
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:11,546
Let's go!

846
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:13,256
Chop-chop.

847
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,340
Sweet.

848
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,802
Whoa, hold on there, hotshot!

849
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,012
You listen up.

850
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,474
There's a tracker
built in that mask.

851
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:24,643
We hit the ground,
and you take off...

852
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,979
I'll have you back
in two minutes...

853
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:29,731
and I will give you a
old-school ass-whippin'.

854
01:01:29,898 --> 01:01:30,899
Understood?

855
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:33,151
Understood?

856
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:34,820
Yes, sir.

857
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:36,196
We up?

858
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:37,364
Team's up.

859
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,046
All right, listen up.

860
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:56,633
Jake Sully's gone to ground.

861
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:58,135
Don't matter.

862
01:01:58,302 --> 01:01:59,678
Wherever he is,
we'll find him...

863
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:02,598
and his bat shit
crazy wife, too.

864
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,475
To do so...

865
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:07,853
we go <i>Na'vi</i>.

866
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,354
Full tilt, all the way.

867
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:10,124
That means we...

868
01:02:10,148 --> 01:02:13,775
eat <i>Na'vi.</i>
We ride <i>Na'vi.</i>

869
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:15,777
Think <i>Na'vi.</i>

870
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:32,628
All right, smart guy.

871
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:35,964
You just went from bein'
our monkey mascot...

872
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:37,716
to official interpreter.

873
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:46,475
These are <i>ilu.</i>

874
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:48,519
If you want to live here...

875
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:49,937
you have to ride.

876
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:52,272
Make the bond gently.

877
01:02:57,778 --> 01:02:59,488
Feel his breath.

878
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:01,114
<i>Feel his strength.</i>

879
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,326
Hold here.

880
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:08,038
Hold on.

881
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:28,433
<i>You all right...</i>

882
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,601
<i>Forest Boy?</i>

883
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,154
This is a warrior's mount.

884
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:42,656
Not easy to master.

885
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:45,325
Perhaps you should...

886
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:46,535
start with an <i>ilu.</i>

887
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:48,161
Nah.
This one.

888
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:52,749
<i>Now remember...</i>

889
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,544
when you dive back
in, good position.

890
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:56,712
Very important.

891
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,341
I got this.

892
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,286
That's it, okay.

893
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:31,496
Steady.

894
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,262
Ah, shit.

895
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,753
I love her already.

896
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:00,961
Breathe in.

897
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:05,799
And breathe out.

898
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:09,052
Imagine flickering a flame.

899
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:14,141
You must slow down
your heartbeat.

900
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:16,685
Breathe in.

901
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:20,147
Breathe from down here.

902
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:23,609
Breathe out slowly.

903
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:28,322
Lo'ak, your heartbeat is fast.

904
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:30,115
- Sorry.
- Try to focus.

905
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:31,742
- Okay.
- Breathe in.

906
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,495
<i>And breathe out.</i>

907
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:37,206
<i>Let your mind go clear.</i>

908
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:58,143
You are learning to breathe.

909
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:05,609
Come on!
Keep up, losers!

910
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:21,166
I got this.

911
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,091
What?

912
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:32,052
<i>Na'vi</i> kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

913
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:36,306
Jake Sully did it the hard way?

914
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,225
What do you think?

915
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,855
What are we doin', Colonel?

916
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:48,944
This is gonna be good.

917
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:53,532
All right, move up.

918
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:02,499
It's you and me, cupcake.

919
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:18,335
Did I mention you're
supposed to tie the mouth shut first?

920
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:20,600
Thanks a lot, kid!

921
01:08:25,564 --> 01:08:26,564
Move up, move up!

922
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:35,698
You see 'em?

923
01:08:58,013 --> 01:08:59,723
All right, let's go.
We're Oscar Mike.

924
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:00,848
Come on.

925
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:05,062
Let's go.
We're outta here.

926
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:12,152
Yeah!

927
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:13,737
That's right!

928
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:17,908
Yeah, Colonel!
Get some!

929
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:19,075
Yeah, Colonel!

930
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:20,452
Who's up next?

931
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:32,756
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

932
01:09:37,426 --> 01:09:39,470
<i>The sea is around you...</i>

933
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:41,055
<i>and in you.</i>

934
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:49,857
<i>The sea is your home...</i>

935
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:52,276
<i>before your birth...</i>

936
01:09:53,234 --> 01:09:55,070
<i>and after your death.</i>

937
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:04,371
<i>Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.</i>

938
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:11,170
<i>Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.</i>

939
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:14,339
<i>The sea gives...</i>

940
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:17,509
<i>and the sea takes.</i>

941
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:23,432
<i>Water connects all things.</i>

942
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,436
<i>Life to death.</i>

943
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:30,606
<i>Darkness...</i>

944
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:33,274
<i>to light.</i>

945
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:36,235
I got it!

946
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:38,112
You did it!

947
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:42,219
What is she doing?

948
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:43,971
<i>I don't know.</i>

949
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:45,722
She's just looking at the sand.

950
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:49,601
What'd you say?

951
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:52,604
Are you some
kind of... freak?

952
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:54,898
He asked if you are a freak.

953
01:11:58,277 --> 01:11:59,277
No.

954
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:00,821
Are you sure?

955
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:02,531
I mean, you're
not even real <i>Na'vi.</i>

956
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,575
Look at these hands.

957
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:05,993
I mean, look at them...

958
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:07,828
Hey!

959
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:09,705
Back off, fish lips!

960
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:12,124
Oh, another four-fingered freak.

961
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,458
Look at his little baby tail!

962
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:14,626
Don't touch me!

963
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:15,377
Baby tail!

964
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:16,712
Leave us alone!

965
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:18,129
He's not normal.

966
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:19,173
<i>Look at his tail.</i>

967
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:20,048
Aw, baby tail!

968
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:21,466
It is so cute!

969
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:24,011
You heard what she said.

970
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,180
Leave them alone.

971
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,806
Ah, big brother come...

972
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:30,392
Back off.

973
01:12:31,518 --> 01:12:32,686
Now.

974
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:39,902
Smart choice.

975
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:41,737
And from now on...

976
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:43,906
I need you to respect my sister.

977
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:49,285
<i>Let's go.</i>

978
01:12:52,164 --> 01:12:53,582
Buh-bye!

979
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:54,917
Look at them.

980
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,084
They're all freaks.

981
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:57,252
The whole family.

982
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:00,547
Lo'ak.

983
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:01,715
I got this, bro.

984
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:06,803
I know this hand is funny.

985
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,556
Look, I'm a freak.
An alien.

986
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,726
But it can do
something really cool.

987
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:13,894
Watch.

988
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:16,396
First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

989
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:17,689
Okay? Then...

990
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:22,982
It's called a punch, bitch!

991
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,446
Don't ever touch
my sister again.

992
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:27,658
Yeah! Aonung!
Show him!

993
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,661
Come here!

994
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,871
Hey!
Hey!

995
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:38,669
<i>Stop this!</i>

996
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:40,587
Stop it!

997
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,966
So stupid!

998
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:48,345
Ow, my tail!

999
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:52,391
My ear!
Let go!

1000
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,893
<i>He's got my ear!</i>

1001
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,608
What was the one thing I asked?

1002
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:02,359
The one thing!

1003
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:03,837
- Stay out of trouble.
- Stay out of trouble.

1004
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:04,901
- Right.
- It was my fault.

1005
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:05,696
I don't think so.

1006
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,549
You gotta stop takin' the
heat for this knucklehead.

1007
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:09,324
Look, Dad. Aonung
was picking on Kiri.

1008
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,034
He called her a freak.

1009
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:16,331
Go apologize to Aonung.

1010
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:17,874
What?

1011
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,877
<i>He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?</i>

1012
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,676
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.

1013
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,006
Just go.

1014
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:30,179
Hey.

1015
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:33,499
So what'd the
other guys look like?

1016
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:35,350
Worse.

1017
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:37,019
That's good.

1018
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:38,604
A lot worse.

1019
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:40,105
Get outta here.

1020
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,784
What is wrong?

1021
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:56,580
Nothing. I'm fine.

1022
01:14:57,748 --> 01:14:59,583
Why should I not be fine?

1023
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,259
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

1024
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,638
Oh, Kiri.

1025
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:18,560
Ah, what's tree boy doing here?

1026
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:22,940
I'm sorry I hit you.

1027
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:24,983
So many times.

1028
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,991
We should be friends.

1029
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:36,620
Come hunting with us.

1030
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:38,455
Outside the reef.

1031
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,791
It's where the men hunt.

1032
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:42,960
No way.
I'm not allowed.

1033
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:45,963
I must be asking
the wrong brother.

1034
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,130
Let's do it.

1035
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:04,648
Come on! Come on!

1036
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:06,608
Yeah!

1037
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:15,993
Keep up, Forest Boy!

1038
01:16:17,536 --> 01:16:18,536
Yeah!

1039
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,801
Hey, you lived!

1040
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:34,887
That was insane, cuz!

1041
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:37,055
This way.

1042
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:38,181
I know a good spot.

1043
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:31,527
Hey, guys!

1044
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:33,278
Hey!

1045
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:36,865
Aonung!

1046
01:17:38,408 --> 01:17:39,785
Come on, this isn't funny!

1047
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:52,965
Hey, Aonung!

1048
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:28,888
Holy shit.

1049
01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,211
You're a <i>tulkun.</i>

1050
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,007
You saved my life.

1051
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:05,676
Thank you.

1052
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:08,095
Thank you.

1053
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:16,937
Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

1054
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:25,529
They hurt you, didn't they?

1055
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:29,157
I'll try to pull it out.

1056
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:31,827
Just trust me, okay?

1057
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:07,905
Friends?

1058
01:23:11,533 --> 01:23:13,785
That's right, we're
friends. Friends.

1059
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:19,624
Bro!

1060
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,030
So, what is it, baby girl?

1061
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:15,490
You missin' Spider?

1062
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:19,912
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1063
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:22,289
But that's not it.

1064
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:25,833
Okay...

1065
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:28,670
So what is it?

1066
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,215
I feel her, Dad.

1067
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:34,885
You feel who?

1068
01:25:35,636 --> 01:25:36,637
Eywa.

1069
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:42,851
I hear her breathing.

1070
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:45,729
I hear her heartbeat.

1071
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:48,565
She's so close.

1072
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:52,027
She's just there...

1073
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:55,781
like a word about to be spoken.

1074
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:03,580
I know you think I'm crazy.

1075
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,335
You're not crazy, baby girl.

1076
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:15,092
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

1077
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,473
Mighty.

1078
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,649
Tell him what you told me!

1079
01:26:36,446 --> 01:26:38,031
You like lookin' at the stars?

1080
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:43,120
You know, my dad
came from a star.

1081
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:45,663
That one.

1082
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:46,747
Right there.

1083
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:50,919
Lo'ak!

1084
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:52,671
Oh, man.
I'm in trouble.

1085
01:26:55,591 --> 01:26:56,300
Go.

1086
01:26:56,425 --> 01:26:57,426
I will see you again.

1087
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:18,155
- The boy has returned!
- It is the Sully boy.

1088
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,823
- They found the boy.
- They found him.

1089
01:27:25,495 --> 01:27:26,496
Hey, hey.

1090
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:30,032
Let's have a
look at you. Okay.

1091
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:32,812
<i>He's fine.
He's fine...</i>

1092
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:33,522
yeah.

1093
01:27:33,546 --> 01:27:34,922
Just a few scratches.

1094
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,569
I pray for the strength
that I will not...

1095
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:41,512
pluck the eyeballs out
of my youngest son!

1096
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,181
<i>No.</i>

1097
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,226
My son knows better
than to take him outside the reef.

1098
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:51,396
The blame is his.

1099
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:54,107
Okay, let's go.

1100
01:27:54,608 --> 01:27:55,609
No.

1101
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:57,277
This is not Aonung's fault.

1102
01:27:58,028 --> 01:27:59,279
<i>This was my idea.</i>

1103
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:00,948
Aonung tried to
talk me out of it.

1104
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:02,908
Really.

1105
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:04,575
<i>Come on.</i>

1106
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:06,870
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1107
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:08,621
Come on.

1108
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:12,584
I got this.

1109
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:17,381
Is this true?

1110
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:19,550
Aonung. What
were you thinking?

1111
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:24,763
Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

1112
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:26,908
- That's all I was trying to...
- I don't want to hear it.

1113
01:28:26,932 --> 01:28:27,933
Dad...

1114
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,601
You brought shame
to this family.

1115
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:34,022
Can I go now?

1116
01:28:34,565 --> 01:28:36,292
Any more trouble, I
jerk a knot in your tail.

1117
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:37,442
You read me?

1118
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:39,903
Yes, sir.
Lima Charlie.

1119
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:51,832
Where were you?

1120
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:52,999
Yeah.

1121
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:54,960
What happened to "keep
an eye on your brother"?

1122
01:28:55,627 --> 01:28:56,628
Sorry, sir.

1123
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:02,843
Why did you speak for me?

1124
01:29:03,552 --> 01:29:04,832
Because I know what it's like...

1125
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,305
to be one big disappointment.

1126
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:11,810
I wish I'd been there.

1127
01:29:11,977 --> 01:29:13,896
The ocean blessed
you with a gift, brother.

1128
01:29:14,563 --> 01:29:16,899
The <i>tulkun</i> have not returned yet.

1129
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,026
And anyway, no <i>tulkun</i> is ever alone.

1130
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:20,903
Well, this one was.

1131
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:23,655
He had a missing fin.

1132
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:24,822
Like a stump.

1133
01:29:24,865 --> 01:29:25,467
On the left side.

1134
01:29:25,491 --> 01:29:26,700
Poor <i>tulkun.</i>

1135
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:28,410
Payakan.

1136
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:31,412
Who's Payakan?

1137
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,749
A young bull who went rogue.

1138
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:35,501
He's outcast. Alone.

1139
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:37,169
And he has a missing fin.

1140
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:38,837
They say he is a killer.

1141
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:40,881
- No, no.
- He killed <i>Na'vi...</i>

1142
01:29:41,006 --> 01:29:42,925
and other <i>tulkun.</i>

1143
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:45,260
Not here...

1144
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:46,178
but far to the south.

1145
01:29:46,345 --> 01:29:47,345
No, he's no killer.

1146
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,557
You are lucky to be alive.

1147
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:52,059
I'm telling you guys.

1148
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:53,268
He saved my life.

1149
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:55,062
He's my friend.

1150
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:56,855
My baby bro!

1151
01:29:57,022 --> 01:29:58,065
The Mighty Warrior...

1152
01:29:58,649 --> 01:29:59,834
who faced the killer <i>tulkun...</i>

1153
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:01,138
and lived to tell about it, huh?

1154
01:30:03,195 --> 01:30:04,279
You guys aren't listening.

1155
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:08,283
<i>- Lo'ak, I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back.</i>

1156
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,743
<i>You</i> skxawngs.

1157
01:30:10,869 --> 01:30:11,869
Payakan!

1158
01:30:13,956 --> 01:30:14,956
Payakan!

1159
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:18,417
Payakan!

1160
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:28,135
It's good to see you.

1161
01:30:31,473 --> 01:30:33,100
Why are you outcast?

1162
01:30:33,267 --> 01:30:34,268
What happened?

1163
01:30:39,982 --> 01:30:42,234
I trust you.

1164
01:30:42,943 --> 01:30:45,070
You can trust me.

1165
01:31:30,866 --> 01:31:32,075
Bro, that's disgusting!

1166
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,910
We are here.

1167
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:23,669
This is the Cove
of the Ancestors.

1168
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:25,379
Our most sacred place.

1169
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:35,430
<i>Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.</i>

1170
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:49,736
This is it.

1171
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,655
This is the Spirit Tree.

1172
01:33:58,555 --> 01:34:00,015
My beautiful daughter.

1173
01:34:01,517 --> 01:34:02,518
Hi, Ma.

1174
01:34:03,477 --> 01:34:04,728
I'm so happy to see you.

1175
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:06,855
But you look troubled.

1176
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,321
My sweet girl.

1177
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:16,573
It will be okay.

1178
01:34:24,122 --> 01:34:25,290
What is it, baby?

1179
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,043
Why am I different?

1180
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:32,923
What does the Great
Mother want from me?

1181
01:34:36,552 --> 01:34:38,512
Who was my father?

1182
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:44,226
Oh, my darling.

1183
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:50,232
No!

1184
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:09,543
Come on.

1185
01:35:15,549 --> 01:35:16,884
What is wrong?
What is it?

1186
01:35:17,676 --> 01:35:18,760
It was a seizure.

1187
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:20,387
Is she breathing?

1188
01:35:20,888 --> 01:35:22,014
Is she breathing?

1189
01:35:25,559 --> 01:35:26,727
Get her to the village!

1190
01:35:26,852 --> 01:35:27,477
Hurry!

1191
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:28,854
Let's go!
Let's move!

1192
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:29,979
Tuk, come.

1193
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:46,079
- Hi!
- It's good to see you.

1194
01:35:46,246 --> 01:35:47,372
Let's get the gear.
Neteyam!

1195
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:48,582
Neteyam, keep them back!

1196
01:35:48,749 --> 01:35:49,541
How is she?

1197
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:50,834
She's still unconscious.

1198
01:35:51,793 --> 01:35:52,961
There's no bleed.

1199
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:54,171
There's no fracture.

1200
01:35:55,214 --> 01:35:56,798
No effects of hypoxia.

1201
01:35:56,965 --> 01:35:58,091
The brain looks good.

1202
01:36:02,763 --> 01:36:05,724
But we still have this interictal
activity right here in the prefrontal.

1203
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:07,684
- Okay.
- She's definitely had a seizure.

1204
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:10,103
- I think we can rule out toxins.
- So what is it?

1205
01:36:11,355 --> 01:36:12,898
I see that I am not needed here.

1206
01:36:13,565 --> 01:36:14,983
You are <i>Tsahik!</i>

1207
01:36:16,944 --> 01:36:18,237
Remove these things.

1208
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:20,072
Out!

1209
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:20,906
You have done nothing!

1210
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:22,713
Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

1211
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,887
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

1212
01:36:26,495 --> 01:36:27,496
Tuktirey.

1213
01:36:36,004 --> 01:36:39,216
She said that she can feel Eywa.
She can hear her heartbeat.

1214
01:36:39,383 --> 01:36:40,509
- That's it.
- What?

1215
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:42,886
That is classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

1216
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:44,513
- Epilepsy?
- Yep.

1217
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,723
You see visions.
You get...

1218
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:49,226
states of religious ecstasy
like the kind she's describing.

1219
01:36:57,442 --> 01:37:00,863
Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

1220
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:02,823
You definitely can't let
her do that anymore.

1221
01:37:05,075 --> 01:37:06,118
What? Ever?

1222
01:37:06,285 --> 01:37:07,286
Jake.

1223
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:09,663
If she seizes
underwater again...

1224
01:37:10,414 --> 01:37:11,623
it could kill her.

1225
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:25,012
You're awake!

1226
01:37:34,021 --> 01:37:35,522
Kiri, my sweet child.

1227
01:37:36,356 --> 01:37:37,900
Oh, my sweet little girl.

1228
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:39,651
Okay, this one.

1229
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:40,776
"I See you."

1230
01:37:47,075 --> 01:37:48,395
That's what I
just said, isn't it?

1231
01:37:50,495 --> 01:37:52,956
Not <i>"Naati. Ngaati."</i>

1232
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:56,335
All right. Like comin'
out your nose or something.

1233
01:37:57,252 --> 01:37:58,253
<i>Boss...</i>

1234
01:37:58,962 --> 01:38:00,839
long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

1235
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:02,299
A rogue gunship.

1236
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:04,301
Where?

1237
01:38:04,468 --> 01:38:06,053
<i>Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.</i>

1238
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:10,015
Hang on.

1239
01:38:12,643 --> 01:38:16,772
The signal was intermittent,
and they lost it over open water but...

1240
01:38:17,397 --> 01:38:18,857
if you project the track...

1241
01:38:20,192 --> 01:38:21,944
it hits this island group.

1242
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:24,988
That's hundreds of islands.

1243
01:38:25,155 --> 01:38:27,241
That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

1244
01:38:27,407 --> 01:38:28,492
This is our guy.

1245
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:32,412
You give me ships and aircraft,
I'll bring you back his scalp.

1246
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:45,592
Bogies inbound.

1247
01:38:45,717 --> 01:38:46,717
Skipper.

1248
01:38:54,768 --> 01:38:56,311
- All stop.
- All stop.

1249
01:38:56,478 --> 01:38:57,729
All stop. Aye.

1250
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:17,708
Hey.

1251
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:19,418
You Scoresby?

1252
01:39:20,794 --> 01:39:23,714
Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

1253
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:25,465
That would be me.

1254
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:30,053
The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

1255
01:39:30,846 --> 01:39:32,014
Never been up there.

1256
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:35,684
You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

1257
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:39,813
<i>Metkayina,</i> mostly. Some
<i>Ta'unui.</i> Maybe fifty villages.

1258
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,398
And you are who?

1259
01:39:42,524 --> 01:39:43,817
I'm Ian Garvin.

1260
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:46,528
Marine biologist.

1261
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:47,905
Fifty villages.

1262
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:50,240
A hundred villages.
I don't care. We'll search 'em all.

1263
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:52,701
I hunt <i>tulkun.</i>

1264
01:39:53,368 --> 01:39:55,704
That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

1265
01:39:55,871 --> 01:39:57,456
I've got quotas to meet.

1266
01:39:58,624 --> 01:40:00,542
I'll be nice once.

1267
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:02,252
Then I won't.

1268
01:40:05,506 --> 01:40:06,965
Well, if you can't
get out of it...

1269
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:09,176
get into it!

1270
01:40:10,052 --> 01:40:12,471
- All crews to stations!
- Hey, don't touch.

1271
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:15,599
<i>Helm, bring her up.</i>

1272
01:40:15,724 --> 01:40:16,517
Flight speed.

1273
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:17,976
Flight speed, aye.

1274
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:30,030
What was that?

1275
01:40:31,281 --> 01:40:32,281
What's going on?

1276
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:37,329
The <i>tulkun</i> have returned!

1277
01:40:37,496 --> 01:40:40,541
Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

1278
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:52,970
<i>In their endless cycle of migration...</i>

1279
01:40:53,262 --> 01:40:55,180
<i>the</i> tulkun <i>had come home.</i>

1280
01:41:02,521 --> 01:41:03,939
Kiri, come on. Come on!

1281
01:41:04,106 --> 01:41:05,399
Tuk, leave me alone.

1282
01:41:05,524 --> 01:41:06,775
- Come on!
- What?

1283
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,653
What do you want?

1284
01:41:09,987 --> 01:41:10,987
Look.

1285
01:41:19,746 --> 01:41:20,746
<i>Come on.</i>

1286
01:41:21,665 --> 01:41:22,791
Let's go meet them.

1287
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,209
Look...

1288
01:41:24,334 --> 01:41:25,669
it's my Spirit Sister.

1289
01:42:48,877 --> 01:42:50,462
<i>It was a time for stories.</i>

1290
01:42:51,672 --> 01:42:52,923
<i>Of their season apart.</i>

1291
01:42:53,757 --> 01:42:54,424
<i>Of deaths...</i>

1292
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:55,550
<i>and births.</i>

1293
01:42:57,636 --> 01:42:58,679
<i>Of old friends...</i>

1294
01:42:58,804 --> 01:42:59,804
<i>and new loves.</i>

1295
01:43:19,867 --> 01:43:20,867
Children.

1296
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:24,496
Be calm...

1297
01:43:24,621 --> 01:43:25,664
my people.

1298
01:43:26,123 --> 01:43:27,499
We're looking for weapons...

1299
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:29,585
comms. Any kind of tech.

1300
01:43:30,085 --> 01:43:30,752
Get down.

1301
01:43:30,919 --> 01:43:31,712
You too.

1302
01:43:31,837 --> 01:43:32,837
You see this?

1303
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:34,798
Stay down and shut up!

1304
01:43:51,648 --> 01:43:52,691
Now what's he saying?

1305
01:43:52,858 --> 01:43:53,901
They never saw him.

1306
01:43:54,026 --> 01:43:54,902
These are Sea People.

1307
01:43:55,027 --> 01:43:56,570
Forest People don't come here.

1308
01:43:56,695 --> 01:43:58,238
I ain't buyin' that.

1309
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:11,668
They don't know anything.

1310
01:44:14,505 --> 01:44:15,506
Shoot that animal.

1311
01:44:19,593 --> 01:44:20,713
What the hell are you doing?

1312
01:44:32,314 --> 01:44:33,524
{\an8}Your ears workin' now?

1313
01:44:34,566 --> 01:44:36,318
You see what these can do, huh?

1314
01:44:38,612 --> 01:44:39,780
Jake Sully.

1315
01:44:40,822 --> 01:44:43,367
<i>Toruk Makto!</i>

1316
01:44:45,077 --> 01:44:46,077
Put her down!

1317
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:47,161
Get down!

1318
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:49,872
Get down!

1319
01:44:50,082 --> 01:44:50,958
Stop!

1320
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:51,750
Stop!

1321
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,627
You make it real clear to him.

1322
01:44:54,211 --> 01:44:55,337
He doesn't give up Sully...

1323
01:44:56,088 --> 01:44:57,381
<i>we kill the</i> Tsahik.

1324
01:44:57,548 --> 01:44:58,882
No, I'm not doin' that.

1325
01:44:59,049 --> 01:45:00,049
Is that right?

1326
01:45:00,634 --> 01:45:02,302
I'm not gonna be a part of this!

1327
01:45:03,011 --> 01:45:03,637
Get down!

1328
01:45:03,804 --> 01:45:05,222
These people don't
know anything!

1329
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:06,598
They don't know anything!

1330
01:45:06,765 --> 01:45:07,933
Don't move!

1331
01:45:12,396 --> 01:45:13,436
We really gonna waste her?

1332
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:15,524
<i>Please.</i>

1333
01:45:15,691 --> 01:45:17,067
Please don't do this.

1334
01:45:17,192 --> 01:45:18,026
This is wrong.

1335
01:45:18,193 --> 01:45:20,279
<i>What you're doing here is wrong.</i>

1336
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:22,530
<i>Please.</i>

1337
01:45:27,578 --> 01:45:28,787
Burn the hooches.

1338
01:45:29,788 --> 01:45:31,290
Hey, light 'em up.

1339
01:45:31,456 --> 01:45:32,916
Light 'em up. All of 'em!

1340
01:45:33,417 --> 01:45:34,543
<i>Flamethrowers up!</i>

1341
01:45:52,019 --> 01:45:53,395
I'm sorry.

1342
01:45:53,562 --> 01:45:54,730
We're outta here.

1343
01:45:56,481 --> 01:45:57,608
Don't touch me!

1344
01:45:58,317 --> 01:45:58,942
I'm sorry.

1345
01:45:59,109 --> 01:46:00,110
Let's go.

1346
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:01,153
Saddle up.

1347
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:02,278
All right. Let's go.

1348
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:27,971
What's wrong?

1349
01:46:28,138 --> 01:46:29,348
Sky People.

1350
01:46:30,974 --> 01:46:32,809
They're looking
for you, Jakesully.

1351
01:46:33,352 --> 01:46:34,352
South.

1352
01:46:34,436 --> 01:46:35,187
They have a human...

1353
01:46:35,312 --> 01:46:37,231
boy who speaks <i>Na'vi.</i>

1354
01:46:41,235 --> 01:46:42,736
Did they kill anybody?

1355
01:46:43,445 --> 01:46:44,821
Not yet.

1356
01:46:46,114 --> 01:46:47,199
<i>They threaten.</i>

1357
01:46:47,616 --> 01:46:50,077
But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

1358
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,495
By my order.

1359
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:01,880
We must hunt this demon.

1360
01:47:02,047 --> 01:47:03,090
Trap him.

1361
01:47:03,257 --> 01:47:04,257
Kill him.

1362
01:47:05,884 --> 01:47:06,969
We've gotta be smart.

1363
01:47:07,761 --> 01:47:08,762
We gotta be smart.

1364
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:09,763
If we hit Quaritch...

1365
01:47:09,888 --> 01:47:11,849
they're gonna
know where we are...

1366
01:47:12,015 --> 01:47:14,226
and they're gonna come
here with everything they've got.

1367
01:47:15,644 --> 01:47:16,979
Then what is our plan?

1368
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:19,940
That's <i>Toruk Makto!</i>

1369
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:21,190
Head down.

1370
01:47:21,817 --> 01:47:23,026
Has he been here?

1371
01:47:27,823 --> 01:47:29,032
This shit ain't workin'.

1372
01:47:29,867 --> 01:47:31,159
Nah, they're stonewallin' us.

1373
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:33,370
If we turn up the heat...

1374
01:47:33,495 --> 01:47:34,955
he's just gonna keep runnin'.

1375
01:47:35,247 --> 01:47:36,748
We gotta draw him out.

1376
01:47:46,175 --> 01:47:47,259
I'm over it.

1377
01:47:48,468 --> 01:47:50,637
I've got quotas to meet.

1378
01:47:50,804 --> 01:47:52,389
You wanna hunt?

1379
01:47:52,764 --> 01:47:54,016
Let's hunt.

1380
01:47:55,475 --> 01:47:56,310
<i>Here? Not here.</i>

1381
01:47:56,435 --> 01:47:57,728
There's too many villages.

1382
01:47:57,853 --> 01:47:59,313
No.
No, no, no.

1383
01:48:00,606 --> 01:48:01,815
Respectfully, sir...

1384
01:48:02,482 --> 01:48:03,482
you do not understand...

1385
01:48:03,609 --> 01:48:04,484
the kinship bonds...

1386
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:06,361
between the <i>tulkun</i>
and the ocean <i>Na'vi.</i>

1387
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,697
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

1388
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:10,157
If we start hunting here...

1389
01:48:10,282 --> 01:48:12,409
the hostiles will come after us.

1390
01:48:12,576 --> 01:48:13,702
Exactly.

1391
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:15,329
One hostile...

1392
01:48:15,454 --> 01:48:16,538
<i>in particular.</i>

1393
01:48:26,798 --> 01:48:28,467
I know how you feel.

1394
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:34,181
I feel all alone too.

1395
01:48:36,141 --> 01:48:37,434
Tell me.

1396
01:48:37,601 --> 01:48:39,228
<i>Why are you outcast?</i>

1397
01:51:02,621 --> 01:51:03,956
I'm sorry.

1398
01:51:04,122 --> 01:51:05,582
I'm so sorry.

1399
01:51:09,586 --> 01:51:10,587
It's okay.

1400
01:51:11,255 --> 01:51:12,255
It's okay.

1401
01:51:26,728 --> 01:51:28,313
You allowed this.

1402
01:51:29,731 --> 01:51:33,110
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast!

1403
01:51:35,863 --> 01:51:36,864
Tsireya.

1404
01:51:38,657 --> 01:51:40,284
You disappoint me, daughter.

1405
01:51:41,577 --> 01:51:42,828
<i>And you...</i>

1406
01:51:42,995 --> 01:51:44,329
son of a great warrior...

1407
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:45,956
<i>who has been taught better.</i>

1408
01:51:46,123 --> 01:51:47,708
Payakan saved my life, sir.

1409
01:51:47,875 --> 01:51:48,875
You don't know him.

1410
01:51:48,959 --> 01:51:50,294
No, Lo'ak.

1411
01:51:51,378 --> 01:51:52,379
Sit.

1412
01:51:53,797 --> 01:51:55,048
Sit.

1413
01:51:57,926 --> 01:51:59,303
Sit down!

1414
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:04,892
Hear my words, boy.

1415
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:09,188
In the days of
the First Songs...

1416
01:52:09,563 --> 01:52:11,982
<i>tulkun</i> fought
amongst themselves...

1417
01:52:12,107 --> 01:52:14,151
for territory...

1418
01:52:14,318 --> 01:52:15,652
<i>and for revenge.</i>

1419
01:52:16,653 --> 01:52:18,530
But they came to believe...

1420
01:52:18,697 --> 01:52:21,283
that killing, no
matter how justified...

1421
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:24,119
only brings more killing.

1422
01:52:25,954 --> 01:52:29,249
So all killing was forbidden.

1423
01:52:29,416 --> 01:52:32,211
This is the <i>Tulkun</i> Way.

1424
01:52:33,462 --> 01:52:34,463
Payakan...

1425
01:52:35,339 --> 01:52:37,484
<i>is a killer, so...</i>

1426
01:52:37,508 --> 01:52:39,551
he is outcast.

1427
01:52:39,718 --> 01:52:40,719
I'm sorry, sir.

1428
01:52:40,844 --> 01:52:41,637
But you're wrong.

1429
01:52:41,803 --> 01:52:42,803
Lo'ak.

1430
01:52:43,639 --> 01:52:44,681
You speak to <i>Olo'eyktan!</i>

1431
01:52:44,848 --> 01:52:45,618
I know what I...

1432
01:52:45,642 --> 01:52:46,725
That's enough!

1433
01:52:51,063 --> 01:52:52,147
I know what I know.

1434
01:52:55,651 --> 01:52:56,902
That's enough.

1435
01:52:58,695 --> 01:53:00,447
I'll deal with this one.

1436
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,080
This storm will pass.

1437
01:53:09,623 --> 01:53:13,669
Lo'ak, I saw something today.

1438
01:53:13,836 --> 01:53:15,462
I saw a Forest Boy...

1439
01:53:15,587 --> 01:53:16,880
chosen by <i>tulkun.</i>

1440
01:53:17,798 --> 01:53:20,342
I am very proud of you.

1441
01:53:20,509 --> 01:53:22,302
Payakan didn't kill those boys.

1442
01:53:23,095 --> 01:53:24,096
I saw it all.

1443
01:53:24,263 --> 01:53:26,974
The demon ship killed his
mother right in front of him.

1444
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,260
He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

1445
01:53:29,309 --> 01:53:30,519
to attack the ship.

1446
01:53:31,186 --> 01:53:33,105
And they were all killed...

1447
01:53:33,564 --> 01:53:35,482
but by the Sky
People. Not by him.

1448
01:53:35,649 --> 01:53:37,484
- He's not a killer.
- No, Lo'ak.

1449
01:53:37,651 --> 01:53:39,987
By the <i>Tulkun</i> Way, he is.

1450
01:53:40,153 --> 01:53:41,238
He bears those deaths.

1451
01:53:41,405 --> 01:53:43,782
Does he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

1452
01:53:43,949 --> 01:53:46,326
He knows what he did was wrong.
He would never do it again.

1453
01:53:48,078 --> 01:53:49,138
We must tell my father...

1454
01:53:49,162 --> 01:53:50,139
No. No.

1455
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:51,641
I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

1456
01:53:51,665 --> 01:53:52,945
Your father will
understand this.

1457
01:53:53,041 --> 01:53:54,041
No, he won't.

1458
01:53:54,543 --> 01:53:56,461
He doesn't understand anything.

1459
01:53:56,628 --> 01:53:58,255
The whole clan hates me.

1460
01:53:58,422 --> 01:53:59,631
Demon blood.

1461
01:53:59,798 --> 01:54:01,633
Alien.
That's all they see.

1462
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,641
I See you.

1463
01:54:13,896 --> 01:54:16,481
You are Brother of <i>Tulkun.</i>

1464
01:54:18,734 --> 01:54:20,694
You are one of us now.

1465
01:54:37,878 --> 01:54:38,879
<i>You got my mother?</i>

1466
01:54:39,046 --> 01:54:41,840
Mother and calf. Strong
signal. Range 4,000.

1467
01:54:42,007 --> 01:54:42,799
Bring it down...

1468
01:54:42,925 --> 01:54:43,634
on the hull.

1469
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,260
Comin' down, aye.

1470
01:54:45,427 --> 01:54:46,428
Foils deployed.

1471
01:55:08,742 --> 01:55:09,535
<i>Sub teams...</i>

1472
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:10,304
two minutes!

1473
01:55:10,328 --> 01:55:11,912
Let's get in there!

1474
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:14,081
Hatches closed!

1475
01:55:14,248 --> 01:55:15,123
Come on, hustle!

1476
01:55:15,249 --> 01:55:16,249
Hustle!

1477
01:55:16,333 --> 01:55:18,210
Crews to their boats.
Two minutes.

1478
01:55:18,377 --> 01:55:19,628
Let's make some bank.

1479
01:55:20,796 --> 01:55:22,089
Boat crews!

1480
01:55:22,256 --> 01:55:24,842
Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

1481
01:55:30,138 --> 01:55:31,974
All boats in! Boats in!

1482
01:55:36,603 --> 01:55:38,063
Let's go, baby!

1483
01:55:48,949 --> 01:55:50,158
We're rollin'!

1484
01:56:16,518 --> 01:56:17,978
Stand by depth charges...

1485
01:56:18,145 --> 01:56:20,147
and fire, fire, fire!

1486
01:56:42,544 --> 01:56:43,397
What's that?

1487
01:56:43,421 --> 01:56:44,421
What are they doin'?

1488
01:56:45,714 --> 01:56:47,424
Those are echolocation sensors.

1489
01:56:47,591 --> 01:56:48,926
How they navigate.

1490
01:56:49,092 --> 01:56:50,093
They have to hold...

1491
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:50,844
them out of the water...

1492
01:56:51,011 --> 01:56:52,095
or they'll go deaf.

1493
01:56:53,096 --> 01:56:54,097
Picadors!

1494
01:56:54,473 --> 01:56:55,158
Get in there!

1495
01:56:55,182 --> 01:56:55,867
Go on.

1496
01:56:55,891 --> 01:56:56,577
Get in there.

1497
01:56:56,601 --> 01:56:57,643
Get up in there!

1498
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:15,911
They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod...

1499
01:57:16,078 --> 01:57:17,746
<i>using the sound cannon.</i>

1500
01:57:17,913 --> 01:57:20,016
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly...

1501
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,918
and she won't leave the calf.

1502
01:57:23,335 --> 01:57:24,962
Do they ever fight back?

1503
01:57:25,128 --> 01:57:27,506
Nah, never seen 'em lift a fin.

1504
01:57:28,131 --> 01:57:30,050
Tough bastards to kill though.

1505
01:57:31,343 --> 01:57:32,928
Sub teams, go!

1506
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:34,470
And release.

1507
01:57:38,475 --> 01:57:40,185
Release, release.

1508
01:57:44,982 --> 01:57:45,983
There's our gal.

1509
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:47,150
Target in sight.

1510
01:57:47,651 --> 01:57:49,111
3-6 is in hot with harpoons.

1511
01:57:49,278 --> 01:57:50,445
Here we go, baby.

1512
01:57:51,905 --> 01:57:53,866
See, we go in from below...

1513
01:57:53,991 --> 01:57:55,826
where there's gaps in the armor.

1514
01:57:59,705 --> 01:58:01,290
All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

1515
01:58:01,456 --> 01:58:02,457
I'm goin' in.

1516
01:58:02,624 --> 01:58:03,917
Get me in close.

1517
01:58:07,462 --> 01:58:08,463
<i>Hold her steady.</i>

1518
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:10,174
<i>In range.
Arm one.</i>

1519
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:12,009
Arming, target lock.

1520
01:58:12,176 --> 01:58:13,302
And one away.

1521
01:58:19,641 --> 01:58:21,059
<i>Two's in hot.</i>

1522
01:58:21,226 --> 01:58:22,227
<i>- Arm one.
- Arming.</i>

1523
01:58:22,394 --> 01:58:23,437
Fire.

1524
01:58:27,608 --> 01:58:28,543
Good strike.
Arm two.

1525
01:58:28,567 --> 01:58:29,253
Arming.

1526
01:58:29,277 --> 01:58:30,402
Two away.

1527
01:58:31,695 --> 01:58:32,696
Booyah!

1528
01:58:32,863 --> 01:58:33,863
<i>Nice.</i>

1529
01:58:33,947 --> 01:58:35,574
3-6, you owe us a beer.

1530
01:58:40,370 --> 01:58:42,414
You see, the bags
slow her down...

1531
01:58:42,539 --> 01:58:43,790
and keep her up at the surface.

1532
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:44,958
Yeah.

1533
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:46,251
Get on her!

1534
01:58:46,418 --> 01:58:47,711
<i>Get me in there.</i>

1535
01:58:47,878 --> 01:58:49,254
Straight up on her.

1536
01:58:49,505 --> 01:58:50,506
30 meters.

1537
01:58:51,381 --> 01:58:52,966
Explosive-tipped harpoon.

1538
01:58:53,509 --> 01:58:56,178
Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

1539
01:58:56,678 --> 01:58:57,822
Now steady, steady.

1540
01:58:57,846 --> 01:58:58,972
Stay with her.

1541
01:58:59,306 --> 01:59:00,891
Hold. Hold.

1542
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,269
Line's runnin'!

1543
01:59:11,109 --> 01:59:13,237
Hold on to your
ponytail, Colonel!

1544
01:59:24,164 --> 01:59:25,249
Hold back full!

1545
01:59:25,415 --> 01:59:26,750
Back full, aye.

1546
01:59:33,423 --> 01:59:34,591
Hold her.

1547
01:59:34,758 --> 01:59:35,884
Hold her.

1548
01:59:39,179 --> 01:59:41,849
She takes an explosive
harpoon to the chest...

1549
01:59:41,974 --> 01:59:43,392
and she's still runnin'.

1550
01:59:44,309 --> 01:59:45,936
Beautiful.

1551
02:00:59,801 --> 02:01:02,596
The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

1552
02:01:02,763 --> 02:01:04,973
We drill up through
the hard palate...

1553
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:07,893
into the brain. And...

1554
02:01:11,688 --> 02:01:13,941
These are highly
intelligent beings.

1555
02:01:14,107 --> 02:01:15,107
Probably smarter than us.

1556
02:01:15,234 --> 02:01:16,485
Not smarter than me.

1557
02:01:16,652 --> 02:01:18,111
That is setting
the bar very low.

1558
02:01:18,278 --> 02:01:19,821
Hey, I'm the one
with the harpoon.

1559
02:01:21,406 --> 02:01:22,407
Yep.

1560
02:01:33,502 --> 02:01:34,503
How do you know?

1561
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:35,921
That they're smarter than us?

1562
02:01:36,755 --> 02:01:38,423
More neurons, more pathways.

1563
02:01:39,299 --> 02:01:41,468
Not only are they
smarter, they're...

1564
02:01:41,593 --> 02:01:42,845
deeply emotional.

1565
02:01:43,762 --> 02:01:45,013
More spiritual.

1566
02:01:49,351 --> 02:01:52,271
See, this region here corresponds
with our emotional centers...

1567
02:01:52,437 --> 02:01:54,898
but proportionally
it's much larger.

1568
02:01:56,275 --> 02:01:57,818
They have music...

1569
02:01:57,985 --> 02:01:59,528
philosophy...

1570
02:01:59,695 --> 02:02:01,280
mathematics...

1571
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:03,115
complex language.

1572
02:02:03,699 --> 02:02:04,699
Okay.

1573
02:02:05,117 --> 02:02:06,243
Here we go.

1574
02:02:07,035 --> 02:02:08,412
Show me the money.

1575
02:02:13,125 --> 02:02:15,127
So that's what this is all about?

1576
02:02:15,752 --> 02:02:17,087
That's it.

1577
02:02:17,254 --> 02:02:18,255
Amrita.

1578
02:02:21,175 --> 02:02:23,093
Bad luck for the big guys.

1579
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:26,513
This stuff just happens to
stop human aging. Like...

1580
02:02:27,097 --> 02:02:28,473
stops it.

1581
02:02:30,976 --> 02:02:33,187
<i>Ounce for ounce the
single most valuable...</i>

1582
02:02:33,312 --> 02:02:35,272
substance known to man.

1583
02:02:36,982 --> 02:02:38,984
This little vial
here is worth like...

1584
02:02:40,152 --> 02:02:41,403
80 million.

1585
02:02:42,446 --> 02:02:43,446
Think fast!

1586
02:02:44,656 --> 02:02:45,824
Please don't.

1587
02:02:47,075 --> 02:02:48,075
<i>It's never funny.</i>

1588
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:52,164
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

1589
02:02:53,123 --> 02:02:55,542
Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

1590
02:02:55,709 --> 02:02:57,002
It's why I drink.

1591
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:00,506
That's all you take?

1592
02:03:01,798 --> 02:03:03,842
I mean, you just waste the rest?

1593
02:03:05,385 --> 02:03:06,970
Drop the bags.

1594
02:03:07,554 --> 02:03:08,722
Let's sink her!

1595
02:03:08,889 --> 02:03:10,974
No. Leave
the bags.

1596
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:13,143
I want 'em to know it was us.

1597
02:03:13,810 --> 02:03:17,189
I charge extra for
bein' used as bait.

1598
02:03:51,473 --> 02:03:53,976
Her name is Ro'a.

1599
02:03:56,353 --> 02:03:59,189
She was my Spirit Sister.

1600
02:04:01,567 --> 02:04:04,319
She was a composer of songs.

1601
02:04:04,486 --> 02:04:05,779
Much revered.

1602
02:04:05,946 --> 02:04:07,197
We would sing together.

1603
02:04:08,866 --> 02:04:12,536
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

1604
02:04:13,036 --> 02:04:15,289
<i>The clan were so happy for her.</i>

1605
02:04:18,417 --> 02:04:20,335
What is this, Tonowari?

1606
02:04:23,088 --> 02:04:24,756
What is this?

1607
02:04:44,318 --> 02:04:47,237
My Spirit Sister and her baby...

1608
02:04:47,404 --> 02:04:49,948
have been murdered
by the Sky People!

1609
02:04:51,283 --> 02:04:53,493
<i>This war has come to us.</i>

1610
02:04:54,328 --> 02:04:55,871
<i>We knew about this hunting...</i>

1611
02:04:55,996 --> 02:04:57,748
<i>of our</i> tulkun <i>people.</i>

1612
02:04:57,915 --> 02:04:59,291
But it was over the horizon...

1613
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:00,834
far away.

1614
02:05:01,001 --> 02:05:02,794
Now it is here!

1615
02:05:06,548 --> 02:05:07,549
<i>No, you don't...</i>

1616
02:05:07,716 --> 02:05:09,843
<i>You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.</i>

1617
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:11,720
They don't care
about the Great Balance.

1618
02:05:11,887 --> 02:05:13,430
We don't answer to Sky People!

1619
02:05:13,597 --> 02:05:15,432
Listen. Listen to him.

1620
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:16,868
The Sky People
are not gonna stop.

1621
02:05:16,892 --> 02:05:17,952
This is only the beginning.

1622
02:05:17,976 --> 02:05:20,020
You gotta tell
your <i>tulkun</i> to leave.

1623
02:05:21,188 --> 02:05:23,190
You gotta tell them
to go far away!

1624
02:05:23,524 --> 02:05:24,524
Leave?

1625
02:05:25,943 --> 02:05:27,152
You live among us...

1626
02:05:28,278 --> 02:05:30,072
and you learn nothing!

1627
02:05:30,197 --> 02:05:33,367
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

1628
02:05:33,534 --> 02:05:34,701
No, no, no.

1629
02:05:36,328 --> 02:05:37,412
If you attack...

1630
02:05:37,579 --> 02:05:39,289
if you fight...

1631
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,791
then they will destroy you!

1632
02:05:40,958 --> 02:05:41,750
They will destroy...

1633
02:05:41,875 --> 02:05:42,918
everything that you love.

1634
02:05:43,877 --> 02:05:44,545
No!

1635
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:45,838
<i>You hear my words!</i>

1636
02:05:46,463 --> 02:05:47,464
Hear my words!

1637
02:05:47,631 --> 02:05:48,632
Stay calm.

1638
02:05:48,799 --> 02:05:49,799
<i>Stay calm!</i>

1639
02:05:50,342 --> 02:05:51,343
<i>Listen to my father.</i>

1640
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:52,344
Damn it!

1641
02:05:52,511 --> 02:05:53,762
He speaks the truth.

1642
02:06:03,772 --> 02:06:05,107
You tell the <i>tulkun...</i>

1643
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:08,380
that if they're hit
by one of these...

1644
02:06:08,485 --> 02:06:09,653
they're marked for death.

1645
02:06:12,739 --> 02:06:13,615
<i>And call for me...</i>

1646
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:14,950
I'll silence it.

1647
02:06:17,619 --> 02:06:19,538
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

1648
02:06:20,581 --> 02:06:21,915
<i>Right?</i>

1649
02:06:24,418 --> 02:06:26,128
Saving your family.

1650
02:06:38,974 --> 02:06:40,184
Tell the <i>tulkun</i>.

1651
02:06:41,476 --> 02:06:42,477
Go.

1652
02:06:42,895 --> 02:06:43,979
<i>Go!</i>

1653
02:06:47,608 --> 02:06:49,276
We must fight.

1654
02:06:50,402 --> 02:06:51,987
<i>MaJake.</i>

1655
02:06:52,154 --> 02:06:53,739
I will not stand and do nothing!

1656
02:06:54,573 --> 02:06:56,783
It's a trap. They
want us to hit back.

1657
02:06:57,534 --> 02:06:59,119
They're not hunting <i>tulkun</i>.

1658
02:06:59,286 --> 02:07:00,787
They're hunting us.

1659
02:07:15,344 --> 02:07:17,262
No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

1660
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:19,029
I have to warn Payakan
about the pingers.

1661
02:07:19,681 --> 02:07:20,390
No.

1662
02:07:20,557 --> 02:07:22,476
You've gotta keep
your <i>skxawng</i> ass here.

1663
02:07:22,643 --> 02:07:23,685
He's outcast.

1664
02:07:23,852 --> 02:07:25,604
There's nobody
to warn him but me.

1665
02:07:25,771 --> 02:07:26,771
Bro...

1666
02:07:27,814 --> 02:07:29,858
why do you always have
to make things so hard?

1667
02:07:31,443 --> 02:07:32,486
No.

1668
02:07:32,653 --> 02:07:35,239
You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

1669
02:07:36,615 --> 02:07:38,075
The perfect little soldier.

1670
02:07:38,867 --> 02:07:40,118
Well, I'm not you!

1671
02:07:40,786 --> 02:07:41,786
Okay?

1672
02:07:42,287 --> 02:07:43,287
I'm not you.

1673
02:07:44,456 --> 02:07:45,791
He's my brother.

1674
02:07:45,958 --> 02:07:47,000
I'm going.

1675
02:07:47,167 --> 02:07:48,544
He's your brother?

1676
02:07:49,711 --> 02:07:51,630
No, I'm your brother.

1677
02:07:51,797 --> 02:07:52,797
Lo'ak!

1678
02:07:53,215 --> 02:07:54,299
Get off me.

1679
02:07:55,509 --> 02:07:56,343
Lo'ak!

1680
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:57,177
Come back!

1681
02:07:57,302 --> 02:07:57,928
Come on.

1682
02:07:58,053 --> 02:07:59,096
He's going to Payakan.

1683
02:08:11,191 --> 02:08:12,317
Come back!

1684
02:08:13,485 --> 02:08:14,945
There's
Lo'ak! Lo'ak.

1685
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:16,363
Lo'ak!

1686
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:18,073
Lo'ak's going to find Payakan!

1687
02:08:18,532 --> 02:08:19,532
Wait up!

1688
02:08:21,034 --> 02:08:22,034
Hold on!

1689
02:08:31,128 --> 02:08:32,928
- All crews to stations.
- Sound general call.

1690
02:08:33,046 --> 02:08:35,215
All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

1691
02:08:44,099 --> 02:08:45,100
Brother!

1692
02:08:45,517 --> 02:08:46,517
Lo'ak!

1693
02:08:48,645 --> 02:08:49,247
Lo'ak!

1694
02:08:49,271 --> 02:08:50,271
Wait!

1695
02:08:53,275 --> 02:08:54,568
What is it?
What's wrong?

1696
02:08:56,570 --> 02:08:57,738
Shit!

1697
02:08:58,405 --> 02:09:00,324
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

1698
02:09:01,074 --> 02:09:02,326
I got this.

1699
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:09,790
Shit!

1700
02:09:13,962 --> 02:09:15,130
Bro, come on!
Help me out!

1701
02:09:15,797 --> 02:09:16,797
Hurry, the ship's coming!

1702
02:09:16,882 --> 02:09:17,882
They're over there!

1703
02:09:20,135 --> 02:09:21,386
Bro, come on!

1704
02:09:22,346 --> 02:09:23,639
Bro.

1705
02:09:23,805 --> 02:09:24,515
Come on, bro.

1706
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:25,265
Hurry!

1707
02:09:25,641 --> 02:09:26,683
Call it in!

1708
02:09:26,808 --> 02:09:27,808
Call Dad!

1709
02:09:28,268 --> 02:09:29,436
Call Dad!
Just go! Do it!

1710
02:09:29,603 --> 02:09:30,687
Just do it.

1711
02:09:31,522 --> 02:09:33,482
Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

1712
02:09:33,649 --> 02:09:34,816
Did you see where they went?

1713
02:09:34,942 --> 02:09:35,960
<i>It's Eagle Eye, do you copy?</i>

1714
02:09:35,984 --> 02:09:37,545
- They went outside the reef.
- Yeah, Lo'ak.

1715
02:09:37,569 --> 02:09:38,569
<i>Dad!</i>

1716
02:09:39,655 --> 02:09:41,949
We're with a <i>tulkun</i>
that's under attack.

1717
02:09:42,115 --> 02:09:43,200
Killer ship's inbound.

1718
02:09:43,367 --> 02:09:44,743
<i>It's about two klicks out.</i>

1719
02:09:45,369 --> 02:09:46,012
Who's with you?

1720
02:09:46,036 --> 02:09:46,745
<i>It's all of us.</i>

1721
02:09:46,954 --> 02:09:48,288
<i>Aonung and Tsireya too.</i>

1722
02:09:48,455 --> 02:09:49,831
We're at Three Brothers Rocks.

1723
02:09:49,998 --> 02:09:51,875
You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

1724
02:09:52,042 --> 02:09:53,042
All right? You hear me?

1725
02:09:53,085 --> 02:09:54,165
Do not engage.
We're comin'.

1726
02:09:54,294 --> 02:09:55,128
Yes, sir.

1727
02:09:55,295 --> 02:09:56,421
It's getting closer!

1728
02:09:56,547 --> 02:09:58,674
- Three, two, pull!
- Pull!

1729
02:09:59,633 --> 02:10:01,009
<i>Kids are under attack!</i>

1730
02:10:01,552 --> 02:10:03,613
The kids are under attack.
They were defending a <i>tulkun.</i>

1731
02:10:03,637 --> 02:10:04,888
<i>It's your kids too.</i>

1732
02:10:05,055 --> 02:10:06,098
The demon ship?

1733
02:10:06,265 --> 02:10:06,866
Yes!

1734
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:07,599
We gotta go!

1735
02:10:07,724 --> 02:10:09,434
Weapons.
Sound the alarm!

1736
02:10:13,647 --> 02:10:14,731
You should stay back.

1737
02:10:15,065 --> 02:10:16,065
I ride!

1738
02:10:16,275 --> 02:10:17,275
<i>Come!</i>

1739
02:11:06,366 --> 02:11:08,202
Sub teams, hatches close.

1740
02:11:08,368 --> 02:11:09,828
Two-minute warning.

1741
02:11:16,793 --> 02:11:17,794
Aonung!

1742
02:11:18,754 --> 02:11:19,796
Hurry up! Come on!

1743
02:11:19,963 --> 02:11:21,131
Bro, hurry up!

1744
02:11:23,592 --> 02:11:24,592
Go, go, go!

1745
02:11:28,514 --> 02:11:29,681
Pull! Now!

1746
02:11:31,642 --> 02:11:33,352
- Everybody! Together!
- Pull!

1747
02:11:37,189 --> 02:11:38,565
I'll be damned.

1748
02:11:39,816 --> 02:11:41,026
Sully's kids.

1749
02:11:41,485 --> 02:11:43,153
Let's roll.
Not you.

1750
02:11:43,737 --> 02:11:44,738
Saddle up.

1751
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,126
Range is 700 meters.

1752
02:11:58,293 --> 02:11:59,878
Pinger signal is good.

1753
02:12:01,755 --> 02:12:03,131
Pull, harder!

1754
02:12:03,298 --> 02:12:04,508
Pull!

1755
02:12:05,259 --> 02:12:06,593
Pull, harder!

1756
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:07,760
Go!

1757
02:12:08,178 --> 02:12:09,805
It's out!
Kiri, it's out!

1758
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:10,931
Go.
Tuk, go.

1759
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:13,058
Come on. Get out of here!

1760
02:12:13,225 --> 02:12:14,226
Go that way!

1761
02:12:14,351 --> 02:12:14,977
I'll draw them off.

1762
02:12:15,102 --> 02:12:16,436
- Okay.
- Lo'ak, come.

1763
02:12:18,105 --> 02:12:19,481
Go, go, dive!

1764
02:12:19,648 --> 02:12:21,066
Now, dive!

1765
02:12:21,191 --> 02:12:22,191
Grab on.

1766
02:12:31,869 --> 02:12:32,953
Range 300.

1767
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:34,830
Ready depth charges...

1768
02:12:34,997 --> 02:12:37,332
and fire, fire, fire.

1769
02:12:43,255 --> 02:12:44,631
No depth charges.

1770
02:12:44,756 --> 02:12:46,008
Scoresby, you copy?

1771
02:12:46,133 --> 02:12:47,759
These kids are
worthless to me dead.

1772
02:12:48,343 --> 02:12:49,761
Hold your fire.

1773
02:12:54,349 --> 02:12:57,102
Circle out. Get a cordon around 'em.

1774
02:12:57,269 --> 02:12:58,604
Get your subs in the water.

1775
02:12:59,521 --> 02:13:01,440
Sub teams, get wet.

1776
02:13:50,989 --> 02:13:52,991
Crabs flank right.
Get around on 'em.

1777
02:13:56,787 --> 02:13:58,080
Don't lose 'em.
Stay on 'em now.

1778
02:13:58,580 --> 02:13:59,665
Planes up. We're goin' in!

1779
02:13:59,831 --> 02:14:01,124
Oh, hell yeah!

1780
02:14:32,948 --> 02:14:34,700
Tone on lock.
Two away.

1781
02:15:04,313 --> 02:15:05,313
Where is Tuk?

1782
02:15:05,397 --> 02:15:06,397
Did you see her?

1783
02:15:22,915 --> 02:15:23,916
Tuk!

1784
02:15:26,543 --> 02:15:27,543
Target in sight.

1785
02:15:32,049 --> 02:15:33,258
It is coming.

1786
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:34,718
We gotta go!

1787
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:52,152
- Switch net.
- Switching.

1788
02:15:52,277 --> 02:15:53,277
Fire.

1789
02:16:13,507 --> 02:16:14,507
Hold on!

1790
02:16:14,633 --> 02:16:15,633
Let me out!

1791
02:16:16,134 --> 02:16:17,135
- Watch out!
- Tuk, move!

1792
02:16:17,302 --> 02:16:18,363
Move your hand! Move your hand!

1793
02:16:18,387 --> 02:16:20,138
<i>- Cut it!</i>
- Hurry, hurry!

1794
02:16:24,601 --> 02:16:26,186
Hey, kid, get back here!

1795
02:16:31,942 --> 02:16:32,567
Drop the weapon.

1796
02:16:32,692 --> 02:16:34,003
- Put the weapon down!
- Put it down.

1797
02:16:34,027 --> 02:16:35,027
<i>Put it down!</i>

1798
02:16:37,072 --> 02:16:38,072
Stay down.

1799
02:16:38,699 --> 02:16:40,575
- Hey, kid, get back here!
- Get him! Get him!

1800
02:16:40,825 --> 02:16:42,076
Put the weapon down!

1801
02:16:42,494 --> 02:16:43,494
Drop it, now!

1802
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:44,996
- Put it down!
- Drop the knife.

1803
02:16:45,163 --> 02:16:46,164
Drop it.

1804
02:16:46,748 --> 02:16:48,666
Hey! Hey, what are
you doing? Stop!

1805
02:16:48,834 --> 02:16:49,959
Stop.
Don't hurt them.

1806
02:16:51,545 --> 02:16:52,212
Stop moving.

1807
02:16:52,421 --> 02:16:54,423
- <i>Spider!</i>
- Bro, you okay?

1808
02:16:54,923 --> 02:16:56,174
Yeah. Great, cuz.

1809
02:16:56,341 --> 02:16:57,384
Never better.

1810
02:17:00,219 --> 02:17:01,221
Knock it off.
Stay still.

1811
02:17:04,183 --> 02:17:05,183
Get back to the bridge.

1812
02:17:06,809 --> 02:17:07,811
Keep him there!

1813
02:17:07,977 --> 02:17:09,396
I'm going, I'm going.

1814
02:17:10,564 --> 02:17:11,690
<i>Yeah.</i>

1815
02:17:11,857 --> 02:17:12,983
I remember you.

1816
02:17:14,151 --> 02:17:15,777
Cuff 'em to the
rail. All of 'em.

1817
02:17:15,903 --> 02:17:16,903
Let's go.

1818
02:17:17,571 --> 02:17:18,798
Let's go. Move!

1819
02:17:18,822 --> 02:17:19,592
Over here.

1820
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:20,699
Watch 'em.
They bite.

1821
02:17:21,867 --> 02:17:22,510
Get on your knees.

1822
02:17:22,534 --> 02:17:23,219
On 'em.

1823
02:17:23,243 --> 02:17:23,927
Give me your hand.

1824
02:17:23,951 --> 02:17:24,951
No!

1825
02:17:25,995 --> 02:17:26,621
Now the other.

1826
02:17:26,746 --> 02:17:27,748
No.

1827
02:17:31,709 --> 02:17:32,710
Be brave.

1828
02:17:37,382 --> 02:17:38,467
<i>Na'vi</i> inbound!

1829
02:17:40,928 --> 02:17:41,905
Spread out.
Weapons up.

1830
02:17:41,929 --> 02:17:42,638
Dad!

1831
02:17:42,763 --> 02:17:44,348
Push left.
Spread out.

1832
02:17:46,767 --> 02:17:47,768
Stop.
Stop them.

1833
02:17:51,897 --> 02:17:53,232
It's Sully.

1834
02:17:55,484 --> 02:17:56,485
300 yards.

1835
02:18:02,491 --> 02:18:03,825
They got our kids.

1836
02:18:03,992 --> 02:18:05,285
Your daughter.

1837
02:18:05,451 --> 02:18:06,452
Tuk. Lo'ak.

1838
02:18:09,456 --> 02:18:10,456
Jake...

1839
02:18:10,665 --> 02:18:12,793
tell your friends to stand down.

1840
02:18:13,919 --> 02:18:15,879
You want your kids back...

1841
02:18:16,046 --> 02:18:17,589
you come out alone.

1842
02:18:20,384 --> 02:18:22,511
You know better
than to test my resolve.

1843
02:18:23,846 --> 02:18:24,972
Lo'ak!
No!

1844
02:18:28,058 --> 02:18:30,018
<i>I took you under my wing, Jake.</i>

1845
02:18:30,561 --> 02:18:32,478
You betrayed me.

1846
02:18:32,646 --> 02:18:34,022
You killed your own.

1847
02:18:34,189 --> 02:18:36,023
Good men.
Good women.

1848
02:18:36,191 --> 02:18:39,278
I will not hesitate
to execute your kid.

1849
02:18:40,779 --> 02:18:41,780
Just wait one.

1850
02:18:53,125 --> 02:18:54,251
Hold here.

1851
02:18:55,252 --> 02:18:57,129
They are killers of <i>tulkun.</i>

1852
02:18:57,754 --> 02:18:58,964
They must die.

1853
02:18:59,130 --> 02:19:00,924
Here. Today.

1854
02:19:01,091 --> 02:19:02,718
It's me that they want.

1855
02:19:02,885 --> 02:19:04,529
That's what all this
has been about, all right?

1856
02:19:04,553 --> 02:19:06,972
The hunting of our <i>tulkun.</i>
The taking of our kids.

1857
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:12,019
You brought this upon us!

1858
02:19:12,477 --> 02:19:13,562
You!

1859
02:19:17,398 --> 02:19:19,151
Well, then it's me
that has to do this.

1860
02:19:25,406 --> 02:19:27,242
Offer's fixin' to expire.

1861
02:19:27,409 --> 02:19:28,951
What's it gonna be?

1862
02:19:29,702 --> 02:19:31,163
Check your fire.

1863
02:19:31,330 --> 02:19:32,496
I'm comin' out.

1864
02:19:43,592 --> 02:19:44,300
<i>MaJake...</i>

1865
02:19:44,425 --> 02:19:45,425
what is happening?

1866
02:19:46,136 --> 02:19:47,221
<i>MaJake?</i>

1867
02:19:49,890 --> 02:19:52,601
Stay tense everybody.
All weapons.

1868
02:20:09,952 --> 02:20:11,537
Easy shot.

1869
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:14,206
You hit him now, they attack.

1870
02:20:15,499 --> 02:20:17,459
Wait till he's on board.

1871
02:20:44,278 --> 02:20:45,654
Payakan!

1872
02:20:57,332 --> 02:20:58,332
Open fire.
Open fire!

1873
02:21:00,878 --> 02:21:01,878
Brother!

1874
02:21:06,633 --> 02:21:08,260
- Come about!
- Comin' about!

1875
02:21:08,385 --> 02:21:09,720
Get me around!

1876
02:21:10,512 --> 02:21:11,512
Get me a shot!

1877
02:21:12,472 --> 02:21:14,308
Go, go!

1878
02:21:32,993 --> 02:21:34,119
Get me around!

1879
02:21:34,286 --> 02:21:35,704
Go, go, go!

1880
02:21:37,497 --> 02:21:38,123
Get in there...

1881
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:40,125
get me in range.
Go, go, go.

1882
02:21:49,259 --> 02:21:50,259
Down!

1883
02:21:53,347 --> 02:21:54,848
Bloody hell!

1884
02:21:59,019 --> 02:22:00,019
Open fire!

1885
02:22:00,646 --> 02:22:01,646
Open fire!

1886
02:22:05,734 --> 02:22:06,944
Sully's inbound.

1887
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:08,320
I want eyes on!

1888
02:22:08,612 --> 02:22:10,531
All right, let's go.
Saddle up. We're up!

1889
02:22:52,489 --> 02:22:54,575
Somebody shoot something!

1890
02:23:10,299 --> 02:23:11,299
Stop!

1891
02:24:06,730 --> 02:24:07,981
Get after them. Go!

1892
02:24:25,207 --> 02:24:27,125
Breach!
Masks on!

1893
02:24:27,459 --> 02:24:28,877
Masks
on! Go!

1894
02:25:08,625 --> 02:25:09,960
Get him out of here!

1895
02:25:15,007 --> 02:25:16,008
Calm down!

1896
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:31,356
Go, go, go!

1897
02:25:44,912 --> 02:25:46,163
Damage report!

1898
02:25:46,330 --> 02:25:47,080
Flooding.

1899
02:25:47,206 --> 02:25:48,246
Compartment two and three.

1900
02:25:48,707 --> 02:25:49,707
You okay?

1901
02:26:19,196 --> 02:26:20,197
Port bow!

1902
02:26:21,323 --> 02:26:22,407
Hard port!

1903
02:26:22,533 --> 02:26:23,533
Open fire!

1904
02:26:24,243 --> 02:26:25,452
Get me a shot!

1905
02:26:26,495 --> 02:26:27,495
Got ya!

1906
02:26:45,013 --> 02:26:46,598
Cut us away!

1907
02:26:46,765 --> 02:26:47,850
Not responding!

1908
02:26:48,225 --> 02:26:50,018
Get us off the cable!

1909
02:26:50,185 --> 02:26:52,104
Who's got the harpoon now?

1910
02:26:56,567 --> 02:26:57,776
Back full!

1911
02:27:09,371 --> 02:27:10,497
Reload!

1912
02:27:13,750 --> 02:27:15,586
Not the cable, you idiot!

1913
02:27:16,837 --> 02:27:18,046
We're dead in the water.

1914
02:27:19,381 --> 02:27:20,966
Taking on water. Pumps on.

1915
02:27:21,717 --> 02:27:23,010
Man your weapons!

1916
02:27:23,177 --> 02:27:25,554
I thought you were the
intelligent species here, Scoresby.

1917
02:27:25,804 --> 02:27:27,264
Shut ya cake hole, Garvin.

1918
02:27:29,433 --> 02:27:30,642
Where are you?

1919
02:27:31,310 --> 02:27:32,644
Cheeky bugger.

1920
02:27:32,811 --> 02:27:34,730
You think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

1921
02:27:49,995 --> 02:27:51,079
Get down!

1922
02:28:03,217 --> 02:28:04,218
Pumps aren't working.

1923
02:28:04,384 --> 02:28:05,177
Abandon ship!

1924
02:28:05,302 --> 02:28:06,302
Abandon ship!

1925
02:28:06,345 --> 02:28:07,780
- Get him to a boat!
<i>- All crew to the boats.</i>

1926
02:28:07,804 --> 02:28:09,681
Let's go, people!
Let's move! Mask up!

1927
02:28:15,145 --> 02:28:16,438
Neteyam!

1928
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:18,065
Hey, baby brother.

1929
02:28:18,232 --> 02:28:19,316
Need some help?

1930
02:28:19,816 --> 02:28:20,859
Shut up. Come on.

1931
02:28:20,984 --> 02:28:21,984
Get us loose.

1932
02:28:24,863 --> 02:28:27,032
- Okay, get Tuk out of here.
- Bro, hurry up!

1933
02:28:28,825 --> 02:28:30,410
Who's the Mighty Warrior?
Come on.

1934
02:28:30,536 --> 02:28:31,536
Say it.

1935
02:28:31,954 --> 02:28:33,330
- Bro!
- Come on. Let's go.

1936
02:28:35,123 --> 02:28:36,166
Lo'ak!

1937
02:28:37,042 --> 02:28:38,043
They've got Spider.

1938
02:28:38,210 --> 02:28:39,920
We've gotta get him.
Come on.

1939
02:28:40,295 --> 02:28:41,296
Come on, bro.

1940
02:28:41,505 --> 02:28:42,714
We can't leave him.

1941
02:28:50,848 --> 02:28:51,890
Let me go!

1942
02:28:54,101 --> 02:28:55,310
No!

1943
02:28:57,479 --> 02:28:58,479
Look!

1944
02:29:05,153 --> 02:29:06,822
Let's go, buttercup.
Get up.

1945
02:29:06,989 --> 02:29:09,157
I'm not your buttercup, perv!

1946
02:29:09,324 --> 02:29:10,576
We've got to go back for her.

1947
02:29:11,702 --> 02:29:12,703
Tuk, wait!

1948
02:29:12,870 --> 02:29:14,413
Sullys stick together.

1949
02:29:26,133 --> 02:29:27,676
Wait right there, guys. Wait.

1950
02:29:28,677 --> 02:29:29,761
Clear to drop!

1951
02:29:31,138 --> 02:29:32,532
Check your mask.
Make sure it's tight.

1952
02:29:32,556 --> 02:29:33,682
I'm good, dumb-ass.

1953
02:29:36,852 --> 02:29:37,853
Move, move!

1954
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:39,188
Evacuating, people.

1955
02:29:43,442 --> 02:29:44,193
Tuk...

1956
02:29:44,443 --> 02:29:45,986
this is not a good idea.

1957
02:29:46,153 --> 02:29:47,153
Tuk!

1958
02:30:07,382 --> 02:30:08,382
Cut it here.

1959
02:30:11,512 --> 02:30:12,512
No!

1960
02:30:18,519 --> 02:30:19,520
I got her.

1961
02:30:26,151 --> 02:30:27,319
We can still get this done.

1962
02:30:27,486 --> 02:30:28,486
Hell yeah.

1963
02:30:29,321 --> 02:30:31,782
I can't believe
I'm tied up again!

1964
02:30:57,975 --> 02:30:58,975
Bro, come on.

1965
02:30:59,059 --> 02:31:00,059
Let's go.

1966
02:31:03,397 --> 02:31:04,397
Thanks, guys.

1967
02:31:06,859 --> 02:31:07,484
Go!

1968
02:31:07,609 --> 02:31:08,277
No!

1969
02:31:08,443 --> 02:31:09,563
- Bro, come on!
- Go, go, go!

1970
02:31:10,737 --> 02:31:12,114
Go, go, go!

Give me that!

1972
02:31:19,913 --> 02:31:20,998
Go, go, go!

1973
02:31:21,707 --> 02:31:22,708
This way.

1974
02:31:30,257 --> 02:31:31,258
Cover, cover!

1975
02:31:37,347 --> 02:31:38,348
You see 'em?

1976
02:31:49,276 --> 02:31:50,277
<i>Bro!</i>

1977
02:31:50,444 --> 02:31:51,546
That was insane, cuz.

1978
02:31:51,570 --> 02:31:52,570
<i>Yeah.</i>

1979
02:31:57,159 --> 02:31:58,160
Get on!

1980
02:31:58,327 --> 02:31:59,328
Come on, bro!

I'm shot.

1983
02:32:06,251 --> 02:32:07,252
Shit!

1984
02:32:08,128 --> 02:32:09,129
Gimme a hand!

1985

Come on.

1987
02:32:18,138 --> 02:32:19,389
- Grab him.
- Bro, I got him.

1988
02:32:21,058 --> 02:32:22,059
Holy shit.

02:32:22,226 --> 02:32:23,227
Hold him up!

1990
02:32:25,854 --> 02:32:26,855
Bro, come on.

1991
02:32:27,564 --> 02:32:28,899
It's okay, bro. I got you.

1992
02:32:29,066 --> 02:32:30,150
Hurry. Go, go, go!

1993
02:32:31,193 --> 02:32:32,528
They have Kiri and Tuk.

1994
02:32:33,904 --> 02:32:34,905
I can't go back.

1995
02:32:42,454 --> 02:32:43,455
Dad!

1996
02:32:44,331 --> 02:32:45,666
Dad, help!
It's Neteyam!

1997
02:32:45,832 --> 02:32:46,875
Hurry!

1998
02:32:47,042 --> 02:32:48,377
Here! Take him.

1999
02:32:50,462 --> 02:32:52,172
- Oh, no.

2000
02:32:52,339 --> 02:32:53,549

- Come on. Come on!

2001

Hurry, please!

Pull!

2003
02:32:59,012 --> 02:33:00,180
Bro, watch his head.

2004
02:33:00,347 --> 02:33:01,598
Pull!

2005
02:33:02,057 --> 02:33:03,057
Come on!

2006
02:33:06,395 --> 02:33:07,729
Just watch his head.

2007
02:33:08,313 --> 02:33:09,313
Okay.

2008
02:33:09,982 --> 02:33:10,732
It's okay, bro.

2009
02:33:10,858 --> 02:33:11,858
We got you.

2010
02:33:12,276 --> 02:33:13,276
Oh, no.

2011
02:33:15,237 --> 02:33:16,237
Put pressure.

2012
02:33:16,321 --> 02:33:17,321
Put pressure on it.

2013
02:33:19,241 --> 02:33:20,367
Dad, I...

2014
02:33:20,492 --> 02:33:21,492
It's okay.
I'm here.

2015
02:33:23,871 --> 02:33:25,122
No, no, no.

2016
02:33:25,289 --> 02:33:26,331
It's okay, son.
I gotcha.

2017
02:33:32,254 --> 02:33:33,255
I want to go home.

2018
02:33:36,175 --> 02:33:37,259
I know. I know.

2019
02:33:37,384 --> 02:33:38,504
It's okay, we're goin' home.

2020
02:33:39,011 --> 02:33:40,095
We're goin' home.

2021
02:33:43,557 --> 02:33:44,808
It's okay. It's okay.

2022
02:33:44,975 --> 02:33:45,976
Dad, I...

2023
02:33:53,066 --> 02:33:54,067
Neteyam...

2024
02:33:59,281 --> 02:34:03,285
No. No, no, no.
Neteyam!

2025
02:34:11,001 --> 02:34:12,503
Oh, Great Mother.

2026
02:34:12,669 --> 02:34:13,754
No, Great Mother.

2027
02:34:14,588 --> 02:34:16,173
<i>Please.</i>

2028
02:34:17,758 --> 02:34:19,218
Oh, my son.

2029
02:34:19,343 --> 02:34:20,844
My son.

2030
02:34:20,969 --> 02:34:21,969
No!

2031
02:34:27,851 --> 02:34:29,353
My son!

2032
02:34:32,856 --> 02:34:34,274
No!

2033
02:34:36,026 --> 02:34:37,611
No!

2034
02:34:38,278 --> 02:34:40,489
<i>Can you hear me, Corporal?</i>

2035
02:34:42,658 --> 02:34:45,369
<i>Yeah, yeah, I think you can.</i>

2036
02:34:46,328 --> 02:34:47,579
<i>I got your daughters.</i>

2037
02:34:50,290 --> 02:34:51,708
<i>Same deal as before.</i>

2038
02:34:53,335 --> 02:34:54,336
You for them.

2039
02:34:55,546 --> 02:34:57,297
<i>No!</i>

2040
02:34:59,675 --> 02:35:01,134
Where are your sisters?

2041
02:35:03,095 --> 02:35:04,596
Your sisters.
Where are they?

2042
02:35:05,514 --> 02:35:06,515
I don't know.

2043
02:35:06,682 --> 02:35:07,992
- Where are they?
- They're on the ship.

2044
02:35:08,016 --> 02:35:09,810
They're tied up on the ship.

2045
02:35:09,977 --> 02:35:11,186
They're at the moon pool.

2046
02:35:11,812 --> 02:35:13,939
At the well deck. Midships.

2047
02:35:14,064 --> 02:35:15,064
What?

2048
02:35:15,399 --> 02:35:16,567
Come on. I'll show you.

2049
02:35:17,192 --> 02:35:18,086
Come on.

2050
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:18,796
I'll show you.

2051
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:20,237
<i>Talk to me, Corporal.</i>

2052
02:35:20,404 --> 02:35:21,964
- Z, up top.
- I need somethin', Jake...

2053
02:35:22,114 --> 02:35:23,657
or there's gonna
be consequences.

2054
02:35:24,658 --> 02:35:25,659
Yeah, I hear you.

2055
02:35:26,785 --> 02:35:27,786
- Come on.
- Come on!

2056
02:35:27,953 --> 02:35:30,205
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on, let's go.

2057
02:35:30,581 --> 02:35:31,915
- No!
- Let's go.

2058
02:35:32,082 --> 02:35:34,877
<i>Listen. Listen. Listen to me.</i>

2059
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:38,649
Listen to me. Listen to me.

2060
02:35:38,673 --> 02:35:40,007
They have our daughters.

2061
02:35:40,174 --> 02:35:41,425
They have our daughters.

2062
02:35:44,678 --> 02:35:46,889
I need you with me.

2063
02:35:48,098 --> 02:35:49,641
And I need you to be strong.

2064
02:35:50,184 --> 02:35:51,602
Right now.

2065
02:35:51,768 --> 02:35:52,978
Strong heart.

2066
02:35:54,396 --> 02:35:55,647
Strong heart.

2067
02:36:09,286 --> 02:36:10,621
Let's go get our daughters.

2068
02:36:25,594 --> 02:36:27,095
You stay with your brother.

2069
02:36:27,638 --> 02:36:29,056
Dad, I want to go with you.

2070
02:36:32,059 --> 02:36:33,060
You've done enough.

2071
02:36:33,227 --> 02:36:34,269
Dad...

2072
02:36:39,066 --> 02:36:40,067
Hold fire.

2073
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:42,361
Let's go.

2074
02:36:43,403 --> 02:36:44,404
He's coming.

2075
02:36:46,281 --> 02:36:47,281
I'm good. Go, go!

2076
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:50,786
Let's get this guy.

2077
02:36:50,911 --> 02:36:52,120
It's what we came here for.

2078
02:36:57,334 --> 02:36:58,335
Stay with him.

2079
02:36:58,877 --> 02:36:59,962
No...

2080
02:37:00,796 --> 02:37:02,130
Heads on a swivel, guys.

2081
02:37:23,527 --> 02:37:24,527
Go.

2082
02:37:32,619 --> 02:37:33,620
Where are they?

2083
02:37:33,787 --> 02:37:34,496
The middle deck.

2084
02:37:34,621 --> 02:37:35,682
Where they launch the subs.

2085
02:37:35,706 --> 02:37:37,124
There's, like,
a pool in the center.

2086
02:37:38,083 --> 02:37:39,323
They're at the forward railing.

2087
02:37:41,795 --> 02:37:42,796
No, no.
Stay here.

2088
02:37:45,966 --> 02:37:47,134
<i>Talk to me, Corporal.</i>

2089
02:37:48,093 --> 02:37:49,178
<i>This ship's going down...</i>

2090
02:37:49,344 --> 02:37:50,512
<i>and your girls with it.</i>

2091
02:37:52,264 --> 02:37:53,849
Your boy didn't have to die.

2092
02:37:54,266 --> 02:37:55,934
<i>You brought that on yourself.</i>

2093
02:38:03,108 --> 02:38:05,944
<i>You thought you could keep
your family safe, but you can't.</i>

2094
02:38:08,322 --> 02:38:10,032
<i>Only one way to keep them safe.</i>

2095
02:38:13,911 --> 02:38:15,913
<i>So let's get this
over with before</i>

2096
02:38:16,038 --> 02:38:17,038
<i>you lose another kid.</i>

2097
02:38:28,717 --> 02:38:29,843
Get down!

2098
02:39:12,261 --> 02:39:13,446
<i>- Who's down?
- Zdinarsik, you copy?</i>

2099
02:39:13,470 --> 02:39:14,513
<i>Sound off!</i>

2100
02:39:14,680 --> 02:39:15,680
Clear!

2101
02:39:16,723 --> 02:39:18,100
Prager.
You read?

2102
02:39:20,143 --> 02:39:21,144
Eyes up.
Eyes up!

2103
02:39:30,404 --> 02:39:31,405
Move up!

2104
02:39:33,949 --> 02:39:34,950
Push left. Go!

2105
02:39:35,659 --> 02:39:36,859
Push right. Get around on her.

2106
02:39:37,286 --> 02:39:38,286
Who's got eyes?

2107
02:40:23,665 --> 02:40:24,665
<i>MaJake.</i>

2108
02:40:31,089 --> 02:40:32,216
It's Mom!

2109
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:39,806
<i>That's right.</i>

2110
02:40:40,182 --> 02:40:42,100
They're coming for you.

2111
02:41:32,943 --> 02:41:33,944
Dad! Dad.

2112
02:41:37,322 --> 02:41:38,574
Okay.
Where's your sister?

2113
02:41:38,699 --> 02:41:39,366
Where is she?
Where is she?

2114
02:41:39,533 --> 02:41:40,993
That way.
That way.

2115
02:41:41,451 --> 02:41:42,452
Okay, stay behind me.

2116
02:41:47,749 --> 02:41:48,749
Kiri!

2117
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:51,461
Runnin' out of time here, Corporal.

2118
02:41:53,255 --> 02:41:56,216
You already lost one kid today.
You really wanna lose another?

2119
02:41:57,092 --> 02:41:58,427
Do not test me!

2120
02:42:00,220 --> 02:42:01,680
Just kill him, Dad!

2121
02:42:04,516 --> 02:42:05,493
Weapons down.

2122
02:42:05,517 --> 02:42:06,226
Don't.

2123
02:42:06,351 --> 02:42:06,953
<i>Don't do it.</i>

2124
02:42:06,977 --> 02:42:07,977
<i>Down!</i>

2125
02:42:10,314 --> 02:42:11,315
<i>Kick 'em away.</i>

2126
02:42:13,525 --> 02:42:14,525
Do it!

2127
02:42:17,362 --> 02:42:18,405
No.

2128
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:21,241
<i>Cuff yourself.</i>

2129
02:42:21,408 --> 02:42:22,826
No! No, don't
hurt her, okay?

2130
02:42:22,993 --> 02:42:23,994
Stand there!

2131
02:42:24,828 --> 02:42:26,389
- Don't!
- Don't move!

2132
02:42:26,413 --> 02:42:27,413
<i>Not a step.</i>

2133
02:42:28,165 --> 02:42:29,875
<i>Cuffs on. Now.</i>

2134
02:42:30,083 --> 02:42:32,127
You son of a bitch.

2135
02:42:32,294 --> 02:42:33,795
Please, don't hurt her.

2136
02:42:37,007 --> 02:42:38,217
Release.

2137
02:42:39,176 --> 02:42:40,177
Or I cut.

2138
02:42:42,763 --> 02:42:44,890
What, you think I
care about some kid?

2139
02:42:46,225 --> 02:42:47,226
He's not mine.

2140
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:49,853
We're not even the same species.

2141
02:42:50,646 --> 02:42:52,147
Just please don't...

2142
02:42:52,272 --> 02:42:53,023
don't hurt her.

2143
02:42:53,190 --> 02:42:54,691
Just please let her go.

2144
02:42:54,858 --> 02:42:55,859
- Don't.
<i>- Please!</i>

2145
02:42:56,026 --> 02:42:56,652
<i>Don't kill him.</i>

2146
02:42:56,777 --> 02:42:57,569
<i>Listen to me!</i>

2147
02:42:57,736 --> 02:42:59,196
Let her go. Don't hurt her.

2148
02:42:59,404 --> 02:43:00,864
Mom, don't kill him.

2149
02:43:01,615 --> 02:43:03,909
A son for a son.

2150
02:43:06,119 --> 02:43:07,371
<i>Please don't hurt her.</i>

2151
02:43:09,706 --> 02:43:10,916
I cut.

2152
02:43:11,083 --> 02:43:12,310
Please just let her go...

2153
02:43:12,334 --> 02:43:13,019
<i>okay?</i>

2154
02:43:13,043 --> 02:43:14,043
<i>Just let her go.</i>

2155
02:43:16,046 --> 02:43:17,046
No!

2156
02:43:26,181 --> 02:43:28,433
Kiri... Kiri.

2157
02:43:35,274 --> 02:43:36,275
Spider.

2158
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:37,776
Spider...

2159
02:43:37,901 --> 02:43:38,986
get 'em out of here.

2160
02:43:39,444 --> 02:43:40,444
Come on.

2161
02:43:40,571 --> 02:43:41,446
Guys. Tuk.

2162
02:43:41,572 --> 02:43:43,365
I owe you a death.

2163
02:43:44,992 --> 02:43:45,594
Mom.

2164
02:43:45,618 --> 02:43:46,618
- Mama.
- Come.

2165
02:43:46,785 --> 02:43:47,720
Come on.

2166
02:43:47,744 --> 02:43:48,620
Please...

2167
02:43:48,745 --> 02:43:49,745
Mama.

2168
02:43:49,872 --> 02:43:51,373
You're not leaving,
are you, Jake?

2169
02:43:52,165 --> 02:43:53,166
Knowin' I'm out there.

2170
02:43:54,418 --> 02:43:56,503
Knowin' that I'll never stop.

2171
02:43:56,879 --> 02:43:58,172
I'm coming for you.

2172
02:43:58,338 --> 02:44:01,049
And when I do, I'll
kill your whole family.

2173
02:44:02,092 --> 02:44:03,092
Dad...

2174
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:06,220
Then let's get it done.

2175
02:44:16,899 --> 02:44:17,900
Jake!

2176
02:44:22,196 --> 02:44:23,280
- It's coming!
- Back. Back.

2177
02:44:23,447 --> 02:44:24,656
Get back to the ship. Go!

2178
02:44:24,823 --> 02:44:25,824
Tuk, swim, swim.

2179
02:44:28,994 --> 02:44:29,994
Stay close.

2180
02:44:30,204 --> 02:44:31,284
- Keep moving.
- Stay close.

2181
02:44:33,832 --> 02:44:34,832
Tuk!

2182
02:44:35,792 --> 02:44:36,668
Mom, take my hand!

2183
02:44:36,793 --> 02:44:37,793
Hold on!

2184
02:44:40,797 --> 02:44:41,882
Mom!

2185
02:44:43,550 --> 02:44:44,550
- Kiri, come on.
- No...

2186
02:44:44,593 --> 02:44:45,469
Kiri, we've got to go, come on.

2187
02:44:45,594 --> 02:44:46,594
No!

2188
02:44:49,473 --> 02:44:50,933
Go! Climb.
Climb!

2189
02:44:51,391 --> 02:44:52,392
Kiri, come on!

2190
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:54,603
Come on, let's go!

2191
02:44:55,354 --> 02:44:55,979
Mom!

2192
02:44:56,104 --> 02:44:57,104
Swim! Swim.

2193
02:44:57,189 --> 02:44:57,856
Go, Tuk.

2194
02:44:57,981 --> 02:44:58,981
Climb up.

2195
02:45:06,323 --> 02:45:07,323
Mom...

2196
02:45:08,116 --> 02:45:09,117
Go!

2197
02:45:09,660 --> 02:45:10,661
Go, go, go!

2198
02:45:18,126 --> 02:45:19,294
Keep climbing!
Go!

2199
02:45:23,841 --> 02:45:24,842
I got you.

2200
02:45:27,177 --> 02:45:28,011
Give me your hand!

2201
02:45:28,136 --> 02:45:29,136
Come on!

2202
02:45:31,431 --> 02:45:32,431
Open it!

2203
02:45:40,899 --> 02:45:41,501
Open it!

2204
02:45:41,525 --> 02:45:42,210
Move back.

2205
02:45:42,234 --> 02:45:43,234
Move back.

2206
02:45:43,652 --> 02:45:44,653
Come.

2207
02:45:46,154 --> 02:45:47,154
Tuk!

2208
02:45:56,957 --> 02:45:57,957
Climb!

2209
02:45:58,166 --> 02:45:59,166
Go!

2210
02:46:01,378 --> 02:46:02,378
Climb!

2211
02:46:02,462 --> 02:46:03,462
Go!

2212
02:46:03,922 --> 02:46:04,922
Go up!

2213
02:46:10,512 --> 02:46:11,513
We're rolling over!

2214
02:46:11,889 --> 02:46:12,490
Go, go, go, go!

2215
02:46:12,514 --> 02:46:13,514
Okay...

2216
02:46:15,893 --> 02:46:16,977
No!

2217
02:46:17,436 --> 02:46:18,562
Mom!

2218
02:46:26,695 --> 02:46:27,696
Kiri!

2219
02:46:27,821 --> 02:46:28,821
Keep going!

2220
02:46:32,242 --> 02:46:33,243
This way, this way!

2221
02:46:33,744 --> 02:46:34,411
Okay.

2222
02:46:34,578 --> 02:46:35,578
Go!

2223
02:46:39,333 --> 02:46:41,335
Open it!
Open it!

2224
02:46:43,295 --> 02:46:44,379
Mom!

2225
02:46:47,424 --> 02:46:48,425
Come on!

2226
02:46:57,976 --> 02:46:58,977
Go, Tuk!

2227
02:47:01,063 --> 02:47:02,064
There's no way out!

2228
02:47:04,358 --> 02:47:05,442
Stay together, okay?

2229
02:47:05,609 --> 02:47:06,985
- Yes.
- Stay together.

2230
02:47:07,152 --> 02:47:08,153
Yes.

2231
02:47:37,099 --> 02:47:38,308
Oh, Great Mother!

2232
02:47:38,433 --> 02:47:39,810
Oh, Great Mother, help us!

2233
02:48:22,644 --> 02:48:23,645
Kiri!

2234
02:48:44,208 --> 02:48:45,208
Bro!

2235
02:48:45,792 --> 02:48:46,792
Mom and Dad...

2236
02:48:46,835 --> 02:48:47,544
are down there.

2237
02:48:47,669 --> 02:48:48,295
In the ship.

2238
02:48:48,462 --> 02:48:49,505
Grab on.

2239
02:48:50,297 --> 02:48:51,298
Bro, I'm
good. Go!

2240
02:49:19,034 --> 02:49:20,035
Okay.

2241
02:49:47,855 --> 02:49:48,856
Jake!

2242
02:50:25,601 --> 02:50:26,601
Dad.

2243
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:32,441
Fuck!

2244
02:50:47,206 --> 02:50:48,957
Come on, you son of a bitch!

2245
02:50:49,166 --> 02:50:50,166
Dad, just breathe.

2246
02:50:50,292 --> 02:50:51,292
Neteyam?

2247
02:50:51,919 --> 02:50:52,920
No, Dad.
It's Lo'ak.

2248
02:50:54,338 --> 02:50:55,339
Oh, Lo'ak.

2249
02:50:56,632 --> 02:50:57,633
I'm sorry, sir.

2250
02:50:58,133 --> 02:50:59,843
I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

2251
02:51:00,052 --> 02:51:01,053
Just focus.

2252
02:51:01,178 --> 02:51:02,262
Focus on now.

2253
02:51:21,532 --> 02:51:22,658
We're losing the air pocket.

2254
02:51:22,824 --> 02:51:23,825
Come on.
We've gotta move.

2255
02:51:23,992 --> 02:51:25,077
Come on, Dad.

2256
02:51:32,793 --> 02:51:34,336
You know your way out?

2257
02:51:34,753 --> 02:51:37,464
I think so. But, Dad,
it's gonna be a long breath-hold.

2258
02:51:37,631 --> 02:51:39,174
I can't make it.

2259
02:51:39,716 --> 02:51:41,093
You can. You can.

2260
02:51:41,218 --> 02:51:41,844
No.

2261
02:51:41,969 --> 02:51:43,011
So you gotta go right now.

2262
02:51:43,512 --> 02:51:45,055
I can't lose you too, Dad.

2263
02:51:45,222 --> 02:51:46,222
Please.

2264
02:51:50,394 --> 02:51:51,979
Mama, I'm scared.

2265
02:51:53,480 --> 02:51:54,481
It is all right.

2266
02:51:55,315 --> 02:51:56,358
Stay close to me.

2267
02:51:57,317 --> 02:51:58,360
Stay close to Mama.

2268
02:52:00,946 --> 02:52:01,947
It's okay.

2269
02:52:18,630 --> 02:52:20,465
You just have to
slow your heart down.

2270
02:52:20,924 --> 02:52:22,092
Be real calm.

2271
02:52:23,427 --> 02:52:24,678
Breathe from here.

2272
02:52:24,845 --> 02:52:26,430
Hey, breathe from here.

2273
02:52:39,985 --> 02:52:41,320
The way of water has no...

2274
02:52:41,445 --> 02:52:42,738
beginning and no end.

2275
02:52:45,449 --> 02:52:47,492
The sea is around
you and in you.

2276
02:52:49,119 --> 02:52:50,329
The sea is your home...

2277
02:52:50,454 --> 02:52:52,789
before your birth
and after your death.

2278
02:52:58,003 --> 02:53:00,881
<i>The sea gives and the sea takes.</i>

2279
02:53:02,132 --> 02:53:04,176
<i>Water connects all things.</i>

2280
02:53:06,345 --> 02:53:07,888
Life to death.

2281
02:53:09,723 --> 02:53:12,017
Darkness to light.

2282
02:53:35,290 --> 02:53:36,124
- Hi.
- Kiri!

2283
02:53:36,291 --> 02:53:37,291
Kiri.

2284
02:53:37,417 --> 02:53:39,419
Everything's going to
be all right, little sister.

2285
02:53:39,753 --> 02:53:40,587
Mom...

2286
02:53:40,712 --> 02:53:42,089
I'm gonna give this to you.

2287
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:48,135
It'll help you.

2288
02:53:49,596 --> 02:53:50,596
Dad, you can do this.

2289
02:53:52,391 --> 02:53:53,600
Trust me.

2290
02:53:54,226 --> 02:53:55,226
Calm your heart.

2291
02:53:57,563 --> 02:53:58,564
Big breaths.

2292
02:54:02,568 --> 02:54:03,569
Last breath.

2293
02:54:08,615 --> 02:54:09,616
Follow me.

2294
02:55:25,943 --> 02:55:27,194
Hold on.

2295
02:55:27,319 --> 02:55:28,319
Just breathe.

2296
02:55:28,904 --> 02:55:29,904
Just breathe.

2297
02:55:34,326 --> 02:55:35,327
Thank you.

2298
02:55:44,336 --> 02:55:45,838
I See you...

2299
02:55:46,004 --> 02:55:47,004
son.

2300
02:55:49,466 --> 02:55:50,466
<i>MaJake!</i>

2301
02:55:51,718 --> 02:55:52,845
- Dad!
- Mom!

2302
02:55:53,011 --> 02:55:54,221
Dad. Dad.

2303
02:55:55,722 --> 02:55:56,722
Come on.

2304
02:55:58,934 --> 02:56:00,102
Here.

2305
02:56:06,441 --> 02:56:07,442
Brother.

2306
02:56:16,869 --> 02:56:18,787
<i>Sullys stick together.</i>

2307
02:56:21,123 --> 02:56:22,666
<i>It was our greatest weakness...</i>

2308
02:56:24,042 --> 02:56:25,502
<i>and our great strength.</i>

2309
02:56:27,504 --> 02:56:29,256
Thank you, Great Mother.

2310
02:56:29,965 --> 02:56:30,966
Thank you.

2311
02:57:10,297 --> 02:57:11,298
Let's move out.

2312
02:57:17,930 --> 02:57:18,931
Son.

2313
02:57:21,183 --> 02:57:22,184
Come with me.

2314
02:57:26,939 --> 02:57:27,940
Spider!

2315
02:58:02,266 --> 02:58:03,266
Monkey Boy!

2316
02:58:07,855 --> 02:58:09,064
Spider.

2317
02:58:16,405 --> 02:58:17,573
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2318
02:58:21,785 --> 02:58:22,786
Come here.

2319
02:58:25,789 --> 02:58:27,958
<i>A son for a son.</i>

2320
02:58:44,725 --> 02:58:46,977
<i>Every song cord must have a last bead.</i>

2321
02:59:12,169 --> 02:59:14,004
<i>A father protects.</i>

2322
02:59:15,339 --> 02:59:16,840
<i>It's what gives him meaning.</i>

2323
02:59:45,202 --> 02:59:47,663
<i>The People say that
all energy is only borrowed.</i>

2324
02:59:50,499 --> 02:59:52,376
<i>And one day you
have to give it back.</i>

2325
03:00:06,223 --> 03:00:07,891
<i>Eywa holds...</i>

2326
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:09,518
<i>all her children in her heart.</i>

2327
03:00:11,478 --> 03:00:12,771
<i>Nothing is ever lost.</i>

2328
03:00:16,108 --> 03:00:17,109
Neteyam!

2329
03:00:17,734 --> 03:00:18,944
<i>Neteyam!</i>

2330
03:00:39,006 --> 03:00:40,257
My family and I...

2331
03:00:41,383 --> 03:00:42,426
we'll move on tomorrow.

2332
03:00:43,177 --> 03:00:44,303
Far away from here.

2333
03:00:45,721 --> 03:00:47,431
Your son lies
with our ancestors.

2334
03:00:48,724 --> 03:00:51,393
You are <i>Metkayina</i> now.

2335
03:00:57,107 --> 03:00:58,525
<i>And there it was.</i>

2336
03:01:00,527 --> 03:01:01,945
<i>We are Sea People now.</i>

2337
03:01:04,489 --> 03:01:06,408
<i>This is our home.</i>

2338
03:02:06,969 --> 03:02:07,970
Dad!

2339
03:02:08,846 --> 03:02:09,847
Look what I caught!

2340
03:02:10,639 --> 03:02:11,640
Wow.

2341
03:02:12,933 --> 03:02:13,976
Oh, that's a big one.

2342
03:02:14,643 --> 03:02:16,311
He was in that pool.

2343
03:02:16,436 --> 03:02:17,436
By the rocks.

2344
03:02:19,273 --> 03:02:20,524
Right where you said.

2345
03:02:24,403 --> 03:02:25,529
<i>What is it, Dad?</i>

2346
03:02:27,072 --> 03:02:28,073
Why are you crying?

2347
03:02:30,367 --> 03:02:32,953
I'm just happy to see you, boy.

2348
03:02:34,580 --> 03:02:35,914
I'm happy to see you, too.

2349
03:02:38,667 --> 03:02:39,293
Here.

2350
03:02:39,418 --> 03:02:40,418
You try.

2351
03:02:42,671 --> 03:02:43,672
Okay.

2352
03:02:45,424 --> 03:02:46,758
Leave any for me?

2353
03:02:46,925 --> 03:02:47,926
Maybe.

2354
03:02:54,600 --> 03:02:56,351
<i>Yeah! Check that out. See?</i>

2355
03:03:03,984 --> 03:03:05,277
<i>I see now.</i>

2356
03:03:06,236 --> 03:03:08,238
<i>I can't save my
family by running.</i>

2357
03:03:09,406 --> 03:03:10,449
<i>This is our home.</i>

2358
03:03:11,450 --> 03:03:13,035
<i>This is our fortress.</i>

2359
03:03:14,411 --> 03:03:16,496
<i>This is where we make our stand.</i>
